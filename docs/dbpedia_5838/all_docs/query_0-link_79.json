I believe that Mr. Graf has in mind a \"Dictionary of Aerospace Abbreviations and Acronyms.\" Entry samples would in- clude such valid terms as: ACRE — Automatic Checkout and Readiness Equipment. BOSS — Bioastronautical Orbital Space System. COED — Computer Operated Electronic Display. DOC — Direct Operating Cost. EGAD — Electromagnetic Gas Detector. FUR — Failure, Unsatisfactory, or Re- moval (report). GERM — Ground Effect Research Ma- chine. HE — High Explosive. IDA — Institute for Defense Analysis. JAG — Judge Advocate General. KISS — \"Keep It Simple, Stupid\" (or \"Sir,\" as applicable.) LACE — Liquid Air Cycle Engine. MAD — Motor Assembly and Disassem- bly (Building, or area). NIB — Non-interference Basis (on a). OAR — Office of Aerospace Research. PIG — Pendulous Integrating Gyro. — and so on. . . I conservatively estimate that such an undertaking would occupy your entire or- ganization for a period of not less than six months. Then a staff of researchers would be required to merely keep the list- ing up to date. However, there is a crying need for such a dictionary and I am sure your efforts would be rewarded. (A pre- publication price of $5 to $7 would be about right, and you may bill me for the first copy.) Several years ago Lear, Inc., of Santa Monica, published such a handy-dandy booklet titled \"Aviation Alphabet Scoop.\" With this as a starter I have since accumu- lated several thousand additional abbrevi- ations and terms, am about to give up the entire hobby as a hopelessly never-ending task.

Face of Jupiter To the Editor: Mr. Forward's article on Jupiter (\"Jupi- ter—Probe Target After Mars,\" M/R, Dec. 4, p. 22) was both interesting and inform- ative. However, the illustration depicting the band structure of the planet omitted several important features and was some- what inaccurate. I fully realize that the diagram for such an article is not intended to be detailed and hence could accept the circular rather than the elliptical shape, JUPITER'S spots show in 200-in. photo. but I do feel that the following points should be noted: 1. The polar areas should be termed regions, not zones, and are actually dark rather than light. 2. The South equatorial belt is al- ways divided by a rather prominent light strip. 3. The equatorial zone is divided by a fine dark band which Russia's S. K. Vsekhsviatsky believes to be the shadow produced by a ring similar to Saturn's but much less dense and hence unobservable. 4. Two additional temperate zones should be included. Raymond J. Stein Supervisor Planetarium and Observatory The Newark Museum Newark, N.J. Spies Everywhere To the Editor: Some readers have greeted, with joy- ous cries of malice, your editorial com- ments regarding the non-profit organiza- tions, and at least a few of these people seem to be writing through their hats. Mr. Kelchner (Letters, M/R, Dec. 4), for instance, fears that staff members of non-profit organizations may steal secrets from some industrial companies and ped- dle them to others. Why stop there? The danger is all around us. How about company employees who may carry their own companies' secrets to others? Let's go further: Consider the danger that Martian midgets may hide under the beds of scientists to record their midnight musings and sell them. Quickly, men, break out the brooms and poke under those beds. Ready? Poke! Isn't the role of non-profit organiza- tions in national defense worthy of intelli- gent, dignified examination?

The former Ford president is said to be still unconvinced that the time has come to start working a lot harder on some new hardware for SAC — like Dyna-Soar. Biggest Budget The Kennedy Administration's FY '63 defense budget of more than $5 1 billion will be the biggest in the nation's peacetime history — but it still had to undergo a last- minute hacking to keep it under an arbitrary ceiling set by the Budget Bureau. The budget probably will go to Congress around Jan. 22. On the Pad First manned Mercury orbital launch is still set for Jan. 16. ... It will be followed within weeks by the first attempt at a lunar hard-landing with a Ranger capsule and the fourth of NASA's Tiros weather satellites. The Push for Zeus The Army is stepping up its drive to win approval of plans to put the big Nike-Zeus system into production. The three test launchings of the Western Electric anti- missile missile Dec. 14 — all within one hour — is expected to be only the first of a sensational series of tests dem- onstrating the system's capability. The goal: Authoriza- tion of production and deployment before Congress goes home next summer. Navy's New Missile Outlook: Blank Although it has some new birds in the study stage, the Navy doesn't expect to move any missiles into the devel- opment stage this year. Emphasis will be on improving existing models. INDUSTRY Dupont to Build at Cape? There's a report Dupont has purchased 6400 acres of land near the Cocoa-Titusville airport at Cape Canaveral and is getting ready to move into solid-propellant manu- facture— presumably for big boosters. Countdown is told that the giant chemical company presently is negoti- ating with a small firm doing solid-fuel experimental work. The reported plan: acquire the firm, expand it and get into competition with Thiokol, Aerojet and the other big propellant producers. Thiokol Diversifies into Plastics In a diversification move, Thiokol Chemical Corp. is buying an industrial laminates plant from the St. Regis Paper Co.'s Panelyte Division at Trenton, N.J. Thiokol intends to expand and improve the firm's product line of sheet, tube and rod laminates for the electrical, appliance and other manufacturing industries. Front Office Intelligence Promoted to vice president at Aerojet-General Corp.: William C. House, director of Nerva operations, and Dr. Ernest R. Roberts, who has been assistant manager of the company's Solid Rocket Plant at Sacramento. ... At Northrop Corp., F. W. Lloyd has been named assistant general manager-operations and Welko E. Gasich assist- ant general manager-technical — two new positions carry- ing vice presidential rank. . . . H. F. Konig is being moved from general manager of General Electric's Light Military Electronics Division at Utica, N.Y., to consultant to Dr. George Haller, general manager of the company's De- fense Electronics Division at Syracuse. Konig is being replaced by Gerald A. Hoyt . . . and at Huntsville, \"Mr. Zeus,\" Col. Glenn V. Crane, is leaving this month as project manager of the A-ICBM for a tour at the Indus- trial College of the Armed Forces. R&D Intelligence The Air Force is looking for a minimum three years of useful life in its gel-solid propellant being developed by Atlantic Research Corp. . . . Slippage in the Centaur launch program is now being attributed to the failure of several subcontracted systems to meet specs. . . . Sperry Gyro scientists have come up with quantity-production method for hexafluorobenzene, a radiation-resistant liquid which shows promise as a base for \"floating\" inertia] guidance system components. Patent Progress Unlikely Resolution of the controversy over government patent policies doesn't appear in the cards for the next congres- sional session. The reason: The Kennedy Administration has come up with legislation which would give the gov- ernment title to all patents developed by private industry under R&D contracts. The bill is expected to be de- feated— leaving the status quo. INTERNATIONAL France's Space Program Shapes Up France — with the creation Dec. 19 of CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) — plans to spend about $16 million this year on space research. Half will go into domestic programs and the rest in international efforts. Spending on space is expected to rise to a yearly volume of about $30 million. Overseas Pipeline Belgium's first rocket motor test facility is ready for operation at Zutendaal under the government's Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre. . . . Boelkow and Focke- Wulf have finished a joint design study for the West German third stage of the projected European satellite launcher. . . . France is ready to launch a 4-stage Berenice research rocket in a Mach 12 nose cone test . . . and Brazil is now moving ahead with a space research program. missiles and rockets, January 1, 1962 7 The Missile / Space Week Apollo Subs Named North American Aviation, prime for NASA's Apollo lunar spacecraft, has named four major subcontrac- tors— all of whom worked on the original (M/R, Dec. 4, p. 15). Collins Radio will produce the telecom- munications system at more than $40 million; Minneapolis-Honeywell the stabilization and control system at more than $30 million; Garrett Corp.'s AiResearch Division the en- vironmental control system at more than $10 million; and Northrop's Radioplane Division the parachute recovery system. Shots of the Week The Army revealed Dec. 21 the successful intercept of a Nike-Her- cules with a Nike-Zeus A-ICBM on Dec. 14 over White Sands Missile Range. The Zeus missile exploded, says the Army, \"well within the lethal radius\" of its nuclear warhead and would have killed the Hercules (see photo). HE was used in the Zeus. Within one hour of the test, the Army also fired Zeus missiles from Point Mugu, Calif., and from an underground pad on Kwajalein Atoll, which is being readied for tests against ICBM warheads later this year. The Mugu shot was described as the \"longest and highest flight\" of the Zeus to date. In other major launchings: • The Air Force on Dec. 18 scored its second success in a row with a Minuteman out of a silo. The Cape Canaveral shot went 3600 miles. • The Air Force lost a monkey which rode 5000 miles in a capsule aboard an Atlas fired from the Cape on Dec. 19. However, the shot did provide telemetered measurements on neutron density which may supply ZEUS explodes near Hercules (arrow). data on the formation of the lower Van Allen belt. AOMC Reorganizes Missile R&D; 800 Lose Their Jobs The Army Ordnance Missile Command — in a major shakeup — is eliminating the Army Ballistic Mis- sile Agency (ABMA) and the Army Rocket and Guided Missile Agency (ARGMA). All missile programs are being reorganized under AOMC into 13 weapon system project offices. The reorganization means a re- duction of 800 civilians in AOMC's work force. Most of this group is expected to be absorbed into NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center at Huntsville. Brig. Gen. John G. Zierdt — for- merly commander of ARGMA — has been named Deputy Commanding General for Guided Missiles while the ABMA commander, Brig. Gen. Richard M. Hurst, has been desig- nated Deputy Commanding General for Ballistic Missiles. Both are under AOMC commander Maj. Gen. August Schomberg. Named to head the project offices under Zierdt were: Col. Glenn Crane — Nike-Zeus antimissile missile; Col. B. J. Leon Hirshorn — Mauler and Redeye air defense missile sys- tems; Col. Harry M. Murray — Hawk and NATO-ff<wJfc; Lt. Col. Joseph C. Baer — Nike-Hercules and Nike- Ajax and target missiles; and Lt. Col. William W. Cobb — Field Army Ballistic Missile Defense System (FABMDS).

Cook, President of the Aerospace Industries Association, predicts a steady increase in missile and space spending in 1962. The retired Air Force Officer said that aerospace industry sales this year will equal the 1961 total of $14.8 billion, with a decline in mili- tary aircraft production offsetting the increase in missile and space activity. He reported that sales of missiles hit an estimated $4.8 billion in Fiscal 1961. The Securities and Exchange Commission identifies 51 companies as aerospace manufacturers. Sales of those firms increased $500 million in 1961 to a total of $13.5 billion. Earnings of the same firms reached $240 million last year, well above earnings of $184 million in 1960. Gen. Cook said that employment in the industry which had declined for the past several years, leveled out during 1961. In September last year, employ- ment totaled 673,000. It is expected to remain at about that level through 1962. How to Build an MRBM The Air Force appears to have chosen a piece-by-piece approach to developing a highly mobile medium- range ballistic missile (MRBM) and possibly a third-generation ICBM. The plan apparently is to develop a new guidance system, a new motor, a new warhead — and put them to- gether later. Latest evidence of this includes two recent contracts — $2 million each to AC Spark Plug Div. of General Motors and General Precision, Inc. — for R&D of stellar inertial guidance and control systems for \"long-range ballistic missiles.\" Early last month, Hamilton Stand- ard Div. of United Aircraft Corp. received a $1.6-million award for what the Air Force publicly described only as an \"advanced stellar guidance system.\" Abbott Retires from NASA Ira H. Abbott, Director of NASA's Office of Advanced Research and Technology, will retire this week after 32 years of government service. No successor has been named. Deputy Associate Administrator Thomas F. Dixon will double as act- ing director of the office. Abbott intends to devote his full time to public affairs. EGO To Carry Potpourri Nineteen experiments are sched- uled to be aboard the first Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (OGO) when it is launched in 1963. The experiments — ranging from studies of solar cosmic rays to micro- meteroid and vector velocities — will be boosted by an Atlas-Agena B into an eccentric orbit of 70,000 miles apogee and 170 miles perigee. The first of the OGO satellite series has been dubbed EGO, the Eccentric Orbiting Observatory. An- other, to be launched in 1964, will be called POGO because of its polar orbit flight path. OGO is often referred to as NASA's \"streetcar satellite\" because it is the first standardized satellite for carrying a group of scientific ex- periments. Modular compartments, booms and space in the body of the observatory will be able to carry as many as 50 different experiments in any one space mission. Three of the spacecraft are being constructed by Space Technology Laboratories Inc. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is managing the project. The spacecraft is approximately 6 ft. long by 3 ft. square. The solar paddles are about 6 ft. square and the satellite — including experiments — weighs almost 900 lbs. EGO's 19 experiments will weigh a total of approximately 150 lbs. Components of 15 experiments, weighing more than 87 lbs., are lo- cated in standard size boxes in the main body of the satellite. Compo- nents of five experiments are carried in packages at the ends of the two solar paddles. OGO will be stabilized so that the same axis constantly points toward the earth. It will be equipped with both gas jets and reaction wheels for attitude control. The satellite will have three tele- metry systems — wide band, narrow band, and a special-purpose system — to send data back to the earth. In addition, a command system is capa- ble of directing about 250 operations in the spacecraft and its experiments.

New Million-lb.-thrust Engine Sought Dyna-Soar to be 'streamlined'; Titan III funds okayed; Douglas wins Saturn S-4B award by Hal Taylor NASA IS PLANNING shortly to undertake the multi- million-dollar development of a new rocket engine — a 1- million-lb. -thrust, hydrogen-fueled powerplant for upper stages. Designated the M-l, the engine is intended to be used singly or paired to produce 2 million lbs. of thrust. Missiles and Rockets has learned that the M-l is designed as a third stage for Nova. There is also a possibility it may replace Nova's second stage, which is to be powered by two 1.5- million-lb. -thrust F-l engines. Disclosure of the new project caps these other major year-end moves in the nation's military and civilian space programs: —After six months' delay, the Defense Department finally bought part of the Air Force's proposal to \"stream- line\" the Dyna-Soar program by eliminating sub-orbital flights with Titan II boosters. But DOD officials indicated last week that there still will be no acceleration in Dyna- Soar funding. Only $100 million of the $185 million voted by Congress is to be used in FY '62, and there is a pos- sibility the $100-million funding rate may be continued in FY '63. —The Kennedy Administration approved FY '63 funds for the Titan III — a liquid-solid booster for Dyna-Soar orbital flights (M/R, June 12, 1961, p. 12). —NASA apparently has decided that the advanced Saturn S-1B first-stage booster will have five E-l engines developing total thrust of 7.5 million lbs. The second stage of this booster will have five J-2 engines developing a total of 1 million lbs. thrust. The new vehicle probably will be called the Saturn C-5. — NASA awarded Douglas Aircraft Corp. a $50-million contract to build the S-4B third stage of the Saturn C-5. The stage calls for the use of a single J-2 engine developing 200,000 lbs. thrust. This will replace the earlier planned stage which was to have six RL-10 engines with a stage thrust of 90,000 lbs. (M/R, Aug. 7, 1961, and M/R, Dec. 18, 1961). • Contractor up in air — The liquid hydrogen M-l engine results from proposals from Aerojet-General Corp. and the Rocketdyne Division of North American Aviation Inc. NASA officials have not decided whether to award the contract to one of these firms or to ask all interested com- panies to submit bids before selecting a prime contractor. Announcement of the new engine and the method of selecting the contractor is expected in about two weeks. Primary advantage of the M-l will be a 30% increase in thrust per weight of the propellant over the conventional large liquid-propelled engines. 10 Meanwhile, Administration approval of the Titan III gives the Air Force its most powerful rocket to date. It will feature the unusual combination of solid and liquid fuel technology. In the center will be the 430,000-lb.-thrust Titan 11 inter- continental ballistic missile. Clustered around it will be two or more 120-in. solid rocket motors. The new vehicle will have a thrust of about 1.5 million lbs. if two of the solid motors are used. It would be able to hurl 14-ton payloads into earth orbit, thus approaching the capability of NASA's Saturn C-l launch vehicle. A DOD announcement Dec. 26 said the Air Force would sign a new contract with Martin Marietta Corp. — developer of the Titan 11 — so that it could go ahead with initial work applicable to the new space booster system. At the same time, the Air Force is expected in the next few weeks to invite industry proposals to build the 120-in. solid-fuel rocket motor- — largest of its type in the U.S. As the Air Force was awarded its largest space booster, NASA also moved to increase the capability of its advanced Saturn booster by increasing the thrust of its S-4B third stage. The space agency said that the contract with Douglas provides for the development of six flight and four ground test versions of the stage. The stage will be used on the large launch vehicle when it boosts the Apollo spacecraft on circumlunar missions. It would also be used on orbital rendezvous missions if that concept of space flight proves feasible. If this occurs, a far larger number of the stages will be required. NASA announced on December 20 that the Boeing Co. had been selected to build the first stage of the Saturn C-5 booster. George H. Stoner, formerly director of its Dyna- Soar program, will serve as Boeing's General Manager- Saturn Boosters. Stoner said that key members of his management team will leave shortly for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the government-owned Michoud, La., operations plant to begin work on the contract. He also said segments of his organization will be located at Cape Canaveral and at NASA's recently announced Mis- sissippi static test-firing facility. The work at Marshall will, for the most part, be temporary and will involve familiariza- tion, training, and liaison with NASA personnel engaged in the Saturn program. Boeing planning calls for a phased buildup of its Saturn operations in the Southeast to require several thousand em- ployees by mid- 1963. It missiles and rockets, January 1, 1962 LANGLEY RESEARCH Center scientist holds model of the projected 15 -man space station in erected condition. PRECURSOR OF bigger space stations under consideration is this 30-ft.-dia. version built by B. F. Goodrich. Space Agency Ponders 15-AAan Station NASA SCIENTISTS are taking a thorough look today at what could be- come one of America's next big space projects — -a 15-man erectable space sta- tion weighing 75,000 lbs. Administrator James E. Webb has already declared that a decision on the station will have to be made by 1965. To meet the deadline, scientists at NASA's Langley Research Center are heavily engaged in their own basic re- search and have awarded North Ameri- can Aviation Corp. a $100,000 feasibil- ity study contract. Other firms, including B. F. Goodrich and Grumman Aircraft, are also taking part. Further study con- tracts— principally in material concepts — will be awarded next year. NASA has been spending about $200,000 a year on the space station work. When, and if, it becomes an official NASA program, funds will likely be in the multimillion or more category. Langley scientists hasten to assert that design and research on the space stations is still in the preliminary stage. They declare, however that \"We've done a lot of work on it and it looks good.\" The station could be used for con- ducting space research and an orbiting base for deep space missions and plane- tary exploration. NASA officials esti- mate that it could be test-flown by 1975. » Torus form — The erectable con- cept is an outgrowth of research by Langley's Applied Materials and Re- search Division. It would be structurally composed of six rigid 9-ft.-high cylindrical mod- ules for crew quarters, joined by inflat- able connector sections arranged in a torus shape. A rigid central hub, connected to the ring by three inflatable, radial tubes, could serve as passageways when in- flated and as connecting hinges between modules to form a compact package. A fully deployed station of that de- sign would be rotated about its hub to provide artificial gravity for the crew and instrumentation. The torus config- uration would allow a diameter of 120 to 150 ft., an area necessary for an appreciable amount of gravity at low RPM. The hub of the station would be non-rotating to provide prolonged zero gravity for extended research into weightlessness. The erectable space station would be packed into the nose of a Saturn C-4 or Nova launch vehicle and would be automatically inflated in space. The automatic erection would elimi- nate the necessity for having a crew assembling a number of small units launched separately into space — another method being considered for the con- struction of a space station. There is doubt among NASA officials that the present state of technology makes the latter concept feasible. The space station concept could also be grounded by the theory, shared by NASA and other U.S. space experts, that a base on the moon may ultimately prove to be the best launch site for long manned interplanetary missions. Such a base is far from realization, how- ever, and there is a strong belief that the space station could be operational a lot sooner — plus having the advantage of serving as a large laboratory for space research. • Multipurpose — The space station would be compatible with both the two- man Mercury capsule and the Apollo lunar landing spacecraft. This would enable the station to have a rendezvous capability with either of the spacecraft. The 75t000-lb. total weight — during launch — would include an Apollo com- mand module re-entry vehicle. Both the top and bottom of the sta- tion hub would serve as a port for the spacecraft on which they can dock and take off on long interplanetary missions. In addition, the station could be used as a storage area for propulsion, sup- plies and equipment for long manned interplanetary missions. The spacecraft would also serve as a carrier to return crew members to the earth. The B. F. Goodrich Co. has already constructed a 24-ft.-diameter erectable station for Langley, which has used it in development work. Material used was seven miles of dacron cord. A fibreglass wound filament with a plastic binding is also being considered. Langley scientists assert, however, that much work must still be done before a decision as to the final material for the station's outer shell is possible. They also point out that no matter what ma- terial is used, once the station is inflated, it will be as solid as metal. Other problem areas which the NASA Center is still working include: —The effects of radiation and me- teroids on an inflated craft. —The problems involved in \"folding the material'' so that it is not damaged. —What types of structures will be most efficient. —How to achieve thermal balance within the spacecraft so that the heat of the sun and the coldness of space can be used to provide normal temperature. missiles and rockets, January 1, 1962 11 NASA struggles to compete . . . Scientist/ Engineer Shortage Worsens by Heather M. David CONCERN is mounting at the Na- tional Aeronautics and Space Admin- istration as the nation's force of engi- neers and scientists continues to shrink. As engineering schools report lower and lower enrollments, personnel offices of the nation's space program say the demand for qualified men is skyrocket- ing— and will probably double within the decade. Recent surveys show that the num- ber of total engineers enrolled as fresh- men has decreased steadily for the past four years. The drop is even more dra- matic when contrasted against the total yearly increase of freshmen. An in- formal survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education shows that in the period from 1953-1957, engineering freshmen accounted for about 10.5% of all incoming freshmen. This percent- age dropped to 9% in 1958, 8.2% in 1959, 7.3% in 1960, and 6.6% in 1961. Even if this percentage is bolstered by the nation's entry into the moon race, the shortage will be felt for at least four or five years as these \"low\" classes graduate. It's a nice situation for those engi- neers and scientists armed with degrees enabling them to participate in the space program. Pay scales which already have been rising about 5% per year in the last few years will undoubtedly in- crease more rapidly as demand grows. • NASA's hiring plans — Personnel Director Dr. Robert Lacklan says NASA is hiring about 2000 engineers and scientists in FY '62. This number will be at least repeated next year. What NASA gets from graduating college classes only meets its turnover, which is about 8% each year. (About 34% of NASA's current total of 18,000 em- ployees are professional people.) This means that NASA must get some 1650 new engineers and scientists from other sources this year, and even more in the years to come, as its budget moves up- ward to a $5-billion level about 1964. By comparison, the Air Force Sys- tems Command, engaged in somewhat parallel work, has a work force of about 70,000 for its current budget of about $5 billion. Competition with industry for these highly trained men is tough and will get much worse. All segments of industry — not only those connected with the mis- Salary Comparisons, Professional Personnel GS Grade Industry Rate Government Rate 5 $ 6,576 $ 5,335 7 7,308 6,345 9 8,460 6,435 11 9,984 7,560 12 11,520 8,955 13 13,368 10,635 14 16,476 12,210 15 19,056 13,730 16 20,000/30,000 15,355 17 27,500/37,500 16,530 18 32,500/45,000 18,500 FIRST TWO grades on chart are the top salaries which government agencies may give for that grade.

A National Science Foundation study just released says that by 1970 demand for scien- tific and technical personnel will have doubled. NSF points out that scientific and engineering personnel must increase from 1,096,000 (in 1959) to about 2,032,000 in 1970 — an increase of about 85,000 per year. In addition, 21,000 new scientists and engineers will be needed annually to replace those who retire, die or move to other fields of work, bring the yearly total to 106,000. Of this, 81,000 new engineers will be needed each year — 64,000 to fill new positions and 17,000 to replace old ones. But in 1960, only 37,808 bachelor degrees and 7159 masters degrees in engineering were awarded. This year, enrollments of about 66,900 engineers are reported. But about half of each class does not make it — they flunk out, drop out, and an increasing number switch out. • Why the decrease? — A number of theories have been advanced to ac- count for the apparent drop-off of inter- est in engineering. First of all, there was a general economic recession causing defense cut- backs, which did not bode well for the hiring of engineers. This began in 1957 and undoubtedly affected enrollment of engineers in 1958 and '59. A great many people believe that the glamor of the physical sciences — physics, mathematics, chemistry, etc. — is attracting potential engineers. How- ever, although there has been some lit- tle increase in these fields, it does not account for the total drop in engineering. Another theory is that the students are steering away from engineering be- cause they fear the hard curriculum. As we continually are reminded, it is getting harder and harder to get into and stay in college at all, because of higher enrollments and keener compe- tition. Some educators believe that stu- dents shy away from engineering be- cause of the emphasis on the study of mathematics. A movement is under way to make the study of mathematics easier and more interesting. But this program must start from the early grades. Another belief is that many capable youngsters are barred from engineering or science because of low high school grades or low IQ test grades. In fact, however, some industrial psychologists say that there is no real evidence to sup- port the idea that grades or IQ's are measures of ability. A study at Hughes Aircraft Co. proved that there was no correlation between success in jobs and previous grades. • What is being done — The prob- lem is obviously to encourage more high school graduates, with low or high grades, to enter engineering. NASA sponsors mailouts and displays (through the National Education Association) on space achievements, to high school science classes in the hopes of attracting young people to this field. Scholarship programs are set up for promising youngsters. NASA has let a contract to find methods of identifying potential successful people, it also is looking for such a device to apply to high school level. Some colleges have tried to \"freshen up\" the somewhat dry engineering cur- riculum. Yale University gives a liberal arts course especially for its engineers. The California Institute of Technology sends its engineers to liberal arts schools for three years, then gives them two years of intensive engineering training. They hope this will make engineering (Continued on page 41) 12 missiles and rockets, January 1, 1962 SPECIAL REPORT NAVY RESEARCH DEEP-DIVING BATHYSCAPHE Trieste in an oceanographic test run dived to 37,800 ft., the bottom of the Marianas Trench. Navy Gives In-house Labs Major Role But industry may benefit from new redirection of R&D management; FY '63's RDT&E to top $1.3 billion by William Beller THE NAVY today is charting a new course for its nationwide complex of in-house laboratories. The goal: im- prove and streamline technical backup for weapon systems development. The shift could result in some real benefits to industry. For nearly four decades, in-house laboratories have acted as consultants to the Navy — taking on assignments ranging from finding the sonar signa- tures of shrimp to devising high-energy propellants. Now they are being given greater responsibility in the technical direction of new programs. This course is in line with a recent Defense Department directive designat- ing military laboratories as \"primary\" instruments in weapons development. For the Navy, it means a further down- grading of extra-military organizations on the technical direction level. The Navy is expected to ask for about $237 million for basic and ap- plied research in the Fiscal Year 1963 budget — a 13% increase over FY '62 and evidence of the bigger role granted the laboratories. Last year, the Navy also sought a 13% hike; it obtained 12%. Moreover, Dr. James H. Wakelin, Jr., assistant secretary of the Navy for research and development, is firmly committed to enhancing the service's traditionally strong in-house technical capability — a capability which dates back to 1908 with the opening of the Naval Engineering Experimental Station at Annapolis, Md. • Looking to industry — Wakelin, in an interview this week, predicts that the Navy's overall RDT&E budget for FY '63 will be a little higher than the $1.3 billion for FY '62. One-third of the RDT&E total goes to Navy in-house labs and Wakelin says this ratio is \"a good one.\" Thus, in the FY '63 budget, the labs probably will be funded at more than $400 million — including about $90 million for the Pacific Missile Range. (Generally, 10% of a laboratory's RDT&E money goes into contracted research. The one major exception is the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) where about 40% is earmarked for contractors.) Wakelin is particularly concerned today with expediting research projects through in-house labs and into indus- ALWAYS STRONG . . . the Navy's R&D Organization is tak- ing on new importance to industry.

Simulated flights for X-I5 pilots were made at this facil- ity. try. For example, he said, the ocean- ographic instrumentation program now has been blocked out and the specifica- tions written. Here is an opportunity for industry to move in on the ground floor, even though initial funding is small ($1.5 million in FY '62, $46 million programed for the decade). \"They should have the job,\" he said. \"We want them to take it. It's firm Navy policy.\" On major assignments, Wakelin said, the in-house labs will be doing more technical contracting and monitor- ing to speed R&D into hardware. • Decisions on the spot — He cited current experience in developing the Mark 46 torpedo under the technical direction of the Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS). Both the Navy and Aerojet-General Corp., the prime con- tractor, agree that sizable savings in time and money are expected to accrue as more technical decisions are made in their own backyard, without first being drawn through a Washington bureau. At the same time, the Washington bureaus retain policy and fiscal respon- sibility for all Navy contracts. On a dollar basis, only one-third of the RDT&E contracts are monitored by the bureaus, and the remaining two- thirds by in-house laboratories. \"We have to have very strong and improved in-house capabilities to understand cur- rent advances in the technical art, and to take advantage of them to cut down lead time,\" Wakelin reasoned. The Secretary aims to give signifi- cantly more money to the laboratories for in-house basic research — even if it means taking from other activities. Observing that the investment of rela- tively small amounts of money in un- directed work has paid generous div- idends, Wakelin advocates giving Navy scientists \"more freedom to do basic research, more money for pure think- ing.\" However, he contracted the scope of his recommendation by adding that scientists should do their thinking within the framework of the mission of the laboratory in which they're working. In the overall picture, Wakelin says, the prime object of the Navy's 1958 management changes in RDT&E — establishment of R&D on an Assistant Secretary's level, and merging two bureaus into the Bureau of Naval Weapons — is to bring the Assistant Secretary's Office and the working labo- ratories closer together. The Secretary said no new major missile projects will be started in FY '63, and he indicated that there are still enough major R&D problems to keep the service busy. \"Although we're much better off in ASW than five years ago, detection and classification (of Navy's RDT&E Budget for FY '62 (millions of dollars) Item Amount (est.) % of total Development $778 59 Test & Evaluaton 323 25 Applied research 142 11 Basic research 68 5 Total $1311 100 submarines) remain the big problems.\" He noted that the Navy has ASW leads that are showing some promise. • RDT&E flow diagram— The As- sistant Secretary of the Navy (Research and Development) is responsible for the Navy's RDT&E program, including the appropriation. Vice Adm. John T. Hayward, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Development), coordinates the opera- tional requirements for new weapons and equipment and issues them to the Navy bureaus. He also coordinates the overall Navy RDT&E program for the Chief of Naval Operations. The Navy's research program is co- ordinated by Rear Adm. L. D. Coates, Chief of Naval Research, who directs the Office of Naval Research. Both Admiral Hayward and Ad- miral Coates work very closely with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for R&D. Detailed execution of the RDT&E program belongs to the Navy's seven bureaus and offices, and the Marine Corps. A large part of the program is carried out \"in house\" by the Navy's laboratories and field activities. At the present time, these comprise 34 Navy- owned and operated activities and eight Navy-owned and contractor-oper- ated facilities. • Why in-house laboratories? — The in-house laboratories put the Navy's needs into a framework industry can use. This function goes far beyond rewording directives: it encompasses doing or monitoring the basic and ap- plied research needed to show that a 14 missiles and rockets, January 1, 1962 pertinent idea is feasible and practical — and then helping industry develop and use it. As an example, one segment of U.S. industry does about $16 million worth of business annually in the manufacture of a new family of high-temperature greases. The Navy holds the patents on these greases, through research done at NRL, but has granted royalty- free, non-exclusive manufacturing rights to qualifying companies. This is one of a number of in- stances supporting NRL's contention that \"we do not compete with industry.\" Dr. R. M. Page, the Laboratory's re- search director, maintains that \"We are actually one of the greatest sources of industrial wealth in this country in terms of people and research.\" He told M/R that NRL— largest of the Navy's laboratories — exists not only for the Navy but also for its contrac- tors. \"We will give free consulting serv- ice to anybody who has official need for it.\" • DOD for stronger labs — The Navy's move to strengthen its labo- ratories is backed by Defense. More is involved than fa- cilities, salaries and scientists' morale — important as they are. The laborato- ries' basic mission has been put into focus. \"(They) shall be used as a pri- mary means of car- these broad reasons for wanting strong in-house laboratories, there are some hard-headed Navy ones. —A private company may not have the facilities to do the job the service wants — and may be loath to get them because they're too expensive. When the Navy wanted very low drag and highly stable hydrodynamic shapes for an advanced family of nu- clear submarines, the only place the service could go for help was David Taylor Model Basin. This facility houses the \"instant ocean,\" latest in a series of major new hydrodynamic facilities developed in the wake of the nuclear submarine. Out of the Basin's work emerged the Albacore profile, which increased the maximum underwater speed of U.S. submarines so substantially that they are considered the fastest in the world today. —Sometimes industry won't handle a job for the Navy. \"From 1947 to 1950 we couldn't get industry to even look at our prob- WAKELIN Assis/anf Navy Secretary for R&D rying out Defense Department pro- grams,\" Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara instructed Harold Brown, Director of Defense Research and Engi- neering, last October. In view of their mission, the labora- tories perform three essential services for Defense. —They watch the advances made in the technical fields to see if any of the arising ideas can be used by the military. Moreover, they must let their technical problems be known to indus- try, which in turn may want to help solve them. —They must have competent men and facilities enabling them to supply Defense with objective help in solving technical and scientific problems; must have the ability to recommend what work is to be done by industry and be able to monitor it. —The laboratories must also act as schools to help train military officers in technical affairs. • Navy's reasons — In addition to HAYWARD Deputy Chief of Opera- tions (Development) lems,\" a highly placed bureau official told M/R. He complained about one giant research organization which \"wouldn't be bothered with the Navy because the concern had so much other work to do, and besides, was reorienting itself after World War II.\" —The program the Navy is prepar- ing may be so new that the service has to do some in-house studying even to liefine the problems involved. Admiral Coates points out that in 1 947 no one knew that the Navy would need a long-range ballistic missile pow- ered by solid chemical fuel. Neverthe- less, ONR started a broad research pro- gram to find a family of high-energy propellants with a wide range of physi- cal and chemical properties. Initial study showed that a self- combustible plastic was needed; and basic chemical knowledge developed after three years of research (in-house and contracted) resulted in the nitro- polymers. \"The advent of a practical Polaris missile today has come about because of (this) research started in 1947,\" says the Admiral. —Even though the facilities needed to solve some of the Navy's problems may be costly, industry might spend the money if some commercial return were foreseen, such as airplanes for the air- lines; unfortunately, however, many of the service's problems are uniquely military. The specialized facilities at NOTS helped enormously in developing the Sidewinder air-to-air missile. One of these facilities is an environmental test laboratory with a chamber able to simulate a climb to 50,000 feet in five minutes and a dive back to sea level in 33 seconds. The NOTS aeroballistics laboratory uses 23 pairs of precision cameras to record the flight of objects traveling at ultrasonic speeds. And the facility has a supersonic research track four miles long for captive flight-testing of missiles, rockets and some full-scale aircraft at speeds up to 3500 fps. The Naval Ra- diological Defense Laboratory is an- other example of the Navy's unique facilities. It is con- cerned only with studying the effects of radiation on men and material, and for this pur- pose has a two-mil- lion-electron-volt Van de Graff accel- erator as a primary source of experiments. The Navy's extensive program in oceanography continuously calls upon the specialized talents of many of its laboratories. The Navy Electronics Laboratory has been operating the deep- diving bathyscaphe Trieste. Last July, the craft was piloted down to 37,800 ft., to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. This submergence marked the first step into a new area of oceano- graphic research. • Almost $1 billion for oceano- graphy— To finance a major research effort, much of which will be handled and directed through in-house labora- tories, the Navy will be pressing to get over $900 million between now and 1970 in order to learn more about the ocean. One reason for the dimensions of this effort is clear: the Navy has the tough problem of finding enemy sub- (Continued on page 38) COATES Chief of Naval Research (heads ONR) missiles and rockets, January 1, 1962 L5 SPECIAL REPORT NAVY RESEARCH The Far-flung Navy Research Network THE NAVY'S RDT&E program is carried out by seven bureaus and offices, and by the Marine Corps.

The following list gives a sample of the pertinent prob- lems the Navy is seeking to answer both through its own efforts and those of potential contractors. Proposed solutions, supported by test data, should be submitted to the appropriate bureau for evaluation for possible additional study effort. The Navy says proposed solutions should demonstrate that an answer to a specific problem is at hand or that a worthwhile approach has been sufficiently explored to show a \"high probability of success.\" A fuller listing and description of the research problems the Bureau of Naval Weapons wants solved may be obtained from Chief, Bureau of Naval Weapons, Department of the Navy, Washington 25, D. C, attn: Code RREN-1; and ask for NAVWEPS Report 7682, Volume 1. There is also a secret version of the report which can be obtained with a need-to-know. More data on the research problems of the Bureau of Ships, Medicine and Surgery, Supplies and Accounts, and Yards and Docks, can be found in a copy of \"Navy Research and Development Problems,\" obtainable from the Chief of Naval Material, Department of the Navy, Washington 25, D.C., Attn: Code M42. MATERIALS PROBLEM (BuWeps): Develop O-rings and lubricants that are mutually compat- ible at high speeds and temperatures, or develop O-rings that do not require lubri- cation. Conditions of use are: a) Tempera- ture up to 2200 °F; b) Pressures up to 2000 psi; c) Rubbing speeds of 300 fps. BACKGROUND: Many lubricants in cur- rent use are composed largely or entirely of synthetic materials. While these syn- thetic lubricants provide satisfactory lu- brication and corrosion prevention, they have a deteriorating effect on rubber and synthetic materials. PROBLEM (BuWeps): Develop a hydrau- lic fluid with the following characteristics: a) Non-flammable; b) Adequate in lubricat- ing properties; c) Chemically stable at high temperatures; d) Chemically inert with re- spect to organic materials used for packing, seals, gaskets, and coatings; e) Non-toxic; f) Non-foaming; g) Possessing high vis- cosity index; h) Possessing low pour point; i) Possessing good heat transfer properties; j) Possessing low compressibility. BACKGROUND: The fluids specified by the Bureau of Naval Weapons for use in hydraulic power and control systems are currently of the petroleum-base type and contain additives to improve certain of their chemical and physical properties. For example, present hydraulic fluids contain inhibitors to protect metal parts from water, but these inhibitors are not efficient corrosion preventives for long-term storage and provide only temporary protection in drained systems where only a thin film of fluid remains. PROBLEM (BuWeps): Develop a method for coating very fine glass fibers with metal, in situ as the fibers are formed, with a high degree of adhesion between metal and glass. The metal thickness should be selective in the range 0.1 to 1 mil and the 18 usable metals should include at least alu- minum and nickel. BACKGROUND: There is ample evidence that microscopic surface imperfections in glass fibers are a major factor in their pre- mature failure. There is growing evidence that a tightly bonded thin metal film may minimize this deleterious effect. PROBLEM (BuWeps): Develop thermal protection techniques to extend the use of existing primary structural materials into a hypersonic environment during sustained flight. BACKGROUND: It is desirable to use aluminum, magnesium, and steel in air- frames of Mach 10 vehicles. This neces- sitates development of thermal protection techniques for these metals. PROBLEM (BuShips): Develop a tech- nique for welding titanium to other metals, in particular, steel. BACKGROUND: There is at present no known method for directly welding titan- ium to other metals. The use of an inter- mediate material has been suggested as a possible means to accomplish joining, but as yet no satisfactory material has been developed. PROBLEM (BuSanda): A non-combustible impermeable coating is required for fabric to protect handlers of liquid rocket fuels and oxidizers. BACKGROUND: Vinyl impregnated fiber glass fabrics offer inadequate protection. Modified butyl coatings give acceptable protection from penetration by corrosive liquids but support combustion. PROBLEM (BuWeps): Develop inexpen- sive materials that can be used as infrared transmission elements (windows). These materials must operate in adverse missile environments involving high temperature, rapid heating and cooling, and severe vibration. BACKGROUND: Development of infra- red detectors has outdistanced development of transmission elements. The only mate- rial currently available that is satisfactory is sapphire, which is very expensive. Sili- con is not suitable because it becomes opaque at temperatures incident to Mach 2 and 3 operations. PROBLEM (BuWeps): Develop a material that is highly reflective to the light spec- trum from infrared to ultraviolet, but transparent to radio frequency radiation. BACKGROUND: The material sought has a major application in the Navy's space mission. It would be used in the fabrica- tion of satellites. PROBLEM (BuShips): Develop a coating material which will reduce the frictional drag of underwater vehicles such as sub- marines. It must be suitable for applica- tion in a shipyard, be sufficiently rugged 1o withstand extensive exposure to marine environment, and provide corrosion pro- tection to the steel surfaces. BACKGROUND: A proprietary coating system to meet the above need is currently under evaluation, but it is questionable whether it can be employed effectively on large bodies. INSTRUMENTATION PROBLEM (BuShips): Develop a device or method for measuring the speed of a submerged submarine with respect to the ocean bottom. Extreme accuracy at very slow speeds (1 or 2 knots) is required. BACKGROUND: Methods are available that provide accurate indications of the speed of a vessel through the water. How- ever, the precise underwater navigation associated with missile launching opera- tions requires accurate ground speed in- formation. Investigations should be lim- (Continued on page 38) missiles and rockets, January 1, 1962 JANUARY, 1962 rrent status of U.S. missile and space programs plus all orbiting satellites Missiles and Rockets PROJECT CONTRACTORS DESCRIPTION STATUS FA (Navy) Navy, prime; Avco, air frame ASW surface-to-underwater; 500 lb. solid; conventional Deployed on destroyer escorts ROC (Navy) Minneapolis-Honeywell, prime; San- gamo Electric, sonar; torpedo, GE; depth charge, M-H; Librascope-General Precision, fire control Surface-to-underwater; solid rocket tor- pedo or depth charge; nuclear or con- ventional, range about 8 miles; ad- vanced ASROC (improved Mark 44 torpedo) under R&D Operational on Destroyers Norfolk, Adams, Dewey and Perry; plans call for deploying on 150 destroyers and cruisers TOR (Navy) Westinghouse, prime ASW underwater to underwater wire- guided torpedo; nuclear Operational VTLAS (Air Force) GD/Astronautics, prime; GE/Burroughs, Arma, guidance; Rocketdyne, propul- sion; GE/Avco, re-entry vehicle; Acous- tica, propellant utilization ICBM; more than 5500-to-7500 mile range; liquid; nuclear; ATLAS \"E\" series has inertial guidance; earlier ATLAS \"D\" has radio inertial; proposed.
