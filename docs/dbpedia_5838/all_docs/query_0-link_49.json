        "text": "Summary Here we present a synopsis of teaching responsible conduct of research (RCR) to trainees in biomedical sciences, summarize the origins of the still evolving definition of RCR and provide an introduction to the goals, content, and strategies for teaching RCR. These should be particularly useful for those contemplating changes in existing RCR courses or the creation of new ones.\n\nHuman bocavirus (HBoV) is divided into 4 genotypes: 1 to 4 with the HBoV-1 is the most commonly prevalent genotype. The current study intended to genetically analyze the full length genome of the HBoV-1 of recently detected Egyptian strains. Seven overlapping sets of primers were developed to amplify a nearly complete HBoV-1 genome from the clinical samples. The primer sets were tested on three recently identified Egyptian HBoV-1 strains with viral loads â‰¥105/ml. Sequencing was conducted using the same sets of primers. HBoV-1 virus strains were genetically analysed based on the sequences of their complete genomes and the individual open reading frames. The new sets of primers successfully amplified the three tested strains. Sequence analysis of the full-length genome of the HBoV-1 revealed a considerable level of genetic heterogenicity between different strains. Based on the full-genome and VP1 open reading frame, HBoV-1 viruses were clustered into three main lineages A to C and the...\n\nThis paper investigates the enhancement of the sensitivity and adsorption efficiency of a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensor that includes a layer of graphene sheet on top of the gold layer. For this purpose, biomolecular interactions of biotin-streptavidin with the graphene layer on the gold thin film are monitored. The performance of the LSPR graphene biosensor is theoretically and numerically assessed in terms of sensitivity and adsorption efficiency under varying conditions, including the thickness of biomolecule layer, number of graphene layers and operating wavelength. Enhanced sensitivity and improved adsorption efficiency are obtained for the LSPR graphene biosensor in comparison with its conventional counterpart. It is found that the LSPR graphene biosensor has better sensitivity with lower operating wavelength and larger number of graphene layers."
