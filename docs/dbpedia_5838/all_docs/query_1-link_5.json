        "text": "Historic California Posts, Camps, Stations and Airfields Point Arguello Radar Site B-30 (Lompoc Radar Site B-30) A World War II Army Air Forces aircraft warning station located on what is today Vandenberg AFB's Space Launch Complex 6\n\nUS Army Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District History\n\nThe former Point Arguello Radar Site B-30 is located 10 miles southwest of Lompoc in Santa Barbara County, California. The radar site is a restored Army Air Forces Aircraft Warning Service (AWS) facility. The site is now a part of Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB).\n\nWar Department interest was originally obtained by lease on 28.86 acres in 1941.\n\nThe property was leased from the Sudden Estate Company, which had some farm buildings on the site. The purpose of the site was to establish a secret long-range radar site along the Central California coast during World War II. The initial installation was an SCR-270B radar facility located just east of Red Roof Canyon and operated by the AWS. Some sources indicate that an SCR-271 series radar set may have also also operated at this site. The site was garrisoned by the 654th Signal Aircraft Warning Company and later the 659th Signal Aircraft Warning Company. Both units were under control of the Los Angeles Control Group.\n\nThe facility was used until the end of World War II and the two leases were terminated on 24 July 1947 and 15 June 1948. The site was reacquired by US Air Force in 1966, when the Sudden Ranch was purchased and incorporated into VAFB.\n\nA parking lot and part of the northwestern facilities of the Space Shuttle complex at Space Launch Complex 6 were built over the radar site in 1980. None of the former facilities have been in evidence during the last 30 years. The Army reportedly conducted a full restoration of the site following the radar station's deactivation after World War II.\n\nAdditional Online History\n\nCoast Guard Long Range Navigation Station, Point Arguello\n\nRadar Systems at the Port Aurgullo Radar Station:\n\nSCR-270 Mobile Long Wave Aircraft Warning Set\n\nDescription: Six-vehicle mobile, long wave early warning aircraft detector. Azimuth and range supplied. Set is equipped with \"A\" scope. Uses: To establish a screen of warning which provides information of approaching aircraft as early as possible but with a sacrifice of accuracy in range, azimuth and elevation. IFF equipment RC-150 is used. Performance and Siting: Maximum range on a single bomber flying at indicated heights, when set is on a flat sea level site:\n\nAltitude, feet 1000 5000 20,000 25,000 Range, miles 20 50 100 110\n\nSet should be sited at a height between 100' and 1000' above an unobstructed reflecting surface.\n\nTransportability: Complete set is carried in 6 vehicles, the largest of which measures 30'4\" x 9'10\" x 8'. Total weight of shipment is 101,790 lbs; total volume 11,485 cu. ft. Installation: Operates from trucks in which mounted. Can be placed in operation about 6 hours after arrival at site. Personnel: Seven men comprise operating crew. For 24 hour operation about 50 men are required to run radar, communication radio, and camp. Power: 15.3 KW, supplied by PE-74, 25 KVA gasoline-driven generator, having fixed consumption of 4 gal. per hour, non-leaded gasoline.\n\nSCR-271-D and SCR-271-E Fixed Long Wave Aircraft Warning Set\n\nDescription: Fixed long wave early warning aircraft detector. Azimuth and range supplied on \"A\" scopes. 271-D has a 100' tower; 271-E, a 50' tower. Uses: To establish a screen of warning which gives data on aircraft as early as possible, but with a sacrifice of accuracy in range, azimuth and elevation. IFF equipment RC-151 is used. Performance and Siting: Maximum range on a single medium bomber flying at indicated altitudes, when set is on a flat sea level site:\n\nAltitude, feet 1000 5000 20,000 25,000 SCR-271-E Range, miles 20 50 100 110 SCR-271-D Range, miles 25 60 120 135\n\nSets should be sited so that the mean antenna height is between 100 and 1000 ft. above an unobstructed flat surface. The 100' tower should be used when it is desired to get additional low coverage, or to insure clearance above surrounding trees or other obstructions.\n\nTransportability: Sets are packed in 106 units, weighing a total of 42,279 lbs. Largest unit is 176\" x 25\" x 20\". Total volume is 4008 cu. fit. Installation: Requires a weatherproof building approx. 20' x 40' for housing radar components and a building approx. 20' x 20' for housing the power units and switchboard. A 100 foot tower on concrete footings is required for an SCR-271-D and a 50-ft. tower for an SCR-271-3. Buildings and tower are built by engineers in about 3 weeks. Radar can be installed by five men in about two weeks. Personnel: 7 men are operating crew. For 24 hour operations, about 50 men are required for radar, communication radio, and camp. Power: 15.3 KW supplied by PE 74, 25 KVA gasoline-driven generator. Consumption is 4 gal. per hour, non-leaded standard commercial gas.\n\nSite Maps\n\nExtract, War Department Inventory of Owned, Sponsored and Leased Facilities, December 1945\n\nCapacity:\n\nEnlisted:\n\nPermanent: Mobilization (Quartermaster Corps 700-Series or Corps of Engineers 800-Series): Theater of Operations: 107 Hutments: Tents: Total: 107\n\nOfficers: 6 Station Hospital:\n\nAcreage\n\nOwned: Leases: 27 Total: 27\n\nStorage:\n\nCovered: Open:\n\nCost to Government Since 1 July 1940:\n\nLand: Construction: $43,090.00 Total: $43,090.00\n\nRemarks:\n\nSearch our Site!\n\nSearch the Web Search California Military History Online\n\nQuestions and comments concerning this site should be directed to the Webmaster"
