        "text": "Mission: Historical reports: Syncom I communications satellite was entering a highly elliptical-orbit when, about five hours after launch, its apogee-kick motor was fired for about 20 seconds in a maneuver designed to place the satellite into near-synchronous, 24-hour orbit, 35,900 km above the Earth. At about the time the apogee-kick motor completed burning, ground stations lost contact with the satellite and could not confirm a synchronous orbit. NASA officials assumed that the satellites spin axis was misaligned at the time of the apogee motor firing. Beatuse of this, they have been unable to determine whether the satellite is damaged.\n\nSyncom I was to have hovered at a nearly fixed longitude over the Atlantic Ocean and traced every 24 hours a figure-8 pattern approximately 30° north and 30° south of the equator; this path would be close enough to true synchronous orbit, stationary hovering at speed equal to that of Earths rotation to detemine if synchronous orbital communications satellites were feasible. Experiments with Syncom were to have included telephone and teletype communications transmitted between New Jersey and Lagos Harbor, Nigeria. Syncom was a NASA project, supported by DOD ground stations and communications experiment.\n\nLt. Col. Robert E. Warren, NASA Deputy Director of Communications Systems, reports that Goddard Space Flight Center had determined apogee of Syncoms elliptical transfer orbit would occur at 34,900 km altitude, about 950-km short of synchronous altitude, but well within allowable error. So that more nearly synchronous orbit could be achieved, signal was sent commanding satellites apogee motor to fire 10 minute earlier (at 5:42) than firing time set on onboard timer. Syncom received and stored signal, and 20.1 seconds later, ground reception of satellite telemetry abruptly ceased. Because apogee motor was to have fired for 21.2 sec., Colonel Warren said it was difficult to imagine that these two events are unrelated\n\nSo, what can we make of all this? First we know that Syncom is in orbit. If the apogee motor did not fire, it is still in the elliptical orbit and will eventually be found, either by optics or by radar. If the apogee motor did fire, Syncom is in a very high altitude orbit, and without telemetry, there is only a slim chance that it will be found... Secondly, we know that one of the communications transponders worked well in the transfer ellipse. Thirdly, we have shown once more that the Delta launch vehicle is a reliable booster, this being its 15th successive flight with performance well within amptable error.\n\nOn 28 February 1963, Harvard College Observatory reported that astronomers at Boyden Observatory at Bloemfontein, South Africa, had photographed Syncom I. The Observatorys photographs indicated the satellite probably was in orbit about 35,000 km high.\n\nOn 2 March 1963, Boyden Observatory had confirmed location of Syncom I: the satellite was tumbling end over end in its orbital path about 35,000 km high. The Observatory had just obtained two good plates showing images in the expected position. With this final confirmation, there is no doubt whatever of the location of the satellite. It behaved approximately as expected. Unfortunately, all attempts by USNS Kingsport to command the satellite to turn on its telemetry and communications equipment since March 1 had been unsuccessful. * * * * * Current overview: Syncom 1 was a 68-kg (fully fueled) communications satellite, the first designed for test in geosynchronous orbit. Mission objective was to put the satellite into a 24-hour orbit with an inclination of about 30 degrees over the Atlantic Ocean. The spacecraft employed an active repeater communication system designed to handle one two-way telephone or 16 one-way teletype channels. It was 71 cm diameter and 39 cm high cylinders. Its exterior was covered with 3,840 solar cells which provided 29 watts. Nickle-cadmium rechargeable batteries provided power when the spacecraft was in the Earth's shadow.\n\nAfter launch into a highly elliptical orbit, initial communication tests conducted from the USNS Kingsport off Nigeria were successful. About 5 hours after launch, the apogee motor was commanded to fire in order to place the satellite into a near-synchronous orbit. At about the time the motor completed its 20-second burn, all contact was lost. NASA assumed that the satellite's spin axis was misaligned at the time of the apogee motor firing. Attempts were made to communicate with the craft but contact was never re-established. The Boyden Observatory at Bloemfontein, South Africa, sighted Syncom 1 on 1 March 1963; its orbit was computed to be 34,186 km to 37,021 km with a period of 23 hours, 46.5 minutes. Mission: Historical reports: Lunik IV was a 1,422-kg planetayr probe launched into a 3½-day flight toward the Moon. Its mission was not disclosed. Following launch, TASS announcement said that all onboard equipment was functioning normally, that scientific stations in U.S.S.R. were tracking the probe and receiving scientific information from it. According to data which was already processed, the flight of the automatic station continues along a trajectory which is close to the calculated trajectory, reported the news agency.\n\nIn an article published a day after the launch in Izvestia, Soviet geologist Aleksandr Khabakov said that a soft landing on the Moon of a container with instruments and auxiliary apparatus seems to be technically feasible.\n\nOn 4 April, TASS announced Lunik IV would pass close to the Moons surface, indicating for the first time that the probe would not orbit or land. Speculation was that the probe might hawe hen planned to soft-land an instrument package on the Moon. TASS said radio communication with the spacecraft vias good and that onboard instruments were functioning normally.\n\nOn 5 April, as TASS reported, radio communications with the probe were good, arid telemetry data indicated onboard instruments and systems were functioning normally, Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of Jodrell Bank Experimental Station (radiotelescope facility), reported signals from Lunik IV ceased abruptly at 22:50 Moscow time. Lovell said there appeared to have been some complicated maneuvers with the probe. In Moscow, two scheduled lectures on Lunik IV flight were canceled by Moscow radio; a television discussion of history of lunar research made only passing reference to Lunik IV.\n\nOn 6 April, Lunik IV passed within 8,500 km of the Moon and TASS reported: The experiments and measurements which were conducted by means of the spacecraft are completed. Radio communication with the spacecraft will continue for a few more days. TASS still did not reveal nature of probes mission, but Sir Bernard Lovell believed the Soviets had failed in an attempt to land instruments on the Moon.\n\nIn 1964, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center established that Lunik IV was in a barycentric orbit -- i.e., orbiting around the center of gravity (4,600 km from Earths center) of the Earth-Moon system. This unusual orbit was apparently a coincidence, because final TASS announcement about the probe had said it would become a satellite of the Sun. * * * * * Current overview: This planetary probe was the third Soviet lunar soft-landing probe. This 1,422-kg Ye-6 carried an imaging system and a radiation detector. The spacecraft consisted of a cylindrical section containing maneuvering and landing rockets and fuel, orientation devices and radio transmitters, and a spherical top containing the 100-kg lander. The egg-shaped lander capsules was called the ALS and its mission was to send back photographs from the lunar surface. The lander would be ejected onto the surface after the main body touched down.\n\nThis third Soviet attempt to perform a lunar soft-landing was the first to left Earth orbit. During the coast to the Moon, its navigation system suffered a major failure (probably in its thermal control system) and left the probe in an incorrect attitude. As a result, Luna 4 was unable to perform its planned mid-course correction (but stay in communications). It passed by the Moon at a range of some 8,500 kilometers on 5 April at 13h25 UT and eventually entered into heliocentric orbit. The spacecraft transmitted at least until 7 April 1963. Mission: Historical reports: Telstar II communications satellite included design changes aimed at protecting it from radiation damage which affected lifetime of its predecessor, Telstar I. With apogee nearly twice that of Telstar I, it would provide longer periods of communications between U.S. and Western Europe than did Telstar I. Like its predecessor, Telstar II was designed and built by AT&Ts Bell Telephone Laboratories at AT&T expense, launched by NASA with AT&T reimbursing NASA for Delta vehicle, launching and tracking services. Initial communications test, TV transmission from Andover, Me., to Goonhilly Downs, England, via the satellits on its fourth orbit, was successful.\n\nOn 16 July 1963, Telstar II went dead during its 450th orbit, and subsequent efforts to reactivate the satellite by radio signal were not successful. Cause of Telstar IIs failure was not known, but AT&T said that telemetry data had given no indication that radiation damage has caused the satellite to fail.\n\nOn 12 August 1963, Telstar II resumed operating for first time since July 16. Satellite received and transmitted sound and television picture test. Cause of the satellites restoration, like its silence, was not known.\n\nFollowing the assassination of President Kennedy, on 22 November 1963, Telstar II brought live American television to the Soviet Union for the first time in the weekend of reporting on the assassination of President Kennedy and the mourning and funeral that followed.\n\nOn 7 May 1964, the first anniversary of Telstar II. AT&T reported the satellite was functioning normally in every respect and had completed 2,340 orbits of the Earth. Nearly 60 public demonstrations, most of them overseas TV transmissions, were conducted. Radiation data collected by Telstar II enabled scientists to determine that the very high intensity of electrons in inner region of the Van Allen belt had decayed slowly during the past year. Built with stronger shielding against radiation than its predecessor and equipped with specially-developed transistors to better withstand the space environment, Telstar II was orbiting in higher apogee than Telstar I, making possible communications experiments of greater length.\n\nOn 30 January 1965, funeral services for Sir Winston Churchill were televised live and by delayed transmission from London via Telstar II. Earlier in the week, pictures of Sir Winstons body lying in state in Westminster Hall had also been transmitted live via the satellite.\n\nOn 18 May 1965, Telstar II had successfully turned off its tracking beacon as scheduled, after two years and nine days of service and 4,736 orbits of the Earth. This would not affect the cornsats usefulness, but would conserve energy and permit other satellites to use the channel that was cut off. Telstar II was expected to remain usable for at least three more years. * * * * * Current overview: Telstar 2 was a 79-kg experimental communications satellite with two active repeaters. It also measure the energetic proton and electron distribution in the Van Allen belts. The spacecraft was essentially identical to Telstar I. On 16 May 1965, at 1403 UT, during the satellite's 4,736th orbit, its VHF transmitter was turned off. All systems operated normally until that time. Mission: Historical reports: On 22 January 1963, W. E. Morrow of MIT disclosed that USAF launched in 1962 six tin dipoles into orbit. The 36-cm dipoles were launched to measure effects of solar pressure, air drag, and electrical drag on small objects, so that scientists could predict how long Project West Ford copper dipoles would remain aloft. Morrow said the special tin dipoles were following their predicted orbit and were still orbiting the Earth.\n\nUSAF predicted Project West Fords 250 million copper dipoles to be placed in orbit would have a very short orbiting life, a prediction based on results of six-needle orbital experiment conducted in 1962. The six needles were not affectsd by space electricity, which had been feared would cause needles to shift from their initial orbit and then solar pressure would keep the dipoles in orbit for years.\n\nOn 9 may 1963, USAF announced it would attempt second Project West Ford orbiting belt of 400 million copper filaments in the near future. First such attempt, on 21 October 1961, was unsuccessful because container failed to eject the needles. MIT Lincoln Laboratory, conducting experiment for USAF, said in fact sheet that no other communication method suggested to date, by satellite or otherwise, offers comparable reliability, in terms of global coverage with virtually complete invulnerability to destruction or jamming \n\nThe 23-kg Project West Ford satellite was to place a ring of metal fibers in a belt around the Earth for passive communications experiments. The experiments were successful and effect of 400 million copper filament belt on radioastronomy was found to be negligible. Natural decay of belt expected as planned.\n\nOn 12 May 1963, radar contact with cupper dipoles confirmed they were successfully ejected into orbit, MIT Lincoln Laborstory announced. Fibers were still in compact cloud circling Earth every 166 min. in near-polar orbit, some 3,000 km high and at approximately 87° to equator. On May 13, dipoles had begun to spread in elongated cloud. Fibers were expected to spread along circular orbital path, some 65,000 km in circumference, to form ring around Earth. Orbital ring would be used in bouncing radio signals back to Earth over long distances.\n\nOn 24 May 1963, USAF announced all radio experiments conducted with Project West Ford needles were successful. tests included coast-to-coast radio tests in which signals were bounced off 3,000 km-high cloud. Needles were now stretched over 18,000 km section of polar orbit, lengthening at rate of 1,500 km per day. Scientists expected in six weeks, cloud would lengthen to form closed path about 6,500 km in circumference.\n\nOn 26 March 1964, Space Science Board of National Academy of Sciences concluded that Project West Ford dipoles placed in orbit last year had not interfered with either optical or radioastronomy observations. Board Chairman Dr. H. H. Hess said in report that the boards conclusion should not be taken either as an endorsement of the experiment or as tacit agreement to the launching of another similar belt without further discussion. * * * * * Current overview: The West Ford Needles project was an experiment to allow long-distance communications by bouncing radio waves off of a band small wires (passive dipoles) In an attempt to lay a radio-reflective ring around the world. The West Ford reflector consisted of 480 million copper dipoles, each dipole was 1.78 cm long and had a diameter of 17.8 µm. The dispenser plus dipoles weighted 40 kg, the mass of the dipoles was 19.5 kg. Two experiments were conducted, one in 1961 and another in 1963; the second experiment was successful. The experiment was greatly criticized by astronomers who feared optical and radio pollution. However the needles apparently didn't work as a radio reflector and the feared and desired effects did not come to pass. Mission: Historical reports: Mercury-Atlas 9 (MA-9) carried astronaut Leroy Gordon Cooper (Maj., USAF) into Faith 7 capsule during U.S. longest manned space flight to date. Besides participation in flight procedures, astronaut ate, slept, and conducted scientific experiments. Because automatic control system (ACS) failed during the 19th orbit, spacecraft was oriented manually during the 22nd orbit, retrorockets were fired manually and re-entry phase was conducted without ACS. Faith 7 landed after 22 orbits three kilometers from U.S.S. Kearaarge near Midway Island in Pacific.\n\nValue of trained pilots presence in spacecraft was underscored by successful mission achievement despite ACS failure. MA-9 provided biomedical data confirming man can survive and function during prolonged space flight with no ill effects.\n\nExperiments during flight included: ejecting from spacecraft in third orbit a 4.5 kg flashing-beacon sphere (testing visibility of objects in space in preparation for future rendezvous maneuvers), which Cooper sighted during fifth and sixth orbits; photographs of zodiacal light nighttime airglow layer; horizon definition experiment, using colored filters in 70-mm camera; radiation measurement experiment, using Geiger counters mounted on spacecraft exterior and detectors inside spacecraft and inside astronauts space suit; tethered balloon experiment (to measure atmospheric drag) which Cooper attempted in sixth orbit but balloon did not deploy; infrared photography for meteorological purposes; television photography, which achieved historic first in U.S. manned space flight with direct transmission of TV pictures to tracking stations; cabin environmental temperature study, with cabin coolant valve and fan turned off from orbit #5 until about two hours before re-entry, astronaut relying on space suit for cooling while cabin temperature stabilized at around 36° C; HF antenna tests involving transmissions with antenna horizontally polarized and vertically polarized; ground light experiment, with astronaut observing three-million-candle power xenon light at Bloemfontein, Republic of South Africa; window attenuation experiment, with astronaut viewing calibrated standard light source and stars to evaluate transmission of light through spacecraft window; and white paint patch measurements, investigating changes in paint pigments during re-entry heating.\n\nDuring its 22-orbit flight, MA-9 covered estimated 955,560 km in 34 hrs. 20 min. Nearly 36 years before, Charles Lindberghs historic flight from New York to Paris covered 5,800 km in 33 hrs. 30 min.\n\nOn 29 May 1963, NASA announced problems with two connectors to electrical amplifier in the Mercury spacecraft had caused loss of automatic control system during MA-9 space flight, forcing Cooper to re-enter from orbit with manual control. Premature lighting of .05 g panel light during 19th orbit had indicated that automatic contro system would be inoperative until spacecraft descended to point of feeling .05 g. Then, in final orbit, trouble in inverter caused loss of automatic control system altogether. Post-flight examination of Faith 7 circuitry traced.05 g signal and inverter failure to independent electrical connectors that failed to function due to moisture; in bath cases, electrical insulation of the connectors broke down. Correction of problems for future spacecraft would include tighter control of moisture and increase of insulation of electrical components. * * * * * Current overview: Mercury Atlas 9 was the fourth and final manned orbital flight of the Mercury program. The pilot was L. Gordon Cooper, Jr. (His backup was Alan Shepard.) The capsule weight1,376 kg, Mission objectives were: evaluate the effects on the astronaut for approximately one day in orbital; verify that man can function for an extended period in space, and evaluate in a manned one-day mission the combined performance of the astronaut and a Mercury spacecraft specifically modified for the mission.\n\nOriginally scheduled for April, the mission was delayed twice. The first delay, in February, was due to a decision to rewire the Mercury-Atlas flight control system. The second, on 14 May, occurred on the scheduled day of launch when a problem developed with the fuel pump in the diesel engine used to retract the gantry from the launch vehicle. This resulted in a delay of roughly 129 minutes after countdown had already reached T-60 minutes. Subsequent to the repairs on the gantry engine, however, a separate problem - the failure of a computer converter at the Bermuda tracking station - forced the cancellation of the launch at T-13 minutes. The launch was rescheduled for the following day (May 15). The countdown then proceeded without a hitch until T-11 minutes and 30 seconds when a problem developed in the guidance equipment and a brief hold was called until it was resolved. Another hold was called at the T-19 second mark to ascertain whether the systems had gone into automatic sequencing as planned. The liftoff ended up being excellent, with the spacecraft being inserted into orbit at a velocity described as being \"almost unbelievably correct\".\n\nA number of in-flight experiments were planned for and carried out during the MA-9 flight. They included two visual acquisition and perception studies, several photographic studies, two radiation packages, a tethered balloon experiment, a study of the behavior of fluids in zero gravity, and a micrometeorite study. A flashing beacon was deployed on the third orbit and Cooper reported that he was able to see it on the night side of the fourth orbit. Attempts were also made to deploy the balloon, both of which failed. On the seventeenth orbit, Cooper photographed the zodiacal light. He also became the first American to sleep in orbit. During the planned sleep period Cooper's suit temperature rose and he roused, reset the temperature control, and resumed his rest.\n\nThe first malfunction of concern on MA-9 occurred during the nineteenth orbit when the 0.05-g light came on. The light, sensitive to changes in gravity, normally lit during reentry. The pilot proceeded to check out the necessary attitude information and all telemetry indicated the spacecraft was in the correct orbit. It was therefore concluded that the light was erroneous. However, because of this, it was determined that the potential existed that not all of the automatic system for reentry would function. The pilot was advised to use the manual mode for reentry, becoming the first astronaut to use this method exclusively.\n\nThe capsule reentered under the manual control of the pilot after completing 22 orbits, landing about 130 km southeast of Midway Island in the Pacific Ocean, about 6.4 km from the prime recovery ship, USS Kearsarge. The duration of the flight was 34 hours 19 minutes and 49 seconds during which Cooper travelled nearly 875,000 km. Mission: Historical reports: Vostok V, with Lt. Col. Valery F. Bykovsky onboard. completed 81 Earth orbits, in a record flight of 4 days, 23 hours and 6 minutes. TASS stated objectives of flight were: to continue studies of influence of various factors of space flight on human organism; to conduct extensive biomedical research of conditions of prolonged space flight; and to make further improvements and adjustments in piloting of spacecraft. During his five-day flight, Bykovsky conducted fixed biological experiments, killing specimens to stop their development at various intervals. Cosmonaut Bykovsky landed by parachute in Republic of Kazakhstan, shortly after landing of Cosmonaut Valentina V. Tereshkova and Vostok VI.\n\nIn 1964, Soviet scientists P. M. Bayevsky and K. I. Zhukov reported that both Vostok 5 and Vostok 6 cosmonauts had suffered a rhythm instability in their heartbeats while in space. The condition, cardiac arrhythmia, was observed in both Valery Bykovsky, who spent five days aloft, and Valentina Tereshkova, who orbited the globe for 71 hrs. Changes were attributed to normal reactions to weightlessness, but the doctors warned that the condition should be watched closely on future iung-duration flights since it could be a clue to more serious pathologic changes, including a possibly fatal heart attack. Dr. W. Randolph Lovelace, NASA Director of Space Medicine, saw the electrocardiograms while in Russia and said they showed only variations wed expect. NASA doctors agreed that cardiac arrhythmia should be watched as a potential danger signal but said they had seen nothing dangerous so far in U.S. astronauts heart rhythm changes. * * * * * Current overview: Vostok 5 was a 4,720-kg piloted spaceship, the fifth in the USSR manned program. It was piloted by Valeriy Bykovskiy. (Backup crewmembers were Boris Volynov and Alexei Leonov.) Two days later, Vostok 6 was launched with Valentina Tereshkova onboard. On its first orbit, this spaceship came within about five kilometres of Vostok 5, the closest distance achieved during the flight, and established radio contact. Television coverage of Bykovsky was viewed in the West, but only a black and white film camera was carried. A series of biomedical and scientific experiments were conducted, including a photometric measurements of the Earth's horizon.\n\nVostok 5 was originally planned to go for a record eight days. The launch was delayed repeatedly due to high solar activity and technical problems. Finally, the spacecraft ended up in a lower-than-planned orbit. Combined with increased atmospheric activity due to solar levels, Vostok 5 quickly decayed and temperatures in the service module reached very high levels. Bykovsky also experienced an unspecified problem with his waste management system (a spill?) which made conditions in the cabin very uncomfortable. He was finally ordered to return after five days in space. To top it all off, the Vostok service module failed to separate cleanly from the reentry capsule. Wild gyrations ensued until the heat of reentry burned through the retraining strap. However, Vostok 5 completed 81 orbits before landing successfully northwest of Karaganda, setting a World duration record of 119 hours and 6 minutes. Mission: Historical reports: Flight of Vostok VI with Lt. Valentina V. Tereshkova, first woman in space, conducted by U.S.S.R. Vostok VI completed 48 Earth orbits in 2 days, 22 hours and 50 minutes. Shortly after entering orbit, TASS reported Lt. Tereshkova estblished radio communications with Lt. Col. Bykovsky in Vostok V; the two cosmonauts then radioed joint message to Premier Khrushchev. TASS stated flight of Vostok VI was being made to continue the study of the effect of various spaceflight factors on the human organism, including a comparative analysis of the impact of these factors on the organism of a man and a woman; to carry out new mdical-biologcal research and to further improve and perfect the systems of piloted spaceships in conditions of simultaneous flight.\n\nDuring initial orbit, Vostok V and VI came within about five km of each other, apparently closest distance achieved. Cosmonaut Tereskkova, whom TASS described as having never piloted an aircraft, landed by parachute in Kazakhstan. After she and cosmonaut Bykovsky landed, TASS issued statement on flight results: New valuable data have been obtained about the influence of different factors of a space flight of long duration on the organisms of man and woman. Rich factual material necessary for further perfection of the systems of piloted space ships has been obtained.\n\nIn 1964, Soviet scientists P. M. Bayevsky and K. I. Zhukov reported that both Vostok 5 and Vostok 6 cosmonauts had suffered a rhythm instability in their heartbeats while in space. The condition, cardiac arrhythmia, was observed in both Valery Bykovsky, who spent five days aloft, and Valentina Tereshkova, who orbited the globe for 71 hrs. Changes were attributed to normal reactions to weightlessness, but the doctors warned that the condition should be watched closely on future iung-duration flights since it could be a clue to more serious pathologic changes, including a possibly fatal heart attack. Dr. W. Randolph Lovelace, NASA Director of Space Medicine, saw the electrocardiograms while in Russia and said they showed only variations wed expect. NASA doctors agreed that cardiac arrhythmia should be watched as a potential danger signal but said they had seen nothing dangerous so far in U.S. astronauts heart rhythm changes. * * * * * Current overview: Vostok 6 was a 4,713kg piloted spaceship which carried the first woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova, call sign Chayka (Seagul); her backups were Solovyova and Ponomaryova). The spaceship was the 6th and last of the Vostok program. On its first orbit, Vostok 6 came within about five km of Vostok 5, the closest distance achieved during the flight, and established radio contact. TV pictures of the cosmonauts in their cabins were relayed to Earth. A series of biomedical and scientific experiments were conducted. But Sergei Korolev was unhappy with Tereshkova's performance in orbit and she was not permitted to take manual control of the spacecraft as had been planned. After completing 48 orbits in 70.7 hr, the craft landed on 19 June 1963, northeast of Karaganda. (Terechkova was the only Russian woman to go into space until Svetlana Savitskaya 19 years later.) Mission: Historical reports: Syncom II provide telephone, teletype and photo facsimile communications between Lakehurst, N.J., and Lagos Harbor, Nigeria. Following its launch, it ajusted its altitude and speed to near-synchronous (at 10,940 km/hr) to to drift eastward at rate of 7.5° per day. Ground signals would attempt to reverse drifting so that satellite would attain synchronous position over Brazil. Communications tests duning Syncom IIs ascent into orbit were successful, including reception and transmission of The Star Spangled Banner, a voice message, and a teletype transmission.\n\nSyncom II stopped when it reached desired position at 55° west longitude. At this location, it was lowered into precise synchronous orbit, so that it appears to trace elongated figure-8 pattern along 55° meridian to points 33° north and south of the equator.\n\nOn 15 August 1963, Syncom II was successfully maneuvered into synchronous position 55° west longitude, over Brazil and South Atlantic Ocean. The satellite was now stationed about 35,880 km altitude and traveling at speed of about 10,950 km/h, matching Earths rotation speed of 1,675 km/h at equator to keep it on station. It was hovering in figure-8 pattern 33° north and south of equator. NASA Administrator James E. Webb called completion of the positioning maneuvers the culmination of one of the outstanding feats in the history of space flight.\n\nOn 23 August 1963, Syncom II relayed its first live telephone conversations, a transmission between President Kennedy and Nigerian Prime Minister, and other messages between U.S., Nigerian, and U.N. officials.\n\nOn 28 August 1963, it was announced that Syncom II had accumulated more message time than all other communications satellites combined.\n\nOn 13 September 1963, Syncom II and Relay I linked Rio de Janeiro and Lagos, Nigeria, in 20-minute voice conversation, first operation employmg both communications satellites in single communications circuit and worlds first three-continent telephone conversation. Signal began from USNS Kingsport in Lagos harbor, then to Syncom II, which sent it to Lakehurst, N.J., ground station, then by overland wire to Nutley, N.J., ground station, then to Relay 1 overhead which sent it to Rio de Janeiro ground station. The conversations quality of transmission was declared to be good.\n\nOn 17 March 1964, Syncom II began to drift westward at rate of about 1.3° per day, in order to reach vicinity of the International Date Line in mid-May. There, the satelliteI would serve as backup for Syncom III, sheduled for synchronous orbit over the Pacific in May and transpacific communications experiments during the summer.\n\nOn 23 April 1964, NASA and NBC conducted one-hour test of the Syncom II, testing the satellites capability to relay video coverage from Tokyos Olympic Games next fall. In the test, signals were transmitted from an antenna at Fort Dix, N.J.; signals returned from the satellite were received at Andover, Me., and relayed to NBC studios by land lines. Quality of the pictures was considered below standard commercial quality but adequate for brief broadcasts of select events. NBC, which had purchased exclusive rights to TV coverage of the 1964 Summer Olympics in the U.S. and Central and South America, would now decide whether to attempt live coverage with satellites or to rely on tapes.\n\nAfter DOD installed small ground station in Saigon, military communications experiments using Syncom II began between Saigon and Hawaii. Limited experiments also were made with Syncom III, which was in a position to relay messages from Saigon to Camp Roberts, Calif. Syncom II was being used on a virtually 24-hour basis. DOD had been experimenting with Syncom II for months-before installation of Saigon station, when Syncom II relayed messages between Manila and points in the U.S., and even [earlier, when the satellite relayed military communications over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn 1st January 1965, operation of Syncom II and Syncom III communications satellites was transferred to DOD by NASA, which had completed its R&D experiments. Telemetry and command stations and range and rangerate equipment operated by NASA for the Syncom program would be transferred to DOD along with the satellites. DOD had furnished the communications ground stations used to relay transmissions via the two Syncoms for the past two years and would provide NASA with certain telemetry and ranging data of continuing scientific and engineering interest. Syncom III was to prove useful in DODs Vietnam communications.\n\nOn 19 February 1965, Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, reports: Having completed our experiments with Syncoms II and Syncoms III, we are turning them over to the Department of Defense If required, full-time communications could be provided between the United States and southeast Asia by Syncom III \n\nOn 3 March 1965, NASA had halted Syncom IIs westward drift at 68° East longitude over the Indian Ocean. This move was made at DODs request. No future major locational corrections were anticipated; Syncom II should remain in same general area indefinitely.\n\nTransfer of control of Syncom II and Syncom III from NASA to DOD was completed on 8 July 1965, under direction of the Defense Communications Agency. Syncom II would be maintained at a position between 60° and 80° east longitude; Syncom III would be positioned between 170° and 174° east longitude. NASA would continue to receive reports on the telemetry from the two satellites from DOD and would continuously evaluate their performance in space. * * * * * Current overview: Syncom 2 was a 68kg (fully fueled) experimental communications satellite placed over the Atlantic Ocean and Brazil at 55° longitude. It employed a redundant, active repeater communication system designed to handle one two-way telephone or 16 one-way teletype channels. Syncom 2 was the first successful geosynchronous satellite. Although the period was 24 hours and the spacecraft remained at a nearly constant longitude, its orbit was inclined at 33°, so the craft moved in an elongated figure eight pattern 33° north and south of the equator.\n\nThe spacecraft was a cylinder measuring 71 cm in diameter and 39 cm high. Its exterior was covered with 3,840 silicon solar cells which provided direct power of 29 watts. Nickle-cadmium rechargeable batteries provided power when the spacecraft was in the Earth's shadow.\n\nSyncom II began regular service on 16 August 1963. It demonstrated the feasibility of geosynchronous satellite communications. Voice, teletype, facsimile, and data transmission tests were successfully conducted between the Lakehurst, New Jersey ground station and the USNS Kingsport, while the ship was at sea off the coast of Africa and television transmissions were relayed from Lakehurst to the telstar ground station at Andover, Maine. Operations were turned over to the Department of Defense on 1 January 1965. Mission: Historical reports: Twin Vela Hotel satellites, designed to detect nuclear explosions m space to a distance of 150 million km, were launched, according to newspaper reports. First, the two crafts were placed mto an elliptical orbit. Some 18 hours after launch, one received a signal which activated a rocket motor at apogee to kick the satellite into circular orbit. On Oct. 19, the same was done for the second satellite, so that both would orbit at 92,000 km but always be on opposite sides of the Earth.\n\nTwo months after their launch, performance of the two nuclear-test detection satellites has been excellent in all respects, DOD announced. The two satellites were performing almost perfectly and their reliability has been excellent. DOD anticipated the satellites would provide data on background radiation and other measurements in space for useful lifetime of more than six months. Success of this initial detection effort has moved the research program forward by more than one year, DOD said.\n\nIt was reported on 27 April 1964 that the complete success of Project Vela high-altitude nuclear-detection satellites led DODs Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to expand and revise the project. Future launchings had been rescheduled farther apart so that sabsequent satellites could incorporate any major improvements between launchings, according to ARPA Director Dr. R. L. Sproull. * * * * * Current overview: Vela 1A was a 125-kg (or 150 or 220 kg) nuclear-explosion monitoring satellite designed to monitor worldwide compliance with the 1963 nuclear test ban treaty. The Vela were launched in pairs; Vela 1A and 1B were the first in a series of six Vela launches. They operated in a circular orbit at about 17 Earth radii and were spaced 180° apart. They also studied x-rays, gamma-rays, neutrons and charged particles. The spacecraft were spin stabilized at 120 rpm. 20-sided polyhedrons with body mounted solar cells generating 90 Watts. Their payload consisted of twelve external X-ray detectors and 18 internal neutron and gamma-ray detectors. The satellites were so successful, each operating for at least five years, that a planned acquisition of a fourth and fifth pairs was cancelled.

Mission: Historical reports: Polet I (Flight I) was announced as a new type of maneuverable spacecraft for use in manned orbital rendezvous flight. After what were described as repeated changes in altitude and inclination, the spacecraft on 2 November attained final orbit. Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced the launching of Polet I:  the present spaceship is really new. While the previous ships placed into orbit made flights mainly in the direction imparted to them when they were launched from Earth, the spacecraft that was lofted today is making wide maneuvers in space, varying the orbital plane and altitude. U.S. space experts likened Polet I to the U.S. Gemini spacecraft, scheduled to make its first unmanned flight in late 1963 or early 1964.\n\nSpace expert Vladimir Dobronravov said that the spacecraft would be used for rendezvous and docking experiments. TASS mentioned the potential for reconnaissance, weather, or communications satellite. M. Litvin-Sedoi said it was a test of a system for construction of an orbiting space platform. Premier Khrushchev sait that Polet I had made space rendezvous possible but that no definite date had been set for such an experiment.\n\nAcademician Mstislav V. Keldysh, president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said: Maneuverable spacecraft will permit us to execute a landing from any orbit to a given kosmodrom; carry out a meeting in space of ships which are flying in different orbits; and also allow astronauts to select the most advantageous landing area. The ability of a ship to maneuver will make it possible for us to create heavy orbital scientific research stations in space so that we can exchange crews, replace scientific equipment and maintain a continuous supply of all that is necessary \n\nU.S. tracking data on Polet I maneuverable spacecraft substantiated the Russian claim of change in apogee but indicated that any substantial change in plane had to be made before completion of the first orbit. According to Aviation Week, NORAD's initial orbital plane for the Russian satellite was 59.99\", later revised to 58.89\". Whether this 1.1° change was a result of a satellite maneuver or was merely a refinement of earlier data is uncertain. * * * * * Current overview: Polyot 1, or Polet 1, was a 1,400-kg (or 600-kg) technological satellite, the first of two spacecraft fitted with special controls to allow for maneuverability in space. It was thus able to change inclination as well as apogee and perigee. This mission also could be considered an early test flight of anti-satellite interceptors. Officially, Polyot purpose was the elaboration of system providing for the extensive manoeuvring of space apparatuses. This flight was considered a great success, since Polyot micro-engine fired 350 times and main stabilizing engine fired 300 times. Mission: Historical reports: Explorer XVIII, the Interplanetery Monitoring Probe (IMP), is essentialy a continuation of the series of energetic particle spacecraft and similar in design and in some experiments to the earlier Explorer XII, Explorer XIV, and Explorer XV. Onboard instrumentation includes two magnetometers, three plasma probes, and five sets of low and medium energy particle detectors. Its 16-kg of instruments would measure the major magnetic field phenomena in space, including the interplanetary magnetic field, interactions of the streaming solar plasma and the geomagnetic field, galactic and solar radiation.\n\nIMP data revealed a shock wave existed 86,250 km above Earths sunlit surface, formed by interaction of interplanetary magnetic field and high-speed constant wind of particles from the Sun. Between shock wave and upper edge of Van Allen belts, a region ranging in depth from 20 000 to 32,000 km, there is great turbulence; moderately energetic particles constantly flow into the region and drain away.\n\nOn 7 May 1964, Explorer XVII survived sub-zero temperatures during eight-hour flight in the Earths shadow, a duration record for satellites. It remained in the shadow for so long because of its highly eccentric orbit, carrying it out 196,000 km at apogee. As it entered the shadow, the craft shut off automatically, and temperatures on its surface fell to more than 400° below zero. After it emerged once again, its transmitter signal was picked up by NASA tracking station at Santiago, Chile.\n\nOn 17 September 1964, Explorer XVIII, silent since last June because of low power levels, resumed data transmission; it had reached a more favorable sun angle and was able to operate on power directly from its four solar panels. Data received from the satellite, based on preliminary analysis, were described as good.\n\nOn 15 December 1964, Dr. Norman F. Ness likened the Earth to a kind of comet with a long magnetic tail that extended for an unknown distance. The new look was drawn from results of the first detailed mapping of the Earths magnetic field on the night-time side of the magnetosphere by Explorer XVII. Until recently, scientists had believed that the Earths magnetosphere was basically spherical. However, data from Explorer XVIII indicate that countless magnetic lines of force stretched out like the tail of a comet to an unknown distance in space, apparently beyond the Moon. Within this comet-like tail, the lines of force in the Northern Hemisphere were directed towards the Sun; in the Southern Hemisphere, away from the Sun. In between, there was a neutral zone. Dr. Ness characterized this neutral zone, which had been hypothesized but never before detected, as a thin sheet which was a permanent part of the Earths environment and virtually void of any magnetic activity. Though the neutral zones exact role was unknown, Dr. Ness speculated that it might be responsible for formation of the auroras and creation of the Van Allen radiation belt. Ness concluded that, in view of the evidence from Explorer XVIII, The only difference between the earth and a comet is that the earth possesses a strong magnetic field and comets do not. * * * * * Current overview: Explorer 18 was a 138-kg (or 62 kg) Earth/space sciences satellite instrumented for interplanetary and distant studies of energetic particles, cosmic rays, magnetic fields and plasmas. It was the first of three Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP). It performed normally until 30 May 1964, then intermittently until 10 May 1965, when it was abandoned."
