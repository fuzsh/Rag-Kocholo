[[Page 5452]] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Purpose and Need for Regulatory Action This proposed rule, if promulgated, would establish a framework under the authority of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) for NMFS to authorize the take of marine mammals incidental to space vehicle (rocket) launches, missile launches, and aircraft operations at VSFB. We received an application from the USSF requesting 5-year regulations and an associated letter of authorization to incidentally take marine mammals. Take is expected to occur by Level B harassment incidental to launch noise and sonic booms. Please see ``Background'' below for definitions of harassment. Legal Authority for the Proposed Action The MMPA prohibits the ``take'' of marine mammals, with certain exceptions. Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) generally direct the Secretary of Commerce (as delegated to NMFS) to allow, upon request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region if certain findings are made, regulations are promulgated (when applicable), and public notice and an opportunity for public comment are provided. Authorization for incidental takings shall be granted if NMFS finds that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for taking for subsistence uses (where relevant). If such findings are made, NMFS must prescribe the permissible methods of taking; ``other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact'' on the affected species or stocks and their habitat, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and on the availability of the species or stocks for taking for certain subsistence uses (referred to as ``mitigation''); and requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such takings. Section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA and the implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 216, subpart I provide the legal basis for proposing and, if appropriate, issuing regulations and an associated letters of authorization, or LOA(s). This proposed rule describes permissible methods of taking and mitigation, monitoring, and reporting requirements for USSF's proposed activities. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (2004 NDAA, Pub. L. 108-136) amended the MMPA to remove the ``small numbers'' and ``specified geographical region'' limitations indicated above and amended the definition of ``harassment'' as applied to a ``military readiness activity.'' Missile launches conducted at VSFB, which comprise a small portion of the activities, are considered military readiness activities pursuant to the MMPA, as amended by the 2004 NDAA. A subset of the activities described here and for which incidental take of marine mammals is being requested (specifically, missile launches) qualifies as a military readiness activity. Summary of Major Provisions Within the Rule Following is a summary of the major provisions of the regulations regarding USSF rocket and missile launches and supporting activities. These measures include: Scheduling launches to avoid lowest tides during harbor seal and California sea lion pupping seasons, when practicable; Required flight paths for aircraft takeoffs and landings and minimum altitude requirements to reduce disturbance to haul out areas; Required minimum altitudes for unscrewed aerial systems (UAS); Required acoustic and biological monitoring during a subset of launches to record the presence of marine mammals and document marine mammal responses to the launches; and Required semi-monthly surveys of marine mammal haulouts at VSFB and NCI. National Environmental Policy Act To comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 216-6A, NMFS must evaluate our proposed action (i.e., the promulgation of regulations and subsequent issuance of incidental take authorization) and alternatives with respect to potential impacts on the human environment. This action is consistent with categories of activities identified in Categorical Exclusion B4 of the Companion Manual for NAO 216-6A, which do not individually or cumulatively have the potential for significant impacts on the quality of the human environment and for which we have not identified any extraordinary circumstances that would preclude this categorical exclusion. Accordingly, NMFS has preliminarily determined that the proposed action qualifies to be categorically excluded from further National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. Information in the USSF application and this notice collectively provide the environmental information related to proposed issuance of these regulations and subsequent incidental take authorization for public review and comment. We will review all comments submitted in response to this notice prior to concluding our NEPA process or making a final decision on the request for incidental take authorization. Summary of Request On November 2, 2022, NMFS received a request from USSF requesting authorization for the take of marine mammals incidental to rocket and missile launch activities and aircraft operations at VSFB in Vandenberg, California. Following NMFS' review of the materials provided, USSF submitted a revised application on May 25, 2023. The application was deemed adequate and complete on May 26, 2023. USSF's request for authorization pertains to incidental take of 6 species of marine mammals, by Level B harassment only. On June 15, 2023, we published a notice of receipt of the USSF's application in the Federal Register (88 FR 39231), requesting comments and information related to the USSF request for 30 days. We received no responsive comments. The take of marine mammals incidental to rocket and missile launches and aircraft operations at VSFB is currently authorized by NMFS via an LOA issued under current incidental take regulations, which are effective from April 10, 2019 through April 10, 2024 (84 FR 14314; April 10, 2019). To date, NMFS has promulgated incidental take regulations under the MMPA for substantially similar activities at the site four times. Responsibility for activities at the site were transferred from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to the USSF in May, 2021 and both entities complied with the requirements (e.g., mitigation, monitoring, and reporting) of the current LOA. Information regarding the monitoring results may be found in the Effects of the Specified Activity on Marine Mammals and their Habitat. Description of Proposed Activity Overview USSF operations include launch activities for commercial entities, as well as the Department of Defense, [[Page 5453]] National Aeronautics and Space Administration. VSFB is the primary west coast launch facility for placing commercial, government and military satellites into polar orbit on uncrewed rockets. A subset of rocket launches include a ``boost-back'' maneuver, wherein the first stage booster returns to land at VSFB or at a barge located offshore, for recovery and future re-use. VSFB is also the site of launches for testing and evaluation of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and sub-orbital target and interceptor missiles. The missile activities, which represent a small subset of the activities, are considered Military Readiness Activities. Rocket and missile launch activities create noise (launch noise and/or sonic booms (overpressure of high-energy impulsive sound)) and visual stimulus that can take pinnipeds hauled out on shore along the periphery of VSFB by Level B harassment. In addition, a subset of rocket launches can create noise that affects pinniped haul outs along the shoreline of the Northern Channel Islands (NCI), particularly San Miguel and Santa Rosa islands. The USSF anticipates incremental increases in launch activity each year with a peak in activity of no more than 110 rocket launches and 15 missile launches occurring in any one year (table 1). Table 1--Anticipated Number of Launches and UAS Operations, by Year ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Year Rocket launches Missile launches UAS operations ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2024................................................... 40 15 100 2025................................................... 55 15 100 2026................................................... 75 15 100 2027................................................... 100 15 100 2028................................................... 110 15 100 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to rocket and missile launch activities at VSFB, aircraft conduct flight operations to support activities at VSFB. Here, ``aircraft'' includes crewed fixed wing airplanes and rotary wing helicopters, and different types of UAS. Slightly more than 600 aircraft flights occur each year, and approximately 100 of those flights are UAS. These flight operations address mission needs including emergency response, search-and-rescue, delivery of rocket components, launch mission support, security reconnaissance, and training. VSFB no longer has aircraft stationed on site, but ``transient'' aircraft may be stationed at the site on a temporary basis several times per year for periods of two or more weeks per operation. Take of hauled out pinnipeds from crewed fixed-wing airplanes and helicopter operations are not anticipated because these aircraft adhere to flight paths, minimum altitude requirements, and a buffer zone established to avoid haulouts when possible. In addition, pinnipeds that customarily haul out at sites near the airfield may be acclimated to aircraft and helicopter overflights. However, there is a limited potential for take to result from UAS operations. UAS are categorized by size into five classes, 0-5. While harassment of hauled out pinnipeds from UAS classes 0-2 is unlikely to occur at altitudes of 200 feet (ft) and above (Erbe et al., 2017; Pomeroy et al., 2015; Sweeney et al., 2016; Sweeney and Gelatt, 2017), given that classes 0-3 fly at lower altitudes, USSF anticipates that these classes could cause take of hauled out marine mammals due to visual disturbance, and NMFS concurs. Larger UAS (classes 4 and 5) that utilize the airfield for take offs and landings, must adhere to minimum altitude criteria and buffer zones around haul-out areas, as described in the Proposed Mitigation section. While pinnipeds at nearby haulouts may show brief reactions during takeoffs and landings of classes 4 and 5, animals near these haulouts are generally habituated to these activities and are not expected to have behavioral reactions that would rise to the level of take by Level B harassment. Dates and Duration The activities proposed by USSF would occur for 5 years, from April 2024 through April 2029. Activities would occur year-round and could occur at any time of day, during any or all days of the week. As annual launch numbers increase, more than one launch could occur on some days. Specified Geographical Region VSFB occupies approximately 99,100 acres of land and approximately 68 kilometers (km) of coastline in central Santa Barbara County, California (Figure 1). The Santa Ynez River and State Highway 246 divide the base into two distinct parts, North Base and South Base. BILLING CODE 3510-22-P [[Page 5454]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP29JA24.026 BILLING CODE 3510-22-C Pinnipeds making use of haul-out sites along the coastline of VSFB are affected by launch noise. In addition to these effects at VSFB, some of the rocket launches and first-stage recoveries originating at VSFB may result in sonic booms that impact portions of the NCI, and as such NCI is also considered part of the project area. The NCI comprises four islands (San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa) located approximately 50 km south of Point [[Page 5455]] Conception, which is located on the mainland approximately 6.5 km south of VSFB. The most proximate launch facility on the base and the nearest landmark on the NCI (Harris Point on San Miguel Island) are separated by more than 55 km. Rocket and missile flights originate from several different launch locations on VSFB, distributed across both North Base and South Base. Currently, there are nine active missile launch sites and seven active space launch facilities. In addition, two new launch sites and one former site on the base are expected to become operational in the future. The two largest classes of UAS use the VSFB airfield, three smaller classes of UAS can be launched from any location that is in keeping with buffers to pinniped haulout and rookery sites. The proximity of the launch sites in relation to specific pinniped haul-out and rookery areas at VSFB is shown in table 2. LF-09 is the closest active missile launch facility to a haul-out area, located about 0.5 km from Little Sal, and LF-10 is the most remote facility from any haul- out area, located about 2.7 km from Lion's Head (see figure 2 in USSF's application). While rocket and missile launches do not occur in National Marine Sanctuary waters, depending on the direction of a given launch, rockets and missiles may cross over the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.

Detailed Description of the Specified Activity VSFB is the primary west coast launch facility for placing commercial, government, and military satellites into polar orbit on uncrewed launch vehicles, and for the testing and evaluation of ICBMs and sub-orbital target and interceptor missiles by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). Below, we discuss in detail, USSF's proposed rocket launches and recoveries, missile launches, and aircraft operations including UAS. Rocket Launches Table 1 shows estimates of the numbers proposed rocket launches, missile launches, and UAS activities for each year. Reporting years would span one year from date of LOA issuance and each successive year thereafter, in accordance with the reporting requirements described in the Proposed Monitoring and Reporting section, below. The anticipated maximum number of launches in one year shown in table 1 is similar to the maximum number of launches in one year analyzed in the 2019 rulemaking (84 FR 14314; April 10, 2019), with a small increase. For this rulemaking, USSF anticipates that the total number of launches would increase from the 500 analyzed for the 2019 rulemaking to 550 over the effective period of this rule. Similarly, the estimated number of launches that may cause a sonic boom that affect haulouts at NCI are proposed to increase from 88 to 104 over the effective period of this rulemaking. A large percentage of this anticipated increase is expected to consist of smaller launch payloads moved by smaller rockets than previously utilized at VSFB. Accordingly, USSF is developing a new Small Launch Vehicles program (SLV) for the South Base launch sites at VSFB. This program is expected to require as many as 100 launches annually (included in the basewide 110 rocket launch/year total) and may involve two launches per day on some days. We note that ``small'' rockets (generally those less than 100 ft tall) are less likely to generate sonic booms that could disturb animals at haul outs. Whether or not sonic booms from launches originating at VSFB affect the NCI depends on the trajectory of the launch, the size of the rocket, and other factors such as environmental conditions. In any given year of this proposed rule, it is expected that fewer than 10 percent of small rockets, 25 percent of medium rockets and 33 percent of large rockets would ``boom'' the NCI. When these sonic booms events do occur, they tend to disturb animals at haulouts on San Miguel and (occasionally) Santa Rosa Islands. Santa Cruz and Anacapa Islands are not expected to be impacted by sonic booms in excess of 1 pound per square foot (psf). Further, based on several years of onsite behavioral observations and monitoring data, VSFB maintains and NMFS concurs that harassment of marine mammals is unlikely to occur when the intensity of a sonic boom is below 2(psf). Although exact numbers are uncertain, launches that generate a sonic boom at NCI higher than 2 psf are expected to occur no more than 5 times in authorization year 2024, 12 times in 2025, 24 times in 2026, 30 times in 2027 and 33 times in 2028. Some rocket launches include ``boost back'' and landing of a rocket component at a launch site on the base or on a floating offsite recovery barge. [[Page 5456]] These activities include the use of parachutes and parafoils to control the descent of components to the barge. These are usually recovered, but on occasion, parachutes or parafoils are abandoned, and they sink to the ocean floor. The parachutes would sink to a depth of 1,000 ft within 46 minutes and the parafoil (if it is not recovered) would reach the same depth in one to two hours. Therefore, given the short duration that an unrecovered parachute or parafoil would remain in the water column for a given launch, NMFS does not anticipate that they would take marine mammals, and the likelihood is further reduced by the relative infrequency of instances where parachutes or parafoils are used but not recovered. Missiles A variety of small missiles are launched from various Launch Facilities (LFs) on north VSFB including Minuteman III, an ICBM which is launched from underground silos. USSF is currently modifying several existing silos for testing of the new Ground Based Strategic Defense (GBSD) program, which is expected to replace the Minuteman III as early as 2026. Several types of interceptor and target vehicles are also launched for the MDA. The MDA develops various systems including the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). The MDA estimates that no more than three missile tests per quarter will be conducted each year over the next 5 years, and none of the missiles would be significantly larger than the Minuteman III currently in use. This limitation (three missiles per quarter and none being larger than the Minuteman III) represents the anticipated extent of missile testing at VSFB over the next 5 years. No more than 15 missiles would be launched per year (table 1). The trajectories of all missile launches are generally westward and USSF indicates that they do not cause sonic boom impacts on the California mainland or the NCI. Missiles also transition to nearly horizontal flight within seconds of launch and do not create extended noise impacts to the coastline or result in a high degree of response from hauled-out pinnipeds. For these reasons, take on the NCI arising from missile launch operations is not anticipated or requested. All take associated with missile launch operations would occur on VSFB. Aircraft Operations The VSFB airfield, located on north VSFB, supports various aircraft operations. Aircraft operations include fixed wing airplanes, rotary wing helicopters and UAS. Of these, only UAS is expected to result in take, as discussed below. Over the past 5 years, an average of slightly more than 600 flights has occurred each year, approximately 100 of which have been UAS, and USSF anticipates 100 UAS flights per year during the effective period of this proposed rule (table 1). Fixed-wing aircraft use VSFB for various purposes, including delivering rocket or missile components and training exercises. Helicopter (or, rotary wing) operations also occasionally occur at VSFB including transits through the area, exercises and mission support. Emergency helicopter operations, including but not limited to search-and-rescue and wildfire containment actions, also occur occasionally. Three approved flight paths for airfield access have been configured in order to avoid disturbances from aircraft at established pinniped haul out sites. As a result of these routing measures and minimum altitude criteria, and given that pinnipeds that haul out at VSFB are acclimatized to aircraft and helicopter overflights, USSF does not anticipate take of hauled out pinnipeds from fixed-wing and helicopter operations using the airfield, and NMFS concurs. In addition, no pinniped responses to fixed or rotary wing aircraft have ever been reported and none are anticipated (MMCG and SAIC 2012a). UAS operations at VSFB may include either rotary or fixed wing uncrewed aircraft. These are typically divided into as many as six classes, which graduate in size from class 0 (which are often smaller than 5 inches in diameter and always weigh less than one pound) to class 5 (which can be as large as a small piloted aircraft). UAS classes 03 can be used in almost any location, while classes 4 and 5 typically require a runway and for that reason would only be operated from the VSFB airfield. The launch frequency and class of UAS conducting the flights is not possible to predict. As stated above, there is a limited potential for take to result from UAS operations. While harassment of hauled out pinnipeds from class 02 is unlikely to occur at altitudes of 200 ft and above (Erbe et al., 2017; Pomeroy et al., 2015; Sweeney et al., 2016; Sweeney and Gelatt, 2017), given that classes 0-3 fly at lower altitudes, USSF anticipates that these classes could cause take of hauled out marine mammals due to visual disturbance, and NMFS concurs. Other Activities In addition to the activities described above, USSF operates a small harbor on the south coast, immediately adjacent to a haulout area. Operation of the harbor currently entails a maximum of two large vessel visits per year and one dredging operation typically conducted every other year. In addition, VSFB estimates that SpaceX conducts approximately 30 2-day operations per year using smaller vessels. NMFS does not anticipate take of marine mammals due to these activities for the reasons described herein, and they are not discussed further beyond the brief explanation provided here. While marine mammals may behaviorally respond in some small degree to the noise generated by dredging operations, given the slow, predictable movements of these vessels, and absent any other contextual features that would cause enhanced concern, NMFS does not expect the proposed dredging to result in the take of marine mammals. Further, routine harbor operations are not anticipated to result in take of marine mammals. Proposed mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures are described in detail later in this document (see Proposed Mitigation and Proposed Monitoring and Reporting). Description of Marine Mammals in the Area of Specified Activities Sections 3 and 4 of the application summarize available information regarding status and trends, distribution and habitat preferences, and relevant behavior and life history of the potentially affected species. NMFS fully considered all of this information, and we refer the reader to these descriptions and to additional information regarding population trends and threats that may be found in NMFS' Stock Assessment Reports (SARs); https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessments). More general information about these species (e.g., physical and behavioral descriptions) may be found on NMFS' website (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/find-species). Table 3 lists all species or stocks for which take is expected and proposed to be authorized for this activity, and summarizes information related to the population or stock, including regulatory status under the MMPA and Endangered Species Act (ESA) and potential biological removal (PBR), where known. PBR is defined by the MMPA as the maximum number of animals, not including natural [[Page 5457]] mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population (as described in NMFS' SARs). While no serious injury or mortality is anticipated or proposed to be authorized here, PBR and annual serious injury and mortality from anthropogenic sources are included here as gross indicators of the status of the species or stocks and other threats. Marine mammal abundance estimates presented in this document represent the total number of individuals that make up a given stock or the total number estimated within a particular study or survey area. NMFS' stock abundance estimates for most species represent the total estimate of individuals within the geographic area, if known, that comprises that stock. We also refer to studies and onsite monitoring to inform abundance and distribution trends within the project area. For some species, such as the Guadalupe fur seal, this geographic area may extend beyond U.S. waters. All managed stocks in this region are assessed in NMFS' SARs. All values presented in table 3 are the most recent available at the time of publication and are available online at: https://ww.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/marine-mammal-stock-assessments.

As indicated above, all six species (with six managed stocks) temporally and spatially co-occur with the specified activity to the degree that take is reasonably likely to occur. In addition to the 6 species of pinniped expected to be affected by the specified activities, an additional 28 species of cetaceans are expected to occur or could occur in the waters near the project area. However, we have determined that the potential stressors associated with the specified activities that could result in take of marine mammals (i.e., launch noise, sonic booms and disturbance from aircraft operations) only have the potential to result in harassment of marine mammals that are hauled out of the water. Noise from the specified activities is unlikely to ensonify subsurface waters to an extent that could result in take of cetaceans. Therefore, we have concluded that the likelihood of the proposed activities resulting in the harassment of any cetacean to be so low as to be discountable. Accordingly, cetaceans are not considered further in this proposed rule. Further, only one live northern fur seal has been reported at VSFB in the past 25 years (SBMMC 2012), at least two deceased fur seals have been found on VSFB. Guadalupe fur seals have yet to be reported at VSFB. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that any fur seals will be taken at that site. However as discussed below, NMFS anticipates that both species could be taken at NCI. Steller sea lions are not anticipated to occur at NCI, and therefore, are not expected to be taken at that site, but are likely to be taken at VSFB. Harbor seal, northern elephant seal, and California sea lion are likely to be taken at both NCI and VSFB. California sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) may also be found in waters off of VSFB, which is near the southern extent of their range. However, California sea otters are managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and are not considered further in this proposed rule. Pacific Harbor Seal (California Stock) Harbor seals haul out on intertidal sandbars, rocky shores and beaches along the California coast and islands including VSFB and, to a lesser extent, NCI. Coastwide, from 400 to 600 haul-out sites exist (Carretta et al., 2011; Caretta et al., 2012) and few to several hundred animals may occupy each site when conditions are favorable. Harbor seals generally haul out in greatest numbers during the afternoon but at some sites the beach profile and tidal inundation results in limited or no suitable haul out area. This is the case in some areas around VSFB, where shifting of coastal landforms including beaches, banks and bluffs affect availability of suitable haul out area. Considerable haul out area is consistently available at NCI, irrespective of tidal influence. Harbor seals generally forage locally but individuals, particularly juveniles, may travel up to 500 km either to find food or suitable breeding areas. The greatest numbers haul out during the molting season, from May into August throughout California (Carretta et al., 2011; Caretta et al., 2012). In the vicinity of the project area, the pupping season peaks from mid-February through April; and at VSFB, it extends from March through June. Molting season follows, sometimes overlapping the pupping [[Page 5458]] season. Harbor seal numbers at VSFB haul out areas usually peak in June, but there is some variability (in some years the highest counts occurred in the fall or winter months). Harbor seal pupping also occurs on NCI from March to June. Harbor seals regularly use haulouts along the shoreline at VSFB. Haulout sites on VSFB can be found on both south VSFB and north VSFB, including Lion's Head and Little Sal. California Sea Lion (U.S. Stock) The California sea lion occurs in the eastern north Pacific from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, through the Gulf of California and north along the west coast of North America to the Gulf of Alaska (Barlow et al., 2008; DeLong et al., 2017b; Jefferson et al., 2008). Typically, during the summer, California sea lions congregate near rookery islands and specific open-water areas, including NCI where one of the largest rookeries is found. The primary rookeries off the coast of the United States are on San Nicolas (SNI), San Miguel, Santa Barbara, and San Clemente Islands (Le Boeuf & Bonnell 1980; Lowry et al., 1992; Carretta et al., 2000; Lowry & Forney 2005; Lowry et al., 2017). About 50 percent of the births on San Miguel Island occur in the Point Bennett area, during a pupping season that runs from May to August. In the nonbreeding season, beginning in late summer, adult and subadult males migrate northward along the coast of California to more northerly states, and are largely absent from the southern breeding areas until the following spring (Laake, 2017; Lowry & Forney, 2005). Females and juveniles also disperse to areas north and west of NCI, but tend to stay in the Southern California area. (Lowry & Forney, 2005; Melin & DeLong, 2000; Thomas et al., 2010). California sea lions also occur in open ocean and coastal waters (Barlow et al., 2008; Jefferson et al., 2008). Animals usually occur in waters over the continental shelf and slope; however, they are also known to occupy locations far offshore in deep, oceanic waters, such as Guadalupe Island and Alijos Rocks off Baja California (Jefferson et al., 2008; Melin et al., 2008; Urrutia & Dziendzielewski, 2012; Zavala- Gonzalez & Mellink, 2000). California sea lions are the most frequently sighted pinnipeds offshore of Southern California during the spring, and peak abundance is during the May through August breeding season (Green et al., 1992; Keiper et al., 2005; Lowry et al., 2017). California sea lions haul out at sites in the southern portion of VSFB and have not been observed at any northern VSFB haulout locations, except for rare individuals affected by domoic acid poisoning (USAF 2020; Evans, 2020). There is no known successful breeding of this species on VSFB. In 2019 a significant die-off of California sea lions, presumed to be caused by domoic acid toxicity associated with red tide algal blooms, was noted. This event included most of Southern and Central California and included more than 80 deceased California sea lions on VSFB beaches (USAF 2020; Evans, 2020). California sea lion pupping season begins in late May, peaking on or around the third week of June. Female sea lions nurse their pups for 1 to 2 days, before embarking on progressively longer spans of time away from the haulout site to forage. Typically, the adult female spends 2 to 5 days feeding, before returning to nurse the pup. Females continue a pattern of going to sea for several days and nursing ashore for several days until pups are weaned. The weaning period continues for about 8 to 12 months (Carretta et al., 2011; Caretta et al., 2012). Females usually range from the Mexican border to as far north as San Francisco. If prey is scarce, particularly during El Ni[ntilde]o years, they have been known to extend their range into Oregon. Adult males claim their breeding territories in late May, usually leaving by August, with most animals moving north. Adult males may venture as far north as British Columbia or southeast Alaska. Northern Elephant Seal (California Breeding Stock) The California breeding stock of the Northern elephant seal extends from the Channel Islands to the southeast Farallon Islands (Carretta et al., 201; Caretta et al., 2012). There are two distinct populations of northern elephant seals: one that breeds in Baja California, Mexico; and a population that breeds in California (Garcia-Aguilar et al. 2018). The northern elephant seals in the VSFB Project Area are from the California Breeding stock, although elephant seals from Baja Mexico migrate through the Project Area (Aurioles-Gamboa & Camacho-Rios 2007; Carretta et al., 2017; Carretta et al., 2020). Females and juveniles feed from California into Washington, while males travel as far as Alaska and the Aleutians. Males and females return between March and August to molt. Northern elephant seals spend little time nearshore and migrate four times a year, traveling to and from breeding/pupping and molting areas and spending more than 80 percent of their annual cycle at sea (Robinson et al., 2012; Lowry et al., 2014; Lowry et al., 2017; Carretta et al., 2020). Peak abundance in California is during the January-February breeding season and when adults return to molt from April to July (Lowry et al. 2014; Lowry et al., 2017). Although northern elephant seals haul out at south VSFB locations, they were not observed at north VSFB haul outs in 2019 or in 2020. Breeding has been observed on south VSFB since 2017 (Evans, 2020), and pupping at VSFB was first documented in January 2017. Additional pupping has been observed every year since 2017, increasing each year, with a maximum of approximately 40 pups in 2022. Pupping occurs from January through March, with peak breeding in mid-February. Pups are weaned at 3 to 4 weeks of age, then abandoned and undergo their first molt, which can take several weeks. They then return to sea and customary offshore waters at the end of the molting cycle. Currently, the Amphitheatre Cove haul out at VSFB is the primary site used by elephant seals for breeding and pupping, however another location, Boathouse Beach, was the site for two successful pups each year in 2021 and 2022. All age classes and sexes haul out on VSFB, at different times of the year, to rest, undergo molting and to reproduce or occasionally to rest at other times of year. On NCI, pupping activity occurs from December through March. While some animals disperse after the weaning period, elephant seals also haul out onshore during the seasonal molting period from March to August. Steller Sea Lion (Eastern U.S. Stock) The eastern U.S. stock of Steller sea lions ranges from Cape Suckling, Alaska, to California (Cape Suckling is almost at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Alaska, at long. 140[deg] W). A[ntilde]o Nuevo Island, in central California, is now the southernmost known breeding colony for Steller sea lions (Carretta et al., 2011; Caretta et al., 2012), although they did breed at San Miguel Island until the 1982-1983 El Ni[ntilde]o. Sightings were rare after that. From 2010 to 2012, individual Steller sea lions have shown up along the mainland coast of the Southern California Bight, often hauled out on navigation buoys. At VSFB, Steller sea lions have been observed in generally low numbers since approximately 2012, but no breeding or pupping behavior has been documented. Steller sea lions range along the north Pacific from northern Japan to California (Perrin et al., 2009), with centers of [[Page 5459]] abundance and distribution in the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (Muto et al., 2020). There have also been reports of Steller sea lions in waters off Mexico as far south as the various islands off the port of Manzanillo in Colima, Mexico (Gallo-Reynoso et al., 2020). The eastern U.S. stock (or DPS) of Steller sea lion is defined as the population occurring east of long. 144[deg] W. The locations and distribution of the eastern population's breeding sites along the U.S. Pacific coast have shifted northward, with fewer breeding sites in southern California and more sites established in Washington and southeast Alaska (Pitcher et al., 2007; Wiles, 2015). Steller sea lions pups were known to be born at San Miguel Island up until 1981 (Pitcher et al., 2007; National Marine Fisheries Service 2008; Muto et al., 2020), and as the population continues to increase, Steller sea lions may re-establish a breeding colony on San Miguel Island. However, currently no pupping occurs on NCI. Despite the species' general absence from the area, some Steller sea lions (one to two individuals at a time) have been sighted in the Channel Islands and vicinity. Individual adult and subadult male Steller sea lions have been seen hauled out at San Miguel Island during the fall and winter, and adult and subadult males have occasionally been seen on rocks north of Northwest Point at San Miguel Island in the summer (Delong, 2019). Aerial surveys for pinnipeds in the Channel Islands from 2011 to 2015 encountered a single Steller sea lion at SNI in 2013 (Lowry et al., 2017). Additional sightings have included a single male that was seen hauled out on an oil production structure off Long Beach during the winter of 2015 and 2016, a Steller observed in 2018 hauled out on a buoy outside Ventura Harbor, and a lone adult female that gave birth to and reared a pup on San Miguel Island in the summer of 2017 (Delong 2019). In April and May 2012 Steller sea lions were observed at VSFB marking the first time this species had been reported at VSFB over the prior two decades. Since 2012, Steller sea lions have been observed occasionally in routine monthly surveys, with a peak of 16 individuals recorded. In 2019, up to four Steller sea lions were observed on south VSFB during monthly marine mammal counts, and none were observed during monthly counts in the years that followed. While flying to VSFB from Santa Maria for an unrelated project, contract biologists observed and photographed three Steller sea lions at Lion Rock (Point Sal) in October 2017 (Ball, 2017). This offshore haulout site can be exposed to in-air noise levels from missile launches and is included in the take estimates provided below. Northern Fur Seal (San Miguel Island Stock) Northern fur seals range from southern California to the Bering Sea and west to the Okhotsk Sea and Japan. About 74 percent of the breeding population occurs far north of the project area, on the Pribilof Islands of the southern Bering Sea. The San Miguel Island stock comprises less than one percent of the population. In general, Northern fur seals are highly pelagic, and adult northern fur seals spend more than 300 days per year (about 80 percent of their time) at sea, generally well offshore. While at sea, northern fur seals range throughout the North Pacific (Carretta et al., 2011; Caretta et al., 2012). Migrating seals and those along the U.S. west coast are typically found over the edge of the continental shelf and slope (Kenyon & Wilke 1953; Sterling & Ream 2004; Gentry 2009; Adams et al. 2014). Northern fur seals have not been observed at any VSFB haulout location (NMFS, 2020b) and are not expected to be subject to noise levels at the base that may cause behavioral effects. Adult males stay on or near haul-outs on NCI from May through August, with some non-breeding individuals remaining until November. Beginning in May, male seals start returning to the breeding islands. Upon arrival males seek to occupy and defend optimal breeding territories before the females arrive. Because males do not leave the breeding territory to feed, their ability to fast is critical. Males remain on their territory an average of 46 days. Adult females generally stay on or near haul-outs beginning in June and extending to fall, sometimes to as late as November. Peak pupping is in early July. Females nurse their newborn pups for 5 to 6 days and then go to sea to forage for 3.5 to 9.8 days. Females continue to cycle between land and sea for the remainder of the nursing period. Their time on land declines to less than 2 days and their time at sea generally increases. Pups are nursed until weaned (about 4 months) and leave the breeding site before their mothers to forage independently. Some juveniles are present year-round, but most juveniles and adults head for the open ocean and a pelagic existence until the following year. Pupping occurs at NCI (San Miguel Island) from June through August. Pupping does not occur at VSFB. Guadalupe Fur Seal (Mexico) Satellite tracking data from Guadalupe fur seals tagged at Guadalupe Island in Mexico, have shown that the seals transit through offshore waters between 50 and 300 km from the U.S. west coast (Norris et al. 2015; Norris, 2017b; Norris, 2017a; Norris & Elorriaga- Verplancken, 2020). Based on that data, the seals could occur in ocean and coastal waters within or adjacent to the VSFB Project Area. However, Guadalupe fur seals have not been observed at any VSFB haulout locations (USAF 2020; Evans, 2020) and are not expected to be subject to in-air noise levels at VSFB that may cause behavioral disturbance. Guadalupe fur seals are only rarely observed on San Miguel and San Nicolas Islands, typically at Point Bennett, and are almost always sighted as a lone individual. Lone adult males twice established territories on San Nicolas Island which lasted a few years each time, but no females arrived (Carretta et al., 2011; Caretta et al., 2012). As such, there is no pupping activity within the project area. Potential Effects of Specified Activities on Marine Mammals and Their Habitat This section provides a discussion of the ways in which components of the specified activity may impact marine mammals and their habitat. The Estimated Take of Marine Mammals section later in this document includes a quantitative analysis of the number of individuals that are expected to be taken by this activity. The Negligible Impact Analysis and Determination section considers the content of this section, the Estimated Take of Marine Mammals section, and the Proposed Mitigation section, to draw conclusions regarding the likely impacts of these activities on the reproductive success or survivorship of individuals and whether those impacts are reasonably expected to, or reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival. In-air acoustic effects resulting from rocket launches and recoveries, missile launches and UAS operations may affect hauled out marine mammals. The effects of noise from the USSF's proposed activities have the potential to result in Level B harassment of marine mammals in the action area. Description of Sound Sources This section contains a brief technical background on sound, the characteristics of certain sound types, and on metrics used in this proposal inasmuch as the information is relevant [[Page 5460]] to the specified activity and to a discussion of the potential effects of the specified activity on marine mammals found later in this document. Sound travels in waves, the basic components of which are frequency, wavelength, velocity, and amplitude. Frequency is the number of pressure waves that pass by a reference point per unit of time and is measured in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second. Wavelength is the distance between two peaks or corresponding points of a sound wave (length of one cycle). Higher frequency sounds have shorter wavelengths than lower frequency sounds, and typically attenuate (decrease) more rapidly, except in certain cases in shallower water. Amplitude is the height of the sound pressure wave or the ``loudness'' of a sound and is typically described using the relative unit of the dB. A sound pressure level (SPL) in dB is described as the ratio between a measured pressure and a reference pressure and is a logarithmic unit that accounts for large variations in amplitude; therefore, a relatively small change in dB corresponds to large changes in sound pressure. The source level (SL) represents the SPL referenced at a distance of 1 m from the source while the received level is the SPL at the listener's position. Note that all airborne sound levels in this document are referenced to a pressure of 20 [micro]Pa. Root mean square (rms) is the quadratic mean sound pressure over the duration of an impulse. Root mean square is calculated by squaring all of the sound amplitudes, averaging the squares, and then taking the square root of the average (Urick, 1983). Root mean square accounts for both positive and negative values; squaring the pressures makes all values positive so that they may be accounted for in the summation of pressure levels (Hastings and Popper, 2005). This measurement is often used in the context of discussing behavioral effects, in part because behavioral effects, which often result from auditory cues, may be better expressed through averaged units than by peak pressures. Sound exposure level (SEL; represented as dB re 1 [mu]Pa\\2\\-s) represents the total energy contained within a pulse and considers both intensity and duration of exposure. Peak sound pressure (also referred to as zero-to-peak sound pressure or 0-p) is the maximum instantaneous sound pressure measurable in the water at a specified distance from the source and is represented in the same units as the rms sound pressure. Another common metric is peak-to-peak sound pressure (pk-pk), which is the algebraic difference between the peak positive and peak negative sound pressures. Peak-to-peak pressure is typically approximately 6 dB higher than peak pressure (Southall et al., 2007). A-weighting is applied to instrument-measured sound levels in an effort to account for the relative loudness perceived by the human ear, as the ear is less sensitive to low audio frequencies, and is commonly used in measuring airborne noise. The relative sensitivity of pinnipeds listening in air to different frequencies is more-or-less similar to that of humans (Richardson et al., 1995), so A-weighting may, as a first approximation, be relevant to pinnipeds listening to moderate- level sounds. The sum of the various natural and anthropogenic sound sources at any given location and time--which comprise ``ambient'' or ``background'' sound--depends not only on the source levels (as determined by current weather conditions and levels of biological and human activity) but also on the ability of sound to propagate through the environment. In turn, sound propagation is dependent on the spatially and temporally varying properties of the water column and sea floor, and is frequency-dependent. As a result of the dependence on a large number of varying factors, ambient sound levels can be expected to vary widely over both coarse and fine spatial and temporal scales. Sound levels at a given frequency and location can vary by 10-20 dB from day to day (Richardson et al., 1995). The result is that, depending on the source type and its intensity, sound from a given activity may be a negligible addition to the local environment or could form a distinctive signal that may affect marine mammals. Details of source types are described in the following text. Sounds are often considered to fall into one of two general types: Pulsed and non-pulsed (defined in the following). The distinction between these two sound types is important because they have differing potential to cause physical effects, particularly with regard to hearing (e.g., Ward, 1997 in Southall et al., 2007). Please see Southall et al. (2007) for an in-depth discussion of these concepts. Pulsed sound sources (e.g., airguns, explosions, gunshots, sonic booms, impact pile driving) produce signals that are brief (typically considered to be less than one second), broadband, atonal transients (ANSI, 1986; ANSI, 2005; Harris, 1998; NIOSH, 1998; ISO, 2003) and occur either as isolated events or repeated in some succession. Pulsed sounds are all characterized by a relatively rapid rise from ambient pressure to a maximal pressure value followed by a rapid decay period that may include a period of diminishing, oscillating maximal and minimal pressures, and generally have an increased capacity to induce physical injury as compared with sounds that lack these features. Non-pulsed sounds can be tonal, narrowband, or broadband, brief or prolonged, and may be either continuous or non-continuous (ANSI, 1995; NIOSH, 1998). Some of these non-pulsed sounds can be transient signals of short duration but without the essential properties of pulses (e.g., rapid rise time). Examples of non-pulsed sounds include those produced by vessels, aircraft, machinery operations such as drilling or dredging, vibratory pile driving, and active sonar systems (such as those used by the U.S. Navy). The duration of such sounds, as received at a distance, can be greatly extended in a highly reverberant environment. The effects of sounds on marine mammals are dependent on several factors, including the species, size, and behavior (feeding, nursing, resting, etc.) of the animal; the intensity and duration of the sound; and the sound propagation properties of the environment. Impacts to marine species can result from physiological and behavioral responses to both the type and strength of the acoustic signature (Viada et al., 2008). The type and severity of behavioral impacts are more difficult to define due to limited studies addressing the behavioral effects of sounds on marine mammals. Potential effects from impulsive sound sources can range in severity from effects such as behavioral disturbance or tactile perception to physical discomfort, slight injury of the internal organs and the auditory system, or mortality (Yelverton et al., 1973). The effects of sounds from the proposed activities are expected to result in behavioral disturbance of marine mammals. Due to the expected sound levels of the activities proposed and the distance of the activity from marine mammal habitat, the effects of sounds from the proposed activities are not expected to result in temporary or permanent hearing impairment (TTS and PTS, respectively), non-auditory physical or physiological effects, or masking in marine mammals. Data from monitoring reports associated with authorizations issued by NMFS previously for similar activities in the same location as the planned activities (described further below) provides further support for the assertion that TTS, PTS, non-auditory physical or physiological effects, and masking are not likely to occur (USAF, 2013b; SAIC, [[Page 5461]] 2012). Therefore, TTS, PTS, non-auditory physical or physiological effects, and masking are not discussed further in this section. Disturbance Reactions Disturbance includes a variety of effects, including subtle changes in behavior, more conspicuous changes in activities, and displacement. Though significantly driven by received level, the onset of behavioral disturbance from anthropogenic noise exposure is also informed to varying degrees by other factors related to the source or exposure context (e.g., frequency, predictability, duty cycle, duration of the exposure, signal-to-noise ratio, distance to the source, ambient noise, and the receiving animal's hearing, motivation, experience, demography, behavior at time of exposure, life stage, depth) and can be difficult to predict (e.g., Southall, et al., 2007, Southall et al., 2021; Ellison et al., 2012). Habituation can occur when an animal's response to a stimulus wanes with repeated exposure, usually in the absence of unpleasant associated events (Wartzok et al., 2003). Animals are most likely to habituate to sounds that are predictable and unvarying. The opposite process is sensitization, when an unpleasant experience leads to subsequent responses, often in the form of avoidance, at a lower level of exposure. Behavioral state may affect the type of response as well. For example, animals that are resting may show greater behavioral change in response to disturbing sound levels than animals that are highly motivated to remain in an area for feeding (Richardson et al., 1995; NRC, 2003; Wartzok et al., 2003). Controlled experiments with captive marine mammals have shown pronounced behavioral reactions, including avoidance of loud underwater sound sources (Ridgway et al., 1997; Finneran et al., 2003). These may be of limited relevance to the proposed activities given that airborne sound, and not underwater sound, may result in harassment of marine mammals as a result of the proposed activities; however we present this information as background on the potential impacts of sound on marine mammals. Observed responses of wild marine mammals to loud pulsed sound sources (typically seismic guns or acoustic harassment devices) have been varied but often consist of avoidance behavior or other behavioral changes suggesting discomfort (Morton and Symonds, 2002; Thorson and Reyff, 2006; Gordon et al., 2004; Wartzok et al., 2003; Nowacek et al., 2007). The onset of noise can result in temporary, short term changes in an animal's typical behavior and/or avoidance of the affected area. These behavioral changes may include: reduced/increased vocal activities; changing/cessation of certain behavioral activities (such as socializing or feeding); visible startle response or aggressive behavior; avoidance of areas where sound sources are located; and/or flight responses (Richardson et al., 1995). Not all behavioral responses are indicative of a take. For further discussion of behavioral responses as they relate to take, see table 5. The biological significance of many of these behavioral disturbances is difficult to predict, especially if the detected disturbances appear minor. However, the consequences of behavioral modification could potentially be biologically significant if the change affects growth, survival, or reproduction. The onset of behavioral disturbance from anthropogenic sound is dependent upon a number of contextual factors including, but not limited to, sound source frequencies, whether the sound source is moving towards the animal, hearing ranges of marine mammals, behavioral state at time of exposure, status of individual exposed (e.g., reproductive status, age class, health) and an individual's experience with similar sound sources. Southall et al., (2021), Ellison et al. (2012) and Moore and Barlow (2013), among others, emphasize the importance of context (e.g., behavioral state of the animals, distance from the sound source) in evaluating behavioral responses of marine mammals to acoustic sources. Marine mammals that occur in the project area could be exposed to in-air sound that has the potential to result in behavioral harassment of pinnipeds that are hauled out. Airborne sound at certain levels is expected to result in behavioral responses similar to those discussed above in relation to underwater sound. For instance, anthropogenic sound could cause hauled out pinnipeds to exhibit changes in their normal behavior such as a change from resting state to an `alert' posture or to flush from a haulout site into the water. The results from studies of pinniped response to acoustic disturbance arising from launches and associated sonic booms at VSFB and NCI are highly variable (Holst et al., 2005; Ugoretz and Greene Jr. 2012). Pinniped responses to rocket launches at the sites have been monitored for well over two decades. Monitoring data have consistently shown that the degree of pinniped reactions to sonic booms varies among species (table 4), with harbor seals typically showing the highest levels of disturbance, followed by California sea lions, and with northern elephant seals generally being much less responsive. Steller sea lions are only rarely observed in the project area and react to launch noise infrequently. Types of responses range from no response to heads-up alerts, from startle responses to some movements on land, and from some movements into the water to one instance of stampede.

Atlas V (March 1, 2017)................. \\a\\ ~0.8 Cuyler Harbor on San Northern elephant seal: 13 of Miguel Island. 235 (6 percent) alerted; none flushed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\a\\ Peak sonic boom at the monitoring site was ~2.2 psf, but was in infrasonic range--not audible to pinnipeds. Within the audible frequency spectrum, boom at monitoring site estimated at ~0.8 psf. Post-launch monitoring of pinniped behavior shows that return to pre-launch numbers of animals and types of behaviors occurs within minutes or up to an hour or two after each launch event, regardless of species. Responsiveness also varies with time of year and age class, with juvenile pinnipeds being more likely to react by entering the water and temporarily leaving the haulout site. The probability and type of behavioral response also depends on the season, the group composition, and the type of activity or behavior at the time of disturbance. For example, in some cases, harbor seals have been found to be more responsive during the pupping/breeding season (Holst et al., 2005a; Holst et al., 2008) while in other instances, lone individuals seem more prone to react than mothers and pups (Ugoretz and Greene Jr., 2012). California sea lions seem to be consistently less responsive during the pupping season (Holst et al., 2010; Holst et al., 2005a; Holst et al., 2008; Holst et al., 2011; Holst et al., 2005b; Ugoretz and Greene Jr., 2012). Pup abandonment could theoretically result in instances where adults flush into the water as a result of sound from an in-season launch. In its application, USSF cites one instance of a stampede on NCI that was triggered by launch noise in excess of that predicted to occur from USSF's proposed activity. No instances of pup abandonment are reflected in site-specific monitoring data. Given there is only one known instance of a stampede and no known pup abandonment, we find that abandonment is not likely to occur from future activities that create similar sound levels as those in the past. While reactions are variable, and can involve abrupt movements by some individuals, biological impacts of observed responses to launch activities and supporting operations appear to be limited in duration and consist of behavioral disruption including temporary abandonment of a haul out area. Anticipated Effects on Marine Mammal Habitat Habitat includes, but is not necessarily limited to, rookeries, mating grounds, feeding areas, and areas of similar significance. We do not anticipate that the proposed activities would result in any temporary or permanent effects on the habitats used by the marine mammals in the proposed area, including the food sources they use (i.e., fish and invertebrates). Therefore, it is not expected that the specified activities would impact feeding success of pinnipeds. While it is anticipated that the proposed activity may result in marine mammals avoiding certain haulout areas due to temporary ensonification of out-of-water habitat, this impact is temporary and reversible and was discussed earlier in this document, in the context of behavioral modification. No impacts are anticipated to accrue to prey species or to foraging areas and in-water habitat frequented by pinnipeds. The main impact associated with the proposed activity will be temporarily elevated in-air noise levels and the associated reaction of certain pinnipeds, previously discussed in this proposed rule. Estimated Take of Marine Mammals This section provides an estimate of the number of incidental takes proposed [[Page 5463]] for this rule, which will inform both NMFS' consideration of ``small numbers'' and the negligible impact determinations. Harassment is the only type of take expected to result from these activities. Except with respect to military readiness activities, section 3(18) of the MMPA defines ``harassment'' as any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance, which: (i) has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild (Level A harassment); or (ii) has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering (Level B harassment). As stated above, a comparatively small portion of USSF's activities are considered military readiness activities. For military readiness activities, the MMPA defines ``harassment'' as: (i) Any act that injures or has the significant potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild (Level A harassment); or (ii) Any act that disturbs or is likely to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of natural behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, surfacing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering, to a point where the behavioral patterns are abandoned or significantly altered (Level B harassment). The take estimate methodology outlined below is considered appropriate for the quantification of take by Level B harassment based on either of the two definitions. Authorized takes would be by Level B harassment only, in the form of disruption of behavioral patterns for individual marine mammals resulting from exposure to launch related visual or auditory stimulus. Based on the nature of the activity and as shown in activity-specific studies (described below), Level A harassment is neither anticipated nor proposed to be authorized. As described previously, no serious injury or mortality is anticipated or proposed to be authorized for this activity. Below we describe how the proposed take numbers are estimated. For acoustic impacts, generally speaking, we estimate take by considering: (1) acoustic thresholds above which NMFS believes the best available science indicates marine mammals will be behaviorally harassed or incur some degree of permanent hearing impairment; (2) the area that will be ensonified above these levels in a day; (3) the density or occurrence of marine mammals within these ensonified areas; and, (4) the number of days of activities. We note that while these factors can contribute to a basic calculation to provide an initial prediction of potential takes, additional information that can qualitatively inform take estimates is also sometimes available (e.g., previous monitoring results or average group size). Below, we describe the factors considered here (which include thresholds for take from launches and UAS, considered in combination with pinniped survey data in the form of daily counts) in more detail and present the proposed take estimates. Acoustic Thresholds For underwater sounds, NMFS recommends the use of acoustic thresholds that identify the received levels above which exposed marine mammals would be reasonably expected to be behaviorally harassed (equated to Level B harassment) or to incur PTS of some degree (equated to Level A harassment). Thresholds have also been developed identifying the received level of in-air sound above which exposed pinnipeds would likely be behaviorally harassed. Here, thresholds for behavioral disturbance from launch activities have been developed based on observations of pinniped responses before, during, and after launches and UAS activity. For rocket and missile launches at VSFB, given the sound levels and proximity, NMFS assumes that all rocket launches will behaviorally harass pinnipeds of any species hauled out at sites around the periphery of the base. For rocket launches from VSFB that transit over or near NCI, based on several years of onsite behavioral observations and monitoring data, NMFS predicts that those that create a sonic boom over 2.0 psf could behaviorally harass pinnipeds of any species hauled out on NCI. For UAS activity NMFS predicts that, given the potential variability of locations, routing and altitudes necessary to meet mission needs, classes 0-3 could behaviorally harass pinnipeds of any species hauled out at VSFB. Regarding potential hearing impairment, the effects of launch noise on pinniped hearing were the subject of studies at the site in the past. In addition to monitoring pinniped haul-out sites before, during and after launches, researchers were previously required to capture harbor seals at nearby haulouts and Point Conception to test their sensitivity to launch noises. Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) tests were performed under 5-year SRPs starting in 1997. The goal was to determine whether launch noise affected the hearing of pinnipeds (MMCG and SAIC 2012a). The low frequency sounds from launches can be intense, with the potential of causing a temporary threshold shift (TTS), in which part or all of an animal's hearing range is temporarily diminished. In some cases, this diminishment can last from minutes to days before hearing returns to normal. None of the seals tested in these studies over a span of 15 years showed signs of TTS or PTS, supporting a finding that launch noise at the levels tested is unlikely to cause PTS and that any occurrence of TTS may be of short duration. Ensonified Area Here, we describe operational and environmental parameters of the activity that are used in estimating the area ensonified above the acoustic thresholds, including source levels and transmission loss coefficient. Because the haulouts at NCI are more distant from the rocket launch sites than those at VSFB, different methods are used to predict when launches are likely to impact pinnipeds at the two sites. As stated above, for rocket and missile launches at VSFB, NMFS conservatively assumes that all rocket launches will behaviorally harass pinnipeds of any species hauled out at sites around the periphery of the base. For rocket launches from VSFB that transit over or near NCI, NMFS predicts that those that are projected to create a sonic boom over 2 psf could behaviorally harass pinnipeds of any species hauled out on NCI. For UAS activity, NMFS predicts that classes 0-3 could behaviorally harass pinnipeds of any species hauled out at VSFB. The USSF is not able to predict the exact areas that will be impacted by noise associated with the specified activities, including sonic booms, launch noise and UAS operations. Many different types of launch vehicle types are operated from VSFB. Different combinations of vehicles and launch sites create different sound profiles, and dynamic environmental conditions also bear on sound transmission. As such, the different haul-out sites around the periphery of the base are ensonified to varying degrees when launches and, when applicable, recoveries of first stage boosters occur. USSF is not able to predict the exact timing, types and trajectories of these future rocket launch programs. However, as described below, rocket launches are expected to behaviorally disturb pinnipeds at VSFB and some launches are also expected to disturb pinniped hauled out at NCI. Missiles are only expected to impact pinnipeds at Lion Rock (Point Sal), and [[Page 5464]] UAS impacts are only expected to occur at Small Haulout 1 (in VSFB). Therefore, for the purposes of estimating take, we conservatively estimate that all haulout sites at VSFB will be ensonified by rocket launch noise above the level expected to result in behavioral disturbance. Different space launch vehicles also have varying trajectories, which result in different sonic boom profiles, some of which are likely to affect areas on the NCI (San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa). Based on several years of onsite monitoring data, harassment of marine mammals is unlikely to occur when the intensity of a sonic boom is below 2 psf. Santa Cruz and Anacapa Islands are not expected to be impacted by sonic booms in excess of 2 psf (USAF, 2018), therefore, USSF does not anticipate take of marine mammals on these islands, and NMFS concurs. Sonic booms from VSFB launches or recoveries can impact haul out areas and may take marine mammals on San Miguel Island and occasionally on Santa Rosa Island. In order to accommodate the variability of possible launches and (when applicable) sonic booms over NCI, USSF estimates that 25 percent of pinniped haulouts on San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands may be ensonified to a level above 2 psf. NMFS concurs, and we consider this to be a conservative assumption based on sonic boom models which show that areas predicted to be impacted by a sonic boom with peak overpressures of 2 psf and above are typically limited to isolated parts of a single island, and sonic boom model results tend to overestimate actual recorded sonic booms on the NCI (personal communication: R. Evans, USSF, to J. Carduner, NMFS, OPR). Modeling has not been required for launches of currently deployed missiles because of their trajectories west of VSFB and north of San Miguel Island and the previously well-documented acoustic properties of the missiles. The anticipated GBSD is expected to utilize approximately the same trajectories as the current ICBM, and the GBSD program will be required to model at least one representative launch. When missiles are launched in a generally western direction (they turn south several hundred miles from VSFB and at high altitude), there is no sonic boom impact on the NCI; thus take of pinnipeds on NCI is not anticipated from missile launches. Given flight characteristics and trajectories, take from missile launch is not anticipated for most species. However, given proximity and the generally western trajectory, noise from missile launches from North Base may take California sea lions that haul out at Lion Rock (Point Sal) near VSFB's northern boundary. Marine Mammal Occurrence and Take Estimation In this section, we bring together the information above and describe take from the three different activity types (rockets, missiles, and UAS) expected to occur at VSFB and NCI, the marine mammal occurrence data (based on two survey series specific to VSFB and NCI), species and location-specific data related the likelihood of either exposure (e.g., tidal differences) or response (e.g., proportion of previously recorded responses that qualify as take), and the amount of activity. We describe the calculations used to arrive at the take estimates for each activity, species, and location, and present the total estimated take in table 14. NMFS uses a three-tiered scale to determine whether the response of a pinniped on land to stimuli is indicative of Level B harassment under the MMPA (table 5). NMFS considers the behaviors that meet the definitions of both movements and flushes in table 5 to qualify as behavioral harassment. Thus a pinniped on land is considered by NMFS to have been behaviorally harassed if it moves greater than two times its body length, or if the animal is already moving and changes direction and/or speed, or if the animal flushes from land into the water. Animals that become alert or stir without other movements indicative of disturbance are not considered harassed. Prior observations of pinniped responses to certain exposures may be used to predict future responses and assist in estimating take. Here, the levels of observed responses of particular species during monitoring are used to inform take estimate correction factors as described in the species and activity- specific sections below.

Monthly marine mammal surveys at VSFB are conducted to document the abundance, distribution and status of pinnipeds at VSFB. When possible, these surveys are timed to coincide with the lowest afternoon tides of each month, when the greatest numbers of animals are usually hauled out. Data gathered during monthly surveys include: species, number, general behavior, presence of pups, age class, gender, reactions to natural or human- caused disturbances, and environmental conditions. Some species are observed regularly at VSFB and the NCI (e.g., California sea lion), while other species are observed less frequently (e.g., northern fur seals and Guadalupe fur seals). Take estimates were calculated separately for each stock in each year the proposed regulations would be valid [[Page 5465]] (from 2024 to 2029), on both VAFB and the NCI, based on the number of animals assumed hauled out at each location that are expected to be behaviorally harassed by the stimuli associated with the specified activities (i.e., launch, sonic boom, or UAS noise). First, the number of hauled out animals per month was estimated at both VAFB and the NCI for each stock, based on survey data and subject matter expert input. Second, we estimated the percentage of animals that would be taken by harassment from a launch at a given site, using the corrections and adjustments. In order to determine that percentage, we considered whether certain factors could result in fewer than the total estimated number at a location being harassed. These factors include whether the extent of ensonification is expected to affect only a portion of the animals in an area, tidal inundation that displaces animals from affected areas and for species reactivity to launch noise, life history patterns and, where appropriate, seasonal dispersal patterns. Launches covered in this authorization are not expected to produce a sonic boom over the mainland except that some first stage recoveries back to launch facilities on the base that may do so. Because first stage recoveries always occur within ten minutes of the initial launch, a response from any given animal to both launch and recovery are considered to be one instance of take, even when both launch and recovery meet or exceed the 2 psf threshold for calculating take. Vandenberg Space Force Base As described above, rocket launches, missile launches, and UAS activities are expected to result in take of pinnipeds on VSFB at haul outs along the periphery of the base. Because the supporting information and/or methods are different for these three activity types, we describe them separately below. Launches from different launch facilities at VSFB create different degrees of ensonification at specific haul out sites, and further, USSF has limited ability to forecast which launch sites may be used for future launches. As described previously, some launches also involve the recovery of a booster component back to the launch site, or to an alternate offshore location. As noted above, NMFS first estimated the number of hauled out animals per month at VAFB for each stock. NMFS used marine mammal counts collected by USSF during monthly marine mammal surveys to approximate haulout abundance. NMFS compared monthly counts for a given species from 2020 to 2022 and selected the highest count (sum across all haul out sites) for each month for each species, as indicated in table 6. NMFS then selected the highest monthly count for each species and used that as the estimated number of animals that would be hauled out at any given time during a launch. Because launches from different SLCs impact different haul-outs, we expect that using this highest monthly estimate will result in a conservative take estimate. Therefore, NMFS considers the 2020-2022 survey data relied upon to be the best data available. As further indicated in the table 7, and described below, the predicted number of animals taken by each launch, by species, is adjusted as indicated to account for the fact that (1) for some species, animals are only hauled out and available to be taken during low tide and (2) years of monitoring reports showing that different species respond behaviorally to launches in a different manner.

Rocket Launches at VSFB USSF assumes that all rocket launches would take, by Level B harassment, animals hauled out at sites around the periphery of the base. Some rocket launches create overpressure at time of launch, and some recoveries of first-stage boosters can create a sonic boom when they return to the launch pad. Some flights also transit over or near portions of the NCI, but potential impacts to marine mammals at the NCI are discussed separately, below. Table 8 lists the proposed take by Level B harassment from rocket launch and recovery activities at VSFB, and below, we describe how NMFS estimated take for each species. Note that northern fur seal and Guadalupe fur seal are not anticipated to occur at VSFB, and therefore, NMFS does not anticipate impacts to these species at VSFB. Harbor Seals Pacific harbor seals haul out regularly at more than ten sites on both north and south VSFB. They are the most widespread pinniped species on VSFB and have been seen in all months, with decades of successful pupping. Rocket launches from sites closer to the haulouts are more likely to cause disturbance, including noise and visual impacts. Many of their haulout sites are inundated during high tide, and NMFS anticipates that take of this species would only occur during low tides. Rocket launches from sites closer to the haulouts are more likely to cause disturbance, including noise and visual impacts. However, to capture variability, we assume that all rocket launches result in Level B harassment of 100 percent of the harbor seals at all VSFB haulouts. To determine the number of animals that would be taken by Level B harassment, we multiplied the max [[Page 5466]] count indicated in table 6 by the number of proposed launches per year (table 8) for each year of the proposed authorization. As noted in table 6, monitoring data show that, generally speaking, most if not all harbor seals exposed to launch noise exhibit a behavioral response to launch stimulus that equates to take by Level B harassment and, therefore, we predict that 100 percent of animals exposed to launch noise will be taken per launch. However, given that most haulout sites at VSFB are inundated at high tide, NMFS applied a 50 percent correction factor (table 7). Therefore, estimated takes = max daily count (149) X tidal correction factor (0.5) X number of rocket launches in the area for each year for each year (40 in year 1, etc.), and the resulting take numbers NMFS proposes to authorize are listed in table 8. California Sea Lion California sea lions on VSFB only haul out regularly at Rocky Point (north and south) and Amphitheatre Cove. California sea lions are most abundant at the haul out in Zone G at Lion Rock (Point Sal). Rocket launches from SLC-6, SLC-8, and the future SLC-11, which are closest to North Rocky Point, would be the most likely to result in noise and visual impacts. Rocket launches from SLC-3E and SLC-4E, both farther inland and some four times the distance, are less likely to impact California sea lions at North Rocky Point. During very high tides and strong winds, when spray is heavy, the sea lions often leave this site or are unable to access it. Therefore, NMFS assumes that for any given rocket launch at VSFB, 50 percent of the maximum number of California sea lions that haul out at VSFB may be taken by Level B harassment. To determine the number of animals that would be taken by Level B harassment, we multiplied the max count indicated in table 6 by the number of proposed launches per year (table 8) for each year of the proposed authorization. As noted in table 6, monitoring data show that, generally speaking, most if not all California sea lions hauled out at VSFB would exhibit a behavioral response to launch stimulus that equates to take by Level B harassment and, therefore, we predict that 100 percent of animals exposed to launch noise will be taken per launch. However, given that most haulout sites at VSFB are inundated at high tide, NMFS applied a 50 percent correction factor (table 7). Therefore, the number of estimated takes = max daily count (112) x tidal correction factor (0.5) x number of rocket launches in the area (40 in year 1, etc.), and the resulting take numbers NMFS proposes to authorize are listed in table 8. Northern Elephant Seal Northern elephant seals historically hauled out at VSFB only rarely, and most animals observed onsite were subadult males. In 2004, a record count of 188 animals was made, mostly newly weaned seals (MMCG and SAIC 2012a); these numbers continued to increase (unpublished data, however reported annually to NMFS). In November 2016, mature adults were observed in Amphitheatre Cove, and pupping was first documented in January 2017 with 18 pups born and weaned. In January 2018, a total of 25 pups were born and weaned; 26 in 2019, 34 in 2020, 33 in 2021 and 49 in 2022. Two pups were born and weaned at Boathouse Beach in both 2021 and 2022. We assume that this site, in addition to Amphitheater, will support pupping in future years. Pupping occurs from December through March, with peak breeding in mid-February. To determine the number of animals that would be taken by Level B harassment, we multiplied the max count indicated in table 6 by the number of proposed launches per year (table 8) for each year of the proposed authorization. As noted in table 6, given elephant seals' known lack of sensitivity to noise, based on VSFB monitoring reports and the literature, NMFS predicts that only 15 percent of elephant seals exposed to the launch noise would respond in a manner that constitutes take by Level B harassment, and, therefore, a 15 percent correction factor was applied. We also note that, unlike for harbor seals and California sea lions, Northern elephant seal presence and numbers are not affected by tides. Therefore, the number of estimated takes = highest daily count (302) x behavioral harassment correction factor (0.15) x number of rocket launches in the area for each year (40 in year 1, etc.), and the resulting take numbers NMFS proposes to authorize are listed in table 8. Steller Sea Lion Steller sea lions have been observed at VSFB since April 2012 (MMCG and SAIC 2012c), though as indicated in table 6, they were not observed between 2020 and 2022. For purposes of estimating take, USSF estimates that up to five Steller sea lions may haul out at VSFB during any given launch. NMFS multiplied this number by the number of proposed launches per year for each year of the proposed authorization (Table 8). NMFS assumes that all rocket launches result in behavioral disturbance (i.e., Level B harassment) of 100 percent of the Steller sea lions hauled out at VSFB. Therefore, the number of estimated takes = 5 animals x number of rocket launches in the area (40 in year 1, etc.), and the resulting take numbers NMFS proposes to authorize are listed in table 8.
