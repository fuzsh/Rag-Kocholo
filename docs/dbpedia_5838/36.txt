This report describes a Hispanic girl who presented in aplastic crisis due to parvovirus infection. She was subsequently found to have a chronic hemolytic anemia secondary to an unstable hemoglobinopathy. Genetic testing revealed that the girl and two symptomatic family members had Hb Evans [alpha62(E11)Val-->Met, GTG-->ATG (alpha2)], an unstable hemoglobin (Hb) variant due to a mutation in the alpha2-globin chain. Hb Evans has been described only once previously, in a Caucasian kindred. Literature review indicates aplastic crisis is a rare initial presentation of unstable hemoglobinopathies and that these disorders are infrequent but important causes of hemolytic anemia in Hispanic patients.

Hemoglobin adducts have been used as biomarkers of exposure to reactive chemicals. Glycidol, an animal carcinogen, has been reported to form N-(2,3-dihydroxy-propyl)valine adducts to hemoglobin (diHOPrVal). To support the use of these adducts as markers of glycidol exposure, we investigated the kinetics of diHOPrVal formation and its elimination in vitro and in vivo. Five groups of rats were orally administered a single dose of glycidol ranging from 0 to 75 mg/kg bw, and diHOPrVal levels were measured 24 h after administration. A dose-dependent increase in diHOPrVal levels was observed with high linearity (R{sup 2} = 0.943). Blood sampling at differentmoreÂ Â» time points (1, 10, 20, or 40 days) from four groups administered glycidol at 12 mg/kg bw suggested a linear decrease in diHOPrVal levels compatible with the normal turnover of rat erythrocytes (life span, 61 days), with the calculated first-order elimination rate constant (k{sub el}) indicating that the diHOPrVal adduct was chemically stable. Then, we measured the second-order rate constant (k{sub val}) for the reaction of glycidol with N-terminal valine in rat and human hemoglobin in in vitro experiments with whole blood. The k{sub val} was 6.7 Â± 1.1 and 5.6 Â± 1.3 (pmol/g globin per Î¼Mh) in rat and human blood, respectively, indicating no species differences. In vivo doses estimated from k{sub val} and diHOPrVal levels were in agreement with the area under the (concentrationâtime) curve values determined in our earlier toxicokinetic study in rats. Our results indicate that diHOPrVal is a useful biomarker for quantification of glycidol exposure and for risk assessment. - Highlight: â¢ Glycidol-hemoglobin adduct (diHOPrVal) was characterized for exposure evaluation. â¢ We studied the kinetics of diHOPrVal formation and elimination in vitro and in vivo. â¢ Dose dependent formation and chemical stability were confirmed in the rat study. â¢ In vivo dose (AUC) of glycidol could be estimated from diHOPrVal

Hemoglobin E (HbE) is an extremely common structural hemoglobin variant that occurs at high frequencies throughout many Asian countries. It is a Î²-hemoglobin variant, which is produced at a slightly reduced rate and hence has the phenotype of a mild form of Î² thalassemia. Its interactions with different forms of Î± thalassemia result in a wide variety of clinical disorders, whereas its coinheritance with Î² thalassemia, a condition called hemoglobin E Î² thalassemia, is by far the most common severe form of Î² thalassemia in Asia and, globally, comprises approximately 50% of the clinically severe Î²-thalassemia disorders.

Hb Alesha is caused by a GTG-->ATG mutation at codon 67 of the beta-globin gene, resulting in abnormal beta-globin chains in which the normal beta67(E11) valine is changed to methionine. This hemoglobin (Hb) is also known as Hb Bristol, the first unstable Hb described, since in a fraction of the variant the methionine is modified into an aspartic acid by a posttranslational modification. This replacement disrupts the apolar bonds between the valine and the heme group, producing an unstable Hb and severe hemolysis. We have identified this rare hemoglobinopathy in an Argentinean girl with severe hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly and frequent requirement for red blood cell transfusions.

Electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy has been used to study protons in nitrosyl horse heart myoglobin (MbNO). (1)H ENDOR spectra were recorded for different settings of the magnetic field. Detailed analysis of the ENDOR powder spectra, using computer simulation, based on the "orientation-selection" principle, leads to the identification of the available protons in the heme pocket. We observe hyperfine interactions of the N(HisF8)-Fe(2+)-N(NO) complex with five protons in axial and with eight protons in the rhombic symmetry along different orientations, including those of the principal axes of the g-tensor. Protons from His-E7 and Val-E11 residues are identified in the two symmetries, rhombic and axial, exhibited by MbNO. Our results indicate that both residues are present inside the heme pocket and help to stabilize one particular conformation. PMID:10733988

A pathogenic V67M mutation occurs at the E11 helical position within the heme pockets of variant human fetal and adult hemoglobins (Hb). Subsequent post-translational modification of Met to Asp was reported in Î³ subunits of human fetal Hb Toms River (Î³67(E11)Val â Met) and Î² subunits of adult Hb (HbA) Bristol-Alesha (Î²67(E11)Val â Met) that were associated with hemolytic anemia. Using kinetic, proteomic, and crystal structural analysis, we were able to show that the Met â Asp transformation involves heme cycling through its oxoferryl state in the recombinant versions of both proteins. The conversion to Met and Asp enhanced the spontaneous autoxidation of the mutants relative to wild-type HbA and human fetal Hb, and the levels of Asp were elevated with increasing levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Using H2(18)O2, we verified incorporation of (18)O into the Asp carboxyl side chain confirming the role of H2O2 in the oxidation of the Met side chain. Under similar experimental conditions, there was no conversion to Asp at the Î±Met(E11) position in the corresponding HbA Evans (Î±62(E11)Val â Met). The crystal structures of the three recombinant Met(E11) mutants revealed similar thioether side chain orientations. However, as in the solution experiments, autoxidation of the Hb mutant crystals leads to electron density maps indicative of Asp(E11) formation in Î² subunits but not in Î± subunits. This novel post-translational modification highlights the nonequivalence of human Hb Î±, Î², and Î³ subunits with respect to redox reactivity and may have direct implications to Î±/Î² hemoglobinopathies and design of oxidatively stable Hb-based oxygen therapeutics.

The E11 valine in the distal heme pocket of either the Î±- or Î²-subunit of human adult hemoglobin (Hb A) was replaced by leucine, isoleucine, or phenylalanine. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for structural and functional studies. 1H NMR spectra were obtained for the CO and deoxy forms of Hb A and the mutants. The mutations did not disturb the Î±1Î²2 interface in either form, whereas the H-bond between Î±His-103 and Î²Gln-131 in the Î±1Î²1 interfaces of the deoxy Î±-subunit mutants was weakened. Localized structural changes in the mutated heme pocket were detected for the CO form of recombinant Hb (rHb) (Î±V62F), rHb (Î²V67I), and rHb (Î²V67F) compared with Hb A. In the deoxy form the proximal histidyl residue in the Î²-subunit of rHb (Î²V67F) has been altered. Furthermore, the interactions between the porphyrin ring and heme pocket residues have been perturbed in rHb (Î±V62I), rHb (Î±V62F), and rHb (Î²V67F). Functionally, the oxygen binding affinity (P50), cooperativity (n50), and the alkaline Bohr Effect of the three Î±-subunit mutants and rHb (Î²V67L) are similar to those of Hb A. rHb (Î²V67I) and rHb (Î²V67F) exhibit low and high oxygen affinity, respectively. rHb (Î²V67F) has P50 values lower that those reported for rHb (Î±L29F), a B10 mutant studied previously in our laboratory (Wiltrout, M. E., Giovannelli, J. L., Simplaceanu, V., Lukin, J. A., Ho, N. T., and Ho, C. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 7207â7217). These E11 mutations do not slow down the autoxidation and azide-induced oxidation rates of the recombinant proteins. Results from this study provide new insights into the roles of E11 mutants in the structure-function relationship in hemoglobin. PMID:23867463

Aromatic aldehydes and ethacrynic acid (ECA) exhibit antipolymerization properties that are beneficial for sickle cell disease therapy. Based on ECA pharmacophore and its atomic interaction with hemoglobin, we designed and synthesized several compounds--designated as KAUS (imidazolylacryloyl derivatives)--that we hypothesized would bind covalently to Î²Cys93 of hemoglobin and inhibit sickling. The compounds surprisingly showed weak allosteric and antisickling properties. X-ray studies of hemoglobin in complex with representative KAUS compounds revealed an unanticipated mode of Michael addition reaction between the Î²-unsaturated carbon and the N-terminal Î±Val1 nitrogen at the Î±-cleft of hemoglobin, with no observable interaction with Î²Cys93. Interestingly, the compounds exhibited almost no reactivity with the free amino acids, L-Val, L-His and L-Lys, however showed some reactivity with both glutathione and L-Cys. Our findings provide a molecular level explanation to the compounds biological activities and an important framework for targeted modifications that would yield novel potent antisickling agents.

Fatty acid esters of glycidol (glycidyl esters) are processing contaminants generated as a byproduct of the industrial deodorization of vegetable oils and fats. Oral intake of glycidyl esters leads to the release of glycidol in the gastrointestinal tract. Glycidol is carcinogenic, genotoxic and teratogenic in rodents. It is rated as probably carcinogenic to humans (IARC group 2A). The determination of internal exposure of glycidol may support the assessment of the possible human health risks related to glycidyl ester intake. For this purpose, hemoglobin adducts of glycidol may be suitable biomarkers reflecting the cumulative exposure of up to four months. We applied a modified Edman degradation to assess the glycidol adduct at the N-terminal valine, N-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-valine (2,3-diHOPr-Val), of hemoglobin. The modified valine was cleaved with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC), resulting in the formation of N-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-valine fluorescein thiohydantoin (DHP-Val-FTH). An isotope-dilution technique was developed for the quantification of the thiohydantoin analyte by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and DHP-Val-d 7 -FTH as reference standard. The limit of detection was 4 fmol DHP-Val-FTH per injection corresponding to 0.7pmol 2,3-diHOPr-Val/g hemoglobin. The adduct levels in blood samples of 12 non-smoking participants were in the range of 2.2-4.9pmol 2,3-diHOPr-Val/g hemoglobin. The current work presents the first isotope-dilution technique using UPLC-MS/MS for the quantification of 2,3-diHOPr-Val at the N-terminus of hemoglobin as a sensitive and convenient alternative to earlier GC-MS methods.

Hemoglobin New York (beta 113 (G15) Val-->Glu), a beta-globin variant, was first reported in a Chinese family living in New York. Subsequently, this abnormal hemoglobin was reported in many Chinese descendants from several groups and it was also known as Hb Kaohsiung. The subtle change in alpha1beta1 contact region apart from the heme group connecting area by Val-->Glu substitution has minor changes in both the electrophoretic mobility and stability making this hemoglobin variant difficult to distinguish from Hb A using routine hemoglobin analysis. The authors described a case of heterozygosity of Hb New York diagnosed by a molecular technique and revealed a mutation in beta(CD113 GTG-->GAG). A novel Allele Related Mutation Specific-Polymerase Chain Reaction (ARMS-PCR) for rapid diagnosis of this mutation has been proposed.

Bohr effect of avian hemoglobins: Quantitative analyses based on the Wyman equation.

PubMed

The Bohr effect data for bar-headed goose, greylag goose and pheasant hemoglobins can be fitted with the Wyman equation for the Bohr effect, but under one proviso: that the pK a of His146Î² does not change following the TâR quaternary transition. This assumption is based on the x-ray structure of bar-headed goose hemoglobin, which shows that the salt-bridge formed between His146Î² and Asp94Î² in human deoxyhemoglobin is not formed in goose deoxyhemoglobin. When the Bohr data for chicken hemoglobin were fitted by making the same assumption, the pK a of the NH 3 + terminal group of Val1Î± decreased from 7.76 to 6.48 following the TâR transition. When the data were fitted without making any assumption, the pK a of the NH 3 + terminal group increased from 7.57 to 7.77 following the TâR transition. We demonstrate that avian hemoglobin Bohr data are readily fitted with the Wyman equation because avian hemoglobins lack His77Î². From curve-fitting to Bohr data we estimate the pK a s of the NH 3 + terminal group of Val1Î± in the R and T states to be 6.33Â±0.1 and 7.22Â±0.1, respectively. We provide evidence indicating that these pK a s are more accurate than estimates from kinetic studies. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is considered a promising strategy in the treatment of Î²-thalassemia, in which production of adult hemoglobin (HbA) is impaired by mutations affecting the Î²-globin gene. Recent results indicate that B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) is a major repressor of Î³-globin gene expression. Therefore, disrupting the binding of the BCL11A transcriptional repressor complex to the Î³-globin gene promoter provides a novel approach for inducing expression of the Î³-globin genes. To develop a cellular screening system for the identification of BCL11A inhibitors, we produced K562 cell clones with integrated copies of a BCL11A-XL expressing vector. We characterized 12 K562 clones expressing different levels of BCL11A-XL and found that a clear inverse relationship does exist between the levels of BCL11A-XL and the extent of hemoglobinization induced by a panel of HbF inducers. Using mithramycin as an inducer, we found that this molecule was the only HbF inducer efficient in rescuing the ability to differentiate along the erythroid program, even in K562 cell clones expressing high levels of BCL11A-XL, suggesting that BCL11A-XL activity is counteracted by mithramycin.

Glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb A1C) is a crucial indicator for the long-term control and the diagnosis of diabetes. However, the presence of hemoglobin (Hb) variants may affect the measured value of Hb A1C and result in an abnormal graph trend and inconsistency between the clinical blood sugar test and Hb A1C values. In this study, laboratory data of 41,267 patients with diabetes were collected. The Hb A1C levels and the graph results were examined. We identified 74 cases containing abnormal Hb A1C graph trends. The conducted blood cell counts and capillary Hb electrophoresis were used to analyze Hb variants. We also determined gene variation for the Hb variants by a sequence approach. Fifteen different types of Hb variants were identified in this study. Among these, we found a novel variant in which the Î±1 subunit of Hb showed an insertion of 24 nucleotides (nts) between the 56th and 57th residues. We named this novel variant Hb Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital (Hb KSVGH) (HBA1: p.Lys57_Gly58insSerHisGlySerAlaGlnValLys).

Compromises in compensatory neurobiologic mechanisms due to aging and/or genetic factors (i.e., APOE gene) may influence brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) val66met polymorphism effects on temporal lobe morphometry and memory performance. We studied 2 cohorts from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: 175 healthy subjects and 222 with prodromal and established Alzheimer's disease. Yearly structural magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive performance assessments were carried out over 3Â years of follow-up. Both cohorts had similar BDNF Val/Val and MetÂ allele carriers' (including both Val/Met and Met/Met individuals) distribution. In healthy subjects, a significant trend for thinner posterior cingulate and precuneus cortices was detected in Met carriers compared to Val homozygotes in APOE E4 carriers, with large and medium effect sizes, respectively. The mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease cohort showed a longitudinal decline in entorhinal thickness in BDNF Met carriers compared to Val/Val in APOE E4 carriers, with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. In addition, an effect of BDNF genotype was found in APOE E4 carriers for episodic memory (logical memory and ADAS-Cog) and semantic fluency measures, with Met carriers performing worse in all cases. These findings suggest a lack of compensatory mechanisms in BDNF Met carriers and APOE E4 carriers in healthy and pathological aging. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Erythrocytosis associated with the presence of a hemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity has been reported for 10 hemoglobin variants, most of which demonstrate altered electrophoretic mobility. Several members of a family were found to have erythrocytosis, and both the whole blood and the hemoglobin exhibited increased oxygen affinity. Phosphate-free hemoglobin solutions had a normal Bohr effect and reactivity to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The electrophoretic properties of the hemoglobin were normal, but on peptide mapping of a tryptic digest of the isolated Î²-chains, a normal Î²T11 peptide and an abnormal Î²T11 with greater Rf were seen. Analysis of the abnormal peptide showed the substitution of leucine for the normal proline at Î²100 (helical residue G2). The hemoglobin variant, designated Hb Brigham, serves to emphasize the necessity for detailed evaluation of the structure and function of hemoglobin in familial erythrocytosis even with electrophoretically ânormalâ hemoglobin.

C.E.R.A. (continuous erythropoietin receptor activator, pegilated-rHuEPO Ã) corrects and maintains stable hemoglobin levels in once-monthly administration in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of anemia with C.E.R.A. in CKD patients not on dialysis in the clinical setting. Two hundred seventy two anemic CKD patients not on dialysis treated with C.E.R.A. were included in this retrospective, observational, multicentric study during 2010. Demographical characteristics, analytical parameters concerning anemia, treatment data and iron status were recorded. C.E.R.A. achieved a good control of anemia in both naÃ¯ve patients (mean Hemoglobin 11.6g/dL) and patients converted from a previous ESA (mean Hemoglobin 11.7g/dL). Most naÃ¯ve patients received C.E.R.A. once monthly during the correction phase and required a low monthly dose (median dose 75 Âµg/month). The same median dose was required in patients converted from a previous ESA, and it was lower than recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). Iron status was adequate in 75% of anemic CKD patients, but only 50% of anemic patients with iron deficiency received iron supplementation. C.E.R.A. corrects and maintains stable hemoglobin levels in anemic CKD patients not on dialysis, requiring conversion doses lower than those recommended by the SPC, and achieving target hemoglobin levels with once-monthly dosing frequency both in naÃ¯ve and converted patients.

Thalassemia and hemoglobin E (Hb E) are common in Thailand. Individuals with thalassemia trait usually have a normal hemoglobin concentration or mild anemia. Therefore, thalassemic individuals who have minimum acceptable Hb level may be accepted as blood donors. This study was aimed at determining the frequency of Î±-thalassemia 1 trait, Î²-thalassemia trait, and Hb E-related syndromes in Southern Thai blood donors. One hundred and sixteen voluntary blood donors, Southern Thailand origin, were recruited for thalassemia and Hb E screening by red blood cell indices/dichlorophenolindophenol precipitation test. Î²-Thalassemia and Hb E were then identified by high performance liquid chromatography and 4 common Î±-thalassemia deletions were characterized by a single tube-multiplex gap-polymerase chain reaction. Overall frequency of hemoglobinopathies was 12.9%, classified as follows: homozygous Î±-thalassemia 2 (1.7%), heterozygous Î±-thalassemia 1 (1.7%), heterozygous Î²-thalassemia without Î±-thalassemia (0.9%), heterozygous Hb E without Î±-thalassemia (5.2%), double heterozygotes for Hb E/Î±-thalassemia 1 (1.7%), homozygous Hb E without Î±-thalassemia (0.9%), and homozygous Hb E with heterozygous Î±-thalassemia 2 (0.9%). The usefulness of thalassemia screening is not only for receiving highly effective red blood cells in the recipients but also for encouraging the control and prevention program of thalassemia in blood donors.

Diffusion coefficients of oxygen and hemoglobin measured by facilitated oxygen diffusion through hemoglobin solutions.

Diffusion coefficients of oxygen (DO2) and hemoglobin (DHb) were obtained from measuring the oxygen flux through thin layers of hemoglobin solutions at 20 degrees C. The liquid layers were supported by a membrane and not soaked in any filter material. Oxygen fluxes were measured from the changes in oxygen partial pressure in the gas phases at both sides of the layer. A mathematical treatment is presented for correct evaluation of the measurements. Measurements were done for bovine and for human hemoglobin. Hemoglobin concentrations (CHb) were between 11 and 42 g/dl, which covers the concentrations in the erythrocyte. Both DO2 and DHb could be fitted to the empirical equation D = D0(1-CHb/C1)10-CHb/C2. The following parameters were obtained: DO = 1.80 x 10(-9) m2/s, C1 = 100 g/dl, C2 = 119 g/dl, for oxygen and D0 = 7.00 x 10(-11) m2/s, C1 = 46 g/dl, C2 = 128 g/dl, for hemoglobin. No difference between the diffusion coefficients of bovine or human hemoglobin was found. The diffusion coefficients of hemoglobin were higher than most values reported in the literature, probably because in this study the mobility of hemoglobin was not hindered by surrounding filter material.

ABSTRACT Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH) is characterized by hypocalcemia, inappropriately low serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and hypercalciuria. ADH is genetically heterogeneous with ADH type 1 (ADH1), the predominant form, being caused by germline gainâofâfunction mutations of the Gâprotein coupled calciumâsensing receptor (CaSR), and ADH2 caused by germline gainâofâfunction mutations of Gâprotein subunit Î±â11 (GÎ±11). To date GÎ±11 mutations causing ADH2 have been reported in only five probands. We investigated a multigenerational nonconsanguineous family, from Iran, with ADH and keratoconus which are not known to be associated, for causative mutations by wholeâexome sequencing in two individuals with hypoparathyroidism, of whom one also had keratoconus, followed by cosegregation analysis of variants. This identified a novel heterozygous germline Val340Met GÎ±11 mutation in both individuals, and this was also present in the other two relatives with hypocalcemia that were tested. Threeâdimensional modeling revealed the Val340Met mutation to likely alter the conformation of the Câterminal Î±5 helix, which may affect Gâprotein coupled receptor binding and Gâprotein activation. In vitro functional expression of wildâtype (Val340) and mutant (Met340) GÎ±11 proteins in HEK293 cells stably expressing the CaSR, demonstrated that the intracellular calcium responses following stimulation with extracellular calcium, of the mutant Met340 GÎ±11 led to a leftward shift of the concentrationâresponse curve with a significantly (pâ<â0.0001) reduced mean halfâmaximal concentration (EC50) value of 2.44âmM (95% CI, 2.31 to 2.77âmM) when compared to the wildâtype EC50 of 3.14âmM (95% CI, 3.03 to 3.26âmM), consistent with a gainâofâfunction mutation. A novel His403Gln variant in transforming growth factor, betaâinduced (TGFBI), that may be causing keratoconus was also identified, indicating likely digenic

Nitrite anion is bioactive nitric oxide (NO) species circulating in blood, and represents the NO bioavailability and endothelial function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the nitrite levels and the correlation with hemolysis and severity in Î²-thalassemia/hemoglobin E (Î²-thal/HbE). 38 Children (12.0Â±1.9 years of age) with a diagnosis of mild, moderate and severe Î²-thalassemia were enrolled in the study. The blood nitrite levels and potential plasma NO consumption were measured by the chemiluminescence method. The nitrite levels in whole blood and erythrocytes of the severe thalassemia subjects were lower than those of the control subjects. At day 7 after transfusion of packed erythrocytes, the nitrite levels in erythrocytes increased. The plasma hemoglobin and NO consumption increased in the severe thalassemia subjects. The nitrite levels in erythrocytes inversely correlated with plasma hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase activity, potential NO consumption, and lipid peroxidation. Our studies demonstrate the decreased NO bioavailability in thalassemia, which could result from endothelial dysfunction, the increased potential NO consumption in plasma by cell-free hemoglobin and oxidative stress.

Hemoglobin levels slightly below the lower limit of normal are common in adults in the general population in developing countries. A few human studies have suggested the use of antioxidant vitamins in the correction of mild anemia. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association of vitamin E supplementation in mildly anemic healthy adults with post-supplemental blood hemoglobin levels in the general population of Karachi, Pakistan. In a single-blinded and placebo-controlled randomized trial, 124 mildly anemic subjects from the General Practitioners' Clinics and personnel of the Aga Khan University were randomized into intervention (n = 82) and control (n = 42) group. In the intervention group, each subject was given vitamin E (400 mg) everyday for a period of three months, while control group subjects received a placebo. Eighty six subjects completed the trial. Fasting venous blood was collected at baseline and after three months of supplementation. Hemoglobin levels and serum/plasma concentrations of vitamin E, vitamin B12, folate, ferritin, serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, creatinine, total-antioxidant-status and erythropoietin were measured and analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and multiple linear regression. The adjusted regression coefficients (Î²) and standard error [SE(Î²)] of the significant predictors of post-supplemental hemoglobin levels were serum concentration of vitamin E (0.983[0.095]), gender (- 0.656[0.244]), sTfR (- 0.06[0.02]) and baseline hemoglobin levels (0.768[0.077]). The study showed a positive association between vitamin E supplementation and enhanced hemoglobin levels in mildly anemic adults.

Hemoglobin (Hb) variants may be associated with low oxygen saturation and exacerbated episodes of anemia from common stressors such as viral infections. These attributes frequently cause increased clinical concern and unnecessary and expensive testing if not considered early in the evaluation of the patient. Some clinically significant Hb variants result in a normal Hb electrophoresis result, which can be method-dependent. Herein we describe a patient with low oxygen saturation and a history of hemolytic anemia who was subsequently found to carry a novel, unstable Î²-globin variant that we have named Hb Allentown [Î²137(H15)ValâTrp (GTG>TGG) HBB: c.412_413delinsTG, p.Val138Trp] for the place of identification of the variant. Hb Allentown is formed by a rare double nucleotide substitution within the same codon. Additionally, positive identification of rare Hb variants characterized by a single method is discouraged, as the Hb variant was misclassified as Hb S-South End or Î²6(A3)GluâVal;Î²132(H10)LysâAsn (HBB: c.[20Aâ>âT;399Aâ>âC]) by the initial laboratory.

Hemoglobin E is largely confined to south and southeast Asia. The association between hemoglobin E (HbE) and malaria is less clear than that of hemoglobin S and C. As part of a malaria study in the Chittagong Hill Districts of Bangladesh, an initial random sample of 202 individuals showed that 39% and 49% of Marma and Khyang ethnic groups, respectively, were positive for either heterozygous or homozygous hemoglobin E. In this group, 6.4% were also found to be severely deficient and 35% mildly deficient for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). In a separate Plasmodium falciparum malaria case-uninfected control study, the odds of having homozygous hemoglobin E (HbEE) compared with normal hemoglobin (HbAA) were higher among malaria cases detected by passive surveillance than age and location matched uninfected controls (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-46.93). The odds of heterozygous hemoglobin E (HbAE) compared with HbAA were similar between malaria cases and uninfected controls (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.42-1.19). No association by hemoglobin type was found in the initial parasite density or the proportion parasite negative after 2 days of artemether/lumefantrine treatment. HbEE, but not HbAE status was associated with increased passive case detection of malaria. Â© The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

The deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, exhibits altitude-associated variation in hemoglobin oxygen affinity. To examine the structural basis of this functional variation, the structure of the hemoglobin was solved. Recombinant hemoglobin was expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Recombinant hemoglobin was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method using polyethylene glycol as a precipitant. The obtained orthorhombic crystal contained two subunits in the asymmetric unit. The refined structure was interpreted as the aquo-met form. Structural comparisons were performed among hemoglobins from deer mouse, house mouse and human. In contrast to human hemoglobin, deer mouse hemoglobin lacks the hydrogen bond between Î±1Trp14 in the A helix and Î±1Thr67 in the E helix owing to the Thr67Ala substitution. In addition, deer mouse hemoglobin has a unique hydrogen bond at the Î±1Î²1 interface between residues Î±1Cys34 and Î²1Ser128.

Although the risk of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy depends on cumulative oxaliplatin dose, susceptibility to this adverse event differs greatly among patients. In this study, we investigated the associations between oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy and the following polymorphisms: glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) Ile(105)Val, and glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT) Pro(11)Leu and AGXT Ile(340)Met. Eighty-two Japanese patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer who received at least six cycles of the modified FOLFOX6 (m-FOLFOX6) regimen were enrolled. To minimize differences in cumulative oxaliplatin dose between patients, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy was evaluated using an oxaliplatin-specific scale during the 2-week period after completion of the sixth cycle of treatment. Forty-four patients developed grade 2/3 oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. There were more patients carrying at least one GSTP1(105)Val allele among the group with grade 2/3 neuropathy (18/44, 41%) than among the group with grade 1 neuropathy (9/38, 24%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.098). There were similar numbers of patients carrying at least one AGXT(105)Met allele in the grade 2/3 neuropathy (7/44, 16%) and grade 1 neuropathy groups (5/38, 13%; P=0.725). The AGXT(11)Leu allele was not found in any of our patients or controls. We found no significant association between oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy and the GSTP1 Ile(105)Val and AGXT Ile(340)Met polymorphisms. Given that no AGXT(11)Leu allele was found among our study population (n=177), evaluating this polymorphism in Japanese patients in future studies is likely to be uninformative.

Proto-oncogene HER2 (also known as erbB-2 or neu) plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and the prognosis of breast cancer. Many epidemiological studies have been conducted to explore the association between the HER2 Ile655Val polymorphism and breast cancer risk. However, inconsistency existed in the results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of 27 published case-control studies including 11,504 cases and 12,538 controls. We assessed the strength of the association by crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and reached a result that HER2 Ile655Val polymorphism was associated with an increased breast cancer risk in overall populations (for Ile/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.00-1.12, P = 0.07 for heterogeneity; for the dominant model Ile/Val + Val/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.01-1.20, P = 0.01 for heterogeneity). In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we found a significant association among Africans (for Val/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = .78, 95% CI = 1.94-39.72, P = 0.35 for heterogeneity; for the recessive model Val/Val vs. Ile/Val +Ile/Ile: OR = 8.60, 95% CI = 1.92-38.48, P = 0.31 for heterogeneity) and Asians (for Ile/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.01-1.39, P = 0.41 for heterogeneity; for the dominant model Val/Val + Ile/Val vs. Ile/Ile: OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.01-1.38, P = 0.27 for heterogeneity). In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that HER2 Ile 655Val polymorphism may contribute to breast cancer risk.

Thalassemia is the most common genetic disease worldwide; those with severe disease require lifelong blood transfusion and iron chelation therapy. The definitive cure for thalassemia is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which is limited due to lack of HLA-matched donors and the risk of post-transplant complications. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology offers prospects for autologous cell-based therapy which could avoid the immunological problems. We now report genetic correction of the beta hemoglobin (HBB) gene in iPSCs derived from a patient with a double heterozygote for hemoglobin E and Î²-thalassemia (HbE/Î²-thalassemia), the most common thalassemia syndrome in Thailand and Southeast Asia. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target the hemoglobin E mutation from one allele of the HBB gene by homology-directed repair with a single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide template. DNA sequences of the corrected iPSCs were validated by Sanger sequencing. The corrected clones were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor and erythroid cells to confirm their multilineage differentiation potential and hemoglobin expression. The hemoglobin E mutation of HbE/Î²-thalassemia iPSCs was seamlessly corrected by the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The corrected clones were differentiated into hematopoietic progenitor cells under feeder-free and OP9 coculture systems. These progenitor cells were further expanded in erythroid liquid culture system and developed into erythroid cells that expressed mature HBB gene and HBB protein. Our study provides a strategy to correct hemoglobin E mutation in one step and these corrected iPSCs can be differentiated into hematopoietic stem cells to be used for autologous transplantation in patients with HbE/Î²-thalassemia in the future.

Factor XIII (FXIII) plays role in stabilizing the linkage between fibrins during blood clotting and has been implicated in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The relationship between the Val34Leu polymorphism in F13A1, which encodes the enzymatic subunit of FXIII, and RPL is unclear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association betweenF13A1 Val34Leu and the risk of RPL. We performed a meta-analysis of 11 studies involving 1092 cases and 678 controls using published literature from PubMed and Embase. We detected an association in recessive (Val/Val vs. Val/Leu+Leu/Leu; OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.51-0.99, P=0.04), and one of the two co-dominant (Val/Val vs. Val/Leu; OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.52-0.98, P=0.03) models of in heritance. Subgroup analysis revealed that the F13A1 Val34Leu polymorphism was associated with RPL in Asians (Val vs. Leu; OR=0.53, CI=0.33-0.85, P=0.01). However, there was no association between F13A1 Val34Leu and RPL in Europeans and South Americans. Our meta-analysis supports an association between F13A1 Val34Leu and RPL.

Accumulating evidence suggests that altered dopamine transmission may increase the risk of mental disorders such as ADHD, schizophrenia or depression, possibly mediated by reward system dysfunction. This study aimed to clarify the impact of the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism in interaction with environmental variation (GÃE) on neuronal activity during reward processing. 168 healthy young adults from a prospective study conducted over 25years participated in a monetary incentive delay task measured with simultaneous EEG-fMRI. DNA was genotyped for COMT, and childhood family adversity (CFA) up to age 11 was assessed by a standardized parent interview. At reward delivery, a GÃE revealed that fMRI activation for win vs. no-win trials in reward-related regions increased with the level of CFA in Met homozygotes as compared to Val/Met heterozygotes and Val homozygotes, who showed no significant effect. During the anticipation of monetary vs. verbal rewards, activation decreased with the level of CFA, which was also observed for EEG, in which the CNV declined with the level of CFA. These results identify convergent genetic and environmental effects on reward processing in a prospective study. Moreover, GÃE effects during reward delivery suggest that stress during childhood is associated with higher reward sensitivity and reduced efficiency in processing rewarding stimuli in genetically at-risk individuals. Together with previous evidence, these results begin to define a specific system mediating interacting effects of early environmental and genetic risk factors, which may be targeted by early intervention and prevention.

To determine the prevailing hemoglobin levels in PICU patients, and any potential correlates. Post hoc analysis of prospective multicenter observational data. Fifty-nine PICUs in seven countries. PICU patients on four specific days in 2012. None. Patients' hemoglobin and other clinical and institutional data. Two thousand three hundred eighty-nine patients with median age of 1.9 years (interquartile range, 0.3-9.8 yr), weight 11.5âkg (interquartile range, 5.4-29.6âkg), and preceding PICU stay of 4.0 days (interquartile range, 1.0-13.0 d). Their median hemoglobin was 11.0âg/dL (interquartile range, 9.6-12.5âg/dL). The prevalence of transfusion in the 24 hours preceding data collection was 14.2%. Neonates had the highest hemoglobin at 13.1âg/dL (interquartile range, 11.2-15.0âg/dL) compared with other age groups (p < 0.001). The percentage of 31.3 of the patients had hemoglobin of greater than or equal to 12âg/dL, and 1.1% had hemoglobin of less than 7âg/dL. Blacks had lower median hemoglobin (10.5; interquartile range, 9.3-12.1âg/dL) compared with whites (median, 11.1; interquartile range, 9.0-12.6; p < 0.001). Patients in Spain and Portugal had the highest median hemoglobin (11.4; interquartile range, 10.0-12.6) compared with other regions outside of the United States (p < 0.001), and the highest proportion (31.3%) of transfused patients compared with all regions (p < 0.001). Patients in cardiac PICUs had higher median hemoglobin than those in mixed PICUs or noncardiac PICUs (12.3, 11.0, and 10.6âg/dL, respectively; p < 0.001). Cyanotic heart disease patients had the highest median hemoglobin (12.6âg/dL; interquartile range, 11.1-14.5). Multivariable regression analysis within diagnosis groups revealed that hemoglobin levels were significantly associated with the geographic location and history of complex cardiac disease in most of the models. In children with cancer, none of the variables tested correlated with patients' hemoglobin levels

The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met polymorphism impacts cortical dopamine (DA) levels and may influence cortical electrical activity in the human brain. This study investigated whether COMT genotype influences resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) power in the frontal, parietal and midline regions in healthy volunteers. EEG recordings were conducted in the resting-state in 13 postmenopausal healthy woman carriers of the Val/Val genotype and 11 with the Met/Met genotype. The resting EEG spectral absolute power in the frontal (F3, F4, F7, F8, FC3 and FC4), parietal (CP3, CP4, P3 and P4) and midline (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz and Oz) was analyzed during the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The frequency bands considered were the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2. EEG data of the Val/Val and Met/Met genotypes, brain regions and conditions were analyzed using a general linear model analysis. In the individuals with the Met/Met genotype, delta activity was increased in the eyes-closed condition, theta activity was increased in the eyes-closed and in the eyes-open conditions, and alpha1 band, alpha2 band and beta1band activity was increased in the eyes-closed condition. A significant interaction between COMT genotypes and spectral bands was observed. Met homozygote individuals exhibited more delta, theta and beta1 activity than individuals with the Val/Val genotype. No significant interaction between COMT genotypes and the resting-state EEG regional power and conditions were observed for the three brain regions studied. Our findings indicate that the COMT Val(158)Met polymorphism does not directly impact resting-state EEG regional power, but instead suggest that COMT genotype can modulate resting-state EEG spectral power in postmenopausal healthy women.

Interactions of different hemoglobin variants with thalassemia alleles can result in various clinical phenotypes. HbE-beta-thalassemia generally manifests with severe anemia where individuals exhibit beta-thalassemia major with regular blood transfusions or beta-thalassemia intermedia with periodic blood transfusions. This study presents a unique Malay family with three beta-globin gene defects-HbE, Hb South Florida, and IVS1-1 (G-->A). HbE activates a cryptic splice site that produces non-functional mRNAs. Hb South Florida is a rare beta-hemoglobin variant, and its interactions with other beta-thalassemia alleles have not been reported. IVS1-1 is a Mediterranean mutation that affects mRNA processing giving rise to beta(o)-thalassemia. Fifteen mutations along the beta-globin gene complex were analyzed using the amplification refractory mutation system. Hb South Florida was identified by direct sequencing using genomic DNA. The affected child with HbE/IVS1-1 produced a beta-thalassemia major phenotype. Compound heterozygosity for Hb South Florida/IVS1-1 produced a beta-thalassemia carrier phenotype in the mother.

Building on the success of DubaiSat-1 and the roll out of the knowledge transfer program, UAE engineers were involved in almost 70% of the total build and design of DubaiSat-2. Targeting the commercial market, DubaiSat-2 was launched on the 21st of November 2013 for capturing 1-meter resolution images. The 1st Cal/Val phase was the most critical phase in the satellite life-time, where most of the initial measurements took place. This phase extended over the period of 25/11/2013 till 12/12/2013. Moreover, this phase included most of the relative calibration tasks, color balancing and band matching. 2nd Cal/Val phase included most of the debugging and the pointing accuracy calibration tests. This phase extended over the period of 11/02/2014 till 09/03/2014. This phase emphasized on the calibration of the pointing accuracy. The 3rd Cal/Val phase included fine tuning for the Gyro system to further increase the stability of the satellite and thus improve the pointing accuracy. Moreover, new techniques were implemented to the Pan-Sharpening and to the MTF compensation procedures to enhance the final product. This phase extended over the period of 04/05/2014 till 21/05/2014.

The Î²-thalassemias, including the hemoglobin E disorders, are not only common in the Mediterranean region, South-East Asia, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East but have now become a global problem, spreading to much of Europe, the Americas and Australia owing to migration of people from these regions. Approximately 1.5% of the global population are heterozygotes or carriers of the Î²-thalassemias. While the overall frequencies of carriers of these disorders are known in most countries, there have been few attempts at micromapping and wherever this has been done, significant variations are seen even within small geographic regions. Thus, the figures for the estimated numbers of births each year of homozygous Î²-thalassemia and the severe compound states involving other hemoglobin disorders may be an underestimate. Screening strategies have varied from premarital to antenatal in different countries depending on socio-cultural and religious customs in different populations. Prenatal diagnosis programs are ongoing in many countries and the knowledge of the distribution of mutations has facilitated the establishment of successful control programs. Many of these were through North-South partnerships and networking. Yet, there are many countries in Asia where they are lacking, and South-South partnerships are now being developed in South-East Asia and the Indian subcontinent to link centers with expertise to centers where expertise needs to be developed. Although the carrier frequencies will remain unaltered, this will eventually help to bring down the burden of the birth of affected children with Î²-thalassemias and hemoglobin E disorders in Asia.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is potentially involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety. We carried out meta-analyses to evaluate the relationship between the BDNF Val66Met (valine, methionine) polymorphism and anxiety disorders (AD) or anxiety-related personality traits (ARPT). Medline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched up to December 2007. We investigated 3 outcomes related to BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms: (1) clinically diagnosed cases of AD; (2) ARPT in subjects without psychiatric diagnoses, assessed either by the Neuroticism scale of NEO-Personality Inventory forms (NEO-PI, NEO-PI-R, NEO-FFI), or by (3) the Harm Avoidance (HA) scale of Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) or its extended version Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Seven case-control studies were selected for AD, including 1,092 cases and 8,394 controls, while 5 cross-sectional studies for Neuroticism (n = 1,633) and 4 for HA (n = 607). Both Met/Met and Val/Met individuals, as compared to Val/Val, showed a statistically significant lower Neuroticism score [SMD = -0.24 (95% CI: -0.44, -0.04), and -0.11 (95% CI: -0.22, -0.01), respectively]. No significant association was found between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and AD [OR = 1.13 (95% CI: 0.85-1.52) for Met/Met versus Val/Val] or HA [SMD = 0.11 (95% CI: -0.19, 0.42) for Met/Met vs. Val/Val]. The low number of studies on this topic and their limited sample size, along with the inner limits in the definition of anxiety phenotypes, suggest caution in the interpretation of these results. Larger additional studies possibly investigating the interaction with other genes and environmental exposures are required to confirm these results. 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

ABSTRACT Vibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium that is an opportunistic pathogen of both marine animals and people. Its pathogenesis likely involves type III secretion system (T3SS) mediated induction of rapid apoptosis, cell rounding and osmotic lysis of infected eukaryotic cells. Herein, we report that effector proteins, Val1686 and Val1680 from V. alginolyticus, were responsible for T3SS-mediated death of fish cells. Val1686 is a Fic-domain containing protein that not only contributed to cell rounding by inhibiting Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), but was requisite for the induction of apoptosis because the deletion mutant (Îval1686) was severely weakened in its ability to induce cell rounding and apoptosis in fish cells. In addition, Val1686 alone was sufficient to induce cell rounding and apoptosis as evidenced by the transfection of Val1686 into fish cells. Importantly, the Fic-domain essential for cell rounding activity was equally important to activation of apoptosis of fish cells, indicating that apoptosis is a downstream event of Val1686-dependent GTPase inhibition. V. alginolyticus infection likely activates JNK and ERK pathways with sequential activation of caspases (caspase-8/-10, -9 and -3) and subsequent apoptosis. Val1680 contributed to T3SS-dependent lysis of fish cells in V. alginolyticus, but did not induce autophagy as has been reported for its homologue (VopQ) in V. parahaemolyticus. Together, Val1686 and Val1680 work together to induce apoptosis, cell rounding and cell lysis of V. alginolyticus-infected fish cells. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of cell death caused by T3SS of V. alginolyticus. PMID:29252102

Some high-carbohydrate diets may lead to obesity and multiple metabolic disorders, including hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). This lipid abnormality is considered an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The sweet taste receptor TAS1R2 polymorphism (Ile191Val) has been reported to be associated with carbohydrate intake. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of the TAS1R2 gene polymorphism with carbohydrate intake and HTG among the population of West Mexico. In a cross-sectional study, 441 unrelated subjects were analyzed for TAS1R2 genotypes (Ile/Ile, Ile/Val and Val/Val) by an allelic discrimination assay. Biochemical tests and a three-day food record were assessed. The Val/Val genotype carriers had a higher intake of total carbohydrates, fiber and servings of cereals and vegetables than the other genotype carriers. The Val/Val genotype conferred a higher risk for HTG than the Ile/Val and Ile/Ile genotypes (OR = 3.26, 95%CI 1.35â7.86, p = 0.006 and OR = 2.61, 95%CI 1.12â6.07, p = 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, the Val/Val genotype was associated with approximately 30% higher triglycerides compared with Ile/Val and Ile/Ile genotypes (Î² = 44.09, 95%CI 9.94â78.25, p = 0.01 and Î² = 45.7, 95%CI 10.85â80.54, p = 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, the Val/Val genotype of TAS1R2 was associated with a higher carbohydrate intake and HTG. PMID:26907331

Identifying double heterozygosities in Hb E (HBB: c.79âG>A)/- - SEA (Southeast Asian) (Î±-thalassemia-1) (Î±-thal-1) in patients first diagnosed as carrying Hb E is important in thalassemia control. Low Hb E, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (Hb) (MCH) levels have been observed in this double heterozygosity. However, the cutoff points of these parameters have never been systematically established. Here, we analyzed Hb E and red blood cell (RBC) parameters in 372 Hb E patients grouped by Hb levels, by the status of - - SEA and -Î± 3.7 (Î±-thal-2; rightward) deletions, to establish the cutoff points. Then, the established cutoff points were evaluated in 184 Hb E patients. It was found that the cutoff points of Hb E, MCV, MCH were significantly dependent on the Hb levels. In the group having Hb levels <10.0âg/dL, the cutoff points of Hb E, MCV and MCH were 21.2%, 64.9âfL and 21.0âpg, respectively, and were 25.6%, 72.8âfL and 23.9âpg, respectively, in the group having Hb levels 10.0-11.9âg/dL. Finally, in the group having Hb levels â¥12.0âg/dL, the cutoff points of Hb E, MCV and MCH were 27.1%, 76.7âfL and 25.3âpg, respectively. Thus, to screen for the double heterozygous Hb E/- - SEA anomaly in patients initially diagnosed as carrying Hb E, the Hb levels must be taken into account in choosing the suitable cutoff points of these three parameters.

Hemoglobinopathies are a group of inherited single-gene disorders found commonly in the Mediterranean region, Middle East, Indian subcontinent, Burma, and South East Asia. As many as 229 mutation variants of Î²-thalassemia are reported in the world, many community/region-specific mutations. Very little on thalassemia has been reported in Manipur, a North Eastern Indian state. Thus, a community genetic approach through population screening can be applied to the people of Manipur and a total of 602 blood samples from unrelated Meitei Brahmins (n=300) and Meitei Muslims (n=302) were screened for abnormal hemoglobins by Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test (NESTROFT). HBA(2) level was estimated by using high-performance liquid chromatography and molecular analysis was done by using PCR. Sequencing was also carried out to confirm the mutations. High frequencies of NESTROFT positive (10%) and NESTROFT doubtful (11%) cases were found among the Meitei Brahmins in comparison to the Meitei Muslims [NESTROFT positive (3.31%) and NESTROFT doubtful (1.33%)]. The allele frequency of HB*E was 0.022 and 0.012 among the Meitei Brahmin and Meitei Muslim, respectively. Sequencing of the Î²-globin gene confirmed a very rare Î²-thalassemia [-90 CâT (0.33%)] among the Meitei Brahmins of Manipur. This mutation with hemoglobin E in one of the present population hints the presence of the Mongoloid stock among them, possibly from China. There is a need for further studies on other populations of Manipur and the neighboring North East Indian states using such genetic markers.

Across the northern European Alps, a long tradition of Quaternary studies has constrained post-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) landscape history. The same picture remains largely unknown for the southern portion of the orogen. In this work, starting from existing 10Be exposure dating of three boulders in Val Viola, Central Italian Alps, we present the first detailed, post-LGM reconstruction of landscape (i.e., glacial, periglacial and paraglacial) response south of the Alpine divide. We pursue this task through Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) at 34 sites including moraines, rock glaciers, protalus ramparts, rock avalanche deposits and talus cones. In addition, based on the mapping of preserved moraines and on the numerical SHD ages, we reconstruct the glacier extent of four different stadials, including Egesen I (13.1 Â± 1.1 ka), Egesen II (12.3 Â± 0.6 ka), Kartell (11.0 Â± 1.4 ka) and Kromer (9.7 Â± 1.4 ka), whose chronologies agree with available counterparts from north of the Alpine divide. Results show that Equilibrium Line Altitude depressions (ÎELAs) associated to Younger Dryas and Early Holocene stadials are smaller than documented at most available sites in the northern Alps. These findings not only support the hypothesis of a dominant north westerly atmospheric circulation during the Younger Dryas, but also suggest that this pattern could have lasted until the Early Holocene. SHD ages on rock glaciers and protalus ramparts indicate that favourable conditions to periglacial landform development occurred during the Younger Dryas (12.7 Â± 1.1 ka), on the valley slopes above the glacier, as well as in newly de-glaciated areas, during the Early Holocene (10.7 Â± 1.3 and 8.8 Â± 1.8 ka). The currently active rock glacier started to develop before 3.7 Â± 0.8 ka and can be associated to the LÃ¶bben oscillation. Four of the five rock avalanches dated in Val Viola cluster within the Early Holocene, in correspondence of an atmospheric warming phase. By contrast

We report the first observation of Hb G-Honolulu [Î±30(B11)GluâGln (GAG>CAG); HBA2:c.91G>A] in a Caucasian family and the first case of this variant to be found in association with Hb S [Î²6(A3)GluâVal, GAG>GTG]. The proband was a healthy 4-year-old Italian boy. His chromatographic hemoglobin (Hb) pattern showed an abnormal peak having the typical retention time of Hb S (25.6% ), a second abnormal peak eluted soon after (13.6%) and a third minor peak eluted at the end of the run (6.5%). Identification of Hb variants were performed by peptide mapping using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Two abnormal peptides at m/z 765.1 and 922 were found, corresponding to the Î±T-4 and Î²T-1 peptides characteristic for Hb G-Honolulu and Hb S, respectively. The third minor abnormal peak presumably corresponded to the hybrid molecule (Î±(G-Honolulu)/Î²(S)). The concomitant presence of Hb G-Honolulu and Hb S does not seem to produce any relevant clinical manifestation.

[Perissodactyla: the primary structure of hemoglobins from the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris): glutamic acid in position 2 of the beta chains].

The hemoglobins from a lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) were analysed and the complete primary structure is described. The globin chains were separated on CM cellulose column in 8M urea and the amino-acid sequences were determined in the liquid phase sequenator. The results show that globin consists of two alpha chains (alpha I and alpha II) and beta major and beta minor components. The alpha chains differ only at one position: alpha I contains aspartic acid and alpha II glycine. The beta chains are heterogeneous: aspartic and glutamic acid were found at position beta 21 and beta 73 of the beta major components and asparagine and serine at position beta 139. In the beta minor components four positions were found with more than one amino acid, namely beta 2, beta 4, beta 6 and beta 56. The sequences are compared with those of man, horse and rhinoceros. Four residues of horse methemoglobin, which are involved in the alpha 1 beta 1 contacts are substituted in tapir hemoglobins. In the alpha chains: alpha 107(G14)Ser----Val, alpha 111-(G18) Val----Leu, alpha 115(GH3) Asn----Asp or Gly; in the beta chains: beta 116(G18) Arg----Gln. The amino acid at beta 2 of the major components is glutamic acid while glutamine and histidine are found in the minor components. Although glutamic acid, a binding site for ATP, does not interact with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, glutamine and histidine in the minor components are responsible for the slight effect of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate on tapir hemoglobin.

There is a strong etiological link between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and depression, but the neurocellular mechanisms and gene-environment interactions remain obscure. This study investigated whether one functional polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF Val66Met) modulates the influence of stressful life events on adolescent depressive symptoms. A total of 780 pairs of ethnic Han Chinese adolescent twins, 11-17âyears of age, were randomly assigned to one of two subgroups (twin1 and twin2). All subjects were genotyped as Val/Val, Val/Met or Met/Met, and assessed for depressive symptoms using the Children's Depression Inventory. The level of environmental stress was estimated by the frequency of stressful life events using the Life Events Checklist. The frequency of stressful life events was significantly correlated with depressive symptoms (twin1: Î²â=â0.21, Pâ=â0.01; twin2: Î²â=â0.27, Pâ<â0.01), but there was no significant main effect of the BDNF Val66Met genotype on depressive symptoms. In both subgroups, however, the interaction between the BDNF Val66Met genotype and stressful life event frequency was significant (twin1: Î²â=â0.19, Pâ=â0.01; twin2: Î²â=â0.15, Pâ=â0.04); individuals with one or two Val alleles demonstrated a greater susceptibility to both the detrimental effects of higher stress and the beneficial effects of lower stress compared to the Met/Met genotype. These findings support the 'differential-susceptibility' hypothesis, whereby the BDNF Val allele modulates the influence of environmental stress on depression by enhancing the neuroplastic response to all life events.

We have identified a new neutral hemoglobin variant in a pregnant Italian woman, that resulted from a GTG-->CTG replacement at codon 126 of the beta chain, corresponding to a Val-->Leu amino acid change at position beta126(H4). Thermal and isopropanol stability tests were normal and there were no abnormal clinical features. Routine electrophoretic and ion exchange chromatographic methods for hemoglobin separation failed to show this variant, but reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography revealed an abnormal peak eluting near the normal beta chain. No abnormal tryptic peptide was revealed on the high performance liquid chromatographic elution pattern of the total globin digest. The mutation was determined at the DNA level by amplification of the three beta exons by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of one exon that showed an abnormal migration on single strand conformational polymorphism analysis.

Physical training induces beneficial adaptation, whereas exhaustive exercises increase reactive oxygen-species generation, thereby causing oxidative damage in plasma and erythrocytes, fractions susceptible to lipid peroxidation. Pequi (Caryocar brasiliense Camb.) is a Brazilian Cerrado fruit containing a carotenoid-rich oil. The aim was to investigate the effects of pequi-oil on exercise-induced oxidative damage in plasma and erythrocytes, after running in the same environment and undergoing weekly training under the same conditions as to type, intensity and length. Evaluations were accomplished after outdoor running on flat land before and after ingestion of 400 mg pequi-oil capsules for 14 days. Blood samples were taken after running and submitted to TBARS assay and erythrogram analysis. Haptoglobin, MnSOD (Val9Ala), CAT (21A/T) and GPX1 (Pro198Leu) gene polymorphisms were priorly investigated, so as to estimate genetic influence The reduction in erythrocytes, hemoglobin and hematocrit after pequi-oil treatment was notably associated with higher plasma expansion. Except for MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) and RDW (red cell distribution width), the results were influenced by the polymorphisms studied. The best response to pequi-oil was presented by MnSOD Val/Val, CAT AA or AT genotypes and the GPX1 Pro allele. The significantly lower RDW and higher MHCH values were related to pequi-oil protective effects. Pequi oil, besides possessing other nutritional properties, showed protective blood effects.

A pathogenic V67M mutation occurs at the E11 helical position within the heme pockets of variant human fetal and adult hemoglobins (Hb). Subsequent post-translational modification of Met to Asp was reported in Î³ subunits of human fetal Hb Toms River (Î³67(E11)Val â Met) and Î² subunits of adult Hb (HbA) Bristol-Alesha (Î²67(E11)Val â Met) that were associated with hemolytic anemia. Using kinetic, proteomic, and crystal structural analysis, we were able to show that the Met â Asp transformation involves heme cycling through its oxoferryl state in the recombinant versions of both proteins. The conversion to Met and Asp enhanced the spontaneous autoxidation of the mutants relative to wild-type HbA and human fetal Hb, and the levels of Asp were elevated with increasing levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Using H218O2, we verified incorporation of 18O into the Asp carboxyl side chain confirming the role of H2O2 in the oxidation of the Met side chain. Under similar experimental conditions, there was no conversion to Asp at the Î±Met(E11) position in the corresponding HbA Evans (Î±62(E11)Val â Met). The crystal structures of the three recombinant Met(E11) mutants revealed similar thioether side chain orientations. However, as in the solution experiments, autoxidation of the Hb mutant crystals leads to electron density maps indicative of Asp(E11) formation in Î² subunits but not in Î± subunits. This novel post-translational modification highlights the nonequivalence of human Hb Î±, Î², and Î³ subunits with respect to redox reactivity and may have direct implications to Î±/Î² hemoglobinopathies and design of oxidatively stable Hb-based oxygen therapeutics.

Elevation of glycosylated hemoglobin above levels of 11.5 mg.% has been considered a contraindication to penile prosthesis implantation in diabetic patients. We determine the predictive value of glycosylated hemoglobin A1C in penile prosthesis infections in diabetic and nondiabetic patients to confirm or deny this prevalent opinion. We conducted a 2-year prospective study of 389 patients, including 114 diabetics, who underwent 3-piece penile prosthesis implantation. All patients had similar preoperative preparation without regard to diabetic status, control or glycosylated hemoglobin A1C level. Risk of infection was statistically analyzed for diabetics versus nondiabetics, glycosylated hemoglobin A1C values above and below 11.5 mg.%, insulin dependent versus oral medication diabetics, and fasting blood sugars above and below 180 mg.%. Prosthesis infections developed in 10 diabetics (8.7%) and 11 nondiabetics (4.0%). No increased infection rate was observed in diabetics with high fasting sugars or diabetics on insulin. There was no statistically significant increased infection risk with increased levels of glycosylated hemoglobin A1C among all patients or among only the diabetics. In fact, there was no meaningful difference in the median or mean level of glycosylated hemoglobin A1C in the infected and noninfected patients regardless of diabetes. Use of glycosylated hemoglobin A1C values to identify and exclude surgical candidates with increased risk of infections is not proved by this study. Elevation of fasting sugar or insulin dependence also does not increase risk of infection in diabetics undergoing prosthesis implantation.

A review of variant hemoglobins interfering with hemoglobin A1c measurement.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used routinely to monitor long-term glycemic control in people with diabetes mellitus, as HbA1c is related directly to risks for diabetic complications. The accuracy of HbA1c methods can be affected adversely by the presence of hemoglobin (Hb) variants or elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). The effect of each variant or elevated HbF must be examined with each specific method. The most common Hb variants worldwide are HbS, HbE, HbC, and HbD. All of these Hb variants have single amino acid substitutions in the Hb beta chain. HbF is the major hemoglobin during intrauterine life; by the end of the first year, HbF falls to values close to adult levels of approximately 1%. However, elevated HbF levels can occur in certain pathologic conditions or with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. In a series of publications over the past several years, the effects of these four most common Hb variants and elevated HbF have been described. There are clinically significant interferences with some methods for each of these variants. A summary is given showing which methods are affected by the presence of the heterozygous variants S, E, C, and D and elevated HbF. Methods are divided by type (immunoassay, ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, boronate affinity, other) with an indication of whether the result is artificially increased or decreased by the presence of a Hb variant. Laboratorians should be aware of the limitations of their method with respect to these interferences. 2009 Diabetes Technology Society.

Hemoglobin E (HbE) Î²-thalassemia is the most common severe thalassemia syndrome across Asia, and millions of people are carriers. Clinical heterogeneity in HbE Î²-thalassemia is incompletely explained by genotype, and the interaction of phenotypic variation with hepcidin is unknown. The effect of thalassemia carriage on hepcidin is also unknown, but it could be relevant for iron supplementation programs aimed at combating anemia. In 62 of 69 Sri Lankan patients with HbE Î²-thalassemia with moderate or severe phenotype, hepcidin was suppressed, and overall hepcidin inversely correlated with iron accumulation. On segregating by phenotype, there were no differences in hepcidin, erythropoiesis, or hemoglobin between severe or moderate disease, but multiple linear regression showed that erythropoiesis inversely correlated with hepcidin only in severe phenotypes. In moderate disease, no independent predictors of hepcidin were identifiable; nevertheless, the low hepcidin levels indicate a significant risk for iron overload. In a population survey of Sri Lankan schoolchildren, Î²-thalassemia (but not HbE) trait was associated with increased erythropoiesis and mildly suppressed hepcidin, suggesting an enhanced propensity to accumulate iron. In summary, the influence of erythropoiesis on hepcidin suppression associates with phenotypic disease variation and pathogenesis in HbE Î²-thalassemia and indicates that the epidemiology of Î²-thalassemia trait requires consideration when planning public health iron interventions.

Pseudoreticulocytosis in a 25-year-old female patient with hemoglobin KÃ¶ln is reported. The abnormal hemoglobin, hemoglobin KÃ¶ln (beta chain, Val98-->Met), had previously been confirmed in the patient at the age of 21 years, as well as in her mother, by polymerase chain reaction-based direct sequence analysis of the beta globin gene. The patient underwent splenectomy at the age of 22 years. On her admission to our hospital for treatment of an immunoglobulin A nephropathy, an analysis by an automated hematology analyzer, the Abbott Cell-Dyn 4000 (CD4000), reported a marked reticulocytosis. Staining by the Brecher method with new methylene blue indicated a moderate reticulocytosis (5.7%) of a lesser extent than that indicated by the CD4000 (51.1%). The frequencies of red blood cells (RBC) with Pappenheimer bodies (13.8%), Heinz bodies (32.7%), and Howell-Jolly bodies (0.3%) were increased. The CD4000 detects RBC with RNA fluorescently stained with CD4K530 as reticulocytes. Autofluorescence of RBC with hemoglobin KÃ¶ln, as we demonstrated by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy, was considered to have caused the pseudoreticulocytosis on the fully automated reticulocyte enumeration by the CD4000.

The group of unstable hemoglobins are associated with congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia due to instability of the hemoglobin molecule. They often lead to formation of the characteristic inclusion bodies or Heinz bodies. To identity the cause of mild anemia, reticulocytosis, and hepatosplenomegly in a case of non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. A 34-year-old female patient originating from Maharashtra, western India presented with mild anemia and jaundice which had persisted since childhood. Investigations included a complete blood count, screening for red cell membrane protein defects, Hb analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and cellulose acetate electrophoresis (pH 8.9), heat instability test and DNA sequencing. Hemoglobin analysis by HPLC showed an abnormal peak in the Hb C window (9.8%) with a retention time of 4.90 minutes. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis (pH 8.9) showed a slow moving band (6.15%) between Hb A2 and Hb S. The heat instability test was positive. DNA analysis of Î± globin genes showed absence of both deletional and non- deletional Î± thalassemia. DNA sequencing of the Î² globin gene revealed heterozygosity for a mutation at codon 98 [GTG â ATG, Val â Met], which gives rise to Hb-Koln. Hb Koln is the commonest unstable Hb variant reported from many populations in the world. However, this is the first report of this unstable Hb variant from India.

Background Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in sickle cell anemia patients vary. We genotyped polymorphisms in the erythroid-specific enhancer of BCL11A to see if they might account for the very high HbF associated with the Arab-Indian (AI) haplotype and Benin haplotype of sickle cell anemia. Methods and Results Six BCL112A enhancer SNPs and their haplotypes were studied in Saudi Arabs from the Eastern Province and Indian patients with AI haplotype (HbF ~20%), African Americans (HbF ~7%), and Saudi Arabs from the Southwestern Province (HbF ~12%). Four SNPs (rs1427407, rs6706648, rs6738440, and rs7606173) and their haplotypes were consistently associated with HbF levels. The distributions of haplotypes differ in the 3 cohorts but not their genetic effects: the haplotype TCAG was associated with the lowest HbF level and the haplotype GTAC was associated with the highest HbF level and differences in HbF levels between carriers of these haplotypes in all cohorts was approximately 6%. Conclusions Common HbF BCL11A enhancer haplotypes in patients with African origin and AI sickle cell anemia have similar effects on HbF but they do not explain their differences in HbF.

Hemoglobin E is the most common Hb variant found in South East Asia. Variation of Hb F expression in Hb E syndrome is associated with several genetic modifiers. We report several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including nine known and five novel mutations of the KrÃ¼ppel-like factor 1 (KLF1; an erythroid specific transcription factor) gene and determine their associations with phenotypic expression of Hb F in Hb E disorders. KLF1 mutations were examined using high resolution melting (HRM) assay and DNA sequencing in 575 homozygous Hb E, 278 heterozygous Hb E and 100 normal subjects. Fourteen mutations were mostly observed in subjects with elevated Hb F, including nine known mutations (G176AfsX179, T334R, R238H, -154 (C>T), A298P, S270W, R301H, -148 (G>A) and G335R and five novel mutations (Q217X, Q223X, Y290_S293del, K307N, and M358I). None of them, but the -148 (G>A), were observed in normal controls to have Hb F <1%. Combined KLF1 mutations with other SNPs including (G)Î³-XmnI, BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB were associated with higher Hb F levels. KLF1 is therefore an important genetic factor associated with increased Hb F and in combination with other modifying factors could explain the phenotypic variation of Hb F expression in this common hemoglobinopathy.

CoalVal is a menu-driven Windows program that produces cost-of-mining analyses of mine-modeled coal resources. Geological modeling of the coal beds and some degree of mine planning, from basic prefeasibility to advanced, must already have been performed before this program can be used. United States Geological Survey mine planning is done from a very basic, prefeasibility standpoint, but the accuracy of CoalVal's output is a reflection of the accuracy of the data entered, both for mine costs and mine planning. The mining cost analysis is done by using mine cost models designed for the commonly employed, surface and underground mining methods utilized in the United States. CoalVal requires a Microsoft Windows? 98 or Windows? XP operating system and a minimum of 1 gigabyte of random access memory to perform operations. It will not operate on Microsoft Vista?, Windows? 7, or Macintosh? operating systems. The program will summarize the evaluation of an unlimited number of coal seams, haulage zones, tax entities, or other area delineations for a given coal property, coalfield, or basin. When the reader opens the CoalVal publication from the USGS website, options are provided to download the CoalVal publication manual and the CoalVal Program. The CoalVal report is divided into five specific areas relevant to the development and use of the CoalVal program: 1. Introduction to CoalVal Assumptions and Concepts. 2. Mine Model Assumption Details (appendix A). 3. CoalVal Project Tutorial (appendix B). 4. Program Description (appendix C). 5. Mine Model and Discounted Cash Flow Formulas (appendix D). The tutorial explains how to enter coal resource and quality data by mining method; program default values for production, operating, and cost variables; and ones own operating and cost variables into the program. Generated summary reports list the volume of resource in short tons available for mining, recoverable short tons by mining method; the seam or property being mined
