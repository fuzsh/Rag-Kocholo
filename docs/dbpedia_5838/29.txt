So far the congress report label NERV as a Goddard Space flight Center project, with contractor General Electric Co.

as Probe to study energetic particles in lower belt of grant radiation region.

it was launch suborbital on September 19, 1960 from Point Arguello California

on Four stage Argo D-8 the 83.6 lbs. NERV capsule reach high of 1260 miles

and landed 1300 miles from Point Arguello in pacific.

payload

25 wafer of nuclear emulsion a photographic film extremely sensitive to charge particles as low to 5 MEV

next to that three culture of common Bread mold to study there correlate mutation in compare with emulsion results.

the probe was return to the Goddard Space flight Center.

I have a sudden image in my mind of a period-piece B-movie: "YEAST! The Horror From Beyond!"

Okay...it's gone now.

Here's a film recently posted by the San Diego Air & Space Museum (SDASM) Archives on YouTube about the Nuclear Emulsion Recovery Vehicle (NERV) launched aboard an Argo D-8 sounding rocket in 1960.
