        "text": "Public transport\n\nThe museum is on a major bus route and close to tram and train stations.\n\nApproximately 14-minute walk from Oxford Road train station\n\nApproximately 17-minute walk from St Peter’s Square Metrolink stop\n\nApproximately 21-minute walk from Manchester Piccadilly train station\n\nThere are frequent bus services, travelling towards, away from and across the city centre, including: 15, 18, 41, 42, 42A, 42B, 43, 53, 111, 142, 143, 147, 191, 197, V1, V2. Ask for the bus stop nearest to Manchester Museum, Oxford Road\n\nCycling\n\nThe museum is on the Oxford Road Cycleway, which features ‘Dutch-style’ cycle lanes. There are stands provided across the University of Manchester campus to which bicycles may be secured.\n\nFor University of Manchester staff and postgraduate students, there is a cycle hub for parking your bike securely on Bridgeford Street, next to the museum.\n\nDriving\n\nThere are six car parks on campus with a mixture of permit and public parking. Find the details here.\n\nThe nearest car park is UoM Car Park D, Booth Street West (access via Higher Cambridge Street), M15 6FH. This is available to the public as well as staff and students. Accessible parking spots on Bridgeford Street are also accessed via this car park – see our Access page for more details.\n\nThe Aquatics Centre car park is also close to the museum.\n\nFor groups arriving via bus or coach, there is a bay for buses and coaches outside the Museum on Oxford Road. Buses and coaches can pass through the bus gate on Oxford Road, providing that the vehicle has at least nine seats, excluding the driver.\n\nTips\n\nPlease be aware that there are bus gates on Oxford Road. This means that parts of the road are only open to buses, black cabs and pedal cycles from 6am to 9pm every day. If you enter a bus lane or use a bus gate, you may get a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN).\n\nAs one of the UK’s largest university museums, we care for over 4.5 million objects, with an internationally-important collection spanning from Archaeology to Zoology, and nearly everything in between. We work with communities, support university students and schools in Manchester and beyond and we are a free, inclusive museum for all. But we need your help. Every object we care for, exhibition, school visit and community event comes at a cost, and you can help make the museum as ambitious and impactful as possible."
