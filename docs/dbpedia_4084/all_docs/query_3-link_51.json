Many artists are based regionally, but increasingly we are drawing artists from across the US and internationally, such as Japan, Korea, and the UK. We take a visitor-centered approach, designing gallery experiences that invite and support public engagement with the artwork. Most works are for sale.\n\nExplore Exhibitions\n\nOn Campus Classes\n\nEducation\n\nFor many decades, education has been a vital part of Southern Vermont Arts Centerâ€™s mission to nurture the arts and continue to build a community of active artists.
