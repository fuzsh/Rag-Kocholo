        "text": "Course content\n\nOur MA Art Gallery and Museum Studies course is ideal if you are considering a career in this sector and want to gain practical experience through placements during your studies, or if you are a professional and want to further develop your practice.\n\nThe course will see you examine diverse issues related to museum theory and practice, visit numerous museums, galleries and cultural organisations, and discuss ideas and issues with professionals and academics in the field.\n\nYou will take advantage of our excellent links to cultural organisations to access a range of exciting and valuable work placements.\n\nPast placements have been at the Manchester Museum, The Whitworth, Tate Liverpool, Manchester Art Gallery, Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester International Festival, The Royal Exchange Theatre and Chorlton Arts Festival, to name a few.\n\nYou'll also have opportunities to design and participate in live projects with cultural and heritage organisations in Manchester.\n\nIn addition, we take fieldtrips to cultural organisations in Manchester, the wider north-west of England and beyond. Regular trips include Liverpool, London, Oxford and Wales.\n\nWe also run an international trip to Amsterdam, and previous students have taken part in a cultural exchange trip to Moscow.\n\nThe course is continually being reviewed and developed in response to new research, emerging critical approaches and shifts in museum practice.\n\nManchester's traditional focus on the art gallery remains, but is now balanced by course units which address history, theory and practice in a range of institutions."
