        "text": "The World War I uniform, found in a family trunk in Pakistan, is in a glass case of its own, honoring colonial subjects who fought for Britain. Nearby is a rickshaw festooned with flowers and ribbons, imported from Bangladesh and richly decorated by Bangladeshi and British artists. A large self-portrait on the wall, titled “I Beg You to Define Me,” shows a young woman wearing elaborately embroidered South Asian garments over sweatpants and running shoes.\n\nThis is the new South Asia Gallery at the Manchester Museum, which reopens on Saturday after an eight-year, $18 million redevelopment. The first permanent museum gallery in Britain to spotlight the South Asian diaspora, it focuses on the community’s lived experience: on what it means to be British and South Asian at the same time. The gallery was curated not by a posse of bookish conservators, but by 30 local people of South Asian heritage. They came up with the stories they wanted to tell, and looked for the objects that told them best.\n\nThe Manchester Museum, a sprawling 133-year-old institution linked to the University of Manchester, is home to 4.5 million objects, from coins, pottery and Egyptian antiquities to dinosaur skeletons and even some live animals.\n\nFounded at the pinnacle of the British Empire, the museum is now undergoing a rethink, led by its director Esme Ward. In her post since 2018, Ward wants to make the free-of-charge institution more inclusive, imaginative and caring. She has repatriated 43 ceremonial and sacred objects to Aboriginal communities in Australia, and appointed a curator to re-examine the collections from an Indigenous perspective."
