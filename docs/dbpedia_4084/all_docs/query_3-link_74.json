        "text": "Golden Mummies of Egypt is the re-opening exhibition for Manchester Museum. This one-of-a-kind cultural experience opens in February 2023 and is the perfect way to make your long-awaited return to the UK’s largest university museum.\n\nAfter a hugely successful tour across the USA and China, Golden Mummies of Egypt offers unparalleled access to the Museum’s stunning Egypt and Sudan collections.\n\nFeaturing more than 100 objects and eight mummies, Golden Mummies of Egypt presents a rich perspective on beliefs about the afterlife during an era when Egypt was part of the Greek and Roman worlds.\n\nThe exhibition is free but it’s recommended that tickets are booked in advance to avoid disappointment. You can sign up here to be the first to find out about tickets.\n\nThis blockbuster return is displayed in Manchester Museum’s brand-new Exhibition Hall. The star of Manchester Museum’s £13.5 million transformation, the ground floor is where the museum produces, hosts and tours ambitious shows that explore the richness of our world and our past, present and future. Presentations will engage with big ideas, global challenges and local action. Other additions to the museum include the South Asia Gallery, the Chinese Culture Gallery, the world’s first Centre for Age-Friendly Culture, and a new, accessible, visitor entrance facing out onto Oxford Road."
