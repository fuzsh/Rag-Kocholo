        "text": "Taking Stock\n\nSince late 2023, Manchester Art Gallery has been Taking Stock of its collection. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to review the Gallery’s collection, much of which has rarely or never been on display. Over the next 12 months Gallery 17 will be transformed into an ‘open store’ – a space to review, evaluate and rethink over 6600 objects, including paintings, works on paper, ceramics, glass and sculpture.\n\n200 Years of Manchester Art Gallery\n\n2023 marks Manchester Art Gallery 200th anniversary. For the entire year we will delve into the rich history of Manchester Art Gallery and look forward to its future 200 years.\n\nSupport Manchester Art Gallery\n\nLike those of the countless supporters and philanthropists who have donated funds over the past 200 years, your gift to Manchester Art Gallery makes great art, exhibitions, learning and thinking happen.\n\nPlatt Hall Inbetween\n\nWe are working with local residents and communities to make Platt Hall into a vital and creative space at the heart of its local neighbourhood."
