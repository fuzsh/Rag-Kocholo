        "text": "Manchester is a large city in the United Kingdom, centrally located in England. The city was an important textile industry city, making Manchester the archetype of a textile city, partly because Flemish weavers settled in the city at that time. The industrial past is still clearly visible in Manchester. Famous sights or buildings in the city include: the Manchester Cathedral, the Imperial War Museum North located in Trafford Park, the neo-Gothic John Rylands Library, the Museum of Science and Industry, (MOSI), the tallest building in Manchester: the Beetham Tower and the two major football stadiums: Old Trafford (Manchester United) and Etihad Stadium (Manchester City)."
