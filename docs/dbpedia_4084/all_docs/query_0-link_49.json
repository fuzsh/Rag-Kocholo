        "text": "On the day I sit down to write this piece—and I’m not entirely sure if it can be chalked down to pure coincidence—King Charles III and Queen Camilla are being crowned monarchs of the United Kingdom. Every Indian who grew up reading about their country’s colonisation at the hands of the British is feeling some kind of way about it. Thankfully, the Koh-i-Noor, which in many ways symbolises the scale of the loot the English pillaged from India as well as the heinousness of the atrocities inflicted upon our countrymen, was conspicuously absent from the king’s display of riches and regalia. And although other ill-begotten treasures such as the 22.8-carat Lahore diamond were on full view, there’s no denying that the contentious Koh-i-Noor is an ever-present stain that tinges all conversations around British imperialism.\n\nThe recently unveiled South Asia Gallery at the Manchester Museum attempts to salve some of these wounds dealt by history. The first permanent gallery in the UK to collate the often tragic past and lived experiences of the South Asian diaspora communities, it bears the fruit of five years of labour by the South Asia Gallery Collective, a group of 30 passionate individuals including community leaders, educators, artists, historians, journalists and musicians. Within the four walls of this roughly 4,000sqft space, art sheds its elitist connotations and proudly assumes a more egalitarian stance, giving every object equal heft. Among the 140 artefacts on display, courtesy of the Manchester Museum and British Museum, is a cycle rickshaw bedecked in quintessentially South Asian kitsch, an intricately woven Muslin cloth from 1855, a brick from Mohenjo-daro, a pair of tablas that belonged to Ustad Alla Rakha and other paraphernalia of historical import. But alongside these—and commanding the same pride of place—are personal items such as a leaf plate from Nepal, a set of clay cups in which India’s iconic chaiwallahs are known to sell piping hot tea, a Kathak costume and a Quran cube belonging to a doctor whose body could not be repatriated to his family in Pakistan because of the pandemic.\n\nSeated in front of a wall on which visual artist Alina Akbar’s film Pardesi Raga was being screened, Nusrat Ahmed, South Asia gallery curator at Manchester Museum, proudly spoke to me about how the community came through to convert the blueprint for a devoted South Asian art space in the UK into reality. “We were very clear about not skirting around the dark history of the subcontinent and only focusing on things like bindi, henna and bhangra. We framed this space on the relations between South Asia and Britain and used it to contextualise why so many of our people settled in the UK and how colonial rule has repercussions to this day. We had to be careful while curating the stories because we wanted to get the jargon right, yet avoid triggers. Ultimately, we wanted people to leave the museum having better understood why things unfolded the way they did.”\n\nA few steps away, a woman dressed in a hybrid anarkali-tracksuit ensemble stared back at me self-assuredly from a large canvas. Titled I beg you to define me, the oil painting is Lancashire-based multidisciplinary artist Azraa Motala’s response to Orientalist depictions of Eastern women in art history as well as the present-day narratives of otherness. If you look closely, part of the painting has been left unfinished, a deliberate gesture by Motala “as a playful reminder that identity and notions of belonging are constantly evolving and there is always scope for change.”\n\nUndoubtedly, the star of the exhibit is a 55ft-long newly commissioned mural by The Singh Twins, which encapsulates an emotional archive of the diaspora experience. Located at the entrance, the panoramic artwork by the award-winning contemporary British artists welcomes visitors to consider the complex history that South Asians have inherited through the many minuscule details hidden in plain sight: Queen Mary’s Crown (set with the Koh-i-Noor diamond) flanked by portraits of Queen Elizabeth I (depicted holding an indigo plant) and Queen Victoria (shown clutching an emblem of the East India Company) emphasise how the story of South Asia is also the story of Britain. “We wanted to create an artwork which redressed the racist attitudes of ‘West is best’ and associated stereotypes that perpetuate the image of South Asia as a backward, ‘third world’ region of poverty. It’s time the narrative of brown folks benefitting from a ‘benevolent British Empire’ and the ‘civilising’ influence of Western culture was quashed. Art is a great starting point for that,” the twins conclude in perfect unison."
