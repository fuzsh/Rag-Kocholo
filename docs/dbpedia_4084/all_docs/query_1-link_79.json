        "text": "The redevelopment includes a gallery extension to display travelling exhibitions, and a permanent space showcasing South Asian culture, designed by Studio C102 and Mobile Studio Architects with Manijeh Verghese.\n\nThe Alfred Waterhouse-designed Neo-Gothic museum was originally founded in 1821 as a natural history museum. Today it also displays items of archaeology and anthropology. Its Grade II and II*-listed buildings are owned and run by the University of Manchester.\n\nThe project involved improving the museum’s accessibility and circulation through the introduction of a new main entrance on Oxford Road, as well as a foyer and visitor facilities. The tile-clad extension sits within the museum's courtyard.\n\nThe 372m² South Asia Gallery, a British Museum partnership and co-curated by the South Asia Gallery Collective, is the first permanent gallery in the UK to celebrate the lived experiences and contributions of the South Asian diaspora.\n\nIt is part of the Hello Future initiative, a Heritage Lottery Fund project launched in 2018 to encourage diverse communities to visit the museum.\n\nStudio C102 and Mobile Studio Architects won the commission to design the gallery’s contents in 2020. Verghese was appointed to lead on the interpretation in terms of how the stories of the collective would be told to shape the visitor’s experience, with graphic designer Sthuthi Ramesh developing the 2D design.\n\nThe gallery’s palette of materials takes inspiration from South Asian design while being careful to avoid cliches and stereotypes. A new datum is created through hand-patinated brass panels that run the course of the exterior wall. The walls are painted a deep ochre.\n\nThe Purcell-designed extension is BREEAM Very Good and has been designed to adhere to the conditions required for museum collections. It accommodates the new gallery on the first floor and dedicated performance space for live performances from and inspired by South Asia.\n\nPublic engagement has been central to the project’s development at every stage, bringing together many community groups. Together with the museum’s Learning & Engagement team, Purcell led a public consultation for 250 visitors of all ages and key stakeholders to advise on the museum’s redevelopment.\n\nProject data\n\nNew extension\n\nStart on site November 2019\n\nCompletion date August 2021, opened to public February 2023\n\nGross internal floor area 900m²\n\nForm of contract or procurement route Design and build, NEC3 Contract\n\nConstruction cost £12 million, total £15 million\n\nArchitect Purcell\n\nExecutive architect Sonoe Shimizu, Purcell\n\nClient University of Manchester\n\nStructural engineer Buro Happold\n\nM&E consultant Max Fordham\n\nQuantity surveyor Baker Mallett\n\nLandscape consultant Optimised Environments\n\nBREEAM assessor Mainer Associates\n\nEnvironmental sustainability adviser Buro Happold\n\nAcoustic consultant Buro Happold\n\nProject manager Buro Four\n\nPrincipal designer Purcell\n\nApproved building inspector Bureau Veritas\n\nMain contractor Kier Construction\n\nCAD software used Revit\n\nSouth Asia Gallery\n\nCompletion date February 2023\n\nConstruction cost Undisclosed\n\nGross internal floor area 372m²\n\nLead designers Studio C102 + Mobile Studio Architects\n\nInterpretation consultant Manijeh Verghese\n\nGraphic designer Sthuthi Ramesh Design\n\nAV designer ADi Audiovisual\n\nLighting designer Arup\n\nProject manager/cost consultant/CDM adviser Leslie Clark\n\nM&E engineer DSSR\n\nBase-build architect Purcell\n\nEnvironmental performance data\n\nThe Manchester Museum embodied carbon value from cradle to practical completion was 57 kgCO2e/m² considering the reuse and reinvigorating of the whole building.
