        "text": "Britain’s relationship with South Asia is one wrapped in negative nuances. Stories of the colonial age, portioning the country, controlled famines, slavery and theft have been told time and time again.\n\nThe Manchester Museum’s South Asia Gallery, a British Museum partnership, will be the first in the UK dedicated to the stories of the South Asian diaspora. The gallery’s design will explore six themes; Past & Present, Lived Environments, Innovation & Language, Sound, Music & Dance, British Asian, and Movement & Empire. The gallery will take visitors on a journey from influential female figures of the Mughal Empire, like Nur Jahan; empress of Hindustan, through the impact of the British empire, including the trauma of the 1947 Partition; one of the most significant involuntary migrations in history, and through to what it means to be British Asian today; while highlighting further marginalised communities such as queer stories.\n\nGiven the emotionally loaded nature of stories and art to be featured, the gallery has been co-curated by the South Asia Gallery Collective, a group of 30 individuals across differing disciplines. Nusrat Ahmed, the gallery curator; part of the South Asia Gallery Collective; a group of 30 individuals across varying disciplines, spoke about the selection decisions. “The approach taken for the gallery has been story-led, and artefacts across the gallery have been chosen to further interpret the stories being told”. As opposed to first deciding themes and then curating the gallery, the collective let the artwork tell the story; “these were borne organically and weaved into the stories”.\n\nAzraa Motala\n\nAzraa Motala is a large-scale oil painting artist whose art feels familiar, and yet like nothing you’ve seen before. Her power piece to be presented at the South Asian gallery is about what it means to be British Asian today, titled ‘I beg you to define me, Constrain me in your warped ideology, Feel entitled to my identity, Project your prejudice on to me. I am more than you perceive, I will not submit to your ideals, I do not need your liberation, I am reconstructions anguish’\n\n“I explore the polarity of the East and West, history, politics, empire and Orientalist depictions of women in art, and the lived experiences of British South Asian women negotiating the position of insider and outsider in and amongst the familiar and foreign – including notions of identity, belonging, culture and heritage within the context of the contemporary Western space”.\n\n“Invisibility and visibility are key. Most people don’t know who Anglo-Indians are, so I usually have to explain that history, which is not only Indian history but very much part of British history. ‘Explanation fatigue’ is a thing; sometimes art can do more than words. This is something that a lot of mixed-race and people of colour can relate to. Anglo-Indians are such a tiny ethnic and religious minority in the sub-continent that many South-Asian people also don’t know about us”.\n\n“I make work that I would have liked to have seen when I was growing up, representing something about my identity. I hope that the work can be relevant to anyone who feels unrepresented or invisible, not just Anglo-Indians and other mixed-race people. During our initial discussion, one wish [for the gallery] was that [our] elders would find that some of their experiences are reflected and honoured in the gallery and that [our] children would learn about their rich heritage. We all feel strongly about the gallery being a welcoming space for all, not only those of South Asian heritage”.\n\n“Seeing other people’s work has inspired and taught me so much. Being an artist means taking risks and being vulnerable. I’ve really benefited from being part of a network [of artists] whom I trust and who are encouraging. [To the next generation of artists], find people whose judgment you trust and respect and who are kind”.\n\nDr. Aziz Ibrahim\n\nAziz Ibrahim is a British Muslim musician, relating his debut album, ‘Lahore to Longsight’. The title describes his family's journey from Lahore, Pakistan to Longsight (his birthplace) in inner-city Manchester, where he still lives. The album contains Punjabi, Urdu & English lyrics – mixed with his self-developed style of ‘Asian Blues’.\n\n“As a British Pakistani male (my so-called identity defined by the powers that be) born in the 1960s, I’ve had many life experiences that have inspired my art. Racism & ignorance brought about an anger that fuelled my motivation to succeed, but at the same time drove the need to make a statement of defiance against generalisation & stereotype”.\n\n“[The South Asia Gallery] will empower and include the marginalised, the ignored, the alienated, the dual heritage and many more who are part of South Asian history & its future. It will tell those untold stories and not be so ‘pure’ or ‘authenticity’ driven. Music, for me, is the common denominator across the globe that brings us together”.\n\n“[To the next generation of artists] – being yourself is good enough, your identity is good enough and equally as valid as anyone else's. Embrace your imperfection and strive to be as imperfect as possible. After all, that’s what humanity is and should reflect in its art”.\n\nThe Singh Twins (Amrit Singh MBE and Rabindra Kaur Singh MBE)\n\nThe Singh Twins are acclaimed for their redefinition of Eurocentric perceptions of art and identity. Their lived experiences as artists have inspired their unique style of eclecticism, which has resulted in a 17-metre mural to be on display at the gallery, one which illustrates the South Asian diasporic experience.\n\n“[Our inspiration] comes from our own experiences and identity as British artists of dual Indian and English descent. It’s an expression of our pride in that heritage. Still, it is also influenced by the cultural prejudice we faced as art students when tutors dismissed our work as backward, outdated and had no place in contemporary art because it was influenced by a traditional Indian art form. It was the same kind of ‘west is best’ attitude we experienced growing up in Britain, being expected to conform to mainstream British culture – a prejudice we regarded as being rooted in a colonial mindset of western superiority. As artists, [our aims] have always been to challenge institutional prejudice, negative racial stereotyping and misperceptions about cultural identity and ownership through a better understanding and more balanced representation of Colonial history”.\n\n“Museums and galleries play a crucial role in helping us make sense of what is happening around us, broadening our understanding of who we are in relation to one another. That’s what really interests us as artists, these hidden connections and shared identities and histories that have modern relevance. There is extraordinary convening power in bringing lived experience, objects, art and performance together”.\n\n“People [and artists] should ask more questions. There are so many ideologies and definitions that are bandied about, and everybody accepts them. But accepting them without questioning leads to the kind of prejudice I'm sure we all have experienced. Questioning traditions and definitions in art and everyday life, can result in amazing art! [To the next generation of artists] – art is an amazingly powerful and accessible form of communication – so be bold and brave in using your creative talent to its fullest potential”.\n\nThe permanent South Asian gallery, within the Manchester Museum, is now open to the public."
