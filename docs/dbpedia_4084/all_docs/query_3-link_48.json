After a hugely popular initial run, Turn It Up: The power of music has been extended until 1 September 2024 at the Science Museum.\n\nIn this fun, family-friendly experience you’ll get a chance to hear, interact with, and even make your own music! You’ll explore the science and secrets around the impact music has on us with unique interactive exhibits.\n\nStep into a newly commissioned musical playground, where you can play with beat, melody and harmonies.\n\nCan you tell the difference between songs written by humans and machines? Take a musical Turing test to find out.\n\nMeet Haile, the musical robot that can play and improvise alongside human musicians.\n\nSee the groundbreaking MiMU Gloves, created by Imogen Heap and used by artists like Ariana Grande to make gestures that control music-making software live on stage.\n\nDiscover weird and wonderful instruments like the Pyrophone, an organ powered by flames!\n\nFrom exploring how technological advances can make music more accessible for everyone, to the ways in which music unlocks emotions and memories, Turn It Up is an unforgettable, hands-on experience where you can feel, remember and reflect on what music means to each of us."
