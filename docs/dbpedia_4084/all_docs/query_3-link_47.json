Visit the breathtaking home of John Hays Hammond, Jr, one of the most prolific American inventors of the 20th century! Built-in the late 1920s as Hammond's home and laboratory, this STEAM Museum’s architectural style is a mixture of a medieval castle, a Gothic cathedral, and a Renaissance-era French village set amongst Roman ruins. This season, we will present a brand-new set of temporary exhibits including \"Hammond and the History of Television,\" and “Reconstructing Rome” which will be on display through the summer. In the fall, we'll open \"Natalie Hays Hammond: A Profile of Hammond’s Multifaceted Sister\" and \"Hammond and the History of Encryption.\"",

Maintaining that magic isn’t an easy task.\n\nAs custodians of this century-old museum and its rich collection of artifacts within, we bear the responsibility to restore and preserve our historic landmark in a way that is historically accurate. Right now, we need to seal the oceanside of the Museum to save our towers and the organ housed within from further water damage. Only together can we reach our $350,000 fundraising goal in order to continue our essential restoration projects."
