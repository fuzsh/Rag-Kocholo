        "text": "Don’t let the colder weather keep you in. Manchester’s museums and galleries are inviting you to grab your coat and come enjoy a variety of unique cultural experiences across the city.\n\nIn Manchester, there is something for everyone. Whether you’re looking to expand your horizons or plan a memorable half-term, we’ve got you covered.\n\nPlan and book your visits now with this guide to our top cultural picks this autumn. You can also check out visitmanchester.com/culture and browse all that the city has to offer.\n\nEnjoy Manchester’s museums and galleries this Autumn\n\nCastlefield Gallery\n\nVisitors to Castlefield Gallery will be transported to the CYBERJUNK universe and the planet Durt 1,000 years after the Quantum Crash; a botched experiment that saw the first humanoid quantum teleportation result in a disaster of apocalyptic scale.\n\nA B-movie aesthetic runs through artist John Powell-Jones first major solo exhibition. Characters from the CYBERJUNK story recur in comic illustrations, computer animation, ceramic figures, life-size models and textile pieces throughout an exhibition which takes on the form of a museum of sorts; transporting audiences to the CYBERJUNK universe as spectral observers of a looped timeline spanning a thousand years.\n\nJohn Powell-Jones’ work is informed by the ways in which dominant ideologies and power structures influence our perceptions of reality. In particular, how the warped western view of progress and success affects our understanding of morality. These ideas are explored through the use of speculative fiction, taking inspiration from European folklore, body horror, survival horror and science fiction. He aims to form a dialogue with our present and an imagined dystopian future in which the horrors of capitalism and neoliberal ideology are present as cyborgs, demons and maggots.\n\nCastlefield Gallery is partnering with IMT Gallery (London) to deliver this exhibition in two parts across both venues. CYBERJUNK continues at Castlefield Gallery to Sunday 19 December 2021 and CYBERJUNK: QUANTUM CRASH will be on show at IMT Gallery (London) to Sunday 19 December 2021.\n\nCastlefield Gallery is open Wednesday to Sunday, 12.00 noon – 5.30pm. FREE ADMISSION\n\nThe gallery is fully wheelchair accessible, including provision of an accessible bathroom.\n\ncastelfieldgallery.co.uk\n\nElizabeth Gaskell’s House\n\nAt a time of year when cats come into their own, there is a lot of feline focused fun to be had at Elizabeth Gaskell’s House during October Half Term (Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday). It’s also the purrfect place for a little bit of spooky themed crafting.\n\nInspired by Elizabeth’s own love of cats, her favourite being called Cranford, a Cat-themed Trail takes families around the house with a series of toy cats to spot. These are very distinct and refined cats, with each wearing an outfit made by the House’s team of volunteers, and includes a new spooky addition all dressed up for Halloween!\n\nVisitors will find out more about the significance of Cranford in the exhibition A Love Affair with Cranford, which explores one of Elizabeth Gaskell’s most successful novels and includes the costume that Dame Judi Dench wore when she depicted the much-loved character Miss Matty in the acclaimed BBC drama.\n\nAnd in the Servant’s Hall it’s all about creepy crafts, with all the materials and creative guidance on hand for young visitors to make either a witch’s cat or a ghoulish ghost. After all of the exploring and crafting then a visit to the Tea Room for a drink and a treat (no trick!) might be in order.\n\nAll of the October half term activities are included within the entry ticket enabling you to explore the beautiful Grade II listed former home and gardens of Elizabeth Gaskell, which its volunteer guides bring to life wonderfully for visitors of all ages.\n\nElizabeth Gaskell House October half term opening hours are from 11.00am to 4.30pm (Sunday 24 October, Wednesday 27 October, Thursday 28 October and Sunday 31 October) and entry is £5.50 for adults and £4.50 for concessions (senior citizens and students). Pre Booking is required\n\nelizabethgaskellhouse.co.uk\n\nHalf Term at HOME\n\nOn Friday 22 to Saturday 23 October, an empty lot near First St. will be transformed into The Fire Garden, an otherworldly landscape of flame-lined shapes and heat. Award-winning pioneers of outdoor art Walk the Plank are collaborating with HOME to bring The Fire Garden to Manchester. Explore the winding paths through the sculptures and installations – or stand still and enjoy the warmth. Specially adapted to this open space along the Oxford Road Corridor, a blank expanse becomes a place of wonder. The Fire Garden will be open 6.00pm to 10.00pm both days, and is free and unticketed.\n\nAlso at HOME this half term, join storyteller and musician Emmanuela Yogolelo for a family-friendly performance of Tales from the Congo Basin on the afternoon of Friday 29 October at 2.00pm. This interactive session uses music and storytelling to gently explore climate change and its links to colonialism, race and migration. Audience members will be encouraged to join in with the traditional songs including call and response, clapping, body percussion and hear music and stories from the region. Tickets are £5.\n\nUntil Sunday 31 October, children will be able to listen and learn online with Storytime Sessions: The Discarded Oil Drum by Henry & Steel, a bite-sized mini-musical audio play for all the family. Join Steely the Steel Drum on his musical journey to discover the beauty of how he was made and what he was made from.\n\nPlus, there will be free drop-in workshops based on the Storytime Sessions at Moss Side Powerhouse, Monday 25 October, 3.00pm – 5.00pm; Central Library, Tuesday 26 October, 11.00am – 1.00pm and Longsight Library, Wednesday 27 Oct, 2.00pm – 4.00pm.

Dig deeper into the museum’s collections and uncover the moving stories they tell, from people who braved shark-infested waters to ingenious nurses.\n\nOn Friday 29 and Saturday 30 October, visitors can meet eyewitnesses to conflict and gain first-hand insight into the impact of war on people’s lives with We Were There. Find our special guests throughout the museum and hear their personal stories – ranging from driving a tank, to being evacuated from the place they called home. Families can also join interactive workshops with illustrators, authors and journalists to explore how memories can be recorded in greater detail.\n\nLater this autumn, the iconic poppy sculptures will permanently return to IWM North, where they’ll be combined into a dramatic new artwork, titled Poppies. Opening on Wednesday 10 November, Poppies will cascade 30 metres down and pool within the unique architecture of IWM North’s Air Shard. The thousands of handcrafted ceramic flowers that make up Poppies were originally part of the 2014 Tower of London installation, Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red and toured to IWM North and IWM London in 2018.\n\nOn Sunday 14 November, Remembrance Sunday, a two minute silence will be held at 11.00am. The silence will then be broken.
