        "text": "First class museum. Learned an awful lot more about a game I’ve followed for 20 years. Fascinating history and amazing to see some artefacts up close. Could easily go again as I’m sure there was a lot I missed, even despite spending two hours there. Loved the different themes on each floor. Child friendly too with plenty of ‘hands on’ experiences.\n\nGreat experience for our children, in particular, our 7-year-old football-loving son. Staff were really friendly and knowledgeable and we loved all the interactive activities to keep the children moving. We will definitely be back to get the most out of our year-long ticket.\n\nModern, fully accessible building with friendly, knowledgeable staff. Take a trip through footballing history looking at the last 100 or so years and how that shaped what we know as football today. Lots of memorabilia to take you back through time and maybe relive your youth or cup final appearances!"
