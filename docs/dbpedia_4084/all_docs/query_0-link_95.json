        "text": "Want to know how to become an inclusive organization? Look at the Van Gogh Museum. Since 2017, the Van Gogh Museum has started with project aimed at becoming more relevant and appealing to youth with a multi-ethnic background - a group that before then was basically absent in their organization. Ever since, they have been leading the way in the Dutch cultural sector in terms of how to be inclusive. This collaboration with Pokemon is a next excellent example of how the Van Gogh Museum continues to lead the way in terms of being inclusive. And if you think about it, the Van Gogh Museum at face value seems the hardest place to make inclusive. After all, it's all centered around a Dutch man who lived in the 19th century, and hardly anybody can afford his paintings. And yet, they managed to become this very inclusive organization. So if they could do it, probably you can as well. The steps you can take: - Identify the group that is the hardest to reach for you - Identify organizations that are able to reach those groups - Look for ways to collaborate with those organizations https://lnkd.in/eEJfqWAT\n\nArt is as old as human history, but art museums as we know them are relatively modern institutions that have always adapted to reflect their times. No longer identifying themselves as stewards of artwork for people who can afford to collect it, many museums now embrace their nonprofit status to serve and engage the public at large. But how is such transformation reflected in museum operations, and how can museums leverage innovation to support their evolving missions? Read more: https://lnkd.in/eJ_AdjwD By Stephen Reily, Remuseum\n\nMuseum visitation data has been a hot topic since Covid. How far it dipped, how many institutions big and small went under, and when will we return to pre-pandemic levels? This is one of the most recent reports I've seen and presents the first actually-kind-of-nearly-bright outlooks. With summer coming things could bump up even more :) Granted the survey looks at only the \"top\" 100 museums, but the outlook bodes well for smaller institutions. #museums #visitation #museumattendance https://lnkd.in/g8dZWMRg"
