The Manchester museum displays works of archaeology, anthropology and natural history and is owned by the University of Manchester.

It also features collections and galleries of animal life, plants, rocks and minerals, and prehistoric life, an aquarium and a vivarium.

Open seven days a week, the Manchester museum is free to all and is a brilliant place to go to discover something new.
