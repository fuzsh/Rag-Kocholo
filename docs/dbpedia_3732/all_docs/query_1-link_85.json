        "text": "HC23157An area-based analysis of general practice fees in Aotearoa New Zealand\n\nMegan Pledger , Maite Irurzun-Lopez and Jacqueline Cumming\n\npp. 121-127\n\nWhat is already known: Aotearoa New Zealand prioritises the pursuit of health care equity as a central objective. The existence of patient co-payments in primary care poses obstacles to achieving this goal. To address these challenges, the government has implemented various schemes aimed at alleviating them. What this study adds: The sociodemographic characteristics of people in the areas where general practices are located are related to the amount charged for an appointment with a general practitioner. The strongest relationships are seen across ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation levels with lower fees being associated with higher proportions of Māori and Pacific peoples in that area and among people who are more socioeconomically deprived. The Very-Low-Cost-Access scheme appears to reduce these associations indicating that general practices operating under the scheme appear to reach groups with greater need.\n\nWhat is already known: In 2022/23, 13% of the population aged 15 and over did not have a GP consultation when needed because of cost; this percentage differs by age group, sex, ethnicity and the New Zealand Deprivation Index. What this study adds: This paper explores the sociodemographic differences in those with met and unmet need for a GP consultation because of cost, their subsequent admissions to hospital and the characteristics of those admissions.\n\nWhat is already known: Around 5% of the population were not enrolled in a general practice in 2023. This has been found to differ by age, ethnicity and deprivation; with Māori and Pacific peoples (compared to non-Māori/non-Pacific people), young people and those who live in more socioeconomically deprived areas having lower enrolment rates. What this study adds: Those not enrolled generally use fewer health services in general practice than the enrolled. They are less likely to use and take longer to access an emergency department compared to the enrolled but are more likely to use it for conditions that could be treated at a general practice.\n\nWhat is already known: Community-based primary care physiotherapy is provided in Aotearoa New Zealand through a private practice, fee-for-service model. The impact of this model on patient care, physiotherapists, and professional behaviour is unknown. What this study adds: This exploratory study suggests that competition can dominate communication and collaboration in private practice physiotherapy. Competitive business models and an aversion to scrutiny may reduce collegial interaction and professional behaviour.\n\nWhat is already known: Community-based attachments (CBAs) are mandatory in NZ for junior doctors in their first 2 years of study. Some research indicates that CBAs are a positive experience for the practice and the junior doctors. What this study adds: An estimated average cost for hosting PGY2s in general practice was $NZ4907 (range $890–$9183) per placement before consideration of space costs, over and above current funding provided by Health New Zealand |Te Whatu Ora (TWO) Health Workforce Directorate. The small business model of general practice is in tension with providing a positive experience for the PGY2s in a new learning environment, and better communication and cooperation between practices and TWO employing hospitals are needed.\n\nWhat is already known: The Physiotherapy Board has recently introduced an Advanced Physiotherapy Practitioner scope of practice. Little is known about how stakeholders perceive this scope of practice. What this study adds: Primary health care stakeholders are broadly supportive of the Advanced Physiotherapy Practitioner scope of practice. It may improve patient pathways, health care delivery and health outcomes for those with musculoskeletal conditions, and the clinical career pathway for physiotherapists.\n\nDisparities between rural and urban COVID-19 vaccination coverage both in NZ and globally have been demonstrated. New Zealand rural health provider perspectives of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout provide insight into factors contributing to the urban–rural COVID-19 vaccination disparity. Findings emphasise the relevance of context in delivering health initiatives rurally, which should be geographically tailored, culturally anchored and locally driven.\n\nWhat we already know: Culturally unsafe care negatively impacts health outcomes and further health care utilisation for Māori. Inequities exist in access to and quality of pre-hospital cardiovascular care for Māori. The reasons for such inequities in pre-hospital care are not well understood. What this study adds: This study provides an insight into pre-hospital care from the perspectives of Māori and whānau who utilised the ambulance service for chest pain or cardiac symptoms. A culturally appropriate research approach, using Kaupapa Māori Research, identified interpersonal interactions between Māori and paramedics and systemic and structural barriers as key drivers of poor experiences while highlighting areas where improvements could occur.\n\nWhat is already known: The first university-based pharmacy clinic in Australasia provides a unique setting for pharmacy care and education in New Zealand. Little is understood about the experiences of healthcare providers who have referred their patient for a consultation at the Clinic or how well the service is meeting their needs. What this study adds: Healthcare providers valued the opportunities for interprofessional collaborative practice and continuing professional education presented by the Clinic. Perceived benefits to patients and the broader healthcare system support the rationale for ongoing service development.\n\nWhat is already known: Primary health care is expected to be a part of a wide diversity of activity providing a more seamless and coordinated patient centred experience. Shifting general practices to take on more care coordination roles can be problematic. Some providers have a starting philosophy as well as the resources and capacity to be very good at this, while others need substantial support to make those transitions. What this study adds: Providing explanation for what has caused variable progress helps identify the type of support that has the most chance of success. Familiar themes of trust and power are examined in different contexts, alongside insights into what helps complex collaborative initiatives gain traction.\n\nWhat is known about the topic: Mental health challenges pose a significant public health risk. There is a need to build workforce capacity to address the mental health needs of children and youth in order to promote positive outcomes in later life. What this study adds: All sectors must take responsibility for promoting mental health in children and youth. This participatory action research study presents communities of practice as providing a sustainable mechanism by which international evidence can be received, transformed and translated into practice.\n\nWhat is already known: In various countries, health care providers aim to diversify the health workforce by introducing new clinical roles such as physician associates/assistants (PAs) to tackle ongoing workforce shortages. Numerous studies highlight PAs as cost-effective contributors who enhance access to safe and effective care. Despite these benefits, the integration of PAs into health care systems has encountered considerable scrutiny from both the public and medical professionals. What this study adds: The Ministry of Health has recently proposed the regulation of the PA profession, allowing foreign-trained PAs to take on clinical responsibilities in both primary and secondary care settings. This article examines the feasibility and implications of introducing PAs into New Zealand’s primary care sector, particularly within the context of general practice.\n\nWhat is already known: Primary care faces significant challenges with multi-morbidity in ageing populations causing increased health care demand and complexity. Optimal use of the whole primary care workforce is key in addressing these challenges. What this study adds: This analysis provides a comparison between New Zealand and Australia regarding medicines that can be accessed via a community pharmacy through their classification as pharmacist-only medicines. It considers potential elements for a successful model of care including commissioning and tools for communication and collaboration with the wider health care team.\n\nWhat is already know: Continuity of care facilitates high-quality care and good patient health outcomes. Prescribing legislation changes in New Zealand (NZ) have resulted in medical and non-medical prescribers prescribing medicines for patients with chronic disease. Previous research has established a correlation between multiple prescribers’ involvement in a single patient’s care, discontinuity and medicines-related risks. What this study adds: Clinical complexities associated with the medicines management of patients with multimorbidity and the current service delivery model are challenging NZ general practice prescribers’ ability to manage continuity of care. There is a need for heightened awareness of the significance of medicines-related continuity of care, so prescribers within and across all health settings are supported to prescribe collaboratively and safely.\n\nWhat is known about the topic: Falls among community-dwelling older adults are a significant public health concern. Previous research has highlighted the importance of strength and balance exercises and falls prevention education in reducing fall incidence among older adults. What this study adds: This study shows the potential for student-run interventions in contributing to falls prevention efforts and improving the wellbeing of aging populations.\n\nWhat we already know: Rural hospitals provide access to secondary care for rural patients but little is known about their contribution to the health system or the community. What this study adds: Rural communities see a role for rural hospitals to enhance access to emergency care, provide family support and personalised care respectful of cultural preferences.\n\nWhat we already know: Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects New Zealand Māori; however, current primary health care service delivery does not meet the needs of many. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) can support management of type 2 diabetes, although studies suggest that glycaemic improvements resulting from CGM use alone are often not sustained longer term. What this study adds: A model of health care delivery that uses CGMs within a culturally-informed program of education and optimised health care delivery improves glycemia in the short term, with improvements maintained by most for at least 12 months. This model demonstrates the value of using culturally-informed health care delivery to support improvements in health equity.\n\nWhat is already known: The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been seen as a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance, and the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical need for rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and the importance of using PCR testing for an accurate assessment. What this study adds: This study demonstrated the feasibility and clinical utility of using point-of-care test (POCT) swabbing for immediate rapid antigen test (RAT) and subsequent PCR testing for respiratory viruses in general practices in the middle of managing a viral pandemic.\n\nWhat is already known: The integration of pharmacist roles into primary health care, including general practice, is growing in Aotearoa New Zealand, with geographical variation. Recent health policy and professional guidance support further development of these roles. What this study adds: There are more pharmacist prescribers in primary health care than there were in 2018, with strong interest in future prescribing roles, yet barriers to further expansion remain. Employers need to ensure that primary healthcare-based pharmacists are well supported in their role by other practice staff and that appropriate infrastructure is in place to facilitate this.\n\nWhat is already known: Dealing with uncertainty in medicine is troublesome. General practitioners are vulnerable to uncertainty due to their exposure to undifferentiated illness. Patient encounters, especially with those suffering from ambiguous conditions, can foster introspection within clinicians. What this study adds: This qualitative study suggests that conceptualising uncertainty as a holistic challenge, and implementing a bio-psycho-social problem orientation may help clinicians manage uncertainty in a manner that leaves the patient feeling positively supported and the clinician feeling positively inquisitive.\n\nWhat is already known: There is increasing concern about the health and wellbeing of tertiary students internationally and comparatively little is known about the context in New Zealand, especially the support being provided for minority students. What this study adds: This research provides information on support services for Pacific students at a university in New Zealand including students’ response to support provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat is already known: Telephone and video consultations are widely used in general practice. Evaluating these virtual services from an ethical perspective is challenging yet essential to ensure good quality of care. What this study adds: We developed a practical ethical checklist for direct-to-consumer telemedicine services that should make ethical assessment more accessible for all stakeholders.\n\nWhat is already known: We have developed a practical ethical checklist comprising 25 questions to assess direct-to-consumer virtual consultation services from an ethical perspective. What this study adds: This study applies the practical ethical checklist to six direct-to-consumer virtual consultation services in Aotearoa New Zealand. It identifies their strengths and weaknesses in this area and raises fundamental questions on what we deem important in virtual care.\n\nWhat is known about the topic: Routinely collected administrative and health data have potential to be used for research that provides real-world health insights that can inform policy and improve clinical practice and population health. Engaging stakeholders to establish priorities can help ensure research is fit for purpose, provides important health benefits, and has the greatest potential to improve health equity. What this study adds: Primary care clinicians and academics identified the top research areas to improve health equity in primary care as the health workforce, health services, mental health, and models of primary health care. The top research questions include evaluating the impacts of annual health checks for people with intellectual disability, the role of allied health as front-line primary health care providers, and the role of an embedded social worker in a general practice clinic setting.\n\nWhat is already known: Polypharmacy is increasing as the population ages and causes harm. Deprescribing takes time and requires thoughtful consideration and patient interaction. What this study adds: Focused deprescribing is a significant reflective learning and quality improvement opportunity for medical students and general practitioner supervisors. This student-led activity adds benefit to the student, their supervisor, and the patient of a comprehensive medications review leading to improved knowledge, appropriate deprescribing, and reduced drug interactions.\n\nWhat is known about this topic: There is a current paucity of research in emergency simulation training in primary care. Although there is literature on the use that emergency simulation education has in secondary care services such as emergency medicine (EM) or for intensive care unit (ICU) staff, it is not well established or validated in primary care. What this study adds: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first literature review of studies that evaluate the use of emergency care simulations for primary care clinicians. The findings from this review can help inform and guide the appropriate education and training of primary care clinicians.\n\nWhat is already known: General practitioners find examining the retina with direct ophthalmoscopy challenging and have low confidence in interpreting findings. What this study adds: General practitioners using smart-phone non-mydriatic fundus photography achieved more adequate views and positive findings of the optic nerve and fundus compared to direct ophthalmoscopy and had close agreement for management referral with the reviewing ophthalmologist.\n\nWhat is already known: International research shows that people with migraine face significant barriers to accessing effective management. Known barriers include expense of health care and treatments, lack of or misdiagnosis and inadequate access to and communication of effective treatment strategies. What this study adds: This is the first study in Aotearoa New Zealand to document barriers to effective migraine management. Findings are taken from the perspective of people with migraine. Issues were identified in a range of areas including health professional knowledge and training, poor interface between primary and secondary care, inadequately communicated care plans and patients feeling stigmatised by health professionals. We offer recommendations to improve access to effective migraine management.\n\nWhat is already known: Older people commonly take medicines to improve their health, however medicines can also be harmful. Little is known about medicines use in retirement village residents in Aotearoa New Zealand. What this study adds:Our findings, along with new information about medicine use in ‘oldest’ age, suggest that retirement village residents may benefit from talking to their health professional about their medicines to see if they are still the right medicines for them.\n\nWhat is known about the topic: Even small prescription charges can prevent people from accessing medicines they need, leading to increased use of other health services. The FreeMeds randomised controlled trial found that eliminating $5 prescription charges led to a reduction in hospital use. What this research adds: This paper provides some of the human stories of participants in the FreeMeds study. Many reported having to make changes to how they took their medicines or making choices between obtaining their medicines or other essentials. Some reported hospitalisations due to inability to afford medicines. Few participants had discussed their inability to afford medicines with their general practitioners.\n\nWhat is already known: Respiratory conditions are a major public health concern in Aotearoa New Zealand, and are responsible for a large proportion of the morbidity and mortality experienced by Māori and Pacific children. What this study adds: This paper provides an important overview of respiratory research that involve Māori and Pacific children living in Aotearoa New Zealand. It emphasises that more studies focusing on the needs of Māori and Pacific whānau and communities, and the use of culturally responsive approaches, are essential, ensuring that aspirations are whānau centred and tailored to their needs.\n\nWhat is already known: Primary healthcare teams are well positioned to promote and protect patients’ oral health, and it is likely that more people at risk of oral disease or needing oral health care will present at primary healthcare practices. Primary healthcare teams need to have sufficient knowledge and confidence to address patients’ oral health complaints. What this study adds: Doctors and nurses appear open to incorporating oral health in their day-to-day practice. Integrating oral health in primary health care in Aotearoa New Zealand will require changes at the individual, professional and systems levels.\n\nHC23131A supported primary health pathway for mild traumatic brain injury quality improvement report\n\nA. Theadom , J. Chua, A. Sintmaartensdyk, S. Kara, R. Barnes, R. Macharg, E. Leckey and A. Mirza\n\nWhat is already known: Some patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can experience persistent symptoms for many years if not treated early. Early access to specialist services such as concussion services can significantly improve patient recovery. What this study adds: This study provides initial evidence that a supported health care pathway following mTBI is feasible to implement in primary care and can facilitate early access to concussion services for those who need it.\n\nHC23143Preferred format and strategies for seeking and trusting online health information: a survey of cardiology outpatient attendees across three New Zealand hospitals\n\nSusan Wells , Faith Mahony, Arier Lee, Andrew McLachlan, Jennie Dean, Jane Clarke, Siobhan Lehnhard, Robyn Whittaker, Matire Harwood, Jacqueline Cumming and Janine Bycroft\n\nWhat is already known: The COVID-19 pandemic and its sequelae served to reduce access to health care providers, exacerbated unmet preventive and diagnostic health needs and made online health information even more important for consumers to make decisions about self- and family-care. What this study adds: This survey asked an ethnically diverse group of patients attending cardiology outpatients what format of information was most valued and strategies they use to trust the information they find. Simple fact sheets were the most preferred online format followed by videos and discussion groups with the best ‘life-hack’ being to get their health professional’s advice on the most trusted website for their condition.\n\nWhat is already known: There is a shift towards general practitioners (GPs) prescribing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) in primary care settings using an informed consent model of care. There is a lack of long-term data on health and wellbeing outcomes for people taking GAHT in Aotearoa New Zealand. What this study adds: The insights from this study offer a blueprint for current and future survey design, to ensure data collection is responsive to the needs of transgender and non-binary (TNB) communities and health care providers. These findings will inform future research to equip health care professionals involved in prescribing GAHT with local, evidence-based data to support their delivery of quality health care to TNB people.\n\nHC23168Patient demographics and psychotropic medication prescribing in Australian general practices: pre- and during COVID-19 pandemic\n\nGetiye Dejenu Kibret , Abbish Kamalakkannan, Judith Thomas, Gorkem Sezgin, Rae-Anne Hardie, Lisa Pont, Precious McGuire, Christopher Pearce and Andrew Georgiou\n\nWhat is already known: The use of psychotropic medications in Australia has increased over the last two decades, with general practitioners being the primary prescribers. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health issues in adults and the older population, leading to increased concerns about mental health and wellbeing. What this study adds: This study estimates prescribing rates of psychotropic medication by patient demographics and found higher rates of prescribing among females, older people, and those with low to moderate SES. There was a consistent increase in prescribing rates between 2018 and 2022, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat is already known: Limited international research with Pacific Island communities has examined ear disease and hearing health knowledge and beliefs to inform health service delivery. What this study adds: This study is the first mixed-methods investigation using a Pacific methodological approach to examine Pacific peoples’ ear and hearing health worldviews, including knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of the hearing healthcare system in Aotearoa New Zealand. It will assist healthcare professionals in providing more responsive ear and hearing care services for Pacific peoples.\n\nWhat is already known: While there is extensive global documentation on the sociodemographic attributes of yoga instructors and users, along with their motivations for engaging in yoga, the specifics of yoga instructors and users in New Zealand remain relatively unexplored. What this study adds: This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the distinctive traits and backgrounds of yoga instructors and users in New Zealand. Additionally, the study examines the rationale behind yoga use, the factors that shape participant involvement, participantr methods of seeking information, and how participants communicate with healthcare providers. The insights garnered from this research aim to provide valuable information to the healthcare sector in New Zealand.\n\nWhat is already known: Screening sexually active young people for asymptomatic chlamydia and gonorrhoea is important to detect infection, prevent transmission and reduce reproductive health risks. Free online postal self-sampling for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing is an acceptable alternative to clinic-based testing in some countries, but accessibility and acceptability of online testing in Aotearoa New Zealand is unknown. What this study adds: Opinions about online STI testing among Māori and Pacific young people were mixed, but more concerns than potential advantages were identified. Equity in access to online STI testing by Māori and Pacific young people could be improved by reducing cost, improving awareness about STI testing, and addressing barriers identified in the online testing pathway.\n\nWhat’s already known: Sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) minority populations face known and preventable health inequities. However, SOGI data are not collected in routine data collection such as administrative health data, and there are limited studies exploring whether these populations are comfortable with having their data stored in these datasets. What does this study add: The research offers estimates of comfort with having sexual identity data recorded in official datasets among the GBM population of NZ, contributing to a larger body of research that primarily focusses on disclosure in health care settings."
