Core titles were identified and nine bibliographic databases were scanned for indexing coverage.\n\nResults: Findings show that 57.5% (13,391/23,271) of the cited references from the 4 core journals were to journal articles, 27.8% (6,471/23,271) to books, 9.5% (2,208/23,271) to government documents, 4.9% (1,131/23,271) to miscellaneous sources, and less than 1% (70/23,271) to Internet resources. Eleven journals produced one-third of the citations; the next third included 146 journals, followed by a dispersion of 1,622 titles. PubMed received the best database coverage scores, followed by CINAHL and Science Citation Index. None of the databases provided complete coverage of all 11 core titles.\n\nConclusion: The four source journals contain a diverse group of cited references. The currency of citations to government documents makes these journals a good source for regulatory and legislative awareness. Nurses consult nursing and biomedical journals and must search both nursing and biomedical databases to cover the literature.\n\nHighlights\n\nGeneral, popular nursing journals cite both the nursing and the biomedical literature and are important for disseminating news and clinical information.\n\nCitation analysis reveals that nurses must search both CINAHL and PubMed to cover the most highly cited journals.\n\nWhile journals account for over half of all resources cited, books contribute a considerable portion of citations.\n\nImplications\n\nIn the absence of core journal lists, citation analysis offers an effective means for identifying important journals in an area of nursing, helps to identify publication types most frequently consulted by nurses, and can provide direction for weeding practices.\n\nKnowledge of core titles can inform and support subscription decisions for both journals and indexing/ abstracting services. Furthermore, through these analyses, librarians gain knowledge of the information needs of nurses and can utilize results to promote library liaison and outreach.\n\nCitation analysis can assist librarians in identifying nursing journals for publishing and can promote collaboration between nurse researchers and librarians.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe purpose of this study is twofold: to identify the core journals cited in four general, English-language nursing journals published outside of the United States and to identify the indexing services that offer access to those core journals. The study is part of a broader project to map the literature of nursing, sponsored by the Nursing and Allied Health Resources Section (NAHRS) of the Medical Library Association (MLA). As described in the project's overview article, citation analyses of selected source journals in various nursing disciplines were conducted to identify the referenced literature [1]. This method proves to be the most reliable in determining the publication types and currency of the resources used by nurses in their professional communication. Comparisons of the results from all the studies appear in two tables in the overview article: indicates the cited formats by area of study and shows the publication years of cited references by area of study [1]. Each nursing discipline represented in the broader study was assigned to one of three publication time periods. Phase 1 studies analyzed articles published in the years 1996–1998, Phase 2 covered the period 1997–1999, and Phase 3 the period 1998–2000. This study of selected non-US English nursing journals is part of Phase 3 and was included because, as McConnell states, “in today's global society, awareness of foreign nursing publications increases our understanding of nursing from an international perspective” [2]. The study was limited to the three countries that account for the majority of English language nursing publications originating outside of the United States: United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia [3].\n\nLike the study of US general literature that is also part of the Mapping the Literature of Nursing Project, “the term ‘general’ is used to describe the popular, clinically oriented journals marketed to practicing nurses” [4]. With their broad coverage, accessible content, and reflection of day-to-day issues, popular nursing journals are an important means for disseminating news and clinical information as well as for tracking trends and developments in the profession. Four source journals were analyzed in the current work: Nursing Times (United Kingdom), Nursing Standard (United Kingdom), Canadian Nurse (Canada), and Australian Nursing Journal (Australia).\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThis study followed the common methodology described in the overview article [1] and the project protocol [5]. The approach consisted of three major steps: selection of source journals, citation analysis, and database coverage.\n\nSelection of source journals\n\nFor each of the three countries in this study, journals were selected that have high circulation figures and well established reputations for being current awareness resources. Three of the journals are the official publications of professional/trade organizations; one, Nursing Times (NT), is an independent journal.\n\nNursing Times: This peer-reviewed weekly journal marked its centenary in 2005, having served as the official publication of the Royal College of Nursing from 1926 to 1968, when it became an independent voice of nursing [6–7]. Nursing Times merged with Nursing Mirror in 1985; in 2002 the journal was retooled and relaunched to become the best-selling weekly [8]. More recently, in April 2005, NT merged with Professional Nurse [9].\n\nNursing Standard: Established in 1968, this official publication of the Royal College of Nursing claims to be “the UK's number 1 subscription nursing weekly” and brings “up-to-the-minute coverage on issues that affect your nursing practice and career choices” [10]. The journal contains peer-reviewed clinical articles, research articles, and case studies.\n\nCanadian Nurse: Canada's “largest and oldest nursing journal,” is published nine times per year by the Canadian Nurses Association since 1905 and, initially, was the official organ of eight different nurses associations [11–12]. Presently, Canadian Nurse “aims to enhance and advance the nursing profession” [13]. This peer-reviewed journal contains French and English language articles.\n\nAustralian Nursing Journal: The only source journal not peer-reviewed, the Australian Nursing Journal (ANJ) is a monthly publication of the Australian Nursing Federation (ANF), “the national union for nurses and the largest professional nursing organization in Australia” [14]. Through the years, ANJ has been an important source of news and practice issues with a focus on the industrial aspect of nursing in Australia.\n\nCanadian Nurse and Nursing Times appear in the Brandon Hill list [15]. Canadian Nurse contains the highest percentage of research articles (10%), followed by Nursing Standard (6%), Nursing Times (2%), and Australian Nursing Journal (1%) [16].\n\nCirculation figures provided online in June 2006 by Ulrich's Periodicals Directory [17] and by the Audit Bureau of Circulations for July 2004 through June 2005 as reported in the printed Willings Press Guide 2006 [18] appear in .\n\nCitation analysis\n\nEvery issue of each of the source journals published in 1998, 1999, and 2000 was examined; this was the same time period observed by all the Phase 3 studies of the NAHRS mapping project. Cited references of featured articles as well as those of brief articles and news highlights were considered. These sources of citations are referred to as source articles in this paper. The decision to include citations from all types of articles in the source journals was made when it was noted that many of the columns contained numerous references. A major emphasis of these journals is current awareness, continuing education, and airing of issues on both the professional and industrial fronts. Capturing the references generated by even the shorter items in the journals has value in revealing the sources of information deemed important for keeping nurses well-informed and up-to-date. Bibliographies and recommended readings were excluded since the goal was to analyze what nurses cite. Citations from three of the source journals were retrieved electronically from Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) database. Citations from Canadian Nurse were obtained from the print issues. This was the first journal analyzed, and initially the choice was to use print issues for the citation analysis. The practicality of using an indexing service soon became apparent, however, and extractions for the three other journals were performed using CINAHL. The same criteria were used in selecting the source articles from the print journals and from the indexing service.\n\nAll citations were merged using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and arranged by source journal. The citations were analyzed for format type and publication date. Format type included books, journals, government documents, Internet resources, and a miscellaneous category for unpublished manuscripts, newspapers, newsletters, briefs, and unidentified sources. Journals that changed names or merged were grouped under the most current title. Nursing Times and Professional Nurse merged recently, after the completion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. Therefore, they are listed separately in tables generated from a master table by all the studies. Journals were sorted in descending order of number of cited references, and Bradford's Law of Scattering was applied to find the core titles [19]. This principle states that for any discipline, a small group of journals, each responsible for generating a large number of citations, forms a first zone. The number of journals increases in each of two following zones, with a decreased number of corresponding citations. The ranked journals were thus divided into three zones, each containing an equivalent number of citations. The core journals are those found in the first two zones.\n\nDatabase coverage\n\nThis study followed the common strategy described in the overview article: to determine the online coverage during the representative year 1998 of the following databases: CINAHL, PubMed, EBSCO Nursing and Allied Health Collection Comprehensive Edition, EMBASE, Health Reference Center Academic, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index, and Social Sciences Citation Index. OCLC ArticleFirst, although not scored due to unreliable number of indexed articles, was included as a current awareness tool [1]. Every title appearing in Zone 1 and Zone 2 of all 3 phases' studies was searched in the identified databases to retrieve the number of articles indexed. The coverage of each journal in each database was assigned a score based on the percentage, rounded to the nearest whole, of the number of indexed articles to the total number of published articles. The scale used is as follows: 5(95–100%); 4(75– 94%); 3(50–74%); 2(25–49%); 1(1–24%); 0(<1%). A master list was compiled to be used by all the studies [20].\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total number of 2,736 source articles produced 23,271 cited references. In Nursing Times, 1,649 source articles with 8,546 cited items averaged 5 cited references per article. In Nursing Standard, 813 source articles with 12,207 cited items averaged 15 cited references per article. In Canadian Nurse, 151 source articles with 1,892 cited items averaged 12.5 cited references per article. In Australian Journal of Nursing, 123 source articles with 626 cited items averaged 5 cited references per article.\n\nCited formats\n\nshows the number and frequency of cited format types by source journal. Five publication types were identified: books (27.8%; 6,471/23,271), journal articles (57.5%; 13,391/23,271), government documents (9.5%; 2,208/23,271), Internet resources (<1.0%; 70/23,271), and miscellaneous references (4.9%; 1,131/ 23,271) such as reports, personal communications, and unpublished or unidentified sources. Results show journal articles to be the most heavily cited reference type, followed by books.\n\nPublication date of cited references\n\nreflects the distribution of cited format types by publication year periods. References to materials published in the same 3-year period (1998–2000) as the source journals, including in-press items, account for 16.3% (3,795/23,271) of all citations. As expected, 68.6% (48/70) of the cited Internet resources belong to these current years. Over 50% of cited references for each format, except Internet, were published between 1992 and 1997. This time period accounts for 53.5% (12,448/23.271) of the total citations. The number of cited references then decreases, with 23% (5,351/ 23,271) published in 1982–1991, and only 7.1% (1,646/ 23,271) coming from previous years.\n\nCore journals\n\nIn accordance with the project protocol, cited journals were listed in descending order of frequency of citation and then divided into 3 zones representing roughly one-third each of the total citations.\n\nZone 1 yielded 11 titles that account for 0.6% (11/ 1,779) of the total number of journals cited, and Zone 2 yielded 146 titles that account for 8.2% (146/1,779) of the total. Zone 3, which included 1622 cited journals or 91.2% (1,622/1,779) of the total, made up the remaining third. In keeping with Bradford's Law of Scattering, the proportionately small number of journals in Zones 1 and 2 are responsible for generating the greatest number of citations. Table 5 presents the journals occurring in Zones 1 and 2. Titles in Zone 3 are available upon request.\n\nZone 1 and 2 titles represent the core journals for the international nursing literature selected for this study. Titles in Zone 3 show the greatest dispersion and thus are the least productive.\n\nDatabase coverage\n\nThe indexing and abstracting coverage scores from 8 online databases are shown in Table 5 for each of the Zone 1 and Zone 2 journals. The scores assigned for each journal show that PubMed provided the best coverage for Zone 1 titles as a whole, indexing all of the content of the nursing and biomedical journals falling into this category. Although CINAHL came in second, due to its focus on the nursing and allied health literature, CINAHL did provide better coverage, on average, of the nursing journals. Both Nursing Standard and Nursing Times, the only two source journals appearing in Zone 1, received a score of 5, indicating 95– 100% coverage of articles by CINAHL. None of the other indexes came close to the level of coverage provided by CINAHL and PubMed, including the citation indexes. Interestingly, Journal of Advanced Nursing, the 3rd most heavily cited journal in Zone 1, receives less than 49% coverage by both CINAHL and PubMed. It is only given extensive coverage by Social Science Citation Index. The reasons for this lesser coverage of a highly cited nursing journal are unknown.\n\nZone 2 reflects a larger number of biomedical journals relative to nursing journals, resulting in PubMed's being the index with the highest percentage of coverage, followed by Science Citation Index and then CINAHL. Canadian Nurse (#42 on list) and Australian Nursing Journal (#83 on list) both appear in Zone 2, with CINAHL providing the best coverage for the former and EBSCO Nursing and Allied Health for the latter. Australian Nursing Journal is the only source journal not to receive a score of 5 in CINAHL.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe findings are based on the citation analysis of four journals, which conforms with the number of source journals used by all the project's studies. Although the inclusion of more journals could have affected the total cited titles and their ranking, the results of this study are based on journals that have very high circulation figures and are representative of the general literature consulted by nurses in the three English-speaking countries.\n\nWithin the limitations of this study, journal articles emerge as the most frequently cited format type, followed by books, a format that garners more than 25% (6,471/23,271) of the total. As for currency of journal articles cited, 15.2% (2,029/13,391) come from 1998– 2000, with a total of 69.8% (9,345/13,391) representing citations from 1992 to 2000 including in-press materials. The relative currency of journals cited contrasts with the same figures for the US general nursing journals study, in which currency is much more pronounced and 89.2% (2,512/2,816) of the total come from within the most recent 9 years (1990–1998) [4]. With the importance of the source journals for keeping nurses up-to-date and informed about clinical and professional developments, the expectation was for more currency of cited references. Government documents, on the other hand, show a greater degree of currency than journal articles, with 28.4% (627/2,208) of the total government documents cited coming from the source years and 82% (1,810/2,208) from within the most recent 9 years.\n\nBoth nursing and biomedical titles are reflected in Zones 1 and 2 (Table 5), underscoring the fact that nurses draw upon both areas for information. Because medical journals dominate Zone 2 and account for over one-third of the titles in Zone 1, databases that include the biomedical literature score the highest in coverage, namely, PubMed and Science Citation Index in this study. CINAHL did receive a higher average indexing score in Zone 2 than did EMBASE, however. Because nurses use the literature of both nursing and biomedicine, they must search both CINAHL, with its more thorough coverage of nursing, and PubMed, with its extensive biomedical reach, to truly canvass the most often cited journals reflected in this citation analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe four source journals from three English-speaking countries, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, although general in nature, contain the second most total citations of all studies [1]. Government documents are the most current of all formats cited, but the reason for this is unknown. Perhaps the publicly funded health-care systems in these countries create an especially pronounced need for very current information from government sources, but this is only speculation. What is clear is that the source journals are intent on keeping nurses up-to-date on legislative and regulatory issues of the profession.\n\nResults of the citation analysis confirm that journals are the primary source of information. Nurses consult both the nursing and the biomedical literature. These findings indicate that nurses must use both nursing and biomedical databases to cover the literature cited most heavily by the four general source journals. Coverage by the indexes examined in this study is uneven, with CINAHL and PubMed emerging as the clear best choices. Zone 2 results would appear to promote Science Citation Index as another strong choice for coverage; however, only 3 nursing journals are indexed in SCI: Nursing Research (no.18), Cancer Nursing (no.31), and Research in Nursing and Health (no.82). Social Science Citation Index, which does include nursing journals, covered poorly the most highly cited journals in this study. However, it ranked higher than EBSCO Nursing and Allied Health Collection Comprehensive Edition, and Health Reference Center Academic. Social Science Citation Index, with its multidisciplinary coverage, is an important database for nursing; better coverage of nursing journals would only enhance its value to nurses.\n\nCitation analysis of Nursing Times, Nursing Standard, Australian Nursing Journal, and Canadian Nurse reveals a broad and diverse group of cited references. During the span of time covered by the study, the Internet was the source for only a small number of citations; an analysis of more recent years would be interesting from the standpoint of seeing how the percentage of cited references among formats has changed.\n\nOn a broader level, this study underscores the importance of citation analysis as an effective means for both identifying important journals in an area of nursing and identifying publication types most frequently consulted by nurses. Armed with a knowledge of core titles, information professionals can make better subscription decisions for journals and indexing/abstracting services. Analysis of this type is valuable for better understanding of the information needs of nurses, which in turn improves liaison, outreach, and instruction. Based on the database coverage findings, indexing and abstracting services may also recognize the need to improve the inclusion and level of coverage of the identified core titles.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nTable 5:\n\nClick here to view.(264K, pdf)\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Margaret (Peg) Allen for leading this project.
