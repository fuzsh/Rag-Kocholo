In this article the author reviews the current situation of continuing care and gives her view of what a national framework should provide, against which the proposed framework appears to measure up. Henwood concludes that the proposed framework offers \"a real prospect for putting in place a more equitable system.\" However, achievement of the framework will depend on additional costs associated with adoption of it being met, which could amount to an estimated £110m in the first year. Assessment processes will provide the critical gateway to determining eligibility and a decision support tool has been developed to ensure consistent application. This and seven other documents are part of the consultation documentation that are downloadable from the Department of Health's website. The deadline for the consultation is: 22 September 2006.\n\nContact Details: Melanie Henwood Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: melanie@henwood-associates.co.uk |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.communitycare.co.uk | http://www.dh.gov.uk/Consultations/LiveConsultations/LiveConsultationsArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4136175&chk=fOAfTD\n\nTarget group: |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 03075508\n\nNotes:\n\nActive steps to prevention A shift towards more preventive services is paying dividends in reducing older people's stays in hospitals ... [authors: Gerald Wistow, Derek King]\n\nA journal article in Community Care, 29 June 2006, pp 32-33.\n\nIn this article, the authors present the first year's results from the Innovation Forum's older people project, Improving Futures for Older People, which was set up by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Local Government Association in 2003, as a partnership between central government and the highest-rated local authorities to pioneer ways of delivering public services. The project adopted a target for all participating authorities: to achieve over three years from April 2004, a 20 per cent reduction in unscheduled hospital in-patient bed days occupied by older people aged 75 or over compared with the predicted level. The pilot councils are Kent (lead council), Cornwall, Cheshire, Dorset, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, City of Westminster, West Sussex and Wigan. Considerable success was recorded during the first year, with the number of bed days used below the predicted rate. If the first year's progress can be sustained, the project will be a pathfinder, and demonstrate the ability of councils to initiate and lead the co-ordination of change in acute hospital and community services. This will not only improve the futures of older people but also the future of local democracy more generally.\n\nThe project is being evaluated by researchers attached to each field site and co-ordinated by the London School of Economics.\n\nContact Details: Gerald Wistow Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: gerald.wistow@btinternet.com |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.communitycare.co.uk/prtl |\n\nTarget group: LAs |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 03075508\n\nNotes:\n\nAdjusting the focus [preparation for SAP by health and social care professionals] [author: Rebecca Ellinor] (16 March 2004)\n\nArticle in: Care and Health Magazine, issue 57, 2004, pp 6-9.\n\nIn 2002, guidance was issued for health and social care professionals about a new way of assessing older people's needs. After 24 months of preparation for the Single Assessment Process (SAP), are professionals ready to put it into practice? While organisations across the public, private and voluntary sectors agree that SAP is a good idea, putting it into action is more easily said than done, and is an example of where government could have offered more direction. Some of the SAP key players identify difficulties including: obtaining commitment at the chief executive strategic level; the appropriateness of the accredited SAP tools; assessment overload; SAP in the context of the national IT agenda; engaging general practitioners (GPs); and data protection issues.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.careandhealth.com |\n\nTarget group: All staff |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 14779994\n\nNotes:\n\nAn age-old problem? A perception that depression is a \"natural\" part of old age, means many older people are not getting the help they need [author:Mike George] (1 February 2005)\n\nArticle in: Care and Health Magazine, issue 99, pp22-23.\n\nThis article considers the needs of older people in Britain who suffer from depression, which is estimated to be between 1.4 million and 1.9 million. It is considered one of the most prevalent health problems facing older people today. It is argued that age discrimination prevents older people from being referred to services, especially speciliast mental health services, when needed. This process may be reinforced by the National Standards Framework for Mental Health which focuses predominantly on those of working age and below, yet Professor Susan Benbow (Chair of the Faculty for the Psychiatry of Old Age at the Royal College of Psychiatry) urges a higher priority to be given to older people's needs and believes better support can be given by community-based health and social care services. Ben Bano, Director of Social Care and Older People's Services at East Kent NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust is in agreement and East Kent already has a local area agreement framework which \"offers an ideal opportunity to work on a multi-agency basis on common approaches to promoting social inclusion of older people who are isolated and potentially prone to depression.\" In the same way, \"SAP can be used as an opportunity to identify issues before they become problems\" advocates Jonathan Ellis, Policy Manager at Help the Aged. Further work undertaken by Hertfordshire Partnership NHS Trust is also mentioned.\n\nContact Details: Mike George Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.careandhealth.com |\n\nTarget group: LA/HAs |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 14779994\n\nNotes:\n\nAssessing patients' eligibility for fully funded nursing care [author: William Anderson, Hilary Bungay] (13 January 2004)\n\nArticle in: Nursing Times, vol 100, no 2, pp 38-39.\n\nThe introduction of free nursing care in nursing homes requires that patient's needs for care from a registered nurse are determined as part of the assessment of health and social care needs. It is important that patients are assigned to the band of care that is appropriate for them so that they receive the correct contribution to their care. A minimum data set/resident assessment instrument (MDS/RAI) was piloted on residents living in nursing homes as an assessment tool to see whether this agreed with decisions that had been made by the NHS-designated assessor for the registered nursing contribution to care. Comparison of findings showed that the assessment tool was a means of improving the quality of assessments. Further information about training to use the assessment tool and the MDS/RAI can be found at the website of the Senectus Project.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.senectus.org | http://www.nursingtimes.net\n\nTarget group: |&nbsp Type / Format: article; assessment tool\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 0954-7762\n\nNotes: see Related Organisations\n\nConversing with clients a generic approach to mental health needs assessment [author: Malcolm T Firth]\n\nArticle in:: Practice, vol 11, no 2, 1999, pp 35-48.\n\nGood practice requires mental health professionals to engage service users in a reciprocal working relationship, and good assessment underpins care management and the Care Programme Approach (CPA). Both processes can be aided by a comprehensive assessment of needs which allows workers to be flexible, and which invites clients to have an active voice in service provision. This paper examines how a structured form of needs assessment, the Manchester Care Assessment Schedule (MANCAS), can encourage purposeful conversations between clients and workers which assist engagement, and which are relevant to care plans and to review. The approach is broad-based, and relies as much on workers' use of self and pre-existing professional skills as on the written format.\n\nContact Details: British Association of Social Workers, 16 Kent Street, Birmingham B5 6RD.

However, a study of 72 people in Bristol and South Wales ranging in age from 50 to 90 (median age 72), showed that dignity - and lack of it - were key issues in their estimation of care. Their concerns about lack of dignity centred on lack of privacy, mixed sex wards, forms of address, and loss of independence. The study - which forms part of an EU funded project relating to the Fifth framework (quality of life) programme - suggested that older people do not complain about care for fear of retaliation.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.hsj.co.uk |\n\nTarget group: LA/HA |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 0952-2271\n\nNotes:\n\nEvaluation of the implementation of the Single Assessment Process and its impact on occupational therapy practice a special study presented as part of the requirement for the degree of MSc in Professional Health Studies, College of York St John [author: Alicia Ridout] (2004)\n\nThis special study (122 pp) aimed to survey senior occupational therapists across health and social care in a large city, to explore the impact of implementing the single assessment process (SAP) on their practice. The study was to be carried out within the context of national policy and the occupational therapy professional standards of practice and the local approach to implementation A 10-item questionnaire was constructed with these purposes in mind; and of 54 distributed variously to staff from primary care, acute hospitals, mental health and social services, 31 were returned (58% response). The data generated (including both qualitative and some objective quantitative data) would then allow themes for future evaluation and research to be developed which would support the profession's engagement with the implementation and its own modernisation agenda.\n\nThe study highlights risks to and inconsistencies within the therapists' use of SAP, both between services and therapists' practice. Primary care therapists appeared to be the group practising in the most-client-centred way and adhering more closely to the process principles and professional standards of practice. Social services provided the poorest response rate and highlighted numerous practice issues. The therapists generated a wide range of strategies with which to improve the implementation, and appeared to be engaged with it despite obvious frustrations. One overarching theme was therapists' wish for a more corporate implementation across the profession in the city, indicating motivation to improve the services provided by occupational therapists.\n\nThe report includes a literature review, copies of letters, the questionnaire, and data collection form.\n\nView dissertation.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: |\n\nTarget group: Occupational therapists across all services |&nbsp Type / Format: book\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN:\n\nNotes:\n\nEver ready [pilot of \"Evercare nurses\" in the UK by 10 PCTs] [author: Carol Lewis] (8 January 2004)\n\nArticle in: Health Service Journal, vol 113, no 5886, pp26-27.\n\nA model of care for older people which has helped nurse practitioners to cut hospital admissions and prescriptions through improved risk management is being piloted in the UK by 10 primary care trusts (PCTs), and has been well received. \"Evercare nurses\" are based on a US model of an expanded clinical role.

There are benefits to be reaped for residents and staff by connecting health, housing and social care professionals through the Single Assessment Process and this article outlines how SAP does work in practice within the sheltered housing service and where it sits with the assessments and support plans already undertaken. It concludes that sheltered housing providers will have to adapt their working practises to incorporate needs assessments and support plans, as required by Supporting People. To do so will help both residents to be at the centre of the process and establish the role of staff within the whole system of care management.\n\nContact Details: Peter Huntbach Tel: +44 (0)1273 293248 | Fax:\n\nEmail: peter.huntback@brighton-hove.gov.uk |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: |\n\nTarget group: |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 13663666\n\nNotes:\n\nFind the connections Social care research has to take account of the increasing amount of partnership and joint working [author: Bob Hudson] (20 January 2005)\n\nArticle in: Community Care, no 1556, pp 36-37.\n\nThis article reports on a Good practice : developing an evidence base conference held by the Integrated Care Network to develop effective working in partnership and integration.

So why are they not more widely used? [author: Beverly Castleton] (September 2006)\n\nArticle in HSJ Intelligence (supplement) within Health Service Journal, 21 September 2006, p11.\n\nDr Castleton is Associate Medical Director at North Surrey PCT describes how work in the PCT has begun to show how telecare can be brought into the mainstream of care delivery and applied on a community-wide scale, bringing an improved quality of life of the people who use it. The model of care is based on the Columba Project for independent living and is a collaboration between the PCT, Runnymede BC, Careline and telecare solutions specialist Tunstall. Two key elements were involved: an intermediate care team for assessing patient needs and equipping a dedicated short-term residential unit with telecare equipment, to familiarise patients with the technology and help to re-able them. After a period in the unit - typically four to six weeks - two-thirds of patients were able to live independently at home, supported by home care, supplemented by a prescribed telecare package.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: www.hsj.co.uk |\n\nTarget group: LAs |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 09522271\n\nNotes:\n\nIdentifying the development needs of community matrons [authors:Alison Pooler, Pam Campbell] (12 September 2006)\n\nArticle in Nursing Times, 12 September 2006, pp 36-38.\n\nThe aim of this research was to gain some insight into the needs of community matrons from both the practitioners' and managers' perspectives. Focus groups with community matrons in different PCTs were used. These groups identified that skills in physical assessment and prescribing were taken as prerequisites or essential to the role, and that the educational priorities were viewed as clinical education relating to the management of many long-term conditions linked to major causes of unplanned admissions. The preferred format for education appears to be work-based learning delivered by clinicians. It is concluded that PCTs need to ensure that community matrons have their learning needs assessed and to put in place systems of work-based learning that allow for appropriate development. Although matrons themselves may not initially see the value of non-clinical education, this will be vital to the long-term success of their role.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: www.nursingtimes.net |\n\nTarget group: HAs |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 09547762\n\nNotes:\n\nImplementing the single assessment for older people [authors: Keith V Wilson, Angie Clegg, Frances Fairclough et al]\n\nAn article in Nursing Times, vol 101, no 43, 25 October 2005 issue, pp 32-35.\n\nThe National Service Framework for Older People envisages that the single assessment process will act as a key driver in the improvement of services for older people.

A qualitative case study design, incorporating observation and semi-structured interviews, was used to collect data. Assessment visits were observed and recorded, and interviews were carried out with older people and their carers (n = 9), health and social care practitioners, operational managers, and other key individuals involved in the pilot (n = 26). Overall the evaluation found three major themes that had an impact on the implementation of the Single Assessment Process. These were: the process of implementing policy and change; the health and social care boundary; and communication and sharing of assessments. Front-line practitioners had a major impact on SAP implementation, particularly through their reluctance to engage with the process, work together and share assessments. Success of the national SAP implementation will depend on the extent to which those working directly with older people can be engaged in the policy process.\n\nContact Details: Dr Angela Dickinson, Centre for Research in Primary and Community Care, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK.

The successful implementation of information services requires attention to both academic and service dimensions, fostering closer working relationships between clinicians and information professionals.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/hir |\n\nTarget group: HAs |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 1471-1834\n\nNotes:\n\nInside multi-disciplinary practice challenges for single assessment [authors: Michelle Cornes, Roger Clough] (April 2004)\n\nArticle in: Journal of Integrated Care, vol 12, issue 2, pp 18-29\n\nThe authors draw on their study on assessment and care management practice in three localities in North West England, which tracked older people's journeys through the health and social care system, and now highlights some of the key issues which will need to be tackled if the new single assesment process (SAP) is to become user and carer friendly. They argue that the concept of the \"whole system\" is a misnomer, and a more accurate picture is one of \"disputed territory\". They suggest that too much emphasis has been placed on IT systems and paperwork, and that the real challenge is to cut through the jargon of modernisation, and to see things from a wholly different perspective. Some discussion topics to aid local implementation of SAP are suggested.\n\nContact Details: Pavilion Publishing, The Ironworks, Cheapside, Brighton BN1 4GD.

The aim is to explore a simplified model of possible information-sharing behaviours (\"ideal, over-open, over-cautious, and chaotic\") and to suggest that patterns of information sharing may be influenced by a number of factors. It is proposed that these factors include not only inter-professional differences in the approach taken to information sharing but also the ways in which the professions inter-relate.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: sue.richardson@plymouth.ac.uk |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.bjsw.oxfordjournals.org |\n\nTarget group: |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 00453102\n\nNotes:\n\nInterprofessional Mentorship: taking on the challenge [authors:Michelle Marshall, Frances Gordon] (April 2005)\n\nArticle in the Journal of Integrated Care, vol 13, no 2, April 2005 pp 38-43.

Link Age is designed to ensure older people, or their carers, get their state benefits as soon as possible; it also involves local authorities, voluntary groups, GPs and nurses, and large charities such as Age Concern have also signed up. The DWP has opened its computer system to partner organisations to speed up claims and people trained in giving benefit advice can sort out a claim as part of the single assessment process; and this can involve form-filling by a trained volunteer.\n\nExamples of current practice cited in the article are the Care Direct call-centre in Somerset and Nottinghamshire County Council pilot schemes overseen by John Hannam, Link Age Project Manager.

Harrow PCT recruited 2 matrons in December 2005 who were then trained and accredited in advanced clinical skills, as well as being assigned mentors. In the first 3 months of the pilot, the trusts identified GP practices that wanted to support its objectives and help in the accurate identification of high-risk patients, particularly vulnerable older people; and the Department of Health's patients at risk of readmission (PARR) tool was used in conjunction with other data. This pilot suggests that community matrons can make a positive difference to vulnerable patients and reduce care costs for the PCT. In a wider context, it has highlighted the need for service redesign, as the community matron role can provide both the co-ordination and supervision needed to develop an existing but often fragmented service.\n\n(Nina Barnett is a specialist pharmacist for older people at Harrow PCT, pharmacist prescriber for the Denham Unit nursing home and pharmacy adviser for older people for London, Eastern and South East Specialist Pharmacy Services).\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.hsj.co.uk |\n\nTarget group: HAs |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 09522271\n\nNotes:\n\nMulti-disciplinary person-centred care: has government policy helped or hindered?

In this article, the authors discuss a recent local survey they conducted to determine whether or not older patients exposed to health care services in North Bristol approve of staff attitudes towards them and their care. The working group consisted of the clinical audit project lead, the clinical audit facilitator and five members of the patient panel. A questionnaire was designed and given to 86 patients who were over 70 years, cognitively intact and who had spent more than 15 days in hospital. 71 patients returned their questionnaire (not all were fully completed). The audit was undertaken on two of the hospital sites - Frenchay, an acute hospital setting and Blackberry Hill, a rehabilitation care centre. In conclusion, it was acknowledged that a significant number of respondents remain concerned about the need to repeat the same information unnecessarily and they would like staff to be able to communicate with them in a more effective manner.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.gerimed.co.uk |\n\nTarget group: |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 0268201X\n\nNotes:\n\nOn the case [critique of case management based on US-style Evercare] (11 January 2005)\n\nArticle in: Care and Health Magazine, issue 96, pp16-18.\n\nThis article considers whether too much emphasis is placed in the Evercare model for the UK on health at the expense of social care.

The SAP is intended to help local agencies simplify health and social care assessments for older people. However, as the deadline for implementation (1 April 2004) approaches, many authorities are still confused over the government's guidance and funding. In Cambridgeshire, the local implementation team has piloted a paper-based SAP format used by health, social care and housing staff and then adapted it to the computerised Cambridge assessment tool. The article notes that the London Older People's Service Development Programme has piloted joint initiatives between health and social services in a variety of settings. Jonathan Monks, the SAP programme manager in Worcestershire has reservations as to the readiness of authorities such as his for full SAP implementation in April 2004. He is also concerned about the cost of commercially available assessment systems, and the implementation guidance being 'too prescriptive and too complicated'. So he is trying to simplify the process and 'produce tools that people can actually use', in the belief that SAP will 'eventually produce the kind of one-stop assessment shop originally envisaged in the National Service Framework for Older People' (NSF).\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.communitycare.co.uk |\n\nTarget group: SSD |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 03075508\n\nNotes:\n\nOpening doors A scheme being trialled in Norttinghamshire is extending the ethos of direct payments by allowing some service users to do their own assessments of their needs.

Policy on long-term conditions in England [author: Bob Hudson] (July 2005)\n\nArticle in: Health and Social Care in the Community, vol 13, no 4 pp 378-385.\n\nLong-term conditions is a policy area that has risen rapidly up the political agenda in England, culminating in the development of the National Health Service and Social Care Model in 2005, which is to be implemented over the following 2 years. The Model draws heavily upon US ideas of case management and proposes the creation of 3000 community matrons to undertake this role with the most vulnerable patients. Although welcomed in principle, the specific proposals in the Model have been subject to some criticism, and these issues are explored in this paper. The problematic areas include patient identification, transplanting US models to England, the role of case management, workforce and funding issues and the mix of medical and social models. The author concludes that there is a danger of long-term care policy developing an unduly health-focused approach at a time when the thrust of partnership working is towards an inclusive, whole-system model.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: bob.hudson@durham.ac.uk |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: |\n\nTarget group: |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 09660410\n\nNotes:\n\nSenior and heard a programme to address the social as well as medical needs of old people has given a shot in the arm to London boroughs, as national service framework targets loom [author: Mary-Louise Harding ] (12 February 2004)\n\nArticle in: Health Service Journal, vol 114, no 5892, pp32-33.\n\nA service development programme is helping London boroughs meet deadlines for national service frameworks for older people.

In this period, various efforts were taken to ascertain views, comments and concerns about the policy thoughout the Trust and local primary care services. On the whole, implementation of this policy has been successful and considerably less problematic than anticipated. However, care needs to be taken though in the language used and sensitivity needs to be employed when relaying new information or diagnosis.

The study was conducted in two social service departments (SSDs) with 384 subjects aged 65+ meeting these criteria. The authors outline methods used and discuss the results. They find that use of a well-developed standardised assessment (the MDS-HC) was associated with much better coverage of key domains than that of existing assessment instruments: it is likely that the instrument's characteristics were the key to better auditable results. They note that MDS-HC took no longer to use than existing assessments, and conclude that assessment methods of unproven reliability and validity may jeopardise the interests of older people and the need to raise assessment standards.\n\nContact Details: Pavilion, Richmond House, Richmond Road, Brighton, East Sussex BN2 3RL.

While this should include hospitals, the authors note that local progress on the SAP has generally only been made in the community. A joint St Helens and Knowsley Older People's Service collaborative project with Whiston and St Helens Hospitals seeks to improve older people's experience of hospital care and discharge through implementing single assessment. This is one of 10 collaborative projects in the north-west, which tackles various aspects of the National Service Framework for Older People (NSF). The authors outline how single assessment in an acute hospital has been implemented alongside that in the community, which will not only ensure continuity but also reduces the number of times older people are asked for information.\n\nContact Details: Pavilion Publishing, The Ironworks, Cheapside, Brighton BN1 4GD.

The single assessment process was specified as the way forward in the government's National Service Framework for Older People, but councils in the South West (Cornwall, Devon, Torbay and Plymouth along with NHS agencies) have extended it to apply to all adults with health and social care needs. The process is aimed at simplifying assessments, reducing duplication and empowering service users to a far greater extent than before. It also allows for sharing of information between professionals working for different agencies, once the consent of the service user has been gained. This brief article outlines how the South West has achieved this using champions across the organisations and running group events that were funded by the Modernisation Agency for all stakeholders. The collaboration hopes to sign a contract with an IT supplier in the next few months and launch the e-SAP in early 2007.

The PCT started by analysing data (using the Evercare caseload model) to find \"frequent fliers\" in the previous year and found 2000 such patients. The PCT looked at four categories of long-term condition and found a locally significant cohort of patients who would often turn up at A&E, worried about their symptoms, through lack of immediate advice and support. Capacity was identified within the existing community nursing workloads and the roles of 11 district nurses and two practice nurses were redesigned to manage caseloads. The project was officially launched in December 2004. There are now 15 community matrons with caseloads of 40-50 patients. A second phase of the project is to introduce four new roles of associate community matron, who will concentrate on the frequent fliers with a cancer diagnosis.\n\nAt the same time of developing community matrons, the PCT developed a £1m pilot scheme involving 275 people with chronic illnesses which began in 2006. It will be the most widespread technology in the country and will be subject to an academic study to ensure the benefits are properly evaluated. It is technology that has been developed in the US as TeleHealth technology with some success since 2003, initially in Seattle with people living in nursing homes. It is hoped that such success can be replicated in the PCT but much will depend on the community matrons and management of their caseloads.\n\nContact Details: Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.hsj.co.uk |\n\nTarget group: HAs |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 09522271\n\nNotes:\n\nThe assessment gap [comment on the single assessment process] [author: Paul Clarkson, David Challis] (15 July 2004)\n\nArticle in: Community Care, no 1531, pp 38-39.\n\nThe authors, from PSSRU at University of Manchester, are investigating the implementation and impact of SAP in England.

Standard 2 of the NSF, on person-centred care, states that \"the NHS and social services treat older people as individuals and enable them to make choices about their own care\". This is achieved through the single assessment process (SAP), integrating commissioning arrangements and integrated provision of services. The paper analyses the SAP's key elements and suggests approaches to be adopted, some of which are based on workshops with local stakeholders from a number of authorities.

Independence and well-being animate these developments and are evident in the emphasis on person-centred services within the single assessment process for older people. Drawing on a feasibiilty study of SAP as a \"case-finding\" approach, this paper presents findings drawn from older people's accounts of this experience. These accounts indicate the potential of the process for identifying \"low-level\" need, whilst raising issues of access to formal services and resource constraint; also they underline the importance of understanding how older people seek ways of managing their own health and well-being, whilst continuing to contribute to the social cohesion of society by providing support to their peers and to younger generations. Interdependence, it is suggested, rather than dependence should underlie any approach to assessing older people's needs, if we are to appreciate and build upon the complexity of older people's strategies for actively managing their lives.\n\nContact Details: Jackie Powell Tel: | Fax:\n\nEmail: J.M.Powell@soton.ac.uk |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: htttp://www.bjsw.oxfordjournals.org |\n\nTarget group: |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 00453102\n\nNotes:\n\nThe Single Assessment Process (SAP) : a personal perspective [author: Nicky Bradbury] (January 2006)\n\nBrief article in PSIGE Newsletter, January 2006, pp 39-40.\n\nPSIGE is the Psychologists' Special Interest Group Working with Older People, within the Division of Clinical Psychology of the British Psychological Society.

This study by the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) provides a unique picture of the range and prevalence of standardised scales used within old age psychiatry services in England and Northern Ireland, reported by 73% of old age psychiatrists. Most services (64%) used three or more standardised assessment scales (range 1-12). 62 separate instruments were identified. The six most used measures were the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE, 95%), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS, 52%) and the Clock Drawing (50%), the Clifton Assessment Procedures for the elderly 26%), the Barthel Index (18%), and the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales (HoNOS65+, 18%). Shared documentation, along with other indicators of integration between health and social care were associated with greater use of standardised scales. The provision of a memory clinic was associated with greater use of neuropsychiatric scales and lower levels of use of cognitive scales. These results provide key material for shaping the provision of psychiatric services for older people.\n\nContact Details: Dr Siobhan Reilly, Research Fellow, PSSRU at Manchester, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing, University of Manchester, 1st Floor, Dover Street Building, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL Tel: +44 (0)161 275 5680 | Fax: +44 (0)161 275 5790\n\nEmail: Siobhan.reilly@man.ac.uk |&nbsp\n\nWeb links: http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals | http://www.pssru.ac.uk/manchester.htm\n\nTarget group: MHTs, SAP Leads |&nbsp Type / Format: article\n\nAvailability / Price: |&nbsp ISBN/ISSN: 1360-7863\n\nNotes:\n\nUnited front [joint working and implications for IT systems] [author: Steve Mathieson]\n\nAn article in the Health Service Journal supplement \"HSJ Intelligence\" within the 3 November 2005 issue, pp4-7.\n\nThe key point made in this article highlights that joint working in IT between health and social services and local authorities remains difficult, with technical and organisational barriers.

As a profession, the author writes, we have become disenfranchised and cannot afford to rest on our laurels. Professional identity is placed at risk only if we let it. As we move towards integration, the validity of the social care perspective becomes ever more vital in the switch to person-centred care.

These are: rooting out age discrimination; person-centred care; intermediate care; general hospital care; stroke; falls; mental health for older people; and the promotion of health and active life in older age. The main report also describes how it is expected that the NSF will be delivered locally; and sets out \"milestones\", performance measures for assessing progress, and programmes supporting implementation. Most older people take prescribed medicines as part of their treatment; the medicines document describes how the use of medicines for and by older people can be improved. The executive summary outlines the eight standards and milestones. The NSF has been developed from advice of an External Reference Group (ERG), co-chaired by Ian Philp and Denise Platt, Chief Inspector, Social Services Inspectorate (SSI), supported by nine task groups examining different aspects of older people's health care.\n\nContact Details: Department of Health, PO Box 777, London SE1 6XH.

Much of the guidance in this document (107pp) can also apply to anyone living with a long-term condition. The quality requirements are: a person-centred service; early recognition, prompt diagnosis and treatment; emergency and acute management; early and specialist rehabilitation; community rehabilitation and support; vocational rehabilitation; providing equipment and accommodation; providing personal care and support; palliative care; supporting family and carers; and caring for people with neurological conditions in hospital or other health and social care settings. This NSF is supported by a web-based NSF good practice guide, an NSF information strategy"
