        "text": "Fed up with writing bad things, so thought I’d start some life history – in reverse order.\n\nGives the game away about my false identity to the left!\n\nLos Gigantes, Tenerife\n\n1986 – 1990 – All that publicity about being sacked might bring benefits in avoiding an Employment Tribunal but it makes one almost unemployable. But there’s an easy solution – take off to sunnier climes to manage the sales and marketing operation of a property company. No chance of a depressive episode in the sun!\n\nTouching note – handwritten by my two ‘main men’ – John Marrison and Geoff Selvidge – both in line for my job. Tucked in a box, where it couldn’t be seen when I cleared desk\n\nFirst example of the stigma of mental illness – sacked just before discharged for what was then known as ‘Executive Burnout’ – a better term?\n\nCall from reception at The Priory, Roehampton asking me to collect card from employer – she was nearly right – it was not a card (as in get well) it was my cards.\n\nJust to make sure, they posted copy to home so wife knew before I could call her next day.\n\nConsultant, Dr Desmond Kelly, came straight to room on arrival (the ward sister told him) expecting me to be in meltdown again – found me raring to go with a solicitor already instructed!\n\nIncidentally, ‘Motor Cycle News‘ and ‘Motoring News‘ (see below ‘Meet The People’ ) were EMAP publications when EMAP represented consumer interests. These titles are now owned respectively by Bauer Media Group and Haymarket Media Group.\n\nEMAP has the same name but not the same ownership and management that now produces incestuous publications like the Nursing Times and Health Service Journal.\n\nBut at least EMAP is honest:\n\n“Our purpose is to connect professional communities and inspire them to know, to grow, progress and win. Brands such as HSJ and Retail Week create deep relationships and unparalleled reach, to increase value for our customers.”\n\nRef: incestuous [OED 7th ed, definition 2]\n\nMotorCycle International – January 1986 edition – Babs Ryan – Marketing Manager at Kawasaki. Massive effort needed in those days to persuade my Japanese Directors to promote a woman to a ‘Manager’ position.\n\n1984 – From Roehampton Priory to London nightclub to receive ‘Motorcycle News’ Machine of the Year 1983 – and back to the Priory. Would an NHS hospital allow this?\n\n1981 Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, Akashinear Kobe, Japan – As Senior Manager, Sales & Marketing, Kawasaki Motors UK Ltd – with leading UK dealers.\n\n1980 – I don’t know how the word ‘partner’ – referring to the driver – would be interpreted 25 years later and … did I really wear that jacket!\n\nThe end – 100 mph plus on an old airfield stage – the engine was fine but wheels would have helped!\n\nNear the end of motor sport.\n\nSomewhere in UK before 1974 petrol crisis.\n\nBlind brow – who had most confidence in the map reading?\n\n1973 – with Linda Hooks, Miss International 1972\n\n1972? – RAC International Rally for Dealer Team Skoda.\n\n1972 – with Marilyn Ward, Miss United Kingdom 1971, 1st runner-up Miss World\n\nThat’s early enough – I’m beginning to date myself."
