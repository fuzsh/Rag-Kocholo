Submissions describing methods, software, databases, or other tools that meet the journal’s criteria for advance, utility, validation, and availability are also welcomed.\n\nContents\n\nPLOS Digital Health features engaging primary Research Articles, and Reviews, Opinions, and Editorials.\n\nCriteria for Publication\n\nTo be considered for publication in PLOS Digital Health, any given manuscript must satisfy the following criteria:\n\nOriginality\n\nHigh importance and broad interest to community of researchers, engineers and clinicians working in the field of digital health\n\nHigh methodological rigor and ethical standards\n\nSubstantial evidence for its conclusions\n\nClearly outlined utility and accessibility for the broader community\n\nFollow appropriate standards and practice of open science\n\nConsideration of complementary research\n\nScientists commonly refer to research as “scooped” when independent groups working on the same topic reach similar conclusions and one group publishes the results first. Although originality is one criterion for studies published in PLOS Digital Health, “scooped” manuscripts that confirm, replicate, extend, or are complementary to a recently published, significant advance are still eligible for consideration in PLOS Digital Health. The complementary manuscript must present equally or more rigorous findings than the published study and any submission must also meet the criteria for publication listed above. Authors of the complementary work have six months after the first article’s publication date to submit their manuscript to PLOS Digital Health. Studies must be performed comprehensively, and preliminary placeholder studies will not be considered.\n\nEditorial Oversight\n\nPLOS Digital Health is run by an international Editorial Board, headed by the Editor-in-Chief and supported by the Managing Editor.\n\nEditor-in-Chief\n\nLeo Anthony Celi\n\nEditorial Board\n\nView the PLOS Digital Health Editorial Board.\n\nSubmit Your Manuscript\n\nFor more information about submitting to PLOS Digital Health, read our guidelines for preparing a submission.\n\nPublication Fees\n\nPLOS employs several business models to support equitable Open Access. A full list of our publication fees, funding initiatives and fee assistance information is available here.\n\nOpen Access\n\nPLOS applies the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license to works we publish. Under this license, authors agree to make articles legally available for reuse, without permission or fees, for virtually any purpose. Anyone may copy, distribute, or reuse these articles, as long as the author and original source are properly cited. Learn more.\n\nJournal Impact and Article Metrics\n\nPLOS does not consider Impact Factor to be a reliable or useful metric to assess the performance of individual articles. PLOS supports DORA – the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment – and does not promote our journal Impact Factors. We will provide the metric to individuals when specifically requested.\n\nRead more about our pledge with DORA.\n\nPLOS promotes the use of Article-Level Metrics (ALMs), which enable scientists and the general public to engage more dynamically with published research. ALMs reflect the changing impact of research over time, incorporate academic as well as social impacts of research, and assess the impact of research before the accrual of academic citations. Read more about ALMs.\n\nIndexing and Archiving\n\nTo ensure research is widely accessible and discoverable, PLOS submits all of our titles to major indexing services for evaluation as soon as possible according to the schedule of the specific service. PLOS Digital Health began publishing its first articles in January 2022 and is currently indexed by the services listed below:\n\nCABI Global Health, CAPES, CNKI, Dimensions, DOAJ, EconBiz, Google Scholar, J-Global, PubMed, PubMed Central and Scopus.\n\nWe are continuing to work with services such as Web of Science and MEDLINE, and will update the list above as soon as the journal is indexed.\n\nSee publishing details for all PLOS journal titles, including ISSN and indexing and archiving information.\n\nPLOS\n\nPLOS is a nonprofit, Open Access publisher empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication."
