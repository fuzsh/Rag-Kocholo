        "text": "The Journal of American College Health is the only scholarly publication devoted entirely to college students’ health.\n\nPublished bi-monthly by Taylor & Francis Group in cooperation with ACHA, this prize-winning journal covers developments and research in this broad field, including clinical and preventive medicine, health promotion, environmental health and safety, nursing assessment, interventions, management, pharmacy, and sports medicine. The journal regularly publishes major articles on student behaviors, mental health, and health care policies and includes a section for discussion of controversial issues.\n\nAuthorized ACHA members will receive an emailed link to access JACH online, as well as full access to the journal’s archives. An additional fee applies if you would like to receive mailed hard copy issues of the journal. Please check with your member representative if you are at a member school to see if all complimentary journal slots have been filled. If available, they can add you to the online journal list via the Roster Manager for free. Otherwise, there is a small fee.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nThe Journal of American College Health is a subscription-based, peer-reviewed journal that provides information related to health and well-being in institutions of higher education in the United States. The journal publishes articles encompassing many areas of this broad field, including clinical and preventive medicine, environmental and community health and safety, health promotion and education, management and administration, mental health, nursing, pharmacy, and sports medicine. International submissions will be considered for innovative work in college health that has an application to institutions of higher education in the United States.\n\nThe Journal of American College Health is intended for college health professionals: administrators, health educators, nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians, physician assistants, professors, psychologists, social workers, counselors, mental health professionals, health promotion professionals, student affairs personnel, and students as peer educators, consumers, and pre-professionals.\n\nTo learn more about the JACH, view the aims & scope\n\nSee below for more information on submitting a manuscript. When you are ready, submit your manuscript here.\n\nSubmissions\n\nInstructions for Authors\n\nOnline submission website\n\nCase Reports\n\nThe Journal of American College Health seeks to publish cases with clinically valuable lessons for college health professionals. Therefore, we encourage submissions that outline cases which present a diagnostic, ethical, or management challenge, or that highlight aspects of mechanisms of injury, pharmacology, or histopathology that are deemed of particular educational value for college health professionals. These papers are limited in length to 2,000 words (excluding the title page, abstract, acknowledgments, references, tables, and figures).\n\nCase Reports may address, but are not limited to:\n\nImportant clinical lessons learned from practice\n\nEmerging pathogenesis pertinent to college health\n\nLessons learned from practice\n\nRare conditions\n\nNovel diagnostic criteria or measurement practices\n\nPlease consult the journal’s Instructions for Authors for full submissions requirements.\n\nBrief Reports\n\nBrief Reports may fall into one of two categories:\n\nDescribe new methods, techniques, or topics of general interest to the field of college health\n\nPresent the results of experiments/investigations that can be concisely reported with up to one table or figure.\n\nThese papers are limited in length to 2,000 words (excluding the title page, abstract, acknowledgments, references, tables, and figures). Overall, Brief Reports are intended to highlight interesting findings that do not warrant the space required of an original article.\n\nViewpoint\n\nViewpoint is a forum for opinions. Topics may be ethical, organizational, social, professional, or economic. Debate on controversial subjects is welcome. Manuscripts vary from 4 to 10 pages (1,000–2,500 words), but we prefer concise presentations. Tables and figures are unnecessary. References should follow the same format as that used in major articles.\n\nAdvertising\n\nContact Jeff Leonard.\n\nPermission Requests\n\nContact Taylor and Francis Permissions Department.\n\nOther Inquiries\n\nJACH Managing Editor: Melody Harris\n\nAssociate Editor: Larry Olsen\n\nJACH Cover Photos: A Showcase of Student Health and Wellness Centers\n\nFrom 2006-2020, a student health or wellness center was pictured on the cover of each issue of the journal, along with a written description of the facility, including services provided, something about how it came to be built or fits into campus life, architectural facts, its history, etc. JACH Photo Editor Ted W. Grace, MD, MPH, former director of Student Health Services at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, led this project and solicited contributions from campuses everywhere. As the JACH moved to a primarily digital publication, the cover series was retired.\n\nPlease explore these covers here:"
