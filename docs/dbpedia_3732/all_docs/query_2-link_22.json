        "text": "A literature search is a well thought out and organised search for all of the literature published on a topic. A well-structured literature search is the most effective and efficient way to locate sound evidence on the subject you are researching. Evidence may be found in books, journals, government documents and the internet. This article describes the key principles involved in conducting a literature search.\n\nHarvard, L. (2007) How to conduct an effective and valid literature search. This is an extended version of the article published in Nursing Times; 103: 45, 32-33.\n\nLori Havard BSc, MLS, is subject librarian, School of Health Science and School of Medicine, Swansea University\n\nA literature search is a well thought out and organised search for all of the literature published on a topic. A well-structured literature search is the most effective and efficient way to locate sound evidence on the subject you are researching. Evidence may be found in books, journals, government documents and the internet.\n\nCreating a question\n\nCreating a well-focused question is the first step in a literature search. Having a clear idea of what you are researching will keep you on track with your searching, saving you valuable time. A focused question will give you a better start with your search because it will help you determine appropriate keywords and limitations for your topic.\n\nWhen forming your question, make sure you are specific about your research topic. Things to consider are:\n\nThe type of patient;\n\nThe condition or situation you are researching;\n\nThe type of intervention or nursing procedure you are investigating.\n\nThis is a good time also to determine limitations to your search, such as:\n\nHow many years you want to go back in the literature; you may want to limit the years to make the search more manageable or clinically up to date, while capturing key information for your research.;\n\nLanguage: are you limiting the search to sources in the English language?\n\nGeographical specifity, for example, limited to the UK or EU or to include international literature.\n\nSources of information\n\nInformation can come from many sources, in print or electronically.\n\nBooks\n\nBooks can be a good start on a topic, giving you general or specific information. Check that the book you are referring to is up to date – generally, this means published within the last five years – especially if you are looking for clinical or drug information.\n\nYou can find books on your area of research in an academic or healthcare library. Consult with the librarian to help you find any books that you need.\n\nJournals\n\nJournal articles are one of the best sources of information as they can be selected for being current and specific. Additionally, most of the important and ground-breaking research is published in journals. Journal articles are best found using citation databases, such as BNI and CINAHL.\n\nYour search strategy can be used in all databases. Each database has some unique searching features. Your local library may hold sessions on how to search these databases or have guides to help you get started. Many databases have help screens or tutorials to help you familiarise yourself with their searching interface.\n\nThere are many types of articles and you need to be aware of the differences:\n\nResearch articles, including systematic reviews, are the best source of evidence;\n\nReview articles give a summary of research articles on a topic;\n\nCommentaries and opinion pieces can include interpretations on research or letters to the editor and editorials;\n\nCase studies are a type of research that focuses on one person or situation, as opposed to a group of studies.\n\nIt is important to look for research in peer-reviewed journals. This means that the articles published have passed through peer critiquing before they are accepted for publication. This ensures that the articles have had some quality control.\n\nInternet\n\nInternet sources are an invaluable source of evidence. A lot of research and statistics are published on the internet, especially those sponsored by government, academic and non-for-profit agencies.\n\nUseful information, such as clinical guidance and government policy, is available in full and is free to download.\n\nBe extra careful in evaluating sites, as anyone can put information on the internet. There are good web portals, such as Intute (www.intute.ac.uk) which serve as gateways to the Internet. These portals provide links to websites that have been reviewed by subject specialists in healthcare.\n\nThe internet is an excellent source to find official publications in full. Sites such as British Official Publications Current Awareness Service / www.bopcris.ac.uk/bopcas (BOPCAS), The Stationery Office (www.tso.co.uk) and the Department of Health (www.dh.gov.uk) provide links to government documents.\n\nThe National Library for Health (www.library.nhs.uk) gathers guidelines, standards and various sources of evidence, as do NHS sites from home nations, for example, Health of Wales Information Service (HOWIS) (www.wales.nhs.uk) and Scottish Health on the Web (www.show.scot.nhs.uk).\n\nStatistics are an important part of research and are widely available on the internet. The Office of National Statistics (www.statistics.gov.uk) contains a lot of information on health and social conditions in the UK.\n\nCreating a search strategy\n\nA search strategy is a well thought out plan to search for information. It is particularly important when using electronic citation databases, for example, CINAHL, BNI, Medline or ASSIA, as it keeps you focused on your topic and within the boundaries of what you want to search.\n\nKey words and phrases\n\nYour search strategy will take your research question and break it into keywords or phrases. Keywords and phrases are very important to your search. Sometimes it is best to think around a topic as much as possible to identify useful terms.\n\nMany people find it useful to create a chart with the keywords and any synonyms you can think of or similar terms. You can also truncate your words or insert wildcards to expand your search (Box 1).\n\nBox 1. Truncated and wildcard words\n\nTruncate means finding the base of a word to find any words that begin with that base: Nurs* = nurse, nurses, nursing, nursery. Wildcards are symbols you use to replace one or more characters in a word: Wom?n = woman or women.\n\nSome nursing and medical terms are spelt differently in the US and the UK, so it is best to include both spellings for these words.\n\nBox 2 provides an example of a chart used to explore handwashing compliance by nurses.\n\nBox 2. Example of chart for researching handwashing compliance by nurses\n\nHandwash*\n\nComplian*\n\nNurs*\n\nHand wash*\n\nNon-complian*\n\nHand hygiene\n\nPutting terms together\n\nNow that you have your terms along with their synonyms, truncations and wildcards, you can start putting them together.\n\nBoolean logic is the way to put terms together in a search by using AND, OR, NOT.\n\nAND\n\nNarrows your search by making sure that all your terms show up in an article.\n\nExample: handwash* AND complian* AND nurs* would bring back articles that relate to handwashing and compliance and nursing - including all the truncated forms of the words.\n\nOR\n\nBroadens your search by allowing any of the terms to show up in an article; it is also useful for linking together synonyms.\n\nExample: handwash* OR hand wash* OR hand hygiene would bring back articles with handwashing and its synonyms.\n\nIf you are using terms and synonyms together in a database or Internet search, you must put these in brackets.\n\nExample: (handwash* OR hand wash* OR hand hygiene) AND (complian* OR non-complian*) AND nurs* .\n\nNOT\n\nNarrows your search by eliminating a term from your search.\n\nExample: handwash* NOT alcohol gel would bring back articles on handwashing, but not articles on alcohol gels used in handwashing\n\nPhrases\n\nPhrase searching will help you if you are looking for a specific phrase or title. You need to put the phrase in quotation marks.\n\nExample: “NHS Code of Practice” .\n\nCritiquing tools\n\nCritiquing a paper or a website is an important skill. Many published papers have gone through a peer review before publication but it is always important for you to do your own critiquing to determine the quality of the article and if it is relevant to your research.\n\nThere are various tools to help you critique a paper. One is the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) from the Public Health Resources Unit in the NHS.\n\nBelow are two checklists that you can download from CASP:\n\nQualitative research - CASP looks at ‘rigour, credibility and relevance’. www.phru.nhs.uk/Doc_Links/Qualitative Appraisal Tool.pdf\n\nQuantitative research - CASP looks at the validity of the research, examines the results and if the results can be used locally to answer your research question. A number of tools are provided to critique a variety of quantitative research, such as systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case controlled and diagnostic test studies. www.phru.nhs.uk/Pages/PHD/resources.htm\n\nThere are also checklists for critiquing a website. One is the DISCERN checklist (www.discern.org.uk/index.php).\n\nKey points"
