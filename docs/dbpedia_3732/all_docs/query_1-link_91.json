It is an independent, peer-reviewed publication dedicated to disseminating clinical information to managed care physicians, clinical decision-makers, and other health care professionals. Its aim is to stimulate scientific communication in the ever-evolving field of managed care. AJMC addresses a broad range of issues relevant to clinical decision-making in a cost-constrained environment and examines the impact of clinical, management, and policy interventions and programs on health care and economic outcomes.\n\nEvaluation Process: All original articles are subjected to rigorous peer review by leading clinical investigators, health services researchers, and clinical epidemiologists. Manuscripts are also evaluated to determine the real-world relevance of the information they contain. In addition to original research, AJMC publishes review articles, commentaries, trends from the field, editorials, and letters to the editor. AJMC速 can publish only a fraction of the papers it receives each year (approximately 35%).\n\nReadership: AJMC circulates to approximately 30,000 individuals with important decision-making responsibilities affecting the access and utilization of health care resources. Our audience includes medical directors, pharmacy and therapeutics committee members, pharmacy directors, physicians, corporate benefits managers, and other health care professionals across 6 market segments: (1) HMO/PPO/IHOs; (2) hospitals; (3) long-term care; (4) PBMs; (5) VA/government; and (6) employers.\n\nThe American Journal of Managed Care速 (ISSN 1088-0224 [print] & ISSN 1936-2692 [online]) is published monthly by Clinical Care Targeted Communications Group, LLC, 2 Commerce Drive, Suite 100, Cranbury, NJ 08512.
