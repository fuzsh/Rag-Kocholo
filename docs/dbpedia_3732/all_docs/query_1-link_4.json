These professionals face long workdays (12 h), walking with heavy loads (~25 kg), being exposed to high temperatures (>30 °C), and handling specialised tools in high-risk environments. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of occupational injuries among members of the ‘Brigadas de Refuerzo contra Incendios Forestales’ and its relationship to variables such as age and work experience. A total of 217 wildland firefighters (18 female and 199 male) correctly answered a questionnaire developed on an ad hoc basis to meet the study’s objectives. A high prevalence of occupational injuries was observed among them (~76%). Age and work experience were shown to be significantly associated with injuries. Individuals over 35 years of age with more than 10 years’ experience had a higher probability of injury (OR = 2.14, CI = 1.12–4.06 and OR = 2.46, CI = 1.30–4.67, respectively). Injuries occurred mainly during physical training (~46%), followed by preventive work (~33%) and forest fires (~20%). The most common injuries were tendonitis and muscle pain (~44% and ~21% respectively), followed by sprains (~21%). The results underline the need for physical activity programmes adapted to help wildland firefighters, especially older and more experienced individuals. The identification of risk factors such as age and work experience can contribute to the prevention and management of occupational injuries among this group of highly specialised forestry workers. Specific preventative measures during training are required to mitigate the risk of injury among these crews, who play a crucial role in protecting the environment and public safety.

Robotic surgery was listed as one of the top 10 health hazards as late as 2020. Taking inspiration from other fields of application, such as aeronautics, checklists have been increasingly implemented in medical practice over the years, becoming essential components of the operating theatre. In addition to checklists, simulation has taken on a fundamental importance in reducing errors. This paper aims to provide a narrative review to assess the importance of checklists and training in robotic surgery and how they improve the outcome. A comprehensive literature search from January 2000 to September 2023 was conducted. A total of 97 articles were included in the initial search. Eleven studies were deemed relevant and were considered eligible for full-text reading. Among these, ten studies focused on the analysis of training effectiveness. An article in our review assessed the benefits of introducing checklists in the operating room. Innovations created in aviation, such as checklists and simulation, have entered the medical field to prevent human error. Developing dedicated checklist and surgical teams, through theoretical and practical training, has become essential in modern medicine. Tools such as checklists, training, and simulation are among the best methods to reduce adverse medical events.

The aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of the acronym and validate its content. Validation is crucial to ensure that the acronym is theoretically correct and includes the necessary information that must be conveyed by EMS during the qualification of a patient with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for ECMO. A survey was conducted using the LimeSurvey platform through the Survey Research System of the Jagiellonian University Medical College over a 6-month period (from December 2022 to May 2023). Usefulness, importance, clarity, and unambiguity were rated on a 4-point Likert scale, from 1 (not useful, not important, unclear, ambiguous) to 4 (useful, important, clear, unambiguous). On the 4-point scale, the Content Validity Index (I-CVI) was calculated as the percentage of subject matter experts who rated the criterion as having a level of importance/clarity/validity/uniqueness of 3 or 4. The Scale-level Content Validity Index (S-CVI) based on the average method was computed as the average of I-CVI scores (S-CVI-AVE) for all considered criteria (protocol). The number of fully completed surveys by experts was 35, and partial completion was obtained in 63 cases. All criteria were deemed significant/useful, with I-CVI coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.97. Similarly, the importance of all criteria was confirmed, as all I-CVI coefficients were greater than 0.78 (ranging from 0.83 to 0.97). The average I-CVI score for the ten considered criteria in terms of usefulness/significance and importance exceeded 0.9, indicating high validity of the tool/protocol/acronym. Based on the survey results and analysis of responses provided by experts, a second version was created, incorporating additional explanations. In Criterion 10, an explanation was added—“Signs of life”—during conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ROSC, motor response during CPR). It has been shown that the acronym CALL TO ECLS, according to experts, is accurate and contains the necessary content, and can serve as a system to facilitate communication between the pre-hospital environment and specialized units responsible for qualifying patients for the ECPR.

Redox failure in women with BRCA1/2 insufficiency increases the risk for breast/ovarian/uterine cancers. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is a prophylactic surgery of the reproductive organs, which is frequently conducted by the age of 40 to lower the occurrence of cancer in women with BRCA1/2 mutations. However, abrupt estrogen decline following RRSO causes ovarian failure, which implicates various cellular physiological processes, resulting in the increased release of free radicals and subsequent severe onset of menopausal symptoms. Comfort measures (e.g., hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)) may improve chronological menopause-related quality of life, but their specific effects are not clear in women with gene mutations. Aiming to fill the gap, this study used path analysis to examine the effects of HRT and MBSR on menopausal symptoms among RRSO patients (N = 199, mean age = 50.5 ± 6.7 years). HRT directly alleviated the levels of urogenital symptoms (β = −0.195, p = 0.005), which mediated its indirect significant effects on the somatic–vegetative and psychological symptoms of menopause (β = −0.046, −0.067; both p values = 0.004, respectively), especially in BRCA2 carriers and in women who were currently physically active, premenopausal at the time of RRSO, had a high BMI, and had no history of breast cancer. It increased the severity of urogenital symptoms in women with a history of cancer. MBSR, on the other hand, was associated with indirect increases in the intensity of the somatic–vegetative and psychological symptoms of menopause (β = 0.108, 0.029; p = 0.003, 0.033, respectively). It exerted positive direct effects on different menopausal symptoms in multigroup analysis. The results suggest that young women undergoing recent RRSO may benefit from HRT at an individual level, while their need for extensive measures to optimize their psychological wellbeing is ongoing. The adverse effects of MBSR, which are captured in the present study, imply that MBSR may interfere with redox sensitivity associated with estradiol fluctuations in BRCA1/2 carriers. Investigations are needed to test this hypothesis and elaborate on the underlying mechanisms in these women.

Effective correction of the vaginal apex is essential for lasting repair for these women. Apical suspension of the sacrospinous ligament is probably one of the main vaginal treatments still offered to patients today. We proposed an evaluation of the functional and anatomical results of long-term sacrospinous ligament fixation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 10-year results of sacrospinous ligament suspension as primary repair for apical prolapse and to evaluate long-term side effects. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study analyzed 10-year follow-up after prolapse repair using sacrospinous ligament suspension. A subjective recurrence was identified as the postoperative occurrence of swelling symptoms based on a particular item on the Italian Prolapse Quality of Life (P-QoL) questionnaire. An objective recurrence was defined as a postoperative decline to stage II or below in any compartment based on the POP-Q system or the requirement for additional surgery. The assessment of postoperative subjective satisfaction was conducted using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) score. Results: In total, 40 patients underwent sacrospinous ligament fixation. Objective recurrence was remarkably high, as it was observed in 17 (56.7%) patients. Subjective recurrence was reported by ten (33.3%) women, and reintervention occurred in two (6.7%) of patients. From the point of view of quality of life, according to the PGI-I, twenty-three (76.7%) patients described some degree of improvement after surgery, four (13.3%) described their status as unmodified, and three (10%) reported some form of worsening after primary treatment. Conclusions: Transvaginal repair with sacrospinous fixation is a long-lasting option for prolapse repair, with improvement in every POP-q parameter. Some degree of anterior recurrence, recurrence of symptoms with swelling, or an overall worsening of quality of life after surgery is possible.

Research identifies that family members engage in a wide range of behaviors in response to a relative who shows minimal interest in eating and is literally ‘wasting away’ before their eyes. Some families, though concerned about the symptoms of CACS, do not dwell excessively on the patient’s nutritional intake while others continually harass the patient to eat and petition health care providers for aggressive nutritional interventions to eat in an attempt to stave off further physical deterioration. While studies have detailed how family members respond to a terminally ill relative with CACS, empirical work explicating the explanatory models of CACS that they hold is lacking. Explanatory models (EMs) reflect the beliefs and ideas that families have about why illness and symptoms occur, the extent to which they can be controlled, how they should be treated, and how interventions should be evaluated. To address this gap in the literature, a grounded theory study guided by Kleinman’s Explanatory Model questions was conducted with 25 family members of advanced cancer patients. The core category of ‘Wayfaring’ integrates the key categories of the model and maps onto Kleinman’s questions about CACS onset, etiology, natural course, physiological processes/anatomical structures involved, treatment, and the impacts of disease on patient and family. Findings suggest that a divergence between some biomedical constructions of CACS and explanatory models held by family members may fuel the family–health care provider conflict, thereby providing direction for communication with families about care of the patient with anorexia–cachexia.

Multiple health conditions, multimorbidity, is a growing problem in many populations worldwide. Methods: This paper quantified the effect of community assets on major health conditions for the population of England over six years, at a fine spatial scale using a data analytic approach. Community assets, which included indices of the health system, green space, pollution, poverty, urban environment, safety, and sport and leisure facilities, were quantified in relation to major health conditions. The health conditions examined included high blood pressure, obesity, dementia, diabetes, mental health, cardiovascular conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, respiratory conditions, kidney and liver disease, and cancer. Cluster analysis and dendrograms were calculated for the community assets and major health conditions. For each health condition, a statistical model with all community assets was fitted, and model selection was performed. The number of significant community assets for each health condition was recorded. The unique variance, explained by each significant community asset per health condition, was quantified using hierarchical variance partitioning within an analysis of variance model. Results: The resulting data indicate major health conditions are often clustered, as are community assets. The results suggest that diversity and richness of community assets are key to major health condition outcomes. Primary care service waiting times and distance to public parks were significant predictors of all health conditions examined. Primary care waiting times explained the vast majority of the variances across health conditions, with the exception of obesity, which was better explained by absolute poverty. Conclusions: The implications of the combined findings of the health condition clusters and explanatory power of community assets are discussed. The vast majority of determinants of health could be accounted for by healthcare system performance and distance to public green space, with important covariate socioeconomic factors. Emphases on community approaches, significant relationships, and asset strengths and deficits are needed alongside targeted interventions. Whilst the performance of the public health system remains of key importance, community assets and local infrastructure remain paramount to the broader determinants of health.

Migrants constitute a potentially vulnerable population in terms of facing discrimination, poor living and housing conditions, and insufficient access to healthcare services. Due to the armed conflict in Ukraine in 2022, almost 10 million people crossed the Polish border within a year of the outbreak of the conflict. The objective of this paper is to present the use of primary healthcare services by people migrating from Ukraine to Poland and identify the barriers in access to healthcare by this group of persons. This study used a qualitative research technique in the form of an expert interview using individual in-depth interviews (IDI). The study group consisted of professionally active primary healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, and facility managers) in Poland. Research was carried out in the areas regarding the availability of healthcare, the potential threats and challenges, and possible system solutions. The results showed that the most common cause for doctor’s appointments among migrants are respiratory infections, including COVID-19. Many cases were related to back pain, mainly resulting from the physical work of the patients. Additionally, some barriers to access and the provision of healthcare services for patients from Ukraine were identified. The majority (75%) of respondents indicated language as a significant barrier when providing services. Based on the study results, we recommend creating a dedicated website and telephone hotline for this group of persons as well as the use of traditional media to distribute information about access to healthcare services. It is also essential to focus on assistance for older people, since they may experience more difficulties with language and navigating the healthcare system.

This study examines the impact of an educational intervention on documentation of the interplay between HP and individuals receiving services in supported accommodation in Norway. An educational intervention study was designed to encourage HPs to document their approaches and interplay. The Scale for the Evaluation of Staff-Patient Interactions in Progress Notes (SESPI) was applied to measure documentation before and after the intervention. Journal notes written over a three-month period before the intervention and a three-month period after the intervention were measured. Prior to the intervention, only 23.1% of the journal notes described the resident’s experiences, increasing by 5.4% (p = 0.041) post-intervention. Practical solutions to individual experiences increased from 0.9% to 8.5% (p < 0.001). The educational intervention demonstrated a significant increase in the documentation of residents’ experiences and the interplay between HPs and residents. Future research should explore the generalizability of these findings. Incomplete documentation of HPs’ relational work conceals important aspects of the healthcare provided, potentially resulting in confining autonomy and participation for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

Fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers and topical steroids delivered via laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD) have shown potential for scar treatment. However, ideal steroid formulations (cream vs. solution) when combined with laser therapy remain unclear. Methods: This study included 12 patients receiving fractional CO2 laser on post-thyroidectomy scars. After laser treatment, one scar half received topically applied steroid cream, while the other half received steroid solution. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) was used to measure the scar conditions at the time prior to the first treatment and one year later by the patients themselves and by the surgeon who did the laser treatment. Scar appearance was photographically assessed at baseline and 6 months post-treatment by four blinded evaluators using scales. Results: This study discovered a modest improvement in the appearance of post-thyroidectomy scars when combining fractional CO2 laser treatment with either topical steroid cream or solution. Patients and treating physicians examined the POSAS scores one year after treatment found significant improvements in all aspects of the scar conditions, with high efficacy and satisfaction levels reported by patients. Conclusions: Fractional CO2 laser combined with topical steroid delivery, either cream or solution form, significantly enhanced post-thyroidectomy scar appearance with modest effect and high patient satisfaction. This approach may represent a promising scar management strategy along with current scar treatment for the post-thyroidectomy scar.

This study examined the effect of a spiritual connectivity intervention on individuals with depression in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial. Fifty-seven participants with mild or moderate depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 28) or the waitlist control group (n = 29). The intervention comprised eight weekly sessions focusing on divine connection, forgiveness and freedom, suffering and transcendence, hope, gratitude, and relapse prevention. The outcome measures included depressive symptoms, anxiety, hope, meaning in life, self-esteem, and social support. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and 3-month follow-up (week 20). Repeated-measures ANOVA and one-way ANCOVA were used to compare the within-group and between-group differences in the changes in outcome variables. Participants in the intervention group showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, spiritual experience, hope, self-esteem, and perceived social support after the intervention. Effect size statistics showed small to large differences (Cohen’s d, 0.308 to −1.452). Moreover, 85.71% of participants in the intervention group also experienced clinically significant reductions in PHQ-9 scores from baseline to immediate post-intervention. This study highlights the effectiveness of a low-cost, accessible intervention suitable for community implementation by clergy and faith-based organizations.

E-Health technologies have been used to improve the quality of care and to minimize the cost of rehabilitation services. This study aimed to provide the most recent and convincing evidence on the rehabilitation effects of e-Health interventions compared to conventional treatments. Methods: A systematic review was conducted. Inclusion criteria were defined following PICO recommendations (i.e., populations, intervention, comparison and outcome measures). Methodological quality and risk-of-bias were assessed for each study. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, providing data on 743 individuals with SLE. Results indicated that e-Health interventions improved health outcomes, such as disease management or emotional status. Methodological quality was moderate and low risk-of-bias was found in the majority of the studies included. Conclusions: For patients with SLE, e-Health interventions are a safe rehabilitation intervention to improve health outcomes. However, more high-quality studies with large samples are needed, with a focus on the long-term outcomes of e-Health interventions for patients with SLE.

The trigger is usually an emotional or physical stress. The catecholamine hypothesis seems to be the most prevailing. The main difference between TTS and acute coronary syndromes is that there is no obstructive coronary disease to explain the regional abnormalities. In this form, the left ventricle resembles the fishing jar which is used to trap octopus in Japan. However, to date more atypical forms are recognized. Also, the syndrome is not limited to older women. Nowadays, TTS is presented even in pregnancy and postpartum females. Our experience revealed cases of patients during these periods and some of them suffered from reverse Takotsubo. Additionally, the initial diagnosis in some patients was other than TTS. Due to these findings, we suggest that this type of TTS is not very rare but underestimated. For this reason, further studies are needed to support and explain this condition.

This study conducted a retrospective analysis of 762 TKAs (NHI, n = 505; MAP, n = 257) with a mean follow-up of 8.4 ± 1.8 years. Patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) were evaluated using the American Knee Society’s (AKS) score at the final follow-up. The survival rate of each group was analyzed using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Any postoperative complications and readmissions within 90 days of discharge were recorded and compared between the groups. There were no between-group differences in pre- to postoperative improvement in AKS scores. The estimated 10-year survival rates were 98.5% in the NHI group and 96.9% in the MAP group, respectively, with no significant differences (p = 0.48). However, the length of hospital stay (LOS) was significantly longer in the MAP group than in the NHI group (13.4 days vs. 13.1 days, p = 0.03), and the transfer rate to other departments was significantly higher in the MAP group than in the NHI group (3.9% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.04). Readmission rates for orthopedic complications for 90 days were 3.0% in the NHI group and 3.5% in the MAP group, respectively (p = 0.67). Patients’ insurance type showed similar survival rates and clinical outcomes to those of primary TKA at a mean follow-up of 8.4 years, but the LOS and rate of transfer to other departments during hospitalization were influenced by insurance type.

This cross-sectional study aimed to understand the factors affecting the usage and satisfaction of Korean medicine (KM) in subfertile women. An online survey was conducted from 3 November to 8 November 2021. The survey collected basic information, KM treatment experience, and satisfaction from women who experienced poor pregnancy. The t-test and chi-square test (χ2-test) were used to determine the overall characteristics of the subjects and factors affecting the utilization and satisfaction of KM treatment. Of the total of 29,465 people, 4922 read the survey email, and 601 responded. After excluding 51 respondents with questionable response patterns, 550 respondents were included in the final analysis. Of these, 43.1% (n = 237) had experience with conventional treatment, and 16.5% (n = 91) had received KM treatment. The group that received both KM treatment and CM treatment (n = 59, 24.9%) was significantly more prevalent than the group that received KM treatment alone (n = 32, 10.2%) (p = 0.00). Women who had given birth more than once or held a master’s degree were significantly more willing to participate in the ‘KM Support Project for Subfertility’ program. Our findings suggest that subfertile patients prefer integrated treatment that combines KM and CM treatments. Further studies are needed to assess the status of integrative medicine treatment, satisfaction with each KM intervention, factors for low satisfaction, and patient requirements.

As physical fitness could positively impact the quality of patient care, we investigated within a pilot study whether concurrent training (CT) affects work-related performance parameters in paramedics. At baseline (T1), 16 paramedics performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation whereby resuscitation performance (RP; total resuscitation quality, compressions with correct frequency, and correct ventilation), cognitive performance (CP; reaction time, divided attention, and working memory), and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed (pre-exertion). Then, participants climbed seven floors carrying 20 kg of gear before completing the same assessments again (post-exertion). The baseline testing was followed by a CT intervention (12 weeks, three sessions/week). After the intervention (T2), the two-stage testing was repeated. We analyzed whether the pre-exertion and post-exertion values, as well as the difference between the pre-exertion and post-exertion values, changed from T1 to T2. Nine paramedics (male: N = 7; age = 26.3 (SD = 8.17) years) took part in the study. The comparison of the pre-exertion values showed significantly better reaction times (p = 0.001) and divided attention (p = 0.02) and a trend toward greater working memory and RP parameters at T2. Regarding the post-exertion values, significant improvements in working memory (p = 0.03) and a trend toward improved reaction time, divided attention, and RP occurred at T2. The difference between the pre- and post-exertion values did not change for any parameter from T1 to T2. HRV decreased significantly from pre- to post-exertion (T1: p = 0.01, T2: p = 0.01). These results indicate that CT is a promising training concept to improve RP and CP in paramedics and should therefore be investigated further to increase patient care quality.

The available questionnaires measure patient satisfaction with particular aspects of ADDs. Also, the level of patient satisfaction with ADDs is not widely established. This study aimed to develop and validate a novel questionnaire to assess patient satisfaction with ADDs. Methods: Content and construct validity procedures were used to validate the 20-item questionnaire with four domains, including pharmacy administration, dispensing practice, patient education, and the dispensing system. Two hundred consenting participants took part in this study, from those who visited the outpatient pharmacy in a government hospital. Results: The internal consistency of all four scale items shows acceptable reliability (>0.7). In the exploratory factor analysis, three items were removed due to poor factor loading and cross-loading. In the confirmatory factor analysis, the model has acceptable fit indices, including the comparative fit index (0.937), Tucker–Lewis’s index (0.924), standardized root mean square residual (0.051), root mean square error of approximation (0.057), and χ2/df (1.67). The convergent and discriminant validity were established, since the average variance extracted (AVE) was ≥0.5 and the squared correlation (SC) values of one construct with other constructs were less than the AVE of the specific construct. Conclusion: This study offered a reliable and valid 17-item questionnaire incorporating a multi-dimensional four-factor model to evaluate patient satisfaction with ADDs. The validated questionnaire can be utilized to explore patients’ perspectives on ADDs. Full article\n\n►▼ Show Figures"
