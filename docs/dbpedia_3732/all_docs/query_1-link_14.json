        "text": "BMJ Health & Care Informatics publishes international, peer-reviewed, high-quality research and evaluation, reviews, protocols, letters, commentaries and communication articles. The essential scope of the journal is how informatics supports improvements in direct health and care service provision, but also incorporates public health strategies and interventions, implementation of learning health systems and national policy issues.\n\nA core purpose of the journal is to bring together the academic and practitioner communities, so we invite professionals in health and care informatics who are unfamiliar with the conventions and processes of academic publishing to contact the editorial office for guidance on writing for publication. Led by Professor Yu-Chuan Jack Li, BMJ Health & Care Informatics is an official publication of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, and published by BMJ.\n\nSpeed Time to first decision without review (median): 6 days Time to first decision with review (median): 66 days Time from acceptance to publication (median): 20 days\n\nImpact Impact Factor: 4.1 Journal Citation Indicator: 0.82 Citescore: 6.1 Citescore rank: 43/138 Eigenfactor score: 0.00196 Scimago Journal Rank (SJR): 1.114\n\nReach 2023 total content views: 97,570 2023 total Altmetric mentions: 517\n\nThe impact that academic research has cannot be defined by one single metric. In 2013, BMJ signed the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA). We did this to show our support for using multiple measures and metrics to portray journalsâ€™ impact; moving away from the Impact Factor as a single measure. How we get these metrics"
