        "text": "Background: English for medicine and academic purposes (EMAP) is believed tremendously significant for our medical students' academic and professional life. Although writing is underscored as the most challenging and valuable skills, our EMAP prospectus is based on an incorporated approach to the four language skills. Medical writing engages writing scientific manuscripts of dissimilar kinds which include delicate and study-connected documents, medicine-connected didactic and E literature, and abstracts, subjects for healthcare lectures, healthrelated magazines or English for medical purposes (EMP) commentary. Objective: The aims of this study was to appraise: the participant' feelings on teacher approach to educating in academic writing process, the weak and strong points of the model applied during the teaching academic writing in EMP and, and the participants' ideas and impressions at applying new ways, for material delivery of EMP and EMAP. Finding: The analysis questionnaires comprised of 80 records, planned in five groups based on Premise Base and Conducive The dialogue item was also applied to discover if the contributors asserted the media-based attitude supplements their learning of academic English writing classes or not. There are statistically important differences at (a = 0.05) in using educational techniques units because of the year of teaching adjustable, in favors of, the third and fourth year academics. Conclusion: The techniques can thus assist higher education programmers to identify, track, monitor, and treat at the university to educate, for teaching and learning medicine to strive in educating specialized writing. Given the benefits, it seems indispensable to apply the advantages of the survey, because studying hard to develop the technique, and implementing them in academic writing education is a theory."
