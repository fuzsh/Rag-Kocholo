        "text": "This online book is the new home of NHShistory.net. The book traces the story of the NHS, recounting how it was set up, what happened next, and why. It was written by Geoffrey Rivett, and the resource is now maintained and updated by the Nuffield Trust.\n\nThe National Health Service began on 5 July 1948. Already the NHS, which Bevan described as “a great and novel undertaking”, is the stuff of history. Few people now working in it had been born when it began. Those with clear memories of the early days grow fewer, and this book is in part a tribute to their work. It is the story of the NHS, how it was set up, what happened next, and why. It aims to give the reader, whether professionally involved in the NHS or not, a chronological framework of the main clinical and organisational events."
