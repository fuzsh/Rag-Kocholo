Emap’s owner is to scrap the brand and make the business part of a new company, called Plexus, in a restructure that includes hiring a financial chief from the publisher of the Economist.

In October, Top Right Group, the parent company of Emap, said that it was to retire the 70-year-old brand as it moved to stop publishing print editions and restructure to focus on digital and events.

The company has now unveiled a new operating company, under the brand Plexus, that will house the Emap operations as will as its 4C division.

Emap publishes 17 magazines including Architects’ Journal, Construction News, MEED and Health Service Journal; 4C is home to businesses including environmental data business Groundsure, Glenigan and Planet Retail.

“It is fitting that the [Plexus] name captures the way in which our products connect customers to data, intelligence and relationships that help the individuals, the organisations and the sector as a whole perform more effectively,” said the Plexus chief executive Natasha Christie-Miller.
