Case Study: Collecting health spending data for EMAP

The Health Service Journal (HSJ) from EMAP provides the most comprehensive and insightful coverage of what is really going on in the NHS, from both policy and practical perspectives, and follows the key figures within the healthcare sector.

HSJ wanted to analyse spending activity above Â£25K across the many Department of Health organisations. Whilst the raw data had been published on the internet, each organisation had a different way of presenting the data. ScraperWiki automated the collation of the spending data from the internet and then created sophisticated scrapers to extract, clean and categorise the content. This allowed HSJ to discover some unique insights that they could share with their subscribers.
