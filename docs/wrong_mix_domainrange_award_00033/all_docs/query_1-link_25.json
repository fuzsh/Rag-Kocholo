        "text": "Dario Fo, the Italian dramatist, who has died aged 90, was best known for political farces such as Accidental Death of an Anarchist and Can’t Pay? Won’t Pay!; his work and radical views were both praised and reviled in his native country.\n\nIn October 1997, when he received the Nobel Prize for Literature – the first Italian playwright to be chosen for the award since Luigi Pirandello in 1934 – the Swedish Academy described Fo as one “who emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden”. Certainly the announcement rankled with many within the Italian literary and political establishment.\n\nFo’s critics considered him to be a performer above all else, whose plays could not be separated from his role as actor and director. Others felt that his contribution was confined to his earlier decades, having peaked in the 1970s.\n\nThe literary critic Geno Pampaloni wrote: “A Nobel Prize? It’s a joke.” Meanwhile, the neo-fascist National Alliance party protested vigorously, and there was strong dissent from Vatican newspapers.\n\nDespite such public excoriation Fo never yielded to his detractors. If anything, he delighted in the chance to hit back. In the wake of the Academy’s decision he remarked: “It’s not bad at all getting a Nobel, and making so many old fossils explode with rage.”\n\nHis acceptance speech, Contra Jogulatores Obloquentes (“Against Jesters Who Defame and Insult”), took a more measured view. Drawing his title from a decree issued by Emperor Frederick II of Swabia, allowing citizens to attack and even kill jesters without fear of repercussion, he praised the Swedish Academy for the bravery of their decision, linking himself with the long-standing heritage of mummers, acrobats and storytellers.\n\nHe described his influences, including Molière and Angelo Beolco (“Il Ruzzante”), the 16th century Italian playwright and father of the commedia dell’arte whose local dialect Fo shared, and to whom he dedicated half the medal.\n\nBut he still punctuated his tribute with contemporary political asides, and his meditation on Ruzzante’s comic talent ended on a rueful note: “Laughter”, he observed, “does not please the mighty.”\n\nHis words struck too close to home for the authorities. Fo’s speech was broadcast in a multitude of countries, including North Korea; but in Italy it was edited down to a four-minute news bulletin.\n\nBorn on March 24 1926 at Sangiano near Lake Maggiore in Northern Italy, he was the oldest of the three children of Felice Fo, a railway stationmaster and amateur actor. He claimed to have grown up in a village primarily populated by smugglers and fishermen and that “the way these people used their eyes was to become my main weapon as a performer”.\n\nAs a teenager he wanted to study painting, but, before he could begin, the Second World War was declared and he spent most of the next four years helping his father to smuggle Allied fugitives across the border into Switzerland.\n\nAfter the war he moved to Milan where he attended the art school attached to the Brera Gallery. Here he found himself constantly drawn to the theatre, first as a set designer and later as a performer.\n\nHe eventually left the Academy without finishing his degree in order to work full-time in a comic revue. He soon began writing his own monologues, which proved to be so popular that Italian national radio agreed to broadcast a whole series based around the central character – a poor simpleton called Poer Nano (Poor Dwarf) who likes telling Bible stories but gets them completely wrong.\n\nFollowing this success, he formed his own revue company I Dritti which toured Italy with a show called One in the Eye and included his own, highly successful, set designs.\n\nHis aim was to “attack the myths of Italian life” and the play was an immense success, thanks partly to the participation of the legendary French mime artist, Jacques Lecoq.\n\nAmong the other members of the cast was an actress called Franca Rame, a member of a famous theatrical family, whom he married in June 1954. Together they produced a highly successful series of shows.\n\nTheir mixture of spectacle, mime and social comment made the authorities nervous. A Madhouse for the Sane satirised contemporary Italian politics and alluded to the continued presence of fascists in the government. The authorities insisted on a multitude of script cuts and inspectors were present at every performance to ensure they were enforced.\n\nThe production was a financial failure and he moved to Rome where he worked, unsuccessfully, as a screenwriter for three years. In 1959 he returned to Milan where his company was invited to open a season at the Teatro Odeon with Archangels Don’t Play Pinball, a play about the absurdities of Italian society.\n\nAfter four short sex comedies, collectively called Thieves, Dummies and Naked Women, he and his wife went on to produce a series of iconoclastic television features featuring transvestite detectives, outlaws, priests and divorced women.\n\nAfter the election of Italy’s first centre-Left government, however, he was appointed the artistic director of a weekly musical revue on national state television called Who’s Seen It? and he took advantage of a slight relaxation in the censorship laws to inject subversive sketches into both this and the most popular show on national television at the time (Canzonissima).\n\nBy now both he and his wife had close links with the Communist party and his constant criticism of government, Church and capitalism culminated in a sketch broadcast as part of Canzonissima in which a visitor to a meat factory falls into a grinder which cannot be stopped since this would interrupt production schedules.\n\nThe visitor is eventually taken home as 150 tins of minced meat. In response to numerous complaints, the producers of the show ordered extensive editing and Fo and his wife then walked off the set in protest.\n\nThey were subsequently barred from appearing on Italian television for the next 14 years.\n\nInstead, Fo wrote Isabella, Three Ships and a Wild-Goose Chaser in which Christopher Columbus is portrayed as an intellectual who is defeated by politicians. Despite a lukewarm critical reception, it broke box-office records at Milan’s Teatro Odeon.\n\nIn 1967 he produced The Lady is Disposable in which he attacked capitalism, the United States and Lyndon Johnson. He was soon called to police headquarters in Milan and threatened with arrest. His response was to declare that he was fed up with his role as “jester of the bourgeoisie” and that he had decided to leave his “gilded ghetto” in order to “serve the working classes”.\n\nHe founded a new theatre cooperative called Nuova Scena which would perform only in factories, trade union halls and workers’ clubs – mostly to people who had never before seen a piece of theatre.\n\nThe company was soon torn apart by political infighting but still managed to produce both Grand Pantomime with Flags and Small and Medium-sized Puppets (1968) – about life for the working classes during the Second World War – and one of Fo’s most important productions, Mistero Buffo (1969), a technically brilliant one-man show based on the work of the giullari or strolling players of medieval Italy.\n\nThe title was taken from a work by Vladimir Mayakovsky, whom he greatly admired, and the whole play is a subversive retelling of the Gospels, including an episode in which a legless man realises that he is better off as an outcast and desperately tries to avoid being healed by Christ.\n\nThe play incorporated a mixture of expressive mime and a partially invented language called grammelot, and Fo went on to perform it more than 1,000 times in Italy as well as in New York.\n\nA television version recorded in 1977 was condemned by the Vatican as “the most blasphemous show in the history of television” but meant that at least 40 million people around the world eventually saw him perform the role.\n\nAfter Nuova Scena disbanded in 1970 Fo and his wife formed La Commune, who were linked to the New Left rather than the Communist Party and who were based in Milan. Here he took the lead role in his best-known play Accidental Death of an Anarchist, which was based on the real events behind the death of the activist Giuseppe “Pino” Pinelli in custody and the ridiculous attempts of the authorities to blame this tragedy on the Communists and the Anarchists.\n\nThe work was revised four times to keep up with the latest press revelations and in four years the play was seen by a million people, many of whom took part in fierce group discussions after the show.\n\nFo and his wife continued openly to criticise the Italian police force throughout the early 1970s and in 1973 Franca Rame was kidnapped by an extreme Right-wing gang and left bleeding in the street.\n\nFo himself was later arrested and imprisoned in Sardinia for refusing to be present during rehearsals of his plays. Popular protest, however, meant that he was soon released.\n\n​In 1974 he first performed Can’t Pay? Won’t Pay! which dealt with civil disobedience (by women in a supermarket). In 1981 he produced Trumpets and Raspberries in which he played Signor Agnelli, the Fiat boss, and one of his shop stewards. The play had soon been seen in 15 countries.\n\nIn later years he turned to more historic themes for his works. In 1984 he held a series of sold-out workshops about the tradition of commedia dell’arte at the Riverside Studios in London, as well as performing a two-man play with his wife called Elizabeth in which she played Elizabeth I and he played her transvestite beautician.\n\nBut in 1987 he got into trouble with the authorities again by introducing a play on prime-time television with critical remarks about the Church. By 1994, however, he was more concerned with the problem of an “imbecile people” who had elected the “non-ideology of Berlusconism” to power.\n\nFrom 1978 Fo began a lengthy involvement with opera, first holding a year-long post as director of La Scala in Milan. Here he directed an adaptation of Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz’s Story of the Soldier, with music by Stravinksy, as part of La Scala’s bicentennial celebrations.\n\nFo dramatically rewrote the libretto, expanding the cast to include 32 students from La Scala. He made around 200 drawings on to Plexiglas, which could be moved around the stage as the production took shape.\n\nIn his hands, it became a political satire about migration from the south of Italy, with the part of the soldier-protagonist taken by a number of different actors. Later he turned to Rossini’s comic operas, beginning with Il barbiere di Siviglia at the Amsterdam Opera in 1987.\n\nThe production was later revived at several other opera houses, and he went on manage two new productions at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro: L’Italiana in Algeri in 1994 and La gazzetta in 2001.\n\nFo’s first work after winning the Nobel Prize was Free Marino! Marino Is Innocent! Here he returned to the political struggles and false accusations surrounding the death of Giuseppe Pinelli, this time focusing on the murder of Pinelli’s chief prosecutor, Commissar Luigi Calabresi.\n\nLeonardo Marino, a Left-wing militant, claimed to have driven the getaway car for the assassins, but doubts were cast on the validity of his statement. For Fo’s play, a monologue in two acts, Marino was represented by a large ventriloquist’s dummy, while the magistrates involved in the case were life-size cardboard cutouts.\n\nPinelli’s widow Licia was in the audience for the premiere, and a recording broadcast on national television drew audiences of two million. Fo and Franca Rame continued to produce plays together into the 21st century.\n\nIn The Two-Headed Anomaly (2003), a biting political satire, a surgeon (Fo) transplanted Vladimir Putin’s brain into Silvio Berlusconi’s body, leaving Berlusconi’s then-wife Veronica (played by Franca) to explain the situation.\n\nThe real Veronica saw the play and complimented Franca on her performance, but the work aroused the ire of Marcello Dell’Utri, a senator in Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party, who sued Fo for defamation.\n\nConsequentially the show was first broadcast on Sky without sound. Meanwhile Fo mounted a spirited defence of his decision to write such a play, insisting that it was a “matter of commitment. We have done militant theatre for 50 years, people expect us not to give up right now.”\n\nFo’s ambitions soon expanded again, and in October 2005, aged 79, he announced his intention to run for mayor of Milan, contesting the leadership of the centre-Left coalition Union against the city’s former police chief Bruno Ferrante.\n\nUnder the campaign slogan “I am not a moderate”, Fo called for the introduction of a congestion charge and expressed his opposition to plans for redevelopment of the city centre.\n\nIt was a colourful campaign, marked by scathing attacks upon the political Right, whom he dubbed “corrupt, money-grabbing bastards”. Silvio Berlusconi was “a spiv and a liar”. Fo heckled council chamber discussions from the public gallery and performed lectures at Milan’s biggest theatre, with a capacity of 3,500 people.\n\nHowever, he was effectively barred from appearing on public television, since three of the four main channels were owned by Berlusconi, and the fourth by a businessman who backed Ferrante for the post. As the campaign gathered pace, Fo brought the Communist Refoundation Party on side, together with half the Greens.\n\nKen Livingstone was guest of honour at his closing rally, the pair having met in London that December to discuss issues of public transport and urban pollution. The rally combined elements of cabaret and circus with the atmosphere of a rock concert, Fo’s political speeches punctuated by musical intervals that included his own compositions.\n\nBut when the election took place on January 29, Fo secured just 23.4 per cent of the vote. In defeat he paid grudging tribute to his rival: “He’s someone who says the same things as I do, only the day after.” A documentary about the campaign, I Am Not a Moderate, was screened at the Locarno International Film Festival the following year.\n\nFo found it impossible, however, to give up the pursuit of political intervention through drama and, much to both the admiration and irritation of the Italian nation, he continued to teach and perfect this skill throughout his life. Beside his plays, in 2006 he also wrote a fictionalised account of his childhood, My First Seven Years (Plus a Few More).\n\nThree years later this was followed by a biography of Franca Rame, A Life Off The Cuff.\n\nFrancis, the Holy Jester (2013) reworked his 1999 stage monologue into a novella. In July 1995 Fo called off a tour of Europe, having suffered a stroke after which his vision was reduced by 90 per cent.\n\nHe was then required to walk for several hours every day and, though his memory improved and his speech recovered, he still suffered severe heart palpitations.\n\nDario Fo’s wife, Franca Rame, predeceased him in 2013. He is survived by their son Jacopo Fo, an actor-playwright and director.\n\nDario Fo, born March 24 1926, died October 13 2016 ​"
