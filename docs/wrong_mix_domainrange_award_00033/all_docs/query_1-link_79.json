        "text": "Evening conversation with Robert Brustein; plus actor Joseph Grifasi reads excerpts from selected Dario Fo plays:\n\nAccidental Death of An Anarchist (1970)\n\nJohan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas (1992)\n\nMistero Buffo (1969)\n\nWe Won’t Pay! We Won’t Pay! (1974)\n\n(Plays TBC)\n\nAdditional support from Rossella Menna (Dramaturg, performing arts curator), and Mariateresa Pizza (Director, Franca Rame Dario Fo Archive/Rome); the Italian Playwrights Project, Valeria Orani, and The Italian Cultural Institute, Giorgio Van Straten.\n\nThe Segal Center honored Franca Rame in 2013 after her passing.\n\nDario Fo (24 March 1926 – 13 October 2016) was an Italian actor-playwright, comedian, singer, theatre director, stage designer, songwriter, painter, political campaigner for the Italian left-wing and the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature. Fo’s plays, in a hybrid Brechtian tradition, have been translated into 30 languages, and he was considered the most widely performed contemporary playwright in world theatre. Much of Fo’s dramatic work, co-created with his partner Franca Rame (18 July 1929 – 29 May 2013), depends on improvisation and comprises the recovery of “illegitimate” forms of theatre, such as those performed by giullari (medieval strolling players) and, more famously, the ancient Italian style of commedia dell’arte.\n\nHis plays have been translated into 30 languages and performed across the world, including in Argentina, Chile, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, the UK[6], and Yugoslavia. His work of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s is peppered with criticisms of assassinations, corruption, organised crime, racism, Roman Catholic theology, and war. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he took to lampooning Forza Italia and its leader Silvio Berlusconi, while his targets of the 2010s included the banks amid the European sovereign-debt crisis.\n\nFo’s solo pièce célèbre, titled Mistero Buffo and performed across Europe, Canada, and Latin America over a 30-year period, is recognised as one of the most controversial and popular spectacles in postwar European theatre. The play has been denounced by by Cardinal Ugo Poletti from the Vatican as “the most blasphemous show in the history of television.” Fo considered himself an atheist. The 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature marked the “international acknowledgment of Fo as a major figure in twentieth-century world theatre.” The Swedish Academy praised Fo as a writer “who emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden.” Dario Fo owned and operated his own theatre company.\n\nAbout HowlRound TV"
