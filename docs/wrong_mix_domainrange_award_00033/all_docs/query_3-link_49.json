        "text": "(1926–2016). Italian playwright, actor, and mime Dario Fo was a leading 20th-century dramatist. His controversial plays used humor to draw attention to and protest abuses of power by governments, the Roman Catholic Church, and other institutions. Fo won the 1997 Nobel Prize for Literature and was compared by the Nobel committee to “the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden.”\n\nFo was born on March 24, 1926, in the northern Italian town of Leggiuno-Sangiano. He studied art and architecture at the Academy of Arts in Milan and made his artistic debut on a radio program called Poor Dwarf. In 1952 Fo began to write satirical cabarets and acted at the Teatro Odeon and the Piccolo Theatre in Milan.\n\nFo married actress Franca Rame in 1954, and five years later the couple founded their own theater company. Fo’s first big hit came in 1960 with his play Archangels Don’t Play Pinball. Fo and Rame initiated the theater company Nuova Scena in 1968, but the company was eventually forced to shut down when it came under attack from the government and the church because it was supported by left-wing groups. The next year Fo wrote, produced, and performed the one-man show Mistero Buffo (“Comic Mystery”). It was based on medieval mystery plays but was so topical that the shows changed with each audience. The play, which drew on the traditions of medieval jesters, was heavily criticized by the Vatican. Fo used gibberish as the primary method of communication in parts of the play.\n\nIn 1970 Fo and Rame founded a theater collective, La Comune. That same year another of Fo’s most successful plays, Accidental Death of an Anarchist, was published. The satire portrayed bombings that had been perpetrated by right-wing groups in Italy in 1969 but had been blamed on anarchists. In 1974 La Comune was given a permanent theater, which opened with Fo’s We Can’t Pay? We Won’t Pay!.\n\nIn the next decade Fo published several important works, including Trumpets and Raspberries (1981), The Tale of a Tiger (1984), and The Pope and the Witch (1989). He and his wife cowrote Female Parts (1981), which satirized society’s expectations of women. Other feminist works included A Woman Alone and All House, Bed, and Church.\n\nFo’s productions were a combination of traditional theater, improvisation, soliloquy, and commedia dell’arte. Often, they were one-man productions he performed himself. Fo seemed to relish the role of court jester and used that position to criticize social injustices and abuses of power. Although his work was difficult to translate, with its references to current events and its unique use of language, Fo was considered one of the most widely performed playwrights of his time.\n\nFrom the beginning, Fo’s career was filled with controversy. In 1962 he commented about political corruption and the Mafia on a television variety program and was forced to leave the show when he refused to back down. He had numerous tangles—including several court cases—with the Italian government and the Vatican. In 1973 right-wing fanatics abducted and raped his wife. The United States government refused to allow Fo entrance into the country in 1980 because of his membership in a group that supported prison inmates. The Italian government protested almost all of Fo and Rame’s productions. At one performance, Fo was taken off the stage in handcuffs.\n\nIn 1997 Fo was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. The announcement came as a surprise to many and was strongly criticized by the Italian government and the Vatican. Fo called the award an act of bravery by the Nobel committee and a triumph for jesters of all times.\n\nFo’s later works included the plays Francis, the Holy Jester (1999) and The Two-Headed Anomaly (2003). He also wrote two illustrated novels, The Pope’s Daughter (2014) and There Is a Mad King in Denmark (2015). The Pope’s Daughter was adapted as a stage play. Fo died on October 13, 2016, in Milan."
