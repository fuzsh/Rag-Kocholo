        "text": "Sondekoppa Srikanta Sastri (5 November 1904 – 10 May 1974) was an Indian historian, Indologist, and polyglot.[1][8][9] He authored about 12 books, over two hundred articles, several monographs and book reviews over four decades in English, Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit.[10][11] To his credit are such works as \"Sources of Karnataka History\",[2] \"Geopolitics of India & Greater India\",[12] \"Bharatiya Samskruthi\" (a compendium on Indian culture and tradition)[13] and \"Hoysala Vastushilpa\" (a study of temple architecture of the Hoysala period in Karnataka).[14] S. Srikanta Sastri was a polyglot well versed in fourteen languages spanning Greek, Latin, Pali, Prakrit, Sanskrit and German among others.[15][16][17] He was Head of the Department of History & Indology at Maharaja College, University of Mysore between 1940 - 1960.[18][19] He was conferred the Kannada Literary Academy award in 1970[1] and was subsequently honoured by Governor of Karnataka Mohanlal Sukhadia in 1973 during mythic society diamond jubilee function.[20] A Festschrift was brought forth and presented to him during his felicitation function in 1973 titled \"Srikanthika\" with articles on History and Indology by distinguished scholars.[21][22] His work on Indus Valley Civilization and town planning at Harappa and Mohenjodaro were published in successive articles and drew considerable attention.[23] His Research articles on The Aryan Invasion theory,[4][24] the date of Adi Sankaracharya, Oswald Spengler's view on Indian Culture,[26] Jaina Epistemology,[27] Proto-Vedic religion of Indus Valley Civilization[4] and Evolution of the Gandaberunda[28][29] insignia remain relevant today.[30][31][32]\n\nAncestry[edit]\n\nS. Srikanta Sastri was born into a scholarly lineage. A paternal ancestor - Yagnapathi Bhatta was a famous court poet in the court of Kempegowda. Maternal ancestor Umamahesvara Sastri, a renowned court poet in the Vijayanagara Kingdom had earned the title of \"Abhinava Kalidasa\" for his work \"Bhagavata Champu\".[33] His uncles - Vidwan Motaganahalli Mahadeva Sastri,[34] Vidwan Shankara Sastri and Asthan Maha Vidwan Ramashesha Sastri were eminent court poets in the Mysore Palace. Vidwan Ramshesha Sastri was the first person to translate \"Bhagavata\" to Kannada from Sanskrit.[35]\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nS. Srikanta Sastri was born in 1904 in Nanjanagud, Mysore as the second child of Seshamma and Ramaswamy Sastri of the Telugu Mulakanadu community of Brahmins.[20] He had his preliminary schooling in the cities of Kolar, Nanjanagud and Chikkaballapur before moving to Mysore. After finishing his school, he pursued his Bachelor's and subsequently master's degree in History at Maharaja's college, Mysore. Here he came under the influence of S. V. Venkateswara (History)[pictured], J. C. Rollo, B. M. Srikantaiah (English), V. L. D'Souza, H. Krishna Rao (Greek History), N. S. Subba Rao (Economics) and M. H. Krishna (Ancient History).[11] During these years, he penned his first article titled \"Conquests of Siladitya in the South\" on the reign of King Harsa Siladitya in the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland\" in July, 1926.[36] On completion of his education, S. Srikanta Sastri secured the post of a tutor at Maharaja College, University of Mysore in the Department of History (1930) and subsequently became a lecturer in the Department in 1935.

Seetharamaiah, D. L. Narasimhachar, T. S. Shamarao and N. Anantharangachar.(all pictured in group photograph).\n\nWorks[edit]\n\nS. Srikanta Sastri authored about 12 books, 224 articles [100 in English, 114 in Kannada, 8 in Telugu, 1 in Sanskrit & Hindi] and three monographs and book reviews in Kannada, English, Telugu and Sanskrit.[37] Among his earliest essays were \"Kannada Nayananda\" and \"Shivaganga Kshetra\" - a treatise on the religious centre of Shivaganga. He published his first article in the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland\" at the age of twenty two.[36] He subsequently authored a small piece on King Devaraya of Vijayanagara Kingdom in the \"Indian Antiquary\". His earliest book \"Sources of Karnataka History, Vol I\" provides a list of resource material in the form of inscriptions, epigraphics and tablets enabling a detailed study of history of state of Karnataka over two millennia.[2] His next work - \"Geopolitics of India and Greater India\" was on the evolving Geo-Political scene in Asia and India's role in the coming decades where he outlines a union of nations, coming together to complement each other's needs - a forerunner to the WARSAW PACT, NATO, SAARC and BRICS associations.[12] His third book - \"Early Gangas of Talakad\" published in 1952 dealt with the rise and fall of Ganga Dynasty in Southern Karnataka.[38] This received a favourable review by Emeritus Professor of Oriental Law J Duncan M Derrett in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland in July 1953.[39] His fourth book \"Bharatiya Samskruti\" (Kannada: Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Lang/ISO 639 synonyms' not found.) served to illuminate on cultural, traditional and historical aspects of India spanning over three millennia.[13][40] S.
