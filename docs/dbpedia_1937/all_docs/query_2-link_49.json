        "text": "His Hindi primer Manohar Balapothi attempted to teach the Devanagari alphabet to beginners. He also published Some Eminent Behar Contemporaries by Sachchidananda Sinha, books by Mahatma Gandhi, and other Gandhian literature in both Hindi and English. He published Tolstoy and Gandhi by Dr. Kalidas Nag in English and produced a Maithili language version of the books of Tulsidas. Having edited and published Sidhant Bhasya, a four-volume commentary on Tulsidas's medieval retelling of the Ramayana, the Ramacharitamanasa, he was first to start printing Maithili books in Maithili script (Mithilakshar).\n\nHe died on 14 May 1971 in Darbhanga, Bihar."
