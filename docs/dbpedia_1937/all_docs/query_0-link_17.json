Chapter I THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 “Z)o or Dii’ Ominous world situation: World events were moving with dramatic rapidity caus- ing acute anxiety in human minds. Already before the opening of the year 1942, the war situation had taken a highly ominous turn threatening India at her very doori and also vitally afi'ecting British interests. On the 7th De- cember, 1941, there was a sudden air-attack by the Japanese Air Force on the American naval base at Pearl Harbour and Japan also crippled the United States Pacific fleet. On the 10th December, the Prince of Wales, one of the brah'J-new British battle-ships, supposed to be unsinkable, and the Pe- pulse, an older battle-cruiser, were lost by the British Pacific fleet. Hong Kong fell to the Japanese late in December, 1941. The strong British naval base' at Singapore, thought to be impregnable, surrendered on the 15th February, 1942, more than- 75,000 British and Indian troops falling into their hands. ^ In March, Japan occupied most of Java, Sumatra and other Islands of the Dutch East Indies. Burma was next invaded by the Japanese, who brought Rangoon under their control on the 7th March, 1942, and Mandalay was occupied by them on the 29th April. On the 25th March was heard the news of the Japanese occupation of the Andaman islands. British evacuation of Taungu came to be known on the 1st April. There was an air-raid on Colombo on the 5th April. Next day the Japanese 1. “As you will gather, recent events at Singapore and in Southern Sumatra have faced us with extremely grave and urgent problems of strategy and policy.” General Wavell to Prime Minister, 16th February, 1942. Winston Churchill, The Second World War, Vot. IV, p. 124. v3— I 2 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR dropped bombs on Vizagapatam and Coconada, and early in the morning of the 9th April “a heavy air-raid smote Trin- comalee.”* On the 12th April, General Wavell said in a message to the Chiefs of Staff General : “Unless a serious effort is made to supply our essential needs, which I have not overstated, I must warn you that we shall never regain control of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal and run the risk of losing India.”* To add to all this, Japanese warships were active in the Bay of Bengal, and the whole eastern coast-line of India lay e^osed to their attack. Before the end of May, Japan had effectually closed the Burma Road, thus cutting off that pass- age between China and the. outer world. Japan’s sweep over the American protected Philippines, outposts in the Western Pacific, the East Indies and South- Eastern Asia, and her approach to the borders of India, na- turally produced grave consternation and panic throughout India, whose vital means of self-defence were at the disposal of tlid British power, which itself was then in ‘‘grievous anxieties.”® The District Magistrate of Shahabad reported to his Commissioner on the 25th December, 1941 : “The situation in the Far East has been causing considerable anxiety and the news that Rangoon has been bombed caused wide- spread panic. An appreciable number of people from thi? district have their relations in Burma and many men from Shahabad are serving as constables in Burma and other places in the Far East. Rai Bahadur Harihar Prasad Singh of Arrah, who owns a sugar mill at Ziabadi, was hoping to get away by an aeroplane, but has not been succeessful in getting one. Some of his people saw me today and I understand from them that the old Rai Bahadur is now arranging to come to India by the land route through Assam, there being no road for some distance at the border of Assam and Burma. Rai Bahadur and party will be escorted by his own men carrying guns etc. and his relations are sending another party this even- 1. Ibid, p. 158. 2. Ibid, p. 165. 3. Ibid, p. 164. THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 3 ing to meet him at the Burma frontier in Assam Leading merchants in the towns of this district, who have got offices in Calcutta, have already begun their prepara- tion to leave their Calcutta offices and have been withdraw- ing relations from Calcutta. There is a widespread fear that Calcutta, Jamshedpur and other steel and coal producing places will shortly be bombed.” This sort of alarm and general uneasiness prevailed in all the districts of Bihar, and there was a large exodus of people evacuating places like Calcutta and Jamshedpur. In fact, events in the South-East Asia and in Burma “had shaken confidence,” as is stated in a contemporary Government Report, “in British ability to with- stand an invasion of India.” Apprehension of “scorched earth” being followed in India, and preferential treatment to Euro- peans as compared with the Indians in evacuating Malaya, Singapore and Rangoon, intensified discontent of the Indians against alien domination. In Bihar, a number of persons were purchasing land and buildings as a precaution against devaluation of the currency, and withdrawals from savings banks during the first three weeks of February, 1942* were nearly double of those in the corresponding * periods in the preceding years. Press comments in Bihar: The Press in Bihar strongly commented on India’s help- less position at that time. Thus the Searchlight wrote in its issue of the 14th January, 1942 : “The Far East muddle is elocjuent of the tragic nexus between India’s defence and India’s helple.ssness. Defence is the Governor-General’s responsibility. We have been practically told ad nauseam that the responsibility is so solemn and sacred that it cannot be profaned by being shared with Indians. How that sacred trust has been discharged has been brought out in all its naked reality by the disclosures about the Far East. Between the criticisms levelled and the apolo- gies made must be read the tell-tale story of the place India occupies in the catalogue of Imperial responsibilities. Mr. Satyamurti has raised the issue in language of characteristic terseness. If the Defence of India is really in the Malayan 4 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR State inter alia, why was not Malaya defended as it ought to have been? The Raja of Sarawak, a European and Britisher, has stated that the present position in Malaya was due to gross ihcompetencc and criminal negligence. Mr. Curtain, the Australian Prime Minister, has urged that the Raja’s attack on British military and political leadership should be cabled to London for the behoof of British politicians. The attack has not been met by the laboured apologies in Parlia- ment. Major Attlee contends that it is ‘beyond our resources to be strong everywhere’ and that it would have been ine.xcus- able to reduce the air forces in the Middle East ‘because we had to meet a problematical attack by Japan’. Sir Archibald Sinclair admits that risks were taken in the Far East but they were taken ‘with our eyes open and with confidence in the support which we should have obtained from the powerful armed forces of the United States if Japan was guilty of an act of aggression.’ Mr. Anthony Eden clinched the issue w'hen he said that if there had been any error, it was not the off- spring of neglect but the result of deliberate decision for which the Government assumed full responsibility. In other words, India has suffered and has been e.xposed to risk because its defence was related to and balanced against Imperial responsi- bilities elsewhere. The apologies have cut no ice. A free India would not have tolerated the woeful unpreparedness in the Far East that has been revealed and would have sacked out of hand the croaking crew who had induced a false sense of confidence by their ill-conditioned optimism. The Japanese attack was by no means a problematical something. Reliance on America should have been based on a realistic realisation of capacity. In any event, ordinary common sense stands scandalized by the desperate gamble to which the two British battleships were subjected in the absence of appreciable air support. Why was not at least one aircraft out of 15 that Britain and America between them could master, made available ? Criticisms have . been forthcoming of the manner in which the evacua- tion of Penang was conducted. Premature withdrawal fol- lowed by valuable materials falling into the hands of the Ja- panese have been alleged. The criticisms need not be re- THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 5 peated. British propaganda has been brought to the verge of ridicule, time after time by sheer inability to understand that repeated exposure of hiatus between optimistic grand eloquence and cruel disillusionment is fatal. It is well that Dr. Duff Cooper has slunk away to his island home at last. The Far East is well rid of him and his kind. The tragedy is that India cannot help muddlers. It is her misfortune to be afflicted with a succession of men who are proclaimed to be ‘experts and prove to be nincompoops. But India remains a helpless witness to dispositions to which she has no voice and arrangements proceed without her right to determine them being recognized and allowed.” The Indian Nation also observed on the 26th January, 1942 : “And as for defence, India is definitely much less prepared for it than Australia perhaps is. Her long coast-line along the Bay of Bengal will be at the mercy of the Japanese sub- marines, of Japanese naval craft, while Calcutta, Jamshedpur and other vital centres in North India will be within the reach of Japanese air-craft. Our fighting forces are ‘mostly engaged in Malaya. and the Middle East and any resistance that we can offer on the soil of India will not probably be worth mention- ing. India has to be defended in Malaya; that is a proposi- tion which has been long ago accepted as a vital factor in mili- tary strategy in the Far East. But how can India be defended in Malaya, when Malaya itself is exposed to serious danger, is the question which India is entitled to ask. She can de- fend herself mainly and solely by the strength of her own arms, which on that account have to be very considerably expanded. Even when this condition is fulfilled, India has per force to depend upon Britain for naval and air protection in the same way as Australia has to depend on her. Such have been the mistakes and delays in British military policy all along that when the crisis threatens to envelop these Far Eastern possessions of the British Empire, we are left in the sorry position of having to shift for ourselves and of Britain being unable to lend us all the help that is required. If only the British Government had realized the fundamental neces- 8 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR life to guard their land from the menace of the invader,” and that Sir Stafford Cripps,^ who had lately joined the Govern- ment as Lord Privy Seal and became a member of the War Cabinet and Leader of the House of Commons, would soon proceed to India to have ‘direct discussions’ with “representa- tives of all parties and communities,” Sir Stafford Cripps reached Delhi on the 23rd March, 1942. The British Cabi- net’s proposals, embodied in a Draft Declaration carried by Sir Stafford Cripps, were as follows; — (1) “For the earliest realization of self- Government in India,” the British Government proposes to take steps for the creation of a new Indian Union, “which shall constitute a Dominion associated with the United Kingdom and the other Dominions by a common allegiance to the Crown but equal to them in every respect, in no way subordinate in any respect of its domestic or external affairs.” (2) “Immediately upon the cessation of hostilities,” a constitution-making body shall be set up with representatives both oPBritish India and the Indian States. (3) The British Government “undertake to accept and implement forthwith” the constitution framed by this body on two conditions (a) Any Province which is not “prepared to accept the new constitution” shall have the right to frame by. a similar process a “new constitution, giving them the same full status as the Indian Union.” An Indian State was also to be entitled to choose whether to adhere to the constitution or not. In either case “it will be necessary to negotiate a revision of its treaty arrangements.” (b) “The signing of a Treaty, which shall be negotiated between His Majesty’s Government and the constitution- making body,” will cover “all necessary matters arising out of the complete transfer of responsibility from British to Indian hands.” 1. His stock was then high in England. He was the British ambas- sador to Russia during a critical period of the war and was believed to have acted successfully in that capacity. THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 9 (4) During the W'ar period and “until the new constitu- tion can be framed, His Majesty’s Government must inevitably bear the responsibility for and retain the control and direc- tion of the defence of India as part of their world waf effort, but the task of organising to the full the military, moral and material resources of India must be the responsibility of the Government of India with the co-operation of the people of India.” For the latter the British Government “desire and invite the immediate and effective participation of the leaders of the principal sections of the Indian people in the counsels of their country, of the Commonwealth and of the United Nations.” The Cripps mission could not remove the constitutional deadlock in India. Every “single party or group” in India^^ including some of her most moderate statesmen, rejected its proposals. Its failure caused much disappointment in this country. Unable to accept its proposals, the Congress Work- ing Committee expressed the view that “though future inde- pendence may be implicit in the proposals the accom- panying provisions and restrictions are such that real freedom may well become an illusion. The complete* ignoring of the ninety millions of the people of the Inclian States and their' rulers is a negation of both democracy, and self-determination. While the representation of an Indian State in the constitution- making body is fixed on a population basis, the people of the States have no voice in choosing those representatives nor are they to be consulted at any stage, while decisions vitally affect- ing them are being taken.” “The acceptance beforehand of the novel principle of non-accession for a Province” was justly considered by .the Working Committee to be “also a severe blow to the conception of Indian unity and an apple of dis- cord likely to generate growing trouble in the Provinces, and which may well lead to further difficulties in the way of the Indian States merging themselves in the Indian Union.” The proposals “opened out,” observed Shri Nehru significantly, “a vista of an indefinite number both of Provinces arvd States.” The proposals relating to the immediate present were vague and incomplete. The Working Committee held that the “chief function of the National Government must neces- 10 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR sarily be that of organised defence on the widest popular basis and create a mass psychology of resistance to the invader.” So for the vital matter of Defence at that critical time, the GongreSs wanted an Indian Defence Member in the National Government “without prejudice to the power and responsi- bility of the Commander-in-chief who would have control of armed forces and full latitude in the carrying out of operations connected with the war.” The Congress leaders made it clear that “they had no intention of upsetting in the middle of the war the military administration of the country.” The Congress also held that “witli the single reservation of defence the Viceroy’s Council would function as a Cabinet government, the Viceroy occupying a position analogous to that of the King of England vis-a-vis the British Cabinet.” But the 6nly change offered was the transformation of the existing Council of the Viceroy by the appointment of some additional Indians representing political parties. It was to be, as the Working Committee felt, “a glorified edition of the Viceroy’s Executive Council.” The new members were to become, in the words of Shri Nehru, the Viceroy’s “liveried camp follow- ers and look after canteens and the like.”^ In his letter to Sir Stafford Cripps, dated the lOth April, the Congress President, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, wrote: “We would point out to you that the suggestions we have put forward are not ours only but may be considered to be the un- animous demand of the Indian people. On these matters there is no difference of opinion among various groups and parties, and the difference is as between the Indian people as a whole and the British Government. Such differences as exist in India relate to constitutional changes in the future. We are agreeable to the postponement of the issue so that the largest possible measure of unity might be achieved in the present crisis for the defence of India. It would be a tragedy that even when there is this unanimity of opinion in India, the British Government should prevent a free national govern- ment from functioning and from serving the cause of India as well as the larger causes for which millions are suffering and 1. Nehru, The Discovery of India, p. 388. THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 11 dying today.” To counteract this point Sir Stafford raised the communal bogey and pleaded that the minorities, parti- cularly the Muslims, would not be agreeable to the Congress suggestions, and that it would involve “constitutional 'changes of a most complicated character and on a very large scale” which could not be introduced in the war-time. The Con- gress President pointed out to him, “we are not interested in the Congress as such gaining power, but we are interested in ’the Indian people as a whole gaining freedom and power.” Sir Stafford Cripps’ negotiations with the leaders broke down abruptly and he left Delhi for London by air on the 12th April. As regards the real issue, Shri Nehru observed in a statement to the Press: “I think it is every Indian’s duty to refuse submission to every aggression, old and new, and to resist it. We cannot and must not submit, for that way lieS a surrender of the soul and spirit of the nation. But it must be realised that effective resistance is not an individual matter and no one can deliver the goods except a free national govern- ment with power and responsibility which can enthuse and organise the masses. This patent fact cannot be ignored and this is the crux of the question in India.” • In a letter, written to Mr. Horace Alexander and Miss Agatha Harrison soon after the departure of Sir Stafford Cripps, Mahatma Gandhi observed: “Sir Stafford has come and gone. How nice it would have been if he had not come with that dismal mission.” Indeed, this mission did no good at all to India. On the other hand, it accentuated communal bitterness. Further, its failure caused disappointment in all quarters and produced a feeling of frustration in Indian minds, which had been already perplexed and agitated on the daily nearer approach of the war menace. Wherein lay true security for India in those days of grave crisis? The abortive Cripps mission plainly demonstrated to India the hollowness of British promises for formation here of a national government, enjoying sincere and full confidence of the vast body of her people and capable of harnessing national will and determination to back and strengthen war efforts. Could the country be any longer justified in reposing full trust in this respect to the war-measures of the British Government which 12 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR had proved to be futile in stemming the tide of Japanese advance in the East ? Would it have been proper to welcome Japan’s support and to gain India’s freedom, as some in India in their' dislike for British rule actually advocated ? “It was a heart-breaking situation, for while the crisis called to us and we were bubbling over with the desire to act, effective action was denied us. Catastrophe and disaster advanced with tremendous strides towards us while India lay helpless and inert, bitter and sullen, a battle-ground for rival and foreign forces,” ‘ Psychological background for the mass Revolution: The country was certainly in a terrible dilemma. In such desperate hours, widespread national discontent, des- pair and anguish sometimes generate uncontrollable forces, which mould the course of affairs in unforeseen channels boldly upsetting the calculations of statesmen! and challeng- ing all the weapons of repression carefully preserved in the armoury of the ruling authorities. With intense perturbation in the minds of men a mass movement could not be far off. In fact, the logic of events was inexorably driving the country to the ways of a Revolution, though the wheel of Govern- mental repression had been moving on.* Mahatma Gandhi’s speeches and writings for some time, marked by “a new ur- gency and passion” and “the hint of action” instead of “sym- bolic piotest,” had much to do in preparing the psychological background for it.* 1. Nehru, The Discovery of India, p. 393. 2. Persons were being arrested and prosecuted here and there under Defence of India Rules. Swami Sachchidananda of Foi ward Bloc was arrested for making speeches against Britain’s war policy in March and April, and Shri Ram Briksh Benipuri was prosecuted for a similar speech at Madhubani at the same time. 3. Nehru, The Discovery of India, pp. 397-399. The concluding por- tion of a letter written by Mahatma Gandhi to Mr. Horace Alexander and Miss Agatha Harrison, he observed — “My firm opinion that the British .should leav^e India now in an orderly manner and not run the risk that they did in Singapore and Malaya and Burma. The act would mean courage of a high order, confessions of human limitations, and right .doing by India”. This view was expressed in some other writings that followed. THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 13 White Hall Mas sanguine about a better turn for them in the war situation from about the middle of the month of April. Referring to this time, Mr. Churchill writes: “We were in no way drawn from our main purposes, and were not deterred from new and vigorous offensive action. It had been a harassing episode, but it was over. From this time forward we began to grow stronger.’’^ India could have no real consolation in this. The supreme problem before her was then that of national security. The danger of a Japanese invasion of India by sea, land or air continued to agitate Indian minds. The Searchlight wrote on the l4th April, 1942: “One is forced to the conclusion that the initial bombing of Vizagapatam and Coconada ancl naval activity in the 13ay of Bengal are precursors of prospective determined attack in force on vital centres on the cast eoast and in the hinterland within the flying range of planes based on carriers in the Bay of Bengal. Attempted landing and even a regular in- vasion arc not beyond the range of probability. Most assur- rcdly the brilliant attack by American Flying Fortresses on the Japanese invasion fleet ofl'Port Blair has upset the Japan- ese for the time being. But the danger remains for the simple reason that the Japanese retain the supreme command of the Bay of Bengal and for the equally undoubted fact that the Allies continue to labour under the handicap of inadequate air support in the Far Eastern theatres of the War. The latest sinking of the two British cruisers and of the aircraft carrier is apt to further weaken the Allies position. The danger to India is thus real and it presses.” While admitting the need of an anti-Japanese resistance, even the Indian JIaiion obsci’ved on the 17th April: “Disappointment at the extremely shortsighted British policy in not conceding India’s just de- mands at a moment of world crisis like the present may lace- rate all true Indian hearts.” Borrowing of American troops by the British Government for defence of India did not appeal to Indian sentiments. Mahatma Gandhi looked upon “the introduction 'of foreign soldiers as a positive danger thoroughly to be deplored and 1. Churchill, The Second World War, Vol. IV, p. 165. 14 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR distrusted,” He wrote in the Harijan^ dated the 26th April, 1942: “Now we have promise of a never-ending stream of soldiers from America and possibly from China. I must confess that I do not look upon this event with equanimity. Cannot a limitless number of soldiers be trained out of India’s millions? Would they not make as good fighting material, as any in the world? Then why foreigners? We know what American aid means. It amounts in the end to Ameri- can influence, if not to American rule added to British. It is a tremendous price to pay for the possible success of allied arms.” In Bihar the Searchlight echoed similar feelings by writing in its issue of the 16th May, 1942: “Ame- rican reinforcements are pouring in. However welcome, the fact is by no means an unmixed blessing. In the first place, it is galling, indeed, that with a vast man-power wait- ing to be tapped we should have to depend on American sol- diery to defend India, In the second place, American men, money and material mean sooner than later American in- fluence^ and India has very good reason to be chary of foreign influences in any shape or form. We do not want further mortgages on th*e already mortgaged body and soul of India. An Indian Defence Minister could alone rouse drooping spirits and reassure anxious hearts. He would symbolise con- fidence.” Indeed, the British Premier’s comparative optirhism could not remove India’s intense anxiety regarding the war menace. Referring to the second half of the month of May, 1942, a Government Report said : “There is no improvement to report in the general public feeling. Defeatism and anti-British feeling, encouraged by enemy broadcasts and by objectionable speeches, are still pronounced. The unfavourable impres- sion caused by the passage of trains through North Bihar containing sick and wounded from the Burma front is now likely to be strengthened by the unexpected return of labour which had only recently been recruited for the military roads in Assam. ‘ These labourers are returning in many cases with sores on their feet and in a condition which shows that they have not been well cared for in the journey. And on their return the tale is spreading that many of them are vie- THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 15 tims of the Japanese air-raids in Assam. Two incidents that have been reported during the fortnight illustrate the people’s reluctance to go anywhere near the war zone and their con- tinued fear at the proximity of soldiers. At Samastip’ur, five Indian engine-drivers, who had been ordered to take their engines to Katihar for delivery to the Bengal and Assam rail- way and to work them on that railway, refused, together with their firemen and khalasis to do so, and the engines had to be driven there by British firemen and drivers. At Mandar, near Ranchi, the village tank was inspected by a military officer, whereupon some of the villagers promptly drained it for fear that troops might camp in the locality and harass the villagers.” To add to these, the common people had acute hardships due to scarcity and high prices of essential commo- dities, and growing insecurity wdlh consequent increase of crimes. The A.R.P. arrangements of the bureaucracy, the acti- vities of the Bihar Provincial War Committee and the propaganda work of the so-called National War Front, inaugurated in Bihar on the 20th March, 1942, at a meeting in th^ Sinha Library Hall, Patna, over which His Excellency the Governor of Bihar presided, could not afford to assuage deep-seated dis- content of the Indian people and to evoke national support of the right type to fight out the menace of war and the evils that it produces in human society. The meetings organised under the auspices of the so-called National War Front failed to produce much impression on the people. We read in a Government Report covering second half of the month of May, 1942: “Reporting on the meeting held in the adjoining district of Manbhum, the Deputy Commissioner says that the speakers read out their written speeches parrot-like and the movement is stillborn and practically no response is forth- coming. At Dhanbad while the audience of 1500 persons attentively listened to the speech of the Provincial Leader and other local leaders, they dispersed with the shout Gandhi-ji- ki-jaiP By the middle of July, 1942, the National War Front in Bihar claimed to have enrolled 1 8,000 members for the whole Province. Besides its ‘Grow More Food’ campaign it was entrusted by the Government with the work of organis- 16 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR ing Town Defence Parties {Nagar Raksha Dal) and Village De- fence Parties [Gram Raksha Dal). But in these matters too the National War Front could not enlist genuine support of the common village folk. It is mentioned in a Government Re- port for the second half of the month of July, 1942 : “The major- ity of the members of the Village Defence Parlies come from the smaller zamindars, the literate middle class and persons in some sort of service.” The National War Front was, in fact, neither national nor a strong front to ensure safety and security. So the hopes of the Government that “the efforts of the National War Front will counteract the depressing effect which the general war news has on public morale” were belied. Some eminent citizens of Bihar became leaders of the National War Front as a “common front against a common danger.” In explaining its objects the Provincial Leader once observed: “Make the Front a living organisation of patriots banded together with one common, impulse and one only, namely to serve ‘Mother India’. Save India and you will save mankind.” Whatever may have been the ideas of such leaders of moderate school of thought, it was natural for them to share along with others the common anxiety for the country’s defence in that houi of peril. But being es- sentially a Government sponsored and patronised body, the National War Front could not evoke sufTicient confidence of the people to allay their aching anxiety at a time when the w'ar, by defying the mighty British arms, w^as knocking at their very doors, nor could it stimulate an all round national enthusiasm to combat a war, which, it was then clear to many in India, was being fought chiefly to defend and perpetuate British imperial interest in the East. In a pathetically helpless and strained situation, the Working Committee of the Congress and the All-India Congress Committee met at Allahabad towards the end of April, 1942. Mahatma Gandhi was not then present at Allahabad but sent from Wardha a draft embodying his views on the prevailing situation for consideration of the Working Committee. Though the draft was not fully acceptable to the Working Committee and there were differences of opinion on it THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 17 among its members, yet its substance was incorporated in the resolution which was passed finally by the Working Commit- tee for adoption at the meeting of All-India Congress. Com- mittee, held at Allahabad from the 29th April to the 2nd May 1942. The relevant points of this resolution were; “(1) The Cripps proposals had led to greater bitterness and disillusionment in India. (2) • India’s participation in the war was a purely British act imposed upon the Indian people without the consent of their representatives. India herself had no quarrel with the people of any country though she had repeatedly declared her antipathy to Nazism and Fascism as to Imperialism. (3) The present Indian Army was an off-shoot of the British Army maintained for keeping India in subjection. It had been completely segregated from the general popula- tion who could in no sense regard it as their own. (4) A free India would have determined her own policy and might have kept out of this war though her sympathy would inevitably had been with the victims of the aggression. If, however, circumstances had led to her joining the war, she would have done so as a free country, fighting for freedom and organising her defence on a popular basis. (5) India would obtain her freedom through her own strength and Avould retain it likewise. Not only the interest of India biit Britain’s safety and world peace and freedom required that Britain must abandon her hold on India. (6) Finally the resolution repudiated the idea that free- dom could come to India through the intervention of, or in- vasion by, a foreign power. In case foreign invasion took place it must be resisted. In the circumstances in which the Indian people stood, such resistance could only take the form of non-violent non-co-operation as the British Govern- ment had prevented the organisation of national defence by the people. In places where the British and the invading forces were fighting, no obstacle was to be put in the way of British forces. This was the only way of demonstrating our non-co-operation wdth the invader. Judging from their attitude, the British Government did not need any help from V 3—2 18 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR US beyond our non-interference. They desired our help only as slaves — a position which the Congress could never accept.” ‘ The Working Committee could not reconcile itself to Shri Rajagopalachari’s resolution which he had carried at the Madras legislature as leader of the Congress party there .and which recommended the acceptance of the principle of se- paration (Pakistan) as a basis of settlement with the Muslims. So, after resigning from the Working Committee, Shri Raja- gopalachari moved it as a non-official resolution at the All- India Congress Committee meeting, where it was rejected by 120 votes to 15. The All-India Congress Committee adopted a counter-resolution, moved by Shri Jagat Narayan Lai of Bihar. It said “that any proposal to disintegrate India by giving liberty to any component state or territorial unit to secede from the Indian union or federation will be detri- mental to the best interests of the people of the different States and Provinces and the country as a whole and the Con- gress, therefore, cannot agree to any such proposal.” The President pointed out that in adopting this resolution the Committee in no way detracted from its earlier resolution to the effect that “the Congress cannot think in terms of com- pelling the people in any territorial union to remain in an Indian Union against their declared or established wish.” India’s widespread national challenge to British imperial- ism .seemed inevitable. So, from the end of April and during the months of May and June, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Shri Shri- krishna Sinha and the other Congress leaders of Bihar toured its different districts to educate and prepare the people for the impending struggle. They addressed numerous meetings, in which explicit reference was made to the coming ordeal. They further explained the real motives of the British Govern- ment and also the nature of the Japanese menace and empha- sised on the duty of the Indians to free themselves from the clutches of the former and to oppose the encroachment of the latter through non-violent resistance. “It was not to 1 .

At Gaya and Manbhum, he concil- iated large number of people, who were agitating against the occupation of their lands by government for extension of aerodromes which caused much trouble to them. He ad- vised the local government officers at the respective places to arrange for payment of compensation to such persons, and the officers by duly appreciating the utility of this mediation acted according to his sound advice.* On the 11th May, 1942, Dr. Rajendra Prasad visited Chapra and addressed a public meeting there on the next day in which he asked the people to carry on constructive works and to arrange for storage of grains. During the first half of May, two well attended Political Conferences were held — one at Ranka in the Palamau district and the qther at Kudra in the Shahabad district. In the former Shri Jadubans Sahay and other local leaders condemned what they charac- terised as highhandedness of the Ranka and Chainpur Rajas and of the ruler of the adjoining Surguja State towards the tenants. At Kudra, the chief speakers were Shri Shrikrishna Sinha and Shri Krishna Ballabh Sahay, who impressed upon the audience the urgent need of forming village defence parties and enrolment of greater number of Congress members.

He was supported by Mr. Shrikrishna Sinha, Ex-Premier.” 20 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR presidentship of Shri Anugraha Narayan Sinha for organisa- tion of Raksha Dal (defence parties). Shri Anugraha Nara- yan Sinha, Shri Jagjivan Ram and Shri Jagat Narayan Lai visited Mokameh on the 27th June and besides speaking on the war situation emphasised the need for forming village defence parties. A meeting of the Congress party was held at Sonepur on the 30th June, in which resolutions were passed reaffirming complete faith in Mahatma Gandhi’s leadership at that juncture and urging abolition of the Arms Act and the release of the political prisoners. A largely attended meeting of combined Socialist, Congress and Kisan elements was held on the 10th July at Hasanpura in the Saran district at which some speakers exhorted the audience to join the forthcoming mass movement under Mahatma Gandhi’s leadership.^ Shri Mahamaya Prasad Singh, President of the Saran District Congress Committee, also spoke in support of it. An important meeting of Congressmen was arranged at Tarapur in the Monghyr district on the 18th and 19th July, 1942, mainly to protest against the unsatis- factory management of the Banaili estate in relation to its tenants. The speeches indirectly referred to other matters. It was attended, among others, by Acharya Kripalani, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Shri Shrikrishna Sinha and Shri Krishna Ballabh Sahay. Shri Anugraha Narayan Sinha was in the chair. Resolution of the Congress Wot king Committee: Thus Bihar was making a psychological preparation for the impending challenge to British imperialism, when the Working Committee of the Indian National Congress met at Wardha on the 6th of July to consider the situation.

THE REVOLUTION OF 1942*43 21 drawal, the Working Committee passed the “Qw?/ India'' re- solution on the 14th July, 1942, which was to be placed before the next meeting of die All-India Congress Commjttee at Bombay. The resolution still left the door open for negotia- tions. It affirmed: “It is the earnest desire of the Congress to enable India to resist aggression effectively with the people’s united will and strength behind it. In making the proposal for the withdrawal of the British rule from India, the Congress has no desire whatsoever to embariass Great Britain or the Allied powers in their prosecution of th6 war, or in any way to encourage aggression on India or increase the pressure on China by the Japanese or any other power associated with the Axis grouji. Nor does the Congress intend to jeo- pardise the defensive capacity of the Allied Powers , And while, therefore, the Congress is impatient to achieve the national purpose, it wishes to take no hasty step and would like to avoid, in so far as is possible, any course of action that might embarrass the United Nations. The Congress would be pleased with the British power if it accepts the very reason- able and just proposal herein made not only in the interest of India, but also that of Britain and of the cause of freedom to which the United Nations proclaim their adherence. Should, however, this appeal fail, the Congi’ess cannot view without the gravest apprehension of the continuation of the present state of affairs, involving a progressive deterioration in the situation and the weakening of India’s will and power to resist aggression. The Congress will then be reluctantly compelled to utilise all the non-violent strength it might have gathered since 1920, when it adopted non-violence as part of its policy for the vindication of the political rights and liberty. Such a widespread struggle would inevitably be under the leader- ship of Mahatma Gandhi.” Precautionary plans on the part of the Government: The Government of India and the Provincial Govern- ment in Bihar had been already busy in devising plans to suppress any attempt to oppose them. On the 13th May, 1942, the Government of India promulgated the Collective Fines Ordinance, which provided that “if it appears to the Provincial Government that the inhabitants of any area are 22 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR concerned in or abetting the commission of offences particu- larly affecting the defence of British India or the efficient prosecution of war or are harbouring persons concerned in the commission of such offences, or are failing to render all the assistance in their power to discover or apprehend the offender or offenders, or are suppressing material evidence of the commission of such offences, the Provincial Governnlent may, by notification in the official gazette, impose a collecdve fine on the inhabitants of that area.” To proceed against any organisation which the Government considered “to be work- ing in the interests of the enemy and whose activities they hold to be prejudicial to the defence of British India or the efficient prosecution of the war”, the Government of India framed a new Defence Rule 27A in June, 1942, and it was to apply at once to the Forward Bloc. According to it, the Bihar Government forwarded to their Divisional Commissioners, District Officers and the I.G. of Police on the 18th July, 1942, a list^ of the more active members of the J'orward Bloc in Bihar ‘asking them to proceed against such persons without re- ference to Government if there was material to prosecute them.

THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 23 were tiying lo prevent the spread of its influence among non- Congressmen by issuing circulars ‘ and in some other ways. From the very date on which the Working Committee resolution was published, the Government of Bihar took a decision to the effect that they could not allow “their move- ment to gather momentum” and asked all their Divisional Commissioners and District Officers, including the Additional Deputy Commissioner of Dhanbad to keep a close watch on the situation, waiting to take action when the Government gave the signal for it. On the 19th July additional instructions in this matter were sent by the Government to those officers for mobilising all anti-Congress elements* and keeping their plans ready to crush the movement. When the All-India Congress Committee was about to* meet, the Government in Bihar issued instructions on the 7th August, 1942, to all their District officers and the Additional Deputy Commissioner of Dhanbad with regard to the policy they were to follow in suppressing the new movement. They were informed that as soon as the All-India Congress Commit- tee’s decision was known, the Government of India would decide when action against the movement is to begin. Im- mediately on receipt of the Central Government’s signal, the Provincial Government would issue a notification under the Criminal Law Amendment Act declaring the All-India Con- gress Committee and the Working Committee of the Congress (though not the Indian National Congress as such) to be an unlawful association. At the same time the Provincial Government would “issue similar notifications under the Cri- minal Law Amendment Act in respect of (i) the Provincial Congress Committee with its Working, Executive and Dis- 1. Compare the Circular issued by Sir Frederic Puckle, Secretary to the Government of India, 17th July, 1942. 2. They were asked not to make definite suggestions to the leaders of Hindu Mahasabha or the Muslim League. But they could discuss the ques- tion with the District and Subdivisional leaders of the National War Front and tell them that as members of the National War Front it* was up to them immediately to declare themselves against the mass civil disobedience movement and to make attempt to persuade the public to follow their policy. 24 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR trict and Subdivisional or other local or subordinate Commit- tees, (ii) the Congress Socialist Party and (iii) other organisa- tions likely to participate in the movement or bodies organised under hew names but with the object of supporting and carry- ing on the movement.” The first aim of the Government was to be to “deprive the movement of its organisation by arresting all leaders” and for this the officers mentioned above were supplied a list in two parts, A and B. The A list .showed districtwise the more important leaders of the Province,' who were expected to organize and participate in the Move- ment, and B list contained the names of the less important ones. The lists included not only Congressmen as sueh but also the members of the other parties who, the Government believed, would be with the Congress in the Movement. The Magistrates were to commence arresting such persons as soon as they received a signal by telegram or telephone on the issue of the notifications referred to above. Members of the All-India Congress Committee, the ex-Ministers and members of the Legislature were to be arrested, if possible, by the Dis- trict officer personally. Arrested persons were to be prevented from making any public statements after arrest and they were not to be allowed any interviews or letters for the first month of custody. Publication of copies of statements of prominent Congressmen sent by them to the Press in advance before their arrest was also to be pievented. As soon as any arrest was made under Defence Rule 132, the District officer was to submit a report to Government, who would pass orders authorising the detention of a person or his being kept in custody in a particular jail. Government intended to confine prisoners classified in Division I in the Hazaribagh, Bhagal- pur and Motihari Old Jails. Division III prisoners were to be confined in the Patna Camp Jail. Division I prisoners arrested in Bhagalpur Division might be sent direct to Bhagal- pur Jail and those arrested in Tirhut Division to Motihari Old Jail. All other Division I prisoners might be sent to Hazaribagh until further orders. Simultaneously with the issue of the notifications declaring the Congress Committees, 1. Vide Appendix A. THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 25 etc, to be unlawful, the Government were to issue notifications under section 17E and 17A of the Criminal Law Amend- ment Act freezing the funds of these bodies and ordering the seizure of the places or buildings used by these associations and the District officers were to comply with these orders at once. After their July meeting at Wardha, the Congress Work- ing- Committee had not in fact placed before the people any definite programme to be followed by them in the contem- plated fight. It was, however, suggested that it would include all that was needed for a non-violent mass struggle and that the people should be prepared for subsequent developments. So in their communication to the District Officers, the Bihar (Jovernment could not then “give any definite indication of the lines on which the movement may develop.” But the latter were asked to be fully alert and prepared to deal with all kinds of developments timely and at once. The District Officers were authorised to seize arms, ammunition, etc, in suitable cases, of Congressmen or others likely to jojn the Movement, to ban all meetings and processions in support of it, to prevent picketting and strikes, to impose a strict control on the Press in the matter of publishing any news or comments on the Movement, and to exercise a careful check on the telegrams relating to it. A draft programme: Before the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee at Bombay, Dr. Rajendra Prasad took necessary steps to ac- quaint the people of this Province with the content and signi- ficance of the Wardha resolution and to sound their views on it. With this object a meeting of the Bihar Provincial Congress Working Committee was called at Patna on the 21st and 22nd July, where the resolution of the Congress Working Committee was endorsed. The Provincial Congress Committee had an emergent meeting here on the 31st July. Though indisposed. Dr. Rajendra Prasad made a spirited speech before the Committee, and all present there realised that the Bombay meeting of the Congress was to take a highly significant decision. One or two days after this meeting, 26 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR the members of the All-India Congress Committee and many other Congressmen proceeded to Bombay to attend there the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee. Dr. Rajendra Prasad had to lemain at Patna due to his own illness. It was known from the newspapers and some other sources that the Government were preparing themselves to arrest all the leaders at Bombay before the Movement could start and that in Patna the Old Camp Jail, not in use for some time, was being cleaned for accommodating political prisoners. Considering that in such circumstances the people would have no plan of action for them, Dr. Rajendra Prasad decided to frame a programme at least for Bihar. After discussion of this matter with some of his friends, then present at Patna, he requested them to prepare a draft programme, as he was himself too weak even to sit for the purpose of writing much. Prominent among them were Shri Dip Narayan Singh, Secretary of the Provincial Congress Committee, Shri Mathura Prasad, Shri Krishna Ballabh Sahay and Shri Baidyanath Choudhury. The draft was shown by him to Shri Anugraha Narayan Sinha, who was also then at Patna, and it was finalised with certain changes. Arrangement was made for its printing through Shri Sakhi Chand Jayaswal; but he was asked to keep the programme secret so long as Dr. Rajendra Prasad, or some one authorised by him, did not order for its publication and propaganda. This was pro- bably to await the decision of the All-India Congress Commit- tee. It was decided that if all the leaders were arrested, the people would conduct the Movement according to it. Mahatma Gandhi was repeatedly emphasising that in this struggle no stone should be left unturned for attainment of freedom, but non-violence should not be discarded at any cost. In the draft, referred to above, this point was reiterated. A plan of Satyagraha was also indicated, which was not fundamentally different from that of the previous Satyagrahas but was cer- tainly more forceful.* In a meeting which was addressed by Shri Anugraha Na- rayan Sinha at the Anjuman Islamia Hall, Patna, the students 1. Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Almakatha, pp. 588-589. THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 27 were asked to prepare themselves for the coming struggle. Soon an information reached Bihar that the Government, instead of arresting the Congress leaders on the 8th August, 1942, would watch the course of Congress activities ’ before taking the final step and that Mahatma Gandhi would also have negotiations with the Viceroy before launching the Move- ment finally if these failed. So Dr. Rajendra Prasad thought that it would not be necessary for them to do anything before the' 11th August, that is, the date on which those who had gone to Bombay from Bihar, were expected to come back. Accordingly, Shri Anugraha Narayan Sinha went to Rai Bareilly to see his ailing brother there and Shri Dip Narayan Singh went to Muzaffarpur to fulfil some previously fixed engagements. Dr. Rajendra Prasad remained at the Sadaqat Ashram, Patna, with Shri Mathura Prasad and Shri Chakradhar' Saran.^ ^Quit India’ resolution: But matters immediately took a serious turn. The Work- ing Commttee met at Bombay on the 5th August and passed the famous resolution, later on called the ''Quit India\" re- solution, repeating “with all emphasis the demand for the withdrawal of the British power from India,” which it con- sidered to be “an urgent necessity both for the sake of India and for the success of the causes of ttie United Nations.” For the “vindication of India’s inalienable right to freedom and independence”, the Committee resolved to sanction the “starting of a mass struggle on non-violent lines on the widest possible scale” under the guidance of Mahatma Gandhi. The resolution contained an appeal to the people of India “to face dangers and hardships that will fall to their lot with courage and endurance and to hold together under the leadership of Gandhiji, and carry out his instructions as the disciplined soldiers of Indian freedom. They must remember that non- violence is the basis of this movement.” This resolution was considered at the historic session of the All India Congress Committee at Bombay on the 7th and 1. Ibid, pp. 589-590. 28 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR 8th August and was passed with overwhelming majority. In addressing the Congress after this, Mahatma Gandhi suggested for the people the mantra “Do or Die. We shall either free India or die in the attempt; we shall never live to see the perpetua- tion of our slavery.” He also expressed in this speech, “before launching the struggle I will address a letter to the Viceroy and wait for his reply and if he is agreeable meet him.” Arrests and other repressive measures: Such a letter could not be written. In the early hours of the morning of the 9th August, Mahatma Gandhi and the members of the Congress Working committee were arrested. Numerous arrests followed quickly in all parts of the country on that day. At Patna, while Dr. Rajendra Prasad was read- •ing the Bombay news in the Searchlight in the morning of Sun- day, the 9th August, the District Magistrate, Mr. W.G. Archer, appeared before him at about 10 A.M. Finding him indis- posed the latter sought Government’s instructions as to what should be done in such a condition. He was advised to con- sult the Civil Surgeon as to whether Dr. Rajendra Prasad could be then taken out at any distant place. On examining him, the Civil Surgeon, Major Muddock, gave the opinion that he could not be shifted far off. A stream of visitors including a large number of ladies, besides Dr. Rajendra Prasad’s own relations, tiad appeared at the Sadaqat Ashram to pay their respects to him. Piofusely garlanded by them, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was taken to the Bankipur Jail, at about 12.30 P.M., amidst shouts of India'' “Gandhiji-ki-jai\", ^‘Rajen Babu ki jai.\" Just as Shri Mathura Prasad and Shri Chakradhar Saran had left the Jail premises after making some arrangements for the great leader* in that bad state of health, Shri Phulan Prasad Varma was also brought there under arrest. Shri Mathura Prasad was taken into custody at about 5.30 P.M. on that day. Plans for the arrest of other prominent leaders were ready by that date. On his arrival at Patna in the morning of the 10th August, from his village Maur, Shri Shrikrishna Sinha was arrested bv Mr. Archer at 1.

Both were kept in the Bankipur Jail. Shii Baladev Sahay resigned his post of Advocate-General at the same time. Ordinance rule was at once inaugurated by the Government. On the 9th August, in an extraordinary issue of the Bihar Gazette the -Government issued a number of notifications declaring unlawful such bodies as tlie All-India Congress Working Com- mittee and its branches, etc., the Bihar Provincial Congress Com- mittee and its branches, etc., the Bihar Congress Working Commit- tee and its branches, etc., the Bihar Congress Executive Committee and its branhes, etc., all District Congress Committees, all Sub- divisional Congress Committees, all Thana Congress Committees, • the Provincial Committee of the Congress Socialist Party, the Council of Action of the Provincial Committee of the Congress Socialist Party, and all Local Committees of the Provincial Committee of the CongH’ss Socialist Party. The offices of such organisations were declared to be notified places. Notifications were also issued on the same day seizing the “monies, securities and credits in the custody of the Bihar Provincial Congress Committee, the Bihar Branch of the All-India Spinners^ Associations, the Khaddar Bhandar, and the Bihar Central Relief Fund.\" Two other notifi- cations were issued on the next day (10th August) declaring the offices of the Provincial Committee of the Congress Socialist Party, of its Council of Action, and of any of its Local Committee to be notified places and seizing “monies, securities and credits” of these organisations. Stringent restiictions were imposed on the publication of news. An order of the Government of India prohibited the “printing or publishing, by any print- er, publisher or editor, of any factual news including reports of speeches or statements by members of the public, relating to the mass Movement sanctioned by A.I.C.C. or to the measures taken by Government, against the Movement, except news derived from official sources, or the Associated Press of India, the United Press of India, or a correspondent regularly employed by the newspaper concerned. The source of information shall also be stated in the newspaper publishing news.” On the 11th August the Central Government issued 30 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR a communique “abrogating the former arrangement by which before action was taken against any newspaper the Press Advisory Committee was to be ordinarily consulted and warning given and by providing that editors of any news- papers who supported and encouraged the movement or who opposed the measures adopted by Government to avert or suppress it, will be guilty of an offence against law.” The upheaval starts: While the Government was thus launching a vigorous offensive, the news of the arrest of the country’s great national leader, and of the other leaders, spread like wild fire and caused intense excitement in the minds of the people leading to an unprecedented mass upheaval as the country’s spontaneous challenge against alien domination. The fire started in the heaits of the students, who played indeed a heroic role in this great and gigantic struggle of India for freedom, fully demonstrating to the world how the youths of India could be inspired by the mantra of ‘Do or Die’. Immediately on hearing of Dr. Rajendra Prasad’s arrest, the Patna students organised themselves to lead a large pro- cession, which was joined by others as well. Starting from the B.N. College, the processionists paraded the main road and marched back to the University grounds, where they held a meeting under the presidentship of Shri Suraj Deo. Speeches were delivered by some of them expressing support for the Congress policy and programme, condemning the arrest of Dr. Rajendra Prasad and appealing to the students in general to come forward and join the fight for freedom. A resolution was passed to organise a general strike in the schools and colleges. Marching back by the lower road, the processionists, whose number had swelled to several thou- sands, made a demonstration for about fifteen minutes near the Bankipur Jail at about 6 P.M. and proceeded towards Government House, in front of which they held a meeting and condemned Government’s repressive policy. They after- wards dispersed peacefully. On the 10th August, the Police seized the Sadaqat Ashram, the Kisan Sabha Office (Kadamkuan Road, Kotwali, P.S.) THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 31 the District Congress Office, New Kadamkuan, and the Congress Socialist Party Office, New Kadamkuan. At the Sadaqat Ashrarn all its inmates were asked by the Police to vacate it, and Shri Amar Kishore Sinha, Publicity Officer of the B.P.C.C., was taken into custody for refusing to do so. The Police took possession of the building ot the Bihar Vidyapith, and also the bungalow where Dr. Rajendra Prasad used to stay. Through- out, the day there was intense excitement in the city, and num- ber of demonstrations were organised in different parts of it by students of schools and colleges, majority of whom went on strike. Almost all the shops and public conveyances observed hartal. In the afternoon, a large number of students, starting from the Patna College area (2000 according to Police calculation), organised a meeting in the maidan in front, of the Patna University library. It was presided over by Shri Krishna Prasad (son of Shri Jagat Narayan Lai) of Patna College. After this meeting, the students’ procession went to the Engineering College to hoist the Pfational Flag, which had been taken down by the authorities there. The proces- sion then proceeded to the Bankipur Lawn, where another meeting was held. National Flag was hoisted by the students that day at the Patna Training College, B.N. College, Patna General Hospital, Patna College, Science College, Engineer- ing College, Ram Mohan Roy Seminary, Patna Collegiate School and P.N. Anglo-Sanskrit School and most ot the other schools and hostels. In the jurisdiction of the Patna City Chauk P.S. many students (about 500 according to a Govern- ment report) moved about in a procession and held a meeting in the Mangles Tank, where resolutions were passed asking the students to continue the Movement undauntedly. Shri Singh Sikh and Shri Awadh Behari Prasad, both students of the Patna City School, were the leaders of this batch. In Dinapur most of the students of the three local High Schools moved in a procession carrying National Flags and shouting the usual slogans, under the leadership of Shri Sitaram Kesri and Shri Harekrishna Singh, two local Congressmen. The procession- ists went to the barrack area, demonstrated in front of the guard room and stopped at the D.A.V. School, where the two leaders addressed the students, asking them to take out pro- 32 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR cessions daily and to see that hartal was observed in that town next day. Almost all the students of the Nalanda College and of the Town Scho('l, Bihar Sharif, w^ent on strike. In the Patna Medical College, not only the students went on strike but their example w^as followed by the nursing staff, housemen, coolies and mehtars. The authorities failed to persuade them to do their normal duties. It is mentioned in a Government Report and also in the Searchlight (11th August, 1942) that Captain Ghosh of the Patna Medical College pro- duced a letter from Dr. Rajendra Prasad to the effect that the nursing staff of the Hospital should join their duty in the interest of the patients. On the demand of the students for verification of the contents of the letter, some of them were taken by the District Magistrate to Dr. Rajendra Prasad. The strike of the house stall and the nursing staff was then called off and all the housemen, coolies and mehtars resumed their duties. But the students of the Medical College continued their strike. A mamrnotli meeting was held in the evening in the Bankipur Maidan under the presidentship of Shri Shiv- nandan Prasad, General Secretary of the Patna Town Con- gress Committee, and several speakers exhorted the people to carry on the Movement.

Two other lady speakers at this meeting w'erc Shrimati Sun- dari Devi, wife of late Shri Shambhu Saran Varma, and Shri- mati Rampyari Devi, wife of Shri Jagat Narayan Lai. The main points in their speeches were that the Government servants should resign their posts, the lawyers should give up their practice and the people should be prepared to face all odds and trials with strong determination. That day a number of people took a procession to the Patna Civil Court compound shouting slogans. They were pushed out of the compound by the Police with the help of a military force of the M.M.P. Ten persons were arrested and prosecuted under Rule 56 THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 33 of the Defence of India Rules and u/s 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.‘ In the evening, the two cinema houses at Patna, the Regent and the Elphinstone, were pickcttcd and their shows were closed.

Col- lege) and of the local schools formed a procession near one of the hostels of the College at 7 A.M., and they were soon joined by thousands (more or less 5000 according to Government estimate). The processionists split themselves into batches and moved round the city. National Flag was hoisted on the buildings of the G.B.B. College, the Zila school, the Marwari School and the Tirhut Technical Institute, and the Union Jack flying in front of the Treasury guard was removed.

Many of them followed this advice by abstaining themselves from work on the 9th, the 10th and the 11th August. The Muslim shopkeepers co-operated. Not a single Harijan went on duty. The boys and girls showed wonderful enthusiasm. On the 9th August the Police ariested three principal workers and on the 10th seized the Congress Office and the motor bus of the Workers’ Union. But many of the Police were also agitated, and, on 10th August, 650 Policemen observed fast as a protest against arrest. The Police Union of Shri Ramanand Tiwary gathered force. Early in the morning of the 10th August the Police sur- rounded the Shilpa Ashram at Purulia. They had with them warrants for the arrest for three, namely Shri Bibhuti Bhusan Das Gupta, President of the Manbhum District Congress Committee, Shri Pumendu Bhusan Mukhopadhyaya and Shri Vir Raghavachariar. As Pumendu Babu was not then in the Ashram, the Police arrested the other two leaders. They then seized the Ashram and asked its inmates to vacate it. The latter refused to do so and the Police further arrested the fol- lowing persons and confined them in jail : — (1) Shrimati Labanya Prabha Ghosh (wife of the veteran national worker Shri Atul Chandra Ghosh), (2) Shrimati Kamala Ghosh (daughter of Shri Atul Chandra Ghosh), (3) Shri Shris Chandra Bandopadhyaya, (4) Shri Baidyananath Datta, (5) Shri Ram- kinkar Mahto and (6) Shri Arun Chandra Ghosh. The Police also captured on the same day the Mukti Press at Purulia, the Mbaran Palli Shilpa Sangha, the Congress Office at Chas and 36 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR the Ashrams at some other places. Shri Atul Chandra Ghosh returned from Bombay on the 12th August after attending the Congress there and was arrested on the 13th August. But he had already placed a programme for the Movement with the other workers. At Ranchi there was hartal on the 9th August and the Police seized the office of the District Congress Committee there in the evening of that day.

At Dalmianagar the labour force of the Rohtas Indus- tries ’came out on the 9th August at the suggestion of Shri Reyasat Karim, joined a procession and attended a meeting, where some speakers condemned the arrest of the leaders.

At Bhagalpur a large procession of students, who had gone on strike joined also by others, moved throughout the city, made demonstrations before the Courts, hoisted National Flags on the buildings of the Zila School and the Office of the Divisional Inspector of Schools, and shouted slogans appealing to the Police and other Government servants to join the Movement. There was almost general hartal in the eity. A well attended meeting was organised in the afternoon in the Lajpat Park in which some speeches were delivered on the THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 37 Congress policy for the Movement. The principal speakers at this meeting, viz., Shri Kirti Narayan Singh, Shii Jamayet Singh, Shri Har Narayan Jain, Shri Deo Narayan Mishra and others in ‘A’ list were arrested on the 11th August and prosecuted under Defence of India Rules. Government officers posted strong Police force during the night in the Court area, and also in the Congress Office to prevent, as they appre- hended, its reoccupation by Congressmen. Next day con- stables were posted at each High School there. By now the following programme' of activities was made known to many: “From the lime this disastrous War has begun there has been a question before India as to what is her position in it. British Government has taken to War without asking its willingness. British Government has al- ways proclaimed that she has joined the War as she wants to protect the independence and democracy of all other countries. India then questioned that if they are fighting foi the indepen- dence and democracy of the world, the same should be granted to it also without any delay, but as yet no definite reply* has been received. India also wants that she should help in the preservation of independence and democracy of the world with its full strength. But how can India do it unless she is independent? Hence she (India) has always appealed to the British Government and her allies that she should be granted freedom at once so that she might be able to help in it and help China and Russia. But it is now clear that the British Government does not want to free India of the bond- age and is satisfied to take whatever work the British Govern- ment can by means of repression. But India is not satisfied with this. Hence the ‘All India Congress Committee’ has decided that not only for the freedom of India but also to preserve and help in the freedom of other countries of the world, even for England, America and etc., she should be free. Keeping this end in view so that the independence, democracy and freedom of the world be preserved, the Con- gress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi has decided to wage Mon-Violent Non-Co-operation and Satyagraha with the 1. Circular Mo. 1, Bihar Congress Committee, Patna 38 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR British Government. It is just possible that the British Govern- ment will not allow the Congress to lead this Mon-violent Mon- Co-operation and Satyagraha movement. Hence some of the instructions are given below so that the general public might go with the Revolution even after the arrest of Congress leaders. This war is the last War during the life time of Mahatma Gandhi and also the last war for the Swaraj. It is not being waged for any small cause. In this War there is also the question of world peace and welfare and the question of ending the present fearful war. Hence it is hoped that every Indian, who has got love for his country and who wants its freedom, will without any hesitation join it. Without sacrifice, no country has got its independence. We too have to be ready for it (sacrifice) and join it. The countries that are fighting for it (independence) have to shed blood like water and throw the wealth in ocean and in the fire. We have to take our independence from ( ? for) a country like this. This can be achiev- ed only by sacrifice. We should always remember that the real weapon for this Mon-Co-operation and Satyagraha is Non-viol- ence. Hence we should not do anything which is against Non-violence and against the laws of truth. It is hoped that every Indian will play his part for this great cause {Tajna) and lead this to a successful termination. All should work according to the instructions of Mahatma Gandhi or other leaders till it is published and after that they should work according to the following instructions:— 1. How to Make this War for Independence Successful : — After the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders hartal should be observed for the whole day. In this hartal, traders, students, Vakils, Mukhtears, Labourers, Gariwans, Rickshaw-walls, Government servants, Zemindars, Kisans, etc., all should join. After the day’s hartal a meeting should be held in which the resolutions, which the Working Committee has passed, to be put before the All-India Congress Committee which is to meet on 5.8.42 (or 8.8.42), be resolved. 2. Workers should go from one village to another and tell the villagers the instructions of Mahatma Gandhi and other leaders and make them ready for all kinds of sacrifices. \\ THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 39 3. Meetings should be held and processions taken out in every town and village. In the processions slogans for Independence be sung and in the meetings people should be taught what Independence is. If the British Government puts any sort of ban on these meetings and processions tliey should be disobeyed. 4. Vakils and Mukhtears should leave their occupations, and. work for the successful termination of the programme. 5. Students should leave their schools and colleges and join the Movement. Much is expected from the students and it is hoped that they will fulfill it. 6. It is appealed to the Police brothers that they should not fire at the men who are engaged in this war or disperse, them with lathi charge. 7. Workers should not be afraid of the lathi charges and shooting and face these bravely. They should never step behind and leave non-violence and resort to violence. 8. People should not pay their Chaukidari taxes and Union taxes. Chaukidars and Dafadars are . requested to resign their services, and join the Movement. 9. Policemen and jail warders are requested to resign from the Government services. Government will ask them to perform such works of vices which will do a great harm to the country. They will be forced to shoot and charge lathi at the Congress Workers. To save themselves from this vice they should at once leave their services. If all our Police brothers will leave their employments, it will do a great harm to the British Government. 10. Government servants are requested to resign their services. 11. Railway workers, men working on Steamers, Postal employees. Coal-mine workers and labourers of Jamshedpur Factory and of similar other factories are requested to give up their services. 12. Those who will resign at the call from the Congress, will be re-employed after Independence with full pay. The 40 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAK land and other property of those people, who for joining the campaign will be taken possession of by the Government, will be returned after Independence. 13. Village Panchayats should be formed to grow more food to help the Movement and ior the protection of life and property. 14. Arrangements should be made for the regular supply ol information regarding the war for Independence. Workers should give information of their area to other workers at the appointed time and place. 15. National Flag should be hoisted on Government build- ings and employees should be requested to join the Move- .ment. Weapons should be snatched from the Policemen and kept at a safe place. Gov^emment offices should be closed and clerks, etc., assured that they will be again re-called to join their services after Independence. 16. To work in a hidden way weakens and brings bad resultjs to the Satyagraha movement. Hence all programmes should be first made public and then work should start on that line.” The issue of this programme intensified the struggle and quickened its pace. In all parts of the Patna District there were spontaneous hartals and processions and National Flags were hoisted at some places on the 11th August. At about 6 A.M. National Flag was hoisted in the open space in front of the O.D. Room of the Patna Medical College. In the Patna City area a large procession entered the City Court area and hoisted National Flag on the roof of the S.D.O.’s Court. Twelve persons were arrested in the compound of the Gul- zarbagh Cottage Industries Institute for attempting to hoist National Flag on the Institute building. At Dinapur a pro- cession, led by Shri Sitaram Kesari and Shri Harekrishna Sinha, was dispersed by the Police after a lathi charge at the bridge leading to the cantonment area. A procession at Khagaul was similarly dispersed by the Police, who arrested twelve persons there. Processions were taken out at Futwah, Bakhtiyarpur and Barh and some persons were arrested at \\ 1942 Martyrs' Memorial {i?i front of the Patna Seewtaiiat) THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 41 those places, three volunteers of Bakhtiyarpur being arrested at the Bakhtiyarpur Railway Station. At Barh the proces- sionists hoisted National Flag on the S.D.O’s Court room and they were dispersed by a lathi charge. Shri Deo Saran Singh addressed two meetings in support of the Movement and was arrested just hs the second meeting was over. Patna Secretariat Firing, and its sequel : A very serious situation developed at Patna, and certain events took place here on the 11th of August for which it will be ever reckoned as a memorable day in the history of Bihar’s struggle for freedon. It was a day of heroic martyrdom on the part of some of the youths at the altar of liberty. From early dawn, mobile patrols of constables, armed and with lathis and with Magistrates to guide them, patrolled the Main Road and the Lower Road of the city. With a view to pre- venting movement of processionists towards the New Capital area, the Police posted a strong force of armed Gurkhas as well as a lathi force at the north-eastern corner of the Bankipur Lawn, where the Main Road meets the Lower Road. A large crowd gathered there at about 12.30 P.M., a portion of which was dispersed by the M.M.P. in a westerly direction by furious lathi charges and the others were dispersed by the Gurkhas in the opposite direction by similar means. But the spirit of the people was then too high to be damped by lathi charges or arrests. In no time there was a large crowd of demonstrators in front of the Bankipur Girls’ High School, joined by those whom the M.M.P. had dispersed. They remained there for nearly two hours, though /a^At-charged by the Mounted Police. Several persons received injuries and nine were arrested. Many people had been strongly determined to hoist the National Flag that day on the building of the Patna Secretariat, the citadel of bureaucracy, which was one of the main pillars of foreign rule in the country. With this object thousands of persons, urged by the zeal of patriotism, reached the east- ern gate of the Patna Secretariat by about 2 P.M. The Dist- 42 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR trict Magistrate of Patna, the Additional S.P. and the Sadar S.D.O., had reached there at about 1.30 P.M. and posted a strong force. At about 2-15 P.M. the processionists suc- ceeded in hoisting the Mational Flag on tne eastern gate of the Secretariat and for two hours and a half they struggled hard against the Police force for entering inside the Secretariat compound to hoist the National Flag on the top of the main building. The I.G. and the D.I.G. of Police were also pre- sent on the spot. Six persons were arrested with flags but ’this could not produce any effect on the crowd, which attempted still to proceed ahead boldly and received bullets. At 4.57 P.M., under orders of the District Magistrate, who consulted the I.G. and the D.I.G., thirteen or fourteen rounds were fired on them by the Gurkha Military Police. As a result of gunshots seven students died and several others (about 25) were seriously injured and some received minor injuries. They were taken to the Medical College Hospital. These seven martyrs were: — 1. . Uma Kant Prasad Sinha, s/o Shri Ram Kumar Sinha of village Narendrapur, ,P. O. Hussainganj, P. S. Darauli, District Saran (a student of Class XI of R.M.R. Seminary, Patna). 2. Ramanand Singh, s/o Shri Lakshman Singh of village Sahadatnagar, P.S. Masaurhi, District Patna (a student of Class XI of R.M.R. Seminary, Patna). 3. Satish Prasad Jha, s/o Shri Jagdish Prasad Jha of village Kharhara, P.S. Banka, Bhagalpur (a student of Class XI, Patna Collegiate School). 4. Jagpati Kumar, s/o Shri Sukhraj Bahadur of village Kharathi, P.S. Obra, District Gaya (a student of 2nd year class of B.N. College, Patna). 5. Devi Pado Chaudhury, s/o Shri Devendra Nath Chau- dhury of village Jamalpur, P.S. Bishwanath, Dt. Sylhat (a student of Glass IX of Miller H.E. School, Patna. His father was then serving as a teacher in Punaichak L.P. School, Patna). THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 43 6. Rajendra Singh s/o Shri Sheo Narayan Singh of vil- lage Banwarichak, P.S. Sonepur, District Saran. He was living with his father at village Dhirachawk, P.S. Kotwali, Patna (a student of Matric class in Patna H.E. School). 7. Ramgovind Singh, s/o Shri Devaki Singh of village Dasratha, P.S. Phulwari, District Patna (a student of Matric Class in Poonpoon H.E. School). ■ Out of the processionists, fifty students were arrested and confined in the Bankipur Jail. The Secretariat tragedy made the situation extremely grave. The news reached the town within five minutes, and atonce all shops, both of Hindus and Muslims, were closed. There was an acute tension throughout the city and this dastardly action on the part of the Patna executive brought about “a spell of hatred, ex- citement and indignation.” A procession of many Secretariat Assistants and Chaprasis moved in the Gardanibagh area in the evening, headed by Shri D.P. Tripathi, a store-keeper of the P.H.D., shouting slogans as a protest against the firing. A mass meeting was held in the Medical College compound condemning this bloody action of. the Government. ‘ Heroic sacrifice of lives for the cuse of freedom by seven students of Bihar on the 1 1 th August atonce enkindled a fire throughout the Province, which blazed forth in furious flames seeking, as it were, to consume all that stood for alien domination at the cost of India’s due rights of self determination. Those martyrs had, indeed, most nobly vindicated the maxim of ‘Z)o or Die\\ and many others soon plunged themselves into the stormy ocean of struggle for liberty. A widespread popu- lar upheaval spontaneously appeared as a logical sequel to all this and took henceforth a violent turn. The rapidity with which the Movement spread, and the masses responded to the Congress call, “went,” wrote a Government Officer in a Report, “beyond imagination of the authorities.” On the 12th August, the teachers and the students of the Ram Mohan Roy Seminary held a condolence meeting and passed the following resolution unanimously; “This meeting of the 1. Processions moved in all parts of the city throughout the night. 44 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR teachers and students of the Seminary mourns the very tragic death of the two of the senior and beloved students, namely Umakant Prasad Sinha and Ramanand Singh, and conveys their heartfelt condolence to their parents, friends and rela- tives.” In the early hours of the 12th August a big crowd pro- ceeded from the Patna Medical College compound through the Main Road to the Golghar burning ghat with the dead bodies of the six persons out of the seven, who had died as a result of the firing, and the cremation was performed in the presence of several thousands ol people. The whole town of Patna then wore a desolate look. The students of all the educational institutions continued strike and the local bar was deserted. There was a complete hartal, all shops includ- ing those of the Musalmans were closed, and rickshaws and hackney-carriages ceased to ply. Shri Satya Narayan Sinha, M.L.A (Central), General Secretary, B.P.C.C., and Shri Mahamaya Prasad, President of the Saran District Congress Committee, were arrested that morning at the Patna Junction Railway station on their return from Bombay after attending the All-India Congress Committee meeting. From the morning of the 12th August batches of proces- sions were taken out of the different parts of the towm and moved through the main roads. At about 10 A.M. a proces- sion, joined by many women, marched along. Another pro- cession, consisting mainly of Barristers and Advocates^ of the Patna High Court and students, moved in the High Court area. At midday another procession of Advocates and their clerks came out of the Fligh Court. Very few Advocates W’ere present in the High Court that day. Armed Gurkha force, Mounted Police and constables with lathis were posted to guard Government buildings. Apprehending another attempt on the part of the people to 1. Mrs. Dharmsila Lai, Bar-at-Law, and Shri Gopal Prasad, Bar-at- Law, joined the procession with Congress flags in their hands. Mrs. Lai was arrested and was taken to the District Magistrate, under whose orders she was released. Shri Gopal Prasad resigned membership of the War Committee. THE REVOLUTION OF 1942-43 45 enter the Secretariat premises, the Police kept there all the Gurkhas available in the Reserve as also the M.M.P. and a detachment of the Railway Protection Force. The Wiltshire Regiment soldiers were also removed from the High Court and “kept there as a stand-by.” At about 2 P.M. a small pro- cession came near the Civil Court (Pirbahore) and shouted slogans requesting the pleaders to join them. At about 3 P.A'J., when many Congressmen (102 in number according to a Police Report) were being removed from the Bankipur Jail to the Phulwari Camp Jail, a large crowd assembled near the Bankipur Jail to prevent it. But the Police, by requisi- tioning the Military, forcibly dispersed the crowd and the arrested persons were escorted to the Phulwari Camp Jail in two buses and a station wagon. The District Magistrate of Patna passed the following orders under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code with effect from the 13th August, 1942: “Any assembly of more than four persons within the limit of Patna city and Patna Sadar subdivisions is declared unlawful and is liable .to be dispersed by force. “The curfew order will also be enforced from the same date within the same limit, between the hours 7 P.M. and 5 A.M.” But popular excitement had already risen high and could not be restrained. Soon after the above mentioned incident many people entered the Kadamkuan Post Office and tamper- ed with its records by foiling all the efforts of the Police to oppose them. The policy of paralysing the machinery of administration was henceforth sought to be enforced on a large scale. In the evening a meeting was held at the Con- gress Maidan, Kadamkuan, under the presidentship of Shri Jagat Narayan Lai. It was attended by thousands of people (10,000, according to a Police Report). The following re- solutions were passed in it : “1.

Courts, Jail and other Government institutions and also to burn the records etc., kept there.” 46 FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BIHAR Progress of the Movement : Activities on these "
