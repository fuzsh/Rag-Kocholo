        "text": "SWAMI VIVEKANANDA - Philosopher and Religious Leader. Founder of the Ramakrishna Mission.\n\nHe came to be known as Swami Vivekananda only when he became a sannyasi or monk. His parents called him Narendra. His father Vishwanatha Datta was a lawyer. Narendra was born on 12th January 1863 in Calcutta. As a child he was very lively and naughty. Even as a child Narendra had great respect for sannyasis or ascetics. He would give away anything to anybody if asked for. The spirit of sacrifice and renunciation was already blossoming in him.\n\nNarendra excelled not only in sports; he was quick and alert in his studies as well. After a single reading he could remember any lesson. His memory was amazing. Concentration was the key to his success in studies. By 1880, Narendra passed his Matriculation and Entrance Examination. He joined a college. Day by day, his thirst for knowledge increased. He was particularly fascinated by the secrets of God's. Creation. Apart from history and science, he was well read in Western philosophy. As he advanced in his studies, his thinking faculty developed. Doubts and uncertainties overtook him. He gave up blind beliefs but could not realize the Truth.\n\nSUBHASH CHANDRA BOSE - Militant Freedom Fighter & Founder of the Indian National Army.\n\nNetaji's life\n\n1897: Born to Sri Janaki Nath Basu and Pravabati Devi in Cuttack, Orissa\n\n1913: Stood second in the School leaving examination and took admission in Presidency college, Calcutta.\n\n1915: Passed Intermediate examination in first division.\n\nDR. RAJENDRA PRASAD - Freedom Fighter & The First President of the Republic of India.\n\nDr. Rajendra Prasad, son of Mahadev Sahai, was born in Zeradei village in Bihar on December 3, 1884.\n\nRajendra was a brilliant student throughout school and college. He stood first in the entrance examination of the University of Calcutta and was awarded a Rs. 30 per month scholarship. It was first time that a student from Bihar had excelled. He joined the Calcutta Presidency College in 1902.\n\nThe partition of Bengal in 1905 fueled the swadeshi and boycott movements. The movements had a deep effect on students in Calcutta. One day, residents of his hostel created a bonfire of all the foreign clothing they had. When Rajen went through his belongings he could not find a single item of foreign clothing. In 1915, Rajen passed the Masters in Law examination with honors, winning a gold medal. He then completed his Doctorate in Law to attain the title, Dr. Rajendra Prasad.\n\nLAL BAHADUR SHASTRI - Freedom Fighter and the Second Prime Minister of India.\n\nLal Bahadur Shastri was born in 1905 in Prayag. His father Sharada Prasad, a schoolteacher at the local school, passed away when Lal Bahadur was barely a year and a half. Growing up without a father forced Lal Bahadur to accept responsibility at an early age. He was sent by his uncle to Varanasi to pursue his studies.\n\nAfter a short stay with a family that treated him unkindly, Lal Bahadur stayed with a teacher, Mishraji. Mishraji often sat and told stories about how India lost her freedom to the British to young Lal Bahadur. These conversations later inspired Lal Bahadur to join the struggle for Indian freedom.\n\nAMITABH BACHCHAN - Bollywood Filmstar of Great Fame. Voted the \"Man of the Millenium\" by BBC. The Superstar. The Mega star. The Mr. Bollywood. Mr. Big B.\n\nAmitabh has been the lifeline of bollywood for over two decades. Rejected at his first screen test, Amitabh bounced back with a vengeance in his 1973 hit Janzeer. That film established him as the angry young man of Hindi films. Amitabh never looked back after that. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, any film that had Amitabh in it, was a stupendous success (give or take a couple!)."
