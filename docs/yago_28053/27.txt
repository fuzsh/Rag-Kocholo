I'm asking this question here because potentially multiple projects might be involved.

Władysław I Herman had three documented but unnamed daughters. One could be identified as Agnes, the abbess of first Gandersheim then Quedlinburg. One of the remaining two unnamed daughters married a Russian ("in Rusia viro nupsit") and is generally accepted as the wife of Iaroslav I Sviatopolkovich. The last is documented as having married one of her people ("unam autem sue gentis quidam sibi counivit"), being taken by many, including Charles Cawley, to mean she married a Polish lord. There is no record of any Polish family claiming relation to the Piasts through such a marriage. On the other hand, there is Adelheid de Polonia, the first wife of Diepold III von Vohburg, widely believed to be a daughter of Władysław I Herman and Judith, daughter of emperor Heinrich III. Newer Polish and German literature, referenced by Eduard Hlawitschka in Weshalb war die Auflösung der Ehe Friedrich Barbarossas und Adela von Vohburg möglich? (In: Deutsches Archiv für Erforschung des Mittelalters 61/2005, p. 532) interpret "sue gentis" as referring to Judith and not Władysław I Herman, making his third daughter not married to a Polish lord but a German one.

Would it, therefore, make sense to rename the unnamed third daughter of Władysław I Herman Adelheid or Adelajda and marry her to Diepold III instead of creating an undocumented fourth daughter attached to Władysław I Herman as uncertain as Charles Cawley did?
