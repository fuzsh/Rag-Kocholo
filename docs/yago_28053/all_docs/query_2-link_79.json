        "text": "Zbyslava (also spelt Sbyslava) was one of the many Rurikid princesses who married in Poland. She did not survive long, so she is barely mentioned in history. However, as a Rus princess who married a foreign ruler, it is worth taking a look at her.\n\nZbyslava is estimated to have been born between 1085 and 1090. This is based on the fact that her husband was born in 1086, and their marriage took place in 1102 or 1103. Her father was Sviatopolk II, who became Grand Prince of Kyiv in 1093. At the time of Zbyslava’s birth, he would have been Prince of Novgorod. The identity of Zbyslava’s mother is uncertain. Older literature says that she was a Byzantine princess named Barbara. However, Barbara is now considered fictitious. More recent theories believe that Zbyslava’s mother was from Bohemia’s royal Premyslid dynasty. Another possibility could be that Zbyslava’s mother was Elena, a woman from the Kipchaks, who Sviatopolk was known to marry, however, they are said to have not married until 1094, sometime after Zbyslava would have been born.\n\nIn 1102, Wladyslaw I Herman, Duke of Poland died, and Poland was divided between his two sons, Zbigniew and Boleslaw. Zbigniew was illegitimate, and Boleslaw was born from Wladyslaw’s marriage. Zbigniew saw himself as senior ruler of Poland, but he was contested by Boleslaw. To make his claim, Boleslaw looked for foreign allies in Hungary and Kievan Rus. To seal his alliance with Kievan Rus, a marriage was arranged between Boleslaw and Zbyslava, the daughter of the current Grand Prince of Kyiv.\n\nA papal dispensation was needed for the marriage since Boleslaw and Zbyslava were related. They were both descended from Vladimir the Great, Grand Prince of Kyiv, Boleslaw was his great-grandson, and Zbyslava his great-great-granddaughter. There also appears to be a closer relationship between them. If Sviatopolk’s mother was Gertrude of Poland, Boleslaw and Zbyslava would be second cousins, sharing a pair of great-grandparents, Mieszko II Lambert, King of Poland and Richeza of Lotharingia. If Zbyslava’s mother was a Bohemian princess, the couple would have shared another pair of great-grandparents, Bretislav I, Duke of Bohemia and Judith of Schweinfurt. The Bishop of Krakow, Baldwin, went to Rome to get permission from Pope Paschal II, for this marriage to happen. The pope approved of it.\n\nThe Russian Primary Chronicle reports that on 16 November 1102, Zbyslava was taken to Poland for her marriage. It is believed that Zbyslava’s (step)grandmother, Gertrude, gifted her prayer book to Zbyslava for her wedding. This book is known as the Gertrude Psalter, and survives to this day. Zbyslava and Boleslaw’s wedding probably happened in late 1102 or early 1103. This wedding was described as a lavish affair, but during it conflict arose between Boleslaw and his brother, Zbigniew.\n\nBoleslaw had invited Zbigniew to his wedding. However, Zbigniew refused to attend the wedding, and instead went to Bohemia, where he allied with its Duke, Borivoj II. Zbigniew bribed Borivoj to invade Boleslaw’s lands. The invasion took place while the wedding festivities were still going on, but was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nPractically nothing is known about Zbyslava’s life as Duchess of Poland. She is not even mentioned by name in the chronicle of Gallus Anonymous, which was written during her marriage, and is the primary source for early Polish history. What is known is that Zbyslava and Boleslaw had at least one son, and perhaps two more children together:\n\nWladyslaw II ‘the Exile’, High Duke of Poland (1105-1159)\n\nPerhaps a son, Stanislav (b. 1108) who died in childhood\n\nPerhaps a daughter, maybe named Judith (b. c.1111), who married in 1124 to Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of Murom, from her mother’s Rurikid dynasty.\n\nIn 1107, Boleslaw managed to drive Zbigniew out of Poland and become sole ruler. Zbyslava did not have long to live by this point. The date of her death is uncertain. The fifteenth-century chronicler Jan Dlugosz says that she died in 1108, but she is actually thought to have lived for a few more years. Her date of death is usually thought to have been between 1109 and 1114. Zbyslava would have to have been dead before 1115, when Boleslaw married for a second time. Zbyslava would have not yet been thirty at the time of her death. Chronicles are completely silent on Zbyslava’s death, but it was quite possible her death could have been related to childbirth. Zbyslava’s place of burial is unknown.\n\nIn 1115, Boleslaw married a second time to the German noblewoman, Salomea of Berg. He would have many children with her. The existence of Zbyslava’s son, Wladyslaw, was a source of tension for Salomea and her sons. Due to this, when Boleslaw died in 1138, he divided up Poland between Wladyslaw and his younger half-brothers. This would cause Poland to be a divided country for nearly two centuries to come.\n\nSources\n\nJanicki, Kamil; “Duchess Zbyslava in Gallus Anonymous.
