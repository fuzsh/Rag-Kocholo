        "text": "Dear Mississippienne ~\n\nYour list of children for Agnes of Germany is somewhat incomplete. By\n\nAgnes' first marriage to Friedrich (or Frederick) I, Duke of Swabia and\n\nFranken, Count of Hohenstaufen, she had six children:\n\n1. Friedrich [II] [Duke of Swabia].\n\n2. Conrad (III) [Deutsche König].\n\n3. Gertrud (wife of Hermann von Stahleck, Pfalzgraf bei Rhein).\n\n4. Berta von Boll (wife of Adalbert von Elchingen).\n\n5. Richilde (wife of Hugues, Count of Roucy).\n\n6. Heilica (wife of Friedrich III, Count of Lengenfeld).\n\nBy her second marriage to Leopold III, Margrave of Austria, she had\n\ntwelve children:\n\n1. Adalbert.\n\n2. Heinrich (II) [Duke of Austria].\n\n3. Leopold (IV).\n\n4. Ernst.\n\n5. Otto [Bishop of Freising].\n\n6. Conrad [Bishop of Passau, Archbishop of Salzburg].\n\n7. Bertha (wife of Heinrich III, Burggraf of Regensburg).\n\n8. Agnes (wife of Wladislaw II, Duke of Polen-Schlesien).\n\n9. Gertrud (wife of Vladislav II, Duke of Bohemia).\n\n10. Elisabeth (wife of Hermann II, Count of Winzenburg).\n\n11.Juta/Julitta (or Judith) (wife of Guillaume V de Montferrat).\n\n12.Uta (wife of Liutold I von Plain, Count of Hardegg).\n\nFor further particulars regarding Agnes, her marriages, and her\n\nchildren, you may wish to consult the following weblink:\n\nwww.mittelalter-genealogie.de/mittelalter/staufer/familie_herzog_friedrichs_1/agnes_von_waiblingen_herzogin_von_schwaben_+_1143.html.\n\nBest always, Douglas Richardson, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\nWebsite: www. royalancestry. net\n\n\n\n\n\n18 is a lot, but significantly less than what is given on Miroslav\n\nMarek's website (31!!). I would still like to see primary documentation\n\nthat all those children belonged to Agnes. Could some of them have been\n\nillegitimate but falsely attributed to Agnes? (some of the daughters\n\nespecially didn't make very grand marriages) Working with the\n\nchronology:\n\nAccording to my notes (I'll be happy to revise if they're incorrect)\n\nAgnes married Frederick of Swabia in 1080 and he died in 1105. Then\n\nshe was married to Leopold from about 1105 to 1136, when he died. This\n\ngives her twenty-five years to produce the six by Frederick, not\n\nleaving her many years of fertility to have twelve by Leopold! Even if\n\nall the children by Leopold were twins (very unlikely) she would've\n\nbeen bearing a set of twins a year for six years.\n\nMittelalter as indicated by Douglas Richardson seems to give her only\n\n16 on two sources, 17 in both. Hansmartin Decker-Hauff leaves out Uta,\n\nand Karl Lechner leaves out Adalbert the first Austria what is probably\n\na lapse or a bad transcription.\n\nBut for dates, they say she was born in 1072/3, late 1072 and Summer\n\n1072 (Brandenburg says 1174/5) and her first son was born when she was\n\n16. The only given date for the 1st marriage is 1086 so you should\n\ncheck where your 1080 came from.\n\nThe second marriage was in 1106, when she was 34, Adalbert was born in\n\n1107 and the last one when she was 46.\n\nYou may have noticed that Miroslav's data on the extra 6 of the first\n\nmarriage is sparse, almost none. If anything, they could be\n\nillegitimous of Friedrich Hohenstauffen.\n\nOn the 2nd marriage, Miroslav adds 7 more without name and that died\n\nyoung, so 19 children. But, if by the last one, is meant the last one\n\nof those who did not died young, with some three or four pair of twins,\n\nit was not impossible.\n\nMaybe Miroslav Marek took a bad source - or a bad translation and the\n\nfirst marriage's children were meant - and possibly, as he has\n\nHohenstauffen and Babenberg separated he just made a mess with Agnes'\n\nchildren in both tables and did not noticed it.\n\nRegards,\n\nFrancisco\n\n(Portugal)\n\nMississ...@gmail.com escreveu:\n\n\n\n<francisco.tav...@gmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:1152742137.2...@i42g2000cwa.googlegroups.com...\n\n> Mittelalter as indicated by Douglas Richardson seems to give her only\n\n> 16 on two sources, 17 in both.

The rationale for this theory is that\n\nAdalbert referred to a son of Rudolf of Perg as his \"cognatus\", and that the\n\nbest way to explain this term is by making him the son of St Leopold by\n\nRudolf's sister, who would have been a daughter of Walchun, lord of Perg. No\n\nsource confirms even the existence of such a woman, much less that she was\n\nmarried to St Leopold, and none implies in any way that Adalbert was other\n\nthan a full-sibling to the children of Leopold by Agnes. However, the\n\npossibility cannot be dismissed.\n\n> But for dates, they say she was born in 1072/3, late 1072 and Summer\n\n> 1072 (Brandenburg says 1174/5) and her first son was born when she was\n\n> 16.

The marriage of St Leopold to Agnes did take place in 1106, and she\n\nwas in her 34th year (though maybe not yet turned 34) at the time.\n\n> You may have noticed that Miroslav's data on the extra 6 of the first\n\n> marriage is sparse, almost none.

Of St Leopold's offspring whose names are recorded, all\n\nare treated in the sources as if they were full-siblings. The youngest was\n\napparently Elisabeth who married Count Hermann II of WInzenburg in 1142, and\n\nshe is specifically desribed (by her brother Otto) as the sister of the\n\nGerman king Konrad III - i.e. she must have been his maternal half-sister\n\nand therefore a daughter of Agnes.\n\nThe result of combining information from the few available sources is that\n\nAgnes probably had eleven children by her first husband and at least ten by\n\nher second. This sort of fecundity is by no means unexampled, and I can't\n\nsee a logical reason why Agnes should not have been an example of it.\n\nEmperors' daughters can be freaks of nature just like anyone else. If there\n\nreally were seven other offspring of the second marriage, most or all of\n\nthem would surely have been twins with others who survived childhood and\n\nwhose names are known, as clearly there must be a limit to the number of\n\npregnancies to term that a woman can have after her 34th year.\n\nPeter Stewart\n\n\"Rashid Amora\" <doo...@hotmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:f0ab9$44b753c9$5038d469$13...@news.chello.nl...\n\n> Agnes was know to have 21 children.

'Hadalwigis seu Heilice comitissae Friderici comitis' [Eilike, who died\n\nafter ca 1110, wife of Friedrich, count of Legenfeld]\n\n2. 'Bertrade seu Berthe comitisse Adalberti comitis' [Bertha of Boll, died\n\nafter 1120, wife of Adalbert, count of Elchingen]\n\n3. 'Friderici ducis Juditte ducisse Agnetis ducisse' [Friedrich II the\n\nOne-Eyed, duke of Swabia, died 4/6 April 1147, married firstly Judith (died\n\n22 February ca 1130/5), daughter of Heinrich IX the Black, duke of Bavaria;\n\nmarried secondly Agnes, daughter of Friedrich I, count of Saarbrücken]\n\n4. 'Hildegardis...' [followed by an illegible word, not known further]\n\n5. 'Cuonradi regis Gertrudis regine item Gertrudis regine' [Konrad III,\n\nGerman king, died 15 February 1152, married firstly Gertrud (died before ca\n\n1134/5), daughter of Heinrich, count of Comburg & Rothenburg; married\n\nsecondly Gertrud (died 14 April 1140), daughter of Berengar II, count of\n\nSulzbach]\n\n6. 'Gisilhildis seu Gisile' [Gisela or Gisihild, not known further]\n\n7. 'Henrici pueris' [Heinrich, said to have died ca 1102]\n\n8. 'Beatricis abbatisse' [Beatrix, abbess of an unknown convent, thought to\n\nhave died after ca 1130]\n\n9. 'Cunigundis seu Cunisse ducisse' Henrici ducis' [Kunigunde or Cunizza,\n\ndied after ca 1120/perhaps before May 1127, whose husband was possibly\n\nHEINRICH X the Proud, duke of Bavaria & Saxony (died 20 October 1139)\n\n10. 'Sophie comitisse Adalberti comitis' [Sophia, wife of a Count Adalbert\n\nwho could be any one of several suggested candidates]\n\n11. 'Fidis seu Gertrudis palatine Herimanni palatini' [Fides or Gertrud,\n\ndied 1142/9, wife of Hermann III of Stahleck, count palatine of the Rhine,\n\n(died 1158)].\n\nAs you can see, there are not seven here who might have died in childhood,\n\nbut only three. Also there are only three whose identifications are\n\nundoubted, leading some authorities to ignore the rest - however, no-one has\n\nsuggested a plausible alternative to explain their appearance together in\n\nthis list.\n\nPeter Stewart\n\n> \"Peter Stewart\" <p_m_s...@msn.com> schreef in bericht\n\n> news:mmrtg.4375$tE5....@news-server.bigpond.net.au...\n\n\n\n<Mississ...@gmail.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:1153100964.5...@35g2000cwc.googlegroups.com...\n\n\n\nThere is a smigeon less doubt over this than would be the case if a\n\nchronicle did in fact write she was in her 34th year (although there may be\n\nsuch a statement for all I know).\n\nMedieval monks were erratic in their counting of years, often approximating\n\nvaguely or confusing ordinal & cardinal numbering. On the other hand we know\n\nthe AD of her second marriage (1106) and we know that she was born between\n\none brother who was born at the beginning of August 1071 and another who was\n\nborn on 12 February 1074, ergo in 1072/3. Arithmetic does the rest, as\n\nsecurely as any chronicler. Explicit sources account for much but not all of\n\nour knowledge concerning medieval people, especially those whose families\n\nwere as prominent as that of the Salian emperors.\n\nPeter Stewart"
