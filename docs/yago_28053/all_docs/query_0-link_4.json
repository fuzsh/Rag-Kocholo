Judith-Maria of Swabia\n\nSophia of Poland\n\nAbbess Agnes of Poland I of Quedlinburg\n\nAdelaide of Poland\n\nDuke Wladyslaw Herman of Poland I\n\nBorn: Cir 1044\n\nMarriage (1): Judith Premyslid of Bohemia\n\nMarriage (2): Judith-Maria of Swabia in 1089\n\nDied: 4 Jun 1102 aged about 58\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nAs the second son, Wladyslaw was not destined for the throne. However, due to the flight from Poland of his older brother Boleslaw II the Bold in 1079, he was elevated to the rank of Duke of Poland. Opinions vary on whether Wladyslaw played an active role in the plot to depose his brother or whether he was handed the authority simply because he was the most proper person, being the next in line in the absence of the king and his son Mieszko Boleslawowic.\n\nWladyslaw married Judith Premyslid of Bohemia, daughter of King Vratislaus of Bohemia II and Adelaide of Hungary. (Judith Premyslid of Bohemia was born circa 1056 and died on 25 Dec 1086.)\n\nWladyslaw next married Judith-Maria of Swabia, daughter of Henry of Germany III, Holy Roman Emperor and Agnes of Pointou, in 1089. (Judith-Maria of Swabia was born on 9 Apr 1054 and died circa 1105.)"
