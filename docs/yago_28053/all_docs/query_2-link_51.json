        "text": "Storm clouds gather over Europe. Mistrust and rivalries between realms threaten to break and flood the world in tide of Total War.\n\nHello all, I've wanted to this a long time ago, but never could manage to properly take care of it. But now I am fully attached to it, so there will be plenty of action.\n\nAs you can see this will be about Medieval 2 Total War - the best Total War there is. I know that Rome 2 is around the corner, but the climax of Medieval era is far greater than ancient one. The carnage of peasants dying all over the place, and heavily cladded knights massacring everything on the way.\n\nI'll be playing as a Polish nation. Not because it is the best - that is the place of the French, but it is fun to play, plenty of options and the possibility to murder Germans (ekhm Holy Roman Empire) and the Russians.\n\nAs you can see, our strengths lies in the cavalry and that is true in one point, the other point is that cavalry is high tier only. The famed hussars are very strong unit, then there are Polish Knights which also are excellent heavy cavalry unit. Unfortunately for Knights we need Citadel upgrade and Hussars needs that or the biggest city upgrade. On the earlier part we have Polish Nobles, which act also like a missile cavalry. They are armed with powerful javelins. The range is small but can massacre everything armoured. The number of javelins is pretty low but when that is gone, they still are good heavy cavalry unit. And also one of the biggest advantages of all Slavic nations including Russians that we can field mounted missile units. The Polish have \"Strzelcy\" unit - a mounted unit with light crossbow. Very deadly and extremely usefull and it is first tier unit so any castle can have them. Then there are Lithuanian horse archers, which are also castle units but require fortress upgrade and the best archery building, which means they are medium tier unit. I forgot also about Polish Retainers - a Fortress upgrade unit. They are poor mans heavy cavalry. They are nothing out of ordinary, will mostly have quite a casualties, but if used correctly in flanking maneuvers they can do their job good.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin our infantry lacks any real good units. As they say mediocre infantry. That is true in the early part of the game. Only noticeable unit we have early are dismounted polish nobles - which are spearmen unit. They can murder mounted units with little problems but they will fail with most of the western units. The other units are of course peasants, woodsmen with big axes. But again no fear as with Citadel upgrade here comes Dismounted Polish Knights which are excellent melee heavy infantry units.\n\nAs for the settings. Long campaign, because this is Total War not yours boy scout adventure. The difficulty will be medium, because I don't like any cheats that AI gets with higher difficulties.\n\nSo of we go.\n\nSo here we are Poland 1080 AD\n\nOur starting provinces. Krakow our capital city, and a castle in Halycz.\n\nOur starting units. King Wladysaw, Prince Zbigniew and Boleslaw Herman and Princess Agnes which acts like diplomat agent (all princesses act like that until they get married or if reach age of 30+ they go to monasteries).\n\n--- History Facts.\n\nLet's take a break and take a few history facts. The base of the game is in theory accurate. But there ale always buts. Wladysaw Herman wasn't really a king - but I can understand because of the game mechanics and also he was noted as one of the good leaders in our history. Zbigniew Herman was a bastard son, so in theory he shouldn't be faction heir to be honest, but he was also a Duke so whatever.\n\nBoleslaw Herman was actually a true heir after he won brother war against Zbigniew. He was also noted as one of the good rulers.\n\nPrincess Agnes wasn't the only daughter of Wladyslaw Herman, but the other 3 never had any impact on history and were married quickly.\n\nThe division the intro speaker said is I guess the fact, that before 1080 there was an uprising in the pomerania regions, and now in game the Thorn (Torun) and Stettin (Szczecin) are in rebel hands. The Breslau (Wroclaw) - a Silesian region, Wladyslaw admitted that it should belong to the Bohemia and payed tribute, but since there is no Bohemian nation, the region is controlled by the rebels.\n\nWhy do we have Halycz region if this is in theory Ukraine territory? I probably won't give you a correct answer for this, since that region was I think acquired by some nobility declarations or whatever. Also I think that Ukrainian region was held in Polish land for a very long time or at least the influence was very high there.\n\n---\n\nOk enough with boring facts.\n\nThe first thing to do is to of course build something. Because we are the last bastion of Christianity in the central Europe and further east the lands are full of blasphemers and infidels and trust me religion is very important, we need to hire a priests to convert the wicked lands and convert fast to keep with the expansion.\n\nSo we need to have as many churches as possible and have an army of priests to do the converting. We also start with a very powerful cardinal, that may later become the pope - but chances are that he will not. Each church/chapel (castle structure) allows us to have 1 additional priest. And I think every upgrade gives another slot. The downside of priest army is that each priest costs us 100 florins (the currency of the game) upkeep (as if they didn't find a way to get wealth from the peasants).\n\nAs for the military we will need some early town militia units either to bolster our invasion force or just to protect the cities and maintain some orders. Because our capital is of standard city size we have only 2 recruitment slots. Further in the queue there are a merchant agent and a diplomat. A merchant is an agent that can bolster our income by trading resources or acquiring assets of other nations merchants (a very powerful ability). If successful in acquisition he provides our treasury with some florins and if the other merchant was very experienced the amount of money can be very high. And because they are merchants they pay for themselves, but initial recruitment cost is 500 florins so as you can see merchant has to do something good to pay for himself. Also about the priests - during conversion if their religion is not dominant they can turn into heretics and heresy is the worst modifier, so another priest must be sent to deal with the heretic.\n\nIn Halycz, the same thing.\n\nA small chapel and a dirt road so armies can move faster. As for military units, we can only hire the best, since peasants and archers require additional buildings that aren't present at the moment.\n\nThe prince Zbigniew will move towards eastern regions, maybe he will take some regions before Hungary will.\n\nOur inital plan is to capture all neighboring provinces to the north and west until we reach to border of HRE - maybe we can capture some territory before they will. Then split the army in two and one side will go east and face the Russians, the other should invade Hungary, to get closer to Constantinople and have better position for crusades.\n\nBoleslaw can on the first turn attack Thorn castle and he will do so.\n\nOf course he will have to wait 1-2 turns to build some siege equipment. The ram is the most important since it will smash the frontal gates open, then there are ladders with are 100% guarantee of placement - well unless enemy fields so many archers that the unit will route before it will place them. However ladders don't provide excellent storming power since it will be mostly few units against a hundreds of others and since our starting units are weak the ladders must be used rather as a flanking maneuver. The siege towers however take longer time to build, longer time to place, and the AI has strange success rate of destroying theme by fire, even in ridiculous conditions, but if placed they give good bonus towards attack since the attackers can flood the defenders, but if you will put peasants against knights, not even that bonus will help.\n\nThe King will take his army and attack the Breslau it will take 2 turns to reach, so on the mid way our council of nobles propose a mission with a reward of 2500 florins for capturing Breslau.\n\nAs if they read my mind.\n\nSince it is a village and no defenses are present we can storm the village right away, and since we can't wait because the HRE can take the lands we want to, we will attack.\n\nOf course since the enemy has nowhere to run they are all exterminated - they are rebels after all. And because they had few archer units and most sieges will bring casualties (mostly peasants), we had to lose some units.\n\nHaving captured the province three options are placed. Peaceful occupation brings little money, no damage to the city/castle, no civilians die. Sacking will yield the most money - the bigger the region the more money, probably some buildings will be destroyed and some population will die. This is good option if you want to raid the province and retreat. Last option exterminate, reduces extremely population and gives some profit. It is good option if you are invading a very hostile territory for example muslim lands if you are christian, and want to reduce the disorder from the population and religion. But since we are the good side, mostly I will be using peaceful occupation.\n\nHaving new province we need to take care of it. The palisade, will give some basic protection and is the first step for this village to become prosperous city. Next some land clearing will improve some income and growth.\n\nThat also completes the mission. 2500 florins is always nice.\n\nAlso our King gains Shieldbearer retinue and Veteran Warrior.\n\nBuilding that church also improved our reputation with the papal state. Also the pope is a Git.\n\nAlso after those 2 turns, Boleslaw can assault the Thorn.\n\nAnd like I said, the AI has the tendency to burn something, this time it was the ram.\n\nBut the siege towers landed. Unfortunately poor mans army results in high casualties.\n\nIt will take few turns to hire some units. But we can't sit idly, something has to be built. Thorn can already be upgraded to normal castle, but it can wait for a while.\n\nNext in line will be Magdeburg castle. Our spy is able to reveal its inhabitants.\n\nNext building in Krakow will be mines. Mines will help improve our economy.\n\nSince Hlaycz has completed chapel and roads it is time to upgrade it into a real castle.\n\nAgain the nobles gives a mission that I was already on the way. They want us to meet the Hungarians and our princess was already on the scene.\n\nMap information is the basic thing you can negotiate and everyone will accept unless they know everything about your lands.\n\nI can also propose marriage which forms some sort of alliance, but since my plan is to attack Hungary at one point only map information is exchanged.\n\nEach agent action also should rise the skill of said agent on successful attempt. In case of princesses it is charm. Marrying high charm princess can be also beneficial for the husband so sometimes it is best to wait before accepting marriage.\n\nSo easy money for easy task.\n\nAnd prince Zbiginew has finally reached Iasi and is besieging it. Motte & Bailey is the first form of the castle so there are no walls to capture and only ram is the option for the assault.\n\nMeanwhile as always the game will present a candidate for the princess. Every time is a new generated person and it is up to you to accept or not. Thankfully I was able to at least finish the mission and meet the Hungary.\n\nThis here men is a very good candidate indeed. Just look at his loyalty. A marriage will improve it too, so we will have a general that will die in our cause and never he will be bribed (unless the AI will provide with millions of florins).\n\nSee? For now he will be governor of the Krakow, since the King is on the mission of unification of the land. Also Polish generals mostly make poor governors, simply I think by the sad jest of the CA, as many of generals tend to be either alcoholic, stupid, ignorant or whatever that reduces public order and tax income. Also as strange as it is, the trait Abhors drink also gives penalty to the happiness. I guess all despise persons that don't want to drink.\n\nIncreasing our dominance has pleased the nobles of our land.\n\nIt's time for Prince Zbigniew to assault Iasi, and since he has night attacker trait (the best trait in the whole Total War series), we will attack under the cover of night.\n\nDuring the attack before our ram reached the gate, the defenders suddenly attack.\n\nWell good for us as it will allow other units to attack from the side.\n\nOnly 150 units died this day.\n\nIasi is a castle type place, but we truly don't need a castle here, since Halych is nearby. Therefore I will convert it to the city.\n\nOn the other side King Wladyslaw is storming Magdeburg. He will snatch it from the HRE nose.\n\nMeanwhile our spy hops into Stettin castle. Looks very defended.\n\nStettin is also quick to grab place since it is also the prime target for either HRE or the Danes.\n\nAlso every city has to have one of those. No matter how prudent you are, those places will exist till the end of the world.\n\nAnd because we need to improve our income and rise non military army, a market is also queued.\n\nAnd a land clearance to improve to growth. We want our capital to be very large city fast.\n\nBreslau also needs its improvements.\n\nNow if you don't have a princess that is not family related, each of your famili members can be presented a random bride.\n\nWhat a man is without a wife and the family must get larger in order for the nation to thrive.\n\nAlso it is funny how those guards stand. And do notice how they describe that this is all only for breeding purposes\n\nBecause I've left Halych empty as all the produced units were sent to Prince Zbigniew army, the nobles wants to put some units there. Well producing units is more costly than the reward and I don't really need new units yet. I'll probably skip this mission.\n\nMeanwhile in Krakow our army of priests rises and some of the units that attacked either Thorn or Breslau get retrained.\n\nAfter few resting turns and few turns to get in place Boleslaw is in the position of besieging Stettin province.\n\nAnd because it is well defended he will probably wait those 3 turns. The defenders will either surrender due to hunger or retaliate. I'm building that ram just in case the other option.\n\nAlso our diplomat that is pathetic reached HRE borders. He will have to improve his skill with some map information trading.\n\nP.S. I am poor with diplomatics. Mostly I will be \"Die or Bow\".\n\nThe king can finally assault Magdeburg.\n\nAnd I don't know how I did it but I've managed to stomp the defenders pretty hard.\n\nThe second option of acquiring generals is by adoption. There is a chance that some poor soul will be presented for adoption to current King or Heir.\n\nBut his loyalty speaks badly of him so I must decline.\n\nAfter those 3 turns the rebels decided to counter our siege.\n\nWhich was a better option for us and our casualties were a bit lower.\n\nAs I was saying about our merchants, here one of ours manages to acquire some poor fools assets. Of course the acquisition can backfire too and also the game has tendency to success o 15% success and fail on 75%.\n\nAfter I did not meet eye to eye with last mission, the nobles again ask to put some defenses as if rebels were to attack.\n\nAnd here is the first child of Zygmunt. That maiden in the blue also looks \"fertile\" to me\n\nAnd speaking of rebels. There might appear some in the wilderness. It is good to clear them as they create devastation that lowers public order.\n\nThe casualties are only because they had archers.\n\nSometimes generals that don't get to see action lose some loyalty because we think they are worthless. But if you let them fight often, they gain loyalty because we appreciate their skills."
