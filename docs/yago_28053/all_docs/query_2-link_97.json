        "text": "Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) (1932-2022)\n\nHerman may be spelt German, Germanos.\n\nBasil may be spelt Basilios, Wasil, Wasyl, Vasil, Vasili.\n\nSwaiko may be spelt Swajko, Szwajka.\n\nHelen may be spelt Ellen.\n\nHericz may be spelt Herich, Headacha.\n\nEarly life of Joseph Swaiko\n\nOn 1 February, 1932, Joseph Swaiko was born to Basil Swaiko and his wife Helen (born Hericz) in Bairdford, West Deer Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is a suburb of Pittsburgh.\n\nBasil (Wasil) Swaiko had been born in Wolasauka, in what is now known as Slovakia, and he emigrated to the USA in 1910 (at age 18). After his marriage to Helen Hericz (who had arrived from Slovakia in 1913), they received from the Lord 10 children : John, Charles, Alex, Michael, Mary (Kokoruda), George, Helen (Shurina), Richard, Joseph, and Irene (Weischedel).\n\nJoseph (almost the youngest child) was baptised and raised by his family in Bairdford as an Orthodox Christian within the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church of North America (ROGCCNA) in Saint Michael's Russian Orthodox Church in Curtisville, Pennsylvania. This parish was founded in 1918.\n\nHe completed his primary and secondary education in the West Deer Township school district.\n\nJoseph Swaiko, 1950\n\nHigher education\n\nJoseph Swaiko enrolled in Robert Morris College, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he graduated with honours, and received an associate degree in secretarial science.\n\nJoseph Swaiko, parents, parish priest\n\nUSA military service\n\nJoseph (as did his elder brothers before him) subsequently began his compulsory military service in the US Army. He served as a company clerk in the Adjutant General's Corps of the United States Army, and he was stationed in Labrador and Newfoundland, Canada. He completed his military service, and he was discharged in 1959.\n\nMilitary service\n\nThe American Military presence in Newfoundland and Labrador (at Goose Bay, Labrador) had begun in 1941, and the continuation of this presence after World War II had to do with “NATO” commitments and responsibilities, particularly during the “Cold War”.\n\nBoth Newfoundland and Labrador (especially Labrador) were very sparsely populated at that time, and they continued to be so. Despite the presence of other military personnel in any of the possible sites in that region, there was truly “nowhere else to go”. The remote military sites made them fit the saying about being “in the back of beyond”. Moreover, it had been only in 1949 that Newfoundland had entered the Canadian Confederation after having been a colony of the British Empire since 1610. Joseph's completion of his military obligation in 1959 coincided with the tenth anniversary of that change of status.\n\nBereavement, 1956\n\nOn 21 January, 1956, Michael Swaiko fell asleep in the Lord in San Francisco, California (at age 33).\n\nMichael had served in the US Army during World War II.\n\nAfter the funeral services, his body was interred at Lakewood Memorial Gardens, Dorseyville, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.\n\nMichael Swaiko was survived by his parents and by all his siblings.\n\nSaint Tikhon's Seminary, 1959\n\nAfter his honourable discharge from the army in 1959, Joseph Swaiko enrolled at Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary.\n\nSaint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary\n\nSoon after Vladyka Kiprian (Borisevich) was assigned to serve as the Rector of Saint Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary in 1962, he chose the student Joseph Swaiko to serve as his personal secretary.\n\nArchbishop Kiprian (Borisevich)\n\nJoseph graduated from the seminary in 1963. At that time, he received the Licentiate Diploma.\n\nAfterwards, Joseph continued in his secretarial service with Vladyka Kiprian.\n\nOrdinations, 1964\n\nIn March, 1964, Joseph Swaiko was ordained to the Holy Diaconate by Archbishop Kiprian (Borisevich).\n\nHe was ordained as a celibate deacon.\n\nArchbishop Kiprian (Borisevich) ordaining Deacon Joseph Swaiko\n\nOn 7 April, 1964, Deacon Joseph Swaiko was ordained to the Holy Priesthood by Archbishop Kiprian (Borisevich).\n\nPriest Joseph Swaiko\n\nPriest Joseph Swaiko and his parents\n\nPastoral service\n\nPriest Joseph Swaiko was subsequently assigned to serve on the seminary's administrative staff (in which he served as registrar), and also to serve as an instructor for the Church Slavonic language.\n\nCentral portion of Saint Tikhon's Monastery, Seminary and Cemetery\n\nDuring this time, Father Joseph had also been assigned to serve as the rector of the Temples of Saint John the Baptist in Dundaff (Clifford Township), and Saint Peter and Paul in Union Dale, both in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. Father Joseph nurtured the parishes with love, and a mutual respect developed between the pastor and the rational sheep.\n\nIn 1965, Father Joseph organised the first summer camp for children at the Seminary and Monastery. He also inspired the formation of the Orthodox Christian Fellowship at Bloomsburg State College, and he served as its chaplain.\n\nFather Joseph was appointed to the seminary’s accreditation committee, and he was instrumental in forming the seminary’s Board of Trustees, of which he was a charter member and secretary-treasurer. For many years he also served as spiritual advisor to the “Anthracite District” of the “Federated Russian Orthodox Clubs”, which later became the “Fellowship of Orthodox Christians in America”.\n\nFather Joseph contributed greatly to the improvement and physical expansion of the seminary and the monastery. From his early days (with the blessing of Vladyka Kiprian), he gave his time and his seemingly endless energy towards these ends.\n\nWhen Saint Tikhon's Seminary was incorporated officially in 1967, Father Joseph Swaiko was one of the charter members, and he was listed as the secretary-treasurer of the corporation.\n\nHis participation in the leadership of the seminary came at a time when the seminary was in the midst of a substantial increase in the nature and number of physical facilities being prepared for the better functioning of the seminary. Many changes were also in progress with regard to the provision of higher academic standards and opportunities for accreditation of the quality of the education being given.\n\nIt was in October, 1967, that the seminary was directly involved in the establishment of the Orthodox Inter-Seminary Movement (OISM).\n\nIn 1970, following the glorification of Saint Herman of Alaska, Father Joseph (who had already long considered this step) felt in his heart that it was time to ask to be tonsured to be a monk, and that he embrace this path since not only was he devoting his whole life to serving the Lord, but he also was living already amongst the monastic brethren.\n\nSaint Tikhon's Monastery\n\nMonastic tonsure, 1970\n\nOn 4 December, 1970, the Priest Joseph Swaiko was tonsured to be a monk at Saint Tikhon's Monastery by Bishop Kiprian (Borisevich). He was given the name Herman, in honour of Saint Herman of Alaska, the first saint glorified in the newly-autocephalous Orthodox Church in America.\n\nOn 17 October, 1971, Hieromonk Herman (Swaiko) was elevated to the dignity of igumen.\n\nAt the same time, Igumen Herman was assigned to serve as the Deputy-Abbot (“Namestnik”) of the Saint Tikhon of Zadonsk Orthodox Monastery.\n\nIn 1970 and 1971, Father Herman participated in the First All-American Council and the Second All-American Council, which were both convened in the facilities of Saint Tikhon's Monastery and Seminary.\n\nIn 1971, Father Herman participated in the decision to renew and to pursue the quest to achieve academic recognition for Saint Tikhon's Seminary as a graduate school. More measures were taken, further to previous developments, in order to increase and strengthen the number of the faculty, and also of the quality of their academic qualifications. Although the association with Marywood College had thus far been beneficial for the seminary, it could only be a temporary measure. Marywood College provided accredited academic courses that both prepared for and supplemented theological study for students. The process of working towards accreditation for the seminary itself took time, but it bore fruit with God's help.\n\nAt the October, 1972, session of the Holy Synod of Bishops of The Orthodox Church in America, Igumen Herman (Swaiko) was elected to become a bishop.\n\nIgumen Herman (Swaiko) was immediately elevated to the dignity of archimandrite.\n\nArchimandrite Herman (Swaiko)\n\nEpiscopal ordination, 1973\n\nOn Friday, 9 February, 1973, in the evening, the Vigil Service of Vespers and Matins was offered in Holy Resurrection Cathedral in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Metropolitan Ireney (Bekish) presided at this time. Metropolitan Ireney, accompanied by Archbishop Kiprian (Borisevich), Archbishop Sylvester (Haruns), Archbishop Valerian (Trifa), Bishop Theodosius (Lazor) and Bishop Dmitri (Royster), witnessed Archimandrite Herman's Profession of Faith and his words of acceptance of his election. He was presented to them formally by Mitred Archpriest Alexander Schmemann.\n\nOn Saturday, 10 February, 1973, Archimandrite Herman (Swaiko) was ordained to the Holy Episcopate in Holy Resurrection Cathedral in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

These were done in part to honour the Millennium of the Baptism of Russia.\n\nUltimately, these improvements included the construction of a substantial mausoleum on the territory of the cemetery, to the south of Saint Tikhon's Road. After its construction, the coffins of various bishops and others were entombed there, and the name and dates were marked on the marble covering of each tomb.\n\nMausoleum at Saint Tikhon's Monastery Cemetery\n\nBereavement, 1989\n\nOn 9 July, 1989, Alex Swaiko fell asleep in the Lord in Bairdford, Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter the Funeral Service, his body was interred at Lakewood Memorial Gardens, Dorseyville, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.\n\nAlex was predeceased by his parents and by his brother Michael ; he was survived by his wife, Anne (born Painteric) ; by his brothers, Bishop Herman, John, Charles, George, Richard ; and by his sisters Mary, Helen and Irene.\n\nVisits of Patriarch Aleksey II (Ridiger), 1993\n\nIn 1991 and 1993, Patriarch Aleksey II (Ridiger) of Moscow and All Russia made fraternal visits to The Orthodox Church in America. Bishop Herman was active and involved in the organisation and progress of both visits.\n\nBishop Herman with Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor) and Patriarch Aleksey II (Ridiger) at Saint Tikhon's Monastery Pavilion\n\nArchbishop, 1994\n\nIn 1994, Bishop Herman (Swaiko) was elevated to the dignity of archbishop.\n\nGlorification of Saint Alexis Toth, 1994\n\nThe Righteous Protopresbyter Alexis Toth of Wilkes-Barre was a missionary priest, sent from his homeland in Slovakia as a Uniat, who, in order to serve and protect his flock in a hostile Latin (Roman Catholic) environment in the USA, recognised the need to lead them in a return to their Orthodox Christian heritage.\n\nAbout 85 years after his repose, the grave of the Protopresbyter Alexis Toth was uncovered and opened. His body was found to be intact, that is, incorrupt. This process was guided by Vladyka Herman.\n\nVladyka Herman leading the uncovering of the Holy Relics of Saint Alexis Toth\n\nOn 29-30 May, 1994, the Protopresbyter Alexis Toth was glorified as Saint Alexis of Wilkes-Barre by the Holy Synod of Bishops of The Orthodox Church in America, during services at Saint Tikhon's Monastery.\n\nArchbishop Herman (Swaiko) was responsibile for much of the organisation of the events concerning the Service of Glorification, especially at the monastery. He was also careful about the hosting of the many guests from abroad who were present on this occasion, as well as of the many local bishops.\n\nConference of Orthodox Bishops in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, 1994\n\nArchbishop Herman represented the OCA at numerous events abroad, as he often travelled along with Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor). He also participated in the historic conference of North America’s Orthodox bishops in the Antiochian Village at Ligonier, Pennsylvania, 1994.\n\nLigonier Episcopal Assembly participants\n\nAnnual March for Life in Washington, DC\n\nMetropolitan Herman has been a well-known proponent of the sanctity of life. For many years, he participated in the March for Life held in Washington D.C. every January. He led the Orthodox Christian participants in the event, and in defence of the unborn, he addressed thousands of attendees.\n\nAddressing a \"March for Life\" gathering\n\n1995, Guzey Icon Museum and Repository\n\nIn 1995, a museum and repository was constructed through the gift of Mr. John Guzey and his wife Lucille to Saint Tikhon's Seminary.

In the course of his very active visit, the patriarch and his entourage were received at Saint Tikhon's Monastery by Archbishop Herman (Swaiko), who also took the patriarch into his home (in the diocesan centre) during the visit. The entourage of Patriarch Ilia II included Metropolitan Calistratos (Margalitashvili) of Kutaisi and Gaenati and Archbishop Daniel (Datushvili) of Tskum-Abkhaseti.\n\nOn 23 May, 1998, Archbishop Herman welcomed Patriarch Ilia II and his entourage to Saint Tikhon's Monastery. During that day, Patriarch Ilia II presided with Metropolitan Theodosius at the Commencement exercises of Saint Tikhon's Theological Seminary, at which time he was given an Honourary Doctor of Divinity degree. Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor) had invited the patriarch also to participate in a special session of the Holy Synod of Bishops of the OCA which had been convened at that time (and which was being given hospitality by Archbishop Herman and the Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania).\n\nConferral of the honourary doctorate\n\nOn 24 May, Patriarch Ilia II and Metropolitan Theodosius presided at a Primatial Divine Liturgy at the monastery, which was concelebrated by the bishops of the patriarchal entourage and the bishops of The Orthodox Church in America.\n\nPatriarch Ilia II at the Great Entrance\n\nOn 25 May, Patriarch Ilia II presided with Metropolitan Theodosius at the annual Memorial Day Pilgrimage of Saint Tikhon's Monastery, and again the bishops of the patriarchal entourage, the bishops of the Holy Synod of the OCA, and many priests and deacons concelebrated.\n\n1998 Pastoral Life Ministries Conference\n\nOn 9-11 June, 1998, the first Pastoral Life Ministries Conference was held at Saint Tikhon's Monastery, and hosted by Archbishop Herman. More than 180 bishops, priests and deacons from all parts of North America gathered for 3 days of reflection and discussion. They considered the evangelical work of the Church, various ways in which to nurture the Faithful, and ways in which to embrace those seeking Christ and entry into the Church. The convening of this assembly was in the context of the declaration of the Holy Synod that this year would focus on Church growth and missionary outreach. Metropolitan Theodosius gave the opening address.\n\nPastoral Ministries Conference participants\n\nAnnual Women's Retreat, 1998\n\nOn Saturday, 8 August, 1998, the fourth annual Women's Retreat (sponsored by the Department of Religious Education) was convened at Saint Tikhon's Monastery. Archbishop Herman hosted the gathering of more than 130 women, and he gave an address amongst the various presentations. All the conversations were focussed on the theme \"A Spiritual Approach to Women's Needs\".\n\nActing treasurer of the OCA, 1999-2000\n\nOn 29 September, 1999, Archbishop Herman was assigned to serve as the Acting Treasurer of The Orthodox Church in America. He followed after Protodeacon Eric Wheeler, and he fulfilled this responsibility until the end of 2000 when another treasurer was appointed.\n\nBy the time he was given this responsibility, there had already been concerns expressed and investigations initiated with regard to inadequate book-keeping and alleged missing or misused funds in The Orthodox Church in America administration. This was also occurring during the time when the Internal Revenue Service of the USA (IRS) was strengthening its regulations regarding the reporting of financial activities by not-for-profit and charitable organisations.\n\nBereavement, 2001\n\nIn 2001, Mary Kokoruda (born Swaiko), a sister to Archbishop Herman, fell asleep in the Lord in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.\n\nMary was predeceased by her husband Albert ; by her parents ; by her brothers Michael, Alex and John ; she was survived by her sisters Helen and Irene ; and by her brothers, Archbishop Herman, Charles, George, and Richard.\n\nOther responsibilities\n\nFrom May to September, 2001, Archbishop Herman served as the temporary administrator of the OCA, while Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor) was on a medical leave of absence. He had had a major surgery, and he had begun to suffer from small strokes.\n\nBesides this, Metropolitan Herman supervised the process that culminated in the full academic accreditation of Saint Tikhon's Seminary by the Association of Theological Schools in 2004.\n\nDuring his many decades of service in the Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania, not only had Archbishop Herman (Swaiko) very actively cared for the welfare of the parishioners and parishes of the Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania, but he had also paid close attention to the continuing development of Saint Tikhon's Monastery and Saint Tikhon's Seminary. He was acutely aware of the prominent place that both had in the general life of The Orthodox Church in America.\n\nIn addition to his service to the Diocese of Philadelphia and Eastern Pennsylvania, Archbishop Herman served The Orthodox Church in America in a wide variety of capacities (always having received the responsibility as an obedience, not as something sought and achieved). He served as chairman of the OCA Department of Finance ; vice-chairman of the Department of Missions ; member of the Board of Theological Education ; vice-chairman of the Preconciliar Commission ; episcopal moderator for the Department of Stewardship ; chairman of the Pension Board ; vice-chairman of the Office of Inter-Church Relations and Ecumenical Witness ; member of the Lesser Synod of Bishops (later called Standing Synod of Bishops).\n\nRetirement of Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor), 2002\n\nThen, on 2 April, 2002, Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor) submitted a petition to the Holy Synod of Bishops of the OCA, in which he requested the blessing to retire because of his worsening health. The Holy Synod granted his request, effective in July, 2002. The Holy Synod announced that the election for his successor would be held on 22 July, 2002, at the OCA's Thirteenth All-American Council in Orlando, Florida.\n\nElection and enthronement as Metropolitan, 2002\n\nAfter the assembly had followed the usual and established procedure for the election, the Holy Synod of Bishops announced that Archbishop Herman (Swaiko) had been chosen to become the next Archbishop of Washington and Metropolitan of The Orthodox Church in America.\n\nHe was immediately elevated to the dignity of metropolitan.\n\nOn Friday, 6 September, 2002, Metropolitan Herman met with the diocesan clergy and the staff of Saint Nicholas Cathedral in Washington, D.C.\n\nOn 8 September, 2002 (the Feast of the Nativity of the Theotokos), Archbishop Herman was enthroned by the Holy Synod of Bishops of The Orthodox Church in America during the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy in the Saint Nicholas Cathedral in Washington, D.C. In all, there were 25 bishops, more than 40 priests and deacons and a large number of Orthodox Christian Faithful from across the continent (including guests from abroad) who participated in the service. There were also several prominent secular persons present, as well as members of the family of Metropolitan Herman. As was reported in \"The Orthodox Church\" periodical :\n\nMembers of the OCA Holy Synod of Bishops led Metropolitan Herman to the High Place, or bishop’s throne, directly behind the altar table. His Grace, Bishop Seraphim of Ottawa and Canada, Secretary of the Holy Synod of Bishops, read the Act of Election, after which prayers for the newly-enthroned Metropolitan were offered. Finally, Metropolitan Herman was enthroned ‘in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,’ with the hierarchs, clergy and faithful exclaiming ‘Axios !’ — ‘He is worthy !’ — three times.\n\nDuring the course of these events, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) held meetings with the various guests and dignitaries.\n\nSaint Nicholas Cathedral, Washington, D.C.\n\nPrimatial service\n\nFollowing Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor), Metropolitan Herman was the second American-born metropolitan of The Orthodox Church in America.\n\nFraternal introductory visits to heads of autocephalous Churches ; visits within North America\n\nBefore long, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) followed the example of his predecessor (following the generally established custom), and he began a series of formal, fraternal visits to the heads of other Autocephalous Orthodox Churches, as is usual for every new leader of an autocephalous Church. In the manner of all such fraternal visits amongst the patriarchs, the primate of the Church does not travel unaccompanied. Later, the Holy Synod of the OCA and its administration made more specific provisions to clarify the nature and composition of an entourage of the metropolitans of the OCA.\n\nThe purpose of the visits was not simply to introduce himself to the other leaders. (As an archbishop, Metropolitan Herman had already encountered many of the other leaders during various visits he had made during the course of his responsibilities in the previous years of his archpastoral service.) Rather, the main purpose was to improve the understanding of such leaders about The Orthodox Church in America (OCA), and as much as possible to increase harmonious fraternal contacts on many levels between the OCA and her elder sister Churches. As is the normal custom throughout Orthodox Christian society, it is the responsibility of the younger to approach the elder, not the reverse. It is also to be kept in mind that not all the Orthodox Churches accepted the granting of autocephaly by the Russian Orthodox Church. Behind this is the interpretation that only the Church of Constantinople can give autocephaly.\n\nA man given energy in generous quantities by God, Vladyka Herman undertook these visits in the midst of his many other domestic responsibilities in North America. For the most part, by stretching his personal physical resources, he managed to keep a balance of service both locally and internationally.\n\nWhen Vladyka Metropolitan Herman would go abroad, as mentioned before, the custom was that the first priority was the eucharistic concelebrations with the other heads of Churches he was visiting, and also with the other bishops of these Churches. These events express and strengthen the unity of the Orthodox Christian Church. In every case, the host Churches provided an experience of that Church through visits and eucharistic celebrations in several or many places on the territory of that Church. In the course of Metropolitan Herman's visits it was also intended to help strengthen the positive perception of that Church by the local civil authorities. The Faithful of each Church would be able better to understand the multi-ethnic character of the Orthodox Christian Church (not only throughout the world, but particularly in North America). All would be able to perceive the fruit of missionary efforts made by the Church from the beginning. Besides this, there would be visits to some local civil authorities, and also to the political representatives of the USA (and sometimes of Canada) in those regions.\n\nPrimarily, however, Metropolitan Herman was regularly present in the central offices of the OCA at Syosset, New York, and he was engaged in a round of archpastoral visitations in the Diocese of Washington (normal life for any bishop). There were also visitations to various diocesan assemblies in North America, and he attended assorted other regular meetings that required his presence (such as meetings of the Episcopal Assembly, and meetings at the seminaries).\n\nArchpastoral visit to the Mexican Exarchate, January, 2003\n\nAfter his election as Primate of the Orthodox Church in America, Metropolitan Herman visited the Mexican Exarchate in mid-January, 2003. During this visit, he was accompanied by Archbishop Dmitri (Royster) of Dallas and the South, the Exarch of Mexico.\n\nMetropolitan Herman celebrated Great Vespers and the Divine Liturgy in Mexico City’s Cathedral of the Ascension (which is quite near to the international aeroport). He served the Divine Liturgy together with Archbishop Dmitri (Royster) and the Antiochian Metropolitan Antonio (Chedraoui) of Mexico.\n\nMetropolitan Herman serving together with Archbishop Dmitri and Antiochian Metropolitan Antonio\n\nDuring the time of his visit, Metropolitan Herman also met with many of the clergy who were serving the Exarchate of Mexico, and he offered them encouragement and guidance in their missionary efforts.\n\nHoly Ascension Cathedral, Mexico City\n\nWhile he was in Mexico, Metropolitan Herman visited Metropolitan Antonio (Chedraoui) of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of Mexico. He also met with Dr. Javier Moctezuma Barragán, Cabinet Officer of the Mexican Government, and Dr. Alvaro Castro Estrada, General Director of Religious Associations, with whom he discussed religious life in Mexico in general, and future prospects for Orthodox Christianity in the country.\n\nVladyka Herman encouraged the clergy and lay-persons he encountered to continue to strengthen their missionary efforts in other parts of the United States of Mexico.\n\nBereavement, 2003\n\nOn Sunday, 13 April, 2003, Richard Swaiko fell asleep in the Lord (at age 72) at University of Pittsburgh Medical Care Hospital, Passavant, McCandless Township, Pennsylvania. He had lived all his life in Bairdford, West Deer Township.\n\nOn Tuesday, 15 April, 2003, from 2:00-4:00 p.m. and 7:00-9:00 p.m., there was visitation at Siwicki-Yanicko Funeral Home, Russellton, West Deer Township, with a parastas (memorial service) offered in the evening.\n\nOn Wednesday, 16 April, 2003, at 9:30 a.m., there was a panikhida (memorial service) offered at the funeral home, after which the body of Richard Swaiko was taken to Saint Michael's Russian Orthodox Church in Curtisville, Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Wednesday, 16 April, 2003, at 10:00 a.m., Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) and Archpriest Alexander Poshyvajlo served the Memorial Divine Liturgy, followed by the Funeral Service for the Burial of a Lay-person.\n\nFollowing the funeral services, the body of Richard Swaiko was interred at Lakewood Memorial Gardens, Dorseyville, Indiana Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nRichard Swaiko was predeceased by his parents ; by his wife Doris Marshalek Swaiko ; and by his brothers Michael, Alex, and John ; and by his sister Mary ; he was survived by his brothers Metropolitan Herman, Charles and George ; and by his sisters Helen and Irene.\n\nFraternal visit to the Church of Russia, June, 2003\n\nOn 1 June, 2003, at the invitation of Patriarch Aleksey II (Ridiger) of Moscow and All Russia, Metropolitan Herman began his first official visit to the Russian Orthodox Church. He was accompanied by a small entourage of personnel from the Central Administration of the OCA. After having been met formally by Metropolitan Kirill (Gundyaev), the Chairman of the Department of External Church Relations of the patriarchate, and having rested, Metropolitan Herman was escorted to the Holy Lavra of the Holy Trinity-Saint Sergius in Sergeyev Posad (north of Moscow). After venerating the holy relics of Saints Sergius of Radonezh, Innocent of Moscow and others, he also visited the Moscow Theological Seminary and Academy within the Lavra walls.\n\nOn 2 June, 2003, Metropolitan Herman served the Primatial Divine Liturgy with other hierarchs and clergy in the OCA's Representation Church of the Great Martyr Catherine in Moscow on the Feast of the Leavetaking of Holy Pascha. Archimandrite Zacchaeus (Wood) was at that time the OCA Representative to the Moscow Patriarchate. Protopresbyter Daniel Hubiak had been the first such representative beginning in 1993.\n\nLater the same evening, Metropolitan Herman concelebrated the All-Night Vigil for the Great Feast of the Ascension at the Patriarchal Cathedral of the Theophany in “Yelokhov”, Moscow.\n\nOn the Great Feast of the Ascension, Metropolitan Herman celebrated the Divine Liturgy in the recently-rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Vladyka Herman was one of the few Orthodox primates ever to do so without Patriarch Aleksey being present. It had been intended that they serve together, but Patriarch Aleksey II was unwell at that time, and he gave the blessing that Vladyka Herman serve alone. Later that evening, Metropolitan Herman met privately with Patriarch Aleksey at his residence.\n\nMetropolitan Herman serving with Metropolitan Kirill (Gundyaev) and Archbishop Arseny (Epiphanov)\n\nOn the next day, Metropolitan Herman met with the US Ambassador to the Russian Federation, Alexander Vershbow, after which he was escorted to the aeroport to prepare for his departure to the USA.\n\nFraternal visit to the Church of Constantinople, July, 2003\n\nOn Thursday, 3 July, 2003, Metropolitan Herman (accompanied by Protopresbyter Robert Kondratick, Chancellor of the OCA and Archpriest Leonid Kishkovsky, Director of the Office of External Affairs and Interchurch Relations of the OCA) began a one-week Fraternal Visit to the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and to Patriarch Bartholomew I (Archontonis) in Istanbul, Turkey. The nature of this visit to the Patriarchate of Constantinople (the second visit of an OCA Primate to Patriarch Bartholomew, after that of Metropolitan Theodosius (Lazor)), was very significant in its content and structure.\n\nIn addition to the conversations with Patriarch Bartholomew, Metropolitan Herman visited various historical sites, the US Ambassador and other ecclesiastical leaders (the Latin Apostolic Vicar of Istanbul ; the Chief Rabbi of Turkey ; the Mufti of Istanbul ; the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople ; several persons from Russia and elsewhere who were visiting the patriarchate also at this time). These visits were, as usual, prepared in advance under the blessing of the host, Patriarch Bartholomew. After having been warmly greeted by Patriarch Bartholomew at the headquarters of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in the Phanar district of Istanbul, the patriarch and Metropolitan Herman met for a time in the private office of Patriarch Bartholomew.\n\nVisit of Metropolitan Herman with Patriarch Bartholomew\n\nAfter this meeting, the other companions joined the patriarch and the metropolitan, as well as Grand Archimandrite Athenagoras (Chrysanis) (nephew of Bishop Christophoros (Rakintzakis) in Canada), and they discussed topics related to current matters in world Orthodoxy. As always happens on such occasions, there was an exchange of gifts. The meeting was concluded with a formal luncheon which also included members of the Great and Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul).\n\nVisits to important sites and to significant persons in and near the city\n\nLater, Metropolitan Herman and his companions were taken to visit Istanbul’s Roman Catholic Basilica of the Holy Spirit and also the Latin Apostolic Vicar of Istanbul, Bishop Louis Pelâtre. They then visited the ancient Church of Hagia Sophia, and the Church of Saint Irene (site of the Second Ecumenical Council in 381 AD), and the 11th century Church of Our Saviour in Chora (none of these was a functioning Temple, nor had been since the Fall of Constantinople in 1453).\n\nThe following morning, Metropolitan Herman and his entourage, accompanied by Deacon Neophytos, travelled across the Sea of Marmara to Nicaea (site of the First and Seventh Ecumenical Councils). There, they were taken to the Nicaean Church of Hagia Sophia (site of the Seventh Ecumenical Council in 787 AD). They also visited the ancient Roman theatre (where more than 3,000 Christian women and children were martyred with bows and arrows), and the site of the Senatus Palace, Emperor Constantine’s Palace (where the First Ecumenical Council was held). After returning to Istanbul, Metropolitan Herman and those with him met with the USA Ambassador to Turkey (W Robert Pearson, who was ending his term). He met the entourage at the residence of the US Consul General. After a tour of the complex, Metropolitan Herman was informed about aspects of religious and secular life in Turkey.\n\nOn Sunday, 6 July, Metropolitan Herman, with the OCA representatives and others, departed by boat for Halki Island, one of the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmora (site of Holy Trinity Monastery, and of the Halki Theological School which has been forcibly closed since the 1970s). This trip takes about 2 hours. Metropolitan Apostolos (Dandiilidis) of Moshonissia welcomed Metropolitan Herman and those with him to the monastery and seminary. After attending the Divine Liturgy and receiving Holy Communion in the monastery and school's Holy Trinity Temple, Metropolitan Herman and the entourage were given a substantial repast, and after various talks, they returned to Istanbul.\n\nHoly Trinity Temple at the Halki Monastery and Theological School\n\nOn Monday, 7 July, Patriarch Bartholomew and Metropolitan Herman attended Matins and the Divine Liturgy at the Temple of Saint Kyriaki for that Temple's Altar Feast-day. It is the major shrine of Saint Kyriaki. Metropolitan Onufry (Berezovskiy) of Chernivtsi, Ukraine, who was also visiting the patriarchate, was present with them. Following the services, a Trisagion (Memorial Service) was celebrated at the tomb of the late Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras (Spyrou) at the Panagia Monastery of Baloukli (often pronounced \"Valuki\"), on the anniversary of his repose.\n\nLater the same day, Metropolitan Herman, accompanied by Patrick Hannish of the US Consulate, met with Turkey’s Chief Rabbi, Rav Isak Haleva, as well as Bensiyon Pinto and Lina Filiba, President and Vice-President respectively of the country’s Jewish community. They spoke about the life of Turkey’s minority faith communities.\n\nIn the evening, a formal dinner was hosted by Patriarch Bartholomew at his private residence. Besides Metropolitan Herman and the OCA representatives, the guests included Metropolitan Emmanuel (Adamakis) of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of France ; Metropolitan Onufry of Chernivtsi ; Khalifa Bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Undersecretary for Islamic Affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain ; and Dr. Mohammad Taher Al-Qattan, Assistant Secretary General for the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. Amongst the varied topics discussed during dinner was Patriarch Bartholomew’s recent visit to Bahrain, which marked the first time an Ecumenical Patriarch had visited the kingdom.\n\nExcursion to Ephesus\n\nOn Tuesday, 8 July, Mr. Georges Benlisoy, Secretary for the Patriarchal Library, led Metropolitan Herman and his companions on a visit to Ephesus, near Izmir, Turkey. Ephesus was the site of the Third Ecumenical Council. Metropolitan Herman and those with him visited a Roman Catholic shrine at a place the Roman Catholic Church associates with the site of the Virgin Mary’s home and of her Dormition. They also visited the Church of Saint John the Theologian, the ancient city ruins, the theatre in which Saint Paul attempted to preach, and the Temple of the Virgin Mary.\n\nLife-giving Spring Monastery ; tombs of patriarchs\n\nAfter their return to Istanbul, Patriarch Bartholomew hosted Metropolitan Herman and his entourage at the Panagia Women’s Monastery of Baloukli. Patriarch Bartholomew personally conducted a tour of the monastery, pointing out the tombs of the Ecumenical Patriarchs and the Life-giving Spring located in the monastery’s lower level.\n\nLife-giving Spring at the Panagia Women’s Monastery of Baloukli\n\nOther guests who attended the dinner at the monastery included Metropolitan Kirill (Gundyaev) of Smolensk, Russia, Chairman of the Department of External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate, who was visiting Istanbul with Archpriest Nicholas Balashov ; Metropolitan Emmanuel (Adamakis) of France ; and Khalifa Bin Hamad Al Khalifa of Bahrain.\n\nOn 9 July, there was a private meeting of Patriarch Bartholomew with Metropolitan Herman, Father Robert Kondratick (Chancellor of the OCA) and Father Leonid Kishkovsky. Afterwards, Metropolitan Herman met with the Chief Mufti of Istanbul, Bayram Erdogan, at which time they discussed various aspects of Turkey’s religious, social, and political life. Later the same day, Metropolitan Herman and those with him were received by Patriarch Mesrob II, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople. At the end of the day, Metropolitan Herman and his entourage hosted a dinner in honour of Patriarch Bartholomew, during which there were concluding speeches expressing fraternal love and gratitude.\n\nAn explanatory statement at that time about such visits describes the main purpose for these visits in general :\n\nMetropolitan Herman’s visit to Orthodox Christianity’s ancient Primatial See confirms the ties which already exist between the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Orthodox Church in America and holds great promise for ongoing contact, mutual co-operation, and a renewed and strengthened bond of love and unity.\n\nThis published statement was demonstrated in the nature of this particular visit.\n\nMetropolitan Herman at the 100th anniversary of the glorification of Saint Seraphim of Sarov\n\nAt the invitation of Patriarch Aleksey II (Ridiger) of Moscow and All Russia, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) travelled to Russia with a small entourage from the Central Administration of the OCA for a brief visit on 29 July-1 August, 2003. The purpose of this visit was to take part with many other hierarchs, clergy and faithful in the services that marked the centennial of the glorification of Saint Seraphim of Sarov (in Sarov, 16-22 July, 1903). The participants included not only the hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church, but also Patriarch Pavle II (Stojčević) of Serbia, and many hierarchs of all the other autocephalous Orthodox Churches.\n\nAfter his arrival on 28 July, Metropolitan Herman travelled together with Patriarch Aleksey to Sarov on 29 July. At the Women's Monastery of Saint Seraphim in Diveyevo near Sarov, they served in the Vigil, Primatial Divine Liturgy, and other services and processions which marked this anniversary, together with the many other hierarchs. The President of Russia, Mr. V V Putin was also present.\n\nCentennial services at Holy Trinity Sobor, Diveyevo\n\nAfter the completion of the celebrations, Metropolitan Herman and his entourage returned to Moscow on Saturday, 2 August, from where they flew directly to Kyiv in Ukraine.\n\nReliquary of Saint Seraphim at Diveyevo\n\nFraternal Visit to the Autonomous Church of Ukraine, 3-13 August, 2003\n\nOn Saturday, 2 August, 2003, Metropolitan Volodymyr (Sabodan) of Kyiv and All Ukraine met and welcomed Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) upon his arrival at the Borispil Aeroport, in order to begin his fraternal visit to the Autonomous Church of Ukraine (Moscow Patriarchate). Metropolitan Herman was immediately interviewed by various reporters. Metropolitan Herman stressed the importance of such a visit for strengthening the spiritual bonds between the Church in Ukraine and the Church in North America.\n\nIn the evening, the Vigil service for the Resurrection was served in the Kyiv Caves Monastery.\n\nOn Sunday morning, 3 August, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) served the Primatial Divine Liturgy together with Metropolitan Volodymyr (Sabodan) and many other hierarchs and clergy in the Dormition Catholicon (main Temple) of the Kyiv Caves Monastery. This Temple had been destroyed during World War II, and only recently had been rebuilt and returned to service.\n\nDivine Liturgy in Saint Sophia Sobor, Kyiv Caves Lavra\n\nLater that day, Metropolitan Herman and the small entourage from The Orthodox Church in America were guided through portions of the Near Caves and the Far Caves. These were the original cells of the first monks, Saints Antoniy (Anthony) and Theodosiy (Theodosius) and others, who lived in caves delved out of the west bank of the Dnipro (Dnepr) River. They eventually became the underground catacomb burial chambers of the monks, and these catacombs include many small chapels as well. Many of those laid to rest in these catacombs are saints, and the bodies of many of these saints have remained incorrupt. During this time, Metropolitan Herman was apprised of the current situation of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine.\n\nPochaiv Lavra ; Diocese of Chernivtsi (Cernăuți)\n\nThe next day, Metropolitan Herman and those accompanying him were taken to visit the Dormition Pochaiv (Pochaev) Monastery near Kremenets in the Ternopol Oblast. En route, they visited the Korets Holy Trinity Women’s Monastery, one of the oldest monasteries in the Rivne Oblast. They also visited the Holy Theophany Monastery in Kremenets. Kremenets is the birthplace of Metropolitan Leonty (Turkevich), of Saint Alexander Hotovitzky and of some others who served in North America.\n\nThe entourage arrived at the Pochaiv Dormition Monastery in time for the Vigil of the Feast of the Appearance of the Icon of the Theotokos of Pochaiv.\n\nIn the morning of the Feast-day, Metropolitan Herman venerated the wonder-working icon of the Pochaiv Mother of God, the holy relics of Saint Job and Saint Amphilokhy, and the rock on which the footprint of the Mother of God is visible.\n\nReliquary of the incorrupt Holy Relics of Saint Job ; reliquary of the incorrupt Holy Relics of Saint Amphilokhy\n\nHe then presided at the festal Divine Liturgy in the Dormition Cathedral. There were about 20,000 pilgrims present for the feast-day. Many more than 150 clergy led the festal procession that followed the Divine Liturgy.\n\nPochaiv Lavra\n\nLater the same day, Metropolitan Herman and his companions left for Chernivtsi, where Metropolitan Onufry (Berezovsky) welcomed them at his residence beside the city’s Saint Nicholas Sobor. As always, Metropolitan Herman received an overview of the situation of the Orthodox Church in the region he visited. Then they visited the Holy Spirit Cathedral of the city, and again there was an interview with reporters.\n\nHoly Spirit Cathedral (left) ; Saint Nicholas Sobor (right)\n\nThe next day, Metropolitan Onufry, Metropolitan Herman and the entourage travelled to the Boian Village. In this village, in the Women's Monastery of the Nativity of the Theotokos, the bishops attended a Divine Liturgy served by the OCA clergy and many local clergy. The service was conducted in Slavonic, Ukrainian, Romanian and English.\n\nAfterwards, the entourage went to visit the Holy Ascension Monastery's orphanage in the village of Molnytsia. The next stop was the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian in the village of Khreschatik. The monastery and village are situated on the south (right) bank of the Dniester River.\n\nAfter this, Metropolitan Herman and those accompanying him returned to Kyiv, where Metropolitan Herman was again interviewed, and there were further visits and services within the Church of Ukraine. There were included in the visit meetings with USA and Canadian Ambassadors to Ukraine, the Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, and other religious and secular leaders in the country.\n\nFraternal Visit to the Church of Poland, September, 2003\n\nOn 4 September, 2003, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko), accompanied by an entourage of several clergy and staff members of the Central Administration, arrived in Warsaw, Poland, for an official fraternal visit to Metropolitan Sawa (Hrycuniak) and to the Church of Poland.\n\nThe official establishment of the Orthodox Church in Poland came about after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War. In 1992, the Government of Poland recognised the Orthodox Church on its territory (mostly in the eastern parts), and took it under its authority. It was at first led by an exarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Dionizy (Waledyński). Before and after this formative period, there were many people of this territory who emigrated to Canada and to the USA, and the bonds of family relationship remain between Orthodox believers of both countries and Poland.\n\nThe first service after arrival (a Moleben of Thanksgiving for safe arrival) was at the Cathedral of Saint Mary Magdalene in Warsaw.\n\nSaint Mary Magdalene Cathedral, Warsaw\n\nMetropolitan Herman used various opportunities during his visit to draw attention to the fact that many of the Faithful in the OCA trace their ancestry to Poland (or to territories that once were a part of Poland), and that numerous hierarchs and clergy, including Saint Tikhon (Belavin), Metropolitan Ireney (Bekish) and Archbishop Kiprian (Borisevich) and many priests had served the Polish Orthodox Church before emigrating to the USA and Canada. In addition to the Archdiocese of Warsaw, the Church consists of dioceses in Bialystok, Lublin, Lodz, Wroclaw, and Przymysl. The Church also maintains a graduate theological faculty and undergraduate seminary in Warsaw (The Warsaw Orthodox Theological Seminary), several monasteries (including the 600-year-old Monastery of the Annunciation in Supraśl, and the Monastery of Saints Martha and Mary on the Holy Mountain of Grabarka), a Diocese in Brazil, and a very active national youth fellowship.\n\nMetropolitans Herman and Sawa visited Jozef Cardinal Glemp at his Warsaw residence, where they discussed the relationship between Poland’s Orthodox Christian and Roman Catholic communities. Later the same day, they were received by Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski at his residence in central Warsaw. The president showed interest in the current situation of Orthodoxy in North America. The hierarchs also were received by Mr. Ralph J Lysyshyn, Canadian Ambassador to Poland, at the Canadian Embassy. Ambassador Lysyshyn explained various co-operative efforts aimed at bolstering the development of Poland’s private sector.\n\nVisits to the dioceses, significant sites\n\nThe hierarchs celebrated the Feast of the Hieromartyr Maxim Sandowicz, in Holy Trinity Church, Gorlice, in the Lemko region. Saint Maxim had served as a priest in North America. They served with Archbishop Adam (Dubec) of Przymysl, bishop of that region, and Archbishop Abel (Poplawsky) of Chelm and Lublin.\n\nHoly Trinity Church, Gorlice\n\nOn Sunday morning, the metropolitans, together with Archbishop Abel (Poplawsky) and Bishops Miron (Chodakowski) of Hajnówka, and Grzegorz (Charkiewicz) of Bielsk-Podlaski, auxiliaries to the Warsaw Archdiocese, concelebrated the Primatial Divine Liturgy in Warsaw’s Cathedral of Saint Mary Magdalene. In the evening, Metropolitans Sawa and Herman visited the Temple of Saint John of the Ladder in Warsaw’s Wola district. It is situated at the entrance to the city’s major Orthodox cemetery. The Temple is surrounded by the graves of Poland’s deceased Orthodox primates and other historic persons. There, the 2 Metropolitans celebrated a panikhida (memorial service) for the deceased primates of the American and Polish Orthodox Churches.\n\nThe first anniversary of Metropolitan Herman’s enthronement was celebrated on Monday, 8 September (the Feast of the Nativity of the Theotokos) at Holy Transfiguration Cathedral, Lublin, Poland. Metropolitans Sawa and Herman concelebrated the Primatial Divine Liturgy along with Archbishop Abel (Poplawsky) of Lublin, and Archbishop Simeon (Shostatsky) of Vladimir-Volynsk, Ukraine.\n\nMetropolitans Sawa and Herman, accompanied by the American entourage, visited the World War II era Majdanek Death Camp not far from the city-centre of Lublin (where nearly 400,000 persons, including many Orthodox clergy and faithful, perished). Later the same evening, the hierarchs of the American group attended a Moleben of Thanksgiving Service at Saint John the Theologian Church in Chełm (Kholm). It was in this Temple that Archbishop Kiprian (Borisevich) of Philadelphia and Eastern Pennsylvania had been baptised. Both Metropolitan Leonty (Turkevich) and Metropolitan Ireney (Bekish) (predecessors of Metropolitan Herman) had spent some time in this city in the past.\n\nSaint John the Theologian Church, Chełm (view from the east) ; Metropolitans Sawa and Herman at a panikhida for Metropolitans Leonty and Ireney, and Archbishop Kiprian\n\nThe next day, the hierarchs arrived at the Women’s Monastery of Saints Martha and Mary near Siemiaticze, Poland. It is on the Holy Mountain Grabarka. The hierarchs visited the nuns and prayed with them there.\n\nThen they travelled to the Monastery of the Annunciation in Supraśl, where they inspected the reconstruction of the main Temple of the monastery.\n\nFrom there, they travelled to Białystok. They visited 2 of the 12 Orthodox Christian Temples in the city : Hagia Sophia, and Holy Spirit. Then they arrived at Saint Nicholas' Cathedral. In every place, they prayed.\n\nOn the final day, the primates concelebrated the Divine Liturgy marking the Feast-day of Saint Job of Pochaiv at Archangel Michael Cathedral, Bielsk-Podlaski, Poland.\n\nSaint Nicholas Cathedral, Białystok\n\nAfter this final service together, everyone returned to Warsaw, and Metropolitan Herman and his companions returned to New York.\n\nAfter the completion of this visit, the Holy Synod of Bishops discussed the matter of the composition of groups which accompany a metropolitan on formal visits. It was decided that such visits are of sufficient gravity that, as do other Autocephalous Churches, The Orthodox Church in America ought to include at least one other bishop in the entourage of the metropolitan when he makes such formal visits.\n\nFraternal Visit to the Church of Georgia, April, 2004\n\nOn 16-23 April, 2004, Metropolitan Herman travelled to Tbilisi, Georgia, for an official visit to which he had been invited by Patriarch Ilia II (Ghudushauri-Shiolashvili) and the Church of Georgia. Vladyka Metropolitan Herman was accompanied by an entourage of several people (including one bishop, and several clergy and staff members from the Central Administration).\n\nThe Church of Georgia is one of the oldest Christian Churches. The Church of Georgia has its origins according to substantiated tradition in the missionary efforts of the Apostle Andrew in the first century. There is a tradition about the preaching by other apostles in Georgia, including Simon the Canaanite, Matthias, Bartholomew, and Thaddeus. The establishment of the first Georgian eparchy (diocese) was also credited to the Apostle Andrew.\n\nHistorically, the formal adoption of Christianity by the Kingdom of Georgia (Iberia) is accepted to be the result of the missionary efforts of Saint Nino of Cappadocia (cousin of the Great Martyr George) beginning in early fourth century. In every place that Saint Nino raised the Holy Cross, a monastery was established, and these Temples exist to this day. Initially, the Georgian Church was part of the territory of the Patriarchate of Antioch. The Church was granted autocephaly by the Patriarch of Antioch in 466. Although the Church of Georgia was seriously disrupted by the invasions of the Persians and by various Tatar tribes in the 13th and 15th centuries, the autocephalous Church survived until it was placed under the administration of the synodal Church of Russia in 1811. After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II (following the February Revolution of 1917), the Georgian hierarchs restored the autocephaly, which was eventually recognised by both the Church of Constantinople and the Church of Russia.\n\nOn Saturday, 17 April (Bright Saturday), the metropolitan and his entourage arrived in Tbilisi, and the visitors were met by Patriarch Ilia II, and also by Archbishops Gerasim and Theodore. Vladyka Gerasim (Sharashenidze) was the chief of the Foreign Affairs department of the patriarchate. After being taken to their quarters, they then visited the patriarchal headquarters, and then they were taken to visit the new Holy Trinity Cathedral, which was at that time under construction in Tbilisi. New administrative headquarters were included in the plans. After this, Metropolitan Herman was introduced to President Mikhail Saakashvili, and his wife. Then all the entourage went to the Vigil of Thomas Sunday in Sioni Cathedral. During the Vigil, it was possible to venerate the Precious Head of the Holy Apostle Thomas, and the hand-made Cross made by Saint Nino.\n\nHoly Trinity Cathedral, presidential palace below\n\nSioni Cathedral\n\nOn Sunday, 18 April, Patriarch Ilia II, Metropolitan Herman and their companions travelled to the Mtskheta Cathedral for the Divine Liturgy of Thomas Sunday. This cathedral is also called “Svetitskhoveli”, which means “Living Pillar”. This term refers to the fact that here is the traditional place where the Robe of Christ (John 19:23) from the Crucifixion is entombed. This tomb dates from shortly after the Crucifixion of Christ. It is also known as the Cathedral of the Holy Apostles in Mtskheta (the ancient capital of Georgia). The Georgian bishops who served together with Patriarch Ilia II and the OCA bishops numbered 12. All venerated the Living Pillar and a 4th century Cross.\n\nAfterwards, having returned to Tbilisi, Metropolitan Herman and his companions, together with Patriarch Ilia II and his entourage attended a private concert of classical and Georgian music by the “Synthesis” trio ; and there was a viewing of paintings by the famous 20th century Georgian artist, Elene Akhvlediani.\n\nMtskheta Cathedral\n\nOn Monday, 19 April, the OCA representatives participated in an Academic Proceeding (convocation) at the Tbilisi State University (most of whose students are Orthodox Christians). After this, they were taken to visit 3 monastic communities (Djvari Holy Cross Monastery, Samtavro (which remained open throughout the Soviet period), and Shio-Mgvime) with ancient roots, and which had been recently been revived, in and near Mtskheta. Because of his great labours, Patriarch Ilia II has been favourably compared with Saint King David IV \"the Builder\".\n\nThere was another occasion that day : a reception by the USA Ambassador to Georgia (Richard Miles) at an embassy reception.\n\nOn Tuesday, 20 April, Metropolitan Herman delivered the keynote address at the Spring, 2004, Missionary Seminar hosted by the Georgian Patriarchate. Afterwards, Patriarch Ilia II led his guests on a general tour of the monasteries in East Georgia. This region, south of the Caucaus Mountains, lies on a mixture of hills and fertile plains (a major wine-growing region).\n\nThey visited the Bodbe women’s Monastery near Signagi, Kakaheti, in Eastern Georgia, where they venerated the tomb of Saint Nino. The monastery sits on a high bluff. Founded by Saint Nino, and the site of her well-protected tomb, the monastery was destroyed several times, but it was always rebuilt, and it again thrives.\n\nAfter this, they visited the Gremi Monastery near the Caucaus Mountains ; the Cathedral of the Transfiguration in Telavi, the Shavnabana Saint George Monastery Cathedral of Saint George in Alaverdi, Nearby is the Shuamta Monastery the Nativity of the Theotokos.\n\nPatriarch Ilia II and Metropolitan Herman surrounded by requests for blessing\n\nLighting a candle at the tomb of Saint Nino\n\nBodbe Women's Monastery\n\nOn Thursday, 22 April, Patriarch Ilia and his guests travelled south to the ancient Caves Monastery of Saint John the Forerunner, and to the nearby monastery caves complex of the Lavra of Saint David Gareji.\n\nMonastery of Saint John the Forerunner\n\nIn the afternoon, all returned to Tbilisi for a series of meetings : the Prime Minister of Georgia (Zurab Zhvania), to the Foreign Minister of Georgia (Tedo Japaridze), and with the Speaker of Parliament (Nino Burjanidze).\n\nThe visit included some cultural events which allowed Metropolitan Herman and his companions to experience many facets of Georgian life. At the conclusion of the programme, there was a visit to the regional offices of International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) in Tbilisi, This was followed by a visit to the Georgian State Museum of Art.\n\nPatriarch Ilia celebrated his 45th anniversary of ordination to the Holy Priesthood during this visit. It was a main subject of various speeches at the concluding and farewell dinner.\n\nOn Saturday, 23 April, 2004, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) and his accompanying entourage made their departure for New York.\n\nReturn of the Wonder-working Tikhvin Icon of the Theotokos to Russia, 2004\n\nOn Wednesday, 23 June, 2004, Patriarch Aleksey II (Ridiger) of Moscow and All Russia and Metropolitan Herman, Primate of The Orthodox Church in America, received the Wonder-working Icon of the Theotokos of Tikhvin at the entrance to the immense Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, Russia. Metropolitan Herman was accompanied at this time by Archbishop Job (Osacky) of Chicago, and by Bishop Nikolai (Soraich) of Sitka and Anchorage.\n\nIn the USA, during the previous week, the holy icon had been taken from Chicago, Illinois, to several places for a last farewell. Then, Metropolitan Vladimir (Kotlyarov) arrived in the USA in order to escort the holy icon back to Russia (by a private plane sent from Russia). After many prayer-services had been served before this holy icon, Metropolitan Vladimir, accompanied by Bishop Seraphim (Storheim), Archpriest Alexander Garklavs and several others, flew to Riga, Latvia. There, in the Holy Nativity Cathedral, there were services (including a hierarchical Divine Liturgy), and the people of Latvia had time to venerate the Grace-filled icon. On Wednesday morning, the entourage accompanied the holy icon to Moscow, where she was given into the hands of the patriarch at the top of the steps of the cathedral entry. Patriarch Aleksey immediately lifted the holy icon high (aided by Metropolitan Herman) ; and after showing it to all, they made the Sign of the Cross with the holy icon, and they blessed the throngs of people standing outside. Immediately, the icon was taken into the cathedral for a prayer-service, and for veneration.\n\nTikhvin Icon of the Holy Theotokos\n\nThis holy and wonder-working Icon had been rescued from the Nazi German Army in Riga, Latvia, by Archbishop John (Garklavs) of Chicago when he was yet a new bishop. As he and his family escaped from the coming Soviet invasion, he carried the icon with him into Germany and then to North America. Since that time, this holy icon had been kept at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Chicago until the time would become opportune for her return. Now, upon her return to Russia, a Service of Thanksgiving was chanted in the cathedral. For the next 4 days, thousands of Faithful (by some estimates, 50,000 per day) approached the cathedral in an orderly line more than a kilometre (nearly a mile) long, and they patiently waited for several to many hours for an opportunity to venerate the icon.\n\nOn Sunday, 4 July, a procession was led by Metropolitan Herman, Metropolitan Vladimir (Kotlyarov) of Saint Petersburg and Ladoga, and Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The procession included 1,200 clergy and 250,000 people who escorted the icon. From Christ the Saviour Cathedral, the procession made its way down the city’s main thoroughfare beside the Moscow River by the walls of the Kremlin to the Cathedral of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God. There, seemingly endless lines of Faithful continued to offer prayers before the icon for 3 additional days.\n\nProcession from Christ the Saviour Cathedral to Red Square\n\nOn Thursday, 8 July, the eve of the icon’s feast-day, thousands of Faithful anticipated the icon’s arrival at the railway station in Tikhvin and joined the 3 km (2 mi) procession to the city’s Dormition Monastery. En route, the procession with the icon paused briefly in the city centre, where it was welcomed by city and regional officials. Metropolitans Herman and Vladimir, Archbishop Job, and numerous hierarchs and clergy of the Church of Russia and of the OCA celebrated the Akathist Hymn to the Theotokos upon the icon’s arrival at the monastery, after which hundreds of clergy joined Patriarch Aleksey and Metropolitan Herman for the celebration of the outdoor festal Vigil, held in front of the monastery’s cathedral (in order to accommodate the large crowds of the Faithful).\n\nTikhvin Dormition Men's Monastery\n\nOn Friday, 9 July, the festal Divine Liturgy was concelebrated at the monastery by Patriarch Aleksey, Metropolitan Herman, 15 other hierarchs and dozens of clergy. Tears of joy streamed down the faces of many as the Holy Tikhvin Icon was once again enshrined in her original “home”. Speaking on behalf of the Faithful of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Aleksey expressed deep gratitude for the icon’s return. He noted that without the concern and efforts of Metropolitan Herman and the Orthodox Church in America, this historic occasion would not have been possible.\n\nThe Shrine of the Tikhvin Icon of the Holy Theotokos at Tikhvin Monastery\n\nOn Saturday, 10 July, Metropolitan Herman, Archbishop Job, and members of the OCA entourage attended the Resurrectional Vigil for Sunday (on Saturday evening) in the Cathedral of Saint Isaac in Saint Petersburg.\n\nOn Sunday, 11 July, they concelebrated the Divine Liturgy with Metropolitan Vladimir in the Cathedral of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God (the official cathedral of the city), after which Metropolitan Vladimir once again thanked Metropolitan Herman for the return of the Tikhvin Icon. He presented a large hand-painted copy of the Tikhvin Icon to be placed at the chancery of the Orthodox Church in America.\n\nKazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg\n\nFraternal Visit to the Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, September, 2004\n\nOn 18-26 September, 2004, Metropolitan Herman led an entourage of several people (including 2 bishops and several clergy and staff members of the Central Administration, as well as a senior priest and a subdeacon from the Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania) for his official fraternal visit to Metropolitan Nikolai (Kocvár) and the Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia (as well as the civil authorities of the 2 countries of Czechia and Slovakia, once called Czechoslovakia).\n\nThis visit was particularly meaningful for Metropolitan Herman personally, since his own forebears had emigrated from near this region (in Trans-Carpathia in Western Ukraine, a little farther east) to the USA many decades earlier. Moreover, a very large number of the Faithful of The Orthodox Church in America have their family roots in one or another part of this same region. For Metropolitan Herman, part of this fraternal visit was, in a manner of speaking, a pilgrimage to the homeland of his ancestors.\n\nThe Czech Lands and Slovakia (including Trans-Carpathia) were evangelised by the Orthodox Christian Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.\n\nIn the 17th century, under Austro-Hungarian imperial pressure, the Union of Uzhorod was imposed on the Faithful, who were forced to become Eastern Catholics. The revival of the Orthodox Christian Faith began in the late 19th century. As the political circumstances changed, the Orthodox Diocese of Prague was established, and in 1923, the Patriarchate of Constantinople gave it autonomy. The Serbian Patriarchate established a diocese in Prešov. During World War II, the region received its first martyr in Bishop Gorazd (Pavlik), and many others were killed in the concentration camps of the Nazi German government. Under the control of the Soviet Union (USSR), the Orthodox Faithful of this region were attached to the Moscow Patriarchate, and many parishes and people returned to the Orthodox Christian Church. The Moscow Patriarchate gave the Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia autocephaly in 1951. After the “Prague Spring” of 1968, many parishes returned to the Unia, and the Orthodox Church there re-organised itself into 2 metropolitan provinces of Prague (Czechia) and Prešov (Slovakia). These provinces, whose parishioners were (for the most part) formerly native residents of these territories, experienced an immigration after 1990 from other nearby countries for the sake of finding employment. Hence people arrived from the former Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, and a quantity of “Roma” people, all of which noticeably increased the population of Orthodox Christians in both of the constituent provinces (countries) of this Church.\n\nVisit to Czechia (Czech Lands) and dioceses\n\nOn Saturday, 18 September, 2004, Metropolitan Herman and his entourage arrived in Prague, where Archbishop Krystof (Pulec) of Prague met them at the aeroport.\n\nStraightway, Metropolitan Herman and those who accompanied him were taken to visit the Monastery of Saint Prokop of Sázava in the City of Most (an increasingly active centre for local Orthodox Church-sponsored social and humanitarian efforts). They were also taken to the historic Holy Cross Church, Teplice (known for its classical baroque architecture and decoration). At Holy Cross Church, Metropolitan Herman and his companions were welcomed by the rector, Archpriest Eugene Freimann, the Mayor of Teplice Vera Smudzova, and parishioners.\n\nArchbishop Krystof/Christopher (Pulec) of Prague\n\nOn Sunday, 19 September, Metropolitan Herman, Archbishop Krystof, and the OCA bishops and clergy concelebrated the Divine Liturgy at Prague’s historic Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral. In his remarks at the conclusion of the Liturgy, Metropolitan Herman praised the Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia in its valiant efforts to rebuild its spiritual and temporal life during the past decade. He presented Archbishop Krystof with relics of the American missionary, Saint Alexis Toth (a native of Slovakia’s Transcarpathian region), and with the Order of Saint Innocent, Silver Cross. He presented the Order of Saint Innocent, Bronze Cross, to Protopresbyter Jaroslav Suvarsky, cathedral dean, and his wife Eva. He also presented humanitarian aid on behalf of the OCA Faithful to the Church’s “Philanthropia” organisation.\n\nAfterwards, Metropolitan Herman and his companions visited the well known Memorial of the Terror of Heydrich, housed in the cathedral crypt. In the early 1940s, anti-Nazi paratroopers had been hidden in the crypt with the blessing of the Orthodox Bishop Gorazd (Pavlik), who was subsequently glorified by the Church in 1987. When the paratroopers were discovered and arrested, Saint Gorazd offered to exchange his life for those of his compatriots and the many Orthodox Christians arrested with them. Subsequently, he was imprisoned, tortured, subjected to a highly publicised show trial, and martyred.\n\nSaints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral, Prague\n\nLater the same day, Metropolitan Herman and the OCA entourage visited the nearby Holy Trinity Church, Rokycany, a recently-established Roma (“gypsy”) parish. They were welcomed by their Romani pastor, Priest David Dudaš. Defined as a “nation without borders” by the European Union in the 1990s, the Roma possess a unique culture and language, and they have been subjected to persecution and discrimination for centuries. During his visit there, Metropolitan Herman venerated a wonder-working, weeping Icon of the Saviour, the principal icon of the iconostas. The myrrh on the icon was visible at the time.\n\nHoly Trinity Church, Rokycany\n\nFrom Rokycany, Metropolitan Herman and the OCA entourage were taken to Mariánské Lázně, where they were welcomed at the Saint Vladimir parish by the rector, Archpriest Josef Hauzar, clergy from numerous deanery parishes, and the Faithful. They were also welcomed at the Moscow Patriarchate’s Representation Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad), a city widely known for its spas and sanitoria, where they were welcomed by the dean, Priest Gennady Budko. In Karlovy Vary, everyone had an opportunity to drink some of the healing water.\n\nSaints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Karlovy Vary\n\nOn Monday, 20 September, Metropolitan Herman and his entourage first visited the Temple of Saint George the Great Martyr at the Russian Embassy in Prague, where they were welcomed by Priest Nicholas Lishenyk and Counsellor Anatoli V Agapov.\n\nNext, Ambassador Bruce Jutzi and Counsellor Olivier Nicoloff received Metropolitan Herman and the OCA entourage at the Canadian Embassy in Prague. During the visit, Metropolitan Herman spoke about the mission of the Orthodox Church in America and the Orthodox Church in the Czech Lands and Slovakia. He further discussed various far-reaching matters of concern, from poverty and substance abuse to the trafficking of persons. Areas of collaboration between the OCA and the Czech-Slovak Church were also highlighted. Similar concerns were discussed during a visit to the USA Embassy in Prague, at which Metropolitan Herman and those accompanying him were received by Ambassador William J Cabaniss.\n\nThere was sufficient time for Metropolitan Herman and his companions to stop by the Old Town Hall of Prague and to see the famous astronomical clock there. Every hour for more than 300 years, every hour of the day, the figures of the 12 Apostles appear in 2 windows above the face of that clock.\n\nOld Town Hall Astronomical Clock, Prague\n\nIn the afternoon, Metropolitan Herman and the OCA entourage travelled to Vilemov, where they were received at the Dormition Monastery by Bishop Simeon (Jakovlevič) of Olomouc and Brno, Igumena Alexia, and Mr. Roman Juriga (director of Vilemov’s Orthodox Centre). During the previous decade, the Centre became an important venue for youth conferences, educational symposia, and gatherings focussing on a wide range of disciplines, from ecological concerns to iconography. On behalf of the OCA Faithful, Metropolitan Herman presented the monastic sisterhood with an abundance of humanitarian aid for use in their regional and international charitable ministries.\n\nBishop Simeon (Jakovlevič)\n\nBefore their departure, Metropolitan Herman and his companions met with the President of the Ecumenical Council of Churches of the Czech Republic, Bishop Vladislav Volny of the Silesian Evangelical Church, and the Chairman of the Conference of Catholic Bishops, Archbishop Jan Graubner of Olomouc.\n\nOn Tuesday, 21 September (the old calendar Great Feast of the Nativity of the Mother of God), Metropolitan Herman, Bishop Simeon (Jakovlevič), the 2 OCA bishops and clergy (with others) concelebrated the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy in the Cathedral of the Holy Martyr Vaclav (Wenceslas) in Brno. The cathedral was filled to capacity. Afterwards, Metropolitan Herman presented Bishop Simeon with the Order of Saint Innocent, Silver Class, and relics of Saint Alexis Toth. Following the Divine Liturgy, Metropolitan Herman and the OCA entourage met with Brno City Mayor Josef Kamenicek and visited the city hall, where they were received by Rostislav Slavotinek, Brno deputy mayor.\n\nSaint Vaclav (Wenceslas) Cathedral, Brno\n\nThen they drove out to visit the Mikulčice Valy National Cultural Monument, an archaeological site marking the capital of Saint Rostislav’s Greater Moravian Empire, and the centre of the Orthodox Christian mission of Saint Methodius. The site boasts the remains of numerous ancient Orthodox Christian Temples, the earliest ones in that region. It was in this place that, in the ninth century, Saint Methodius lived and worked in a town with 12 Temples, and a population of 2,500 people. Here, in the main Temple (the third excavated) was found the first tomb of Saint Methodius. The mission of Saint Methodius here was very effective in its day, but there was strong opposition from certain civil authorities and the Western Church. Because the pope later anathematised him, his relics were removed to a monastery in Austria. As a consequence of this anathematisation, in the tenth century, the Franks destroyed, levelled and obliterated the town. It was found accidentally in excavations early in the twentieth century.\n\nLater the same day, Metropolitan Herman and the entourage visited Saint Gorazd Monastery in Hruba Vrbka, the saint’s birthplace. There, they were received by Igumen Joachim.\n\nVisit to Slovakia and dioceses\n\nOn Wednesday, 22 September, Metropolitan Herman and those accompanying him travelled across the political border into Slovakia, and to its capital city, Bratislava. There, they met first with the chairman of the Slovak Parliament, Pavol Hrušovský, and the head of the Slovak president’s office, Milan Čič. Then, at the Embassy of the USA, Metropolitan Herman was received by Ambassador Ronald Weiser. During their meeting, Metropolitan Herman discussed co-operative efforts and witness on the part of the OCA and the Church in Slovakia, as well as related topics of mutual concern. After this, the entourage visited the Temple of Saint Rostislav, where they were received by Archpriest Jozef Havercak and many Orthodox faithful. Then Metropolitan Herman and his entourage were driven to Prešov in eastern Slovakia.\n\nOn Thursday, 23 September, Metropolitan Nikolaj (Kocvár), Primate of the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, and the Holy Synod of Bishops welcomed Metropolitan Herman and the OCA entourage. During the formal synodal session which ensued, numerous reports on various aspects of the life of the Czech-Slovak Church and the OCA were exchanged. Common missionary concerns were shared, with an emphasis on the rebuilding of the Church throughout the region, and the financial burdens faced in building over 100 new church buildings designed to replace properties lost after the fall of communism. The pressing need to address a growing number of social ills and moral challenges were also highlighted.\n\nMetropolitan Nikolai of Prešov, Metropolitan Herman\n\nAfter a press conference and a visit to Metropolitan Nikolaj’s residence and chapel of the Holy Cross, Metropolitan Herman visited the Prešov Orthodox Theological Faculty, which at that time had an enrolment of more than 500 students. Protopresbyter Peter Kormanik, dean, welcomed Metropolitan Herman, who addressed the faculty and students. He also met with representatives of the Church’s vibrant youth movement. A meeting with Prešov Mayor Milan Benc followed.\n\nOn Friday, 24 September, Metropolitan Herman and his companions visited Kobylnica, the village where Saint Alexis Toth had been born and baptised. They were received there by Archpriest Nicholas Lazor. Next, they visited Holy Trinity Church in Svidnik, where they were welcomed by Archpriest Jan Sovic.\n\nHoly Trinity Church\n\nThey continued on to Medzilaborce, where Priest Jan Feckanic and parishioners received them at Holy Spirit Church.\n\nHoly Spirit Church Medzilaborce\n\nIn the same town, they visited Saint Nicholas Orphanage, where the director, Margita Dordova and chaplain, Priest Andrei Gont, were delighted to receive humanitarian aid packages donated by OCA Faithful (the transmission of which was organised by Mrs. Arlene Kallaur at the central office of the OCA).\n\nLater the same day, Metropolitan Herman and the OCA entourage were driven into the Michalovce County Košice Province (which is near the Ukrainian border, and near the city of Uzhorod there). In the Košice Province, they visited the Church of the Ascension in Strážske. There, they met Priest Michael Dzugan and Mayor Jan Tejgi and local Faithful. In the Michalovce town, they first visited Saints Cyril and Methodius Secondary Trade School, the first such school in Slovakia, which is operated by the Church. Afterwards, they were taken to Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral, where they served a moleben (prayer-service). Archpriest Stefan Jovkaj, dean, and Michalovce Mayor Jozef Bobik welcomed them warmly, as did Archpriest Ladislav Fedor, director of the diocesan chancery office. A visit to Saint Vladimir Temple, Sobrance, followed, at which Metropolitan Herman and his entourage were welcomed by Priest Bogoslav Senic.\n\nThe Temple of Saint Vladimir, Sobrance, when it was being constructed\n\nBecause, after 1989 (with the collapse of communist governments) almost all property had been taken away from the Orthodox parishes and then given to the Unia (Greek Catholics), most of the Orthodox Temples were quite new. Since 1989, the Orthodox Christian Faithful in Slovakia constructed more than 100 new Temples. They did so at their own expense, often with their own labour, and with a Christian manner of forgiveness.\n\nOn Saturday, 25 September, the Protection of the Holy Virgin Temple in Košice (a rented facility) was filled beyond capacity as Metropolitan Herman, Bishop Ján (Holonič) of Michalovce and others concelebrated the Divine Liturgy there. The Metropolitan and his entourage were welcomed by the Archpriest Kiral Ladislav, rector. At the conclusion of the Liturgy, Metropolitan Herman presented Bishop Ján with the Order of Saint Innocent, Silver Class, and Holy Relics of Saint Alexis Toth.\n\nIn Košice, the building used by the Orthodox Faithful was a former Soviet-style meeting-hall. Space was very limited, and only a few of the clergy could serve with the 2 bishops. The other bishops and clergy stood in the crowded nave. The parishioners (as many others) had been deprived of their Temple. Košice is the second-largest city of Slovakia, and the Orthodox Faithful are very numerous. They needed help to construct a new and large Temple to accommodate them. Because of this visit, funds did arrive which did help them.\n\nHoly Protection Temple, Košice, after construction, in 2016\n\nThe remainder of the day was devoted to meetings with Košice mayor Zdenko Trebula and the region’s vice-governor, Michael Ilko.\n\nOn Sunday, 26 September, there was the sanctification of the recently-expanded Cathedral of Saint Alexander of Neva in Prešov. Metropolitans Nikolaj (Kocvár) and Herman (Swaiko), and Bishops Seraphim (Storheim), Jan (Holonič) and Nikon (Liolin) concelebrated the Rite of the Sanctification of the Temple, together with Protopresbyter Robert Kondratick and the Archpriest Michael Swaiko, dean, and dozens of local clergy. This was followed immediately by the Primatial Divine Liturgy. A group of OCA Faithful from the Cleveland, Ohio, area who were visiting family members in the region also participated in the services.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the services, Metropolitan Herman was awarded the Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius, First Class, the Medal of the Orthodox Theological Faculty, and an icon of All Saints of the Czech Lands and Slovakia. Metropolitan Herman presented Metropolitan Nikolaj with the Order of Saint Innocent, Gold Class, with Holy Relics of Saint Alexis Toth, and with an icon of Saints Nicholas, Herman and Alexis. Following this, there was a formal reception attended by national and regional government officials and religious leaders, faculty and students of the theological faculty, and cathedral benefactors and parishioners.\n\nSaint Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Prešov\n\nBefore Metropolitan Herman’s departure to the USA on Monday, 27 September, he and Metropolitan Nikolaj issued a joint communiqué :\n\nThe Orthodox Church in America and the Orthodox Church in the Czech Lands and Slovakia share a deep spiritual legacy. It was in America that thousands of emigrants from the Czech Lands and Slovakia found the truth of our Holy Orthodox Faith. When many of these emigrants returned to their homeland, they brought with them the light of this Faith and contributed greatly to the renewal of Orthodoxy on their native soil. One of these emigrants, Saint Alexis Toth, as a priest and good shepherd, set the hearts of his countrymen aflame for the Orthodox Faith and led thousands into communion with the Holy Orthodox Church. He is revered today as a missionary to both America and the Czech and Slovak republics. As a sign of the deep love that unites our Churches, Metropolitan Herman has presented all the hierarchs of the Orthodox Church in the Czech Lands and Slovakia with relics of Saint Alexis. Today, our communities, as local autocephalous Churches striving to witness to the Gospel of Christ in our unique but related contexts, are eager to strengthen further the bonds of love and faith that unite us through a programme of increased contact and co-operation.\n\nPrimatial visit to the Church of Russia, 2004\n\nIn late November, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) and his small suite of companions arrived in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n\nThe accompanying entourage from the OCA included Archbishop Nathaniel (Popp) of Detroit and the Romanian Episcopate ; Bishop Seraphim (Storheim) of Ottawa and Canada ; Bishop Nikon (Liolin) of Boston and the Albanian Archdiocese ; Protopresbyter Robert Kondratick, OCA chancellor ; and Archpriest Leonid Kishkovsky, assistant to the chancellor for external affairs. Also present was a group of pilgrims from North America who had travelled to Russia especially for this occasion.\n\nWelcomed by Metropolitan Vladimir (Kotlyarov) of Saint Petersburg, Metropolitan Herman and his entourage were taken to visit various holy Temples and historical places in the city and its environs. The visitors could not manage to get to Kronstadt, but they were able to visit the Rila Monastery and to venerate there the Tomb of Saint John of Kronstadt. They were taken to the famous Smolensk Cemetery, and to the fully-restored Reliquary Chapel of Saint Xenia of Saint Petersburg (in the place it has always been). It was crowded as usual with pilgrims. They also prayed in the Temple in the cemetery which Saint Xenia had helped in secret to build. There followed a cursory tour of the Hermitage Museum, after which the pilgrims departed for Moscow.\n\nRila Monastery Tomb, Saint John of Kronstadt\n\nSaint Xenia Chapel Smolensk Cemetery Temple\n\nUpon arrival in Moscow, Metropolitan Herman was present at various meetings. Meanwhile, the pilgrims were given a brief tour of the Moscow Kremlin and then of the Holy Trinity-Saint Sergius Lavra, together with the Moscow Theological Seminary and Academy which are within its walls.\n\nHoly Dormition Cathedral, Moscow Kremlin\n\nOn Sunday, 5 December, 2004, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) joined Patriarch Aleksey II (Ridiger) of Moscow and All Russia (along with the rest of the pilgrims) at a Patriarchal Divine Liturgy in the Cathedral of the Dormition within the Moscow Kremlin walls. After the service, it was possible to venerate the Holy Relics of Saint Peter, Metropolitan of Moscow, whose reliquary rests there.\n\nIn the afternoon, Patriarch Aleksey and Metropolitan Herman served at a Moleben at the Donskoy Monastery, at which time all the pilgrims were able to venerate the holy icon of the Theotokos of the Don, and the Holy Relics of Saint Innocent of Moscow (and Alaska). In the evening, Metropolitan Herman and the pilgrims participated in the Vigil at the Novo-Spassky Monastery. They were hosted there by Archbishop Alexei (Frolov).\n\nOn Monday, 6 December, 2004, the Primatial Divine Liturgy was served at the Holy Epiphany (Elokhov) Cathedral of Moscow. Afterwards it was possible to venerate the relics of Metropolitan Saint Alexei I. The entourage were taken to Christ the Saviour Cathedral to venerate the Holy Relics of Saint Philaret of Moscow.\n\nAfter this, the North American visitors participated in the Vigil of the Feast-day of the Great Martyr Saint Catherine in the Temple of Saint Catherine-in-the-Fields. With Metropolitan Herman and the bishops were serving 8 priests, including Protopresbyter Robert Kondratick, Archimandrite Zacchaeus (Wood), Archpriest Leonid Kishkovsky, Archpriest Constantine White and Archpriest Oleg Kirilov. After this, the bishops took tea with Patriarch Aleksey II at his rural home near Moscow.\n\nSaint Catherine in the Fields Representation Temple (\"Podvoriye\")\n\nOn Tuesday, 7 December, 2004, Metropolitan Herman and Patriarch Aleksey II (Ridiger) of Moscow and All Russia concelebrated the Divine Liturgy at the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Orthodox Church in America’s Representation Church of the Great Martyr Catherine in Moscow. Besides the North American bishops, also serving were Archbishop Arseny (Epiphanov), Bishop Niphon (Seikaly) (representative of the Antiochian Patriarchate) and Bishop Sergei. After the conclusion of the celebrations, the pilgrims were taken to the Danilov Monastery in order to venerate the Holy Relics of Saint Daniel of Moscow, of Saint Alexander Nevsky, and of the Holy Relics of Saint Panteleimon (which were at that time present and blessing Moscow with a visit).\n\nIt had been in 1994 that Patriarch Aleksey made the Temple of Saint Catherine the Great Martyr (which stands prominently on a major and historical thoroughfare in central Moscow) available to the OCA for use as its representation to the Russian Orthodox Church (a sort of ecclesiastical embassy). During the Soviet period, the buildings were used by the Grabar Art Institute, an art restoration studio, although the auxiliary buildings fell into disrepair. During the first 10 years, thanks to the tireless efforts of the parish rectors, the Temple had been restored and regained its position as a well-known central Moscow landmark. It had been only in that autumn of 2004 that the whole Temple again belonged to the Church, and that all the portions were blessed. Thereafter, the whole Temple functioned much as it had before 1917.\n\nDuring his brief stay in Moscow, Metropolitan Herman informed Patriarch Aleksey about the nearly $95,000.00 in donations collected by the OCA in in September, 2004, for the victims of the terrorist attacks in Beslan, which is in the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, Russia. A Canadian Orthodox female student was amongst a group of students who brought support personally to Beslan in January, a month after the metropolitan's visit. Saint Catherine's parish (the OCA Representation) in Moscow was very helpful. Metropolitan Herman also provided for distribution of hundreds of Christmas stockings donated through funds raised by OCA parishes, youth groups, FOCA chapters, and from many persons for needy children in Russia (all organised by Arlene Kallaur at the central chancery). In addition, there had been major collections for children in Albania, Georgia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and other eastern European countries.\n\nFrom Moscow, Metropolitan Herman and the OCA entourage travelled to Helsinki, Finland.\n\nPrimatial fraternal visit to the Church of Finland, 8-13 December, 2004\n\nAt the invitation of Archbishop Leo (Makkonen) of Karelia and All Finland, Metropolitan Herman (Swaiko) made his begin his first official fraternal visit to the Autonomous Orthodox Church of Finland on 8-13 December, 2004. Metropolitan Herman arrived in Helsinki, Finland, beginning on 8 December, 2004, in order to make this visit.\n\nAccompanying Metropolitan Herman were Archbishop Nathaniel (Popp) of Detroit and the Romanian Episcopate ; Bishop Seraphim (Storheim) of Ottawa and Canada ; Bishop Nikon (Liolin) of Boston and the Albanian Archdiocese ; Protopresbyter Robert Kondratick, OCA chancellor ; Archpriest Leonid Kishkovsky, assistant to the chancellor for external affairs ; and a support staff-person.\n\nThe Orthodox Church of Finland, an autonomous Church within the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, has always maintained a close relationship with The Orthodox Church in America. It shares a common heritage centred on the Karelia region. Karelia once included substantial territory in Eastern Finland, Western Russia (now the Republic of Karelia) and Estonia. This region was the monastic home of Saint Herman of Alaska, a member of the first group of missionaries who brought the Orthodox Christian Faith to North America in 1794. The Orthodox Church of Finland is one of the country’s 2 official state religions, and she enjoys prerogatives akin to those given the dominant Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\nOn Wednesday, 8 December, 2004, Metropolitan Herman, the hierarchs, and the members of the OCA entourage were welcomed by Archbishop Leo (Makkonen), Metropolitan Ambrosius (Jääskeläinen) of Helsinki, and other dignitaries of the Finnish Orthodox Church at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport.\n\nThat afternoon, Metropolitan Herman was received by Mr. Paavo Lipponen, Speaker of the Finnish Parliament, with whom he discussed the strong ties between the Orthodox Churches of Finland and America. During his visit, Metropolitan Herman was also received by His Excellency, Earle I Mack, USA Ambassador to Finland, and Deputy Ambassador Robert Weisberg at the USA Embassy. He also met with Archbishop Dr. Jukka Paarma, Presiding Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, where he was briefed on the relationship between the two state churches.\n\nThe bishops and the entourage then moved on to Joensuu (436 km/271 mi northeast of Helsinki).\n\nOn Thursday, 9 December, they visited Saint John the Theologian Orthodox Theological Seminary in Joensuu. The seminary’s Rector, Archpriest Rauno Pietarinen, a graduate of Saint Vladimir’s Seminary, Crestwood, New York, welcomed Metropolitan Herman as he entered the school’s chapel for the celebration of a Moleben of Thanksgiving. Following the service, Metropolitan Herman delivered a lecture to the students about theological education in the OCA. He traced the history and mission of the OCA’s seminaries, and he pointed out similarities between the life of the Church in North America and that of Finland. Before leaving the seminary to visit the Orthodox Theological Department at Joensuu University, Metropolitan Herman presented Father Pietarinen with the Order of Saint Innocent, Bronze Class.\n\nOrthodox Seminary ; Saint John the Theologian Chapel\n\nProfessor Teuvo Pohjolainen, University of Joensuu vice-rector, and Professor Petri Piiroinen, Orthodox faculty member, welcomed Metropolitan Herman at the Theological Department. They briefed the metropolitan and members of his entourage about the various graduate level courses in Orthodox theology offered by the school. A luncheon followed at the seminary.\n\nThen Metropolitan Herman and his companions visited Joensuu’s picturesque Saint Nicholas Temple. Built of wood, the Temple is reminiscent of many built in the 19th century in Alaska. Archpriest Kalevi Kokkonen, rector, and many Faithful welcomed Metropolitan Herman prior to the celebration of a Moleben of Thanksgiving. During a reception that followed, Metropolitan Herman, during his remarks, outlined the common historic bonds shared by the Churches in Finland and America, while Father Leonid Kishkovsky discussed the Churches’ work in the field of ecumenism.\n\nSaint Nicholas Temple, Joensuu\n\nIn the evening, Archimandrite Sergei, abbot of the New Valamo Monastery, welcomed Metropolitan Herman in the monastery Temple for the celebration of Vespers. Built in 1977, the Temple is modelled after temples in the Pskov region of northern Russia. The monastery, as its name indicates, was founded by monks who fled Russia’s Valaam Monastery at the outset of World War II. The monastery had been heavily damaged, yet the monks were able to salvage numerous icons, relics, and other ecclesiastical items now used or on display in New Valamo. Well-known throughout Scandinavia, New Valamo attracts a very large number of pilgrims and tourists annually. The Orthodox Lay Academy on the monastery grounds has been the site of numerous international and regional conferences and seminars on a variety of topics. It offers a range of courses, from theology and Church history to icon-painting and restoration and vestment-making. The monastery’s library, most of it from the original Valaam Monastery on Lake Ladoga, is housed in a separate building and it contains tens of thousands of books and historic documents, including letters written by Saint Herman of Alaska.\n\nHoly Transfiguration Temple, Valamo Monastery\n\nOn Friday, 10 December, Metropolitan Herman and the entourage were given a comprehensive tour of the monastery grounds : the academy’s iconography, icon-restoration, the icon conservatory, and metal workshops ; the Valaam Library, and the museum, in which many precious items from Valaam Monastery and elsewhere are on display. While visiting in the monastery cemetery, they prayed at the grave of Archbishop Paul (Olmari). The archbishop, who had participated in the canonisation of Saint Herman of Alaska in 1970, was well known for his classic book, “The Faith We Hold”.\n\nGrave-marker of Archbishop Paul/Paavali (Olmari) of Finland\n\nThe same day, Metropolitan Herman, the hierarchs, and the members of the OCA entourage visited the neighbouring Lintula Women’s Monastery, where they celebrated a Moleben of Thanksgiving, and where they were offered a warm welcome by Mother Marina (Iltola), abbess, and by Archimandrite Herman. At the monastery they toured the candle factory and grounds and they shared a meal with the sisterhood.\n\nLintula Women's Monastery\n\nOn Saturday, 11 December, the entourage participated in a Hierarchical Divine Liturgy in New Valamo Monastery. Afterwards, Archbishop Leo, Metropolitan Herman and the others transferred to Kuopio. Metropolitan Herman and his entourage were hosted at the residence of Archbishop Leo (Makkonen). They also visited the Church of Saint John the Theologian and the Enlighteners of Karelia and the Orthodox Church Museum, where they were given a comprehensive tour by Veli (brother) Matti Sormunen. The museum boasts an immense collection of icons and other ecclesiast"
