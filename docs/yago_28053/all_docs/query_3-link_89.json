The substantial articles and\n\nessays are:\n\na.) Karl Schmidt \"Probleme um den 'Grafen Kuno von Oehningen' in *Dorf\n\nund Stift Oehningen* (1966) edited by Herbert Berner, pp.43-93.\n\nb.) Armin Wolf \"Were war Kuno von 'Oehningen'?\" in *Deutches Archiv*,\n\n1980 vol.36, pp.25-81.\n\nc.) Eduard Hlawitschka \"Wer waren Kuno und Richlind von Oehningen?\n\nKritische Ueberlegungen zu einen neuen Identifitzierungsvorschlag\"\n\npp.1-49 of *Zeitschrift fur die Geschichte des Oberrheins* vol.128,\n\n1980.\n\nd.) Eduard Hlawitschka \"Die Thronkandidaturen von 1002 und 1024:\n\nGruendeten sie im Verwandtenanspruch oder in Vorstellungen von freier\n\nWahl?\" in *Reich und Kirche vor dem Inventiturstreit*(Sigmaringen: Jan\n\nThorbecke, 1985) edited by Karl Schmidt, pp.49-64\n\nThe third article is a reply to Wolf. All of these articles recite the\n\nrelevant portions of the *Genealogia Welforum* and *Historia\n\nWelforum* and the relevant charters. The last article is the most recent\n\nof the batch.\n\nThe present picture seems to be that Kuno (which name is a short form\n\nvariant of 'Konrad') is to be identified with Konrad (b.925/30 d.\n\n20/8/997) duke of Swabia father of Hermann II. The problem\n\nis Richlind. The charter in which she is mentioned is a proven fabrication\n\nand that her mention in the GW an invention. Konrad of Swabia had a\n\nproven wife, Judith. In the last article by Hlawitschka, he presents a\n\nvery clever and plausible reconstruction of Judith's ancestry. If he is\n\ncorrect then she was indeed related to the emperor Otto I. According to\n\nthe reconstruction Judith would be Otto's 1st cousin twice removed. On\n\nher mother's side she would be the great granddaughter of one of Otto's\n\npaternal uncles (i.e. a brother of king Henry the Fowler). The point seems\n\nto be that the GW etc in assigning an alleged daughter of Otto as the\n\nwife of Kuno von Oehningen were indicating that Kuno's wife had blood\n\nties with the royal dynasty ('koenigsnahe') and in this these sources\n\nwere correct. What was mistaken was the name and precise relationship\n\nto the dynasty. In any event if Kuno is identical with duke Konrad, he\n\nwould have had something that even the current Saxon dynasty did not,\n\nkoenigsnahe with the Carolingians (his mother was one such).\n\nThis is a mere sketch of what I take to be the present state of play. The\n\ndebate may of course have moved on since I researched the subject\n\n(about 1990).\n\nIf Kuno is identical with Konrad of Swabia then it would seem that he\n\nhas an interesting array of children. Part of the problem of Kuno's\n\nidentity was that his children married into the highest levels of the\n\nnobility which suggested that he was something more than the mere lord\n\nof Oehningen. Kuno/Konrad would have been about 52/57 when he became\n\nduke so he would have been known as a count in the Rheingau (949) and\n\nlord of Oehningen.\"\n\nI wish I was sure of every name in this file &amp; that I didnt\n\nneed to know what you think :) hey, but always refining this,\n\nSo if you spot a place where Im just flat wrong please tell\n\nme or someone I didnt go on out with, I do this file out of fun and wanting to know, but do not\n\nrespond to the 'know it alls' , that dont have manners.I dont\n\nconsider them Kin!\n\nThanks and Happy Hunting!"
