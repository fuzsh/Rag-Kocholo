        "text": "FRANKS, carolingian kings\n\nv4.1 Updated 26 July 2020\n\nRETURN TO INDEX\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nINTRODUCTION. 1\n\nChapter 1. KINGS of the FRANKS 751-840 (CAROLINGIANS)3\n\nChapter 2. KINGS of the WEST FRANKS 843-987 (CAROLINGIANS)23\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis document sets out the family of the Frankish kings and emperors known to history as the Carolingians until the division of the empire under the Treaty of Verdun in 843, and thereafter the Carolingian rulers of the kingdom of the West Franks (France) until their extinction in the male line in 987. The kings of Lotharingia and kings of the East Frankish kingdom (Germany), both also formed under the 843 treaty, are shown in the documents LOTHARINGIA, KINGS, and GERMANY, KINGS & EMPERORS respectively. The Carolingian kings of Italy and kings of Aquitaine are set out in the two documents ITALY, EMPERORS & KINGS, and AQUITAINE DUKES. All these documents are hyperlinked from this document.\n\nThe Carolingian monarchy was established in 751 when Pépin \"le Bref\", maior domus of Childeric III, last king of the Merovingian dynasty (see the documents FRANKS, MEROVINGIAN KINGS and FRANKS, MEROVINGIAN NOBILITY), deposed his nominal lord and declared himself king with the support of the Papacy. At that time, the Frankish empire covered Francia (Austrasia and Neustria), Alemannia, Burgundy, Provence, Thuringia and the archbishoprics of Metz and Trier. The territory of the empire was considerably extended during the succeeding fifty years. King Pépin conquered Aquitaine in 768. King Charles I subjugated the Italian Lombard kingdom in 773, Friulia in 776, Saxony in 777, and the march of Spain in 778. Bavaria and Carinthia were incorporated into the Frankish kingdom in 787, and full control over Alemannia, Hessen and Thuringia was confirmed by 797. The Frankish empire was formally established when Charles was crowned emperor by the Pope in Rome in 800.\n\nThe inherent weakness of the Carolingian Frankish empire was the continual process of territorial division designed to placate junior members of the dynasty, although presumably some sort of regional sub-rule was inevitable given the empire's geographic extent and ethnic diversity. The tradition of dividing the territory between family members started after the death of King Pépin in 768, when his younger son Carloman was granted Burgundy, Provence, Gothia [Septimania], Alsace and Swabia, while his older son Charles ruled in Neustria, Aquitaine and the larger part of Austrasia, although the kingdom was reunited after Carloman died in 771. Emperor Charles formalised another division in 806, under which his oldest son Charles ruled Austrasia, Neustria, northern Burgundy, northern Alemannia, Thuringia, Saxony, Frisia and the Bavarian Nordgau, his second son Pépin was confirmed as king of Italy and in addition received Bavaria, Carinthia (except Nordgau) and Alemannia south of the river Danube, while the third son Louis became sovereign of Aquitaine, Gascony, Septimania, Provence and southern Burgundy. This territorial split was also short-lived as the two older sons predeceased their father. The numerous territorial divisions promulgated by Emperor Louis I were particularly controversial, especially after his youngest son, born from his second marriage, was brought into the picture in 829 when he was invested with Alemannia, Rhætia, Alsace and part of Burgundy at the age of six. The following ten years saw civil war between the emperor's four sons, only finally settled by the Treaty of Verdun in 843 which brought about the final division of the empire into the three separate kingdoms of the West Franks (France), the East Franks (Germany), and Lotharingia, an artificial creation between the other two kingdoms which stretched from the North Sea coast in the north to Italy in the south.\n\nAfter the 843 partition, the imperial title was retained by the senior Lotharingian/Italian branch of the dynasty until the death of Emperor Louis II (see ITALY, EMPERORS & KINGS) without male heirs in 875. After that date, the title was borne by his youngest paternal uncle, Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks. On the death of the latter two years later, the title passed to the East Frankish branch (see GERMANY, KINGS & EMPERORS), with whom it remained until the extinction of the dynasty in the male line in 911.\n\nA striking feature of the genealogy of the Carolingian dynasty is the absence of detailed information concerning the daughters of the family. The examples are numerous:\n\nGisela, daughter of King Pépin, about whose possible marriage there is some speculation.\n\nthe relationships of three of the daughters of Emperor Charlemagne (none of whom married their lovers, it would appear).\n\nthe daughters of Emperor Louis I.\n\nthe four younger daughters of Emperor Charles II \"le Chauve\" by his first wife.\n\ntwo of the daughters of Louis II \"le Bègue\" King of the West Franks.\n\nThe case of Frederuna, first wife of Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks, is also interesting as only sketchy information is known about her origin (although presumably she was from a prominent family), and very little is known about her six daughters.\n\nPresumably some, if not all, of these Carolingian princesses contracted marriages with the nobility and left descendants, although few hints concerning such descents are provided in the primary sources so far consulted. This absence of information is curious as the prestige of descent from the Carolingian dynasty was such that later sources frequently refer indirectly to such descents, but without giving enough detail to reassure the researcher about the accuracy of the assertion. Two such dubious cases have been included in this document, in square brackets to indicate doubt: firstly, the descendants of Chunibert, supposed grandson of King Pépin, and secondly the possible descent of the Udalrichinger counts in northern Switzerland from an otherwise unknown sister of Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks.\n\nIt is also possible that descents in the male line exist from the illegitimate sons of the Carolingian emperors and kings. For example, Arnoul, illegitimate son of Emperor Louis I who installed him as Comte de Sens, may have married and had children about whom nothing is revealed in the sources. The same is true of Arnoul and Drogo, illegitimate sons of Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks, about whom only their names and parentage are known from the primary sources.\n\nChapter 1. KINGS of the FRANKS 751-840 (CAROLINGIANS)\n\nPEPIN, son of CHARLES \"Martel\" & his first wife Chrothrudis ([715]-Saint-Denis 24 Sep 768, bur église de l'abbaye royale de Saint Denis) . Einhard names \"Karlomannum et Pippinum atque Grifonem\" as the three sons of \"Karlus maior domus\" when recording the latter's death . He succeeded his father as maior domus jointly with his brother Carloman. They deprived their half-brother Grifo of his inheritance and defeated him after he rebelled against them. In the division of territories agreed with his brother Carloman, Pépin governed Neustria, Burgundy, Provence, Metz and Trier. The brothers were faced with revolts in Frisia, Bavaria, Alemannia and Aquitaine. As a symbolic assertion of their authority, they nominated Childeric III as Merovingian king in 743. In 745, Pépin appropriated the province of Alemannia for himself. The Royal Frankish Annals record that Pepin deposed King Childeric III at Soissons in Nov 751, with approval from Pope Zacharius , and succeeded as PEPIN le Bref King of the Franks. He was anointed king at Saint-Denis 28 Jul 754 by Pope Stephen III [II], who had come to France to seek Pépin's help against the Lombards . During his expedition to Italy the following year, Pépin obliged the Lombards to accept the independence of Rome, marking the beginning of the Papal State. He recaptured Narbonne from the Muslim invaders in [759], and finally conquered Aquitaine after the death of Duke Waifar in 768. The necrology of Prüm records the death \"768 VIII Kal Oct\" of \"Pippinus vir illuster\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"VIII Kal Oct\" of \"Pipinus rex\" . The necrology of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death 768 VIII Kal Oct of Pippini regis . The Annales Metenses record the death \"VIII Kal Oct\" of \"Pippinus\" and his burial \"in basilica beati Dionysii\" . His burial place is confirmed by the Annales Laurissenses which record that the body of \"domna Berta regina\" was transferred to \"ecclesia sancti Dionysii martiris\" next to her husband .\n\nm ([743/44]) BERTRADA [Berta] \"au Grand Pied\", daughter of CHARIBERT Comte de Laon & his wife --- ([720]-Choisy-au-Bac, near Compiègne 12 Jul 783 , bur église de l'abbaye royale de Saint Denis). The Annales Laurissenses record the marriage in 749 of \"Bertradem cognomine Bertam, Cariberti Laudunensis comitis filiam\" and \"Pippinus\" . \"Pippinus rex Francorum\" donated property to found Kloster Prüm by charter dated 13 Aug 762 which names \"coniux mea Bertrada genitor suus Heribertus\" . Pépin planned to divorce his wife, but was convinced otherwise by Pope Paul I in 762. After the death of her husband, she assumed a prominent role in government. She tried unsuccessfully to reconcile her two sons, meeting with Carloman at Seltz and also travelling to Italy in 770 . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Berhta regina\" brought \"filiam Desiderii regis Langobardorum\" back from Italy as the wife for \"Karolo filio suo\" . The Annales Laurissenses record the death \"783 IV Id Jul\" of \"domna Berta regina\", her burial \"in Cauciaco\", and the subsequent transfer of her body to \"ecclesia sancti Dionysii martiris\" next to her husband . The necrology of Argenteuil Priory records the death \"IV Id Jul\" of \"Bertrada regina\" .\n\nKing Pépin & his wife had six children:\n\n1. CHARLES ([near Aix-la-Chapelle] 2 Apr [747/48]-Aix-la-Chapelle 28 Jan 814, bur Aix-la-Chapelle, Chapelle Sainte-Marie) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Karolum et Karlomannum et Gislam\" as children of \"Pipinus rex ex Bertrada regina\" . On the death of his father, he received the larger part of Austrasia, Neustria and western Aquitaine, succeeding as CHARLES I Joint-King of the Franks, crowned 9 Oct 768 at Noyon.\n\n- see below.\n\n2. CARLOMAN (751-Samoussy, near Laon 4 Dec 771, bur Reims, église de l'abbaye de Saint-Rémi) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Karolum et Karlomannum et Gislam\" as children of \"Pipinus rex ex Bertrada regina\" . He is named second son of King Pépin and Bertrada in the Cartulaire of Saint-Bertin . At the coronation of his father in 754, Carloman was also anointed by the Pope with his brother Charles . On the death of his father, he received Burgundy, Provence, Gothia [Septimania], Alsace and Swabia, succeeding as CARLOMAN Joint King of the Franks. He refused to support his brother in suppressing a revolt in Aquitaine in Mar 769, but they were reconciled in early 770. His death is recorded in the Royal Frankish Annals . Einhard records the death \"II Non Dec\" 771 of \"Karlomannus frater [Karoli]\" at \"villa Salmontiaco\" . The Annales Fuldenses record the death \"II Non Dec 771 in villa Salmuntiaco\" of \"Karlomannus rex\" and his burial \"Remis\" . The Annalium Sancti Amandi records the death at \"Salmuniaco 771 pridie Non Dec\" of \"Karlomannus\" . The Annales Xantenses record the death \"II Non Dec 771\" of \"Karlomannus rex\" . The Annales Laurissenses record that \"Carlomanni\" was buried \"iuxta urbem Remorum in basilicam beati Remigii\" in 771 . The necrology of Reims Saint-Rémi records the death \"II Non Dec\" of \"Karlomannus Francorum rex\" . m ([769]) GERBERGA, daughter of --- (-772 or after). The Annales Laurissenses name \"Girberga uxor Carlomanni\" when recording that she left for Italy after her husband died . She is not mentioned in any of the surviving charters of her husband . The Annales Lobienses record that \"uxor eius [=Karlomannus] cum duobus filiis et Otgario marchione\" took refuge with \"Desiderium regem, patrem suum\" after the death of her husband , which would mean that she was Gerberga of the Lombards, daughter of Desiderius King of the Lombards. Settipani highlights that this may be incorrect, assuming that the text results from confusion with the first wife of Carloman's older brother King Charles being the daughter of King Desiderius, and the fact that Gerberga sought refuge at the Lombard court . Another factor is also significant in deciding the question: numerous authorities, for example the Annales Fuldenses , record the visit to Italy of Queen Berta, mother of Charles and Carloman, to bring back the bride for her son Charles, but none mentions two sisters being brought back as brides for the two brothers. On the other hand, the fact that King Desiderius supported the candidacy of Gerberga's son Pépin to succeed his father could have been motivated by a close family relationship (see below). There is no direct proof of the date of Gerberga's marriage. If Gerberga was the daughter of King Desiderius, it is reasonable to suppose that the marriage would have taken place at the same time as the marriage of Carloman's brother, whose first wife was the daughter of King Desiderius, although this would leave little time for two children to have been born from the marriage before Carloman died. King Carloman & his wife had two children:\n\na) PEPIN (770-after 774). The Annales Petaviani record the birth in 770 of \"Pipini filii Karlomanni\" . The Annales Lobienses record his mother's departure to Italy \"cum duobus filiis\" after her husband's death . Einhard also records that \"Karlomannus frater [Karoli] uxor eius et filii\" went to Italy after Carloman died . Desiderius King of the Lombards supported Pépin's claim to succeed his father, and requested Pope Adrian I to crown him. He fled King Charles I to Verona in 774 and was later confined to a monastery .\n\nb) child (-after 772). The evidence for the existence of this second child is provided by the Annales Lobienses which record his mother's departure to Italy \"cum duobus filiis\" after her husband died . Einhard also records that \"Karlomannus frater [Karoli] uxor eius et filii\" went to Italy after Carloman died . Although he does not specify how many children were involved, there was presumably insufficient time between Carloman's marriage and his death for his wife to have given birth to more than two children. There is no indication of the sex of this second child.\n\n3. GISELA (757-Chelles 30 Jul 810) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Karolum et Karlomannum et Gislam\" children of \"Pipinus rex ex Bertrada regina\" . Einhard names \"Gisla unica soror\" of King Charles, specifying that she was \"a puellaribus annis religiosæ conversationi mancipata\" . The continuator of the Annales Petaviani record the birth in 757 of \"Gislanæ\" . Abbess of Chelles 788. \"Ghysela regis filia Pippini et Bertredane regine\" donated \"Villa Putialis\" to Saint-Denis by charter dated 12 Jun 799 . \"Carolus rex Francorum et Langobardorum\" confirmed the donation to the abbey of Saint-Denis by \"illustris deo sacrata Gisla soror nostra\" by charter dated 15 Jun 799 which names \"domne Bertradane genitricis nostre\" . Betrothed (765, contract broken 766) to LEON of Byzantium, son of Emperor KONSTANTINOS V \"Kopronymos\" & his first wife Eirene [née Chichek] of the Khazars (Jan 750-8 Sep 780, bur Constantinople, Church of the Holy Apostles). He succeeded in 775 as Emperor LEON IV. [m WENILO [Bishop of Laon]. Settipani discusses this possible marriage, noting that \"Gisela and her husband Wenilo\" are listed in the obituary of Argenteuil . However, the couple's being named together in this obituary does not appear consistent with Gisela's monastic career which, as shown above, she started more than twenty years before she died.]\n\n4. PEPIN (759-[761/62]). The Annales Laurissenses record the birth in 759 of \"Pippinus regis filius\" who was named after his father, specifying that he lived two years and died in his third year . His birth and death two years later are recorded in the Royal Frankish Annals .\n\n5. CHROTHAIS (-young, bur Metz, Saint Arnoul). \"Rodthaid\" is named daughter of King Pépin in the Pauli Gesta, when recording her place of burial . Paulus Diaconus wrote a poem in memory of \"Rothaidis filiæ Pippini regis\", which names \"germanus Karolus, Pippinus pater Pippinus proavus abavus Anschisa [huius] pater beatus Arnulfus\" .\n\n6. ADELAIS (-young, bur Metz, Saint Arnoul). \"Adelaid\" is named daughter of King Pépin in the Pauli Gesta, when recording her place of burial . Paulus Diaconus wrote a poem in memory of \"Adheleidis filiæ [Pippini regis]\" .\n\n7. [daughter . The only reference to this unnamed daughter is in the Vita Maximini Episcopi Trevirensis which records that \"Pippini regis ex filia nepos Chunibertus\" was \"atrociter a dæmone vexatus\" and cured after he was taken to the saint , assuming that \"nepos\" in this context is correctly translated as grandson. This contradicts Einhard who names Gisela as the only sister of Charles I King of the Franks . m ---.] [One possible child:]\n\na) [CHUNIBERT . The Vita Maximini Episcopi Trevirensis records that \"Pippini regis ex filia nepos Chunibertus\" was \"atrociter a dæmone vexatus\" and cured after he was taken to the saint .] The Annales Murbacenses record the foundation of the monastery in 715 by \"comes Eberhardus, filius ducis Adelberti\", and his donations following the death of \"filio predicti comitis\", with the consent of \"fratris sui Leudofredi et coniugis sue Emeltrudis\", and his burial in the monastery .\n\n8. [daughter . The only reference to this unnamed daughter is in the Annales Murbacenses which records that \"sanctus Sintpertus sive Simbertus, Caroli magni ex sorore nepos\" was fifth abbot of the monastery of Murbach . m ---.] [One possible child:]\n\na) [SINTBERT . The Annales Murbacenses name \"sanctus Sintpertus sive Simbertus, Caroli magni ex sorore nepos\" as fifth abbot of the monastery of Murbach .]\n\nCHARLES, son of PEPIN \"le Bref\" King of the Franks & his wife Bertrada [Berta] \"au Grand Pied\" ([near Aix-la-Chapelle ] 2 Apr [747/48]-Aix-la-Chapelle 28 Jan 814, bur Aix-la-Chapelle, Chapelle Sainte-Marie) . He is named first son of King Pépin and Bertrada in the Cartulaire of Saint-Bertin . A calendar from Lorsch records the birth IV Non Apr of Karoli imperatoris et semper augusti . The year of his birth is open to debate. The Annales Fuldenses record his death in 814 at the age of about 71 , which would suggest [742/43] which is inconsistent with the suggested marriage date of his parents (see above). The Annalium Petavianorum Continuatio record the birth in 747 of Karolus rex . Settipani suggests that this date should be considered Old Style. This assumes (1) that the Lorsch calendar correctly records the day of his birth, (2) that the order of entries for that year in the Annalium Petavianorum Continuatio is chronological (the preceding sentence records Carlomans departure for Rome which is dated to after 15 Aug 747 ), and (3) that 2 Apr 747 was Easter Sunday which he suggests would have been noted in sources if it had been the emperors date of birth . It seems preferable to indicate [747/48] as Charless possible date of birth. The conjectures about Charless place of birth were discussed at length by Hahn in the mid-19th century . At the coronation of his father in 754, Charles was also anointed by Pope Stephen III [II] . On the death of his father, he received the larger part of Austrasia, Neustria and western Aquitaine, succeeding as CHARLES I joint King of the Franks, jointly with his brother Carloman, and was crowned 9 Oct 768 at Noyon. He suppressed the revolt of Hunald in Aquitaine in 769, over which he quarrelled with his brother Carloman . On the death of his brother in 771, he set aside the rights of his nephew and became sole king of the Franks. He defended the Pope against the Lombards, conquering their kingdom in 773. He is recorded in charters as having used the title \"rex Francorum et Langobardorum\" from 5 Jun 774, adding \"atque patricius Romanorum\" from 16 Jul 774 . He accepted the submission of Saxony at Paderborn in 777. During his campaign in Spain in 778, he captured Pamplona, while Zaragoza, Huesca, Barcelona and Girona swore allegiance to him. He had his sons crowned king of the Lombards and king of the Aquitainians by Pope Adrian I at Rome 15 Apr 781. He incorporated Bavaria and Carinthia into his kingdom in 787, followed by Thuringia, Hessen and Alemannia, by 797. He re-established Pope Leo III after the latter was ambushed by the Romans in 799, and was crowned CHARLES I Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans in St Peter's Rome 25 Dec 800, which the Pope justified technically on the basis of an alleged vacancy of the imperial throne, which could not be occupied by a woman, during the reign at Constantinople of Empress Eirene. At the assembly of Thionville 6 Feb 806, Emperor Charles decided the division of territories between his sons. Byzantine ambassadors from Emperor Mikhael I finally recognised Charlemagne as emperor (although not \"Roman Emperor\") at Aix-la-Chapelle in 812 . After the death of his two older sons, he crowned his son Louis as associate emperor at Aix-la-Chapelle 11 Sep 813. The necrology of Prüm records the death \"814 V Kal Feb\" of \"Karolus imperator\" . The Annales Fuldenses record the death \"814 V Kal Feb\" of \"Karolus imperator\" at Aachen at the age of about 71 . The necrology of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death 814 V Kal Feb of domni Karoli imperatoris .\n\nm firstly (769, repudiated [770/early 771]) --- of the Lombards, daughter of DESIDERIUS King of the Lombards & his wife Ansa ---. Einhard calls King Charles's first wife \"filiam Desiderii regis Langobardorum\" . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Berhta regina\" brought \"filiam Desiderii regis Langobardorum\" back from Italy as the wife for \"Karolo filio suo\" . Her husband sent her back to her father after repudiating her.\n\nm secondly (Aix-la-Chapelle 771 before 30 Apr) HILDEGARD, daughter of GEROLD Graf im Kraichgau [Udalrichinger] & his wife Imma (758-Thionville, Moselle 30 Apr 783 , bur Metz, église abbatiale de Saint-Arnoul ). Einhard refers to Hildegard as \"de gente Suavorum\" . Thegan's Vita Hludowici Imperatoris names her \"Hildigardam quæ erat de cognatione Gotefridi ducis Alamannorum\" and specifies that she was the daughter of Imma . The Annales Laurissenses record the death \"783 pridie Kal Mai\" of \"Hildegardis regina\" and her burial \"iuxta urbem Mettensem in basilica apostolorum et beati Arnulfi\" . She died from the after effects of childbirth, according to the epitaph of her daughter Hildegard . Paulus Diaconus wrote an epitaph to \"Hildegardis regina\" .\n\nm thirdly (Worms Oct 783 ) FASTRADA, daughter of RADULF Graf & his wife --- (-Frankfurt-am-Main 10 Oct 794, bur Mainz, St Alban ). The Annales Laurissenses record the marriage in 783 at Worms of King Charles and \"domne Fastradæ regina\" . Einhard's Annals record the king's marriage in 783 to \"filiam Radolfi comitis natione Francam, nomine Fastradam\" . Fastrada, wife of King Charles, is referred to as \"de Orientalium Francorum, Germanorum videlicet\" by Einhard . Her cruelty triggered the revolt of her husband's illegitimate son Pépin \"le Bossu\" in 792 . The Annales Xantenses record the death in Frankfurt in 794 of \"Fastrada regina\" . Einhard records the death in 794 of \"Fastrada regina\" at Frankfurt and her burial \"Mogontiaci apud sanctum Albanum\" . Theodulf wrote the epitaph of \"Fastradæ reginæ\" .\n\nm fourthly ([794/autumn 796]) LIUTGARD, daughter of --- (-Tours 4 Jun 800, bur Tours, église Saint-Martin ). Einhard names \"Liudgardam Alamannam\" as King Charles's fourth wife, specifying that she died childless . Angilbert's poem Ad Pippinum Italiæ regum names \"Liutgardis\" as the wife of King Charles . The Annales Laurissenses Continuatio records the death \"II Non Iun 800\" at Tours of \"domnæ Liutgardæ coniugis\" and her burial at Tours .\n\nMistress (1): HIMILTRUD, daughter of ---. \"Himiltrude nobili puella\" is named mother of \"Pippinum\" in the Gesta Mettensium .\n\nMistress (2): ---. Einhard refers to \"Ruodhaidem\" as the daughter of King Charles and an unnamed concubine .\n\nMistress (3): [MADELGARD] , daughter of ---. Settipani names Madelgardis as the mistress of King Charles, and mother of Rothildis abbess of Faremoutiers . However, he cites no primary source on which this is based, apart from a reference to an early 9th century list of nuns at Faremoutiers which includes the name. No reference has been found to her in any of the sources so far consulted.\n\nMistress (4): GERSWINDA, daughter of ---. Einhard names King Charles's concubine \"Gersuindam Saxonici generis\", and her daughter Adaltrud .\n\nMistress (5): REGINA, daughter of ---. 800. Einhard names King Charles's concubine \"Reginam\", and her sons \"Drogonem et Hugum\" .\n\nMistress (6): ADELINDIS, daughter of ---. 806. Einhard names King Charles's concubine \"Adallindem\", and her son \"Theodricum\" .\n\nKing Charles I & his second wife had nine children :\n\n1. CHARLES ([772/73]-in Bavaria 4 Dec 811 ) . He is named, and his parentage recorded, in the Gesta Mettensium, which specifies that he was his parents' first son . The Chronicon Fontanellense records that Charles I King of the Franks proposed a marriage between Offæ Rege Anglorum sive Merciorum filiam and Carolus iunior, but that King Offa refused unless Berta filia Caroli Magni was also married to his son which was unacceptable to the Frankish king . King Charles ordered an embargo on trade imports from England as a result . His father associated Charles in the government of Francia and Saxony in 790 . Comte [duc?] du Mans [790]: the Annales Laurissenses record that \"rex Carolus\" installed \"primogenitum filium suum Carolum\" in \"ultra Sequaname ducatum Cenomannicum\" but that this reverted to his father in the summer of the same year . From this time Charles used the title king, and was crowned King of the Franks at Rome 25 Dec 800. Einhard records that \"Karolum filium suum [Karoli imperatoris]\" invaded \"terram Sclavorum Sorabi\" in 806 as far as \"super Albium fluvium\" and that \"Miliduoch Sclavorum dux\" was killed during the campaign . At the partition agreed at Thionville in 806, Charles was designated sovereign of Francia (Austrasia and Neustria), northern Burgundy, northern Alemannia, Thuringia, Saxony, Frisia and the Bavarian Nordgau . The Gesta Francorum records the death \"811 II Non Dec\" of \"Karolus filius imperatoris qui maior natu erat\" . Einhard's Annales also record the death \"811 II Non Dec\" of \"Karlus filius imperatoris qui maior natu erat\" . The Annales Fuldenses record the death \"811 II Non Dec\" of \"Karolus filius imperator qui maior natu erat\" .\n\n2. ADELAIS (in Italy [Sep 773/Jun 774]-in Italy [Jul/Aug] 774, bur Metz, église abbatiale de Saint-Arnoul). She was born during the siege of Pavia, but died during the return journey to France . \"Adelaid\" is named daughter of King Charles in the Pauli Gesta, when recording her place of burial . Paulus Diaconus wrote an epitaph to \"Adeleidis filia Karoli regis\" specifying that she was born in Italy .\n\n3. HROTHRUDIS [Rotrud] ([775]-6 Jun 810 ) . \"Hruodrudem et Bertham et Gislam\" are named daughters of King Charles & Hildegard by Einhard . Angilbert's poem Ad Pippinum Italiæ regum names (in order) \"Chrodthrudis Berta Gisla et Theodrada\" as daughters of King Charles . Theodulf's poem Ad Carolum Rege changes the order slightly when he names \"Berta Chrodtrudh Gisla Rothaidh Hiltrudh, Tetdrada\" as daughters of the king . The betrothal of \"Hruodrudem quæ filiarum eius primogenita\" with \"Constantino, Græcorum imperatore\" is recorded by Einhard . She was given the name ERYTHRO in Greek .

Wilhelm Kurze appears to have disproved the theory of the alleged marriage of Hiltrud to Eberhard [I] Graf [von Calw], a court official of Emperor Charlemagne . According to Rösch, Hiltrud was the mistress (between [799/804]) of Richwin Count of Padua, brother of Richbod Bishop of Trier, who was at the court of Emperor Charlemagne between 792 and 814, and was the mother of an illegitimate son by him . He cites no primary source on which this is based and no reference to this has been found in the sources so far consulted.

He died after falling into the River Oignon in which he was fishing . A list of bishops of Metz records \"domnus Drogo archiepiscopus et sacri palate summus capellanus, filius Karoli imperatoris\" as 40th bishop, holding the position for 32 years, 5 months and 7 days, his death \"VI Id Dec in Burgundia, prædio sancti Petri Mimeriaco\" and his burial in \"urbem Medimmatricorum in ecclesia beati Iohannis apostoli\" .\n\n17.HUGO [Hugues] \"lAbbé\" ([802/06]-killed in battle Angoulême 14 Jun 844, bur Abbaye de Charroux).

He is named, and his parentage recorded, in the Gesta Mettensium, which specifies that he was his parents' third son, born a twin with his brother Hlothar . Crowned King of the Aquitainians in Rome 15 Apr 781 by Pope Hadrian I. His armies occupied Girona, Urgel and Cerdanya in 785 and besieged Barcelona in 802, establishing the \"March of Spain\" . At the partition of territories agreed at Thionville in 806, he was designated sovereign of Aquitaine, Gascony, Septimania, Provence and southern Burgundy. His father named him as his successor at Aix-la-Chapelle, crowning him as joint emperor 11 Sep 813 . On his father's death, he adopted the title Emperor LOUIS I der Fromme/le Pieux 2 Feb 814, and was crowned at Reims [Jul/Aug] 816 by Pope Stephen IV. He did not use the titles king of the Franks or king of Italy so as to emphasise the unity of the empire . He promulgated the Ordinatio Imperii at Worms in 817, which established his eldest son as his heir, his younger sons having a subordinate status, a decision which was eventually to lead to civil war between his sons. His nephew Bernard King of Italy, ignored in the Ordinatio Imperii, rebelled against his uncle, but was defeated and killed. After his death, Italy was placed under the direct rule of the emperor. Emperor Louis crowned his son Lothaire as joint emperor at Aix-la-Chapelle in Jul 817, his primary status over his brothers being confirmed once more at the assembly of Nijmegen 1 May 821. In Nov 824, Emperor Louis placed Pope Eugene II under his protection, effectively subordinating the papal role to that of the emperor. The birth of his son Charles by his second marriage in 823 worsened relations with his sons by his first marriage, the tension being further increased when Emperor Louis invested Charles with Alemannia, Rhætia, Alsace and part of Burgundy at Worms in Aug 829, reducing the territory of his oldest son Lothaire to Italy. His older sons revolted in Mar 830 and captured their father at Compiègne, forcing him to revert to the 817 constitutional arrangements. However, Emperor Louis reasserted his authority at the assemblies of Nijmegen in Oct 830 and Aix-la-Chapelle in Feb 831, depriving Lothaire of the imperial title and relegating him once more to Italy. A further revolt of the brothers followed. Emperor Louis was defeated and deposed by his sons at Compiègne 1 Oct 833. He was exiled to the monastery of Saint-Médard de Soissons. His eldest son Lothaire declared himself sole emperor but was soon overthrown by his brothers Pépin and Louis, who freed their father. Emperor Louis was crowned once more at Metz 28 Feb 835. He proposed yet another partition of territories in favour of his son Charles at the assembly of Aix-la-Chapelle in 837, implemented at the assembly of Worms 28 May 839 when he installed his sons Lothaire and Charles jointly, setting aside the claims of his sons Pépin and Louis. This naturally led to revolts by Pépin in Aquitaine and Louis in Germany, which their father was in the process of suppressing when he died .

Einhard's Annales record that Emperor Louis chose \"Huelpi comitis filiam Judith\" as his wife in 819 after \"inspectis plerisque nobelium filiabus\" . Judith was influential with her husband, which increased the tensions with the emperor's sons by his first marriage. Thegan's Vita Hludowici Imperatoris records that \"quondam duce Bernhardo, qui erat de stirpe regali\" was accused of violating \"Iudith reginam\" but comments that this was all lies . Judith was exiled to the monastery of Sainte-Croix de Poitiers during the first rebellion of her stepsons in 830, was released in 831, but exiled again to Tortona in Italy in 833 from where she was brought back in Apr 834 .

Her marriage is deduced from a charter in which Gisela states that their eldest son Unruoch brought back the body of Eberhard from Italy . She founded the abbey of St Calixtus at Cysoing, Flanders, where she lived as a widow. \"Gisle\" granted \"le fisc de Somain en Ostrevant\" to \"filii Adelarde\" by charter dated 14 Apr 869, which names \"rex Karolus meus germanus senioris mei dulcis memorie Evrardi tres infantes meos Rodulfum et Berengarium et Adelarde\" .

Under the division of Imperial territories by the Treaty of Verdun 11 Aug 843, he became CHARLES II le Chauve King of the West Franks.\n\n- KINGS of the WEST FRANKS.\n\n9. [daughter . The Casus Monasterii Petrishusensis records that \"rex Francorum qui et imperator Romanorum\" (which appears to indicate Charles II \"le Chauve\") gave his sister in marriage to \"vir nobilissimo genere decoratus\", that the couple had two sons to whom their uncle gave \"in Alemannia loca Potamum et Brigantium, Ubirlingin et Buochorn, Ahihusin et Turingen atque Heistirgou, Wintirture et in Retia Curiensi Mesouch\", and that one of the sons returned to France while the other \"Oudalricus\" retained all the property in Alamannia . The editor of the MGH SS compilation dates this source to the mid-12th century . The information has not been corroborated in any earlier primary source, although it is not known what prior documentation may have been available to the compiler of the Casus. There are several other difficulties with this marriage which suggest that the report in the Casus should be treated with caution. If the information is accurate, it is likely that the bride was a full sister of King Charles, although if this is correct her absence from contemporary documentation is surprising. If she had been Charles's half-sister, it is difficult to see how Charles would have had much influence on her marriage, which would have been arranged by one of her full brothers. In any case, it is unlikely that Emperor Louis's first wife would have had further children after [812/15] at the latest, given the birth of her eldest son in 795. If that estimated birth date is correct, then it is more likely that this daughter's marriage would have been arranged by her father Emperor Louis before his death in 840. Another problem is the potential consanguinity between the parties. Although the precise relationship between the couple's son Udalrich [III] and the earlier Udalrichinger cannot be established from available documentation, it is probable that he was closely related to Hildegard, first wife of Emperor Charles I, who was the paternal grandmother of Emperor Louis's children. Lastly, Udalrich [III] is recorded in charters dated 847 and 854, suggesting a birth date in the 820s assuming that he was adult at the time, which is inconsistent with Charles II \"le Chauve\" (born in 823) having arranged his parents' marriage. m --- [Udalrichinger].]\n\nEmperor Louis I had [two] illegitimate children by Mistress (1):\n\n10. [ALPAIS ([793/94]-23 Jul 852 or after, bur [Reims]) . Flodoard refers to \"Ludowicus Alpheidi filie sue uxori Begonis comitis\" . The Annales Hildesheimenses name \"filiam imperatoris Elpheid\" as the wife of \"Bicgo de amici regis\" when recording the death of her husband . Settipani discusses the debate about the paternity of Alpais, preferring the theory that Emperor Charles I was her father . If Emperor Louis was her father, it is unlikely that she was born before [793/94], given his known birth date in 778. It would therefore be chronologically tight for her to have had [three] children by her husband before his death in 816. However, no indication has been found in primary sources of the age of these children when their father died. The question of Alpais's paternity is obviously not beyond doubt, but it is felt preferable to show her as the possible daughter of Emperor Louis in view of the clear statement in Flodoard. No indication has been found of the name of Alpais's mother. If Alpais was the daughter of Emperor Louis, it is likely that she was not her husband's only wife in view of Bego's estimated birth date. After her husband died, she became abbess of Saint-Pierre-les-Dames at Reims in [817]. She was still there 29 May 852. m ([806]) [as his second wife,] BEGO, son of --- (-28 Oct 816).

This triggered the revolt of his older half-brothers in Mar 830, when they captured their father at Compiègne and forced him to revert to the constitutional arrangements decided in 817. His father installed Charles as King of Aquitaine in Sep 832, having deprived Charles's half-brother Pépin. His father restored Aquitaine to Pépin 15 Mar 834 at Quierzy-sur-Oise. His father accorded Charles the land between Frisia and the Seine at the assembly of Aix-la-Chapelle in 837, Maine and the land between the Seine and the Loire (as well as a royal crown) in 838, and Francia between the Meuse and the Seine, western and southern Burgundy, Provence, Neustria, the march of Bretagne, Aquitaine, Gascony and Septimania at the assembly of Worms 28 May 839. On the death of his father, he became King of the Franks of the West. His brother Emperor Lothaire sought to deprive him of his lands. Charles allied himself with his half-brother Ludwig and together they defeated Lothaire at Fontenoy-en-Puisaye 25 Jun 841. Under the division of imperial territories agreed under the Treaty of Verdun 11 Aug 843, he became CHARLES II le Chauve King of the West Franks. King of Aquitaine in 848, when he deposed his nephew Pépin II. When King Charles II was faced with widespread rebellion, his brother Ludwig II \"der Deutsche\" King of the East Franks invaded his kingdom in Aug 858 but was defeated 15 Jan 859 in the Laonnais and forced to withdraw. In 865, Charles agreed with King Ludwig II the future division of the territories of Lothaire II King of Lotharingia, but on the latter's death in 869 Charles invaded Lotharingia and proclaimed himself CHARLES King of Lotharingia before Ludwig could assert his rights. A settlement was reached at Meerssen in Aug 870 under which Charles received the Meuse valley, Lyonnais, Viennois and Vivarais, declaring himself king of Lotharingia in 869. He was crowned Emperor CHARLES II at Rome 25 Dec 875 by Pope John VIII, and elected king of Italy at Pavia in 876 . The Annales S. Benigni Divisionensis record the death of \"Karolus imperator Prid Non Oct 877\" . The necrology of Reims Saint-Rémi records the death \"III Non Oct\" of \"Karolus Calvus rex Francorum\" .

Settipani names Rotrudis as the daughter of King Charles II but appears to base this on her being named as such in the Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis , but this does not appear to be the case. Flodoard names \"Rotrudi\" when recording her election as abbess of \"monasterii Sanctæ Crucis et Sanctæ Radegundis\" but does not give her parentage . Abbess of Sainte-Radégonde at Poitiers 868-870.]\n\nEmperor Charles II & his second wife had five children:\n\n10. ROTHILDIS ([871]-22 Mar 929) . Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks confirmed donations of property \"in comitatu quoque Cnomannico\" made by \"Hugo comes et mater sua Rothildis\", at the request of \"genitrix nostra Adeleidis et comes Hugo consanguineus, necnon et comes Ecfridus\" by charter dated 1 Nov 900 . The charter dated 929 subscribed by \"Hugonis comitis filii Rotgerii comitis\" suggests that Rothildis must have been the wife of Roger . Flodoard names \"Rothildis, amitæ suæ [regis Karoli], socrus autem Hugonis\" when recording that the king deprived her of \"abbatiam Golam\" [Chelles] in favour of his favourite Haganon, the context dictating that \"Hugonis\" was \"Hugo filius Rotberti\" . As the paternal aunt of King Charles III, chronology determines that she must have been the daughter of her father's second marriage, although no source has so far been identified which states this to be the case. She acquired the monasteries of Chelles, and Notre-Dame and Saint-Jean at Laon. She retreated to Chelles in 922 but was deprived of the monastery by her nephew Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks in favour of his favourite Haganon, an event which led to the rebellion of Robert Marquis en Neustrie who was the father of Rothildis's son-in-law (Hugues, later \"le Grand\" Duc des Francs) . Her death is dated to late 928/early 929 as Flodoard names \"Rothildis nuper defunctæ\" when recording that \"Heribertus et Hugo comites\" (specifying that \"Hugo\" was \"gener ipsius Rothildis\") attacked \"Bosonem Rodulfi regis frater\" in 929 over the property of Rothildis . This is also the only source so far identified from which her marriage is deduced. The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"XI Kal Apr\" of \"Rothildis abbatisse et monache filia regis magni Karoli\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"XI Kal Mar\" of \"Rotildis abbatissa\" . These entries could refer alternatively to Rothildis, daughter of Emperor Charlemagne, but it is more likely that the former entry would have referred to her father as \"imperator\" if that was the case. m ([890]) ROTGER [Roger] Comte, nephew of [HUGUES Comte de Bourges], son of --- (-before I Nov 900).

The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hludovicum Karolum Karlomannum et Hlotharium\" as the four sons of \"Karolus imperator ex Hyrmentrudi regina\" . His father awarded him the duchy of Mans and part of Neustria and arranged his betrothal in Feb 856, from which time he seems to have received the title king. He was expelled from Brittany after the rebellion which followed the murder of King Erispoé, and sought refuge with his father. He was suspected of having helped his sister Judith elope with Comte Baudouin and was obliged to flee in 861. He revolted against his father in 862, the revolt being instigated by the Rorgonid family . He was pardoned by his father, given the county of Meaux in 862, and entrusted with the governorship of the whole of Neustria with the title king in 865. The latter appointment was removed from him in the following year . His father invested him as Comte d'Autun in 866. He was installed as King of Aquitaine in Mar 867, following the death of his brother Charles . He succeeded his father in 877 as LOUIS II \"le Bègue\" King of the West Franks, and LUDWIG III King of West Lotharingia, crowned at Compiègne 8 Dec 877 and at Troyes 7 Sep 878 by Pope John VIII.

Her paternity is indicated by Wulfhard (who would have been the brother of Adelais) being named sororius of King Louis II . Her marriage was not recognised by the church which did not accept her husband's separation from his first wife. The Pope refused to crown her with her husband at Troyes 878, considering that she was not his legitimate wife . Her children were considered illegitimate by the church.\n\nKing Louis II & his first wife had four children:\n\n1.

He succeeded his father in 879 as LOUIS III King of the West Franks. This was challenged by Ludwig III King of the East Franks, who withdrew after receiving compensation . He was crowned with his brother Carloman in Sep 879 at the Abbaye de Ferrières-en-Gâtinais. Ludwig III recognised his cousins' sovereignty by the Treaty of Ribemont in Feb 880. Louis III and Carloman agreed a division of their territories at Amiens in Mar 880, Louis receiving the northern part of the kingdom, Francia and Neustria. He fell from his horse at Tours, dying soon afterwards . The Obituaire de Notre-Dame de Paris records the death \"Non Aug\" of \"Ludovicus rex Francie\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"Non Aug\" of \"Ludovici regis\" .\n\n2. GISELA (-[11 Apr 879/12 Dec 884]) . King Carloman donated property \"in comitatu Trecassino, in curtem Argenteam mansum unum, de Clariaco \" to Montièramey, at the request of \"fidelis noster Rotbertus comes\", for the soul of \"Gislæ sororis nostræ eiusque uxoris\", by charter dated to [11 Apr 879/12 Dec 884], the original of which is lost . Gisela was the daughter of King Louis's first marriage according to Rösch . Jackman maintains that she must have been the daughter of his second marriage to avoid her being the first cousin of her husband, although this would mean that she was a child bride. However, he is presumably assuming co-identity between Eudes, brother of Ansgardis, and Eudes Comte de Troyes, father of Comte Robert, which does not appear to be correct. m ROBERT Comte Palatin de Troyes, son of EUDES Comte de Châteaudun, later Comte de Troyes & his wife Wandilmodis --- (-killed in battle Troyes Feb 886).\n\n3. CARLOMAN ([866/68]-killed accidentally Bézu-la-Forêt, near Andelys, Eure 6 Dec 884, bur église de l'abbaye royale de Saint-Denis) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hludovicum et Karlomannum et Hildegardim\" as the children of \"Hlodovicus rex ex Ansgardi vocata regina\" . He was crowned with his brother Louis III in Sep 879 at the Abbaye de Ferrières-en-Gâtinais. Louis III and Carloman agreed a division of their territories at Amiens in Mar 880, Carloman receiving the southern part of the kingdom, Aquitaine and Burgundy . Carlomannus Rex restored property villam Taniacum to the church of Autun, at the request of Richardi Comiti Augustodensis, by charter dated 1 Dec 880, the text ending with Theodoricus Comes ambasciavit . He succeeded his brother in 882 as CARLOMAN King of the West Franks. On his death, Emperor Charles III \"le Gros\" was proclaimed King of the West Franks. The Annales Vedastini record that \"rex in Basiu silva\" was injured in the leg by \"quidam a suis, Bertoldus\" while hunting in 884, and died in the same place seven days later \"Id Dec\" aged about 18, and was buried \"in monasterium sancti Dionysii\" . The Annales S. Benigni Divisionensis record the death \"Non Dec 884\" of \"Karlomannus rex\" . The necrology of Argenteuil Priory records the death \"VIII Id Dec\" of \"Karlomannus rex\" . Betrothed (11 Sep 878) to [ENGELBERGA], daughter of BOSO Comte de Vienne [later King] & his wife Ermengardis of Italy. The Annales Bertiniani record the betrothal in 878 of \"filiam Bosonis\" and \"Karlomanno filio suo [=Hlodowici rex]\" . It is assumed that this daughter was Engelberga, who was an infant at the time, but no proof has been found which confirms that this is the case. \"Bosonis\" could refer either to the future King Boson or to Count Boson, husband of the adulterous Engiltrudis. While Boson of Provence had refused to swear allegiance to Louis II \"le Bègue\" King of the West Franks (\"Hlodowici rex\") on the latter's accession, it is not known whether he was still in rebellion the following year. Assuming that some reconciliation had taken place, a marriage alliance between the two parties would have been a likely possibility. The other Count Boson was presumably of less political importance and, in addition, his problems with his adulterous wife may have rendered his daughters unmarriageable at the time.\n\n4. HILDEGARD (-after 896).

ERMENTRUD ([875/78] -). The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Karolum quoque postumum et Irmintrudim\" as children of \"Hlodovicus rex ex Adelheidi regina\" . According to Settipani, Ermentrudis was the daughter of King Louis by his first marriage , although he cites no primary source on which this is based. It is certainly correct that the chronology is tight for Ermentrud to have been the daughter of her father's second marriage, assuming that the affiliation of her supposed daughter Kunegund is correct as shown here. m ---. Nothing is known about the husband of Ermentrud. Ermentrud & her husband had one child:\n\na) CUNIGONDE ([895]-after [930/40]) . Her parentage and first marriage are indicated by the charter dated to [915] under which Charles III le Simple King of the West Franks donated the abbeys of Hastières and Saint-Rombaut to Liège Saint-Lambert, granting the enjoyment for life to \"comes Windricus...uxoris eius...Cunegundis et unius filiorum ipsorum...nostri nepotis Adelberonis\" . Her first and second marriages are confirmed by the Vita Iohannis Gorziensis which names \"episcopo Adalberone\" (her son by her first husband) and \"vitrico eius Richizone\" (her second husband) . Her parentage is confirmed more specifically because the mother of Siegfried Count of Luxembourg is named \"Cynigund\", daughter of \"Irmindrud\" daughter of Louis II \"le Bègue\" King of the West Franks, in an 11th century genealogy which traces the ancestry of Siegfried's daughter Empress Kunigund .

The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Karolum quoque postumum et Irmintrudim\" as children of \"Hlodovicus rex ex Adelheidi regina\" . His parentage is also given in the Annalista Saxo . Regino specifies that he was born posthumously . On the death of King Louis II, Emperor Charles III \"le Gros\" was elected King of the West Franks, and on the latter's death in 888, Eudes [Capet] was elected king. Louis II's son, Charles, sought refuge with Ramnulf II Comte de Poitou . Regino names \"Folcone episcopo, Heriberto et Pippino comitibus in Remorum civitate\" when recording that they supported the accession of Charles as king in 892 in opposition to King Eudes . Supported by Foucher Archbishop of Reims, he was crowned 28 Jan 893 at Reims as CHARLES III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks, as anti-king to Eudes, who later agreed to appoint him as his successor and whom he succeeded from 1 Jan 898. The early years of his reign appear to have been dominated by Viking raids in the north which led to the treaty with Rollo in 911 and the grant of territory in the future duchy of Normandy. He was chosen as CHARLES King of Lotharingia 1 Nov 911, in succession to Ludwig IV \"das Kind\" King of the East Franks and Lotharingia, representing a significant extension of the royal domain. He used the title \"King of the Franks/rex francorum\", and later \"King of France/rex franciæ\". He captured Alsace early in 912, and fought the army of Konrad I King of Germany three times in Lotharingia . From [920], he fell under the influence of Haganon, a Lotharingian described in a charter of 921 as his cousin on his mother's side . This triggered the revolt of Robert Marquis en Neustrie [Capet] and other nobles during which King Charles was obliged to seek refuge with Hérivé Archbishop of Reims. Although the king was restored after seven months, tension continued and Charles's award of the monastery of Chelles to Haganon in 922 triggered another revolt which led to the king's deposition 30 Jun 922 in favour of Robert, who was elected as Robert I King of France. Ex-king Charles fled to Lotharingia. All these events are recorded by Flodoard . He returned, but was defeated at Soissons 15 Jun 923, although King Robert was killed in the battle: Flodoard records in 923 that \"Karolus cum suis Lothariensibus\" crossed Mosam...ad Atiniacum...et...super Axonam where he lost the battle near Soissons in which Rotbertus...rex was killed . Raoul de Bourgogne was elected king of France 13 Jul 923. Ex-king Charles was tricked into capture by Héribert II Comte de Vermandois and imprisoned at Château-Thierry: Flodoard records in 923 that \"Heribertus comes\" sent Bernardum consobrinum suum with a delegation ad Karolum who was in castello suo super Somnam apud Sanctum Quintinum, and who was detained in...munitionem suam...Castellum Theoderici super Maternam fluvium . He was transferred in 924 to the château de Péronne, where he remained captive for the rest of his life . He was briefly declared king once more in 927 by Comte Héribert during the latter's unsuccessful attempt to capture Laon . According to Thietmar of Merseburg, Heinrich I King of Germany secured his release from prison and in return was rewarded with \"the right hand of St Denis and the entire kingdom of the Lotharingians\" .\n\nm firstly ([1/18] Apr 907) FREDERUNA, sister of BOVO [II] Bishop of Châlons, daughter of --- (-10 Feb 917, bur Reims, église abbatiale de Saint-Rémi).

Nothing definite is known about the origins of Bovo, although Flodoard refers to \"Berengario Transrhenensi clerico\" as \"nepoti Bovonis Catalaunensis quondam episcopi\" when recording his appointment as Bishop of Cambrai in 956 . McKitterick assumes that Frederuna was of Lotharingian origin . Settipani speculates that Queen Frederuna was probably a close relation of Mathilde, second wife of Heinrich I King of Germany . This could be explained if Mathilde's mother, Reginlind, was Queen Frederuna's sister, as hypothesised in the document REIMS. The charter of \"Karolus rex\" dated \"918 IV Id Feb\" refers to the death of \"nostræ coniugis Friderunæ\" , and the charter dated \"918 II Id Mar\" that she had died \"IV Id Feb\" . The necrology of Reims Saint-Rémi records the death \"IV Id Feb\" of \"Frederuna regina\" .\n\nm secondly ([917/19]) as her first husband, EADGIFU, daughter of EDWARD I \"the Elder\" King of England & his second wife Ælfleda ([902/05]-after 951, bur église Saint-Médard de Soissons). The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names \"Otgiva\" wife of \"Karolus rex\" after the death of \"Frederuna regina\" . She fled with her two-year-old son to England in 923 after her husband was deposed, returning to France in 936 after the death of King Raoul. Abbess of Notre-Dame de Laon, this was taken from her 951 by her son on her second marriage. She married secondly (951) Héribert [III] Comte \"le Vieux\" [de Vermandois] (-980/84). Flodoard records in 951 that Ottogeba regina mater Ludowici regis married Heriberti...Adalberti fratris and that rex Ludowicus iratus confiscated abbatiam sanctæ Mariæ...Lauduni from her and donated it to Gerbergæ uxori suæ .\n\nMistresses: ---. The names of King Charles III's mistresses are not known.\n\nKing Charles III & his first wife had six children :\n\n1. ERMENTRUDE ([908/16]-) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hyrmintrudim, Frederunam, Adelheidim, Gislam, Rotrudim et Hildegardim\" as the children of \"Karolus rex ex Frederuna regina\" . Hlawitschka suggests that Ermentrude, daughter of King Charles III, was the wife of Gottffied Graf im Jülichgau. This appears to be based on the combined reading of four strings of entries in the Liber Memorialis of Remiremont: (1) \"Dumnus Gislibertus dux Dumna Girberga, Ainricus, Haduidis \", which is followed by (2) \"Gottefridus comes cum infantibus suis, Ermentridis comitissa\" ; (3) \"Gotefridus, Ermendrudis, Gotefridus, Gebardus, Gerardus, Adelardus, Girberga\" assumed to be Gottfried, his wife, four sons and daughter , and (4) \" Caroli imperatoris Hludowici imperatoris, Hlotarii, Caroli, Ermentrudis\" , which may represent an abbreviated attempt to set out the ancestry of Ermentrude wife of Graf Gottfried. However, the connection between entries (1) to (3) and entry (4) appears to be speculation. [m (before [934]) GOTTFRIED Graf im Jülichgau, son of Graf GERHARD [Matfride] & his wife Oda [Ottonen] (-26 Mar after 949).]\n\n2. FREDERUNA ([908/16]-). The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hyrmintrudim, Frederunam, Adelheidim, Gislam, Rotrudim et Hildegardim\" as the children of \"Karolus rex ex Frederuna regina\" .\n\n3. ADELAIS ([908/16]-) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hyrmintrudim, Frederunam, Adelheidim, Gislam, Rotrudim et Hildegardim\" as the children of \"Karolus rex ex Frederuna regina\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records that \"comes Rodulfus\" (referring to Raoul [II]) was \"nepos ex sorore\" of Louis IV King of France . It appears chronologically unlikely for any of King Louis's sisters, whose dates of birth can be estimated to [908/17], to have been the mother of Raoul [II] who was killed in battle in 944, presumably when he was already adult. It appears more likely that the family relationship was one generation further back, and that a member of the Unruochingi family, descended from the sister of Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks and who originated in the same area in northern France, would provide a good match. Nevertheless, the earlier primary source on which Alberic based his information has not yet been identified and it is possible that the source is inaccurate in its report. However, the poem Raoul de Cambrai states that \"Raoul Taillefer\" married \"Aalais\", sister of King Louis IV which, if correct, would mean that his wife could be identified with Adelais, daughter of Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks by his first marriage. This would mean that Raoul [II] was an infant when his father died. It would also mean that Raoul [I] and his wife were closely related, as the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines also implies that Raoul's mother was the daughter of Adelais's paternal great aunt Gisela who married Eberhard, ancestor of the Marchesi of Friulia. The poem Raoul de Cambrai cannot claim to be historically accurate. Nevertheless, it is not impossible that the detail of Raoul's marriage was not fabricated. [m [920/24]) RAOUL [I] Comte de Gouy, son of HUCBERT Comte [d'Ostrevent] & his wife Heilwig [of Friulia] (-926).]\n\n4. GISELA ([908/16]-) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hyrmintrudim, Frederunam, Adelheidim, Gislam, Rotrudim et Hildegardim\" as the children of \"Karolus rex ex Frederuna regina\" . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks granted \"terram maritimam ab Eptæ flumine usque ad Britannicos limites\" together with \"sua filia...Gisla\" to Rollo who renounced his campaigns, in a later passage their marriage, and in a subsequent chapter the fact that she died childless . Her marriage is recorded in the Norman annals for 912, which state that she died without issue, presumably soon after the marriage when Gisela must still have been an infant. The chronicle of Dudo of Saint-Quentin describes her as of \"tall stature, most elegant \", which is of course inconsistent with her supposed birth date range. The Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum records the marriage of \"filiam suam [=rex Karolus] nomine Gillam\" to \"Rollo\" . Settipani considers that the marriage did not occur, and that the Norman sources confused it with the marriage of Gisela, daughter of Lothaire II King of Lotharingia, to the Viking leader Gotfrid . m ([912]) as his third wife, ROLLO of Normandy, later known as ROBERT I Comte [de Normandie], son of [RAGNVALD \"the Wise\" Jarl of Möre in Norway & his wife Ragnhild] ([846]-[928]).\n\n5.

LOUIS ([10 Sep 920/10 Sep 921]-Reims 10 Sep 954, bur Reims, Abbaye de Saint-Rémi) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names \"Hludovicum\" as son of \"Karolus rex [ex] Otgivam\" . He succeeded in 936 as LOUIS IV \"dOutremer\" King of the Franks.\n\n- see below.\n\nKing Charles III had illegitimate children by his Mistresses.\n\n8.ARNULF. The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Arnulfum, Drogonem, Roriconem et Alpaidem\" as the children of \"Karolus rex ex concubina\" .\n\n9.DROGO. The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Arnulfum, Drogonem, Roriconem et Alpaidem\" as the children of \"Karolus rex ex concubina\" .\n\n10.RORICO (-20 Dec 976, bur Laon Saint-Vincent) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Arnulfum, Drogonem, Roriconem et Alpaidem\" as the children of \"Karolus rex ex concubina\" . Elected Bishop of Laon 949. Flodoard records in 949 that Laudunenses...sibi elected præsulem Roriconem diaconem [Ludowici] regis fratrem and that he was consecrated by Artaud Archbishop of Reims . Flodoard (Continuator) records in 976 the death XIII Kal Jan of præsul Rorico...Laudunensis æcclesiæ, qui erat langore paralisi correptus .\n\n11.ALPAIS . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Arnulfum, Drogonem, Roriconem et Alpaidem\" as the children of \"Karolus rex ex concubina\" . same person as ? ALPAIS . \"Erleboldus et uxor mea Alpaidis\" founded the monastery of Salles \"in pago Haynau in loco Macons\" by charter dated 8 Sep 887 which names \"filius noster Wiermiundus\" . Secondary sources suggest that she was the wife of Erlebold was the illegitimate daughter of Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks, but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. If it is correct, the 887 charter quoted above must be misdated (assuming that it is genuine). m ERLEBOLD Comte de Castres, son of --- (-killed in battle 921). He possessed territories in pagus Lommensis (near Namur), pagus Castricensis (near Mézières), Charpaigne, and probably also the Saulnois (near Metz) .\n\nLOUIS, son of CHARLES III \"le Simple\" King of the Franks & his second wife Eadgifu of England ([10 Sep 920/10 Sep 921]-Reims 10 Sep 954, bur Reims, Abbaye de Saint-Rémi) . Rodulfus Glaber names \"Ludowicum filium regis Caroli\" . After his father was deposed in 923, his mother fled with Louis to England where he was brought up at the court of Æthelstan King of Wessex. His return to France after the death of King Raoul in early 936 was negotiated by Hugues \"le Grand\" [Capet]. He was crowned 19 Jun 936 at Laon by the Archbishop of Reims as LOUIS IV \"dOutremer\" King of the Franks. He asserted his autonomy from Hugues \"le Grand\", to whom he awarded the title dux francorum, by establishing himself with his mother at Laon in 937 . His reign was characterised by constant disputes with his nobles, in particular Hugues \"le Grand\", Héribert II Comte de Vermandois, Arnoul Count of Flanders and Guillaume \"Longuespée\" Comte [de Normandie]. Despite constant military activity, he only increased the territory directly held by the kings of France by the counties of Laon (captured in 938 from Héribert II Comte de Vermandois) and Reims. He also temporarily held Amiens and Ponthieu. Following a revolt in Lotharingia against Otto I \"der Große\" King of Germany, Louis was offered the crown of Lotharingia in 939 by Duke Giselbert. King Otto responded by raiding Frankish territory, allying himself with Hugues \"le Grand\", Héribert II Comte de Vermandois, Arnoul I Count of Flanders and Guillaume \"Longuespée\" Comte [de Normandie], and obliged King Louis to renounce Lotharingia. Héribert and Hugues besieged Reims, forcing the restoration of Héribert's son as archbishop, and besieged King Louis at Laon. After the murder of Guillaume \"Longuespée\" Comte [de Normandie], King Louis detained Richard his heir, but was held captive himself by the people of Rouen after Richard escaped. King Otto launched a revenge attack, but was defeated by the Normans. After Louis was released by Hugues \"le Grand\", he was transferred to the custody of Thibaut Comte de Blois who held him captive for a year in 945/46 . King Louis died after falling from his horse on his way from Reims to Laon .\n\nm (end 939) as her second husband, GERBERGA of Germany, widow of GISELBERT Graf [im Maasgau] Duke of Lotharingia, daughter of HEINRICH I King of Germany & his second wife Mathilde von Ringelheim [Immedinger] (Nordhausen [913/14]-Reims 5 May 984, bur Abbaye de Reims). Liutprand states that the wife of \"Gislebertum Lotharingorum ducem\" was \"regis sororem\" . Flodoard names her \"Gerbergam\" when recording her second marriage . King Louis married her without the permission of her brother Otto I King of Germany, presumably to increase his hold on Lotharingia (which had been ruled by her first husband). She was active in the defence of Laon in 941 and of Reims in 946, accompanied her husband on expeditions to Aquitaine in 944 and Burgundy in 949, and was active during his period of imprisonment in 945/46 . An educated person, she commissioned from Adso of Moutier-en-Der the De ortu et tempore antichristi .

LOTHAIRE (Laon end-941-Laon 2 Mar 986, bur Reims Saint-Rémi) . The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hlotharium Karolum Ludovicum et Mathildim\" as children of \"Hludovicum ex regina Gerberga\" .

The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hlotharium Karolum Ludovicum et Mathildim\" as children of \"Hludovicum ex regina Gerberga\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records the marriage of \"rex Francorum Lotharius sororem suam Mathildem\" and \"Conradus rex Burgundie\" . \"Mathilde et Alberada\" are named as daughters of \"Gerberga\" in the Continuator of Flodoard, which specifies that Mathilde was mother of \"Rodulfus rex et Mathildis soror eius\" . Her brother King Lothaire arranged this marriage to strengthen his position in south-eastern France. Her dowry consisted of the counties of Lyon and Vienne . m ([964]) as his second wife, CONRAD I \"le Pacifique\" King of Burgundy [Welf], son of RUDOLF II King of Upper Burgundy & his wife Berta of Swabia ([922/25]-Vienne 19 Oct 993, bur Vienne, cathédrale Saint-Maurice).\n\n3. CHARLES (Laon Jan 945-Rouen before 953). The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hlotharium Karolum Ludovicum et Mathildim\" as children of \"Hludovicum ex regina Gerberga\" , \"Karolum\" presumably being the older son of that name as indicated by the order, who presumably died after 951 which is the earliest date of the range during which the Genealogia was compiled . Guillaume de Jumièges records that a son of King Louis was given as hostage to the Normans in 945 to secure the release of his father , although it is not known whether this son was Charles who would have been a baby at the time, normally too young to have been used as a hostage according to then current practice.\n\n4. daughter ([947/early 948]-). Flodoard records that \"Chonradus dux\" baptised \"filiam Ludowici regis\" in the middle of his passage dealing with 948 . She must have been born in the previous year, or very early in the same year, if the timing of the birth of King Louis's son Louis is correctly dated to the end of 948.\n\n5. LOUIS ([Dec] 948-Laon 954 before 10 Sep). The Genealogica Arnulfi Comitis names (in order) \"Hlotharium Karolum Ludovicum et Mathildim\" children of \"Hludovicum ex regina Gerberga\" .

He was elected to succeed his father 12 Nov 954 as LOTHAIRE King of the Franks, and was crowned at Reims immediately. He ruled through the regency of Hugues \"le Grand\" until 956, and that of his maternal uncle Bruno Archbishop of Köln until 965. Thereafter Hugues \"Capet\" became the real ruler throughout the remainder of Lothaire's reign . King Lothaire fought lengthy campaigns to recapture Lotharingia. In 978, he captured Aachen, but Emperor Otto II pursued him and besieged Paris in Sep 978 although he retreated in November . King Lothaire and King Otto made peace at Margut in Jun 980, the former renouncing his claim to Lotharingia . However, after Emperor Otto died in 983, King Lothaire renewed his efforts against Lotharingia, conquered Verdun and captured Thierry Duke of Upper Lotharingia. He died while preparing another offensive against Liège and Cambrai . The Historia Francorum Senonensis records the death in 956 of \"Hlotharius rex\" and his burial \"in basilica beati Remigii Remis\" .
