        "text": "Lives in the Yiddish Theatre\n\nThe Fischer Family\n\nWarszawa, Poland\n\nbefore World War II\n\nLiza Barska Fischer\n\n\"My grandparents Liza Barska and Herman Fischer and their three children were very active in the Yiddish theatre in pre-war Warsaw. My father Boris, or Bruce as he was known in the United States, was one of their children. He was the only member of the family not to appear on stage. He managed to immigrate to the United States in September 1938, barely escaping the fate that befell many Jews not long after.\n\nMy father's parents, along with his sisters Luba and Anka, all perished in the Holocaust. Herman and Liza met in Odessa while Herman was there on tour with the United Troupe, the first Yiddish troupe of Warsaw. They married a short time later and then moved to Warsaw where they made a name for themselves in the Yiddish theatre. Herman was a director of Yiddish plays, and Liza was a character actress. Herman was also one of the founders of the Hebrew Actors Union in Warsaw.\n\nTheir daughters Anka and Luba also acted in Yiddish theatre. Luba, who was married to the famous Polish actor Jacek Woszczerowicz, also appeared in films using the name Eliza Fischer or Luba Ditris. Anka, also known as Anna, appeared as a singer of American jazz songs in a Warsaw cafe in 1941, where just three days before, Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man whose story was told in the movie \"The Pianist\" had performed. My father Bruce didn't talk very often about his family because of the overwhelming sadness it brought. I always wished they too could have immigrated and had the opportunity to live their extraordinary lives here in the United States. I would love to have known them, spend time with them, surrounded by their love, and to listen to them tell stories about their experiences in Poland and the Yiddish theatre of Warsaw.\"\n\nnext, Luba Fischer ►►\n\nListen to the above text as told by Connie, Liza and Herman's granddaughter."
