        "text": "Friedrich I Barbarossa (1122 – June 10, 1190), was the Holy Roman Emperor from January 2, 1155 until his death. He was elected King of the Germans at Frankfurt on March 4, 1152 and crowned in Aachen on March 9, 1152. He was crowned King of Italy on April 24, 1155 in Pavia and emperor by Pope Adrian IV on June 18, 1155 in Rome. Two years later, the term sacrum (“holy”) first appeared in a document in connection with his empire. He was later formally crowned King of Burgundy, at Arles on June 30, 1178. He was named Barbarossa by the northern Italian cities which he attempted to rule: Barbarossa means “red beard” in Italian; in German, he was known as Kaiser Rotbart, which has the same meaning.\n\nFriedrich I Barbarossa\n\nBefore his imperial election, he was by inheritance Friedrich III, Duke of Swabia (1147–1152). He was the son of Duke Friedrich II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and Judith, daughter of Heinrich IX, Duke of Bavaria, from the rival House of Guelph. Friedrich, therefore, descended from the two leading families in Germany, making him an acceptable choice for the Empire’s prince-electors.\n\nFriedrich’s first wife Adelaide was a daughter of the Bavarian margrave Diepold III of Vohburg (c. 1079 – 1146), probably from his first marriage with Adelaide (c. 1091 – 1127), a daughter of the Polish duke Władysław I Herman and Judith of Swabia. Since the days of Emperor Heinrich IV, her father’s ancestors ruled over the Egerland territory in the Bavarian March of the Nordgau, which, however, was seized by King Conrad III of Germany upon the margrave’s death in 1146.\n\nAdelaide and Friedrich’s marriage was not successful, however. According to some later sources, this was because Adelaide committed adultery. The couple remained childless. In 1153 Friedrich petitioned Pope Eugene III for an annulment. The separation was granted and confirmed by the Bishop of Constance in March 1153; the justification given on grounds of consanguinity. Friedrich immediately began to court the Byzantine princess Maria Komnena, though to no avail. Maria was the youngest child of Isaac Komnenos, son of John II Komnenos and elder brother of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and Isaacʻs first wife, Theodora, great-granddaughter of King Ladislaus I of Hungary.\n\nCoat of Arms of the Holy Roman Empire\n\nFriedrich’s second wife was Beatrice I (1143 – 15 November 1184) the only surviving child of Renaud III, Count of Burgundy and Agatha of Lorraine. As the only child of her father, she was the heir of the County of Burgundy. At the death of her father in 1148, she inherited the vast County of Burgundy and became countess palatine in her own right. As such, she was one of the most desired brides in France, and a marriage was suggested to Emperor Frederick I.\n\nThe wedding between Beatrice and Friedrich took on June 9, 1156 at Würzburg. After the wedding, the Bishop of Trier anointed Beatrice queen. She was crowned empress by Antipope Paschal III in Rome on August 1, 1167, and as Queen of Burgundy at Vienne in August 1178.\n\nHoly Roman Empire during the reign of Friedrich I Barbarossa\n\nThe relationship between Beatrice and Friedrich is traditionally described as happy, and there is nothing to indicate that he was ever unfaithful to her. Though Beatrice was rumored to be greatly loved by Friedrich and thereby attributed influence over him in the sense that he had great affection for her, there is nothing to indicate that she acted as his political adviser and she is confirmed to be directly involved in a major political affair only once. In 1168 supported the election of bishop Peter of Cambrai and at successfully blocked the attempt of the archbishop Philip to transfer the bishopric of Cambrai from the metropolitan province of Riems to Cologne, supported by archbishop Christian of Mainz and Heinrich III-IV the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, this was reputedly the only case Beatrice took decisive action in a major political affair.\n\nThe couple had 11 children including Heinrich VI, Holy Roman Emperor, (1165 – 1197)\n\nHistorians consider him among the Holy Roman Empire’s greatest medieval emperors. He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen and his political perspicacity. His contributions to Central European society and culture include the reestablishment of the Corpus Juris Civilis, or the Roman rule of law, which counterbalanced the papal power that dominated the German states since the conclusion of the Investiture Controversy.\n\nFriedrich fought in the Third Crusade and on June 10, 1190, Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa drowned near Silifke Castle in the Saleph river. There are several conflicting accounts of the event. According to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir, Friedrich was thrown from his horse and the shock of the cold water caused him to have a heart attack. Weighed down by his armour, he drowned."
