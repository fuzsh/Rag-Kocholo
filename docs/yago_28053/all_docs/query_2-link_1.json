He became king after his brother Boleslaw II the Brave was exiled after a rebellion by nobles, and he was succeeded by his son Zbigniew.\n\nBiography[]\n\nWladyslaw was the second son of King Casimir I the Restorer of Poland and his wife Maria Dobroniega of Kiev. While he was in his thirties, Poland fell into a crisis in which the nobles revolted against King Boleslaw. Only in 1080 was order truly being restored with Wladyslaw Herman taking the throne with his brother being forced into exile. Siding with the Pope in his recent clashes with the Kaiser had helped establish Poland as a legitimate Catholic power, ensuring the Reich could no longer expand eastward with the blessing of Christendom."
