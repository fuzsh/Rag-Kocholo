His appointment as duke marked the return of Conradian rule over Swabia for the first time since 948.[2]\n\nFrom Wikipedia:[2]\n\nThere is considerable confusion about Conrad and his family. He is often identified with Cuno of Öhningen. The identities of his parents are not known for certain. His father is sometimes said to be Count Udo from the Wetterau, and his mother an unknown daughter of Herbert I, Count of Vermandois.\n\nWhen Duke Otto I unexpectedly died during the Imperial campaign in Italy of 981-982, he left no heirs. To fill the vacancy, Emperor Otto II (who may have been Conrad's brother-in-law) appointed Conrad as Duke of Swabia. Conrad is notable for being the first Swabian duke to keep the title in the family; after his death in 997 he was succeeded by his son Hermann II.\n\nUncertain Wife\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the identity of his wife is debated as either Judith, daughter of Adalbert of Marchtal or Reglint (or Richlind), daughter of Liudolf, Duke of Swabia.[2]\n\nAccording to Medlands, his wife is either Richlind, daughter of Emperor Otto I King of Germany & his second wife Adelais of Burgundy or the daughter of Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, son of Emperor Otto I.[1]\n\nChildren\n\nWith his wife, Conrad had at least six children, including:\n\nHermann II, who succeeded his father,[2] died 2/3 May 1003, married Gerberga of Burgundy, widow of Hermann Graf von Werl, daughter of Conrad I \"le Pacifique\" King of Burgundy [Welf] & his second wife Mathilde de France [Carolingian]; had issue[1]\n\npossibly Ekbert[1]\n\npossibly Liutpold[1]\n\npossibly Liutold[1][2]\n\npossibly C/Konrad[1][2]\n\npossibly Ita, married Rudolf II, Count of Altdorf[2]\n\nan unnamed daughter/perhaps Adelia, married Vladimir the Great[1][2]\n\nunknown (possibly Judith), married (1) an unnamed husband from Rheinfelden,[1] and (2) Adalbert II, Count of Metz (died 1033)[2]\n\nKunigarde/Kunizza \"Hemma\", died 6 Mar 1020, married Friedrich I, probably count of Dießen[1][2]\n\nResearch Note\n\nUnsourced/uncertain parents Eberhard II Lahngau and Judith Vermandois were detached 4 March 2021 until adequate sourcing is found.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nThis family is a complete mess. The death date \"20 AUG\" appears to correspond with Konrad von Öhningen, Duke of Swabia (therefore a duplicate of Schwaben-31), of unknown or very uncertain parentage. Conrad died Aug 20, 997.
