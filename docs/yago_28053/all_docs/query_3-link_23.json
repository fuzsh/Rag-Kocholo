        "meta_description": "Through the colorful family histories and rich detail of the Zimmern Chronicle, historian Judith Hurwich examines marriage, family, and sexuality among the early modern German nobility. She uses the house chronicles of the Zimmern family and the families of the counts and barons with whom they intermarried to investigate marriage and nonmarital sexuality in the southwest German nobility in the late fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries. Along with a deeper look at womenâs roles as wives, mothers, and concubines, Noble Strategies shines a light on the intimate lives of the early modern German elite.",
