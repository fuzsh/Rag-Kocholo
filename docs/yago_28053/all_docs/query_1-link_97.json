Yet, there is one aspect of the movement which has not as yet received equal scrutiny with the others, namely, the relation of the Gregorian Reform to the Slavic countries. L\n\nJ\n\n‘For, converted to Christianity in the tenth century, these”1 lands had definitely come within the ecclesiastical frame­ work at the time of the great struggle between Gregory VII and the German emperor, Kenry IV, in the West.\n\nThe ques­\n\ntion, therefore, arises whether the powerful forces, %hich reached full expression within the Church in the pontifi­ cate of Gregory VII, were confined to Western Europe or whether they reached beyond the eastern boundaries of Ger­ many*\n\nA further question also presents itself: did any\n\nactions taken by the Slav rulers influence in any way the struggles between the Empire and the Papacy, and in their turn, did these struggles exert any influence on the Slav peoples?\n\nUnfortunately, in Peeking the answers to these\n\nquestions, a thorough examination of the problem is handi­ capped by a relative lack of source material as compared to the western phase of the movement. Among these Slavic peoples the largest nation was that of the Poles.\n\nHere, during the period of Gregory’s\n\npapal reign three outstanding events occurred: first, the great reform Pope dispatched a letter to the Polish duke, Boleslaw II; secondly, the duke had himself crowned king of Poland in 1076; and thirdly, the bishop of Cracow, St. Stanislaw, was put to death by the hand of Boleslaw II. These three seemingly unrelated occurrences form the basis for our treatment of Poland’s place in the reform movement, for they reveal that country’s relation to the Papacy and\n\n3\n\nr the Empire, the two powerful antagonists in the bitter\n\nn\n\nstruggle for reform. However, to evaluate properly the part played by Poland in the Gregorian period, it becomes necessary to consider that country’s development as a state from the time when it entered the stage of European polity.\n\nFor in\n\nPoland's national development both Germany and the Papacy played an important role, so that when both these powers clashed during the pontificate of Gregory VII, the Polish people had to make a choice.\n\nIn consequence, the Polish\n\nking, Boleslaw II, turned to the support of the Apostolic See and profited from the occasion to further the inter­ ests of his country in the face of German power.\n\nHe broke\n\noff all vassal dependence on the German emperor and had himself crowned king with papal approbation, the first Polish ruler to receive such favor.\n\nHis defiant action\n\nagainst Henry IV added another fissure to the crumbling foundations of the German state and contributed to the young emperor's decision to seek Gregory VII's pardon at Canossa. To understand fully why Poland decided to adhere to the papal rather than to the imperial cause as her Slavic neighbor Bohemia did, will be made clear by a study of Poland's relation to Germany and to the Holy See prior to the reform period.\n\nThis study will similarly present\n\nthe influx of reform ideas into Poland in order that the L\n\nJ\n\n4\n\nr\n\n“I\n\nclerical reaction to the reform decrees can be properly appreciated.\n\nThus, a detailed investigation will be made\n\nof the political and religious relations of Poland both to Germany and to the Papacy.\n\nHaving laid this groundwork,\n\nwe shall be in a position to determine the significance of Gregory VII’s letter to the Polish duke Boleslaw and the letter’s formal coronation as king of Poland.\n\nTo deter­\n\nmine the extent of the Gregorian reform in the religious life of Poland, we shall then discuss that third outstand­ ing event in king Boleslaw1s reign, namely, the death of St.. Stanislaw, bishop of Cracow. Although this outline of the subject appears simple in application, many difficulties arise in its execution.\n\nAs already stated, the primary obstacle is\n\nthe comparative dearth of source material as compared to other countries; moreover, the sources that are available, show a notable lack of harmony, no major event in Polish history It-being in complete accord among the chroniclers and annalists, a circumstance tdiihh has given rise to much controversy among students of Poland’s history.\n\nThrough­\n\nout, therefore, it becomes necessary to select the most trustworthy or most probable account.\n\nMost controversy\n\nrevolves around the death of St. Stanislaw, of which two of our earliest chronicles give completely different versions.\n\nThe first, by Gallus, in a vague passage, im­\n\nplies that Stanislaw suffered death for conspiracy with L\n\nJ\n\n£\n\nr*\n\nthe Czechs against king Boleslaw II*\n\nKadlubek, on the\n\n\"i\n\nother hand, presents Stanislaw as a holy bishop whose cen­ sure of the Polish king Vs evil deeds brought upon himself the royal anger and finally death,\n\nThese variant accounts\n\nhave given rise to two conflicting schools of Polish historiography. Briefly, then, such is the scope of our study, and such are its problems.\n\nIn the following pages we shall\n\nattempt to trace Poland1® historic and ecclesiastical rise in relation to the Umpire and the Papacy, her part in the conflict of Gregory VII and Henry IV and the influence of the reform spirit on the Church in Poland. For many helpful suggestions and corrections I am indebted to Father Demetrius B* Zema, S,J., F.H.S., to idiom I wish to extend my heart-felt gratitude.\n\nIn addi­\n\ntion, I am most grateful to Er. William Roehrenbeck, Librarian of the Fordham University Library, for his aid and efforts in securing books from other libraries.\n\nFinal­\n\nly, I wish to thank the attendants of the Slavonic Depart­ ment of the Mew York Public Library, especially Mr. lf*%Berlstein, for their courtesy and service during the long months of research*\n\nL\n\nJ\n\n6\n\nr\n\nn\n\nCHAPTER I POLITICAL RISE OF POLAND: RELATIONS WITH GERMANY The political history of Poland formally began\n\nin the tenth century when, appearing out of the twilight surrounding the life of the numerous Slavonic tribes, it made its entrance into the family ©f Christian states* It arose simultaneously and under the same influence of external pressure which at that time was calling into being a Czech state and a Russian state in the South around Kiev*\n\nThat external pressure came from the con­\n\nstant incursions from the East and the evexjlhresent danger of German conquest from the West*\n\nThe entry of Poland\n\ninto the domain of history synchronizes with, and is, indeed, directly due to a significant event which occurred in the middle of the tenth century*\n\nWhen Mieszko 1, the\n\nfifth ruler of the Polish house of Piast ascended the throne in 962, both he and his subjects were strangers to Christi­ anity, even in name*\n\nIndeed, almost all the kingdoms of\n\nthe North at that time were steeped in idolatry, only a small portion of the Saxons and some Hungarians having accepted the Gospel* At the period when the authentic history of Poland began, the Germans had already become the most powerful nation of Europe*\n\nProm as far back as Charle­\n\nmagne, there had begun that expansion of the Teutonic nations toward the East now characterized as der Drang L.\n\nJ\n\n*“ \"H B§SM Osten. The Slavs between the Elbe and the Oder rivers, less warlike and smaller in stature than the Armans, poor­ ly organized by comparison and relatively ill-armed, were slowly subjugated.3, The territory beyond the Oder was distinctly Polish and this likewise was soon to be the scene of attacks by German dukes and margraves, who pretended to the dis­ tinction of conquering the Slavs for the purpose of convert­ ing them.\n\nThe chief scourge of the Polish lands was the\n\nmargrave of hausitz, Geron, whose superior arms forced Mieszko to submit on the field of battle,\n\n2\n\nconstraining\n\nhim to recognize the suzerainty of the victor over his lands and to acknowledge himself as Geron1s vassal.\n\nAs vassal of\n\nthe German margrave, Mieszko was further obliged to ack­ nowledge the ©verlordship of the German Emperor, Otto I, and as a token of his vassalage to pay a tribute for the land he held on the left bank of the river Warta.\n\n3\n\nThis subjection to the German rulers marks the beginning ©f Polandfs_ feudal relations with Germany.\n\nHence­\n\nforth, the story of these relations will present a picture of German rulers endeavoring to retain their control over the Poles, the Polish dukes utilizing every advantage in 1.

Mieszko, therefore, acknowledged himself as a tributary of the emperor winperatori fidelem tributumque usque in Vurta fluvium solventemH.^\n\nIn return, the Germans considered the\n\nPolish ruler as f*amicus imperatoris1*2 which implied that he was to assist the emperor in propagating the faith among the heathen, at the same time connoting that Mieszko would receive support from Otto in case of attack by the margraves. This new relationship of Mieszko to the emperor became evident shortly after his Baptism, for, in 967, a certain German margrave, Wichman, adhering to the established practice of his countrymen, invaded the Polish lands, but met with successful opposition.\n\nBeing no longer supported\n\nby a Christian Germany against a heathen Poland this was a novel situation for a German aggressor.\n\nWithout this\n\nsupport, Wichman was decisively defeated and, dying, en­ trusted his sword to Miesako as the r,amicus imperatoris*1 1.

In the light of this accusation, and to insure Mieszko1s 1 .

Two months after the meeting at Quedlinburg, Otto I died and there arose a dispute as to the succession to the throne, to toich aspired both Otto1s son, Otto IX, and Henry the Quarrelsome of Bavaria.\n\nMieszko, using\n\nevery opportunity to gain more power for himself and to embarrass Germany, supported the pretender, Henry the i. Otto XX defeated Henry together with his Czech allies and thereupon turned toward Poland in 979.\n\nSince there were\n\nno decisive results, peace was concluded between Otto and the Polish ruler, who further strengthened his position by an advantageous marriage with Oda, daughter of the Saxon 3 margrave, Theod#ric, for his first wife, Bombrowka, had died in 977.\n\nThis marriage alliance having strengthened\n\nMieszko1s security from the West, he employed this 1.

His ducal authority was again recognized, but with the understanding that as a vassal he was required to furnish a quota of troops to fight the rebellious heathen Slavs.\n\nA con­\n\nsequence of his amity with the emperor was a gradual with­ drawal from his alliance with the Czechs who had incurred the imperial anger in the war for succession and\n\nanti-Czech\n\n1 .

But this was the last important action of his life, for death ended his labors in 992• ^ His achievements entitle Mieszko to be regarded as the founder of the Polish kingdom; for upon his accession to the throne, in 962, he had found danger on all sides, especially from the East, but pursuing a brilliant diplo­ matic policy enabled him to ease the position of his coun­ try.\n\nfhus, in order t© resist the Saxons, Czechs and\n\nRuthenians who menaced his borders, he recognized the suzerainty of Otto; as a further measure towards the pro­ tection of his lands he created the first permanent Polish military force composed of 3000 knights.^\n\nMoreover, to\n\ndefend himself if the attitude of the German monarch were to change, Mieszko placed himself under the protection of the Pope.\n\nJoachim Bartoszewicz aptly sums up Mieszko*s\n\nreign: 1* Annales Hildesheimenses.

This new dignity, based on the possession of the remains of the martyr, was enhanced by the power that Boleslaw had acquired.\n\nHaving successfully checkmated the\n\n1.

Moreover, Otto transferred t o o the Polish king his own suzerain power not only over all Polish peoples beyond the Oder, but also over all those Slavs who would be 4 converted in the future. Thus Otto III recognized Boleslaw was a powerful ruler in Eastern Europe, and to ✓cement their friendly relations even more firmly, a marriage was arranged between Boleslaw* s son,Mieszko II (Mieczyslaw), and Rieheza (Ryxa), niece of Otto III.\n\nOther matters received their attention,\n\namong them the establishment of a Polish hierarchy, inde­ pendent of the Church in Germany, a topic which we shall 1.

There has been much discussion among historians as to what this coronation really meant.\n\nMany have inter­\n\npreted the placing of the crown on Boleslaw* s head as a legal coronation.\n\nThere is, however, a German interpreta­\n\ntion, which denies that Boleslaw was crowned by Otto III in 1000.\n\n1\n\nHad he been so crowned, they argue, he would\n\nnot have considered it necessary to crown himself in 1024. Bamdtkie, the Polish historian, in refuting this version, contends that Boleslaw did actually reeeive a royal crown in 1000 at G&iesen and as long- as his coronator, Otto III, lived, Boleslaw continued to be an ally of the empire, but when, upon the death of Otto III, Henry II ascended the throne in 1002, and when hostilities broke out between Poland and Germany, the Germans regarded Boleslaw as a rebel against the empire and as such considered as deprived of his royal title,\n\nWhile the war lasted, Boleslaw could\n\ndo nothing to assert his royal dignity, but eventually, in 1024, he had himself crowned King1 by his archbishop.\n\n2\n\n1. Thietmar, being a good German nationalist, made no men­ tion of the coronation, although he later implied that he knew about it. . 2. Jerzy Samuel Badtkie, Krdtkie Wyobrazenie Dzieow Krolestwa Polakiego, Wroclaw, Wilhelm Bogumil Korn, 1810, Tom I, p. 142. L.\n\nJ\n\n24\n\nThis explanation by Bandtkie of the second coronation seems dubious.\n\nIn reality the ceremony of 1000\n\ncannot be considered a coronation, for two elements were necessary for a proper coronation: the imperial and papal, both of which were indispensible for the legality of the act.\n\nAt Gnesen, by placing his crown on the head of Boles­\n\nlaw, Otto was signifying his imperial consent; the second portion of the ceremony would have to be the anointing, performed by the Pope or his legate, of which there is no 4 mention in any of the chronicles. Neither Gallus, Kadlubek nor Bogufal, our earliest writers, refers to a religious ceremony at the coronation.\n\n1\n\nTherefore, what occurred at\n\nGnesen was not a coronation ceremony in the accepted sense of the term.\n\nThat Boleslaw himself realized this fact is\n\nevident from his later efforts to obtain papal permission for a coronation.\n\nOf this Charles Forster says:\n\nMais a cett^ epoque de jferveur, tout monarque chretien tenait a Stre sacre par le pape, et Boleslas lui-m&ne n^ se eonsiderait i>^s comme reunissant tous les earacteres de la dignite monarchique, tant que cette faveur lui manquait, aussi la sollicita-tril avec ardeur aupr&s du saint-siege par de nombreux envoyes. La gloire aequise ne lui suffisait pas, et Boleslas pensait sans doute que, pour aff/srmir tout, k fait son trone, 1* as sentiment de Home etait indis­ pensable.2 Therefore, even though his triumph was not complete, Boleslaw had accomplished much at Gnesen, for Otto had honored him as a friend and ally, all tribute to 1 . Naruszewicz, Hist orya Narodu Polskiego, p. 99n. 2. Charles Forster, Pologne. Paris, Firmin Didot, 1840, p.49. L\n\nj\n\n25\n\nr n the empire was discarded and suzerainty was given him over the Slavs beyond the Oder.\n\nMoreover, he had received the\n\nimperial consent to the royal crown which implied that he was free to petition the Pope for the royal title and unction.\n\nPoland was thereafter no longer a vassal state\n\nof Germany, and, aside from recognizing the nominal sove­ reignty of the emperor, became an independent country. However, the amicable relations between Germany and Poland which existed during the lifetime of Otto, were not destined to continue for long.\n\n*Phe action of Otto was\n\nthat of a youthful enthusiast 5 it did not represent the sentiment of the German people, for when Otto died in 1002, a change took place in Germano-Polish relations, Ottofs friendly policy toward the Slavs being abandoned in favor of the former anti-Slavic campaigns which Boleslaw was quick to combat. Ihe means at Boleslaw1s disposal for anti-German action at this time were many, for analogous to the con­ ditions which existed after the death of the first two Ottos, in 1002, a pretender, Henry of Bavaria, son of Henry the Quarrelsome, was laying* claim to the throne.\n\nFurther­\n\nmore Ekkehard, the Margrave of Meissen, whose prowess had made him the bulwark of the eastern border of Germany, had been killed and conditions in Germany were unsettled. 1. Thietmar, Chronic on. M.G.H. SS. T. Ill, p* 793. L_\n\nj\n\n26\n\nr Taking advantage of this unrest, Boleslaw proceeded to\n\n-I\n\nconquer the territory lying* between Poland and Germany proper, which included the Lausitzer and Milziener Marks, X made up of Bautzen, Strehla and Meissen, thus gaining control of the whole Thuringian Mark east of the Elbe.\n\n2\n\nRecording these events, the nationalistic Thietmar was moved to record indignantly: *'God forgive the Emperor for ever having elevated Boleslaw of Poland after he had once 3 been reduced to tribute*1. Proclaiming* that he had conquered these terri­ tories with the consent of the new king, Henry II, Boleslaw proceeded to the royal court at Merseburg in iluly, 1002, to obtain Henry’s consent for the retention of his conquests. Henry's policy was to weaken his eastern neighbor, but as yet internal conditions in Germany prevented him from taking forceful action.\n\nHe grudgingly ceded Lausitzer and Mil-\n\nziemer to Boleslaw but withheld the Mark of Meissen which 4 he granted to Ekkehard's brother Gunzelin. It seemed that friendly relations between Germany and Poland might be pre­ served by this compromise. However, as Boleslaw was leaving* Merseburg, an attack was made upon his person from which he barely escaped 1 . Ibid.. p. 792: ,r...omnem Geronis marcham comitis, citra\n\nAlbim jacentem.\" 2.

After this restoration a combined German and Czech force invaded Poland in 1005 and devastated the land 4 as far north as Posen, although this was the limit of the emperor’s achievements against the Polish duke. For re5 6 peated campaigns in 1005, 1007, 1010-1012, and 1015-1018 all resulted in failure.\n\nThere was, indeed, an interlude\n\n1. Ibid.. pp. 793-796; Annalista Saxo. M.G.H. SS. T. VI, p. 649. 2.

In fact, so eager was the Emperor for this diver­ sion of Polish forces towards Russia and away from Germany that he agreed to furnish a contingent of troops for Boleslaw*s Russian venture.\n\nBut,in 1015, after this short­\n\nlived truce, war was resumed, during which nothing was spared from fire or sword in all the territory between 2\n\nthe rivers Elbe and Bober. Boleslaw, however, was able to withstand the imperial forces which were supported by Saxon, Bavarian and Bohemian fighting men, so that, in 1018, Henry II was finally obliged to make peace.\n\nIn January of that year,\n\nboth rulers met at Bautzen and reached an agreement whereby Poland was to retain possession of Lausitz (whether as fief or in full possession is uncertain), Milsko and Moravia. This compact was a long step toward Boleslaw*s envisioned independence from Germany.\n\nAssured now of peace with the\n\nemperor, Boleslaw could securely turn eastward where he sacked Kiev in Russia and with the booty taken vastly ..u 1.

The coronation served as a fitting climax to Boleslaw1s life.\n\nHe had enlarged and unified his country,\n\nhad won independence from Germany and had received the crown,\n\nHowever, the enjoyment of his new dignity was brief,\n\n1.

Mieszko IX continued his fatherTs anti-German policy, diplomatically by communicating with disaffected forces in Germany,^ and militarily by force of arms.\n\nWheth­\n\ner there was any formal understanding with the anti-imperial elements in Germany is unknown, but, in 1028, Mieszko dis­ regarded his father *s treaty\n\nof Bautzen by falling upon the\n\nmiddle border between Germany and Poland and devastating the frontier lands as far as eastern Saxony.\n\n2\n\nThe German\n\nemperor, Conrad II, retaliated by a double act: he himself hurried to the imperilled area and, at the same time, in­ duced Poland’s neighbor, Brzetyslaw, duke of Bohemia, to attack Moravia which had been taken by Boleslaw Chrobry in 3 1003. Although the Czechs succeeded in Moravia, Conrad* s campaign was a failure, due, in large part, to the conside­ rable number of his troops who were immobilized by Hungarian 1. There is an extant letter sent by Mathilda, wife of a Lotharingian count, and daughter of Frederick, Duke of Swabia. It is contained in a Saeramentary or Ordo Romanorum sent to Mieszko.

Realizing that the situation on his Polish frontier was acute, Conrad directed his full attention to 1. Grodeeki, Pzie.ie Polski* p. 83 f considers this a very lenient puhishment.

To stabilize his very precarious hold on the throne, Bezprym offered Conrad the royal insignia and the royal title which Boleslaw Chrobry and Mieszko II had assumed against the will of the German emperors •^ Conrad naturally accepted the Polish crown, which was the symbol of Polish royalty and, in return, recognized the rule of Bezprym*\n\nHowever, the reign of the new ruler was\n\n1.

Bealizing, however, that his continued tenure to the throne\n\ndepended on the good-will of the emperor, the Polish ruler, in July, 1033, proceeded to Merseburg to recognize the suzerainty of the emperor.\n\nThere, following the example\n\nof Bezprym, his brother, Mieszko renounced the royal crown and the royal title ’’eoronae ac totius regalis ornament! 2\n\noblxtus11, hoping to guarantee the safety of his country and to keep intact what remained of his father’s realm by this degrading action.\n\nBut Conrad was not satisfied.\n\nDetermined to revenge the former ambitious defiance against Germany by Boleslaw Chrobry, the present situation offered him ample opportunity for doing so.\n\nHe strove, therefore,\n\nto utilize the favorable circumstances to end the constant Polish treat to Germany’s eastern border and, at the same time, to insure Poland’s subjection to the empire.\n\nFollow­\n\ning the principle: divide et imoera.Poland was partitioned into three parts: one part, probably the largest, was given to Mieszko as a fief of the empire with the added obligation of paying an annual tribute; a second part went 1.

Stanislai Majiore. M.G.H. SS. T. XXIX, p. 509. Many historians deny that Casimir became a monk. Slocombe, A History of Poland, says* \"From his mother Casimir acquired a marked taste for science and a deep devotion to the Christian faith. His education was exceptional, his early life having been spent with learned clerics, and from this fact probably arose the legend cherished in later years that he had himself been a monk, and had relinquished his religious duties to wear the crown of Poland.11 David, Casimir et Boleslas. p. 22, says the legend arises from an old Cluniae tradition which told how, when Alphonse, king of A&rgon had been killed in 1134, his countrymen sought out Bamire, of the royal family, in the monastery of St. Pons de Tomieres in Languedoc ^ and made him king. He received a dispensation from his vows and married. David claims that, this story of a monk becoming a king was transmitted from monastery to monastery until it finally reached fyniec where Dlugossus heard of it and drew a parallel between the case of Ramire and Casimir. Despite the objections to the story of Casimir becoming a monk, the evidence in favor of it seems more probable than the explanations offered against it.\n\nL\n\nJ\n\n43\n\nprogressed in the religious life until he attained the\n\nn\n\nrank of deacon. Poland had, in the meantime, become the scene of great\n\ndisorder.\n\nWith the flight of the royal family,\n\nthe local lords took the control of the country into their own hands and a period of anarchy followed.\n\nBielski re­\n\nports that the magnates met at various times to elect a new\n\nking but could not agree on a suitable candidate. For somewanted Jaroslaw, prince of Russia, others refused to agree for he was of the Greek faith. Some voted for Maslaw, count of Masovia, others did not want him for he was proud and cruel....Some wanted Brzetyslaw, the Czech prince, others refused, for he was illegitimate....Some wanted someone from among themselves, to be like what Piast once had been, but others refused this, saying, MHe would become proud, caring only for his own interests, while oppressing others.^1 Since no agreement could be reached, the sepa­\n\nratism which had become evident in the reign of Mieszko now came into full play.\n\nTaking* advantage of the lack of\n\ncentral authority, the territorial lords assumed complete sovereignty over their lands.\n\nIn Masovia, for instance,\n\ncount Maslaw seized power and organized a powerful state, while all other forces of separatism, disorder and anarchy, once set in motion, could not be checked. The serfs, imitating the example of their masters, rose in a body to revenge the impositions and exactions to which they had been subjected, for the wars of Mieszko I 1.

L,\n\nJ\n\n44\n\n•Boleslaw Ghrobry and Mieszko II had imposed many hardships n upon them and in the chaos of the time they readily saw an opportunity for casting off the shackles of their serf­ dom.\n\nTurning, therefore, against their masters, the serfs\n\npillaged and burned the crops and homes; moreover, associ­ ating the Church and the priests with the reigning class and resenting the ecclesiastical tithes, the dormant paga­ nism of the lowest classes came to the surface#\n\nFor its\n\nwas scarcely seventy years since Christianity had been brought into the country and in many places the religious beliefs were only a thin veneer over an inner paganism. As a result, churches and monasteries were plundered and priests subjected to the same fate as the masters.1\n\nOnly\n\nMasovia, where count Maslaw had established a strong per­ sonal rule and whither Christianity had not entered as fully as elsewhere, thereby causing less opposition in the latent paganism, was spared the ordeal of fire and sword. Added to the terrible internal civil war was the inevitable attack by Poland's neighbors*\n\nThe disorders\n\nwithin the Polish state were an inviting opportunity not to be disregarded by the neighboring princes.\n\nThus the\n\nPomeranians refused to pay their tribute to Poland, while Jaroslaw, duke of Kiev, attacking from the East, devastated 1.

After freely plundering' the treasures of Cracow, including those amassed by Boleslaw Chrobry, he directed his army to Gnesen, the Metropolitan See of Poland.\n\nArriving at\n\nthat holy city, accompanied by Severus, the bishop of Praguq, he ordered the remains of St. Adalbert removed to Bohemia and then, after taking additional wealth and treasures from Gnesen, he returned to his own country.\n\n2\n\nOvercome by the attacks from without and within , the Poles decided that their salvation lay solely in the return of the monarchy under Casimir.\n\nAt this stage in\n\nthe story we again encounter many conflicting accounts, for the circumstances surrounding Casimir*s return to the throne are clouded in doubt.\n\nThe difficulties arise from\n\nthe question of whether Casimir was actually a monk.\n\nIf we\n\naccept the account of his entry as a religious into Cluny, 3 4 then we may follow Dlugossus and Biel ski in their accounts 1 .

It is most probable that all these versions con­ tain some part of the whole story, each one merely empha­ sizing one portion above the others.\n\nWe have already\n\naccepted the verity of Dlugossus\" account about Casimir*s entry into Cluny.\n\nThus after the depredations and disorders\n\nof six years* duration, the magnates, bishops and clergy decided to ask Casimir to resume his throne.\n\nHowever,\n\nsince the young prince had travelled widely, his where­ abouts and monastic profession were unknown to the Polish people.\n\nAccordingly, they sent a delegation to his mother\n\nHicheza at Saalfeld in Saxony to request her forgiveness for the hardships she had experienced earlier at their hands and to beg her permission for her son*s return to the throne of Poland.\n\nRicheza, still resentful at her\n\nexpulsion from the country, told the delegates that her son would not return to Poland because of the treai$ipp| which both she and he had received.\n\nMoreover, even if he\n\nwished to return, she told them, he could not because he 1.

Henry III, accordingly, took the Polish principality under his protection and provided 500 armed German troops to accompany Casimir to his realm.\n\n2\n\n1 .

He made known his in­ tentions to his mother who asked him not to return to the perfidious people who had not yet been fully Christian­ ized. Instead she told him to remain peacefully on his mother’s large estate. To this was added the emperor&s request that he remain in Germany and as an inducement a large grant of land would be made him. Casimir, how­ ever, refused these sollicitations and, taking 500 knights, entered Poland.

Assured then of peace from the side of Bohemia, Casimir turned his attention to his eastern neighbors where he effected an alliance with Jaroslaw, the duke of Kiev, by marrying the latter1s sister, Marya Dobrogniewa.\n\n2\n\nThese\n\nmeasures gave him a free hand to settle a pressing problem the Polish throne. He, therefore, gave his ward 500 German knights with which to return to his country. 1. Bielski, Kronika Polska, p. 176. 2. Marya Dobrogniewa was the sister of Anne who married Henry I of France. This is another indication of the ties which bound Poland to the western states and which bore fruit in the influx of French monks into the country.

From his accession Casimir had maintained vassal relations with the emperor.\n\nAs a faithful vassal he had\n\n1. Gallus, Chronicae Folonorum. M.G.H. SS. T. IX, p. 438.

L\n\nJ\n\n‘helped Henry to humble the Czech king, Brzetyslaw, in 1041 and in return, had hoped to regain Silesia.\n\nBut the empe­\n\nror had permitted the Czech prince to retain that province and Casimir, in resentment, absented himself from the emperor’s court at Goslar in 1042 and 1043.\n\nWhen Henry\n\ndemanded an explanation of his absence, Casimir dispatched delegates to perform the oath of fealty in his name and to give his preoccupations with internal conditions as the reason for his absence.\n\nThus Polish-German relations\n\nremained peaceful until 1046 when Casimir, emboldened by his conquest of Masovia, marched into the province of Pomerania.\"^ Ziemomysl, the duke of Pomerania and Brzetys­ law, the Czech king, were moved by this action to accuse Casimir to the emperor for violating their frontiers. Henry III, as suzerain of all three, summoned them to his eourt at Merseburg to arbitrate the case.\n\nOnce again,\n\nCasimir was compelled to obey his feudal summons and duti­ fully to observe the verdict restoring peace, but, in 1050 he defiantly repudiated his feudal oath and counteracted the emperor's decision of 1041 which confirmed the Czech possession of Silesia. For, in that year, Casimir, having already conquered Masovia and Pomerania and seeing that Hnery III was preoccupied in the West, marched into Silesia.\n\nThe\n\nwronged Czech prince immediately appealed to the emperor 1. Ibid., p. 438. L '\n\nand, in Autumn of the year 1050, Henry III began preparing an army against Poland.\n\nBut sickness and trouble in Hun­\n\ngary deterred him from action and Casimir, using this dis­ traction, hurried to Goslar in November in order to appease the German ruler.\n\nThere, he accordingly, promised obe­\n\ndience to the emperor and furnished troops for Henry* s Hungarian expedition of that year.\n\n1\n\nBut the Polish ruler\n\nretained Silesia during the Hungarian operations and, appearing again before the emperor in 1054, was allowed to annex that province to Poland.\n\nIn return, however,\n\nCasimir was required to pay the Czech prince 500 pounds of silver and 30 p unds of gold annually as tribute for 2\n\nSilesia.\n\nThis acquisition was a great political triumph\n\nfor Casimir, for he had now united_ under Polish sway all the lands occupied by purely ^olish tribes.\n\nSatisfied in\n\nhaving restored to Poland her former boundaries, he now devoted his attention to internal administrative and eeeleo siastical reform. So successful was he in these internal endeavors that he acquired the name of Casimir !,the Bestorer,f. Death terminated his labors in 1058. Casimir had rebuilt the country which he had found despoiled and, in addition, had freed it from foreign incisions, but to the_^^^\n\nhe,,was, unable to .\n\n1.

XVI, p. 647.\n\nrliberate it from political and tributary dependence upon the empire which still regarded Poland as a province.\n\nn\n\nWf\n\ndiplomatic skill and military aid he had appeased Germany and weakened his neighbors, an achievement which enabled him to strengthen Poland internally; however, it remained for his son, Bole slaw IX, to employ this internal strength for the further aggrandizement of Poland and for the casting off of German dependence. In retrospect, thus far, we have followed Poland*s political rise from the time of Mieszko 1 to the reign of Casimir the Restorer.\n\nIt is a story of close relations with\n\nthe German Empire. Bnder Mieszko I Poland had been a vassal state, while under his successor, Boleslaw I, the Polish state had gained almost absolute independence with the resultant formal coronation.\n\nBut Boleslaw I*s constructive\n\naccomplShments were nullified by the weak rule of his son, Mieszko II, and by foreign attacks.\n\nIn the Interregnum\n\nwhich followed Mieszko II*s death, Poland was brought to the point of disappearing as a state and Germany was enabled to restore full sovereignty over this neighboring state. Then, Casimir had rebuilt Poland into a strong state, but the country remained a dependency of the German Empire. The great political disorders within Germany consequent on Henry IV*s conflict with the papacy were to present Casimir*s successor, Boleslaw II, with the opportunity of duplicating his namesake’s accomplishments in gaining independence from ^Germany.\n\nWith the accession of Boleslaw II to the throne J\n\nS4\n\nSire enter the period of the Gregorian reform.\n\nBefore\n\nstudying this prince*s relations with the German empire, an investigation of Poland*s relations with the Papacy would be in order.\n\nL\n\nJ\n\n56\n\nr\n\nn\n\nCHAPTER II CHURCH IN POLAND:\n\nRELATION TO THE PAPACY\n\nAlthough Christianity came into Poland with the Baptism of Mieszko in 966, traces of Christianity had un­ doubtedly been left there by the many Christians #10 from the neighboring country of Moravia had sought refuge in Poland after the Hungarian invasion b&d devastated their lands*\n\nApart from these, Christian hermits had built their\n\ncells in Bohemia and Poland, while pilgrims and merchants passed continually through these lands, thus enabling those with whom they came in contact to become acquainted with the teachings of the Gospel.^\n\nThere must have been, there­\n\nfore, a certain number of Christians among the heathen Poles, though no organized Church existed.\n\n2\n\nThis explains the\n\ncomparatively peaceful acceptance of the new faith and of the Christian code of morals by the population of the country.*^ -\n\n...\n\n- .\n\n-■\n\n—\n\n-\n\n1. Bielski, Kronika Polska, p. 117. He says that some of the merchants served at the court of Mieszko I, and at their urging he became a Christian. 2. Although there is no historical evidence for this, many Polish historians surmise that monks from Ireland, Fulda and Corbe preached Christianity to the Poles. Cf^ H.Orsza (pseud, for Helen Radlinska z Rajchmanow) 2 Dzieiow Narodu, Warszawa, M. Arcta, 1908, Tom X, pp. 67769, Alifesander Bruckner, Dzieje Kultury^ Polskie.i. Krakow, W. L. Anqjzyc i Spolka, 1931, Tom I, p. 221. 3. This peaceful acceptance probably accounts for the dearth of info* mat ion in the historical sources. - Had the introduc­ tion of Christianity been violent the contemporary chronic­ lers would have noted the fact, but since it was progress­ ive and peaceful, it did not come to their notice. Cf. Orsza, 2 Pzie.iow Narodu. pp. 66-6 . L\n\nj\n\n56\n\nr\n\nThe organization of the Church in Poland dates\n\nn\n\nfro® the marriage of Mieszko I to Dombrowka, daughter of the King of Bohemia, in 965, or more specifically, from his Baptism in 066.^\n\nFor then, by royal decree all idols and\n\ntemples were destroyed and were replaced by crosses and churches.\n\nThe first missionaries were those who came with\n\nDombrowka from Bohemia, but because they were probably few 3 in number, had to be augmented by priests sent from Germany* The head of the missionary activity was Jordan, probably a German, who functioned at first as an \"episcopus gentium11 a* missionary bishop among the heathen, without any permanent See*\n\nBut after a number of churches had been\n\nestablished, an Episcopal See was created for Jordan at Poznan (968), although Gnesen was the seat of the Piast dynasty.\n\nHowever, as a vassal of the emperor, Mieszko\n\n1. Dlugossus, Historiae Folonorum, c* 93, states that the duke on becoming* baptized changed his name from Mieszko, which he considered barbarous, to Miecslaus (Mieczyslaw). 2. Ibid.. c. 94. 3. The Czechs did not yet have their own bishops in the country, which indicates that their Church was not yet well organized. 4. Cf. Arnold, Polska. Je.i Dzie.iei Kultura. Tom. I, p. 58. Two reasons are given for the creation of the episcopal See in Posen instead of at Gnesen. Gnesen had been the centre of the pagan cult and was consequently less Christian than Posen. The Polish king would, therefore, prefer to establish his episcopal centre in the city where Christianity had made most progress. A second reason, and the one which more probably explains the preference of the one cityover the other, was the fact that Posen was nearer the German border and so nearer organized Christianity.\n\nL.\n\nJ\n\nrcould not consider with favor the establishment of an inde-^1 pendant church in Poland, since religious independence: was closely linked with political independence. Accordingly, the organization of the Polish Church was brought into the German ecclesiastical frame-work. Hence we see that Otto I established an archiepiscopal See at Magdeburg, in 968, which was to have jurisdiction over all the Slav bishoprics, namely, Zestz, Meissen, Merseburg, Brandeburg, Kavelberg and Poznan.1\n\nPoznan was thereby placed\n\nunder the spiritual jurisdiction of the archiepiscopal See of Magdeburg, while German influence seemed to be paramount over Poland,2 whose political and ecclesiastical organiza­ tion now depended on the empire.\n\nYet, even though Mieszko\n\naccepted German jurisdiction and German priests for the evangelization of his country, nevertheless, he strove to counter-act their influence by summoning ecclesiastics from Italy and Prance. 1.

Although the evangelization of Poland was pro­ ceeding smoothly, it must be remembered that Mieszko was 1 . Dlugossus, Historiae Polonicae. c. 95: says that Mieszko\n\nL_\n\nestablished archbishoprics in Gnesen and Cracow, and seven bishoprics, c. 95-96. Having founded these nine episcopal Bees, he is supposed to have assigned to their bishops tithes and to have founded canonries, monaste­ ries and parish churches. Cardinal Egidius, bishop of Tusculum, was sent by Pope John XIII to preside over and organize the new Church. Since there were not sufficient priests and bishops to carry out the work, Egidius invi­ ted clergy from Italy and France to come to Poland. The tithe was to be gathered for the benefit of the bishops. Such was the origin of the Polish clergy and of the immense wealth of the Church in Poland according to Dlugossus. Wo other chronicler mentions these founda­ tions, nor Is there any record of a papal legate arriving in Poland in the tenth century. Thietmar mentions only three episcopal Sees for the year 1000. Heither Gallus, Kadlubek nor Bogufal, who wrote at least two centuries before Dlugossus makes any mention of the bishoprics noted in Dlugossus* work as founded by Mieszko I. It is very doubtful whether they were actually founded,in the reign of Mieszko. Cf. Bandtkie, Krotkie Wyobrazania. p. 125n. ' Annales Silesiaci Compilati, M.G.H. SS. T. XIX, p. 537/ Adelaide was the mother of St. Stephen, the first king of Hungary to receive the royal crown.\n\nr -i largely prompted by political considerations in accepting Christianity, for the surest way he saw of escaping the danger of annexation to the empire was to place himself under the protection of the Papacy.\n\nUnfortunately, the\n\ncircumstances affecting the relations between the Papacy and Poland are obscured by the many conflicting accounts that are extant so that our knowledge is perforce fragmen­ tary and to a certain extent uncertain. Thus, the historian Feliks Konaczny notes that Hieszko placed his realm under papal protection as early as 974, on the occasion of the ceremonial clipping of Boleslaw* s hair on his attaining the age of seven.\n\nForth­\n\nwith, an embassy was sent to Home in order to present a few locks of hair to the Pope, as a symbol that the father was entrusting his eldest son tdjthe Pope's tutelage.\n\nThis sym­\n\nbolic act was accompanied by the petition requesting the Pope to recognize Boleslaw*s right of inheritance and succession to his father's throne.\n\nThis, of course, implied\n\non the Pope's part the recognition of the integrity of the Piast realm, but it also meant that Boleslaw desired to be a vassal of the Apostolic See.\n\nThe Pope accepted the\n\ngift and its implications while at the same time he learned from the envoys of the progress which Christianity had made in the Polish territories.\n\n1\n\nHow much legend is\n\n1. Feliks Koneczny, Dzieje Polski Za Piastow. Krakow, 1902, pp. 57-58. h\n\nJ\n\n60\n\ninterwoven irrto Koneczny’s account, is not certain, ^ but that Poland did establish protective relations with the Papacy is placed beyond reasonable doubt by a document known as \"Dagome judex11, which, however, has been inter­ preted in various senses*\n\nThe text of this document is as\n\nfollows: Dagome judex et Ote senatrix filiique eorum 994-996; beato Petro Poloniam conferunt* Item in alio tomo, sub Johanne XV Papae Dagome judex et Ote senatrix et filii eorum Misica et Lambertus leguntur beato Petro contulisse unam civitatem in integrum, que est Sehinesghe, cum omnibus suis pertinentiis infra hos affines; sicuti incipit a primo latere longum mare fine Pruzze usque in locum qui dicitur Husse, et fine Russe extendente usque in Craccoa, et ab ipsa Craccoa usque as flumen Oddere recte in locum qui dicitur Alemure, et ab ipsa Alemura usque in terram Milze, et a fine Milze recte intra Oddere, et exinde ducente juxta flumgn Oddere usque in praedictam civitatem Sehinesghe. These lines have been a source of great diffi­ culty for investigators of early Polish history.\n\nBor\n\ninstance, the questions arises Who were Dagome and Lambert? Are the dates 994-996 correct? Who applied for the Pope’s protection, an actual person named Dagon^ or was Dagome merely Mieszko’s surname?\n\nOr was Ote (Oda) the initiator\n\nof the appeal to the Pope? Many solutions are offered in answer to these problems.\n\nGrodecki and Paul Fabre agree in the surmise\n\n1. Paul Fabre, \"La Pologne et le Saint-Siege de Xe au Xllle Siecle”, in Etudes d ’histoire du Moven Age dediees a Gabriel Monod. Paris, 1896, p. 166n. 2* Codex Diplomat icus Mai oris Poloniae. Tom. I, p. 3. L j\n\n61\n\nr\n\nthat Mieszko (whose surname, they say, was Dagom) appealed to the Papacy for protection in the years 985-992.\n\n\"l\n\nAccord­\n\ning to them, he had married Oda and had three sons by her, Mieszko, Sventopulk and a third vfoose name is not known.\n\n1\n\nBetween 985, when John XY ascended the throne, and Mieszko1s death in 992, a petition was sent to Borne by Mieszko in the name of himself, his wife and of the two sons, offering 2\n\nto place Poland under the suzerainty of the Holy See. But this interpretation fails to answer two\n\nquestions: first, why was the name of Boleslaw, Mieszko*s son by his first wife, Dombrowka, omitted?\n\nSecondly,\n\nhow explain the dates 994-996 in the document?\n\nGrodecki\n\nand Fabre, indeed., attempt to answer these problems.\n\nThe\n\nformer simply states that probably the compiler of the papal regest in which the document is found, omitted the 3 name of Boleslaw by mistake; Fabre, on the other hand, surmises that Boleslaw had already been placed under the Holy Seefs suzerainty by the ceremony of presenting his hair-locks to the Pope and, therefore, it was unnecessary 4 to include his name with the others in this document. 1. Thietmar, Chronicon. M.G.H. SS. T. Ill, p. 784: «Haec genuit viro suimet tres filios Mizeconem, Sventopulcum et .... 2. Grodecki, Dzie.ie Polski. p. 54; Fabre, op.cit.» p. 165, explains the discrepancy between Sventopulk, the name given by Thietmar, and Lambert, the name in the document, by saying that Lambert was either the German transcrip­ tion of Sventopulk or merely a surname. 3. Grodecki, Dzie.ie P^lskl, p. 55. 4. Fabre, pp. pit., p. 166h. This is further borne out by the JLack of any mention of Boleslaw* sdis inheritance. l. In fact, Boleslaw was constantly at the side of Mieszko*]\n\n62\n\nTwo other versions of this document reject the idea that the omission of Boleslaw1s name was accidental* On the contrary, the document is understood to have heen purposely directed against the oldest son of Mieszko.\n\nThe\n\nfirst explanation has it that besides Boleslaw, Mieszko had three sons by Oda, his second wife, whose names were Mieszko, Sventopulk and Lambert.\n\n1\n\nTheir mother, fearful\n\nthat Boleslaw might disinherit them, was anxious to insure their share in the realm after Mieszko*s death, wherefore she persuaded her husband to protect the interests of the younger sons against Boleslaw by placing Poland under papal protection.\n\nAccordingly, between 985 and 992, Mieszko,\n\nwhose surname was Dagome, placed Poland under the Holy See^ tutelage in the name of himself, his wife, Oda, and of their sons, Mieszko and Lambert.\n\nHence, according to\n\nthis hypothesis, the act was inspired by Oda whose aim was to find in the Papacy a safeguard against the intrigues of her stepson, Boleslaw. The third interpretation takes the document at face value to mean that Mieszko married Oda in 977 and had three sons, Mieszko, Sventopulk and another whose name was probably Boleslaw.\n\nAs Mieszko grew old, Oda began to\n\ntake part in the government of the realm, supported by Dagome, Odiljen and Pribuwoj, with whose aid she ruled the 1 . The name Lambert is added to fill in the blank in\n\nThietmar1s account.\n\nL\n\nJ\n\n63\n\nCountry.\n\nBut when Mieszko died, Boleslaw succeeded to the n\n\nthrone and his first act was to drive out of the land Oda and her aa ns and to cause her advisers, Odiljen and Pri.\n\nbuwoj, to be blinded,\n\n1\n\nwhile Dagome, a very high official\n\nin the realm, either a judge (judex) or a high administrator, followed Oda into exile.\n\nIn her distress Oda carried her-\n\ncomplaints, not to the emperor’s court, but to Home, % journeying to Italy with her sons and their protector, the faithful Dagome, in 993,\n\nOf the sons, Sventopulk had al­\n\nready died, while Boleslaw, the third son, met the famous St, Romuald, leader of the ascetic movement and founder of the Camaldolese Order in Italy, and took the religious habit.\n\n2\n\nAccording to custom, he changed his name upon\n\nentering the religious life and took that of Lambert, Thus, according to this last interpretation of the '’Dagome judex\", Dagome (judex), Oda (Ota) and Misico and Lambert (the religious name of the third son) betook themselves to Rome where, in 994 or 995, they offered their kingdom to Pope John XV, beggin"
