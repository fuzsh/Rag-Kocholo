It evolved along different lines from the more centralised province of Bavaria and the larger but more fragmented province of Saxony. Originally known as Alemannia, the Alemans were defeated by the Merovingian Franks under King Clovis at the end of the 5th century and by the reign of King Theoderic I were under Frankish overlordship. However, the local rulers were able to preserve semi-autonomy, a situation which was not tolerated by the later Merovingians and early Carolingians, who launched a series of military campaigns against Alemannia in 709, 712, 743 and 746/47. During the last of these, the Alemannic dukes were deposed and a large part of the Alemannic nobility killed at Canstatt, near Stuttgart , following which the territory was ruled by Warin and Ruthard on behalf of Pepin and Charles \"Martel\" .\n\nDuring the following years, the territory was never united again under a single ruler: the Etichonid family ruled in Alsace, while the Alaholfing dynasty ruled in the valleys of the upper Danube and Neckar rivers. This presumably explains why Alemannia failed to retain its national identity after the Frankish takeover, in contrast to Bavaria . The territory was revived as a separate political entity in the early 10th century, coinciding with the significant decline in central Carolingian authority and the revival of the duchy of Bavaria. The title used by the early Hunfriding rulers in Swabia is uncertain. A 903 diploma of Ludwig IV \"das Kind\" King of Germany refers to the first Hunfriding ruler Burkhard as \"marchio Curiensis Rætiæ\", indicating the creation of a short-lived march in what is now northern Switzerland. Other contemporary sources give him the more general titles of \"comes et princeps Alamannorum\" and \"dux\". It is unlikely that either of these latter titles was officially sanctioned by the kings/emperors, as contemporary imperial diplomas give the title comes to Burchard. Development of an autonomous Swabian duchy was delayed by the rebellions of Burkhard [I] in 911 and of his son Burkhard [II] in 914, although the latter is given the title dux at a later date in contemporary sources. The new duchy appears to have been firmly established by 926 when Heinrich I King of Germany installed Hermann [Konradiner] as duke. This was the first direct intervention by the central regal authority in ducal appointments in Germany, but became the accepted pattern during the rest of the 10th century with dukedoms such as Swabia being treated by the king like an office, the title being awarded and removed with regularity depending on the loyalty of the office-holder. During the following 150 years, the dukes of Swabia were chosen from ten different dynasties, with the Hunriding and Konradiner families being the only ones which provided Swabian rulers over three consecutive generations.\n\nThe decline in the central authority of the dukes of Swabia probably dates from the investiture crisis involving Heinrich IV King of Germany, which resulted in the election of a series of anti-kings. The election of rival kings was mirrored in the appointment of rival dukes in Swabia, with the authority of duke Berthold von Rheinfelden being challenged by Friedrich von Hohenstaufen in 1079, and the latter's authority being challenged in turn in 1092 by duke Berthold [Zähringen]. Although the Staufen duke prevailed on the latter occasion, his Zähringen rival was compensated by recognition of his personal title of duke, which was also transmitted to his descendants. This represented the first time in which two individuals both peaceably held the title dux at any one time in any of the original German provinces. The significance is heightened by the fact that the dux was traditionally the sole military as well as political leader in each province. For Swabia, therefore, the presence of two dukes within the province was a significant change, although the difference would probably have remained symbolic if it had not been for other factors which accelerated the decline in the power of the Swabian dukes. Foremost was a third ducal presence in Swabia. In 1096, the Welf family established themselves definitively as dukes of Bavaria. However, their original power-base was Swabia where they were still major landholders and where contemporary sources such as necrologies show that they also used the title dux. At the same time, the Staufen dukes were widening their horizon of activity away from Swabia. Although they took their name from the Swabian castle of Staufen, the family acquired extensive property in Franconia, bequeathed to Duke Friedrich II by his maternal uncle Emperor Heinrich V. The election of Konrad von Staufen as Konrad III King of Germany in 1138, and that of his nephew as King Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" in 1152, signalled the family's definitive removal from the provincial Swabian field of activity to the national stage. Members of the Staufen family held the title Duke of Swabia until the last male heir Konradin was beheaded in 1268, but it is clear that these were largely honorific appointments. Contemporary sources reveal little direct involvement by these successor dukes in Swabian government. During the dispute between Konrad IV King of Germany and the papal party, with Willem II Count of Holland as its figurehead and anti-king, Swabia was largely anti-Staufen.\n\nThe reaction against Staufen control enabled the local Swabian nobility to assert their autonomy. The duchy of Swabia virtually disappeared as a territorial unit and dissolved into a collection of territorial fragments . A further difficulty for Swabia was the transfer of parts of its territory, particularly in Alsace, to neighbouring jurisdictions such as the kingdom of Burgundy and the duchy of Upper Lotharingia (Lorraine).\n\nReligious administration in Swabia centred on the archbishopric of Mainz, established by the Carolingians in 747, which also covered large areas in Saxony and Franconia. The bishoprics within the Swabian sector of the province were Augsburg (whose jurisdiction also included part of Bavaria), Konstanz, Chur and Strasbourg, all founded in the late 8th or early 9th centuries. The bishopric of Basel fell within the province of Besançon in the neighbouring kingdom of Burgundy. The bishoprics of Basel and Strasbourg were responsible for Alsace, Augsburg covered eastern Swabia, while the bishopric of Konstanz covered the area to the south-east, and Chur covered part of present-day Switzerland .\n\nChapter 1. DUKES of ALEMANNIA\n\nThe territory of Alemannia was invaded by the Merovingian Franks but was able to preserve semi-autonomy. The dukes of Alemannia were finally vanquished by maior domus Pepin [III] (later Pepin King of the Franks) who placed Alemannia in the hands of Counts Ruthard and Warin . After the death of Charles \"Martel\", the territory rebelled against the Franks, but maior domus Carloman laid waste to Alemannia in 742 . The family relationship between the early dukes of Alemannia has not been confirmed by the primary sources so far consulted. The Alemannian dukes are frequently referred to as \"Etichonen\". Any famly connection between them and the Etichonen noble family in Alsace has not yet been identified.\n\n1.LIUTFRED (-587 or after). Duke of Alemannia.

It is not certain that \"Burchardi\" refers to the duke of Swabia, although the charter is dated during the period during which the title dux was not consistently used in contemporary documentation and no other Burkhard has yet been identified to whom it can refer. He was killed during an expedition to northern Italy in support of his son-in-law Rudolf King of Burgundy . Herimannus records that \"Burghardus dux\" was killed in 926 .

The Chronicon Salernitanum records that \"comes Alemannorum Saxonumque Cono Cuneus alius validus missus\" fought against the Greeks in southern Italy in [969] . Jackman suggests that this refers to the future Konrad I Duke of Swabia, on the basis that \"Saxonumque\" is added because of his supposed wife's Saxon origin, in addition using this reference to date the couple's marriage . He succeeded in 983 as KONRAD I Duke of Swabia. Graf im Rheingau 985 and 995. Graf im Ufgau 987. Graf in der Ortenau 994.

The Historia Welforum names \"filia Ottonis magnis imperatoris Richlint\" as wife of \"Couno comes\" . Jackson identifies her as daughter of Liudolf [of Saxony] Duke of Swabia, son of Emperor Otto I, but the question is not without controversy. In view of the clear statement in the Historia Welforum and the spurious charter, it has been decided to show her here as the child of Emperor Otto I despite the unreliability of these sources, but in square brackets to indicate doubt. \"Otto imperator augustus\" granted property by the spurious charter dated 13 Jan 965 to the church of Oehningen, built according to the document by \"domnus Chono comes de Oningen\" with the consent of \"uxoris sui Richlinde \" . As discussed below in relation to the supposed children of this couple, there are considerable doubts about the accuracy of information contained in this charter. The date should not therefore be accepted automatically as the basis for estimating the date of the couple's marriage. She may be \"domna Rilint\" from whom \"Heinricus rex\" acquired property \"in Halla in pago Salzburcgouui in comitatu Thiemonis comitis\", which he donated to the bishopric of Bamberg by charter dated 1 Nov 1007 .\n\nDuke Konrad & his wife had [nine] children:\n\n1.

The Annalista Saxo (apparently incorrectly) records \"Herimannum ducem\" as son of \"Udonis ducis, qui aput Calabriam cum multis occubuit, quando imperator Otto secundus contra Sarracenos pugnavit\" . The confusion may be due to Thietmar describing Duke Hermann as \"matris meæ avunculi filius\" , without specifying which \"avunculus\" to whom this refers. He was installed in 997 as HERMANN II Duke of Swabia. A majority of south-western magnates supported Duke Hermann's candidacy for the imperial throne in 1002 after the death of Emperor Otto III, but acknowledged the accession of Heinrich Duke of Bavaria as king of Germany in Oct 1002 .

The primary source which confirms his parentage has not yet been identified. He was installed as Duke of Swabia in 1057 by Agnes de Poitou, widow of Emperor Heinrich III . Frutolf von Michelsbergs Chronicon Wirziburgense records in 1057 the death of Otto de Svinfurte dux Suevorum IV Kal Oct and the appointment of Ruodolfus de Rinveldon qui postea rex esse contendit . He became rector of Burgundy, entrusted with the administration of the kingdom, in 1060 . He introduced the stricter monastic rules from Fruttuaria into the monastery of St Blasien in 1072. He was one of the nobles opposed to his brother-in-law King Heinrich IV. He was elected RUDOLF King of Germany at Forcheim in Feb 1077 by the German nobility who were affronted by Pope Gregory VI's withdrawal of the order of excommunication against King Heinrich . The pope remained neutral, but after the king's defeat near Flarcheim on the Unstrut 27 Jan 1080, he renewed the excommunication of the king and impliedly declared support for Rudolf as anti-king by granting remission to the sins of his supporters .\n\na) other children: see SWABIAN NOBILITY.

He was appointed BERTHOLD I Duke of Swabia in 1079 in succession to his father, in opposition to Heinrich IV King of Germany who appointed Friedrich von Staufen to the Swabian duchy. The Chronicon of Bernold records that \"Bertaldi ducis, filii regis Roudolfi\" was besieged by supporters of King Heinrich in 1084 . The Annales Rosenveldenses records the death in 1090 of \"Bertolfus dux filius Rudolfi\" . The Chronicon of Bernold records the death in \"1090 Maio mense\" of \"Bertholdus dux Alemanniæ, filius Roudolfi regis\" .

The Genealogia Zaringorum names \"Berchtoldus\" son of \"Berchtoldus Cum-barba\", referring to him first among the brothers, specifying that he was buried at St Peter in 1111 . The Gesta Friderici of Otto of Freising records that \"Berhtolfus de castro Zaringen\" usurped the duchy of Swabia after his father-in-law died , although this does not appear to have happened until after the death of his brother-in-law. He took over the rights and estates of his brother-in-law Berthold von Rheinfelden in Swabia and Burgundy on the latter's death in 1090 . He was installed as BERTHOLD II Duke of Swabia in 1092 by Emperor Heinrich IV. He was unable to obtain effective control and in 1098 renounced his claims to Swabia in favour of Friedrich I von Staufen, although he retained the title of Duke and was enfeoffed with imperial estates in and around Zürich . Mayer says that Berthold II retained \"both the Reichsvogtei in Zürich and the title duke\" . It has not been possible to verify which view of the duke's position in Zürich is correct. He was installed in 1092 as BERTHOLD II Duke of Carinthia, in opposition to Duke Heinrich II [Eppenstein]. Together with Duke Welf IV, he organised an oath of peace at Ulm in 1093, valid for Swabia and later extended to Bavaria, to strengthen opposition to the Salian monarchy . He founded Kloster St Peter in Schwarzwald 1093. He adopted the title Herzog von Zähringen from 1100, after his family castle. The Gesta Friderici of Otto of Freising comments that Berthold held \"the empty title of duke\" without the substance . The necrology of St Peter im Schwarzwald records the death \"II Id Apr\" of \"Berchtoldus 2 dux de Zaeringen qui primus huius loci fundator extitit 1111\" .\n\nChapter 11.

The De Fundatione Monasterii Sancti Fides Sletstatensis names \"Fredericus dux Alemannorum [qui fuit Friderici ducis Swevie], qui Romani imperatoris filiæ coniugo, et duo eius fratres Argentinensis episcopus Otto et Conradus\" . \"Ottone Argentinensi episcopo\" and \"fratres mei dux Suetiæ Fridericus, Ledeuvicus et Galtharius\" donated property in \"Scelstat villa, in pago Alsatiæ et in comitatu Beirricheim\" to the abbey of Conques by charter dated 23 Jul 1095, naming \"matre nostra fratreque nostro Conrado defunctis\" . He was installed as FRIEDRICH I Duke of Swabia at Easter 1079 by Heinrich IV King of Germany. Jackman speculates that his theory concerning a possible Konradiner origin of Friedrich's mother could have justified Friedrich claiming Swabia for which no other genealogical basis is found, although this begs the question of the extent to which ducal appointments in Germany were based on family relationship in the 11th century. He built the castle of Stauf near Göppingen from which the family eventually took its name . The Gesta Friderici of Otto of Freising records his death \"in senectate\" and burial \"in monasterio Laureacensi\" .\n\nm (betrothed Regensburg 24 Mar 1079, 1089) as her first husband, AGNES of Germany, daughter of Emperor HEINRICH III [HEINRICH IV King of Germany] & his first wife Berthe de Savoie ([Summer 1072/early 1073]-24 Sep 1143, bur Klosterneuburg). The Gesta Friderici of Otto of Freising records the marriage of \"filiam unicam\" of King Heinrich IV and \"Fridericus dux Suevorum\", naming her Agnes in a later passage . In a subsequent passage, the Gesta records the second marriage of Agnes to \"Leopaldo Orientali marchioni\" . She married secondly (1106) Leopold III \"der Heilige\" Markgraf of Austria. The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis records the marriage of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\", specifying that the couple had seven children who died in infancy and eleven who survived into adulthood, six sons and five daughters . The marriage presumably took place early in the year if it is correct, as stated by Haverkamp, that it was arranged by Agnes's brother, the future Emperor Heinrich V, to obtain her future husband's support for his rebellion against their father . The Auctarium Mellicense records that Agnes, wife of \"Leopoldus marchio\", gave birth to 18 children . The Annales Magdeburgenses record the death in 1143 of \"Agnes marchionissa mater Cuonradi regis\" . The necrology of Nonnberg records the death \"VIII Kal Oct\" of \"Agnes marchionissa\" .

He succeeded his father as FRIEDRICH II \"der Einäugige\" Duke of Swabia in 1105. Regent of Germany 1116. His maternal uncle Emperor Heinrich V considered him as his successor and bequeathed him the Salian dynasty's family properties to increase his personal prestige , but on the Emperor's death in 1125 Friedrich was passed over as candidate for the German throne in favour of Lothar von Süpplingenburg Duke of Saxony whom the German nobility saw as less of a dynastic threat. After refusing to hand over his inherited crown lands to the new king, Duke Friedrich was outlawed . Friedrich eventually submitted to Emperor Lothar in 1135 with his brother.

PFALZGRAFEN von SCHWABEN\n\n1.FRIEDRICH von Büren, son of FRIEDRICH Graf im Sundergau & his wife --- (-[1068]) . The Tabula consanguinitatis Friderici I regis et Adelæ reginæ (which provided the basis for their divorce) names \"Fridericum de Buren\" as son of \"Fridericus\", brother of \"Berta\" . Pfalzgraf von Schwaben 1053. He founded the convent of Lorch.\n\n1.MANEGOLD \"der Ältere\" (-1094) . Pfalzgraf von Schwaben. Pope Celestine II granted protection to Kloster Anhausen, constructed by \"egregie recordationis Manegoldo palatino comite eiusque filiis Gualteri Augustensis episcopi Adelberto et Odelrico\", by charter dated 26 Nov 1143 . m ADELHEID, daughter of ---. The primary source which confirms her marriage has not yet been identified. She and her husband founded the convent of Langenau. She has been identified as Adelheid, daughter of Friedrich von Büren Pfalzgraf von Schwaben & his wife Hildegard. \"Hildegardis cum filiis meis, Ottone Argentinenis ecclesie episcopo Suevorumque duce Friderico, Lodewico, Walthario, Cunrado et filia mea Adalheida\" made a donation to the monastery of St Fides at Schlettstadt in Alsace dated 1094, presumably just before she died . Their father is deduced from the mention in one version of the manuscript of De Fundatione Monasterii Sancti Fides Sletstatensis of \"Fredericus dux Alemannorum [qui fuit Friderici ducis Swevie] \", a subsequent passage implying that his brothers all died before Friedrich . It is possible that this co-identification is speculative, based on the assumed transmission of the Pfalzgrafschaft von Schwaben from Friedrich von Büren to Manegold. Manegold & his wife had four children:\n\na)MANEGOLD (-[1114/25]). \"Waltherus Augustensis ecclesie minister cum fratribus meis Manegoldo, Adelberto, Odalrico\" granted privileges to Kloster Anhausen by charter dated Oct 1143 .\n\nb)ADALBERT (-[1143]). \"Waltherus Augustensis ecclesie minister cum fratribus meis Manegoldo, Adelberto, Odalrico\" granted privileges to Kloster Anhausen by charter dated Oct 1143 .\n\nc)ULRICH (-after 1123). \"Waltherus Augustensis ecclesie minister cum fratribus meis Manegoldo, Adelberto, Odalrico\" granted privileges to Kloster Anhausen by charter dated Oct 1143 ."
