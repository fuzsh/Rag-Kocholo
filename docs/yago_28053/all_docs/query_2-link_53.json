With regard to various narrative and documentary sources, the article tries to shed light of her life, to show Anna's firm integration into the family of the House of Celje and the circumstances that led her to the Polish throne. It exposes that upon Anna's arrival to Kraków she was accepted as the legitimate heir to the Polish throne and discusses the importance of her new position for the rise of the House of Celje. The article gives a short overview of Anna's rulership as a Polish Queen and at the end explores her role in the public life of the Kingdom of Poland, which, although it seems a minor one, caused her to fall into disfavour with the Teutonic Order.\n\nThe paper sheds light to life of Anna of Cilli (* 1380–1388; † 1416), second wife of Władisław Jagiełło and Queen of Poland, as outlined by the preserved sources. In the first part, it points to her firm embeddedness in the Celje family... more\n\nThe paper sheds light to life of Anna of Cilli (* 1380–1388; † 1416), second wife of Władisław Jagiełło and Queen of Poland, as outlined by the preserved sources. In the first part, it points to her firm embeddedness in the Celje family and follows her journey to Poland, highlighting that upon her arrival in Krakow she was received as a legitimate heiress to the Polish throne."
