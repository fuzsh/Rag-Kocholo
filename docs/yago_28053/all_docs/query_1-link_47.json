        "text": "There are multiple early medieval English accounts of the Jewish heroine Judith. This essay seeks to bring them together, to identify some major differences in emphasis and interest. This discussion seeks to reveal that most writers working with the text felt uncomfortable with it and sought to control it in different ways; this in turn leads to the question of what made the story so appealing – why so many Englishmen felt the need to rewrite a story they might have preferred to ignore. The final third of the essay, then, reflects on what a \"good story\" is, and the aspects of Judith that seem to make it irresistibly attractive as a project to retell in new ways.\n\nThe genre one ascribes to a literature significantly affects one’s interpretation of that text. John Frow in his book Genre writes, “Genre… [ is a] highly organized constraint on the production and interpretation of meaning… it is central to human meaning-making and to the social struggle over meaning.” That is, Genre has a crucial guiding effect in our attempt to dig out the meaning of a given text. This importance of proper genre identification becomes more crucial when dealing with ancient texts like the focus of this essay, The Book of Judith. For a casual reader, Judith gives an impression of an actual historiography that seems to recount an actual confrontation between Nebuchadnezzar’s General and Israel. However, a closer look at the text reveals various inconsistencies that strongly suggest otherwise. if not History, what then is the book’s genre? Starting from the early 20th century, there has been a tendency to treat Judith as a fiction in one form or another. Toni Craven, in a paper assessing trends in Judith studies, notes that Judith has been labeled as a historical fiction, romantic tale, and a Jewish novel by different 20th-century scholars. This tendency is also echoed by modern scholars like David A. DeSilva who, after demonstrating the complex literary structure of the book, concludes by saying “The work is better read as a piece of historical fiction”. This essay, after trying to demonstrate why we can’t take Judith as history, will try to show why the book should not be labeled as a historical fiction either and argues for “allegorical Spin-off” as a category that best describes Judith.\n\nThe apocryphal book of Judith presents us with an idealized female character. She is a beautiful, wise, devout, loyal, generous and courageous widow who saves the Israelites from, at best colonialization, at worst death at the hands of the Assyrian armies led by Holofernes. The Christian Church developed the character of Judith by associating it metaphorically with, amongst others, Mary the mother of Jesus. In the Middle Ages, visually Judith became the personification of Virtue, Chastity and Humility. By mid-sixteenth century a connection between Judith and female leading political figures was also established, since Reformation politics was largely dominated by women – specifically royals such as Catherine of Aragon; Catherine de’ Medici; Jeanne de Bourbon Queen of Navarre; Queen Christina of Sweden; the English Queen Mary Tudor, and Queen Elizabeth I, all of whom were visually connected to Judith at one point or another. Culturally, between the mid-1560s and mid-1580s the name ‘Judith’ was the second most popular name in Europe, topped only by ‘Mary’ (after the Virgin herself). Thus Judith can be said to emerge as the prototype of female empowerment, the femme forte, and women painters have shown a certain taste for depicting the biblical heroine. At the same time, however, the misogynist tradition of the ‘Power of Women’ / Weibermacht which illustrated the perceived dangerous power of women over men) was very popular mid-sixteenth century, particularly in Northern Europe, and Judith herself was a victim of it. This paper examines Italian Renaissance and Baroque interpretations of Judith as representative of the work of contemporary male and female painters, and it explores the role of gender in identity formation as present in and around the Judith narrative and its reception. What happens when women are both the object and the owner of the gaze? Are there special insights into the complexities of the biblical character? Are their representations any different to those of men? Are they perhaps manifestations of an écriture féminine (a propos Cixous and Irigaray). Or do women painters just copy their male contemporaries; their voices shut inside the Language of the Father, the spurious Phallocentric Performing Theatre of a male dominated industry? By investigating whether there are marked differences between the two gender perspectives, this paper reveals some of the signification tensions at play within the process of interpreting Judith visually."
