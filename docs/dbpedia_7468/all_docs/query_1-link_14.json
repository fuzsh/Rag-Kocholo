The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:01 a.m., in room 2322, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. W.J. Tauzin (chairman) presiding. Members present: Representatives Tauzin, Oxley, Stearns, Gillmor, Markey, Gordon, Rush, and Wynn. Staff present: Linda Bloss-Baum, majority counsel; Cliff Riccio, legislative clerk; and Andy Levin, minority counsel. Mr. Tauzin. The committee will please come to order. Let me first apologize for the absence of my colleagues. I hope some of them show up today. I think some will. We unexpectedly canceled votes for today and when that happens members tend to go home. So will have a few but not as many members as I hope. That, of course, does not mean we aren't going to have a good record made today and we are going to get a chance to do some good dialoging on this important issue. I want to particularly thank those of you who traveled long distances to be on this panel and I deeply appreciate your attendance to this issue. There is no doubt that diverse voices in mass media are an essential part of communications in a free democracy such as ours. Diversity of viewpoint is the principal champion by the First Amendment of the Constitution and it surely enriches the cultural life and the cultural values of our American society. As a result, I can appreciate, at least in principle, the notion that the FCC wishes to afford to churches, schools, civic organizations and other similarly situated groups a greater radio presence than they currently enjoy. However, I and other members have questioned the Commission's creation of the new low power FM license at this juncture as to whether it is best and the most efficient way to achieve the greatest level of diversity on our airwaves. Since the FCC announced its intention to create the new class of licenses for low power radio stations over a year ago, we have been concerned that the Commission is moving a bit prematurely. Essentially, there are two reasons for these sentiments. First and foremost, the FCC appears to have made a substantial public policy decision without seeking the advice and consultation of the Congress. The FCC is a quasi-independent agency of the U.S. Government, by law subject to Congress. Congress makes the policy that the FCC enforces. But with little regard for the opinion of the members of this committee, the Commission has now passed the final order creating these new low power radio licenses, even did so while we were out of session. It need only at this point begin reviewing and considering applications because there are no further procedures subject to comment that are left to be taken. That, I think, was an improper decision by the Commission and one that has now indeed prompted legislation filed in this session of Congress to exercise congressional authority in the area. Second, it is clear to me--and I believe this hearing will only make it clearer--that the FCC's record on this matter does not support the conclusion that the newly created licenses will not interfere with other frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum. Many have studied the policy and technical effects that the new services would create. During the official comment period, the FCC received dozens of comments from a variety of individuals and groups about the merits of the new service and its potential impact on radio broadcasting as we know it today. As we all know, in classic FCC proceedings, it is not unusual for the public comments to represent very different views as they do in this case, regarding LPFM. However, what is interesting with this issue is that the technical and engineering studies result in contrary findings as to the level of interference that the new service would create on the FM band. In our minds, it is not at all prudent to create new low power licenses when we cannot be at least reasonably sure that their creation will not result in unacceptable levels of interference. As a result, I do not believe the Commission, as the manager of our Nation's electromagnetic spectrum, has adequately served the public interest when it proceeded to create these new licenses. Furthermore, I fear that the Commission has disregarded the substantial risk that interference produced by these low power licenses once operational could instantly devalue all the licenses issued for spectrum allocation in use. Obviously, the interference issue is one that we absolutely need to get to the bottom of. I am happy we have with us today several of the engineers who conducted the interference studies in question. I hope they can explain to us in layman's terms why they have reached their ultimate conclusions regarding the technical aspects of low power FM. I want to remind you all that I studied engineering for a total of 1 whole year. Keep it in layman's terms, please. While I am discussing witnesses, let me also conclude by saying that the champion of this new service, Chairman Kinard, was invited to join us this morning to discuss the merits. Because he has said many times that this issue is one of his top priorities at the Commission, I had hoped that he would accept the invitation. I even offered to postpone the hearing until noon that he might complete his public hearing today. Nonetheless, he has declined because of commitments in Florida and that concerns me. I understand that Mr. Bruce Franca, Deputy Chief of the FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology, is here to speak on behalf of the Commission to the technical issues involved and we certainly welcome his testimony. However, I remain interested in hearing Chairman Kinard's explanation of why policy considerations led to the creation of this new service before the final report on the digital transformation of radio was complete and why there is substantial disagreement on the technical aspects of interference. He needs to address our concerns that the policies behind this service were not promulgated based on an objective assessment of the administrative record and that further congressional consideration is or is not needed. Let me say a couple of final thoughts in addition. Interference is not the only concern I have heard expressed by members of our committee. We have had some pretty tough hearings on public radio in hearings last year. There have been some pretty big disputes about the way public radio has conducted its business. Taxpayer dollars fund public radio. One of the questions that is going to be before us today is does this decision severely impact public radio. If we are going to have hundreds of thousands new community voices in every community in America addressing the special community needs of different aspects of our society, do we need to continue to put Federal dollars, public money into a radio system to do the same thing. That is a serious question. How does this decision on low power affect the audience of public broadcasting? Will it make it less supportable than the private sector as its audience is fractured away? We have raised questions about minority broadcasters. I have applauded Chairman Kinard in his efforts to alert advertisers in America about old prejudices and old stereotypes that have led them not to invest in minority broadcasting stations where audiences indeed would like to buy their products, and the light he has shown on that practice and the fact that minority broadcasters very often in our country feel like they are being discriminated in the advertising market. I have congratulated him for that good work. My concern now is that this FM license proposal may in fact again fracture that audience to the point where advertisers are less likely to invest in helping to sustain minority broadcasters in our country. I have heard similar complaints from small and independent radio broadcasters who literally are operating at margins that are difficult to sustain. The bottom line is that there are a lot of questions we needed answered today. As you know, Mr. Oxley, the vice chairman of this committee, has filed legislation on this issue that we may well take up. What we learn today will teach us a great deal about whether the Commission has acted precipitously, has acted without regard to the public interest and whether the Congress needs to step in. I look forward to hearing your testimony and the Chair now yields to the vice chairman of our subcommittee, Mr. Oxley, for an opening statement. Mr. Oxley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to all of our witnesses. I especially look forward to testimony from one of our favorites at the Commission, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a former staffer here who I understand will be joining us later this morning. First, Mr. Chairman, I want to commend you for calling today's hearing. It is timely. I believe the FCC decision to establish a new low power FM radio service raised more questions than it answered. I am pleased that we will be hearing from experts on both sides of this issue. Certainly the foremost question in my mind is the interference question. The record of public comment and technical analysis suggests to me that low power FM will cause significant interference with existing services, to the detriment of broadcasters and listeners alike. I expect that we will hear conflicting testimony on that point this morning, so I suggest that members pay close attention to the standards used in determining what constitutes unacceptable interference. As members know, I introduced legislation on November 17 to prevent the FCC from implementing rules authorizing new low power FM stations. Joining me in introducing the bill, H.R. 3439, The Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act, were Representatives Stearns, Cubin, Pallone and Ehrlich and since then, a total of 113 members of the House have co-sponsored H.R. 3439, including 20 members of this committee. I thank each of them for their support. When I introduced H.R. 3439, I did so in response to grave concerns expressed to me by radio station managers in my congressional district. I had previously written to the Commission twice with my colleague, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Stearns, to express our apprehension about low power radio and the interference it would cause. By introducing the bill, I wanted to send the additional message that there were members who were prepared to act legislatively if the Commission's final rule did not adequately address the interference question. While I will closely review this morning's testimony, after scrutinizing the Commission's action, my initial conclusion is that the new rules do not offer adequate protection against harmful interference. I am disappointed the Commission chose to weaken its interference safeguards to make room for low-power FM. This decision will undoubtedly lead to increased interference with existing stations, thereby harming loyal listeners and undercutting the value and the investment of current licenseholders. To the Commission's assertion that there will not be a meaningful increase in interference, I ask, then, why did you have to weaken your standards in the first place? I am concerned as well that the rules jeopardize the conversion to digital radio. Unlike television broadcasters who are being given additional free spectrum to broadcast in digital format, radio broadcasters must use their current spectrum allocations to transmit both digital and analog signals, making adjacent channel safeguards all the more important. I most object to the provisions making former unlicensed, pirate radio operators eligible for low power licenses, thus reinforcing their unlawful behavior and encouraging new unauthorized broadcasts in the future. My hope, and frankly, my expectation, is that the subcommittee will soon be marking up H.R. 3439. I have yet to hear an adequate reason why we should not. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Tauzin. I thank the gentleman. The Chair is now pleased to recognize the ranking minority member of the committee from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey. Mr. Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to commend you for holding this hearing today on low power radio issues. Mr. Chairman, if we were having this hearing decades and decades ago in 1915, we would have only one witness at the table. We would have said, Mr. Marconi, could you outline how we could efficiently utilize this new service? A few years after that, with the advent of television, we would have had a panel where we would have said, Mr. Farnsworth, Mr. Sarnoff, could you get together with the Marconi engineers and figure out this thing so we can launch television service? Over time, as things got more complicated and more commercial, it became a larger group of people in these conversations and it took longer for them to agree for various reasons. Interference developed. The government stepped in and decided to create a neutral agency to arbitrate disputes and efficiently allocate spectrum resources. The Federal Communications Commission has been doing this job and doing it quite well for decades. They have done their job so well, in fact, that the American telecommunications industry, including the vibrant broadcast, television, radio, cellular, PCS, microwave, satellite service and other spectrum-based services are the envy of the world. We are not content with the progress we have made thus far, however. We want more choices. That is the American way. Low power radio could meet an important need for low broadcasting, especially in light of the rapid, and in my view, unhealthy, consolidation of radio stations in individual markets after the passage of the Telecommunications Act. Clearly issues of interference need to be fully explored and worked out as was done in creating low power TV. I want to applaud the Commission for exploring this worthwhile proposal and moving forward on it. The Commission is always at its best when it takes the public's airways resources and works to make more efficient use of that spectrum for the public. There are certainly legitimate concerns about interference. At one level, that will evolve into a shouting match between engineers. Non-engineers cannot assist in resolving that debate. Yet, we can create a climate for reconciliation because in the final analysis, the effort underway is to supplement what already exists, not supplant or interfere in any harmful way with existing services. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to a discussion on relative DBU levels this morning and whatever illumination our subcommittee can gain in that area. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Tauzin. The gentleman from Chicago is recognized for an opening statement, Mr. Rush. Mr. Rush. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would first like to applaud the FCC, principally Chairman Kinard, for his creation of thousands of new stations that will ensure a diversity of voices on the airwaves. Such diversity is very much needed in our communities. These new low power FM stations will allow churches, universities, local schools, community health organizations access to a medium that has been inaccessible because of the tremendous cost. I understand that many existing FM broadcast stations are concerned that these new low power FM radio stations will cause interference with their signals and am sympathetic to these concerns, but I remain firmly committed to providing those without significant financial resources access to the airwaves. I look forward to his hearing today and to the testimony on this particular issue. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Tauzin. I thank my friend. The Chair is now pleased to welcome our panel. Mr. Markey. Mr. Chairman, may I ask unanimous consent to submit for the record a statement by Mr. Bonior in support of low power radio and ask that the record remain open for the customary period for members to submit statements and other material relevant to this issue. Mr. Tauzin. Without objection, the gentleman's consent is granted. [The prepared statement of Hon. David E. Bonior follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. DAVID E. BONIOR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN I applaud the Federal Communications Commission for creating a new class of licenses for low power FM radio stations. These non-commercial licenses will provide tremendous opportunities for educational institutions, local governments, churches, community groups and emerging artists--without interfering with existing commercial stations. I think it's important for the Subcommittee to know just how wide- spread and broad the support is for low power community radio. It is people like Kevin McGaughey in Brookland, Arkansas who would like to give children in Brookland's local public schools the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of broadcasting. It is people like Lynn Breidenbach in Lakeland, Florida whose community has no voice on either Tampa/St. Petersburg or Orlando radio. It is people like Amanda Huron in Washington, D.C. whose community group is trying to empower African- American and Latino-American youth by teaching them how to be radio disc jockeys rather than just hanging out in the streets. These are the advocates for community radio--and they are mobilized throughout our country. The FCC's decision to grant low power community radio licenses also has the support of organizations ranging from the AFL-CIO, to the U.S. Catholic Conference, to the NAACP, to the National Council on La Raza to the U.S.P.I.R.G. In my home state, the Michigan Music is World Class Campaign has secured resolutions of support from at least 45 communities. Further, musicians like Bonnie Raitt and the Indigo Girls, as well as the Louisiana Music Commission have thrown their support behind low power community radio. For those whose voices are not heard on today's cookie-cutter format radio, low power community stations are deeply wanted and much needed. The activism surrounding this issue is inspiring, and the Subcommittee would be well advised to take this groundswell of support into account. One of the fundamental tenets of our democracy is to ensure that diverse interests have opportunities to express themselves at different levels, and that they are not locked out in a monopolistic fashion by large media conglomerates. It is as fundamental as free speech. The FCC, and its Chairman William Kennard, should be commended for doing their job--protecting the public interest while at the same time giving serious consideration to the interference concerns of existing broadcasters. Providing non-profit, educational or community-based radio stations to broadcast information about local events, provide open forums for issues of the day and improve access to our airwaves-- without interfering with current FM radio stations--is the legitimate role of the FCC as stewards of our airwaves. I support their efforts to make the vision of community radio a reality. Mr. Tauzin. All members' written statements, without objection, are permitted into the record as well as all written statements of our witnesses. Without objection, it is so ordered. [Additional statements submitted for the record follow: PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. CLIFF STEARNS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA Mr. Chairman: Thank you for holding this hearing on ``Low Power FM: A Review of the FCC's Spectrum Management Responsibilities.'' I would also like to thank our witnesses for appearing before this committee and I look forward to their testimony. Mr. Chairman, for a brief moment, I thought I had deja vu. It seemed so real, you, I, and other members of this committee criticizing a government agency for exercising poor judgment and for rushing to pursue its own agenda. But then I realized this hearing is focusing on the Federal Communications Commission and lower power FM, and rather than being a dream, it's an all-too-real routine of what this committee is forced to do on a regular basis. And then I remembered I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3439, the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act, for this very reason. May I suggest to the Chairman that the Commerce Committee form a new subcommittee named ``What the FCC Shouldn't Be Doing.'' And then that committee could hold hearings on low power FM, merger review, and attacking religious broadcasters. Of course, we would be hard pressed to get anyone who would want to chair that subcommittee. When the FCC began it's journey into bastardizing spectrum integrity by adopting a Notice of Proposed Rule Making designed to establish low power FM service, many voiced concerns about the potential interference larger commercial and public stations would face from this service. Surely, the FCC would not undertake and implement a service when such an important point as interference was not conclusively resolved. Well, if you still believe that once you've read the January 20, 2000 FCC order authorizing low power FM's, then I have a low power FM station and the bridge its on to sell you in Brooklyn. Five technical studies analyzing the interference issue caused by low power FM stations have produced conflicting conclusions regarding interference on the 3rd adjacent channel. And the FCC believes that 3rd adjacent channel restrictions on low power FM stations are not needed because ``interference would be very small and would be outweighed by the benefits of the new service.'' So the additional security and protection of a 3rd adjacent channel restriction is not necessary. Sure it would be nice, but it's not necessary. Now I don't know how many of you have gone skydiving without a spare or back-up parachute . . . sure a back-up chute is not necessary to jump out of a plane, but it sure would be a nice thing to have when you are in need of one. And the 3rd channel protection is akin to a back-up chute for full power broadcasters. Sure it's not necessary, but it sure would be a nice thing to have when you are in need of one. Instead broadcasters who have invested millions of dollars into stations with the assumption the FCC would ensure the integrity of their spectrum, now have to worry about interference from a project the FCC has no idea whether will work properly or not. Why the rush to fully implement this service when many questions still remain unanswered? I am curious as to why the FCC did not select a handful of low power FM stations to experiment with this service, rather paving a road for stations to begin broadcasting in the real world when the interference question has not yet been answered. Had they done so, many of the questions we are asking today would have already been answered. Mr. Chairman I thank you for holding this hearing and will conclude by stressing that the need for substantive reform of the FCC becomes clearer by the day. Thank you. ______ PREPARED STATEMENT OF HON. TOM BLILEY, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE I want to commend the Subcommittee Chairman for convening this hearing today to explore the FCC's new Low Power FM Radio Service. I must admit, that I was disappointed at the Commission's decision to release its Order on the new class of broadcast licenses while most of us were back home with our constituents over the January recess. It is obvious by reading the testimony of today's witnesses that this issue is a controversial one that warrants Congressional consideration. I am pleased that this Committee can at least have the opportunity today, that we did not have last month, to delve into both the policy and technical issues surrounding this newly proposed service. I think that we can all agree that, thanks to new technologies and opportunities, some radio stations have begun to consolidate into commercial groups. The question is--whether these new arrangements help or hinder highly localized broadcasting in small communities and neighborhoods. In theory, I am open to new opportunities for small, local broadcasters. That said, I do strongly believe that we must preserve the signals of existing licensees who have justly earned the right to broadcast at a particular signal strength on a particular dial position. I have traditionally been concerned about signal congestion on our airwaves, particularly in large metropolitan areas. The addition of hundreds of new low power FM stations could potentially disrupt and cause interference to existing broadcasters. Several engineering studies have been conducted to test the level of interference caused by these potential new stations. However, those studies have produced vastly different results. I look forward to hearing the testimony of the technical experts before the Committee today, to get to the bottom of what these different conclusions mean. Finally, I am interested in learning more about today's alternatives, and even ideas that are on the horizon that achieve the same end as the proposed low power service. New technologies, such as Internet radio, reach targeted audiences. I hope that today's witnesses will address innovative ideas, not just more regulation. In conclusion, I hope that this hearing sheds light on the controversies related to Low Power FM. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Tauzin. Let me now introduce the panel. The Deputy Chief of the Office of Engineering, Mr. Bruce Franca, is here. We want to thank you for coming, sir. Mr. Eddie Fritts, CEO, National Association of Broadcasting, is here. David Maxon, Founder, Broadcast Signal Lab on behalf of The Lawyers Guild, is here. Mr. Bruce Reese, President and CEO, Bonneville International Corporation, Salt Lake City, is here. Mr. Theodore Rappaport, Professor, Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, whom a lot of people didn't know existed until this year, is here. My son is a senior at Virginia Tech. Mr. Charles Jackson, CEO, Jackson Telecom Consulting is here. Mr. Don Schellhardt, National Coordinator, The Amherst Alliance, is here. Mr Dirk Koning, Executive Director, Grand Rapids Community Media Center, is here. Mr. Kevin Klose, President and CEO, National Public Radio, is here. The Honorable Harold Furchtgott-Rott will be with us later. There is a public hearing, as you know, going on and he is committed to come to this hearing as soon as he completes that public hearing at the FCC this morning. In order to facilitate a demonstration this morning, the Chair will first recognize Mr. Charles Jackson, CEO, Jackson Telecom Consulting, who I believe will present to us a demonstration that will sort of frame this discussion. Mr. Jackson? STATEMENT OF CHARLES L. JACKSON, CEO, JACKSON TELECOM CONSULTING Mr. Jackson. Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, I am Chuck Jackson. I am testifying today on behalf of the NAB. I am an engineer with more than 30 years experience in the electronics and communications industry. Today, I will describe a significant flaw in the engineering that the FCC relied upon for the LPFM proceeding. Mr. Chairman, in your opening statement you said that engineers should be able to get together and agree on these interference issues. I completely agree. We are not talking about something that was invented recently; FM has been around for 50 years, the technologies of measuring it are well known, and there should not be disagreement among the engineering studies on interference. Together with Professor Raymond Picholtz of George Washington University, I reviewed four studies of FM receivers that were part of the LPFM proceeding of the FCC. Our key conclusion was that the studies differed in how they defined harmful interference. The NAB defined a harmful interference signal as one that irritates listeners and their definition matched a widely accepted international standard. The FCC's studies' definition of harmful interference went well beyond irritating to what most would consider unlistenable. Worse yet, the FCC measured interference but reported the results as if it had measured harmonic distortion, which is an entirely different impairment. The FCC then claimed that consumers would not find this distortion objectionable. They are correct. Such distortion is not objectionable. However, interference generates noise and cross-talk not distortion. Noise and cross-talk are far more objectionable to listeners than distortion. There is no support in the record or anywhere else supporting the FCC's use of distortion as the measure of the effects of interference. In fact, the FCC's claims about the harmful effects of interference approach junk science. Here are some audio clips that let you hear the types of interference we expect listeners will experience from LPFM stations. We will see if this works, we already had an equipment failure this morning. This is an unimpaired example recorded off the air with a good quality radio from WAMU, a public station in the Washington, DC area run by American University. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Jackson. Now here is that same example but with cross- talk. Remember, that is a fancy word for interference, at a level the FCC regards as acceptable if a consumer hears it over a Sony Walkman. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Jackson. Here is a different format station, classical station WGMS, the No. 1 classical station in the market, and here is an unimpaired segment that was recorded off the air. This is a quiet segment, not a real loud one. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Jackson. Here is WGMS with cross-talk, the effects of interference at levels acceptable under the FCC testing regime. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Jackson. Here is an unimpaired example from WHUR, an urban format station that is the No. 1 station in the DC market. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Jackson. Here is WhUR with cross-talk. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Jackson. The FCC says that listening to this level of impairment on a Sony Walkman would be acceptable to consumers. I believe they are dead wrong. Mr. Chairman, the FCC based its LPFM decision on misleading science. In so doing, they overrode decades of history devoted to protecting consumers from interference on the FM band. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Charles Jackson follows:] Prepared Statement of Charles Jackson, CEO, Jackson Telecom Consulting, on Behalf of the National Association of Broadcasters Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, I am Charles Jackson. I testify here today on behalf of the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB). I am an engineer with an independent consulting practice. I have experience at the FCC and have worked for more than 30 years in the electronics and communications industry--including 4 years on the staff of this subcommittee's predecessor. I earned my PhD in electrical engineering at MIT. My message is short. The FCC, as part of its Low-Power FM (LPFM) rulemaking, tested the ability of consumer receivers to withstand interfering signals on adjacent radio channels. Those tests were not reported properly. The FCC used an incorrect criterion for measuring the effects of interference and thereby provided misleading information in their order regarding the interference potential of LPFM stations. The fundamental problem is that the FCC measured interference but reported the results as if it had measured harmonic distortion. Such distortion is much harder to hear than is noise or cross-talk. Overview Below I establish the error in the FCC's criterion through references to the engineering literature, FM receiver specifications, and materials from the manufacturer of the test equipment used by the FCC. First, I describe the two measurement criteria at issue: harmonic distortion and cross-talk. Second, I play audio signals that meet the FCC's definition of ``adequate'' quality for consumers.\\1\\ After hearing these you can decide for yourself whether or not the FCC is correct in its judgment of what is adequate.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The FCC stated, ``The OET and NLG studies generally conclude that FM receivers provide for adequate rejection of interference on 2nd- and 3rd-adjacent channels.'', LPFM Order at paragraph 100. The OET test report makes it clear that the criterion for adequacy is performance with less than 3% added distortion. \\2\\ The MS Word version of this document has embedded audio objects that contain the various demonstrations. Obviously, the printed copy cannot contain these audio objects and the MS Word file with the objects is too large for some email systems. If you wish a copy of the Word document with the embedded audio, it should be available at www.jacksons.net/HSC until at least March 1, 2001. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Measuring Audio Impairments-Distortion versus Noise and Cross-talk One technical complexity intrudes. The FCC measured performance of FM receivers using a criterion called distortion or total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N).\\3\\ In contrast, the NAB recommended using a measure called signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the measure of FM receiver performance. The process of measuring these two quantities is quite similar, although the units that are used normally differ. However, THD is normally used to measure a quantity called harmonic distortion or nonlinearity. It is well known that listeners find it hard to notice harmonic distortion at levels as high as 2 or 3%. In contrast, many people can hear noise or cross-talk when it is at the level that would measure as 1% distortion (if one were improperly measuring noise or cross-talk as distortion). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ The FCC Order and the OET report consistently refer to distortion. The Audio Precision System One manuals refer to THD+N. See, for example, System One Description/Installation/APWIN Version 22 Guide, p. 2-6. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I have attached an appendix to this testimony that goes into more detail on the differences between measuring SNR and THD and how the choice of measurement units can be misleading. Examples Let me now give you a chance to listen to the difference between cross-talk and harmonic distortion. I will play an audio selection with no added distortion. I will then allow you to compare the effects of adding harmonic distortion and the effects of adding cross-talk. Here is a brief audio sample--one familiar to many--taken from Bernstein's West Side Story.\\4\\ This selection is taken from track 11 on the CD. That track has a wide dynamic range--running up to within 1 dB of full scale but also containing some quiet passages. This specific selection runs to within 3 dB of full scale. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Deutche Grammophon, 415 254-2, recorded live. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here is that same sample, but now transformed to pure harmonic distortion--all tones have been shifted up one octave using signal processing software. Here is the original, but with the distorted version added back in at the 3% level.\\5\\ As you probably notice, the added distorted element is almost impossible to hear. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ That is, the harmonic distortion is reduced in volume to 31 dB below the original signal and added back in. Because the distortion does not decline as the amplitude of the signal falls, this process results in more distortion than would occur in a typical amplifier with 3% measured distortion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In contrast, here is that same sample with cross-talk added just below the 3% level.\\6\\ The cross-talk signal was taken from another recording. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ Here the 3% less a little bit level is set to 31 dB below a full-scale sine wave as would be the case when measuring FM receivers with a single tone as the desired signal. That is, the cross-talk is set at the level that would measure just below 3% in the FCC's test of FM receivers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FCC treats these two quite different forms of impairment as if they are the same. But, as you can hear they are not. A central flaw in the FCC's analysis was the treatment of added interfering signals (cross-talk) as if they were harmonic distortion. The FCC's tests judged a signal as acceptable if interference increased the measured distortion by no more than 3%. Consumer receivers have distortion as high as 3.5%. Thus, the FCC's procedures would accept signals with cross-talk just below the 6.5% level. Here is the selection from West Side Story with cross-talk added at a level that would drive the total of cross-talk and distortion of a signal with 3.5% distortion to just below the 6.5% level. Examples from Over-the-Air Broadcasts Here is a cut recorded from WGMS, the number one classical music station in the Washington, DC, market. Here it is with cross-talk just below the 6.5% level that the FCC would judge unacceptable if the consumer were using a receiver with 3.5% audio distortion. Here is a cut from WHUR, the leading station in the DC market, with cross-talk just below the FCC limit of 6.5% total measured distortion for a radio with 3.5% audio distortion.\\7\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ These examples, and more, together with an explanation of the test set-up and parameters are available at www.nab.org. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Pickholtz/Jackson Study Professor Ray Pickholtz of George Washington University and I reviewed four studies of FM receiver performance that were before the FCC in its LPFM proceeding.\\8\\ We concluded that the tests performed by the various parties were similar; the differences in the conclusions of the studies reflected differences in the definition of harmful interference used in each study. We believe that the FCC made a mistake when they reported results in terms of distortion but they were actually measuring noise and cross-talk-signal impairments that are much more objectionable to listeners than is harmonic distortion. This is a serious error--roughly as bad as telling someone to suit up for a football game in a basketball uniform. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ This study was performed on behalf of the NAB. It is available from my website at www.jacksons.net. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Evidence from Others that Interference and Distortion Are Different The FCC's tests used a criterion, distortion, that is appropriate for measuring how good amplifiers perform but is not a good measure of the presence of objectionable cross-talk or of static. FM receiver manufacturers specify both distortion (measured in percentage just like the FCC did) and S/N ratio (SNR). For example, Sony provides the following specifications for their STR-DE835 (the top-rated digital receiver in the March 2000 issue of Consumer Reports).\\9\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ Taken from http://www.sel.sony.com/SEI,/consumer/ss5/home/ homeaudio/receivers/strde835 specs.shtml on February 13, 2000. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FM Frequency Response 30--15 kHz, +0.5/-2 dB FM THD @ 1 kHz, Mono/Stereo 0.30%/0.50% FM S/N Ratio, Mono/Stereo 76 dB/70 dB Sony specifies that the S/N ratio, the measure of how well the receiver pulls the desired signal out of the natural static, is 70 dB. In contrast, Sony specifies that the receiver's THD, a measure of how well the output stage of the receiver reproduces signals, is 0.50%. Distortion signals at the 0.50% level correspond to signals only 46 dB below the desired signal. If distortion and noise were different names for the same phenomenon, then the receiver would have a 46 dB SNR. Similarly, if distortion of 0.50% prevents one from hearing noise at levels much below 46 dB below the desired signal, Sony is wasting its efforts in delivering a 70 dB SNR. Similarly, a technical paper available from Audio Precision, the manufacturer of the test equipment the FCC used in its tests, states, ``Harmonic distortion, illustrated in Fig. 16 is probably the oldest and most universally accepted method of measuring linearity (Cabot 1992).'' \\10\\ It is well known that linearity--the degree to which an amplifier's outputs are just bigger versions of the input signals-- measures accurately an amplifier's performance and that small deviations from linearity are hard to hear. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ ``Fundamentals of Modem Audio Measurement,'' by Richard C. Cabot, Presented at the 103rd Convention of the Audio Engineering Society, New York, USA, 1997 September 26-29, revised 1999 August 8, p. 12. Emphasis added. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Audio Precision also says, Most audio Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) measurement systems are in fact Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (THD+N) analyzers. They operate by removing the fundamental from the test signal with a sharply tuned band reject or ``notch'' filter and measuring everything that remains. The amplitude of this ``residual'' is compared to the amplitude of the fundamental and the result is expressed as a percentage or dB figure. This measurement technique does not discriminate between test signal related harmonics caused by non-linearity in the device under test, broadband noise in the device under test, crosstalk or interference from external sources, or any other artifacts present within the measurement bandwidth. The ``single number'' result may thus be ambiguous.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ Audio Precision Tech Note TN-17, available at www.audioprecision.com. Emphasis added. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FCC's Use of the 3% Standard The FCC stated in its LPFM order that the OET tests did not use the 3% distortion level as the measure of harmful interference. The FCC specifically stated, The above conclusions of the OET report that ``nearly all the receivers in the sample appear to meet or exceed the 40 dB 2nd-adjacent channel criterion and exceed the 3rd- adjacent channel protection criterion by a substantial margin'' reflect measurements taken at the 1% distortion level.\\12\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ FCC LPFM Order, footnote 156. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This statement conflicts with the text of the OET study. It reads, Section 73.215 of the Commission's rules provides that the predicted field strength of a potentially interfering station can be no more than 40 dB stronger than the protected field strength along a station's protected contour. At the 3% distortion level all the receivers in the sample, except for two (samples #2 and #6), appear to meet or exceed the 40 dB second adjacent channel protection criterion and to exceed the 40 dB third adjacent channel protection criterion by a substantial margin.\\13\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ Second and Third Adjacent Channel Interference Study of FM Broadcast Receivers, Project TRB-99-3 Interim Report, July 19, 1999, p. 31. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The text in the order also reflects a basic confusion between distortion and other forms of signal impairments when the FCC states, ``The 1% level corresponds to a point at which most listeners would not be able to perceive any degradation in performance. On the other hand, the 3% distortion represents a level at which most listeners would perceive a difference in the received signal.''\\14\\ This statement is almost a textbook discussion of the effects of harmonic distortion--but does not apply to noise and cross-talk. The FCC claims that a person would find it impossible or hard to hear the effects of interference that were measured as 1% or 3 % distortion. This is incorrect. It is hard to hear 3% distortion; it is easy to hear cross-talk at the 3% power level as I just showed you.\\15\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ Ibid. \\15\\ This statement requires some qualification. It is hard to hear low-order distortion, that is 2nd- or 3rd-harmonic distortion. It is much easier to hear higher order distortion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FCC holds the entities it regulates to high standards of truthfulness (called candor in the Commission's jargon) in their statements to the Commission. It should hold to those same standards when it speaks to the public. Conclusion To summarize, the FCC used the wrong criterion when assessing the performance of FM receivers in the presence of interference. In particular, they used a measurement method that indicated no harmful interference where in fact, harmful interference would occur. This use of the wrong criterion has led to justification for the authorization of LPFM stations that will result in objectionable interference to existing radio stations interference that the FCC does not acknowledge because it has not used the relevant measurement tool. APPENDIX: MEASURING AUDIO IMPAIRMENTS First, subjective testing--the use of a panel of listeners to compare and grade the performance of alternative systems--is the gold standard of audio system evaluation.\\16\\ Second, although they may be the gold standard, subjective listening tests are, like gold, very expensive--requiring significant time and staff. Consequently, other objective test methods have been developed. These objective measurements may or may not be monotonically related to subjective quality, but they are close enough for many applications. A primary measurement used to assess the performance of analog broadcasting and recording systems is the audio or output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This ratio compares the energy in the desired signal with the energy in the obscuring or impairing noise signal. Often the SNR is calculated using a weighting procedure that attaches more weight to noise at the most easily heard frequencies and less weight to noise at frequencies that are less irritating. Informally speaking, SNR is a measure of the static that has been added to a signal. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ It may seem strange to some that engineers rank a subjective test as the highest performance standard. Despite stereotypes, engineers actually have normal endowments of common sense and they recognize that the proper measure of a system designed to serve consumers is the consumer reaction to that system. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 1 below shows SNR for some familiar audio systems. In this table, a higher number is better and SNR is reported in dB--a logarithmic measure that matches well with the human hearing process. A difference of about 3 dB in SNR is usually regarded as the smallest size difference a typical observer will notice. Thus, there is not much difference in the typical subjective evaluation of the performance of two audio systems--one operating with 40-dB SNR and the other with 43- dB SNR. However, there is a big difference between a system operating with 40-dB SNR and one operating with 60-dB SNR. TABLE 1--Signal-to-Noise Ratio for some Familiar Audio Systems ------------------------------------------------------------------------ System Approximate SNR ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Compact disc....................................... 100 dB Sony Walkman digital audio tape.................... Better than 87 dB FM broadcasting (best conditions).................. 60-80 dB Consumer audio taping equipment \\17\\............... 60 dB Telephone call..................................... 30-50 dB ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\17\\ For example the Sony TC-KE500S. A second measure of audio system performance is harmonic distortion. Harmonic distortion is most often used to measure the performance of audio devices such as amplifiers or recording systems. It is a measure of how accurately an audio system reproduces the input signal. Harmonic distortion is often used to characterize the performance of amplifiers. It is caused by nonlinearity in the amplification chain that creates frequency components that are harmonics of the original frequencies (integer multiples of the original frequencies, also called overtones). If the output signal from an amplifier is the same as the input signal, except bigger, then there is no distortion. With music or pure tones, distortion can be noticed by the presence of overtones. For example, if a real-world amplifier has as input a 1,000-Hz tone, the output will consist primarily of a 1,000-Hz tone, but tones at 2,000 and 3,000 Hz (and other frequencies) will also be present in the amplifier output. These unintended overtones produced by the amplifier are called harmonic distortion. It is hard for the human ear to hear harmonic distortion. The human ear's response to a 2,000-Hz tone is reduced when a strong signal is also present at 1,000 Hz. Similarly, people often think they hear a sound at 2,000 Hz when they only hear a sound at 1,000 Hz.\\18\\ Most music sources, such as a piano or violin note, contain overtones that are only slightly modified by the overtones created by distortion. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ See, for example, A. Gersho, ``Advances in speech and audio compression,'' Proceedings of The IEEE, vol. 82, pp. 900-918, June 1994. P. Noll, ``Wideband speech and audio coding,'' IEEE Communication Magazine, vol. 26, pp. 34-44, November 1993. J.J.N. Jayant and Y. Shoham, ``Coding of wideband speech,'' Speech Communication, vol. 11, pp. 127-138, 1992. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hence, given both the reaction of the human hearing system and the content of most music, harmonic distortion is harder to hear than unrelated noise.\\19\\ It is generally accepted that harmonic distortion has to rise to about 1 to 2% before people find it objectionable.\\20\\ Some people would find 1% harmonic distortion hard to notice.\\21\\ The nonlinearities in the signal processing chain that cause harmonic distortion also cause intermodulation distortion that produces other, unintended frequency components. The usual test procedures for audio equipment use the measure of total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) as shorthand for all nonlinear impairments. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ It is easier to hear someone cough at an orchestra concert than to tell that one of the violinists is playing an octave high. Indeed, everybody in the audience can hear the person coughing, but only audience members with unusual musical acuity will notice that one violin is an octave high. \\20\\ See H.F. Olson, Elements of Acoustical Engineering, Van Nostrand, New York, 1947 as quoted in Electronics Engineers' Handbook, 2nd Edition, Donald G. Fink and Donald Christiansen, eds., McGraw-Hill, 1982, at p. 19-18. \\21\\ While engineers are good, they are not perfect. Engineers often use different units to measure SNR and harmonic distortion. Although SNR is normally measured as a power ratio and expressed in dB, harmonic distortion is often measured as a voltage ratio and expressed in percent. This notational difference makes it harder for the nonexpert to keep track of what is going on in the four studies we consider. This confusion adds an unintended shell-game element to reading the engineering studies in the FCC's LPFM rulemaking. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although it may be possible, albeit rare, for interference to drive the signal into the nonlinear region and cause harmonic distortion, that is not usually the principal concern when considering the effects of interference. Interference is best treated as a different, extraneous source of additive noise. Thus, we measure its effects by considering the signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SNIR). The noise we refer to here is due to thermal, environmental, or receiver noise that we cannot overcome and is not the interference from like signals residing in a co- or adjacent channel. The interference of concern here is external and produced by other emissions in the radio spectrum by other than the desired transmitter. It is what can be controlled by regulation. It is therefore our considered opinion that the deleterious effects caused by this interference must be measured. Other undesirable effects, inherent in the imperfections in the signal chain may also be present, but they are a red herring when the objective is to determine whether controllable external additional emissions such as second and third adjacent channel interference should be permitted to degrade expected reception quality. Mr. Tauzin. Thank you very much, Mr. Jackson. We will now hear from the FCC, the Deputy Chief, Office of Engineering and Technology, Mr. Bruce Franca. STATEMENTS OF BRUCE A. FRANCA, DEPUTY CHIEF, OFFICE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION; EDWARD O. FRITTS, CEO, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTING; DAVID MAXON, FOUNDER, BROADCAST SIGNAL LAB; AND BRUCE T. REESE, PRESIDENT AND CEO, BONNEVILLE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION Mr. Franca. I think Mr. Jackson is right. I think we have just heard about junk science. Let me go on and talk a little bit. I do thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the FCC's spectrum management responsibilities and the technical aspects of the Commission's recent decision to authorize low power FM radio stations. I will briefly summarize my written testimony. Spectrum is a valuable and finite public resource. Our mission at the Office of Engineering and Technology is to develop policies that maximize the use of the spectrum, ensure that stations do not interfere with one another and promote the introduction of new services and technologies. In other words, our job is to ensure that the radio spectrum is used efficiently and effectively. To do this we have sought to encourage development and deployment of new spectrum efficient technologies. We have also promoted greater use and sharing of the spectrum. Our recent decision on low power radio is an example of this approach. New LPFM stations will share the FM radio spectrum, thereby making more efficient use of the FM band. These low power stations will allow local churches, schools, community organizations and other citizens groups new access to the airways. We are, of course, aware of the differences of opinion that exist over whether LPFM stations will cause interference to existing FM service. Based on the technical studies by our laboratory and our analysis of the studies by others, we are convinced that LPFM service as provided for under the new rules will not adversely impact full service FM stations, nor will it affect their transition to digital service. The principal issue here is over whether we should have imposed third adjacent channel restrictions on low power stations. I believe the record provides strong support that third adjacent channel restrictions are not needed and that any areas experiencing interference from LPFM would be small and that interference would be outweighed by the benefits of the new service. Initially, I would note that we currently permit certain full power FM stations to modify their facilities without regard to either second, or third adjacent channel spacings. We have not received any interference complaints with such changes. All of the technical studies show that the ability of FM radios to reject interference on third adjacent channels is much better than on second adjacent channels. This is expected since third adjacent channels are further removed from the channel to which you are tuning. The studies also generally find that automobile radios, and home stereo receivers do a good job in rejecting third adjacent channel interference and will not be affected by low power stations. NAB's test results, for example, show that car radios, where almost half of FM listening takes place, do not need third adjacent channel protection. Our analysis also shows that the area in which additional interference could occur from an LPFM station would be small and occur only in the immediate vicinity of the low power station. For example, even using NAB's test results for its three worst FM radio categories--portable, clock and Walkman type personal--the area where such receivers would potentially experience degradation from interference is small, generally on the order of one kilometer or less. There has been considerable controversy over whether signal to noise ratios or harmonic distortion is a better test of interference. We believe both measures are appropriate. However, we believe that NAB's and CEA's standards for judging FM receiver interference are too stringent since, in fact, the majority of their radios did not meet their own standards, even in the cases where no interference was present. We have seen no indication from consumers that the vast majority of FM receivers do not provide satisfactory service. We also recognize that some lower quality receivers, such as personal Walkman-type radios, may experience additional interference as a result of eliminating third adjacent channel protections for LPFM stations. However, if, for example, we were to define acceptable FM service using NAB's test results for Walkman-type radios, the service area of a Class A radio station would go from a radius of about 27 kilometers to a radius of less than 10 kilometers. We therefore believe that a poor performance radio should not be used to either define acceptable service or unacceptable interference. That is simply not good spectrum management. We also believe that consumers are smart enough to understand that there are performance differences among radios. We also disagree with NAB's criticism of our decision to use harmonic distortion rather than signal to noise. We do have a demonstration to show you what a 1-percent distortion level would sound like. These recordings use special professional material intended for critical listening. This is obviously not something you would hear on a local top forty station. This first piece is with no impairments present. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Franca. Why don't we go to the next one? This is the level we determined was interference. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Franca. This is 3 percent distortion. [Playing of sample.] Mr. Franca. We have heard that test a lot, so it is even worse for us. There is actually another series with classical music. The point is that the 1 percent distortion level we believe is an appropriate level to use to make our judgments on interference. We clearly believe that the NAB's 3 percent level is plainly objectionable. I think we have done a good job here. In concluding, I want to thank the subcommittee for the opportunity to appear before you. Please be assured that we have, in fact, made every effort to consider all the information, and there certainly was a lot of information in this proceeding. I believe that the Commission's low power decision fairly addresses the concerns of all the parties and that these new stations will not compromise existing FM service. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Bruce A. Franca follows:] Prepared Statement of Bruce A. Franca, Deputy Chief, Office of Engineering and Technology, Federal Communications Commission Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the FCC's spectrum management responsibilities and the Commission's recent decision to authorize low power FM (LPFM) stations. THE FCC'S SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES I would like to begin with an overview of the Commission's role in managing the radio spectrum. Under Section 303 of the Communications Act, which defines the general powers of the agency, the FCC is tasked with assigning bands of radio frequencies to the various classes of stations, assigning frequencies and power for individual stations, and specifying the locations where classes of stations or individual stations may operate. In addition, Section 7 of the Communications Act states: ``(I)t shall be the policy of the United States to encourage the provision of new technologies and services to the public.'' Effective management of the radio spectrum is therefore a core responsibility of the FCC. Spectrum is a valuable and finite public resource that must be allocated and assigned in a manner that will provide the greatest possible benefit to the American public. Consistent with the FCC's statutory obligations, we view our mission in the Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) as ensuring that the radio spectrum is used efficiently and effectively. One of our principle jobs is to help to define policies that maximize the efficient use of the spectrum and promote the introduction of new services and technologies. OET, for example, developed the allocation plans for cellular and PCS wireless communications services and for digital television service. Over time, technological advances, growth in user demand, and the finite nature of spectrum have made our spectrum management responsibilities increasingly complex. To address the continuing growth of demand for radio services, we have focused our approach to spectrum management on allowing spectrum markets to make more efficient use of frequency bands through new technologies and on increasing the amount of spectrum available for use. In addition, we have sought to encourage the development and deployment of new, more spectrum-efficient technologies that will increase the amount of information that can be transmitted in a given amount of bandwidth and to allow greater use of the spectrum occupied by existing services wherever possible. Under this approach, new services have been implemented either through sharing with existing operations or through reallocation of spectrum from existing services to new services and technologies. In this regard, we have, for example, developed plans for sharing between satellite and terrestrial fixed services and for recovery of spectrum from existing uses to make way for new technologies. The spectrum used for PCS service at 2--GHz was recovered from fixed microwave services that were relocated to higher bands. In addition, the efficiency of the digital television transmission standard has made it possible to plan for the reallocation of the 108 MHz of spectrum now used for television channels 52-69 to new public safety, commercial wireless, and broadcast services. LOW POWER FM RADIO I next will discuss the Commission's decision to allow the operation of low power FM stations. In its January 20, 2000, Report and Order in MM Docket No. 99-25, the Commission authorized the licensing of two new classes of low power radio stations--one operating at a maximum power of 100 watts and the other at a maximum power of 10 watts. The new LPFM stations will be licensed to operate on a noncommercial educational basis only, and to parties that do not hold an attributable interest in any other broadcast station or media. The rules also provide for a significant preference to locally based applicants. The Commission has taken a conservative approach in protecting existing FM service. For example, the Commission did not adopt its original proposals to permit 1000 watt, commercial LPFM stations and to allow LPFM operations on 2nd adjacent channels. In addition to specifying low power operation, the rules provide a number of other safeguards to protect existing FM stations, such as limitations on antenna height and separation requirements for low power stations with respect to full power stations operating on the same channel, on 1st and 2nd adjacent channels, and on intermediate frequency channels. We also added a 20 km buffer to the required separation distances between LPFM and full service stations that are operating on co- and 1st adjacent channels. This buffer will provide an additional margin of protection for full power stations that modify or upgrade their facilities. We did not, however, impose requirements for separation of LPFM stations from stations on 3rd adjacent channels. From the considerable technical record in our proceeding, we found that LPFM operation on 3rd adjacent channels will not result in significant new interference to the service of existing FM stations. Our discussions with, and comments from, proponents of new digital radio technologies also indicate that LPFM operations on 3rd adjacent channels will not impact potential future digital services in the FM band. (See attached illustration of 1st, 2nd and 3rd adjacent channels on the FM radio dial.) [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2973.001 Our decision in this matter followed a nearly one-year long public comment period extended four times between January and November 1999. We granted these four extensions at the request of the broadcasting industry, at times over the strong opposition of other parties in the proceeding. We did so to give broadcasters and all other parties a more than ample opportunity to comment on the proposed LPFM service. During this lengthy comment period the Commission received significant expressions of interest and public support for LPFM service. The Commission received comments and letters from thousands of individuals and groups seeking licenses for new radio stations. These comments--from churches or other religious organizations, schools, colleges, students, community organizations, musicians and other citizens--reflected a broad interest in, and need for, service from highly local radio stations that are strongly grounded in their communities. The plan for LPFM service adopted by the Commission will address these needs by enhancing listeners' access to locally focused, community-oriented radio broadcasting. In providing for the operation of LPFM radio stations, we have followed the principles of our general approach to spectrum management: the new LPFM stations will share the FM radio spectrum with existing stations, thereby making more efficient use of the FM band. In establishing this service, the Commission was also following two longstanding foundation principles under Section 307(b) of the Communications Act in providing spectrum for broadcast use. The first is to promote a diversity of media voices. The second is to adopt policies that facilitate and encourage the operation of broadcast services that meet local needs and specialized interests wherever possible. Consistent with these principles, the Commission's first goal in establishing a new LPFM service was to create a class of radio stations that would serve very localized communities or underrepresented groups within communities. This new service will enhance service to the public by providing service opportunities for parties who had previously been denied access to broadcast spectrum. A second, specific, goal was that the LPFM service include the voices of community-based schools, churches, and civic organizations. The Commission in planning for the LPFM service also emphasized that it would not compromise the integrity of the FM radio spectrum. The Commission was particularly cognizant of the concerns of FM broadcasters with regard to both existing service and possible options for FM stations to provide digital service. Addressing these concerns, the Commission stated that it was determined ``to preserve the integrity and technical excellence of existing FM radio service, and not to impede its transition to a digital future.'' In this regard, the principal technical issues in this proceeding have been the potential for new low power stations to cause interference to existing FM radio service and to impact future digital radio technologies, such as In-Band On-Channel, or ``IBOC,'' systems. Based on our own technical studies and analyses of studies by a number of others, we are convinced that LPFM service, as provided under the new rules, will not adversely impact reception of full service FM stations, nor will it affect the transition of these stations to digital service using IBOC technology that transmits digital signals on adjacent channels. Third Adjacent Channel Protection Is Not Necessary Of course, I am aware of the differences of opinion that exist, particularly on the part of full service FM stations and their representatives, over whether LPFM stations will cause interference to existing FM service. The principle issue here is over whether we should have imposed 3rd adjacent channel restrictions on LPFM stations. The main determinative factor is the ability of FM receivers to operate satisfactorily when signals from LPFM stations are present on 3rd adjacent channels. I believe that the record provides strong support that 3rd adjacent channel restrictions are not needed for LPFM and that any areas experiencing interference would be very small and would be outweighed by the benefits of the new service. Initially, I would point out that during the period from 1964 to 1987, pre-1964, ``grandfathered,'' short-spaced full power FM stations were permitted to modify their facilities without regard to either 2nd or 3rd adjacent channel spacings. No interference complaints were received as a result of such modifications, and this policy was re-instituted in 1997, again without subsequent interference complaints. Similarly, in 1991, the Commission decided to accept small amounts of potential 2nd and 3rd adjacent channel interference in the noncommercial FM service where such interference is counter-balanced by substantial service gains. Technical Studies In addition to these historical precedents, the technical data submitted in the proceeding also supports the conclusion that 3rd adjacent channel restrictions are not needed to protect full service FM stations from LPFM operations. As you are aware, three technical studies of FM receivers were filed in response to the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making. These studies were submitted by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), and the National Lawyers Guild (NLG).1 In addition, our Office conducted its own study of a sample of 21 FM receivers. Taken together, the studies examined 75 consumer FM radios of various types and performance capabilities, including automobile radios, component tuners or receivers, portable radios such as ``boom boxes,'' personal radios such as ``Walkman'' type units, and clock radios. Finally, the NAB and CEA filed supplementary technical information in their reply comments, and the Media Access Project submitted in its reply comments a Technical Analysis of the Low Power FM Service prepared by Professor Theodore Rappaport, James S. Tucker Professor of Electrical Engineering, Virginia Tech, and Chairman, Wireless Valley Communications, Inc., Blacksburg, Va. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See FM Interference Tests, Laboratory Test Report, Thomas B. Keller, Robert W. McCutheon, Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), conducted under the auspices of National Public Radio (NPR), CEMA and the Corporation of Public Broadcasting (CPB); Technical Studies and Reports filed by the National Association of Broadcasters; and, Receiver Evaluation Project conducted by Broadcast Signal Lab, LLP for the National Lawyers' Guild, Committee on Democratic Communications. CEMA has since become the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These studies provide a substantial body of information on FM receiver performance in the presence of interfering signals. Unfortunately, the studies used different methodologies that make direct comparisons between them difficult. However, as the NAB stated in its reply comments, the significant differences among the studies were not in the measurements or in the performance of the radio receivers tested, but rather, in the definition of impaired reception. We generally concur with that assessment and believe that the most significant differences in the conclusions of these studies are the result of variations in the definitions of desired service and when the desired service is impaired. NAB/CEA Criteria Are Inappropriate for Today's FM Service Both CEA and NAB, for example, generally find the performance of today's FM radios unacceptable because they do not meet their presupposed desired levels of performance. For example, 17 of the 28 radios tested by the NAB failed to meet its standard of 50 dB audio signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) performance with no interference present and with the ``strongest'' desired signal level tested.2 Similarly, CEA reports that none of its sample receivers ``came near meeting'' its 45 dB S/N performance target at the current FCC protection standards for full power co-channel stations. While such performance levels may indicate more interference from prospective LPFM stations, we fail to see how such levels can be appropriate measures when most radios do not perform to these levels, even in the absence of any interference, as was the case in NAB's tests. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Signal-to-noise (S/N) is one of the ways to characterize audio quality. It is the measure of the relative volume of the desired sound to the noise that may be present in the system. Noise manifests itself as ``hissing'' or static. A higher S/N ratio indicates better audio quality. A lower S/N ratio means the output will sound noisier. S/N ratio is measured in decibels or dB, a logarithmic expression of ratios. For example, 10 dB means that the signal is ten times stronger than the noise and 20 dB means that the signal is 100 times greater than the noise. To meet the NAB 50 dB S/N criterion, the volume of the desired sound would have to be 100,000 times stronger than the volume of the noise. Since many of the radios tested by NAB did not meet its 50 dB value, NAB also employed a degradation in S/N of 5 dB as a measure when the desired service is impaired. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Moreover, we have seen no indication from consumers that they find that the vast majority of FM receivers do not provide satisfactory service. Therefore, as stated in our Report and Order, we do not find the S/N levels suggested by CEA or NAB to be appropriate interference criteria for today's FM radio service. We also note that a previous study by the NAB indicated that the current FCC co-channel protection requirement for FM stereo yields an audio S/N of about 30 dB, not the 50 dB suggested by NAB in its technical study. 3 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ See NAB study entitled, ``Subjective Evaluation of Audio Degraded by Noise and Undesired FM Signals'' by Lawrence C. Middlekamp, November 17, 1982, cited in para. 97, p. 38, of the FCC's Report and Order in MM Docket No. 99-25. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Receivers Are Better at Rejecting 3rd Adjacent Channel Interference Notwithstanding the differences among the technical studies regarding performance standards, there are important consistencies in the study results that we find support a conclusion that 3rd-adjacent channel restrictions are not needed for LPFM stations. All four studies show that the ability of FM radios to reject interference from signals on a 3rd adjacent channel is generally much better than from interference from signals on a 2nd adjacent channel. This is to be expected since 3rd adjacent channel is further removed from the desired channel to which you are tuning. (See again the attached illustration.) The OET and NLG studies generally conclude that FM receivers provide for adequate rejection of interference on 2nd and 3rd adjacent channels. The OET study, for example, finds that nearly all of our receivers appear to meet the 2nd adjacent channel protection criteria and exceed the 3rd adjacent protection criteria by about 8-10 dB, a wide margin. While CEA and NAB argue that their studies show that the adjacent channel protections should be retained, a review of CEA's results shows that its median receiver provides about -40 dB of rejection of 3rd adjacent channel interference, and that this margin of performance is about 3 to 7 dB better than 2nd adjacent performance for its sample. Similarly, the NAB tests also show 3rd adjacent channel performance to be substantially better than 2nd adjacent--on the order of 8 to 10 dB. This means that radios can generally reject signals on a 3rd adjacent channel that are about six to ten times stronger than signals on 2nd adjacent channels. The studies also found that automobile radios and home stereo/component receivers tend to be more effective at rejecting adjacent channel interference than clock, personal and portable radios. Our examination of the studies indicates that automobile radios and home stereo/component receivers generally are able to provide -40 dB or more rejection of 3rd adjacent channel signals and therefore generally will provide acceptable service in the absence of 3rd adjacent channel protection. NAB's test results, for example, show that FM radios in automobiles, where most FM listening is done, meet the current -40 dB criteria. We also recognize that poorer quality receivers, such as personal and clock radios, may experience some additional interference as a result of eliminating the 3rd adjacent channel protection for LPFM stations. We note, however, that these classes of radio may also experience some degree of interference from co- and 1st adjacent channel full power FM stations operating within the existing protection requirements. We also believe that consumers generally understand that there are performance differences among the classes of radios and that they accept the fact that lower cost radios may provide more limited service capabilities. We therefore believe that our decisions with regard to LPFM service should not be constrained solely by the performance limitations of lower cost radios any more than we should use those radios to redefine existing FM radio service. For example, if we were to define acceptable FM radio service using NAB's performance measure and NAB's median test results for personal radios--the radius of a 6 kilowatt Class A radio station's protected service area would go from 27.5 km to less than 10 km. This is because such radios do not provide acceptable service as defined by NAB beyond about 10 km, even in the absence of any interference. I do not believe that this is a realistic approach, as this would ignore service provided to radios that provide more typical performance, and would unfairly reduce the station's expected audience reach. Potential Interference from LPFM is Small We also found that the area in which any additional interference would be likely to occur from an LPFM station operating on a third adjacent channel at maximum facilities of 100 watts and antenna height of 30 meters above average terrain would be very small and occur only in the immediate vicinity of the LPFM station. For example, even using NAB's median receiver performance test results for its three ``worst'' FM radio categories, i.e., clock, personal and portable, we find that the area where such receivers could potentially experience degradation from interference is small, generally 1 km or less. This interference analysis is shown in the following table: LPFM Potential Interference Radius Based on NAB Tests ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Desired Signal Level -------------------------------------------------------------------- Receiver Category -45 dBm (Close to -55 dBm (~Principle -65 dBm (~Protected Station) Community) Service) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Clock...................................... 0.3 km (0.2 mi.) 0.7 km (0.4 mi.) 2.1 km (1.3 mi.) Portable................................... 1.0 km (0.6 mi.) 0.9 km (0.6 mi.) 1.0 km (0.6 mi.) Personal................................... 0.4 km (0.3 mi.) 0.5 km (0.3 mi.) 0.5 km (0.3 mi.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The above Table shows the approximate radius around an LPFM station where interference could potentially occur to a 3rd adjacent channel full service station with different types of radios, based on the NAB test data. As indicated in the Table, the area of potential interference depends on the type of radio used and on whether the LPFM station is located relatively close to the ``desired'' full power station, i.e., at the -45 dBm contour, or whether the LPFM station is at the edge of the full power station's service area, i.e., at the ``65 dBm contour. For example, if an LPFM station is located about 9 or 10 km from a 3rd adjacent channel Class A full power station (-45 dBm), a listener using a clock radio located about 0.3 km (about 1000 feet) from that LPFM station could experience some degradation in service. If the LPFM station is located at the edge of service of the full power station, the radius of potential interference would increase to about 2.1 km. Alternatively, if the listener were using a personal or ``Walkman'' type radio at the edge of coverage of the full power station, the potential interference area would have a radius of about 0.5 km. It should be noted, however, that the actual audio S/N value that NAB uses to ``define'' where interference begins would be different for these two cases. For clock radios, interference at the edge of coverage would be said to begin to occur at a value of 41.5 dB S/N. This is a level we believe that most listeners would find more than acceptable for clock radio use. In the case of the personal radio, the value would be 20.3 dB, which may indicate, as discussed above, that these radios are not providing satisfactory service out to the protected contour of a full service station. Further, we believe that this analysis provides a conservative estimate of the actual interference potential of LPFM, given NAB's performance criteria and the fact that NAB's sample included some of the poorer performing radios among the four studies. In addition, whether interference, in fact, occurs to FM listening depends on a number of factors, besides the performance of the FM receiver. These include, among other things, the actual reception conditions, such as the location and position of the radio, the frequency and location of both the desired and undesired stations, and the type of program material being transmitted and received. CEA noted, for example, that when the desired signal was modulated with rock music the interference was masked in its 2nd and 3rd adjacent channel subjective tests. CONCLUSION Based on the record before us, we therefore found that LPFM stations operating with 100 watts power or less on 3rd adjacent channels would not result in significant new interference to the service of existing FM stations. The Commission also concluded that any small amount of interference that might occur would be outweighed by the benefits to listeners from the new services to be provided by LPFM stations. With regard to 2nd adjacent channel protection requirements, we concluded that, since receiver performance appears to be only at about the same level as that provided in the rules, the risk of interference from LPFM signals on 2nd adjacent channels may be somewhat higher. We therefore applied 2nd adjacent channel separation requirements to these stations that are consistent with the -40 dB standard reflected in the current FM rules. In concluding, I want to express my gratitude to the Subcommittee for the opportunity to appear before you today. The Commission understands and shares the industry's concerns for protecting the integrity of the FM band. Please be assured that we have made every effort to consider all the available information in this matter. I believe the Commission's LPFM decisions fairly address the concerns of all interests and that this new service will not compromise existing FM service. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. Mr. Tauzin. Thank you very much. When we do get to Q & A, I will ask each of you to comment on each other's demonstrations. I think that would be very constructive for us. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Fritts for his statement. Remember, all witnesses, we have your written statements, so please try to conclude in 5 minutes if you can. Mr. Fritts? STATEMENT OF EDWARD O. FRITTS Mr. Fritts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am not an engineer and you will not hear about DBUs and 1 and 3 percents. We appreciate you holding this hearing early in the session to focus on what we believe will be the impending disaster of the FCC's low power FM rule which is about to take place. Let us put things in perspective. There are 12,000 radio stations licensed in the United States now. To sort of get a grip on that, there are only 18,000 Burger King franchises in the world and there are 12,000 radio stations in the United States now. I have been President and CEO of NAB for some 18 years and prior to that, for more than 20 years, I was a licensee and group owner of a number of radio stations in the south. Never before have I seen the FCC act with such willful disregard for Congress or to turn its back on the spectrum integrity they were trusted to oversee. I am not an engineer but what I heard Mr. Franca say, and I have great respect for him, is that yes, we are going to cause interference and we hope that you will accept it. This is a case where I believe the FCC has abandoned its historic mission and really and truly forgotten the American consumer. Congress established the communications regulations back in 1927 to ensure clear, interference-free radio service and to end the technical chaos on the airways which existed through the 1920's. Back in the early 1980's, ignoring this obligation, the FCC at that time decided that it should reduce the interference protections for FM radio to add thousands of new stations in the name of diversity. That proceeding, now the infamous Docket 80-90, only created the opportunity for radio stations to fail. I might add that 2,500 new FM stations have been added since that time. By the early 1990's, more than 60 percent of all radio stations were losing money. The FCC's misguided plan, in part, resulted in the Congress' decision to deregulate radio ownership back in 1996. There is no demonstrated need in the record that supports the establishment of LPFM stations, but I am sure if you were to ask people on the street, would you like to have your own radio station, most everyone would say yes. By using that logic, pretty soon when babies are born, we will be handing them their own radio license along with their social security card. Think about this for a moment. For decades, the policy at the FCC has been that low power radio stations are an inefficient use of the spectrum. In fact, the Commission has developed an extensive and detailed record and consistently rejected proposals to create low power radio services. Just 5 years ago, the FCC said that low power radio, ``would lower the quality of FM broadcasting service.'' LPFM will simply create islands of service in a sea of interference. Although the laws of physics have not been repealed, the FCC has clearly turned this longstanding policy on its head. The FCC says it is doing this to increase diversity but the evidence of our study and of an FCC study shows that listeners get more formats now than before consolidation began in 1996. The trend is increasing. As one example, there were only 400 Hispanic radio stations in the United States in 1996; now there are 600. The FCC's goal of creating more diversity is laudable and we certainly support that, but this low power decision will not solve that problem. The FCC claimed that the demand for the new service is greatest in highly populated areas. We all recognize that but they have also acknowledged that there will be few, if any, LPFM stations located in those major metropolitan areas. It just won't happen. Instead, most of the stations will be located in small markets where vacant, full power allocations go begging now. As Commissioner Michael Powell pointed out, ``It is the current FM stations in those very small markets, including stations run by women and minorities, that could suffer most from LPFM.'' As the Commissioner stated, ``It would be a perverse result indeed if these stations were to fail or the quality of locally originated programming suffered because new LPFM stations diluted their already tenuous base of support.'' Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth called the FCC's decision ``a rush to judgment.'' I call it a rush to create interference before the Congress finds out about it. The vice chairman of this committee, as noted this morning, Mr. Oxley and his colleague, Mr. Pallone, have introduced legislation to stop this ill-fated proposal. He currently has 113 co-sponsors. Given the FCC's unwillingness to follow its core obligation to protect the spectrum, I see no other option than for Congress to say no to low power FM. Wrapping up, Mr. Chairman, you and other members of the committee and this Congress will stand up for your constituents and the listeners to local radio stations who depend on local radio for entertainment, news, weather and sports. The time to move H.R. 3439 is now. We hope you will do it as soon as possible and send a powerful message to the FCC. That message is, we will not allow politics at the FCC to disrupt local radio service. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Edward O. Fritts and Bruce T. Reese follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF EDWARD O. FRITTS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS AND BRUCE T. REESE, PRESIDENT AND CEO, BONNEVILLE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION INTRODUCTION Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to appear before the House Telecommunications Subcommittee today. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) represents the owners and operators of America's radio and television stations. Our remarks today will address the Low Power FM (LFPM) Radio Service adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on January 20, 2000.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Report and Order in MM Docket No. 99-25, Creation of a Low Power Radio Service, adopted January 20, 2000; released January 27, 2000. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FCC has a fundamental obligation under Section 1 of the Communications Act to ``make available--a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide and world wide wire and radio and communication service.'' FCC Chairman William E. Kennard noted in his Separate Statement on the LPFM Report and Order that ``at the heart of this mandate is the notion of opening up new opportunities in a way that protects the integrity of existing services.'' 2 This mandate should be read in light of the history that gave rise to communications regulation in the 1920's--the need to control interference to radio service. NAB believes the FCC has abandoned its mandate and primary function of spectrum manager and has crossed over to social engineering at the expense of the integrity of the spectrum for existing FM broadcast stations and their listeners. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ See Separate Statement of Chairman William E. Kennard, Re: Creation of a Low Power Radio Service (MM 99-25) at 2. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NAB fully supports H.R. 3439, a bill that would rescind the FCC's newly adopted LPFM rules. Representatives Oxley and Pallone, and the other 70 co-sponsors have begun an important step to undo the FCC's action in order to protect free, over-the-air FM broadcasting from further interference. Further, NAB applauds the Subcommittee for holding today's hearing in order to gain more insight into this important issue. The FCC has failed in its mandate to properly weigh the costs and benefits of its new service and rushed to judgment without taking into account the volumes of evidence in its record that point to an opposite conclusion than the one it reached. FROM THE BIRTH OF LPFM TO THE DEATH OF SPECTRUM INTEGRITY: THE FCC'S RUSH TO CREATE A NEW SERVICE Not even 13 months ago, on January 28, 1999, the FCC voted to adopt a Notice of Proposed Rule Making designed to establish an LPFM service. The FCC proposed to authorize two levels of LPFM service--1000-watt stations or 100-watt stations. It also sought comment on whether it should authorize a service with stations at 10 watts or less. The FCC proposed to drastically alter the technical rules applicable to FM broadcasting in order to ``make room'' for enough new LPFM entrants to justify its efforts in pursuing the service. The FCC asked for substantial technical evidence regarding existing FM receivers because its proposals would have a direct effect on how these radios would perform with additional LPFM stations inserted into the crowded FM band.3 The FCC proposed to loosen its interference protection separation distances to introduce more LPFM stations.
