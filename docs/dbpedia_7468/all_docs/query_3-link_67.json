        "text": "When people hear Storyhill for the first time, comparisons to the Everly Brothers and Simon & Garfunkel often pop up.\n\nJohn Hermanson, one-half of the Minnesota-based acoustic duo, appreciates the praise, but \"I think people make those comparisons because we're a duo. I think our writing and artistic perspectives are actually not much like either of those groups.\"\n\nListeners can judge for themselves when Hermanson and longtime friend Chris Cunningham appear 7:30 p.m. Friday at Holley Hall in Sarasota. The concert benefits community radio station WSLR-LP 96.5.\n\nLast year was good to Storyhill. Their self-titled Red House Records album, produced by former Semisonic frontman Dan Wilson, was met with raves from rock writers; they turned heads at the South By Southwest Music Conference in Austin, and they won the coveted Grassy Hill Kerrville New Folk Contest in Texas. The contest has helped launch the careers of such artists as Steve Earle, Nanci Griffith, Lyle Lovett, Robert Earl Keen, Tish Hinojosa and John Gorka.\n\nYou two have been friends since high school. But Chris moved to Spain and you went to college. Was it hard to rekindle the creative spark the second time around?\n\n\"Chris was only in Spain for one year before joining me at St. Olaf (College). It served as a good break, I think. I played solo at St. Olaf that year and (we had) sold out of our first recording so it seemed like a good idea for us to pursue making music together again.\"\n\nHow was it working with Dan Wilson?\n\n\"Dan is a great producer. He really sets a scene for a great recording -- makes us feel less like we're recording and more like we're just playing the songs together in a room. He was really good at drawing performances out of us. Chris and I are both producers ourselves so we've grown to recognize the importance of having an outside perspective on our music. We really trust Dan with our songs -- that's important.\"\n\nHave you begun work on a new album?\n\n\"We've been working on new songs on the road and are looking to begin recording them sometime this year.\"\n\nFor the uninitiated, what does a win at the Kerrville New Folk Contest mean to an artist?\n\n\"It was a real honor to be among the songwriters at Kerrville. It was our first time down there and we were blown away by the talent there. The campfire scene at night was especially inspiring.\"\n\nWhat's the best advice you've ever received from a fellow musician?\n\n\"Get a van and tour like crazy.\""
