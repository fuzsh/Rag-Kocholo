Their size can vary depending on the weather situation.\n\nTornado Watches are usually issued for a duration of 4-8 hours and normally are issued well in advance of the actual occurrence of severe weather.\n\nDuring the watch, people should review tornado safety rules and be prepared to move a place of safety if threatening weather approaches.\n\nDuring the watch, the NWS will keep you informed on what is happening in the watch area and when the watch has expired or been cancelled.\n\nTORNADO WARNING\n\nThis is issued when a tornado is indicated by the WSR-88D radar or sighted by spotters; therefore, people in the affected area should seek safe shelter immediately.\n\nTornado Warnings can be issued without a Tornado Watch already in effect and are usually issued for a duration of around 30 minutes.\n\nTornado Warnings are issued by the National Weather Service and will include where the tornado was located and what towns will be in its path. If the thunderstorm which is causing the tornado is also producing torrential rains, this warning may also be combined with a Flash Flood Warning.\n\nAfter the warning has been issued, the affected NWS office will follow it up periodically with Severe Weather Statements. These statements will contain updated information on the tornado and they will also let the public know when warning is no longer in effect.\n\nSEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH\n\nThis is issued by the Storm Prediction Center when conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area. A severe thunderstorm by definition is a thunderstorm that produces:\n\nHail 1 inch or larger in diameter and/or\n\nWinds 58+ mph\n\nThe size of the watch can vary depending on the weather situation. They are usually issued for a duration of 4-8 hours and are normally issued well in advance of the actual occurrence of severe weather.\n\nDuring the watch, people should review severe thunderstorm safety rules and be prepared to move a place of safety if threatening weather approaches. Like with a tornado watch, the NWS will keep you informed on what is happening in the watch area and when the watch has expired or been cancelled.\n\nSEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING\n\nThis is issued by the National Weather Service when either a severe thunderstorm is indicated by the WSR-88D radar or a spotter reports a thunderstorm producing:\n\nHail 1 inch or larger in diameter and/or\n\nWinds 58+ mph;\n\ntherefore, people in the affected area should seek safe shelter immediately. Severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes with little or no advance warning. Lightning frequency is not a criteria for issuing a severe thunderstorm warning.\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Warnings are usually issued for a duration of 1 hour and can be issued without a Severe Thunderstorm Watch already in effect.\n\nSevere Thunderstorm Warnings will include where the storm was located, what towns will be affected by the severe thunderstorm and the primary threat associated with the severe thunderstorm warning. Like with tornado warnings, if the severe thunderstorm is also causing torrential rains, this warning may also be combined with a Flash Flood Warning.\n\n[ Back to Top ]\n\nDisclaimer: The above information is provided for convenience and does not constitute an endorsement of the products discussed.
