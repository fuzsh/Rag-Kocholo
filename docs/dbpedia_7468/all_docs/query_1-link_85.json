        "text": "I would encourage anyone reading this not to be afraid to reach out to the radio station team, management, or even the local DJ, because interning is a really good gateway into the industry. It gets you that in-studio experience. Maybe it’s with a promotions or marketing team that’s looking for assistance within the radio station.\n\nI think a lot of people get scared and think it’s unattainable when really it’s as simple as reaching out and seeing if there’s an internship program. Then you get the chance to learn while you’re on the job. You get the chance to observe; to be in the studio. So just reach out!\n\nAs a matter of fact, I’ve had several of my Interns, if not a vast majority of them over the years that I’ve been in radio, hit me up on social media. They just slid into my DMs on Instagram. I had some Interns back in the day who were sending me messages on MySpace. They got the opportunity to be in the studio and get involved.\n\nThat’s the gateway: look for an internship program. Some of those schools that offer broadcast journalism offer the opportunity to learn in a controlled environment. They also place a lot of their students into internship programs, or based off their curriculum and connections with radio in a particular city or market, they might find job opportunities.\n\nYou just have to be bold enough and brave enough to take that chance and hit up your favorite DJ or do some research on the station’s website and find the Program Director, and just go for it. It’s very doable.\n\nThe #1 most important thing is [to] get your foot in the door, no matter how you can. If it’s in a cluster [a group of radio stations owned by one company], you can maneuver around eventually, you just have to prove yourself. Don’t complain. Do anything that is asked of you and hang around.\n\nGo to all the smaller surrounding markets, [where] you can get actual hands-on experience. Put together a resume and go look up every station in the surrounding area and submit to any Intern or part-time job in the general area. Get in there and start doing anything and everything.\n\nGet an internship or start working part-time at any station you can, whether it be in promotions or on the street team or Board Ops. Whoever hangs around the longest, that is willing to work on the holidays, you’ll eventually get a chance.\n\nTry to find one person to take you under their wing. Eventually, let them know your aspirations, but take all your work seriously. If you do your job well, people have no choice but to respect you.\n\nYou need to know just about everything–at least a little about everything. Especially in a Top 40, pop culture world. It varies between genres. People that are on classic rock stations or adult contemporary stations don’t necessarily need to be tapped in on TikTok and Instagram as much as I need to be.\n\nMore than anything, you need to be connected with who you are and be comfortable in your own skin. As soon as you crack the mic and you’re talking to literally millions of people—and in an instance like mine on Z100, there are people from all over the globe who are listening to me—if you pretend to be someone you’re not, people are going to read right through that inauthenticity.\n\nThe more comfortable you are with owning who you are, the better you’re going to be. It doesn’t matter if you’re talking about what’s going on with Justin and his wife, or Ariana Grande’s new music video for the remix of “34+35”. I can only speak about things from my perspective, and if I try to pretend like I’m interested in something when I’m not, people are going to pick up on that.\n\nSo aside from all the technical things that you need to know, the biggest thing is to just own who you are. Be comfortable. Whether it’s quirky, intelligent, poignant: just be you.\n\n[With regard to the technical side,] we have a big mixing board that’s full of sliders which are what we call “pots.” They slide up and down and control your mic level.\n\nThe computer programs vary depending on what radio station or company you work for. The program that we use here at iHeartRadio and at Z100 is a control room computer program called NexGen. Pretty simple. It displays a playlist almost like it would on an app such as Spotify or Apple Music. It’s like a big computer screen with songs loaded onto it. It plays one song after the next, only we have a little bit more control over when to stop and start the music.\n\nThere’s another program that we use in the studio called VoxPro, and that’s like an audio recording, shortcut recording, and editing software. Whenever phone calls come through, I record them in VoxPro and edit them. That way it prevents me from putting somebody on the radio that’s gonna drop a big old curse word or say something stupid. It allows me to edit things to make them a bit more timely.\n\nWhereas with the morning show, they take live phone calls because they actually have Phone Screeners and Operators to take the calls prior to putting them on air. There’s an extra level of protection and security before that person makes it onto a live radio program.\n\nSo if you were going to call Ryan Seacrest on his morning radio show, before you get to Ryan Seacrest, you’re probably going to hit an Intern who’s going to pass you over to the Phone Operator, who’s going to coach you on what you’re going to say before Ryan Seacrest picks up the phone live on the radio.\n\nThat’s the interesting part about morning radio and night radio. I don’t have that luxury; I utilize the software that we have around here.\n\nAnd last but not least, I use other editing software when I’m doing things like recording video. I use Adobe Premiere and Photoshop when I’m doing stuff for our website or stuff for social media.\n\nThere’s a spectrum. As a Radio DJ at the number one radio station in America, I will be compensated differently to someone doing the same job, unfortunately, in a city like Sioux Falls or Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nI like to use this analogy when I talk to friends and students: it’s like a professional sport in the sense that I’m lucky enough to have made it to play for the New York Yankees of radio. Z100 is that brand. That doesn’t mean that a person who plays for the San Diego Padres is any less important to the industry. They just might not be with the biggest media brand or the biggest sports team in the world.\n\nSo, there is a scale, but the thing is, it’s like any other full-time job. You’ll be compensated. I’ve worked and been able to be in radio in various markets across the country. Money was never my driving factor. But I always made enough to survive no matter where I was. No one was shortchanging me.\n\nThe reason I did it was because I loved the connection I was able to make with the listeners through music. It’s a passion of mine, and if you’re leading with that type of mindset and that type of heart, you’re gonna be okay. You’ll get those big bucks when you’re supposed to get those big bucks. I’m still chasing some more of those big bucks!\n\nMy morning show guy makes significantly more than I do. And he’s doing the same exact thing that I’m doing. But he’s also a guy who’s been in radio for 40 years. He’s a true professional. He’s the Tom Brady of the industry. Hats off to Elvis Duran.\n\nIt’s definitely possible to make a living doing this. But again, it’s just like any other career: if that’s the reason you’re trying to get into something, to be rich and famous, you’re in it for the wrong reason. No matter if you’re a goat herder or you’re trying to be Ryan Seacrest.\n\nAs much money as that dude makes, he doesn’t do it for the money. He does it because he’s a genuine pop culture fanatic. I know it. I’ve been with him. I’ve sat next to him. That dude does not stop.\n\nSo don’t lead with that in your heart and you’ll be okay. But just know that you’re not gonna go broke, your rent’s gonna get paid, and there’s gonna be food on your table. I promise you that much.\n\nI went to school and studied speech communication—public speaking, that kind of a thing. For me, it definitely helped because I learned a lot of different techniques, a lot of persuasive techniques, and it helped me sharpen my public speaking skills.\n\nYou don’t necessarily have to go to broadcast journalism school in order to be a Radio DJ. It helps, but it’s not necessary. It helps because they’re going to teach you some of the basics of radio; the things I do on a daily basis. But this is a hands-on industry. You’ve got to dive in there and just do it.\n\nIt’s going to help if you know how to operate stuff, but it depends on which radio station you work for because the DJ software differs. If you go to school and learn how to utilize one particular brand of software and then get hired by a radio station that doesn’t utilize it, all that’s out the window.\n\nI didn’t necessarily study with the goal of working in radio when I went to school. I was just a guy who was no good at doing math and engineering and needed to find a different major. Then I got involved and dove in headfirst. I was put in the studio and was taught by my industry peers: “This is how things work. Go for it. Be yourself. Have fun.”\n\nI was lucky enough to be able to hone my skills and screw up every once in a while and press the wrong button from time to time. But you learn by doing.\n\nMaxwell (Z100, WNCI 97.9, Nick Radio)\n\nI would say the biggest thing is what I mentioned earlier: be the best you that you can be. I know it sounds cliché and cheesy, but authenticity is truly what fuels this industry. People who turn to a medium like radio looking to be entertained aren’t looking to be entertained by an imposter. They want that person’s real self. They’re gonna stick with you and become a fan of you because you are who you are.\n\nSo the moment that anyone tries to be like me, Maxwell, it’s not gonna happen. You haven’t walked in my shoes. It’s okay to emulate, and it’s okay to take some of the things that, hopefully, I do well. But be your best self.\n\nThere have been plenty of times throughout the course of my career as an African-American male that I’ve had a lot of people think that I needed to be on a hip-hop station or working in urban radio. But I’m a guy from San Diego, California–one of the most diverse cities in the world. I grew up around so many different cultures. Pop culture was something that I loved.\n\nI was just the best me that I could be, and it led to me being on the biggest pop radio station in America, despite what I may have heard along the way or what people may have thought that I should be doing. So be true to yourself. Have fun with it. Every time I say this, it sounds so cheesy but that’s just what it is.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people try to be like somebody else. A lot of people try to be like Howard Stern. A lot of people try to be like Charlamagne tha God. Those are the people that never, ever, ever, make it. And it’s exhausting too! I’ve seen it wear down so many people."
