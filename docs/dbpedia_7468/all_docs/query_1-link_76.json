        "text": "Guest Post by Travis Noonan. Author bio below. Photo credit.\n\nWe’ve said it before, communication is one of the most important factors to consider when packing your bug out bag.\n\nEmergency communications are often crucial when disaster strikes: Cellular networks get overloaded and become unavailable, infrastructure fails, and internet connections go dark. That means you need a proper emergency radio.\n\nThe Baofeng UV-5R Emergency HAM Radio\n\nWe’ve covered one of the most popular HAM radios on the market previously: The Baofeng UV-5R.\n\nRead our full Baofeng UV-5R review and walk-though in this tutorial.\n\nIf you're into prepping, you've got a Baofeng!\n\nIt’s water resistant and reasonably reliable. It has enough battery life to provide emergency communications for days, even weeks with an extended battery.\n\nMost importantly, it’ll give you access to a full band of emergency frequencies, which we’re giving the low-down on today!\n\nAmateur Radio Disclaimer\n\n“HAM”, or amateur radio, requires an operator’s license to broadcast under normal conditions (you don’t need a license to receive transmissions or to “listen in”).\n\nTransmitting with a HAM radio without a license (and call sign) is a federal offense. Rest easy: In times of disaster, enforcement is usually nullified.\n\nThose rules are in place for a reason though, airwaves can become overcrowded. It's a good idea to learn them and proper protocol.\n\nLearn how to get your radio license in this tutorial.\n\nAgain, we don’t recommend transmitting on any of the listed channels or frequencies in this guide without a license unless you’re in a true emergency situation, in which case it is acceptable to do so.\n\nMaking Programming Easier\n\nProgramming via the buttons on the radio is possible, but very slow. For small changes to menu items, or to plug in a frequency for temporary use it's fine.\n\nBut when you want to program in dozens of channels, with names, your going to want a computer to assist.\n\nThe way to do that is with the CHIRP software and a USB programming cable.\n\nDownload the CHIRP program. It's easy to use, its like a big spreadsheet more or less.\n\nA special USB programming cable is required. Get the one below, there are knockoffs out there that don't work, they don't have the correct chipset:\n\n$24Amazon\n\nAvoid the cheap knockoffs. Been there done that and they don't work.\n\nYou can also download a greatly improved version of the Owners Operating Manual here.\n\nBaofeng UV-5R Radio Diagram\n\nFirst, let’s get familiar with all the buttons, knobs, and screens on this thing:\n\nCommands, Keys & Buttons\n\nPTT (PUSH-TO-TALK): Press and hold to transmit, release it to receive.\n\nSIDE KEY1/[CALL]: Press to activate the FM radio. Press it again to deactivate. Press and hold to activate the alarm button. Hold again to deactivate.\n\nSIDE KEY2/[MONI]: Press to turn on the flashlight. Hold the key to monitor the signal (temporarily disable squelch).\n\n[VFO/MR] BUTTON: Press to switch between pre-programmed channel mode, and frequency mode.\n\n[A/B] BUTTON: Press to switch the frequency display. This will determine which of the two displayed frequencies you’re transmitting and receiving on.\n\n[BAND] BUTTON: Press to switch the band you’re operating on, which is wither VHF (136 mHz) or UHF (470 mHz). While the FM radio is activated, press to switch the FM radio bands (65-75MHZ or 76-108 MHZ).\n\n[*SCAN] KEY: Hold the button for two seconds to start scanning for active channels (channels that are transmitting). The radio will automatically stop at a frequency if it detects activity. While the FM radio is active, hold to search for radio stations.\n\n[#”KEY”] KEY: Press while in Channel mode, press to switch between High and Low transmit power. Press and hold for two seconds to lock and unlock the keypad. This is useful for when the radio is on and you want to receive communications, but you want to store the radio without button-mashing any settings.\n\n[MENU] KEY: Press to enter the main menu and to select and confirm settings (acts as “ENTER” key).\n\nARROW KEYS: Press and hold the UP or DOWN arrow keys to dial the frequency or programmed channels up or down while not in the menu. Use the arrows to navigate the menu, too.\n\n[EXIT] KEY: Press to cancel a function or exit a menu or screen.\n\nHow to Enter a Basic Emergency Frequency:\n\nYou can use the UV-5R almost immediately. It only takes a moment to turn it on and set up a basic frequency or channel to transmit and receive. Since this is likely your first time using the radio, let’s go over basic setup first.\n\nReset/“Zero Out” The Radio\n\nTo setup the radio, ensure the battery pack is snapped to the back of the transceiver. Thread the antenna onto the antenna post and tighten. Turn the radio on by rotating the volume knob clockwise. It’ll click, the radio will beep twice, and then a voice will state “Frequency Mode” or “Channel Mode”.\n\nTIP: You should zero out (reset) the radio to its default settings to ensure there are no preprogrammed settings which may interfere with emergency communications:\n\nPress MENU.\n\nUse the up and down arrows on the keypad to navigate to menu option 40.\n\nPress MENU again to select “ALL”.\n\nPress MENU a third time to select “SOURCE?”.\n\nPress MENU a fourth time to reset the radio.\n\nSelect your preferred language\n\nThe radio will reset and default to a Chinese voice. To select your preferred language:\n\nPress MENU.\n\nNavigate to menu option 14.\n\nPress MENU again to select the language selection.\n\nUse the arrows to locate “ENG” for English (or your preferred language).\n\nPress MENU again to confirm the language selection.\n\nExit.\n\nUse the UV-5R as an FM radio\n\nThe UV-5R’s most simple function is acting like an FM radio for your favorite stations. This is useful during disasters, when emergency broadcasts and information are put out through local radio stations.\n\nTo enable FM mode, just press the orange “CALL” button on the size of the radio. Scan each station available by repeatedly pressing the */”SCAN” key.\n\nEnter, save, and use an emergency frequency\n\nYou can enter a frequency and start receiving and transmitting simply by typing the appropriate numbers on the keypad. For example, typing in 162.400 will key you into the NOAA weather broadcast. Typing in 151.940 will key you into the most common national emergency channel.\n\nWe want to program some emergency channels so we don’t have to remember all the digits to every frequency we might use. To save a frequency and make a new channel:\n\nPress VFO/MR to put the radio into Frequency (VFO) Mode.\n\nPress the A/B button to select the top frequency. Note the arrow to the left of the frequency on the display, indicating your selection. All programming must be done using the top frequency.\n\nTurn off TDR/Dual Standby (it should be off but confirm it is).\n\nPress MENU.\n\nPress 7.\n\nPress MENU to select the menu option.\n\nUse the up and down arrows to select “OFF”.\n\nPress Menu to confirm.\n\nExit.\n\nType in the frequency you want to save using the keypad.\n\nPress MENU.\n\nNavigate to option 27.\n\nPress MENU again to enter the channel selection.\n\nSelect the desired channel (000 to 127) by pressing the up and down arrows. We recommend starting at channel 1, then 2, and so on. If a channel number has “CH-“ in front of it, that channel already has a frequency saved.\n\nPress MENU to save the frequency to the selected channel.\n\nExit.\n\nYou can now select the saved frequency by pressing VFO/MR to select Channel Mode, and then pressing the up and down arrows. The radio will cycle through all the saved frequencies’ channels. While in Channel Mode, the display will show two of your saved frequencies, and the channel each frequency is saved on.\n\nDelete a saved frequency/channel\n\nDeleting a frequency or channel is even easier:\n\nPress MENU.\n\nNavigate to option 28.\n\nPress MENU to enter channel selection.\n\nSelect the channel/frequency you wish to delete.\n\nPress MENU again to delete it.\n\nExit.\n\nSearch for active frequencies and transmissions\n\nYou may find yourself in a disaster situation with no known frequencies or channels. If this happens, you can still use the UV-5R to pick up emergency communications by using it to scan the airwaves:\n\nPress VFO/MR and ensure the radio is in Frequency Mode.\n\nPress and hold the */”SCAN” Key.\n\nThe radio will scan through frequencies rapidly, stopping when it hears a transmission.\n\nTo set the number of frequencies the radio jumps with each scan, press MENU.\n\nNavigate to option 1: “STEP”.\n\nPress MENU to enter the step selection.\n\nUse the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the amount of the step.\n\nThe lowest step (2.5K) is the slowest and most thorough search. 50K is the fastest and least thorough frequency search.\n\nChange the radio’s operating band (VHF or UHF)\n\nThe Baofeng operates in two bands: Very High and Ultra High Frequency. Only one of two bands can be monitored and used at a time. To switch between bands:\n\nPress MENU.\n\nNavigate to option 33: BAND.\n\nPress MENU again to enter the band selection.\n\nUse the up and down arrows to select VHF or UHF.\n\nPress MENU again to confirm.\n\nExit.\n\nTIP: Many emergency radio frequencies, police, EMS, government agencies, and rescue operations use the VHF band.\n\nCTCSS and DCS (“private line” or PL communications)\n\nSometimes, one radio frequency will be used for transmitting and receiving by multiple operators. This is especially likely in a disaster scenario.\n\nMany first responders, command centers, and rescue operations will stick to one frequency to ensure stable communications.\n\nBut in order to separate all the operators on a single frequency from each other (and to avoid sharing transmissions and crowding up the airwaves), two possible systems of tonal frequencies are used.\n\nThese tonal frequency systems are called CTCSS (Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System) and DCS (Digital Code Squelch). Both systems work largely the same, except DCS is digital.\n\nCTCSS has 50 universal tones measured in hertz (67.0 Hz)\n\nDCS has 105 universal tones measured alphanumerically (D023N)\n\nTo have a better understanding of this, consider a wireless phone and the cellular network it operates on. Think of the frequency itself as the network, and the CTCSS or DCS tone as the phone number. You must be on the network to transmit or receive, but you also have to “dial” the right number to communicate (the CTCSS or DCS).\n\nThere are universal, preprogrammed tones built into the UV-5R for both systems. You must know which tone the frequency in question is using, in order to transmit.\n\nHow to Program CTCSS and DCS to a Frequency/Channel\n\nTo program a CTCSS or DCS tone into a frequency that requires it (and save it to a channel):\n\nPress VFO/MR and put the radio in Channel Mode.\n\nEnsure you’re on Channel A by pressing A/B.\n\nType in the frequency you want to save.\n\nPress MENU.\n\nNavigate to option 10 and 12 to set a transmitting and receiving DCS tone.\n\nNavigate to option 11 and 13 select a transmitting and receiving CTCS tone.\n\nPress MENU again to select the appropriate option.\n\nUse the up and down arrow keys to select the appropriate DCS or CTCS transmitting and receiving tones. In options 10 and 12, or 11 and 13.\n\nPress MENU to confirm your selection for each.\n\nNavigate to option 27 to store the frequency and the transmitting and receiving DCS or CTCS tones to a channel.\n\nExit.\n\nNow, the frequency you just saved should be on the display with either “DCS” or “CT” to the left.\n\nHow to Program a Repeater Frequency on the UV-5R\n\nHAM radios can only travel certain distances directly, usually a few miles. Repeaters act like “waypoints” for a transmission, hopping it from one repeater to next, extending your communication range. This is incredibly useful in a disaster situation because it allows you to reach much greater distances. Some repeaters allow transmissions to reach thousands of miles.\n\nTo program a repeater and transmit on its frequency, you’ll need to know some information about the repeater itself:\n\n*Repeater frequency\n\n*Shift (+ or -)\n\n*Offset\n\n*R-CTCS or R-DCS (rarely)\n\n*T-CTCS or T-DCS\n\nSome repeaters use different tonal frequency systems that are not CTCS or DCS, or none at all. Those other systems cannot be programmed into the UV-5R. They are not covered in this guide.\n\nTo program a repeater:\n\nPress VFO/MR and put the radio in Channel Mode.\n\nEnsure you’re on Channel A by pressing A/B.\n\nType in the frequency for the repeater you want to save.\n\nPress MENU.\n\nNavigate to option 10 or 11 to input the R-DCS or R-CTCS (if applicable).\n\nNavigate to option 12 to 13 to input the T-CTCS or T-DCS.\n\nNavigate to option 25: SFT-D.\n\nSet the positive or negative shift for the CTCS/DCS (provided).\n\nNavigate to option 26: Offset.\n\nSet the appropriate offset (provided based on band).\n\nNavigate to option 27 and save your repeater to a channel.\n\nExit.\n\nNow, in Channel mode, you can select the repeater channel and transmit on the repeater in question.\n\nUseful Emergency Radio Frequencies\n\nNow you have a basic understanding and can program and use the UV-5R. Here are some useful emergency radio frequencies commonly used throughout the country.\n\nNOAA Weather Broadcast Frequencies:\n\nThese frequencies broadcast the local weather 24-7. You can use this station map from the National Weather Service to see which frequency is the right one for your area, or you can just program them all in and scan through them.\n\n162.4000 MHz\n\n162.4250 MHz\n\n162.4500 MHz\n\n162.4750 MHz\n\n162.5000 MHz\n\n162.5250 MHz\n\n162.550 MHz\n\nFamily Radio Service Frequencies:\n\nFRS frequencies are used by low powered radios, think \"star wars walkie talkies.\" You don't need a license to use these frequencies, and you can only use radios with fixed (non-detachable) antennas. They are good for a 1/4 or 1/2 or a mile usually. More if you have direct line of sight, but don't expect too much from them. These are good to keep track of the kids or friends in the neighborhood.\n\nHere's the official FCC Page about FRS.\n\nYou can program these frequencies into the Baofeng, but to stay legal make sure you are at low power.\n\nGMRS is a better option, more on that in a second.\n\nFRS Frequency Chart:\n\nChannel No. Frequency Power (ERP in Watts) 1 462.5625 2 W 2 462.5875 2 W 3 462.6125 2 W 4 462.6375 2 W 5 462.6625 2 W 6 462.6875 2 W 7 462.7125 2 W 8 467.5625 0.5 W 9 467.5875 0.5 W 10 467.6125 0.5 W 11 467.6375 0.5 W 12 467.6625 0.5 W 13 467.6875 0.5 W 14 467.7125 0.5 W 15 462.5500 2 W 16 462.5750 2 W 17 462.6000 2 W 18 462.6250 2 W 19 462.6500 2 W 20 462.6750 2 W 21 462.7000 2 W 22 462.7250 2 W\n\nGeneral Mobile Radio Service\n\nGMRS is like FRS but more powerful. It shares many of the same frequencies as FRS does, but gives you the ability to use more power. This is because you are supposed to get a license to use GMRS. You buy one from the FCC and it's god for 10 years and covers the immediate family.\n\nGMRS radios can also use detachable antennas, and repeaters, greatly expanding their range.\n\nWe suggest focusing on GMRS for your group and local communications. Getting the license from the FCC is easy and cheap and doesn't require taking a test.\n\nHere is how to get a GMRS License.\n\nGMRS Frequency Chart:\n\nFrequency Channel FRS power FRS\n\nbandwidth GMRS power GMRS\n\nbandwidth Notes 462.5625 MHz 1 2 W 12.5 kHz 5 W 20 kHz (1)(4)(5) 462.5875 MHz 2 2 W 12.5 kHz 5 W 20 kHz (1)(4)(5) 462.6125 MHz 3 2 W 12.5 kHz 5 W 20 kHz (1)(4)(5) 462.6375 MHz 4 2 W 12.5 kHz 5 W 20 kHz (1)(4)(5) 462.6625 MHz 5 2 W 12.5 kHz 5 W 20 kHz (1)(4)(5) 462.6875 MHz 6 2 W 12.5 kHz 5 W 20 kHz (1)(4)(5) 462.7125 MHz 7 2 W 12.5 kHz 5 W 20 kHz (1)(4)(5) 467.5625 MHz 8 0.5 W 12.5 kHz 0.5 W 12.5 kHz (1)(4)(6) 467.5875 MHz 9 0.5 W 12.5 kHz 0.5 W 12.5 kHz (1)(4)(6) 467.6125 MHz 10 0.5 W 12.5 kHz 0.5 W 12.5 kHz (1)(4)(6) 467.6375 MHz 11 0.5 W 12.5 kHz 0.5 W 12.5 kHz (1)(4)(6) 467.6625 MHz 12 0.5 W 12.5 kHz 0.5 W 12.5 kHz (1)(4)(6) 467.6875 MHz 13 0.5 W 12.5 kHz 0.5 W 12.5 kHz (1)(4)(6) 467.7125 MHz 14 0.5 W 12.5 kHz 0.5 W 12.5 kHz (1)(4)(6) 462.5500 MHz 15 2 W 12.5 kHz 50 W 20 kHz (2)(5) 462.5750 MHz 16 2 W 12.5 kHz 50 W 20 kHz (2)(5) 462.6000 MHz 17 2 W 12.5 kHz 50 W 20 kHz (2)(5) 462.6250 MHz 18 2 W 12.5 kHz 50 W 20 kHz (2)(5) 462.6500 MHz 19 2 W 12.5 kHz 50 W 20 kHz (2)(5) 462.6750 MHz 20 2 W 12.5 kHz 50 W 20 kHz (2)(5)(7) 462.7000 MHz 21 2 W 12.5 kHz 50 W 20 kHz (2)(5) 462.7250 MHz 22 2 W 12.5 kHz 50 W 20 kHz (2)(5) 467.5500 MHz 15R — — 50 W 20 kHz (3)(5) 467.5750 MHz 16R — — 50 W 20 kHz (3)(5) 467.6000 MHz 17R — — 50 W 20 kHz (3)(5) 467.6250 MHz 18R — — 50 W 20 kHz (3)(5) 467.6500 MHz 19R — — 50 W 20 kHz (3)(5) 467.6750 MHz 20R — — 50 W 20 kHz (3)(5) 467.7000 MHz 21R — — 50 W 20 kHz (3)(5) 467.7250 MHz 22R — — 50 W 20 kHz (3)(5)\n\nTo program the UV-5R for GMRS/FRS, you can download and find all the frequencies here.\n\nYou won’t be able to type in the exact frequency, so use the up and down arrows to test the frequency until you find the strongest signal.\n\nNOTE: The Baofeng UV-5R is much more powerful than a standard walkie-talkie, especially if you’ve upgraded it with a new antenna or grounding. Communicating on these frequencies will likely over-power other transmissions. Keep this in mind during a disaster scenario.\n\nInternational distress frequency:\n\nThe universally-accepted, global distress frequency for any emergency radio transmission is VHF Channel 16 (156.800 MHz). If you have absolutely no clue what emergency frequency to try – and if scanning provides no transmissions – then keying into this frequency is your best option.\n\nThis frequency is monitored 24 hours a day by U.S. Coast Guard and maritime personnel globally. If rescue operations (land or sea) are attempting to hail an emergency radio with no knowledge of the channel or setup, they will default to this frequency.\n\nTwo-Meter Band Frequencies:\n\nMany local radio transmissions and repeaters work in the 2-meter band, or 144.000 MHz to 148.000 MHz. Scan this range of frequencies during an emergency, and you will likely contact others.\n\nMulti-Use Radio / MURS Emergency Frequencies:\n\nMURS is an American VHF radio band, not to be confused with FRS or GMRS. MURS essentially fills the gap between the UHF frequencies provided by FRS/GMRS, and the lower frequencies used by CB radios:\n\n151.820 – Unofficial MURS calling frequency\n\n151.880 – Recommended repeater frequency\n\n151.940 – Emergency channel often used by preppers\n\n154.570 – Older business/commercial frequency, still in use today\n\n154.600 – Older business/commercial frequency, still in use today\n\nOther Useful Emergency Marine Radio Frequencies:\n\n156.050 – Port operations\n\n156.350 – Commercial use\n\n156.450 – Boater calling\n\n156.500 – General commercial\n\n156.700 – Port operations\n\n156.850 – State and local government maritime\n\n157.000 – Port operations\n\n157.150 – U.S. Coast Guard only\n\n157.125 – U.S. Government only\n\n161.825 – Public correspondence\n\nIf you want to program directly into the radio, and would like to watch someone actually doing it, here is a helpful video from NZRadioGuy\n\nSummary\n\nThe UV-5R is an easy-to-use handheld radio that can be quickly programmed to transmit on emergency frequencies.\n\nRemember, transmitting without a radio license is illegal under normal circumstances.\n\nDon’t transmit on Ham frequencies without a license unless it’s an emergency. Stick to FRS, GMRS, MURS.\n\nTo get started with the absolute minimum information, turn on the UV-5R by turning the volume knob clockwise.\n\nPress the VFO/MR button until the radio announces “Frequency Mode”.\n\nUsing the keypad, type in 151.940 to key into the most commonly used emergency radio frequency.\n\nUse 156.800 if 151.940 doesn’t work.\n\nKey into 162.400 to key into the NOAA Weather Service broadcast.\n\nScan the 162.xxx frequency ranges by holding down the * key if this frequency doesn’t work.\n\nWhere to Get One\n\nBTW If you buy anything with the links we provide on this page we might get a small percentage of the sale.
