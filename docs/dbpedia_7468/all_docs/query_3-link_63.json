It became popular in late 2004, largely to automate downloading of audio onto portable players or personal computers.\n\nThe word ‘podcasting’ can be misleading since neither podcasting nor listening to podcasts requires an iPod or any portable music player. Any digital audio player or computer with audio-playing software can play podcasts.\n\nPodcasting is distinct from other types of online media delivery because of its subscription model, which uses the RSS 2.0 XML (or RDF XML) format to deliver an enclosed file. Podcasting gives broadcast radio programs a new distribution method. You may subscribe to feeds using ‘podcatching’ software, which periodically checks for and downloads new content automatically.”\n\nWhat is RSS?"
