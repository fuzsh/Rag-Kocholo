        "text": "Hurricane Debby Update\n\nCounty to Begin Curbside Vegetative Debris Collection on August 14\n\nFollowing Hurricane Debby, Leon County will begin curbside collection for vegetative storm debris for unincorporated County residents starting Wednesday, August 14. All unincorporated residents are encouraged to bring their debris to the curb for collection now.\n\nThe storm-related debris collection will consist of two passes over two weeks, each pass servicing every address in unincorporated Leon County. The first pass begins on Wednesday, August 14 and the second pass begins on Wednesday, August 21, ending on Tuesday, August 27.\n\nCollection will occur on both public and private roads in the unincorporated area.\n\nAs citizens continue their cleanup efforts, it is essential to remember the following tips:\n\nAll debris for collection should be placed curbside between the sidewalk or property line and the curb.\n\nKeep vegetative debris loose and unbagged at the curb.\n\nOnly vegetative disaster storm debris will be collected.\n\nBe careful and safe when moving large, bulky storm-related debris to the curb.\n\nDebris removal trucks will not pick up household garbage; Waste Pro will continue to collect trash, recycling, and smaller yard debris as usual on their normally scheduled days.\n\nDo not stack or lean debris against sprinkler heads, meters, poles, trees, backflows, and other structures.\n\nFor information on how best to organize debris and how to safely place materials at the curb, please review the included debris disposal guide.\n\nTo further support the needs of our community, Leon County will offer free-of-charge, no-size-limit vegetative debris drop-off for all Leon County citizens at both the Solid Waste Management Facility and all Rural Waste Service Centers until Tuesday, August 27.\n\nThe Leon County Solid Waste Management Facility, located at 7550 Apalachee Parkway, is open from Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe Leon County Rural Waste Service Centers are open on Fridays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the following locations:\n\nWoodville, 549 Henry Jones Road\n\nFort Braden, 2485 East Joe Thomas Road\n\nMiccosukee, 13051 Miccosukee Road\n\nResources\n\nFor all Leon County residents, 2-1-1 Big Bend helpline can connect you to disaster relief resources, including mental health resources, individual/family support services, and more. Call 2-1-1 or 850-617-6333.\n\nThe following includes a list of resources for disaster planning in Florida:\n\nFloridaDisaster.org contains a summary of currently open general and special needs shelters within the State of Florida.\n\nThe Visit Florida website contains current travel safety information as well as resources for hotel and lodging availability across the state of Florida.\n\nThe American Red Cross shelter directory contains a list of currently open American Red Cross shelters across the country.\n\nStorm Recovery Information from the May 10 Tornado Outbreak\n\nLow-interest disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) are available to businesses and residents in Florida following the announcement of a Presidential disaster declaration for severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes that occurred on May 10.\n\nThe disaster declaration covers Leon County, which is eligible for both Physical and Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the SBA. Small businesses and most private nonprofit organizations in the following adjacent counties are eligible to apply only for SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs): Franklin, Gadsden, Jefferson, Liberty and Wakulla in Florida; and Grady and Thomas in Georgia.\n\nDisaster survivors should not wait to settle with their insurance company before applying for a disaster loan. If a survivor does not know how much of their loss will be covered by insurance or other sources, SBA can make a low-interest disaster loan for the total loss up to its loan limits, provided the borrower agrees to use insurance proceeds to reduce or repay the loan.\n\nBusinesses and private nonprofit organizations of any size may borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace disaster-damaged or destroyed real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory, and other business assets.\n\nFor small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, small businesses engaged in aquaculture and most private nonprofit organizations, the SBA offers Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) to help meet working capital needs caused by the disaster. Economic Injury Disaster Loan assistance is available regardless of whether the business suffered any physical property damage.\n\nDisaster loans up to $500,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace disaster-damaged or destroyed real estate. Homeowners and renters are eligible for up to $100,000 to repair or replace disaster-damaged or destroyed personal property.\n\nApplicants may be eligible for a loan amount increase of up to 20 percent of their physical damages, as verified by the SBA for mitigation purposes. Eligible mitigation improvements may include a safe room or storm shelter, sump pump, French drain or retaining wall to help protect property and occupants from future damage.\n\nInterest rates are as low as 4% for businesses, 3.25% for nonprofit organizations, and 2.688% for homeowners and renters, with terms of up to 30 years. Interest does not begin to accrue, and monthly payments are not due, until 12 months from the date of the initial disbursement. Loan amounts and terms are set by the SBA and are based on each applicant’s financial condition.\n\nBuilding back smarter and stronger can be an effective recovery tool for future disasters. Applicants may be eligible for a loan amount increase of up to 20% of their physical damages, as verified by the SBA for mitigation purposes. Eligible mitigation improvements may include a safe room or storm shelter, sump pump, French drain or retaining wall to help protect property and occupants from future disasters.\n\nWith the changes to FEMA’s Sequence of Delivery, survivors are now encouraged to simultaneously apply for FEMA grants and the SBA low-interest disaster loan assistance to fully recover. FEMA grants are intended to cover necessary expenses and serious needs not paid by insurance or other sources. The SBA disaster loan program is designed for your long-term recovery, to make you whole and get you back to your pre-disaster condition. Do not wait on the decision for a FEMA grant; apply online and receive additional disaster assistance information at SBA.gov/Disaster.\n\nApplicants may apply online and receive additional disaster assistance information at SBA.gov/Disaster. Applicants may also call SBA’s Customer Service Center at (800) 659-2955 or email DisasterCustomerService@SBA.gov for more information on SBA disaster assistance. For people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability, please dial 7-1-1 to access telecommunications relay services.\n\nThe filing deadline to return applications for physical property damage is August 16, 2024. The deadline to return economic injury applications is March 17, 2025.\n\nFlorida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan\n\nFloridaCommerce activated the Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan Program, making $2 million available for businesses impacted by the recent severe weather that impacted North Florida. Florida small business owners in need of assistance are encouraged to visit www.FloridaJobs.org/EBL to apply for the Florida Small Business Emergency Bridge Loan Program. Businesses in Baker, Columbia, Escambia, Gadsden, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Madison, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Suwannee, Taylor, and Wakulla counties, including sole proprietors, are eligible to apply.\n\nThe program provides short-term, zero-interest loans to small businesses that experienced economic injury or physical damage due to May North Florida Tornadoes.
