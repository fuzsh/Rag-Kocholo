        "text": "The role of the broadcast mixing console (or mixing desk) is to provide control of multiple audio sources and combine them in to a 'mixed' output that is ready for tranmission (often via a processor).\n\nA broadcast mixer is essential for any radio service that wants to incorporate any live microphone sources in live or pre-recorded content. If you intend to do any live broadcasts or want to record shows as if they are live then you will need a mixer.\n\nThere is a wide range of broacast mixers available to cover different studio sizes and budgets. In general, the lower cost broadcast mixers use analogue audio and offer fewer fader channels. More expensive solutions often include digital and audio over IP (AoIP) elements along with more advanced features and potentially more faders.\n\nBroadcast mixers should not be confused with their 'sound mixer' cousins. Sound mixers look similar to broadcast mixers but differ in a few crucial ways. Usually sound mixers concentrate on mono channels as they are used for mixing instruments and voice where as broadcast mixers tend to have more stereo inputs. Another vital difference is that broadcast mixers 'mute' local speakers whenever the microphone channels are active to avoid feedback. Without this feature, it is difficult to use a mixer in a live broadcast studio.\n\nGenerally speaking, broadcast mixers are more expensive than sound mixers but they are much better suited to a radio studio environment.\n\nIt is possible to create and run a radio station without a mixing desk at all. By using the Voice Tracking feature in Myriad 5 Playout it is possible to add voice links to a fully automated station without the need for a mixer.\n\nWe offer a full range of Broadcast Mixers suitable for small and large studios.\n\nArguably, the Playout Sytem at a radio station is more important than any other component. You can run a station without a mixer but it is nearly impossible to run a full time station without a Playout System.\n\nThe role of the Playout System is to store and play all the content that will be used at your station. This includes jingles, songs, adverts & complete shows, basically any audio that you want to play!\n\nNot only does the Playout System store the content but it is also used to manually or automatically play the content either through your mixer or directly (if you don't have a mixer).\n\nAll of our solutions include Myriad 6 Playout, our acclaimed Playout System that can be found in radio stations around the world.\n\nMyriad 6 Playout also includes Myriad Schedule which allows you to plan content for shows (called a Clock) such that the system can automatically generate station output based on the type of content you want in any given hour as well as what rules you have placed on the system regarding how often songs and artists should be repeated.\n\nMyriad 6 Playout allows you to present 'live assisted' shows where you control the content but the system assists you by cueing each item before you need it, or fully automated playout to allow you to broadcast 24/7.\n\nYou can also use Myriad 6 Playout to add local or remote Voice Tracks to automated shows. This allows both you, and other presenters from around the world to contribute voice links that will be included in automated shows that sound like the presenter is in the studio!\n\nTo learn more about Myriad 6 Playout, check out our dedicated pages by clicking below.\n\nWhether you are presenting a live show or producing pre-made content, you will want a good pair of headphones to allow you to hear the audio content and your own voice. You will also need headphones for each guest that will be contributing to your show.\n\nSpeakers in a studio (often also called 'Monitors') are used to allow you to listen to content without your headphones on. It is important that your mixing console includes a feature that mutes the speakers whenever the microphone faders are 'open' as without that, you will get feedback from the speakers being in close proximity to the microphones. It is possible to use a sound mixer that does not mute the speakers but you would need to manually turn the speakers off each time you use the microphones.\n\nWe offer a range of speakers, microphones and headphones in our online store.\n\nSome radio formats are enhanced by the ability for the listeners to contribute directly via the phone. Whether it is for live calls, requests or telephone interviews, the ability to record and broadcast telephone calls can really make your station stand out.\n\nUnfortunately, the options open to you will be dictated to some degree by the mixing desk you choose. Some mixers (like the SRM) have telephone phone interfaces built directly into them so all you need to do is plug in your phone line and you are ready to go! Other broadcast mixers require some additional equipment to allow you to connect a phone line to the system. Most sound mixing type desks will not allow phonelines to be connected at all!\n\nAnother option you can consider is using a software VoIP solution such as Skype. Generally you can use this type of solution to record into your Myriad 5 Playout system regardless of your mixing desk.\n\nFinally, if multi-line call shows feature in your vision for the station then you can invest in a multi-line call handling system that allows you to screen and manage multiple concurrent calls and route several to 'air' at once.\n\nWe have a page dedicated to studio telephone systems.\n\nIf you are planning on presenting live shows as part of your station output, you will need to invest in some type of studio signage for your studio.\n\nAt the minimum, you will need some type of visual indication that one or more of the microphones are currently active so that guests or anyone entering the studio will know when the microphones are 'live'. It is also common to provide presenters with other useful information such as accurate time, breaking news stories, studio live indication etc.\n\nOur SmartSign system offers a low cost, screen base studio signage solution that can do everything above and more. We also offer simple light based indicators if you don't require the more advanced features.\n\nIf you are not presenting live shows and don't mind the risk of someone entering the studio while you are presenting or recording a live link, then you can probably manage without any studio signage.\n\nIf you would like to know more about SmartSign, click below.\n\nAlthough the bulk of your audio will likely be stored on your Myriad 5 Playout system, you may wish to consider adding additional audio equipment such as CD players or turntables to your studio setup. Make sure that your mixer has spare inputs and faders before you order any additional equipment.\n\nAnother thing to consider is audio processing. The audio processors job is to alter or enhance your audio to sound better to the end user. It may be that you use a simple compressor / limiter to stop audio being too loud or you could go for a full, multi-band processor that enhances the audio to sound more dynamic. Another common solution is an audio level correction device such as the Audessence Podblaster that does not alter the dynamic sound of your radio but does make quiet things louder and loud things quieter for a better overall listener experience.\n\nIf you are broadcasting on the web then your Audio Encoder may have the option to add 3rd party audio processor plugins (like the BR Encoder does). These allow you to emulate the sound of 'big radio' without the heavy investment in audio processing that tradtional broadcasters have!\n\nIf you are broadcasting on AM/FM/DAB, it is likely you will have mandatory requirements for audio processing.\n\nTo view a full range of audio options, why not visit our online store.\n\nIf you are planning on broadcasting on a regulated frequency such as AM, FM or DAB, you will most likely require a license from your areas regulatory body. In the UK that is OFCOM and you will need to speak to them directly as we are not able to offer advice on licensing issues.\n\nIf you are broadcasting on the web, in most areas you will not need a broadcast license.\n\nWhether you are a traditional radio station or web broadcaster, if you include copyrighted music then you will need to get the appropriate music licenses from the copyright bodies. In the UK that is PPL and PRS."
