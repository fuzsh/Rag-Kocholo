We have cancelled all events happening at Fogartyville Community Media & Arts Center March 13th – March 31st.\n\nWe are refunding any tickets purchased for events during this timeframe and hope to reschedule them in the future. It may take a few days for the refunds to occur, and we appreciate your patience with this process.\n\nAs we navigate through this health concern, the most important thing is for everyone to take care of each other and actively monitor the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Canadian Public Health, and State Health Department recommendations.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), “This is a controllable pandemic.”\n\nIf we work together as a nation and Community to slow the transmission, our health system will be able to manage the virus and provide adequate care for those who are ill."
