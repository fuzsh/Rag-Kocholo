Suncoast Remake Learning Days (SRLD) 2024 provided a small peek into what this might look like.\n\nFrom April 20 through May 4, 2024, 304 events were held in partnership with 277 community partners across Charlotte, DeSoto, Manatee, and Sarasota counties. These events welcomed 36,500 community members who engaged in events ranging from water dance celebrations, radio camps, lessons in Chinese, veterinary school, mad science, exploring a virtual reality world, and much, much more. Families could engage with various community partners and learn about their services and resources, while community partners built new relationships and fostered opportunities for future collaboration.\n\nWhile I had the privilege to work with each of these hosts to support all 304 events, I wanted to highlight three events I attended and share some photos that convey the magic of these fifteen days.\n\nCelebrate Earth Day with The Bay\n\nThis SRLD event was held at The Bay Park Conservancy in partnership with Art Center Sarasota, First 1,000 Days, Ride & Paddle, Sarasota County Butterfly Club, Sidewalk Science Center, Southface Sarasota, and Wholehearted Education. It focused on exposing participants to various community organizations and offering diverse ways to celebrate Earth Day, including learning about the lifecycle of butterflies with real butterflies and caterpillars, taking home free trees to plant, practicing yoga that connects with nature, and enjoying many other activities."
