        "text": "Books Tue Sep 01 2015\n\nBest Chicago Novels by Neighborhood\n\nLast week, the New York Public Library released its list of the Best New York City Novels by Neighborhood, pairing the city's best works of fiction with the neighborhoods in which they take place, from Henry James to Teju Cole. Since Chicago's literary history is just as impressive, I thought I'd take a crack at the City of Big Shoulders' best novels, neighborhood by neighborhood, from Henry Blake Fuller to Sandra Cisneros.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Adam Morgan /\n\nEssay Tue Feb 17 2015\n\nOn Happiness (or, To Have and Have Not)\n\nBy John Rich\n\nEditor's note: The following essay was read at Tuesday Funk, a montly reading series sponsored by Gapers Block, on Jan. 6, 2015.\n\nI don't know what one means by happy\n\nI'm happy spasmodically\n\nIf I eat a chocolate turtle, I'm happy\n\nWhen the box is empty, I'm unhappy\n\nHappiness is\n\nHappiness is a word for amateurs.\n\n— \"Happiness Is,\" Violent Femmes\n\nOn August 12, 2014, the American actress Lauren Bacall died of natural causes. She was a month shy of 90 years.\n\n\"Here is a test to find out whether your mission in life is complete,\" Bacall once said. \"If you're alive, it isn't.\"*\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Book Club\n\nAuthor Tue Nov 25 2014\n\nThe Other Chair Up There: An Hour with Donna Seaman\n\nDonna Seaman was happy to speak with me. It was a surprise; her reputation preceded her. I knew Seaman was the woman who'd interviewed Martin Amis at this year's Chicago Humanities Festival. She is also a senior editor of Booklist.\n\nThese facts alone I describe as a \"reputation\": leafing through its pages on the bus downtown, I recognized Booklist as the answer to my past weekend's wondering, of literature's fading importance; and Amis was the coy and mellifluous knight at the masthead of that importance. We had all cheered, in the audience, when he came on stage. Because in his dry wit and Swansean tone we all thought we were hearing something of the truth.\n\nShe had a hand in both worlds and that fact alone led me to anticipate she'd be a little bit scary. She wasn't.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Alex Thompson\n\nFeature Fri Aug 29 2014\n\nLillie West, Brain Frame Intern, Remembers\n\nWest drew this eulogy to Brain Frame exclusively for Gaper's Block.\n\nLillie West has a pleasant British accent. She's wearing a blue dress with white flowers on it. When she sees me walk up to the Hot Wok sushi joint near her school, SAIC downtown, she points at me and does not stop until I'm near enough to hug her. She's on the phone.\n\n\"You,\" I say.\n\n\"You,\" she replies with her pleasant British accent, and hangs up. She's excited about classes, where she's just come from. She considers dropping an intro class but fears she's doing it for the wrong reasons. \"Four day weekend, right\" She shrugs. We make our way inside.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Alex Thompson\n\nProfiles Wed Aug 13 2014\n\nUncanny Magazine Wants You To Rethink The Familiar\n\nImage courtesy of Uncanny Magazine and Katy Shuttleworth\n\n\"Is that a unicorn...in space?\" you might ask, staring at the logo (created by Katy Shuttleworth) for Uncanny Magazine, the latest endeavor by geek culture mainstays Lynne Thomas and Michael Damian Thomas. And indeed it is--the drawing symbolizes the close relationship between the science fiction and fantasy (SF/F) genres, a relationship that the Thomases will highlight in their new magazine, along with original artwork and literature. But it also represents the proximity of fandom and art, of passions and professionalism.\n\nUncanny will feature stories, prose, poetry and cover art in, and inspired by, the realms of science fiction and fantasy. The online magazine will be available as an eBook (.mobi, .pdf, . epub) on a bimonthly basis (first Tuesday of the month) at all major eBook stores. Each issue will be made up of original short stories, reprinted stories, poetry, interviews, and nonfiction essays. Because it will be a professional magazine, non-fiction and art work will be solicited, and paid by direct commission. The editors will publish work that reflects their commitment to diversity and representation, and will even have an open call for submissions (for fiction and poetry).\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Danette Chavez\n\nBook Club Wed Aug 06 2014\n\nA Match Made In Heaven, A Town Doomed to Hell\n\nImage courtesy of PleasureTown\n\nOne man's trash is another man's treasure; one town's failed utopian experiment is a Chicago storyteller's ideal setting for a storytelling experiment. Such is the case for PleasureTown, created by live lit stalwarts Keith Ecker and Erin Kahoa. Originally a live stage production, PleasureTown has evolved into a bi-weekly podcast (in the vein of the radio serials of old), as well as a \"national platform\" for local writers and performers.\n\nPleasureTown was inspired in part by the Homestead Acts of the late 19th-early 20th centuries, wherein the U.S. government offered as many as 160 acres of land to families of settlers who were willing to \"go west.\" It's set in PleasureTown, Oklahoma, a fictional town whose rise and fall is documented by the vignettes created, and voiced, by members of Chicago's live lit and storytelling communities, such as Ian Belknap, Don Hall, and Willy Nast. But the show isn't resting on the laurels of its established performers: there's an interactive element on the website, and even a call for submissions.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Danette Chavez\n\nAuthor Wed Aug 06 2014\n\nSome of the Most Punk Rock Shit I've Ever Seen In My Life\n\nLyra Hill, creator of the anarchic and elaborate live comics series Brain Frame, has dark hair and round eyes. She often looks tired as she is, often, tired these days.\n\nShe speaks with her hands clasped, and looks at those who speak to her with expectation and attention. Standing atop the stage at the historic, newly restored Thalia Hall she is unmistakably a person in charge.\n\nThe interior is massive and neo-gothic. The theater chairs that make up its balcony once belonged to a middle school auditorium. The folding chairs above, rumor has it, were at one point courtside seats for the Lakers. Its stage recalls the Phantom of the Opera and Amadeus - in fact, the entire structure has the feel of Prague's neo-everything city center. No mistake, as it was modeled in 1892 after the Prague Opera House, a romantic, expensive-looking venue in the midst of a burgeoning, colorful neighborhood - in this case, Pilsen. Lawn chairs, plastic cones and colorful rope often impede parking on side streets.\n\nSoon the theater will fill with people of all ilk and experience. Fans of Brain Frame are diverse: in the hour Lyra and company scout the space, most mention is made of whose parents are coming (5 of 8 performers present). However, Brain Frame's 3rd Anniversary/Grand Finale show (Brain Frame 19) will likely draw a crowd larger than the average middle school recital. This \"homage to ancestral experimentation\" is a sort of rite in Chicago.

Her characters were \"very simple and very vulgar and I don't think they will interest the American public.\"\n\nShe is Gertrude Stein, author of the Great American Novel Three Lives,and many others, many greater. She wrote \"Three Lives\" in Paris, inspired and nested amongst contemporaries and peers Pablo Picasso, Gustave Flaubert and Paul Cezanne. She was hostess to the Parisian salons of our bourgeois dreams; she was Ernest Hemingway's dear friend and first editor. She was of the cultural class that added the \"ing\" to vacation; promoting a new flavor of leisure that seemed to go on and on, continuously. Her life was large, but intimate.\n\nUnable to find a dedicated publisher, Stein published 1,000 copies out-of-pocket, only 500 of them bound, in July 1909. By February 1910 only 75 had been sold, less than the number she had distributed on her own to reviewers, friends and idols. I would posit that, including postage, she made perhaps enough profit to buy Cezanne a new paintbrush.\n\nStein was entering into a genre, but only in its physical form — the loose-fitting genre of \"books,\" rough pages bound together by clothette, stiches and glue. In all other ways, though, she was in a classification of her own — a niche-less niche, really, since she was the only one who occupied it. There was Gertrude Stein, and there were those who read Gertrude Stein. She did not confer with a movement; her most influential contemporary was Cezanne, a painter who's brush strokes she imitated in her clipped and repetitive prose and her desire to \"use everything.\"\n\nI was reminded of Ms. Stein last weekend at Chicago's own independently run Zine Fest.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Alex Thompson\n\nBooks Mon Feb 10 2014\n\nPioneer Press: Writer and Editor Publishes Book of Real-Life Travel Tales\n\nWhile on a class trip in Cuba, college junior Asha Veal Brisebois' camera died.

Damiano by Chicago-born graphic novelist Daniel Clowes, LaBeouf has tweeted numerous apologies and justifications, quoting everyone from Yahoo! commenters to Kanye West, Eliot Spitzer and Toronto Mayor Rob Ford -- all without attribution.\n\nIn addition, LaBeouf has mockingly re-posted a cease and desist letter from Clowes' attorneys after he tweeted a purported storyboard based on another Clowes work, publicly feuded with Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy, hired a plane to write \"I AM SORRY DANIEL CLOWES\" above the L.A. sky, and declared himself a performance artist...just days after declaring he would be retiring from public life and headbutting a man in a London pub.\n\nYesterday, The New Inquiry posted an essay with LaBeouf's byline called #stopcreating, exploring the recent history of artistic re-appropriation and the merits of long-held notions of authorship and originality in the digital age.\n\nThe prose and reference points may seem impressive for a man better known for Transformers and the Disney Channel. But if you look closer, #stopcreating is perhaps LaBeouf's boldest act of defiant plagiarism to date.\n\nThe sources?

Though she had rather large shoes to fill, she was unflappable, amazingly generous and available for her students. It wasn't until later that I found that that she's just as talented a writer as she is a devoted teacher. Her debut short story collection, Things That Pass for Love, won an Independent Publisher Book Award. Her first novel, Stations West, was a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature. Her latest book, A Nearly Perfect Copy, is a brilliantly plotted character-driven novel involving con men, art forgery, DNA cloning, grief and loss.\n\nNow an inhabitant of New York, Amend claims that Chicago will always be home.

The online magazine publishes work with a non-traditional and generally feminist bent. Both Yoder and Burbank have similar literary tastes, and felt there was a largely unoccupied space for it amidst the already bustling literary scene here in Chicago.\n\n\"There are a lot of women's voices that haven't been heard, and haven't really been embraced by the mainstream,\" Yoder said. \"We're interested in publishing nontraditional narratives with a feminist bent. These are our preferences--what we're drawn to in terms of what we read--and it's a way to celebrate that and give that type of writing more visibility.\"\n\nAt PROJECTTILE's upcoming April 23 reading writers Alexis Buryk, Dan Ivec, and Caroline Picard of Green Lantern Press will bestow their non-traditional and/or feminist leaning voices to an audience at Uncharted Books, located at 2630 N. Milwaukee Ave., at 7pm. Ivec is the first man to read, and editors hope that he represents the beginning in a series of male voices to come from PROJECTTILE.\n\n\"While we are a magazine with a feminist bent, we don't see ourselves as publishing exclusively women writers, or limiting ourselves to promoting or publishing work by women, especially when we come across interesting and innovative work,\" Yoder said.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Claire Glass\n\nInterview Thu Apr 18 2013\n\nAuthor Chris L. Terry Discusses his Debut Young Adult Novel\n\nIn the opening scene of local author Chris L. Terry's debut young adult novel, Zero Fade, 13-year-old Kevin Phifer gets a haircut from his mom. What he really wants is a stylish fade, but what he gets is more accurately described as \"jacked up.\" Later in the book Kevin's role model uncle--who eventually comes out as gay--rescues Kevin from hair hell by taking him to the barber, where \"grown men who are still cool\" go.\n\nIt's a vital scene, Terry explains, because it captures Kevin's struggle to confront his limiting ideas about homosexuality, coolness and manliness, themes that attract Terry to writers in what he calls the \"urban nerd\" genre, like Junot Diaz.\n\n\"You think of this stereotypical urban man as being black or latino, this kind of hyper-masculine, over-sexualized person,\" Terry said. \"And I feel like a lot of the best stuff in that style of writing subverts that. Or the character is struggling with these really rigid and restrictive ideas about masculinity.\"\n\nBorn to a black father and an Irish-American mother, Terry is no stranger to struggles around identity and society's preconceived notions. Much of his writing, including short stories and essays, surrounds growing up in a biracial household. But in Zero Fade, which Curbside Splendor will publish this September (though you can preorder through Amazon), Terry drops his own concerns for those of his adolescent narrator, a kid who \"always wants to get things right.\"\n\nTerry, a graduate of the MFA in creative writing program at Columbia College, was born in Newton, Mass. (home of the famous fig cookie), and teaches creative writing and playwriting to juvenile inmates with Storycatchers Theatre. He sat down with Gapers Block Book Club to discuss writing, wiggers, and his adventures in punk rock.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Lara Levitan\n\nBooks Tue Feb 19 2013\n\nArea Transgender Woman Featured in New Anthology by Out & Equal\n\nAfter 20 years working as a Human Resources Director and Business Partner at a major corporation, Chicagoland resident Lori Fox quit her job.

This guide doubles as a introduction for anyone who's curious about zines. Feel free to guide and be guided by it!\n\nTo be sure, we all have a wide variety of definitions of what a zine actually is. I've heard people say things including \"it has to be photocopied,\" \"there can't be any advertising,\" \"only one person can be involved in making it,\" \"it has to be laid out by hand,\" \"the person/people who make it cannot make a profit,\" \"it must in some way involve feminism, anarchism, cupcakes, veganism, bikes or punk bands,\" (just kidding on the last one. But not really.)\n\nFor our purposes here, I'm going to call a zine a small publication made outside of a traditional publishing model. I know that broad of a definition is problematic for some people but, in this day and age, zines range from the pasted-together-in-five-seconds variety, to art books to lo-fi music journals, to professionally illustrated comics and everything in between.

In an effort to unify, writer and designer Nicki Yowell got together with Liz Mason over at Quimby's to create Self Publishers of Chicago. Since its beginning in April, the group has developed into a virtually unstructured weekly meet-up that invites creative types to gather in a central location and get stuff done. The stuff Yowell and Mason originally had in mind was mostly zine making, but the group's attendees have since diversified. SPOC launched its website earlier this week and intends to broaden its reach.\n\n\"It's a really solitary thing to be a writer, designer, artist and people really benefit from coming together,\" Yowell said. \"Just come as you are with whatever you're working on.\"\n\nYowell said she and Mason were determined to put together a group that met without pressure, without demanding much of its attendees beyond willingness to share space and some ideas.\n\n\"Early on I wanted to go to tacky chain restaurant as a group, so we had a poll and listed all of the big offenders like Chili's and Friday's,\" Yowell said. \"That just reinforces that we're really not taking ourselves too seriously. We're productive, but really it's to give the basic ingredients for people to be more productive and aware of what's going on in the creative community.\"\n\nRecently some founding SPOC members completed a collaborative project, Fire Dog Zine, inspired by a book in the Read/Write Library all about Chicago firedogs. It's on sale now at Quimby's.

Moore is well known for her book Cambodian Grrrrl: Self Publishing in Phnom Penh, a journalistic account of Moore's experience teaching self-publishing techniques to the first generation of university women in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. She's also the creator of the Adventure School for Ladies, which she bills as an experimental graduate program in which students explore gender politics, cultural production, and related social divisions with the \"top ladylike scholars in the field of adventure studies.\" Don't be fooled, the program is open to anybody regardless of gender identification.\n\nHip Hop Apsara features a different type of documentation alongside the text Moore is so adept in writing; photography. The collection offers a portrait of life in Phnom Pehn after dark, primarily focusing on the dance scene, which she says captures the developing middle class in action. The essays that accompany those images grapple with notions of public and private space, mourning and remembering the past, and economic uncertainty.\n\nMoore spoke with me about her new book as it was inspired by Cambodian Grrrl, her little known life as a photographer, and a bit about her experience with publishing houses large and small. Moore also addressed her fascination with economics and sociological study as the foundation of many of her projects, plus her propensity to make a Project out of anything that moves. This book she says is an exercise in stepping away from that, of letting the subject matter speak.\n\nThe format of your new book is unusual as it joins imagery of Phnom Penh and essays. I say unusual because it strikes me that neither element is necessarily more important than the other. How did you approach structuring the book given the duality of the mediums? Did being a comics artist influence this choice?\n\nA lot of people don't know that I trained as a photographer -- a darkroom printer, actually -- although by the time I got my BFA I had been writing and publishing for years. And I actually had started adding text to images and printing these massive photographic prints in a series, until someone said, what an expensive way to make a book! And I was like oh, yeah, there's this other thing that I do better than this that is less time consuming and annoying than photography. Then my camera got stolen and I basically didn't get another one until I started spending time in Cambodia after 2007.\n\nThe point is: I think photographically anyway, and I write in response to images, I just usually don't make the images, or I don't make the images public. And that -- well, for one, I'm not really a comics artist, I'm a comics critic but I use the medium of comics to communicate this criticism -- but I'm good with comics because I think image and text can be equally important. Without being overly reliant on each other.\n\nPutting the book together was pretty fun for that reason, too. Going in I had this very hard sense of, you know: it must be chronological! It must convey fact! There will be footnotes! Like a journalist, right? But as I started to construct a logic purely from the visuals, I got to tell a different kind of story. And that's really where the essay came in. It was a way of responding to the last five years I've been spending time and thinking about this amazing place without having to report or convey details. It feels really important, and I think in a way it gives a much better sense of what's so amazing about this place -- but also about people -- than anything more journalistic I've done.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Claire Glass\n\nBook Club Fri Jun 29 2012\n\nChanges are Afoot for Literary and Publishing Programs\n\nThe Chicago Office of Tourism and Culture, former home to Chicago Publishes, a non-profit housed under the City department, is closing as of today, June 29 (In the interest of full disclosure, I was co-web editor of Chicagopubishes.com). What will come of this shift remains to be seen, but what is certain is that coverage of the literary and publishing community is as critical a matter as ever before. Participants in this one of the many vibrant arts communities in Chicago know that ferver won't wane and the readings, live lit shows, and release parties will still go on, just as local publishers will continue to crank out the great works of our neighbors.\n\nCheck out the post announcing the hiatus here, which includes numerous alternative sources for literary news.

To say the Afro-Carribean-Irish Chicago native continues to follow in an artistic tradition is true and yet in some ways a misnomer -- although he comes from a creative background, Akins' choices and work display his definitive and detailed style. This is reflected in his work on Fables, Jack of Fables, Hellblazer: Papa Midnite, Elementals, and more.\n\nSadly, the possibility that Tony will leave here for Seattle in the not-so-distant future is high. I was lucky enough to talk with DC/Vertigo artist about his history and process before he heads west.\n\nName: Tony Akins\n\nJob: Comic book artist\n\nAge: Really!?\n\nEducation: Incandescent Drop-out, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago\n\nLocation: Ravenswood Manor\n\nHometown: Chicago, IL\n\nWebsite: http://tonyakins.blogspot.com/\n\nFavorite place in Chicago: Any place that presents an interesting aspect or view that seems to be just for me in that moment.\n\nSelf-portrait\n\nYou're originally from Chicago?\n\nYes I am. I was born on the South Side, raised on the South Side. I think St. Luke's Presbyterian Hospital, and raised at 66th and Marquette for the first few years of my life. Then we bought a house out near Avalon Park, which is out by Chatham, South Shore. My mother still lives in the same house.\n\nSouth Side, but I guess a naturalized Northsider.\n\nYour dad was an artist too, right?\n\nHe was a jack of all trades, which I guess he needed to be for the day. In my life he did everything from design signs, hand-paint signs, process, cut-out, hang in stores. He made signs, he was a social editor at the Chicago Defender, he was a cartoonist, he was an old-school emcee.\n\nI think some of the first cartoons of his I've been able to find online were from 1941, editorial stuff that he continued to do for as long as I can remember. And then also writing a social column for the The Defender, which involved him going to and hosting parties and commenting on who was there. It was kind of like an early version of People magazine. That particular column was essentially who was there and who was seen with who. That's what he enjoyed doing, and it left an impression on me...the writing, the cartooning.\n\nDid he encourage you to be an artist?\n\nNo! He did not, he tried to steer me away from it, so to this day I'm kind of conflicted about what I do. I even tried to derail it at one point by joining the military, which did not work out, obviously.\n\nThat whole relationship was very strife-ridden, because I saw him doing it, I enjoyed drawing, I had a knack for it. It was very hard-pressed between us because of it. My dad being African-American in America in the '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s -- his education was limited. He had to...it's cliché, but it's true. He dropped out of school in the fourth grade to support his mom and siblings. He was a self-made man and proud of what he did, and he wanted me not to have to do that. Vocation was very important.\n\nJack of Fables #28\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Rose Lannin\n\nFeature Wed Sep 21 2011\n\nLandmark Seminary Co-op Bookstore, 50 Years Young\n\nThis October, the Seminary Co-op will celebrate its 50th birthday, and within a year it will say goodbye to its cherished home in the basement of the Chicago Theology Seminary -- a winding and seemingly endless labyrinth of books.

When I got older, fund raising turned into semi-formal galas. These days I've noticed fund raising has returned to passing around the collection plate, so to speak; it's Kickstarter, it's a tips jar, it's a cover charge.\n\nThe next Windy City Story Slam, happening on September 18, mixes tradition with a bit of creativity. The scheduled bout will benefit the John Schultz and Betty Shiflett Story Workshop Scholarships of Columbia College's Fiction Writing department. Event producer and Story Slam's founder Bill Hillmann saw a need to step in and support one of the oldest scholarships for writers at his Alma mater. I met up with the scholarship's John Schultz and Betty Shiflett to talk about their program, the Slam, and scholarship since the death of in-state funded grants.\n\nWe grabbed something to drink before we began. With his doppio (a double espresso) in hand, Schultz took his briefcase and led Shiflett, with her Tazo tea (pomegranate-flavored), and me from one of the many South Loop Starbucks, up to his office in the Fiction Writing Department on Wabash Ave. The north-facing view into the loop distracted me for a second, but I didn't forget why I was there: to talk to two of the city's elder statesmen, two founding members of Columbia's widely renowned Fiction Writing department -- two people who have been teaching longer than most of their students have been alive. Shultz wrote the book on the program (no really, Writing From Start to Finish is the department's text, written by Shultz in 1982), and in their long tenure as faculty, one of their lasting achievements has been their namesake scholarship.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— John Wawrzaszek /\n\nFeature Mon Aug 15 2011\n\nModern Poetry Goes Victorian: the Chicago Poetry Brothel\n\nIf you like poetry, entertainment, and top hats, then the Chicago Poetry Brothel is for you. Tucked away in Thalia Hall, in private rooms in Ristorante al Teatro (1227 W 18th St), the basement bar has been turned into a Victorian brothel by the brothel's madam--Madam Black-eyed Susan--her \"poetry whores,\" and the good doctor (there to supply laudanum for the poets with a case of the nerves). After paying the entrance fee ($5 if you're dressed in Victorian period clothing, $10 if your Victorian period wardrobe is at the cleaners), grab some wine or whiskey at the bar, and wait for the show to start.\n\nThe Poetry Brothel typically follows a standard format: After patrons get the chance to settle, Madam Black-eyed Susan introduces her poets with a few descriptive sentences about each, and each poet gets a chance to read a bit of their work to entice the crowd. Once everyone has gotten just a taste of the evening's finest lines, the poets mix and mingle with the crowd, peddling their poems, every so often taking the floor again to tease the patrons with more of their work. Because for a mere $5, you can purchase a token that gets you, not only the poetry whore of your choice, but an intimate reading with that poet, inside a velvet tent, complete with chairs, a table, and gold tassels. In this private space, the poet will recite anything the patron wants--be it the poet's own work or a poem the patron has in mind--on any topic. Being face-to-face and knee-to-knee with the poet is a very personal experience--ask the poet anything you want about the piece, ask for it to be read it again, ask pretty please for more than one poem. You might think that you'll get the same kind of work from each poet, which is definitely not the case. The poetry whores each have their own style that ranges from sultry jazz (Serafine LaCroix) to dark and haunting (August Rose). Plan ahead--check them all out so you can come to the next brothel prepared. And if you're interested in more than one, feel free to purchase more than one private reading!\n\nBut poetry isn't the only entertainment--the brothel also invites guests and musicians to showcase their talent. At the August 6 Poetry Brothel, Pearl Pistol performed her alluring vaudeville burlesque show, and the White City Rippers kept everyone moving with what they call their \"old-timey mad-scientist steampunk music.\" (The October brothel will feature Karen Abbott, author of Sin in the Second City, and The Loneliest Monk, master of the electric cello.)\n\nIntrigued? You should be. By the end of the night (the Poetry Brothel parlors are open from 8pm to midnight), you may leave with the poetry whores' books (on sale throughout the evening), and you may leave a little tipsy (the bar is open all four hours), but you certainly won't leave uninspired and unimpressed. And to tantalize you just a little bit more--see what Madam Black-eyed Susan herself has to say about the brothel, her poetry whores, and much more after the jump.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Emily Wong\n\nProfiles Tue Jul 05 2011\n\nBookstore Profile: Powell's Bookstores, Chicago\n\nName: Powell's Bookstore\n\nLocations: 2850 N. Lincoln Ave (North)\n\n1501 E. 57th St (Hyde Park)\n\nFounder: Michael Powell\n\nBooks: Rare and used/discounted (every genre)\n\nWebsite: www.powellschicago.com\n\nHistory: Opened in 1970\n\nPowell's Bookstores has two retail locations (as well as a wholesale division that sells university press leftovers to other bookstores) in the Chicago area. Kimberly Sutton, employee at the Hyde Park location, gave some great responses about the inception of Powell's! (Photos are of Powell's North.)\n\nWhen did Powell's Bookstore open, and how did it start, i.e., what was the motivation/inspiration for its founding?\n\nPowell's was founded in 1970 by Michael Powell, who had been running a student co-op bookstore on the University of Chicago campus. Michael was a grad student really into books--so much that he convinced Saul Bellow, Edward Shils, and Morris Janowitz (among others) to front him the money for a much needed bookstore in Hyde Park. This is slightly unrelated to Powell's, but I love this story so I beg you to indulge me -- the building in Hyde Park (where Powell's still lives) housed a real estate agency until earlier in the year, when it was fire-bombed (!), probably by student radicals (the case is still unsolved), though they were notorious slum lords, and a tenants union had formed against them as well. A few days later someone spray painted, \"You don't need a weatherman to know that the fire is blowing in the right direction.\" Sounds like the perfect spot for a bookstore to me.\n\nWe did really well and kept expanding -- we used to share this space with O' Gara & Wilson's (now across the street), bought a warehouse in the mid-70s (it's since moved a few times, now out by Midway), and bought the north store in 1987.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Emily Wong /\n\nFeature Fri Jun 24 2011\n\nThe Chicago Underground Library Lives and Thrives\n\nWhat do you do when a natural disaster takes out your library? You go mobile. The Chicago Underground Library, an organization dedicated to the collection and distribution of local independent and small-press media, is nothing if not about adaptation created by necessity. This principle is reflected in their mission statement and most recently, in the pop-up library project that sprung in part from a blizzard burying a sizable portion of their publications.\n\nTurning a potential pitfall into a chance for evaluation and reinvention, they're currently collaborating with spaces across Chicago to house their collection -- Albany Park's North Branch Projects, Uptown's Chicago Grassroots Curriculum Taskforce, and recently Logan Square's Comfort Station. Co-founder Nell Taylor explained the library's recent developments, both tangible and online, and shed some light on the mentality that keeps the CUL alive in an age where the nature of libraries, media, and public spaces is ever-shifting.\n\nWant to help the Chicago Underground Library find a home? They're holding a benefit for that tonight at Beauty Bar (1444 W. Chicago Ave.) from 9pm to 2am.\n\nGapers Block: How did you become involved with Comfort Station?\n\nNell Taylor: Josh Dumas, a really wonderful performer and artist and musician, had emailed me and said hey, my friend David Keel was just put in charge of Comfort Station, have you heard about it, you guys should do something there. I know Josh because Josh showed up at our very, very, very first meeting at Mercury Cafe back in 2006, with a whole bunch of stuff for the library. So it's all kind of coming full-circle now. He put me in touch with David and Jess [Devereaux]...I went over there and told them about what was going on with us, and that we were looking to do this whole series of pop-up libraries. We didn't know how long it would be before we could find a space, and with each one of these, we're doing it kind of tailored to what our partner's already working with.\n\nComfort Station Pop-up Library\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Rose Lannin\n\nFeature Thu Jun 23 2011\n\nHow Criminal: A Conversation with Keith and Kent Zimmerman\n\nThis is a guest post from John Wawrzaszek, a contributor to Newcity, publisher of the zine the Muse, the News, and the Noose, and Fiction Writing student at Columbia College. This feature is based on his interviews with the Zimmerman Brothers, guest editors of the next issue of tri-city (but with a strong Chicago association) journal Criminal Class Review.\n\nCollaborations are one of those things that can end with mixed results. When they work out well, the effort appears seamless and the final product is something to be applauded. This is the working model Kevin Whiteley, aka Wayne White, founder of the punk-inspired Criminal Class Press, has followed with his journal, the Criminal Class Review. The publication searches for gritty, hard luck tales from all walks of life. For their second issue of 2011, Whiteley's idea was simple: get some guest editors, throw in work by local artists and writers, showcase it all at a local reading series, and call it a day.\n\nWhat ups the ante for this issue is the fact that guest editors the Zimmerman Brothers, identical twins Kent and Keith Zimmerman who reside in Oakland, California, definitely aren't without merit in their own right. Keith describes their career as \"living exclusively off the blank page.\" Since the 1980s the two have worked writing for music-based magazines, penning books and articles alongside such noted music icons as John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) singer of the Sex Pistols, rock legend Alice Cooper, and country musician Trace Atkins. They've released 17 books, with topics ranging from the Hell's Angels to the Black Panthers. \"We're associated with edgy topics and characters because that's where the great stories and the game-changer personalities spring from. Our latest book, Operation Family Secrets, takes place in modern day Chicago.\" says Keith. \"We must proclaim that we love Chicago VERY MUCH,\" continues Keith. \"We love its people, food, media writers and journalists, literary and cultural scene, hipsters, characters, and most of all the inspiring and incredible human dramas that emanate out of Chicago.\" Kent chimes in, \"Right now we're working on another project set in Chicago. For some reason, we can't escape Chicago.\"\n\nTheir work with Criminal Class focuses on a different side of their background. The brothers also work with inmates at California's San Quentin state prison, where their job as editors allowed them to include material from prisoners -- Criminal Class Review's \"Prison Issue\" features real criminals. The two describe it better, jumping over one another to finish the others' thoughts.\n\nThe Zimmerman Brothers\n\nKeith: We volunteer/teach our San Quentin class in a castoff area\n\ncalled H-Unit, population 1000 inmates, who live in bunks and dorms instead of cells like the lifers. It's called Finding Your Voice on the Page. We've been doing it steadily since 2003.\n\nKent: It all started eight years ago with a cold call to the woman in\n\ncharge of education. We brought along a copy of Hell's Angel, figuring it would either help us or sink us. The warden at the time assigned us to H-Unit where there were virtually no education programs.\n\nKeith: These guys may be only a couple years or months from being\n\nback on the streets, technically no more than ten years max.\n\nKent: These were the guys with release dates ready to move into your\n\nand my neighborhoods! We've chosen to stay in H-Unit ever since because we prefer the transient nature of the inmates. That way we have long time \"repeat offenders\" who keep taking the class along with a constant churn of new faces who come and go and sometimes come back.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Book Club /\n\nFeature Fri Jun 10 2011\n\nQuickies: The Final Whistle Blows\n\nThis is a guest post from John Wawrzaszek, a contributor to Newcity, publisher of the zine the Muse, the News, and the Noose, and Fiction Writing student at Columbia College. This feature is based on his interviews with Mary Hamilton and Lindsay Hunter.\n\nQuickies will have its final run on June 14th at Innertown Pub, 1935 W Thomas, at 7:30pm.\n\nFor a reading series notable for its short time limit, Quickies has\n\nbeen anything but. Two friends, Mary Hamilton and Lindsay Hunter, met\n\nin grad school at the School of the Art Institute's writing program. They began the reading series in March of 2008. \"It was kind of a wordless psychic communication,\" Hamilton puts it. Though that communication might live on, the series is set to sound its final whistle as co-founder Hamilton prepares to move to Los Angeles.\n\nQuickies prides itself on its name, allotting readers only four minutes to spit out their material. This leaves for a wide variety of almost anything, sort of: \"We have three rules,\" explains Hamilton, \"No poetry, no excerpts, and no cheating.\"\n\nThe fun ensues when a reader goes over time. The audience listens to the story with anticipation, silently wishing for the time to lapse. Standing in front of the pool table at the Innertown Pub, the home of Quickies, Hunter vigilantly holds the stopwatch. Hamilton is poised with a whistle, ready to jolt the packed bar once the readout passes\n\nfour minutes. \"Mary is cutthroat with the whistle,\" says Hunter. \"Anytime I want to mealy mouth about it she's like, 'Nope get off the stage.'\"\n\nA seemingly inseparable duo on stage, the pair came to this decision together. \"I can't imagine doing it without her,\" says Hunter. \"We are the yin to each other's yang.\" For the series' finale (happening June 14th), the lineup is a who's who of Chicago writers, most who have supported the series for years. The bill is packed, the eulogy to be performed by over 20 readers.\n\nQuickies' end leaves the literary scene out on a mainstay series, one that offers a unique event in a rapid-fire format. But the hosts, besides missing each other's company as hair trigger whistleblowing emcees, there's something more to be missed. \"The groupies,\" says Hamilton. \"Mary's groupies,\" jests Hunter.\n\n— Book Club\n\nFeature Fri Jun 03 2011\n\nJane Eyre @ Gene Siskel\n\nLooking for Charlotte Brontë's classic put to film in a centrally located, air-conditioned theater?

Each week, we'll feature an interview from a notable in Chicago's zine scene, and exposition on an aspect of the landscape as well as their role in it. This week is the final installment, capping off with Liz Mason. Thanks for reading, keep self-publishing, and see you at Zine Fest!\n\nAside from her blog and her zine (Liz's Masonic Lodge and Caboose, respectively), Liz Mason has been working at and managing Quimby's Bookstore for nearly a decade. The independent bookstore is way more than one of the Chicago Zine Fest sponsors. For 20 years, Quimby's has helped paper works by zinesters, writers and visual artists find homes on its shelves and window displays.\n\nNow that Chicago Zine Fest is finally here (!), many of those zines -- among hundreds of others, hailing from the Midwest to New Zealand -- are going to get some serious airtime outside of bookstores. It all starts this afternoon, with readings at Columbia College and 826CHI. From 9-11pm, Quimby's will be hosting Zinester Karaoke, provided by Mason and her husband Jo's very own Shameless Karaoke.\n\nTomorrow's zine exhibition and workshops will have Columbia College's Conaway Center packed with zinester tables from 10am-5pm, complementing the 2011 Revenge of Print challenge. All CZF events are free and open to the public, so grab a tote bag and start poring through those zines. Or just show up and make one.\n\nWhat was the first zine you made?\n\nIt was called Cul-de-sac, and I made it in 1997ish with one of my friends.\n\nWas it about cul-de-sacs?\n\nIt wasn't really about anything, it was about the ridiculous things we were writing at the time.\n\nHave you seen any shifts or patterns in zine topics during your time working at Quimby's?\n\nI do see sometimes there'll be things that seem like vibes or particular motifs that sort of serendipitously emerge. For awhile there seemed to be a lot of zines about this existential angst of animals. This anthropological quirkiness, I guess? The idea is that there's an animal who has these passionate feelings of ennui that humans do. There'll be a bird with philosophical ponderings, or an animal that's really sad or doesn't feel good about itself. The word balloons and captions will say things like \"I'm overweight!\". That seems like a theme that's going on lately.\n\nOne that immediately comes to mind is Adam Meuse. He did a comic called Sad Animals which was one of our best-sellers for awhile, although full disclosure: best-seller means you sell 3 or so of them a week. Then Anders Nilsen does Big Questions, which is not a zine, it's more of a comic. It's actually getting compiled into a book by Drawn & Quarterly. I did a parody of it, a comic called Fat Animals: An Obestiary. It was a spoof of animals that were really fat.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Book Club /\n\nFeature Fri Mar 18 2011\n\nDIY Refuses to Die: Chicago Zine Fest Year 2\n\nDIY Refuses to Die is a new, weekly feature by guest writer Taleen Kalenderian that will run in the weeks leading up to the Chicago Zine Fest, happening March 25th and 26th at various locations throughout the area.

Buy This Book, Unmarketable, and the blog Camb(l)o(g)dia, a journal of her experiences teaching self-publishing to young women in Cambodia.\n\nArdent zinester and co-editor at Punk Planet before it shuttered in 2007, Anne Elizabeth Moore has been a safeguard for counterculture in Chicago's independent media for years. She's exposed hunting marketers and corporate branding of the underground, using everything from handmade zines about Starbucks to books, notably Unmarketable: Brandalism, Copyfighting, Mocketing and the Erosion of Integrity.\n\nAnne Elizabeth Moore\n\nIn 2007 Moore journeyed to Cambodia to teach 32 young women living in Phnom Penh how to self-publish. The result was 75 zines that expressed contemporary issues in Cambodia exploring social justice, educational reform, cultural history, and New Girl Law, a revisionist artist book calling for gender equality and human rights.\n\nAn invited guest of Chicago Zine Fest, Moore will be reading from her book Cambodian Grrrl (to be rereleased on Cantankerous Titles at the end of summer) on Saturday, March 26, 3pm, at Columbia College's Conaway Center.\n\nWhat was the first zine you made?\n\nFor years I've been thinking I've made zines since I was 15, but I recently discovered my first zine.

Realizing that a Chicago zine community was in the make, with zines going unshared during Chicago winters, they decided to bring together the city's zinesters, comics artists and writers, hosting 45 exhibitor tables and self-publishing programs at Columbia College of Chicago.\n\nGet ready for year two: CZF has doubled in size, hosting 107 exhibitor tables that sold out in three weeks and taking up two floors in Columbia's Conaway Center, in addition to events and readings at Quimby's Bookstore and 826CHI. All events are free and open to the public, including letterpress and bookbinding workshops to foster and promote print culture. There's even a DIY Film Festival.\n\nWhether you want to trade some zines, swap skills or chime in on some zinester karaoke, it all takes place on Friday, March 25 and Saturday, March 26.

I'm working on a new zine right now about comics called Side Kick, but I've done a number of mini-comics that are all sort of one-shots.

We still keep that name in our title.\n\nIn 1971 I moved here and got an apartment at Beacon St. and Leland Ave. I sold records for a living, working at various record stores. In 1986 my sister wanted to retire from Chicago, and sold the store to me. 2011 is the start of my 25th year and the 45th anniversary of the shop.

Perhaps Mazza felt a connection with the ostracized character after having a Scarlet Letter experience of her own:\n\nThe most astonishing thing ever said to me at a reading was nothing -- utter silence. Not that I always consider silence to be an affront or expression of disrespect. A silent audience could have retreated inward to think, privately. Could be embarrassed, shaken, moved -- all things a writer who isn't really all that funny can hope for at readings. (Although I realize, when it comes to readings, funny is best.) But one time the silence was different:\n\nIn the late '90s a group of writers associated with independent, innovative presses planned to read together to celebrate Banned Books Week at Left Bank Books in St. Louis. I thought we discussed what we would read: material that might have been banned in previous eras. So the reading happened, and I read a very short story titled \"Hesitation,\" from my 1997 collection Former Virgin.\n\nI vaguely noticed that other pieces being read didn't seem to fit the \"would have been banned in previous eras\" theme. Maybe I made that up. After the reading, the authors sat in the reading space and the audience circulated, bringing books to be signed, asking questions, expressing their pleasure or appreciation for the piece an author had read. Not one soul talked to me or brought a book to be signed. When anyone came to talk to the writer I was sitting with, they did not look at me. To this day I don't understand what happened or what code I broke.\n\nJoin Mazza at the January 27 Various Men release, 6-9pm at May Street Cafe (1145 W. Cermak Road).\n\n— Ruthie Kott /\n\nFeature Mon Jan 03 2011\n\nAnswers and Questions: Paul Hornschemeier\n\nAnswers and Questions is a biweekly column that asks Chicago writers to remember the funniest or strangest things they've been asked in a question-and-answer session, during a talk, or in an interview.\n\nIn interviewing Evanston-based graphic novelist Paul Hornschemeier for a magazine story [aside: big thanks to the proofreader/fact-checker for making sure I didn't misspell his name], one thing he said more than once was that what's most important for creating a graphic novel is the ability to tell a story -- more important, even, than artistic ability.\n\nThis guy can tell a story:\n\nOn two separate occasions I've had people argue with me that I am not me. There is apparently some existential comedian writing the script of my life for moments like these to not only happen at conventions but also on the street (I am routinely the person stopped on the bus, on the street, etc. by someone who needs a special someone to explore their mental landscape... I just have that kind of face, I guess).\n\nAt one convention -- I was around 25 at the time -- I was setting up my books on the table when a man walked by. He noticed the name on the book, and he stopped.\n\n\"Is he here?\" the man asked.\n\nNever presuming anyone would be asking about me, especially not at a point where I had only a few things in publication, I responded, \"Sorry, who?\"\n\n\"Him,\" he repeated, pointing to the book. \"Paul Hornschemeier.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry, yeah. I'm him. That's me.\"\n\nThe man leaned back and cocked an eyebrow, momentarily entertaining the joke I had unknowingly made. \"Okay, sure. But seriously, is he here?\"\n\nI wasn't sure what was going on. \"Yes, I'm... I'm Paul Hornschemeier, like I said.\"\n\nThe man sighed and waved my gag off. \"Okay, never mind, I just wondered if he was here.\"\n\nI stood there open mouthed. Should I produce a driver's license? Was this even happening? Had I finally lost it?\n\nThe man walking away when he passed the next table, occupied by a cartoonist who knew me fairly well. The cartoonist looked up at the man and pointed back at me. \"Um, that really is him.\"\n\nThe man took this as gospel. \"OH! I thought you were joking. Sorry, but I thought you were like 50 years old and bald with a beard.\"\n\nOne of the characters in my books looks like this. And this isn't the only occasion where people expected me to look like the character. That character is also a symbolic logic professor and suicidally depressed, but nobody ever argued with me about having neither of those characteristics.\n\nAlso I was once asked if I thought Brandon Routh would reprise his role as Superman during a discussion of comics as fine art, but that was a far less sweat-inducing exchange.\n\nSee Hornschemeier's work at the Museum of Contemporary Art January 8-30 for a group show, New Chicago Comics.\n\n— Ruthie Kott\n\nFeature Mon Dec 27 2010\n\nStaff Picks 2010\n\nThe Book Club staff's compiled a list of our favorite titles this year -- not necessarily published in 2010, or even Chicago-centric, just what we liked, loved, and appreciated, and why.\n\nWhat book did it for you this year? Why? Drop us a line in the comments.\n\nRosamund Lannin: The Manual of Detection, Jedediah Berry\n\nThis appealingly odd and existential detective story navigates a city of curious horrors and delights, its uncertain protagonist working to the heart of a mystery as shadowy, ambiguous, and fantastical as the players behind it. Reminded me of Ray Bradbury but sparser, in a really good way. Fans of magical realism, eccentric heroes, or just a good puzzle, this book could be your latest literary pal, or maybe new best friend.\n\nEmily Wong: The Girl Who Fell from the Sky, Heidi Durrow\n\nThis book has a bit of everything: tragedy, the pain of racism, coming-of-age. The writer uses an interesting voice with short sentences that cut right to the chase. I couldn't put it down!\n\nFollow Emily on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ray_o_sun\n\nRuthie Kott: What Was She Thinking? Notes on a Scandal, Zoë Heller\n\nI have a thing for unreliable narrators. And characters with creepy obsessions.\n\nRebecca Hyland: The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Diaz\n\nThe Brief Wondrous Life is in fact a history-packed epic, told from multiple points of view. The story unfolds in an engaging, slang-y style sprinkled with kitchen-sink pop cultural references. He makes it all work. The novel is quite an achievement yet he makes it all seem effortless, like late night confessional tales unspooling at a memorable party.

How do I get him to notice me?\"\n\nBut the most awkward questions I remember were at a panel last year at the Chicago Cultural Center. The panel was called \"Going Pro: Taking Your Literary Venture to the Next Level,\" and my part was to talk about the editorial issues involved. I thought I'd made it pretty clear that my background was editorial; I had a handout called \"50 Questions for Editorial Planning.\" The other two panelists talked about the business aspects (profit vs. nonprofit, how to use corporate-speak, getting funding, etc.).\n\nThree of us spoke, then a moderator directed questions to us individually. She started with me -- and I didn't know the answer. I'm pretty comfortable with the idea that I don't know everything and that it's not shameful to admit it. So I lobbed the question to one of the other panelists.\n\nWhen it was my turn again, I couldn't believe it -- the second question was also completely outside my area! (Both of the questions were based on the assumption that I had actually started a literary business of my own at some point.) Deferring the first question might look cool and confident, but doing it twice would just look stupid. So I took a stab at it.\n\nBlab, blab, blab -- I spouted nonsense and sounded like a bag of hot air. I should have said, \"Honest, I really do know stuff! You just have to ask the right questions.\" I might at least have gotten a laugh.\n\nAnyway, I learned my lesson: next time I'm on the spot, I'll go for funny instead of fathead.\n\n— Ruthie Kott\n\nFeature Mon Dec 20 2010\n\nQ&A with Christian Wiman\n\nSome questions for Christian Wiman, editor of Poetry magazine and author of the poetry book, Every Riven Thing (among others!).\n\nGB: The definition of \"riven\" is \"to wrench open,\" \"tear apart or to pieces,\" or \"to split with force.\" Obviously, the book's title, Every Riven Thing, could describe your diagnosis of an incurable cancer tearing apart your life, but after reading the poems, I also feel that the diagnosis might have split open your relationship with God or put a crack in some of the beliefs you previously held about God and religion. Is there any truth to this?\n\nCW: It's hard for me to remember which poems were written when. There are poems in this book that are fifteen years old, and others that were written right before the book came out.\n\nI think you're right, though, to notice the radical mix of tones in the \"religious\" poems. Some, like the title poem, are clearly devotional; others are fraught with doubt and a sense of my own inadequacy; a couple are openly antagonistic to the whole notion of religion and belief.\n\nI needed them all. Need them all. \"God's truth is life,\" writes Patrick Kavanagh, \"even the grotesque shapes of its foulest fires.\"\n\nGB: An idea/image that spoke to me in this book is the burning of sermons (in \"Voice of One Head\" and \"Hermitage\"). I know what I took from that image, and I'm sure other readers find their own meanings in it. What does that particular image/description mean for you?\n\nCW: I don't really believe we can ever speak clearly and truly of god, much less speak his (his! -- even the pronoun is problematic) name. In both of those poems you mention (two of my personal favorites), language and existence have been pushed as far as they can be pushed -- by the subjects of the poems, I mean; I'm not claiming this as an accomplishment of the poems -- and the silence that ensues is a mixture of mortal defeat and mysterious grace.\n\nPlus, and perhaps more to the point, I just like the sound of \"burn\" and \"sermon\" together!\n\nGB: Now, less about topic and more about process...\n\nI'm the kind of writer who spits out lines randomly and eventually tries to put them together into a poem. Your work is very well-crafted, very musical, with an emphasis on sound and rhyme. Do you find it difficult to create poems like these? What is your process like?\n\nCW: I don't know if it's difficult. I mean, I don't really have anything else to compare it to. I never chose to write the way I do. I hear this music in my head, these rhythms wanting to be words, and I can't get any relief until I get the lines and the rhymes and the rhythms right. Sometimes a poem comes quite easily -- the title poem was written in a couple of hours one morning. Sometimes it will take years.\n\nGB: I love \"So Much a Poet He Despises Poetry\"; it reminds me of being completely burned out on poetry after I finished my poetry MFA program, but yet continuing to immerse myself in it - even being the managing editor of a poetry journal! Do you find being a poet difficult at times? Not just the difficulty in getting published, but do you feel you're driven to write and/or be involved in poetry, even if perhaps you don't particularly want to be at any given moment?\n\nCW: Yes, definitely. I get sick of poetry, especially contemporary poetry, and sometimes think I want nothing at all to do with it. And I get tired of the psychic pressures of writing poetry, the mental derangement it can not simply cause but seem to require. But that poem, I should admit, is actually making fun of someone (me!) who gets so sick and tired of poetry, who feels exhausted by the existential exposure of it (\"his soul's dainties\"), who has become so jaded that there's NOTHING to which he doesn't respond with a slight sneer.\n\nTo hell with that. I wrote the poem as a purgative, because I don't want to be that person. And because it was actually fun to write.\n\n— Emily Wong\n\nFeature Mon Dec 06 2010\n\nAnswers and Questions: David Heinzmann\n\nAnswers and Questions is a biweekly column that asks Chicago writers to remember the funniest or strangest things they've been asked in a question-and-answer session, during a talk, or in an interview.\n\nIf there's one thing I've learned from Say Yes to the Dress, it's to discuss how much you're planning to pay before your appointment. Otherwise, it just gets awkward. Perhaps this librarian learned that lesson after hosting a talk by David Heinzmann, a Chicago Tribune crime reporter and author of A Word to the Wise, a novel about modern-day organized crime in Chicago. Heinzmann writes:\n\nA couple months ago I had a signing at a small library downstate (in a town where I have family connections). It went well -- I sold a bunch of books -- and as I was driving back to Chicago I received an e-mail from the librarian who set up the event. She said the library board members were talking about how wonderful the talk was, and they realized it couldn't possibly have been free.

How about if your guests have literary inclinations? Sure, there are great independent bookstores, there are plenty of lively readings to check out, but can you put your finger on one thing that definitively encapsulates Chicago's literary history and cultural relevance? No? Well, local author Don Evans aims to change that.\n\nEvans calls Chicago \"the only place, of all the places I've experienced, that I know and love like a brother.\" He lived in London from 2002-2005 and made a decent dent in his passport visiting other European cities in that time, always making a point to seek out literary sites. \"The Dublin Writers Museum interested me the most,\" he said in an e-mail interview. \"Walking through that museum, there was no mistaking the value Ireland placed upon its literary contributors. The parts added up to a greater whole. When we settled back in Chicago, I saw, more clearly, a scattered and incomplete recognition of our own heritage. The culture entails countless tiny enclaves, only some of which overlap, and there would be no easy way, were you to try, to discover the heart of our heritage.\"\n\nAttempting to fill in this gap, Evans conceived of the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame. He brought the idea to Randy Richardson, president of the Chicago Writers Association, where Evans is a board member. Richardson called the idea \"something that is long overdue. For too long, Chicago has been known as the Second City. Putting a spotlight on our rich and proud literary tradition will let the rest of the world know what we here in Chicago's writing community already know -- that Chicago's literary heritage is second to none.\"\n\nSo the two amassed a dedicated team of volunteers, including Gapers Block's own Alice Maggio on the nominating committee. This past Saturday, November 20, they held their inaugural induction ceremony at the Northeastern Illinois University Auditorium. It was an elegant, dressy affair, complete with author-themed cocktails. You could feel the love in this labor of love.\n\nContinue reading this entry »\n\n— Rebecca Hyland /\n\nFeature Mon Nov 22 2010\n\nAnswers and Questions: Jamie Freveletti\n\nAnswers and Questions is a biweekly column that asks Chicago writers to remember the funniest or strangest things they've been asked in a question-and-answer session, during a talk, or in an interview.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Kevin Guilfoile answered our question with a bizarre fan story, and this week, Jamie Freveletti, a fellow contributing blogger to the Outfit collective of Chicago crime writers, shares an odd encounter. Freveletti, a trial lawyer, has published two thrillers about a very active protagonist: Running from the Devil (awarded Best First Novel by the International Thriller Writers) and Running Dark, which came out in June. Something about these thriller writers seems to attract interesting characters at their readings:\n\nMy signings have been fairly mainstream, but at a signing for Running Dark, a novel about Somali pirates attacking a cruise liner, I was approached by a friend of my cousin who was married to a Somali prince from the area of Eyl, the main pirate enclave in Somalia. He graciously offered me safe passage there, saying that no one would dare harm anyone under their protection. I was thinking \"How great is this? I'm going!\" but when I returned to Chicago, my husband gave me such an alarmed look that I had to rethink my trip.\n\nBut Freveletti hasn't given up on the idea; she's planning to meet with the couple to talk in more detail about a possible trip. Just a warning to any Somali pirates who might be thinking of attacking Freveletti: she has a black belt in aikido.\n\n— Ruthie Kott\n\nFeature Mon Nov 08 2010\n\nAnswers and Questions: Kevin Guilfoile\n\nAnswers and Questions is a biweekly column that asks Chicago writers to remember the funniest or strangest things they've been asked in a question-and-answer session, during a talk, or in an interview.\n\nSometimes writers have to deal with fans who watch way too much TV and think that fiction writers can solve crimes. And maybe some of them can. Just, self-admittedly, not Kevin Guilfoile, author of thrillers Cast of Shadows and The Thousand:\n\nThere are a couple of contenders, but the ones that are really bizarre are usually too rambling to properly recreate. I suppose the one that takes it all was at the Harold Washington Library a few years ago. I noticed this guy with a big box, like a banker's box, hanging around in the back of the room as I signed books for a line of readers. People who refuse to get in line but instead hang around waiting for the line to dwindle are red flags all the way. They clearly have A LOT they want to talk with you about and don't want anyone behind them pressuring them to move on. I imagine really famous authors must have a dozen hang-arounders at every signing. I'm not sure how they ever decide who goes last.\n\nAnyway, as the last person in line was getting her book signed this guy finally walked up with his box. He was big and tattooed and clearly very intelligent. He looked me straight in the eyes and spoke deliberately and sincerely, and I wish I could remember exactly what he said, but the gist of it was that he had been wrongly imprisoned and wanted me to write a book clearing his name. The box contained proof, and he began to go through it, showing me arrest reports and trial evidence and all kinds of papers I didn't understand.\n\nIt wasn't at all clear why he had chosen me for this task. He didn't seem to have any idea who I was or what kinds of books I wrote. After about five minutes of him talking and me nodding stupidly and probably explaining that I had no experience as a journalist, I think he decided I wasn't the right guy and he apologized and picked up his papers and left. I was too stunned to take notes, like I should have. And honestly I felt bad I couldn't help him. Or at least have the kind of investigative chops where I could find out if he was worth helping.\n\nIf he really was innocent, I hope he found a less dumbfounded guy -- maybe a lawyer instead of a writer -- to take up his cause.\n\n— Ruthie Kott\n\nFeature Thu Nov 04 2010\n\nWhat We're Reading: Garlic and Sapphires\n\nWhat We're Reading is a monthly column that asks Chicagoans about the books they're currently enjoying (or not).\n\nHeather\n\n28\n\nPiano teacher\n\nLives in Lakeview\n\nWhat are you reading?\n\nThe Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, Garlic and Sapphires by Ruth Reichl, and The Laments by George Hagen\n\nWhat's it about (in 20 words or less)?\n\nG&S is about [former New York Times food critic and former editor-in-chief of the now-defunct Gourmet magazine] Reichl's move to NYC (her birthplace) and how she deals with being a public figure in her new/old city.\n\nWhat drew you to this book?\n\nThis book is a book-club read, chosen because it's about food. My friend who picked it out loves writing and food -- what better combination is there?\n\nWhat kind of person would you recommend it to?\n\nSomeone who loves food, yes, but also anyone who loves a good story. This is by far the easiest to read of the three books I'm in the middle of right now.

Reading at home is a challenge because I always have a list of things I should be doing instead, but on the L all I have to do is read.\n\n— Ruthie Kott\n\nFeature Mon Oct 25 2010\n\nAnswers and Questions: Scott Kenemore\n\nAnswers and Questions is a biweekly column that asks Chicago writers to remember the funniest or strangest things they've been asked in a question-and-answer session, during a talk, or in an interview.\n\nWith tomorrow's planned zombie attack, it's a good thing we have our own undead expert Scott Kenemore to help us out. Well...maybe.\n\nOne question I am asked at virtually every reading is: \"What's your personal zombie survival plan?\" I don't have a lot of faith that a full-scale outbreak would be survivable, so my plan is usually just to fight zombies as awesomely as I can. Currently, I think this would involve taking a box of homemade Molotov cocktails to the roof of my building in Logan Square, and throwing them down on the zombies below to creating a giant mass of flaming zombies.\n\nSome fans want to understand zombies' mass appeal...\n\nAnother question I get frequently is: \"Why are zombies suddenly so popular?\" I reply that I think zombies are a reaction against vampires. Not all horror fans can relate to vampires, who tend to be well-dressed, need to be the center of attention, and seem fabulous at all times. A lot of horror fans prefer a monster who just gets things done without a lot of frou-frou. Zombies don't care how they look, or what people think about them. Zombies don't try to be suave or stylish. They just lumber in and eat your brain. Awesome.\n\n...while others (possibly doing fan-fiction research) just want to know about zombies' sex appeal.\n\nFor whatever reason, when I do readings at horror conventions, I tend to get a lot of graphic questions about zombie reproduction. Like:\n\n\"Can a male zombie get an erection? What if it's an undead zombie with no heartbeat and blood-pressure?\"\n\n\"Can a female zombie have a baby?\"\n\n\"What would happen if a human had sex with a zombie? Would they make a half-human, half-zombie baby?\"\n\nThese are not topics I write about in my books, so usually, my answers will depend on how many cocktails I have had before the reading.\n\n— Ruthie Kott\n\nFeature Tue Oct 12 2010\n\nOne-Shots: Jeremy Tinder\n\nDrawer and painter Jeremy Tinder has been teaching at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago since 2008, educating students in the ways of art, comics, and those who make it.

I think it was around age 5 when I really started getting into Garfield and tracing it out of the paper every day. Tracing the script. Before that I was really into Disney cartoons and Sesame Street. Garfield was my focus in life for six years, I was so into it. I didn't buy a real comic book til 6th grade: Ninja Turtles Adventures and an X-Men comic book.
