        "text": "Former National Public Radio CEO John Lansing has died, according to an announcement from NPR on Aug. 16. He was 67.\n\nJohn Lansing\n\nNPR reports that Lansing died at his home in Wisconsin on Wednesday, just six months after he relinquished his role at the network.\n\nLansing stepped down from his post as CEO this past spring, retiring after what NPR calls “a turbulent four-and-a-half year stint.”\n\nHis successor, NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher, responded to the news of Lansing’s passing on Friday.\n\n“John had a tremendous impact on NPR’s workplace culture and led the organization through some of its most difficult times,” wrote Maher in a statement. “His commitment to improving NPR’s audience and staff diversity has left an indelible positive impact.”\n\nShe continued: “John understood the importance of NPR’s mission to support democracy by informing the American public, and led the organization to rise to the challenge of an unprecedented global pandemic.”\n\nIn another statement, Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said Lansing’s contributions to public radio have left a lasting impact.\n\n“John led NPR through a tumultuous period, which included a rapidly changing news environment,” wrote Harrison. “His steady leadership kept NPR’s reporting on the air during the early days of the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”\n\nBefore joining NPR in 2019, Lansing was chief of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the government outfit that oversees federally-funded international broadcasters such as the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia.\n\nBefore that, he served as CEO of Cable & Telecommunications Association for Marketing (CTAM), a marketing association comprised of 90 of the top U.S. and Canadian cable companies and television programmers. Lansing also spent nine years as president of Scripps Networks, according to his bio.\n\n[Sign Up for Radio World’s SmartBrief Newsletter]\n\nThe post John Lansing, Former NPR CEO, Dies appeared first on Radio World.\n\nThe National Association of Farm Broadcasting has chosen broadcast veteran Chad Smith to be its new NAFB News Service editor. Smith joins the NAFB full-time after serving as a contract editor and reporter for the News Service for more than 10 years.\n\nChad Smith (Credit: NAFB)\n\nAccording to the association, Smith will now manage the daily and ongoing operations of the NAFB News Service, including editing, creating new content and delivering stories provided by member broadcasters. The News Service is NAFB’s in-house ag news production and distribution service that reaches farmers, ranchers and other rural audiences across the country. Farm broadcasters can use the service to access regional and national agriculture news.\n\n“Bringing Chad on board at NAFB in a full-time role was a natural choice,” says Gardner Hatch, NAFB executive director. “He brings tremendous experience and creativity to the News Service position as we look to expand the resources and services that it provides to our Broadcast and Allied Industry Council members.”\n\nSmith previously served as farm director and morning show host at KLGR Radio in Redwood Falls, Minn., as well as an assistant sports editor and production manager at KWAT/KIXX/KDLO Radio in Watertown, S.D. He has also worked as a freelance journalist and media consultant.\n\n“Working in farm radio has been a passion of mine for a long time,” said Smith in the release. “I am looking forward to leading and growing the News Service and helping farm broadcasters do their jobs by delivering the content and resources that they need.”\n\n[Sign Up for Radio World’s SmartBrief Newsletter]\n\nThe post NAFB Names Chad Smith as Its News Service Editor appeared first on Radio World.\n\nThe “sports-first” cable TV replacement product that sees FOX Corporation, Warner Bros. Discovery and ESPN parent The Walt Disney Company teaming up to create Venu Sports has received a significant setback, courtesy of a Federal District Court in New York.\n\nIn an Opinion and Order released on Friday, District Judge Margaret Garnett ordered the joint venture participants from launching the forthcoming OTT platform pending the court’s final ruling.\n\nIt’s a win for “sports first” vMVPD Fubo, which has vigorously fought against the creation of a “Hulu for Sports” by the three media giants for months.\n\n“The underlying motives and implication of this joint venture also command our scrutiny,” the company said on February 7. Then came the February 20 filing of an antitrust lawsuit in a New York federal district court against FOX Corp., WBD and Disney — a move that was designed to put a stop to its plans.\n\nThis appears to have been successful, with a planned fall debut for Venu now in question.\n\nGarnett issued a 69-page order granting Fubo’s motion. Citing a Columbia Pictures Indus. Inc. case, she declared, “Because the parties should be able to litigate this crucial issue on a full and fair record, and because doing so requires the preservation of the status quo, the Court, having considered and weighed all competing interests before it, finds that ‘[a]ny doubt concerning the necessity of the safeguarding of the public interest should be resolved by the granting of a preliminary injunction.'”\n\nShe also centers on testimony from Big Ten Conference Commissioner Tony Petitti, ruling that “nothing” he said under oath “suggests that the JV will be pro-competitive.” She noted, “Petitti’s testimony was that the Big Ten cares predominantly about increasing viewership of its content, regardless of the source of those viewers, and his support for the JV was premised on the assumption that it might be another place for sports fans to find Big Ten sporting events.”\n\nThe judge also pointed to the views of Dish and DirecTV, who have also spoken out against the creation of Venu Sports as anti-competitive. DirecTV Head of Communications and Community Jon Greer cheered Garnett’s ruling. “We are pleased with the court decision and believe that it appropriately recognizes the potential harms of allowing major programmers to license their content to an affiliated distributor on more favorable terms than they license their content to third parties,” she said.\n\nGarnett also dismissed the claims by FOX, Disney and WBD that Fubo’s harms are not the result of the JV but are instead the consequences of Fubo’s status as a “weak competitor.”\n\nShe said, “Fubo need not show it will achieve any particular metric of extraordinary success absent the JV, so long as it can show that it would be a going concern absent the launch and likely will not be one for long following the launch. The record is clear that the causal engine of Fubo’s predicted demise is the launch of the JV, and an injunction must therefore issue because “[i]t is well settled in this circuit that [m]ajor disruption of a business can be as harmful as termination[.]”\n\n‘A VICTORY FOR CONSUMERS’\n\nIn a statement distributed at 4pm Eastern by Fubo, co-founder and CEO David Gandler commented, “Today’s ruling is a victory not only for Fubo but also for consumers. This decision will help ensure that consumers have access to a more competitive marketplace with multiple sports streaming options.”\n\nThat said, the battle between Venu Sports and Fubo is not over.\n\n“Fubo has said all along that we seek equal treatment from these media giants, and a level playing field in our industry,” Gandler said. “The proposed joint venture was only the latest example of anticompetitive practices that The Walt Disney Company, FOX Corp. and Warner Bros. Discovery have consistently engaged in for many years. We believe these practices monopolize the market, stifle competition and cheat consumers from deserved choice. A fair and competitive marketplace is necessary to provide consumers with multiple, robust and more affordable sports streaming options. We will continue to fight for fairness and for what’s best for consumers.”\n\nA court date for the antitrust lawsuit has not yet been announced.\n\nKellogg Hansen represented Fubo in its legal proceedings.\n\nThe New SR Control Room at the Congresshalle in Saarbrücken, Germany. (Photo courtesy Saarländischer Rundfunk and Lawo)\n\nFrom our Who’s Buying What page: Since opening in 1967, the Congresshalle in central Saarbrücken, Germany, has hosted a wide range of events, including concerts and broadcasts hosted by regional public-service broadcaster Saarländischer Rundfunk.\n\nThe hall underwent a full renovation between December 2021 and September 2023, and SR used that as an opportunity to refit its control room with a modern IP-based set up.\n\n“With the new audio technology in our control room in the Congress Hall, we have taken a first step into the IP world, which gives us considerable freedom in production,” stated Ralf Schnellbach, head of radio production technology at SR and project manager for this installation. “It makes many things easier, faster and clearer, such as switching between 48 and 96 kHz or signal management with the new user lists.”\n\nTo achieve this, SR installed a Lawo mc²36 MkII production mixing console along with two Lawo AoIP stageboxes. The console includes 256 channels of integrated processing at both 48 and 96 kHz, allowing SR to handle even large orchestral programs from the Congresshalle’s Grand Auditorium. The console also offers support for ST 2110, AES67, RAVENNA and Ember+ protocols.\n\n“With this installation, a smart and economically very lean sound control room was created, whose components can be moved for mobile use without great effort, like for festivals during the summer break,” Schnellbach stated.\n\nBased on many years of good experience with Lawo systems as well as the company’s project and customer support, SR opted for a setup from the Rastatt-based manufacturer for the Congress Hall installation.\n\nThe post SR Refits Congresshalle Studio for IP appeared first on Radio World.\n\nA federal bankruptcy judge has approved Audacy’s request for a six-week extension of an important debt deadline.\n\nAs we reported earlier this week, Audacy filed an emergency motion to push back a key maturities date to the end of September. As a result, a short hearing was held Thursday in front of Judge Christopher Lopez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston.\n\nAudacy explained to the judge that it is still awaiting FCC approval of its Chapter 11 reorganization.\n\n“We had always anticipated that it would take approximately 4 to 6 months to receive FCC approval from or after the date from which the application was submitted,” bankruptcy lawyer Caroline Reckler of Latham & Watkins told the judge in the hearing, “and we remain within that window, albeit at the latter end.”\n\nShe said Audacy is optimistic it will receive FCC approval soon.\n\n“That said, the FCC’s actions are ultimately outside of our control and there is no deadline by which the FCC must act.”\n\nThe judge’s approval of the emergency motion essentially preserves the status quo of agreements between the company and its lenders for another six weeks.\n\nReckler told the judge Audacy had “worked diligently with our lenders to extend the maturities deadlines through Sept. 30. We very much appreciate the lenders’ support. They’ve worked very cooperatively and constructively with us to get the company ready to emerge from bankruptcy and on these extensions.”\n\n[Related: “Cruz: The Full FCC Will Vote on Audacy Reorg”]\n\nThe post Judge Extends Key Deadline in Audacy Ch. 11 Case appeared first on Radio World.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. — Former NPR Chief Executive Officer John Lansing died on Wednesday (8/14) at his Wisconsin residents, some six months after departing from the role.\n\nNPR reports that Lansing’s cause of death was not immediately known. However, Lansing in March 2021 was away from NPR for several weeks to recover from heart surgery.\n\nLansing, 67, enjoyed a career that involved navigating some media organizations through bumpy periods in their history. This included his time at NPR, which began in October 2019.\n\nNews of Lansing’s departure came in September 2023, when word came of his retirement at the end of the year. The announcement came just weeks after RBR+TVBR reported that the chief programming executive at NPR will conclude her tenure at the end of the year, ending a nearly 30-year tenure that includes on-demand audio innovations. This came after the June 2023 arrival of Daphne Kwon as Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAccording to NPR reporter David Folkenflik, who shared news of Lansing’s passing on Friday, the former CEO had a five-year contract set to expire at the end of September 2024.\n\nIn a note to staff sent by Lansing at the time, he commented, “We have been through a lot together over the past four years, and you have made me proud every day. During the pandemic, we were there when America needed us most, reporting truthful life-saving information when disinformation was rampant. And we were there when America went through an overdue racial reckoning. Our journalists did remarkable work covering the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and when Russia launched its war against Ukraine. We were also there when our audiences needed joy, laughter and connection in those moments that felt so bleak. All of you — and I mean every person working in every role at every level of this company — played a role in serving our audiences and the public interest at a time of incredible need. You should all stand proud, and it has been the honor of my career to have you as colleagues.”\n\nPrior to joining NPR, Lansing was the CEO of United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) overseeing several global networks including Voice of America, the international voice of the U.S. government.\n\nLansing started his news industry career at age 17 as a studio technician and cameraman at WPSD-TV in Paducah, Ky. He would later spend two decades at Scripps Networks, and was a Station Manager of WXYZ-7 in Detroit before landing the role of President of Scripps Networks from 2005-2013, leading Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, DIY, Cooking Channel and Great American Country.\n\nIn a statement, current NPR President/CEO Katherine Maher said the organization and the “entire public media system mourn the loss” of Lansing. “John had a tremendous impact on NPR’s workplace culture and led the organization through some of its most difficult times,” she said. “His commitment to improving NPR’s audience and staff diversity has left an indelible positive impact. He cared deeply about diversity and inclusion; he lived by his values every day, resulting in a staff and leadership team markedly more diverse than when he arrived. John understood the importance of NPR’s mission to support democracy by informing the American public, and led the organization to rise to the challenge of an unprecedented global pandemic. His speed and decisiveness during that difficult period enabled NPR to maintain uninterrupted, high-quality programming at a moment when trustworthy news was a lifeline to Americans. He inspired those around him with his integrity and compassion, and his loss will be felt deeply by our staff and across the public radio system.”\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. — All five Commissions have voted in favor of begin a proceeding to update the Citizens Broadband Radio Service.\n\n“Building on years of successful interagency collaboration, the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeks comment on a wide range of potential rule changes to improve the Citizens Broadband Radio Service for all current and future users of the 3.55-3.7 GHz band (3.5 GHz band),” the FCC said on Friday.\n\nPreserving and enhancing the Citizens Broadband Radio Service “continues the Commission’s commitment to develop innovative, collaborative mechanisms to facilitate greater spectrum use,” the Commission said. “This NPRM follows other innovative spectrum management approaches taken earlier this year, such as the Commission’s adoption of the Supplemental Coverage from Space licensing framework and the approval of Automated Frequency Systems to manage unlicensed use in the 6 GHz band.”\n\nThe 3.5 GHz band uses a three-tiered spectrum sharing model that protects Incumbent Access users, allows for geographically licensed operations following the FCC’s 2020 auction of Priority Access Licenses, and permits opportunistic licensed-by-rule General Authorized Access use for a wide variety of uses, including operations within factories, cities, hospitals, research centers, schools, public libraries, and utilities.\n\nThe NPRM proposes to add definitions to part 96 related to protection of federal incumbent users and modify other part 96 rules governing such protections. It also proposes to sunset rules related to the transition of grandfathered wireless broadband services in the 3.65-3.7 GHz band. In addition to the specific proposals related to federal protection, the NPRM seeks comment on, among other things, whether to align 3.5 GHz protection methodologies with those in adjacent bands, revisit our Environmental Sensing Capability approval procedures, and facilitate the continued introduction of Citizens Broadband Radio Service in areas outside of the contiguous United States.\n\nWith adoption of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FCC will take comment on the proposals in this item. Comments may be submitted through and read in the FCC’s Electronic Comment Filing System. Comments will be due in GN Docket No. 17-258 30 days after Federal Register publication of the NPRM, and reply comments will be due 60 days after Federal Register publication.\n\nThe REKTS Antennas at Puntan Agingan on Saipan in 2011. (Photo via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Voice of America is shuttering its Robert E. Kamosa Transmitting Station in the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nThe move was reported by local media in the U.S. Pacific territory based upon a statement from William S. Martin, director of the Operations & Stations Division of the Office of Technology, Services & Innovation, at the United States Agency for Global Media.\n\n“I suspect your organization has heard over the past week(s) about a big change taking place at the U.S. Agency for Global Media’s Robert E. Kamosa Transmitting Station or REKTS. The change is a discontinuation of all shortwave radio transmissions at our Saipan and Tinian sites, the first step in closing the station,” Martin wrote.\n\nREKTS consists of a transmitter and antenna system at Agingan Point at the southwestern point of Saipan and a second transmitter and antenna system on the western side of Tinian. The site is used for multi-language programming from Radio Free Asia and Voice of America into the East Asia region.\n\nMartin’s statement stressed that “USAGM is not abandoning shortwave, but it is reducing broadcasts in places with no discernible shortwave audience and consolidating its global transmission network. The REKTS closure is a consequence of this consolidation effort.”\n\nThe statement noted that shortwave listenership has dropped since the end of the Cold War and the rise of access to Internet-based media and information.\n\n“Further, shortwave broadcasting is increasingly expensive, especially compared to other platforms that are more popular with global audiences,” wrote Martin. “USAGM and other broadcasters have sought to balance maintaining costly legacy shortwave operations with investing in other platforms that reach much larger audiences.”\n\n[Related: “Where VOA’s Broadcast Infrastructure Stands Today” (2022)]\n\nAn additional challenge for REKTS was lingering damage from Category 5 Super Typhoon Yutu, which destroyed the station’s infrastructure in October 2018.\n\nAccording to USAGM’s FY2023 Agency Financial Report, the storm shredded the 16 shortwave curtain antennas at the site and downed one of its support towers. Using salvaged parts, five antennas fully restored by the end of FY 2020, and three more were back in operation by end of FY 2023 with parts for three additional antennas on site.\n\nAccording the report, the total assets held by USAGM in the Northern Mariana Islands had an approximate book value of $5.4 million as of Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nPreviously, in the agency’s 2025 budget justification document, USAGM predicted it would have 11 of the 15 REKTS shortwave antennas fully operational by the end of FY2025. Additional capital improvements needed at the site included reroofing to prevent water leaks.\n\nThe site on Saipan first went on air in 1982 as Superrock KYOI, a commercial station targeting Japan with rock and pop music. It was acquired in 1986 by Herald Broadcasting Service. Radio Free Asia began leasing the transmitters in September 1996, purchasing the facility in 1999.\n\nConstruction of the Tinian site began in 1993 when the U.S. Department of Defense transferred 834 acres of land on the island to the U.S. Information Agency. The first transmissions from the site began in January 1999.\n\n[Sign Up for Radio World’s SmartBrief Newsletter]\n\nThe post VOA Is Shuttering Its Marianas Shortwave Site appeared first on Radio World.\n\nWhile watching the closing ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, public speaking coach Rosemary Ravinal felt inspired to look for a link between public speaking and the Games. “One is about delivering powerful speeches while the other is about competing in sports,” she writes in this new column. “Yet, both involve performing under pressure and captivating an audience. There are lessons to glean from the world’s best athletes.”\n\nBy Rosemary Ravinal\n\nWithout question, the Olympic Games are the pinnacle of athletic achievement with thousands of stories of physical prowess, mental fortitude, grit, and dedication. The athletes’ success is not solely determined by physical ability. Strategy, and mental conditioning are crucial, too. Similarly, effective public speaking demands thorough preparation and a winner’s mindset to communicate messages clearly and effectively.\n\nThe blend of preparation, mental fortitude, and skill were on display when U.S. track and field champion Gabby Thomas won three gold medals, most notably in the women’s 200 meter. When asked how she got herself ready, the Harvard graduate with a master’s in public health said she did it by “keeping things light, joking around with other competitors, and not making the moment too heavy.”\n\nWhile other runners might have a ritual of high-tempo music to boost their energy before taking their place in the starting blocks, Thomas doesn’t listen to her adrenaline laced playlist before a race. She prefers to be in a quiet mental space. “I want to be so Zen, I want to be so relaxed, and I want to preserve my energy,” she explained. “And then the split second when the gun goes off, that’s when I want to feel that pump-up energy.”\n\nJust as athletes practice their pre-competition rituals to deal with performance anxiety, presenters need their own routines to focus, tame the jitters and deliver with ease and confidence. Athletes experience the high stakes of competition, where one mistake can affect their chances of winning. Public speakers face the anxiety of addressing an audience, where every word and gesture is scrutinized. Mental resilience is vital in both fields. Both athletes and speakers commonly use techniques like breathwork, visualization, body scans, laughter, and music to overcome nervousness.\n\nOlympians are symbols of inspiration. Their personal journeys become touchstones for courage, sacrifice, and triumph of the human spirit. From GOAT gymnast Simone Biles’ comeback story to newly minted champions like 4x gold medal swimmer Léon Marchand who rose from obscurity to French legend in the span of days, there are thousands of stories of challenges met and overcome. When woven into your keynote address or motivational talk, these stories can create deep emotional resonance and lead to profound impact and change.\n\nThe connection between public speaking and the Olympics offers valuable lessons for both athletes and speakers. While the world’s attention remains focused on the Olympians as they return home and share their experiences with local media, pay attention to their accounts and seek out stories that will enrich your speaking.\n\nContact Rosemary Ravinal for details on public speaking training programs or one-on-one coaching services in any of the following areas, in both English and Spanish:\n\nPublic Speaking\n\nMedia Readiness\n\nPresentation Skills\n\ninfo@rosemaryravinal.com\n\nHe has programmed radio stations for Cumulus Media for more than 20 years.

I originally listened as a young boy with a crystal radio with a long wire antenna. In high school I built my first radio, a Heathkit GR-91 in 1962. It still works today.\n\nI also belonged to the radio club [in high school] and got my first taste of broadcasting. Great fun. I eventually earned my FCC Second Class license and ham radio license (KA1AWI).\n\nOver the years, I was a backup engineer and occasional DJ at local radio stations. My main work was LMR radio, which came in handy when the stations started using Marti remote radio equipment. Remotes were always fun, especially when on the water.\n\nAttached are photos of radios I own and still use. Most trucks in the 60’s and 70’s were not equipped with radios, so the little Audiovox with a clip-on antenna worked great (remember gutters on vehicles?). Today, instead of shortwave, I stream music from foreign countries on a Kindle with external speakers.\n\nHere’s how the author has listened to the radio over 60-plus years.
