        "text": "NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) Frequencies Seven Frequencies in the VHF Public Service Band\n\n162.400 MHz 162.500 MHz 162.425 MHz 162.525 MHz 162.450 MHz 162.550 MHz 162.475 MHz Note: Channel numbers, e.g., WX1, WX2, etc. have no special significance but are often designated this way in consumer equipment. Other channel numbering schemes are also possible.\n\nThe NWR network continuously broadcasts local and nearshore coastal marine forecasts produced by local Weather Forecast Offices. Coastal stations broadcast predicted tides and real time observations from buoys and coastal meteorological stations operated by the National Data Buoy Center. Based on user demand, where feasible, NWS also broadcasts Offshore and Open Lake forecasts.\n\nTp use NWR, you must program your radio to the right frequency. As you transit along the coastline, you will will need to reset your radio to continue receiving NWR broadcasts.\n\nCoverage\n\nThe NWR network provides near continuous coverage for most coastal areas served by NWS offices. Typical coverage is 25 nautical miles offshore. To expand NWR coverage in Alaska, NWS and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) established a network of low-power 5-watt NWR transmitters at USCG \"high\" sites from the Dixon Entrance to Bristol Bay, AK. These low power transmitters operate on standard NWR frequencies under joint licensing with the NWS. (For more information, see NWR at USCG Sites in Alaska.) Locations of coastal NWR stations are listed in the Station Listing and Coverage page. Click on \"Call Sign\" to see the NWR broadcast footprint.\n\nSeveral NWR transmitters are Marine-Only, broadcasting marine information on a more rapid cycle than possible with All-Hazard transmitters. These transmitters are typically established as part of a cooperative effort between the local marine community and NWS. For information on how to establish a Marine-Only transmitter in your area, contact NWS.\n\nEquipment\n\nChannel numbers on some receivers, e.g., WX1, WX2, have no special significance. Most VHF marine radiotelephones have the ability to receive NWR broadcasts; however, NWS recommends having a separate NWR receiver aboard so mariners may maintain a simultaneous watch on NWR and marine VHF channels. Information on Rules which require listening to your VHF marine radio are available courtesy of the USCG Maritime Telecommunications Information Webpage.\n\nAudio\n\nIf you hear words in a broadcast which you feel need to have the pronunciation adjusted, forward your comments to the appropriate NWS forecast office so they can attempt to improve the pronunciation.\n\n1050 Hz Warning Alarm TONE ALERTS\n\nNWS transmits an automated 1050 Hz tone that automatically activates compatible NWR receivers when a severe weather situation exists anywhere in the transmitter's coverage area. Many (but not all) NWR receivers incorporate this feature. Many VHF marine radiotelephones incorporate this feature, however some require an active NWR channel and using a non-scanning mode for the highest level of effectiveness. Therefore, NWS again recommends having a separate NWR receiver aboard to maintain a simultaneous watch on NWR and marine VHF channels.\n\nIn accordance with national policy, and at forecaster discretion, the 1050 Hz tone may not be transmitted for marine events. This is done to avoid frequently alerting users ashore.\n\nSpecific Area Message Encoding (SAME) ALERTS\n\nA digital encoding system incorporating technology known as SAME allows receivers equipped with the SAME feature to automatically sound an alert for only certain weather conditions or within a limited geographic, area such as a county or a marine zone. Unlike the 1050 Hz Warning Alarm Tone, the Event Codes listed in Table * (bottom of page) are always transmitted using SAME codes. Note that few VHF marine radiotelephones contain the SAME feature. Most marine radios require selecting an active NWR channel and using a non-scanning mode for the highest level of effectiveness.\n\nYou must program the NWR receiver to the proper station frequency, SAME geographic codes(s), and SAME event codes(s), for it to function as intended. SAME codes for all NWS marine zones can be found in the Marine Text Forecasts by Zone section.\n\nSAME Geographic Codes\n\nNWS uses 6-digit SAME geographic codes to program SAME-capable NWR receivers to receive alert messages for user-specified areas. To maintain weather awareness, mariners are highly encouraged to enter the SAME geographic codes for nearby land areas.\n\nThis is particularly critical because many navigable marine areas, such as rivers, smaller bays and tributaries, are not part of designated NWS marine zones. Consult the NWR County by County page for these codes.\n\nFor a listing of marine SAME geographic codes, see the marine portion of Marine Text Forecasts by Zone. Here is a simple text listing of all marine SAME geographic codes. Although SAME geographic codes exist for offshore forecast zones, Great Lakes MAFORs and forecast synopses, they are not broadcast on NWR. The first digit of the marine SAME geograpahic code is 0, the second and third digits correspond to the \"pseudo\" state code, corresponding to broad coastal areas, as follows:\n\nState Code\n\nThe Marine Area\n\n73 Western North Atlantic Ocean, and along U.S. East Coast, from Canadian border south to Currituck Beach Light, NC. 75 Western North Atlantic Ocean, and along U.S. East Coast south of Currituck Beach Light, NC, following the coastline into Gulf of Mexico to Ocean Reef, FL, including the Caribbean. 77 Gulf of Mexico, and along the U.S. Gulf Coast from the Mexican border to Ocean Reef, FL 57 Eastern North Pacific Ocean, and along U.S. West Coast from Canadian border to Mexican border 58 North Pacific Ocean near Alaska, and along Alaska coastline, including the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska 59 Central Pacific Ocean, including Hawaiian waters 65 Western Pacific Ocean, including Mariana Islands waters 61 South Central Pacific Ocean, including American Samoa waters 91 Lake Superior 92 Lake Michigan 93 Lake Huron 94 Lake St. Clair 96 Lake Erie 97 Lake Ontario 98 St. Lawrence River above St. Regis\n\nAs one example, when consulting the marine codes for the Atlantic, the marine zone for the Chesapeake Bay from North Beach to Drum Point, MD, is zone 534. Since the \"pseudo\" state code is 73, the 6 digit SAME geographic code is 073534.\n\nSimilarly, NWS recommends that mariners program their NWR receivers with the SAME geographic codes of regional marine areas to maintain a greater level of weather awareness.\n\nSAME Geographic Codes For Mariners In Transit\n\nFor mariners in transit who are using NWR receivers or marine VHF radios with SAME capability, NWS recommends programming the radio to the All County Code Option, if available, to avoid the need to enter each discrete SAME geographic code as the vessel moves along the coast. In this mode, the receiver will alarm for all watches, warnings and emergency messages, much like a conventional warning alarm receiver ensuring the greatest margin of safety.\n\nFor NWR SAME receivers able to receive SAME alerts for all counties within a given state, set the county code portion of the SAME geographic code to 000 for a state (e.g., 024000 for Maryland). The SAME geographic codes for marine areas use pseudo-state codes listed in the table above.\n\nSimilarly, a mariner on Chesapeake Bay in Maryland using an NWR receiver with a SAME alert capability for receiving alerts for all counties within a given state would enter a SAME geographic code of 073000 to receive warnings of any marine weather event in the general area, rather than having to program the receiver for several neighboring marine zones. Entering the SAME geographic code for Maryland, 024000, would not alert the user for any marine weather events.\n\nAs another example, a mariner in transit using an NWR receiver with SAME and \"all-state\" code capability could enter 073000 to receive all broadcasted NWR warnings for marine areas between the Canadian border and Currituck Beach Light, NC. Once again, you must change NWR frequencies as you travel along the coastline.\n\nSAME Event Codes\n\nSome receiver equipment allows users to specific the Event Codes for which they wish to be notified. If the receiver contains this feature, the mariner should program their receiver for the following SAME event codes which are applicable to marine zones. See Emergency Alert System/NWR-SAME Event Codes and your receiver's operating manual for further information on event codes, including those for non-weather events."
