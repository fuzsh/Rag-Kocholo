This is a VERY EXCITING and UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY that would help our low power stations exponentially!\n\nIt is important for EVERYONE who cares about community broadcasting in the United States to file comments in support of Simple LPFM 250 as proposed in RM-11909.\n\nTALKING POINTS:\n\nTell the FCC commissioners that you support a Simple LPFM 250 as proposed in RM-11909.\n\nLet them know what LPFM or community station you enjoy on the FM dial (WSLR 96.5 and WBPV 100.1). Right now it looks like WBPV would be eligible for the upgrade; WSLR would not be based on our geographic location.\n\nTell them why local broadcasting is important to you, your community, our society. Discuss the opportunities it provides for populations underserved by mainstream media.\n\nDiscuss technical issues with the current 100 watts permitted by the FCC. This includes inability to get FM signal beyond a few miles from the transmitter site and difficulty receiving FM signal inside certain buildings within this limited range.\n\nDiscuss local populations that may be excluded by the low wattage.\n\nRecognize the LPFM 250 power increase as solution for alleviating these issues.\n\nDiscuss benefits to the local population and to society as a whole if community radio stations were allowed to increase their power.\n\nEncourage the FCC Commissioners to accept the LPFM 250 proposal.\n\n*********************************\n\nSUBMIT BY JUNE 21, 2021\n\n*********************************\n\nTo get to the FCC’s Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) visit https://fcc.gov/ecfs/\n\nAt the top menu, click the link that reads “Submit a FILING”.\n\nFill in the “PROCEEDINGS” field with RM-11909.\n\nFill in your name, address and email address, it is mainly self-explanatory.\n\nThe filing type is “Comment”.\n\nSkip fields with no asterisk (*)\n\nMaintain decorum and stay professional. All comments will become public record.\n\nClick.. click.. done!\n\nOnce submitted, the comments may take up to 48 business hours to show up in the ECFS system for review."
