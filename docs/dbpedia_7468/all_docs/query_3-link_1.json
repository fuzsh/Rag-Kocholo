        "text": "WSLR, Inc. was formed in 2004 to govern the operation of a 100 watt low-power, non-commercial community radio station. WSLR 96.5 LPFM began broadcasting August 2005 thanks to the hard work of a small group of dedicated volunteers.\n\nWSLR is a Pacifica affiliate. In alignment with the original purpose of Pacifica stations, WSLR’s programming promotes peace, social and economic justice, democracy and sustainability and presents voices often neglected by the mainstream. We embrace diversity and freedom of expression. The Pacifica Affiliate network includes approximately 200 independent radio stations, primarily in the United States…but there are also affiliates in Canada, Europe, and Africa.\n\nWSLR is more than radio.\n\nCommunity events also serve as a public extension of our programming and mission. Through the Fogartyville Community Media and Arts Center we produce over 60 live concerts a year, host over 35 educational events, and provide low-cost space to like-minded non-profit organizations.\n\nTogether WSLR+Fogartyville celebrate and promote the creative, cultural and political vitality of the local community.
