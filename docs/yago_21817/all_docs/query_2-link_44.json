I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of weird stuff that‚Äôs been coming up lately, so grab a cup of tea, settle in, and let‚Äôs dive into my story.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a part of my email list you‚Äôd know that I‚Äôm kind of going through it. You really never know when grief is going to hit. You can‚Äôt plan for hard times and emotional distress, but I‚Äôm really grateful to have practices in place to ground & heal my nervous system.\n\nMy Midnight Thoughts\n\nThe other night, I woke up with a whirlwind of thoughts racing through my mind. So I did what any normal person would do and I took out my notes app in the middle of the night and typed out all my thoughts so I could go back to sleep.\n\nI normally get pretty vulnerable in this space, but what I‚Äôm about to share is probably the most vulnerable I‚Äôve ever been. Vulnerability is such a pillar of my brand because I believe that vulnerability breeds connection and I‚Äôve always wanted to build a business like that.\n\nBut first, a little backstory ‚Äî I‚Äôve been connecting with my team on how I want my content to be delivered on each of my different platforms because I realized the importance of creating different tiers of connection, kind of like a concert audience, where each level offers a more intimate experience‚Ä¶\n\nFor Instance‚Ä¶\n\nMy Instagram community is the audience that‚Äôs witnessing content from the surface. Not that I‚Äôm ‚Äúclosed off‚Äù there, but that community is just in the audience and following along. My podcast community has front-row seats that involve a touch deeper connection and more context around the stories I share. My email list is the backstage pass. This community offers more intimacy, vulnerability, and a closer glimpse into my true self. Finally, my membership, The Empire Society, is the real deep behind-the-scenes experience (like you‚Äôre on the tour bus traveling with me), where I share everything.\n\nThrowback To Little Ashley\n\nI grew up in a blue collar family that worked their asses off but often faced struggles, specifically financial struggles. My dad had a pessimistic outlook on life. His perspective was that ‚Äúlife is tough‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôll always be that way.‚Äù Complete doomsday. This mentality and upbringing deeply impacted me, and I made a conscious & subconscious decision to take a different path because although I love my parents, I never wanted to struggle the way they had.\n\nBack in the 80‚Äôs ‚Äî yeahhh I‚Äôm an 80‚Äôs baby, what about it ü§™ the way to a better life was through education. So, I was the first person in my family to attend college and later pursued a master‚Äôs degree. I wanted a better life and was determined to break away from the cycle of struggle I witnessed. Because of this, education became my ticket to a brighter future and my journey into therapy and counseling psychology began.\n\nEmbracing Change and Risk\n\nMy journey was far from linear, though. I had various majors in undergrad because I couldn‚Äôt quite find my match‚Ä¶ who can relate?? Ultimately, I wanted a flexible, well-paying job that allowed me to be a mother while maintaining my independence. Eventually, I was introduced to a teacher who would later become my mentor and she opened my eyes to what seemed to offer that perfect blend.\n\nI‚Äôve always had a gift for making people feel safe and therefore, I was drawn to psychology and sociology. Not to be cliche but I have some fucked up issues of my own that made me want to understand human behavior and help others (like every other therapist ever). I‚Äôve said it once & I‚Äôll say it again: what we teach is generally what we need most. Through my education, I made bold decisions and embraced risks, sometimes impulsively && spoiler alert ‚Äî I still do these things to this day.. I‚Äôm just in a constant and relentless pursuit of happiness.\n\nChallenges of Entrepreneurship\n\nBecause I‚Äôm always willing to take risks and do things ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people wouldn‚Äôt, I‚Äôve faced some challenges. Entrepreneurship has been a rollercoaster of highs and lows, but my biggest challenge hasn‚Äôt been pricing, marketing, content creation, or any of the traditional stuff. It‚Äôs been dealing with the unacceptance and judgment of my decisions from others. My drive toward an ‚Äúunconventional life‚Äù has made people uncomfortable and, for a while, I wasn‚Äôt sure why.\n\nSo, maintaining relationships while constantly evolving has been a realllll struggle. My impulsive decisions and constant change have made some people distance themselves. This has been particularly challenging in friendships, where I‚Äôve faced rocky moments‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôm not gonna sit here and say I‚Äôm the best friend, but I am fiercely loyal to those I care about and I‚Äôll move mountains for them. I‚Äôm loyal to a fault sometimes.\n\nThis is where I hold back my tears‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had moments more recently where I‚Äôve had internal questions of ‚Äúwould certain relationships in my life be different if I would have just been regular‚Ä¶ normal‚Ä¶ the type of person that just keeps one job, who stays in one house, one city, one life, and just does the normal thing.‚Äù\n\n&& it‚Äôs not that the normal thing is bad becauseI have no opinions on that matter. But my way of being a risky person or even my choice to be vulnerable on social media has really triggered people.\n\nI try to put on a brave face. I try to act like ‚Äúit‚Äôs whatever, they don‚Äôt understand me, or they‚Äôre just jealous of me‚Äù and while I do think there are instances of that, I often wonder why I can‚Äôt just be content with the mundane.Sitting here today, though, I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. I am proud of the decisions I‚Äôve made to get where I am, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt hurt sometimes.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nAs I navigate the consequences of my choices (even though as I said, I regret nothing) I‚Äôm learning to find solace that not everyone will understand or support me. I‚Äôm finding peace in acknowledging my emotions and seeking comfort in self-compassion. I suppose I‚Äôm in a season of reflection and growth, but I‚Äôm committed to staying true to myself no matter how hard and uncomfortable it is to face these emotions coming to the surface.\n\nIf you resonate with my story or seek a supportive community, I encourage you to join my email list or step inside my all-inclusive membership. Remember, vulnerability and authenticity are powerful tools in building meaningful connections.\n\nRooting for you always & know I‚Äôm here for you if you‚Äôre also facing some weird, emotional stuff lately."
