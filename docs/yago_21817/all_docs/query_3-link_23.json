        "text": "Lorenzo! to recriminate is just.\n\nFondness for fame is avarice of air.\n\nI grant the man is vain who writes for praise.\n\nPraise no man e’er deserved, who sought no more.\n\nAs just thy second charge. I grant the Muse\n\nHas often blush’d at her degenerate sons,\n\nRetain’d by sense to plead her filthy cause;\n\nTo raise the low, to magnify the mean,\n\nAnd subtilize the gross into refined:\n\nAs if to magic numbers’ powerful charm 10\n\n’Twas given, to make a civet of their song\n\nObscene, and sweeten ordure to perfume.\n\nWit, a true Pagan, deifies the brute,\n\nAnd lifts our swine-enjoyments from the mire.\n\nThe fact notorious, nor obscure the cause.\n\nWe wear the chains of pleasure and of pride.\n\nThese share the man; and these distract him too;\n\nDraw different ways, and clash in their commands.\n\nPride, like an eagle, builds among the stars;\n\nBut pleasure, lark-like, nests upon the ground. 20\n\nJoys shared by brute creation, pride resents; 21\n\nPleasure embraces: man would both enjoy,\n\nAnd both at once: a point so hard, how gain!\n\nBut, what can’t wit, when stung by strong desire?\n\nWit dares attempt this arduous enterprise.\n\nSince joys of sense can’t rise to reason’s taste;\n\nIn subtle sophistry’s laborious forge,\n\nWit hammers out a reason new, that stoops\n\nTo sordid scenes, and meets them with applause.\n\nWit calls the graces the chaste zone to loose; 30\n\nNor less than a plump god to fill the bowl:\n\nA thousand phantoms, and a thousand spells,\n\nA thousand opiates scatters, to delude,\n\nTo fascinate, inebriate, lay asleep,\n\nAnd the fool’d mind delightfully confound.\n\nThus that which shock’d the judgment, shocks no more;\n\nThat which gave Pride offence, no more offends.\n\nPleasure and Pride, by nature mortal foes,\n\nAt war eternal, which in man shall reign,\n\nBy Wit’s address, patch up a fatal peace, 40\n\nAnd hand in hand lead on the rank debauch,\n\nFrom rank refined to delicate and gay.\n\nArt, cursed Art! wipes off th’ indebted blush\n\nFrom Nature’s cheek, and bronzes every shame.\n\nMan smiles in ruin, glories in his guilt,\n\nAnd infamy stands candidate for praise.\n\nAll writ by man in favour of the soul,\n\nThese sensual ethics far, in bulk, transcend.\n\nThe flowers of eloquence, profusely pour’d\n\nO’er spotted vice, fill half the letter’d world. 50\n\nCan powers of genius exorcise their page,\n\nAnd consecrate enormities with song?\n\nBut let not these inexpiable strains\n\nCondemn the Muse that knows her dignity;\n\nNor meanly stops at time, but holds the world 55\n\nAs ’tis, in nature’s ample field, a point,\n\nA point in her esteem; from whence to start,\n\nAnd run the round of universal space,\n\nTo visit being universal there,\n\nAnd being’s source, that utmost flight of mind!\n\nYet, spite of this so vast circumference,\n\nWell knows, but what is moral, nought is great. 62\n\nSing syrens only? Do not angels sing?\n\nThere is in Poesy a decent pride,\n\nWhich well becomes her when she speaks to Prose,\n\nHer younger sister; haply, not more wise.\n\nThink’st thou, Lorenzo! to find pastimes here?\n\nNo guilty passion blown into a flame,\n\nNo foible flatter’d, dignity disgraced,\n\nNo fairy field of fiction, all on flower, 70\n\nNo rainbow colours here, or silken tale:\n\nBut solemn counsels, images of awe,\n\nTruths, which eternity lets fall on man\n\nWith double weight, through these revolving spheres,\n\nThis death-deep silence, and incumbent shade:\n\nThoughts, such as shall revisit your last hour;\n\nVisit uncall’d, and live when life expires;\n\nAnd thy dark pencil, Midnight! darker still\n\nIn melancholy dipp’d, embrowns the whole.\n\nYet this, even this, my laughter-loving friends! 80\n\nLorenzo! and thy brothers of the smile!\n\nIf, what imports you most, can most engage,\n\nShall steal your ear, and chain you to my song.\n\nOr if you fail me, know, the wise shall taste\n\nThe truths I sing; the truths I sing shall feel;\n\nAnd, feeling, give assent; and their assent\n\nIs ample recompence; is more than praise.\n\nBut chiefly thine, O Lichfield! nor mistake;\n\nThink not unintroduced I force my way; 89\n\nNarcissa, not unknown, not unallied,\n\nBy virtue, or by blood, illustrious youth!\n\nTo thee, from blooming amaranthine bowers,\n\nWhere all the language harmony, descends\n\nUncall’d, and asks admittance for the Muse:\n\nA Muse that will not pain thee with thy praise;\n\nThy praise she drops, by nobler still inspired.\n\nO Thou! Blest Spirit! whether the supreme,\n\nGreat antemundane Father! in whose breast\n\nEmbryo creation, unborn being, dwelt,\n\nAnd all its various revolutions roll’d 100\n\nPresent, though future; prior to themselves;\n\nWhose breath can blow it into nought again;\n\nOr, from his throne some delegated power,\n\nWho, studious of our peace, dost turn the thought\n\nFrom vain and vile, to solid and sublime!\n\nUnseen thou lead’st me to delicious draughts\n\nOf inspiration, from a purer stream,\n\nAnd fuller of the god, than that which burst\n\nFrom famed Castalia: nor is yet allay’d\n\nMy sacred thirst; though long my soul has ranged 110\n\nThrough pleasing paths of moral, and divine,\n\nBy Thee sustain’d, and lighted by the stars.\n\nBy them best lighted are the paths of thought:\n\nNights are their days, their most illumined hours.\n\nBy day, the soul, o’erborne by life’s career,\n\nStunn’d by the din, and giddy with the glare,\n\nReels far from reason, jostled by the throng.\n\nBy day the soul is passive, all her thoughts\n\nImposed, precarious, broken ere mature.\n\nBy night, from objects free, from passion cool, 120\n\nThoughts uncontroll’d, and unimpress’d, the births\n\nOf pure election, arbitrary range,\n\nNot to the limits of one world confined; 123\n\nBut from ethereal travels light on earth,\n\nAs voyagers drop anchor, for repose.\n\nLet Indians, and the gay, like Indians, fond\n\nOf feather’d fopperies, the sun adore:\n\nDarkness has more divinity for me;\n\nIt strikes thought inward; it drives back the soul\n\nTo settle on herself, our point supreme! 130\n\nThere lies our theatre; there sits our judge.\n\nDarkness the curtain drops o’er life’s dull scene;\n\n’Tis the kind hand of Providence stretch’d out\n\n’Twixt man and vanity; ’tis reason’s reign,\n\nAnd virtue’s too; these tutelary shades\n\nAre man’s asylum from the tainted throng.\n\nNight is the good man’s friend, and guardian too;\n\nIt no less rescues virtue, than inspires.\n\nVirtue, for ever frail, as fair, below,\n\nHer tender nature suffers in the crowd, 140\n\nNor touches on the world, without a stain:\n\nThe world’s infectious; few bring back at eve.\n\nImmaculate, the manners of the morn.\n\nSomething we thought, is blotted; we resolved,\n\nIs shaken; we renounced, returns again.\n\nEach salutation may slide in a sin\n\nUnthought before, or fix a former flaw.\n\nNor is it strange: light, motion, concourse, noise,\n\nAll, scatter us abroad; thought outward-bound,\n\nNeglectful of our home affairs, flies off 150\n\nIn fume and dissipation, quits her charge,\n\nAnd leaves the breast unguarded to the foe.\n\nPresent example gets within our guard,\n\nAnd acts with double force, by few repell’d.\n\nAmbition fires ambition; love of gain\n\nStrikes, like a pestilence, from breast to breast;\n\nRiot, pride, perfidy, blue vapours breathe; 157\n\nAnd inhumanity is caught from man,\n\nFrom smiling man. A slight, a single glance,\n\nAnd shot at random, often has brought home\n\nA sudden fever, to the throbbing heart,\n\nOf envy, rancour, or impure desire.\n\nWe see, we hear, with peril; safety dwells 163\n\nRemote from multitude; the world’s a school\n\nOf wrong, and what proficients swarm around!\n\nWe must, or imitate, or disapprove;\n\nMust list as their accomplices, or foes;\n\nThat stains our innocence; this wounds our peace.\n\nFrom nature’s birth, hence, wisdom has been smit\n\nWith sweet recess, and languish’d for the shade. 170\n\nThis sacred shade, and solitude, what is it?\n\n’Tis the felt presence of the Deity.\n\nFew are the faults we flatter when alone.\n\nVice sinks in her allurements, is ungilt,\n\nAnd looks, like other objects, black by night.\n\nBy night an atheist half believes a God.\n\nNight is fair virtue’s immemorial friend;\n\nThe conscious moon, through every distant age,\n\nHas held a lamp to wisdom, and let fall,\n\nOn contemplation’s eye, her purging ray. 180\n\nThe famed Athenian,1717‘Athenian:’ Socrates. he who woo’d from heaven\n\nPhilosophy the fair, to dwell with men,\n\nAnd form their manners, not inflame their pride,\n\nWhile o’er his head, as fearful to molest\n\nHis labouring mind, the stars in silence slide,\n\nAnd seem all gazing on their future guest,\n\nSee him soliciting his ardent suit\n\nIn private audience: all the live-long night,\n\nRigid in thought, and motionless, he stands;\n\nNor quits his theme, or posture, till the sun 190\n\n(Rude drunkard rising rosy from the main!)\n\nDisturbs his nobler intellectual beam,\n\nAnd gives him to the tumult of the world.\n\nHail, precious moments! stolen from the black waste\n\nOf murder’d time! Auspicious midnight! hail!\n\nThe world excluded, every passion hush’d,\n\nAnd open’d a calm intercourse with Heaven,\n\nHere the soul sits in council; ponders past,\n\nPredestines future, action; sees, not feels,\n\nTumultuous life, and reasons with the storm; 200\n\nAll her lies answers, and thinks down her charms.\n\nWhat awful joy! what mental liberty!\n\nI am not pent in darkness; rather say\n\n(If not too bold) in darkness I’m embower’d.\n\nDelightful gloom! the clustering thoughts around\n\nSpontaneous rise, and blossom in the shade;\n\nBut droop by day, and sicken in the sun.\n\nThought borrows light elsewhere; from that first fire,\n\nFountain of animation! whence descends\n\nUrania, my celestial guest! who deigns 210\n\nNightly to visit me, so mean; and now,\n\nConscious how needful discipline to man,\n\nFrom pleasing dalliance with the charms of Night\n\nMy wandering thought recalls, to what excites\n\nFar other beat of heart! Narcissa’s tomb!\n\nOr is it feeble nature calls me back,\n\nAnd breaks my spirit into grief again?\n\nIs it a Stygian vapour in my blood?\n\nA cold, slow puddle, creeping through my veins?\n\nOr is it thus with all men?—Thus with all. 220\n\nWhat are we? how unequal! Now we soar,\n\nAnd now we sink; to be the same, transcends\n\nOur present prowess. Dearly pays the soul\n\nFor lodging ill; too dearly rents her clay. 224\n\nReason, a baffled counsellor! but adds\n\nThe blush of weakness to the bane of woe.\n\nThe noblest spirit fighting her hard fate,\n\nIn this damp, dusky region, charged with storms,\n\nBut feebly flutters, yet untaught to fly;\n\nOr, flying, short her flight, and sure her fall.\n\nOur utmost strength, when down, to rise again;\n\nAnd not to yield, though beaten, all our praise. 232\n\n’Tis vain to seek in men for more than man.\n\nThough proud in promise, big in previous thought,\n\nExperience damps our triumph. I, who late,\n\nEmerging from the shadows of the grave,\n\nWhere grief detain’d me prisoner, mounting high,\n\nThrew wide the gates of everlasting day,\n\nAnd call’d mankind to glory, shook off pain,\n\nMortality shook off, in ether pure, 240\n\nAnd struck the stars; now feel my spirits fail;\n\nThey drop me from the zenith; down I rush,\n\nLike him whom fable fledged1818‘Fable fledged:’ Icarus. with waxen wings,\n\nIn sorrow drown’d—but not in sorrow lost.\n\nHow wretched is the man who never mourn’d!\n\nI dive for precious pearl in sorrow’s stream:\n\nNot so the thoughtless man that only grieves;\n\nTakes all the torment, and rejects the gain;\n\n(Inestimable gain!) and gives Heaven leave\n\nTo make him but more wretched, not more wise. 250\n\nIf wisdom is our lesson (and what else\n\nEnnobles man? what else have angels learn’d?),\n\nGrief! more proficients in thy school are made,\n\nThan genius, or proud learning, e’er could boast.\n\nVoracious learning, often over-fed,\n\nDigests not into sense her motley meal.\n\nThis book-case, which dark booty almost burst, 257\n\nThis forager on others’ wisdom, leaves\n\nHer native farm, her reason, quite untill’d.\n\nWith mix’d manure she surfeits the rank soil,\n\nDung’d, but not dress’d; and rich to beggary.\n\nA pomp untameable of weeds prevails.\n\nHer servant’s wealth, encumber’d wisdom mourns. 263\n\nAnd what says Genius? “Let the dull be wise.”\n\nGenius, too hard for right, can prove it wrong;\n\nAnd loves to boast, where blush men less inspired.\n\nIt pleads exemption from the laws of sense;\n\nConsiders reason as a leveller;\n\nAnd scorns to share a blessing with the crowd.\n\nThat wise it could be, thinks an ample claim 270\n\nTo glory, and to pleasure gives the rest.\n\nCrassus but sleeps, Ardelio is undone.\n\nWisdom less shudders at a fool, than wit.\n\nBut Wisdom smiles, when humbled mortals weep.\n\nWhen sorrow wounds the breast, as ploughs the glebe,1919‘Glebe:’ The soil or earth; land. (Archaic.)—ee\n\nAnd hearts obdurate feel her softening shower;\n\nHer seed celestial, then, glad wisdom sows;\n\nHer golden harvest triumphs in the soil.\n\nIf so, Narcissa2020‘Narcissa:’ Elizabeth Lee, Dr. Young’s step-daughter.—ee, welcome my Relapse;\n\nI’ll raise a tax on my calamity, 280\n\nAnd reap rich compensation from my pain.\n\nI’ll range the plenteous intellectual field;\n\nAnd gather every thought of sovereign power\n\nTo chase the moral maladies of man;\n\nThoughts, which may bear transplanting to the skies,\n\nThough natives of this coarse penurious soil;\n\nNor wholly wither there, where seraphs sing,\n\nRefined, exalted, not annull’d, in heaven.\n\nReason, the sun that gives them birth, the same\n\nIn either clime, though more illustrious there. 290\n\nThese choicely cull’d, and elegantly ranged, 291\n\nShall form a garland for Narcissa’s tomb;\n\nAnd, peradventure, of no fading flowers.\n\nSay on what themes shall puzzled choice descend?\n\n“Th’ importance of contemplating the tomb;\n\nWhy men decline it; suicide’s foul birth;\n\nThe various kind of grief; the faults of age;\n\nAnd Death’s dread character—invite my song.”\n\nAnd, first th’ importance of our end survey’d.\n\nFriends counsel quick dismission of our grief: 300\n\nMistaken kindness! our hearts heal too soon.\n\nAre they more kind than He, who struck the blow?\n\nWho bid it do his errand in our hearts,\n\nAnd banish peace, till nobler guests arrive,\n\nAnd bring it back, a true and endless peace?\n\nCalamities are friends: as glaring day\n\nOf these unnumber’d lustres robs our sight;\n\nProsperity puts out unnumber’d thoughts\n\nOf import high, and light divine, to man.\n\nThe man how blest, who, sick of gaudy scenes, 310\n\n(Scenes apt to thrust between us and ourselves!)\n\nIs led by choice to take his favourite walk,\n\nBeneath death’s gloomy, silent, cypress shades,\n\nUnpierced by vanity’s fantastic ray;\n\nTo read his monuments, to weigh his dust,\n\nVisit his vaults, and dwell among the tombs!\n\nLorenzo2121‘Lorenzo’ was modelled on Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton (b. 21 December 1698; d. Poblet, Spain, 31 May 1731, aged 32), powerful Jacobite politician, notorious libertine and rake, profligate, and alcoholic.—ee read with me Narcissa’s stone;\n\n(Narcissa was thy favourite) let us read\n\nHer moral stone; few doctors preach so well;\n\nFew orators so tenderly can touch 320\n\nThe feeling heart. What pathos in the date!\n\nApt words can strike: and yet in them we see\n\nFaint images of what we here enjoy.\n\nWhat cause have we to build on length of life?\n\nTemptations seize, when fear is laid asleep; 325\n\nAnd ill foreboded is our strongest guard.\n\nSee from her tomb, as from an humble shrine,\n\nTruth, radiant goddess! sallies on my soul,\n\nAnd puts delusion’s dusky train to flight;\n\nDispels the mists our sultry passions raise,\n\nFrom objects low, terrestrial, and obscene;\n\nAnd shows the real estimate of things; 332\n\nWhich no man, unafflicted, ever saw;\n\nPulls off the veil from virtue’s rising charms;\n\nDetects temptation in a thousand lies.\n\nTruth bids me look on men, as autumn leaves,\n\nAnd all they bleed for, as the summer’s dust,\n\nDriven by the whirlwind: lighted by her beams,\n\nI widen my horizon, gain new powers,\n\nSee things invisible, feel things remote, 340\n\nAm present with futurities; think nought\n\nTo man so foreign, as the joys possess’d;\n\nNought so much his, as those beyond the grave.\n\nNo folly keeps its colour in her sight;\n\nPale worldly wisdom loses all her charms;\n\nIn pompous promise, from her schemes profound,\n\nIf future fate she plans, ’tis all in leaves,\n\nLike Sibyl, unsubstantial, fleeting bliss!\n\nAt the first blast it vanishes in air.\n\nNot so, celestial: would’st thou know, Lorenzo! 350\n\nHow differ worldly wisdom, and divine?\n\nJust as the waning and the waxing moon.\n\nMore empty worldly wisdom every day;\n\nAnd every day more fair her rival shines.\n\nWhen later, there’s less time to play the fool.\n\nSoon our whole term for wisdom is expired\n\n(Thou know’st she calls no council in the grave):\n\nAnd everlasting fool is writ in fire, 358\n\nOr real wisdom wafts us to the skies.\n\nAs worldly schemes resemble Sibyl’s leaves,\n\nThe good man’s days to Sibyl’s books compare,\n\n(In ancient story read, thou know’st the tale),\n\nIn price still rising, as in number less,\n\nInestimable quite his final hour. 364\n\nFor that who thrones can offer, offer thrones;\n\nInsolvent worlds the purchase cannot pay.\n\n“O let me die his death!” all nature cries.\n\n“Then live his life”—all nature falters there;\n\nOur great physician daily to consult,\n\nTo commune with the grave, our only cure. 370\n\nWhat grave prescribes the best?—A friend’s; and yet,\n\nFrom a friend’s grave, how soon we disengage!\n\nEven to the dearest, as his marble, cold.\n\nWhy are friends ravish’d from us? ’Tis to bind,\n\nBy soft affection’s ties, on human hearts,\n\nThe thought of death, which reason, too supine,\n\nOr misemploy’d, so rarely fastens there.\n\nNor reason, nor affection, no, nor both\n\nCombined, can break the witchcrafts of the world.\n\nBehold, th’ inexorable hour at hand! 380\n\nBehold, th’ inexorable hour forgot!\n\nAnd to forget it, the chief aim of life,\n\nThough well to ponder it, is life’s chief end.\n\nIs Death, that ever threatening, ne’er remote,\n\nThat all-important, and that only sure\n\n(Come when he will), an unexpected guest?\n\nNay, though invited by the loudest calls\n\nOf blind imprudence, unexpected still;\n\nThough numerous messengers are sent before,\n\nTo warn his great arrival. What the cause, 390\n\nThe wondrous cause, of this mysterious ill? 391\n\nAll heaven looks down astonish’d at the sight.\n\nIs it, that life has sown her joys so thick,\n\nWe can’t thrust in a single care between?\n\nIs it, that life has such a swarm of cares,\n\nThe thought of death can’t enter for the throng?\n\nIs it, that time steals on with downy feet,\n\nNor wakes indulgence from her golden dream?\n\nTo-day is so like yesterday, it cheats;\n\nWe take the lying sister for the same. 400\n\nLife glides away, Lorenzo, like a brook;\n\nFor ever changing, unperceived the change.\n\nIn the same brook none ever bathed him twice:\n\nTo the same life none ever twice awoke.\n\nWe call the brook the same; the same we think\n\nOur life, though still more rapid in its flow;\n\nNor mark the much, irrevocably lapsed,\n\nAnd mingled with the sea. Or shall we say\n\n(Retaining still the brook to bear us on)\n\nThat life is like a vessel on the stream? 410\n\nIn life embark’d, we smoothly down the tide\n\nOf time descend, but not on time intent;\n\nAmused, unconscious of the gliding wave;\n\nTill on a sudden we perceive a shock;\n\nWe start, awake, look out; what see we there?\n\nOur brittle bark is burst on Charon’s shore.\n\nIs this the cause death flies all human thought?\n\nOr is it judgment, by the will struck blind,\n\nThat domineering mistress of the soul!\n\nLike him so strong, by Dalilah the fair? 420\n\nOr is it fear turns startled reason back,\n\nFrom looking down a precipice so steep?\n\n’Tis dreadful; and the dread is wisely placed,\n\nBy nature, conscious of the make of man.\n\nA dreadful friend it is, a terror kind, 425\n\nA flaming sword to guard the tree of life.\n\nBy that unawed, in life’s most smiling hour,\n\nThe good man would repine; would suffer joys,\n\nAnd burn impatient for his promised skies.\n\nThe bad, on each punctilious pique of pride,\n\nOr gloom of humour, would give rage the rein;\n\nBound o’er the barrier, rush into the dark, 432\n\nAnd mar the schemes of Providence below.\n\nWhat groan was that, Lorenzo?—Furies! rise,\n\nAnd drown in your less execrable yell\n\nBritannia’s shame. There took her gloomy flight,\n\nOn wing impetuous, a black sullen soul,\n\nBlasted from hell, with horrid lust of death;\n\nThy friend, the brave, the gallant Altamont,\n\nSo call’d, so thought—and then he fled the field. 440\n\nLess base the fear of death, than fear of life.\n\nO Britain, infamous for suicide!\n\nAn island in thy manners! far disjoin’d\n\nFrom the whole world of rationals beside!\n\nIn ambient waves plunge thy polluted head,\n\nWash the dire stain, nor shock the Continent.\n\nBut thou be shock’d, while I detect the cause\n\nOf self-assault, expose the monster’s birth,\n\nAnd bid abhorrence hiss it round the world.\n\nBlame not thy clime, nor chide the distant sun; 450\n\nThe sun is innocent, thy clime absolved:\n\nImmoral climes kind nature never made.\n\nThe cause I sing, in Eden might prevail,\n\nAnd proves, it is thy folly, not thy fate.\n\nThe soul of man (let man in homage bow,\n\nWho names his soul), a native of the skies!\n\nHigh-born, and free, her freedom should maintain,\n\nUnsold, unmortgaged for earth’s little bribes.\n\nTh’ illustrious stranger, in this foreign land, 459\n\nLike strangers, jealous of her dignity,\n\nStudious of home, and ardent to return,\n\nOf earth suspicious, earth’s enchanted cup\n\nWith cool reserve light touching, should indulge\n\nOn immortality her godlike taste;\n\nThere take large draughts, make her chief banquet there.\n\nBut some reject this sustenance divine;\n\nTo beggarly vile appetites descend;\n\nAsk alms of earth, for guests that came from heaven!\n\nSink into slaves; and sell, for present hire,\n\nTheir rich reversion, and (what shares its fate) 470\n\nTheir native freedom, to the prince who sways\n\nThis nether world. And when his payments fail,\n\nWhen his foul basket gorges them no more,\n\nOr their pall’d palates loathe the basket full;\n\nAre instantly, with wild demoniac rage,\n\nFor breaking all the chains of Providence,\n\nAnd bursting their confinement; though fast barr’d\n\nBy laws divine and human; guarded strong\n\nWith horrors doubled to defend the pass,\n\nThe blackest, nature, or dire guilt, can raise; 480\n\nAnd moated round with fathomless destruction,\n\nSure to receive, and whelm them in their fall.\n\nSuch, Britons! is the cause, to you unknown,\n\nOr worse, o’erlook’d; o’erlook’d by magistrates,\n\nThus criminals themselves. I grant the deed\n\nIs madness, but the madness of the heart.\n\nAnd what is that? Our utmost bound of guilt.\n\nA sensual, unreflecting life, is big\n\nWith monstrous births, and suicide, to crown\n\nThe black infernal brood. The bold to break 490\n\nHeaven’s law supreme, and desperately rush,\n\nThrough sacred Nature’s murder, on their own,\n\nBecause they never think of death, they die. 493\n\n’Tis equally man’s duty, glory, gain,\n\nAt once to shun, and meditate, his end.\n\nWhen by the bed of languishment we sit\n\n(The seat of wisdom! if our choice, not fate),\n\nOr, o’er our dying friends, in anguish hang,\n\nWipe the cold dew, or stay the sinking head,\n\nNumber their moments, and, in every clock, 500\n\nStart at the voice of an eternity;\n\nSee the dim lamp of life just feebly lift\n\nAn agonizing beam, at us to gaze,\n\nThen sink again, and quiver into death,\n\nThat most pathetic herald of our own;\n\nHow read we such sad scenes? As sent to man\n\nIn perfect vengeance? No; in pity sent,\n\nTo melt him down, like wax, and then impress,\n\nIndelible, Death’s image on his heart;\n\nBleeding for others, trembling for himself. 510\n\nWe bleed, we tremble, we forget, we smile.\n\nThe mind turns fool, before the cheek is dry.\n\nOur quick-returning folly cancels all;\n\nAs the tide rushing razes what is writ\n\nIn yielding sands, and smooths the letter’d shore.\n\nLorenzo! hast thou ever weigh’d a sigh?\n\nOr studied the philosophy of tears?\n\n(A science, yet unlectured in our schools!)\n\nHast thou descended deep into the breast,\n\nAnd seen their source? If not, descend with me, 520\n\nAnd trace these briny rivulets to their springs.\n\nOur funeral tears from different causes rise,\n\nAs if from separate cisterns in the soul,\n\nOf various kinds, they flow. From tender hearts,\n\nBy soft contagion call’d, some burst at once,\n\nAnd stream obsequious to the leading eye.\n\nSome ask more time, by curious art distill’d. 527\n\nSome hearts, in secret hard, unapt to melt,\n\nStruck by the magic of the public eye,\n\nLike Moses’ smitten rock, gush out amain.\n\nSome weep to share the fame of the deceased,\n\nSo high in merit, and to them so dear.\n\nThey dwell on praises, which they think they share; 533\n\nAnd thus, without a blush, commend themselves.\n\nSome mourn, in proof that something they could love:\n\nThey weep not to relieve their grief, but show.\n\nSome weep in perfect justice to the dead,\n\nAs conscious all their love is in arrear.\n\nSome mischievously weep, not unapprised\n\nTears, sometimes, aid the conquest of an eye. 540\n\nWith what address the soft Ephesians draw\n\nTheir sable network o’er entangled hearts!\n\nAs seen through crystal, how their roses glow,\n\nWhile liquid pearl runs trickling down their cheek!\n\nOf hers not prouder Egypt’s wanton queen,\n\nCarousing gems, herself dissolved in love.\n\nSome weep at death, abstracted from the dead,\n\nAnd celebrate, like Charles,2222‘Charles:’ Charles V. their own decease.\n\nBy kind construction some are deem’d to weep,\n\nBecause a decent veil conceals their joy. 550\n\nSome weep in earnest, and yet weep in vain;\n\nAs deep in indiscretion, as in woe.\n\nPassion, blind Passion! impotently pours\n\nTears, that deserve more tears; while Reason sleeps;\n\nOr gazes like an idiot, unconcern’d;\n\nNor comprehends the meaning of the storm;\n\nKnows not it speaks to her, and her alone.\n\nIrrationals all sorrow are beneath,\n\nThat noble gift! that privilege of man!\n\nFrom sorrow’s pang, the birth of endless joy. 560\n\nBut these are barren of that birth divine:\n\nThey weep impetuous, as the summer storm,\n\nAnd full as short! The cruel grief soon tamed,\n\nThey make a pastime of the stingless tale;\n\nFar as the deep resounding knell, they spread\n\nThe dreadful news, and hardly feel it more.\n\nNo grain of wisdom pays them for their woe.\n\nHalf-round the globe, the tears pump’d up by Death\n\nAre spent in watering vanities of life;\n\nIn making folly flourish still more fair, 570\n\nWhen the sick soul, her wonted stay withdrawn,\n\nReclines on earth, and sorrows in the dust;\n\nInstead of learning, there, her true support,\n\nThough there thrown down her true support to learn.\n\nWithout Heaven’s aid, impatient to be bless’d,\n\nShe crawls to the next shrub, or bramble vile,\n\nThough from the stately cedar’s arms she fell;\n\nWith stale, forsworn embraces, clings anew,\n\nThe stranger weds, and blossoms, as before,\n\nIn all the fruitless fopperies of life: 580\n\nPresents her weed, well-fancied, at the ball,\n\nAnd raffles for the Death’s-head on the ring.\n\nSo wept Aurelia, till the destined youth\n\nStepp’d in, with his receipt for making smiles,\n\nAnd blanching sables into bridal bloom.\n\nSo wept Lorenzo fair Clarissa’s fate;\n\nWho gave that angel boy, on whom he doats;\n\nAnd died to give him, orphan’d in his birth!\n\nNot such, Narcissa, my distress for thee.\n\nI’ll make an altar of thy sacred tomb, 590\n\nTo sacrifice to wisdom.—What wast thou?\n\n“Young, gay, and fortunate!” Each yields a theme.\n\nI’ll dwell on each, to shun thought more severe;\n\n(Heaven knows I labour with severer still!) 594\n\nI’ll dwell on each, and quite exhaust thy death.\n\nA soul without reflection, like a pile\n\nWithout inhabitant, to ruin runs.\n\nAnd, first, thy youth. What says it to grey hairs?\n\nNarcissa, I’m become thy pupil now—\n\nEarly, bright, transient, chaste, as morning dew,\n\nShe sparkled, was exhaled, and went to heaven.\n\nTime on this head has snow’d; yet still ’tis borne 602\n\nAloft; nor thinks but on another’s grave.\n\nCover’d with shame I speak it, age severe\n\nOld worn-out vice sets down for virtue fair;\n\nWith graceless gravity, chastising youth,\n\nThat youth chastised surpassing in a fault,\n\nFather of all, forgetfulness of death:\n\nAs if, like objects pressing on the sight,\n\nDeath had advanced too near us to be seen: 610\n\nOr, that life’s loan Time ripen’d into right;\n\nAnd men might plead prescription from the grave;\n\nDeathless, from repetition of reprieve.\n\nDeathless? far from it! such are dead already;\n\nTheir hearts are buried, and the world their grave.\n\nTell me, some god! my guardian angel! tell,\n\nWhat thus infatuates? what enchantment plants\n\nThe phantom of an age ’twixt us, and Death\n\nAlready at the door? He knocks, we hear,\n\nAnd yet we will not hear. What mail defends 620\n\nOur untouch’d hearts? what miracle turns off\n\nThe pointed thought, which from a thousand quivers\n\nIs daily darted, and is daily shunn’d?\n\nWe stand, as in a battle, throngs on throngs\n\nAround us falling; wounded oft ourselves;\n\nThough bleeding with our wounds, immortal still!\n\nWe see Time’s furrows on another’s brow,\n\nAnd Death intrench’d, preparing his assault; 628\n\nHow few themselves, in that just mirror, see,\n\nOr, seeing, draw their inference as strong!\n\nThere, death is certain; doubtful here: he must,\n\nAnd soon; we may, within an age, expire.\n\nThough grey our heads, our thoughts and aims are green;\n\nLike damaged clocks, whose hand and bell dissent;\n\nFolly sings six, while Nature points at twelve.\n\nAbsurd longevity! More, more! it cries:\n\nMore life, more wealth, more trash of every kind.\n\nAnd wherefore mad for more, when relish fails?\n\nObject, and appetite, must club for joy;\n\nShall Folly labour hard to mend the bow, 640\n\nBaubles, I mean, that strike us from without,\n\nWhile Nature is relaxing every string?\n\nAsk thought for joy; grow rich, and hoard within.\n\nThink you the soul, when this life’s rattles cease,\n\nHas nothing of more manly to succeed?\n\nContract the taste immortal; learn even now\n\nTo relish what alone subsists hereafter.\n\nDivine, or none, henceforth your joys for ever.\n\nOf age the glory is, to wish to die.\n\nThat wish is praise, and promise; it applauds 650\n\nPast life, and promises our future bliss.\n\nWhat weakness see not children in their sires?\n\nGrand-climacterical absurdities!\n\nGrey-hair’d authority, to faults of youth,\n\nHow shocking! it makes folly thrice a fool;\n\nAnd our first childhood might our last despise.\n\nPeace and esteem is all that age can hope.\n\nNothing but wisdom gives the first; the last,\n\nNothing, but the repute of being wise.\n\nFolly bars both; our age is quite undone. 660\n\nWhat folly can be ranker? Like our shadows,\n\nOur wishes lengthen, as our sun declines. 662\n\nNo wish should loiter, then, this side the grave.\n\nOur hearts should leave the world, before the knell\n\nCalls for our carcases to mend the soil.\n\nEnough to live in tempest, die in port;\n\nAge should fly concourse, cover in retreat\n\nDefects of judgment; and the will subdue;\n\nWalk thoughtful on the silent, solemn shore\n\nOf that vast ocean it must sail so soon; 670\n\nAnd put good works on board; and wait the wind\n\nThat shortly blows us into worlds unknown:\n\nIf unconsider’d too, a dreadful scene!\n\nAll should be prophets to themselves; foresee\n\nTheir future fate; their future fate foretaste;\n\nThis art would waste the bitterness of death.\n\nThe thought of death alone, the fear destroys.\n\nA disaffection to that precious thought\n\nIs more than midnight darkness on the soul,\n\nWhich sleeps beneath it, on a precipice, 680\n\nPuff’d off by the first blast, and lost for ever.\n\nDost ask, Lorenzo, why so warmly press’d,\n\nBy repetition hammer’d on thine ear,\n\nThe thought of death? That thought is the machine,\n\nThe grand machine, that heaves us from the dust,\n\nAnd rears us into men. That thought, plied home,\n\nWill soon reduce the ghastly precipice\n\nO’er-hanging hell, will soften the descent,\n\nAnd gently slope our passage to the grave;\n\nHow warmly to be wish’d! What heart of flesh 690\n\nWould trifle with tremendous? dare extremes?\n\nYawn o’er the fate of infinite? What hand,\n\nBeyond the blackest brand of censure bold,\n\n(To speak a language too well known to thee),\n\nWould at a moment give its all to chance, 695\n\nAnd stamp the die for an eternity?\n\nAid me, Narcissa! aid me to keep pace\n\nWith Destiny; and ere her scissors cut\n\nMy thread of life, to break this tougher thread\n\nOf moral death, that ties me to the world.\n\nSting thou my slumbering reason to send forth\n\nA thought of observation on the foe; 702\n\nTo sally; and survey the rapid march\n\nOf his ten thousand messengers to man;\n\nWho, Jehu-like, behind him turns them all.\n\nAll accident apart, by Nature sign’d,\n\nMy warrant is gone out, though dormant yet;\n\nPerhaps behind one moment lurks my fate.\n\nMust I then forward only look for Death?\n\nBackward I turn mine eye, and find him there. 710\n\nMan is a self-survivor every year.\n\nMan, like a stream, is in perpetual flow.\n\nDeath’s a destroyer of quotidian2323‘Quotidian:’ everyday; commonplace.—ee prey.\n\nMy youth, my noontide, his; my yesterday;\n\nThe bold invader shares the present hour.\n\nEach moment on the former shuts the grave.\n\nWhile man is growing, life is in decrease;\n\nAnd cradles rock us nearer to the tomb.\n\nOur birth is nothing but our death begun;\n\nAs tapers waste, that instant they take fire. 720\n\nShall we then fear, lest that should come to pass,\n\nWhich comes to pass each moment of our lives?\n\nIf fear we must, let that Death turn us pale,\n\nWhich murders strength and ardour; what remains\n\nShould rather call on Death, than dread his call.\n\nYe partners of my fault, and my decline!\n\nThoughtless of death, but when your neighbour’s knell\n\n(Rude visitant!) knocks hard at your dull sense,\n\nAnd with its thunder scarce obtains your ear! 729\n\nBe death your theme, in every place and hour;\n\nNor longer want, ye monumental sires!\n\nA brother tomb to tell you ye shall die.\n\nThat death you dread (so great is Nature’s skill)\n\nKnow, you shall court before you shall enjoy.\n\nBut you are learn’d; in volumes deep, you sit;\n\nIn wisdom, shallow: pompous ignorance!\n\nWould you be still more learned than the learn’d?\n\nLearn well to know how much need not be known,\n\nAnd what that knowledge, which impairs your sense.\n\nOur needful knowledge, like our needful food, 740\n\nUnhedged, lies open in life’s common field;\n\nAnd bids all welcome to the vital feast.\n\nYou scorn what lies before you in the page\n\nOf Nature, and Experience, moral truth;\n\nOf indispensable, eternal fruit;\n\nFruit, on which mortals feeding, turn to gods:\n\nAnd dive in science for distinguish’d names,\n\nDishonest fomentation of your pride!\n\nSinking in virtue, as you rise in fame.\n\nYour learning, like the lunar beam, affords 750\n\nLight, but not heat; it leaves you indevout,\n\nFrozen at heart, while speculation shines.\n\nAwake, ye curious indagators! fond\n\nOf knowing all, but what avails you known.\n\nIf you would learn Death’s character, attend.\n\nAll casts of conduct, all degrees of health,\n\nAll dies of fortune, and all dates of age,\n\nTogether shook in his impartial urn,\n\nCome forth at random: or, if choice is made,\n\nThe choice is quite sarcastic, and insults 760\n\nAll bold conjecture, and fond hopes of man.\n\nWhat countless multitudes not only leave,\n\nBut deeply disappoint us, by their deaths! 763\n\nThough great our sorrow, greater our surprise.\n\nLike other tyrants, Death delights to smite,\n\nWhat, smitten, most proclaims the pride of power,\n\nAnd arbitrary nod. His joy supreme,\n\nTo bid the wretch survive the fortunate;\n\nThe feeble wrap th’ athletic in his shroud;\n\nAnd weeping fathers build their children’s tomb: 770\n\nMe thine, Narcissa!—What though short thy date?\n\nVirtue, not rolling suns, the mind matures.\n\nThat life is long, which answers life’s great end.\n\nThe time that bears no fruit, deserves no name;\n\nThe man of wisdom is the man of years.\n\nIn hoary youth Methusalems may die;\n\nO how misdated on their flattering tombs!\n\nNarcissa’s youth has lectured me thus far.\n\nAnd can her gaiety give counsel too?\n\nThat, like the Jews’ famed oracle of gems,2424‘Oracle of gems:’ the Urim and Thummim. 780\n\nSparkles instruction; such as throws new light,\n\nAnd opens more the character of Death;\n\nIll known to thee, Lorenzo! This thy vaunt:\n\n“Give Death his due, the wretched, and the old;\n\nEven let him sweep his rubbish to the grave;\n\nLet him not violate kind Nature’s laws,\n\nBut own man born to live as well as die.”\n\nWretched and old thou givest him; young and gay\n\nHe takes; and plunder is a tyrant’s joy.\n\nWhat if I prove, “The farthest from the fear, 790\n\nAre often nearest to the stroke of Fate?”\n\nAll, more than common, menaces an end.\n\nA blaze betokens brevity of life:\n\nAs if bright embers should emit a flame,\n\nGlad spirits sparkled from Narcissa’s eye,\n\nAnd made youth younger, and taught life to live, 796\n\nAs Nature’s opposites wage endless war,\n\nFor this offence, as treason to the deep\n\nInviolable stupor of his reign,\n\nWhere Lust, and turbulent Ambition, sleep,\n\nDeath took swift vengeance. As he life detests,\n\nMore life is still more odious; and, reduced\n\nBy conquest, aggrandizes more his power. 803\n\nBut wherefore aggrandized? By Heaven’s decree,\n\nTo plant the soul on her eternal guard,\n\nIn awful expectation of our end.\n\nThus runs Death’s dread commission: “Strike, but so\n\nAs most alarms the living by the dead.”\n\nHence stratagem delights him, and surprise,\n\nAnd cruel sport with man’s securities. 810\n\nNot simple conquest, triumph is his aim;\n\nAnd, where least fear’d, there conquest triumphs most.\n\nThis proves my bold assertion not too bold.\n\nWhat are his arts to lay our fears asleep?\n\nTiberian arts his purposes wrap up\n\nIn deep dissimulation’s darkest night.\n\nLike princes unconfess’d in foreign courts,\n\nWho travel under cover, Death assumes\n\nThe name and look of life, and dwells among us.\n\nHe takes all shapes that serve his black designs: 820\n\nThough master of a wider empire far\n\nThan that o’er which the Roman eagle flew.\n\nLike Nero, he’s a fiddler, charioteer,\n\nOr drives his phaeton, in female guise;\n\nQuite unsuspected, till, the wheel beneath,\n\nHis disarray’d oblation he devours.\n\nHe most affects the forms least like himself,\n\nHis slender self. Hence burly corpulence\n\nIs his familiar wear, and sleek disguise.\n\nBehind the rosy bloom he loves to lurk, 830\n\nOr ambush in a smile; or wanton dive\n\nIn dimples deep; love’s eddies, which draw in\n\nUnwary hearts, and sink them in despair.\n\nSuch, on Narcissa’s couch he loiter’d long\n\nUnknown; and, when detected, still was seen\n\nTo smile; such peace has innocence in death!\n\nMost happy they! whom least his arts deceive.\n\nOne eye on Death, and one full fix’d on heaven,\n\nBecomes a mortal, and immortal man.\n\nLong on his wiles a piqued and jealous spy, 840\n\nI’ve seen, or dreamt I saw, the tyrant dress;\n\nLay by his horrors, and put on his smiles.\n\nSay, Muse, for thou remember’st, call it back,\n\nAnd show Lorenzo the surprising scene;\n\nIf ’twas a dream, his genius can explain.\n\n’Twas in a circle of the gay I stood.\n\nDeath would have enter’d; Nature push’d him back;\n\nSupported by a doctor of renown,\n\nHis point he gain’d. Then artfully dismiss’d\n\nThe sage; for Death design’d to be conceal’d. 850\n\nHe gave an old vivacious usurer\n\nHis meagre aspect, and his naked bones;\n\nIn gratitude for plumping up his prey,\n\nA pamper’d spendthrift; whose fantastic air,\n\nWell-fashion’d figure, and cockaded2525‘Cockade:’ an ornament, such as a rosette or knot of ribbon, usually worn on the hat as a badge.—ee brow,\n\nHe took in change, and underneath the pride\n\nOf costly linen, tuck’d his filthy shroud.\n\nHis crooked bow he straighten’d to a cane;\n\nAnd hid his deadly shafts in Myra’s eye.\n\nThe dreadful masquerader, thus equipp’d, 860\n\nOut sallies on adventures. Ask you where?\n\nWhere is he not? For his peculiar haunts,\n\nLet this suffice; sure as night follows day,\n\nDeath treads in pleasure’s footsteps round the world, 864\n\nWhen pleasure treads the paths, which reason shuns.\n\nWhen, against reason, riot shuts the door,\n\nAnd gaiety supplies the place of sense,\n\nThen, foremost at the banquet, and the ball,\n\nDeath leads the dance, or stamps the deadly die;\n\nNor ever fails the midnight bowl to crown. 870\n\nGaily carousing to his gay compeers,\n\nInly he laughs, to see them laugh at him,\n\nAs absent far: and when the revel burns,\n\nWhen fear is banish’d, and triumphant thought,\n\nCalling for all the joys beneath the moon,\n\nAgainst him turns the key; and bids him sup\n\nWith their progenitors—He drops his mask;\n\nFrowns out at full; they start, despair, expire.\n\nScarce with more sudden terror and surprise,\n\nFrom his black mask of nitre, touch’d by fire, 880\n\nHe bursts, expands, roars, blazes, and devours.\n\nAnd is not this triumphant treachery,\n\nAnd more than simple conquest, in the fiend?\n\nAnd now, Lorenzo, dost thou wrap thy soul\n\nIn soft security, because unknown\n\nWhich moment is commission’d to destroy?\n\nIn death’s uncertainty thy danger lies.\n\nIs death uncertain? Therefore thou be fix’d;\n\nFix’d as a sentinel, all eye, all ear,\n\nAll expectation of the coming foe. 890\n\nRouse, stand in arms, nor lean against thy spear;\n\nLest slumber steal one moment o’er thy soul,\n\nAnd Fate surprise thee nodding. Watch, be strong:\n\nThus give each day the merit, and renown,\n\nOf dying well; though doom’d but once to die.\n\nNor let life’s period hidden (as from most)\n\nHide too from thee the precious use of life.\n\nEarly, not sudden, was Narcissa’s fate. 898\n\nSoon, not surprising, Death his visit paid.\n\nHer thought went forth to meet him on his way,\n\nNor gaiety forgot it was to die:\n\nThough Fortune too (our third and final theme),\n\nAs an accomplice, play’d her gaudy plumes,\n\nAnd every glittering gewgaw, on her sight, 904\n\nTo dazzle, and debauch it from its mark.\n\nDeath’s dreadful advent is the mark of man;\n\nAnd every thought that misses it, is blind.\n\nFortune, with youth and gaiety, conspired\n\nTo weave a triple wreath of happiness\n\n(If happiness on earth) to crown her brow. 910\n\nAnd could Death charge through such a shining shield?\n\nThat shining shield invites the tyrant’s spear.\n\nAs if to damp our elevated aims,\n\nAnd strongly preach humility to man.\n\nO how portentous is prosperity!\n\nHow, comet-like, it threatens, while it shines!\n\nFew years but yield us proof of Death’s ambition,\n\nTo cull his victims from the fairest fold,\n\nAnd sheath his shafts in all the pride of life.\n\nWhen flooded with abundance, purpled o’er 920\n\nWith recent honours, bloom’d with every bliss,\n\nSet up in ostentation, made the gaze,\n\nThe gaudy centre, of the public eye,\n\nWhen Fortune thus has toss’d her child in air,\n\nSnatch’d from the covert of an humble state,\n\nHow often have I seen him dropp’d at once,\n\nOur morning’s envy! and our evening’s sigh!\n\nAs if her bounties were the signal given,\n\nThe flowery wreath to mark the sacrifice,\n\nAnd call Death’s arrows on the destined prey. 930\n\nHigh Fortune seems in cruel league with Fate.\n\nAsk you for what? To give his war on man 932\n\nThe deeper dread, and more illustrious spoil;\n\nThus to keep daring mortals more in awe.\n\nAnd burns Lorenzo still for the sublime\n\nOf life? to hang his airy nest on high,\n\nOn the slight timber of the topmost bough,\n\nRock’d at each breeze, and menacing a fall?\n\nGranting grim Death at equal distance there;\n\nYet peace begins just where ambition ends. 940\n\nWhat makes man wretched? Happiness denied?\n\nLorenzo! no: ’tis happiness disdain’d.\n\nShe comes too meanly dress’d to win our smile;\n\nAnd calls herself Content, a homely name!\n\nOur flame is transport, and Content our scorn.\n\nAmbition turns, and shuts the door against her,\n\nAnd weds a toil, a tempest, in her stead;\n\nA tempest to warm transport near of kin.\n\nUnknowing what our mortal state admits,\n\nLife’s modest joys we ruin, while we raise; 950\n\nAnd all our ecstasies are wounds to peace;\n\nPeace, the full portion of mankind below.\n\nAnd since thy peace is dear, ambitious youth!\n\nOf fortune fond! as thoughtless of thy fate!\n\nAs late I drew Death’s picture, to stir up\n\nThy wholesome fears; now, drawn in contrast, see\n\nGay Fortune’s, thy vain hopes to reprimand.\n\nSee, high in air, the sportive goddess hangs,\n\nUnlocks her casket, spreads her glittering ware,\n\nAnd calls the giddy winds to puff abroad 960\n\nHer random bounties o’er the gaping throng.\n\nAll rush rapacious; friends o’er trodden friends;\n\nSons o’er their fathers, subjects o’er their kings,\n\nPriests o’er their gods, and lovers o’er the fair\n\n(Still more adored), to snatch the golden shower.\n\nGold glitters most, where virtue shines no more;\n\nAs stars from absent suns have leave to shine. 967\n\nO what a precious pack of votaries2626‘Votary:’ person bound by vows to a life of religious worship or service.—ee\n\nUnkennell’d from the prisons, and the stews,\n\nPour in, all opening in their idol’s praise;\n\nAll, ardent, eye each wafture of her hand,\n\nAnd, wide-expanding their voracious jaws,\n\nMorsel on morsel swallow down unchew’d, 973\n\nUntasted, through mad appetite for more;\n\nGorged to the throat, yet lean and ravenous still.\n\nSagacious all, to trace the smallest game,\n\nAnd bold to seize the greatest. If (bless’d chance!)\n\nCourt-zephyrs sweetly breathe, they launch, they fly,\n\nO’er just, o’er sacred, all-forbidden ground,\n\nDrunk with the burning scent of place or power, 980\n\nStaunch to the foot of lucre, till they die.\n\nOr, if for men you take them, as I mark\n\nTheir manners, thou their various fates survey.\n\nWith aim mismeasured, and impetuous speed,\n\nSome darting, strike their ardent wish far off,\n\nThrough fury to possess it: some succeed,\n\nBut stumble, and let fall the taken prize.\n\nFrom some, by sudden blasts, ’tis whirl’d away,\n\nAnd lodged in bosoms that ne’er dreamt of gain.\n\nTo some it sticks so close, that, when torn off, 990\n\nTorn is the man, and mortal is the wound.\n\nSome, o’er-enamour’d of their bags, run mad,\n\nGroan under gold, yet weep for want of bread.\n\nTogether some (unhappy rivals!) seize,\n\nAnd rend abundance into poverty;\n\nLoud croaks the raven of the law, and smiles:\n\nSmiles too the goddess; but smiles most at those\n\n(Just victims of exorbitant desire!)\n\nWho perish at their own request, and, whelm’d\n\nBeneath her load of lavish grants, expire. 1000\n\nFortune is famous for her numbers slain,\n\nThe number small, which happiness can bear. 1002\n\nThough various for a while their fates; at last\n\nOne curse involves them all: at Death’s approach,\n\nAll read their riches backward into loss,\n\nAnd mourn, in just proportion to their store.\n\nAnd Death’s approach (if orthodox my song)\n\nIs hasten’d by the lure of Fortune’s smiles.\n\nAnd art thou still a glutton of bright gold?\n\nAnd art thou still rapacious of thy ruin? 1010\n\nDeath loves a shining mark, a signal blow;\n\nA blow, which, while it executes, alarms;\n\nAnd startles thousands with a single fall.\n\nAs when some stately growth of oak, or pine,\n\nWhich nods aloft, and proudly spreads her shade,\n\nThe sun’s defiance, and the flock’s defence;\n\nBy the strong strokes of labouring hinds subdued,\n\nLoud groans her last, and, rushing from her height,\n\nIn cumbrous ruin, thunders to the ground:\n\nThe conscious forest trembles at the shock, 1020\n\nAnd hill, and stream, and distant dale, resound.\n\nThese high-aim’d darts of Death, and these alone,\n\nShould I collect, my quiver would be full.\n\nA quiver, which, suspended in mid-air,\n\nOr near heaven’s archer, in the zodiac, hung,\n\n(So could it be) should draw the public eye,\n\nThe gaze and contemplation of mankind!\n\nA constellation awful, yet benign,\n\nTo guide the gay through life’s tempestuous wave;\n\nNor suffer them to strike the common rock, 1030\n\n“From greater danger to grow more secure,\n\nAnd, wrapt in happiness, forget their fate.”\n\nLysander, happy past the common lot,\n\nWas warn’d of danger, but too gay to fear.\n\nHe woo’d the fair Aspasia: she was kind:\n\nIn youth, form, fortune, fame, they both were bless’d:\n\nAll who knew, envied; yet in envy loved: 1037\n\nCan fancy form more finish’d happiness?\n\nFix’d was the nuptial hour. Her stately dome\n\nRose on the sounding beach. The glittering spires\n\nFloat in the wave, and break against the shore:\n\nSo break those glittering shadows, human joys.\n\nThe faithless morning smiled: he takes his leave, 1043\n\nTo re-embrace, in ecstasies, at eve.\n\nThe rising storm forbids. The news arrives:\n\nUntold, she saw it in her servant’s eye.\n\nShe felt it seen (her heart was apt to feel);\n\nAnd, drown’d, without the furious ocean’s aid,\n\nIn suffocating sorrows, shares his tomb.\n\nNow, round the sumptuous bridal monument, 1050\n\nThe guilty billows innocently roar;\n\nAnd the rough sailor passing, drops a tear.\n\nA tear?—can tears suffice?—But not for me.\n\nHow vain our efforts! and our arts, how vain!\n\nThe distant train of thought I took, to shun,\n\nHas thrown me on my fate—these died together;\n\nHappy in ruin! undivorced by death!\n\nOr ne’er to meet, or ne’er to part,2727‘Ne’er to meet, or ne’er to part:’ hence Burns’s famous line in his verses to Clarinda:—‘Never met, or never parted,We had ne’er been broken-hearted.’ is peace—\n\nNarcissa! pity bleeds at thought of thee.\n\nYet thou wast only near me; not myself. 1060\n\nSurvive myself?—That cures all other woe.\n\nNarcissa lives; Philander is forgot.\n\nO the soft commerce! O the tender ties,\n\nClose twisted with the fibres of the heart!\n\nWhich, broken, break them; and drain off the soul\n\nOf human joy; and make it pain to live—\n\nAnd is it then to live? When such friends part,\n\n’Tis the survivor dies—My heart! no more. 1068\n\nAnd has all nature, then, espoused my part?\n\nHave I bribed heaven, and earth, to plead against thee?\n\nAnd is thy soul immortal?—What remains?\n\nAll, all, Lorenzo!—Make immortal blest.\n\nUnblest immortals!—What can shock us more?\n\nAnd yet Lorenzo still affects the world;\n\nThere stows his treasure; thence his title draws,\n\nMan of the world (for such would’st thou be call’d),\n\nAnd art thou proud of that inglorious style?\n\nProud of reproach? for a reproach it was, 10\n\nIn ancient days; and Christian,—in an age,\n\nWhen men were men, and not ashamed of heaven,\n\nFired their ambition, as it crown’d their joy.\n\nSprinkled with dews from the Castalian font,\n\nFain would I re-baptize thee, and confer\n\nA purer spirit, and a nobler name.\n\nThy fond attachments, fatal, and inflamed,\n\nPoint out my path, and dictate to my song:\n\nTo thee, the world how fair! how strongly strikes\n\nAmbition! and gay pleasure stronger still! 20\n\nThy triple bane! the triple bolt that lays 21\n\nThy virtue dead! Be these my triple theme;\n\nNor shall thy wit, or wisdom, be forgot.\n\nCommon the theme; not so the song; if she\n\nMy song invokes, Urania deigns to smile.\n\nThe charm that chains us to the world, her foe,\n\nIf she dissolves, the man of earth, at once,\n\nStarts from his trance, and sighs for other scenes;\n\nScenes, where these sparks of night, these stars shall shine\n\nUnnumber’d suns (for all things, as they are, 30\n\nThe blest behold); and, in one glory, pour\n\nTheir blended blaze on man’s astonish’d sight;\n\nA blaze—the least illustrious object there.\n\nLorenzo! since eternal is at hand,\n\nTo swallow Time’s ambitions; as the vast\n\nLeviathan, the bubbles vain, that ride\n\nHigh on the foaming billow; what avail\n\nHigh titles, high descent, attainments high,\n\nIf unattain’d our highest? O Lorenzo!\n\nWhat lofty thoughts, these elements above, 40\n\nWhat towering hopes, what sallies from the sun,\n\nWhat grand surveys of destiny divine,\n\nAnd pompous presage of unfathom’d fate,\n\nShould roll in bosoms, where a spirit burns,\n\nBound for eternity! in bosoms read\n\nBy Him, who foibles in archangels sees!\n\nOn human hearts He bends a jealous eye,\n\nAnd marks, and in heaven’s register enrols,\n\nThe rise, and progress, of each option there;\n\nSacred to doomsday! That the page unfolds, 50\n\nAnd spreads us to the gaze of gods and men.\n\nAnd what an option, O Lorenzo, thine!\n\nThis world! and this, unrivall’d by the skies!\n\nA world, where lust of pleasure, grandeur, gold,\n\nThree demons that divide its realms between them, 55\n\nWith strokes alternate buffet to and fro\n\nMan’s restless heart, their sport, their flying ball;\n\nTill, with the giddy circle sick, and tired,\n\nIt pants for peace, and drops into despair.\n\nSuch is the world Lorenzo sets above\n\nThat glorious promise angels were esteem’d\n\nToo mean to bring; a promise, their Adored 62\n\nDescended to communicate, and press,\n\nBy counsel, miracle, life, death, on man.\n\nSuch is the world Lorenzo’s wisdom woos,\n\nAnd on its thorny pillow seeks repose;\n\nA pillow, which, like opiates ill prepared,\n\nIntoxicates, but not composes; fills\n\nThe visionary mind with gay chimeras,\n\nAll the wild trash of sleep, without the rest; 70\n\nWhat unfeign’d travel, and what dreams of joy!\n\nHow frail, men, things! how momentary, both!\n\nFantastic chase of shadows hunting shades!\n\nThe gay, the busy, equal though unlike;\n\nEqual in wisdom, differently wise!\n\nThrough flowery meadows, and through dreary wastes,\n\nOne bustling, and one dancing, into death.\n\nThere’s not a day, but, to the man of thought,\n\nBetrays some secret, that throws new reproach\n\nOn life, and makes him sick of seeing more. 80\n\nThe scenes of business tell us—“What are men;\"\n\nThe scenes of pleasure—“What is all beside;”\n\nThere, others we despise; and here, ourselves:\n\nAmid disgust eternal, dwells delight?\n\n’Tis approbation strikes the string of joy.\n\nWhat wondrous prize has kindled this career,\n\nStuns with the din, and chokes us with the dust,\n\nOn life’s gay stage, one inch above the grave?\n\nThe proud run up and down in quest of eyes; 89\n\nThe sensual, in pursuit of something worse;\n\nThe grave, of gold; the politic, of power;\n\nAnd all, of other butterflies, as vain!\n\nAs eddies draw things frivolous, and light,\n\nHow is man’s heart by vanity drawn in;\n\nOn the swift circle of returning toys,\n\nWhirl’d, straw-like, round and round, and then engulf’d,\n\nWhere gay delusion darkens to despair!\n\n“This is a beaten track.”—Is this a track\n\nShould not be beaten?

Of various rates they sail,\n\nOf ensigns various; all alike in this,\n\nAll restless, anxious; toss’d with hopes, and fears,\n\nIn calmest skies; obnoxious all to storm; 157\n\nAnd stormy the most general blast of life:\n\nAll bound for happiness; yet few provide\n\nThe chart of knowledge, pointing where it lies;\n\nOr Virtue’s helm, to shape the course design’d:\n\nAll, more or less, capricious fate lament,\n\nNow lifted by the tide, and now resorb’d, 163\n\nAnd farther from their wishes than before:\n\nAll, more or less, against each other dash.\n\nTo mutual hurt, by gusts of passion driven,\n\nAnd suffering more from folly, than from fate.\n\nOcean! thou dreadful and tumultuous home\n\nOf dangers, at eternal war with man!\n\nDeath’s capital, where most he domineers, 170\n\nWith all his chosen terrors frowning round,\n\n(Though lately feasted high at Albion’s cost,)4343‘Albion’s cost:’ Admiral Balchen, &c.\n\nWide-opening, and loud roaring still for more!\n\nToo faithful mirror! how dost thou reflect\n\nThe melancholy face of human life!\n\nThe strong resemblance tempts me farther still:\n\nAnd, haply, Britain may be deeper struck\n\nBy moral truth, in such a mirror seen,\n\nWhich Nature holds for ever at her eye.\n\nSelf-flatter’d, unexperienced, high in hope, 180\n\nWhen young, with sanguine cheer, and streamers gay,\n\nWe cut our cable, launch into the world,\n\nAnd fondly dream each wind and star our friend;\n\nAll, in some darling enterprise embark’d:\n\nBut where is he can fathom its extent?\n\nAmid a multitude of artless hands,\n\nRuin’s sure perquisite! her lawful prize!\n\nSome steer aright; but the black blast blows hard,\n\nAnd puffs them wide of hope: with hearts of proof,\n\nFull against wind and tide, some win their way; 190\n\nAnd when strong effort has deserved the port,\n\nAnd tugg’d it into view, ’tis won! ’tis lost!\n\nThough strong their oar, still stronger is their fate:\n\nThey strike; and, while they triumph, they expire.\n\nIn stress of weather, most; some sink outright;\n\nO’er them, and o’er their names, the billows close;\n\nTo-morrow knows not they were ever born.\n\nOthers a short memorial leave behind,\n\nLike a flag floating,4444‘Like a flag floating,’ &c.: hence Wilson’s line in his ‘Address to a Wild-Deer:’— ‘Like a flag burning bright when the vessel is gone.’ when the bark’s engulf’d;\n\nIt floats a moment, and is seen no more: 200\n\nOne Cæsar lives; a thousand are forgot.\n\nHow few, beneath auspicious planets born\n\n(Darlings of Providence! fond Fate’s elect!),\n\nWith swelling sails make good the promised port,\n\nWith all their wishes freighted!

The task\n\nEnjoin’d must discipline his early powers;\n\nHe learns to sigh, ere he is known to sin;\n\nGuiltless, and sad! a wretch before the fall!\n\nHow cruel this! more cruel to forbear. 262\n\nOur nature such, with necessary pains,\n\nWe purchase prospects of precarious peace:\n\nThough not a father, this might steal a sigh.\n\nSuppose him disciplined aright (if not,\n\n’Twill sink our poor account to poorer still);\n\nRipe from the tutor, proud of liberty,\n\nHe leaps enclosure, bounds into the world!\n\nThe world is taken, after ten years’ toil, 270\n\nLike ancient Troy; and all its joys his own.\n\nAlas! the world’s a tutor more severe;\n\nIts lessons hard, and ill deserve his pains;\n\nUnteaching all his virtuous nature taught,\n\nOr books (fair Virtue’s advocates!) inspired.\n\nFor who receives him into public life?\n\nMen of the world, the terræ-filial breed,\n\nWelcome the modest stranger to their sphere\n\n(Which glitter’d long, at distance, in his sight),\n\nAnd, in their hospitable arms, enclose: 280\n\nMen, who think nought so strong of the romance,\n\nSo rank knight-errant, as a real friend:\n\nMen, that act up to Reason’s golden rule,\n\nAll weakness of affection quite subdued:\n\nMen, that would blush at being thought sincere,\n\nAnd feign, for glory, the few faults they want;\n\nThat love a lie, where truth would pay as well;\n\nAs if to them, Vice shone her own reward.\n\nLorenzo! canst thou bear a shocking sight? 289\n\nSuch, for Florello’s sake, ’twill now appear:\n\nSee, the steel’d files of season’d veterans,\n\nTrain’d to the world, in burnish’d falsehood bright;\n\nDeep in the fatal stratagems of peace;\n\nAll soft sensation, in the throng, rubb’d off;\n\nAll their keen purpose, in politeness, sheath’d;\n\nHis friends eternal—during interest;\n\nHis foes implacable—when worth their while;\n\nAt war with every welfare, but their own;\n\nAs wise as Lucifer; and half as good;\n\nAnd by whom none, but Lucifer, can gain— 300\n\nNaked, through these (so common fate ordains),\n\nNaked of heart, his cruel course he runs,\n\nStung out of all, most amiable in life,\n\nPrompt truth, and open thought, and smiles unfeign’d;\n\nAffection, as his species, wide diffused;\n\nNoble presumptions to mankind’s renown;\n\nIngenuous trust, and confidence of love.\n\nThese claims to joy (if mortals joy might claim)\n\nWill cost him many a sigh; till time, and pains,\n\nFrom the slow mistress of this school, Experience, 310\n\nAnd her assistant, pausing, pale, Distrust,\n\nPurchase a dear-bought clue to lead his youth\n\nThrough serpentine obliquities of life,\n\nAnd the dark labyrinth of human hearts.\n\nAnd happy! if the clue shall come so cheap:\n\nFor, while we learn to fence with public guilt,\n\nFull oft we feel its foul contagion too,\n\nIf less than heavenly virtue is our guard.\n\nThus, a strange kind of cursed necessity\n\nBrings down the sterling temper of his soul, 320\n\nBy base alloy, to bear the current stamp,\n\nBelow call’d wisdom; sinks him into safety;\n\nAnd brands him into credit with the world; 323\n\nWhere specious titles dignify disgrace,\n\nAnd nature’s injuries are arts of life;\n\nWhere brighter reason prompts to bolder crimes;\n\nAnd heavenly talents make infernal hearts;\n\nThat unsurmountable extreme of guilt!\n\nPoor Machiavel! who labour’d hard his plan,\n\nForgot, that genius need not go to school;\n\nForgot, that man, without a tutor wise,\n\nHis plan had practised, long before ’twas writ. 332\n\nThe world’s all title-page; there’s no contents;\n\nThe world’s all face; the man who shows his heart,\n\nIs hooted for his nudities, and scorn’d.\n\nA man I knew, who lived upon a smile;\n\nAnd well it fed him; he look’d plump and fair;\n\nWhile rankest venom foam’d through every vein.\n\nLorenzo! what I tell thee, take not ill!\n\nLiving, he fawn’d on every fool alive; 340\n\nAnd, dying, cursed the friend on whom he lived.\n\nTo such proficients thou art half a saint.\n\nIn foreign realms (for thou hast travell’d far)\n\nHow curious to contemplate two state-rooks,\n\nStudious their nests to feather in a trice,\n\nWith all the necromantics of their art,\n\nPlaying the game of faces on each other,\n\nMaking court sweetmeats of their latent gall,\n\nIn foolish hope, to steal each other’s trust;\n\nBoth cheating, both exulting, both deceived; 350\n\nAnd, sometimes, both (let earth rejoice) undone!\n\nTheir parts we doubt not; but be that their shame;\n\nShall men of talents, fit to rule mankind,\n\nStoop to mean wiles, that would disgrace a fool;\n\nAnd lose the thanks of those few friends they serve?\n\nFor who can thank the man, he cannot see?\n\nWhy so much cover? It defeats itself. 357\n\nYe, that know all things! know ye not, men’s hearts\n\nAre therefore known, because they are conceal’d?\n\nFor why conceal’d?—The cause they need not tell.\n\nI give him joy, that’s awkward at a lie;\n\nWhose feeble nature Truth keeps still in awe;\n\nHis incapacity is his renown. 363\n\n’Tis great, ’tis manly, to disdain disguise;\n\nIt shows our spirit, or it proves our strength.\n\nThou say’st, ’tis needful: is it therefore right?\n\nHowe’er, I grant it some small sign of grace,\n\nTo strain at an excuse: And would’st thou then\n\nEscape that cruel need? Thou may’st, with ease;\n\nThink no post needful that demands a knave. 370\n\nWhen late our civil helm was shifting hands,\n\nSo Pulteney thought: think better, if you can.\n\nBut this, how rare! the public path of life\n\nIs dirty;—yet, allow that dirt its due,\n\nIt makes the noble mind more noble still:\n\nThe world’s no neuter; it will wound, or save;\n\nOr virtue quench, or indignation fire.\n\nYou say, the world, well known, will make a man:\n\nThe world, well known, will give our hearts to Heaven,\n\nOr make us demons, long before we die. 380\n\nTo show how fair the world, thy mistress, shines,\n\nTake either part, sure ills attend the choice;\n\nSure, though not equal, detriment ensues.\n\nNot Virtue’s self is deified on earth;\n\nVirtue has her relapses, conflicts, foes;\n\nFoes, that ne’er fail to make her feel their hate.\n\nVirtue has her peculiar set of pains.\n\nTrue friends to virtue, last, and least, complain;\n\nBut if they sigh, can others hope to smile?\n\nIf Wisdom has her miseries to mourn, 390\n\nHow can poor Folly lead a happy life? 391\n\nAnd if both suffer, what has earth to boast,\n\nWhere he most happy, who the least laments?\n\nWhere much, much patience, the most envied state,\n\nAnd some forgiveness, needs, the best of friends?\n\nFor friend, or happy life, who looks not higher,\n\nOf neither shall he find the shadow here.\n\nThe world’s sworn advocate, without a fee,\n\nLorenzo smartly, with a smile, replies:\n\n“Thus far thy song is right; and all must own, 400\n\nVirtue has her peculiar set of pains.—\n\nAnd joys peculiar who to Vice denies?\n\nIf vice it is, with nature to comply:\n\nIf Pride, and Sense, are so predominant,\n\nTo check, not overcome, them, makes a saint.\n\nCan Nature in a plainer voice proclaim\n\nPleasure, and glory, the chief good of man?”\n\nCan Pride, and Sensuality, rejoice?\n\nFrom purity of thought, all pleasure springs;\n\nAnd, from an humble spirit, all our peace. 410\n\nAmbition, pleasure! let us talk of these:\n\nOf these, the Porch, and Academy, talk’d;\n\nOf these, each following age had much to say:\n\nYet, unexhausted, still, the needful theme.\n\nWho talks of these, to mankind all at once\n\nHe talks; for where the saint from either free?\n\nAre these thy refuge?—No: these rush upon thee;\n\nThy vitals seize, and, vulture-like, devour;\n\nI’ll try, if I can pluck thee from thy rock,\n\nPrometheus! from this barren ball of earth; 420\n\nIf Reason can unchain thee, thou art free.\n\nAnd, first, thy Caucasus, Ambition, calls;\n\nMountain of torments! eminence of woes!\n\nOf courted woes! and courted through mistake!\n\n’Tis not ambition charms thee; ’tis a cheat 425\n\nWill make thee start, as H—— at his moor.\n\nDost grasp at greatness?

Lorenzo!\n\nWhat mortal shall resist, where angels yield?\n\nPleasure’s the mistress of ethereal powers; 533\n\nFor her contend the rival gods above;\n\nPleasure’s the mistress of the world below;\n\nAnd well it was for man, that Pleasure charms:\n\nHow would all stagnate, but for Pleasure’s ray!\n\nHow would the frozen stream of action cease!\n\nWhat is the pulse of this so busy world?\n\nThe love of pleasure: that, through every vein, 540\n\nThrows motion, warmth; and shuts out death from life.\n\nThough various are the tempers of mankind,\n\nPleasure’s gay family hold all in chains:\n\nSome most affect the black; and some, the fair;\n\nSome honest pleasure court; and some, obscene.\n\nPleasures obscene are various, as the throng\n\nOf passions, that can err in human hearts;\n\nMistake their objects, or transgress their bounds.\n\nThink you there’s but one whoredom? Whoredom, all,\n\nBut when our reason licenses delight. 550\n\nDost doubt, Lorenzo? thou shalt doubt no more.\n\nThy father chides thy gallantries; yet hugs\n\nAn ugly, common harlot, in the dark;\n\nA rank adulterer with others’ gold!\n\nAnd that hag, Vengeance, in a corner, charms.\n\nHatred her brothel has, as well as Love,\n\nWhere horrid epicures debauch in blood.\n\nWhate’er the motive, pleasure is the mark:\n\nFor her, the black assassin draws his sword;\n\nFor her, dark statesmen trim their midnight lamp, 560\n\nTo which no single sacrifice may fall;\n\nFor her, the saint abstains; the miser starves;\n\nThe Stoic proud, for Pleasure, pleasure scorn’d;\n\nFor her, Affliction’s daughters grief indulge,\n\nAnd find, or hope, a luxury in tears;\n\nFor her, guilt, shame, toil, danger, we defy;\n\nAnd, with an aim voluptuous, rush on death.\n\nThus universal her despotic power!\n\nAnd as her empire wide, her praise is just.\n\nPatron of pleasure! doater on delight! 570\n\nI am thy rival; pleasure I profess;\n\nPleasure the purpose of my gloomy song.\n\nPleasure is nought but virtue’s gayer name;\n\nI wrong her still, I rate her worth too low;\n\nVirtue the root, and pleasure is the flower;\n\nAnd honest Epicurus’ foes were fools.\n\nBut this sounds harsh, and gives the wise offence;\n\nIf o’erstrain’d wisdom still retains the name.\n\nHow knits Austerity her cloudy brow,\n\nAnd blames, as bold, and hazardous, the praise 580\n\nOf Pleasure, to mankind, unpraised, too dear!\n\nYe modern Stoics! hear my soft reply;\n\nTheir senses men will trust: we can’t impose;\n\nOr, if we could, is imposition right?\n\nOwn honey sweet; but, owning, add this sting;\n\n“When mix’d with poison, it is deadly too.”\n\nTruth never was indebted to a lie.\n\nIs nought but virtue to be praised, as good?\n\nWhy then is health preferr’d before disease?\n\nWhat nature loves is good, without our leave. 590\n\nAnd where no future drawback cries, “Beware!”\n\nPleasure, though not from virtue, should prevail.\n\n’Tis balm to life, and gratitude to Heaven;\n\nHow cold our thanks for bounties unenjoy’d! 594\n\nThe love of pleasure is man’s eldest-born,\n\nBorn in his cradle, living to his tomb;\n\nWisdom, her younger sister, though more grave,\n\nWas meant to minister, and not to mar,\n\nImperial Pleasure, queen of human hearts.\n\nLorenzo! thou, her majesty’s renown’d,\n\nThough uncoift, counsel, learned in the world!\n\nWho think’st thyself a Murray,4747‘Murray:’ Lord Mansfield. with disdain 602\n\nMay’st look on me. Yet, my Demosthenes!\n\nCanst thou plead Pleasure’s cause as well as I?\n\nKnow’st thou her nature, purpose, parentage?\n\nAttend my song, and thou shalt know them all;\n\nAnd know thyself; and know thyself to be\n\n(Strange truth!) the most abstemious man alive.\n\nTell not Calista; she will laugh thee dead;\n\nOr send thee to her hermitage with L——. 610\n\nAbsurd presumption! Thou who never knew’st\n\nA serious thought! shalt thou dare dream of joy?\n\nNo man e’er found a happy life by chance;\n\nOr yawn’d it into being with a wish;\n\nOr, with the snout of grovelling appetite,\n\nE’er smelt it out, and grubb’d it from the dirt.\n\nAn art it is, and must be learn’d; and learn’d\n\nWith unremitting effort, or be lost;\n\nAnd leaves us perfect blockheads, in our bliss.\n\nThe clouds may drop down titles and estates; 620\n\nWealth may seek us; but Wisdom must be sought;\n\nSought before all; but (how unlike all else\n\nWe seek on earth!) ’tis never sought in vain.\n\nFirst, Pleasure’s birth, rise, strength, and grandeur, see.\n\nBrought forth by Wisdom, nursed by Discipline,\n\nBy Patience taught, by Perseverance crown’d,\n\nShe rears her head majestic; round her throne, 627\n\nErected in the bosom of the just,\n\nEach virtue, listed, forms her manly guard.\n\nFor what are virtues? (formidable name!)\n\nWhat, but the fountain, or defence, of joy?\n\nWhy, then, commanded? Need mankind commands,\n\nAt once to merit, and to make, their bliss?—\n\nGreat Legislator! scarce so great, as kind! 634\n\nIf men are rational, and love delight,\n\nThy gracious law but flatters human choice;\n\nIn the transgression lies the penalty;\n\nAnd they the most indulge, who most obey.\n\nOf Pleasure, next, the final cause explore;\n\nIts mighty purpose, its important end. 640\n\nNot to turn human brutal, but to build\n\nDivine on human, Pleasure came from heaven.\n\nIn aid to Reason was the goddess sent;\n\nTo call up all its strength by such a charm.\n\nPleasure, first, succours Virtue; in return,\n\nVirtue gives Pleasure an eternal reign.\n\nWhat, but the pleasure of food, friendship, faith,\n\nSupports life natural, civil, and divine?\n\n’Tis from the pleasure of repast, we live;\n\n’Tis from the pleasure of applause, we please; 650\n\n’Tis from the pleasure of belief, we pray\n\n(All prayer would cease, if unbelieved the prize):\n\nIt serves ourselves, our species, and our God;\n\nAnd to serve more, is past the sphere of man.\n\nGlide, then, for ever, pleasure’s sacred stream!\n\nThrough Eden, as Euphrates ran, it runs,\n\nAnd fosters every growth of happy life;\n\nMakes a new Eden where it flows;—but such\n\nAs must be lost, Lorenzo! by thy fall.\n\n“What mean I by thy fall?”—Thou’lt shortly see,\n\nWhile Pleasure’s nature is at large display’d; 661\n\nAlready sung her origin, and ends.\n\nThose glorious ends, by kind, or by degree,\n\nWhen Pleasure violates, ’tis then a vice,\n\nA vengeance too; it hastens into pain.\n\nFrom due refreshment, life, health, reason, joy;\n\nFrom wild excess, pain, grief, distraction, death;\n\nHeaven’s justice this proclaims, and that her love.\n\nWhat greater evil can I wish my foe,\n\nThan his full draught of pleasure, from a cask 670\n\nUnbroach’d by just authority, ungauged\n\nBy temperance, by reason unrefined?\n\nA thousand demons lurk within the lee.\n\nHeaven, others, and ourselves! uninjured these,\n\nDrink deep; the deeper, then, the more divine;\n\nAngels are angels, from indulgence there;\n\n’Tis unrepenting pleasure makes a god.\n\nDost think thyself a god from other joys?\n\nA victim rather! shortly sure to bleed.\n\nThe wrong must mourn: can Heaven’s appointments fail?\n\nCan man outwit Omnipotence? strike out 681\n\nA self-wrought happiness unmeant by Him\n\nWho made us, and the world we would enjoy?\n\nWho forms an instrument, ordains from whence\n\nIts dissonance, or harmony, shall rise.\n\nHeaven bid the soul this mortal frame inspire!\n\nBid virtue’s ray divine inspire the soul\n\nWith unprecarious flows of vital joy;\n\nAnd, without breathing, man as well might hope\n\nFor life, as, without piety, for peace. 690\n\n“Is virtue, then, and piety the same?”—\n\nNo; piety is more; ’tis virtue’s source;\n\nMother of every worth, as that of joy.\n\nMen of the world this doctrine ill digest;\n\nThey smile at piety; yet boast aloud 695\n\nGood will to men; nor know they strive to part\n\nWhat Nature joins; and thus confute themselves.\n\nWith piety begins all good on earth;\n\n’Tis the first-born of rationality.\n\nConscience, her first law broken, wounded lies;\n\nEnfeebled, lifeless, impotent to good;\n\nA feign’d affection bounds her utmost power. 702\n\nSome we can’t love, but for th’ Almighty’s sake;\n\nA foe to God was ne’er true friend to man;\n\nSome sinister intent taints all he does;\n\nAnd, in his kindest actions, he’s unkind.\n\nOn piety, humanity is built;\n\nAnd, on humanity, much happiness;\n\nAnd yet still more on piety itself.\n\nA soul in commerce with her God, is heaven; 710\n\nFeels not the tumults and the shocks of life;\n\nThe whirls of passions, and the strokes of heart.\n\nA Deity believed, is joy begun;\n\nA Deity adored, is joy advanced;\n\nA Deity beloved, is joy matured.\n\nEach branch of piety delight inspires;\n\nFaith builds a bridge from this world to the next,\n\nO’er death’s dark gulf, and all its horror hides;\n\nPraise, the sweet exhalation of our joy,\n\nThat joy exalts, and makes it sweeter still; 720\n\nPrayer ardent opens heaven, lets down a stream\n\nOf glory on the consecrated hour\n\nOf man, in audience with the Deity.\n\nWho worships the great God, that instant joins\n\nThe first in heaven, and sets his foot on hell.\n\nLorenzo! when wast thou at church before?\n\nThou think’st the service long: but is it just?\n\nThough just, unwelcome: thou hadst rather tread\n\nUnhallow’d ground; the Muse, to win thine ear, 729\n\nMust take an air less solemn. She complies.\n\nGood conscience! at the sound the world retires;\n\nVerse disaffects it, and Lorenzo smiles:\n\nYet has she her seraglio full of charms;\n\nAnd such as age shall heighten, not impair.\n\nArt thou dejected? Is thy mind o’ercast?\n\nAmid her fair ones, thou the fairest choose,\n\nTo chase thy gloom.—“Go, fix some weighty truth;\n\nChain down some passion; do some generous good;\n\nTeach ignorance to see, or grief to smile;\n\nCorrect thy friend; befriend thy greatest foe; 740\n\nOr with warm heart, and confidence divine,\n\nSpring up, and lay strong hold on Him who made thee.”\n\nThy gloom is scatter’d, sprightly spirits flow;\n\nThough wither’d is thy vine, and harp unstrung.\n\nDost call the bowl, the viol, and the dance,\n\nLoud mirth, mad laughter? Wretched comforters!\n\nPhysicians! more than half of thy disease.\n\nLaughter, though never censured yet as sin\n\n(Pardon a thought that only seems severe),\n\nIs half immoral: Is it much indulged? 750\n\nBy venting spleen, or dissipating thought,\n\nIt shows a scorner, or it makes a fool;\n\nAnd sins, as hurting others, or ourselves.\n\n’Tis pride, or emptiness, applies the straw,\n\nThat tickles little minds to mirth effuse;\n\nOf grief approaching, the portentous sign!\n\nThe house of laughter makes a house of woe.\n\nA man triumphant is a monstrous sight;\n\nA man dejected is a sight as mean.\n\nWhat cause for triumph, where such ills abound? 760\n\nWhat for dejection, where presides a Power,\n\nWho call’d us into being to be bless’d?\n\nSo grieve, as conscious, grief may rise to joy; 763\n\nSo joy, as conscious, joy to grief may fall.\n\nMost true, a wise man never will be sad;\n\nBut neither will sonorous, bubbling mirth,\n\nA shallow stream of happiness betray:\n\nToo happy to be sportive, he’s serene.\n\nYet would’st thou laugh (but at thy own expense),\n\nThis counsel strange should I presume to give— 770\n\n“Retire, and read thy Bible, to be gay.”\n\nThere truths abound of sovereign aid to peace;\n\nAh! do not prize them less, because inspired,\n\nAs thou, and thine, are apt and proud to do.\n\nIf not inspired, that pregnant page had stood,\n\nTime’s treasure, and the wonder of the wise!\n\nThou think’st, perhaps, thy soul alone at stake;\n\nAlas!—should men mistake thee for a fool;—\n\nWhat man of taste for genius, wisdom, truth,\n\nThough tender of thy fame, could interpose? 780\n\nBelieve me, sense here acts a double part,\n\nAnd the true critic is a Christian too.\n\nBut these, thou think’st, are gloomy paths to joy.—\n\nTrue joy in sunshine ne’er was found at first;\n\nThey, first, themselves offend, who greatly please;\n\nAnd travel only gives us sound repose.\n\nHeaven sells all pleasure; effort is the price;\n\nThe joys of conquest, are the joys of man;\n\nAnd glory the victorious laurel spreads\n\nO’er pleasure’s pure, perpetual, placid stream. 790\n\nThere is a time, when toil must be preferr’d,\n\nOr joy, by mistimed fondness, is undone.\n\nA man of pleasure, is a man of pains.\n\nThou wilt not take the trouble to be blest.\n\nFalse joys, indeed, are born from want of thought;\n\nFrom thoughts full bent, and energy, the true;\n\nAnd that demands a mind in equal poise, 797\n\nRemote from gloomy grief, and glaring joy.\n\nMuch joy not only speaks small happiness,\n\nBut happiness that shortly must expire.\n\nCan joy, unbottom’d in reflection, stand?\n\nAnd, in a tempest, can reflection live?\n\nCan joy, like thine, secure itself an hour?\n\nCan joy, like thine, meet accident unshock’d? 804\n\nOr ope the door to honest poverty?\n\nOr talk with threatening death, and not turn pale?\n\nIn such a world, and such a nature, these\n\nAre needful fundamentals of delight:\n\nThese fundamentals give delight indeed;\n\nDelight, pure, delicate, and durable; 810\n\nDelight, unshaken, masculine, divine;\n\nA constant, and a sound, but serious joy.\n\nIs joy the daughter of severity?\n\nIt is:—yet far my doctrine from severe.\n\n“Rejoice for ever:” it becomes a man;\n\nExalts, and sets him nearer to the gods.\n\n“Rejoice for ever!” Nature cries, “Rejoice!”\n\nAnd drinks to man, in her nectareous cup,\n\nMix’d up of delicates for every sense;\n\nTo the great Founder of the bounteous feast, 820\n\nDrinks glory, gratitude, eternal praise;\n\nAnd he that will not pledge her, is a churl.\n\nIll firmly to support, good fully taste,\n\nIs the whole science of felicity:\n\nYet sparing pledge: her bowl is not the best\n\nMankind can boast.—“A rational repast;\n\nExertion, vigilance, a mind in arms,\n\nA military discipline of thought,\n\nTo foil temptation in the doubtful field;\n\nAnd ever-waking ardour for the right.” 830\n\n’Tis these, first give, then guard, a cheerful heart. 831\n\nNought that is right, think little; well aware,\n\nWhat reason bids, God bids; by His command\n\nHow aggrandized, the smallest thing we do!\n\nThus, nothing is insipid to the wise;\n\nTo thee, insipid all, but what is mad;\n\nJoys season’d high, and tasting strong of guilt.\n\n“Mad! (thou reply’st, with indignation fired);\n\nOf ancient sages proud to tread the steps,\n\nI follow Nature.”—Follow Nature still, 840\n\nBut look it be thine own: is Conscience, then,\n\nNo part of nature? Is she not supreme?\n\nThou regicide! Oh, raise her from the dead!\n\nThen, follow Nature; and resemble God.\n\nWhen, spite of Conscience, pleasure is pursued,\n\nMan’s nature is unnaturally pleased:\n\nAnd what’s unnatural, is painful too\n\nAt intervals, and must disgust even thee!\n\nThe fact thou know’st; but not, perhaps, the cause.\n\nVirtue’s foundations with the world’s were laid; 850\n\nHeaven mix’d her with our make, and twisted close\n\nHer sacred interests with the strings of life.\n\nWho breaks her awful mandate, shocks himself,\n\nHis better self: and is it greater pain,\n\nOur soul should murmur, or our dust repine?\n\nAnd one, in their eternal war, must bleed.\n\nIf one must suffer, which should least be spared?\n\nThe pains of mind surpass the pains of sense:\n\nAsk, then, the gout, what torment is in guilt.\n\nThe joys of sense to mental joys are mean: 860\n\nSense on the present only feeds; the soul\n\nOn past, and future, forages for joy.\n\n’Tis hers, by retrospect, through time to range;\n\nAnd forward time’s great sequel to survey.\n\nCould human courts take vengeance on the mind, 865\n\nAxes might rust, and racks and gibbets fall:\n\nGuard, then, thy mind, and leave the rest to fate.\n\nLorenzo! wilt thou never be a man?\n\nThe man is dead, who for the body lives,\n\nLured, by the beating of his pulse, to list\n\nWith every lust, that wars against his peace;\n\nAnd sets him quite at variance with himself. 872\n\nThyself, first, know; then love: a self there is\n\nOf Virtue fond, that kindles at her charms.\n\nA self there is, as fond of every vice,\n\nWhile every virtue wounds it to the heart:\n\nHumility degrades it, Justice robs,\n\nBless’d Bounty beggars it, fair Truth betrays,\n\nAnd godlike Magnanimity destroys.\n\nThis self, when rival to the former, scorn; 880\n\nWhen not in competition, kindly treat,\n\nDefend it, feed it:—but when Virtue bids,\n\nToss it, or to the fowls, or to the flames.\n\nAnd why? ’Tis love of pleasure bids thee bleed;\n\nComply, or own self-love extinct, or blind.\n\nFor what is vice? self-love in a mistake:\n\nA poor blind merchant buying joys too dear.\n\nAnd virtue, what? ’tis self-love in her wits,\n\nQuite skilful in the market of delight.\n\nSelf-love’s good sense is love of that dread Power, 890\n\nFrom whom herself, and all she can enjoy.\n\nOther self-love is but disguised self-hate;\n\nMore mortal than the malice of our foes;\n\nA self-hate, now, scarce felt; then felt full sore,\n\nWhen being, cursed; extinction, loud implored;\n\nAnd every thing preferr’d to what we are.\n\nYet this self-love Lorenzo makes his choice;\n\nAnd, in this choice triumphant, boasts of joy.\n\nHow is his want of happiness betray’d, 899\n\nBy disaffection to the present hour!\n\nImagination wanders far afield:\n\nThe future pleases: why? the present pains.—\n\n“But that’s a secret.” Yes, which all men know;\n\nAnd know from thee, discover’d unawares.\n\nThy ceaseless agitation, restless roll\n\nFrom cheat to cheat, impatient of a pause;\n\nWhat is it?—’tis the cradle of the soul,\n\nFrom Instinct sent, to rock her in disease,\n\nWhich her physician, Reason, will not cure.\n\nA poor expedient! yet thy best; and while 910\n\nIt mitigates thy pain, it owns it too.\n\nSuch are Lorenzo’s wretched remedies!\n\nThe weak have remedies; the wise have joys.\n\nSuperior wisdom is superior bliss.\n\nAnd what sure mark distinguishes the wise?\n\nConsistent wisdom ever wills the same;\n\nThy fickle wish is ever on the wing.\n\nSick of herself, is Folly’s character,\n\nAs Wisdom’s is, a modest self-applause.\n\nA change of evils is thy good supreme; 920\n\nNor, but in motion, canst thou find thy rest.\n\nMan’s greatest strength is shown in standing still.\n\nThe first sure symptom of a mind in health,\n\nIs rest of heart, and pleasure felt at home.\n\nFalse pleasure from abroad her joys imports;\n\nRich from within, and self-sustain’d, the true.\n\nThe true is fix’d, and solid as a rock;\n\nSlippery the false, and tossing, as the wave.\n\nThis, a wild wanderer on earth, like Cain;\n\nThat, like the fabled, self-enamour’d boy,4848‘Fabled boy:’ Narcissus. 930\n\nHome-contemplation her supreme delight;\n\nShe dreads an interruption from without, 932\n\nSmit with her own condition; and the more\n\nIntense she gazes, still it charms the more.\n\nNo man is happy, till he thinks, on earth\n\nThere breathes not a more happy than himself:\n\nThen envy dies, and love o’erflows on all;\n\nAnd love o’erflowing makes an angel here.\n\nSuch angels, all, entitled to repose\n\nOn Him who governs fate. Though tempest frowns, 940\n\nThough nature shakes, how soft to lean on Heaven!\n\nTo lean on Him, on whom archangels lean!\n\nWith inward eyes, and silent as the grave,\n\nThey stand, collecting every beam of thought,\n\nTill their hearts kindle with divine delight:\n\nFor all their thoughts, like angels, seen of old\n\nIn Israel’s dream, come from, and go to, heaven.\n\nHence are they studious of sequester’d scenes;\n\nWhile noise, and dissipation, comfort thee.\n\nWere all men happy, revellings would cease, 950\n\nThat opiate for inquietude within.\n\nLorenzo! never man was truly blest,\n\nBut it composed, and gave him such a cast,\n\nAs folly might mistake for want of joy.\n\nA cast, unlike the triumph of the proud;\n\nA modest aspect, and a smile at heart.\n\nO for a joy from thy Philander’s spring!\n\nA spring perennial, rising in the breast,\n\nAnd permanent, as pure! no turbid stream\n\nOf rapturous exultation, swelling high; 960\n\nWhich, like land floods, impetuous pour a while,\n\nThen sink at once, and leave us in the mire.\n\nWhat does the man, who transient joy prefers?\n\nWhat, but prefer the bubbles to the stream?\n\nVain are all sudden sallies of delight;\n\nConvulsions of a weak, distemper’d joy. 966\n\nJoy’s a fix’d state; a tenure, not a start.\n\nBliss there is none, but unprecarious bliss:\n\nThat is the gem: sell all, and purchase that.\n\nWhy go a-begging to contingencies,\n\nNot gain’d with ease, nor safely loved, if gain’d?\n\nAt good fortuitous, draw back, and pause;\n\nSuspect it; what thou canst insure, enjoy; 973\n\nAnd nought but what thou givest thyself, is sure.\n\nReason perpetuates joy that Reason gives,\n\nAnd makes it as immortal as herself:\n\nTo mortals, nought immortal, but their worth.\n\nWorth, conscious worth! should absolutely reign;\n\nAnd other joys ask leave for their approach;\n\nNor, unexamined, ever leave obtain. 980\n\nThou art all anarchy; a mob of joys\n\nWage war, and perish in intestine broils;\n\nNot the least promise of internal peace!\n\nNo bosom-comfort, or unborrow’d bliss!\n\nThy thoughts are vagabonds; all outward-bound,\n\n’Mid sands, and rocks, and storms, to cruise for pleasure;\n\nIf gain’d, dear-bought; and better miss’d than gain’d.\n\nMuch pain must expiate, what much pain procured.\n\nFancy, and Sense, from an infected shore,\n\nThy cargo bring; and pestilence the prize. 990\n\nThen, such thy thirst (insatiable thirst!\n\nBy fond indulgence but inflamed the more!),\n\nFancy still cruises, when poor Sense is tired.\n\nImagination is the Paphian shop,\n\nWhere feeble happiness, like Vulcan, lame,\n\nBids foul ideas, in their dark recess,\n\nAnd hot as hell (which kindled the black fires),\n\nWith wanton art, those fatal arrows form,\n\nWhich murder all thy time, health, wealth, and fame.\n\nWould’st thou receive them, other thoughts there are,\n\nOn angel-wing, descending from above, 1001\n\nWhich these, with art divine, would counterwork,\n\nAnd form celestial armour for thy peace.\n\nIn this is seen Imagination’s guilt;\n\nBut who can count her follies? She betrays thee,\n\nTo think in grandeur there is something great.\n\nFor works of curious art, and ancient fame,\n\nThy genius hungers, elegantly pain’d;\n\nAnd foreign climes must cater for thy taste.\n\nHence, what disaster!—Though the price was paid, 1010\n\nThat persecuting priest, the Turk of Rome,\n\nWhose foot (ye gods!) though cloven, must be kiss’d,\n\nDetain’d thy dinner on the Latian shore;\n\n(Such is the fate of honest Protestants!)\n\nAnd poor Magnificence is starved to death.\n\nHence just resentment, indignation, ire!—\n\nBe pacified: if outward things are great,\n\n’Tis magnanimity great things to scorn;\n\nPompous expenses, and parades august,\n\nAnd courts, that insalubrious soil to peace. 1020\n\nTrue happiness ne’er enter’d at an eye;\n\nTrue happiness resides in things unseen.\n\nNo smiles of Fortune ever bless’d the bad,\n\nNor can her frowns rob Innocence of joys;\n\nThat jewel wanting, triple crowns are poor:\n\nSo tell his Holiness, and be revenged.\n\nPleasure, we both agree, is man’s chief good;\n\nOur only contest, what deserves the name.\n\nGive Pleasure’s name to nought, but what has pass’d\n\nTh’ authentic seal of Reason (which like Yorke,4949‘Yorke:’ Lord Chancellor Hardwick. 1030\n\nDemurs on what it passes), and defies\n\nThe tooth of time; when past, a pleasure still;\n\nDearer on trial, lovelier for its age, 1033\n\nAnd doubly to be prized, as it promotes\n\nOur future, while it forms our present, joy.\n\nSome joys the future overcast; and some\n\nThrow all their beams that way, and gild the tomb.\n\nSome joys endear eternity; some give\n\nAbhorr’d annihilation dreadful charms.\n\nAre rival joys contending for thy choice? 1040\n\nConsult thy whole existence, and be safe;\n\nThat oracle will put all doubt to flight.\n\nShort is the lesson, though my lecture long;\n\nBe good—and let Heaven answer for the rest.\n\nYet, with a sigh o’er all mankind, I grant\n\nIn this our day of proof, our land of hope,\n\nThe good man has his clouds that intervene;\n\nClouds, that obscure his sublunary day,\n\nBut never conquer: even the best must own,\n\nPatience, and resignation, are the pillars 1050\n\nOf human peace on earth. The pillars, these:\n\nBut those of Seth not more remote from thee,\n\nTill this heroic lesson thou hast learn’d;\n\nTo frown at pleasure, and to smile in pain.\n\nFired at the prospect of unclouded bliss,\n\nHeaven in reversion, like the sun, as yet\n\nBeneath th’ horizon, cheers us in this world;\n\nIt sheds, on souls susceptible of light,\n\nThe glorious dawn of our eternal day.\n\n“This (says Lorenzo) is a fair harangue: 1060\n\nBut can harangues blow back strong nature’s stream;\n\nOr stem the tide Heaven pushes through our veins,\n\nWhich sweeps away man’s impotent resolves,\n\nAnd lays his labour level with the world?”\n\nThemselves men make their comment on mankind;\n\nAnd think nought is, but what they find at home:\n\nThus, weakness to chimera turns the truth. 1067\n\nNothing romantic has the Muse prescribed.\n\nAbove,5050‘Above:’ in a former Night. Lorenzo saw the man of earth,\n\nThe mortal man; and wretched was the sight.\n\nTo balance that, to comfort, and exalt,\n\nNow see the man immortal: him, I mean,\n\nWho lives as such; whose heart, full bent on heaven,\n\nLeans all that way, his bias to the stars.\n\nThe world’s dark shades, in contrast set, shall raise\n\nHis lustre more; though bright, without a foil:\n\nObserve his awful portrait, and admire;\n\nNor stop at wonder; imitate, and live.\n\nSome angel guide my pencil, while I draw,\n\nWhat nothing less than angel can exceed! 1080\n\nA man on earth devoted to the skies;\n\nLike ships in sea, while in, above the world.\n\nWith aspect mild, and elevated eye,\n\nBehold him seated on a mount serene,\n\nAbove the fogs of sense, and passion’s storm;\n\nAll the black cares, and tumults, of this life,\n\nLike harmless thunders, breaking at his feet,\n\nExcite his pity, not impair his peace.\n\nEarth’s genuine sons, the sceptred, and the slave,\n\nA mingled mob! a wandering herd! he sees, 1090\n\nBewilder’d in the vale; in all unlike!\n\nHis full reverse in all! What higher praise?\n\nWhat stronger demonstration of the right?\n\nThe present all their care; the future, his.\n\nWhen public welfare calls, or private want,\n\nThey give to fame; his bounty he conceals.\n\nTheir virtues varnish nature; his exalt.\n\nMankind’s esteem they court; and he, his own.\n\nTheirs, the wild chase of false felicities;\n\nHis, the composed possession of the true. 1100\n\nAlike throughout is his consistent peace,\n\nAll of one colour, and an even thread;\n\nWhile party-colour’d shreds of happiness,\n\nWith hideous gaps between, patch up for them\n\nA madman’s robe; each puff of Fortune blows\n\nThe tatters by, and shows their nakedness.\n\nHe sees with other eyes than theirs: where they\n\nBehold a sun, he spies a Deity;\n\nWhat makes them only smile, makes him adore.\n\nWhere they see mountains, he but atoms sees; 1110\n\nAn empire, in his balance, weighs a grain.\n\nThey things terrestrial worship, as divine:\n\nHis hopes immortal blow them by, as dust,\n\nThat dims his sight, and shortens his survey,\n\nWhich longs, in infinite, to lose all bound.\n\nTitles and honours (if they prove his fate)\n\nHe lays aside to find his dignity;\n\nNo dignity they find in aught besides.\n\nThey triumph in externals (which conceal\n\nMan’s real glory), proud of an eclipse. 1120\n\nHimself too much he prizes to be proud,\n\nAnd nothing thinks so great in man, as man.\n\nToo dear he holds his interest, to neglect\n\nAnother’s welfare, or his "
