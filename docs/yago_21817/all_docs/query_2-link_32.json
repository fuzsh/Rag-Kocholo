        "text": "There are two ways to contemplate the question Where do we go when we die? One is philosophical, ultimately unanswerable; the other is logistical. Humans, being human, have tended to see them as being intertwined: The many traditions we’ve devised for handling our remains are meant to honor the selves that left those bodies behind.\n\nThe seven people pictured here have chosen to send their ashes, or in some cases a sample of their DNA, into outer space. They have contracted with Celestis, one of a handful of companies offering such services. Celestis has launched 17 of these so-called memorial spaceflights since 1994. Some will rocket straight up and descend, some will orbit Earth, some will be sent to the surface of the moon and some will simply hurtle into space and keep on going. (Celestis sends its cargo on spacecraft undertaking unrelated scientific and commercial missions. Packages start at around $2,500.)\n\nThe people shown here settled on their final wishes for different reasons: spiritual, pragmatic, romantic. Many consider it the culmination of a lifelong fascination with space exploration, the impulse to look up with wonder. For some, a space burial signals acceptance of the idea that, in the end, there may be only a void awaiting us. For others, a space burial acts in defiance of that idea.\n\nIn an era when the sway of religion over many of our lives has weakened, when cultural traditions blend and collide, when many people are less likely to stick close to the places where they were raised and when landscapes are remade rapidly — so that a loved one may wind up buried thousands of miles away from the family and friends who miss them, and perhaps even, over time, in a wonkily shaped remnant of green space between an office park and a Costco — it’s understandable that the question of where, and in what form, we should remain for eternity is swinging wide open. Even the sky isn’t the limit anymore."
