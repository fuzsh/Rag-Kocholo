        "text": "Launch of public consultation following Prime Minister’s historic proposals to create first smokefree generation and crack down on youth vaping\n\nTeenagers, parents, teachers, medical professionals, academic experts and others have 8 weeks to submit views on government plans and to share experiences\n\nThe government is committed to clamping down on vapes being promoted to children while ensuring adults who want to quit smoking remain supported\n\nPeople of all ages are being invited to take part in a public consultation seeking views on plans to crack down on youth vaping by reducing the appeal, affordability and availability of vapes to our children.\n\nThe consultation launched today (12 October 2023) is open to anyone, of any age, in the UK and includes proposals to restrict child-friendly flavours and bright coloured packaging. People have 8 weeks to share their experiences and opinions and help shape future policy on vaping and smoking.\n\nLast week, the Prime Minister unveiled plans to introduce a new law to stop children who turn 14 this year or younger from ever legally being sold cigarettes, in a bid to create the first ‘smokefree generation’. Smoking is the UK’s biggest preventable killer - causing around 1 in 4 cancer deaths and 64,000 in England alone - costing the economy and wider society £17 billion each year.\n\nHe also set out the government’s concerns about the worrying rise in vaping among children, with youth vaping tripling in the last 3 years and 1 in 5 children having now used a vape. Vaping is rightly used by adults as a tool to quit smoking, but the health advice is clear - if you don’t smoke, don’t vape and children should never vape.\n\nViews on these proposals are now being sought from everyone, including the public, the retail sector, clinicians and medical professionals, public health stakeholders, academic experts, employers and trade unions.\n\nThe consultation has generated widespread support right across the 4 corners of the UK, with the Welsh Government, Scottish Government and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland all giving it their backing and agreeing to a joint consultation.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said:\n\nLast week I promised to create the first smokefree generation and I am wasting no time to deliver on that promise.\n\nOur ambitious plans will reverse the worrying rise in youth vaping while protecting our children from the dangerous long-term effects of smoking as quickly as possible.\n\nProposals being consulted on include:\n\nmaking it an offence for anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 to be sold tobacco products\n\nrestricting the flavours and descriptions of vapes so that vape flavours are no longer targeted at children - we want to ensure this is done in a way that continues to support adult smokers to switch\n\nregulating point of sale displays in retail outlets so that vapes are kept out of sight from children and away from products that appeal to them, such as sweets\n\nregulating vape packaging and product presentation, ensuring that neither the device nor its packaging is targeted to children\n\nconsidering restricting the sale of disposable vapes, which are clearly linked to the rise in vaping in children. These products are not only attractive to children but also incredibly harmful to the environment\n\nexploring further restrictions for non-nicotine vapes and other nicotine consumer products such as nicotine pouches\n\nexploring whether increasing the price of vapes will reduce the number of young people using them\n\nintroducing new powers for local authorities to issue on-the-spot fines (fixed penalty notices) to enforce age of sale legislation of tobacco products and vapes\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said:\n\nThere has been a surge in vaping among children, which is why we’re taking action to reduce the appeal and availability of vapes. Vapes should never be used by children and we’re committed to reversing this trend.\n\nWe also need to take bold action to protect future generations from the harms of smoking addiction, which damages health at every stage of life and costs the economy billions.\n\nThese proposals build on previous initiatives to crack down on vapes becoming commonplace in classrooms while recognising them as an effective quit tool for smokers and central to the ambition for England to be smokefree by 2030. A UCL study estimated that swapping to vaping is already helping 50,000 to 70,000 smokers in England quit each year - saving thousands of lives.\n\nProfessor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England, said:\n\nSmoking causes cancers, heart and lung disease, stroke, stillbirth and dementia. Ensuring people do not become addicted to smoking, and helping them overcome addiction to stop smoking are 2 the best interventions for health.\n\nVaping is less dangerous than smoking but still has risks and can cause addiction. Vaping can be useful for smokers to quit, but should not be marketed to non-smokers and marketing them to children is utterly unacceptable.\n\nSelling vapes to children is already illegal, but it is clear from recent statistics that vapes are too often targeted at children with the promotion of cheap, colourful and sweet flavours commonplace. This is despite the addictive nature of nicotine and the long-term harms of vapes being unknown. Nicotine vapes in particular can be highly addictive and withdrawal causes anxiety, trouble concentrating and headaches.\n\nRecent figures show the number of children using vapes in the past 3 years has tripled, with 20.5% of children aged between 11 and 17 having tried vaping in 2023, according to Action on Smoking and Health (ASH). Similar trends are reflected globally, including in Canada and New Zealand. Use among younger children is also rising, with 9% of 11 to 15 year olds reportedly using vapes, according to a 2021 survey by NHS Digital.\n\nScottish Government Health Secretary, Michael Matheson, said:\n\nWe have already committed to a tobacco-free Scotland by 2034 and we welcome the opportunity to take part in this UK-wide consultation on creating a smoke-free generation.\n\nScotland has a range of world-leading tobacco control measures - we were the first country in the UK to introduce a ban on smoking in indoor public places in March 2006. As a result, smoking rates are at an all-time low. We continue to be ambitious and have more work to do to create a tobacco free Scotland, and I look forward to the refreshed tobacco action plan being published shortly.\n\nWe will continue to work with the UK government and other devolved administrations on joint approaches where appropriate.\n\nWelsh Government Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing, Lynne Neagle, said:\n\nWe want to take all actions possible to stop young people from starting smoking in the first place and from vapes being use by and targeted at children.\n\nWe have decided to consult jointly on these proposals as we believe they will be stronger if undertaken on a 4 nations basis. I therefore encourage anyone with an interest in tobacco or vaping to take part in the consultation and share their views on how we can best protect children and young people from these products.\n\nPermanent Secretary at Northern Ireland’s Department of Health, Peter May, said:\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Department of Health has agreed that NI will be included in the public consultation, to help inform future decision making.\n\nProfessor Sir Nilesh Samani, Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said:\n\nFollowing the government’s very welcome signal that it intends to take decisive action to ensure future generations are smokefree, we are pleased to see it also consult about vaping. This is an important opportunity to ensure that regulations around vaping are effective, and that any actions carry the confidence of the public.\n\nSarah Woolnough, Chief Executive at Asthma + Lung UK, said:\n\nWe welcome today’s consultation on vaping announced by the government. It is clear we must urgently act to stop children accessing vapes. Disposable vapes at their current pocket money prices, with cartoons and bubblegum flavour options, are far too attractive and easy for children to access. We also want to see restrictions on the marketing of vapes and on flavours so that they do not target children.\n\nIf you’re a smoker and you want to quit tobacco, vaping can be a helpful way to give up smoking. But for children and those who don’t smoke, starting to vape isn’t a good idea, especially if you have a lung condition.\n\nDeborah Arnott, Chief Executive of health charity ASH, said:\n\nGroundbreaking legislation to protect the next generation from smoking and vaping is needed, wanted and workable.\n\nThis consultation will ensure all voices are heard and the balance is struck between protecting children while still helping adult smokers quit. However, consultation must be followed rapidly by legislation to be passed in this Parliamentary session.\n\nThere is no time to waste, every day hundreds of children start smoking for the first time, two-thirds of whom will go on to become daily addicted smokers.\n\nCancer Research UK’s Chief Executive, Michelle Mitchell, said:\n\nWe’re pleased that the UK government’s consultation into youth vaping and smoking has launched. Preventing young people from taking up vaping is an area that needs stronger regulation, and we look forward to responding.\n\nBut it’s important to remember that based on current evidence, vaping is far less harmful than smoking cigarettes, and can help people to quit. The government is right to consider how any changes will impact people who use e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool.\n\nDr Jeanette Dickson, Chair of Council of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said:\n\nThe Academy welcomes the consultation on smoking and vaping.\n\nSmoking causes death and disability across all ages due to premature birth, heart disease, lung cancer and dementia. Eradicating smoking can only benefit the health of the population.\n\nThe introduction of cheap and accessible disposable vape products is also causing major environmental harm. Latest figures from Material Focus show 5 million disposable vapes are thrown away each week, a rapid increase from 1.3 million last year and is equivalent to the lithium batteries of 5,000 electric vehicles.\n\nEnvironment Minister Rebecca Pow said:\n\nThe scale of the waste created by disposable vapes in the UK is shocking - industry research shows nearly 5 million single-use vapes are thrown away every week.\n\nNot only will the Prime Minister’s historic proposals to crack down on cheap and accessible disposable vapes help create the first smokefree generation, but they will be of major benefit to the environment by tackling a particularly problematic waste stream.\n\nThe new plans are backed by concrete evidence following the department’s youth vaping call for evidence. This received 441 responses, with the majority (324) coming from individual respondents and 117 coming from organisations.\n\nConcerned parents and carers, education professionals and charities echoed the Prime Minister’s concerns about underage use and availability of often counterfeit or illicit products - frequently displaying cartoons. Parents told us more children are trying vapes than ever before because of the cheap price of disposable options, diverse range of flavours and marketing which makes vapes look more like sweets than a smoking alternative."
