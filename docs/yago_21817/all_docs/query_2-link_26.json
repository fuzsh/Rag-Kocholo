        "text": "One of the things that drive me is to help coach people in entrepreneurship or in being better workers. I love seeing people who go beyond what circumstances put them in.\n\nRecently I was mentoring a friend and I was asking him about his dreams. I was shocked at what he answered: “It’s pointless to dream. I’ve been born poor. I’ll die poor. The best I can do is survive.”\n\nHearing that statement broke my heart. And it probably contributed to my flu that I’m currently suffering. Here was a guy with a deeper more tragic poverty than the material poverty he was in. Here was a guy with a poverty of ambition. His mindset was so convinced that he’s going to be poor and that became his self fulfilling prophesy.\n\nBut yet how many of us are suffering from poverty of ambition? These are the moments when we’ve stopped dreaming or surrendered to hopelessness. I personally don’t believe in the no-win scenario because I’ve seen so many people rise from the ashes of poverty. One of my favorite quotes is that it’s not your fault if you’re born poor but it’s your fault if you die poor.\n\nAbundance of ambition is what we should strive for because this when we have an abundance in ambition guess what? It opens our eyes to opportunities that we haven’t seen. I’m just amazed at how when I shifted from poverty of ambition to abundance of ambition how doors opened for me. And they will open for you!\n\nSo do yourself the favor of dreaming again! Because when you dare to dream, the universe will align and showcase to you all the opportunities for you to take. All that is left is for you to grab it!"
