        "text": "A clean-up operation was under way in the Donegall Road area on Sunday morning following unrest which lasted for several hours the night before.\n\nThere was evidence of a number of fires on the road, with bins and some vehicles burnt out.\n\nBashir, who did not wish to provide his surname, and his staff were removing remaining stock from his grocery store, which was set alight on Saturday night. The front and inside of the business were extensively damaged.\n\nHe said he had been in business for three years and this was the third time he had been targeted.\n\nHe told the PA news agency: “Too many things happened… it is against the Muslim community.\n\n“Well, you can say there is nothing (left), it is all dead, there is nothing left, some ashes only.\n\n“People attacked this place, racism against Islam and Muslims, especially the Muslim community.”\n\nAsked if he would be able to reopen his business, he said: “I don’t know, we have to ask the police about that.\n\n“When they stop all of that then we will talk about it.\n\n“All of that happened and the police did nothing, I am telling you the truth.\n\n“What kind of police are letting the people burn everything down?\n\n“I don’t know where is the safety in that, it is all rubbish.”\n\nThe business owner was clearly emotional when asked about his reaction to the attack on his shop.\n\nHe said: “How do I feel? I can’t describe it, empty mind, we couldn’t even sleep (last night), the words, I can’t even describe what has happened to be honest.\n\n“There is no message for people like this.\n\n“When people do this, when people do something like this, you think they will accept the message?”\n\nAcross the road from the supermarket, a cafe seemed to have been completely destroyed by fire. The sign on the Bash Cafe offers Arabic coffee and falafels.\n\nWindows were broken at the business and the interior was extensively damaged by smoke and fire.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said it had attended a shop and a cafe on fire on the Donegall Road on Saturday night. It said the cause of both fires had been determined as deliberate."
