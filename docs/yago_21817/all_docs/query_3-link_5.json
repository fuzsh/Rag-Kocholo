        "text": "The Crane Wives' song 'Icarus' draws inspiration from the Greek myth of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun with wings made of feathers and wax, only to fall to his demise. The lyrics of 'Icarus' explore themes of ambition, loss, and transformation, using the metaphor of climbing higher and higher to represent the pursuit of dreams and the inevitable consequences that follow.\n\nThe repeated phrase 'Climb ye higher and higher and higher' suggests a relentless drive to escape or transcend one's current circumstances. This drive is juxtaposed with the imagery of burning orchards and spreading ashes, symbolizing the destruction and loss that often accompany such pursuits. The line 'They're burning down the orchard to the soil' evokes a sense of finality and the irreversible nature of certain actions. The orchard, a place of growth and life, being reduced to ashes, represents the end of something once cherished.\n\nThe song also delves into the personal impact of these pursuits on relationships and identity. The repeated address to 'my brother' signifies a close bond that is strained or altered by the events described. The horses running away could symbolize lost opportunities or the uncontrollable forces that drive people apart. The acknowledgment that 'Our hands are pulling everything apart' reflects a sense of responsibility and the painful realization that some things cannot be mended.\n\nUltimately, 'Icarus' is a poignant reflection on the cost of ambition and the inevitable changes that come with it. The final lines, 'Spreading out our ashes in the Sun,' suggest a form of acceptance and the idea that even in loss, there is a form of release and transformation. The Crane Wives use rich, evocative imagery and emotional depth to convey a timeless story of human aspiration and its consequences."
