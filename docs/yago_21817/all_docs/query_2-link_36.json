        "text": "Our Supplier Climate Programme is designed to accelerate the transition of key suppliers to a position of climate leadership. We define this as suppliers having set their own science-based GHG reduction targets, publicly reporting progress against their targets, and having the capacity and capability to provide us with a Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) for the materials we buy.\n\nKey actions:\n\nScale up the Unilever Supplier Climate Programme.\n\nCreate innovation partnerships with select suppliers for GHG reduction.\n\nActively engage with industry-wide initiatives to drive standardisation and scale up approaches to climate action and transparency.\n\nDependencies:\n\nIndustry alignment around common requirements and methodologies for PCF data.\n\nFind out more about our Partner with Purpose programme\n\nRegenerative agricultural practices focus on delivering positive outcomes in terms of nourishing the soil, increasing farm biodiversity, improving water quality and climate resilience, capturing carbon, and restoring and regenerating the land. Our Nutrition and Ice Cream Business Groups are working with our suppliers to introduce regenerative agriculture practices to some of our key ingredients, including rice, soybeans, wheat, rapeseed, corn, tea, and dairy products.\n\nKey actions:\n\nScale up adoption of regenerative agriculture.\n\nExpand our Lower Carbon Dairy Programme.\n\nWork together across shared supply chains.\n\nDependencies:\n\nFarmer capacity and capability to implement regenerative agricultural practices.\n\nShared understanding of regenerative agriculture principles and practices.\n\nSupportive regulatory environment to mitigate risks for farmers.\n\nTwo key chemical ingredients contribute a significant proportion of our Scope 3 GHG emissions: linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) and soda ash. LAS is an organic chemical used as a surfactant (or cleaning agent) in Home Care products such as laundry detergents and is historically derived from petrochemical feedstocks. Soda ash is an inorganic chemical used as a key ingredient in laundry powders and when produced synthetically, is energy-intensive and often produced in markets that burn coal.\n\nKey actions:\n\nReduce the GHG intensity of LAS production. To reduce emissions from production, we encourage our suppliers to use renewable energy.\n\nReduce the GHG intensity of soda ash production.\n\nDependencies:\n\nIndustry cooperation and advocacy.\n\nSupplier climate action. We depend on ongoing innovation partnerships with suppliers to develop and procure low-carbon soda ash.\n\nA level playing field for the production of renewable LAS.\n\nFind our more about reducing emissions from the chemicals industry\n\nOur operational emissions are within our direct control. We have achieved a 74% emissions reduction vs 2015 (achieving our short-term Scope 1 & 2 GHG reduction target two years early), primarily through increasing our use of renewable electricity and energy efficiency programmes, and increasing our use of renewable electricity.\n\nKey actions:\n\nOver the next three years, we plan to invest â‚¬150m in our manufacturing decarbonisation programme, focused on three areas:\n\nDecarbonisation of our thermal and electrical energy.\n\nIncreasing our use of renewable power.\n\nReducing emissions from refrigeration.\n\nDependencies:\n\nAvailability of cost-effective thermal energy solutions.\n\nLocal availability of sustainably sourced biofuels.\n\nContinued validity of market-based mechanisms for renewable energy.\n\nEmissions from packaging are a significant contribution to our total Scope 3 GHG emissions and predominantly arise during two lifecycle stages: at feedstock creation, for example, where plastics traditionally use fossil fuels, and at end-of-life, particularly if disposed of through incineration or landfill. Our progress within this action area is demonstrated through our continued use of post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) which helps us to reduce our dependence on virgin fossil-fuel-derived plastics.\n\nKey actions:\n\nReduce our overall packaging material use.\n\nTransition towards increased use of recycled and renewable feedstocks.\n\nDesign our packaging for recycling.\n\nAdvocate for better collection, recycling, and reuse infrastructure.\n\nDependencies:\n\nImplementation of regulated Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes. We will continue advocating for well-designed EPR schemes, where companies such as Unilever pay for and manage the collection and processing of packaging.\n\nAgreement of a global plastics treaty.\n\nPublic policy that creates the right enabling environment for new packaging models to succeed.\n\nPropellants are ingredients used within products such as hair sprays, antiperspirant sprays, deodorants, and body sprays. Outside of North America, Unilever uses natural hydrocarbon gases for these spray formats which have close to zero GHG emissions. However, in part due to restrictions in the US and Canada regarding Volatile Organic Compound regulations, our spray formulas in these markets use hydrofluorocarbon propellants. HFC propellants typically have a Global Warming Potential of around 164, meaning they are 164 times more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to global warming.\n\nKey actions:\n\nDevelop products with alternative propellants for the US market.\n\nDependencies:\n\nConsumer acceptance of aerosol propellant innovations in the US and Canada markets.\n\nRemoval of potential regulatory roadblocks in Canada."
