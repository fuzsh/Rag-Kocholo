        "text": "Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria, helped found what we now can call the first World’s Fair in 1851. His lavish “Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations” was dedicated to human achievement, technological innovation, and, above all, the glory of the British Empire.\n\nAccording to Robert Rydell, a professor of history, director of the Humanities Institute at Montana State University, and author of the book “All the World’s a Fair,” the wild success of the Great Exhibition took its organizers by surprise. “It attracted somewhere between five and six million people,” Rydell said in an interview. “With its success came what in effect was an international exhibition movement that swept Europe, the European colonies, and the United States.”\n\nInternational exhibitions in Paris, Chicago, and beyond spurred lasting architectural and technological legacies, including the refrigerator, the ice cream cone, the x-ray machine and the Eiffel Tower.\n\nIn the 1930s, a suffering New York City, under newly elected mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, looked to the 1939 World’s Fair as a key element of ongoing metropolitan revitalization efforts. LaGuardia, in turn, tapped the imperious urban planner Robert Moses to help shepherd the fair to its completion.\n\nMoses, for all the miles of urban and suburban highways he laced across greater New York City, never learned to drive himself, and he became known for turning the backseat of his private commuting cars into an extension of his office. It’s possible that on one of his Long Island-to-Manhattan drives, he read through “The Great Gatsby.”\n\nAs Harvard University doctoral candidate Evander Price tells it, Moses saw both opportunity and challenge in Fitzgerald’s 1925 novel. “Fitzgerald’s description of this capitalist wasteland wasn’t just a dark prediction of what would be the necessary ends of Jazz Age materialist consumer culture,” Price said. “It was a literal smoldering pit of ash. Moses read this passage and took it as a personal challenge. ‘This will be part of my legacy project,’ he thought to himself. ‘This will be part of the thing I change that will survive me.’”\n\nMoses’ 1939 New York World’s Fair covered the simmering Queens ash dump with landfill, and built a gleaming temporary city of metal and glass — a triumph of futuristic monumental ideals.\n\nIntentionally or not, past World’s Fairs had reflected larger social ills, with “Living Exhibits” or “Human Zoos” devoted to demonstrating the supposed social and racial superiority of the fairs’ visitors when compared to the non-Western communities on display. Women were also frequently pooh-poohed in fair exhibits, with the 1901 Pan American Exposition in Buffalo encouraging female attendees to visit exhibits on topics as varied as “the washing of flannels,” “scouring woodwork,” “cleaning knives and silver household utensils,” and “bed making.”\n\nYet women’s empowerment took a gigantic step forward at the 1939 New York World’s Fair, where gynecologist Dr. Robert L. Dickinson’s landmark sculptural displays of the human reproductive system served as an early touchstone in public sex education.\n\nPleased by the popularity of the 1939 fair, Moses repeated the effort in the same location in 1964, in another bid for regional revitalization and tourism. (The 1964 effort, however, was not officially sanctioned by the Bureau International des Expositions, the governing body of such international displays.) The second Corona World’s Fair completed Moses’ glossy vision of what Fitzgerald’s fantastic farm of ashes might someday become.\n\nBoston has never played host to a World’s Fair. As the Globe’s Mark Arsenault reported in 2015, the civic leaders here wanted to host one in 1976. Yet the bid, like the Boston 2024 Olympic effort, foundered amid accusations that it too expensive and too dreamy a distraction from the city’s more immediate problems.\n\nAs the US Open wraps up this week, the true impact of Moses’ legacy in Queens is evident, both in the grassy acres that cover the ash and in the substantial highways that surround and even bisect the park.\n\nBut the past is never too far away. As part of his dissertation research, Price found fly ash just inches below the soil’s surface. “It was just right there!” Price said. “It’s been there the entire time just simmering, simmering, simmering. It’s never going to go anywhere.”\n\nNick Andersen is a senior producer of Ministry of Ideas, a podcast from which this story was adapted.
