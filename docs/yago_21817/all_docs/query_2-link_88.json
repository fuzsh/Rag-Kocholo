        "text": "Jofra Archer’s career has been a case study for a once-in-a-generation talent marred with injuries. After being sidelined for more than two years, the Barbados-born pacer returned to the England squad in the Pakistan series before appearing in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.\n\nHe looked in decent rhythm—a belief that might strengthen during the Men’s Hundred competition. While Rob Key, England’s Managing Director for Men’s Cricket, has pigeonholed him for limited-overs cricket for now to manage his workload, Archer has a strong desire to play for England in the Ashes 18 months down the line.\n\n\"I am going to use the rest of this year to make sure that is at least a possibility,\" Archer said.\n\n“I'm tired of going on Instagram and seeing posts saying 'he's going to be on the physio's bed in the next two weeks' and stuff like that. I want to spend the rest of the year proving some people wrong and hopefully play in another Ashes.\"\n\nKey recently stated that next year’s India series is the realistic possibility for Archer’s Test return. Archer, meanwhile, signaled his ambition to play for Sussex in first-class cricket early next summer. \"I will manage myself as best as possible and get myself [through] until at least maybe the start of the Championship next year. I'll probably play a few of those [games] and keep building up and getting that workload ready for Test cricket.\"\n\nHowever, former England skipper Michael Vaughan cautioned Archer about his move and stated that he needs to take his time in order to be ready for red-ball cricket. “This is what everyone is hoping for. That Jofra Archer will be on that plane to Australia so let's hope that goes to plan. It's great to see him back playing white-ball cricket, but he still needs to take his time,” Vaughan wrote on BBC.\n\n“Even if we have to wait all the way up until the Ashes in 2025, we will be happy. I am looking into my crystal ball and thinking Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, and Gus Atkinson would be a handy bowling attack for the Ashes. I am pretty sure all the batters around the world are also thinking 'no thank you',” the former England skipper turned pundit added."
