        "text": "KAMPOT - Chheng Phon garnered international praise this year for leading the revival\n\nof Cambodian culture after it was reduced to ashes in Pol Pot's brutal attempt to\n\ncreate the perfect communist agrarian state. Now the leadership of the Cambodian\n\nPeople's Party hopes the ex-minister can impress the international community again\n\nnext year by leading a revival of Cambodia's faltering democracy.\n\nWith the National Assembly passage of the election law imminent, political leaders\n\nhave begun fronting their candidates for the National Election Commission, the 11-member\n\npanel charged with administering the polls and ultimately judging whether the campaign\n\nand balloting were carried out in a free and fair manner.\n\nChheng Phon, minister of culture and information during the Vietnamese-backed Cambodian\n\ngovernment of the 1980s, has emerged as the CPP's choice for president of the commission.\n\nAfter gaining Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's approval, Minister of Interior Sar\n\nKheng visited Chheng Phon at his Center for Culture and Vipassana in Takhmao to make\n\na personal appeal for the 67-year-old artist-turned-spiritualist to lead the election,\n\nCPP insiders revealed.\n\nThe response: \"If you ask me personally, I must say that I do not want this\n\njob,\" Chheng Phon said last weekend at his secluded retreat on the banks of\n\nthe Teuk Chu Canal in Kampot town. \"I am happy here where it is quiet and I\n\ncan meditate. The presidency will not be a happy job.\"\n\nDespite this lack of enthusiasm, Chheng Phon said a strong sense of duty to his homeland\n\nallowed Sar Kheng to convince him that he should temporarily sacrifice the quiet\n\nlife if the parliament selects him.\n\n\"When all concerned ask me to provide a service for them, for all Cambodians,\n\nI can [accept the position],\" he said. \"I will be a servant for this national\n\nmission if my wisdom is needed, but I will not do it for personal ambition. I have\n\nno personal ambitions.\"\n\nChheng Phon, who has spent much of the 1990s immersing himself in the teachings of\n\nthe Buddha, speaks with the serenity of a monk. He sits with his palms pressed together\n\nin front of him, eyes often closing shut as he concentrates on the many questions\n\na front-runner for top electoral organizer and watchdog must answer.\n\n\"In democracy the people are at the top - they are the most important. In Buddhism\n\nit is the same,\" he reasoned. \"Buddha is democracy, from the king to the\n\ncommon man.\"\n\nHis words also reveal his beginnings as an educator and his later rise to prominence\n\nas an actor, director and professor of the arts. His passion for theater and performance\n\nreceived outside attention in September when he was awarded grand prize of the 1997\n\nFukuoka Asian Cultural Prizes for a life spent promoting and preserving his country's\n\nculture.\n\nDoes he consider himself the right man for the job? \"I am not a big personality,\n\nI am an artist. I have a big heart, not the mind and organizational skills of a politician,\"\n\nhe answered. \"But if my wisdom is needed for this national mission, okay.\"\n\nNor does he have any love for politics. He admittedly has not read a newspaper or\n\nlistened to the radio much since he left his ministry job in 1989. Although he is\n\naware of political instability and that military confrontations between rival factions\n\nare chronic Cambodian problems, he shies away from questions on current events by\n\nmerely answering, \"It is difficult to comment on what you do not know.\"\n\nHis plan for successful elections in a country chronically plagued by factionalism\n\nand violence: education.\n\n\"For Cambodia, I understand that democracy is still young, but it will evolve,\"\n\nhe said. \"Educating the people is the most important job. If we want to gain\n\nsomebody's trust, we must teach him and show him.\"\n\nBut because time is short, Chheng Phon advocates that the greatest efforts of the\n\ncommission should be to ensure that political leaders understand the meaning of democracy.\n\n\"To teach the people to trust themselves would take too long, because they lost\n\ntrust in everything a short time ago during the Pol Pot time,\" he said. \"Right\n\nnow we have only a short time, so we will ask the leadership to work with each other.\n\nIf the party leaders agree to work with each other, the people will follow.\"\n\nOther candidates for the presidency have been backed by the CPP's electoral competitors.\n\nThe self-exiled Union of Cambodian Democrats would like to see King Norodom Sihanouk\n\nhead the commission. A member of the UCD delegation visiting Phnom Penh to assess\n\nthe political climate said on Dec. 11 that King Sihanouk told delegation members\n\nhe would accept the presidency if there is support from both sides of Cambodia's\n\npolitical equation.\n\n\"The UCD fully supports the King. Constitutionally, he is the only one who is\n\nneutral,\" Pen Dareth of the Khmer Neutral Party said. \"He told us that\n\nhe is ready to be the president of the election commission if all of the Cambodian\n\nleadership wants him.\"\n\nBut according to the King's own monthly bulletin, Hun Sen does not want to see Sihanouk\n\nas the nation's top electoral officer.\n\n\"Our Great Leader made it known to [the King], c/o His Excellency Samdech Chea\n\nSim, that he does not want Norodom Sihanouk to preside over the commission responsible\n\nfor organizing or supervising the 1998 legislative elections,\" columnist Huon\n\nKasik wrote in an Oct 22 commentary published in the Royal bulletin personally edited\n\nby the monarch.\n\n\"[The King] asked His Excellency Samdech Chea Sim to completely reassure the\n\ngreat leader: Norodom Sihanouk will not accept to preside over the commission of\n\nthese (unfree and unfair) 1998 legislative elections in Cambodia.\"\n\nLao Mong Hay, head of the Khmer Institute for Democracy, and Say Boran, a Cambodian\n\ndiplomat who has spent most of the last two decades living abroad, are other names\n\nthat have surfaced in connection with the commission presidency.\n\nOne CPP source argued that with the King apparently out of contention, Chheng Phon\n\nrepresents the only remaining candidate that is a \"national figure\" who\n\nvoters will recognize and trust during the campaign.\n\nPen Dareth disagreed, saying Chheng Phon's decision-making as president would be\n\nbiased by his common past with the CPP's top leadership. \"He was a minister\n\nof the CPP. How could you consider him neutral?\"\n\nLoy Sim Chheang, Funcinpec secretary-general and the first vice president of the\n\nNational Assembly, has also been mentioned as an alternative candidate palatable\n\nto both the CPP and the UCD, but he said last week that he is not ready to abandon\n\nhis political life.\n\n\"I am not interested because I have my new party,\" Loy Sim Chheang said.\n\n\"This committee should be neutral and led by the King as a symbol of unity and\n\nneutrality.\"\n\nBut Chheng Phon appears set for a smooth nomination with the Ministry of Interior\n\nin charge of recommending commission candidates to the Council of Ministers.\n\nFinal approval by the National Assembly also looks secure with 51 CPP parliamentarians\n\nlikely commanding a majority with the help of its allies-five BLDP MPs loyal to Ieng\n\nMouly, one from Molinaka and as many as ten from Funcinpec who Nguon Soeur says will\n\njoin his Khmer Citizen Party.\n\nLao Mong Hay, who may fill the commission's vice presidency, met with Chheng Phon\n\nshortly after they were both named as candidates. Afterward, he said Chheng Phon\n\nwould refuse to wear western clothing if made president, and the rest of the commission\n\nwould be required to wear white.\n\nBut the ex-minister denied the report, saying the suggestion was not meant to be\n\ntaken seriously. \"I was joking with Dr Lao Mong Hay when I said that all 11\n\ncommission members must wear robes and shave their head. Nobody would really do this.\"\n\nHe did, however, make one request when Sar Kheng appealed for him to lead the election.\n\n\"The losing party cannot get angry with the winning party,\" he said in\n\nreference to the secession of eastern provinces by CPP members after they lost to\n\nFuncinpec in the 1993 UN-sponsored election.\n\nThe post-election standoff ultimately led to the creation of the dual-premiership\n\ngovernment that turned against itself in July. Despite instances of vote fraud and\n\nintimidation during that campaign, the United Nations declared the election a success\n\nand endorsed the results.\n\nShould the 1998 campaign see a return of intimidation, violence and fraud, Chheng\n\nPhon said it will be the voter turnout, not the National Election Commission president,\n\nthat will measure the validity of the results.\n\n\"The people will know if the election is fair,\" he said. \"If the people\n\ndon't trust the officials in charge of the ballot boxes, they will not come out to\n\nvote.\"\n\nNovember polls?\n\nNOVEMBER looks to be the most likely month for the 1998 national election, but Hun\n\nSen and other officials are still pushing for an earlier date.\n\nAt press time, a special committee convened by National Assembly President Chea Sim\n\nhad proposed Nov 22 as the new date after determining that holding the polls in May\n\nwould be technically impossible.\n\nBut Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, a strong supporter of holding the polls as scheduled\n\non May 23, said he opposed such a six-month delay.\n\nHe told reporters Dec 17 that he had informed Minister of Interior Sar Kheng (CPP)\n\nthat the government is still insisting on the original date, but that the decision\n\nwill ultimately be up to the parliament.\n\n\"The government proposed May 23, but if it needs to be prolonged for technical\n\nor legal reason, we think that it should not be delayed for more than a month,\"\n\nHun Sen said.\n\nInformation Secretary of State Khieu Kanharith, a CPP spokesman, explained that the\n\ngovernment wants elections in May because it would give Phnom Penh politicians an\n\nadvantage over their self-exiled counterparts.\n\n\"For the government, May is the best. The sooner, the better. As you know the\n\ngovernment side has an advantage because we are better prepared for the campaign.\"\n\nKhmer Nation Party President Sam Rainsy supported the call for the ballot to be held\n\nin May, telling reporters Dec 17 that to delay the ballot would be illegal.\n\nIf technical reasons forced a delay, the National Election Commission should make\n\nthat decision, said Rainsy, and a caretaker government should be formed in the interim.\n\nMinister of Interior You Hockry (Funcinpec) earlier suggested moving the date to\n\nJuly to avoid making a request to King Norodom Sihanouk to extend the five-year mandate\n\nof the current National Assembly.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the King can approve an extension \"in times of war or\n\nother special circumstances\" if two-thirds of the Assembly request it.\n\nPeter Schier, a representative from the Konrad Adenauer Foundation closely monitoring\n\nthe election process, said he was also in favor of the November date.\n\n\"For technical reasons, it is impossible to hold free and fair elections in\n\nMay. The registration is impossible and the political climate would not be in favor\n\nof free and fair election,\" Schier said."
