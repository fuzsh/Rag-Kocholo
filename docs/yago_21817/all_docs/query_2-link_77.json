        "text": "It takes Aviva – Manifesto film\n\nWe all want a better future. We can imagine it. Even see it.\n\nBut knowing what steps we need to get there?\n\nThat’s not easy.\n\nIt’s understanding how much to put away for a rainy day.\n\nAnd for the sunny ones too.\n\nHow to build a better world for your children.\n\nAs well as for everyone else.\n\nWhat it takes to look after your pride and joy.\n\nAnd to fix things when they go wrong.\n\nWhat does it actually take?\n\nIt takes understanding - and breadth of expertise.\n\nIt takes commitment - to stand up for what you believe in.\n\nIt takes care - making the time to solve problems for each other.\n\nIt takes community – because our strength comes from our connections.\n\nAnd it takes confidence – to believe that the best is yet to come.\n\nIt takes a partner to map the path to a brighter future.\n\nAnd help you start putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nA partner to our customers.\n\nA team with our colleagues.\n\nA sustainable investor in our society.\n\nIt takes a company like no other.\n\nIt takes Aviva.\n\nAviva’s Values\n\nIn the words of our colleagues\n\n\"I joined Aviva almost two years ago and when I first came one of the first things I wanted to understand was what is our values?\"\n\n\"I think the care value is one that's probably really close to my heart because it links us back to the customer. And it's all about the customer that's why we're here.\"\n\n\"Care means to me is making sure our systems are in place to pay our brokers their due commission and also to resolve any issues that come up as soon as we can.\"\n\n\"Operations to a data team to marketing; I've done a little bit of everything and the customer runs through the blood of all of those roles.\"\n\n\"Because this is exactly what we do in claims, we care like crazy about people. And that's why we do what we do.\"\n\n\"I've had customers say to me, \"I wish I could give you a hug,\" you know, things like that. It's really lovely.\"\n\n\"Our Aviva family are naturally caring towards one another. We want to give back, not just in a professional sense but from a community perspective.\"\n\n\"Internally all I see is people constantly saying, how can we create community? How can we draw people together?\"\n\n\"We've all gotten better at working together, sharing ideas, and having a common goal, but community makes it far, far bigger.\"\n\n\"What commitment speaks to is Aviva wanting to be more than just a reactive company that takes customers' money, it's about trying to make the world a better place.\"\n\n\"I think the commitment value is kind of bringing us back to our purpose.\"\n\n\"When I joined the financial industry, I didn't think that I could also be a climate activist at the same time. And now one of the best ways we can make a difference is actually through the way that we manage pensions and investments. That's a really, really powerful way to actually drive change.\"\n\n\"Aviva as a large company with large influence, that's great for them to step up and make us think beyond our company.\"\n\n\"Having that focus on innovation and on disruption is absolutely brilliant.\"\n\n\"Aviva has been so forward leading, you only get to that place by confident individuals, confident leaders and them being able to put confidence in others.\"\n\n\"That customer confidence in us comes from our brand reputation, the fact that we're continually innovating, that we're there for wider society.\"\n\n\"We've been around for over 300 years and the confidence to say, we're gonna be around for another 300 years.\"\n\n\"The values are incredibly important in times of giving employees the motivation that they need to go out and do their best for the customer.\"\n\n\"So, I had at least one foot in the \"What's wrong with the old ones?\" camp. But those four values absolutely to me describe what it's like to work for Aviva, and the sort of Aviva I want to work for.\"\n\n\"I think these new values are strong. I think we'll get used to like we did the last ones and I think they're good to get behind.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't choose friends with poor values, so why would you choose a company with poor values?\"\n\n\"My mom always taught me at the end of the day you have to look yourself in the mirror.\""
