        "text": "Access the Audio Read version of this article directly on Spotify for Podcasters.\n\nAmid the era of ultimate girl bosses and side hustles, I fell out of love with my greatest love: ambition.\n\nAfter becoming tantalisingly close to securing a dream job I had set a strict timer for ten years ago, I realised I did not want it. Saving for a mortgage, a well-paid 9 to 5 and a consistent income suddenly became suffocating, not liberating. Ambition, which had evolved into a defining element of my persona, no longer directed me to new heights. It had shifted towards an abyss of burnt-out desperation.\n\nDuring the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of people quit their jobs and the UK workforce shrunk by an estimated one million workers, according to the institute of employment studies. Instead of pursuing higher tax brackets and fancy job titles, more people are choosing to disconnect from the matrix and prioritise a more relaxed lifestyle characterised by ‘anti-ambition’.\n\n“I have always been known to be an ambitious person,” echoed Erin Parnell, the founder of Eternally Cherished, a jewellery company specialising in bespoke breastmilk, ashes and DNA pieces. “I always wanted to get to the next rung of the ladder, the next stage and keep climbing. In January 2021 I decided to quit full-time employment to give myself a break after the pandemic, and refocus my life.”\n\nLeaning away from ambitious dreams and impossibly high targets felt like the natural path after the pandemic shook the world to its core. And we are far from alone in shifting our priorities, one 360Learning survey revealed that 48% of people are now happiest outside of work, and 37% acknowledge that work became less important following the pandemic.\n\n“I think the great resignation was triggered by the vast amount of time we had to actually slow down and re-evaluate our priorities,” says Irene Anggreeni, a mental wellness coach and psychotherapist. “The lockdowns served as disruptions in our autopilot, hustle mode. With much fewer distractions, we finally came face-to-face with who we are inside, what we find important in our lives, whether our illusion of success or happiness was still holding up to the reality of the moment.”\n\nPersonally, I've fallen in lust with a new mistress: self-care. I'm still figuring out what makes her tick but I've never been more sure of my path. I am no longer compromising my health to achieve goals, and my interest in hitting career milestones vanished overnight."
