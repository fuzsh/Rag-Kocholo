        "text": "Burial is a traditional form of interment which allows a family member to be remembered through placement of an individual plaque, headstone or monument. Council provides burials in lawn, lawn beam and monumental graves. A relative of a deceased may be buried in an existing grave with the consent of the burial rights holder. Most new graves can be dug to a depth that will accommodate three burials and several sets of ashes.\n\nMonumental or lawn grave\n\nWhen choosing a grave site, it is important to consider whether a monumental or lawn grave will be required. A monumental grave will be in a separate part of the cemetery where monuments are permitted to be erected. These traditional graves allow the most scope to remember your loved one in an individual way.\n\nA lawn grave it situated in a lawn section of a cemetery and is marked by a bronze, granite or marble headstone which is placed at the head of the grave. Lawn graves are the most popular form of burial in Moreton Bay Region.\n\nCouncil's cemeteries allow for ashes to be placed in a variety of columbarium walls, memorial gardens and other appropriate settings. Ashes are placed in cavities called a \"niche\".\n\nMost niches can hold only one ashes container; however, several cemeteries offer double (companion) niches, which can accommodate two containers. Ashes can also be placed in existing family graves with the consent of the burial rights holder.\n\nThere is the option of ashes scattering, this is done in a special area within the cemetery grounds which is designated for the scattering of ashes. Alternatively, ashes can be placed in existing family graves with the consent of the burial rights holder.\n\nColumbarium wall\n\nColumbarium walls allow for ashes to be placed into either single or companion niches. A bronze plaque is placed over the niche to seal the contents.\n\nGarden placement\n\nSeveral cemeteries contain memorial gardens for placement of ashes. A bronze plaque is attached to the garden edge or a stone marker.\n\nScattering of Ashes\n\nScattering provides an alternative option for the memorialisation of ashes. Ashes are scattered in a special area with the option of a small memorial plaque. Scattering of ashes is currently only available at the Redcliffe cemetery.\n\nApplication for placement of ashes and memorial plaque(PDF, 834KB)\n\nCemetery plaque for ashes placement fact sheet(PDF, 3MB)\n\nIn the weeks following a burial, Council will contact you to arrange for a plaque to be made. Council's plaques are manufactured from high quality bronze and are available in a range of colours. You are not able to have more than one plaque, however you can order a plaque with detachable plates that accommodates two or three people. Emblems and photographs may be added to commemorate your loved one in a touching and personal way.\n\nAfter the plaque is manufactured, Council will place the plaque on the gravesite.\n\nCemetery plaques for gravesite - Accessories and emblems fact sheet(PDF, 3MB)\n\nApplication for memorial plaque cast bronze(PDF, 829KB)\n\nExisting cast bronze plaques that look dull or faded can be refurbished. Council can arrange for the plaque to be sent away to be refurbished for a fee.\n\nRefurbishment of a memorial plaque (cast bronze) application form(PDF, 175KB)"
