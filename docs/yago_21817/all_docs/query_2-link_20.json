        "text": "This is a copy of a graduation speech, given by B. C. Speers’ at the Falls Branch, Tennessee High School, on March 27, 1908. Bernie Speers was the maternal grandfather of my husband Frank R. West, Jr. While this is not one of my memories, it a glimpse back into my husband’s family history. I implore you to read the words from 100 years and the insights of a young man, just beginning his life beyond the confines of his rural town.\n\nAMBITION\n\nB. C. SPEERS, FALL BRANCH, TENNESSEE, MARCH 27, 1908\n\nThere is a mighty force at work in the world today. It is responsible for the great changes and wonderful transformations that had been wrought by the hand of man. It began with Adam and with each succeeding generation it has actuated men to do whatever they have done. It has been the cause of great harm. It has been the cause of great good. Magnificent empires have been formed and in turn demolished by men who have listened to its mandates. We ask what is this mighty force and our answer is – ambition. Lincoln, Washington, Napoleon, Alexander, Caesar, Hannibal – these are names that stand out in the bold relief upon the pages of history. How did they attain and make sure their claim to everlasting fame? Were they ambitious? Yes, but where did they are ambition carry them? Shall we praise or condemn it?\n\nWe find that Alexander’s ambition led him as a thirsty dying traveler, is drawn across the scorching sands of the desert. He hurries his camel westward in pursuit of water. On and on he goes. Madness takes possession of him. He rushes on. He finds no water to quench his parching thirst. The fatal mirage has allured him from the right course. Death soon comes.\n\nThus, Alexander followed the alluring hopes of an inordinate desire for ruling. Macedonia, his native land, was at peace, no mighty enemy hovered near her borders threatening destruction. Yet raising vast armies, he began the work of conquest. His powerful scepter ruled classic Greece, mighty Persia, rich Asia Minor, and proud Egypt, but still his ambition led him on. He was pointing his scepter towards the fertile plains of India, where the mighty hand that wielded it was paralyzed by death and his great empire dissolved as if by magic.\n\nNapoleon, the unknown Corsican, began his career in the Army as a humble lieutenant, but in the short time he wore the uniform of a general. From victory to victory he led the armies of the French Republic. He lost no chance to increase his personal power, and in a few years, he sat upon the Bourbon Throne, Emperor of France. Still he was not satisfied. By war he won his crown. By war he meant to make every knee bow before the shrine of his martial glory. Little did he care for the heart aches of the French women as their fathers, brothers and sons were ordered to the battle. At his command, the flower of France faced the humming rifle ball, the sharp swords of the enemy and endured the exposure of that long, terrible retreat from Moscow. Thus were the French lives sacrificed on the altar of his ambition. By the might of his military genius he caused thrones to totter and fall and upon their ruins, he built a splendid empire. He followed his star of destiny with the blind and dauntless faith believing that it had not yet reached its zenith. Whereby a single blow from the hand of fate, his position on the throne of France was changed to that of a military prisoner on the lonely island of St. Helena.\n\nWe call Alexander and Napoleon great generals. So they were, but the greatness came at a frightful cost. Did they fight for the liberty of the people? No, the star which directed their course was an iron will and it led them on over the bodies and through the blood of the dying countrymen to the goal of their ambition.\n\nBeware the ambitious genius like that of Alexander and Napoleon. It is like fire. Skillfully used fire lights and heats the world; wrongfully managed it reduces the costly palace to charred ruins in the stately forest to worthless ashes.\n\nAmbition, guided by the hand of reason, strengthens the government and raises man intellectually and spiritually to the highest plane of life but if ruled over by self-willed it becomes a fatal mirage.\n\nOur Washington by his patriotism and self-denial has given liberty to 80 million people. We all know and love the story of the father of his country, and we have none but words of praise for the ambition he cherished. In the hearts of the people he still lives and will live as long as the spirit of liberty endures.\n\nWho were the most prominent men in the public eye today? Bryan, Folk, Taft, Roosevelt, Cannon, Root. Let these men lose sight of their ambition and their talents would atrophy and die. Their energy and enterprise will scatter the clouds that are now hovering over our political horizon and behind them American progress will shine as it has never shown before.\n\nThese are men who are trying to accomplish good. Theirs is no easy road to travel, and if we place our feet upon the highway of ambition, we will have to struggle and fight our way over every inch of the ground.\n\nIf is very easy to row down the stream of life in our little boat, but if our ambition calls us a station up the stream, then it is that power must be applied. The strong arm must man the oars. The helping hand of fortune may never favor us. We cannot count on that. Ambition must direct our course.\n\n(To Class) – Here to fore we have had the gentle guidance and loving council of our teachers. But the time has come where we will not have the advantages of their experiences when we will not be lifted over the stony places by the hand of parental care and affection. But as men, as women, we must plan and fight the battles alone. Then it is that avalanches of discouragement and huge boulders of opposition will threaten us. But as others have triumphed, so may we.\n\nWhat is it that has led the class of 1908 through all the years of their past school life? Why did they begin years ago and set their eyes toward the rising sun? Did that same mighty force which controlled Napoleon and Alexander lead them on? Yes, it was ambition, but of another kind. To go out, into the world as champions of right, of truth, of honor, to bear the burdens of the weak, to extend a helping hand to the oppressed, to scatter sunshine and gladness along our path, to do all the good we can in our humble way. That is the ambition of the class of 1908."
