        "text": "Throughout the character creation process, feel free to reference the corebook when necessary, but this text and the GM will specify where there has been a change in ruleset.\n\n1) Folk\n\nYour Character will be a Human, Dwarf, Halfling, Elf, Orc or Goblin. Other options are available as listed in the Encyclopedia in the Foreign Peoples table, who are not populous in the Westerlands and often treated with suspicion and ignorance. Alternatively, you can roll 1d100, consult the Random Table, and gain +20 XP if you accept the result. You may also wish to create a Mixed Folk, in which case you can select two of the listed folk as your character's parents. If you wish to use the Random Table, you may roll twice to determine who your characters' parents are. A Mixed Folk is eligible for Talents that require prerequisites from either parent folk.\n\n1d100 Folk 1-40 Human 41-66 Elf1 67-77 Dwarf 78-83 Orc 84-89 Goblin 90-95 Halfling 96-100 Foreign Peoples\n\n1 When generating an Elf character, make sure to specify whether your character is a Dark or High Elf. There are no statistical differences between the two ethnicities.\n\n1d100 Foreign Peoples 1-40 Raksaa 41-81 Coatl 81-96 Zori 97-99 Sepida 100 The Fallen\n\n2) Career\n\nYour Career describes your current job and determines your Status, which also influences how much money you earn. You can simply choose your Career from the options below, write them down on your Character Sheet and move on to step 3. Alternatively, if you are unsure which to choose, or just want to randomly select for bonus XP: 1. Roll 1d100 three times on the Random Career Table. If you don’t like the result, move to step 2. If you keep the result, gain +25 XP. Some careers may make sense for more characters than others, such as a Halfling Cavalryman or Goblin Priest. At the GM's discretion, you may disregard that roll. 2. Choose your Career, or keep rerolling on the table until you get something you like. There is no XP bonus for this. Some careers have been removed due to the unsuitability to AOA, others have merely been renamed. The Priest, Warrior Priest, and Wizard careers are significantly affected by the changes in magic from the corebook to AOA. Further modifications relative to Skills and Talents are specified later in the rules. At discretion, you may narrow down careers you rolled to more specific variants in the Winds of Magic and Up in Arms WFRP supplements. WIP Notice: I will eventually craft seperate career tables for each folk, as there would be some differences, but nothing so great as the corebook. Profession is determined less by your species and much more by your social strata and nation of origin.\n\n1d100 Career1Apothecary2Engineer4Nun5Lawyer6Physician7-11Priest12-13Scholar14-18Arcanist (Wizard)19Agitator20-21Artisan22-23Beggar24Investigator25Merchant26-27Townsman28Watchman29Advisor30Artist31Duelist32Envoy33Noble34-36Servant37Spy38Warden39Bailiff40Herbalist41-42Hunter43Miner44Scout45-49Villager50Bounty Hunter51Coachman52-53Entertainer54Zealot (Flagellant)55Messenger56Peddler57Road Warden58Inquisitor (Witch Hunter)59-60Boatman61Huffer62-63Riverwarden64-65Riverwoman66-68Seaman69Smuggler70-71Stevedore72Wrecker73-74Bawd75Charlatan76Fence77Grave Robber78-81Outlaw82Racketeer83-85Thief86-87Cavalryman88Protaganist89-90Guard91Knight92Pit Fighter93-99Soldier100Warrior Priest\n\n3) Attributes and Experience\n\nYour ten characteristics are used in Tests (Game Mechanics) to determine whether you have successfully performed an action. The average for these Attributes is 30. Those who are gifted, or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60. There are variations, of course, based on biological characteristics of various folk. If you created a Mixed Folk character, in any characteristics that are different, take the average between them and round down if necessary. When it comes to movement, take the lowest value of the two parents. Step 1) Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and make a note of the results. If you feel your Character would be improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results between Characteristics, move to the next step. If you stick with your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your Character Sheet and gain +50 XP. Step 2) Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier). If you’re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character Sheet and gain +25 XP. If not, move to the next step. Step 3) If you’re still not happy with your results, either roll again and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10 Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic. Add the modifiers from the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet. Like rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option. WIP Notice: Other than the small folk, most of the species are physically similar, and I have taken care to not have mental attributes vary too heavily. For the 'southerly' species, there will likely be greater differences.\n\nHuman Elf Dwarf Orc Goblin Halfling Weapon Skill 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+25 2d10+20 2d10+15 2d10+15 Ballistic Skill 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+25 2d10+20 2d10+20 Strength 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+10 2d10+10 Toughness 2d10+20 2d10+15 2d10+30 2d10+20 2d10+15 2d10+15 Initiative 2d10+20 2d10+25 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+30 2d10+20 Agility 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 Dexterity 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+15 2d10+30 2d10+30 Intelligence 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 Willpower 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+30 Fellowship 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 2d10+20 Wounds SB+(2 × TB)+WPB SB+(2 × TB)+WPB SB+(2 × TB)+WPB SB+(2 × TB)+WPB SB+(2 × TB)+WPB SB+(2 × TB)+WPB Movement 4 4 3 4 3 3\n\nTurn to your career in Chapter 3: Class and Careers of the corebook. Look to the Advance Scheme and find the three Characteristics marked without a brass, silver, or gold background. You can allocate a total of 5 Advances across these Characteristics as you choose, and mark them in the Advances box on your Character Sheet\n\n4) Age\n\nYour character is significantly affected by how much life experience they have already gone through. How much luck seems to shine upon them, how much damage they can withstand, how much strength they can summon, and how much they've learned over the years all plays a role.\n\nAge Fate Resiliance Extra Points Adjustment Young Adult 2 1 3 None Adult 1 2 2 None Middle Adulthood 1 1 2 +25 Experience, -5 Toughness OR Strength Older Adulthood 0 1 1 +25 Experience, -5 Toughness and Strength OR Initiative Dotage 0 0 1 +50 Experience, -10 Toughness, Strength, and Initiative\n\n5) Starting Skills and Talents\n\nYou may choose 3 Skills to gain 5 Advances each, and 3 Skills to gain 3 Advances each. If a Talent listing presents a choice, you select one Talent from the choices given. Any Random Talents are determined by the Random Talent table. If you roll a Talent you already have, you may reroll. Note: All Characters are assumed to be fluent in Trade Tongue, the lingua franca of much of the Westerlands' merchants, travelers, and tradesmen, and do not need to take it as a Skill. All characters may choose an Innate Talent, which corresponds to some inextricable part of their background. Skills: Animal Care, Charm, Cool, Evaluate, Gossip, Haggle, Language (Native Tongue), Language (Any), Leadership, Lore (Homeland), Melee (Basic), Ranged (Bow) Talents: Innate Talent, Savvy or Suave, 3 Random Talents WIP Notice: I will be revisiting skill and talent allocation with each (or most at least) folk.\n\n1d100 Talent1-3Acute Sense (any one)4-6Ambidextrous7-9Animal Affinity10-12Artistic13-15Attractive16-18Coolheaded19-21Craftsman (any one)22-24Flee!25-28Hardy29-31Lightning Reflexes32-34Linguistics35-38Luck39-41Marksman42-44Mimic45-47Night Vision48-50Nimble Fingered51-52Noble Blood53-55Orientation56-58Perfect Pitch59-65Read/Write66-68Resistance (any one)69-71Savvy72-74Sharp75-78Sixth Sense79-81Strong Legs82-84Sturdy85-87Suave88-91Super Numerate92-94Very Resilient95-97Very Strong98-100Warrior Born\n\nNow turn to your career in Chapter 3: Class and Careers of the corebook. You begin at the first Career level listed in your Career Path. There are 8 Skills and 4 Talents listed with that level, and you can choose which of these you are most proficient at. Allocate 40 Advances to your eight starting Skills, with no more than 10 Advances allocated to any single Skill at this stage. This is enough for you to add 5 Advances to every Career Skill if you wish, which is one of the required steps to complete your Career if you wish to move to a new one (see Changing Career on page 48). You may also choose a single Talent to learn.\n\n6) Trappings\n\nAcademics: Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing Writing Kit and 1d10 sheets of Parchment Burghers: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Hat, Pouch, Sling Bag containing Lunch Courtiers: Dagger, Fine Clothing, Pouch containing Tweezers, Ear Pick, and a Comb Peasants: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing Rations (1 day) Rangers: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Backpack containing Tinderbox, Blanket, Rations (1 day) Riverfolk: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing a Flask of Spirits Rogues: Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing 2 Candles, 1d10 Matches, a Hood or Mask Warriors: Clothing, Hand Weapon, Dagger, Pouch\n\nStatus Tier Starting Wealth Brass 2d10 brass pennies per Status Level Silver 1d10 silver shillings per Status Level Gold 1 Gold crown per Status Level\n\n7) Ambitions\n\nAmbitions are a Character’s goals in life – what they want to achieve. All characters have both a Short-Term and Long-Term Ambition. Short-term Ambitions represent your immediate goals. They are outcomes you wish to achieve within days and weeks, possibly sooner. Under normal circumstances, a short-term Ambition should take at least two or three sessions to complete. Example short-term Ambitions include: • Ruining the reputation of a romantic rival. • Avenging a fallen comrade. • Befriending a reclusive scholar. Long-term Ambitions are goals you will need to work on for months or years to complete, and may never be achieved at all, perhaps taken more as a description of a primary motivation in your life than a realistic outcome. Examples of long-term Ambitions include: • Owning your own coaching inn. • Building your village into a thriving town. • Ridding your land of all heresies but your one true faith. You may want to keep your Ambitions secret from other players in your party, especially if they are controversial or clandestine. Achieving Your Ambitions If you achieve your short-term Ambition, you will receive a bonus of +50 XP, and can choose a new short-term Ambition at the end of the session. If you achieve your long-term Ambition, you may either: • Receive a bonus of +500 XP and choose a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session. • Retire your Character and gain a bonus of half your earned XP of your current character to spend on your next character. Retired Characters will generally stay in place to take advantage of their achieved ambition. You can build them into the background of your new Character, so that they may continue to help you. If you want to reactivate a retired Character, talk to your GM about how best to bring that into the current story. Retiring Characters allows you to build a network across the world, and can be a great source of adventure leads. All players in your group should also discuss what your collective goals are, and then choose a short-term and long-term party Ambition. Much like your personal Ambitions, party Ambitions can be changed between sessions. Short-term party Ambitions have the same scope as your personal short-term Ambitions but are for the whole group. Your personal Ambitions should never be the same as your party Ambitions, but there is no reason they can’t complement each other. Examples of short-term party Ambitions include: • Outwitting a rival group, securing a job at their loss. • Hunting down the killer of a lost party member. • Impressing your patron by completely succeeding in an appointed task. Much like short-term party Ambitions, long-term Party Ambitions work like your personal Ambitions, and can be just as wide in scope, but are for your entire group. Examples of long-term Party Ambitions include: • Eradicate an nation-wide cult. • Build a castle. • Become heroes to your people, each rewarded by your ruler, head of faith (or god, even) and remembered in the history books as a larger than life figure. If your party achieves its short-term Ambition, each member receives +50 XP, and you can all select a new Ambition for the party at the end of the session. If your party achieves its long-term Party Ambition: • All players receive a bonus of +500 XP, and the party chooses a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session. • As many players as wish to do so can retire their Characters — who become NPCs under the GM’s control; those who do gain a bonus of half the XP of their current Character to spend on their next Character."
