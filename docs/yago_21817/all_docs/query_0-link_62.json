But there are a few hints along the way about the meaning of President Nixon's decision to name James R. Schlesinger Ct di- rector and make the present director, Richard Helms. ambassador to Iran. President Nixon has not been satisfied with the performance of the U.S. \"in- telligence Community.\" In late 1969 lie cut CIA personnel abroad by to to 1S per cent.

It. recommended pulling intelligence to- gether either by giving CIA Director Helms more authority over the five oth- er U.S. agencies beside the CIA that gather intelligence, or by setting up a new cabinet-level Department of In- Atomic Energy Conunission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Now the President pulls Helms out and puts in one of the authors of the report - Schlesinger. One complaint that the President is said to have against the CIA under helms is that the CIA often has been realistic about Vietnam. For example, the CIA didn't think bombing North Vietnam `would be effective, or that it was effective after it started. Ousting Helms for being right is wrong. On the other hand. Senator J. William Fulbright's Foreign Relations Com- mittee has been hassling the CIA for its private wars in Laos and Cambodia, which either violate U.S. law or come close to it.

Last of a series How will a potential Vietnam ceasefire affect Cambodia? Contrary to statements by the U.S.-sponsored Phnom Penh administration about peace talks with the \"Khmer Rouge,\" the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has denied that there have been any discussions between the resistance .forces,and the puppet regime. Although the government of National Union has given its full support to the nine-point peace agreement for Vietnam, after it was announced by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Cambodian resistance is determined to fight until the ' U.S.-sponsored Lon Nol regime is over- thrown. Recent Western press reports imply that this may well be within, the capacity of the resistance forces within the foreseeable future. The position of the National Union govern- ment in no way conflicts with the position of its Indochinese allies, which would be able to furnish greater assistance to the Cambodian resistance if there were a cease-fire in Vietnam and the U.S. persisted in prolonging the war in Cambodia. In the short run, the U.S. could bolster the Phnom Penh regime for a time, but the days of its Cambodian clients appear to be numbered, despite the approximately $350 million in military aid annually being sent to Phnom Penh, the clandestine presence of U.S. military advisors and continued heavy U.S. air attacks against the patriotic forces. Rapid growth Two-and-one-half years after the U.S.- promoted coup ousting Sihanouk in Phnom Penh, the resistance forces in Cambodia are growing more rapidly than ever, controlling 85 percent of the national territory, according to an Oct. 23 report by A.P. correspondent Holger Jensen who also wrote: \"Khmer Rouge (the name used by the Western press for the Cambodian resistance forces) strength has jumped from little more than 5000 in March to about 40,000 combat-honed troops... . \"U.S. officials . . . concede they 'drastically underestimated' the Khmer Rouge, which means Cambodian Reds. \" 'They grew more, rapidly than anyone realized or reported; it's as simple as that,' said one high-ranking American here. 'They're not dependent on the North Vietnamese any more. The Khmer Rouge are actively engaged in combat against Cambodian government forces and they're making a maximum effort.\" This assessment was corroborated by the Far Eastern Economic Review's Phnom Penh correspondent Nayan Chandra, who wrote in the to open Highway 6 and lift the siege of Kompong Thom, the Cambodian army has not recovered its morale. 'Chenla 11, has been as decisive for Cambodia,' estimates one diplomat, 'as Stalingrad was to the Germans.' Not only was there heavy loss of men and material, but the credibility of Lon Nol as a strategist and leader suffered a grievous setback. Since then the army has launched a few half- hearted operations, with claims of initial victories followed by disastrous defeats. \"Taking full advantage of the political demoralization and popular malaise (toward the Lon ' Nol regime), pro-Sihanouk forces have considerably strengthened their position. One knowledgeable observer says looting by South Vietnam (Saigon) and Cambodian troops, plus American bombing, has given the Khmer Rouge an audience that did not exist a year ago.\" While the American bombing continues to devastate the liberated zone, Saigon troops are no longer in a position to be sent in significant numbers to Cambodia, as the Nguyen Van Thieu regime needs every soldier available to him to meet the continuing offensive by the Liberation Armed Forces of the PRG. In reply to questions posed by a correspon- dent, Sihanouk explained on Oct. 29 that- the Cambodian resistance forces \"sometimes have combined operations with our North Vietnamese;. and NLF friends along the Cambodian- Vietnamese common border, but our armed forces, alone, have responsibility for all military operations in the interior of Cambodia. We give the troops of our north Vietnamese and NLF friends the right to cross our national territory but these friendly Vietnamese troops do not possess any permanent base in the interior of the country. The question of their evacuation from Cambodia is not an issue and will never be an issue.\" In answer to another question during the same interview Sihanouk noted that \"the only route between Peking and the liberated zone of Cambodia is- the Ho Chi Minh trail\" on which travel would be much easier if there were cease- fires in Vietnam and Laos. Although the Cam- bodian leader was referring to the possibility of returning to his homeland, the military im- plications are quite clear and must be discon- certing to the Nixon administration which once called U.S.-supported operations in Cambodia the best example of the \"Nixon doctrine\" in- action. , The realities of the Nixon doctrine in Cam- bodia are quite different than Washington. originally envisaged when the CIA promoted the coup by Lon Nol and Sirak Matak, now bitter rivals, like most other \"leaders\" of Phnom Penh's pro-American camp.

Route 5 going to the rice-rich Battambang -province have been held by liberation forces since August, which cut off the capital city from its main source of rice. Since September there have been periodic \"riots\" over rice shortages in which troops of the Lon Not army have par- ticipated. Apparently a large segment of U.S. aid goes into the pockets of corrupt officials and military officers. Interviewing some soldiers early in November, Times correspondent Schanberg noted that they were lucky to be receiving their pay, for \"corruption has permeated the Cam- bodian army ever since the U.S. began pumping . military aid into the country. \"Many commanders keel) dead men on their unit payrolls and put the dead men's pay into their own pockets. Other commanders even keep the pay of their own troops, which leaves the troops penri,iless and demoralized and results in their looting and pillaging the nearest village for food and other wants.\" Selling rope for their own noose On the point of the regime's total corruption, all Western observers in Phnom Penh agree. Lon Not's personal doctor who was appointed minister of commerce earlier this year had to quit after a scandal\" involving sales of rice to the patriots. _ Although most of Lon Nol's military forces are demoralized and unreliable and there is not the. slightest prospect of broadening the base of the puppet regime, the U.S. has accelerated its arms shipments to Phnom Penh in recent weeks, which raises several questions, including the probable violation of congressional limitations on U.S. aid to Cambodia and the presence of U.S. advisors, also prohibited by congressional enactments. It is also conceivable that at least some of the military equipment, especially aircraft, is destined not for Lon. Nol's forces but for America and other clandestine U.S. operations which are burgeoning throughout Indochina. It is understandable that Sihanouk does not desire to negotiate with the traitors who serve the U.S. imperialists, as they represent nothing in tite country, so.the probability is continued conflict in Cambodia as long as the U.S. seeks to maintain its Phnom Penh retainers. The Vietnamese liberation forces have expressed full support for the refusal of the Royal Cambodian Government of National Union to negotiate with the puppet regime.

P ElF 'Ef Mr. Pfei/3er is professor of zoology at the University of Montana and a co-author of Harvest of Death: Chemical Warfare in Indochina (Free Press/Macmillan). Ile visited Cambodia in 1969.and 1971 and was in Hanoi in 1970, While on a visit to Hanoi in June 1970 my two compan- ions and I met with Premier Pham Van Dong. During the conversation, I asked the Premier to evaluate Nixon's in- vasion of Cambodia which had occurred one month ear- lier. His ,answer was straightforward: \"It makes things very favorable for the success of our revolution.\" By \"our revolution\" I suppgsed him to mean the revolution of the Indochinese people against foreign invaders. How well does Premier Pham Van bong's 1970 evalu- ation accord with the situation of Cambodia in late 1972? Recent dispatches from Indochina suggest that he knew what lie was talking about. According to the A.P. (Sep- tember 1), only one-third of Cambodia is still under \"Khmer Republic\" control. It has been revealed that the tanks used in the fall offensive against the An Loc area, (only a short distance from Saigon) came from the Chup Rubber Plantation and nearby areas in Cambodia. These are the very areas that President Nixon characterized in April 1970 as \"Communist sanctuaries\" that must be cleaned out. Two factors have been principally responsible for the failure of Ni}.on's Cambodian policies. First, the Presi- dent was badly misinformed about past U.S.-Cambodian d b t the situation on the Vict- I received some months later from Sen.Frank' Church, the raid was carried out by Air America, a CIA airline, for what purposes we still do not know. After the raid, the Sihanouk regime asked that American officials visit the region, with a view to making reparations for the 'damage. Although the U.S. Government to this day offi- cially denies having carried out this operation, it did send a team of experts, including Charles Minarik of the Chem- ical Warfare Laboratories, U.S. Army, into the Mimot region shortly after the raids. This team's report describes how they were flown over the region, driven through it, and how they walked in it-just as Westing and I did some months later. It is inconceivable to me that the North Vietnamese and Vietcong, who according to Nixon controlled the area, would have permitted an official U.S. Government team to wander through what Nixon called \"the headquarters for the entire Communist military op- erations in South Vietnam.\" After the invasion began it was widely reported that no key control center could be found. Some arms caches were reportedly uncovered and, of course, a great deal of rice. The rice did not greatly surprise me, since at the time we were there, the main occupation; in addition to tapping rubber, was liar- vesting rice. When speaking about the Cambodian \"Communist sanctuaries,\" Mr. Nixon failed to mention that, on orders of Prince Sihanouk, troops of the Royal. Cambodian Anny had in fact swept these areas about three months before his invasion. The troops were led by Prince, Sirik Matak, a loyal American protege and one of those later involved in Sihanouk's overthrow. Sihanouk ordered Vietnamese relations an . a ou nainese-Cambodian border prior to the March 1970 Matak to search out and destroy all Cominunist-Viet- change in the Cambodian Government. For instance, in namese positions in Cambodia.

N stated: \"Tonight American and South Vietnamese units will attack the headquarters for the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam. This key control center has been occupied by the North Vietnamese and Vietcong for five years in blatant violation of Can_bodia's neutrality.\" Mr. Nixon, standing in front of a map of Cambodia, put his finger on the little town of Mimot as he made this accusation. That puzzled me a great deal, for I had spent two days in and around Mimot about four months before the U.S.' attack, and knew it to be controlled by French and Cambodian rubber interests. Mahy Europeans were working there, and some of them (e.g., a Belgian plant pathologist) were in complete sympathy with the American effort in South Vietnam. These Europeans were living with their wives and chil- dren in an environment of complete tranquillity. We asked many of them whether they had seen any sign of North Vietnamese or Vietcong activity and they all answered no. My colleague A. H. Westing and I had visited the re- rmy opera- o an A Cam interview, March 22, 1971: tion began in January of 1970 in a northeastern province at approximately the time when Sihanouk left for France and when Prince Sirik Matak was Acting Prime Minister. They sent up a number of additional battalions, among the better troops in the Cambodian Army, and carried out a series of small sweeps generally in this area. They did have, as I recall, a number of contacts with small V.C. and North Vietnamese units. They found and de- stroyed a number of small supply dumps, a relatively small campsite, but there was no major contact with the main North Vietnamese forces.\" Where were the thou- sands of North Vietnamese troops that Nixon said had occupied the area for five years? Besides being mistaken about the nature of the so-called Communist sanctuaries in eastern Cambodia, Mr. Nixon grossly misrepresented the facts when he stated that \"American policy since 1954 has been to scrupulously respect the neutrality of Cambodia. . . .

Now they feared Mr. Nixon would listen to Thicu's ap- peals for renewed U.S. inter- vention In the Vietnam war, As evidence, they cited the buildup of U.S. forces in neighborhing Thailand and the increase in air-naval units around Vietnam. The Communist diplomats said they trusted McGovern, if he should be elected, not to re-intervene in the war. But one diplomat suggested that they would make rapid ar- rangements with McGovern to return American prisoners so he would have no excuse to re-intervene. They, therefore, not only would negotiate the POW issue with McGovern, but they would move. fast, suggested one North Vietnamese diplo- mat, to return American pris- oners. But the North Vietnamese conceded, in the end, they probably will have to negoti- ate with a re-elected Richard Nixon. They couldn't afford, therefore, to place all their bets on McGovern, they said. Hanoi's views on the elec- tion were delivered to us by an emissary who met with the North Vietnamese three times for a total of four and. one-half hours.

They said the Americans held in Cambodia could also be re- turned as part of a general In- dochina settlement. A Cambodian Communist, who was present during the discussions, said the American prisoners in Cambodia are sus- pected CIA agents and specia forces, not combat troops cap- tured during the U.S. incur- sion of May, 1970. The North Vietnamese were particularly emotional over the alleged American bombing of the dikes, which they pleaded could lead to two mil- lion deaths from drowning and starvation. We have seen secret Penta- gon documents, which substan- tiate the U.S. claim that the Red River dikes and dams are Some roads also.run directly on top of dikes,, and U.S. at- tacks on the military traffic have blown holes in the dikes, they said.

E. Colby, executive director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who re- butted the charges made by some American newspa- permen that the CIA was involved in opium traf- ficking. I do not question Colby's good faith, neither do I say that the CIA, as an entity, traffics in opium; but, I am sorry to say that there is more to these charges than more \"gossip, conjecture and,, old history.\" I also know what I am talking about because'I was involved in security matters for the South Vietnamese government under President Ngo Dinh Diem. In effect, one day, the President told me to investigate into the activities of our chief of secret police, chief of our own \"CIA\" and chief of military security, and to report, di- rectly to him, because as he put it: \"I cannot ask my own chiefs of police, `CIA,' and military security to investigate into themselves.\" I found out the corruption of two. chiefs, ? and the President took very drastic measures against them. I have kept the contact with my security agents ever since. They firmly confirm that a few CIA agents in Indochina are involved in opium trafficking. But above all, a line must be drawn between Indochina and the rest of the world, because, due to the fact of the coun- ter-instu'gency warfare, the operations of the American CIA in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are extremely ira- portant, when they are compared to operations of the same agency in other countries. In Indochina, the CIA is a real army with his own aerial fleet. A number of CIA operatives deal directly with Vietnamese, Lao, or Moo warlords or officials at the highest level with whom they share the proceeds of the opium traffic. For good American citizens in the United States, it is very difficult to imagine the influence and power of those operatives in Indochina, Their power, in fact., is un- limited-they are the true rulers of Indochina; their desires are orders-no Vietnamese, Laotian or Cambo- i dian official would dare resist their orders. Corruption growing from a do facto power-affects some of these CIA operatives. The traffic of opium involves a rely t.ively large num- her of persons.

Since these personis have their clans, families and friends who live from this traffic, the total number of persons con- cerned become so great that it is impossible to keep secret the operations. I also do not question the good faith of CIA Director Richard Helms when he said that \"os an agency, in fact, we are heavily engaged in tracing the foreign roots of the drug traffic for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. We hope we are helping with a solution; we know we are not contributing to the prob- lem ... -\" However, as I said previously, a line must be drawn and a distinction must he made; for circum- stances are not the same-there is not the vaguest re- semblance between CIA operatives in Indochina and their colleagues operating in other countries. In conclusion, CIA Director Helms and Colby, Miss Randal, and McCoy said the truth and did not contra-. diet one another; they perhaps did not talk about the same country.

BY DONALD KIRK Far Eastern Correspondent Chicago Tribune pass Service PHNOM PENH, Cambodia- In the demoralized atmosphere of this war-weary capital, one of the country's highest lead- ers still maintains a sem- blance of unabashed confi- dence in the face of the worst enemy threats. He is Son Ngoc Thanh, a revolutionary figure from Cambodia's French colonial ast and now prime minister der the ailing President Lon Nol. . . \"We are determined to push out the enemy,\" said Thanh, a peppery, slightly built man, \"We are now establishing a true Khmer or Cambodian re- public,\" said Thanh, who last served as prime minister at the end of the Japanese occu- pation in 1945, \"Now there are no more quarrels. The people can decide whom they want to lead them.\" Vote Fraud Charged Thanh's faith in Cambodia's fledgling efforts toward de- 0 0 mocracy remains unshaken by a presidential election last month in which Lon Nol easily steamrollcd over two oppo- actually have instigated his ouster. Thanh preferred not to dis- cuss the CIA's role in the sud- I/ den turn of events in Phnom Penh. Instead, he noted the build-up of the Ca m b o d i a n army over the last two years. \"At the beginning we had only 30,000 men in Cambodia and another 20,000 of my men,\" he said. \"Now we have at least 170,000. We have a broad army now.\" He admitted that the quality of his own forces, the best in pressure and fraud. I tie '?,,pave declined since they were p bases near the fronr.

Critics charge that Lon Nol will manipulate the assembly election just as he is accused of doing in the ballot- ing for president-and that, in any c a s e , the constitution grants little real power to the assembly. For Thanh, however, almost any alternative seems prefera- ble to the rule of Sihanouk, his most bitter foe since World War II. The rivalry between Thanh and Sihanouk dates to the Japanese decision to ele- vate,Thanh to national leader- ship during the war while Si- hanouk remained only a fig- urehead'with little power. French Dump Thanh The French colonialists, re- turning after the war, prompt- ly dumped Thanh, who then alternately fought and recon- ciled with Sihanouk. Finally, in the 1950s, Thanh organized a guerrilla force that fought against Sihanouk until fleeing to Thailand and South Viet Nam. It was from Viet Nam, thru- out the decade before Siha- nouk's downfall, that Thanh \"We had our troops along the , border before Sihanouk was overthrown,\" said '? nanh. ,,He knew he would fall. I had had contact in advance withi Lon Nol and Lon Nol's young- er brother, Col.

The actual number of voters was nowhere stated, only percentages were giv- en,and this is not surprising. Marshal Lon Nol's army cannot go anywhere outside capital city of Phnom Penh without being at- tacked by the patriotic forces of the Cambodian National United Front. NUF units are able to operate within a few miles of the center of Phnom Penh without any hin- drance. A? conservative estimate would place NUF control of the country at around 80 percent. In fact, while the votes were being counted Monday, the NUF shelled the Defense Ministry building in downtown Phnom Penh, some.of the shells landing only 50 yards from Lon Nol's residence. hard to see how Lon Not could claim to have held elections at all.

But this inust have disturbed his U.S. advisers, who have an eye out for U.S. public opinion, so in March, Lon Nol simply declared himself the President of Cambodia and an- nounced there would be a presi- dential election soon. Interestingly enough, Lon Nol is supposed to have gotten 60.76 per- cent of the vote, a figure that was \"predicted\" down to the last deci- mal point by his regime's official newspaper, Le Republicain.

The CIA had established what it called the Khmer Serei (\"Free Cambodian\") movement, made up entirely of Khmer Kroln who were carrying out armed raids into Cambodia from South Viet- nam. Son Ngoc Thanh was in- stalled as the head of this \"move- ment.\" In the past, LonNol was always able to call in heavy U.S. air sup- port plus invasions of his own country by thousands of Saigon puppet troops when things' got really rough for him. Today, things are different. The patriotic offensive in South Vietnam made the Saigon regime pull all its troops out of Cambodia. Lon Nol is thus left on his own.

By RICHARD A. FINEBERG Copyright 1979 Dispatch News Service Interuatioval WASHINGTON.-The Cen- tral Intelligence Agency (CIA) played a crucial role in en- couraging the coup that top- pled Prince Norodom Sihan-. ouk and plunged Cambodia into the Indochina war, ac- cording to Cambodia's re- ently named prime. minister, Son Ngoc Thanh. vv Describing Sihanouk's over- throw in a series of interviews last year with Oxford Univer- . sit}?- scholar T. D. Allman, Thanh said that CIA agents promised they would do \"ev= .erything possible\" to help if the Cambodian plotters suc- ,cessfully mounted a coup and .then-found themselves under attack by pro-Sihanouk and Communist forces. Shortly after the March 1970 coup, Thanh's own forces, trained by U. S. Special Forces in Vietnam, were dis- patched by plane to Phnom Penh, where they played a vital role in defending the Cambodian capital for Gen. Lon Nol. THE WHITE HOUSE main- tains that ? the U. S. had no prior knowledge of the coup and that \"no American mili- tary or civilian officers\" were ever involved officially or un- officially with the plotters. Si-' hanouk's ouster \"surprised no nation more than the United States,\" President Nixon said after the coup. Sen. Mike Gravel (D., Alaska) said on Tuesday that White House denials of U.

Lon Nol. At that time, Lon Nol was Sihanouk's prime minister, while Thanh, who had been sentenced to death by Sihan- ouk,. headed a rebel sect known as the Khmer Screi (\"Free Cambodia\") from a jungle post near the Viet- narn- Cambodia border. According to Thanh, begin- ning in 1965 the U. S. paid \"millions of dollars\" to train, arm and support his forces, most of whom were recruited from the Cambodian minority living in South Vietnam's Delta region. - Thanh told Allman, who was 1969 and may have been part of Thanh's invasion plan to overthrow Sihanouk.

U.S. intervention from the late 1950s has drawn North Vietnam in- creasingly into Laotian affairs, much as in South Vietnam and more recently Cambodia, where the March 1970 coup, very likely with a CIA hand, and the US-ARVN invasion that followed, shattered a fragile though conceivably stable neutralism and increased the probability that Cambodia too will be brought ultimately into a communist- led federation of. some sort if outside force is withdrawn. For reasons that need not detain us here, the United States has never been willing to tolerate the \"loss\" of Indo- china, and remains unwilling today. The conditions of U.S. intervention have changed over the years, but not the essential goals. Furthermore, the basic problem facing the Western in- vaders has also changed little during the past quarter century. Several years ago, an American military spokesman formulated the problem clearly: the U.S. has enormous military force but littl.: political power and must defeat an adversary with enormous political power but only modest military force. To this problem the U.S. must find the \"proper response\"-in Vietnam and elsewhere in the third world as well. (Jean Lacouture, Vietnam: Between Two Truces, 1966). This problem dictates American strategy. The basic strategy has been, necessarily,?to demolish the social and Approved For Release long tolerate the costs of a continuing military occupation in South Vietnam, coupled with a costly air war against the North. Consequently, the direct U.S. troop commitment was leveled off and then gradually lowered through \"Vietnamization\"-a policy suggested by Pentagon systems analysts in 1967 -while a sharply expanded techno- logical war reached its peak in the early months of the Nixon Administration. Nixon and Kissinger are gambling that the massive destruction and forced population concentration in the South, with its devastating impact on the rural society, may create conditions under which the U.S.-imposed regime can survive. To use Robert Komer's terms, \"thanks to massive U.S. military in- tervention at horrendous cost,\" a \"fa- vorable military environment\" has been created \"in which the largely political competition for control and support of the key rural population could begin again\" in this \"revolutionary, largely political conflict\" (!. of International A(jairs, 1971, no. 1). He fails to add that control of the \"key rural popu- lation\" may be facilitated by the fact that at least half the population, 85 percent rural in 1960, now lives in urban ghettoes (J-C Pomonti, Foreign Affairs, Jan. 1972), part of the \"hor- rendous cost\" of \"massive U.S. mil- itary intervention.\" Much the same is military and police apparatus, an'd gradually absorbed within the U.S.- Japan Pacific system. The vast areas ceded to ' the resistance will be sub- jected to intensive bombardment which will continue to make an organized so- cial life virtually impossible. Parts of Laos may be effectively incorporated within Thailand, as George Ball sug- gested years ago. It may be that the willingness of the Administration to concede the presence of Thai mer- STATINTL cenaries in Laos (in conflict with ex- plicit legislation designed to prevent this) reflects the need to prepare the public for this outcome. As the very knowledgeable Austra- lian analyst Peter King observes; such \"successes\" as have been achieved in this program are \"no mystery\": \"It re- quires more than ordinary courage for civilians to maintain their political al- legiances openly in the face of a semi- genocidal counter-insurgent strategy\" (Pacific Affairs, Fall 1971), the pre- requisite for Komer-style \"nation- building.\" It is this counter-insurgent strategy and its results that lead Gen- eral Westmoreland to believe: \"I think particularly significant is that the en- emy does not have the strong infra- structure and the guerrilla forces in large numbers, well equipped and high- ly motivated, that he had in 1963\" (Peter Osnos, Washington Post-Bos- ton Globe, Feb. 1, 1972). However, as King and many others recognize, \"the durability of that success may be doubted.\" Given the insistence of the U.S. pub- lic on scaling down the direct Amer- ican involvement, it has been obvious for several years that it would become necessary for the U.S. to engage in some sort of political manipulations within the areas'of South Vietnam that remain tinder U.S. control, or to \"get ready for political competition in South Vietnam,\" as Harvard Professor Sam- uel Huntington put it in a paper be- fore the May 1969 meeting of the Council on Vietnamese Studies of SEA- This collection of scholars, who DAG . true in Laos and Cambodia.

The U.S. Embassy hopes that some way can be found to bring Matak back, per- haps as an unofficial ad- viser. For the moment that looks unlikely.

The selection of the new government has not ended the student strike, which is desultory in the late-;March heat but completely effec- tive. Nor has it stopped the dispute between two of Cambodia's most important monks over the right to crit- icize the government. One of the monks, Khiew Chum, has a long record of opposing the monarchy.

There is no evidence that a significant number of the students of Khiew Chum and his followers are leftists or that their outspoken op- position could trigger large demonstrations.

TIMl,1R 2 9 't9 E & S - 135,812 Is Son Ngoc Thanh our next albatross?, Most Americans pay little at- tention to changes of government in small and volatile nations like Cam- bodia. Political leaders come and go, and it is difficult to remember their names. The name of Son Ngoc Thanh is worth remembering. He would appear to be, at the moment, the real power in Cam- bodia. He has been for more than two generations a leader of the na- tionalist movement in Cambodia. But he has also been, for the last twenty years or more, in nearly con- stant opposition to the now-exiled Prince Sihanouk, and his opposition has in recent years been heavily financed by the American Central Intelligence A. In a very real sense, the CIA's man is now in power in Phnom Penh. His arch-enemy - and still the most popular, beloved, and nearly-deified Cambodian, Norodom Sihanouk - is in exile in Peking. That Js hardly a recipe for stability. a politician nearly as popular at times, as Sihanouk himself. Son was exiled; recalled briefly; exiled again. He has since the early 1950s organized several nationalist, anti-Sihanouk guerrilla organiza-, tions, backed variously by Saigon and Bangkok (both historic an- tagonists of Cambodia) and the CIA. Ile comes to power in Phnom Penh now by a curious route. Lon Nol, the general who drove Sihanouk into exile, this month abrogated all semblance of democratic process in Cambodia: He cancelled the nearly-completed draf- ting of a new constitution, declared himself president, ousted the titular \"chief of state\" and assumed that role as well; and surrounded himself by a \"cabinet\" of Army men loyal to him, with only one token member of the democratic opposition. From a man who has suffered a crippling stroke, who apparently can- not walk without support, and who has never in several previous stints as head of government been con- sidered anything but -a figurehead, it was a remarkable show of decisiveness - remarkable enough to make one wonder who was behind it. He then named Son Ngoc Thanh -as premier and prime minister. AMERICAN POLICY in Indochin ,, has, on previous occasions, single out nationalist leaders whom we coul trust, and helped to install them in power, Ngo Dinh Diem was only the first of many such men in Vietnam. It is, at best, a risky business. Today's American-sponsored national hero can be tomorrow's albatross. SUPPORT FOR Son Ngoc Thanh is not unreasonable. He began his career as a crusading anti-colonial editor (in Cambodia's first newspaper in the Cambodian. language) in 1937.

Lon Rol Aide Accepts Post PHNOM PENH (UPI) - Elder statesman Son Ngoc Thanh, senior adviser to presi- dent Lon Nol, said yesterday that he had agreed to accept the post of prime minister, ending Cambodia's govern- mental crisis. Son Ngoc Thanh served as prime minister during the Jap- anese occupation . in World War H. He is known to hve kept in close contact with U.S. officials in recent years, and was repeatedly accused by deposed chief of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk of being an agent for the U.S. Central In- came as the regime was cele- brating the second anniversa- ry of the overthrow of Sihan- ouk, who has set up a govern- ment-in-exile in Peking. Cambodia has been without .a government for four days, during which five other candi- dates for prime minister re- portedly have turned down of- fers of the post, Thanh told reporters he had \"imposed no conditions, but s coun- only wanted to ser74 try.\" He said his job would be that of \"coordinator\" of the council of ministers, all of whom would be chosen and headed by Lon Nol. He also said there would be an executive council and a se- curity council in the new gov- ernment, but added that \"as yet no decision has been made on filling the post of vice presi- dent.\" Thanh's acceptance was re- portedly welcomed by Phnom Penh's protesting students, whose main target was former Prime. Minister-Delegate Siso- wath Sirik Matak. He is ap- parently now completely out of top positions in the govern- ment after acting as Lon Nol's right-hand man in the first two years of the war.

The Week of Solidarity. being held this week is to include dem- onstrations, meetings, rallies and campaigns protesting the contin- uation of the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, Laos and Cam- bodia and demanding the with- drawal of U.S. and allied forces. . Meanwhile a massive drive to annihilate the Khmer Rouge, or Cambodian patriotic forces, en- tered its fourth day, with more than 50,000 Saigon puppet troops supported by U.S. aerial and ar- tillery forces conducting a \"search - and destroy\" operation in Cambodia. Puppet regime near collapse The puppet Saigon trbops were ordered into Cambodia as a po- litical crisis threatened to topple the puppet government in that country headed by Prime Min- ister delegate Gen. Sisowath Sirik Matak, a. compradore cap-. italist and arch conspirator against the Cambodian people. The gavernmental crisis came to a head Friday when the inval- ided Lon Nol, crippled by a stroke, took over from Cheng Heng as chief of state and dis- solved the National Assembly. Lon Nol, who had seized pow- er with the aid of the U.S. Cen- t/ tral Intelligence Agency while former head-of-state Prince No- rodom Sihanouk was out of the country, today proclaimed him- self president; commander-in- chief of the armed forces, and prime minister: Last week the Cambodian Stu- dent Association precipitated the crisis when it voted \"absolutely no confidence\" in Sirik Matak. Lon Nol claimed that he had act- ed \"according to the wishes- of Buddhist monks and all compat- riots.\" Khmer Rouge attacked The seriousness of the Cambod- ian situation was evident in the size of the puppet Saigon force sent to buttress the Cambodian puppets.
