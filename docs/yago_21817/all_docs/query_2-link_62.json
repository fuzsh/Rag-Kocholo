It provides a framework that will strengthen and expand action to adapt to climate change now and over the long term. It will help protect the future prosperity of the people, economy and environment of NSW from climate change. It will also maximise opportunities to create jobs and grow the economy through adaptation. The strategy sets out key decision-making principles and objectives for adaptation, key priorities and a suite of actions.\n\nA key part of the strategy is to provide up-to-date regional climate change projections to inform adaptation planning (part of Priority 1: Develop robust and trusted metrics and information on climate change risk). The NSW Government provides these publicly accessible local-level climate change projections through the NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project.\n\nRead the NSW Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.\n\nAbout The Climate Change (Net Zero Future) Act 2023\n\nThe Act commits the NSW government to effective action on climate change to ensure a sustainable and fair future for the people, economy and environment of NSW.
