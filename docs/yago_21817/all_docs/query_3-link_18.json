        "text": "Weâve explored historical context, themes, essay planning and essay topics over on our Like a House on Fire by Cate Kennedy blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys, welcome back to Lisa's Study Guides. So this week I have another essay topic breakdown for you. So eventually I'm going to get through all of the VCAA texts that are on the study design, but we're slowly going to get there and are just want to say yet again, even though this one is like a house on fire, I am really glad if you've clicked on this video and you're not necessarily studying it because as always with all my videos, I try to give you an overall message for you to take away that can be applied to any single text. So that is the same for this particular text today. And so even though the takeaway message for this video is quite specific to short stories, it's still an important consideration for any text that you're studying. Ideally, you want to use a diverse range of evidence for any text, but in particular, for short stories, you don't just want to rely on a small handful, but to try and make links between the different short stories.\n\nSo let's see what that means on the other side of this quick overview of the text. Like a House on Fire is a collection of short stories by the author, Cate Kennedy, and unlike a lot of other texts on the study design, this book portrays a lot of very domestic situations, which seems fairly boring compared to some of the other texts that other students might be doing. However, I'm really excited about this text because the short stories are great. Not because they have groundbreaking premises, which they don't, but because of how effortlessly and deeply emotive they are. So the domestic scenarios actually help us relate to the characters in the stories and empathize with the complexity of their experiences. The essay topic we'll be looking at today is in Like a House on Fire, Kennedy finds strength in ordinary people. Discuss.\n\nHere, the term which you really have to think about is strength. We already know that she depicts the story of ordinary people, of people like you or me, or even just people we may know, but does she find strength in them? It could be physical strength, but more often than not, it might be other types of strength. For instance, the mental strength it takes to cope with intense pressure or the emotional strength it takes to make a difficult choice or action. It's important to think about how they might actually apply throughout the book. In this sense, our essay will have essentially two halves.\n\nThe first two body paragraphs we'll look at scenarios of intense pressure, be it through the loss of control in one's life or a domestic situation which has become emotionally tense. The last two body paragraphs will then consider the types of strength that Kennedy evinces in these stories. And we'll contend that she does find strength in the characters who face a difficult decision, but that she also finds a lot more strength in the characters who managed to cope with their situation and grapple with the tensions in their lives.\n\nParagraph one\n\nIn many of her stories, Kennedy portrays characters who experience powerlessness. This loss of power can come a number of ways. For instance, both Flexion and Like a House on Fire tell the story of men who have injured their previously reliable bodies and have thus been rendered immobile. But they also tell the story of their respective wives who have lost some control over their lives now that they have to care for their husbands. On the other hand, there are the kids in Whirlpool whose mother insists that they dress a certain way for a Christmas photo. Her hand on your shoulders, exerting pressure that pushes you down. Kennedy's use of second person really makes you feel this pressure that keeps you from going out to the pool you so desperately desire to be in. Evidently powerlessness is an experience that comes in many shapes and forms in several stories.\n\nParagraph two\n\nIn addition to this, Kennedy explores other emotional tensions across the collection, subverting the idea that the home is necessarily a safe sanctuary. This is where she really goes beyond just the idea of powerlessness, but actually jumps into scenarios that are much more emotionally complex. In Ashes for instance, we see the homosexual protagonist struggle with feeling useless and tongue tied, embarrassed by the floundering pause between his mother and himself. There is a significant emotional hurdle there, which is particularly poignant given that mothers are usually considered a source of safety and comfort for their children. Kennedy's story of domesticity actually subvert or question what we might think of the domestic space shared by family members. If you have the Scribe edition of the book, the artwork on the cover would depict a vase of wilting flowers, an empty picture frame, and a spilt cup of coffee.\n\nThese are all visual symbols of an imperfect domestic life. A similar rift exists between husband and wife in both Five Dollar Family and Waiting, the women find themselves unable to emotionally depend on their partners. While Michelle in Five Dollar Family despises her husbands startled, faintly incredulous expression, an inability to care for their child, the protagonist in Waiting struggles to talk about her miscarriages with her husband who is already worn down as it is. Kennedy takes these household roles of mother, son, husband, wife, and really dives into the complex shades of emotion that lies within these relationships. We realize through her stories that a mother can't always provide comfort to a child and that a husband isn't always the dependable partner that he's supposed to be.\n\nParagraph three\n\nHowever, Kennedy does find strength in some characters who do take a bold or courageous leap in some way. These are really important moments in which she is able to show us the strength that it takes to make these decisions. And she triumphs however small or insignificant that can be achieved.\n\nA moment that really stands out to me is the ending of Laminex and Mirrors, where the protagonist rebelliously smuggles a hospital patient out for a smoke only to have to take him back into his ward through the main entrance and therefore get them both caught. She recounts this experience as the one I remember most clearly from the year I turned 18. The two of us content, just for this perfect moment. And their success resonates with the audience, even though the protagonist would have lost her job and therefore the income she needed for her trip to London, Kennedy demonstrates her strength in choosing compassion for an elderly patient. Even the sister in Whirlpool, who wasn't exactly kind to the protagonist in the beginning, forms an unlikely alliance with her against their mother, sharing a reckless moment and cutting their photo shoot short. Bold leaps such as these are ones that take strength and therefore deserve admiration.\n\nParagraph four\n\nHowever, more often than not, Kennedy's stories are more about the strength needed to simply cope with life, one day at a time. She explores the minutiae of her characters lives in a way that conveys the day to day struggles, but also hints at the underlying fortitude needed to deal with these things on a daily basis. In Tender, the wife feels as if everything at home is on the verge of coming apart since her husband is only able to cook tuna and pasta casserole for their kids. However, when she must get a possibly malignant tumor removed, her concern of whether there'll be tuna and pasta in the pantry just in case, demonstrates her selfless nature. Kennedy thus creates a character who is strong for others, even when her own life at home is disorderly and her health may be in jeopardy. The strength of gritting one's teeth and getting on with things in spite of emotional tension is a central idea across this collection, and many other examples are there for you to consider as well.\n\nAnd so we come to the end of our essay. Hopefully going through this gives you an idea of how to cover more bases with your evidence. Remember that you don't have to recount lots and lots of events, but it's more important to engage with what the events are actually telling us about people. This is particularly important for prompts like this one, where it heavily focuses on the people involved. That is it for me this week, please give this video a thumbs up. If you wanted to say thanks to Mark, who has been helping me write these scripts up for a lot of the text response essay, topic breakdowns. If you enjoyed this, then you might also be interested in the live stream coming up next week, which will be on Friday the 25th of May at 5:00 PM. I'll be covering the topic of analyzing argument for the second time, just because there's so much to get through. I'll also be announcing some special things during that particular live stream. So make sure you're there so you're the first to hear it. I will see you guys next week. Bye.\n\nResources\n\nLike a House on Fire by Cate Kennedy\n\nHow To Get An A+ On Your Like A House On Fire Essay\n\nClose Analysis Of 'Cake' From Like A House On Fire\n\nâThe Complete Maus by Art Spiegelman is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nThemes\n\nAnalysing Techniques in Visual Texts\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Complete Maus is a graphic novel that depicts the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Polish Jewish Holocaust survivor who experienced living in the ghettos and concentration camps during the Nazi regime. Vladekâs son, Art has transformed his story into a comic book through his interviews and encounters which interweaves with Artâs own struggles as the son of a Holocaust survivor, as well as the complex and difficult relationship with his father.\n\n2. ThemesÂ\n\nSurvivalÂ\n\nSurvival is a key theme that is explored during Vladekâs experience in concentration camps and his post-Holocaust life.Â\n\nFor example, Vladek reflects that âYou have to struggle for lifeâ and a means of survival was through learning to be resourceful at the concentration camps.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nResourcefulness is depicted through the physical items Vladek keeps or acquires, as well as through Vladekâs skills. For example, Vladek explains to Art that he was able to exploit his work constantly through undertaking the roles of a translator and a shoemaker in order to access extra food and clothing by being specially treated by the Polish Kapo.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHe even wins over Anjaâs Kapo to ensure that she would be treated well by not being forced to carry heavy objects. Vladekâs constant recounts and reflections symbolise survival, as Vladek was willing and able to use his skill set to navigate through the campâs work system.\n\nDuring the concentration camps, food and clothes also became a currency due to its scarcity and Vladek was insistent on being frugal and resourceful, which meant that he was able to buy Anjaâs release from the Birkenau camp.\n\nâGuilt\n\nAlthough survival is a key theme, the graphic novel explores how Holocaust survivors in The Complete Maus grapple with their deep psychological scars.Â\n\nMany of those who survived the war suffered from depression and was burdened with âsurvivorâs guiltâ. This can be seen through the character of Artâs mother, Anja, as 20 years after surviving the death camps, she commits suicide. After having lost so many of her friends, and families, she struggled to find a reason as to why she survived but others didnât. Throughout the graphic novel, her depression is apparent. In a close-up shot, Anja appears harrowed and says that âI just donât want to liveâ, lying on a striped sofa to convey a feeling of hopelessness as if she was in prison. Her ears are additionally drawn as drooped, with her hands positioned as if she was in prison in the context is that she must go to a sanatorium for her depression.\n\nIt is not only Anjaâs guilt that is depicted, but also Art himself who feels partly responsible. Art feels that people think it is his fault as he says that âThey think itâs MY fault!â and in one panel, Art is depicted behind bars and that â[He] has committed the perfect crimeâ to illustrate that he feels a sense of guilt in that he never really was the perfect son. He believes he is partly responsible for her death, due to him neglecting their relationship. Spiegelman also gives insight to readers of a memory of his mother where she asks if he still loves her, he responds with a dismissive âsureâ which is a painful reminder of this disregard.Â\n\nIntergenerational Gap\n\nArt constantly ponders how he is supposed to âmake any sense out of Auschwitzâ if he âcanât even make any sense out of [his] relationship with [his] fatherâ. As a child of Jewish refugees, Art has not had the same first-hand horrific experiences as his parents and in many instances struggles to relate to Vladekâs stubborn and resourceful tendencies. Art reflects on this whilst talking to Mala about when he would not finish everything his mother served, he would âargue til I ran to my room cryingâ. This emphasises how he didnât understand wastage or frugality even from a very young age, unlike Vladek.\n\nSpiegelman also conveys to readers his sense of frustration with Vladek where he feels like he is being treated like a child, not as an adult. For example, Art is shocked that Vladek would throw out one of Artâs coats and instead buy a new coat, despite Vladekâs hoarding because he is reluctant and feels shameful to let his son wear his âold shabby coatâ. This act could be conveyed to readers that Vladek is trying to give Art a life he never had and is reluctant to let his son wear clothes that are âinappropriateâ in his eyes. However, from Artâs perspective, he âjust canât believe itâ and does not comprehend his behaviour.\n\nSince we're talking about themes, we've broken down a theme-based essay prompt (one of five types of essay prompts) for you in this video:\n\n3. Analysing Techniques in Visual Texts\n\nThe Complete Maus is a graphic novel that may seem daunting to analyse compared to a traditional novel. However, with countless panels throughout the book, you have the freedom to interpret certain visuals so long as you give reasoning and justification, guiding the teacher or examiner on what you think these visuals mean. Here are some suggested tips:\n\nFocus on the Depiction of Characters\n\nSpiegelman may have purposely drawn the eyes of the Jewish mice as visible in contrast to the unapparent eyes of the Nazis to humanise and dehumanise characters. By allowing readers to see the eyes of Jewish mice, readers can see the expressions and feelings of the character such as anger and determination. Effectively, we can see them as human characters through their eyes. The Nazisâ eyes, on the other hand, are shaded by their helmets to signify how their humanity has been corrupted by the role they fulfill in the Holocaust.\n\nâ\n\nWhen the readers see their eyes, they appear sinister, with little slits of light. By analysing the depictions and expressions of characters, readers can deduce how these characters are intended to be seen.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nLook at the Background in Each Panel\n\nThroughout the graphic novel, symbols of the Holocaust appear consistently in the background. In one panel, Artâs parents, Anja and Vladek have nowhere to go, a large Swastika looms over them to represent that their lives were dominated by the Holocaust.\n\nEven in Artâs life, a panel depicts him as working on his desk with dead bodies surrounding him and piling up to convey to the reader that the Holocaust still haunts him to this day, and feels a sense of guilt at achieving fame and success at their expense.\n\nThus, the constant representation of symbols from the Holocaust in Spiegelmanâs life and his parentsâ past in the panelsâ background highlights how inescapable the Holocaust is emotionally and psychologically.Â\n\nSize of Panels\n\nSome of the panels in the graphic novel are of different sizes which Spiegelman may have intended to emphasise the significance of certain turning points, crises or feelings. For example, on page 34, there is a disproportionate panel of Vladek and Anja passing a town, seeing the first signs of the Nazi regime compared to the following panels. All the mice seem curious and concerned, peering at the Nazi flag behind them. This panel is significant as it marks the beginning of a tragic regime that would dominate for the rest of their lives.\n\nYou should also pay close attention to how some panels have a tendency to overlap with each other which could suggest a link between events, words or feelings.\n\nAlthough not specifically targeted at Text Response, 10 Things to Look for in Cartoons is definitely worth a read for any student studying a graphic novel!\n\nâThis blog was updated on 23/10/2020.\n\nContents\n\n1.

Although partially fictionalised, it depicts the very real consequences of false accusations based on blind religious faith, as Miller displays the dangers of such baseless rumours. However, the play was written during another type of witch hunt: McCarthyism in 1950s America. This was a political movement in which Senator Joseph McCarthy attempted to control the spread of Communism by placing any Communist sympathisers on a blacklist. This resulted in a widespread fear of Communist influences, and a political hunt similar to the Salem witch trials began, as civilians attempted to escape their own charges by accusing other innocent individuals of treason. Thus, given the historical context of the time, Miller uses The Crucible as an allegorical warning for the audience against the dangers of McCarthyism in 1950s America.Â\n\nThese concepts will be fully unpacked later, but it is important to keep these key notions of hysteria, accusation and blind faith in mind as you study the text. These are the fundamental ideas that the play is based upon, and also the elements which make The Crucible hugely relevant in our society today. One could even say that the development of technology has made it easier for false allegations and social rumours to spread - leading to drastic consequences specific to the 21st century, such as the leaking of critical government information and cyberbullying. Not to mention, the anonymity of technology has enabled individuals to start modern-day witch hunts as a nameless, faceless user behind the comfort and security of their screens!\n\nHistorical Context\n\nIn varying degrees, every work of literature reflects its historical context, or the social and political conditions that shaped its time period. The Crucible is a four-act play, which presents a dramatised and partially fictionalised depiction of the 1692 Salem witch trials. It was also published in 1953, at the height of the Second Red Scare, or the heightened fear of Communist influences in America. As such, the play is not merely a play based on historically accurate events, but also an allegory of the disastrous consequences of McCarthyism.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nJohn Proctor\n\nProctor is a strong and hardworking farmer, respected by those in Salem for his power and independence. Possessing a âsharp and biting way with hypocritesâ, Proctor is the symbol of autonomous leadership in the play, acting as another source of social authority to the theocratic leaders of the Puritan Church. He is the protagonist of the play, but a flawed individual - while he has great strength of character, he is also presented in The Crucible as an adulterous husband, who is openly defiant of his church. As such, he is described by Miller as a kind of âsinnerâ - one who experiences an internal moral conflict within himself. Proctor undergoes much personal growth during the plot of the play, redeeming his name and obtaining âgoodnessâ by choosing moral honesty over freedom. This ultimate act of courage symbolises the importance of integrity and honour, and represents the âshred of goodnessâ in his character.Â\n\nElizabeth Proctor\n\nAlthough described by Abigail as a âbitter womanâ, Elizabeth is the quiet yet resilient wife of Proctor. Her husbandâs affair with Abigail renders her resentful towards the former and jealous of the latter, resulting in a wounded and fragile marriage. Her humility is made evident as she blames herself for Proctorâs infidelity, believing she erred in keeping a âcold houseâ. In tandem with this icy imagery, Miller utilises Elizabeth as a symbol of honesty and strict moral justice, despite it often being mistaken as âcoldnessâ by others - Proctor asserts that Elizabethâs justice âwould freeze beerâ. Despite this, Elizabeth proves herself to be a caring source of support for her persecuted husband, believing him to be âa good manâ, and ultimately breaking her characteristic honesty in the hopes of his freedom. Her extreme courage is ultimately made evident by her willingness to lose Proctor to the hangmanâs noose, rather than for him to lose his moral virtue by signing his name to lies.Â\n\nAbigail Williams\n\nDescribed as âa wild thingâ, Abigail is a beautiful, yet manipulative and deceptive adolescent with âan endless capacity for dissemblingâ. Still in love with Proctor after their brief affair, she lies to the court and condemns Elizabeth as a witch, in a desperate, jealous attempt to win him back and take Elizabethâs place as his wife. Abigail is the ringleader of the girls, and the progenitor of the false rumours that spiral into the witch hunt. Thus, she embodies falsehood, in a stark contrast to Elizabeth, who is a symbol of truth. Her violent nature is made evident in the play, as she threatens the girls with physical violence and âsmashes Betty across the faceâ in an effort to silence her. Despite this, Miller makes clear that Abigail is a victim of psychological trauma, as she is revealed to have borne witness to the violent death of her parents - partly explaining her disturbed and devious nature.Â\n\nMary WarrenÂ\n\nMary Warren is a sullen, sensitive and easily manipulated servant of the Proctor household. Her volatile nature makes her an easy target for Abigail, who manipulates her into betraying the Proctors by planting a poppet in Elizabethâs room, which ultimately becomes the leading evidence in her sentencing. Mary is a symbol of mass hysteria, as her easily exploitable nature and weakness in spirit represent the irrationality of those who are quick to believe rumours, such as the persecutors of the Salem witch hunts, as well as the accusers of the McCarthy era.Â\n\nSusanna Walcott, Mercy Lewis, Betty Parris\n\nReferred to as âthe girlsâ throughout the play, these young individuals are manipulated by Abigail to falsely convict Elizabeth and numerous others as practicers of witchcraft. All of these girls possess a common fear of Abigail, and carry out her orders in an attempt to evade their own punishment at her hands. Thus, Miller uses them to emphasise his allegory of the McCarthy trials, in which numerous people accused others of Communism based on their own fear of being charged by the Court.Â\n\nThemes\n\nMass Hysteria\n\nMass hysteria is one of the most significant themes of the play, as Miller depicts the entire town of Salem engulfed by the superstition of witchcraft and devil-worship. The community-wide fear of consorting with the devil is shown to overwhelm any kind of rational thought. As one rumour created by Abigail and the girls leads to dozens of incarcerations and executions in a matter of days, The Crucible depicts the âperverse manifestation of panicâ that can occur from unsubstantiated fear. Miller uses this illustration of hysteria to show the effects of a strictly repressive Puritan society. Although some residents of Salem manipulate the witch hunt for their own benefit, such as Abigail, the majority of the townspeople are launched into the terror-fuelled âfeverâ by their genuine belief that the devil is running amok in Salem. The strict theocracy of the town thus exacerbates the crisis, as joining the accusatory crowd becomes a religious necessity; a virtuous âplane of heavenly combat between Lucifer and the Lordâ. As such, the play demonstrates how uncontrolled religious fervour can lead to the collective indoctrination of âblack mischiefâ, where panic clouds all reason.Â\n\nJudgement\n\nJudgement in The Crucible encompasses three meanings; the legal, personal, and spiritual. The legal judgement in the play is depicted as superficial - mainly illustrated through the characters of Hathorne and Danforth, the theocratical Salem court does not carry out real justice due to its dogmatic focus on its reputation. This is depicted by Danforthâs stubborn refusal to free the innocents accused, due to his belief that it would lead to a tainted esteem of the court. Thus, Miller suggests that the more important judgement is personal - exemplified by the character of Proctor. Believing himself to be a âsinnerâ against his own âversion of moral conductâ, Proctor throughout the play shows limitless remorse and self-hatred for the hurt he has caused Elizabeth by his affair with Abigail. Miller shows the importance of forgiveness through self-judgement, as Elizabeth assures Proctor that there is âno higher judge under Heavenâ than Proctor himself, and he ultimately is able to forgive himself and see the âshred of goodnessâ within him by the end of the play. Furthermore, The Crucible depicts the town of Salem overcome by the fear of Godâs judgement, or what Proctor calls âGodâs icy windâ. The events of the play unfold due to the townâs collective fear of the higher power of an âAlmighty Godâ. As Hale proclaims, âBefore the laws of God we are as swine!â, Miller showcases the extent of the fearsome âpower of theocracyâ in circumstances of confusion and hysteria.\n\nAccusation\n\nThe events of the Salem witch trials detail various types of accusation. Although all are disguised as the dispelling of witchcraft, the false allegations depicted in the play are carried out with a range of different motives. For example, Abigailâs accusation of Elizabeth as a witch is described to derive from a âwhoreâs vengeanceâ due to her passionate jealousy of Elizabethâs position as Proctorâs wife, and Abigailâs wish to take her place. Similarly, Rebecca Nurseâs charge of âmurdering Goody Putnamâs babiesâ is due to the Putnamsâ resentment and jealousy of her numerous children, while they themselves have lost babies âbefore they could be baptisedâ.Â In contrast to this, the accusation of Martha Corey, Giles' wife, of witchcraft is motivated by Walcottâs desire for revenge, as he resents her for the unhealthy âpig he bought from her five years agoâ. Thus, his actions are calculative rather than passionate - a cruel attempt to get âhis money backâ. In his employment of the play as a historical allegory, this depiction of the blind following of rampant accusations depicted in The Crucible represents the similarly irrational proceedings of the McCarthy trials, many of which were carried out without substantial evidence.Â\n\nHonour and Integrity\n\nHonour is one of the most prominent themes in the play, as the majority of the characters strive to maintain their reputations in society. Miller depicts a community in which private and public characters are one and the same, and the consequences of the obsessive desire to uphold the esteem of their name. For example, although Proctor has the chance to undermine the girlsâ accusations by revealing Abigail as a âwhoreâ, he does not do so in order to protect his good name from being tarnished. Likewise, Parris at the beginning of the play threatens Abigail and the girls due to his fear that hints of witchcraft will threaten his already precarious reputation in the church and banish him from the pulpit. Furthermore, the judges of Salem do not accept any evidence that could free the innocent accused, as they uphold a false reputation to honour the Puritan church. Despite this, Miller shows the importance of prioritising personal honour over public reputation through the character of Proctor. As he ultimately makes the valiant decision in Act IV to refrain from âsigning liesâ and thus uphold his name, he is able to redeem himself from his previous sins and is able to die with righteousness.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nSymbols and Motifs\n\nThe Crucible\n\nA crucible is a ceramic or metal container in which metals, chemicals or other substances may be melted or subjected to very high temperatures. As such, Miller in the play employs the violent imagery of a crucible to symbolise the severe and challenging test of the Salem witch hunts. As spoken by Danforth in Act III, âWe burn a hot fire in here; it melts down all concealmentâ, the motif of the crucible represents the merciless nature of both the Salem and McCarthy court proceedings, and their dogged determination to convict, despite the lack of substantial evidence. Crucibles are often used for the chemical process of calcination, during which particles are heated to high temperatures in order to purify them - removing any volatile substances from the compound. As such, Miller also suggests that societal challenges such as those depicted in the play can lead to situations in which the good can be separated from the evil; as the town is split into those who are âwith this court orâ¦against itâ, the witch hunts illustrate the distinction between the individuals who possesses moral integrity and those who manipulate the situation for their selfish pursuits.Â\n\nThe Poppet\n\nIn Act III, Abigail and the girls plant a poppet, or doll, in Elizabethâs house, in an attempt to frame her as an individual guilty of witchcraft. As Abigail stabs the doll with a needle in its stomach before leaving it on Elizabethâs shelf, she is able to pretend that her own stomach is injured from Elizabethâs practice of voodoo with it. The poppet is a symbol of childhood and girlhood, and the playâs depiction of it as a tool for malicious revenge represents the loss of innocence and pretence that arises out of the witch hunts. Miller illustrates the danger of mass hysteria, as he depicts the young group of girls, led by Abigail, become manipulated into condemning innocent townspeople to death; thereby losing their innocence and moral virtue. The poppet is also employed as a symbol of deception, as it emphasises the fact that the Salem persecutions are based on lies and falsehood. As the court ignores Elizabethâs outraged protests that she has not kept a poppet since she was a little girl, Miller chastises a justice system which values convenient deceit over the cumbersome truth.Â\n\nPaper\n\nAlthough traditionally associated with knowledge and truth, the motif of paper in the play symbolises morality and individualism. Paper first appears in the play as the judicial list naming the condemned, then as a document of proof outlining Proctorâs alleged crimes as a practicer of witchcraft and agent of the devil. As such, paper initially symbolises the false accusations that run rampant in Salem, and the destructive consequences of such on the lives of the accused innocents. This idea is furthered by Millerâs depiction of the signed, âseventy-two death warrantsâ of innocents, illustrating paper as a symbol of the unjust punishment and corruption within the Salem court. It is only when Proctor refuses to sign the testimony or have his false confession âposted on the church doorâ, that the symbol of paper begins to serve as a motif of heroism. As Proctor ultimately refuses to âsign [his] name to liesâ, then âtears the paper and crumplesâ the document denouncing him as a devil-consorter in Act IV, Miller portrays paper as a mode for personal redemption in the face of blind injustice. This advocating for personal salvation is supported by the character of Hale, who undergoes a similar transformation. Although initially described as an intellectual whose paper âbooks are weighted with authorityâ, this religious authority loses its value throughout the tragic events of the play, as the injustices of the court lead him to lose his âgreat faithâ in God. Ultimately, like Proctor, Hale is only able to gain personal redemption through his realisation of the immoral nature of the court and his attempts (albeit unrealised) to save the remaining incarcerated innocents from the fate of the gallows.\n\nQuote Analysis\n\nAct I\n\n\"There are wheels within wheels in this village, and fires within fires!â\n\nAnn Putnam speaks this line when she admits to interrogating Tituba about the possibility of witchcraft having caused the early deaths of her seven infants. The audience can perceive her hysteria, as she begins to fear that the rumours of devil worship in Salem may be true, and that she may also lose her last surviving child, Ruth. Her sense of paranoia works to foreshadow the mass hysteria that is to overwhelm the town. This quote is also a direct reference to the prophet Ezekiel in the Bible, who compares his vision of God in his chariot to a gyroscope - an instrument of stability and balance. As such, Mrs. Putnamâs allusion to God is a direct reference to the rigidity of the Puritan values in Salem, disguised as a creed of âunityâ, when in reality itâs the root cause of social paranoia and resentment. The quote also illustrates that she believes that there are more complex and intricate forces present in Salem - the âdeep and darkling forcesâ as described by Miller - which work to determine the fates of the townspeople. Combined with its fire imagery, this quote effectively foreshadows the drama that will unfold in the Salem court, in which Abigail and the girls will invent invisible spiritual forces to accuse innocents, in a court of âhot fireâ, acting to âmelt down all concealmentâ.Â\n\nâWe cannot look to superstition in this. The Devil is precise; the marks of his presence are as definite as stone.âÂ\n\nHale says this to Parris when he first arrives in Salem from Beverley, after he is asked to inspect Betty for signs of witchcraft or possession by the devil. Although Parris is already convinced by the rampant rumours in the town of the existence of the devil and its effect on his daughter, Hale (being a professional âinvestigator of witchcraftâ) is more meticulous in his examination of such a âstrange crisisâ. By calling the devil âpreciseâ, Hale depicts his true and unflinching belief in its existence, representing the inflexible Puritan mindset. This quote is integral to understanding Hale as a character, and thus the nature of his disillusionment later in the play, as it reveals that Hale does not believe in witchcraft due to the mass hysteria and paranoia of the town, but because he possesses genuine and resolute faith in every word of the Bible. As this faith is shown to âbring bloodâ later in the play, Miller displays the dangerous âpower of theocracyâ, as the audience perceives Hale becoming radically disillusioned in his religion and world view.Â\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. âFor twenty week he preach nothinâ but golden candlesticks til he had them!â Are the leaders of the community misguided in The Crucible?

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTheme-Based Essay Prompt: In a theocracy, law and religion are bound together. What are the benefits and challenges of this depicted in The Crucible?Â\n\nStep 1: AnalyseÂ\n\nHere, we are asked to examine the benefits and challenges of a theocratic system, as depicted in The Crucible. Thus, we must consider both the positive and negative aspects of the binding of law and religion. It is a good idea to delegate two paragraphs to the challenges and one to the benefits, due to the fact that Miller wrote the play with the authorial intention of denouncing the repressive rigidity of its government - this means it is easier to think of negatives rather than positives.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nLetâs break down the term âtheocracyâ, as this is the focus of this essay topic. The play shows us various effects of such a system, but what does it actually mean? A theocracy is a form of government in which a religion (in this case, Puritanism) is recognised as the supreme ruling authority. Thus, as mentioned in the essay question, in a theocracy the rules of religion are treated as the law. Now, think of some of the words, phrases or key ideas you think of when you conjure up Salemâs version of theocracy. This may include:\n\nStrictness of Puritan values\n\nUnity vs. individualism\n\nExploitation of the name of the church for personal gainsÂ\n\nSocietal repression\n\nSuperfluous power given to the court\n\nOpportunity for individuals to reformÂ\n\nSocial vs. individual redemption\n\nDisillusionment\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWhen planning an essay, it is easy to let yourself go off track, discussing another point that is not quite relevant to the topic given. To prevent this from happening, always keep the topic firmly in your mind - glance at it periodically throughout your planning if needed, and check that every body paragraph that you are planning directly relates back to the topic and answers what it is asking. So, keeping the topic and its focus on theocracy firmly in mind, I chose to approach this essay with the following structured plan:Â\n\nParagraph 1: The Salem theocracy leads to the unjust exercise of power, resulting in a tragedy.Â\n\nHere, our focus is on the overarching injustices that the theocratic nature of the government allows to occur.Â\n\nFocus on the fact that it is because religion is the law, that the crime of witchcraft (believed to be a crime against God) is so severely punished (by death!).Â\n\nAlso discuss that it is due to the rigidity of the theocracy that any slight divergence from a complete adherence to Puritanism is perceived as a crime.Â\n\nExamples of this include the witch hunt itself, and the victimisation of innocents who are condemned to be executed for crimes that they did not commit.Â\n\nParagraph 2: The townâs theocratic belief in God is exploited by individuals who use it for their own personal gain.\n\nOur job here is to highlight the selfish natures of certain individuals, who take advantage of the townspeopleâs theocratic mindsets to utilise the townâs mass hysteria for their own motives.Â\n\nExamples of such characters include Abigail and Parris, who participate in the witch hunt out of vengeance and fear respectively.\n\nParagraph 3: However, the theocratic nature of the government allows opportunity for reform, and the ability to distinguish between morality and immorality.\n\nHere we are discussing the benefit that arises out of the theocracy, namely the idea that the tragedy that results from such allow certain individuals to be enlightened and reformed.\n\nEmphasise the fact that the theocracy does lead to disastrous effects, but it is from this hardship that we are able to distinguish the characters of good from the characters of evil.Â\n\nAn example of a character who undergoes reform is Hale, who becomes simultaneously disillusioned and enlightened by the tragedy of the Salem persecution.\n\nAn example of an individual revealed by the events of the play to be ultimately immoral is Danforth, who refuses to change and reform, despite realising the injustice and cruelty of his actions.Â\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our The Crucible Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

World War II, arguably one of the darkest events of human history, has been the basis of so much writing across so many genres; authors, academics, novelists have all devoted themselves to understanding the tragedies, and make sense of how we managed to do this to one another. Many reflect on the experiences of children and families whose lives were torn apart by the war.\n\nIn some ways, Doerr is another author who has attempted this. His novel alludes to the merciless anonymity of death in war, juxtaposes individualism with collective national mindlessness, and seeks out innocence amidst the brutality of war.\n\nWhat makes this novel difficult to introduce is the way in which Doerr has done this; through the eyes of two children on opposite sides of the war, he explores how both of them struggle with identity, morality and hope, each in their own way. Their storylines converge in the bombing of Saint-Malo, demonstrating that war can be indiscriminate in its victimsâthat is, it does not care if its victims are children or adults, innocent or guilty, French or German. However, their interaction also speaks to the humanity that lies in all of us, no matter how deeply buried.\n\nA very quick history lesson\n\nFast Five Facts about World War II:\n\nLasting 1939-1945, the war was fought between the Axis powers (Germany, Japan and Italy) and the Allies (basically everyone else, but mainly England, France, and later the US). Whilst it was Germany who started the war, the intervention of the US at the end of five long years of fighting ultimately helped the Allies win.\n\nVarious forms of technology were first used, or found new uses, during the war. Aircraft carriers and various planes (fighters, bombers etc.) became more important than ever, while Hitlerâs use of tanks allowed him to take over much of Europe very quickly.\n\nOther forms of new technology included one of the worldâs first electronic computers that was used to codebreak (stop reading now and watch The Imitation Game if you havenât already! Totally counts as studying, right?), as well as radio and radar, used to communicate and also to detect enemies in the field.\n\nWorld War II is also referred to as the Holocaust, the name given to Hitlerâs attempted genocide of the Jewish people. 6 million Jews died in the war, and as many as 15 million others died in total.\n\nGermanyâs initial conquest of Europe was swift and brutal. Within a month, Poland had already surrendered and within a year, so had France. However, there were also resistance groups all over these countries which sought to undermine the Nazi regime in a number of ways, both big and small.\n\nMy best attempt to give a general plot overview of this very long book\n\nâ\n\nDisclaimer: this is a very, very broad overview of the novel and it is absolutely not a substitute for actually reading it (please actually read it).\n\nChronologically, we start in 1934, five years before the war. Marie-Laure is a French girl who lives with her father Daniel Leblanc, working at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. As she starts to go blind, Daniel teaches her Braille, and makes her wooden models of their neighbourhood to help her navigate. Six years later, the Nazis invade France, and they flee the capital to find Danielâs uncle Etienne, who lives in the seaside town of Saint-Malo; Daniel was also tasked with safeguarding a precious gem, the Sea of Flames, from the Nazis.\n\nIn Saint-Malo, Daniel also builds Marie-Laure a model of the town, hiding the gem inside. Meanwhile, she befriends Etienne, who suffers from agoraphobia as a result of the trauma from the First World War. He is charming and very knowledgeable about science, having made a series of scientific radio broadcasts with his brother Henri (who died in WWI). She also befriends his cook, Madame Manec, who participates in the resistance movement right up until she falls ill and dies.\n\nHer father is also arrested (and would ultimately die in prison), and the loss of their loved ones prompts both Etienne and Marie-Laure to begin fighting back. Marie-Laure is also given a key to a grotto by the seaside which is full of molluscs, her favourite kind of animal.\n\nOn the other side of the war, Werner is, in 1934, an 8 year-old German boy growing up in an orphanage with his sister Jutta in the small mining town of Zollverein. They discover a radio, which allows them to listen to a broadcast from miles away (it was Henri and Etienneâs), and Werner learns French to try and understand it. One day, he repairs the radio of a Nazi official, who recruits him to the Hitler Youth on account of his ingenuity (and his very blonde hair and very blue eyes, considered to be desirable traits by the regime). Jutta grows increasingly distant from Werner during this time, as she questions the morality of the Nazis.\n\nWerner is trained to be a soldier along with a cohort of other boys, and additionally learns to use radio to locate enemy soldiers. He befriends Frederick, an innocent kid who was only there because his parents were richâFrederick would eventually fall victim to the brutality of the instructors, and Werner tries to quit out of solidarity. Unfortunately, he is sent into the army to apply his training to actual warfare. He fights with Frank Volkheimer, a slightly ambiguous character who a tough and cruel soldier, but also displays a capacity to be kind and gentle (including a fondness for classical music). The war eventually takes them to Saint-Malo.\n\nAlso around 1943 or so, a Nazi sergeant, Reinhold von Rumpel, begins to track down the Sea of Flames. He would have been successful ultimately had it not been for Werner, who stops him in order to save Marie Laure.\n\nAs America begins to turn the war around, Werner is arrested and dies after stepping on a German landmine; Marie-Laure and Etienne move back to Paris. Marie-Laure eventually becomes a scientist specialising in the study of molluscs and has an extensive family of her own by 2014. Phew.\n\nTheme/s\n\nWhat kind of questions does Doerr raise through this plot? To some degree, the single central question of the novel is one of humanity, and this manifests in a few different ways.\n\nFirstly, to what extent are we in control of our own choices? Do we truly have free will to behave morally? The Nazi regime throws a spanner in the works here, as it makes incredibly inhumane demands on its people. Perhaps they fear punishment and have no choiceâWerner, for instance, does go along with everything. At the same time, his own sister manages to demonstrate critical thinking and moral reasoning well beyond her years, and it makes you wonder if there was potential for Werner to be better in this regard. Thereâs also the question of whether or not he redeemed himself in the end.\n\nThat being said, Werner is far from the only character who struggles with thisâconsider the perfumer, Claude Levitte, who becomes a Nazi informer, or even ordinary French citizens who simply accept the German takeover. Do they actually have free will to resist, or is it even moral for them to do so?\n\nHannah Arendt famously coined the phrase âthe banality of evil,â referring to how broader movements of inhumanity (such as the Holocaust) can be compartmentalised until individual actions feel perfectly banal, commonplace and ordinary. This is what allowed people to do evil things without actually feeling or even being inherently evilâthey were just taking orders, after all. Consider the role of free will in this context.\n\nThis brings us to the broader âthemeâ of war in general: in particular, what kinds of acts are Â suddenly justifiable in war? Etienne and Madame Manec, for instance, even disagree on the morality of resistance, which can frequently involve murder. Etienneâs pacifist stance is a result of the scale of deaths in the previous world war. At the same time, the climactic event of the novel is an allied bombing of Saint-Malo, a French town, just because it had become a German outpost. Risking lives both French and German, this also highlights the ânecessityâ of some inhumane actions in times of war.\n\nOn a more optimistic note, a human quality that Doerr explores is our natural curiosity towards science. This is abundant in the childhoods of both protagonists, as Werner demonstrates dexterity with the radio at a very young age, and Marie-Laure a keen interest in marine biology. In particular, her blindness pushes her into avenues of science which she can experience without literal sight, such as the tactile sensations of mollusc shells. The title may hint at thisâfor all the light she cannot see, she seeks enlightenment through knowledge, which in turn gives her hope, optimism and purpose.\n\nAt the same time, the human desire to better understand the world can also be used inhumanelyâWerner used radio to learn through Etienne and Henriâs broadcasts, but he would later in life also use it to help his compatriots murder enemy soldiers. This alludes to the banality of evil again; by focusing on his very technical role and his unique understanding of the science behind radios, he is able to blind himself to the bigger picture of the evils he is abetting. Science is something that is so innately human, yet can also be used inhumanely as well.\n\nFor these reasons, Iâd suggest humanity is at the heart of the novel. There is a certain cruel randomness to death in war, but just because so many did perish doesnât mean that there arenât human stories worth searching for in the destruction. This is the lens that Doerr brings to the WWII narrative.\n\nSome symbols\n\nTo some degree, a lot of these symbols relate to humanity, which Iâve argued is the crux of the novel. Iâll keep this brief so as to not be too repetitive.\n\nOne major symbol is the radio, with its potential for good as well as for evil. On one hand, it is undoubtedly used for evil purposes, but it also acts as a source of hope, purpose, conviction and connection in the worst of times. It is what ultimately drives Werner to save Marie-Laure.\n\nAlong the same vein, whelks are also a major symbol, particularly for Marie-Laure. While an object of her fascination, they also represent strength for her, as they remain fixed onto rocks and withstand the beaks of birds who try to attack them. In fact, she takes âthe Whelkâ as a code-name for herself while aiding the resistance movement. Itâs also noteworthy that, given the atrocities of war, maybe animals are the only innocent beings left. As Saint-Malo is destroyed and the Sea of Flames discarded, it is the seaside ecosystem that manages to live on, undisturbed. In this sense, the diamond can be seen as a manifestation of human greed, harmless once removed from human society.\n\nFinally, itâs also worth considering the wooden models that Daniel builds for Marie-Laure. They represent his immense love for her, and more broadly the importance of family, but the models also attempt to shrink entire cities into a predictable, easily navigable system. As weâve seen, this is what causes people to lose sight of the forest for the treesâto hone in on details and lose track of the bigger picture around them. The models are an oversimplification of life, and an illusion of certainty, in a time when life was complicated and not at all certain for anyone.\n\nConclusion\n\nIdentity, morality and hopeâthese things pretty much shape what it means to be human. Throughout All the Light We Cannot See though, characters sometimes struggle with all three of them at the same time.\n\nAnd yet they always manage to find something within themselves, some source of strength, some sense of right and wrong, some humanity in trying times. Doerr explores this capacity amply in this novel, and in this sense his novel is not just another story about WWIIâitâs a story about the things that connect us, always.\n\nEssay prompt breakdown\n\nTranscription\n\nThrough the prompt that weâll be looking at today, the main message I wanted to highlight was to always try and look for layers of meaning. This could mean really being across all of the symbols, motifs and poetic elements of a text, and itâs especially important for a novel as literary as this one.\n\nYou might not have been particularly happy to find out youâre going to have to study All The Light We Cannot Seeâit is probably the longest text on the entire text listâbut itâs also a really beautiful, well-written book that deservedly took out the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2015.\n\nIn this novel, Anthony Doerr tells the World War 2 story through a unique lens, or rather a unique combination of lenses, as he sets a 16-year-old French girl and a 17-year-old German boy on an unlikely path of convergence. Through the dangers and difficulties that they face, Doerrâs novel is one of growth and self-assuredness in a time when this seemed virtually impossible.\n\nThe essay topic weâll be looking at today is:\n\nAll The Light We Cannot See is a literal title for the novel, in that it exposes the darkness, evil and cruelty of which humans are demonstrably capable. Is this an accurate interpretation?\n\nAs usual, letâs define some keywords.\n\nI want to leave âdarknessâ for a little later, but letâs start with âevil and cruelty.â By themselves, they generally just mean immorality or inhumanity, but also keep in mind how they come across in charactersâ actions, since those will be the focus of our analysis. The word âdemonstrablyâ highlights this, since it means that any âevilâ you discuss needs to be demonstrated or proven.\n\nWith âdarknessâ, thatâs a bit more of a tricky term because it can mean any number of things. Here, it might be taken to mean bad intentions, corruption or anything like that, because it fits with âevil and crueltyâ. However, this is where the âinterpretationâ aspect of the prompt comes inâan interpretation being a way of explaining meaning, how do you explain the meaning of âdarknessâ in relation to the title? Darkness in this sense could be any number of things.\n\nNow, how should we plan for this topic? Letâs first consider if thereâs any room to challenge, since the prompt seems to only focus on the more negative, pessimistic side of the book. Iâd argue that with darkness, there is also some light in the form of kindness, charity and hope. Â\n\nThis all sounds pretty profound, but Iâm just trying to link it back to the bookâs title! I mean, thatâs what the topic is asking about, right?\n\nLetâs break this down into paragraphs.\n\nFor our first paragraph, a good starting point might be analysing the literal forms of darkness in the novel, and seeing what other interpretations we can get from those. A character that comes to mind is Marie-Laure, the French girl who cannot see any âlightâ due to her blindness. The title could be seen as an allusion to her character and by extension, the hopelessness that blindness might cause in the midst of a war. We could compare Marie-Laureâs situation with that of Werner, who faces the industrialization of his childhood town, watching it become more and more enveloped in âdarknessâ and as such, hopelessness.\n\nFor our next paragraph, we might drill down to deeper levels of interpreting darkness, because itâs often used as a metaphor for inhumanity. It isnât difficult to find inhumanity in the novel. Thereâs plenty of it peppered throughout Wernerâs storyline, particularly at Schulpforta, where the Hitler Youth were âtrainedâ, (to put it lightly). He and his peers are routinely drilled to âdrive the weakness from the corpsâ in humiliating exercises led by cruel instructors. They are also sometimes driven to cruelty towards one another, and Frederick, Wernerâs bunkmate, is relentlessly bullied for his perceived weakness.\n\nSo by now, itâs clear that the novel demonstrates the human capacity for experiencing âdarknessâ as well as inflicting it upon others. But, across these two layers of meaning, could there perhaps be some room to challenge these interpretations? This is something we should look at for our final paragraph.\n\nHere, I would probably argue that just as Doerr explores various forms of darkness, there is also enough âlightâ which allows some characters to overcome or escape from the darkness. These manifestations of light also require you to think about the different symbolic layers of the novel. On one level for example, looking at light literally, thereâs the message on Wernerâs radio that teaches us that, even though the brain is sealed in darkness, âthe world it constructsâ¦is full of light.â A deeper level of meaning to this may refer to the sense of scientific wonder and discovery which sometimes brings light to Werner, and also Frederick, his bunkmate at Schulpforta, when their lives there are at their most dark.\n\nConsider how, just as darkness has levels of interpretation and symbolism in this book, so does light and hope and joy, rather than just evil and cruelty.\n\nAnd thatâs it! Always delving deeper for meaning helps you to really make use of the symbols, imagery and motifs in a text, and I hope this novel in particular illustrates that idea.\n\nâ\n\nUpdated on 15/12/2020.\n\nContents\n\nSummary: A Brief Snapshot\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nThemes\n\nSymbolism\n\nStage Directions\n\nEssay Topics\n\nEssay Topic Breakdown\n\nResources\n\nExtinction is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Summary: A Brief Snapshot\n\nAt the heart of innovative technology and products lies exceptional human creativity. Our brains are practically wired to create and innovate newness. Naturally, the influx of products enteringÂ the market createsÂ a consumer frenzy. Suddenly, everything is a commodified entity with a dollar-sign attached to it. Its inherent value lies in how much consumers covet the item.Â\n\nLetâs take the iPhone for example! An idea of a communication device - both sleek in its functionality and aesthetic - is mass produced, consumed by millions and the cycle perpetuates itself. It is an item so coveted and desired, a 17-year-old boy from China sold a kidney to buy the iPad and iPhone. This phenomenon of consumerism is symptomatic of a contemporary worldâs obsession with vanity and aesthetic. Our fixation on the surface-level and glossy facades is similarly echoed by Extinctionâs main protagonist, Professor Heather Dixon-Brown, who criticises the âcharismatic fauna pushâ where we are âmaking celebrities out of pandas and polar bearsâ. While those campaigns are successful in raising better awareness and positivity in the realm of conservation, they do not change the ways in which we live and consume.\n\nHow we live today is inflicting a deep ecological impact on planet earth. Furthermore, as urban landscapes inevitably expand, we continue to encroach on the territory of the natural world.\n\nThese are the kind of thoughts that popped into my mind after reading Extinction. Hannie Raysonâs provocative play delves deep into the central question of what it means to uphold a personal conviction in the face of self-interest and necessity. Casual flings, extinguishing of life and the friction between âideological purityâ and functionality threatens to unhinge even seemingly robust characters such as Heather Dixon-Brown, an ecologist who preaches that she âuses her head, not her heartâ. Raysonâs literary work endeavours to capture how the human character is, in fact, multidimensional and never static! As the passionate environmentalists and pragmatic ecologists are entangled in ethical quandaries, the playwright also illustrates how divorcing your mindset from emotion is a universal struggle. Furthermore, she explores how moral conviction is consistently at odds with the demands of the personal and professional domains we inhabit.\n\nThroughout the drama encapsulating mining magnates, environmentalists and ecologists, Rayson combines their fictional voices to echo a cautionary tale of how self-interest and misconception about âthe otherâ may distort rationality. When the CEO of Powerhouse mining, Harry Jewell, bursts into a wildlife rescue centre in Cape Otway, holding a critically injured and endangered tiger quoll, he inadvertently catalyses a conflict that will draw out the prejudices withheld by the trio of environmentalists.\n\nI encourage you to think about the lessons embedded in the play. What are the take-home messages YOU have discovered?\n\nGuiding Questions:\n\nWhat is the message the playwright is attempting to deliver to her audiences?\n\nWhen you finished the play, what feelings were you left with?\n\nWhich characters did you find likeable? Who aggravated you the most? And most importantly, provide evidence for why you felt that way! Was it because of their problematic ways of dealing with an ideological crisis? Or their fierce passion towards upholding moral conviction?\n\n2. Character Analysis\n\nLet's take a look at these deeply flawed human beings:\n\nProfessor Heather Dixon-Brownâ\n\nDirector of the CAPE instituteÂ\n\nInterested in only saving species that are âstatistically saveable'.\n\nBureaucrat with the realism to match.\n\n'I am an ecologist, not an environmentalist. I use my head, not my heart.'\n\n'Species are like commoditiesâ¦I just donât approve of this âcharismatic faunaâ push - making celebrities out of pandas and polar bears.' (p. 99)Â\n\n'You want me to close the CAPE. Is that what you want? Then we can bask in ideological purityâ¦' (p. 120)\n\nThe never-ending struggle between heart and mind is central theme in the play.\n\nHarry Jewell\n\nAn idealist with the knack for alluring women to fall for him.\n\n'You donât serve your cause by being indifferent to the interest of working people.'Â\n\n'I know his type: the kind of greenie whoâs always saying no. No dams. No mines. No roads.' (p. 114)\n\n'I am not some multinational corporation devouring the Amazon. Iâm just a bloke whoâs come back home.' (p. 114)\n\nPiper Rossâ\n\nZoologist from San Diego Zoo (temporarily transferred)Â\n\nAndy Dixonâs girlfriendÂ\n\nGets entangled in a romp with Harry Jewell aka Mr. Evil\n\n'They are all 'worth saving''. (p. 83)\n\nAndy Dixon\n\nA vet who is extremely pragmatic in his mindset towards his work and personal life\n\nSlight aversion to technology\n\nThe inevitability of technology supplanting certain occupationsÂ\n\nTechnological evolution? (Is it the kind of evolution we want?)\n\n'â¦the great advocate for our native flora and faunaâ¦' (p. 118)\n\n'You should see this dairy farm. Itâs all computerised. Theyâve got one bloke managing a thousand cows. No human supervision of the milking. No-one to check the udders. Iâm just there, doing the rounds. Like a robot.' (p. 82)\n\n3. Themes\n\nLogic vs. Emotion (Pragmatism vs. Ideological Purity)\n\nTo divorce your emotions from affecting your decision-making capacity is a universal struggle aptly captured by Raysonâs depiction of Dixon-Brownâs gradual inclination towards the tiger quoll project funded by a coal company. In this case, we can argue that her objectivity and âher headâ is seemingly beguiled by the charms of Harry Jewell.Â\n\nEarly in the play, Professor Dixon-Brown is anchored to her desk, filing applications and paperwork instead of âgetting back to her own researchâ. This prospect changes when Harry - big coal - offers 'two million dollars on the table' to fund the tiger quoll campaign. Nonetheless, we see the two unexpected collaborators setting a dangerous precedent where one can simply equate a speciesâ livelihood to âcommoditiesâ and âa good returnâ of profit.\n\nWhat is compelling about Harryâs character is that he combines both pragmatism and ideological purity. Firstly, Harry has the means and business acuity to manoeuvre a board of directors bent on exploring coal âright on the edge of the national parkâ. However, âMr Evilâ is also inspired by nostalgia and sentimentality over a childhood memory where a tiger quoll steals his drumstick.\n\nConversely, Andy Dixon-Brownâs stance against the mining industry and automated dairy farms is admirable considering how technology has become a central cornerstone of modern-day life. His partner Piper Ross, a zoologist, echoes similar distaste for mining companies, however, her passion for âsavingâ all animals eclipses her own presumptions towards âMr Evilâ. She is eventually persuaded to head the tiger quoll project.\n\nWhereas, Professor Dixon-Brown enjoys the uncomplicatedness of numbers and statistics. However, her carefully crafted algorithm fails to differentiate between the diversity of animals within the ecosphere. Instead, it filters out populations of 5000 and above to collate only the âstatistically saveableâ.\n\nIn this respect, Harryâs actions showcase how a striking a balance between pragmatism and emotion is important.\n\nUnity in a Socially Divisive World\n\nIn this play, the âus vs. themâ mentality pervades the minds of the protagonists. Through the heated dialogue between environmentalists, ecologists and mining moguls, Hannie Rayson delivers the message that as a society we should not be so reliant on simplifying individuals based on age-old presumptions and surface-level characteristics. Harry Jewell echoes a similar sentiment as he discusses his companyâs plans to Piper: 'Whoâs this âweâ? You donât serve your cause by being indifferent to the interests of the working people.' (p. 92)\n\nZooming in: Andy &Â Harry: Let's explore the volatile dynamic between the two males\n\nAndyâs indignant stance against collaborating with the mining industry showcases his resilience in sticking to his moral code. One can argue that his immediate demonisation of Harry Jewell, as evidenced by the nickname âMr. Evilâ, is a symptom of Andyâs oversimplified thinking. It is through Andyâs inflammatory and infantile language towards the Mining CEO that Rayson articulates how the politics of conservation is in shades of grey. Conversely, Harryâs admits that he knew Andy was âthe type of greenie whoâs always saying no [from the moment he came through that door]â. In highlighting the binary oppositions of the two men working in different fields, the play acknowledges how prejudice inhibits potential collaborations.\n\nHarry and Andy showcase how our own misconceptions about âthe otherâ detract from our own moral causes - such as in this case, saving the forest. Both men are committed to the same cause. However, Andyâs antagonistic approach towards Harry undercuts his own integrity as he willingly allows prejudice to cloud his thinking simply because it is the more convenient thing to do, as opposed to collaborating and accommodating each otherâs interests.\n\nCategorising strangers into convenient stereotypes is pure laziness.\n\nAndy: 'Hope he didnât damage that cruise missile heâs got out there?' (p. 73)\n\nHarry: 'I know the type - knew him the moment he came through that door. Heâs the kind of greenie whoâs always saying no. No dams. No mines. No roads.' (p. 114)\n\nRomanticism vs. Reality\n\nAgainst the backdrop of familial arguments and budding romances, Extinctionâs Professor Dixon-Brownâs blunt dialogue about conservation reveals its politicised nature. Her heated dialogue with Piper echoes her frustration at âwriting [Stuart Deckerâs] applications so he can get âa sun tanâ conducting research on The Great Barrier Reef and win accolades for it'. Furthermore, she satirically exclaims that â[the institute] needs to defend its territoryâ. Her mocking of the vice-chancellor who acted like they were in a âWhite House Situation Roomâ implicitly demonstrates her growing disdain towards the tenuous politics of her workplace. Essentially, Heatherâs realist approach exposes what lies beneath the glossy exterior of conservation efforts.\n\nIâve seen quite a few videos of baby pandas circulating on my Facebook feed, most of them are part of a conservation effort or campaign. The comment section of these videos is like a medley of heart-eyes and exclamations of âHow cute!!â This relatively harmless sentiment is dismissed by Professor Dixon-Brown when she states that she is completely disengaged with âcharismatic faunaâ (p. 99) push - making celebrities out of pandas and polar bearsâ. Our overwhelmingly positive reactions towards such campaigns is based on a societal gravitation towards the aesthetically pleasing which bleeds into the next thematic idea revolving around our fixation on appearance (surface-level).\n\nEssentially, in the context of this play, the preferential treatment of endangered animals reflects our own biased thinking.\n\nVanity and Our Obsession With Appearance\n\nThe idea of vanity also pervades the sub-consciousness of both male and female protagonists. Against the backdrop of environmental conservation dilemmas, Hannie Rayson manages to entwine a secondary story strand which captures the insecurities peppering the female experience in this contemporary age. The audience learns that Heather Dixon-Brown spends $267 on hair removal every five weeks. Interestingly, her brother,Â âa screaming heterosexualâ (p. 95), likens the hair removal process to âgetting a tree loppedâ. The destructive and almost violent imagery of chopping down a tree echoes the crippling pressure for Heather to âsculptâ herself into a particular ideal of femininity.\n\nIt is in this way that Rayson articulates a broader thematic idea that womanhood is still being defined in terms of attractiveness and perseveration of youth. Heatherâs internalised insecurities resurface in her heated confrontation with Harry. She accuses him of âprefer[ing] a younger womanâ and having ânever been with a woman with pubic hairâ. Both of which Harry indignantly refutes. Through this heated dialogue, audiences gain an insight into Heatherâs vulnerability as a divorcee-to-be and interestingly, we are exposed to her assertiveness as she questions 'canât [you] stomach a woman who stands up to you?'\n\nHer conflicting ideologies on womanhood are best exemplified through Harry who almost admonishes her for embodying âsome nineteen-fifties idea of relationshipsâ where âsex with someoneâ does not necessarily entail âa lifelong commitmentâ. ThisÂ is also the central conflict faced by all the characters who engage in seemingly non-committal relationships and false expectation. It is through these failed trysts that Rayson disapproves of uninhibited sexual impulses and by extension, criticises the increasing promiscuity in contemporary times. Essentially, Raysonâs fixation on causal sexual relationships mirrors her own opinion that there has been a paradigm shift in how we govern our sexuality and bodies since the 1950s.\n\nConservation in a World of Destruction\n\nYou can define conservation in terms of âpreservation ofâ¦Â â, âsustainingâ¦â.\n\nIn the personal domain, Piper maintains that she and Harry âslept in separate tentsâ to her boss Professor Dixon-Brown who also doubles as her potential sister-in-law. Conversely, Professor Dixon-Brown is forced to make an ethical compromise to prevent a career besmirching orchestrated by a mass-email insinuating a sordid romance between her and her newest collaborator, Harry Jewell. Her reputation as CAPEâs director is nearly tarnished by the vengeful force of a flingâs ex-wife.\n\nDo I preserve my moral compass or my professional reputation?\n\nOther thematic ideas that relate to this umbrella phrase include: misuse of authority and ethics of the digital world.Â\n\nDeleting emails is tantamount to rewording/reworking history. Professor Dixon-Brownâs attempt at salvaging/restoring her pristine moral code of âusing her head, not her heartâ is encapsulated in her desperate dash to the IT servers at 1am in the morning to delete the incriminating email detailing her illicit relationship with Harry Jewell. This, undoubtedly, compromises bothÂ of their careers as professionals. Furthermore, their intimate fling casts Dixon-brown as a seducer/a woman who is easily compromised, which is untrue. However, it is the facades that count in the play.\n\n4. Symbolism\n\nEuthanising the Female Tiger Quoll\n\nIn this case, by virtue of being female, we can assume the tiger quoll âwith a crushed spineâ has reproductive capabilities. The injured tiger quoll was a life-giving entity. Technically, if she recovered fully, the tiger quoll could be the solution to its endangered status.Â\n\nAndyâs swift decision to euthanise the animal in great pain could be in reference to his own desire to âmake [his life] overâ. He has inadvertently projected his own fears and anxieties over his GSS diagnosis onto the critically injured creature. Essentially, in the moment of mutual pain, Andy could resonate with the tiger quoll.Â\n\nOne-Night Stands/Casual Sex/Non-Committed Relationships\n\nMy theory is that the images of casual sex serve as an ironic layer to a play titled Extinction. Both Piper and Heather unwittingly develop sexual relations with Jewell on a casual basis which symbolises how intercourse is no longer purely valued as a means for continuing the species. These âeffortsâ for reproduction are fruitless.Â\n\n1. They show how mankind is centred on pleasure and instant gratification, prioritising the self above all matters.Â\n\n2. They demonstrate how modern living expectations, consumerism and the perpetuation of gluttony have led to a plateau in human evolution.\n\nReal-life Amanda -> Tutor comment translation:\n\nAs I was reading the text, a recurring question kept nagging at me: Why are there intimate scenes sandwiched between the layers of ideological conflict and tension?\n\nTutor -> real-life Amanda translation:\n\nOh my goodness, are these characters THAT sexually frustrated? Someoneâs heart is going to get broken and then we will have to analyse that in our essays. Ughhhhhh.\n\n5. Stage Directions\n\nWeather Transitions\n\n1. The opening scene showcases how vets and environmentalists alike are surprised by the first sighting of a tiger quoll in a decade. Their surprise at this unprecedented occurrence is reinforced by the âwet and windyâ conditions. Typically, stormy weather is symbolic of chaos and unpredictability.Â\n\n2. During a particularly heated exchange between Andy and Piper, the interjection of âthunderâ intensifies rising temperament in both characters. (p. 73)\n\n3. When Andy discovers who âHarry bloody Jewellâ is, his growing disbelief and rising temperament are complemented by the off-stage sound of âthe roar of the motorbikeâ. The audiological stage cue characterises Jewell as an unwanted presence of chaos and noise. As the motorbikeâs roar is a sound incongruent with the natural environment encapsulating Harry.\n\nThe Meaning of Fire\n\nIn Act Two: Scene One, the secretiveness of Harry and Piperâs tryst is underlined by the âvast blacknessâ and their figures âin silhouetteâ. Furthermore, its fragile and tenuous connection is symbolically related to how both counterparts repeatedly âpoke[] the fireâ to ensure its longevity through the night. Perhaps, this imagery is referring to how all temptation and sexual energy need to be moderated, which complements Piperâs reluctance to continue their budding relationship.\n\n6.

Resources\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response\n\nExtinction by Hannie Rayson A+ Essay Topic\n\nHow To Write A Killer Text Response (Study Guide)\n\nHow To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss\n\nHow To Turn Text Response Essays From Average to A+\n\n5 Tips for a Mic-Drop Worthy Essay Conclusionâ\n\nIntroduction\n\nChoosing an Oral Presentation topic can be tough. Finding an idea thatâs unique, relevant and interesting all at once can sometimes feel impossible; but donât worry, this is where we come in! Below is a list of 12 potential Oral Presentation topics for you to draw inspiration from, selected in reference to the VCE assessment criteria.\n\nRemember, this blog is not a resource to give you a finished speech idea, these are just jumping-off points. Plagiarism is very harshly punished in VCE and many other students will currently be reading this very same post, meaning it's up to YOU to figure out how youâll form a unique angle if you pick one of these topics. To help you do this, each section provides an overview of the cultural events that make this topic relevant. Additionally, possible contentions are included, ensuring you can see how arguments about these topics can be effectively made.Â\n\nTopics\n\n1. Kanyeâs blow-up - The necessity of the media to stop platforming celebrities spreading harmful ideas\n\nAmerican rapper Kanye West has always been a controversial figure, but since his endorsement of Trump in 2016 heâs seemingly been on a particularly bad downward spiral. His descent into increasingly more extremist right-wing politics has led to the question of whether the news media, detached and neutral as they might claim to be, should even be reporting on him.Â\n\nAs of writing (late 2022), Kanyeâs recent appearances on far-right talk shows to voice support for Hitler and question the existence of the Holocaust (which has no doubt been topped by something equally controversial by the time this gets published) pushes this question right to its limit.Â\n\nEvents like this are undoubtedly big stories that many people would like to know about, but does reporting on them do more harm than good? Do we realistically all have the self-control to ignore these figures when so much of modern news already revolves around controversy and gossip?\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nMajor media companies should reach an agreement to actively avoid covering celebrity behaviour that spreads dangerous ideas.Â\n\nNews media should make an extra effort to disprove the dangerous ideologies of those they cover, rather than presenting them in a âneutral wayâ.\n\nâ\n\n2. Amber Heard - How online discourse can villainise marginalised groups and encourage âdogpilingâ\n\nA similar celebrity controversy that dominated 2022 headlines was the two-way public defamation lawsuit between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, which involved accusations of abuse on both sides. One of the most notable parts of this case was the online depiction of Heard, on social media platforms such as Facebook and Youtube.Â\n\nHeard emerged as the internetâs new favourite punching bag, with an endless stream of videos and memes where her âallegations of domestic violence and sexual assault were mocked for entertainmentâ. Crucially, these were made to criticise her in a way that most clearly mirrored historical sexist stereotypes about emotionally manipulative women. You probably came across examples of these yourself, as platforms like Youtube have a history of directing users to this kind of content.Â\n\nAs such, key issues were identified in terms of how social media warps online discussions of allegations of abuse. Additionally, like the last topic, the very fact that this legal dispute was publicly broadcast raises questions as to whether the mediaâs focus on this event may have worsened the issue.Â\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nPersonal legal proceedings between celebrities are not something that should be broadcast to the public.\n\nThe online discussion regarding this trial demonstrates the need for increased regulation of hateful and abusive content on social media platforms.\n\n3. Should Australia be made a republic in the wake of the Queenâs death?\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth II in September of 2022, among many other things, drew Australia back into a debate it's been having for decades; should we become a republic? This would be a shift from our current state of (effectively) being overseen by the United Kingdom as a âconstitutional parliamentary monarchyâ, with the âhead of stateâ now being an Australian citizen rather than the UK monarch.Â\n\nAlthough the replacement of the Queen with the new head of state (King Charles III) shouldnât really shift peopleâs perspective on this issue, it most likely will. Queen Elizabeth has been the welcoming and approachable symbol of the monarchy for many Australians. Her death could be the catalyst for a shift in public opinion, severing the connection that many citizens still had to the UK monarchy.Â\n\nThis issue can be approached from many different angles, inducing discussion on HOW the process of Australia becoming a republic should occur (especially how the new head of state should be chosen), as well as stepping back and assessing the positives and negatives of making this shift.\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nAustraliaâs transition to a republic is a necessary step in helping honour the countryâs Indigenous population and rejecting its colonial past\n\nAustraliaâs transition to a republic, although often framed as an act of national unity, will actually worsen the cultural divides within our country.Â\n\nAlthough Australia should transition to a republic, the current rise of nationalist politics makes a public election of the new head of state extremely risky.\n\n4. Are NFTs a positive advancement in contemporary technology?Â\n\nWhether or not you understand what it actually means, the phrase âNFTsâ has probably been inescapable on your social media feeds over the last year. Without getting too detailed, these âNon-Fungible Tokensâ are essentially investments into non-replicable representations of artwork, which will (supposedly) increase in value over time.Â\n\nDespite seemingly being an exciting new technology that could have given control back to artists through copyright ownership, NFTs have instead been heavily criticised for commercialising artwork by reducing it to a literal piece of digital currency. Further issues have arisen in terms of how this technology can easily be used to scam people through misrepresenting the value of individual NFTs, or NFT owners simply taking the money and running.\n\nWhat do you think? All new technology seems shaky and uncertain at the start, and maybe we should recognise that the current negative impacts of NFTs must simply be overcome with time. How do we weigh the benefit this technology has for individual artists against its potential drawbacks?\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nFor their many flaws, NFTs give the power back to creators and, therefore, need to be improved rather than roundly rejected.Â\n\nDespite preaching democratisation, NFTs and Bitcoin are both a part of a technological trend that will further increase wealth inequality.\n\n5. How much can Western citizens really do to fight injustice via social media activism?\n\nThe effect of the COVID pandemic on developing countries, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and human rights abuses by the nation of Qatar - this year has seen an innumerable number of news stories that would make any reasonable person jump to their phones to see what they could do to help, like signing an online petition or sharing a public post to spread awareness.\n\nHowever, as you probably know, these forms of social media 'slacktivismâ have historically drawn criticism for their ineffectiveness and self-serving nature. Increasingly though, this debate has become more complicated, moving away from the simplified dismissal of any social media activism that emerged around the turn of the century. Others have rightly pointed out that many influential contemporary social movements, that have had real-world impacts, did emerge from social media, such as the BLM and #MeToo movements.Â\n\nAs such, thereâs a lot of room for different arguments here regarding whether a critical perspective of âsocial media slacktivismâ has become outdated in a world that is increasingly unavoidably based on the internet.\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nSocial media activism is unavoidably the way that young people are going to engage with political issues, and a rejection of it is naive and impractical.Â\n\nPolitical activism should distance itself from the online world if it wants to make real-world change that doesnât fit neatly under existing power structures.\n\n6. Is the overload of various media streaming service subscriptions sustainable?\n\nâStreaming fatigueâ has emerged as a 2023 talking point that may have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. Remember when we just had Netflix offering us a new way of consuming film and TV that was both more convenient and cost-effective than âpay TVâ packages (which were often heavily inflated in price and packed with unwanted channels)?\n\nHowever, as we move into 2023, many have argued that the current subscription landscape now mirrors the previous pay-TV model. Consumers once again find themselves having to pay for an increasingly large amount of services if they want to conveniently access their film and TV shows. Predictably, this has seen a re-emergence of video piracy.Â\n\nDoes this mean that it's fundamentally impossible for us to access our media as conveniently as weâd like to, and the years of Netflix being the only streaming service that had all we wanted were never sustainable? Or maybe corporations are unfairly squeezing every dollar they can out of us, and piracy is a fair and just consumer response?Â Â\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nThrough offering convenience that is unparalleled by any other previous technology, streaming services are still worth the cost.Â\n\nConsumers should actively engage in digital piracy until media corporations create a more affordable streaming environment.\n\n7. Is a post-COVID work-at-home model healthy for the next generation of workers?\n\nAlthough 2020 and 2021 may be remembered as the âyears of COVIDâ, 2022 onwards is perhaps when we will see which long-term impacts of the pandemic continue to stick around. Aside from the permanent placement of public hand sanitiser stations, working from home has emerged as one of the most prominent main-stays from our lockdown years.Â\n\nIs this something that we should embrace? A lot was said during the lockdown about the mental health effects of being deprived of human connection; is this something we should just forget about when it comes to work? As with many of these issues, the question arises as to whether this shift is an inevitable effect of technological advancement, which we can either accept or fruitlessly battle until it becomes the new normal.Â\n\nHowever, the fact that this âwork from homeâ dynamic only emerged due to a pandemic complicates this idea, making it possible that we may have accidentally all become accustomed to a new economic model of work that we would be better off without.Â\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nWe must actively push back against the âwork from homeâ model; if we donât, we will suffer both mentally and financially into the future.Â Â\n\nWorking from home is a win-win; it's more convenient and cost-effective for both employer and employee.\n\n8. How can gentrified and aestheticised versions of social movements be avoided?\n\nI wonder whether you saw the Indigenous name for Victoriaâs capital city (Naarm) appear more frequently on your social media feeds this year, with people adding it to their Instagram bios or referring to it on TikTok? What started as a conscious choice to respectfully refer to the city by its original Indigenous name quickly became criticised as a trendy aesthetic for outwardly progressive white Victorians, with terms like ânaarm-coreâ becoming short-hand for a specific kind of trendy fashion that was âdevoid of any ties to First Nations peopleâ.Â\n\nâNaarm-coreâ, therefore, stands as another example of a movement that may have started with admirable aims, but was drowned out by those who just wanted the social benefits of participating in progressive politics. Think of the recent similar debates about ârainbow capitalismâ, with similar criticisms being made of brands that co-opt progressive concepts like LGBQTI+ identity purely for social (and financial) capital. The question naturally emerges as to how we can avoid this for future political movements.Â\n\nOr maybe you disagree with all these critiques? Political discussion moves so fast these days that it can feel like people are in such a rush to criticise things that they miss actual progress being made. After all, the use of the term âNaarmâ to refer to Melbourne was undeniably popularised on the back of this trend.Â\n\nâPossible Contentions:Â\n\nThe criticism of political movements that deal with race being tokenised by white people can only be solved by allowing people of colour at the centre of these movements.\n\nPeople are too cynical about social movements and trends; virality and popularity, despite âinauthentic intentionsâ, often do more good than harm.Â\n\n9. How can the highly polarised discussion concerning COVID vaccines become more productive?\n\nAnother thing you may have witnessed from living in a post-COVID world is an increase in how divided simple issues seem to make us. Ever tried to convince a relative or friend that, no, in fact, vaccines are not designed to implant us with microchips - seems impossible right?Â\n\nFor many people, the pandemic was a tipping point into full-blown conspiracy communities, meaning people are increasingly able to exist within their own social-media realities that donât need to be bound to scientific truth or objective fact. This all creates a division between those with different beliefs that is somehow wider than before, where we canât even agree on simple statements of truth.Â\n\nThe debate around what to do about this deals with questions of human psychology, social media (again), but also freedom of speech. Should spreading (potentially dangerous) false information that conflicts with scientific consensus be allowed on social media? Most importantly, how do we encourage actual communication between different sides?\n\nPossible contentions:\n\nTalking in person is the only way for people with vastly different beliefs to find common ground.\n\nThose spreading dishonest and dangerous conspiracy theories about public health cannot be reasoned with, and need to be actively shut down wherever they appear.\n\n10. With the infamous Oscar slap, what âconsequencesâ should comedians and satirists face for what they say?\n\nHereâs a news story that youâre probably tired of hearing about! Actor Will Smithâs act of violence against Oscar host and comedian Chris Rock for a joke about his wifeâs alopecia (hair loss) caused many different conversations to happen at once; about toxic masculinity, celebrity culture, violence as a spectacle. These are all totally valid angles for your Oral Presentation, but letâs focus on maybe the most common debate; did Chris Rock deserve this?Â Â\n\nFunctioning as a comedian hosting an awards night, Rockâs job was to poke fun at everyone participating, and these sorts of roles have often involved controversial comments and jokes. Does this mean they have immunity from any consequences for their words though? What should these consequences look like? And, if we excuse smaller acts of violence, what does that normalise?Â\n\nThe 2015 terrorist shooting of the staff of satirical French magazine âCharlie Hebdoâ for their depiction of the Islamic prophet may seem a world away from Will Smithâs slap, but some may argue that this is the logical end-point for a world that believes physical violence is the way to deal with jokes people donât like.Â\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nThe idea of comedians actually being threatened by violence is overblown; the slap was an isolated incident.\n\nProtecting the safety of those who make controversial jokes is paramount to maintaining freedom of speech.\n\n11. With Optus and Telstraâs recent data breaches, is placing all our valuable personal information in virtual spaces sustainably safe?Â\n\nThis year saw a record-level data breach from one of Australiaâs leading telecommunications companies, Optus. The personal details of almost 10 million customers were given to the hackers.Â\n\nThen, two weeks later, a similar data breach happened at Telstra. Yes, this time, no customer information was leaked, but information on the companyâs employees was again released.Â\n\nAll of this may disturb the image we all have in our heads of online databases as relatively unbreachable, locked away behind thousands of firewalls somewhere in the cloud. In fact, much of modern society operates on this assumption. Maybe youâve added your credit card details to your Chrome tab because it makes online purchases easier? This convenience comes with the implicit assumption that online personal info is pretty much always safe when protected by a big tech company, but these events arguably prove otherwise.Â Â\n\nCyberattacks are âincreasing as a threatâ, yet danger for the sake of convenience is something that all of us deal with. Maybe you think there are degrees to this; should we draw a line at information that can cause us legitimate harm if given to a malicious party?Â Â\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nOur society is already too technologically dependent to try and âgo offlineâ for the sake of data safety.\n\nValuables of any kind are always going to run the risk of being stolen, and digital piracy is no different.\n\n12. What is the role of Western countries in resisting the unlawful Russian invasion of Ukraine?\n\nAs already mentioned, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of the biggest news stories of 2022. Putinâs unlawful decision to attack the countryâs capital in February of 2022 has left more than 10,000 people dead and millions displaced from their homes. Virtually all world leaders condemned this act immediately. Yet, almost a year later, the war continues, and documented war crimes occur on Ukrainian soil.\n\nThinking larger than just social media, the question of what can actually be done to help by the countries who condemn this war has naturally emerged. Many nations have supported Ukraine financially, including the US giving nearly $20 billion. Some may argue that this is not nearly far enough, and that all world powers have a responsibility to wage direct war against Russia in support of Ukraine. Naturally though, many are strongly against Western intervention in this form, believing that countries like the US should not see themselves as all-knowing powers that can intervene in other nations based on their ideological beliefs.Â\n\nâPossible Contentions:\n\nAny attempt to guilt individual citizens about their need to âdo something about Ukraineâ is completely unfair; the responsibility for any meaningful action is entirely on the government.\n\nThe West, particularly the US, has a long history of militarily invading smaller nations for their own purposes; their condemnation of the Russians is hypocritical.\n\nIf you hav"
