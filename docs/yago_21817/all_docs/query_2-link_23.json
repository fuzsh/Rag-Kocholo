        "text": "Samantha has recently become a 9th grader. Since her arrival to ASH two years ago, her passion and dedication have led her to become deeply involved in various initiatives aimed at making her school and community more environmentally conscious and socially responsible.\n\nShowing Leadership in Sustainability\n\nAs the co-leader of the Sustainability Club, Samantha has spearheaded several impactful projects. One of the club’s focuses this year has been to make sure the school’s food waste is composted. By prioritizing the use and awareness of our community to use GFT (Vegetable, Fruit & Garden Waste) bins, the club has moved the school a step closer to reducing the school's environmental footprint.\n\nDuring Earth Week, Samantha helped organize numerous events, including a visit from sustainability expert Anna Rynearson, a poster drawing contest, and a booth at the International Festival focusing on fast fashion, food waste, and the importance of separating trash. These activities were not only educational but also aimed at fostering a sense of responsibility among students.\n\nSamantha's journey in sustainability was significantly shaped by the opportunities available to her at ASH. \"Ever since I came to ASH, I've been presented with all these opportunities to learn about sustainability,\" she reflects. These include attending sustainability conferences in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and The Hague. These conferences, often student-led, provided platforms for learning, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas, which Samantha found very powerful.\n\nCollaboration is at the heart of Samantha's approach to sustainability. \"If you come together with other like-minded people with similar passions and interests, I feel like a lot can get done,\" she says. Educating others is equally important to her. \"If you know about it, it's easier to care about it,\" she notes, emphasizing the role of awareness in driving action.\n\nLeading by Inclusion\n\nSamantha credits Lina, her co-leader, for helping start the club and leading the younger students in Middle School. Working with younger kids in the club is not only a way to create a tighter-knit group among Middle Schoolers, but it is also a good way to obtain diverse perspectives and initiatives for the club, and create an inclusive environment for collaboration and exchange. \"They come up with a ton of good ideas, and we older kids can provide guidance and help translate their ideas into action,\" she explains.\n\nFor Samantha, there are many sides to being a good leader. “You definitely need to have a vision and positive intentions. People naturally hop on to that. Also, to have knowledge and be willing to learn so we don’t end up lost or stuck’”.\n\nSupporting Cancer Research\n\nSamantha also co-led the St. Baldrick’s event in March, a fundraiser for the Princess Máxima Center in Utrecht, which supports children's cancer research. \"We raised 11,000 euros! It was a big surprise,\" she shares. This initiative highlighted her ability to mobilize her peers and the community for a cause. The St. Baldrick’s event was an example of how a simple idea - of getting a haircut - could grow into a significant campaign. Samantha herself together with a number of other staff and students donated their hair, or went for the full buzz. \"We did a lot of communication efforts to get the word out there. It was a big surprise to be so successful,\" she recalls.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nSamantha's future aspirations are deeply rooted in environmentalism. She aims to help her community become more aware and sustainable, believing that change starts from within. \"We need to take a look at ourselves first and our own community and then look farther away. It's like a ripple effect,\" she says.\n\nSamantha's journey from a Middle School student to a High School leader in sustainability is a testament to the impact that dedication, collaboration, and education can have on creating a greener, more socially responsible world."
