        "text": "What do you get when you’re a female musician and you make music which people think sounds like a vacuum cleaner?\n\nMade fun of.\n\nWhat an extraordinarily awful way to introduce Shoegaze, but honestly, how else has it ever been introduced? It’s always been a joke, maybe it’s because it has a funny name and people really do stare at their shoes when working those funky little guitar pedal things. Maybe it’s worth more than just humor though, maybe something else is there.\n\nIn this piece, I’ll be starting a new series of articles about what May Or May Not Be Misogyny in the Music World, and today, I’m starting with a rather monolithic genre: Shoegaze. For the uninitiated few who may have made the brave choice to read this article without having any interest in Shoegaze to begin with, artists in this genre often utilize reverberation and generally harsh guitar-based tones, along with vocals which are generally put at the same level as any other instrument on the track. The tone of voice which shoegaze vocalists take on is often breathy, and is described as “dreamy” or “sleepy” at times. For the purposes of this article, I will be grouping Dream Pop in the same genre as Shoegaze, although some people choose to denote differences between the two.\n\nThree of the best bands to come out of (and start) this genre were Cocteau Twins, My Bloody Valentine, and Slowdive. Different people argue what the “big three” of Shoegaze should or shouldn’t be, but in my opinion, these bands were the most critical to the foundation and continuation of the genre as a whole. What’s important to note about these bands is that all three had female vocalists. (Note: Although a huge amount of Shoegaze bands are fronted by men, I am highlighting the founders of the genre instead of those who continued it. Bands like DIIV, Ride, and Airiel are cool too, I’m just not talking about them here.) Cocteau Twins had Elizabeth Fraser (the woman who arguably started it all) blending her voice with instrumentation to create a sound which immersed the listener and created a new kind of atmosphere which really hadn’t been seen before. Rachel Goswell of Slowdive’s soft vocal style contrasted with the other musician’s of Slowdive’s tone and essentially made their sound what it was, she was also innovative in her style of playing guitar to boot. Goswell was a member of Mojave 3 as well, another seminal band of the Shoegaze genre. Bilinda Butcher of My Bloody Valentine’s voice and “backing vocals” were considered to be one of the most important hallmarks of MBV’s sound on their genre-defining album Loveless.\n\nAlong with Loveless, the albums Souvlaki by Slowdive, and Heaven Or Las Vegas by Cocteau Twins were some of the most sonically interesting and inventive records of their time. To this day, many musicians are noted to have cited these albums as an influence. Even if artists haven’t outwardly confirmed the fact that they were inspired by music like this, it’s so apparent in their sound that they ripped a few pages from the bible of Shoegaze. All bedroom pop and bedroom pop adjacent music today (Clairo, Banes World, Ricewine, Her’s… etc) took their concept of atmosphere straight from Shoegaze. Musicians like Tame Impala, Beach House, and Grimes did the same. Even (and especially) Mac Demarco has been caught red handed taking elements from Shoegaze. Just listen to the ringing backdrop of My Kind Of Woman by Demarco and compare it to When You Sleep by My Bloody Valentine, or Cherry-coloured Funk by Cocteau Twins. The similarities are undeniably there.\n\nSo, why isn’t Shoegaze talked about more in the music canon? Why is it a joke to so many people? I’m not going to come out and say that it’s 100% Pure Refined Sexism which is the reason for Shoegaze’s near-burial, but I would be lying if I didn’t think it was at least an element. Why is it that music that is typically performed by and enjoyed by women gets such a bad rap, even if it changes everything? Is there any specific element about Shoegaze which makes people just refuse to take it seriously, besides the fact that music made by and influenced by women is often taken as a joke? Does anyone ever ask why jokes about Shoegaze are funny, or how they got to be funny in the first place? I’ll be the first to admit that I think it’s hilarious when people say things like “These Vacuum Noises Changed My Life” when referring to Loveless, and I do think the fact that some people (you know who you are…) were tricked by their parents into thinking that Elizabeth Fraser invented her own language to sing in is absolutely hilarious, but there’s something else there. Critical thinking needs to be a bigger part of our understanding of music history. This is just one thing which got kind of kicked under the rug, what other sounds are we not taking into account? Who else are we forgetting to credit?\n\nIt’s so easy to brush off discussions like these, especially since joking about music in this way is so genuinely fun. I’m not saying that people should stop making wisecracks about it all, I’m just asking for something more constructive. In addition to the jokes, think critically. Look at everything that the genre did for music, and give appreciation (rather than deprecation) a shot. Understanding the reasons why music is the way it is makes listening so much more enjoyable, and in turn, better equips you to figure out what makes it all sound so good. Shoegaze is thought provoking, captivating, influential, and humorous. Don’t let it’s current legacy make you take it at just surface level. Dig deeper and find more, not just in the genre, but in your own thoughts about what music should be. Give Shoegaze a shot please, I’m tired of being made fun of for liking the vacuum music.\n\nPost-reading song list, so you can pick up what I’m putting down, if you want:\n\nLorelei by Cocteau Twins\n\nMachine Gun by Slowdive\n\nCome in Alone by My Bloody Valentine\n\nMesmerise by Chapterhouse (Ashley Bates drumming)\n\nWinona by Drop Nineteens\n\nI Don’t Care by LSD and the Search for God\n\nPancake by Swirlies"
