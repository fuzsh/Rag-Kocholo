        "text": "Shoegaze. What is it?\n\nShoegaze is a subgenre of alt-rock, that takes elements of 60s psychedelic rock and mixes it with punk and pop to make a wall of noise. The genre breaks out of the typical rock mould, it still follows a 4×4 beat but what shoegaze does is it explores new ways of playing rock music. Making it into more of a dream-like experience than your typical alt-rock band. The guitars are heavily soaked with Fuzz, Reverb, Delay, Flangers and sometimes played in an unconventional way. The guitar was used as a tool for making noise rather than a typical chord progression. A lot of shoegaze bands used guitars like a Fender Jazzmasters or Jaguars for the use of the tremolo system. Which allows the use to bend chords out of key and time. The drums are a simple 4×4 rock beat in the style of 80s new wave or early punk keeping the song together while giving it space. The vocal is normally very reverb and spaced out like the guitars. The are often sung very low and slow, the lyrics cover topics of heartbreak, sorrow, and drug use.\n\nShoegaze originated from the UK in the mid-80s and became quite popular in the early 90s. The term shoegaze was created by the media to help journalist and audiences understand what the genre was. They came up with the term due to the bands, who mostly stood still looking at the floor while they played, this was because of all the effects they used. (McKinstry, 2015).\n\nThe bands that helped push the genre forward during the early and late 80s were bands like The Jesus and Marry Chain, Cocteau Twins, My Bloody Valentine and Ride. The early sound was still in the grips of new wave but things were about to change and become what we know as shoegaze today.\n\nBelow is a playlist of bands that set the way for shoegaze:\n\nDuring the early 90s, Shoegaze slowly started to become more popular over the UK. This was thanks to bands like My Bloody Valentine releasing their groundbreaking album “Loveless” which helped push the genre to an oversea audience. Because of the success of My Bloody Valentine, bigger art/alt-rock bands like Sonic youth and Dinosaur Jr started to ask bands like Ride, My Bloody Valentine, and Swervedriver to tour the UK. At the time shoegaze started to rise in popularity, Brit-pop and grunge started to take over and slowly push shoegaze out of the limelight.\n\nHere is a review of “Loveless” by Anthony Fantano.\n\nBelow is a playlist of bands that become household names:\n\nThe characteristics of Shoegaze\n\nLet’s have a look at a track and see what makes it shoegaze. The song I will be breaking down is called “When The Sun Hits” by Slowdive.\n\nThe track is a straight forward song that has a simple 4×4 beat and typical songwriting method of intro/verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus. The track is also played in the G Flat minor key set to a slow tempo of 93 Bpm. Slow tempo was a common thing and a big part of the genre. The song is quite slow but the drums keep up a fast pace. There aren’t many changeovers, the song mostly consists of extended verses and choruses thats are played at the same tempo and even chord progression.\n\nBelow is the layout of the song.\n\nfile:///C:/Users/Bec/Desktop/Slowdive%20-%20When%20the%20Sun%20Hits.html\n\nThe guitars are bright played through reverb and delay which have been set to bounce between each guitars chords and notes to create a stereo effect of sorts. Even know the guitars are soaked in effects they stay pretty clean but sit at the higher end of the frequency chart. The guitarists use delay as a tool to slowly build up the verses to an explosive chorus. Leading the way for a fuzzed out guitar that takes the lead of the songs chord progression. While the clean delayed guitar plays the same chords as the verse. This is seen a lot with shoegaze because the songs are quite slow and more of an emotion journey, because of this the guitar normally plays the same chord progression during the duration of the song. But use effects as a tool to build and expand the song into a form of a chorus and outro.\n\nThe bass is thick and tight, it also sits pretty low within the mix, When listening to the bass it doesn’t have any kind of effects added it really. It almost sounds like it could have a compressor and an enhancer pedal to give it the thick mid range.\n\nThe drums are fairly basic and sound highly compressed and also heavily reverb to fit the rest of the track/band. The beat is a simple 4×4 snare and kick beat and keeps fairly the same during the song and mostly features during the most explosive parts like the choruses and outros.\n\nThe vocal is rich and extremely warm, they are also heavily soaked in reverb like the rest of the track. The reverb sound like a small hall or church setting, full but has a short tail, almost like its heading upwards.\n\nShoegaze didn’t stay very popular due to the rise of Britpop, but it did stay popular amongst critics and fellow musicians. A lot of Alt- Rock acts today give the nod to a lot of shoegaze bands and list them as their influence. For example, Pitchfork released a full documentary on the rise and fall of Slowdive a band that suffered the most from the rise of Britpop.\n\nBelow is the Doco about the rise and fall of Slowdive.\n\nRefrences\n\nDavid Bastedo.
