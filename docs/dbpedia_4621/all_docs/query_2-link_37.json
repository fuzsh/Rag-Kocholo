Slowdive actually did not. The group hurriedly began writing songs in the studio, experimenting with sounds and cannabis during the process. This eventually leads to their debut album Just for a Day, released in 1991. Highlights from this album include \"Celia's Dream,\", \"Erik's Song\", \"Catch The Breeze\" and \"Waves\".\n\nHeavyweight audiophile vinyl produced by Music On Vinyl for Creation Records in 2020. UK Import."
