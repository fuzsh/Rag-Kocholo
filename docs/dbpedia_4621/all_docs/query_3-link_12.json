        "text": "I remember a few years back hearing people talk about \"shoegaze\" music. At first, I had no idea what they were talking about. When the bands that are associated with the genre were thrown about I said, \"Yeah, that's the kind of stuff I am into.\" I mean, I'm not hardcore into any one particular thing. As a musician I think it's important to have varied influences so as not to become a clone of something else, musically speaking.\n\nStill, there were a lot of ideas thrown around in different threads. A lot of ideas that I identified with. In a nutshell, here are some of those ideas. I am curious if anyone who feels they are really familiar with the genre cares to share their ideas on what this music is about.\n\n1) It's about a particular musical sound. Wavey, washed out reverb tones over long and droning progressions.\n\n2) It's about an attitude, an attitude of introversion. One where the performers are so involved in their music they stand lifeless gazing down at their pedalboard awaiting the next toe tap. Perhaps a sense of painful shyness keeps their gaze steady and undisturbed. An attitude where this type of performance would be the most comfortable for the performer.\n\n3) It's about effects use with instrumentation and pushing the sonic boundaries laid out before us.\n\nOr maybe it's about a combination of these things? Maybe it isn't about any of these things? If so, what does shoegaze mean to you? What are its defining characteristics?\n\nok, i'll discuss.\n\ni think its just a celebration of getting lost in a feeling, getting fully wrapped up in noise/atmosphere and a lot of times becoming part of it...\n\ni mean, i don't get the whole white boot, cowboy hat SRV Texas blues stuff, but some people FEEL it...\n\nbut i was listening to MBV's \"Isn't Everything\" on the bus this morning going to work... and it was just went so well with the dark sky and rain etc- i pretty much just lost consciousness until the bus stopped in the business district.\n\nof course people are going to characterize it by its most noticeable traits, b/c thats how people do things- but that often times will lead to bad analogies or comparisons... just like how people use to battle over the use of 'emo'.\n\ni think the biggest thing about shoegaze was just how lovely some of the sonic work was, and how much it stood out from other pop/rock/etc.\n\nWell as someone who was there and saw all of these bands, I can say that it mostly meant insanely boring live performances.\n\n*Most* of these bands had absolutely no stage presence (Boo Radleys esp.), all of the songs washed into one, and they'd left out the driving bass stuff that was part of the sound they were ripping (Dino Jnr, Sonic Youth, Can, etc.) because they seemed scared of being seen as at all sexy or groovy. Chapterhouse were the worst of all.\n\nBUT when it worked and had some groove it could be monumental. MBV, Pale Saints, and JAMC all put on great shows. AFIAK as I recall Flying Saucer Attack were the only band with enough cool ideas to do the drifting floating stuff well."
