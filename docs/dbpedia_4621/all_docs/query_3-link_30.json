Did you check out the number of musical styles you explored, and gaze at your favorite five genres? Maybe you were fascinated by a genre name you didn’t know before.\n\nThere are thousands of genres out there, including new ones that are created each year. The way we see it, coming up with new names or groupings for genres gives us loose categorizations to identify emerging genres or remodel familiar ones so they are more recognizable, representative, and holistic to our listeners and their communities.\n\nGenres like those listed in your Spotify Wrapped allow you to better identify the types of music that get you moving, catch your feels, or enable you to focus—and then find more of the same. Since music is made up of infinite types of sounds, styles, instruments, and lyrics, you can use the constellation of genres to help identify and define the sounds you like most."
