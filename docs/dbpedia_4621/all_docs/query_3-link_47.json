        "text": "Rob Ulitski - 21st June 2023\n\nLegendary indie-rock band Slowdive make a stunning comeback in Noel Paul's hypnotic nighttime promo for Kisses.\n\nThe video features Charlie, a 17-year-old Neapolitan, who gives rides to the people of Naples, transporting them through the ethereal city streets. With a pensive atmosphere and otherworldly aesthetic, the video is a strangely calm yet stirring piece of work, that reflects the lilting shoegaze track.\n\nNoel Paul worked on the project with longtime collaborator, Lebanese DoP Ramzi Hibri - who he started working with during his time living in Beirut in the early 2010s, as Paul explained on The Promonews Podcast a few months ago - and the video shares the quality of much of their work together, from that period through to the recent videos for Baxter Dury, Aylesbury Boy and Celebrate Me, and the beginning and end sequences on the UKMVA-winning video for black midi's Sugar/Tzu.\n\nBeautiful work which lingers long after watching.\n\nFeatured sponsors"
