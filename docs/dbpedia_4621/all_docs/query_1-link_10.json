        "text": "Everything comes and goes… and comes right back again. It’s the nature of our nostalgia-driven culture and the power of cross-referencing. More often than not, it isn’t too difficult to forecast the next trend or genre to make a comeback—after all there is no shortage of micro-influencers and trend forecasters on TikTok. However, once in a blue moon, the zeitgeist keeps us on our toes; this is the case with what many music journalists have identified to be the New Wave of American Shoegaze.\n\nShoegaze was an underground genre which took flight in the mid-’90s and eventually dissipated into other branches of alt-rock. The idea that it would make a triumphant return was not expected, but it's a great time for a wider audience to tap into the abundant well that is shoegaze.\n\nGenerally inspired by bands whose names have now become synonymous with the genre (My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Swirlies, etc.), a new generation of artists has expanded and diversified what it means to be a shoegaze act.\n\nGenerally inspired by bands whose names have now become synonymous with the genre (My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Swirlies, etc.), a new generation of artists has expanded and diversified what it means to be a shoegaze act. Whether it be by pushing boundaries to the wayside and allowing for juxtapositions like country-gaze (often used to describe acts like Wednesday), or simply refining the blueprint into something more modern (They Are Gutting a Body of Water, Wisp), it is a new and brighter day for shoegaze.\n\nHere at Pigeons & Planes, we recognize that it isn’t finding new artists that is difficult in this age of information overload, but rather deciding who to give your valuable attention to. There have been a handful of shoegaze acts drawing major attention recently (They Are Gutting a Body of Water, DIIV, feeble little horse, Wednesday, Wisp, flyingfish, Quannnic) but so many others worth checking out. With this in mind, we talked to five shoegaze bands on the rise, each of which is bringing their own flare to the genre's starry-eyed spectrum of sounds.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper, here's a playlist with favorites from these bands and more recommendations from the many strands of shoegaze's current generation.\n\nGlixen\n\nPhoenix, AZ’s Glixen is one of the best places to start your shoegaze renaissance journey. Launched mid-pandemic, the band's founding member and vocalist Aislinn Ritchie rounded up a few of her friends—Esteban Santanna (guitarist), Keire Johnson (drummer), and Sonia Garcia (bassist)—to join the project. Upon finding their footing in Phoenix’s DIY scene, their collective aesthetic and powerful sound allowed them to break out to the extent they were soon playing shows with heavy-hitters like Interpol and DIIV.\n\nA symbolic embodiment of what it means ‌to be a Gen Z shoegaze ensemble, Glixen has managed to amalgamate a wide range of influences, including My Bloody Valentine, Björk, Dead Can Dance, and Godflesh, into a cohesive sound and vision. The result: a plush yet dark soundscape that crashes over you in emotive and powerful waves. This bone-crushing blend hit the airwaves in 2023 via their debut EP She Only Said.\n\n“Glixen has always shared a love for heavier music. We always want to be louder.”\n\nWhile they started out leaning into the soft and hazy side of the shoegaze spectrum, Glixen will happily take any opportunity to increase their volume. Speaking on the steps they’ve taken and their desire to amplify, sonically and lyrically, guitarist Estaban Santanna shares, “Glixen has always shared a love for heavier music. We always want to be louder.”\n\nProof of this comes on their recent single “lust,” which showcases how well the band can conceptualize and deliver on their sonic vision. Perfectly balanced, while still honoring their original approach, “lust” shows us the alluring and imposing potential of Glixen's wall of sound.\n\nshe's green\n\nNothing beats the power of finding your creative twin flames. Take she’s green for example. Born out of vocalist Zofia Smith and guitarist Liam Armstrong’s mutual creative admiration, the duo found themselves eager to build a full band sound and enlisted their friends Raines Lucas, Teddy Nordvold, and Kevin Seebeck. The rest was history.\n\n“We cut our teeth in basements around Minneapolis and discovered how much fun we had playing live,” they tell us. Inspired by the likes of Cocteau Twins, Beach House, Yo La Tengo, Weyes Blood, Jefre Cantu-Ledesma, Lovesliescrushing, and Slow Pulp, as well as visual arts and their time spent in nature, she’s green’s sound is a meticulous blend of soaring melodies with midwestern and slowcore tendencies.\n\nLaying out their dichotomy they explain, “Originally we were drawn to the melodies of shoegaze. When we approach music, songwriting always comes first. We usually start at a very vulnerable place with acoustic guitars and raw vocal melodies. The textures in shoegaze allow for harshness and softness to coexist in a way that’s not always available with just acoustics.” As for the visual elements, “Visual art also heavily influences our music, and certain effects and tones can help us bring a cinematic feel to our songs. Oftentimes when we’re writing, we’ll try and describe a section of the song visually to understand what kind of emotion it should evoke. Having different tonal tools at your disposal gives you more freedom to cast different scenes in the music.”\n\nThese visual properties of their sound are apparent on their most popular song “Syndulla,” from their debut EP Wisteria. An emotionally charged anthem, much like the storm described in the chorus, “Syndulla” is the sonic embodiment of cathartic downpours.\n\n\"We hope the music reflects the feeling of belonging that accompanies you on a walk through the woods.”\n\nExpanding on the moments of emotional release and the visual world that accompanied their EP, the band reveals, “Environments also have a lot to do with our sound. We took a lot of inspiration from the scenes that surround us: rivers, lakes, prairies, and forests. We hope the music reflects the feeling of belonging that accompanies you on a walk through the woods.”\n\nAbove all, Wisteria encapsulated a certain coming-of-age period for the band, while also acting as a springboard for forward motion. “It [is] a culmination of our feelings and experiences growing up in the midwest. It’s the first hill before the mountain, something to be proud of. We’re excited to keep exploring sounds that deeply resonate with us.”\n\nFull Body 2\n\nAnother band that’s cultivated a sound of their own is none other than Full Body 2. Reunited following a break from their previous moniker (Full Body) during the pandemic, members Rose Hamond, Dylan Vaisey and Jack Chaffer see Full Body 2 as an opportunity to start anew. “When we broke up, lockdown had just started, and we found ourselves very online and inspired by the music we were discovering. We wanted to approach things differently, taking our time to see how far we could take our ideas,” they say.\n\nDrawn to the “simplicity, energy, and emotion” of shoegaze and inspired by video game soundtracks and bands they’re fond of (Sweet Trip, Blue Smiley, Rainsdeaf, and Purity://Filter) the band found their own way to mold the genre into something that honors their creative palette. Their 2023 EP Infinity Signature showcases the peaks and valleys of the sprawling musical landscape they inhabit.\n\n“[We] find ourselves wanting to create music that feels emotional and is as epic as possible. We ask ourselves if the song ‘hits’ throughout the whole creative process.\"\n\nOpening up about the process behind their cinematic sound, they say, “[We] find ourselves wanting to create music that feels emotional and is as epic as possible. We ask ourselves if the song ‘hits’ throughout the whole creative process. We often find ourselves referencing a journey undertaken in another world, dreamlike places, powerful memories.”\n\nHaving found their niche among the sea of newer shoegaze adjacent acts, Full Body 2 is looking forward to fine-tuning not only their sound but also the visual world that accompanies their discography. “We’re working on our first full-length album. We’ve also been getting into light programming after touring with George Clanton, who built his own light show. We brought in our friend John Foresman to develop a light show with us and we’ll be gradually making our light show more reactive to us on stage as we get better at programming, creating worlds for each song. We want to try and make our shows more of an experience.”\n\nKnifeplay\n\nA lot of the beauty in shoegaze comes from its way of turning the supercuts of our daily lives into romantic experiences. Offering a perfect blend of shoegaze and dream pop, Knifeplay possesses a knack for creating soundtrack-worthy projects that stir a certain lust and wonder for life.\n\nInspired by classic shoegaze acts (My Bloody Valentine, Swirlies), legendary lyricists like Bob Dylan and Neil Young, and that eye-watering sense of bliss felt when a song hits just right, Knifeplay’s discography feels singular. “I remember that wild, private, emotional feeling I had as a kid with my first musical connections. I’m always chasing that feeling with what I listen to and what I try to create,” says TJ Strohmer, who founded the band, about that one-in-a-million feeling.\n\n“I remember that wild, private, emotional feeling I had as a kid with my first musical connections. I’m always chasing that feeling with what I listen to and what I try to create.\"\n\nBrimming with those awe inducing moments, as well as a heavyweight sound and emotional complexity, their last LP Animal Drowning has a subtle way of latching onto your psyche, evoking those emotive exchanges which all music lovers yearn for. Building a bridge between the dark essence of shoegaze and the reflexive and iridescent world of dream pop, Animal Drowning is a safe haven that yields a unique experience.\n\nPrior to Animal Drowning, Knifeplay’s debut record, Pearlty (2019) was conceived between 2015 and 2018 during a slew of bedroom recording sessions, alongside two EPs (No Funeral and with u). Reflecting on the album, Strohmer says, “I was inspired to start recording songs for what would become Knifeplay after hearing Swirlies and My Bloody Valentine for the first time in my friend’s car in 2014. I was a young person with little direction in life, experiencing a big city for the first time, and the entire attitude behind shoegaze felt like a perfect soundtrack to that experience.”\n\nRecognizing the “bedroom” essence of Pearlty, TJ reflects, \"It will always be special to me because I know that labor went into it [...] I don’t think I was trying that hard because I was so inspired by a new world of music I was still uncovering. And also learning how to make music simultaneously.” In 2024, Knifeplay revisited the debut album, taking the opportunity to polish and master it for a re-release, bringing it to a place where they could comfortably turn a new leaf.\n\nSpeaking of turning a new leaf and evolving with one’s art, Knifeplay is ready to share new aspects of their sound. “Nowadays the things I’m passionate about have changed, and the tone and colors of my life has changed, so my inspirations have changed with it. I’m looking forward to showing our audience what that looks and sounds like.” Coming down from a tour with alt-rock band RIDE, and slowly working their way towards a third LP, Knifeplay’s dedication to creating starry-eyed soundtracks remains unshakable.\n\nall under heaven\n\nSometimes there is no harm in dusting off old ideas, or in this case an entire band. Bassist Michael Cucci heard some old demos and proposed to lead singer Nick Defabritus the idea of bringing back the band he had started in high school. Joined by drummer Aaron and Jake on guitar, all under heaven was reborn.\n\nArmed with an alt-rock infused shoegaze sound, all under heaven has amassed quite the cult following. Starting with their debut EP Collider (2021), which features soaringly ambitious tracks like the opener “Desperately Seeking Answers” and starry segments like “Afterthought,” it laid down much of the groundwork for what the band grew to become in the last three years.\n\nNow showing the world exactly what they are made of, all under heaven's June debut LP What Lies Ahead of Me showcases a certainty in their sound and a healthy evolution. “Always” and “Receiving Certain Answers,” released prior to the LP, were a sure-footed introduction to an album on which the band adds drum machines and synthesizers to their armory, while DeFabritus’ voice bursts through more confidently than ever before.\n\nSpeaking on the behind the scenes of it all DeFabritus shares, “All I can say is that I am really proud of the LP and excited for everyone to hear it. Our process is usually I, or Aaron and I, will write songs and then we record them in the studio all together. This is the first time where Aaron, our drummer, wrote a couple songs on his own instead of it just being me writing them or us writing a song together, which I think is cool.”\n\nAn especially unique time for all under heaven fans and admirers, What Lies Ahead of Me marks an important period in the band's existence as they step out with a new outlook and aura."
