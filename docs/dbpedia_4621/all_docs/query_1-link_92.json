        "text": "By Zack Yusof\n\nAug 17, 2017\n\nHow times have changed. Today, shoegaze is generally regarded as one of the coolest and hippest indie movements around with pioneering bands of the scene like My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Swervedriver and Slowdive having reformed to critical and commercial acclaim and plenty of young new bands stocking up on guitar effect pedals aplenty in a bid to borrow its trademark wall-of-sound guitar and whispered pop melodies aesthetic.\n\nBut back in the day when it first began to take off in the late eighties/ early nineties, shoegaze was actually far from being considered cool or innovative. In fact, most of the music journos at the English music weeklies were pretty hostile towards shoegaze, viewing it as an ineffectual and weak collection of noisy but twee bands who would never amount to anything other than a passing underground fad. Not built to last, reckoned the journos.\n\n“Shoegazing” the word, was actually first coined as a diss to mock how the band Moose stared shyly at their shoes during an early gig of theirs instead of giving it the typical rock star ego-trip treatment by a journalist from the now defunct Brit music weekly Sounds in a live review. The fact that singer Russell was performing new songs by reading off a lyric sheet taped to the stage rather than examining his own footwear throughout the show was irrelevant. The die was cast: shoegaze was not cool.\n\nAnother derogative name for the shoegaze movement bandied about at the time was “The Scene That Celebrates Itself”, referring to how the whole scene was a bit incestuous with bands from the scene turning up at each others’ gigs and hanging out together as if that was a heinous crime against rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nIn the end, all the bands from the scene were desperate to distance themselves from shoegaze, a getting labelled as such was seemingly terminal to one’s career. Funnily enough, a lot of the bands who turned their backs on shoegaze back then ended up being the same ones who were only too happy to reform in order to ride/cash in on the movement’s renewed popularity when the time came.\n\nAnyway, the whole scene was considered a bit of a joke by the music journos of the time. The name ‘shoegazing’ stuck and became the fashionable term used by lazy hacks to bash bands of a similar lack of stage presence and guitar pedal board size. How ironic then that today, shoegaze is alive, well, and positively thriving while most of the English music weeklies have been consigned to editorial history.\n\nWith shoegaze currently enjoying a renaissance period, what better time than the present to bust out a compilation of some of the most essential classic and modern tracks from the movement. So sitting alongside originators like Moose, Cocteau Twins and Pale Saints, we have new names like Sweden’s Dead Vibrations (pic below) and Dream Rimmy from Perth Australia, both of whom are flying the flag for the scene today in show-stealing, sonic cathedral-esque fashion.\n\nTalk about a beautiful noise, this compilation is designed to hit the spot if your musical preference is for loud, distorted, effected guitar wash paired with hazy dreamlike melodies bathed in reverb and atmospheric soundscapes. So sit back, turn the volume up and lose yourself in the gorgeous maelstrom. xx"
