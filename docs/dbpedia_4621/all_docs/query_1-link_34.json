        "text": "Okay, shoegaze fans, here it is. Over ten hours from 132 contemporary artists to satiate your appetite. Strap in, adjust your volume accordingly (how much feedback can one’s ears take in one sitting, I wonder?), and lose yourself in the bliss-inducing, fuzzy splendour of modern shoegaze.\n\nWhen writing the profile on the first generation of shoegaze artists, I was struck by how many contemporary artists were being served up during my research. From what I heard, a lot of it was very good, prompting me to dive in further. I set about creating this bookend, of sorts, to that first-generation profile to show both who was carrying the torch in modern times and how today’s sounds compare to those of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s (spoiler alert… not much different).\n\nCompiling this playlist quickly revealed just how many artists there are in this genre. Given the esoteric nature of shoegaze, this also ends up being a large list of obscure acts from all over the world, most with only an album or two to their credit. Therefore, the best approach to this was to simply serve up a large playlist and let you sample as you wish. And while I’ll offer a couple details for each act to save you looking them up, the purpose of this profile is to create exposure for these acts and the genre in its current day form.\n\nFirst, a quick refresher on what is shoegaze. Primarily, it is dreamy, layered, guitar driven rock music with an emphasized use of fuzz. It can range from rock oriented, heavy, driving sounds to lighter, jangly, dream pop. The vocals are usually buried in, or echoing above, the mix and there is often a lot of repetition and droning rhythms. The goal is often to create an aural landscape – a mood – more than a sharply delivered message. This is abstract art, not realism, though it can catch you with both subtlety and power. Shoegazers got their nickname from the guitarists staring at their effects pedals, so embellished, wall-of-sound is the modus operandi. It’s also a genre with a healthy participation rate from women, which is always a refreshing change from most forms of rock.\n\nThe influence of shoegaze and dream pop has been pervasive in modern rock over the past thirty years. Heck, even Coldplay incorporated it (albeit slightly) into their 2008 LP, Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends LP. Therefore, setting some boundaries was required to keep the playlist even to this lengthy result. The basic rules for inclusion are that the song had to be released this century, the shoegaze/dream pop sound had to be its essential quality, the artist had to employ the style across their discography with some consistency (sorry Coldplay), and only one song was selected per artist.\n\nI excluded many acts from this list which I’ve seen labelled as shoegaze but found they were more adjacent than a pure fit. There are many variants that mix fuzzy guitars and echoey vocals into songs that are more focused on electronics (often in place of guitar) and beats, indie-jangle pop, psychedelia, or metal. There are still several selections in this list that straddle the line.\n\nAs a result of these rules of selection and the omission of adjacent acts, this list is very consistent sounding to the original shoegaze styles. Yet, it’s still impressive how many artists are diligently and superbly pledging allegiance to continuing the lush, loud, caustic sounds of this fantastic genre. It is far from dying out and thank heavens for that.\n\n1. \"Repetitive Monotonous\" \\ All Natural Lemon & Lime Flavors (2000) – By the late 1990s, shoegaze was no longer the sole domain of the UK, as evidenced by acts such as this, a quartet hailing from New Jersey in the States. The band issued two LPs in 1996 and 1998 along with a few singles over those years. Not exactly a new millennium act, I’m cheating here as “Repetitive Monotonous” (is there a better shoegaze title?) was from the 1996 single, “I Am Where You Were,” but was also released in 2000 on the singles compilation, Straight Blue Line.\n\n2. \"Illumination\" \\ Broadcast (2000) – As much as guitar is the signature instrument of shoegaze acts, electronics have been frequently used and often prominently. Electronica acts have also used the style to achieve shoegaze and dream pop results, whether a guitar was mixed in or not. Broadcast, primarily a duo of Trish Keenan (vocals/keyboards/guitar) and James Cargill (bass), was formed in Birmingham, England in 1995 and employed a dreamy, psychedelic approach to their electronics. After releasing several singles and EPs from 1996, there were three LPs from 2000 to 2005 followed by a mini-LP in 2009 and a soundtrack in 2013 before the band called it quits. “Illumination” is from their 2000 EP, Extended Play Two, and reveals the band’s gauzy mix of electronics, guitar, and dream pop vocals.\n\n3. \"Diamond\" \\ Duster (2000) – Formed in San Jose, California, this duo tended to be linked more to the slowcore, emo, and noise rock genres, for which when you combine those elements you get… shoegaze. After releasing LPs in 1998 and 2000 as well as a few EPs, the band shut things down before returning to release two more LPs in 2019 and 2022. This will be a theme throughout this playlist as the reinvigorated interest in shoegaze and dream pop over the past ten years has instigated the reformation of many ‘90s acts that were largely ignored during their first stints. “Diamond” is from the 2000 LP, Contemporary Movement.\n\n4. \"crasher\" \\ Astrobrite (2001) – Another 1990s act that spilled into the new century, this was the solo enterprise of Scott Cortex, who has worked with a lengthy list of contributors and has been based out of both the US and Japan. After releasing a half dozen EPs between 1994 and 1999, he issued his first LP in 2001, Crush, which included, “crasher.” Astrobrite has since released ten more LPs with the latest being, Deluxer, in 2015.\n\n5. \"Moon Like A Pearl\" \\ Pia Fraus (2001) - hailing from the unlikely shoegaze locale of Estonia, this collective has been consistently issuing music since their 2001 debut LP, Wonder What Its Like. They are now up to six albums and over a dozen Eps, with the French Exit EP being the latest release just this year (2023).\n\n6. \"To Myself\" \\ SIANspheric (2001) – Canada has long been a healthy supporter of shoegaze acts, but it didn’t take until the late 1990s until we started to see bands originating from the Great White North. This quartet came out of Hamilton, Ontario in 1994 and released their first album in 1995. During a fifteen year break between their 2001 third LP and their 2016 fourth, there were a series of EPs issued in the interim. “To Myself” is taken from their third album, The Sound of the Colour of the Sun.\n\n7. \"Long Beach\" \\ Bethany Curve (2001) – Another California outfit, this quartet from Santa Cruz formed in 1994 and issued an indie cassette in 1995 prior to their first LP the same year. After issuing five LPs up to 2003, a sixth didn’t arrive until 2019. “Long Beach” is from their fourth LP, You Brought Us Here.\n\n8. \"Glass In My Mouth\" \\ Highspire (2001) – Info on this band is a bit inconsistent. Formed by Alex White and EJ Hagen, listings show it as everything from a trio to a quintet. Their debut LP, Your Everything, is shown as being released in 2001, 2003, or 2004. They are definitely from Pennsylvania, though different sources state either Lancaster or Philadelphia as their origin. However, there is a community and high school named Highspire in Dauphin County, near Lancaster, which makes me wonder if that’s their namesake. They also issued a second LP in 2010 (or 2011).\n\n9. “Don’t Say Slow” \\ Skywave (2001) – This trio hailed from Fredericksburg, Virginia and were formed in 1995. They released six albums between 1998 and 2008 along with several EPs. “Don’t Say Slow” was first issued as the title track to a 2001 EP in 2001, then as a single in 2002 before being included on their 2004 LP, Synthstatic.\n\n10. \"Slow You Down\" \\ Air Formation (2002) – Only our second English act on this list so far, it shows how much the shoegaze sound had blossomed outside of its UK origins. Formed in 1998, this band was originally called b.e.a.b. Approved, which was the British Electrotechnical Approvals Board, which issued electrical safety standards. Unsurprisingly, they were forced to change their name, choosing Air Formation in 2000. Their debut EP was issued in 2000 followed by their first LP, Ends in Light, in 2002, from which “Slow You Down” is selected. They have issued five LPs and seven EPs, with the 2018 album, Near Miss, being the most recent.\n\n11. \"Waiting\" \\ Monster Movie (2002) – This UK act was originally formed in 1989 by Christian Savill and Sean Hewson, who played together in a band, Eternal, that was a precursor to shoegaze luminary, Slowdive, of which Savill was a member. The duo had released a single in 1990 before splitting for their different projects. When Slowdive went on to become Mojave 3, Savill parted ways and reunited with Hewson in 1999 to form Monster Movie (a name suspected to be taken from the title of the 1969 debut LP by heavy shoegaze influencer and Krautrock act, Can). There followed EPs in 2001 and 2002 and six LPs between 2002 and 2017. The most recent releases have included members of Air Formation and Slowdive.\n\n12. \"On Our Own\" \\ The Meeting Places (2003) – Formed in Los Angeles in 2001 by four guitarists, such a line-up could only result in a shoegaze act, even if two of them ended up on drums and bass. Two albums were released in 2003 to 2006 followed by an EP in 2019 (this ‘gap’ trend seems quite entrenched, doesn’t it?).\n\n13. \"Here Comes Everybody\" \\ Autolux (2004) – A trio also from L.A., this act has flirted with shoegaze as much as they’ve leaned direct into it. Perhaps the most accomplished of the acts we’ve heard so far on this list, they released three albums in 2004, 2010, and 2016.\n\n17. \"Go and Come Back\" \\ Fleeting Joys (2006) - California certainly embraced shoegaze, with this Sacramento duo as further evidence. Featuring spouses Rorika (bass/electronics/vocals) and John Loring (guitars/vocals), they issued two albums in 2006 and 2009 before releasing two more in 2019 and 2021. “Go and Come Back” is from their debut, Despondent Transponder.\n\n18. \"Silver\" \\ Jesu (2006) – Another act that blended metal with the caustic feel of shoegaze, this British band was formed in 2003 by Justin Broadrick, formerly of the band, Godflesh. There have been five LPs and a dozen EPs issued since 2004. “Silver” is the title track of a 2006 EP.\n\n19. \"Drain Cosmetics\" \\ Serena-Maneesh (2006) – Norway! Shoegaze was finding its way into Scandinavia, which somehow doesn’t seem surprising. A collective guided by songwriter, Emil Nikolaisen, the band has been around since 1999 and has released two albums and two EPs. “Drain Cosmetics” is from the 2005 eponymous debut LP and was the band’s first single, issued in 2006. It reveals the bands indie-rock sound with a shoegaze slant on the guitar sound.\n\n20. \"On High\" \\ Soundpool (2006) – This New York band revolved around vocalist Kim Field and guitarist John Ceparano. They released three albums and an EP between 2006 and 2011. After folding Soundpool in 2011, Field and Ceparano formed Stargazer Lilies, which we’ll visit later in this playlist. “On High” was the title track of their debut LP.\n\n21. \"A Star Is Born\" \\ Amusement Parks On Fire (2006) – Out of Nottingham, England, this band was formed in 2004 by Michael Feerick who started it as a solo act before expanding it to a quintet in 2005. They have released four LPs and eight EPs, with the LP, An Archaea, being the most recent in 2021. “A Star Is Born” is from second LP, 2006’s Out of the Angeles. Their shoegaze-rock sound was reminiscent of shoegaze pioneers, Swervedriver.\n\n22. \"I Know I'll See You\" \\ A Place to Bury Strangers (2007) – Another genre blending act, drawing from goth, electronica, and post-punk mixed with feedback strewn shoegaze spiciness, a la Jesus and Mary Chain. The New York trio was formed in 2002 and has released six LPs and a handful of EPs. “I Know I’ll See You” is from the self-titled, debut LP in 2007.\n\n23. \"Souvenirs d'un autre monde\" \\ Alcest (2007) – We’ll now get a taste of French shoegaze, with this solo project from Neige (Stéphane Paut). Coming out of metal acts, Neige brought that energy into his dreamier Alcest sound. He has released six albums and a couple EPs. “Souvenirs d’un autre monde” (“Memories from another world” in English) is the title track from the debut LP.\n\n24. \"23\" \\ Blonde Redhead (2007) – This celebrated indie trio from New York is often included in shoegaze lists, but their sound has been as likely to be completely outside the genre as in. However, their penchant for drone-noise compositions – especially early in their career – certainly makes them a credible entry. I’m particularly fond of their 2010 LP, Penny Sparkle, which while dreamy and gauzy in places, generally isn’t a shoegaze LP. However, “23,” the title track from their 2007 LP, certainly evinces enough shoegaze markers to qualify. Formed in 1993 by Kazu Makino and twin brothers, Simone and Amedeo Pace, the band has released nine LPs and three EPs, with the most recent being the 2017 EP, 3 O’Clock. Makino issued a solo LP in 2019 while Blonde Redhead toured in 2022, so the band remains active.\n\n25. \"Two Kinds\" \\ Film School (2007) – Another indie-rock act that is as likely to draw on shoegaze sounds as not, this San Francisco band was formed in 1998 and has released six LPs and three EPs over two stints in their career, featuring a three-year hiatus from 2011 to 2014. “Two Kinds” is from their third LP, Hideout, and shows how their jangly guitars and dreamy vocals could bring dream pop into their sound.\n\n26. \"This Time\" \\ LSD and the Search for God (2007) – Another San Francisco outfit, this quintet released their self-titled debut LP in 2007 and their second LP, Heaven Is A Place, not until 2016.\n\n27. \"Where Are the Flowers?\" \\ Rumskib (2007) – This band from Denmark started as a duo in 2001 before expanding to a quintet to tour in 2006. They only issued one, self-titled album in 2007.\n\n28. \"Blackout\" \\ Sennen (2007) – Taking their name from a Ride song, this English band was formed in 2002 and has achieved moderate success by creating an accessible rock sound built on shoegaze foundations. They have issued six albums and two EPs. “Blackout” was a single and the lead track from their second LP, Where the Light Gets In.\n\n29. \"Lost Memory\" \\ Secret Shine (2007) – Formed in 1991, this band from Bristol, England released one album and two EPs before breaking up in 1996. They reformed in 2004 after a compilation was released and to record music in tribute to their recently deceased drummer. They have since released four LPs and two EPs. “Lost Memory” is from their EP, Beyond Sea and Sky, and I had to research the credits for it to ensure it wasn’t a guest vocal from Tim Burgess (The Charlatans UK),.\n\n30. \"A Fading Smile\" \\ Alcian Blue (2007) – Hailing from Takoma Park, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., this quintet was formed in 1998 and released two albums and five EPs before disbanding in 2006. “A Fading Smile” is from their final EP, Years Too Late, released in 2007 after their demise and featuring unreleased tracks recorded earlier in their career.\n\n31. \"Flourescent Grey\" \\ Deerhunter (2007) – One of the better-known bands on this playlist, this Atlanta band was formed in 2001 and most of their music is of the psychedelic-indie-rock variety outside of the shoegaze genre. However, many tracks sprinkled throughout their discography venture into the dream pop realm, and when they layer in some fuzzy guitars, they get shoegaze consideration. “Flourescent Grey” is the title track from a 2007 EP, and while the first half falls into their indie-rock sound, the back half explodes into an unabashed shoegaze haze. The band has released eight albums and two EPs since 2005.\n\n32. \"And She Would Darken the Memory\" \\ The Twilight Sad (2007) – Scotland was arguably the birthplace of shoegaze, thanks to the likes of Cocteau Twins and Jesus and Mary Chain, so it’s a bit surprising it took list long to reach our first Scottish act. This band is, however, an uncomfortable fit for shoegaze. I include them since they frequently employ shoegaze elements into their songs and have a reputation for very loud shows (a shoegaze staple), even though its hard to find a pure shoegaze track in their discography. The trend I notice is a mix of indie-rock with occasional celtic folk, finished off with a rousing, gauzy finish over the back half or third of the track. This was exemplified, along with their penchant for long song titles, in their second single, “And She Would Darken the Memory,” released in 2007. The band formed in 2003 and issued their first EP in 2006, having now released six albums and five EPs.\n\n33. \"I Don't Love\" \\ Have A Nice Life (2008) – This duo of Dan Barrett and Tim Macuga is from Middletown, Connecticut. They formed in 2000 and have released three albums and two EPs since their debut in 2008, the LP Deathconsciousness.\n\n37. “I Heard You Call My Name” \\ Ceremony (2008) – With a band name like this, how could I deny them a spot on this playlist!? Blending post-punk vibes (hmmm, Joy Division?) with early Jesus & Mary Chain feedback guitars, this band was born out of the ashes of Skywave, one of the first bands we visited on this playlist. While Oliver Ackermann went off to New York to form A Place to Bury Strangers (also already featured on this list), Paul Baker and John Fedowitz formed Ceremony. They released three albums between 2008 and 2010.\n\n38. \"Ships Will Sail\" (w/ Pia Fraus) \\ Ulrich Schnauss (2008) – It’s a bit surprising there hasn’t been more shoegaze acts from Germany, given the influence of 1970s Krautrock on the shoegaze sound. Ulrich Schnauss, a recent member of seminal electronica act, Tangerine Dream, brings a distinct electronic slant to the genre. As much a producer as a musician, he started releasing music in 1995 and has also produced or remixed a long list of releases for other artists. Much of his music is pure electronica and ambient, but often builds his tracks into the requisite wall-of-sound with some guitar mixed in to achieve the shoegaze description. This track was a release with Estonian act, Pia Fraus, who we visited earlier in this playlist.\n\n39. \"Hypermode\" (w/ Ulrich Schnauss) \\ A Shoreline Dream (2009) – Schnauss also worked with the band, A Shoreline Dream, who are from Denver, Colorado. Together in 2008 they issued an EP, NeverChanger, along with three songs on the band’s LP, Recollections of Memory, from which “Hypermode” is taken. The band has released five albums in total from 2006 to 2022, along with seven EPs.\n\n40. \"Clean Coloured Wire\" \\ Engineers (2009) – This London based act also features Ulrich Schnauss (since 2010) and blends shoegaze with other sounds such as electronica, folk, and indie rock. Formed in London in 2003, they have released five albums. Their self-titled debut LP in 2005 reached the top 100 in the UK album chart. “Clean Coloured Wire” is taken from their second album, 2009’s Three Fact Fader, and offers a groovy, psychedelic, hypnotic, and electronic take on the shoegaze sound.\n\n41. \"Different Mirrors\" \\ Lotus Plaza (2009) – This is the solo side project of Lockett Pundt, the guitarist from the Atlanta band, Deerhunter (featured earlier on this playlist). He issued three albums under the name, Lotus Plaza, from 2009 to 2014. “Different Mirrors” is from the debut, The Floodlight Collective.\n\n42. \"Dream About Me\" \\ The Depreciation Guild (2009) – Active from 2005 to 2011 out of Brooklyn, New York, this quintet released two LPs and one EP. “Dream About Me” captures their lovely dream pop sound and was a single released in 2009, ahead of its inclusion on their second LP, Spirit Youth, released in 2010.\n\n43. \"Lovestruck\" \\ The Fauns (2009) – This is another act from Bristol, England, a quintet formed in 2007 who self-released their eponymous 2009 debut album. Its success led to a signing for their second and final album, 2013’s Lights.\n\n44. \"Georgia\" \\ Big Troubles (2010) – Another act from New Jersey, this duo was formed in 2009 when former high school friends, Alex Craig and Ian Drennan, reconnected after attending separate colleges. They issued two albums in 2010 and 2011, along with four EPs up to 2012. “Georgia” is from their first LP, Worry.\n\n45. \"Magics\" \\ Disappears (2010) – Like several others on this list, this band out of Chicago rode the line between garage rock and psychedelia and shoegaze, depending on how fuzzy the guitars got. A droning aspect could be assured either way, though as they moved on from their 2010 debut LP, Lux, their sound was less shoegaze oriented. Formed in 2008, the band briefly featured Sonic youth’s drummer, Steve Shelley, as a member. They released five albums before disbanding in 2016 (plus a live album, performing Bowie’s Low album in its entirety), with three of the four members persisting as a non-shoegaze act, FACS. In 2020, there was a release of the recording sessions from 2009 between Shelley, Disappears, and the band, White/Light.\n\n46. \"The Signs\" \\ Malory (2010) – This German trio was formed in 1995 and released four albums between 1999 and 2010. Falling more on the dream pop side of things, I again hear vocals reminiscent of Tim Burgess (The Charlatans UK, it should be noted, were not a shoegaze band). “The Signs” are taken from their final LP, Pearl Diver.\n\n47. \"Crazy Rulers of the World\" \\ Surf City (2010) – Our first entry from New Zealand, with this band from Auckland that was formed in 2004, but took until 2008 to issue their debut, self-titled EP. It was followed by three LPs in 2010, 2013, and 2015. “Crazy Rulers of the World” is from their first LP, Kudos, which evinced a shoegaze vibe more than any other of their releases. Most of their music was more of the jangly, psychedelic, indie-rock sound.\n\n48. \"Love Fade\" \\ Tamaryn (2010) – This is another New Zealand artist, though she has lived most of her life in the US and works out of Los Angeles. The solo project of singer, Tamaryn Brown, she has issued four albums between 2010 and 2019, which were preceded by a self-released EP in 2008. “Love Fade” is from the first album, The Waves.\n\n49. \"Fast Asleep\" \\ Ten Million Lights (2010) – After issuing a self-titled debut LP in 2010, there was nothing further from this act until an EP of remixes and covers by Echo and The Bunnymen and Ride in 2016, followed by an LP and two EPs in 2018. Formed in Portland, Oregon in 2009, the band has revolved around the duo of Ryan Carroll and Eric Block, who had been performing together since 2003.\n\n50. \"Kusmi\" \\ Minks (2011) – As the solo project of Brooklyn’s Shaun Kilfoyle, this act’s first album, By The Hedge, ranged between jangly indie-pop and gauzier dream pop such as “Kusmi.” However, one of the strongest comparisons was to The Cure, and many of the songs harkened back to early Cure sounds, such as on “Boys Don’t Cry.” This was the direction subsequent singles and the follow-up album, 2013’s Tides End, leaning more into a Smiths and ‘80s new wave vibe. Other than a 2020 single, there hasn’t been any further albums.\n\n51. \"Imagine Hearts\" \\ Ringo Deathstarr (2011) – One of the strongest, most consistent, and unabashedly shoegaze acts of the new century, this band out of Austin, Texas has issued five LPs and two EPs. “Imagine Hearts” is from their first LP, Colour Trip. This band was the inspiration for me to dive into modern shoegaze acts, which led to creating this playlist.\n\n52. \"Some Kind\" \\ The History of Apple Pie (2011) – This act was an example of the modern dynamic of internet discovery, spinning a bedroom demo from a duo posted on MySpace into a quintet with a recording contract and tours. After gaining attention with initial uploads and then the single, “You’re So Cool” (2011), the band released two LPs in 2013 and 2014. “Some Kind” was the B-side to “You’re So Cool” and was the shoegaze alter-ego to its dream pop A-side.\n\n53. \"Bright\" \\ Tokyo Shoegazer (2011) – Well, if you put shoegazer in the name of your act and every song comes right out of the genre’s playbook, then it’s hard to deny inclusion on this playlist. Formed in Japan in 2010 to play at a birthday party, the band went on to release two LPs in 2011 and 2013. They then returned to issue two more albums in 2019 and 2022 after their initial music was released and gained attention in North America.\n\n54. \"If You Want To\" \\ Young Prisms (2011) – Yet another band that has recently re-entered the fray. Coming out of San Francisco, after releasing EPs and singles through 2009 and 2010, they issued two LPs in 2011 and 2012 followed by another EP in 2012. Then, after a ten year break, returned in 2022 with their third LP. “If You Want To” is from their debut LP, Friends for Now.\n\n55. \"Catherine, I Feel Sick\" \\ Tripwires (2011) – This quartet came from Reading, England and have released two albums in 2011 and 2015 along with several EPs. “Catherine, I Feel Sick” is from their debut LP, Spacehopper, which was issued in 2011 in the UK and then internationally in 2013.\n\n56. \"Dream Out\" \\ Creepoid (2011) – Coming out of Philadelphia, this trio issued a debut EP in 2010 and then three LPs between 2011 and 2015. Their final release was their third EP, released in 2016. “Dream Out” is from their first LP, Horse Heaven.\n\n57. \"Pink Ruff\" \\ Bleeding Rainbow (2012) – Tending to run along a rough, indie-rock line, this band brings in enough reverb and echoey guitars and vocals to snag a dream pop label, though not forcefully. Duo Sarah Everton and Rob Garcia, also from Philly, first issued two LPs under the name Reading Rainbow before expanding to a quartet and switching their name to Bleeding Rainbow for their third LP, 2010’s Yeah Right. A series of singles in 2012, such as “Pink Ruff,” followed before issuing a second LP, Interrupt, in 2014.\n\n58. \"Wild Peace\" \\ Echo Lake (2012) – From London, this act revolves around the duo of Linda Jarvis and Thom Hill. They released two LPs and one EP between 2011 and 2012. “Wild Peace” is the title track from their first LP.\n\n59. \"Visions\" \\ Letting Up Despite Great Faults (2012) – This LA band is still going after forming in 2006 and having released four LPs and five EPs since that first year. They are named after the Blonde Redhead song, “Loved Despite of Great Faults.” Their sound strays from a pure dream pop sound into a broader, indie rock sound. “Visions” is from their second LP, Untogether.\n\n60. \"Sleepwalker\" \\ Moon Duo (2012) – Not really a pure shoegaze band, I can’t help but include them because I’m a big fan and their psychedelic, echoey, droning sound shares so much DNA with shoegaze. “Sleepwalker” is a good example, taken from their fantastic 2012 LP, Circles. Hailing from San Francisco, the band is the duo of Ripley Johnson and Sanae Yamada. They have released seven LPs since 2010 along with an EP, a couple of remixed LPs, and a live album. Johnson is also in the band Wooden Shjips, which also employs much of the same droning, fuzzy sonic palette and can be linked to shoegaze, though leans a little more towards a folkier, more straightforward sound than the dreamier takes from Moon Duo.\n\n61. \"Don’t Believe Ayn Rand\" \\ Novella (2012) – Prior to forming Echo Lake (see a few songs back on this playlist), Linda Jarvis performed in a band out of Brighton, Houdini Kill Sale, with Hollie Warren and Suki Sou. Warren and Sou then moved to London and joined with Sophy Hollington and Iain Laws to form Novella in 2010. After an EP and couple singles in 2011 and 2012, the band issued their debut LP in 2015 followed by a second in 2017. “Don’t Believe Ayn Rand” is from their self-titled 2012 EP.\n\n62. \"Consistency\" \\ Stagnant Pools (2012) – This brother combo of Bryan and Doug Enas hails from Indianapolis. They released two LPs in 2012 and 2014. “Consistency” is from the debut, Temporary Room.\n\n63. \"Left Myself Behind - Parts 1 & 2\" \\ TOY (2012) – Formed in 2010 in London, this band mixed a post-punk sound with shoegaze accents, as can be heard on “Left Myself Behind-Parts 1 & 2, “ their second single. They further explored this on their self-titled 2012 debut LP. Shoegaze and dream pop influences were less prevalent on subsequent releases as they went on to issue four more LPs (and counting).\n\n64. \"Candy Girl\" \\ Trailer Trash Tracys (2012) – This quartet was formed in London in 2011 and have released two LPs in 2012 and 2017. “Candy Girl” was their first single, taken from the debut LP.\n\n65. \"Flashback\" \\ Whirr (2012) – This San Francisco band started in 2010 as Whirl before having to change their name due to a legal conflict. Founding member Nick Bassett also played for Deafheaven prior to Whirr. They have issued three albums and four EPs. “Flashback” is from their first LP, 2012’s Pipe Dreams.\n\n66. \"Dogwalk\" \\ Pity Sex (2012) – A quartet from Ann Arbor, Michigan, this band issued its first music in 2011 (a track on a various artist compilation) leading to two LPs and several EPs up to 2016. “Dogwalk” is from their first EP, Dark World.\n\n67. \"(I Don't Need to) Wonder\" \\ Black Hearted Brother (2013) – This UK act was a one album (Stars Are Our Home) project from Neil Halstead from Slowdive and Mojave 3, Mark Van Hoen of Seefeel (an ambient act often considered shoegaze), and Nick Holton.\n\n68. \"Scattered in the Wind\" \\ Implodes (2013) – This quartet from Chicago released their self-titled, debut LP in 2009 and have since issued two more albums and an EP. “Scattered in the Wind” is taken from their final album, 2013’s Recurring Dream.\n\n69. \"Long As the Sun\" \\ Medicine (2013) – While this playlist has seen some participation from members of the first generation of shoegaze acts, this is our first entry from one of the original bands. The resurgence of shoegaze bands and general interest in the sound has triggered the return of many first gen acts, as we will see. Formed in 1990 in Los Angeles, Medicine released three albums before disbanding in 1995. They reformed in briefly in 2003 for an album, and then again in 2013 and have issued four more albums. One of the noisiest of the shoegazers, “Long As the Sun,” taken from the 2013 second return LP, To the Happy Few, reveals they still employ sheets of white noise into their sound.\n\n70. \"new you\" \\ My Bloody Valentine (2013) – This was quintessential shoegaze band, whose Loveless LP in 1991 set the standard for shoegaze. Indeed, it was so hard to follow up (thanks to Kevin Shield’s writer’s block, related to his fussy perfectionism), the Irish quartet gave up trying. They split in 1997 after only issuing one subsequent track, a 1993 cover of the Louis Armstrong tune, “We Have All the Time in the World.” Reforming in 2007, and after a touring with the old material, MBV finally provided a new album, m b v, in 2013. While “new you” isn’t the most shoegazey track on the album, I loved hearing the band freshen their sound with a slight funk-pop vibe over their tremelo guitars. We’re not holding our breath for another album anytime soon.\n\n71. \"Slug Night\" \\ No Joy (2013) – This Canadian act from Montreal was formed in 2009 as a duo of Jasamine White-Gluz and Laura Lloyd. It is now solely the project of White-Gluz as the band released their fourth LP in 2020. They have also issued six EPs and have collaborated with shoegaze adjacent Sune Rose from The Raveonettes and first gen shoegazer Peter Kember (Spacemen 3/Sonic Boom). “Slug Night” is taken from their second LP, 2013’s Wait to Pleasure.\n\n72. \"Perrett's Brook\" \\ Oliver Wilde (2013) – Another shoegazer out of Bristol, England, Wilde issued his debut LP in 2013 and followed it with three more in 2014, 2016, and 2017. His music is more of the electronic strain of dream pop though there are some acoustic and electronic guitars.\n\n73. \"Grapes\" \\ Ovlov (2013) – This band from Connecticut is centred around guitarist and vocalist, Steve Hartlett. After an EP and a couple singles between 2009 and 2011, the first album arrived in 2013, to be followed by two more in 2018 and 2021. There is a penchant for short album titles: Am, Tru, and Buds.\n\n74. \"We Are the Dreamers\" \\ Stargazer Lilies (2013) – Formed by ex-Soundpool members, John Ceparano and Kim Field, the band issued their debut LP in 2013 and have since issued five more LPs plus a live album. “We Are the Dreamers” was the title track to their first LP.\n\n75. \"Haolam Avad Mizman\" \\ Vaadat Charigim (2013) – Israel is not a country that has provided many acts into the modern rock sphere, and shoegaze would seem as unlikely a spot as any to find an entry. But here are Vaadat Charigim (“exceptions committee” in English), a trio from Tel Aviv that was formed in 2012 when Yuval Haring returned to Israel after a stint in a band in Berlin. They have released two albums in 2013 and 2015. “Haolam Avad Mizman” is taken from their debut, “The World Is Well Lost.”\n\n76. \"MTLOV (Minor Keys)\" \\ A Sunny Day in Glasgow (2014) – While the band’s name would suggest a Scottish connection, this band hails from Philadelphia and has primarily been a vehicle for Ben Daniels, who did form the band after living in the UK. Co-founder Ever Nalens had been living in Glasgow, which was the inspiration for the name. Nalens had departed by the time of the first LP in 2007, with the act being comprised of a trio of Daniels and his twin sisters, Robin and Lauren. There has followed three more LPs along with six EPs. “MTLOV (Minor Keys)” is taken from their most recent LP, 2014’s Sea When Absent.\n\n77. \"Geographic\" \\ Cheatahs (2014) – While this band came out of London, only bassist Dean Reid hailed from England, while the remaining three members were from Canada, the US, and Germany. Formed in 2009 by the Canadian, Nathan Hewitt, the band released several singles and a couple EPs from 2009 to 2012 before issuing a compilation of their EPs in 2013 and then their first LP in 2014. A second LP followed in 2015, but the band appears to have folded in 2016. “Geographic” is an album cut from their sefl-titled debut LP.\n\n78. \"Tephra\" \\ Fear of Men (2014) – This band’s name led to suspect it as an all-female act, but vocalist/guitarist Jess Weiss is backed by two males, Daniel Falvey and Michael Miles. Formed in Brighton, England in 2011, the trio issued singles as of 2011 leading to two LPs, Loom in 2014 and Fall Forever in 2016. Their most recent release was the single, “Into Strangeness,” in 2020. “Tephra” is an album track from their first LP.\n\n79. \"Dig\" \\ Nothing (2014) – Another band from Philly (the fourth on this list), this act was formed in 2010 and have released four LPs and a bunch of EPs and singles. After time in a punk band and serving time in jail from a stabbing, founder Nicky Palermo shifted gears towards the more settling, but no less caustic, sonics of shoegaze. “Dig” was a single from the debut LP, Guilty of Everything.\n\n80. \"In Your Arms\" \\ Sunbeam Sound Machine (2014) – Another name perfectly aligned to dream pop, this Australian act is actually the solo project of Nick Sowersby, though he tours as a five-piece. He has issued three LPs and two EPs since 2013, with “In You Arms” taken from the debut LP, Wonderer. This tune strikes me as a dream pop variant on the ambient grooves of Washed Out, another solo act presented as a band.\n\n81. \"Starchild Skull\" \\ Cloakroom (2015) – Formed in 2012, this American trio has released three albums and two EPs. Their most recent release was the single, “Fear of Being Fixed” in 2022. “Starchild Skull” is from the debut LP, 2015’s Further Out.\n\n82. \"Ryder\" \\ Helen (2015) – this US trio was formed by Liz Harris, who is better known via her other, ambient act, Grouper. Formed in 2013 in Portland, they only released one LP in 2015, from which “Ryder” is an album cut and was the opening track.\n\n83. \"Holy Forest\" \\ Pinkshinyultrablast (2015) – Another title taken from the ethereal sonic shoegaze soundscape, it was taken from an LP title by band Astrobrite (featured early in this playlist). A rare contribution from Russia, this quintet from St. Petersburg was formed in 2007 and have released three LPs and a couple EPs, starting with a single/EP in 2009. “Holy Forest” was a single from their first LP, Everything Else Matters from 2015.\n\n84. \"The Substance of Grief Is Not Imaginary\" \\ Pyramids (2015) – mystery seems to shroud this quartet from Texas, suiting their dark, metallic take on the shoegaze gruffness. They have released several albums, often in collaboration with other bands and guest artists, such as Simon Raymonde from Cocteau Twins. “A Substance of Grief is Not Imaginary” is taken from their most recent LP, 2015’s A Northern Meadow.\n\n85. \"Last Rites\" \\ Swervedriver (2015) – Although there will be more to come, after Medicine and MBV, this is only the third of the first-generation acts to appear on this playlist. Following the 1998 release of their fourth album, this Oxford band went into hiatus until a reunion gig at the Coachella festival followed by a tour in 2008. Three members returned, co-founders Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge along with bassist Steve George, while original drummer Graham Bonnar briefly re-joined in 2010. Two albums have since been issued, 2015’s I Wasn’t Born to Lose You, and 2019’s Future Ruins. “Last Rites” is an album cut from the 2015 LP.\n\n86. \"Slide Away\" \\ Teenage Wrist (2015) – this LA band was formed in 2014 and employed a little shoegaze fuzz and echoey vocals into their indie-rock sound. They have released two LPs in 2018 and 2021 along with several EPs. “Slide Away” was a single and appeared on their debut EP, Dazed.\n\n87. \"You Know the Way\" \\ The Telescopes (2015) – This was an English band formed in 1987. Their experimental, noise rock has been as much shoegaze adjacent as stepping into it directly. After releasing two LPs in 1989 and 1992, they broke up only to reconvene in 2002 with a new album. They have since issued eleven more albums. “You Know the Way” is from their 2015 LP, The Hidden Fields.\n\n88. \"Pretender\" \\ Winter (2015) – Another LA band, this act was originally formed in Boston in 2012 by Samira Winter and Nolan Eley. After the release of a debut EP, Winter moved to LA and Eley to New York, yet they still assembled a band and recorded together, releasing their debut LP in 2015, Supreme Blue Dream, from which “Pretender” is taken. After another album and an EP in 2018, the band parted ways with Winter carrying on solo under the name. She has since released three more albums. Samira is also Brazilian and sings some songs in Portuguese.\n\n89. \"Fingertips\" \\ Brian Jonestown Massacre (2016) – Another first-generation act, this San Francisco act has been a rarity to have sustained throughout, now having issued twenty albums since their debut single in 1992, including thirteen this century. Founder Anton Newcombe and Ricky Maymi are the only original members still in the band, though Maymi has come and gone in the line-up over the years. “Fingertips” was the B-side to their 2016 non-album single, “Bout de Doigts.”\n\n90. \"In Heaven\" \\ Greet Death (2016) – Formed in Flint, Michigan in 2016, this trio has issued two albums and one EP. “In Heaven” was their debut, non-album single.\n\n91. \"The Sound of All Things\" \\ Lorelle Meets the Obsolete (2016) – Our first entry from Mexico, this duo has issued five albums since their debut in 2011. Mixing several genres, the band moves in and out of dream pop and shoegaze. Case in point, “The Sound of All Things” is taken from the 2016 LP, Balance, and the ambient, sci-fi, disco-pop electronic glide of the track evolves into a gauzy, dreamy sound over the last third.\n\n92. \"Violet\" \\ Miserable (2016) – This is the solo project of ex-Whirr member, Kristina Esfandiari. While the act’s name might suggest something dark and dispiriting, as is often the case with shoegaze, beauty is found within the heavy guitars and moody spirits. She has released one album and several EPs since her debut in 2013. “Violet” is taken from the 2016 album, Uncontrollable.\n\n93. \"Natural Devotion\" \\ Spirit of the Beehive (2016) – This band’s name keeps tricking me into thinking of the 1990s, not shoegaze but slightly dream-pop act, Voice of the Beehive. However, ‘Spirit’ is yet another Philadelphia band, named after a 1973 Spanish film. They have issued four albums and several EPs since their 2014 debut. “Natural Devotion” is from the 2015 EP, and their second release, You Are Arrived (But You’ve Been Cheated).\n\n94. \"The Fool\" \\ We Are Parasols (2016) – This appears to be a mixed media collective out of Portland, Oregon. Issuing through their own indie label (not uncommon in shoegaze), No Movement Records, they have released two albums and several EPs since their debut in 2012. “The Fool” is from their first LP, 2016’s Infrastructure.\n\n95. \"Nobody Panicked and Everybody Got On\" \\ Yoo Doo Right (2016) – Named after a 1969 song by Krautrock pioneers, Can, this band from Montreal, Canada have released two albums and several EPs. “Nobody Panicked and Everybody Got On” is the title track from their 2016 debut EP. Perhaps not purely shoegaze, their droning, echoey, guitar-heavy sound certainly runs through many shoegaze elements.\n\n96. \"Sun Poisoning\" \\ Horse Jumper of Love (2017) – Another band as much adjacent to shoegaze as wallowing in it, this slowcore, noisy trio out of Boston released their debut LP in 2016 and have since issued two more LPs. “Sun Poisoning” is from their debut, self-titled LP in 2016.\n\n97. \"This is Permanent\" \\ Airiel (2017) – I only recently discovered this band and got to see them play in Toronto. “This is Permanent” opened that show and was also the lead track from their most recent LP, 2017’s Molten Young Lovers. It has immediately become one of my favourite contemporary shoegaze tracks. The band was originally formed by Jeremy Wrenn in Bloomington, Indiana in 1997 as Airiel Project One. Wrenn has remained the one constant in the line-up as the band moved to Chicago and shortened the name. Early releases started from 1998 as singles and compilation entries before issuing a series of EPs from 2003 and 2004 all linked by the title, Winks & Kisses. Along with more EPs came their first full-length, 2007’s The Battle of Sealand. There has been only the one additional LP in 2017, which to date remains their most recent release.\n\n98. \"Passing Thing\" \\ Froth (2017) – Hailing from the coastal community, El Segundo, in the shadow of the Los Angeles airport, this band was formed in 2012. I have seen them perform twice, both times somewhat unexpectedly. The first was as the opening act for Ride in Toronto in 2017, and then in Glasgow in 2019 at the renowned club, Nice ‘n’ Sleazy, when we had a free night during vacation and decided to catch some music. The band’s sound evolved towards shoegaze over the course of three albums from 2013 to 2017 and have since issued one more LP in 2019. “Passing Thing” is from the third LP and first to jump full into shoegaze, 2017’s Outside (Briefly).\n\n99. \"Youth\" \\ Hundredth (2017) – This band was formed in 2008 in the unlikely locale of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina – I just don’t associate shoegaze with warm, sunny places known more for beach and golf getaways. Chadwick Johnson has been the one constant member, with Alex Blackwell IV (both of these names, however, seem very Myrtle Beach and still, not very shoegaze) and Andrew Minervi having also been in the line-up for most of its tenure. Their first LP came out in 2010 and they have now released six in total along with five EPs, with the most recent LP in 2021. “Youth” is taken from the fourth album, 2017’s RARE, which is when their sound shifted more fully into the shoegaze genre.\n\n100. \"Tenderness\" \\ Jefre Cantu-Ledesma (2017) – Originally from Texas but having worked mostly out of San Francisco (but now residing in Germany, according to Wikipedia), Cantu-Ledesma has a hefty discography both solo and as a member of several bands, most notably Tarentel. Generally tied to ambient music that often touches down into shoegaze, Jefre has issued music since 2006. “Tenderness” is taken from his 2017 solo LP, On the Echoing Green.\n\n101. \"Song for an Unborn Son\" \\ Midwife (2017) – This is one of several musical vehicles for Madeline Johnstone, who appears to work out of New Mexico (per Bandcamp), though there is not much info out there on her. Other acts she performs under are Mariposa, Mercury Tracer, and Sister Grotto. As Midwife, she has issued three albums and an EP. “Song for an Unborn Son” was the lead track from the first LP, 2017’s Like Author, Like Daughter.\n\n102. “Kingdom of the Day” \\ Life on Venus (2017) – Another band out of Russia, this Moscow band was formed at Moscow State University in 2015 and has released three albums since 2017. “Kingdom of the Day” is from the firs LP, Encounters.\n\n103. \"Home Is A Feeling\" \\ Ride (2017) – One of the most renowned of the first generation bands, Oxford’s Ride broke up in 1996 after their fourth LP, with guitarist Andy Bell joining Oasis (as bassist) through to its dissolution in 2009. Ride reformed in 2014 for a reunion tour, leading to the decision to resume recording. They have since released two LPs in 2017 and 2019 and there is news of another on the way (I saw them in concert this year and they played a new song, “Monaco”). While the band evolved from a shoegaze sound into a more accessible Britpop sound in the 1990s, their new material provides great combos of their rock sound mixed with their shoegaze origins. “Home Is A Feeling” is just such an example and was the second single released in early 2017, ahead of the comeback album later that year, Weather Diaries.\n\n104. \"Star Roving\" \\ Slowdive (2017) – This single was the first issued by Slowdive after their reunion in 2014, and not only showed that one of shoegaze’s most quintessential pioneers could still deliver, offered up one of the greatest songs of the past decade and certainly one of the leading tracks of the modern shoegaze era. It pre-dated the band’s fourth LP, a 2017 self-titled release that was their first since 1995. They also have rumours of another LP in the works. The high quality of these recent releases from Ride and Slowdive remind us how great those original bands were and continue to raise the bar for the current wave of shoegaze acts.\n\n105. \"Guessing Game\" \\ Temple of Angels (2017) – Having issued a few singles and an EP since 2017, this band from Austin, Texas is preparing to issue their first LP in the summer of 2023. “Guessing Game” was the lead track from their self-titled, debut EP.\n\n106. \"Deaf\" \\ Just Mustard (2018) – Given that the most iconic of shoegaze bands, My Bloody Valentine, came out of Ireland, one would think there would have been many more acts to follow from the Emerald Isle. It hasn’t really come to pass. This act is just the second Irish act on this playlist, following… MBV. Formed in 2016, Just Mustard is a quintet that has released two albums and an EP. “Deaf” is from their debut LP, 2018’s Wednesday.\n\n107. \"Quiero Otoño De Nuevo\" \\ Mint Field (2018) – Heck, even Mexico has produced as many shoegaze acts than Ireland! This trio is the second on this list to hail from that country. After self-releasing a debut LP in 2015, the band has followed with three more, each on a different label (it’s tough being a shoegaze act). This track is taken from the first label LP, 2018’s Pasar de las Luces.\n\n108. \"Hits My Eyes\" \\ Reveries (2018) – This band from Walla Walla, Washington has only issued a couple EPs, with the 2018 self-titled EP as their debut followed by another in 2021. “Hits My Eyes” was the lead track from the EP. There is little info to find on this band (the link to their website is dead), nicely summed up on their Bandcamp page, “we move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy.”\n\n109. \"Haze\" \\ Sahara (2018) – I discovered this band from my city, Toronto, when they opened for Airiel in a show I recently attended. It was a pleasant surprise to discover their consistent batch of dream pop songs, issued since 2018 via singles, and EP, and an LP in 2020. “Haze” was their debut single. They are with local label, Hand Drawn Dracula, which features other dream pop acts such as Tallies and No Joy, both also on this playlist.\n\n110. \"Not the Time\" \\ Sasami (2018) – One of my favourite, non-shoegaze acts from the past decade is Cherry Glazerr, and it’s from that band that Sasami Ashworth arrived, leaving that indie-rock act to go solo and explore a noisier brand of music. She has since released two LPs in 2019 and 2022. “Not the Time” was her first single, issued in 2018 ahead of her first, eponymous LP.\n\n111. \"Glow\" \\ Slow Crush (2018) – This Belgian quartet has released two albums and two EPs since 2016. “Glow” is taken from the debut LP, Aurora. It’s curious how the word, “slow,” appears so frequently in shoegaze.\n\n112. \"Hunned Bandz\" \\ Tanukichan (2018) – Breaking away from the band, Trails and Ways, in 2016 to go solo, Californian Hannah van Loon has operated under the name Tanukichan (a combination of the Japanese raccoon, tanuki, and the honorific, chan). She partners with Chaz Bear in developing and producing her music. They have released two LPs, and “Hunned Bandz” is taken from the 2018 debut, Sundays.\n\n113. \"Paramour\" \\ True Primitives (2018) – Formed by Clint Sargent in Portland after leaving the band, The High Violets, he assembled a band that included members of his former act and Brian Jonestown Massacre to record an LP, Revolutions, in 2018. “Paramour” is the album’s closing track.\n\n114. \"Sunshine\" \\ Blushing (2019) – In late 2019, I caught the fantastic, Ringo Deathstarr, in a small venue in Toronto. I was impressed by their opening act, a fellow Austin band called, Blushing. Formed around two husband-wife couples, Jacob Soto and Noe Carmona had been lifelong friends that had played in bands together and happened to both move to Austin and meet their wives in 2009. The couples’ friendship evolved over the years into a musical project that became Blushing, releasing EPs in 2017 and 2018 followed by albums in 2019 and 2022. The second LP, Possessions, was produced by Elliott Frazier from Ringo Deathstarr and featured pedigreed guests Miki Berenyi from Lush and Mark Gardener from Ride. “Sunshine” is from the debut, self-titled LP.\n\n115. \"Eye to Eye\" \\ Bodywash (2019) – Another Montreal act, our third on this playlist, this band started in 2014 when Chris Steward and Rosie Long Decter were attending university together. Their debut LP, Comforter, was released in 2019 and the follow-up, I Held the Shape While I Could, was released just this April 2023.\n\n116. \"Blankenship\" \\ DIIV (2019) – This Brooklyn quartet started in 2011 and was originally called Dive (named after the Nirvana tune), but changed it to avoid confusion with a Belgian industrial band. They have released three albums since 2012. Critically acclaimed and one of the more successful acts on this playlist, the band’s sound stays on the more accessible end of the dream pop, post-punk, indie rock and pop spectrums. “Blankenship” is their most recent single and is taken from their third album, Deceiver.\n\n117. \"Vision Scraps\" \\ Lightning Bug (2019) – Formed in 2015 out of New York, this trio has issued three albums and an EP since 2015, with all being self-released except for their most recent LP, A Color of the Sky. “Vision Scraps” is taken from their second LP, 2019’s October Song.\n\n118. \"High\" \\ Slow Pulp (2019) – Another act I discovered when they opened for another act, this time Alvvays in Toronto this past December (2022). Slow Pulp originally hails from Madison, Wisconsin but now works out of Chicago. Formed by a trio of childhood friends, the band came together in high school with the addition of vocalist Emily Massey. They have released several EPs since 2015 and in 2020 issued their first and, to date, only LP, Moveys. “High” is taken from their third EP, 2019’s Big Day.\n\n119. \"Where You Found Me\" \\ Still Motions (2019) – This is a quartet out of Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2019 and who have issued two LPs (though at six songs and thirty-five minutes each, could be argued they’re EPs or mini-LPs). Their instrumental tracks mix atmospheric, prog rock (they describe themselves as post-rock) that often dips into metallic riffs or dream popish, jangly, echoey guitars. It feels shoegaze even if the compositions don’t fit cleanly into the mold. “Where You Found Me” was their first single and was included on their debut LP, 2020’s Mirrors.\n\n120. \"Trains and Snow\" \\ Tallies (2019) – One of my favourite local acts, Toronto’s Tallies released in 2022 their follow LP, Patina, to their 2019 self-titled debut. Both albums feature consistent, infectious dream pop tracks. “Trains and Snow” is from their debut LP.\n\n121. \"Ash Anywhere\" \\ Narrow Head (2019) – And apparently Texas is another hot spot, though instead of Austin this act hails from Dallas. Formed in 2013, this band blends shoegaze with grungy rock – a not uncommon mix in contemporary sounds – they have released three LPs, the most recent this year. “Ash Anywhere” was from the 2019 EP, Coursing Through.\n\n122. \"If….\" \\ bdrmm (2020) – This band is from Hull, England, and started as the solo project of Ryan Smith. Issuing singles and EPs since 2016, the band released their first and only LP, Bedroom, in 2020. I caught wind of the album at the time and it was one of the LPs that encouraged me towards exploring the return of shoegaze and, ultimately, this playlist.\n\n123. \"Save Me\" \\ Deserta (2020) – This is the solo project for Matthew Doty, ex of Saxon Shore and Midnight Faces who released eight albums between them. As Deserta he has released two albums in 2020 and 2022. “Save Me” is from the first LP, Black Aura My Sun.\n\n124. \"When You Sleep\" \\ Lost Echoes (2020) – Another act from the apparent shoegaze hotbed of Portland. This quartet released several EPs/singles since 2018 and issued their first LP, Stars, in 2022. “When You Sleep” was a non-album single released in 2020.\n\n125. \"Pill\" \\ Peel Dream Magazine (2020) – With a pseudonym inspired by legendary British DJ, John Peel, New Yorker Joe Stevens has issued three albums and a couple EPs. However, his sound has shifted over the three releases, with the 2018 debut, Modern Meta Physic, pulling strongly from the ambient, experimental flavours of Stereolab before going full shoegaze in 2020’s Agitprop Alterna. But in 2022’s Pod, he shifted in a completely new direction with no relation to shoegaze and leaning into a loungey, psychedelic, R&B styled album.\n\n126. \"Vibrant Colours\" \\ Zoon (2020) – Indigenous Canadian Daniel Monkmen refers to his sound as ‘moccasin-gaze,’ and I love that. As a Canadian, I’m disappointed it took to making this playlist to discover his music. After being raised in Indigenous communities in Manitoba, he eventually found his way to Hamilton, Ontario, where he recorded an EP, Bleached Wavves, under the name Bloom. That led to a label signing and the re-release of the EP along with several singles, this time under the moniker, Zoon, in reference to the Ojibwe, Zoongide’ewin (\"bravery, courage, the Bear Spirit\"). Several singles and EPs have followed. “Vibrant Colours” was a single and a track from Bleached Wavves.\n\n127. \"Peal\" \\ bliss fields (2021) – Another band with a suitably descriptive shoegaze name. This is another Toronto act that has issued a 2021, self-titled EP and a 2022 album, Slowly, Forever. “Peal” is taken from the EP.\n\n128. \"You\" \\ celia's dream (2021) (not on YouTube playlist) – Before you hear a note, you knew this act, with a name lifted from one of the best shoegaze tracks ever (by Slowdive), was going to fit on this playlist. It appears we’re also into the Canadian section of this playlist, as this band hails from the implausible locale for a shoegaze act, the prairie city of Regina, Saskatchewan. As far as I can tell, “You,” is the only release from the band so far – yup, one song.\n\n129. \"In Blur\" \\ Deafheaven (2021) – I’m not sure I’m convinced this is a shoegaze band, but Wikipedia says so (!), though it also relates them to genres such as black metal, post-metal, blackgaze(?), and screamo(??). They also combined ‘deaf’ and ‘heaven’ in homage to how Slowdive styled their name (though they, in turn, took their name from the Siouxsie and the Banshees track, also styled that way), so there’s some cred there. Indeed, this act from San Francisco can throw airy dream pop at you as well as heavy, guitar-laden metal riffs accompanied with throat-stinging, screaming vocals. I have to say, they’re an intriguing concept and I’m not sure how they’ve built up such a strong following with such a varied sonic range, but they’re one of the most streamed acts on this playlist. “In Blur” is from their 2021 LP, Infinite Granite, and displays their ability to explore dream pop and shoegaze textures within their sound. They were formed in 2010 and have released five albums.\n\n130. \"Still\" \\ Kraus (2021) – This act is the intriguing Will Kraus from Dallas, who was raised on nu-metal and started his career producing hip hop and electronic music. In the 2010s he was exposed to ethereal, ambient music via Iceland’s, Sigur Rós, and when he decided to start recording music himself, leaned into shoegaze as his preferred style. He has issued five LPs and an EP since 2016. “Still” is taken from his 2021 LP, View No Country. Quite frankly, you can dive into any track of his and find something like this.\n\n131. \"Pretty Today\" \\ Smile Machine (2021) – This is the solo project of drummer, Jordyn Blakely, who also plays in several other acts. Based in Brooklyn, she has issued just one EP so far, 2021’s Bye for Now, which features five wonderfully chaotic (she is a drummer, after all) shoegaze tracks.\n\n132. “fluorescent” \\ motifs (2022) – Notice how a lot of shoegaze acts like to use lower case lettering for their band, album, or song names? Here we have motifs, a band from another new shoegaze location, Singapore. Formed in 2019, the quintet self-released their first album, Remember A Stranger, in late 2022 and have caught international attention."
