        "text": "If I was going to give someone examples of ShoegazeTM as I remember it being at the time, I would probably chuck them copies of Just For A Day by Slowdive and Pearl by Chapterhouse.\n\nLoveless is one of my all time favourite albums but it stands alone as its own thing. And Ride were my favourite band back then for 2 or 3 years, but they always seemed like an absolutely brilliant noisy guitar pop band, rather than \"shoegaze\" and I still think that now. Too song-based to really be shoegaze*, whereas Slowdive absolutely were. For me anyway. That whole 90-92 scene was my thing though, through and through.\n\n*as a genre, I mean. Obviously they were a part of The Scene That Celebrates Itself... I'm actually with versionsound on this.\n\nThis would sound at home on Gang Of Four's \"Solid Gold\". Where does that stand in your view?\n\nThis has been a really interesting conversation. One band I might throw into the mix as a shoegaze influencer is Mission of Burma.\n\nAmong the first post-punk bands (they were already moving past punk while it was still in its infancy), they were experimenting with effects, layers and tape loops (even live!), to create a bigger, more atmospheric sound while still remaining extremely loud and guitar-centric. They were certainly an influence on many of the bands that influenced shoegaze, such as Sonic Youth.\n\nThis 1982 track is a good example of what they were up to, especially around the 2:45-minute mark when additional layers and tape loops kick in to create a dense soundscape:\n\nThe JAMC was definitely a direct influence on MBV, no doubt about that. I don’t know if the influence went both ways. If so, the Reids are pretty unlikely to admit it.\n\nI would put GoF firmly under post-punk. The BP go there too. Rowland was very influential on subsequent guitarists, but a lot of other post-punk guitarists were too. The reason I singled Rowland out was his direct influence on most of the others on the list. Plus, reverb, reverb, reverb.\n\nI always considered My Bloody Valentine the leaders of the scene. Every other band labelled shoegaze and more besides seemed to idolise them. Thinking of MBV's Creation Records period only, I wouldn't know who influenced them. For me they were pioneers.\n\nI remember going to see Chapterhouse and being fully aware they were categorised as shoegaze. A lad who stood near me did not watch the band at all, he just looked down towards his shoes and swayed his head for the full set. I remember thinking it was strange and it has stuck in my memory.\n\nNot sure if I'm recalling this correctly, but I think shoegazing ended up being used by the UK weekly music press in a derogatory way, and they were especially cruel towards Slowdive (great band).\n\nOnce again, this song is in no way shoegaze, but RSH was an essential step in getting to shoegaze. He was an acknowledged influence of Cocteau Twins, the JAMC, and My Bloody Valentine as well as others who were part of the equation (Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr., in particular). I picked this track for the symphonic use of reverb, fuzz, and feedback. Rowland was also distinct for his use of copious amounts of reverb, which was part of the bedrock of the shoegaze “sound,” to the extent that there was/is one. I surely could have missed someone, but I can’t really think of another post-punk guitarist who used reverb like Rowland as a core element of their sound.\n\n“Shoegaze” was absolutely meant as an insult. MBV were the leaders only in the sense that those other bands copied them. They never considered themselves part of that scene and made an effort to distance themselves from it, but wherever they went (musically), the other bands followed. The press didn’t help. When you are trying to invent a genre, you need bands to slot into it, so MBV were dumped in with all the bands who copied them. Being weekly publications, they needed something to hype and/or deride, and “shoegaze” fit the bill for both.\n\nMaybe the way you’re seeing it — MBV getting dumped into the category with the bands that copied them — is exactly how a genre starts. I mean, Jesus was Jewish after all.\n\nMaybe? I guess the fact that they inspired other bands while they were still active made it hard for most folks to differentiate between the original and the copy (understandably). The Stooges and MC5 had the luxury of breaking up a few years before the bands they inspired really coalesced into a scene/genre, so it’s hard to argue that either WAS punk, not just a primary influence.\n\nMOB was a really interesting band. They were on the periphery of the punk scene and even the hardcore scene, playing shows with both early Husker Du and Boston Crew troublemakers Negative FX, but they weren’t really a punk band and definitely weren’t a hardcore band. They weren’t commercial enough to be new wave or college rock, and America didn’t really have a coherent post-punk scene. They were kind of out there on their own.\n\nMy recollection is that shoegazing was a term used long before shoegaze bands were around. Basically as an insult to indie type bands who didn't even pretend to put on a \"show\". Originally it had nothing to do with pedalboards. But of course, not putting on a typical rock'n'roll show was all part of the indie ethos for some bands. Folks may cite some journalist's first use of it in a magazine, but it was more of a street term at first. A variant of navel gazing.\n\nI think your recollection is wrong\n\nTo that point: In the latter part of this video you can see Miki from Lush standing up front watching MBV at this 1988 gig. (you can also see Chris from Silverfish)"
