        "text": "Slowdive is my fave here. Their recent self-titled album has no business being as great as it is, and Souvlaki is my favorite vintage shoegaze record. Cocteaus might be next; tremendously interesting band they are, with a number of great albums and EPs.\n\nI admire mbv more than I love them--was really enamored of Loveless in college, but I rarely listen to it anymore. It's so much about sound more so than songs, which is fine given the genre, but I feel like its sound actually could be better. The drums are weirdly rinky-dink and it's all a bit muffled compared to how I remembered it being. Dunno if it was ever remixed or remastered, though. Anyway, much respect for how creative and influential they were, but I don't love them as much as I used to.\n\nCatherine Wheel is terrific, particularly their second album.\n\nDon't understand why Beach House is here. That's dream pop and it's its own thing. Don't get the Verve, either. Cool band, only a little bit shoegaze and even then not for very long.\n\nI love \"Heaven Or Las Vegas\" but I think \"Spooky\" - which Wikipedia.org amazingly refers to as \"the second studio album by English rock band Lush\" - suffered from a combination of unfortunate circumstances.\n\nThere was Guthries... shall we say condition and the fact that Lush itself was in turmoil. Steve Rippon (\"Bassplayer in nippon\" ) left during the sessions and Anderson and Berenyi probably felt they had to deliver. After all the string of EPs - released throughout 1989/90/91 - had build considerable expectation for their first proper full length.\n\nI'd call \"Split\" their peak too. Even though back then it couldn't have arrived at a worse time. By 1994 shoegaze - and Lush - had become deeply unfashionable. Miki and Emma would definitely do something to rectify that with their next album. But in 1994 people weren't listening."
