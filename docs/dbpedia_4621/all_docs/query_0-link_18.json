        "text": "Crate Digging is a recurring feature that takes a deep dive into music history to turn up several albums all music fans should know. In this edition, Slowdive drummer Simon Scott goes through 10 essential shoegaze albums.\n\nFrom the first tones of Slowdive’s summer return single, “kisses,” it became clear how influential the band has become throughout the last three decades. Elements of their rich, evocative guitar work, combined with the push-and-pull of Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell’s vocals, are found in dozens of today’s established guitar acts. A shift towards an emphasis on mood, atmosphere, and “vibes” are at the core of this movement, and Slowdive are masters of the mood ring.\n\nTheir stunning new album, everything is alive, was deemed by the band as their “most hopeful record.” Though a few dark days and some contemplative energy made their way into LP, they’re frequently offset by moments of striking clarity, sun-streaked brightness, chord changes that bring both peace and intrigue. It’s yet another later career highlight for a band that just keeps getting better.\n\nBut to properly track how Slowdive have ended up here requires a look back at what spawned these blissful, emotionally-charged sonics in the first place. Speaking to Slowdive’s longtime drummer Simon Scott over a video call, he names several significant albums that, as he says, “blew his head off.” Quite a few of his selections are from bands that he and the rest of Slowdive have a fondness for — particularly My Bloody Valentine, Loop, and Sonic Youth. Several selections just happened to be released in the year 1988, which Scott claims was “the point where everything just collided and coalesced into this wonderful entanglement of dream pop, shoegaze, whatever you want to call it.”\n\nFor Scott, the new Slowdive album has been a long time coming, and the band worked intensely to craft a full sonic experience. His drums, which he demoed out on “a lovely Gretsch Maple kit” and subsequently reprogrammed for the sake of a more digitized, synth-oriented sound, were influenced heavily by electronic music. However, Scott maintains that everything evolved organically from jamming in the studio — chords, drums, and all."
