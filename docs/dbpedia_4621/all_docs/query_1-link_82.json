        "text": "Some of the best 90s music was from bands like Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine, Chapterhouse, and Lush.\n\nOne of my early online impulse purchases was \"Rownderbowt\" by Chapterhouse, which I still have.\n\nAre you a fan of this type of music?\n\nR6, R1 here. You are right, when I saw them I was so looking forward to it and was really disappointed that they played so loudly. Their theory being that it helps the audience get lost in the sound, but actually the loudness undercut everything I liked about their music. And I'm a fan of loud music, but not in this case.\n\nOP, I caught My Bloody Valentine at Coachella back in the 2000s -- thankfully, before Coachella became a total douchebag magnet and when it was still (largely) about the music. I'd actually gone to one of the tents to see the terrific English band The Horrors. The Horrors played a solid set, but were visibly upset about being programmed at the same time as MBV as their tent was maybe 1/3 full at most because virtually everyone had gone to the mainstage to see MBV. I was a dumb kid who didn't know MBV and didn't know what I was missing. Luckily, something told me I should leave The Horrors set early and check out a little of MBV and I'm so glad I did. I walked up right as they were starting their You Made Me Realise (Holocaust) song and my jaw literally dropped as that sound just swirled around me. It was absolutely mesmerizing. I imagine seeing them at an outdoor venue like that is ideal as the sound was (almost) overwhelming but not so much that earplugs would have been mandatory.\n\nDo y'all consider Deerhunter (at least some of their music) shoegaze? Regardless, I feel like this wonderful song has definite hallmarks of shoegaze influence. The second, largely instrumental, half of the song with its wall of sound and reverby layer upon layer of guitars building upon one another in this infinite loop is just gorgeous... even if it's not technically shoegaze, I'm guessing most of you would enjoy it if you're not already familiar...\n\nI'm not sure if they are technically considered Shoegaze r22. I don't pay much attention to the technicalities. I just like them, Deerhunter that is.\n\nA lot of msic I like is probably not considered Shoegaze, but it has that wall of guitar and reverb sound that got me hooked in the first place. You get wrapped in sound.\n\nBands like Cigarettes after Sex and My Morning Jacket have that cocooning ability too.\n\n[quote]I'm not sure if they are technically considered Shoegaze R22.

Any other songs you'd recommend that feature that type of... coooning sound experience like Desire Lines?\n\nAny fans of A Place To Bury Strangers? They get so LOUD (earplugs, definitely required), but they never lose their sense of rhythm or songcraft under all that wonderful noise. Incidentally, their founding member also founded an effects pedal company that, equipment from which, they employ in their wall of sound, reverb-heavy aesthetic. Their equipment is also used by bands as diverse as U2, Nine Inch Nails and Portishead.\n\nThey've gone a bit mellow on their newest work. Definitely prefer their earlier albums. But , I bet they still put on a killer show\n\nI saw The Stone Roses in 1989 at their legendary Alexandra Palace concert, and Ride in the Students' Union bar of the then Kingston Polytechnic, the guitarist who went on to join Oasis gave me the set list which I have in a box somewhere with the Roses ticket. The whole shoegazer thing was however not as much fun as what I next got into - The Orb. I basically took a lot of drugs in London in the late eighties and early nineties.\n\nNever dug back far enough into Shoegaze, though I dabbled but I did go through a full 90's Britpop submersion about 5 years ago and still remain a fan of the genre and the cultural era to this day. I spent an entire vacation in 2014 listening only to \"Modern Life is Rubbish\" every night.\n\nShoegaze fans can scoff at anyone who loves \"Blur\" as too glossy-mainstream to move in their privileged circles but I think \"Blur\" were the peak of cultural reflection in British music from that time period. Great at social satire, character studies and creative reflections on British cultural changes in their music.\n\nI still love seeing their comedic send up of \"Last Year at Marienbad\" in their \"To The End\" vid. All art house solemnity and lingering gazes:\n\nR58 You just blew my mind. I am 45. All this music came out my freshman year in college. I still get the magical feels listening to My bloody Valentine, Ride, Curve (totally magical), Slowdive, Lush etc etc, . What a great moment in music. 1990-91.\n\n(Also was crazy about The Orb but that gets into other genres that don't apply here.)\n\nBeach House is great for neo-shoegazing. Spiritualized are not technically shoegaze, but this song did the fucking job my freshman year, when I empowered myself to buy my own pot and my bedroom was lined with christmas lights. Best to listen to it in the dark.\n\nR108 you saw The Ocean Blue live? I'm oozing green. BETWEEN THE RHYTHM & THE SOUND changed my life, and 'Crash' is one of my \"play this at my funeral\" songs.\n\nR101 Hope Sandoval raised me, basically. She's the Goddess Mama I needed and loved since I was little, and I look on THROUGH THE DEVIL SOFTLY as a cornerstone in my adolescence. Plus I've always heard rumors that she's a lesbian, any credence to that?\n\nI loved Lush BECAUSE of Lovelife in addition to there other stellar catalogue. They could do no wrong in my eyes. Also Liz and Robin? Hello??? Not Bringing up the Twins at the mere mention of shoegaze or anything dreampop related is like leaving out Kraftwork when mentioning synth pop. Actually the whole reason I love shoegaze, twee, madchester and anything c86 related is because of the way they phased out that awful synthesizer. For some reason the Cocteaus tend to be clumped next to Talk Talk. I could not be more appalled. The drum machine is the closest thing CT ever came to being remotely related to synth pop.\n\nWere Talk Talk at all influencial on the dreampop scene or even shoegaze? I noticed they were always clumped together with the Cocteaus. Never heard or noticed any similarities. In fact I was listening to some podcast where both were referred to as SYNTHPOP which kind of outraged me to be honest. Part of the reason I love the whole shoegaze, dreampop, jangle pop, twee and c86 scene or era was because of the fact that started slowly phasing out the synthwave scene which I absolutely loathe. The closest thing I could think of as to why the Cocteaus were mentioned in the same breath as synthpop was because of their drum machine early on but still can’t put the two together.\n\nCool. Here in LA, maybe bimonthly, at various clubs the Cocteau Twins will have a special appreciation night and a lot of times they’ll share it with other bands. They’ll sometimes have women of dreampop and shoegaze night which they should have had this week when it was Women’s Appreciation Day....well actually the whole month is Women’s Appreciation Month so they could definitely do something. But yeah, Slowdive, Lush, Curve and even MBV on Valentines Day have all gotten to share the spotlight with Cocteaus on their tribute shows. Of course it’s all only djs spinning their favorite songs but sometimes they’ll have a shoegaze related band perform a few songs here and there.\n\nGreat track by Death In Vegas featuring Hope Sandoval. It's not strictly shoegaze per se, but a great track, but an interesting collaboration between her and DIV. Liam Gallagher also made a guest appearance on this particular album, Scorpio Rising, and Oasis' first album, which is kind of regarded as being shoegaze-ish. Strangely, this is the only album from DIV that is not available from them on Spotify.\n\nR97 I am a big fan of Adorable and cherish that record. I think they were the purest example of Dream Pop on the whole 90s scene, and were extremely underrated (barely anyone remembers them now). I wish I could have seen them live.\n\nTheir most sublime track was the obscure single ‘Sunshine Smile’ with its sparkling delirious video. I also still frequently listen to ‘Vendetta’, ‘Submarine’ & ‘Glorious’ to this very day (27 years later!)\n\nR135 frankly I’m in shock that another fan still exists in the world, that’s beautiful. Not to mention that I am oozing green. Your friend struck gold! I have always loved Pete’s unique down-to-Earth yearning voice (it captures the early 90s really well, somehow), and confess to having a little crush on him too (it was the floppy hair).\n\nPlease post a track by your friend here if she doesn’t mind; it would be interesting to see how Adorable shaped her sound..\n\nR127 to my joyful relief I still own a CD copy of SCORPIO RISING, an original I bought at HMV in ‘02/3 sometime. Knowing that it’s obscure and not on streaming (yet) makes me even more glad to have it! Hope’s KILLING SMILE is definitely the best song on the album (of course it is, she’s a Goddess) but the entire record is eminently spinnable in its entirety 18 years on. It’s perfect for getting into a focused trance, or for making out..\n\nI’m not a fan of Oasis -more of a Verve/Travis girl - but even I really get into Liam Gallagher’s vocals on the title track. Did he write the lyrics? Because if he did they’re surprisingly excellent, melon-twisting poetry. I have always thought he sounds pretty sexy singing that cut, too, which again is not an epithet I have never before or since associated with Liam Gallagher."
