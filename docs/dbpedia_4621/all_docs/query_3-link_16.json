        "text": "Reviewers have never been short of confidence. It takes some temerity to believe, after all, that what you write will have any influence on a reader’s taste in books and music. Or at the very least, there’s that warm feeling you get from seeing your work published in a magazine – which you can then brag about on your CV. But with power comes responsibility; and so when reviewers take it upon themselves to write a bad review about an upcoming band, the consequences can be unforgiving. This was certainly what happened in the early 90s, when bands connected with a new London-based underground scene faced the wrath of music critics writing for influential magazines like NME and Melody Maker.\n\nAnd probably no band had it worse than Slowdive. Slowdive belonged to shoegaze, a genre of music so-called because the shy musicians pioneering the genre would seemingly gaze at their shoes while performing on stage. In truth, however, shoegaze musicians were looking not so much at their shoes as they were at their guitar pedals, for the genre, characterised by noisy, distorted guitars, subdued vocals, and introspective lyrics, made full use of effects. Slowdive were a typical shoegaze band in these particulars, and in 1993 they released their second album, Souvlaki, which is widely considered the second best shoegaze album of all time, after My Bloody Valentine’s Loveless.\n\nAnd boy, is Souvlaki a work of art. The album opens with Alison, where Neil Halstead, whose mellow vocals contend with swirling guitars, sounds like he’s drifting into a black hole. Indeed, upon listening to the album it is difficult not to contemplate space, for the gentle, dreamlike guitar playing resembles nothing particularly terrestrial. The second song, Machine Gun, is arguably even more spaced-out, as the angelic voice of Rachel Goswell makes the idea of drowning seem rather beautiful: “Just the weight of the water drags me down, again”. Of course the drowning is a metaphor for the sense of helplessness that accompanied Halstead and Goswell after they broke up just moments before they began making the album.\n\nThe idea that artists produce their best work in times of distress could not be more apt here, for the album is tinged with an unspeakable melancholy. But melancholy does not a dull album make; on the contrary, much of Souvlaki is energetic and uplifting. Souvlaki Space Station – a subtle piece of humour, if ever there was one – elicits the image of flying a Millenium Falcon through space at warp speed. The song’s ending is also notable: the distorted guitar that closes the song may have inspired Radiohead, for their song Karma Police creates a similar noise. Elsewhere, the opening chords of When the Sun Hits evoke a Beethovenian nightmare, if such a thing existed. Not long into the song, the chorus hits the listener at full strength, evoking very much what it would sound like to throw caution to the wind by riding a comet into the sun. Try listening to the song without getting goosebumps, I dare you; you’ll fail.\n\nThe rest of the album is more laidback, being something like a cross between country folk and noise rock. So When Slowdive closes with the forlorn Dagger, there is no mistaking the pain that love hath wrought:\n\nThe world is full of noises\n\nI hear it all the time\n\nYou know I am your dagger\n\nYou know I am your world\n\nDespite the brilliance of their album, Slowdive never received great critical or commercial success, eventually leading their label, the famous Creation Records, to drop them in favour of an upcoming Manchester band called Oasis. But moving forwards twenty-one years, Slowdive remains a delight to anyone lucky enough to discover them."
