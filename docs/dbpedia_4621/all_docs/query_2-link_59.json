        "text": "If you’ve read my previous articles, you’d know I’m a big fan of the shoegaze and dream pop genres. I love putting on a good pair of headphones and just floating in a wall of sound; when I was introduced to Slowdive, I was smitten. They’re a third of the shoegaze triumvirate – Slowdive, along with My Bloody Valentine and the Cocteau Twins, pretty much invented the genre in late-1980s Britain. These bands are popular in the indie scene, known for releasing Souvlaki, Loveless, and Heaven or Las Vegas, respectively. I’ll be focusing on Slowdive for this review.\n\nMany consider Slowdive’s 1993 release Souvlaki to be a masterpiece. Opener “Alison,” “Souvlaki Space Station,” “When the Sun Hits,” and “Dagger” are classics – and, while I certainly like them (In fact, I tried to cover “Dagger” which you can listen to here.), they have some stiff competition: Slowdive’s most recent album, Slowdive. After a few listens, I was in love. It has since risen the ranks to become my current favorite album."
