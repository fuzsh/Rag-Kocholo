Highlights include synthesizer contributions from Brian Eno on \"Sing\" (which he co-wrote) and \"Here She Comes\". It's considered as one of the best Shoegaze albums of all time but didn't receive much credit during its release. It's just perfect in all terms, such as the wonderful tunes, captivating lyrics, and the excellent covert art.\n\nThe English shoegaze band Slowdive formed in 1989 and primarily consisted of Nick Chaplin (bass), Rachel Goswell (vocals, guitar), Christian Savill (guitar), Simon Scott (drums) and the band's primary songwriter Neil Halstead (vocals, guitar).\n\nHeavyweight audiophile vinyl produced by Music On Vinyl for Creation Records in 2019.\n\nTRACKLISTING:"
