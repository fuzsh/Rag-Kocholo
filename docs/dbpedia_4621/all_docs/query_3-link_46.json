        "text": "A multidisciplinary artist who’ve touched filmmaking, Danny Denial’s music is free and purely unhindered by genres. Having been initiated to their music through the excellent Dead Like Me album, we discovered a well-crafted blend of Punk approach, Indie sound and Pop sensibility. Their new album, Fuck Danny Denial, freshly out on Cruisin’ Records, finds them exploring their Pop side a little deeper, leaning more heavily on synths and sampling. The approach does remain against the grain though, with thick arrangements and a dark, Goth atmosphere throughout. In parallel, Danny is also the frontperson of the equally adventurous-sounding band Dark Smith, offering a shoegaze-leaning, Goth Dreampunk.\n\nfuck danny denial by Danny Denial Dead Like Me by Danny Denial DEGRESSIVE by DARK SMITH\n\nName five songs that you consider “perfect songs” and explain why or what they mean to you.\n\nWhen The Sun Hits by SLOWDIVE – This song always sets the mood, and is one of my favorite examples of a musical swell and release. It feels euphoric and grim and all-consuming in a way that always moves me, and it’s been frequently used in my favorite filmmaker Gregg Araki’s work so it’s visually evocative to me.\n\nPissing In A River by PATTI SMITH – I always search for this in karaoke books to sing, but it’s sadly not popular enough for karaoke. Which is too bad because it boasts an incredible wealth of emotion and raw power from Patti’s vocal as the song builds, and that’s something I strive to do in my music. It’s also cinematic in the way it paints a scene by the song’s end, and it’s one of my all-time-favorites for that.\n\nTransgender Dysphoria Blues by AGAINST ME! – This is one of those songs that perfectly captures queer rage without pulling punches. I discovered this record alongside reading Laura Jane Grace’s memoir when it came out and was inspired in a way that stuck with me until writing my current record, where I essentially quote her lyrics in my song White tears fake queers.\n\nOrphans by TEENAGE JESUS AND THE JERKS – I’ve always had an affinity for Lydia Lunch’s snarly, thorny vocal and this track deploys it perfectly with a relentless guitar line that teeters on militant over its runtime.\n\n212 by AZEALIA BANKS – Her antics aside, Azealia’s first single is one of my favorites to come from the Pop/Hip Hop scene in the past ten years, period. It’s brash and ferocious and makes no apologies for itself. It’s about the artist inhabiting a character and a swagger and committing from start to finish. It’s also, for the record, my go-to karaoke song and I think there’s a reason for that.\n\nWhich music genre do you listen to the most? List your five favorite albums in that genre.\n\nI most listen to 80’s New Wave, which is pretty deeply rooted in my musical influences- THE CURE’s Disintegration, JOY DIVISION’s Unknown Pleasures, SOFT CELL’s Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, BLONDIE’s Parallel Lines and as much as I hate to admit it, THE SMITH’s The Queen Is Dead. My music tastes vary and I see-saw between heavier Alternative and Metal as well, but the sensibilities of this era have always spoken to me most profoundly.\n\nYour five favorite rappers of all time? Name one song that best exemplifies what makes them great.\n\nI love rappers of all genres, really. Rap is a genre with a deep and heavy lineage, and I love how it lends itself to a domino effect of cultural impact that spans generations. I love the 90’s legends like TUPAC (If I Die Tonight) and CHUCK D (Generation Wrekkked). I also love contemporary rappers like KENDRICK LAMAR (Alright) and LUPE FIASCO (Words I Never Said), and up and coming rappers like my good friend DONORMAAL (Buckle) from Seattle.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite song lyrics? Lyrics that have been important to you or that had an impact on you?\n\nFollowing up the question on my favorite Rap artists, CHUCK D’s Generation Wrekkked is one of my all-time favorite songs that is constantly a reference point to me in various points in my life, and it’s heavily one at this moment in time at the front lines of this movement. The line “If I can’t change the people around me, I change the people around me” has always haunted me and right now, it’s empowering to me. I love lyrics that can be interpreted by the reader, and pack weight from different perspectives.\n\nWhat are your ten favourite albums of all time (all genres)? Name a standout track on each of these albums.\n\nBETTY DAVIS- Nasty Gal (F.U.N.K.) – Funk/Soul\n\nSONIC YOUTH- Goo (Tunic (Song for Karen)) – Indie/Alternative\n\nPATTI SMITH- Radio Ethiopia (Pissing In A River) – Blues/Rock\n\nTHE CURE- Disintegration (Fascination Street) – New Wave\n\nSLOWDIVE- Slouvaki (Avalyn) – Shoegaze\n\nCATHERINE WHEEL- Ferment (I Want To Touch You) – Indie/Alternative\n\nNINE INCH NAILS- With Teeth (Right Where It Belongs) – Pop/Rock\n\nHOLE- Pretty On The Inside (Mrs. Jones) – Grunge\n\nSOFT MOON- Deeper (Far) – Noise/Rock\n\nSKY FERREIRA- Nighttime My Time (Everything Is Embarrassing) – Indie Pop\n\nDo you remember the first time music had an impact on you?\n\nI was raised in a household that didn’t encourage or allow much music, aside from Jazz and Celine Dion, so I didn’t even become exposed to popular music until I was around ten or eleven. That’s when I discovered MTV and I “saw” my first songs in video form by BLINK-182 and BRITNEY SPEARS. Then a lot of my friends exposed me to Rap music and Emo bands of the early 2000’s, but none of them connected with me in a profound way. It was an interesting entry point to dive into the history of Pop music, working backwards to the 90’s and 80’s until I found the first bands I loved which were NIRVANA and SONIC YOUTH and THE SMITHS. It was seeing those bands pouring their souls on to the stage that inspired me to grab a guitar and teach myself how to do it, too.\n\nWhat are some of the most memorable shows you’ve ever seen? What makes them stand out?\n\nHonestly, my most recent show was a pretty profound experience for me. I saw PATRICK WOLF at a church in London in January, one of his first shows he’s done in years. It was stripped back and retrofitted for the space. He played guitar and piano and violin and it was both intimate and theatrical and I was moved to tears for the first time watching him perform The Sun Is Often Out. It was a magical night for me, I have always loved his music.\n\nWhat is the most impressive band you’ve toured with? The one that you just had to watch every night? Did you learn anything from them/by watching them?\n\nIt wasn’t a tour, but my band Dark Smith opened for MUDHONEY last year and it was a huge deal for me as a fanboy of all of the Grunge icons of the 90’s. Watching Mark Arm, after FOUR decades, ripping up the stage and doing it from the heart, it inspired me in ways I wasn’t prepared for. It was incredibly humbling to see how true professionals carry themselves and treat everyone from the handlers to the techs to the audience.\n\nWhat are some of your all-time favorite music books and/or zines, documentaries, biopics?\n\nI really loved Amy, the documentary about AMY WINEHOUSE alot, and The Punk Singer, about KATHLEEN HANNA, mostly because both were unflinching in a way that was still heartfelt. My current all-time favorite is probably They Say I’m Different, about BETTY DAVIS who I have always loved and admired as an enigmatic figure in Funk music. It was fascinating to watch a story about a woman who made her mark and then chose a quiet life out of the public eye, and the film did a good job of illustrating the reasons why.\n\nDo you have any unpopular music opinion that you would like to defend? Something that you love and yet can hardly find anyone to agree on how great it is?\n\nI love Courtney Love and HOLE. I think it’s widely popular to dismiss her band as a vanity project for a destructive narcissist who only cared about fame and fortune, but honestly her discography is solid. In her height, she captured female rage in a way that was messy, uncomfortable, and empowering for so many and I don’t think she gets enough credit for that. Also, unpopularly… I think KANYE was great all the way up until Donald Trump became President. Yeezus and The Life of Pablo were solid albums. After that, yeah, I tapped out.\n\nCan you think of a band or artist that put out only one fantastic release (album, EP or demo) and then disbanded? One that you really wish would have kept going?\n\nI think LIL PEEP was onto something great with his double LP Come Over When You’re Sober, with part 2 releasing and being bundled with part 1 right after his death. He led the way for the resurgence of genre play and Soundcloud rappers and Emo revival and I think we’re still seeing a lot of his influences in young artists right now. I think he did an incredible job of creating landscapes with his music, and I listen to that record constantly now.\n\nWhat are some up and coming artists that you would recommend?\n\nI think the local scene in Seattle right now has SO MUCH talent that is underlooked. I love THE BLACK TONES, GUAYABA, BLACK ENDS, DONORMAAL, RAT QUEEN and RACHAEL’S CHILDREN. They are some of Seattle’s best and I want to see them blow up this decade!\n\nPlaid Pants by The Black Tones Guayaba Presents: Fantasmagoría by Guayaba What by Black Ends THIRD DAUGHTER by doNormaal Worthless by Rat Queen Running by Rachaels Children\n\nWhat are you listening to right now, while answering these questions?\n\nRight now I’m listening to Sabrina Segment by URUGUAY who are an incredible duo from New York. It’s moody and beautiful and one of my favorite songs of the year so far.\n\nSabrina Segment by URUGUAY"
