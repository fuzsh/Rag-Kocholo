        "text": "COALTAR OF THE DEEPERS – No Thank You (2001)\n\nFor those looking for a unique mixture of Alternative Metal and Shoegaze, then COALTAR OF THE DEEPERS may be up your alley. They’ve had a rich history throughout their discography in experimenting with numerous types of genres into their music, incorporating Electronic beats, Dream Pop and heavier noises later on. With No Thank You, this is no exception as the band meshes all of these genres together into one, creating one of their most dynamic albums along with Yukari Telepath and newave. Personally, I’ve felt like No Thank You showcased their Shoegaze capabilities the most. “Joy Ride” and “Good Morning” are just a few of the songs in this album that encapsulates how talented the band is by fusing genres not normally seen together into one coherent piece. Now if only they were to release a new album soon… that would be great.\n\nKinoko Teikoku – eureka (2013)\n\neureka is arguably Kinoko Teikoku’s most shining moment in their career, fusing the drowned echoey guitars of their Shoegazey songs along with their more straightforward Rock tracks to create a wonderful balance of Indie Rock goodness. Their self-titled album track has got to be one of their harshest songs ever made, with the brutal feedback of the guitars dragging you as the song begins while it rings through your ears. Then you got the song “Musician,” a somber and reflective track that slowly opens up to you, until it explodes during its climax in the last two minutes. These are just a couple of great examples of how much the band has captured the attention of many by writing genuine Shoegaze songs from the heart.\n\npasteboard – glitter (2005)\n\nIf COALTAR OF THE DEEPERS and Kinoko Teikoku are a little too heavy for your tastes, don’t worry! Here comes pasteboard, a Shoegaze/Dream Pop band consisting of roly poly pag bear’s Mihoko Tanoue and Makoto Igarashi. Unfortunately, glitter was their only release, as they wanted to focus more on roly poly rag bear. Nonetheless, I feel so blessed that they took the time to make this album even as a one-off band because this is one of the most relaxing albums I’ve ever heard. The soft instrumentals and fuzzy vocals hits the right notes just perfectly. If you ever have a bad day, this album never fails to ease yourself and help calm your mood.\n\nTHE NOVEMBERS – Rhapsody in Beauty (2014)\n\nThe evolution of THE NOVEMBER’s music from straightforward Indie Rock to elegant Shoegaze is remarkable. It’s like they’ve found a new realm of creativity and in that came Rhapsody in Beauty, which saw the band fully embracing this new sound with its luscious textures and colorful song structure. When they rock out, they go all-out with songs like “Xeno” and “Blood Music. 1985” ripping your ears out with the gargantuan screeches of the guitars. Then you have songs like “Romancé,” which shows off a more sensual and vulnerable side of Yusuke Kobayashi’s genius songwriting. Not many bands can pull off this much versatility in their music but THE NOVEMBERS did it just right. One of the bands I’ll definitely be looking forward to in the future.\n\ncruyff in the bedroom – perfect silence (2002)\n\ncruyff in the bedroom are a well-known Japanese Shoegaze band, spanning six albums and 19 years as a band. Their 1st album, perfect silence, features a ton of noisy vacuum-ish guitar sounds and some excellent drum play. Though this album is pretty Shoegazey, instruments such as congos and minimal Electronic beats are also present to give perfect silence a more unique edge. You can hear some Post-Rock and Math Rock influences as well, which in turn compliments great alongside the fuzzy guitars. For a debut album, it’s quite impressive just how far cruyff in the bedroom has developed their musical style.\n\nBroken Little Sister – Memories, Violet & Demons (2010)\n\nMemories, Violet & Demons boasts an impressive set of songs, comprising of soft and ethereal Shoegaze/Dream Pop tunes with a hint of Electronic beats added into the mix. Songs like “Colour” and “Little Riot” create a hazy and dreamy atmosphere throughout its entirety, imagining yourself as if you were floating on clouds. The inclusion of minimal Electronic beats to the album adds a nice touch in creating a more consistent flow on their more sweeter-sounding tracks. Fans of My Bloody Valentine will find this album to be quite endearing.\n\nTokyo Shoegazer – Crystallize (2011)\n\nIt’s not a Shoegaze list without Tokyo Shoegazer! As one of the more popular bands on this list, they unfortunately disbanded in 2013 after releasing two studio albums. However, their debut album, Crystallize, captures some of their best work through its fast-paced melodies, the harmonious vocal exchanges between Yuki and Watanabe Kiyomi, and its loud, yet beautiful textures. Listening to this album with some good headphones was quite an experience the first time I listened to it. It’s highly reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine’s guitar sound, except more drowned out and compressed. For newcomers, I highly suggest starting with Crystallize as some sort of entry point into Shoegaze as you begin to dig deeper into the genre.\n\nPlastic Girl in Closet – Cocoro (2011)\n\nIf you don’t mind a more poppier approach to Shoegaze, then Plastic Girl in Closet’s Cocoro would be a great choice to listen to. Cute is a word not usually used to describe Shoegaze music but in this case, Cocoro contains many feel-good and bubbly moments throughout. Much of the guitars on this album are very crunchy, which adds more personality to a lot of their simplistic songs. If you look past the straightforwardness of Cocoro, you’ll find a very charming record pleasing to the ears for those who want something easy to digest.\n\nhoneydip – Portable Audio Silence (1999)\n\nFor fans who want something more obscure, honeydip’s Portable Audio Science will find its way into your favorite collection. The layers of distorted guitars and the subdued vocals create a very hazy and dreamy mood that could put you to sleep (in a good way). Their influences are very apparent, as some of their song titles are direct references to other popular and influential Shoegaze bands such as Slowdive and the Jesus and Mary Chain. While Portable Audio Science doesn’t break new grounds by any means, their music deserves to be recognized for their tireless effort to stand out from the rest of the crowd.\n\nHartfield – True Color, True Lie (2004)\n\nHartfield’s True Color, True Lie relies on a cleaner tone and sunny melodies to convey their music and it works really well. Unlike a lot of Shoegaze bands that play slow and heavy-hitting songs that takes time to grow, Hartfield keeps it straightforward by playing quick-tempoed pop melodies for listeners to easily follow along. This safe route allows for listeners of different variety to come in and listen with little to no worries. It’s a lot more accessible to listen to, as compared to some of the albums mentioned on this list so I recommend to start here as well.\n\nShojoskip – Cosodorokitsune (2012)\n\nShojoskip is more well-known and highly regarded by a lot of their Western listeners, and for a good reason. Much of the songs in Cosodorokitsune are heavily Post-Rock inspired, with most of them clocking in at five minutes long or more. You won’t hear as much vocals as you do in other Shoegaze albums since the instrumentals take much of the priority. But when you do, they’re more placed as background vocals to make the songs sound more delightful and dream-like. The emotional build-ups create a sentimental connection between the listener and the music to have a lasting impact. If you have the patience to sit through over an hour of luscious and smooth-paced Shoegaze/Post-Rock music, then Shojoskip is the band for you.\n\nLuminous Orange – Drop You Vivid Colours (2002)\n\n“Stereolab and Sonic Youth meets Shoegaze” would probably be the first thing to come to mind whenever you think of Luminous Orange and this album. Drop You Vivid Colours contains many catchy and colorful moments with the help of its loud jangly guitar riffs and squeaky clean distortions. There’s a nice balance in the mix, with the guitars not sounding too noisy or the vocals not being too indistinguishable. I found this nice because other bands crank up their guitars to 11, which makes it harder to distinguish what’s going on in the song but with this album, you can clearly hear everything with little to no problems. Overall, another nice addition for a more adventurous Shoegaze album.\n\nSupercar – OOKeah!! (1999)\n\nA personal favorite band of mine. OOKeah!! introduces many Techno-like elements in the band’s discography, which would be the essential sound in their later albums. The guitars are very compressed to create that Shoegazey sound, which fits quite well with the Techno aspects. Since every track is less than five minutes long, it compensates for a more digestible album than their other albums. Though it’s not the best in Supecar’s discography, it’s a nice in-your-face album with a consistent flow.\n\nClams – Clams (2003)\n\nAnother criminally underrated Japanese Shoegaze band that deserves more attention because of their harmonious vocals and the walls of noise that serenades through your ears. On their slower and softer-sounding songs, Clams perfectly maintains their subtle ambience while producing pretty melodies. Their distortions may sound a bit cleaner and softer but the static effects and hypnotizing leads make up for it. The microphone-ish vocals are very 90s-esque and nods towards a more classic-sounding feeling to it.\n\nMy Dead Girlfriend – Underdrawing For Three Forms of Unhappiness At the State of Existence (2012)\n\nUnderdrawing For Three Forms of Unhappiness At the State of Existence is a departure from their previous EP record, which now features a more poppy and upbeat direction while keeping the dark and sentimental lyrics. I really loved where the band was going for with this release. At only six tracks, it wastes no time sucking you into its world. Most of the vocals contain both a male and female singer singing at the same time to create an exchange of duality, as if both of them are singing about longing for each other. These underlying messages masked behind their upbeat sound makes for a more enjoyable experience that makes the listener more attached to the meaning behind each song."
