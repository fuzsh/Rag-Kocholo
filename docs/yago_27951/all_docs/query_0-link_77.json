        "text": "San Francisco has been the backdrop for many beloved films, but few capture the city's scenic beauty and unique charm quite like \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" The 1993 comedy starring the late Robin Williams showcased his remarkable comedic talent and highlighted some of San Francisco's most iconic locations.\n\nA “Mrs. Doubtfire” tour of San Francisco is more than a walk down memory lane; it's a tribute to Robin Williams's humor and big heart. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to “Mrs. Doubtfire”'s magic, these sites offer a unique way to experience the city through the lens of one of its most cherished films and local talents.\n\nMany of these famous locations are easy to pick out, like the Golden Gate Bridge, iconic Cable Cars, and other historic landmarks. Here are some of the top filming locations in San Francisco to start your tour!\n\nCrissy Field\n\nBetween Fort Point and Marina Green\n\nThis famous location in San Francisco's Presidio is where the montage of family fun in the city was filmed. Playing soccer and riding bikes is common in this area, not just for the Hillard family, but also for many locals and visitors. Enjoy a sunny day in this beautiful part of San Francisco with grassy fields, a beach, and stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Also, be sure to check out the new Tunnel Tops Park, which spans 14 acres and connects the Presidio to Crissy Field.\n\nDaniel’s Apartment\n\n520-522 Green St.\n\nIn North Beach, Robin Williams’s character, Daniel, finds his own apartment, where he struggles to show that he can be a stable parent for his children. It’s here that Daniel, half-disguised as Mrs. Doubtfire, tries to convince a social worker that he has accomplished all the tasks she gave him— while wearing a face full of whipped cream to cover his tracks. Take a selfie outside and say, “Helloooo!”\n\nThe Hillard House\n\n2640 Steiner St.\n\nOne of the most recognizable locations from the film is the Hillard family home. Located in the picturesque Pacific Heights neighborhood, this house served as the exterior of the family’s residence. Fans of the film will remember the memorable scenes of Mrs. Doubtfire’s comical entrances and exits. While it's now a private residence, you can still snap photos from the street and admire the beautiful architecture that captured the essence of San Francisco.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle\n\n901 Mission St.\n\nHead downtown to 901 Mission Street, where scenes from Daniel’s job interview were filmed. The imposing home of The San Francisco Chronicle represents the hustle and bustle of Daniel’s struggle to balance work and family life. This area of the city has continued to evolve and now has a new park filled with free public art for you to explore. Be sure to check out the Wind Baffles art installation that lights up the Parks at 5M in the evenings.\n\nWhile the movie is set entirely in San Francisco, many East Bay locations, including historic hotels and infamous restaurants, were also used in the film; here are the top spots across the bay.\n\nBridges Restaurant\n\n44 Church St., Danville\n\n“Help is on the way!” Take a short drive out of the city to Danville to visit Bridges Restaurant, the site of one of the film’s most hilarious scenes. This is where Daniel tries to juggle two simultaneous dinners: one with his family, as Mrs. Doubtfire, and another with his boss, as himself. The restaurant still welcomes diners today, offering a chance to eat where Robin Williams’s comedic genius was on full display—and almost one-upped by his leading lady, Sally Field.\n\nThe Claremont Club & Spa\n\n41 Tunnel Rd, Berkeley\n\nNestled in the Berkeley Hills overlooking San Francisco Bay, The Claremont Club & Spa is a historic luxury hotel that has been a Bay Area landmark since 1915. It's here that Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, joins his family and his ex-wife's new boyfriend for a swim—and instigates an infamous \"run-by fruiting\". You can book a night here and relax in their plush rooms or get a day pass and enjoy the pool and spa with amazing views of San Francisco.\n\nRobin Williams Meadow\n\nLocated within Golden Gate Park, Robin Williams Meadow is a touching tribute to the actor's legacy. Originally named Sharon Meadow, it was renamed in 2018 to honor Williams’ contributions to entertainment and his love for San Francisco. The meadow is a perfect spot to reflect on the joy that he brought to countless fans around the world.\n\nWhere Robin Williams Lived\n\nWilliams lived in the Bay Area for many years, calling multiple locations home. Most notably, he owned a house in the exclusive Sea Cliff neighborhood, known for its luxurious homes, beautifully manicured lawns, and famous residents. He also owned a home in Tiburon, just north of San Francisco. This waterfront community is a great place to explore and just a quick ferry ride from downtown."
