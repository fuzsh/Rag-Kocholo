        "text": "Columbus said it wasn't until 2014, the year Williams died, that the two ever talked about a sequel. The two met at Williams' house, and it was the last time Columbus saw his friend alive.\n\n\"I went to his house and we sat down and talked about it and the script was really strong,\" Columbus recalled.\n\nBut the \"Home Alone\" director did remember Williams had one major note for him: \"Do I have to be in the suit as much this time?\"\n\nColumbus understood his star's concern. After all, the Oscar-winner was in his early 60s at the time of the discussion around a potential sequel. Also, Columbus had seen first-hand how demanding it was for Williams to play the character twenty-plus years ago â€” the transformation took as long as five hours in the make-up trailer to complete.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"As we went further into production, it got a little quicker. Regardless, we never could shoot two consecutive days of Robin as Mrs. Doubtfire because he was waking up at 3 in the morning to get into makeup, so by 8 a.m. we could shoot,\" he told BI. \"It was a punishing day for him, so always the next day, we would shoot him as Daniel.\"\n\nSome 2 million feet of film was used to capture Williams' performance in the first movie.\n\n\"For Robin, I think it was like running a marathon every day he was in the Doubtfire costume,\" Columbus said.\n\nHowever, with Williams' death, any sequel chatter ended. And if it were up to Columbus, it would be forever.\n\n\"There will never be a sequel to 'Mrs. Doubtfire,'\" Columbus said.\n\nBut Disney owns the movie, not Columbus or the Williams family. So it's technically in the hands of the studio.\n\n\"The studio can do whatever they want with it,\" Columbus said. \"Should they? God no. I will certainly be very vocal about it if they decide to do it.\""
