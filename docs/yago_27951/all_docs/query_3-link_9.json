        "text": "01 of 09\n\nMrs. Doubtfire, then and now\n\nIn 1993, Robin Williams took an age-old comedy trope — a person disguising themselves as another gender — and spun it into gold in Mrs. Doubtfire. Based on the book Alias Madame Doubtfire, and directed by Chris Columbus, the film leaned into Williams' renowned skills as an improviser and comedian to tell the tale of Daniel Hillard, a man who disguises himself as a Scottish housekeeper in order to stay close to his kids after his divorce. The film featured some of the best and brightest talents of the early-'90s, while also providing a showcase for its three adorable child actors. Where are they now?\n\n02 of 09\n\nRobin Williams (Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire)\n\nWilliams was already a household name by 1993, breaking out on Mork & Mindy in the early-1980s and having appeared in films like Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Dead Poets Society (1989), and Hook (1991), and voicing Genie in Aladdin (1992). Known for his improvisational style, Williams was given free rein as Mrs. Doubtfire, inventing the character's voice and look from the ground up and frequently riffing off-script in his scenes.\n\nAfter delighting audiences in the movie, he continued to dominate film screens in the 1990s in the likes of Jumanji (1995), The Birdcage (1996), Flubber (1997), and Patch Adams (1998). In 1998, he won an Oscar for his portrayal of Sean, Will Hunting's (Matt Damon) therapist, in Good Will Hunting. Continuing into the 2000s, he worked steadily in serious films (2001's A.I. Artificial Intelligence, 2002's One Hour Photo) and children's movies (2006's Happy Feet and RV), as well as playing a recurring role as Teddy Roosevelt in the Night at the Museum films.\n\nIn 2013, he returned to his TV roots on the short-lived CBS sitcom The Crazy Ones. Williams tragically took his own life in 2014 at the age of 63.\n\n03 of 09\n\nSally Field (Miranda Hillard)\n\nLike her costar Williams, Sally Field got her start on television with shows like Gidget and The Flying Nun. In the late-1970s, she transitioned to movie stardom with a leading role in Smokey and the Bandit (1977), moving on to more prestige fare and winning Oscars for both Norma Rae (1979) and Places in the Heart (1984). Field was well into her career by the time she portrayed Miranda Hillard, Daniel's ex-wife who yearns for an emotionally and financially supportive partner.\n\nShe has continued a diverse career in film (1994's Forrest Gump, 2012's Lincoln and The Amazing Spider-Man) since.
