        "text": "Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams), an out-of-work voiceover actor, is a man who will do anything to be with his three children. Unfortunately, the things that his kids love about him--his wild sense of humor, his carefree view of life--are the traits which prevent him from being the husband his wife Miranda (Sally Field) needs him to be. After fourteen years of marriage she has asked for a divorce and has been granted temporary custody of the children, in spite of Daniel's emotional protests.\n\nUnwilling to accept the role of weekend father, possessed with only an inventive imagination, an actor's flair and the determination to go to any length necessary to hang onto his kids, Daniel is going to have to become a whole new man--in a very unlikely fashion.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox presents a Blue Wolf Production of a Chris Columbus Film, \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" starring Robin Williams and Sally Field. It is directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon, based upon \"Alias Madam Doubtfire\" by Anne Fine. Marsha Garces Williams, Robin Williams and Mark Radcliffe are producing; Matthew Rushton serves as executive producer. The co-producer is Joan Bradshaw. The film also stars Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein and Robert Prosky. The film's soundtrack is available on Fox Records.\n\n\"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" which finds Robin Williams adding a sixty-year-old British woman to his gallery of brilliant comic portrayals, is the debut fim for Blue Wolf Productions, the company run by Robin Williams and Marsha Garces Williams. This story of a man who poses as his estranged wife's housekeeper in order to be near his children struck a chord in the couple that went beyond the initial hook of its comic, cross-dressing premise.\n\n\"Marsha and I thought it was an interesting way of looking at how children are dealt with in divorces,\" explains Robin Williams about choosing \"Mrs. Doubfire\" as Blue Wolf's first production. \"A lot of times children are little hostages being passed back and forth and this film uses comedy and the character to look at that. That's the whole reason I wanted to do it.\"\n\n\"I liked the grain of the idea when I read the book several years ago,\" adds Marsha Garces Williams. \"For a father to be so desperate to see his children that he'd go to such great lengths appealed to me. I loved the character's range. He's a man who is angry, sad, jealous, funny and warm at the same time.\"\n\nThe challenge of portraying the lead character in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" was very appealing to Robin Williams. \"It's wonderful to get to play a person inside of a person,\" he admits. \"It's almost like possession, like the old Mardi Gras masks--you know there's a someone inside there. It's two different worlds at once. There's fun in that, but sadness, too. Daniel hears things that he couldn't hear as himself.\"\n\nDirector Chris Columbus follows the historic successes of \"Home Alone\" and \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\" with \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\"\n\n\"I wanted to make this film because of two things,\" Columbus says. \"First of all, it's rare to find a comedy script with an original premise that works this well, and on top of that there was the opportunity to work with Robin, who I think is a genius. It's also a chance to move slightly away from the type of comedies I've been doing and try a more sophisticated adult comedy.\n\n\"The point of this movie is that as long as there's love, there's a family,\" continues the director. \"If there are people who love each other and are a unit, there's a family, whether it's a single mother with kids, or a single father with kids, or a traditional two-parent situation. We also wanted this to be a realistic picture, in that in 99 percent of divorces, kids don't see their parents get back together. In most cases, parents stay divorced and move on with their lives, and kids have to come to terms with that.\"\n\n\"If Daniel has a flaw,\" Robin Williams observes, \"it's that he would let his kids do anything, and he'll do anything with them. He has no real boundaries. He doesn't discipline as much as just explore life with them. He can't take it when he's denied access to them. He says he's addicted to them and that the idea of not being around them is like saying he can't breathe. He has to take an extreme measure.\"\n\nAbout the Production\n\n\"We all wanted Mrs. Doubtfire to be someone who would be the perfect grandmother,\" explains Columbus. \"We looked through hundreds and hundreds of photographs until we found a portrait of an older English woman. She had an incredibly sweet face, pretty, prim, very popular and extremely warm. It became the key to Mrs. Doubtfire's look. But what makes Mrs. Doubtfire such a colorful character is that inside of her is Robin's energy.\"\n\nThe elaborate process to transform Robin Williams into Mrs. Doubtfire began with the makeup that was specially designed by Greg Cannom, Academy-Award winnner for \"Dracula.\" Four-and-one-half hours were required for makeup artist Ve Neill (Academy Award-winner for \"Beetlejuice,\" Academy Award nominations for \"Edward Scissorhands,\" \"Batman,\" \"Batman Returns\") to apply the complicated series of latex pieces to Robin Williams' face and then paint the surface to simulate accurate skin tone. After the wig was secured by hairstylist Yolanda Toussieng (\"Batman Returns,\" \"Edward Scissorhands\"), Williams would put on a body suit that changes his shape to that of a pudgy, older woman. Finally, the carefully fitted wardrobe designed by Marit Allen (\"The Secret Garden,\" \"Shining Through\") completed his transformation into Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\n\"High heels are the most sinister invention of the last two centuries!\" jokes Robin Williams when reminiscing on the many long days as Mrs. Doubtfire. \"I mean, what they do to your spine alone, even if they do make your legs look great!\"\n\nPortraying an older woman had many more serious resonances for the actor. \"I got to be this sweet, warm, lovable woman with a very nurturing side in a world that sometimes doesn't tolerate old age very well.\"\n\nEven his youngest son was fooled, until \"I spoke as myself to him,\" recalls Wiliams, \"but he's also seen me as a bat, a genie, all sorts of different things, so it was like 'Oh, great, Dad's an old lady now, add it to the list!'\"\n\nFor Marsha Williams, the experience of seeing her husband as the character of Mrs. Doubtfire was a strange sensation. \"It was hard for me to believe that it was him under that face and that body. He was instilled with the spirit of a sixty-year-old woman.\"\n\nSally Field was the only actress that director Chris Columbus envisioned as Miranda. \"When I was working on the script I found that I was thinking of her. Casting Sally was my objective from day one,\" remembers Columbus. \"She's the kind of actress who adds depth and density to a character without pushing it too far in one direction. It's important to me that Miranda and Daniel are completely real people. Sally helps get that point across.\"\n\n\"Sally's a presence, even in scenes where she had little to say,\" explains Robin Williams. \"She does all this preparation for each scene, whether it's powerful or devestating or sweet or simple.\"\n\nField shares a mutual admiration for her co-star. \"It was like having two co-stars. You sort of forget that Mrs. Doubtfire is Robin and you think it's this other person. And when he's Daniel, it's just so much fun. You really just have to stay alive and watch him take flight and try to go where he goes. You never get bored!\"\n\nChris Columbus' expectations of working with Robin Williams were more than met. \"I think James Brown will finally lose his title as the 'Hardest Working Man in Show Business' to Robin,\" enthuses the director. \"Robin just gives and gives and gives 'til there's nothing else to give. He puts on an amazing performance every day and when he's not in front of the cameras, he's entertaining the crew. It's almost as if he's possessed by the Holy Ghost of Comedy. It's an honor to be working with him.\"\n\n\"Chris has seen so many films that he has an incredible kind of bibliography of movies in the back of his mind,\" says Robin Williams. \"The fact that he's in his thirties--he looks so young you want to see his ID--and he knows so much is extraordinary. He has a great sense of humor, story, character and comedy.\"\n\n\"Chris is very confident, smart and a wonderful director,\" adds Marsha Williams. \"These qualities allow him to sift through all the ideas Robin has without being threatened by them. Chris picks what works the best because he knows what he needs. They've had a great working relationship because Chris knows when he's gotten enough. Which is terrific because Robin could go on forever if you let him!\"\n\n\"People think of Chris in terms of comedy, yet he brings such a warmth to this project,\" says producer Mark Radcliffe, who has worked with Columbus on four of his previous films. \"'Mrs. Doubtfire' is a perfect project for Chris in that it's a dramatic story that builds comedy from the circumstances.\n\n\"Combining drama and comedy can get tricky, but Chris has such a solid sense of structuring a movie, he handles the transitions perfectly.\"\n\nJoining Robin Williams and Sally Field in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" are Pierce Brosnan as Stu, a former boyfriend and current client of Miranda's; Harvey Fierstein as Daniel's brother Frank, a makeup artist who helps him create Mrs. Doubtfire's look, and Robert Prosky as Mr. Lundy, the boss who recognizes Daniel's true talent.\n\nFinding actors to play the Hillards' three children was challenging, but few directors have the experience working with youngsters that Chris Columbus has. \"I was looking for real kids to convey a sense of pain and trouble and confusion about divorce,\" says the director. \"These kids are all very naturalistic in their approach to acting and their performances are believable.\"\n\nLisa Jakub plays Lydia, the Hillards' oldest child. Jakub most recently starred in \"Matinee\" as a free-thinking teenager who thinks her life is over. Matthew Lawrence is Chris, the middle child and only son. Lawrence recently starred in the NBC series \"Walter and Emily,\" as the grandson of Cloris Leachman and Brian Keith. Mara Wilson makes her film debut as five-year-old Natalie.\n\n\"Mrs. Doubtfire\" was shot entirely in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Locations used in the film included such neighborhoods as Pacific Heights and North Beach, an office building on The Embarcadero offering spectacular downtown and Bay views from its penthouse suite, scenic Crissy Field near the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Hyde Street cable car. East Bay locations included the Claremont Hotel, KTVU-2 Studios and Bridges, a well-known area restaurant.\n\nThe production also filmed in a 100,000 square foot building in Richmond, a former candy warehouse, where five large sets were built.\n\nThe director of photography on \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is Donald McAlpine, A.S.C. (\"Parenthood\"), the production designer is Angelo Graham (an Oscar-winner for \"The Godfather, Part II\"), the film is edited by Raja Gosnell (\"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\") and the music is by Howard Shore (\"Silence of the Lambs\"). Adding his expertise to \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is legendary animation genius Chuck Jones, who supplied an original cartoon for the scenes in which Daniel performs his voiceover duties.\n\nAbout the Cast\n\nRobin Williams (Daniel/Mrs. Doubtfire, Producer) first dazzled audiences when he landed a guest-starring role on the television series \"Happy Days\" as Mork, a manic extraterrestrial. Viewer response was so great that Williams was immediately signed to do the spin-off series \"Mork and Mindy.\" Premiering in 1978 to instant popularity and rating success, the series soon led Williams into motion pictures.\n\nIn 1980, Williams made his film debut playing the title role of \"Popeye\" for director Robert Altman. \"The World According to Garp\" and \"Moscow on the Hudson\" followed.\n\n\"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" Barry Levinson's hit comedy-drama, earned Williams his first Academy Award nomination. \"Dead Poets Society,\" directed by Peter Weir, earned him a second Academy Award nomination.\n\nWilliams next starred opposite Robert De Niro in Penny Marshall's \"Awakenings\"; Terry Gilliam's \"The Fisher King\", receiving his third Academy Award nomination; Steven Spielberg's \"Hook\" and most recently, Barry Levinson's \"Toys.\" He has completed production on \"Being Human\" for director Bill Forsyth, which will be released next year.\n\nWilliams, who began his career as a stand-up comedian, has won four Grammy Awards for his comedy records \"Reality... What a Concept!\" and \"An Evening at the Met\"; the childrens' album \"Pecos Bill\" and the soundtrack to \"Good Morning, Vietnam.\"\n\n\"Robin Williams Live at the Met\" on HBO was the culmination of a 23-city SRO tour, which marked the first time a solo comic had taken the stage in the renowned opera hall. He won Emmies for his performance in the television specials, \"Carol, Carl, Whoopi and Robin\" and \"ABC Presents a Royal Gala.\" Williams has also starred with Steve Martin in Mike Nichols' off-Broadway stage adaptation of Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot.\"\n\nWilliams briefly studied political science at Claremont Men's College before entering Marin College to study theatre. His innate skills soon led him to enroll at Julliard Academy, where he spent three years under the tutelage of noted professionals including John Houseman.\n\nReturning to San Francisco, Williams joined a comedy workshop and began performing in small nightclubs. In 1976 he began performing regularly at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles, where casting agents recognized the offbeat sensibilities that led to his television roles.\n\nWilliams is also active in several humanitarian organizations and has been a primary force in \"Comic Relief,\" along with Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nLast year, Williams earned special achievement awards from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and the National Board of Review for his vocal contributions as \"Genie\" in \"Aladdin.\"\n\nSally Field (Miranda) is a two-time Academy Award-winner for her performances in \"Places in the Heart\" and \"Norma Rae.\" She received an Emmy for her title role as a young woman with multiple personalities in the four-hour television film \"Sybil\" with Joanne Woodward.\n\nField's film credits include starring roles in \"Soapdish,\" \"Not Without My Daughter,\" \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Surrender,\" \"Kiss Me Goodbye,\" \"Absence of Malice,\" \"Back Roads,\" \"The End,\" \"Hooper,\" \"Heroes\" and \"Smokey and the Bandit, Parts I and II.\" Her first major film was \"Stay Hungry,\" starring Jeff Bridges and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nFogwood Films, Field's production company, produced two films in which she also starred: \"Punchline\" and \"Murphy's Romance.\" Fogwood also produced the Julia Roberts drama \"Dying Young.\"\n\nBorn in Pasadena, California, and raised in a show business family, Field was enrolled in acting classes at Columbia Pictures when she was selected from 150 finalists to star in the television series \"Gidget.\" She went on to star in two other series, \"The Flying Nun\" and \"The Girl with Something Extra.\"\n\nPierce Brosnan (Stu) was an award-winning actor on the London stage and for BBC-TV before coming to international stardom in the title role of the hit NBC television series \"Remington Steele.\" Since that time, Brosnan has completed starring roles in such films as the $100 million grossing \"The Lawnmower Man,\" Bruce Beresford's \"Mr. Johnson\" and \"The Fourth Protocol\" with Michael Caine. He is currently in production on \"Love Affair\" in which he appears with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening.\n\nOn television Brosnan has also starred in such miniseries and television films as \"Noble House,\" \"Around the World in 80 Days,\" \"The Heist,\" \"The Broken Chain,\" \"Murder 101,\" and \"Victim of Love.\"\n\nBorn in County Meath, Ireland, Brosnan moved to London, England as a child. He studied classical drama and achieved recognition in the British theatre before he came to the attention of Americans in the landmark miniseries \"The Mansions of America.\"\n\nHarvey Fierstein (Frank) is an award-winning playwright and actor.

While shopping with her mother in Toronto, the young Canadian was spotted by an art director who was interested in using her in a commercial. Though that particular project did not work out, Lisa kept after he mother and finally met with a casting agent when she was four.\n\nLisa starred in a number of Canadian commercials and television series before seeking work, at age ten, in the United States. A small part in the NBC hit \"Night Court\" brought her to the attention of casting agents, leading to roles in the television movies \"The Story Lady\" opposite Jessica Tandy and \"The Rape of Dr. Willis\" with Jaclyn Smith. In the feature \"Rambling Rose,\" Lisa starred as the daughter of Robert Duvall and Diane Ladd, and last year she appeared in \"Matinee\" with John Goodman.\n\nLisa's other television credits include \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Knightwatch\" and \"Friday the 13th.\" She recently completed a ten-hour miniseries, \"Vendetta II,\" filmed in Italy and the U.S.\n\nMatthew Lawrence (Chris) began his acting career ten years ago at age 3 1/2 on \"Dynasty\" as Sammy Jo's son Danny. His second series regular role was Mark Hudson's son on \"Sara,\" starring Geena Davis. On the last season of the hit series \"Gimme A Break!\" Matthew played the long-lost sibling of his real-life brother, Joey, who currently stars in the series \"Blossom.\"\n\nMatthew played the title roles in the highly acclaimed television movies \"David,\" the true-life story of David Rothenberg, and \"Joshua's Heart\" opposite Tim Matheson and Melissa Gilbert.

After Danny's agent agreed to represent her, she was cast in commercials for Oscar Mayer, Texaco, Bank of America and Marshalls within the first few weeks.\n\nSeveral months later, Mara read for the role of Natalie and was soon called back to meet Robin Williams and Chris Columbus, who brought her together with Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence and several other children being considered. It quickly became obvious that Mara should round out the trio of Hillard children.\n\nMara lives in Burbank, California with her parents, three older brothers and younger sister.\n\nAbout the Filmmakers\n\nChris Columbus (Director) was born in Spangler, Pennsylvania, and grew up outside of Youngstown, Ohio. As a youngster, Columbus aspired to draw cartoons for Marvel Comics. He eventually discovered that comic books resembled the storyboards directors sketch for their movies. In high school, he began making 8mm films, drawing his own storyboards (which he continues to do). Upon graduation, he enrolled in the Directors Program at New York University's prestigious Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nIt was as a screenwriter that Columbus intially discovered success. While still a student, he sold his first script, \"Jocks,\" a semi-autobiographical comedy about a Catholic schoolboy who tries out for the football team.\n\nFollowing college, Columbus wrote a steeltown drama called \"Reckless,\" based on his experiences as a factory worker in Ohio. The film starred Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah under James Foley's direction.\n\nColumbus gained prominence in Hollywood with a trio of original scripts for Steven Spielberg--the 1984 comedy-thriller \"Gremlins,\" the 1985 adventure \"The Goonies\" and the fantasy \"Young Sherlock Holmes,\" which was directed by Barry Levinson.\n\nColumbus' screenwriting achievements led to his first two directorial efforts, \"Adventures in Babysitting\" and \"Heartbreak Hotel.\"\n\nHe continued his affiliation with Spielberg by contributing to the script for \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" before a chance meeting with John Hughes led to his directing assignment on \"Home Alone.\" The Twentieth Century Fox film became the most successful comedy and fourth highest-grossing movie of all time.\n\nFollowing \"Home Alone,\" Columbus directed Fox's poignant romantic comedy \"Only the Lonely\" from his own screenplay. Most recently, Columbus directed \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,\" which became another blockbuster hit worldwide.\n\nMarsha Garces Williams (Producer) is the president of Blue Wolf Productions and is the latest of a small group of women producing films in Hollywood.\n\nWilliams was raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She briefly attended the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, studying art, prior to moving to Northern California. At San Francisco State, Williams continued a study of art and Mandarin.\n\nAfter exploring various career opportunities, Williams landed a job caring for the young son of Robin Williams. A year later, she became his assistant, beginning their professional collaboration with his road tour for \"Live at the Met.\" She subsequently worked with him on all of his film and stage projects, including \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,\" \"Dead Poets Society,\" \"Awakenings,\" \"The Fisher King,\" \"Hook,\" \"Toys\" and \"Waiting for Godot.\" Most recently, Williams has spent her time running the family's various personal and professional corporations, and raising their children.\n\n\"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is the first feature to be produced under the Blue Wolf banner.\n\nMark Radcliffe (Producer) continues his longtime collaboration with Chris Columbus, having served as executive producer of \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,\" co-producer of \"Only the Lonely\" and associate producer and assistant director of \"Home Alone.\" Their first team effort was on \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" The Oklahoma native began his film career as an assistant director on Francis Ford Coppola's production \"The Escape Artist.\" He later joined Coppola on \"Rumble Fish\" and \"Peggy Sue Got Married.\"\n\nFor filmmaker John Hughes, Radcliffe was the assistant director on \"She's Having a Baby\" and \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles.\" He also worked as assistant director to Jerry Zucker on \"Ghost,\" with Donald Petrie on \"Mystic Pizza\" and with Paul Schrader on \"Light of Day.\"\n\nMatthew Rushton (Executive Producer) has produced or served as executive producer on numerous television films and stage plays. His credits include such films as \"Hot Paint,\" \"Red River,\" \"Spot Marks the X,\" \"Seduced,\" \"Oceans of Fire\" and \"Pleasures.\"\n\nMost recently, Rushton produced \"The Tower,\" a special effects film starring Paul Reiser for the Fox Network. \"The Tower\" recently aired as part of Fox's new \"Fox Night at the Movies\" series. It will be distributed theatrically overseas.\n\nRushton has produced such Los Angeles-area stage productions as \"Women Behind Bars\" and \"Bent.\"\n\nRandi Mayem Singer (Screenwriter) won the first annual Diane Thomas Screenwriting Award in 1987 for her screenplay \"A 22¢ Romance.\" Although still not produced, it brought her to the attention of Hollywood.\n\nSinger was raised in Palos Verdes, California. She studied political science at the University of California at Berkeley, and earned an M.A. in broadcast journalism from the University of Missouri. Pursuing a newscasting career, Singer worked on air in the Los Angeles area on such radio stations as KRLA, KRTH and KFI, using the name Randi Allison.\n\nDuring this time, she began writing screenplays. When Twentieth Century Fox optioned the children's novel \"Alias Madame Doubtfire\" by Anne Fine, Singer was selected to adapt it for the screen. She currently has a deal at Fox, where she is working on several projects, including a remake of \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.\"\n\nLeslie Dixon (Screenwriter) wrote \"Outrageous Fortune,\" which starred Bette Midler and Shelley Long. She also wrote \"Overboard,\" with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell.\n\nDixon recently served as executive producer on \"Look Who's Talking Now,\" which she co-wrote with her husband Tom Ropelewski, who directed the film.\n\nDonald McAlpine, A.S.C.

In 1966 he joined Film Australia as a cinematographer and was soon appointed chief cameraman of that organization, supervising the work of eight cinematographers.\n\nMcAlpine's first feature film credit, in 1972, was a cinematographer on \"The Adventures of Barry McKenzie,\" Bruce Beresford's premiere directorial effort. McAlpine and Beresford have since collaborated on eight other features, including \"Breaker Morant,\" \"The Getting of Wisdom,\" \"Puberty Blues\" and \"King David.\"\n\nMcAlpine photographed \"Tempest,\" \"Moscow on the Hudson,\" \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills\" and \"Moon Over Parador,\" all for writer-director Paul Mazursky. He has also teamed with Alan J. Pakula (\"Orphans\" and \"See You in the Morning\") and John McTiernan (\"Predator\" and \"Medicine Man\").\n\nAmong McAlpine's three dozen film credits are also \"My Brilliant Career,\" \"Stanley and Iris,\" \"Parenthood,\" \"The Hard Way\" and \"Patriot Games.\" He most recently completed \"The Man Without a Face,\" which marked Mel Gibson's directorial debut.\n\nAngelo Graham (Production Designer) earned an Academy Award for his art direction of \"The Godfather, Part II.\" In that capacity, he also has such films as \"Little Big Man,\" \"Junior Bonner,\" \"The Getaway,\" \"The Day of the Dolphin,\" \"Farewell, My Lovely,\" \"F.I.S.T\", \"Hammett,\" \"The Escape Artist,\" \"One From the Heart,\" \"*batteries not included\" and \"Final Analysis\" among his list of credits. \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"The Brinks Job\" both earned nominations for Academy Awards.
