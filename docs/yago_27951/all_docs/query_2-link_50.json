        "text": "I was five years old when I saw the iconic 1993 film “Mrs. Doubtfire” in theaters, a fact I will never forget because my mother was mortified. You see, my brother had wanted to see it so badly that he lied to Mom and told her it was PG, not PG-13.\n\nWatching the movie today, I can see why she was so upset, although the adult-tinged humor likely went directly over my head and the whole incident would’ve been forgotten had she not been so concerned. It apparently could’ve been even more inappropriate, as star Robin Williams’ improvisations were rumored to be so outrageous the movie could’ve been cut into an R-rated comedy. Regardless, my brother was grounded.\n\nThe musical version, performing through June 30 at the Hollywood Pantages Theatre, would most decidedly fall under the PG label. This is family-friendly entertainment – taking a familiar story and focusing on the emotional pathos of divorce in a thoughtful, though always humorous, manner.\n\nDaniel Hillard is an out-of-work voice actor in San Francisco. His wife Miranda is a fashion designer (changed from an interior designer in the film), and it’s clear that she carries the weight of the family’s financial responsibilities. Daniel, however, is insensitive to his wife’s stresses. After throwing an over-the-top birthday party for their son Christopher, Miranda asks for a divorce, leaving the family – which also includes teenager Lydia and young Natalie – torn apart. When Miranda is granted sole custody, Daniel resorts to his knack for impersonation to become the children’s new nanny, a matronly Scottish woman named Mrs. Doubtfire. Of course, hilarity ensues.\n\nTwo years ago, I reviewed the stage adaptation of “Tootsie,” which enjoyed more Tony love and a longer run on the Broadway stage than “Mrs. Doubtfire.” While certain elements might have been tighter in terms of pacing, I felt that “Tootsie” suffered from a dated depiction of drag that, at times, I found borderline offensive. “Mrs. Doubtfire,” as presented on its North American tour, mercifully does not suffer from the same problem. The show proves that you truly don’t have to punch down to make something funny.\n\nI feel this is an important note to make during Pride Month 2024. In the last few years, drag and trans people have been politicized as a scare tactic to drudge up votes in red states. Increasing numbers of anti-drag and anti-trans legislation has been introduced, putting communities that already struggle with constant harassment and violence further in harm’s way. Humor can help to open hearts and minds, but it can also create or deepen prejudicial viewpoints. There are aspects of the original film that have underlying transphobia, especially one line that suggests that transitioning is a bad thing. Certainly, elements of the movie would change today as society and understanding has evolved. It is also true that Robin Williams in drag, as well as his obviously gay brother played by openly gay Harvey Firestein, might have also helped some embrace queerness in a new and different way. Addressing this now, though, has to be done with a more enlightened sensitivity – something the musical’s book seems to have made a conscious effort to do.\n\nThe musical “Mrs. Doubtfire” walks this tightrope ably because the humor is character-based. Mrs. Doubtfire, the creation of our hero Daniel, is funny because Daniel – and his brilliant portrayer Rob McClure – is funny. And the necessary empathy is never lost in McClure’s eyes – beaming across the footlights through a (sometimes obvious) prosthetic mask. McClure also played Daniel on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination. It is easy to see why. Following Williams is no small task, but McClure impresses with his incredible array of voices, ridiculous facial expressions and impressive physicality.\n\nThe cast is uniformly excellent. Maggie Lakis takes over brilliantly as Miranda and manages to render a perfect interpretation of my favorite line (originally delivered by Sally Field) from the movie: “The whole time? The whole time?! THE WHOLE TIME?!”\n\nI want to call special attention to the ensemble, which is required to transform from locker room jocks to a nightmare chorus of Mrs. Doubtfire clones to youthful participants in a children’s show. The musical’s inventive use of its supporting cast allows the show to move along at a brisk pace, and these performers are all too often unsung.\n\nWas a musical version of the movie really necessary? Does transferring it to the stage add much to the story? To be honest, probably not. The songs are not especially memorable, although all are sung well and some of the staging, including one stomp-infused number, are superlative. Very few deviations are made from the movie, although a tango is employed (instead of the Heimlich maneuver) expertly in the show’s climax.\n\nBut these quibbles don’t take away from the fact that “Mrs. Doubtfire” on the stage is entertaining, brisk and a great outing for the whole family. Maybe you won’t be humming the score on your way out the door, but sometimes you just need a great, laugh-filled night at the theater. That is what “Mrs. Doubtfire” provides.\n\nAnd Mom would not have to ground my brother for having me tag along to this one.\n\nFor tickets and information, visit broadwayinhollywood.com/events/detail/mrsdoubtfire.
