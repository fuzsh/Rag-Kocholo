        "text": "Trigger Warning: This article contains mention of death.\n\nRobin Williams' legacy continues to shine brightly, thanks to a heartwarming story about his support for a young co-star. Recently, a letter Williams wrote on behalf of Lisa Jakub, who played his daughter in the beloved 1990s film Mrs. Doubtfire, resurfaced, reminding us of his immense generosity. While filming Mrs. Doubtfire, a story about a father who pretends to be a British nanny to spend more time with his children, young actress Lisa Jakub, who portrayed the eldest sister Lydia 'Lydie' Hillard, faced unexpected challenges. Jakub's high school expelled her because she was away from class to work on the film.\n\nRobin Williams, known for his empathy and generosity, stepped in to help. Upon hearing about the situation, Williams was upset about what he felt was unjust treatment.

Jakub, who was a Canadian high school student at the time, was expelled during the filming of Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nAccording to her, she was attending high school in Canada but had to leave for four months to shoot the movie. The plan was to send her schoolwork back and forth by mail, given that this was before the days of the Internet. Initially, the arrangement seemed to work, but a few months into filming, the school sent a message that changed everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I got thrown out of high school on Doubtfire. We were a couple of months into filming, and my school in Canada sent a note saying: ‘This isn’t working for us anymore, don’t come back.’ Yeah, 9th grade. I was devastated. It was just so heartbreaking, because I had this life that was very unusual, and that was the one normal thing,\" she explained.\n\nRobin Williams, noticing Jakub's distress over the situation, decided to take action. He wrote a letter to her school's principal, asking them to reconsider the decision and allow her to continue her education while pursuing her acting career.\n\nLisa shared, “The amazing thing was Robin saw that I was upset — he asked me what was going on. He wrote a letter to my principal saying that he wanted them to rethink this decision and that I was just trying to pursue my education and career at the same time, and could they please support me in this. The principal got the letter, framed the letter, put it up in the office, and didn’t ask me to come back. Amazing.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis incident was just one example of Robin Williams' kindheartedness. He often went out of his way to help his colleagues and young actors in the industry. For instance, Matthew Lawrence, who played Chris in Mrs. Doubtfire, shared that Williams wrote a letter of recommendation to help him get into the University of Southern California.\n\nCast of Mrs. Doubtfire reunites after 30 years\n\nLisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, and Mara Wilson, the child stars from the iconic comedy Mrs. Doubtfire, recently reunited more than 30 years after the film's original release.
