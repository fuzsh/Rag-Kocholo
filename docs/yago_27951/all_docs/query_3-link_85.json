        "text": "\"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is about a man who dresses as a dowager to invade the household of his estranged wife, who has thrown him out. The movie's biggest challenge, one that it does not exactly meet, is to persuade the audience that this husband and father's escapade is somehow an act of love.\n\nFortunately, Robin Williams lurks behind that latex face mask, ready to scatter wicked jokes and brilliant non sequiturs about whatever crosses his mind. Mr. Williams's genius is in these details, and it is given free rein during much of \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" as in the sequence that has him improvising with toy dinosaurs at a television studio and coming up with a Raptor Rap. (\"Yo, yo, see me/I'm livin' below the soil/I'll be back/But I'm comin' as oil.\") But if this film creates as good a showcase for the Williams zaniness as anything short of \"Aladdin,\" it also spends too much time making nice. And not enough time making sense.\n\nA lot of trouble has gone into giving a sitcom shininess to \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" which was directed by Chris Columbus (who also did both \"Home Alone\" films). Attention has been paid to everything from the sunny, well-heeled look of the family household to the pert costumes on Sally Field, who plays Mr. Williams's careerist wife. The story is so simple-minded that the wife's job alone is enough to villainize her: Miranda Hillard (Ms. Field) is seen doing something terribly important involving fabric swatches, while her sweet, helpless husband, Daniel (Mr. Williams), can barely stay employed dubbing voices onto animated films. When Miranda complains about his childishness, kicks him out of the house and keeps him from seeing enough of their three children, Daniel remains much too good-hearted to sue for support.\n\nConveniently, Daniel has a brother (Harvey Fierstein, tart and funny here) who specializes in makeup effects. And naturally Daniel is an actor, just as Dustin Hoffman's character was in the funnier, more substantial \"Tootsie,\" which unavoidably comes to mind. That film made the most of its hero's hostility, allowing it to become part of the joke. This one insists on a veneer of good intentions, which wears thin long before the story culminates in a speech about families and love.\n\nOnce the screenplay, by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon, has accomplished the gargantuan job of getting Daniel into a dress (so that he can play nanny to his own children), it stops adding up. There's a sequence about how Daniel, now done up as the broad-backed, hairy-legged matron of the title, can't cook dinner for the children, even though he has been feeding and caring for them for years. There are also two separate episodes, one elaborately staged in a restaurant, when Daniel must become a quick-change artist and jump into and out of his Doubtfire drag. No audience will believe he can do this in a few seconds' time.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
