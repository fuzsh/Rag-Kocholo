        "text": "RECOMMENDED\n\nThe prospect of turning a movie from thirty years ago that spotlighted Robin Williams in drag into a live musical seemed a tall task, and given the cultural progress made since on gender awareness, it also seemed a potentially insensitive one.\n\n“Mrs. Doubtfire” may be remembered as a comic vehicle for Williams, but “Madame Doubtfire” began as a book written by British author Anne Fine that was intended to help children cope with divorce. “Mrs. Doubtfire: The New Musical Comedy” goes back to the source material in deepening the lead character of Daniel, a divorced, out-of-work actor who disguises himself as a woman to get hired as his own children’s nanny.\n\nWhat is amazing about the virtuoso performance of Rob McClure, in the lead role that he created and is reprising from Broadway on the national tour, is how little of its brilliance is owed to Williams. Yes, McClure is a wicked mimic, so the fact that Daniel is a voiceover actor—a plot detail created for the film to spotlight a Williams strength—is handled with aplomb.\n\nBut the big change is that in the musical, Mrs. Doubtfire is not a character to be laughed at as in the movie, but someone to be laughed with. We never laugh at Daniel being in drag, although the circumstances the characters find themselves in remain rife with comedy.\n\nWe come to know Daniel as a sensitive and caring—albeit immature—father willing to do anything in his power to stay with them. The kids are not props—they have distinct personalities, and we get to know them and get to experience the relationship they have with their father.\n\nThe songs of the musical are effectively used to convey what the family feels during their journey, very much in the classic musical comedy mode (there is even a Rodgers and Hammerstein line salute). They are seamlessly integrated into the action and move it forward.\n\nThere is a strong dance element, too, often within a satirical context that keeps the energy high.\n\nBut the best thing about “Mrs. Doubtfire: A New Musical Comedy” is that it restores the heartfelt message of the book—that divorce doesn’t have to be an end for a family, but can simply be a new chapter.\n\nRather than the ambiguous ending of the film where Daniel returns with the implication that there could well be a marital reconciliation, the musical makes it quite clear that will not happen, yet remains upbeat. It was a particularly moving decision for McClure’s curtain call to be as Daniel, not Mrs. Doubtfire."
