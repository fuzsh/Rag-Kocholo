        "text": "If you are looking for a rollicking good time go see the hit musical “Mrs. Doubtfire” now running at the Hollywood Pantages Theater through June 30th. The Tour will also travel to Costa Mesa at Segerstrom Center for the Arts from September 24 to October 6, 2024. Based on the 1993 film starring the inimitable Robin Williams, Tony Award winning Director Jerry Zaks has taken the reins and staged this story to within an inch of its life. He keeps the stage moving at breakneck speed, infuses it with ridiculous humor and outrages musical numbers while never losing the plot or the pathos just under the surface. The audience is there for a good time and they get it.\n\nThe plot is simple, when ne’er do well Dad, Daniel Hillard loses access to his children through a contentious divorce he goes to great extremes to become their nanny, the outrages Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nRob McClure as Daniel/Mrs. Doubtfire is the undisputed star of this show. It is hard to look elsewhere when he is onstage which is near constant. He sings, dances, impersonates and quips his way through one preposterous scenario after another all in pursuit of seeing his kids. Luckily, he is well matched all around by the expert cast.\n\nWhen Daniel needs aid in his transformation from “shlubby guy” to a matronly 60ish Scottish nanny, he turns too his stylist brother Frank, Aaron Kaburick, who in a funny bit, speaks too loudly when he is nervous and his “fabulous” husband Andre, the “fabulous” Nik Alexander. This brings about one of a multitude of musical numbers, “Make Me a Woman” a madcap take on women and style.\n\nThe show abounds with terrific music and often hilarious lyrics by brothers Wayne and Karey Kirkpatrick and a clever book by Karey Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell. The catchy tunes further the story throughout while being entertaining in their own right. Yet missing, is a truly memorable show stopper, something melodious that you wish you could hear again and again.\n\nNevertheless, the show is propelled along by the non-stop score skillfully played by the adept pit band of Los Angeles musicians.\n\nThe choreography by Lorin Latarro is exactly right. Created with tongue and cheek finesse she expertly puts her dancers through the gamut of the early 80s/90s culture from nascent hip hop to jazz, tap and stylized commercial dance that is both humorously apt and very well executed by the ensemble. She is proficient in her staging, inventive with props and has a knack for finding every ounce of humor in her take on the cliches of the era. In “The Shape of Things to Come,” Latarro uses the ubiquitous “shoe shows” of the 80s as a vehicle to launch Daniel’s ex-wife’s new clothing line. This like much of the choreography is an ingenious way of mining the past, especially when Mrs. Doubtfire in skimpy attire is forced to join the “Show.” Even his oblivious ex-wife Miranda, a capable Maggie Lakis, is impressed. Couple the choreography with the sure-fire lyrics and music and you get yet another showstopper.\n\nAs the show progresses Mrs. Doubtfire/Daniel gets into one pickle after another setting the scene for the potential disaster of being discovered and for yet more musical zaniness. Including Leo Roberts as Stuart Dunmire, Miranda’s new boyfriend who inexplicably lands in one number as Austin Powers. Then there is David Hibbard a strangely peculiar and oddly daffy “Mr. Jolly,” the host of an equally peculiar and dated children’s show. This in turn sets Daniel up for what will become his and Mrs. Doubtfire’s future as the new host. Again, actor Rob McClure takes full advantage of every prop available and turns it into something more including a very funny bit with some old recording equipment. Jodi Kimura must also be mentioned as a stand out in several small turns especially as the Flamenco Singer in “He Lied to Me” an uproarious farcical dance where the truth unfolds.\n\nThe supporting cast are all top-notch including the three children, Sam Bird and Emerson Mae Chan (in this performance) do a good job, along with the excellent Giselle Gutierrez who brings true emotion and lovely vocals to her part as Lydia the oldest child. Romelda Teron Benjamin holds her own as Wanda the social worker. Dancing, singing, moving props and changing character as they change costumes the terrific ensemble is the glue that holds the show together.\n\nThe sets by David Korins and costumes by Catherine Zuber are top-notch as is the lighting design by Philip Rosenberg and sound by Brian Ronan and Craig Cassidy\n\nDirector Jerry Zaks, his team and the uber talented Rob McClure have brought this warm-hearted and funny show to sparkling life. Go see it if you can, you will be happy you did!\n\nFor more information and to purchase tickets, please visit The Hollywood Pantages Theatre website\n\nThe Tour will also travel to Costa Mesa at Segerstrom Center for the Arts from September 24 to October 6, 2024.\n\nWritten by Tam Warner for LA Dance Chronicle.\n\nFeatured image: Mrs. Doubtfire – L to R Giselle Guiterrez as Lydia Hillard, Cody Braverman as Christopher Hillard, Emerson Mae Chan as Natalie Hillard, Maggie Lakis as Miranda Hillard, and Rob McClure as Euphegenia Doubtfire – Photo by Joan Marcus."
