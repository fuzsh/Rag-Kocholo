        "text": "Mrs. Doubtfire is a 1993 American comedy-drama film, directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon, based on the novel Alias Madame Doubtfire by Anne Fine. It stars Robin Williams (who also served as a co-producer), Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein, and Robert Prosky. It follows a recently divorced actor who dresses up as a female housekeeper to be able to interact with his children. The film addresses themes of divorce, separation, and the effect they have on a family.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on November 24, 1993. It won the Academy Award for Best Makeup and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. Robin Williams was awarded the Golden Globe for Best Actor.\n\nIt grossed $441.3 million on a $25 million budget, becoming the second highest grossing film of 1993 worldwide. Though the film received mixed reviews during its original theatrical run, more recent reviews have been much more positive: the film placed 67th in the American Film Institute's \"AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs\" list and 40th on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies of All Time.\" The original music score was composed by Howard Shore.\n\nPlot[]\n\nDaniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a freelance voice actor in San Francisco. Even though he is a devoted father to his three children, Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence), and Natalie (Mara Wilson), his wife Miranda (Sally Field) considers him unreliable. One day, Daniel quits his job after a disagreement over a script and returns home to throw an expensive birthday party for Chris despite Miranda's objections. Miranda gets angry and files for divorce. The judge (Scott Beach) grants sole custody of the children to her, but tells Daniel if he can find a steady job and a suitable residence within three months, he and Miranda can share custody.\n\nDaniel works to rebuild his life, getting a menial job at a local television station, and learns that Miranda is seeking a housekeeper to watch over the children. He secretly alters her classified ad form to keep other interested people away, and then uses his voice acting skills to call Miranda about the job, making them all undesirable applicants. He finally calls Miranda as a Scottish-accented nanny, whom he calls Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire (Williams), with strong credentials. Miranda is impressed and invites her for an interview. Daniel asks his brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), a makeup artist, and Frank's partner, Jack (Scott Capurro) to create a Mrs. Doubtfire costume, including a prosthetic mask to make him appear as an older woman.\n\nMiranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire after a successful interview. Upon returning to Daniel's apartment, Mrs Doubtfire is met by Mrs. Sellner (Anne Haney), Daniel's court liaison, who is hoping to see Daniel and carry out her inspection of the apartment. This results in Daniel changing in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire costume to meet Mrs. Sellner's needs, which ultimately leads to Daniel's mask flying out the window, and getting squashed by a garbage truck. He cleverly conceals his face by donning an improvised \"facial mask\" made of frosting from a cake found in his refrigerator. Frank and Jack quickly make him a new and slightly older mask.\n\nThe children initially struggle under Mrs. Doubtfire's authority, but soon come around and thrive, and further, Miranda learns to become closer with her children. Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, learns several household skills as part of the role, further improving himself. However, this has created another barrier for Daniel to see his children, as Miranda has put more trust into Mrs. Doubtfire than him, and she cannot bring herself to dismiss her. One night, Lydia and Chris discover Daniel's plan and, thrilled to have their father back, agree to keep his secret.\n\nWhile working at the station, Daniel is seen by the station's CEO Jonathan Lundy (dddd) playing with toy dinosaurs on the set of a cancelled children's show. Impressed by his voice acting and imagination, Lundy invites Daniel for a dinner to discuss giving him his own children's show to host. Daniel discovers this is to be on the same night and time as a planned birthday dinner for Miranda by her former-acquaintance-turned-new-boyfriend Stuart Dunmeyer (Pierce Brosnan) at the same restaurant, to which Mrs. Doubtfire is expected to attend. Unable to change either appointment, Daniel decides to change in and out of the Mrs. Doubtfire costume to attend both events. Daniel eventually gets drunk on whisky and starts slipping up after changing in and out of costume, leading him to return to Lundy while in his costume by accident and quickly claim that \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is his idea for the show. Daniel overhears that Stu is allergic to pepper and takes it upon himself to spike Stu's order of jambalaya, which he had requested be prepared mild. Stu starts choking on his dinner, and Daniel feeling guilty, gives him the Heimlich maneuver as Mrs. Doubtfire. The action causes the prosthetic mask to partially peel off Daniel's face, revealing his identity and horrifying Miranda.\n\nAt their next custody hearing, Daniel points out that he has met the judge's requirements, and he explains his actions. The judge is touched by Daniel's words, but also disturbed by his ploy. He grants Miranda full custody, with Daniel being granted supervised Saturday visitation rights. Without Mrs. Doubtfire, Miranda and her children become miserable, acknowledging how much Mrs. Doubtfire improved their lives. They are surprised when the local station starts a new children's show Euphegenia's House which Daniel, as Mrs. Doubtfire, hosts. The show becomes a hit and starts airing across the country.\n\nOne day, Miranda visits Daniel on set, admitting that things were better when he was involved, and agrees to change the custody arrangement. Soon after, she and Daniel begin sharing joint custody, allowing Daniel to take the children after school, an arrangement he had requested at the beginning of his and Miranda's separation. As Daniel takes the kids out, Miranda watches an episode of Euphegenia's House where Mrs. Doubtfire answers a letter from a young girl whose parents have separated, saying that love makes a family a family, no matter the distance between its members.\n\nCast[]\n\nRobin Williams as Daniel Hillard/Euphegenia Doubtfire\n\nSally Field as Miranda Hillard\n\nPierce Brosnan as Stuart \"Stu\" Dunmeyer\n\nHarvey Fierstein as Frank Hillard\n\nPolly Holliday as Gloria Cheney\n\nLisa Jakub as Lydia Hillard\n\nMatthew Lawrence as Chris Hillard\n\nMara Wilson as Natalie Hillard\n\nRobert Prosky as Mr. Jonathan Lundy\n\nAnne Haney as Mrs. Sellner\n\nScott Capurro as Jack\n\nSydney Walker as Bus Driver\n\nMartin Mull as Justin Gregory\n\nScott Beach as Judge\n\nTerence McGovern as ADR Director Lou\n\nWilliam Newman as Mr. Sprinkles\n\nProduction[]\n\nChicago was the studio's first choice for filming. However, as two new television series (ER and Chicago Hope) had a lease with the city during the subsequent time period, production was relocated to San Francisco. Various locations in the city were used during filming. Parts were filmed at the studios of television station KTVU in Oakland. Street signs for the intersection near the \"Painted Lady\" home, Steiner, and Broadway, were visible onscreen.\n\nThe exact address 2640 Steiner Street 37°47′38.07″N 122°26′10.78″W became a tourist attraction for some time after the film's release. Following Williams's death by suicide on August 11, 2014, the house became an impromptu memorial. All interior filming for the home took place in a Bay Area warehouse converted for sound stage usage. Williams's character, Daniel Hillard, lived upstairs from Danilo Bakery at 516 Green Street; his children attended a school at Filbert and Taylor.\n\nThe makeup for Mrs. Doubtfire's appearance took four hours to apply. Williams later recounted how he used to walk through San Francisco dressed in full makeup and costume as Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire, and on one occasion, visiting a sex shop to buy a large dildo and other toys. The restaurant scene was filmed at Bridges Restaurant & Bar, in Danville, California.[8]\n\nThe score was composed, orchestrated, and conducted by Howard Shore.[citation needed]\n\nRelease[]\n\nThe film was released in the United States on November 24, 1993, and was rated PG.\n\nIn January 1994, when released in the United Kingdom, the film received a certificate of 12 which, at the time, completely refused access to children under the age of 12 at cinemas. This resulted in cinemas requesting their local authorities to override the decision of the British Board of Film Classification, after having to turn down disappointed families. In February 1994, The Independent reported that the censors refused to give the film a U or PG certificate, and gave it a 12 instead, which was due to 20th Century Fox refusing to remove three controversial lines.\n\nAfter the film's distributors requested the BBFC to reconsider a compromise was reached in which the film was re-rated PG, with the thirteen seconds of sexual innuendos cut, and it was re-released in May 1994. The cut version was also used in subsequent VHS and DVD releases in the United Kingdom. In November 2012 the distributors resubmitted the uncut version to the BBFC and the 12 certificate was reinstated for home video along with a 12A certificate for cinema release in 2014. On March 4, 2013, the uncut version was released on Blu-ray and downloads in the United Kingdom.\n\nDeleted scenes[]\n\nOver 30 minutes of deleted scenes were omitted from the final cut of the film, some of which were featured in the 2008 DVD release of Mrs. Doubtfire called the \"Behind-the-Seams Edition.\" These include an entire subplot featuring Daniel's conflict with his nosy neighbor Gloria (Polly Holliday) and an extended scene at Bridges restaurant. In 2016 three further scenes, included in the aforementioned 2013 Blu-ray release, were released online to much fanfare and praise for Robin Williams. These included a scene where Daniel and Miranda fight at Lydia's spelling bee competition and a confrontation scene with Miranda after Daniel's identity is revealed at the restaurant.\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office[]\n\nThe film earned $219,195,243 in North America, along with $222,090,952 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $441,286,195, making it the highest grossing cross-dressing film.[17] It became the second-highest-grossing film of 1993, behind only Jurassic Park. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 52.6 million tickets in the US.\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nAt the time of its release, several critics compared Mrs. Doubtfire unfavorably with Some Like It Hot (1959) and others who viewed the film favorably noted its similarity to Tootsie (1982).\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Mrs. Doubtfire has a rating of 71%, based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's critical reception reads:\n\n“ On paper, Mrs. Doubtfire might seem excessively broad or sentimental, but Robin Williams shines so brightly in the title role that the end result is difficult to resist.[22][23] ”\n\nOn Metacritic, the film holds a score of 53 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating 'mixed or average reviews'.\n\nAccolades[]\n\n66th Academy Awards\n\nBest Makeup (Won)\n\n51st Golden Globe Awards\n\nBest Picture (Musical/Comedy) (Won)\n\nBest Actor (Musical/Comedy) - Robin Williams (Won)\n\nIn 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list, where it was ranked #67.[25]\n\nCancelled sequel[]\n\nIn 2001, Mrs. Doubtfire 2 began being developed by Bonnie Hunt, even though Anne Fine had not written any follow-up novels to Alias Madame Doubtfire, but writing did not begin until 2003. Robin Williams was set to return in disguise as an old nanny. Due to problems with the script, re-writing began in 2006, as Williams was unhappy with the plot, and the sequel was again scrapped later that year. The film was expected to be released in late 2007, but following further script problems, the sequel was declared scrapped in December 2006.\n\nIn 2006, in an Newsday interview, Williams said the sequel was indefinitely scrapped. Stating his reasons:\n\n“ The script they had just didn't work. The sequel's story involved Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire moving close to Lydia's college, so he could keep an eye on her.[27] ”\n\nIn December 2006, during an interview on BBC Radio 1 by DJ Edith Bowman, Williams said that if it was not going to be done right, then it was not worth doing, and that there would not be a sequel with him in it.\n\nIn August 2010, on Alan Carr: Chatty Man, Williams again brought up the topic of a sequel to Mrs. Doubtfire. He blamed the script not being right as the reason why a sequel was not made. He claimed the script had been written three times and failed, and there was no mention of any ongoing work on the project. Furthermore, in December 2011, during an interview by Moviehole, Williams stated again that the chances of a sequel are \"highly unlikely.\"\n\nIn 2011, Williams said:\n\n“ They could never write it. They kept trying and it doesn’t work... because at the end of the first one they reveal who [Mrs. Doubtfire] is. So it ends up being her for five minutes and then she transitions into some old Russian woman. They so far can’t crack it.[28] ”\n\nIn 2014,[29] Chris Columbus stated, in turn:\n\n“ We're talking about a sequel to Mrs. Doubtfire. We've [he and Williams] talked about it, and the studio is interested in it. The thing that fascinates me about a sequel to Mrs. Doubtfire is with most actors who create an iconic character like Mrs. Doubtfire, when you come back and do that character, well, you're twenty years older so, you're not going to look the same.\n\nThe cool thing with Mrs. Doubtfire is there's a character, there's a woman, who is actually going to look exactly as she did in 1993.\n\n”\n\nIn April 2014, it was announced that a sequel was in development at 20th Century Fox. Williams and Columbus were expected to return, and Elfscreenwriter David Berenbaum was hired to write the script.[30] However, after Williams' death in August 2014, plans for a sequel were permanently cancelled.[31]\n\nStage adaptation[]"
