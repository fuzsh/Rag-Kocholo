        "text": "The Mrs Doubtfire sequel, that was being worked on by Robin Williams and director Chris Columbus, is sadly now in doubt.\n\nEarlier this year news emerged that both Williams, who played the role of Daniel Hillard and Scottish nanny Mrs Euphegenia Doubtfire, and director Chris Columbus were keen to work on a sequel.\n\nThere was also talk writer David Berenbaum was set to write the script, according to The Wrap.\n\nBut now it seems the second installment of the 1993 classic, which bosses have apparently been trying to commission since 2001, won’t be going ahead after Williams’ tragic passing.\n\nAside from Mrs Doubfire 2, Williams was working on four other movies yet to be released.\n\nThese are Night of the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, which is due for release on December 19. He will also appear in Merry Friggin’ Christmas, which is due for release a month earlier, as well as voicing Dennis the Dog in live-action comedy Absolutely Anything and Boulevard.\n\nHe was tragically found dead in his California home around midday on Monday from suspected suicide.\n\nClick on the image below for Robin Williams’ best quotes."
