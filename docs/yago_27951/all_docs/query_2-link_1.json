        "text": "Euphegenia Doubtfire was the main character in the film. She was portrayed by the late Robin Williams who also played Daniel Hillard.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire was ultimately Daniel Hilliard, but she represented many things to groups of people. To the bus driver she was a beautiful woman. To the Hillard family she was a nanny.\n\nBrother[]\n\nTo his brother – and his partner – he was always Daniel Hilliard, but dressing as Mrs. Doubtfire. Hence, Mrs. Doubtfire was never truly a character to him.\n\nMiranda Hillard[]\n\nWhen he first came back home as Mrs. Doubtfire, she did not know that it was Daniel underneath realistic prosthetics. To her, Mrs. Doubtfire was real. In fact Mrs. Doubtfire was like family to her. She even asks Mrs. Doubtfire which dress she should wear. When Daniel's mask came off after giving Stu the Heimlich, Mrs. Doubtfire did not fully exist. However, it was hard to put it out of her mind that Mrs. Doubtfire was not real, as is demonstrated when she talks with her children in the kitchen. When she sees Daniel dressed as Mrs. Doubtfire on the television, Mrs. Doubtfire exists as a television character.\n\nChristopher and Lydia Hillard[]\n\nLike their mother, Mrs. Doubtfire was a real person to them. When Chris saw his father standing up to urinate, Mrs. Doubtfire became a transsexual stranger to him and Lydia, but not for long, and within minutes, Mrs. Doubtfire was not a person, but their father was simply dressing up as Mrs. Doubtfire. It is unsure if after the restaurant, in the kitchen, they are confused again or simply want to imagine Mrs. Doubtfire was real or are posturing for their mother. By the end of the film, their father makes Mrs. Doubtfire exist for them by portraying her on television for millions.\n\nNatalie Hillard[]\n\nLike everyone else in the family, she considers Mrs. Doubtfire to be real in the beginning. Only after the fiasco in the restaurant does she know Mrs. Doubtfire is not real. It is unknown if in the conversation in the kitchen if she still knows this or if she is referring to \"she\" as her dad dressed and acting as the woman. By the end, it is likely, as is with the others, that she knows Mrs. Doubtfire exists as a character on television.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBefore Robin Williams was cast as Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire, other actors were also considered for the part.\n\nTim Allen was the original choice for the title role. But he turned it down.\n\nOther actors considered for the role include Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Warren Beatty, Mel Gibson, Bryan Cranston, Rick Moranis, Rowan Atkinson, Harrison Ford, Jerry Seinfeld and Chevy Chase."
