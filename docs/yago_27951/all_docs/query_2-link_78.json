        "text": "Here’s a fun fact about me: I’ve never seen the movie “Mrs. Doubtfire” before, but after seeing the musical, that fact will change very soon.\n\nAbout the show\n\nBased on the 1993 movie of the same name, “Mrs. Doubtfire” brings a classic film to the stage. The show debuted on Broadway in December 2019, and its Charlotte premiere was on Tuesday night at Belk Theater.\n\nThe musical follows the main character, Daniel, as he attempts to remain connected to his children after a divorce from his former wife, Miranda. Daniel disguises himself as the children’s new nanny, the titular Mrs. Doubtfire. What follows is an equal amount of hijinks and heart.\n\nChoosing a favorite\n\nIn previous reviews, I’ve found my favorite number in the first act of the musical. This one’s no different. My favorite song from “Mrs. Doubtfire” was “Make me a Woman,” performed by the main character, his brother Frank and his brother-in-law Andre.\n\nThe song begins when Daniel approaches Frank and Andre — both make-up artists — and asks them to help him disguise himself as a nanny and spend more time with his kids, thus “making him a woman.”\n\nAn upbeat number ensues, and through the song, Andre and Frank suggest various historical female figures, including Donna Summers, Madonna, and Marget Thatcher, as inspiration for Daniel’s transformation.\n\nEach historical figure is represented by a dancer on stage, adding unique costuming and a dash of humor to the upbeat music and lyrics. If you’ve ever wanted to see Eleanor Roosevelt doing a dance number with Cher (for whatever reason), this is the show for you.\n\nWhat surprised me\n\nAs someone who went into the show knowing very little about “Mrs.Doubtfire” –outside its starring the late Robin Williams and being the origin of the “Help is on the way, dear!” line –, I didn’t expect the show to have as many emotional beats as it did.\n\nThe strain between Daniel and Miranda feels palpable throughout the show, even when they aren’t on stage together. At the same time, the actors who play them have great chemistry (likely, in part, because they’re married in real life).\n\nThe moments when the audience gets to see how Daniel and Miranda talk about each other when they’re apart feel very authentic and add a layer of drama to balance out the show’s constant humor.\n\nThe humor in this show is rapid, tongue-in-cheek, and mature but somehow remains mildly family-friendly. The jokes never feel like they’re talking down to their younger audience, nor do they feel too inappropriate, with most landing among the audience quite well.\n\nThe joke I most enjoyed was a running gag with Frank, who has a unique tell when he lies. The gag has a subtle payoff in the show and doesn’t overexplain itself to the audience. It’s one of the many examples of humor being one of the show’s stronger aspects.\n\nLastly, as I’ve said in previous reviews for shows like “Beetlejuice” and “SIX,” I love good costume design; however, “Mrs. Doubtfire” introduced me to something new to appreciate in theater shows: prosthetics.\n\nI’d expected Daniel’s transformation into Mrs. Doubtfire to simply involve a dress and a wig; instead, Daniel donned a face mask that briefly convinced me that I was watching a completely new actor. Each time the character changed into or out of his Mrs. Doubtfire disguise on stage, I was impressed at the transformation and felt like I got to see a little of the theater magic that goes on behind the scenes.\n\nWhat I wish was different\n\nWhile the movie “Mrs. Doubtfire” takes place in 1993, the stage version takes place during the present day. As such, some of the dialogue and jokes are made more modern with references to TikTok and social media.\n\nSome jokes land, but others feel they’ll date the show quickly as online trends evolve.\n\nIn a show where so much of the humor comes from the characters and situations, the jokes about teens scrolling on TikTok for too long fall flat in comparison.\n\nI also wish the show had more clearly shown the passage of time. Sometimes, certain character moments seem to come out of nowhere until it’s revealed that months have passed between certain scenes. I think the narrative and pacing would’ve benefited from using seasonal-themed props like Halloween or Christmas decorations to give the audience a better idea of how much time had passed in the plot.\n\nFinal verdict\n\n“Mrs. Doubtfire” is a love story at its core — but not in the way you may expect. Rather than romantic love, “Mrs. Doubtfire” offers a message about love between parents and children, ex-husbands and ex-wives, or among siblings.\n\nAdditionally, it shows how families come in all different shapes and sizes—a very touching message that many in the audience may be able to relate to. While I tend to enjoy musicals from start to finish, “Mrs. Doubtfire” is the first show where I’ve left thinking about how satisfying the ending was — not just for the audience but also for the characters.\n\nIf you go:\n\nLocation: Belk Theater\n\nDates: May 2 – May 5\n\nPrices: $30"
