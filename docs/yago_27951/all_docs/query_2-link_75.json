        "text": "In the scene where Robin Williams' character becomes Mrs. Doubtfire, he first goes through three different styles.\n\nThey all seem to be impersonations, but I can't figure out which one is the first one. The middle one is from \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and the last is obviously Barbara Streisand.\n\nWhat is the first, or is it even a reference?\n\nHere's a picture of the character in question:\n\nAlso, the script from the scene:\n\nI hope you are using Jungle Red.\n\nThat is the color I love.\n\n(Matches your lips)\n\nGod bless you.\n\nI'm feeling fabulous because I met this beautiful Cuban.\n\nEvery night is like the Bay of Pigs.\n\nI can't lie to you. It's beautiful with him.\n\nI don't know. This would scare the children. Maybe this is too much for them.\n\nA possibility is Chita Rivera. Like Streisand, she's a legend in musical theatre, and the Fiddler reference makes that a possible link between the three impersonations.\n\nChita Rivera herself does not have an accent, but her breakout role was as a Puerto Rican immigrant in West Side Story. Here's what she looked like when she won the Tony in 1993 for Kiss Of The Spider Woman:\n\nIt could have been Rita Morena, who was in the movie version of West Side Story, but she also had a fake accent for that part and I can't find an image of her ever wearing her hair like that.\n\nanswered May 29, 2018 at 22:12\n\nTodd WilcoxTodd Wilcox\n\n12.1k22 gold badges4444 silver badges5353 bronze badges"
