        "text": "Mrs Doubtfire is renowned as one of the funniest comedy dramas of all time with Robin William's witty humour and wholesome personality shining through.\n\nBut over the years many have questioned where the acting legend got the inspiration for the fun-loving nanny's distinct accent - and whether it's Glasgow or Edinburgh.\n\nAn unearthed interview has finally settled the years-old squabble, with the late great Williams revealing Mrs Doubtfire's precise origins.\n\nThroughout the film, Mrs Doubtfire or Euphegenia, clearly speaks with a cod Caledonian twang, yet in one scene she claims she's from England.\n\nHowever, most Scots would assume her dialect was an approximation of a well-to-do lady from the east coast.\n\nIt is, after all, fairly well-known that Anne Fine, the author of the 1987 novel that inspired Mrs Doubtfire, named her character after a real-life Edinburgh shopkeeper, reports Edinburgh Live.\n\nWho was Mrs Doubfire based on?\n\nMadame Doubtfire was a moniker familiar to many in Edinburgh's New Town in the 1970s, as it was the name above the door to the premises of Annabella Coutts, whose second-hand goods emporium was extremely popular.\n\nCoutts was historically known to have had a fiery-temper and foul mouth - nothing like the Mrs Doubtfire character - named her South East Circus Place bric-a-brac store after her first husband, Arthur Cyril Doubtfire, who was killed in action during the First World War.\n\nEdinburgh or Glasgow?\n\nThe late great Robin Williams decision to give Mrs Doubtfire a Scottish accent was very much one of chance.\n\nIn an unearthed TV interview, Williams - who was famed for his incredible ability to mimic voices - revealed that his Mrs Doubtfire was a 'posh' Glaswegian.\n\nDuring an appearance on ITV's Des O'Connor Show in 1994, Robin Williams confirmed that he was inspired by the accent of legendary Glasgow-born film director Bill Forsyth, with whom he had recently worked with on the movie Being Human.\n\n\"Where is [the accent] exactly?\" asks Des on the show.\n\nSlipping back into Doubtfire dialect, the actor, who tragically died in 2014, replies: \"It's like a Glaswegian accent, because I'd just finished working with Bill Forsyth for four months.\"\n\nAs well as basing elements of Mrs Doubtfire's voice on the Local Hero and Gregory's Girl director, Williams said her softer side was heavily influenced by a member of the Being Human production team, a costume designer called \"Merritt\".\n\nIn the hilarious clip, Williams adds: \"I slowly but surely, took a little bit of Bill Forsyth, and a little bit of this costume designer - this wonderful, sweet lady named Merritt - and combined them, and got this gentle, gentle voice of Mrs Doubtfire, who could still say: [yelling] 'Get away!'.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.
