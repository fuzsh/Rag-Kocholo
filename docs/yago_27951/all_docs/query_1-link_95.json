        "text": "Stephen Sondheim talks with a journalist of the Los Angeles Times of the new coming movie Into the Woods\n\nThe Los Angeles Times, piece of Carolyn Cole published two days ago an interview with two creators of Into the Woods, Rob Marshall and with Meryl Streep.\n\nLet’s start to see what Stephen Sondheim said to Carolyn Cole.\n\nI have always loved musicals.\n\nThis movie will be a big success because to me, there is a legendary cast in the movie and the movie is based on a legendary and very loved Broadway’s musical. Plus Stephen Sondheim is a Legend of and for Broadway. He wrote apart Into the Woods, West Side Story, Sweeney Todd and many many many other musicals that simply are the History of the American Musical\n\nInto the Woods, knew the light in 1987 when firstly appeared in Broadway and it was immediately a big success of spectators and critics. Sondheim had close to him librettist James Lapine, now the screenwriter of the movie version of Into the Woods.\n\nThe journalist asked to Sondheim if for case he would have imagined a movie version.\n\nThe answer of Sondheim: “No. You never think of those things when you’re writing a show. I mean, maybe some people do. There’s no way of knowing whether it would attract an audience particularly in an era when musical movies are not as frequent as they used to be, like the ’30s and ’40s. So no, never. Never occurred to us. What did occur was that, if the show worked, it would have a great future life in schools, colleges and regional theaters“.\n\nIn the past there has ben more than a temptation about putting on the big screen this story. Another Marshall tried to do that: Penny Marshall. And the cast of course would have been extremly brilliant in her case as well.\n\nSondheim talks about it. L\n\n“There was a read at Penny Marshall’s house. That cast? Pretty remarkable. Robin Williams as the Baker, Cher as the Witch, Steve Martin as Wolf and Danny DeVito as the Giant. That, I remember. Roseanne Barr as Jack’s Mother. Baker’s Wife, Goldie Hawn. The script was an adaptation by the guys who wrote “Parenthood,” Babaloo Mandel and his partner, Lowell Ganz“.\n\nSondheim about fairy-tales characters.\n\n“Fairy-tale characters are heightened, aren’t they? They’re archetypes“.\n\nMeryl Streep for Sondheim.\n\n“What’s remarkable about Meryl is how many different ways she can sing a given lyric. Each take was like looking at the facets of a stone from a slightly different angle each time. Remember, what’s difficult about acting in a song is that you are strait-jacketed by certain rhythms and certain inflections. They come from the rise and fall of the melodic line, from the periodicity of the tune. So you’re not as free as an actor as you would be if you just give the speech“.\n\nInto the Woods as a creation\n\n“Which is what fairy tales are about: moral decisions.\n\nWhen we were trying the show out in California originally, James Lapine and I sat down and discussed: What is the show about? Well, it’s actually about two things. One, it’s about the relationship between parents and children. And the other is about community responsibility. In the second act, they have to get together to kill the threat. We decided finally it’s about both, which is dangerous when you do a show, you know“.\n\nSondheim on the storytelling\n\n“I think that’s the strongest thing in any given stage piece. So I’d rather have an actor who can sing. On the other hand, you know, you get something that requires some vocal chops like “Sweeney Todd,” and yeah, when I hear it sung I think: I see what I was missing. But most of the time, I would rather have actors who could sing“.\n\nSondheim, songs and the change of habits of people during the decades\n\n“People no longer listen to songs in a dramatic context”.\n\nA new song, a novelty, not existing previously in the Broadway’s version of Into the Woods has been composed by Stephen Sondheim\n\nHis tale: “There was a small fragment of a song in this part of the second act of the show. And Rob and a few others said: You know, how about expanding and making a new song? I said: My worry is that it’ll hold up the story. So I wrote a song, which I like very much, which she sang very well. And they put it in the film. And guess what? It held up the story. Another lesson I learned from Oscar Hammerstein is, if it holds up the story, out“.\n\nThe song will be in the CD as well and Sondheim is thrilled.\n\n“If they hadn’t allowed this to be on the CD, I would be really upset. You know, the strength of this, like the strength of “Sweeney Todd” and “West Side Story,” is the story. I’m not being modest about the scores or anything like that. But the strength is the story“.\n\nThe creation of a movie from a Broadway’s musical.\n\n“It’s very hard to reimagine a stage piece as a film. They are such different mediums. And it’s really hard.It’s a story of rhythm. It’s about intimacy with the actors“.\n\nAnna Maria Polidori\n\nRobin Williams, Johnny Depp, and that movie never realized\n\nCaptain, my captain, but what happened? What happened?\n\nWhat a shock Robin Williams’ departure. In my bedroom there is a picture of Robin close to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and the citation: “Life is like a box of chocolate. You never know what you’ll get“.\n\nIt’s always true.\n\nIt was breakfast time when they launched the news of Robin’s departure and my heart started to live one of his moments, and I started to crying: “No, Robin no, please…”\n\nWhat a man, what an actor. A big part of my childhood and teen-ager age was absorbed by his tv serie and movies. Robin, you let cry not just the adult Anna Maria one, but the kid who watched you on TV in Mork&Mindy, and the teen-ager one as well.\n\nBecause no one else is more rich of poetry and tenderness as you were.\n\nI found peace immediately after thinking that after all maybe Robin has always searched for a suicidal escapism from life.\n\nMaybe\n\nIn his movies in fact he largely talked of suicide: in Dead Poets Society, but also in many other movies as well. I always remember I had to ask to my friends when we watched some of these movies involving suicides, when the scene was over, because I couldn’t watch it. They have been always structured for being very intense and moving moments. To me the most difficult part.\n\nHe didn’t have any fear in portraying in fact on the big screen the biggest, intimate desperation of a human being. The final act of a man or a woman because desperate, because apparently, only apparently, there wasn’t another solution, suicide apart. It was like a penetration in the personal desperation of the man/boy/woman would have killed himself or herself for trying to guess the feelings, the sentiments would have brought them to this final, dramatic decision. A great work of research not just of a character, but of the intimate feelings of that person. Of the intimate reason of a despearation like that one. A great, always profound, psychologic work.\n\nIn Mork&Mindy disappeared and I still remember the trauma and desperation because Mork was gone. I was just a kid and I refused, still refusing the idea of dying.\n\nRobin was a real genius, funny, incredibly, good. You knew he was a very good man when you watched one of his numerous and funny or intense movies. Good morning Vietnam with an intense and funny Adrian Cronauer, The adventures of Baron Munchausen, Dead Poets Society, Mrs.Doubtfire (God, what a masterpiece!), Nine Month (in the role of a very funny gynecologist!), What dreams come true, Jumanji seen and re-seen. I had asked to my aunt of presenting me that VHS for Christmas. What a wonderful fantasy.\n\nRobin worked in a moment in which the world was still rich of possibilities and there weren’t the complexities there are in this moment.\n\nHe has left a great imprint in our soul of teenagerm in a very positive way, because Robin Williams was always a very positive, wonderful man and soul, able to give, able to be expansive, able to be funny and unique, able to entertain and let us smile or being able to let us see also the most profound and intense aspects of life.\n\nMaybe he was someone with a lot of internal conflicts and demons. Most of comedians are incredibly sad once they are back to the normality and they leave the stage alone after their performance. I guess it’s normal because it’s another dimensiom.\n\nBut…\n\nRobin wasn’t just a comedian. Once he started to work he had built a very solid and great, rpestigious personal background. He studied a lot, attended many schools and he was able to attend the most prestigious institution of the Usa in term of acting and music and arts in general as well: the Julliard of New York City. It is the most important wonderful reality and the most prestigious school for someone who wants to start to work as an actor or a musician or a dancer one for the very high level of preparation students obtain.\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nhad to work with Robin in a project by Terry Gilliam .\n\nGilliam had previously worked with both of them and he wanted to be back in 2004-2005 with a project based on a book written by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman called Good Omens. It’s a funny book and Johnny Depp would have been a demon, Crowley, and Robin Williams an angel, Aziraphale.\n\nAs it happens sometimes with Terry Gilliam’s project, they didn’t find all the money and the project, unfortunately has never been realized. Pity because it would have been a great movie.\n\nAnother news on february 3 2014 was launched saying that Gilliam is not yet giving up to the idea of an adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s book. Script is still there added Gilliam saying also: “I think it’s in the hands of receivers, because the people we did it for went bankrupt. I did talk to Terry Pratchett’s people and to Neil about getting it going again.”\n\nIf you have read some Pratchett’s books, you will know how absolutely good but aarticulated they can be.\n\nGilliam explained that firstly with the script they had to condense the story in a 150 minutes screenplay. Gilliam would hope in a biggest project for the TV, where they won’t condense the book but they would treat every part of it.\n\nAnna Maria Polidori\n\nJohnny in the role of the lascivious Wolf\n\nJohnny Depp\n\nwill come soon with major productions.
