        "text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. – I fully expected a musical adaptation of Mrs. Doubtfire to be funny. After all, the absolute hilarity of the late Robin Williams’ masterful performance in the original 1993 film version ranks as one of his all-time great works of art. Which is why I was utterly unprepared for what we experienced last night here in Rhode Island’s capital city. But first, some context for this review.\n\nMy family have been devoted patrons and season ticket holders at PPAC, the Providence Performing Arts Center, for some three decades now, since around the same time that Mrs. Doubtfire premiered on movie screens. Through the years, we’ve been treated to some truly phenomenal productions of touring musical theater (Phantom of the Opera, Hamilton, Once, and The Band’s Visit are a few that immediately come to mind), as well as the rare disasters (the most recent Oklahoma still gives me nightmares, even when I’m wide awake). We’ve also seen our share of great shows on Broadway, so, we have an extensive collection of work from which to draw for comparison’s sake.\n\nEntering last night’s performance, the funniest on-stage production I’d ever enjoyed was Something Rotten! which starred Adam Pascal (a leading member of the original Rent cast) and (I’d forgotten this until I dug up my old Center Stage playbill) a guy named Rob McClure … who just happened to be assuming Williams’ iconic role in Mrs. Doubtfire. However, had my memory of this particular nugget not failed me, I might not have been so pleasantly surprised by the brilliant show that McClure and his talented castmates put on for us.\n\nBefore heading to PPAC, I rewatched the Williams film, which came on TV just recently, to recall the details of the plot and have a good laugh. To my delight, this stage production remains mostly faithful to the film adaptation, with only a few divergences and several contemporary pop culture references sprinkled throughout to modernize it.\n\nFrom the literal outset – including the pre-show reminder to silence our cell phones and refrain from recording anything on stage – McClure proves deft at voice impressions, a prerequisite for living up to Williams’ improvisational genius. He never misses a beat, either, with his physical comedy, well-placed facial expressions, and showstopping, one-man-band with a loop machine in “It’s About Time,” the penultimate number of Act 1.\n\nThere’s tangible chemistry/tension between McClure and his on-stage wife, played by Maggie Lakis, who doubles as his real-life wife. The pair also starred together in Something Rotten! five years ago on tour when it came through Providence. Child actors can be hit-or-miss, but the trio of youngsters who portray the Hillard kids – Giselle Gutierrez, Axel Bernard Rimmele, and Kennedy Pitney – are precociously talented as singers, comedians, and at certain poignant points.\n\nOur Wednesday night show was completely sold out (not unusual at PPAC), and the entire audience shared uninhibited laugh-out-loud moments from start to finish. It proved impossible not to guffaw whenever Aaron Kaburick, who plays McClure’s make-up artist brother, yelled at the top of his lungs whenever his character spouted a lie – a recurring gag that our audience easily anticipated, but always thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nLike offensive linemen on a football field, ensemble cast members typically operate in obscurity, but Lannie Rubio deserves recognition for her turn as several different characters with speaking and singing parts – none more side-splitting than her Flamenco Singer in the climactic restaurant episode. The Miami native seems to draw on her Cuban-American life experience to affect an intentionally over-emphasized Spanish accent for the song, “He Lied to Me,” which she delivers with accompanying facial expressions and dance movements that make the revelatory scene all the more entertaining.\n\nSure, the storyline would be humorous, using the movie as our guide, but could the music keep pace? This question gave me the most pre-show trepidation, but again, I shouldn’t have been stunned by the result. A closer inspection of my playbill revealed that the writing team of Wayne Kirkpatrick, Karey Kirkpatrick, and John O’Farrell also served as the comedic brains behind Something Rotten!. They’ve now outdone themselves with Mrs. Doubtfire, which features a fantastic musical score, a perfect blend of ballads and comical songs to match the plot.\n\nWith everything deadly serious going on in our world this October, perhaps it seems a bit tone-deaf and self-absorbed to be writing about a topic as trivial as musical theater. By the same token, perhaps because of everything deadly serious going on right now, it’s necessary to write about something as wonderfully trivial as this, for the simple reason that laughter truly is the best medicine. And to remind us of what it means to be human, that some good still exists in our rapidly deteriorating world."
