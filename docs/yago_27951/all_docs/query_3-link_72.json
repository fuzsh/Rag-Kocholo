        "text": "If I were a movie producer and wanted to push middle-America further toward acceptance of cross-dressing (building on the effect of the female characters of bygone comics like Red Skelton, Flip Wilson and Jonathan Winters, and of movies like Dustin Hoffman’s “Tootsie”), I’d look for a human-interest script with a “justifiable” reason for engaging in the practice, and would want a top-flight dramatic actor who also had the comic ability to play anyone from Popeye to Peter Pan. Does what I’ve just said have anything to do with this film? Maybe, maybe not. We can’t prove the intent, but the effect is pretty clear.\n\nAs the film opens, Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is employed as the voice of all the characters in a Tweety-and-Sylvester type cartoon series, but quits his job for reasons of conscience (he believes one of the cartoons glorifies smoking). Then he throws a far-out birthday party for his son. he’s always been the spontaneous, funny one in the family; but this time his no-nonsense wife Miranda (Sally Field), who has her own professional career, is fed up with his antics and perpetual unemployment, and asks for a divorce. Daniel gets only one afternoon a week with his three kids. Desperate to see them more often, he concocts a plan to masquerade as a 60-year-old woman, Mrs. Iphegenia Doubtfire, and answer his wife’s ad for a housekeeper-nanny. Conveniently, Daniel has a gay brother Frank (gravelly-voiced actor/playwright/gay activist Harvey Fierstein, “Independence Day,” “Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde”); and Uncle Frank and his lover “Aunt Jack” happen to be movie-grade special-effects makeup artists. When Daniel asks “Can you make me a woman?” they’re only too happy to oblige. Once in disguise, Daniel’s vocal and acting talent do the rest. (The film’s actual makeup artists took home an Oscar.)\n\nContent: There’s profane language (including Daniel’s five-year-old daughter repeating g*d* after him) and sexual humor throughout. The cross-dressing, and Daniel’s woman-to-woman discussions with his wife about her handsome new boyfriend (Pierce Brosnan), provide plenty of adult comic material.\n\nThis is possibly Williams' finest performance in a technical sense; I don’t know of anyone else who could have done this wide-ranging role so convincingly. The heartbreak of divorce, the issue of visitation rights, a father’s love for his children—these are all worthwhile topics. But the gender-bending overtones take center stage to everything else. When he’s recognized by his two older children and asked if he really likes dressing that way, Daniel at first answers “yes” before deciding that he’d better say “no.” And after there’s no more need to play the role for visitation reasons, Daniel as Mrs. Doubtfire becomes the host of a children’s TV show. Although we get only a small glimpse of how the Hillard household was before the divorce, the implication is that Daniel is a better parent as a woman than he was as a man."
