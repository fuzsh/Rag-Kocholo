        "text": "Released 30 years ago, Mrs Doubtfire, which starred the late great Robin Williams as a prim and proper cross-dressing nanny with a refined Scots accent, was a box office smash around the world.\n\nBut while William's legendary character was certainly made up, it wasn't a complete work of fiction - Mrs Doubtfire, it turns out, was actually based on an eccentric, and, reportedly foul-mouthed, Aberdeen-born shopkeeper.\n\nThe story of the real 'Mrs Doubtfire', which was recalled on the BBC's The One Show this week to promote the West End musical adaptation of Mrs Doubtfire on the 30th anniversary of the movie, is about as far from Hollywood as it's possible to get.\n\nREAD MORE: A clash of clans as bloody 16th Century Aberdeenshire battle to be re-enacted\n\nEdinburgh Live reports how Madame Doubtfire was a moniker familiar to many residents in the Stockbridge area of the capital in the 1970s, as it was the name above the door to the premises of Annabella Coutts, whose second hand goods emporium was the stuff of legend.\n\nAnnabella was born on December 18, 1886 at 12 Innes Street in Aberdeen to parents, stone polisher John Adams and Margaret Ritchie. According to the 1901 census, the family lived in Barnett's Close.\n\nRecords show Annabella was a fish worker as of 1901 and five years later, a 20-year-old Annabella would marry Arthur Cyril Doubtfire, a 24-year-old bugler in the Scottish Rifles.\n\nThey were wed in the Adams' family home on Miller Street. Sadly, Arthur was killed in action during the First World War and Annabella would move to Edinburgh.\n\nHer now-legendary shop was opened following the death of her second husband, car mechanic James Coutts.\n\nSelling assorted furniture, ladies and gents clothing and assorted bric-a-brac, Madame Doubtfire's basement store, which was situated on the corner of Howe Street and South East Circus Place in the New Town, was an absolute riot.\n\nDimly-lit and haphazardly crammed with all manner of items, the second hand shop smelled to high heavens of pipe smoke and cat urine.\n\nFeline lover Mrs Coutts kept numerous cats on the premises and was said to have been a unique character - and one who shared little in common with the Robin Williams creation.\n\nFar from being gentle and well-spoken with a Morningside-like brogue as portrayed in the movie, Coutts was a fiery character with a piercing wit who was no stranger to the F word.\n\nWhile she was well-known in the Stockbridge vicinity, it was only after her death, in 1979, at the age of 92, that Mrs Coutts or 'Madame Doubtfire', would become a household name far and wide.\n\nIn the 1980s, novelist Anne Fine was in the process of writing a children's fiction book about a family with a divorced parents that would earn her fame and fortune.\n\nFine, who had lived in Edinburgh for a spell, used to pass Annabella's emporium daily while taking her children to school. The Madame Doubtfire name would stick with her and become the basis for her book's lead character and title.\n\nThe celebrated author, 75, told the BBC's The One Show: \"I used to have to walk my children to school, and I passed Madame Doubtfire's shop and I must say it just seemed the perfect name.\n\n\"Inside, it was extremely cramped, you could barely move for stuff. I did buy a sort of furry old cloak thing. It stank of cat pee - I probably washed it about 20 or 30 times.\"\n\nWell-received upon its publication, Fine's book provided the inspiration for Robin Williams' 1993 blockbuster, which would go on to gross more than $440 million (£340million) worldwide.\n\nThe author added: \"It does seem very strange that a 30-year-old person strolling around with their child to primary school can set off a chain of events that mean that everybody in the entire world knows the name Madame Doubtfire.\"\n\nYou can watch the BBC's The One Show episode featuring the origins of Mrs Doubtfire here.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nAberdeenshire dad who thought he had cold has both legs amputated after sepsis diagnosis"
