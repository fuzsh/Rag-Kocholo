        "text": "If it weren’t for some eye-poppingly exciting dinosaurs (and an eye-poppingly exciting Jeff Goldblum), the top-grossing movie of 1993 would have been Mrs. Doubtfire. That says everything about the power of the film’s star: Robin Williams dazzled audiences almost to the same extent as the most realistically depicted CGI dinosaurs in film history up to that point.\n\nBased on the 1987 English novel Madame Doubtfire, the film was released on November 24, 1993. It tells the story of a man whose bitter divorce drives him to disguise himself as an elderly female housekeeper so that he can spend time with his children. (The movie successfully walks the narrow line it needs to in order to not be as creepy as the premise suggests, although some people have had fun blurring said line.)\n\nAlthough fans were drawn in by the zany comedy of it all, the film also had a lot to say about the painful pressures of parenting, the emotional devastation divorce can wreak on both parents and kids, and the evolving definition of what actually constitutes a family. For all the unforgettably cartoonish comedy, there is a powerful, beating heart to the film, and it most certainly deserves a revisit with us paying tribute to the talented members of the main cast.\n\nRobin Williams\n\nAs impressive as the rest of the cast is, there would be no Mrs. Doubtfire without the manic genius of the Oscar-winning Robin Williams. (The Robin-powered mood is immediately set when the film opens with a long scene of Williams voicing a cartoon bird and cat and demonstrating his unparalleled comedic brilliance. If the entire movie were just Williams’ character ad-libbing his way through a problematic cartoon script, it would have been hilarious. But for every madcap moment of physical or verbal comedy, Williams digs even more deeply into the pathos and the pain his irresponsible but big-hearted character feels when separated from his kids. Although the film was adapted successfully into a stage musical, the property just couldn’t reach its impressive heights without Williams, who died in 2014. The overwhelming love his castmates felt for him was fully on display in a 2018 reunion, where they raved about his humor and, most of all, his heart.\n\nSally Field\n\nFor all of Williams’ comic pyrotechnics, the hardest role in the film definitely belongs to Sally Field, who has to play the heavy: a successful architect and mother who reaches the end of her patience with her manchild husband after he lets her down one too many times. Her journey of pulling away from him and navigating the messiness the split causes for all puts her character on thin ice with audiences, but Field expertly shows that the character’s tough choices all come from a good place. Mixing strength and vulnerability — and showcasing her own incredible flair for comedy — Field takes what could typically be the downer role in this type of film and turns the character into a flesh-and-blood human who is big enough to ultimately forgive but wise enough not to forget. It’s actually a very beautiful thing how touchingly Field plays this part, showing that divorce, even when it’s the best way forward for everyone, hurts parents too, and making audiences root for her character, who could so easily have been a cardboard villain, to get her own happy ending.\n\nPierce Brosnan\n\nAnother tricky role — that of a handsome gentleman caller whom Williams’ character initially sees as a usurper — was ably filled by James Bond himself, who reminded audiences of his ability to play comedy. Proving a perfect foil for the jealous Mrs. Doubtfire to sling barbs (and in one improvised scene, the famous lime) at, Pierce Brosnan gave his character a sense of decency and stability that made him both the perfect love interest for Sally Field’s character as well as an ultimately nonthreatening new potential stepfather to the kids. Gliding through the film with his signature grace and charm, Brosnan proved an excellent, sweet-natured addition who is able to bear Williams’ attacks with a twinkle in his eye. It’s a credit to the movie that it doesn’t make any of its main characters overtly saintly or evil, but instead ordinary, flawed people struggling to do their best. We’re left firmly believing that Field’s character will be better off in a relationship with Brosnan’s character than with her ex-husband — and that’s okay for everyone.\n\nHarvey Fierstein\n\nArguably the movie’s biggest scene-stealer, the four-time-Tony-winning Harvey Fierstein masterfully wrung laughs as Williams’ character’s brother, a makeup artist who is tasked with helping create the titular character disguise. Nailing the necessary affectionately exasperated rapport with Williams while also expertly tossing out zingers, Fierstein and his iconic gravelly voice were more than just another masterful comic element in the film. Portraying a proud, out gay man as a successful professional who is not only happily partnered but is also one of the film’s heroes, Fierstein was LGBTQ+ representation to a large segment of the film’s audience in 1993. In his 2022 autobiography, I Was Better Last Night: A Memoir, the actor wrote movingly of improvising a famous line in the film, as well as his deep affection for and connection with Williams. Definitely a must-read … and it leaves us wishing there had been a movie all about his character too.\n\nLisa Jakub\n\nOnly 15 when Mrs. Doubtfire was released, the stoic, intense Lisa Jakub was already a polished screen pro, with memorable small roles in Rambling Rose and Matinee as well as a slew of TV episodes and telefilms. Her experience showed in the important role as the elder daughter of the family, who finds herself having to take a much more grown-up role as a protector of her young siblings despite needing almost as much comfort as they do. Jakub delivers a moving, sensitive performance that shows real gravitas, and when she slowly starts to warm up to Mrs. Doubtfire — and then to accept her father for all his faults — the scenes feel anchored and moving in a way not every child actor can manage. Although the actress would retire from the industry in 2001, she never forgot how impactful this movie and Williams were to her life, writing a poignant blog post paying tribute to him after his passing.\n\nMatthew Lawrence\n\nThe middle brother of the Lawrence child-star acting dynasty (what’s up, Joey and Andrew?), Matthew Lawrence also was a seasoned thespian when he accepted the role of the only son in the family. Not only did he get an incredible firsthand master class watching Williams at work, but he also learned a devastating lesson about the mental health struggles the star underwent, as Lawrence discussed on an episode of his family’s Brotherly Love podcast. Although his role wasn’t one of the showiest, Lawrence brought his signature likability to it, and he displayed some impressive chops, especially in this deleted scene. And unlike his film sisters, Lawrence decided to stay in the industry and notched a steady list of credits, perhaps most memorably his long-running role on Boy Meets World.\n\nMara Wilson\n\nAnd of course, one of the most memorable actors in the film — and one of the most memorable child performers of her era — Mara Wilson stole Mrs. Doubtfire scenes as the sweet younger daughter. Equally adept at cracking a joke as she was at playing more dramatic scenes, Wilson made a huge impression on audiences. In fact, she went on to briefly become the child-star queen of Hollywood, at least for a couple of years. In addition to singing onstage at the Oscars, she landed the leads in the remake of Miracle on 34th Street, the enduring classic Matilda, and the Martin Short comedy A Simple Wish. Despite her success, Wilson decided to step away from acting and focus on her education, graduating from NYU in 2009 and building a successful career as a writer and wry humorist. Her tribute to Williams after his death was, in some ways, the most moving, quoting her Mrs. Doubtfire role. She wrote, “If you can affect someone when they’re young, you are in their heart forever. … I suppose — could I really end this any other way? — we’re all his goddamn kids too.”\n\nScarlett Harris is a culture critic and author of A Diva Was a Female Version of a Wrestler: An Abbreviated Herstory of World Wrestling Entertainment.
