The wig shows remnants of make-up inside the netting from production use. Also included is a biscuit-foam cast of Robin Williams head which is painted off-white. The wig shows minor wear to the hair due to production use and storage. However, both wig and head cast remain in very fine condition. Dimensions 33 cm x 25 cm x 46 cm (13 x 10 x 18)br br 1,000 - 1,500",
