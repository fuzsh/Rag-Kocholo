This 1993 interview is a great example of that presence. Williams gets one question about his Scottish accent he donned for Mrs. Doubtfire and goes on a minute and a half-Scottish rant! It's incredible how this guy always seemed to be on when it came to entertaining others.\n\nWatch the interview below."
