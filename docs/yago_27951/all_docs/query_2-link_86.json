        "text": "Mrs. Doubtfire — that classic movie about a dad who loves his kids so much he’ll moonlight as a middle-aged Irish nanny to see them while his ex-wife tries to take full custody — has turned into a beloved souvenir magnet: created for the new Mrs. Doubtfire musical hitting stages across the country.\n\nWhen I went to see the musical, I was hesitant that the magnet I bought at the merch counter while waiting for the show to start wouldn’t live up to its Hollywood counterpart. It’s a CLASSIC, I thought — with ROBIN WILLIAMS, I also thought — how could this magnet possibly compare?\n\nTo my delight, however, this magnet successfully encompasses the nostalgia of the movie while offering a fresh new nod to the musical that it was designed for.\n\nThe “Mrs. Doubtfire: The Musical” magnet is comedically brilliant from corner to corner\n\nAt first I thought this magnet would garner most of its comedic value from being the kind of magnet that was so bad you can’t help but laugh. But I was unexpectedly impressed by its range of comedic elements."
