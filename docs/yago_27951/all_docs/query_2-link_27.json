        "text": "Background\n\nMrs. Doubtfire, the new musical comedy, is based on the 1993 film starring Robin Williams, which in turn was based on a 1987 YA novel by Anne Fine about a family dealing with a messy divorce. Dad Daniel is a struggling out-of-work actor whose alter ego is Peter Pan: he doesn’t want to grow up. After losing custody of his three children in his own messy divorce, he creates the kindly character of Scottish nanny Euphegenia Doubtfire in a desperate attempt to stay in their lives.\n\nOBC to on the Road The musical’s star is Rob McClure, who originated the role on Broadway and now takes it on tour. “McClure is a great performer who proves a wide-ranging mimic,” saidThe Chicago Sun-Times. “He gets the heart of the story’s arc just right.” Of course, he will be compared to Robin Williams’ film performance. McClure’s “performance is worth the price of admission alone,” said MD Theater Guide. “He does Robin Williams proud but makes his own mark as the character.”\n\nStanding the test of timeBut Daniel is not simply in want of some lessons in maturity. The audience will understand his need to be with his children, and the young members of his family want opportunities to develop a better relationship with Dad. “The best thing about Mrs. Doubtfire is that it restores the heartfelt message of the original book—that divorce doesn’t have to be an end for a family, but can simply be a new chapter,” said New City Stage. There is no such thing as a perfect family, but love and laughter will see them through difficult times."
