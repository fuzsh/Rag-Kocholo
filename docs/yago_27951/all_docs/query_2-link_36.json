        "text": "You many not know the name Daniel Hillard, even though you've likely seen the movie in which he's the main character - repeatedly.\n\nDaniel Hillard, you see, spends most of that movie portraying his alter ego – the irrepressible, modern-day Mary Poppins known as Euphegenia Doubtfire.\n\nThe musical based on – and true to – the 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire plays the Belk Theater from April 30 through May 5. It still takes place in San Francisco, but it’s now set in the present day.\n\nA creative dream team is behind it.\n\nJerry Zaks, who won Tony Awards for directing The House of Blue Leaves, Lend Me a Tenor, Guys and Dolls and Six Degrees of Separation, is at the helm. Jodi Kimura, one of several actors from the Broadway run now touring with the show, called Zaks “an actor’s director.” (He’s an actor himself; he made his Broadway debut as Kenickie in Grease.)\n\nLorin Latarro, whose credits include Broadway’s Tommy, Into The Woods, Waitress, The Metropolitan Opera’s La Traviata and more, choreographed the madcap show. Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick wrote the songs (like “Make Me A Woman” and “Big Fat No”), and Karey Kirkpatrick and John O’Farrell wrote the laugh-out-loud book.\n\nZaks told the cast that “laughter is the sound of the audience falling in love,” Kimura said. And from the sounds of it, audiences are falling in love with the show night after night.\n\n(L to R: Maggie Lakis (Miranda Hillard) and Rob McClure (Daniel Hillard). Photo by Joan Marcus)\n\nThe story introduces us to the previously mentioned Daniel, a struggling, out-of-work actor and unreliable husband (but “fun dad” who will do anything for his three kids). After losing custody in a messy divorce, he remains a presence in their lives by transforming into a kindly Scottish nanny.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nIf you’ve seen the movie, you know the plan backfires in countless ways. As Daniel’s scheme becomes too much to manage, the fictional Mrs. Doubtfire teaches him a few things about parenthood.\n\nBroadway star hits the road\n\nTwo-time Tony Award nominee Rob McClure (Chaplin, Mrs. Doubtfire) – who originated the role on Broadway that Robin Williams made famous on film – leads the national tour, alongside a co-star he knows well – his real-life wife, Maggie Lakis (Avenue Q, Something Rotten!).\n\nIt’s rare for a Broadway lead to tour with the show. In this case, McClure is joined on the road by three of his Broadway castmates – Kimura, Aaron Kaburick (who understudied the role of Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire on Broadway) and David Hibbard.\n\n( First National Touring Company of Mrs. Doubtfire. Photo by Joan Marcus)\n\nKimura said the musical’s abbreviated Broadway run (due to COVID shutdowns) may have something to do with the actors not being ready to let go: “Our time on Broadway wasn’t as long as we’d hoped. We’re grateful to have the chance to continue telling this sweet, funny story.”\n\nMcClure’s frenetic performance earned him Tony, Drama Desk, Drama League and Outer Critics Circle nominations. Some critics have compared his performance favorably to that of the beloved actor who originated the role.\n\n“Like Robin Williams, Rob is adept at a lot,” Kimura said. “He’s funny. He can do impressions. He sings and dances. He’s a rare combination of talent. And his big heart really comes through.”\n\n(Rob McClure (Euphegenia Doubtfire). Photo by Joan Marcus)\n\nA sweet message\n\nKimura, who made her Broadway debut as Janet Lundy in this very show, previously toured the U.S. and U.K. with the Bartlett Sher-directed South Pacific. Her portrayal of “Bloody Mary” in that show earned her a Helen Hayes Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. That tour also brought her to Charlotte. She’s eager to return to the Belk Theater – and to Mert’s Heart and Soul.\n\nJanet Lundy was Jonathan Lundy in the movie. The CEO of the TV station where Daniel gets a job is still a Lundy – but now, it’s a woman.\n\nKimura said Lundy gets her big moment in Act II. She won’t reveal what happens but said it’s great fun to play a scene that always gets an audience response.\n\n(L to R: Axel Bernard Rimmele (Christopher Hillard), Giselle Gutierrez (Lydia Hillard), Rob McClure (Euphegenia Doubtfire), and Kennedy Alexandra Pitney (Natalie Hillard). Photo by Joan Marcus.)\n\nThe musical number she enjoys most comes near the end of Act I when Mrs. Doubtfire consults YouTube on how to whip up dinner – and tap-dancing chefs emerge to sing “Easy Peasy.”"
