        "text": "We still can't get over the fact that there will be a Mrs. Doubtfire sequel - and that Robin Williams is all for it.\n\nBut if you're thinking the whole Hillard family will be on board, think again! Mara Wilson, who back when she was five played Robin Williams' daughter Natalie Hillard, is \"not interested\" by the idea.\n\nAsked on Twitter whether she'd be involved, she said: \"I've been in some mediocre movies, but I've never been in a sequel. And I have no interest in being in one now.\n\n\"Sequels generally suck unless they were planned as part of a trilogy or series. I think Doubtfire ended where it needed to end.\n\n\"I'm glad I had the chance to be in it, and I'm proud of what we did, but I don't see how we could do it again.\"\n\nGoing into more detail (after her followers wanted to know why), she added: \"There are many, many reasons I don't want to be in Mrs Doubtfire 2.\n\n\"They haven't asked me to be in it, and I think it would be weird if they did! I don't act much and am not a cute little kid anymore.\"\n\nMara Wilson is now 26 and is a writer and playwright. For this story we read every word of her frequently asked questions on her website, and it's a fact: we love her more now, than when she played the cute kid in Matilda.\n\nOn 17 April 2014, we wrote...\n\nOh hellooooo, dear! This might be the best news of this entire week - a sequel to the 1993 comedy movie Mrs. Doubtfire is said to be in development.\n\nThe film which saw Robin Williams pretend to be a Scottish housekeeper in order to spend more time with his children is reportedly getting a sequel, The Wrap reports.\n\nAnd just wait until you find out who has been tapped to write the script - only the writer of Elf, David Berenbaum.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire earned an estimated $441 million at the box office upon its debut."
