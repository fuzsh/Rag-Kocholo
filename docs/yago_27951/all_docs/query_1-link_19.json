        "text": "Fox 2000 is ready to have more hot flashes.\n\nThe studio is developing a sequel to the 1993 hit Mrs. Doubtfire, which would reunite director Chris Columbus and star Robin Williams.\n\nDavid Berenbaum, who wrote Elf, is writing the script.\n\nPHOTOS: Cameos in Prequels, Reboots and Remakes\n\nDoubtfire starred Williams as a struggling actor and recently divorced father of three who, in order to be closer to his children, takes on the persona of a Scottish nanny, Euphegenia Doubtfire.\n\nHilarity, misunderstandings and family love ensued to the tune of $219 million domestically and $222 million internationally. Williams won a Golden Globe in the best actor in a musical/comedy category while the movie won the Globe for best comedy/musical.\n\nA sequel has been in the works since 2001 when Bonnie Hunt was tapped to write a script, but despite many drafts and other scribes hired, the project slowly died and has been inactive for years, mainly due to Columbus and Williams not sparking to any new take.\n\nThe project became active again early this year with Berenbaum’s involvement and while it’s too soon to predict if all the elements will ultimately come together, Williams and Columbus are attached and hopeful about the outcome.\n\nElizabeth Gabler and Marisa Paiva are overseeing for Fox 2000.\n\nPHOTOS: 15 of Hollywood’s Most Notable Remakes\n\nIn addition to penning Elf, the Will Ferrell Christmas comedy that is now a perennial classic, Berenbaum has worked on family films such as Haunted Mansion and The Spiderwick Chronicles.\n\nColumbus is in preproduction on his latest movie, Pixels, the sci-fi adventure movie that will star Adam Sandler and shoot in Toronto this summer.\n\nWilliams has Lionsgate’s drama The Angriest Man in Brooklyn opening May 23 and is the star of CBS’ The Crazy Ones.\n\nColumbus, Williams and Berenbaum are all repped by WME.\n\nColumbus is additionally repped by Hansen Jacobson while Williams by Brezner Steinberg Partners and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. Berenbaum by additionally repped by Kaplan/Perrone Entertainment and Rosen Feig."
