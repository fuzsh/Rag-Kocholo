As with the film, the musical is set in the city of San Francisco, California. However, the timeframe has been updated to the 21st century. The stage musical has references to both technology and pop culture that did not exist in 1993 when the film was released.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nA musical adaptation of Mrs. Doubtfire was in the works in 2015, with music by Alan Menken, lyrics by David Zippel, and a book by Harvey Fierstein (who played Frank Hillard in the movie). Producer Kevin McCollum had previously spoken to The New York Times in 2013 about the 1993 movie's musical prospects, noting that the plot was \"tailored for Broadway audiences\".[1] However, three years later, Menken told that the project was put on 'creative hiatus', citing changes in the creative team as the problem.[2] Nevertheless, in 2018, McCollum revealed that the adaptation was still aiming for a Broadway bow, but with an entirely different creative team which includes Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick composing the score, and John O'Farrell and Karey Kirkpatrick writing the book. Tony Award-winner Jerry Zaks became the director of the show.[3]\n\nOn May 16 and 17, 2019, the musical held a reading with a cast including Rob McClure, Kate Baldwin, Mario Cantone, and Jake Ryan Flynn.[4]\n\nProductions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe musical is directed by Jerry Zaks with choreography by Lorin Latarro and music supervision, arrangements and orchestrations by Ethan Popp.[5] Rob McClure plays the role of Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire,[4] with Jenn Gambatese as Miranda Hillard, Brad Oscar as Frank Hillard, Analise Scarpaci as Lydia Hillard, Jake Ryan Flynn as Christopher Hillard, Avery Sell as Natalie Hillard, J. Harrison Ghee as Andre, Mark Evans as Stuart Dunmire, Charity Angél Dawson as Wanda Sellner, and Peter Bartlett as Mr. Jolly.[6] The cast originally included the late Doreen Montalvo as Janet Lundy. Montalvo performed in the Seattle tryout and the three pre-COVID Broadway previews, but died suddenly in October 2020.[7]\n\nSeattle (2019)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe musical made its world premiere at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, Washington, beginning previews on November 26, 2019, with an official opening on December 13, with an intention to run until December 29 before being extended due to popular demand until January 4, 2020.\n\nBroadway (2021–2022)\n\n[edit]\n\nMrs. Doubtfire began Broadway previews on March 9, 2020, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre, with a planned opening night the following month.[6] Due to the Governor's response to the coronavirus pandemic, all Broadway productions were suspended on March 12, 2020. Mrs. Doubtfire resumed previews on October 21, 2021, officially opening December 5.[8][9][10] The production went on hiatus from January 10, 2022,[11] through April 14.[12] A month after reopening, producers announced the production would close on May 29, 2022, after 43 previews and 83 regular performances.[13]\n\nManchester (2022)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 5, 2021, it was announced that the musical will make its UK premiere at the Manchester Opera House the following year, opening on 2 September, and running until 1 October.[14] The run received generally favourable reviews.[15][16]\n\nLondon (2023–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 15, 2022, it was announced that the musical will transfer to London's Shaftesbury Theatre, opening on 12 May 2023.[17]\n\nThe show started previews on 12 May 2023 before a Gala performance on 18 June 2023. The production stars Gabriel Vick as the title role, alongside Laura Tebbutt as Miranda; Carla Dixon Hernandez as Lydia; Samuel Edwards as Stuart; and Cameron Blakely and Marcus Collins as Frank and Andre. The show opened to positive reviews.\n\nNorth American Tour (2023)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 2023, it was announced that the show would embark on a North American national tour in fall 2023. The tour began performances on September 29, 2023 at Shea's Performing Arts Center in Buffalo, New York. The tour is scheduled to make stops in over thirty cities through July 2024.[18] In July 2023, it was announced that Rob McClure would reprise his Tony Award-nominated role as Daniel Hillard/Mrs.Doubtfire for the national tour. His real-life wife Maggie Lakis will also join the tour as Miranda Hillard.[19] In August 2023, full casting was announced. Joining McClure and Lakis are Giselle Gutierrez as Lydia Hillard, Aaron Kaburick as Frank Hillard, Nik Alexander as Andre Mayem, Leo Roberts as Stuart Dunmire, Romelda Teron Benjamin as Wanda Sellner, Cody Sawyer Braverman and Axel Bernard Rimmele as Christopher Hillard, and Emerson Mae Chan and Kennedy Alexandra Pitney as Natalie Hillard.[20]\n\nOther performances\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the cast of Mrs. Doubtfire performed their song \"Rockin' Now\" on Good Morning America.\n\nMusical numbers\n\n[edit]\n\nSource: Playbill[21]\n\n2021 Broadway Production\n\n[edit]\n\n2023 North American Tour and London Production\n\n[edit]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nCharacter Workshop Seattle Broadway[21] Manchester West End[22] North American Tour[23] 2019 2021 2022 2023 Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire Rob McClure Gabriel Vick Rob McClure Miranda Hillard Kate Baldwin Jenn Gambatese Laura Tebbutt Maggie Lakis Frank Hillard Mario Cantone Brad Oscar Cameron Blakely Aaron Kaburick Mr. Jolly Peter Bartlett Ian Talbot David Hibbard Wanda Sellner Charity Angél Dawson Vanessa Fisher Kelly Agbowu Romelda Teron Benjamin Stuart Dunmire Mark Evans Dominic Andersen Samuel Edwards Leo Roberts Andre Mayem Michael James Scott J.

However, some of the characters and plot points were criticized for feeling written as tired and forgettable. Likewise, the score was mostly criticized for being unmemorable, though enjoyable.[citation needed]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee Result 2022 Drama Desk Awards[24] Outstanding Actor in a Musical Rob McClure Nominated Outstanding Wig and Hair Design David Brian Brown Won Outer Critics Circle Award[25] Outstanding New Musical Nominated Outstanding Actor in a Musical Rob McClure Nominated Outstanding Director of a Musical Jerry Zaks Nominated Outstanding Book of a Musical Karey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell Nominated Outstanding Score Karey Kirkpatrick and Wayne Kirkpatrick Nominated Outstanding Costume Design (Play or Musical) Catherine Zuber Nominated Tony Awards[26][27] Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical Rob McClure Nominated\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
