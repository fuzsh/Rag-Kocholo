        "text": "London's Mrs. Doubtfire, entering its second year in London's West End, welcomes new cast members beginning May 14 at the Shaftesbury Theatre.\n\nGabriel Vick continues his run leading the cast as Daniel Hillard, remaining with the production alongside Laura Tebbutt as Miranda Hillard, Cameron Blakely as Frank Hillard, and Marcus Collins as Andre.\n\nNewly joining the company are Micha Richardson as Wanda Sellner, Charlotte Fleming as Lydia Hillard, Matthew Goodgame as Stuart Dunmire, and Ross Dawes as Mr. Jolly. The ensemble comprises Michael Afemaré, Alex Bowen, Nicole Carlisle, Joshua Dever, Joseph Dockree, Autumn Draper, Maria Garrett, Cristina Hoey, Peter Houston, Jodie Knight, Ryan Lay, Adam Lyons, Lisa Mathieson, Ellie Mitchell, Perry O’Dea, Rhys Owen, Bleu Woodward, and Tom Woollaston.\n\nThommy Bailey Vine, Herbie Byers, and Parker Newman newly share the role of Christopher Hillard, and Rachelle Bonfield-Bell, Ellemie Shivers, and Felicity Walton share the role of Natalie Hillard.\n\nThe West End bow of Mrs. Doubtfire opened June 22, 2023, after beginning previews May 12. The West End run follows the musical's U.K. premiere at Manchester Opera House and a Broadway run starring Rob McClure at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre December 5, 2021–May 29, 2022.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire, based on the 1993 movie about an out-of-work father who disguises himself as a British nanny to spend more time with his children, features a score by Wayne Kirkpatrick and Karey Kirkpatrick and a book co-written by Karey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell (the writing team behind Something Rotten!).\n\nFour-time Tony winner Jerry Zaks directs, with choreography by Lorin Latarro and music supervision, arrangements, and orchestrations by Ethan Popp. As on Broadway, the production includes scenic design by David Korins, costume design by Catherine Zuber, lighting design by Philip S. Rosenberg, sound design by Brian Ronan, hair and wig design by David Brian Brown, and make-up and prosthetics design by Tommy Kurzman. The London production is cast by Stuart Burt, with children's casting by Verity Naughton.\n\nKevin McCollum and Jamie Wilson, who produced the musical's Broadway premiere, produce the West End bow as well, by special arrangement with Buena Vista Theatrical."
