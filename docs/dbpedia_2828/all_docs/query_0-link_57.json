        "text": "Previous leg: Spikkestad-Drammen\n\nNext leg: Galleberg-Sande\n\nDecember 2013 and April 2014\n\nDrammen – with Bragernes Church in the middle of the photo. Taken from the railway station area.\n\nThis is the entrance to the station building:\n\nI soon found some interesting water power installations on display:\n\nOther engineers have been busy in this area too:\n\nI had to take a look behind this door, but the only thing I could spot, was a door. Peculiar. Can it be an effect of the Norwegian strict rules for serving alcohol outdoors? Or is it an artwork? I have to find out…\n\nThen the trail passes a former town hall, dating from 1808. The building was turned into a school already in 1816:\n\nLooking around the corner of it, you will spot Strømsø Chruch, a wooden building from 1667.\n\nThe street you walk, is not a new one:\n\nNowadays, several of the buildings are turned into shops or rebuilt:\n\nThis house is brand new, but the main door is made as a copy of the old one. The original of the decoration above the door can be found on the local museum:\n\nIt is quite different in style from the entrance to the railway station…\n\nHere is the story behind this entrance decoration – in Norwegian, found on www:\n\nSo after Mrs. Høyer testamented the building to become a school for poor kids (in 1785), the building has been used both as a steem bath and as a factory for iron parts used in shoes before it was demolished and rebuilt. Iron parts like these:\n\nI wonder how many km all those armed shoes could have walked, if you summed it up?!\n\nFurther on, looking back towards the Church, you will spot that Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson has given inspiration to a street name here, as he has done in many other Norwegian cities.\n\nFrom here you walk uphill, and soon you get to a protected farm building:\n\nIt is called Austad, and is nowadays a part of Drammen Museum.\n\nFurther on, the streets turn into paths:\n\nSome optimists had tried to prepare the ski slopes very thoroughly some weeks before I passed. In spite of that, there was not much snow left for Christmas…\n\nAfter a short walk in the forrest, I soon arrived at this cabin – owned by the Norwegian Trekking Association:\n\nAnd behold! My friend Turbo was actually hanging around inside the cabin! Only he must have had music in his ears, as he did not react as we knocked on the window. His full name is Turbo Arctic Fox, and he is the mascot of The Children’s Trekking Club. He is a happy chap always trekking the mountains, but apparently celebrating New Year’s Eve in the hills of Drammen this year.\n\nWe found another unblinded window. He keeps the cabin very tidy…\n\nAs we could not get in, we walked on. The forest roads were lighted, and looked like this:\n\nAfter a while we stopped at signs pointing towards a tower, and after some discussion we left the trail to find it:\n\nSo now I know the Direct distances from here to Nidaros, Jerusalem and Mekka. But what about Santiago de Compostela? Should I rather change the goal for my walk? By the way – you have to remember to sign the protocol! I turned out as number 1718 since July, with the local dog Molly as number 1717…\n\nIf you get dizzy on your way down from this tower, you can refer to this address when you call for help!\n\nAt many cabins you will notice a blue “Nødplakat” on the wall. It tells your exact geographical position, so if you need to call for help, you call 1-1-3 and pass the numbers. This is even more accurate than a street address.\n\nFYI: Around this corner there are some very clean facilities, and you get in even if the cabin is closed. The cabin is run by a sports club, and is occationally open.\n\nSpring flowers next! This is Anemone hepatica.\n\nHere we found a great view, but it was a bit windy, so you might spot that I freeze a little bit. I recommend to carry some hot tea on December walks!\n\nDown here it was warmer again:\n\nSissel and I are checking the size of this stone. We tried to lift it, but we did not find any handles.\n\nThis sign tells you not to walk in the ski slope, but it doesn’t tell under what conditions this is prohibited. We took the chance…\n\nFrom the Mælen farm you walk along the local road until you reach Old Skoger Church. Very little traffic, though.\n\nAs this spot had a street address, I assumed that someone had to live there, and I wondered who it could be.\n\nBehind my back I found the answer! They were a whole colony!\n\nHere is a telephone number, in case you want to order some honey to be placed here for your next passing.\n\nI am impressed by the planners of the strech Drammen-Skoger. I think we passed at least five pleasant benches. Along many other pilgrim stretches the service level is much lower…\n\nFrom this bench you get a grafical winter view:\n\nAt some point you will pass the coat of arms for Drammen. A key and a sword are crossed in the middle forming an x. The underlaying motto is In Fide Et Justitia Fortitudo (“in faith and justice is strength”), and the items in the seal are referring to this: key = faith, sword = justice, column on rocks = strength.\n\nYou will pass the present Skoger Church. Not far away from it, along the trail, you then arrive at the Old Skoger Church – the oldest building in the Drammen area:\n\nThere is no chance to stamp your pilgrim passport here, as far as I could find out…\n\nBut the view is great:\n\nInformation on Skoger Old Church.\n\nIt must have been raining lately:\n\nNo golfers around:\n\nSome locals told us funny stories:\n\nYou will arrive at this road over there – between the poles. We just took a small detour to get this photo.\n\nLooking back, you understand why they put the church where they put it, 800 years ago.\n\nThis pilgrim sign will not be easy to spot when the trees grow green…\n\nThis mighty waterfall ought to be frozen at this time of the year:\n\nDownhill from the waterfall you can spot an old factory. Rumors tell about successful trout fishing here:\n\nSo what could have been produced?\n\nIt is not always easy to search the web for such historical information…\n\nNoone could be seen to ask either.\n\nAn hour further south a local pedestrian was able to reveal the secret. This was originally “Drammen ullvarefabrikk” – a factory producing yarn and fabrics made of wool.\n\nI did not see any trout nor factory workers, but the road went on, and I soon spotted signs of living creatures. Guess what sort:\n\nStraight up the hill from the factory there is a bench with a wide view – under the pine tree to the right in this photo:\n\nMany places I got an unclear feeling that summer was not far away:\n\nThe locals were out walking their pets:\n\nThe area offers temptations for weary wanderers:\n\nThe roads were well prepared for winter driving:\n\n“Eh-oh! Laa-Laa?”\n\nYou should take a closer look at this photo, and combine the text of the sign with the state of the building… Is this the outcome of a high quality marketing plan? Or not?\n\nTime to stop.\n\nIt seems that the following leg will bring some downhill walking behind that farm…\n\nAnd to get back here by bus, I have to remember to schedule my trip outside the weekend…\n\nNo cross country skiers were passing us on this winter trip. But we easily passed this one:\n\nRemember – if you walk in this area around New Years Eve, the sun sets at 03:30 p.m. – which gives you plenty of time to plan your next day!"
