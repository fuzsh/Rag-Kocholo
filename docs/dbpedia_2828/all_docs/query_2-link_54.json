        "text": "The Partnership for European Environmental Research (PEER) as a network excels in the research on the biophysical and socio-ecological impacts linked to the implementation of the SDGs and the associated risks.\n\nThe pathways toward SDGs may lead to negative, unintended side-effects such as environmental impacts of green consumption patterns or over-use of water or chemicals for the intensified food-production. Although SDGs are implicitly about reducing or controlling risks (e.g., they deal with acting on climate change, tackling sustainability questions in cities and communities as well as responsible consumption and production patterns), there is no specific SDG for risks, and both the SDGs and the associated 169 targets address risks in an incoherent fashion.\n\nThe project PEER-TRISD aims to:\n\nCreate a common understanding on what SDG-related risks exist, should be monitored, anticipated, and governed in the public and private sectors\n\nAnalyse the monitoring, anticipation and governance needs, the existing UN, EU and national level systems and specific SDG systems\n\nCo-create recommendations that can support risk management in the implementation of SDGs in the policy field but also among the practitioners\n\nIdentify needs for future research efforts and policy measures\n\nThe following key tasks are planned:\n\nCo-creation workshops for actor and activity scanning\n\nSystem mapping through literature review\n\nMulti-level analysis of monitoring systems, indicators, and statistics\n\nCase studies of existing systems with SDGs to analyse of interlinkage and risk (e.g., cities, life on land, water)\n\nCoordinating institutes:\n\nUFZ - Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research and SYKE - Finnish Environment Institute\n\nThe DECIAS project is aimed at developing a modelling toolbox for environmental sustainability assessment based upon Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), dynamic Material Flow Analysis (MFA), and multiregional Input Output Analysis (MRIO).\n\nThe production, trade, and consumption of goods and services leads to significant impacts on the climate, environment and human health. The adoption of technological innovations or policies and measures targeting sustainable development can be aided by a systemic sustainability assessment that checks that actions are economically sound and do not come at increased environmental and social cost compared to the present situation. In fact, for many actions it is often possible to identify co-benefits across a range of economic, environmental and social indicators.\n\nThe DECIAS project aims to develop a multidisciplinary modeling framework and toolbox to better understand environmental impacts driven by economic activity and consumption. The framework will be based on Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) assessment. It captures the release of pollutants from human activities through the entire life cycle of materials, and leverages NILU’s experience in modelling pollutant transport through the environment.\n\nResults will enable the comparative assessment of innovations, policies and measures for a transition to a green and circular economy, by estimating the associated social, environmental and climate costs and benefits.\n\nThe framework and tools will be developed through a series of case studies to test and demonstrate proof-of-concept. The project will focus on identifying impacts related to the cross-cutting topic climate-energy-land-water signified by UN SDGs 6, 7, 13, 14, 15 and relate to SDGs 3 on health and 12 on sustainable consumption and production.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_14339\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1024\"] Life cycle[/caption]\n\nThis SIS-project is designed in a close collaboration between NILU and NIVA with an overall objective to develop a methodological framework which can help with structure thinking and provide a systematic approach to the analysis of urban environmental sustainability.\n\nThe methodological framework will be developed based on the EEA’s urban sustainability conceptual framework and linking to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), e.g., including the city context, key enabling factors, urban lenses and building blocks for urban sustainable development.\n\nThe following key specific thematic topics and research questions will be addressed in the project:\n\nNature-based solutions\n\nHow to support cities towards more effective mitigation and adaptation to climate change?\n\nAssessment of environmental contaminants in the urban environment\n\nHow does the composition of environmental contaminants in the urban environments change, e.g., as a result of urbanization, climate change and sustainable measures?\n\nBehavioral change and citizen engagement\n\nHow to improve human behavior to minimize emissions and pollution exposure?\n\nWell-being and health\n\nHow to improve health and well-being by innovative solutions in urban sustainable transitions?\n\nThe SIS-project has been broken down into the following three working groups (WG).\n\nWG1 – Environmental contaminants\n\nWG2 – Operationalization of UN SDGs & measurement of urban sustainability\n\nWG3 – Assessment of municipal needs\n\nThe project results are expected to\n\nfacilitate different forms of analysis and assessment of urban environmental sustainability that will help decision-makers to identify policy options and priorities; and\n\nunderpin and support a transition to urban environmental sustainability.\n\nThe iFLINK project shall facilitate for monitoring AQ at many different places at low costs. Scientists working in the project will develop and use new calibration and visualization methods based on machine learning and data fusion techniques to correct and improve data quality from the cheaper sensors. They shall also develop an open technology solution to obtain and quality secure data from different AQ sensors, so that municipalities and other users can obtain AQ data in satisfying quality.\n\nMany municipalities in Norway would like to measure air quality (AQ) in their local environment and share this information with their citizens.\n\nHowever, official monitoring stations are quite expensive in acquisition and maintenance, therefore only a limited number of these stations are set up in Norwegian municipalities.\n\nAs alternative, more simple and cheap air quality sensors could be used that are easier to buy from a range of manufacturers. The challenge for these kind of sensors is the relative high uncertainty around the quality of their data. In addition, they require good solutions for data communication and storage to be able to set together AQ information from a range of different sensors and thus get a good overview of the AQ situation in real time.\n\nThe iFLINK project shall facilitate for monitoring AQ at many different places at low costs. Scientists working in the project will develop and use new calibration and visualization methods based on machine learning and data fusion techniques to correct and improve data quality from the cheaper sensors. They shall also develop an open technology solution to obtain and quality secure data from different AQ sensors, so that municipalities and other users can obtain AQ data in satisfying quality.\n\nThe project idea is that anyone can use iFLINK results and technology to develop real time services connected to AQ, climate change and noise pollution. Municipalities are most important supporters and partners in the project, first pilots will be carried out in the participating municipalities Oslo (project lead), Bergen, Bærum, Drammen and Kristiansand."
