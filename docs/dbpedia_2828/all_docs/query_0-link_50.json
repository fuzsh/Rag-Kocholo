        "text": "Back to hotel and to sleep midnight.\n\nSaturday, April 5 (Jonas Fjeld in Drammen)\n\nChecked out of the Grand Hotel and on train 9:10 to Oslo. Talked to a couple of older men on the platform who instantly ID'd me as American country musician. Very friendly. Cloudy and colder today.\n\nTerje picked me up at Drammen station. Ben, May Britt's brother was there. He has played guitar with Jonas (Terje) for many years. He and Terje left about 1P for the venue not far away to rehearse with the regional concert band whose 20th anniversary concert this was. I rested a bit while they were gone. Another late night/early morning.\n\nBen came back at to get me. The venue is a large cultural center in Drammen.\n\nI met Tove, a politician and former singer. She was the host on stage and a great one she was. Extremely animated and exciting to watch. There were probably 600 people in the audience.\n\nThe program was almost half Terje, two songs with the band, and five with just him and Ben. The two of them are great. Jonas Fjeld is a legend and a superstar in Norway. It was a privilege to hear him like this. Check out the history through this link here."
