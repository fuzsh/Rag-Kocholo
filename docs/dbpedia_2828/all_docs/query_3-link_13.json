        "text": "Expect to be impressed by trains operated by VY Railways, GoAhead Norge, and SJ. Modern, comfortable, and ready to carry you across the country at all times of the day, they're pretty awesome. You can check times for trains in Norway using the Eurail Timetable.\n\nReservations for most Norwegian trains are shown as optional in the Timetable. However, we advise you to always make reservations in Norway, because trains often get fully booked.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you reserve a seat on the long distance trains because these trains can fill up quickly, especially in high-season.\n\nHow can I make reservations for trains in Norway?\n\nEurail reservation self-service system\n\nEurail\n\nRegiontog\n\nAdministration costs when booking through Eurail self-service\n\n€ 2,- p.p.per train\n\nAdditional € 9,- per order (for paper tickets)\n\nWith railway carriers\n\nEntur Domestic trains\n\nLocally at the train station in Norway\n\nBy calling the Entur call center:\n\n+47 61 27 90 88 (press 9 for services in english)\n\nOpening hours:\n\nMonday to Friday: 07:00 – 23:00\n\nSaturday: 08:00 – 21:00\n\nSunday: 08:00 – 23:00\n\nOpening hours during bank holidays are shorter.\n\nEntur Call Center handles bookings on behalf of all Norwegian train operators (except Flytoget AS). You may book tickets or seat reservations for the following train operators: Vy (Vygruppen AS), GAN (Go Ahead Nordic AS), and SJ (SJ Norge AS).\n\nSeat reservations are usually available up to 90 days in advance and are not compulsory in Norway. However, seat reservations are highly recommended where available. Popular trains to and from popular destinations tend to be full during holiday seasons (i.e. the Oslo–Bergen Line during summer).\n\nPayment\n\nWe only accept payment by card (Visa, MasterCard, and American Express). Payment is required when you book.\n\nTicket collection\n\nThe easiest way to get your travel documents and receipts is to choose a home print solution. You will receive an e-mail with details and an attached PDF including your travel documents. You can either show the digital documents on your smartphone or tablet, or print your tickets at home and bring them onboard to show the train manager (note: If you choose the home print option, your tickets will not be available for print at TVM’s).\n\nAs an alternative to home print tickets you can request to get your tickets printed at self-service ticket vending machines (TVM’s). You will receive an e-mail with details of your travel, the receipt of your purchase and a booking reference/Order ID that can be used at the TVM’s for pick up.\n\nTVM’s are available at many of the train stations in Norway. For more information and station details, please see Bane NOR for a list of stations in Norway. Manned train stations in Norway are Oslo S, Oslo Airport Gardermoen, Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger.\n\nGood to know:\n\nOn domestic day routes, there's no reservation fee for 1st class Pass Holders. However, 1st class Pass Holders need to have a seat reservation in upgraded compartments (Komfort, Pluss, Premium - depending on the train company). You can book this for free, but you must book locally.\n\nOn night trains there is no difference for 1st class or 2nd class.\n\nThe Komfort Night place is only offered on the Sørlandsbanen (Oslo–Kristiansand–Stavanger–Oslo) night train. It is available all nights except for Saturday night to Sunday morning and the fee is 230 NOK (approximately €25), which can only be booked in Norway."
