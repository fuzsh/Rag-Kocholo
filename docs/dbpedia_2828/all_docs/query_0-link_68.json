        "text": "Drammen is a city in Viken, previously Buskerud, 40 km (25 mi) southwest of Oslo. Drammen is where the Drammen river runs into the Drammensfjord, an arm of the Oslofjord. The part north of the river is called Bragernes, the part south of the river is called Strømsø. Drammen is promoted as \"the river city\". Drammen earlier had a reputation for being a grim industrial town. The city was also dubbed the biggest road intersection in Norway, due to the heavy traffic. Today the industry is gone or cleaned, and the traffic passes on highways outside the city. So Drammen today is a nice city, and a pleasant side-trip from Oslo. Or a destination of its own. The city has a long history as a centre for timber-trade and paper production. The paper mills however are closed today.\n\nDrammen was created in 1811 when the small towns Bragernes and Strømsø were officially merged into one town.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nFor more information on facilities at and around Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, see the Oslo Airport, Gardermoen article.\n\nEither Oslo Airport, Gardemoen (OSL IATA) or Sandefjord airport Torp (TRF IATA). They are both approximately one hour driving from Drammen. From Oslo Airport, Gardermoen there are several direct trains. There are 3 airport express trains per hour, these cost 250 kr one way and take exactly one hour. Then there's one InterCity and one regional train per hour, leaving the airport at 08 and 38 respectively, which take about 1 hr 15 min and cost 182 kr one way. There are also bus connections to Drammen from both airports.\n\nBy rail\n\n[edit]\n\nMost long-distance trains from Oslo travelling in the western and southern directions pass through Drammen. The following line passes Drammen: the Oslo-Skien line, the Oslo-Bergen line and the Oslo-Kongsberg-Kristiansand-Stavanger line. Drammen also has frequent local trains from Oslo. The railway station, is located at Strømsø Torg 1, across the river from the central square.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nE18 from Oslo, Larvik and Kristiansand. It is a 40-min drive from Oslo, depending on the traffic. E134 connects Drammen with Kongsberg. E134 continues to Notodden and Haugesund. Norwegian National road 23 leads through a sub sea tunnel from Drøbak at the east side of the Oslofjord.\n\nGo next\n\n[edit]\n\nBlåfarveværket in Åmot. An old mining industrial complex, made to museum and art galleries. The old mines are also open to the public. In the period 1770-1857 cobalt blue was manufactured here.\n\nDrøbak along Norwegian National Road 23 on the other side of the Oslofjord through a sub sea tunnel. Visit this picturesque, small town and the historical Oscarsborg fortress.\n\nKjøsterudjuvet\n\nTry gorge jumping at Kjøsterudjuvet The Kjøsterudjuvet is a 10,000-year-old gorge just ten minutes from downtown Drammen. This ravine in the mountain side is 1,300 metres long with a rise of 250 metres. The vertical walls are up to 60 metres high and the ravine is only 4 metres wide at its most narrow part. Contact arrcom.no.\n\nVisit a farm\n\nBring the children to one of the many open farms in the region. Here, they can go riding and play in the hay. At Sand Farm in Hurum they have hens, sheep, pigs, ducks, rabbits, turkeys, horses and cats. The farm also has a small café selling delicious cakes and bread.\n\nArena Vestfossen\n\nArena Vestfossen in Øvre Eiker gives room to several contemporary artists. Paintings, photos, installations, furniture, design, performances and other visual art. Studios and galleries with possibilities of direct sales.[dead link]\n\nHaugiani Glass/Maria og Magnus Hesslid\n\nAt Haugiani Glass in Øvre Eiker you can see the making of glass and buy goods directly from the artists’ own store. They accept all kinds of commissions, also hand engraving.
