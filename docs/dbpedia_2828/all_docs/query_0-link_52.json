        "text": "The new city bridge between Strømsø and Bragernes torg is Drammen municipality’s largest investment so far. The bridge crosses both Drammen station and the river Drammenselva and will have a total length of 262m. It will be the city’s main axis. Degree of Freedom is responsible for designing the bridge over the river whilst the bridge over the railway is being built under the supervision of Bane NOR.\n\nThe bridge crosses the river Drammenselva in three spans of 46, 86 and 42m. Above the station area, there are five shorter bridge spans with span lengths from 11 to 19.5m. The bridge deck is 19m wide and consists of two lanes for bus/taxi, and pedestrian and bicycle lanes on both sides with a width of 5m and 7m. The supporting structure over the river is formed of steel arches and steel beams with a composite concrete deck. In the river, the bridge is founded on steel piles to bedrock. Maximum depth to rock is 75-80m.\n\nAt Bragernes, a pier construction is to be built to connect with the bridge both upstream and downstream. Prior to the construction of the new bridge a temporary walkway and a bicycle bridge will be built. Degree of Freedom’s scope of work has included the detailed design of the foundations, piers and superstructure for this bridge over the river Drammenselva."
