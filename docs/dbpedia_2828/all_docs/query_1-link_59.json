The claim was spread worldwide and around 200 parent- and patient organisations, as well as medical societies and further supporting organisations, have joined forces to raise awareness for preterm birth and the benefits of Infant- and family-centred developmental care.\n\nPractices such as Kangaroo Mother Care and skin-to-skin contact from the very beginning of life of baby born preterm, have a tremendous effect on health outcomes and need to be promoted and supported in neonatal care.\n\nWe would like to thank the World Prematurity Day Coordinating Committee for their planning efforts and their contributions.\n\nAlso, we would like to thank each and everyone who has used their voice, their man- or woman power, to create awareness for preterm birth.\n\nYour effort means so much to preterm-born babies, their parents and families, and professionals in neonatal care.\n\nNIDCAP Federation International (NFI): In tribute to the families, nursery staff and hospitals that provide sensitive and nurturing care, the NFI shared its 2017 NFI World Prematurity Day Poster on which 47 nurseries around the globe are represented. For the third year in a row the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge in Boston, the birthplace of the NFI and headquarters to the National NIDCAP Training Center, will be illuminated in purple. In addition this year, Boston City Hall and the Kenneth F. Burns Memorial Bridge of Worcester/Shrewsbury will also be lit in purple to mark World Prematurity day.
