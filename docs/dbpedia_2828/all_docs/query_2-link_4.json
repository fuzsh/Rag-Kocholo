        "text": "This was sent in by Gene Estensen to share with our readers. Enjoy.\n\nHistorical Timeline – Norway to America\n\nOver the years I have collected some 90 books on emigration from Norway to America. From this collection I have developed this timeline. This is our Norwegian-American history. Enjoy! To set the stage, here is a quotation to ponder before you begin your reading:\n\nOle Rølvaag wrote in 1926 “It is vital in all cultural life to maintain a link between the present and the past. If there is anything that history makes clear it is this, that when a people becomes interested in its past life, seeks to acquire knowledge in or better to understand itself, it always experiences an awakening of new life”. See Blegen, Land of Their Choice, p. 596.\n\nGene Estensen\n\n500 B.C. – 800 A.D., The Iron Age. The Greek sea-captain Pytheas of Massilia wrote that the Scandinavians “live on oats and the like, namely greens, wild fruits and roots”. The Roman Empire was the economic and political center of power during the first four centuries A.D.\n\n400 AD – 800 AD, the farms of Dale, Såheim, and Bøen of Tinn, Telemark record signs of life during the pre-viking years. Artifacts have been preserved for us to enjoy.\n\n800-1100, The age of the Vikings. Voyages set off and reached as far east as the Russian plains, as far south as the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and Caspian Sea, as far north as the Barents Sea and as far west as America. The term Viking can be related to the Norwegian work vik meaning “bay” or “cove”. Many of those that had no farm to inherit chose to seek their fortunes as Vikings on voyages to foreign countries. They used a special variety of ship, the knarr, which was especially well-suited to the transport of goods. They worshiped Odin, the god of war. A Viking would far rather die an honourable death doing battle for his chieftain than die of old age in his own bed. The Vikings believed that if they were killed in battle, Odin would transport them to Valhalla, the heavenly kingdom of death. Here they would fight all day and in the evenings, beautiful maidens would serve them meats and mead. The god of thunder was called Thor. Eric Raude of Rogaland (Eric the Red) settled Greenland. His son, Leiv Ericsen, went to America about the year 1000. He wintered near the northern tip of Newfoundland. Harald Fairhair set about unifying Norway. Accompanied by his warriors, the hind, he travelled about the kingdom on veitsle, or journeys of state. Harald died about 930 and his son Håkon the Good inherited the kingdom. He built a great navy for defense. Olav Haraldsson, also of the Fairhair (Håfagr) line, took command until he was killed at the battle of Stiklestad on July 29, 1030. Norlie, The History of the Norwegian People in America, p. 36.\n\nNorsemen have left a deep and lasting imprint on Scotland – on the race, language, literature, art customs, beliefs. Norlie, The History of the Norwegian People in America, p. 40.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror was the great-grandson of Rolf Ganger, the Norwegian founder of Normandy.

Skard, Sigmund, The United States in Norwegian History, p. 3.\n\n1130-1217, The Civil War period. With the establishment of the archbiship at Nidaros in 1152, the Norwegian Church gained a strong leadership. Under Archbishop Østein (1161-1188), attempts were made to create a monarchy that could be controlled and influenced by the church.\n\n1217-1263, Haakon Haakonsson reigns over Norway’s era of greatness, including commerce and expansive territorial possessions.\n\n1349-1350, The Black Death takes a third of population of Norway. By 1400, half the population was gone. After 1350, the survivors were able to take over the best farms, leading to prosperity. It was 1500 before all the farms were reclaimed. Most of the land was farmed by free tenants who paid rent to the landowner in the form of corn, butter, furs, hides, and fish. A hired man on a Norwegian farm earned at most a cash salary of ten specie dollars a year, so that for a trip to America he had to save all of the cash he earned for several years, and he would be penniless when he arrived in the New World. Semmingsen, Norway to America, p. 54.\n\n“It was the boldest that set off first”, from Vilhelm Moberg. Semmingsen, Norway to America, p. 38.\n\n1500-1600, Norway’s population increased from 150,000 to 900,000 with 90% getting their livelihood from the land.

Approximately 2000 were tried and 500 put to death.\n\n1630-1674, About 60 Norwegians settled in the state of New York, mostly after service in the British or Dutch navy. Skard, Sigmund, The United States in Norwegian History, p. 9.\n\n1660, the absolute monarchy was established and to begin only 20% of the land was owned by peasants. By 1800 the majority of farm families lived on freehold land. Any farm with sufficient land was partitioned and a large lower class of husmenn (crofters) grew. Acrofter family was permitted to clear and rent land on a larger farm. Crofters and their families were not the only source of labor. Servants were common. In the mid-18th century, the king commanded that all unemployed people enter into annual service for a meager wage. These servants were usually young and single.\n\n1716-1718, The Great Northern War (1700-1721). King Karl XII of Sweden invaded Norway in 1716. The invasion was ended when he was shot at Halden and his troops withdrew.\n\n1717, the year the Tinn parish records go back to.\n\n1736, the introduction of confirmation meant that all children learned to read.\n\n1750, Around this time, a small group of Norwegian Herrnhutians settled at Bethlehem, Pa.

From this husmann class came a large percentage of the American immigrants.\n\n1801-1835, Population increase 37 % in Tinn, from 1,810 to 2,481. The potato infusion delayed the consequences of this rapid rise in population. Farms were divided between brothers and marginal land was cultivated higher on the mountain sides. The lower, or landless, classes grew the fastest. Before 1850, people were not driven out by poverty and hunger but by a hope for a better future and an improved social status. The early pioneers were people who had sufficient resources to finance their own move.\n\n1802, The number of farms in Norway was 79,256. By 1820 it was 93,621, then to 112,930 by 1845. By 1860 it was more than 135,000.\n\n1804, Elling Eielsen Syndve, later the famous lay preacher in America was born in Voss and this was the same year that Hauge was imprisoned in Norway for violation of the Conventicle Act.Anderson, Rasmus, Norwegian Immigration 1821-1840, p. 411.\n\n1807-1814, Economic hardship is endured by Norway.

Infantry soldiers served 10 years, horsemen 12 years, but except for the weekly drill after the sermon outside the church, the companies were only transferred to the front when the enemy attacked. According to law the soldiers, even the most humble cropper’s son, were always seated in the front of the church, at the head table at events, and generally being treated above their equals.\n\n1809, Ole Rynning is born at Ringsaker on April 4. He became a teacher at Snaasen. He would later publish an important book, in 1839, that led to emigration of thousands from Norway.

During the late winter of 1814 during the final months of the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was quite cordoned off from Denmark by the British and Swedes. The Norwegians organized a Constitutional Assembly that worked out a Constitution (Grunnlov) that was signed on May 17, beginning the return to independence after the country had been at first from 1397 in a union with Denmark and Sweden, then from 1533 a dependency of Denmark.\n\n1814, November, Norway enters into a union with Sweden but retains a sense of Nationalism. Now began a rapid raise in Norway’s population. Denmark was forced by the outcome of the Napoleonic wars to cede Norway to Sweden and was left in a bankrupt condition.

They had no money to pay for it but Mr. Fellows agreed to 10 annual payments. The land was heavily wooded and each male head of household purchased 40 acres. During the first two year, they suffered greatly as the land had to be cleared. They longed to be back in Norway but they had burned their bridges behind them. Twenty-four of them crammed into a newly built house that was 12 x 12. They passed the winter and soon they were earning a living helping their wealthy American neighbors by threshing out grain with a flail. They got every 11th bushel.

John Torsteinsen Rue eventually went west to seek gold. About the time he was ready to call it quits in California, he came across a job that the U. S. Government was having problems keeping filled. It involved carrying the mail across the High Sierras. To make a long story short, John Torsteinsen Rue carried the mail on skis for 26 winters and became the legend of the old west Snowshoe Thompson. Each trip was two days down the mountains, and three days back.

His house is the oldest in America, built by an immigrant from Norway. Anderson, Rasmus, Norwegian Immigration, p. 60.\n\n1836, The territory of Wisconsin was organized and in 1848 it became a state. Ole Nattestad (see below) became the first Norwegian settler in Wisconsin. He founded a settlement that became known as Jefferson Prairie, Rock County, Wisconsin Territory. It grew rapidly when his brother Anstein brought a party in 1839 aboard the Emilie, mostly from upper Telemark. This colony was also called the Luther Valley settlement. Many of these farmers owned gaards but were burdened with interest and other payments. Clausen, C. A., A Chronicler of Immigrant Life, p. 50.\n\n1836, Annual emigration begins. Knud Andersen Slogvig leads the first group on the Norden. Lovell, Odd, The Promise of America, p. 13. Mass emigration did not occur until the mid 1860’s. Two brigs, Den Norske Klippe (June 8) and Norden (May 25) sailed from Stavenger to New York with 167 people. Most went to the Fox River settlement. Some went to Kendall but moved on to Fox River within a few years. Blegen, Norwegian Migration to America, p. 72. See also Flom, Norwegian Immigration to the United States, p. 91.

During the age of Absolutism, the Dano-Norwegian kings, in accordance with the ideas of mercantilism, frequently granted monopolies to owners of foundries and sawmills to purchase timber from the Norwegian bonder in the surrounding areas. The Blairs, Cappelens, and the Løvenskiolds became wealthy merchants as well as owners of land. Certain aspects of this system lasted until 1860.\n\n1836, Ole and Anstein Nattestad, brothers, and peasants, from Veggli, Numedal, returned from a business venture to Rogaland Semmingsen, Norway to America, p. 26 and passed through Tinn on skis and stayed at the Lurås-Rue farm in the fall. In Tysvær, they had hear about America. The early settler Knud Slogvig had visited that community the previous year. Norwegian-American Studies, Vol. 29, p. 51. Some months later, on April 8, 1837, the Nattestad brothers visited the Lurås-Rue farm again on their way to America, heading westward toward Stavanger. Rønning, N. N. The Saga of old Muskego, p. 7. Thus, the locals heard about emigration to America and spoke enthusiastically about it to the people of Tinn. As a result, the so-called Rue party of 1837 left Skien on May 22 for Goteborg, then America with 59 people, mostly from Tinn. This was the first emigration from Eastern Norway. Blegen, Norwegian Migration to America, p. 87. Also, see the original Norwegian account of the Nattestad’s visit to Tinn in Tinn Soga, by Einung, p. 483. For a complete history of the Nattestad’s learning of America, see Flom, Norwegian Immigration to the United States, p. 102 or Clausen, C. A., A Chronicler of Immigrant Life, p. 50. On page 110 Flom speaks of Erick Gauteson MidBöen, Thore Kittilson Svimbil, and John Nelson Rue who had large families, and two single men Gunder Gauteson Midböen and Torsten Ingebrigtson Gulliksrud. These form the advance troupe of emigrants from the Parish of Tinn. John Nelson Rue became one of the founders of the earliest Norwegian settlement in Winneshiek County, Iowa. Clausen, C. A. A Chronicler of Immigrant Life, p. 12. Gunder Gauteson was a school teacher in Tinn and came over in 1837. He went to Fox River and worked as a day laborer before moving to Muskego. Clausen, C. A., A Chronicler of Immigrant Life, p. 22. Ole and Ansten Nattestad started their journey on April 8.

Norwegian-American Studies, Vol. 29, p. 76.\n\n1837-1843, Four-fifths of the emigration from Tinn in Telemark from 1837 to 1843 was family emigration. Semmingsen, Norway to America, p. 37. These people were not really poor. “It was the boldest that set off first”, from Vilhelm Moberg. Semmingsen, Norway to America, p. 38.\n\n1837, First to leave for America from Tinn, the Rue party. At Sandven at the shores of Lake Tinnsjø a crowd gathered on May 17. Fifty-nine from Tinn and Hovin were leaving. The minister and sheriff (lensmann H. A. Bernaas) made speeches. The emigrants wore old costumes, had trunks and supplies with them, and rowed down the river as family, left behind, waved. In the south end of Tinnsjø the emigrants had to walk through Gransherad and Heddal down to Lake Heddalsvatn. They by boats along Lake Heddalsvatn and thereafter Lake Norsjø they almost reached Skien. The last distance was made by foot. Five days after departure from Tinn the group embarked, went onboard the sailing vessel “Paketten” in Skien (May 22) with Ole Halvorsen as Captain. Norwegian-American Studies, Vol. 29, p. 53. The ship arrived at Gøteborg/Gothenburg, Sweden a few days later. The emigrants changed ships and left for New York with “Niord” about May 31. The ship arrived August 15 in New York after 10 weeks. From New York it was to Chicago(in early September) and the Fox River Settlement south-west of the City in Illinois. Most of them settled there, including Snowshoe Thompson. What happened on the shore of Sandven really was the beginning of a wave. The event was a sensation. Newspapers and magazines made articles. The authorities didn’t say much, but they did not discourage emigration. From a letter by Anfinn Bernaas.\n\n1837, John Nielsen Rue of Tinn leads the “Rue party” to America from Skien on May 22, Norwegian-American Studies, Vol. 29, p. 52. then Goteborg on May 31 to August 15, almost 11 weeks. Three ships sailed this year, the Enigheden, the Ægir captained by Behrens with eighty four passengers including Ole Rynning, and separately the Noord. Three families from Tinn and a couple of single men were on the Noord. Those from Tinn went directly to the Fox River settlement. Those on the Enigheden (Harmony, or Unity), captained by Jensen, started from Egesund, south of Stavanger, then to Stavagner, then to America with 93 passenger who join the Sloopers at the Fox River settlement, then two years later move to Muskego. Many of those on the Ægir (god of the sea) reached Chicago where they were warned by Bjørn Anderson from the Fox River Settlement that they would be ravaged by malaria if they went to Fox River. Their leader, Ole Rynning, was on the latter ship, arriving in June, and he took the bulk of the passengers to the ill-fated Beaver Creek settlement in Iroquois County, Illinois on the advice of some Americans. Ole died there a year later, apparently of dysentery, along with many others. Unmindful of his own suffering, he continued bravely to aid and comfort the settlers. On his sickbed in the winter of 37-38 he wrote a truthful and optimistic account of America. This account of 39 pages did more than anything else to stimulate the early immigration movement. The rest of the settlers fled to the Fox River settlement, arriving in the summer of 1838. The Beaver Creek settlement was abandoned by 1840. Flom, Norwegian Immigration to the United States, p. 85. Also see Semmingsen, Norway to America, p. 27.\n\n1837, Three families from Tinn were on the Noord. One was Erik Gauteson Midboen and settled at La Salle. A second was Thor Kittelson Svimbil who died at Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. The third was John Nielsen Rue who in 1869 was living on a farm at Winneshiek county, Iowa. Torstein Ingebrigtson Gulliksrud died in Illinois, was single. Also single, but an educated teacher, and probably a leader of the group was Gunder Gaueteson Midboen. He lived at Fox River from 1837 until 1842, and moved to Muskego where he prospered and has 200 acres of land in 1869. Anderson, Rasmus, Norwegian Immigration, p. 232.

Norwegian-American Studies, Vol. 29, p. 53. Some of them is said to be supplied with more than 800 Specie daler, and they have agreed among themselves that they will support each other with money and labour. They had also seen to that in the party there were carpenters, blacksmiths, etc. Two of these people intended to go back then next year together with 2 men from Numedal in order to tell their neighbors and family back home of their destiny and prospects for the future. If the prospects were favorable, one third of the people of Tinn and Numedal wished to emigrate the next year”.\n\n1837, The Aegir sailed from Bergen under Captain Behrens on July 4. Each adult paid 60 specie dollars. Flom, Norwegian Immigration to the United States, p. 100 and 224.\n\n1837, Snowshoe Thompson comes to America with his mother, Widow Rue.

Her parents and a sister named Margaret perished at Beaver Creek. Ellen became a Mormon. See story in Lovoll, Odd, The Promise of America, p. 92.\n\n1837, The local administrative unit of Kommune is now formed from the previous “herred” or herad (plural herader). The living conditions at Fox River had been unattractive and out of this disappointment grew an attempt to establish a settlement in Missouri. Cleng Peerson set out and instead of going north, he went southwest to Shelby County, Missouri. In 1837 he led a party of 12-15 to the settlement. It was short-lived, as their was distaste with a slave state, and the Wisconsin land was opening up.\n\n1837, Cleng Peerson founds a third settlement, in Shelby County, Missouri. It did not thrive and the settlers moved to Sugar Creek in Lee County, Iowa. Blegen, Norwegian Migration to America, p. 112.\n\n1837, there were some 200 public schools in Norway with an enrollment of 15,500 students.

Ole Knutson Nattestad from the ill-fated Beaver Creek Colony came to Rock County, Wisconsin and settled at Clinton on July 1, 1838 where a few American families had built homes. While Ole was exploring, Ansten went back to Norway and brought a group of settlers back to join Ole (see below). This became the important Jefferson Prairie Settlement.Blegen, Norwegian Migration to America, p. 114. Also see Anderson, Rasmus, Norwegian Immigration, p. 237. See page 238 for an interesting testimony of why they left Norway and how they heard about America and how he later became the first Norwegian to settle in Wisconsin.\n\n1838, Ansten Knutson Nattestad returns to Norway, from the Rue party, causing a great sensation. He was like a second Slogvig. He brought back the manuscript of Ole Rynning, of Tinn, that when it was published became the first of what became known as the “America Books”. It was titled “Sandfædig beretning om Amerika til oplysning og nytte for bonde og menigmand”, ie, True Account of America for the Enlightenment and Benefit of the Peasant and the Common Man. Ansten would bring a load of immigrants to America the following year. Twenty two years before the Civil War, speaking about slavery, Ole Rynning wrote “there will probably soon come either a separation between the northern and southern states or bloody civil conflicts”. Blegen, Norwegian Migration to America, p. 100-102 for a list of suggested items required on the passage to America. Ansten also brought back his brother Ole’s journal of 39 pages and published that. The two books were complimentary. See also Flom, Norwegian Immigration to the United States, p. 85 and 116. Also see Anderson, Rasmus, Norwegian Immigration, p. 215.\n\n1838, Ole K. Nattestad bought land and settled at Clinton, Rock County, Wisconsin. This settlement would be called Jefferson Prairie. He was the first Norwegian settler in Wisconsin.

Also Norlie, The History of the Norwegian People in America, p. 141.\n\n1838, Ole Rynning wrote that the Fox River Settlement is up to 16-20 families. He wrote that the “infamous slave traffic” would inevitably lead to a Civil War.

Skard, Sigmund, The United States in Norwegian History, p.35.\n\n1839, “Most of the first Norwegian settlers at Muskego came from Tinn, Telemark, in 1839. Tinn is one of the most secluded and mountainous districts in Norway, famed in song and saga for wild beauty and a sturdy people. There the majestic mountain Gausta towers in lonely grandeur above all the other mountains; there the river Rjukan plunges with deafening roar into a yawning abyss and rushes madly through a narrow gorge. During the short winter days, the sun cannot be seen at all by the people in the deep valleys, but during the long sunny summer days, flowers bloom in meadows and woodland, grain grows I the miniature fields, and birds pour out a flood of melody.” Rønning, N. N. The Saga of old Muskego, p. 7.\n\n1839, Wergeland wrote his poem “Famine”, a lament to the cold-hearted stars, which look down so smilingly on the bitter famine and suffering in Norway.

They were about 140 people and set sail on June 12 on the Emilie and arrived in New York on August 26. The “Emilie” carried its passengers to New York for 33 ½ specie dollars per person. Some took the brig “Bunian” for Boston. They took the usual route to the west, up the Hudson River, then by way of the Erie Canal to Buffalo, then through the Great Lakes to Chicago. Although Americans and Norwegians alike tried to get Ansten to lead the people to Muskego, most of these people followed Ansten to the area selected by his brother Ole at Rock County, Wisconsin, the Jefferson Prairie settlement. Two, however, Gullik Gravdal and Gisle S. Halland went on and founded the Rock Prairie (or Luther Valley) settlement at Rock Prairie.Blegen, Norwegian Migration to America, p. 119.

Johannes would go on to write the Muskego Manifesto. Soren would write a book about Muskego. They went to Muskego in the summer of 1840 from Fox River. The Muskego site seemed to Bache to be unfavorably located so he selected lands on the shores of Wind Lake in Norway Township. This led to most of the Muskego folks to move here. Soren returned to Norway in 1842, left again in 1843, returned once more in 1847 and settled in Lier parish where he died in 1890. Blegen, Norwegian Migration to America, p. 118.\n\n1839, the “America Letters, begin to flow with accounts of freedom and equality. There was no need to bow to officials and “betters” in this land. The letters became an indictment of Norwegian class distinctions but also told of toil and hardship. The letters were copied and sent from farm to farm and community to community. Many were reprinted in newspapers.\n\n1839, For a discussion of horrible things that could happen to the immigrants, like being eaten alive by Indians, see Clausen, C. A.

The Rynning book and letter from earlier emigrants motivated him. Also, Ansten Nattestad was leading a group to America this season. John married Anna Olsen Berge on April 8, 1839. By September 8 they were in America. Of the 40, half were from the Luraas families. These 40 left from Drammen with the sloop “Enighteten” on May 5, 1839, then from Goteborg aboard the “Clarissa Andrews” to Boston , sailing from June 1 to July 20. The immigrants went west by way of New York and Buffalo, and after a perilous voyage on the Great Lakes (a miserable journey, see Norlie, The History of the Norwegian People in America, p. 160) arrived in Milwaukee seventeen weeks after they left their native land. Their original plan was to go to the Fox River Settlement in Illinois. They were talked out of it by a couple of Americans and they went to Muskego instead. John Evenson Molee was one of seven children and he left Norway because of the Law of Primogeniture (odelsretten). Later in life John wrote that in 1835 the trades were overstocked. A laborer was not allowed to eat at the same table as the landowner. Labor commenced before sunrise and lasted until after dark. Most of these folks went to Muskego in Waukesha County and founded this settlement, the second settlement in Wisconsin. John Molee there married Anne Jacobsen Einong, sister of Gunhild. At the same time, Gunhild’s sister Aslaug married Hans Tveito. These were the first Norwegians at Muskego. See Luraas reasons for leaving on page 115 of Blegen.

The desire of cotters and cotters’ children to escape from their restricted life was not inspired purely by dissatisfaction with economic conditions. They were also motivated by a spirit of protest against the humiliating and oppressive social conventions of the traditional agrarian society. The cotters were looked down upon and treated as an inferior class and were often made to feel the sting of mockery and disrespect. There was something essentially degrading about a cotter’s contract. Norwegian-American Studies, Vol. 29, p. 81. However, every fifth wedding in Tinn crossed class boundaries. Norwegian-American Studies, Vol. 29, p. 82. From Tinn, it was the landowning class which furnished the largest contingent of emigrants between 1837 and 1907 – somewhat more than 40%.

Blegen, Norwegian Migration to America, p. 318.\n\n1845, “A convenient point at which to examine the rural population groupings is\n\nthe year 1845. The total population was then 1,328,471. There were 77,780 independent land holders, most of them presumably family heads. These freeholders made up the bonde element — perhaps the most powerful and influential element in the population of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Norway. The designation of peasants as applied to this class is misleading. Norway never had a feudal system, and the bønder had behind them ancient traditions not only of independence but also of vigorous self-assertion. These freeholders in fact constituted a rural aristocracy, which through centuries had been the very heart of the national culture. They were proud of their traditions, but their position carried with it no necessary implication of wealth. In truth, the economic position of the bønder has been difficult. Many, pressed to the wall by adverse conditions, have sold their ancient farms and emigrated to America. And in many other cases younger sons, barred by the practical workings of the odel system of land tenure from having a share in the ancestral estates, have sought their fortunes in the West. One result of the odel system has been the holding of estates through many generations by one line in direct descent. It is not uncommon in the Norwegian valleys to find farms that have remained in the possession of one family, handed down from father to son, generation after generation, since the fifteenth or sixteenth century. Some understanding of the feeling about land ownership bred by such traditions may be had by noting the view of a Norwegian immigrant who explains that all the sons in his father’s family, though only a few of them became farmers, insisted upon owning farm lands in America, “largely for reasons of sentiment, in harmony with the old conception of land ownership.” The essence of this conception was that “land possessed a certain dignity and worth, aside from its purely commercial value. It was the pride of the old chieftains; it insured economic well-being and personal independence; it gave stability and permanence to the family in whose possession it remained from century to century.” It is not to be wondered at that the bondestand made itself a power in the affairs of modern Norway. After the establishment of constitutional government in that country in 1814, the bønder, becoming increasingly class-conscious, entered upon a protracted but successful contest with the privileged official class and the clergy for leadership in the state. The “rural population,” as Hardy says, “survived centuries of foreign domination, until in the nineteenth century it came once more into its own as the heart and kernel of Norwegian democracy.” Various aspects and implications of the battle of the bønder are considered in later chapters of the present work; it remains to be noted here that from the bondestand have come a large number of the political leaders, writers, poets, musicians, and professional men of modern Norway; and that the same class has contributed liberally, in various fields, to leadership among the Norwegians transplanted to America. The rural population of Norway in 1845 included, in addition to the bønder, 58,049 husmænd, 25,047 renters, 47,000 laborers, and 146,000 servants. The husmænd and laborers, mainly family heads, have been estimated to represent elements of respectively 300,000 and 230,000 people. {11} Most interesting of these classes from the point of view of\n\nemigration were the husmænd, or cotters. These people, most of whom were to be found in the eastern parts of Norway, ordinarily leased small pieces of land to work for themselves, and were required, usually under written contracts, to give a specified amount of service to their landlords, the bønder. Small lots of land, with cottages and other buildings, usually some distance behind the central buildings of the gaard, were reserved for the use of husmænd. It is clear that heavy demands were made upon the cotters. In 1850 they were asking that their required services be restricted to five days a week and the working day to eleven hours. One writer states that practically the only free time the husmænd had for work on their own plots of ground was on Sundays. The value of services beyond the stipulated arrangements might be placed as high as twelve pennies a day in summer, less than half that in winter. Professor Koht writes that the husmænd were personally free — that is, they were not bound to the soil — but that in effect they were economic serfs. “It was only on rare occasions,” he continues, “that any of them were able to win their way out of poverty.” {12} Hardy characterizes the husmand historically as the liberated thrall. {13} Both [8] politically\n\nand socially the class was on a lower plane than that of the bonde. It lacked the suffrage, since its members could not meet the property qualification. The husmænd were on the increase in the period when the emigration movement was rising, an increase that went from 48,571 in 1825 to 65,060 in 1855, the latter being the highest point in the history of the class. In a later chapter the movement for reform with reference to the cotters and its connections with emigration are considered in some\n\ndetail. Poverty coupled with stern demands upon the time and service of the cotters tended in many cases to embitter their attitude toward the bønder, whose relationship to the lesser class had had a patriarchal flavor in an earlier day. A considerable number of pensioners, who had surrendered their property to their heirs upon condition of receiving annual allowances and living quarters, are represented in the population of 1845 — 46,512 of them. {15} The dower house, it may be added, is a familiar feature in the usual cluster of buildings at the center of a Norwegian gaard. Samuel Laing in his journal from the thirties prints a translation of an advertisement in a Christiania newspaper offering a Norwegian gaard for sale at a price of four thousand dollars. This presents some interesting concrete detail concerning buildings, equipment, and other aspects of a typical gaard:\n\nA two-story dwelling-house, with seven apartments, of which two are painted. A large kitchen, hall and room for hanging clothes, and two cellars. There is a side building of one story, containing servants’ room, brewing kitchen, calender room, chaise-house, and wood-house. A two-story house on pillars with a pantry, and a store-room. The farm buildings consist of a threshing barn, and barns for hay, straw, and chaff; a stable for five horses; a cattle house for eight cows, with divisions for calves and sheep. There is a good kitchen garden, and a good fishery; and also a considerable wood, supplying timber for house-building, for fences, and for fuel, besides the right of cutting wood in the common forest. The scater (sæter) or hill pasture is only half a mile (that is, three and a half English miles) from the farm. The arable land extends to the sowing of eight barrels of grain and twenty-five or thirty of potatoes (the barrel is half a quarter), besides the land for hay; and the farm can keep within itself, summer and winter, two horses, eight cows, and forty sheep and goats. There is also a houseman’s farm and houses. It keeps two cows, six sheep, and has arable land to the sowing of one and a half barrels of grain and six barrels of potatoes. The property adjoins a good high road, is within four miles (eight and twenty English miles) of Christiania.

Cholera followed the emigrants to settlements like Muskego, Fox River, and Koshkonong. At Muskego, John Evenson Molee reported the “awfullest summer that I have ever experienced in my life. Three or four persons died every day”. “Hans Tveito and myself had all we could do to carry the dead out of the houses and haul them to the grave with our oxen, while other dug the graves”. At Koshkonong a carpenter who was employed to build cofins for the cholera victims in the settlement was unable to supply the demand. In order that he should not be exposed to the disease, his neighbors pushed boards through the window into his shop and the coffins were delivered through the same window.
