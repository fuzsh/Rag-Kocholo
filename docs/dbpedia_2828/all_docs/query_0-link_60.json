        "text": "At Oslo S (Oslo Sentral) train station, the impressively cavernous departure hall in the main station building contributes to an airport-like atmosphere.\n\nAnother aspect of the station that resembles an airport is the multiple levels within the station building.\n\nThe departure concourse (main station building) sits above the trains and the station is also on an upper level to some of its surrounding streets.\n\nThe transit between trains and street can therefore involve multiple changes of level, though escalators and lifts are always available, as alternatives to the stairs.\n\nThe Flytoget airport train services have a separate concourse, at a lower level, to the south side of the main concourse.\n\nThe main information desk at Oslo S is also located on this south side concourse; and this concourse also houses multiple food/drink outlets and shops.\n\nAt Oslo S railway station there will only main exit from the spor/track/platform that your train will have arrived at.\n\nIf your train has arrived from Goteborg, Trondheim or Lillehammer, then this exit will be at the front of the train.\n\nIf your train has come from Bergen or Stavanger, it will be at the rear.\n\nYou will have to ascend to an upper level to exit the spor/track/platform, but there are either escalators OR moving walkways available; depending on which platform/track your train has arrived at.\n\nThe moving walkways only give access to the main concourse, but the escalators ALSO give access to multiple exits; including a short cut to the south side exit.\n\nHeading directly to this south sideÂ exits from those escalators* is a good option, if:\n\n(1)Â you will be walking to a final destination thatâs to the south of the station, or,\n\n(2)Â your hotel is in the area around Prinsens Gate.\n\nTo access this South Side exit don't use the second escalator that you'll come to, instead go left.\n\nThere is an exit from this level on to the square (the Chr. Frederiks Plass) that is to the south side of Oslo S station\n\n*This short cut isn't available from the platforms that are linked to the concourse by moving walkways.\n\nAscend into the main station building if you will be:\n\ntransferring to the metro,\n\nexiting by the main entrance,\n\nheading to accommodation to the north of the station, or\n\nwill be transferring to the bus station.\n\nThe main entrance to the Metro is to the right of the main concourse and opposite it is a supermarket.\n\nIf youâre on a budget then stocking up on food/drink here to take to your hotel/hostel is a good option.\n\nWhen planning a trip, finding convenient accommodation can be trickier than working out which train to take.\n\nHence ShowMeTheJourney has partnered with the innovative accommodation portal, Stay 22, to offer three options for discovering your optimum accommodation:\n\n1: Use the map above to see which hotel rooms and Vrbo rentals, with easy access to Oslo-S station, are available.\n\n2: Or click on these cherry-picked properties, offered by Stay 22 partner Bookings. com, which are by Oslo-S station and have been selected on the basis of high guest ratings:\n\nComfort Hotel Xpress Central Station\n\nClarion Hotel The Hub\n\nScandic Byporten\n\nScandic Oslo City\n\nCitybox Oslo\n\n3: Or see what's available with Stay 22's accommodation partners; which include, Expedia, Hotels. com and Trivago - by clicking here.\n\nStay 22 will 'shuffle' the booking services so that you can be automatically directed to its partner that currently has the optimum availability at this location.\n\nTry not to arrive too early for your train, aside from the food/drink outlets, Oslo S has few areas in which to sit and wait for a departure.\n\nHead to the main concourse and keep an eye on the departure board, or if youâre in a cafe/snack bar, sit where you can see the departure monitors.\n\nTrains are listed on the departure screens in order of departure, but the spor/track/platform that the long distance 'Regiontog' trains will be departing from, wonât be confirmed until the train is ready for boarding; around 15 mins before departure.\n\nYou can then descend to the appropriate spor/track/platform by escalator or moving walkway.\n\nIf youâre taking a long distance (Regiontog) train, when you arrive on the spor/platform, the train conductor will be waiting and can answer any questions, and direct you to the coaches in which any reservations are located.\n\nNationaltheatret station is located at the opposite end to of the city centre to Oslo S, so it's on its western edge.\n\nIt's the closest station to The National Gallery of Oslo.\n\nIf you're heading into Oslo from the north and east and your train terminates at Oslo S, then the best option for accessing Nationaltheatret is to transfer to the frequent local trains on from Oslo Sentral.\n\nDo this and it will save you the bother of having to transfer and descend to the Metro at Oslo S.\n\nThough the express trains from Bergen and Stavanger pass through Nationaltheatret station and donât call there.\n\nSo, if youâre heading to the area around Nationaltheatret to/from these locations, the easiest and fastest journey is to change trains at Drammen station.\n\nAll of the Metro T-Bahnen trains heading west from Oslo S station make their first call at Stortinget station.\n\nThis station is closer to the heart of the city, by the National Parliament Building, than any tram stop.\n\nIt may seem an indulgence to take the Metro for a one-stop hop, it's a 12-20 min walk to the parliament building along the street named Karl Johans Gate - but if you're arriving in the city for the first time, then taking the Metro is the less confusing option.\n\nAlso worth knowing is that the metro station at Oslo S station is named 'Jernbanestorget'\n\nIn contrast to taking the Flytoget trains, the regular trains are:\n\nSlightly less frequent = they depart no more than 3 x times per hour\n\nAll trains call at Olso S station and Nationaltheatret station\n\nThey're only 5 mins slower, the journey time between Oslo S and Oslo Lufthavn by these trains = 24 minutes\n\nWhen travelling from Oslo look for trains that are calling at Oslo Lufthavn, but are terminating (usually) at Eidsvoll or Lillehammer.\n\nThe Vy trains are generally busier than the Fltytoget trains, particularly the trains heading to/from Lillehammer.\n\nSo seats aren't guaranteed, particularly when heading to the airport on Monday - Saturday between 16:00 and 18:00\n\nHowever, tickets are generally (much) cheaper, also rail passes are not valid on the Flytoget trains, but they are valid on these alternative trains.\n\nThere are also direct Vy trains between Oslo Lufthavn and Trondheim."
