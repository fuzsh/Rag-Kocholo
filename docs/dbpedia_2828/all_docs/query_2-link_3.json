        "text": "Preparing for progress\n\nFor thousands of years, the Norwegians relied on boats, horses, reindeer, and their own two feet to transport both goods and people through a spectacular and challenging landscape.\n\nWith its mountains, fjords, valleys, waterways, and forests, Norway was never the easiest country to travel through.\n\nAfter the creation of the modern-day Norwegian national state in 1814 – now in a union with Sweden after having been under the Danish crown for centuries – the Norwegians set out to adopt the more advanced ways of their European neighbours further south.\n\nTo fully make use of what the country had on offer – especially its inland resources – something important was missing: comprehensive and efficient inland transportation systems.\n\nIt all started with the industrial revolution\n\nThe industrial revolution started in the United Kingdom in the 1700s, and spread in waves across the European continent, and to other parts of the world.\n\nIt brought with it factories and cities – increasingly also in inland locations – and transformed the rural communities.\n\nThe scale of this momentous change could not have happened, had it not been for the invention of the railway. The steam locomotives and their carriages pulled heavy loads – and ran at an exceptional speed. Society was changed forever.\n\nHelp from England\n\nWhen the Norwegians started planning their first railway initiatives, they looked to England, which had the best railway engineers of the day.\n\nIn the UK, the first public railway-line was the Stockton & Darlington Railway in northern England, which opened in 1825.\n\nIn the 1840s, Robert Stephenson – son of George Stephenson, by many deemed to be the father of the railway – came to Norway to inspect and give advice.\n\nA nation with limited means\n\nThe Norwegian state was a driver and large stakeholder from the very beginning. Together with industrialists, merchants, and local enthusiasts, the authorities looked into how they could both finance and realise the first Norwegian railway project.\n\nThe public coffers were limited, but the country’s leaders realised early on that the railway was much more than just a regular financial investment.\n\nLocal prosperity\n\nThe early Norwegian railway-projects aimed at improving access to the inland regions – and thus improving the transportation of natural resources and goods to the coastal ports for export – mainly timber and agricultural produce.\n\nAnd – more importantly – a lot more of the processing of the natural resources – and thus the wealth creation – could now happen locally, for example, in sawmills or other types of factories. Prosperity – quite literally – followed the railway’s tracks.\n\nThe Oslo to Eidsvoll Line was the first\n\nIn 1851, the British engineering company Ricardo, Peto & Brassey started the work on Norway’s first railway line: the Oslo-Eidsvoll Line.\n\nThe British investors called it the Norwegian Trunk Railway. It was 68 kilometres long – and opened on 1 September 1854.\n\nThe Oslo-Eidsvoll Line was owned by a Norwegian-British consortium, where the Norwegian state owned 50%.\n\nThe end-station at Eidsvoll was located right on the banks of the river Vorma, which leads to Norway’s largest lake, Mjøsa. The areas surrounding lake Mjøsa is both forest- and crop-rich.\n\nFrom Eidsvoll, passengers and goods continued on steamboats, as far north as to the town of Lillehammer – and vice versa.\n\nThe trip between Oslo and Eidsvoll took 2.5 hours. Already in its first year, the Oslo-Eidsvoll Line carried 128,000 passengers, and 83,000 tons of timber.\n\nRailway-workers’ benefits\n\nAt one time, 1,400 employees were taking part in the construction of the Oslo-Eidsvoll Line.\n\nTo attract the best and most dependable workforce, the workers were paid above the average – and enjoyed sickness benefits. The project also had its own doctor.\n\nThe projects that followed\n\nAfter the completion of the Oslo-Eidsvoll Line, four more projects followed in this first pioneer period. All lines connected forest-rich areas and crop-rich agricultural land to coastal ports.\n\nHamar to Grundset\n\nThe town of Hamar is halfway up the Lake Mjøsa, and north of Eidsvoll. This stretch of railway went northeast from Hamar, connecting Lake Mjøsa to Norway’s largest river, Glomma. The line opened in 1862 and was 38 kilometres long.\n\nThe river Glomma transported substantial amounts of timber from lakes and water-systems further north. With the Hamar-Grundset Line, the Glomma got a connection to the capital Oslo; via the steamships on Lake Mjøsa and the Oslo-Eidsvoll Line.\n\nLillestrøm to Kongsvinger – The Swedish border\n\nThis was a branch and add-on to the Oslo-Eidsvoll Line. It left off at the town of Lillestrøm, and went northeast to the town of Kongsvinger, and towards the Swedish border. The first stretch of the line, to Kongsvinger, was completed in 1862 – and it reached the border in 1865.\n\nA full connection between Oslo and the Swedish capital Stockholm was established in 1871.\n\nTrondheim to Støren\n\nThis was the first railway line in Norway’s mid-region Trøndelag. It opened in 1864 and was 49 kilometres long. Trondheim was a hub in this region – and was also a port.\n\nDrammen to Randsfjorden\n\nThe Drammen-Randsfjorden railway opened in 1868 and was 53 kilometres long. It connected the waterways and forest-rich regions north-west of the Oslofjord with the port town of Drammen.\n\nTrack width\n\nThe Oslo-Eidsvoll Line, and the connecting Lillestrøm-Kongsvinger Line, were both made with the track-width used in the UK and elsewhere in Europe – 1,435 mm.\n\nTo save money, the Trondheim-Støren, Hamar-Grundset, and Drammen-Randsfjorden lines only had a track-width of 1,067 mm (narrow-gauge railways).\n\nHaving two different railway systems was not a very forward-thinking choice, and eventually, all Norwegian railways were given the 1,435 mm width.\n\nThe early railway tracks were different\n\nThe first railway track metal bars were attached on top of wooden trunks – that ran in the same direction as the tracks. See the illustration below.\n\nThese wooden trunks were supported by connections across – but were much less stable than the more robust crossing sleepers that we know today.\n\nThe Norwegian Railway Museum\n\nThe Norwegian Railway Museum can be found in the town of Hamar. It was first established in 1896 by former railway workers and enthusiasts, making it one of the oldest railway museums in the world.\n\nIt started with a modest collection of photographs, illustrations, and technical drawings.\n\nToday, the museum offers exhibition halls, an open-air park with tracks, signals, and authentically furnished station buildings, and offers a short journey with a narrow-gauge steam train.\n\nSource: Hansen, Trond Børrehaug – Gundersen.
