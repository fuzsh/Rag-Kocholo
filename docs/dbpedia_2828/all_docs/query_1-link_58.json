        "text": "CASE STUDY: Eighteen months before construction started on the new Sydney Metro Crows Nest Station, Marr’s team was approached by the end-client, Sydney Metro, during the front-end design phase to develop a craneage methodology for the project. Leveraging Marr’s experience in successfully delivering on a number of other Sydney Metro station projects where similar approaches to cut-and-cover method of station box construction had been employed, the goal was to align the cranage solution to Sydney Metro’s preferred precast and modular construction methodology. Construction of the new station came with a number of challenges including: - a constrained site with limited space for positioning the cranes & delivery of materials & equipment; - it's location adjacent to one of Sydney’s busiest arterial roads & a built-up retail, commercial and residential precinct; - heavy lifting requirements (up to 120T); and - the construction schedule driven by where this project sat within the overall delivery schedule for the Sydney Metro City & Southwest project. As a result of the solution developed – using two #M2480D installed within the station box - Sydney Metro issued a considered and evaluated design for the construction tenderers with a suitable cranage solution built into it. Marr was subsequently awarded the heavy lifting contract by A W Edwards. “Our early engagement on this project supported Sydney Metro’s desire to adopt a designed for Manufacture & Assembly (#DFMA) approach. Then it was about aligning the cranage to that approach & using it to help secure the programme with a safer, more effective & cost-efficient solution,” said our Managing Director, Simon Marr.

The prospect of Toronto taking on housing construction is daunting because, based on past experiences, it is likely to be over budget and not completed on time. The city and provincial governments should step aside and allow private companies to handle these projects, as they are adept at meeting demand, staying on schedule, and within budget. The Gardiner Expressway project is particularly concerning because it means the city will be without a major roadway for the next 5-10 years.\n\nThe 5 years preceding 2021, the City averaged approximately $1.3 billion in construction value per year (from 2016-2020). We are actually witnessing a huge increase in the overall annual average value since 2021 until now at $2.04 billion. The City has been beating its own records for the last 3 years and we continue to see growth.\n\nAlthough there is currently a slowdown of residential and commercial projects in Metro Vancouver due to market conditions, the same cannot be said for the coming wave of shovels that will hit the ground for major and unique civic and transportation infrastructure, and cultural and tourism attractions, reported Daily Hive. And of course, this is already on top of everything that is under construction, with 2024 also expected to see a major wave of completions. Everything from a major outdoor concert venue to a significant SkyTrain extension, in no particular order of importance, here are nine notable developments and infrastructure projects that will begin major construction work in 2024.\" https://lnkd.in/gc-nCF8A\n\nGood to see roads going below ground. Major roads devalue adjacent property, spread noise and air pollution and divide communities. Spaghetti junctions only look good from a helicopter, not at human scale. Sydney remains divided by filthy road spaghetti between the city and its beautiful harbour. Hopefully this is one more piece to rehumanising the over engineered metropolis which is just starting to rebirth its soul with its new tram. When I first worked on West Connex some \"advisors\" had the government gunning to a massive 8 lane \"slot\". We had to simulate it to demonstrate it was the ugliest most ill conceived nightmare ever. We planned and demonstrated that sub surface is the right place for this infrastructure, with directed controllable air filtration. Awesome to see it live. Remember Sydney had the largest tram network in the world ripped out thanks to traffic and civil engineering consultants advice. Was just in Sydney and so wonderful to see that new tram in place - thanks to quality urban design advice. And Parramatta Light Rail coming soon. More of this thinking, TfNSW."
