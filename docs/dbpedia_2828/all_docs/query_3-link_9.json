        "text": "The public transportation system in Oslo, operated by Ruters, is moderately accessible, but its use will require some planning for disabled travelers, particularly those in wheelchairs. The city’s metro train system is accessible at all stations with the exception of one. All city buses offer step-free access, but the on-street trams do not. Most public ferries are wheelchair accessible.\n\nFlytoget Airport Express Train\n\nThe Flytoget, or Airport Express, is a 210 km/h high speed train which connects Oslo Gardermoen Airport (OSL) with non-stop service to Oslo Central Station. The journey takes 19 minutes. An alternate Flytoget service is available which offers stops at Lillestrøm, Oslo Central, Nationaltheatret, Skøyen, Lysaker, Sandvika, Asker, and Drammen stations.\n\nThe Flytoget trains and stations are fully accessible to wheelchairs. Train cars have built-in wheelchair ramps that can be extended by a train conductor. Consult a station attendant for help flagging down a conductor for assistance.\n\nFares range from 140 to 260 NOK, based upon the destination or point of embarkation. Fares to Oslo Central Station and the Lillestrøm, Nationaltheatret, Skøyen and Lysaker stations are 180 NOK, or about $22 USD. Fares can be paid with cash or any major credit card at the automated ticketing machines at each station.\n\nThe Flytoget departs from Gardermoen Airport every 10 minutes from the station connected to the terminal. The station is approximately 200 feet to the right of the Arrivals Hall. For more information on the Airport Express, visit flytoget.no.\n\nMetro Train/Subway\n\nThe Oslo Metro system is accessible to wheelchairs at all but one station, Frøen. Each station has at least one barrier free entrance. The height of most station platforms is equal to that of train cars, allowing for wheelchair users to easily roll-on/roll-off Metro trains. A lip or rise of up to three inches is present at some stations. The gap between the train and platform is minimal at all stations and will not present trouble for users of either powered or manual wheelchairs. Each train has space for wheelchairs and priority seating for seniors and those with disabilities.\n\nThe metro system features six individual lines, numbered 1 through 6. All six lines stop and offer transfer ability at the downtown stations of Grønland, Jernbanetorget, Majorstuen, Nationaltheatret, Stortinget, and Tøyen. Jernbanetorget station is connected to the Oslo Senstralstasjon (Central Station), which is the city’s primary train depot a stop for the Flytoget Airport Express train. The Flytoget also stops at Nationaltheatret station, another connection point to all six lines of the Metro.\n\nCity Bus System\n\nOslo is served by an increasingly modern city bus system with more than 350 routes/lines. The city bus fleet is being updated. All city buses now have lowered floors and are wheelchair accessible. The door at the center of the bus is equipped with a manual ramp which the bus operator will extend for wheelchair users. Wheelchair accessible buses are equipped with two securement spaces for wheelchairs with tie downs/straps. Priority reserved seating is available for seniors and persons with disabilities.\n\nAll wheelchair accessible buses are marked with the international symbol of access (the wheelchair icon) at the rear door on standard buses and at the center door on articulated buses. Wheelchair entry is possible only through the rear or center door, where the retractable or fold out ramp is located.\n\nNSB Train System\n\nNorwegian State Railways, NSB, operates an extensive rail network throughout the entire country of Norway. All trains are wheelchair accessible via lifts, ramps or elevators, with newer trains featuring a greater level of accommodation for disabled passengers. All NSB trains have wheelchair securement areas with tie downs/straps, as well as accessible restroom facilities on board. Spaces for wheelchairs meet international standards and powered wheelchairs are permitted on NSB trains. For more information on disabled accommodation, visit nsb.no.\n\nNSB trains depart regularly from Oslo Central Station to other parts of the country. For tourists, one of the most popular train rides is from Oslo to Bergen. The train passes across the country, climbing mountains and passing beautiful sights through all seasons. The terminus is Bergen, the “gateway to the fjords.” This train ride has been rated as one of the best in the world by Lonely Planet. A short, 2-minute video clip released by NSB is provided below and showcases the Oslo to Bergen route.\n\nFor more information on the train ride to Bergen, read Visit Norway’s article, “Hop on one of the world’s best train rides.” All trains used on the Oslo to Bergen route are wheelchair accessible.\n\nFerries and Express Boats\n\nFerries transport passengers and vehicles to the islands on the Oslo Fjord and surrounding the Norwegian Coastline. Ferries are operated by private companies, but many are a part of Oslo’s public transportation network managed by Ruters. The ferries operated by Marine-Service can be paid for using standard price public transportation Ruters tickets and passes. The eligible ferry routes are listed below:\n\nLine 92: to Hovedøya, Lindøya vest, Nakholmen (all year)\n\nLine 93: to Bleikøya, Gressholmen, Lindøya øst, Hovedøya (all year)\n\nLine 94: to Langøyene (summer only)\n\nThese ferries depart Oslo from Rådhusbrygge 4. This dock is a less than 10 minute walk from the Nationaltheatret Metro station, which is served by all six lines of the subway. It is only a 20 minute walk/roll from Oslo Central Station. Either path is very walkable/rollable and passes through beautiful parts of the city.\n\nTickets should be purchased for both directions prior to departure, as they are not sold on the destination islands. Unlimited use passes and the Oslo Pass permit use of the ferries. Additional information on the ferries is available at oslo-fergene.no. The majority of public ferries in Oslo are wheelchair accessible. Visit a Ruters service desk at Oslo Gardermoen Airport or at the Oslo Central Station for additional information. Express boats with lower and upper deck will only be accessible on the lower deck.\n\nFares, route maps and schedules\n\nFares on the Oslo Metro train and city bus are based upon the number of zones traveled through. There are a total of 5 zones covering Oslo and Akershus. The Metro train system is based entirely within zone 1, which covers the central areas of Oslo. Tickets are sold for single journeys and passes are available for 24 hours and 7 days. The following is a list of prices for these ticketing options:\n\nSingle Journey: 1 zone, 30 NOK; 2 zones, 50 NOK; 3 zones, 70 NOK; 4 zones, 90 NOK; All zones, 110 NOK\n\n24 hour pass: 1 zone, 90 NOK; 2 zones, 140 NOK; All zones, 190 NOK\n\n7 days pass: 1 zone, 240 NOK; 2 zones, 440 NOK; All zones, 640 NOK\n\nPurchase of a ticket on board the bus carries an additional service charge of 20 NOK. 24 hour and 7 day passes permit access to all 5 zones for the 3 zone price. Note that travel on the Flytoget Airport Express and NSB trains is not included with these passes.\n\nTickets and passes may be purchased via automated kiosks at Metro stations, or may be added to a reloadable, prepaid Ruter’s Travelcard. The travelcard is a plastic card which stores tickets and passes electronically. Travelcards allow you to avoid the 20 NOK service charge which is added to bus fares. These cards may be purchased at train stations, Ruter’s service centers, 7-11 convenience stores and at staffed bus terminals. More information on the travelcard is available at ruter.no.\n\nThe Oslo Pass offers tourists an opportunity to bundle unlimited access to public transportation and admission to more than 30 local museums and attractions at a discounted rate. The value of the Oslo Pass is unique to the individual and depends on how often you will utilize public transportation and which of the included attractions you will visit. The Oslo Pass can be purchased at Gardermoen Airport, the Tourist Information Center at Central Station and numerous other locations, listed at visitoslo.com. The cost of the Oslo Pass is as follows:\n\n24 hours, zones 1, 2V, 2S and 2Ø: 320 NOK\n\n48 hours, zones 1, 2V, 2S and 2Ø: 470 NOK\n\n72 hours, zones 1, 2V, 2S and 2Ø: 590 NOK\n\nRoute maps, schedules and more regarding the public transportation system in Oslo are available via the links below:"
