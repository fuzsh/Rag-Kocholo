        "text": "Drammen has in recent years been transformed into a buzzing culture hub. Explore street art and cool venues in the Papirbredden neighbourhood, home to Gateway Studios and the renowned Ypsilon bridge by the Elvepromenaden river walk, where you will also find beaches and tasty eateries.\n\nThe cities greatest hidden gem is actually underground. The dramatic tunnel named Spiralen, 'the spiral', is considered one of the top ten greatest tunnels in the world. Drive in circles, six times around your own axis! There are some great hikes at the top.\n\nDrammen is the second largest city in Eastern Norway and can be easily reached by train from most places. Heavy industry and timber have played important roles in its history.\n\nHistoric buildings have been transformed and are now centres for art and culture, including Drammens Museum, Union Scene, Drammens Theater and the historic 18th century manor house Gulskogen Gård.\n\nArt lovers should follow the Drammen river north to the renowned art centre Blaafarveværket, where you also can visit the old cobalt mines, and see cutting edge contemporary art at Vestfossen Kunstlaboratorium.\n\nIt is also highly recommended to head south along the Drammensfjord and explore coastal gems like cosy Holmsbu and Rødtangen (nice beaches!), before taking Norway’s shortest ferry ride from Klokkarstua to Svelvik and its traditional white-painted houses. Stop by fruit farms and the Fossekleiva kultursenter culture centre along the way.\n\nThe hills above Drammen are a popular skiing and hiking area. You can also go alpine skiing in Strømsø or Åssiden.\n\nFun fact: Did you know that Drammen is known as Norway's warmest city?\n\nGet in-depth travel information on Drammen's official website."
