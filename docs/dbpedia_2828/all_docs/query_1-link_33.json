From new neighborhoods and cutting-edge food, to fashion and art scenes, Norway’s capital has something for everyone. Captivating landmarks like the Opera House, the Astrup Fearnley Museum and Barcode are changing the face of the city. Although an ever-changing city, Oslo continues to maintain its refreshing closeness to nature, something that very few capitals can do. The city was even named European Green Capital 2019 for its dedication to conserving natural areas and reducing pollution. The restaurant scene is diverse, and many of the new, innovative kitchens offer a fresh approach to Norway’s traditional dishes. With an efficient public transport system, compact city center, and safe environment, Oslo is easy to navigate without a car.
