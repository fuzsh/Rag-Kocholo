A very definite perception of the responsibilities of the proprietor is required to qualify, with the relating of history forming the setting for the guests’ own overnight stay and gastronomic experience. Our aim is to use the past as a backdrop for our guests, to enable them to create their own history based on experiences. It is our hope that these narrations may continue to live in the memories of our guests long after their return home."
