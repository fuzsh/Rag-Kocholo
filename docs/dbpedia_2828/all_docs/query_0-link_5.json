        "text": "The export of timber and lumber\n\nThe fjords in Drammen became the main vain for export of timber and lumber. By the middel of the 18th century, the port exported twice as much as other ports, including the capital Christiania´s port.\n\nIn 1730 the port got analyzed and evaluated. During this work, on organized port authority gained fertile ground.\n\nIn 1750 the customs house burned to the ground. The following year a new customs house of 1400 square meter was built. It contained an office building, a warehouse and housing for the customs officer and his family.\n\nWhen the government took over the customs collection in 1777, the building was extended again for office purposes.\n\nAn important century for the port\n\nThe first half of the 19th century, Drammen city was imprinted with city fires. The two last fires was in July 11. and 12. in 1866.\n\nA lot of properties was burned to the ground, and affected a blooming industry of steam power.\n\nIt was time to rethink and rebuild.\n\nIn 1867 Landfall bridge was built.\n\nIn 1868 the train station opened along with a train harbor.\n\nIn 1872 the railway bridge was completed.\n\nIn 1878 a new customs building was ready.\n\nIn 1889 the icebreaker and towing boat D/S Thor was launched. With this boat, the business on the port could go on all year.\n\nAt the end of the 1800s, paper factories was established along the river.\n\nThe industry in Drammen started to expand and included glass, iron and beer.\n\nIn 1899 a massive rebuild of the port started, because the boats needed more space to dock.\n\nDuring the late years of the 1900´s, the paper export took a turn, and decreased.\n\nAt this time Holmen bridge was built and made it easy to load merchandise from ships to trucks. At the same time the exports of other goods increased, so in 1974 the port needed to expand again. This time the development and establishment of the dock Riskaia was on Holmen.\n\nThe first car, a Datsun, was loaded at the docks in 1964. This was the first of many cars to arrive the Port of Drammen. As soon as the car industry settled at the port, a fairytale started. Today the port is the biggest of it´s kind in Norway.\n\nA lot changed during the end of the 1900´s. Among the changes was a new harbor law, and in 1985 the port was municipalised.\n\nJust a short amount time after this, the activity and trading was heavely decreased and something needed to be done.\n\nChanges\n\nAt this time, the port was entering a new era. Einar Olsen became the new director and the work of how to increase the activity started. Olsen wanted more traid, expansion and modern developement.\n\nBy the year 2003, the port expanded with 90 acres at Holmen. In 2006 the goal is to be the best intermodal port in southeast of Norway.\n\nThe capacity of containers increased in 2014 and seven railways in addition was established at Holmen in 2016.\n\nAt this point the port is the largest in terms of car import in the country, and aims to be the largest junction point for railway goods.\n\nAn important strategy\n\nA new strategy for the years 2021-2040 was established in 2021.\n\nHere are the main goals for the Port of Drammen:\n\n1. The port is going to be sustainable and aims to be a good neighbour in Drammen. Therefor the goal is to have emission-free operations by the year 2030 and to score above 70 on reputation metrics.\n\n2. The port is going to be leading in car import with over 90 precent of the car import.\n\n3. The port is going to be a junction point for sea, roads and railway. Therefore the port is going to contribute to a sustainable solution that keeps over 50 precent goods on train, instead of roads, by 2030.\n\n4. The port shall be a harbor with long term development of robust infrastructure, which will efficiently execute approved regulation and investment plans in line with time and budget.\n\n5. The port is going to be proactive and commercial, aiming a turnover with over 100 MNOK, by the year 2030.\n\n6. The port shall be an efficient and technology- driven port, based on strategic partnerships, with leading marketing efficiency, quality and transparency that enables handling of over 150 000 cars, over 60 000 containers over 20-feet and over 300 000 tonns of bulk cargo by 2030."
