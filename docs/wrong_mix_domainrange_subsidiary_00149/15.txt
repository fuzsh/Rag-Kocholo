Adobe has begun to pull back the curtain, hinting at what's in store now that the Adobe-Macromedia acquisition is complete. Ben Watson, Group Manager for Adobeâ€™s Developer Relations Team, blogs about some of the sample applications that Adobe has been working on - Macromedia Flex with Adobe LiveCycle, Macromedia ColdFusion with Adobe LiveCycle, and Macromedia Flash with Adobe Acrobat (that one sounds hot). The techies at Adobe are excited that the merger legalities are over, so they can get down to work integrating the two products. What's it all going to mean? Here's Watson's quick take:

a) A sign of life for Web 2.0.

b) A supa-slick client platform.

c) A real composite application development suite.

d) The beginning of the end of deployment-driven architectures.

e) One of the largest and fastest growing developer communities around.

f) A new face for Java.

f) A really cool bunch of awesome geekiness with all the requisite blinky lights and shiny knobs.
