Cross-Industry Group Presents Specification For Enhanced Television Programs

CableLabs, CNN, DIRECTV, Discovery, Disney, Intel, Microsoft/WebTV, NBC, NDTC Technology, NCI, PBS, Sony, Tribune and Warner Bros. Collaborate on Enhanced TV Proposal

July 28, 1998 -- A group of companies representing broadcast and cable networks; television stations; cable and satellite service providers; and the consumer electronics, PC and software industries today announced a draft specification for enhanced television programming. The authors of the specification are CableLabs; CNN; DIRECTV, Inc.; Discovery Communications, Inc. (DCI); The Walt Disney Company; Intel Corporation; Microsoft Corporation/WebTV Networks, Inc.; NBC Multimedia, Inc.; Network Computer, Inc. (NCI); NDTC Technology; Public Broadcasting Service (PBS); Sony Corporation; Tribune Company and Warner Bros.

The group, called the Advanced Television Enhancement Forum (ATVEF), has defined protocols for television programming enhanced with data, such as Internet content. The goal is to allow content creators to design enhanced programming that may be delivered over any form of transport (analog or digital TV, cable, or satellite) to all types of broadcast receivers that comply with the proposed specification.

Enhanced television offers new entertainment and commerce opportunities, such as: sports events with complementary information on players and teams, news with additional details and related stories, and ads that allow consumers to order merchandise with the click of a button.

A common specification should accelerate the creation and distribution of enhanced television programs and allow consumers to enjoy such programs cost-effectively and conveniently, regardless of which transport or broadcast receiver they use. Such a specification would also allow content providers and distributors to choose from a variety of enhanced television business models and delivery methods.

Other companies intending to work with the ATVEF to accelerate development of products and services include Cable and Wireless Communications, Digital Renaissance, E! Entertainment Television, The Fantastic Corporation, Hitachi Limited, Macromedia, Inc., Mixed Signals Technologies, National Geographic Ventures, Sharp Corporation, The Weather Channel and Wink Communications.

The draft specification is posted at the group's Web site, www.atvef.com, for public comment, and any company may voluntarily adopt the specification by completing the agreement on the Web site. The ATVEF is working with other industry groups and standards bodies to incorporate the specification as part of those bodies' standards, in order to provide a consistent international blueprint for enhanced products and services. Those bodies include: OpenCable, Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB), Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). The ATVEF intends to publish the final revision of the specification in the fourth quarter of 1998. The ATVEF anticipates the first compliant receivers and programming will be available in the first half of 1999.
