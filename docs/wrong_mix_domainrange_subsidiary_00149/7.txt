Cartoon Network[]

Cartoon Network was the first international broadcaster of Code Lyoko. CN performed the initial airing of Code Lyoko for the US market within a few weeks of broadcast of the French dub in France. Cartoon Network did not license Code Lyoko Evolution.

Cartoon Network was started on October 1st, 1992 by Turner Broadcasting, so that the company could make money off of its animation assets. The channel's first show was the Bugs Bunny short Rhapsody Rabbit. The channel was the initial broadcaster of many popular and critically acclaimed shows in the 90s and early 2000s, such as Dexter's Laboratory, Ed Edd n Eddy, Teen Titans, and the Powerpuff Girls. In 1997, the channel launched Toonami, which was a major introduction of Anime into the US market. In 2000, the channel launched Boomerang, as a dumping ground for canceled and old shows to still make money. Later, in 2004, the channel launched Miguzi, a programming block which carried both Code Lyoko and Totally Spies, two high-performing Franime. Code Lyoko was removed from the Miguzi block for a worse timeslot, but survived the cancelation of the timeslot itself. Code Lyoko continued to be broadcasted until 2007. Initially, the channel was a rebroadcaster of the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but diversified in 2002 with a code-share channel, "Adult Swim", a channel dedicated to animation for people in their 20s and teens.

Season 4 Airing Controversy[]

For most of its run, Cartoon Network aired Code Lyoko regularly on its Miguzi block, occasionally giving it timeslots outside the block and running marathons. It was the block's second most popular show when it premiered in 2004, becoming its most popular in 2005.[1][2] The series was Cartoon Network's third highest rated program overall in 2006, behind only Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and Pokémon, respectively.[2][3]. The channel even ordered the prequel episode X.A.N.A. Awakens.[4]

However, starting with Season 4 the channel became controversial in the fanbase. With the cancellation of Miguzi around the time Season 4 premiered in May 2007, Code Lyoko moved to weekly premieres on Tuesday nights for the summer. The series then moved to Saturday mornings in September after summer ended, but Cartoon Network skipped Lab Rat during the shift, an episode crucial to the overarching plot. Premieres were often preempted by other programming during this time before Cartoon Network dropped the show from their schedule altogether in November. The last seven episodes of Season 4 were ultimately never aired on the network as a result, instead being quietly released on their website with no advertisement.

The reason for Cartoon Network removing the show shortly before it finished is unknown, though the channel was going through a regime change in 2007. Mike Lazzo, who managed Miguzi, had left Cartoon Network for Adult Swim by the time Season 4 premiered.[5] The Boston Mooninite Panic in January of that year lead to the resignation of Cartoon Network's general manager Jim Samples along with several other executives at the network, with Stuart Snyder named as his replacement in May.[6] Maxwell Atoms, creator of the channel's The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy series, noted Cartoon Network cancelled nearly all of their original programing during this time.[7] While Code Lyoko wasn't one of their originals, it's been speculated it was taken off the schedule as a result of the regime change. A common rumor says an executive from Cartoon Network posted on Twitter that they personally removed the show as they disliked it. Said tweet has never been found however and the executive's name is unknown, bringing its authenticity into question.

Dargaud/Mediatoon Distribution[]

Dargaud is a French media franchising company which specializes in comic books for the French and Belgian markets. It is headquartered in Paris. After the French arm of Moonscoop fell into bankruptcy, and the Moonscoop group performed an economic fruitfly, the rights to Code Lyoko fell under the control of Darguard, who sent it to their subsidiary, Mediatoon Distribution.

Jetix / Disney / Toon Disney / Disney XD[]

Jetix was an international programming block and channel which was one of the main broadcasters of Code Lyoko. It was responsible for broadcasting Code Lyoko in Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Mexico "a role shared with Cartoon Network", and the Netherlands. It specialized in adventure and action based shows. It was a cooperative project between Fox, Disney, and some shell companies. In 2009 and 2010, the Jetix brand was retired, and folded into the Disney and Disney XD brands. Additionally, Jetix was responsible for creating Perdus dans Lyokô and Treinamento Anti-ZENA. Code Lyoko also aired on Disney Channel Italy, along with several other broadcasters. There's a complicated history here.

Jetix started as a set of secondary European properties owned by Fox in Europe, which were partially purchased by ABC during Disney's purchase of ABC. Throughout 2004, Jetix became a consolidated brand which aired as channel blocks, independent channels, and code shares in various countries, spreading world wide. Most of these were with Toon Disney and Disney Channel. In 2008, Disney initiated a buyout, taking over the brand officially. From there, a new channel was launched: Disney XD, which was formed as a merger of Jetix and Toon Disney, even though they were already the same channel in most cases. The new Disney XD shared most of the old programming, though new items shifted into the lineup after the first few years.

Disney Channel itself is a property of the Walt Disney company, one of the oldest entertainment companies in existence. Disney's contribution to the Code Lyoko franchise was airing the show in Italy, along with owning Jetix during its broadcasts of Code Lyoko. Disney is the second largest media company in the world, second only to Comcast. The company's history traces back to the silent film era in 1923, when it worked in animation. Over the years with some losses, it developed some properties such as Mickey Mouse, which remains its flagship character. They then launched the first cel-animated feature length film:: "Snow White And The Seven Dwarves". Then in the 40s, the US and Canada were both in World War 2, and much of the company was drafted. Cut off from the foreign market which was the majority of their revenue, and stuck in a command economy, they broke into the propaganda film industry. After the war ended, Disney had a brief experimental phase with a few films such as "Song Of The South", a film which blended live action and Animation, often in the same shots; but is now disavowed by the company for being racist. From there till 1966, Disney's film empire grew, culminating in the death of the company's co-founder, Walt Disney. From there, the company diversified into theme parks, though revenue from the art itself was declining, primarily due to the creation of a competitor from their previous employees: Don Bluth Productions. After a few awkward years with at least one corporate coup, the studio released "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", which reused "Song Of The South"'s techniques and "The Little Mermaid", resulting in an era now known as "The Disney Revival". This was the era in which Disney Channel launched. In 1994, Disney purchased ABC broadcasting, and launched a cruise line a few years later. After another coup, Disney started acquiring other media companies, including Pixar, Lucasworks, Marvel, Maker Studios, and Blip. Blip was later shut down.

Spacetoon[]

Spacetoon is a cluster of animation and shopping channels that operate in the Arabic language markets, Indonesia, India by license, and formerly South Korea. Spacetoon's contribution to the Code Lyoko franchise was being the initial broadcaster of Code Lyoko to the Indonesian market.

Spacetoon started in Dubai and branched into Indonesia and South Korea before the 2008 economic recession. It was also licensed in India, but Spacetoon India is basically a separate company. In the Arabic markets, Spacetoon created several secondary channels: Spacetoon English, Spacetoon Radio, and Space Power TV.

After the recession, Spacetoon Korea failed. Spacetoon English, Spacetoon Radio, and Space Power TV were all forced to shut down in the Arabic language market, with only the original Spacetoon surviving in that market. Spacetoon Indonesia sold its OTA broadcasting channel to NET., a new generic broadcaster. NET. also gained secondary rights to broadcast Code Lyoko in the Indonesian market. This created a similar situation to France Television and Canal J in France. After this, Spacetoon Indonesia became a cable/satellite only provider in Indonesia. From here, Spacetoon Indonesia launched Spacetoon 2, Spacetoon Plus, and Spacetoon 3. Spacetoon 3 lasted less than a year. Due to financial problems, the Spacetoon company was forced to diversify from children's content to also include home shopping. Spacetoon 2 was rebranded as Space Shopping.
