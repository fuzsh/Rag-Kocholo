AUTODESK Autodesk develops, markets and supports personal computer software for design drafting, visualization and multimedia content creation. Autodesk has structured its internal marketing and development organizations around five key market groups that most closely match Autodesk's customer base: Architecture, Engineering and Construction (\"AEC\"), Mechanical Computer-Aided Design (\"MCAD\"), Geographic Information Systems (\"GIS\"), Personal Solutions Group (\"PSG\") and Multimedia (\"Kinetix\"). Autodesk's AEC Market Group provides mechanical engineers, designers and drafters with advanced, value-based solutions designed to solve their professional design challenges.

Kinetix provides two core platform products--3D Studio MAX and 3D Studio VIZ--that specifically focus on these markets. Autodesk is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Its principal executive offices are located at 111 McInnis Parkway, San Rafael, California 94903, and its telephone number is (415) 507-5000.

THE TRANSACTIONS The business combination between Autodesk and Discreet will be effected pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement entered into among the Company, Discreet, Autodesk Development B.V. (\"Dutchco\"), 9066-9771 Quebec Inc. (\"Amalgamation Sub\"), Autodesk Canada Inc. and 9066-9854 Quebec Inc. (\"Autodesk Quebec\"). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Dutchco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, will acquire Discreet by way of an Amalgamation under Quebec law and certain related transactions. Discreet will be amalgamated with Autodesk Quebec and Amalgamation Sub to form \"New Discreet,\" which will carry on the existing business of Discreet as an indirect subsidiary of Autodesk. Each holder of Discreet Common Shares will receive in the Transactions either 0.33 shares of Autodesk Common Stock or 0.33 exchangeable non-voting shares of New Discreet. The exchangeable shares of New Discreet issued in the Transactions will be exchangeable at any time at the option of the holder, and will automatically be exchanged on the eleventh anniversary of the closing of the Transactions (or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Autodesk or New Discreet), for Common Stock of Autodesk on a one-for-one basis. Based on the capitalizations of Autodesk and Discreet as of December 31, 1998, Autodesk expects to issue approximately 9.9 million shares of Common Stock to the shareholders of Discreet in the Transactions, which shares will represent approximately 16.5% of the Common Stock outstanding after the Transactions, assuming the issuance of the 3 million shares offered hereby. The Transactions were approved by the stockholders of the Company and by the shareholders of Discreet at meetings held on March 10, 1999. If all conditions to the Transactions are satisfied or waived, the Transactions are anticipated to close on March 16, 1999, immediately following the closing of the issuance and sale of the Common Stock offered hereby. 4\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS For the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, Autodesk reported net revenues of $189.1 million versus $181.8 million for the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Net revenue for fiscal 1999 totaled $740.2 million, an increase of 20 percent over net revenue in the prior fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, net income was $25.1 million, or $0.50 per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income of $27.5 million, or $0.56 per share on a diluted basis, in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net income for fiscal 1999 was $90.6 million, and resulted in earnings per share of $1.85 on a diluted basis, including nonrecurring charges as well as incremental amortization of goodwill and intangible assets from prior acquisitions. Net income for fiscal 1998 was $45.2 million, and resulted in earnings per share $0.91 on a diluted basis, including nonrecurring charges as well as incremental amortization of goodwill and intangible assets from prior acquisitions. 5\n\nTHE OFFERING Common Stock offered by the Company(1)...................... 3,000,000 shares Common Stock to be outstanding after the offering and the Transactions(2)................. 60,193,000 shares Nasdaq symbol for the Common Stock........................... ADSK Use of proceeds.................. For general corporate purposes, including working capital. See \"Use of Proceeds.\" The primary motivation for this offering is to qualify the Transactions for pooling of interests accounting treatment. To do so, the Company must issue prior to the closing of the Transactions approximately 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock, due to its prior repurchase of shares of Common Stock in various transactions. The Common Stock offered hereby will not be issued unless and until all conditions to the Transactions have been satisfied or waived, including approval of the Transactions by the stockholders of the Company and Discreet. - -------- (1) Assumes no exercise of the Underwriters' over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 450,000 shares of Common Stock from the Company. See \"Underwriting.\" (2) Based upon 47,342,000 shares outstanding at January 31, 1999 and assuming the issuance of 3,000,000 shares offered hereby and the issuance of approximately 9,851,000 shares in the Transactions. RISK FACTORS Certain factors should be considered in connection with an investment in the Common Stock. See \"Risk Factors.\" 6\n\nSELECTED HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED SELECTED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA The following selected historical financial information of Autodesk and Discreet has been derived from their respective audited and unaudited historical consolidated financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with such audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The unaudited selected pro forma financial information of Autodesk and Discreet are derived from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, which give effect to the Transactions as a pooling-of-interests, and should be read in conjunction with such unaudited pro forma statements and notes thereto, which are incorporated by reference into this Prospectus. For Autodesk and Discreet pro forma purposes, Autodesk's historical condensed consolidated statements of income for the three fiscal years ended January 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, and Autodesk's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended October 31, 1998 have been combined with the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations of Discreet for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1996, the eleven months ended June 30, 1997, the twelve months ended December 31, 1997, and the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations of Discreet for the nine months ended September 30, 1998, respectively. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet assumes the Transactions took place on October 31, 1998 and combines Autodesk's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet at that date with Discreet's historical condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 1998. The unaudited selected pro forma combined financial data should be read in conjunction with the unaudited pro forma financial statements incorporated by reference into this Prospectus. Autodesk paid quarterly dividends of $0.06 per share with respect to fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998, and in each of the first three quarters of fiscal 1999, and currently intends to continue paying such cash dividends on a quarterly basis. Discreet has not paid any cash dividends on its Common Shares. Discreet currently intends to retain any earnings for future growth and therefore does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its Common Shares in the foreseeable future. The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the Transactions had been consummated at the times indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position.

The fiscal 1995 amount represents a federal district court judgment against Autodesk in a trade secret lawsuit. The charges for fiscal 1997 and 1998 consist of charges relating to the write off of purchased in-process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternate future use. Nonrecurring charges for the nine months ended October 31, 1998 consist primarily of a charge relating to the write off of purchased in-process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternate future use ($13.1 million), restructuring charges for the consolidation of certain development centers ($1.5 million), the write-off of purchased technologies associated with these operations ($2.2 million), staff reductions in the Asia Pacific region ($1.7 million), costs in relation to potential legal settlements ($2.5 million) and the write-down to fair market value of older computer equipment which Autodesk plans to dispose of ($1.0 million). The restructurings noted above are expected to be completed during the last half of Autodesk's fiscal year ended January 31, 1999. (2) Income from operations for the nine months ended October 31, 1998 includes a reversal of a portion of the litigation reserve in the amount of $18.2 million as a result of a favorable decision on appeal of the trade secret lawsuit (see footnote 1, above). In addition to the $18.2 million, $2.7 million of interest associated with the litigation reserve was reversed and is reflected in net income for the nine months ended October 31, 1998. (3) Subsequent to the Securities and Exchange Commission's letter to the AICPA dated September 9, 1998, regarding its views on in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\"), the Company has re-evaluated its IPR&D charges on the Softdesk, Inc. and Genius CAD Software GmbH acquisitions, revised the purchase price allocations and restated its financial statements. Amounts for fiscal 1998 and the nine months ended October 31, 1998 and 1997 have been restated to adjust the allocation of the purchase price of these business combinations occurring in fiscal 1998 and the nine months ended October 31, 1998. The adjustments had the effect of increasing net income (diluted net income per share) by $29.8 million, ($0.60), $8 million, ($0.16) and $31.6 million ($0.65) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1998 and the nine months ended October 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

The following risk factors should be considered by prospective investors in evaluating whether to purchase the Common Stock. These factors should be considered in conjunction with the other information included in this Prospectus. This Prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Prospectus. Some of these factors relate directly to the Transactions, while others are present independent of the Transactions in the general business environment of each of Autodesk, Discreet and the combined company following the Transactions (the \"Combined Company\"). The risks highlighted herein should not be assumed to be the only factors that could affect the future performance of Autodesk, Discreet and the Combined Company. RISKS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS Failure to Achieve Beneficial Synergies. Autodesk and Discreet have entered into the Acquisition Agreement with the expectation that the Transactions will result in beneficial synergies. These include mutual benefits from complementary strengths in the 3D modeling and animation tools markets, the competitive advantages resulting from offering a comprehensive suite of integrated product offerings, combined industry experience and market knowledge and shared distribution channels. Achieving these anticipated synergies will depend on a number of factors including, without limitation, the successful integration of Autodesk's and Discreet's operations and general and industry-specific economic factors. Even if Autodesk and Discreet are able to integrate their operations and economic conditions remain unchanged, there can be no assurance that the anticipated synergies will be achieved. The failure to achieve such synergies could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Combined Company. Integration of Operations and Technologies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Transactions will depend in part upon whether the integration of the two companies' businesses is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner, and there can be no assurance as to the extent to which this will occur, if at all. The combination of the two companies will require, among other things, integration of the companies' respective operations, products, technologies, management information systems, distribution channels and key personnel and the coordination of their sales, marketing and research and development efforts. In particular, the Combined Company will be required to integrate Autodesk's sales channel, which consists principally of independent resellers, with Discreet's sales force, which typically sells product directly to customers. As a result of these and other factors, the integration may not be accomplished smoothly or successfully, if at all. If significant difficulties are encountered in the integration of the existing operations, products or technologies or the development of new products and technologies, resources could be diverted from new product development, and delays in new product introductions could occur. Compared to Autodesk's products, Discreet's products have traditionally experienced longer, more complex sales cycles. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to take full advantage of the combined sales efforts. In addition, the difficulties of integrating Autodesk and Discreet may be increased by the necessity of coordinating organizations with distinct corporate cultures and widely dispersed operations in two different countries. See \"--Integration of Operations of a non-US Company.\" The consummation of the Transactions and the integration of operations and technologies following the consummation of the Transactions will constitute a significant challenge to Autodesk's, Discreet's and the Combined Company's managements and will require substantial effort and dedication of management and other personnel, which may distract their attention from the day-to-day business of these entities, the development or acquisition of new technologies, and the pursuit of other business opportunities. In addition, certain Discreet systems currently include computer hardware, which may present business issues as to which Autodesk management has limited experience. See \"--Risks Relating to the 10\n\nCombined Company--Dependence on Single Workstation Vendor\" and \"--Reliance on Sole Source Suppliers.\" Failure to successfully accomplish the integration of the two companies' operations, technologies and personnel would likely have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, during the pre-acquisition and integration phases, aggressive competitors may undertake initiatives to attract customers or employees through various incentives, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial conditions of Autodesk, Discreet and/or the Combined Company. Customers. The present and potential customers of Discreet and Autodesk may not continue their current buying patterns in light of the Transactions. Certain customers may defer purchasing decisions as they evaluate the proposed Transactions, other recent acquisitions and product announcements in the multimedia and design software industries, the Combined Company's future product strategy, current and anticipated product offerings of competitors, and any other outside forces which may affect customer buying patterns. Customers may ultimately decide to purchase competitors' products in lieu of the Combined Company's products. Historically, Discreet and Autodesk have had significantly different types of customers. These different customer types may evaluate the Combined Company differently. Discreet believes that its results of operations for the three-month period ended September 30, 1998 were negatively impacted by what Discreet believed to be temporary customer concerns regarding the Transactions, including the deferral or alteration of customer purchasing decisions. While Discreet believes that the negative effects resulting from customer concerns regarding uncertainty surrounding the acquisition did not have a significant impact on its results of operations for the three month period ended December 31, 1998, a significant amount of time has elapsed since the original announcement of the Transactions on August 20, 1998, and there can be no assurance that certain customers will not choose again to delay or alter purchasing decisions or that this prolonged period will not influence customers to delay or alter purchasing decisions (for example, in favor of one of Discreet's competitors), both of which would have an adverse effect on Discreet's future operating results. In addition, there can be no assurances that consummation of the Transactions and the conduct of the Combined Company's business thereafter will adequately address such concerns. See \"--Integration of Operations and Technologies.\" Further, the decision of customers to defer their purchasing decisions or to purchase products elsewhere would have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Combined Company. Dependence on Retention and Integration of Key Employees. The success of the Combined Company is dependent on the retention and integration of the key management, sales, marketing, engineering and other technical employees of Autodesk and Discreet. Competition for qualified personnel in the multimedia and design software industries is very intense, and competitors often use aggressive tactics to recruit key employees during the period leading up to an acquisition and during the integration phase following an acquisition. Discreet has experienced recent changes in its sales organization leadership which negatively affected its sales efforts and its results of operations for the three-month periods ended September 30, 1998 and December 31, 1998. Discreet has recently hired a new Vice President, Advanced Systems Sales and Marketing. However, Discreet still has several field vacancies and, further, the integration of key employees is a time consuming process and there can be no assurance that this recent addition and Discreet's other efforts will alleviate in a timely manner the disruptive or negative effect resulting from the changes in Discreet's sales organization leadership and the lack of certain key sales employees during the periods. See \"--Integration of Operations and Technologies; Dependence on Retention and Integration of Key Employers.\" Stock options, which generally become exercisable only over a period of several years of employment, serve as an important incentive for retaining key employees. In accordance with their original terms, certain stock options held by several key Discreet employees will be fully exercisable or the vesting thereof will accelerate upon the consummation of the Transactions, thus potentially reducing the retention incentive provided by these options. While the Combined Company will endeavor to retain key Discreet 11\n\nemployees, there can be no assurance that key employees will remain with the Combined Company. The loss of services of any of the key employees of the Combined Company could materially and adversely affect the Combined Company's business, financial condition and results of operation. Integration of Operations of a non-US Company. Cross-border acquisitions entail certain special risks in addition to those normally encountered in a domestic acquisition. These include the difficulty of integrating employees from a different corporate culture into the acquiring organization; the need to understand different incentives that motivate employees in a non-US company; the greater difficulty of transplanting the acquiring company's corporate culture to an organization that is physically distant; and the difficulty and expense of relocating employees from one country to another in the event of an internal group restructuring following an acquisition. These factors can reduce the likelihood of the long-term success of a cross-border acquisition. Although Autodesk derives the majority of its revenues from non- US sales and has significant operations outside the United States, it has limited experience integrating the management, sales, product development and marketing organizations of a significant non-US business with its existing operations. Although Discreet has sales and marketing operations in the United States and derives a significant portion of its revenue from US sales, its management and product development personnel are predominantly based in Canada. There can be no assurance that Autodesk will be able to successfully integrate the personnel and operations of Discreet into the existing Autodesk organization. Potential Dilutive Effect to Stockholders. Although Autodesk and Discreet believe that beneficial synergies will result from the Transactions, combining the two companies' businesses, even if the combination is achieved in an efficient, effective and timely manner, may not result in combined results of operations and financial condition superior to what would have been achieved by each company independently, and may in any event require a longer period than management of Autodesk or Discreet anticipates. In addition, based on the capitalization of each of Autodesk and Discreet as of December 31, 1998, Autodesk will issue approximately 9.9 million new shares of Common Stock. Autodesk will also issue 3 million shares of Common Stock in this offering. The issuance of new shares of Common Stock in connection with the Transactions and this offering will have the initial effect of reducing Autodesk's net income per share and could reduce the market price of the Common Stock unless and until revenue growth, cost savings or other business synergies sufficient to offset the effect of such issuance can be achieved. There can be no assurance that Autodesk stockholders and Discreet shareholders would not achieve greater returns on investment if Autodesk and Discreet were to remain independent of each other. Volatility Of Stock Prices. The market for the Common Stock is highly volatile. The trading price of the Common Stock has in the past been and could in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results, announcements following the development or acquisition of technological innovations or new products by Autodesk or Discreet or their competitors, changes in prices of Autodesk's or Discreet's or their competitors' products and services, changes in product mix, changes in revenue and revenue growth rates for Autodesk or Discreet as a whole or for geographic areas or business units, and other events or factors. Statements or changes in opinions, ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which Autodesk does business or relating to Autodesk or Discreet specifically have resulted, and could in the future result, in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the Common Stock. Statements by financial or industry analysts regarding the impact on Autodesk's net income per share resulting from the Transactions and the extent to which such analysts expect potential business synergies to affect reported results in future periods can be expected to contribute to volatility in the market price of the Common Stock. Moreover, the issuance of significant numbers of additional shares by Autodesk, including the issuance of the shares offered hereby, may have the effect of reducing the market price of the Common Stock. In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for the 12\n\nsecurities of many high-technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Autodesk Common Stock. Substantial Expenses Resulting from the Transactions. Autodesk, Dutchco and Discreet estimate they will incur direct transaction costs, relating primarily to regulatory filing costs, and the fees of financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, financial printers and proxy solicitors, of approximately $13 million associated with the Transactions, which will be charged to operations upon consummation of the Transactions. Autodesk and Discreet expect the Combined Company to incur an additional significant charge to operations, currently estimated at $6-8 million, to reflect costs associated with integrating the two companies which will be expensed as incurred. The Combined Company may also incur additional material charges in subsequent quarters to reflect additional costs associated with the Transactions. RISKS RELATING TO THE COMBINED COMPANY As is true for technology companies generally, Autodesk, Dutchco and Discreet currently operate, and, following consummation of the Transactions, the Combined Company will operate, in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond their control. Competition. The software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding capabilities at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced revenues and profit margins, and loss of market share, any of which could adversely affect Autodesk's business, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition. The design software market, in particular, is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which Autodesk competes. This competition includes the entry of competitors with innovative technologies and the consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies. Autodesk believes that the principal factors affecting competition in its markets are product reliability, performance, ease of use, range of useful features, continuing product enhancements, reputation, price, and training. In addition, the availability of third-party application software is a competitive factor within the multimedia and design software markets. Autodesk believes that it competes favorably in these areas and that its competitive position will depend, in part, upon its continued ability to enhance existing products, and to develop and market new products. The digital imaging software market in which Discreet competes is extremely competitive and characterized by frequent and rapid changes in technology and customer preferences. Discreet competes with other software vendors for access to distribution channels and customers. Competition is generally based on product features and functionality, ease of use, quality of customer support, timeliness of product upgrades and price, among other factors. As the market for the software products of Discreet continues to develop and other software vendors expand their product lines to include products that compete with those of Discreet, competition may intensify. A number of Discreet's competitors and potential competitors possess significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and sales and other resources than Discreet or the Combined Company. In addition, as desktop computers become more powerful and less expensive, a broader group of software developers may be able to introduce products for personal computers that would be competitive with Discreet's products in terms of price and performance. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the future products produced by the Combined Company will be successful or gain market acceptance. The ability of the Combined Company to compete will depend on factors both within and outside its control, including the success and timing of new product development and product introductions by 13\n\nthe Combined Company and its competitors, product performance and price, distribution and customer support. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to compete successfully with respect to these factors. Although Autodesk and Discreet believe that the Combined Company will have certain technological and other advantages over its competitors, maintaining such advantages will require continued investment by the Combined Company in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will have sufficient resources to make such investment or that the Combined Company will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages. The future financial performance of Autodesk's Discreet business unit as part of the Combined Company will depend in part on the successful development, introduction and customer acceptance of existing and new or enhanced products. In addition, in order for the unit to achieve sustained growth as part of the Combined Company, the market for its systems and software must continue to develop and the Combined Company must expand this market to include additional applications within the film and video industries and develop or acquire new products for use in related markets. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be successful in marketing its existing or new or enhanced products. In addition, as the Combined Company enters new markets, distribution channels, technical requirements and levels and bases of competition may be different from those in Discreet's current markets; there can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to compete favorably. In April 1998, Autodesk received notice that the FTC had undertaken a nonpublic investigation to determine whether Autodesk or others have engaged in or are engaging in unfair methods of competition. The FTC has not made any claims or allegations regarding Autodesk's current business practices or policies, nor have any charges been filed. Autodesk intends to cooperate fully with the FTC in its inquiry. Autodesk does not believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on its business or consolidated results of operations. Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results. From time to time, Autodesk experiences fluctuations in its quarterly operations as a result of periodic release cycles, competitive factors and general economic conditions, among other things. For example, Autodesk's net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 1998 were $119 million as compared to $182 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998, with the increase attributable in part to the introduction of AutoCAD Release 14 in the second fiscal quarter as well as increased revenues from Autodesk's geographic information systems and AEC product offerings. In the past, Autodesk has experienced declines in sales of AutoCAD and AutoCAD updates in quarters prior to the introduction of a new release of AutoCAD as customers delay purchasing in anticipation of the new version. In addition, Autodesk has experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality. In particular, Autodesk's operating results in Europe during its third fiscal quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period while the Asia/Pacific region typically experiences seasonal slowing in Autodesk's third and fourth fiscal quarters. Autodesk receives and fulfills a majority of its orders within a particular quarter, with the majority of the sales to distributors and dealers (value- added resellers or \"VARs\"). These resellers typically carry inventory of Autodesk's products and place volume orders equivalent to a few days or a few weeks of sales. The timing of these orders could have a material impact on quarterly operating results. Additionally, Autodesk's operating expenses are based in part on its expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term. Accordingly, any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the Combined Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, shortfalls in Autodesk's and Discreet's revenues or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts have in the past had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of each company's common stock, and any such shortfalls can be expected to have a similar 14\n\neffect on Autodesk's stock price following consummation of the Transactions. Moreover, each of Autodesk's and Discreet's stock price is, and Autodesk's stock price will be, subject to the volatility generally associated with technology stocks and may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to performance in future periods. A variety of factors have caused period-to-period fluctuations in Discreet and Autodesk's operating results, including the integration of operations resulting from acquisitions of companies, products or technologies, revenues and expenses related to the introduction of new products or new versions of existing products, changes in selling prices, delays in customer purchases in anticipation of upgrades to existing products, or introduction of new products (including products of third parties), currency fluctuations, dealer and distributor order patterns or general economic trends. In addition, in the future, the Combined Company is more likely to recognize a disproportionate amount of its revenue for a given fiscal quarter or fiscal year at the end of such fiscal quarter or fiscal year. Autodesk and Discreet believe that the operating results of Autodesk's Discreet business unit could vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A limited number of system sales may account for a substantial percentage of Discreet's quarterly revenue because of the high average sales price of such systems and the timing of purchase orders. Historically, Discreet has generally experienced greater revenues during the period following the completion of the National Association of Broadcasters trade show, which typically is held in April. In addition, the timing of revenue is influenced by a number of other factors, including the timing of individual orders and shipments, other industry trade shows, competition, seasonal customer buying patterns, changes in customer buying patterns in response to platform changes and changes in product development, and sales and marketing expenditures. Because Discreet's operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of Discreet's expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, variations in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quarterly earnings shortfalls or losses. In addition, Discreet has recently experienced fluctuation in its operating results for the three month period ended September 30, 1998 which Discreet believes to be primarily due to seasonally slower than expected sales in Europe, general market anxiety in North America causing delays in capital spending, customers deferring purchase decisions due to confusion over HDTV timing and standards, what Discreet believes to be temporary concerns in the Advanced Systems customer base regarding the Transactions which may have led to purchasing delays, and recent changes in Discreet's sales organization leadership. Discreet has further experienced fluctuation in its operating results for the three month period ended December 31, 1998, reporting revenues of $24.8 million and operating loss of $2.2 million, as compared to revenues of $37.3 million and operating income of $5.8 million for the three month period ending December 31, 1997. Discreet believes this fluctuation was primarily due to continued effects from the lack of a sales and marketing senior executive during the quarter combined with several field vacancies; continued slower than expected sales in Europe and slower than expected sales in Asia due in part to Discreet's sales personnel issues noted above in these geographic areas as well as market conditions in these regions which have affected customer capital expenditures; and a greater number of turnkey systems sales through the indirect channel which caused a negative effect on margins. There can be no assurance that customer purchasing decision deferrals resulting from market anxiety and a reduction of capital expenditures; confusion over Digital Television (\"DTV\") timing and standards and continued effects from the lack of a sales and marketing senior executive combined with several field vacancies; continued slower than expected sales in Europe and Asia; and the mix of systems sales through Discreet's indirect channel and its related effect on margins will not continue into the future and have an adverse effect on Discreet's or the Combined Company's results of operations and financial conditions. While Discreet believes that the negative effects resulting from customer concerns regarding uncertainty surrounding the acquisition did not have a significant impact on its results of operations for the three month period ended December 31, 1998, a significant amount of time has elapsed since the original announcement of the Transactions on August 20, 1998, and 15\n\nthere can be no assurance that certain customers will not choose again to delay or alter purchasing decisions (for example, in favor of one of Discreet's competitors), both of which could have an adverse effect on Discreet's future operating results. See \"--Customers,\" \"--Dependence on Retention and Integration of Key Employees\" and \"--Rapidly Changing Industry.\" Product Concentration. Autodesk derives, and after consummation of the Transactions is expected to continue to derive, a substantial portion of its revenues from sales of AutoCAD software, AutoCAD upgrades, and adjacent products which are interoperable with AutoCAD. As such, any factor adversely affecting sales of AutoCAD and AutoCAD upgrades, including such factors as product life cycle, market acceptance, product performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, the availability of third-party applications or the introduction of products which substitute for AutoCAD, could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. Rapidly Changing Industry. The multimedia and design software industries are characterized by rapid growth and technological change and changes in customer requirements. The success of the Combined Company in this industry will depend on many factors, including the continued acceptance of Discreet's current products, its ability to enhance and support those products, its ability to create an effective, integrated organization to develop and introduce new products that address changing customer needs and technological advances by competitors on a timely basis, and its ability to establish and maintain effective distribution channels for its products. The Combined Company may not be successful in these efforts. The future growth of the Combined Company's revenues for its new media products also depends in part on sustained growth in the demand for interactive media applications, which in turn depends on a number of factors including product acceptance, price-point sensitivities, consumer demand for film and video content and the proliferation of high definition television. The demand for these applications may not develop at the pace or in the direction anticipated by the Combined Company. Discreet believes that market uncertainty and anxiety have negatively affected Discreet's recent results of operations. Discreet believes that there is current uncertainty regarding DTV timing and standards which may have led to customer purchasing decision deferrals. Further, Discreet believes that general market anxiety in North America has affected capital expenditures. For example, Discreet believes reduced advertising expenditures had a negative impact on capital expenditures by post-production companies, broadcast companies and professional consumers (\"prosumers\"), all of which are important customers for Discreet's products. Further, while confusion regarding DTV standards exists, Discreet believes that customers may choose to defer purchasing decisions until such time as details surrounding DTV timing and standards become more certain. There can be no assurance that the uncertainty surrounding DTV and the general market anxiety in North America will not continue to have an adverse effect on Discreet's results of operations. Product Development and Introduction. The multimedia and design software industries are characterized by rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences. The software products offered by Autodesk and Discreet are complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain errors or defects (\"bugs\"), especially when first introduced. For example, in fiscal year 1996, Autodesk experienced quality and performance issues associated with the release of AutoCAD Release 13 which were satisfactorily addressed, but did result in a high rate of product returns in fiscal year 1996. There can be no assurance that defects or errors will not occur in future releases of AutoCAD, Discreet's products, or other software products offered by the Combined Company. Such defects or errors could result in corrective releases to the Combined Company's software products, damage to the Combined Company's reputation, loss of revenues, an increase in product returns, or lack of market acceptance of its products, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. 16\n\nAutodesk and Discreet believe that the Combined Company's future results will depend largely upon its ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability, performance, range of useful features, continuing product enhancements, reputation, price and training. The discovery of product defects could result in the delay or cancellation of planned development projects and could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. Further, increased competition in design, mapping or multimedia software products could also have a negative impact on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. More specifically, gross margins may be adversely affected if customers purchase low-end CAD products, which historically have had lower margins, instead of the Combined Company's higher-margin products. Certain of Autodesk's historical product development activities have been performed by independent firms and contractors, while other technologies are licensed from third parties. Autodesk generally either owns or licenses the software developed by third parties. Because talented development personnel are in high demand, there can be no assurance that independent developers, including those who have developed products for Autodesk in the past, will be able to provide development support to the Combined Company in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to obtain and renew license agreements on favorable terms, if at all, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. The success of Autodesk's Discreet business unit will depend in part upon the Combined Company's ability to enhance Discreet's existing systems and software and to develop and introduce new products and features which meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards on a timely basis. In addition, in connection with Discreet's recent acquisitions, the Combined Company must fully integrate the edit*, effect*, paint* and light* products into its product line and operations. Discreet and Autodesk have from time to time experienced delays in introducing new products and product enhancements and there can be no assurance that the Combined Company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements. In addition, there can be no assurance that such new products or product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. For example, during fiscal 1996, Discreet experienced delays in introducing new products aimed at new market segments and such delay contributed to revenue shortfall experienced by Discreet during such period. From time to time the Combined Company or others may announce products, features or technologies which have the potential to shorten the life cycle of or replace the Combined Company's then existing products. Such announcements could cause customers to defer the decision to buy or determine not to buy the Combined Company's products or cause the Combined Company's distributors to seek to return products to the Combined Company, any of which could have material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. In addition, product announcements by Silicon Graphics, Inc. (\"SGI\") and others in the past have caused customers to defer their decision to buy or determine not to buy Discreet's products. In addition, there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render the Combined Company's products or technology noncompetitive or obsolete. Single Market for Discreet's Systems; Risks Associated with Expansion into New Markets. To date, Discreet's products have been purchased primarily by creative professionals for use in production and post-production in the film and video industries. In order for Autodesk's Discreet business unit to achieve sustained growth, the market for Discreet's systems and software must continue to develop and the Combined Company must expand this market to include additional applications within the entertainment and creative design industries and develop new products for use in related markets. 17\n\nDiscreet recently announced its multi-platform software initiative to develop and market software across Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows NT and UNIX operating systems, in addition to its existing real time turnkey systems solutions, targeted at two new market segments: institutional customers and prosumers. While Autodesk and Discreet believe that the market recognition which Discreet has achieved through sales of flame*, smoke*, effect*, inferno* and fire* systems to creative professionals will facilitate the Combined Company's marketing efforts in new markets, there can be no assurance that Autodesk's Discreet business unit will be able to successfully develop and market systems and software for other markets, or, if it does so, that such systems and software will be accepted at a rate, and in levels, sufficient to maintain growth. Further, the distribution channels, technical requirements and levels and bases of competition in other markets are different than those in Discreet's current market and there can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to compete favorably in those markets. International Operations. Revenue from international operations currently accounts for a significant portion of the consolidated revenues of Autodesk and Discreet, and such revenue is expected to continue to account for a significant portion of the Combined Company's consolidated revenues. Risks inherent in Autodesk's and Discreet's international operations include the following: unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; longer collection cycles; potential changes in tax laws; greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property; and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies in the markets where Autodesk and Discreet conduct business. In particular, during the first nine months of Autodesk's fiscal 1999, changes in exchange rates from the same period of the prior fiscal year adversely impacted Autodesk's revenues by approximately $8.2 million when compared to the same period in the prior year, principally due to changes in the rate of exchange between the US dollar and the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar. Autodesk's international results have been recently impacted by unfavorable economic and political conditions in the Asian markets, and Autodesk believes such conditions will continue over the forseeable period to negatively impact its business. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" There can be no assurance that the economic crisis and currency issues currently being experienced in the Asian markets will not have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's future international sales and, consequently, on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. Dependence on Distribution Channels. Autodesk sells its software products primarily to VARs. Autodesk's ability to effectively distribute products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of its VAR network. Although Autodesk has not currently experienced any material problems with its VAR network, computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future. The loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of Autodesk's major international distributors or large US resellers could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations in future periods. Autodesk's largest international distributor is Computer 2000 AG in Germany. Autodesk's largest resellers and distributors in the United States are Ingram Micro, Inc., Avatech Solutions, Inc., and DLT Solutions Incorporated. Product Returns. With the exception of certain European distributors, agreements with Autodesk's VARs do not contain specific product-return privileges. However, Autodesk permits its VARs to return product in certain instances, generally during periods of product transition and during update cycles. Although product returns, comparing the first quarter of fiscal 1999 to the same period in the prior year, decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenues, management anticipates that product returns in future periods will continue to be impacted by the timing of new product releases, as well as the quality and market acceptance of new products. 18\n\nAutodesk establishes reserves, including reserves for stock balancing and product rotation, based on estimated future returns of product and after taking into account channel inventory levels, the timing of new product introductions, and other factors. While Autodesk maintains strict measures to monitor channel inventories and to provide appropriate reserves, actual product returns may differ from Autodesk's reserve estimates, and such differences could be material to the Combined Company's consolidated financial statements. Intellectual Property. Each of Autodesk's and Discreet's success is dependent on its proprietary technology. Autodesk and Discreet rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights. Despite such efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the Combined Company's software products or to obtain and use information that the Combined Company regards as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of Autodesk's and Discreet's software products is time-consuming and costly. Although neither company is able to measure accurately the extent to which piracy of its software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company's means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that its competitors will not independently develop similar technology. Autodesk and Discreet expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in its market grows and the functionality of products in different market segments overlap. From time to time, infringement claims have been asserted against Autodesk and Discreet, and there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted against the Combined Company in the future or that any such assertions will not have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product shipment delays, or require the Combined Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. If infringement is alleged by any third party, the Combined Company may be required to discontinue the use of certain software codes or processes, to cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, to incur significant litigation costs and expenses and to develop non-infringing technology or to obtain licenses to use the allegedly infringed technology. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company would be able to develop alternative technologies or to obtain such licenses or, if a license were obtainable, that the terms would be commercially reasonable or acceptable to the Combined Company. In addition, Autodesk, and in some cases Discreet, also relies on certain software that is licensed from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in its products to perform key functions. There can be no assurance that these third-party software licenses will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or that the software will be appropriately supported, maintained, or enhanced by the licensors. The loss of licenses, or inability to support, maintain, and enhance any such software, could result in increased costs, or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed, identified, licensed, and integrated, which could have a material adverse effect on the Combined Company's business and consolidated results of operations. Discreet generally seeks to enter into confidentiality agreements with its employees and license agreements with its distributors and to limit access to and distribution of its systems, software, documentation and other proprietary information. Until fiscal 1996, substantially all of Discreet's systems were sold without written license agreements. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will not be involved in litigation with respect thereto or that the outcome of any such litigation 19\n\nmight not be more unfavorable to the Combined Company as a result of such omissions. Discreet uses both software and hardware keys with respect to its systems and software but otherwise does not copy-protect its systems and software. It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy Discreet's products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that Discreet regards as proprietary. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company's competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to Discreet's technologies. Risks Associated with Recent Acquisitions and Investments; Restatement of Financial Statements. Each of Autodesk and Discreet periodically acquires or invests in businesses, software products and technologies which are complementary to its business through acquisitions, strategic alliances, debt and equity investments, joint ventures and the like. For example, on March 31, 1997, Autodesk acquired Softdesk, Inc. (\"Softdesk\"), a leading supplier of AutoCAD-based software for the architecture, engineering and construction market, and on May 4, 1998, acquired the mechanical applications business of Genius CAD Software GmbH (\"Genius\"), a German limited liability company. In addition, Discreet in fiscal 1997 and 1998 completed three acquisitions: the assets of Denim Software L.L.C., D-Vision Systems, Inc. and Lightscape Technologies, Inc. The risks associated with these and other potential acquisitions or investments include, among others, the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the companies, the failure to realize anticipated synergies and the diversion of management's time and attention. In addition, such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transaction-related costs. There can be no assurance that Autodesk or Discreet will be successful in overcoming such risks or that such investments and acquisitions will not have a material adverse impact upon the Combined Company's business, financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In addition, such investments and acquisitions may contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to acquisition- related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, any of which could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause lack of consistency from quarter to quarter in the Combined Company's operating results or financial condition. Both the Softdesk and Genius acquisitions were accounted for by Autodesk as business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, \"Accounting for Business Combinations,\" the costs of these acquisitions were allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed (including in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\")) based on their estimated fair values using valuation methods believed to be appropriate at the time. The amounts allocated to in- process research and development of $55.1 and $28.8 million for Softdesk and Genius, respectively, were expensed in the periods in which the acquisitions were consummated in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, \"Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method.\" Subsequent to the Securities and Exchange Commission's letter to the AICPA dated September 9, 1998, regarding its views on in-process research and development, the Company has re-evaluated its IPR&D charges on the Softdesk and Genius acquisitions, revised the purchase price allocations and restated its financial statements. As a result, Autodesk made adjustments to decrease the amounts previously expensed as IPR&D and increase the amounts capitalized as goodwill and other intangibles relating to the Softdesk and Genius acquisitions by $35.9 and $15.7 million, respectively. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Attraction and Retention of Employees. The continued growth and success of the Combined Company depends significantly on the continued service of highly skilled employees. In particular, Discreet's success to date has depended to a significant extent upon a number of key management and technical employees, the loss of any of whom could have a material adverse effect on Discreet's business and results of operations. Competition for these employees in today's marketplace, especially in the technology industries, is intense. The Combined Company's ability to attract and retain 20\n\nemployees is dependent on a number of factors including its continued ability to grant stock incentive awards. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be successful in continuing to recruit new personnel and to retain existing personnel. The loss of one or more key employees or the Combined Company's inability to maintain existing employees or recruit new employees could have a material adverse impact on the Combined Company. In addition, the Combined Company may experience increased compensation costs to attract and retain skilled personnel. Impact of Year 2000. Some of the computer programs used by Autodesk and Discreet in their internal operations rely on time-sensitive software that was written using two digits rather than four to identify the applicable year. These programs may recognize a date using \"00\" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among other things, a temporary inability to process including, among other transactions, send invoices, or engage in similar normal business activities. Autodesk is currently in the remediation or fourth phase of a six-phase year 2000 compliance program related to information technology (\"IT\") systems and expects to complete this phase by the end of fiscal year 1999. The remaining two phases are expected to be virtually complete by the end of Autodesk's fiscal year 1999 with minor testing and risk mitigation activities being performed through the end of calendar year 1999. As of October 31, 1998, Autodesk had spent approximately $4 million on the IT year 2000 project, of which approximately $300,000 had been capitalized. Autodesk expects to spend an additional $2 million to $3 million to complete this project. All expenditures to date have been captured either in prior year or current year budgets. Autodesk believes that the key components of the IT year 2000 project have either been replaced or remediated. Further, Autodesk estimates that if any component of the current systems fail due to year 2000 related issues, Autodesk would be able to divert people and systems traffic, causing delays of between one to three days in service interruptions and processing Autodesk information. Autodesk has a contingency plan in place in order to prevent the loss of critical data which includes the back up of all critical data processing interactions and a disaster recovery plan. There can be no assurance, however, that there will not be a delay in the completion of these procedures or that the cost of such procedures will not exceed original estimates, either of which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations. In addition to correcting the business and operating systems used by Autodesk in the ordinary course of business as described above, Autodesk has also reviewed its non-IT systems to determine year 2000 compliance of these systems. Autodesk is in a monitoring program that continually checks the status of all non-IT systems and does not anticipate an adverse impact on service and business capabilities with regard to these non-IT systems. Expenditures related to these monitoring procedures have been minimal and are not expected to be significant in future periods. Autodesk has also tested and continues to test all products it currently produces internally for sale to third parties to determine year 2000 compliance. As of October 31, 1998, Autodesk has spent approximately $300,000 on the first two phases of a three-phase year 2000 compliance testing program related to its products and expects to spend an additional $1.2 to $1.7 million to complete this project. Products currently sold by Autodesk either have been found to be substantially compliant or are currently being tested for compliance. However, many Autodesk products run on operating systems or hardware produced and sold by third-party vendors. There can be no assurance that these operating systems or hardware will be converted in a timely manner, or at all, and any failure in this regard may cause Autodesk products not to function as designed. Autodesk will continue to evaluate each product in the currently supported inventory. Discreet has made preliminary assessments of its products and information systems and has determined that they are year 2000 compliant, or that only a limited effort will be required to achieve compliance. Discreet is currently proceeding with detailed reviews of every application used. It is expected that some will have to be upgraded to year 2000 compliant applications. It is expected that some customers may experience some difficulties related to non- Discreet products, which may affect 21\n\nthe performance of Discreet products and, therefore, lead to an unusually high number of calls to the Discreet technical support department. Any future costs associated with ensuring that Autodesk's products or the products of Autodesk's Discreet business unit are compliant with the year 2000 are not expected to have a material impact on the Combined Company's results of operations or financial position. Commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation may arise out of year 2000 compliance issues, and Autodesk and Discreet are aware of a growing number of lawsuits against other software vendors. Because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation, it is uncertain whether and to what extent Autodesk and Discreet may be affected by it. Single European Currency. Autodesk and Discreet are in the process of addressing the issues raised by the introduction of the single European currency (\"Euro\") as of January 1, 1999 and during the transition period ending January 1, 2002. Autodesk and Discreet will continue to modify the internal systems that will be affected by this conversion during fiscal year 2000, and do not expect the costs of further system modifications to be material. There can be no assurance, however, that Autodesk and Discreet will be able to complete such modifications to comply with Euro requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on Autodesk's and Discreet's operating results. Autodesk is currently evaluating the impact of the introduction of the Euro on its foreign exchange and hedging activities, functional currency designations, and pricing strategies in the new economic environment. In addition, Autodesk and Discreet face risks to the extent that banks and vendors upon whom they rely and their suppliers are unable to make appropriate modifications to support Autodesk's and Discreet's operations with respect to Euro transactions. While Autodesk and Discreet will continue to evaluate the impact of the Euro, management does not believe its introduction will have a material adverse effect upon Autodesk's and Discreet's results of operations or financial condition. Dependence on Single Workstation Vendor. Discreet's flame*, effect*, inferno*, fire*, smoke* and frost* systems currently include workstations manufactured by Silicon Graphics, Inc. (\"SGI\"). There are significant risks associated with this reliance on SGI, and the Combined Company may be impacted by the timing of the development and release of products by SGI, as was the case during fiscal 1996 when the announcement by SGI of a new Onyx workstation caused Discreet to offer substantial discounts and other favorable terms regarding its then current inventory of SGI workstations. In addition, there may be unforeseen difficulties associated with adapting Discreet's products to future SGI products. Discreet is an authorized master VAR of workstations manufactured by SGI. Discreet's agreement with SGI is subject to annual renewal in May of each year and termination by SGI for cause. The agreement with SGI has been extended through December 31, 1998 and Discreet has no reason to believe that SGI will not renew such agreement. In addition, although Discreet has no reason to believe that it will be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of SGI workstations on a timely basis or that its status as a master VAR will be changed, there can be no assurance that the Combined Company will continue to be able to procure such workstations in sufficient quantities or on a timely basis or that SGI will continue to recognize the Combined Company as a master VAR. The success of Autodesk's Discreet business unit also depends, in part, on the continued market acceptance of SGI workstations by consumers in general, and by the professional film and video industries, in particular. Although the Combined Company intends to continue to evaluate new hardware platforms and may adapt its products as technological advances and market demands dictate, Discreet and Autodesk believe that Autodesk's Discreet business unit will continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenue for the foreseeable future from the sale and maintenance of systems designed to include SGI workstations. As a result, financial, market and other developments adversely affecting SGI or the sales of workstations, the introduction or acquisition by SGI of products which are competitive with those of Discreet, or the unanticipated timing or pricing of SGI products that could cause customers to defer the decision to buy or determine not to buy the Autodesk Discreet business unit's then available products or systems, could have an adverse effect upon the Combined Company's business and results of operations, as was the case with respect to Discreet for the three month period ended January 31, 1996. As a master VAR, Discreet also obtains certain advance access to SGI technology 22\n\nin order to develop compatible systems and to modify and improve existing products. If the Combined Company were unable to obtain such advance access, it could have an adverse impact on the Combined Company's business and results of operations. Reliance on Sole Source Suppliers. Discreet is dependent on SGI as Discreet's sole source for video input/output cards used in Discreet's systems. Discreet is also dependent on a single workstation vendor. See \"-- Dependence on Single Workstation Vendor.\" Discreet also purchases electronic tablets manufactured by Wacom Technology Corporation and believes that while alternative suppliers are available, there can be no assurance that alternative electronic tablets would be functionally equivalent or be available on a timely basis or on similar terms. Discreet generally purchases sole source or other components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business and has no written agreements or guaranteed supply arrangements with its sole source suppliers. Discreet has experienced quality control problems and supply shortages for sole source components in the past and there can be no assurance that the Combined Company will not experience significant quality control problems or supply shortages for these components in the future. Discreet does not maintain an extensive inventory of these components, and an interruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on Discreet's business and results of operations. Because of Discreet's reliance on these suppliers, Discreet may also be subject to increases in component costs which could adversely affect the Combined Company's business and results of operations. 23\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the 3,000,000 shares offered by the Company hereby are estimated to be approximately $117.6 million (or $135.3 million if the Underwriters exercise the overallotment option in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company expects such proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The primary motivation for the timing of the offering is to qualify the Transactions for pooling of interests accounting treatment. The Company previously repurchased certain shares of its Common Stock pursuant to an existing repurchase program. In order to qualify the Transactions for pooling of interests treatment, the Company is required to issue approximately 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock before the closing of the Transactions. The Common Stock offered hereby will not be issued unless and until all conditions to the Transactions have been satisfied or waived. In addition to the reasons described above, the Company believes that the availability of substantial financial resources is an important competitive factor in the software industry, where many of the Company's competitors have significantly greater resources. The offering will strengthen the Company's financial position and provide the Company with additional financial flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities as they may arise. Such opportunities could include the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies, although there are currently no agreements or understandings with respect to any material acquisition other than the Transactions. The Company plans to invest the net proceeds in income producing obligations pending their use. 24\n\nCAPITALIZATION The following table sets forth (i) the capitalization of the Company as of October 31, 1998, (ii) the pro forma capitalization giving effect to the Transactions, and (iii) the pro forma capitalization as adjusted to reflect the issuance and sale by the Company of the 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock offered hereby.

Autodesk paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share with respect to fiscal 1997 and 1998 and the first three quarters of fiscal 1999, and currently intends to continue paying such cash dividends on a quarterly basis. 26\n\nTHE TRANSACTIONS The business combination between Autodesk and Discreet will be effected pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement entered into among the Company, Discreet, Autodesk Development B.V. (\"Dutchco\"), 9066-9771 Quebec Inc. (\"Amalgamation Sub\"), Autodesk Canada Inc. and 9066-9854 Quebec Inc. (\"Autodesk Quebec\"). Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Dutchco, a wholly- owned subsidiary of the Company, will acquire Discreet by way of an Amalgamation under Quebec law and certain related transactions. Discreet will be amalgamated with Autodesk Quebec and Amalgamation Sub to form \"New Discreet,\" which will carry on the existing business of Discreet as an indirect subsidiary of Autodesk. Each holder of Discreet Common Shares will receive in the Transactions either 0.33 shares of Autodesk Common Stock or 0.33 exchangeable non-voting shares of New Discreet. The exchangeable shares of New Discreet issued in the Transactions will be exchangeable at any time at the option of the holder, and will automatically be exchanged on the eleventh anniversary of the closing of the Transactions (or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Autodesk or New Discreet), for Common Stock of Autodesk on a one-for-one basis. Based on the capitalizations of Autodesk and Discreet as of December 31, 1998, Autodesk expects to issue approximately 9.9 million shares of Common Stock of to the shareholders of Discreet in the Transactions, which shares will represent approximately 16.5% of the Common Stock outstanding after the Transactions, assuming the issuance of the 3 million shares offered hereby.
