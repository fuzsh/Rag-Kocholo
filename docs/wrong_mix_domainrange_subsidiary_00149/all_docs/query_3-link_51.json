We are very excited to begin building this community together, so to get started, we encourage you to use this topic to introduce yourself and get to know other members.\n\nReply to this post, and tell us a little more about yourself. We also encourage you to customize your profile with a photo and short description of who you are and why you are here.\n\nAdditionally, pin yourself on our course map (or by clicking on the 'Map' button on the top banner).\n\n-- LCL Team\n\nGreetings Earthlings!\n\nMy name is Griffin, which is my mother's maiden name and the name of a half-lion half-eagle mythical creature which was first introduced by the Egyptians around 3300BC. I'm currently a student in the International Education Policy program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and working at the Media Lab.\n\nI have a background in investment banking and playing drums. I worked for UNICEF in Kyrgyzstan, am good friends with a black bear, and once drove a school bus from London to Ulan Bator. I'm planning on making a film this summer about Scottish Independence.\n\nI consider it an honor to work with a team who is equally committed to pushing the limits of achieving meaningful collaboration online and I look forward to seeing where this adventure takes all of us. Laissez les bons temps rouler!\n\nMy name is Philipp. I am interested in how people make deep connections with each through learning - mostly online. I design and create online learning tools and communities. I am also interested in how people make deep connections through food (but that's for another time). In 2009 I founded Peer 2 Peer University with 4 friends, when we realized that it was possible to learn anything online, if you had a few friends to learn with (and really hard without the friends).\n\nI've lived on three continents and travelled on 5. I moved to Boston from Cape Town and am now happily based at the MIT Media Lab, but my dad's family is from southern Hungary and you never know when my Gypsie roots will call again.\n\nI have a weakness for old cars and believe the perfect number of old cars to own is N+1, where N is the number of old cars you currently own. I currently own a 1967 Mercedes that is standing in a garage in Germany and which I haven't driven for 15 years.\n\nLCL2 will be fun!\n\nMy name is Aya Jennifer Sakaguchi - or AJ for short. I am currently a Master's student studying Technology, Innovation, and Education at Harvard Graduate School of Education. I am particularly interested in the relationship between online/offline learning environments. I am also a Resident at the Harvard Innovation Lab, where I am developing a mobile learning application to bring student curiosities into the classroom. My background is in media and education, and I've worked at YouTube as well as a start-up film festival in Palo Alto, California.\n\nI am living in Massachusetts now, but I have also lived in Maine, France, and California. I speak English, Japanese, and French. My favorite song right now is \"I've Got a Feeling\" by the Beatles. My goal this year is to be a better surfer and snow-shoer!\n\nHi all, my name is Adriano and I live in Roma, Italy. I'm currently working at educational projects about Creative Computing and Educational Robotics, to be proposed mainly for afterschool activities.\n\nAfter a twenty-year career as telecommunication engineer in multinational companies (Cap Gemini Group and Ericsson), I said to myself: it's time to change. Around a table with a few friends, one day we asked ourselves: - What about to set up an eLearning company? Yes , let's do it . It was a great experience, and when you work for your own company, your work is handyman. But after three years it was time to change again: technological consultancy and web. In the meantime, I decided to not to leave anymore ideas to rot in the drawer. So, for instance, I have created and self published, GeoFilm Roma, a book about movies filmed in Rome, that uses QR codes to provide multimedia content via smartphones. But it was time to change again. I have been fascinated by Educational Robotics and after attending the first edition of LCL I have discovered the power of Creative Computing, Scratch and Tinkering in education. So, I have decided to start a new life as educator for facilitating STEAM competences in young people and not only\n\nI am passionate about history,numismatics, astronomy...\n\nI'm a maker and I like... try to guess > 3 things I like\n\nCIAO\n\nWow, lots of pressure to be creative here\n\nI'm Andy Davidson, currently on the faculty at the University of Washington in the department of Human-Centered Design & Engineering. I know, it's a mouthful, but I didn't coin it. We focus on user-centered design processes to solve problems using new technologies and systems.\n\nI'm interested in physical computing, specialize in prototyping systems using Arduino, and teach a variety of courses in our BS and MS programs. I also taught high school computer science for a few years and had tremendous success using Scratch and Processing and Arduino to get kids interested in computing and STE(A)M fields.\n\nNow I use it to try to inspire kids of all ages!\n\nBefore joining the UW a few years ago, I had taught at Art Center College of Design and also at Interaction Design Institute Ivrea. I'm looking forward to learning and inspiration from this group in the coming weeks.\n\n.andy\n\nfaculty.washington.edu/adavid7\n\nHi my name is Malcolm, I am a \"graduate\" of the first LCL course. Like all great learning it changed and transformed me and I feel it will do the same for all of you.\n\nI have been asked to be a part of the second \"journey\" by the LCL team, to help in online discussions and give support in whatever way I can. I am very happy to do this and know that I will learn so much more from you all in the weeks ahead.\n\nAs a brief introduction to myself, I am a retired teacher, headteacher and Primary Mathematics Consultant living in the U.K. I regularly blog about \"lifelong learning\" and have a real interest in the the importance of recent developments in neuroscience and technology to transform education from where it currently lies in the past to where it us capable of getting to.\n\nI look forward to our online discussions and wish you well in your future growth.\n\nAhoy!\n\nI'm the head of tech at Palisades Charter High School, and independent charter of nearly 3000 students from around LA County. In January we opened our makerspace, the Pali STEAM Shop (http://palisteamshop.org), in an ex-industrial arts classroom with high ceilings, good ventilation, great view of the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\nWe have two student groups using the Pali STEAM Shop this term: our MESA elective (http://mesa.ucop.edu) and our VEX robotics club. The space is lightly furnished as we are still fundraising and we are considering a “make the makerspace” summer class for students who want to help design & build out the room. Next year we are planning to offer five courses in the STEAM Shop: intro electronics (Arduino, Pi, wearable tech, interactive art), Robotics 1 (DIY thru Mindstorms), Robotics 2 (3D design and humanitarian engineering), Intro to Computer Science, and additional sections of MESA.\n\nI graduated from the HGSE TIE program in 2003 and have been pulling Media Lab tools into classes ever since. I enjoyed LCLv1 as it prompted me to reconnect to some of my favorite foundational texts and I’m excited to be part of LCLv2.\n\nCheers,\n\nDonna\n\nHello,\n\nI am Senada, currently living and working as a psychologist and clicnic mgmt assistant in Munich, Germany.\n\nI was part of the first LCL group, but had unfortunately little time back then to actively participate - hope, though, to be able to contribute and take part regularly this time (am normally still working when the online meeting takes place...).\n\nCurrently I am interested in learning more about creative learning, so that I can use the knowledge for further developing and creating new learning tools/platforms for online courses and trainings in the health sector.\n\nSerious games are too getting more and more interesting for me, as they wonderfully allow to merge fun, education, training, self-development and personal growth.\n\nSo! Am looking forward to this adventure and yes! - would love to become friends (at FB e.g.) and to exchange ideas, impulses and inspiration!\n\nWishing you and me a lovely day -\n\nSenada\n\nHello, my name is James. I loved the last LCL, and am excited about LCL2. I have yet to explore Lego WeDo or Pico, but I am still enjoying Scratch, MaKey MaKey, and TurtleArt. The biggest and most valuable takeaway for me from LCL was how it changed and enhanced my perception of creative learning.\n\nI am an artist and a tinkerer. I enjoy creating, sharing, and perusing digital art, paintings, photography, fractal images, a wide range of other visual arts, music of varying genre, haiku, other poetry forms, fiction, nonfiction, humor, amateur video games, collages, and basically anything arts and crafts. I am also learning about Arduino, RaspPi, 3D printing, laser cutting, metalworking, woodworking, and whatever else I can dive into. I am multimodal and enjoy learning from collaborative workshops at my local Makerspace, books, YouTube/Vimeo tutorials, digital DIY guide, MOOCs, or whatever else I get my hands on. This leads me to awesome adventures such as LCL.\n\nI'm also here as a parent of learners and because I would like to help develop future educational technologies with creative learning in mind.\n\nI'm excited about LCL2! Nice to meet you all (and nice to see some of you again!)\n\nHello, all my professional life I've been working in educational stuff, but I'm not a teacher, I'm a consultant for teaching materials for use in education.\n\nMost of time I have seen nice and well designed products and I have seen too well designed teaching methodologies that take advantage of they. Behind of both (materials and methodologies) I have seen always good teachers, people who likes their work. But sometimes I have found bad materials, bad methodologies, frustrated teachers and unhappy students.\n\nThis background had encourage me to know something more about teaching and learning process, to talk a lot with teachers and to try to live closely their experiencies.\n\nNowadays I work with educational robotics and I try to help teachers to introduce this concept in the curricula as a motivational tool to learn other topics and to estimulate multiple intelligences.\n\nHi all - my day job is the Knowledge Ninja...wait just the Knowledge Manager of the Intel Computer Clubhouse Network but I've been on a long learning journey to this point - former Clubhouse Coordinator, AmeriCorps VISTA working in community media & tech centers, urban planning and civic media at MIT, then BTOP/digital literacy work out of Washington DC. I'm back in my home turf of Boston, and working on the Networks' social networking website, the ClubhouseVillage.org, for youth to post digital media and tech projects and collaborate with other staff and mentors around the world. AND lately I'm an advocate for Clubhouses to integrate more \"making\" activities in their Clubhouses...or just showing that they've been doing it all along but just calling it arts/crafts/engineering/DIY/design/fun. I ghosted around last year's LCL both online and in-person since then at the monthly Boston area meetups when I can.\n\nIn my free time, I like to bake when my oven's not broken and volunteer with local community arts and planning events. Right now, I can't stop listening to the LEGO Movie song...Everything really is AWESOME.\n\nHi i'm Ricardo Otake, born and raised in Brazil. But I live in Hawaii now, working at the University of the Nations, to train missionaries all over the world. I'm very interested in learning more about Learning Technologies, flipping the classroom and using technology to bring education to people in remote places.\n\nI love to travel, and learn about different cultures and worldviews.\n\nMy background is in Electrical Engineering. I had experience with LabVIEW computer programming, in the are of biomedical Engineering. I helped develop an Electric Impedance Tomograph at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\nI joined the program last year but i wasn't able to keep up with the program as other projects came and too my time away.\n\nI[m looking forward to know more people with similar interests in using technology in the area of education and Learning !\n\nAloha !\n\nI am Peter, a return LCL'er. Last year I did many of the projects (see, e.g., my scratch animation, which conveys the challenges of learning and teaching when we have to take initiative in and through relationships, http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3127303/ ), but the center of my tinkering was around running communities that support deep learning in connectivist MOOCs. Learning from failed prototypes based on google+ hangouts ( http://wp.me/p1gwfa-vN ), a group of us initiated \"Collaborative explorations,\" which have continued online almost each month since ( http://collabex.wikispaces.com ).\n\nThis direction of development takes note of how the computer clubs (highlighted in LCL) create supportive, face-to-face relations that support tinkering within some structure. (The structure for computer clubs is given by the technological tools; the structure for collaborative explorations adapts a \"five-phase format,\" http://bit.ly/FivePhase, for thinking, talking, listening, and reflecting.)\n\nThe time spent in LCL and Collaborative Explorations has been very generative in my thinking and learning as well as in my teaching and advising as a professor, where I am challenged to provide \"students with knowledge, tools, experience, and support so they can become constructive, reflective agents of change in education, work, social movements, science, and creative arts\" (UMass Boston's graduate program in Critical & Creative Thinking, http://www.cct.umb.edu). My explorations are chronicled in my Probe-Create Change-Reflect blog, http://pcrcr.wordpress.com. I look forward to connecting with LCL veterans and newcomers to continue these explorations, especially through the events described on another post, at http://discuss-learn.media.mit.edu/t/think-listen-share-on-our-learning-process-in-the-lcl2-mooc/177\n\nHi, I'm Brendan. I lurked a bit in LCL1, and I've taken part in a few other edu-MOOCs, like Ed Startup 101 and Designing a New Learning Environment (DNLE.) I'm excited to see LCL run again, and I'm planning to more fully participate this time around. These forums look like a good start, and I really like the fact that they're open before a fixed start date.\n\nSome of my background:\n\nI really didn't like most of my formal education, and I particularly felt like most of middle school, and all of high school was a waste of time. I've met many others who feel the same way, especially through the support forums on School-Survival.net (which also has a small G+ community.)\n\nMany of the young people there are very interested in learning, but find school to be a barren, oppressive, and even hostile environment. In contrast, especially over the past couple years, I've met a lot of educators through various MOOCs, G+, and so on who are interested in transforming education to be learner-centric, interest-based, and overall completely different than so-called \"factory model\" schools that remain the unquestionable norm for many people.\n\nPerhaps the best single video I've found that sums up the problems with factory-model schools is Ken Robinson's RSA Animate - Changing Education Paradigms talk. Despite having over 11 million views, millions of young people are stuck in learning environments that they find to be the antithesis of learning... without any real means or standing to initiate substantive conversations about doing things differently.\n\nI think these edu-MOOCs have great promise in helping to facilitate discussions about transforming education to be interesting, relevant, and supportive... but huge gulfs still remain. I'm very interesting to see how LCL2 can help bridge some of those gulfs.\n\nGreetings. My name is Qazi Fazli Azeem, I am a Fulbright Scholar from Pakistan at MassArts Dynamic Media Institute, and a visiting graduate researcher at the MIT Media Lab. I did last years LCL course, and it was the most fun I have had in years. I went overboard in my writing assignment, due to so many interesting prompts and examples, learning from my classmates and international forum posters. I am the south asian self advocate for the Autism spectrum, I presented at the UN in NY for last years Autism awareness day. My current thesis is about inclusive technologies to help learners with multiple and special learning styles. I believe in the potential of online and open educational materials. I saw LCL grow from being an online course in to a vibrant community, where people shared their creative creations from all over the world. I may not be able to attend all the sessions, but will try to attend most of them. Good luck to the new co-learners and students.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI am Maria, an ICT and CS teacher from Greece. I teach programming and digital literacy to children and teens and I love that. I am here because I think that it's nice to share experiences and ideas with people that share the same passion as you. I am delighted to see so many people with so many different backgrounds. It is the first time for me that I particiapate in an on-line course like that, and I am curious to know how it will turn out.\n\nI like to mix art, creativity and innovative teaching methods with computers. I believe the result is awesome. I am here for the exchange of new ideas, for the dialogue and for the exploration.\n\nMaria\n\nhello! i'm kate. (my pronouns are they/them, so please use them if you talk about me!) i'm from about 1/2 an hour south of boston. i've recently applied to grad school/a postbac program to be a high school art teacher, and right now i work at a really fun administrative job in higher ed. so that's where i'm at right now.\n\ni think one of the reasons i struggled with lcl the last go-around (and, let's face it, my entire educational career) was because i didn't really understand that i learned differently. lcl did get me thinking about that. although i don't have access to a definitive diagnosis, i am positive i have nonverbal learning disorder. it would be neat to hear from anyone else with nvld, especially people with learning disabilities who became teachers themselves.\n\nHi everyone\n\nI am Kevin Hodgson, and I teach sixth grade out in Western Massachusetts, and I am part of the Western Massachusetts Writing Project. I'm here in LCL to continue my own exploration of Connected Learning and composing with new media, building on some of the work we did this past summer with the Making Learning Connected MOOC project.\n\nAs a writer, I tinker and play with technology and writing quite a bit, and some of that tinkering makes its way into my classroom. Not all, but some. I am fascinated by the ways in which our views of writing is changing, and how we are in the midst of this change, trying to make sense of it even as the ground continues to shift.\n\nI blog at Kevin's Meandering Mind and tweet as @dogtrax, and collaborate whenever the chance arises. I hope to play here, too. Of that, I have no doubt.\n\nKevin\n\nHi Sandy, many things in common, then. I have been teaching at the elementary school , too, for the last 4 years. It's so nice to work with very young children! They have such a vivid imagination. Perhaps less skillful, but so creative! I enjoy so much to immense into their chaotic sentimental universe.\n\nAnd I 've also changed many jobs till turning into a teacher, always around technology though. Once I used to be a database engineer, then I did some project management for a couple of years for educational technology projects, then I taught java at the university and finally I am here at the elementary school as an ICT and CS teacher and as a mom of two boys 8 and 11 years old.\n\nHope to have time to explore new teaching ideas together,\n\nmaria\n\nHello everyone, my name is Emily (21) and I reside in Missouri with my wonderful husband, June will be our two year anniversary. I am fun and outgoing with inspiration to learn and improve myself. I was in LCL one and was too shy to participate. I am currently a personal aide for my sister in law, soon to be an office manger for a St. Louis company to help better their business and gain experience. I am excited to find that this course is offered again for free and expect to learn as much I am able. I have been enjoying reading all of your introductions and can't wait for this course!\n\nHallo,\n\nmy name is Melissa and I'm from Genoa (Italy). I'm an informatic engeneer and I worked as programmer and analyzer in some industrial company but now I'm unemployed. I have two little children (3 and 6 yaers old) and also thanks to them last year I discovered the educational robotics and the big potentiality that these tools and metodologies have in the educational process and I'm very fascinated about it.\n\nAt the moment I'm teaching, as an after school laboratory, Scratch and wedo to a class of 12-13 years old boys, and I'm also experimenting some activity about the water cycle and the Bee Bot in a kindergarten.\n\nThis is the first time for me to follow a real on line course and I'm very excited. I don't know exactly what to expect from this new experience but I have great expectation about it. Thank you for that chance...\n\nNice to meet you all!\n\nMy name is Alejandro. I live on Gran Canaria, one of the Canary Islands, Spain.\n\nI've been jack of many trades.\n\nI think, professionally I've been the most creative as furniture designer/cabinetmaker. As a front-end developer I've participate mainly in ordinary projects, where I put my creativity to work caring about standards, good practices, semantic web, and refactoring.\n\nI've been always curious and passionate about knowledge in any area: science, arts, et cetera. Since my first one, 18 months ago, I became a MOOCs-maniac.\n\nI'm curious about learning creative learning.\n\nI feel a bit anxious because I've spoken English very, very little for many years and I don't know how will it go on during Hangouts. I appreciate fluency a lot and I wonder if I will be able to accomplish it.\n\nI like surfing, photography and doodling.\n\nHi all:\n\nMy name is Elijah. I am a science educator, currently out on long-term medical leave. Hopefully this means I'll have time to really enjoy this course. I loved it last time around, but my participation eventually dwindled due to work pressures. Once I get the health issues figured out, I'm looking at transitioning more into my photography and natural science education business (Whimbrel Nature) and also other non-traditional formats for promoting science education, creativity, and making.\n\nAs I said, I'm an avid nature photographer. You can check out my work at www.bestnatureimages.com. I'm a birder and for my PhD I studied improvisational song learning in birds. Here are a few random interesting facts about me:\n\n-I spent a season (and a few more weeks later on) banding hawks and owls at Cape May, NJ (owl banding focused on the tiny saw-whet owl)\n\n-I had a very brief speaking part with Alan Alda (in a Scientific American Frontiers episode focusing on my advisor's research)\n\n-I was a 1992 delegate to the National Youth Science Camp in WV (and spent many years working on staff there)\n\n-I love the outdoors and have at least tried most outdoor sports, among my favorites are hiking, camping, whitewater kayaking, and caving.\n\nGreetings People of the LCL2 Persuasion...I'm Shari, I am an international development professional specializing in the area of Social Change throughout Africa and Asia. I participated in the inaugural LCL1 last year and it greatly impacted how I approach and carry out my social change work. In particular, another colleague and I took what we learned here last year, and re-designed how we approach creating learning environments, as well as re-tooling how we design actual learning events. I work following what's called Human Rights-Based Approaches (HRBA for those who want to add another acronym to their list), and the creative learning principles I learned last time really helped me re-think what \"learning\" is and the differences between training, teaching and learning.\n\nI am really excited to being this second round of LCL, and see what this iteration brings forth.\n\nHi. My name is Chris and I am the Dean of Students and Director of the Full STEAM program at a 7-12 college preparatory school in Los Angeles. In my job, I work with teachers to create courses that blend their unique passions with the skills that our students will need for the jobs of tomorrow. My hope for the future is that learning never has to feel like school for teachers or students. To be innovative, playful, inspiring and entrepreneurial is all that I ask of my students, my teachers and myself.\n\nI am blessed to have three beautiful girls, my wife and two young daughters, to spend my time away from school with.\n\nI look forward to working with and getting to know the amazing group of educators at the LCL!\n\nChris\n\nHello there!\n\nI am Aruna Sankaranarayanan, but I've learnt from experience that it's better to introduce myself just as Aruna. I work at a startup called Brainwave, a science magazine, where I am currently working on gamifying all the magzine content for a new online project. I absolutely love my job!\n\nI always happen to find education projects that I want to be involved in. I did some work with the Oracle Think.com project in high school, and happened to find this lovely book, Algorithms Unplugged in college that I loved! I think all of this has a little bit to do with me reading Toto-Chan when I was in 7th grade, and feeling more than a little affectionate about the book.\n\nI am a huge open-source enthusiast and have been part of both local linux users groups in Bangalore and organisations like the GNOME Foundation and KDE. My local linux users group runs a few community computing centers to bridge the digital divide between underprivileged children and under-represented groups here in India. I am particularly interested in using LCL2 at these centers, along with activities from Computer Science Unplugged which we plan to implement.\n\nI am a huge fan of the Media Lab projects having used Processing and Arduino extensively for quite a while now. I am really excited about the LCL2 because I wasn't part of LCL last year and don't know what to expect.\n\nHappy learning!\n\nHello people from MIT and fellow participants,\n\nI am a teacher by passion and profession teaching in India for the past 5 years, with focus on English and Literature, but also a mix of other things to adolescents. I have been blessed to be in association with people who enjoy teaching, and are attentive to learning how to teach and teaching adults and children how they learn.\n\nI also run a slum initiative in Ahmedabad, India, which has been teaching a small group of urban slum children for the past 4 years.\n\nKnowing a few people from MIT media lab, a few MIT alumni as friends and a boyfriend who is a '13 pass out from MIT has allowed me a very intimate insight on the 'hack' mentality of MITians. And I absolutely adore the intuitive, self immersing, mistake friendly, no-nonsense approach MIT has towards learning!!!\n\nHere is hoping this online 'experiment' gains fruition, and that this course benefits the likes of me, people hungry to learn, but can't afford coming to MIT.\n\nLove,\n\nVishwa Srivastava\n\nEducator,\n\nAhmedabad, India\n\nVishwapallav@gmail.com\n\nHello!\n\nI wish this course introduces me to the tangible as well as intangible tools to interpret activities involving children and computing.\n\nI am a computer scientist and programmer working in Information Retrieval (IR). Of the many sub topics in IR, say, speech, video and text, I focus on text retrieval. The idea of helping children build computational structures in their minds attracts me, so in my spare time I try to work with children, observing them play with computers, and learn. In India, I used to help out a group of friends run a home-school for girls, and a children's club on Sunday evenings. Now that work has brought me to the US, I try to find time to volunteer in the DC area. Some months back I helped out at the Mini Maker Faire organised by the Kid Museum at Silver Spring in Maryland. Next week I'll be working with the Kid Museum again, at their WSSC H20 Water Event and Rockville Science Day.\n\nHi all!\n\nMy name is Megan and I currently work for an awesome organization, based in Cape Town, called Siyavula. Siyavula is an Nguni word meaning \"we are opening\" as we produce openly licensed maths and science resources for school learners in South Africa. I am the Content Coordinator and was responsible for producing the Gr 4-6 content in 2012 (www.thunderboltkids.co.za) and the Gr 7-9 Natural Sciences content last year.\n\nI am passionate about making science and maths fun, engaging, stimulating, enticing, and importantly, openly accessible, to young minds.\n\nThis year at Siyavula I am looking at how to take our current content for Gr 4-9 to the next level, in terms of interactivity and online learning tools that we want to develop. I am really looking forward to engaging with this community and course to see what I can learn to help what I am doing at Siyavula, but also to feed and stimulate my own mind!\n\nHello everybody,\n\nI am Mohona Bose, currently working in the Information Technology department of Legal & General America, Maryland. After doing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering I have served the IT industry for past 6 years. Now that I've got a work-life balance, I feel it's high time to carry out my passion which has always been with kids and making education interesting for them.\n\nI have taught kids earlier during my college days and also in an evening school named \"We care\" - http://wecare.sdf.org/ after office, while in India. After coming to the US, I have been to the Silver Spring Maker Fair, worked there as a volunteer, worked with the Kid's team in the UMD lab and looking forward to more such opportunities that involve children, computing and education. One such coming next week is : http://kid-museum.org/upcoming-wssc-h2o-water-event-and-rockville-science-day/.\n\nIt was a wonderful experience meeting Mitch in person and I am eager to go through this session arranged by mit media lab. I am super excited to be a part of it. Unfortunately due to office schedule, I'll miss the first day session. But I shall try my best to attend all the ones that come after this.\n\nHi, my name is Sachin and I am joining this group from India. As a day job, I lead Learning & Development for one of the big 4 consulting firms based here. Over the past 16 years, I have helped hotels, banks, tech giants and internet retailers, drive up human potential. Each of these have been equally exciting and fun places to work\n\nI am based in Hyderabad in the southern part of the country. I experiment and experience different learning methods such as MOOCs, board game simulations, immersive VR etc. I love technology and how it is changing the world around us and its social fabric. I read a lot and spend almost all my remaining spare time with my 3 year old, wondering about the capabilities of the human brain.\n\nI am sure that LCL2 will be great fun for me and for others! Looking forward to interacting with all of you.\n\nHey All!\n\nI'm Jeff Sweeton- a technology educator in Chicago working with various groups including CodeCreate, The Center for Talent Development at Northwestern University and a church on the West Side. I'm also a freelance filmmaker and former Clubhouse Coordinator- I can attest first-hand to the inspiration that this approach to learning breeds! As a filmmaker and artist, I was pretty disengaged in science and math classes growing up and, discovering the Media Lab and its ideas, I realized I could command these skills too: it then became clear to me that all creativity is really universal.\n\nI tried to join you all for the 2nd LCL but got kicked off the server: I've got to run now to help a student recording a documentary but I look forward to reading again what you all are doing!\n\nMy name is Bob Kahn and teach middle school science and robotics. I have been teaching in private K-12 schools for over 20 years in mostly the \"traditional\" way. An online course that I took in the Summer of 2011 rocked my world. Last summer, I attended the MIT Science and Engineering Program for Teachers. Without a doubt it was the most quintessential educational experience of my life, as a teacher and a learner.\n\nI am convinced that the four Ps is the best way for kids to learn. Desks in a row, followed by tests just doesn't do it for me anymore. I am so excited to learn more in LCL. Here are some links to a couple of blogs that I maintain: www.middleschoolminecraft.com and www.bwsmsrobotics.blogspot.com. Cheers. p.s. I am not a dog, but will figure out how to change my profile picture.\n\nHi everybody!\n\nMy name is Massimo and I have been doing so many jobs I get kind of embarassed when someone asks. Basically I started as a Digital PR & Social Media Manager then realized I was more keen on teaching about social media and digital cultures than writing marketing plans. After some quite good teaching experiences here and there I realized I had a special feeling with children and worked together with Fablab Torino to organize the firs Fablab 4 Kids workshops. At the moment I am working on a project to teach kids about the basic concept needed to browse the internet safely and smartly without the need of any digital device. That's why I particularly like the kindergarten approach! I live in Turin, Italy. You can read about myself on Facebook and on my blog.\n\nCiao ciao and enjoy life!\n\nMassimo\n\nHi all,\n\nI'm a digital media designer and interested in creative learning. Creating for me has always been a sort of a second nature. I'm good at creating idea's and opening solutions. What I never knew or was aware of though was \"how I did it\". So is there some sort of model behind my way of thinking?\n\nWhat made me more curious about this 'sort of model' behind my creativity and took me here was the moment that I applied for a job as teacher creative thinking. So I would like to embed my experience and creativity in more didactical skills in order to help others (children, students) to get back to the wonderful world of playful thinking.\n\nI'm a fairly new middle school teacher in southern Maine. By no means am I freshly out of school, it just took me a while to figure out what I would be happy doing. I received degrees in accounting and economics, sold panoramic sports pictures, became an insurance agent, and then eventually decided to make my way towards becoming a teacher. What I loved about all my jobs was explaining things to people and helping them understand how to help themselves, and I've always loved learning new things along the way. The process of learning has never stopped for me, and I sincerely hope it never does.\n\nSo now I find myself in the position of Media Specialist/Technology Integrator/Teacher. As of next year I'll be teaching 6th grade digital citizenship, 7th grade Intro to Coding (a brand new class in our middl school), and integrating technology, media skills, and literacy into other classrooms.\n\nI want to be a better teacher! I want to always be excited about what I'm teaching, how I'm teaching it, observe and learn from my mistakes, try and fail, try again and succeed, and have classrooms full of engaged students.\n\nHeya, I'm Justin! I'm based in Seattle, WA and see there are some people from UW in there =)\n\nI run a creative commons online wine education startup (Wine Folly). Our team creates educational art designed to help consumers. We serve over 12M educational assets to people from around the world every month and maintain viewership exceeding 1M/mo.\n\nWe are launching an intuitive learning platform in 2015 that attempts to turn the relatively dry science of wine into actionable information wine consumers can use within the context of their everyday lives. It's a work in progress; our current site functions as a blog where we are testing static mixed media.\n\nI believe many of the values of this class are inline with what we have been trying to do at our startup. We believe that adults can benefit from exercising this sort of creative feedback loop when enjoying wine and see immediate social/economic benefits.\n\nAt first Imagination Foundation brought me here. It seems as such a good idea, I wish, I had seen this the last time.\n\nFor some years now I've been fooling about trying to learn about creative processes through different sources, making my own tools for inspiring other people (games, workshops, exploration introductions, and so on).\n\nBeing at a public library I feel a strong need for supporting my community into using better methods and solutions in their daily life, study and work.\n\nIn our educational system there's a stronger and stronger focus on usability and PISA, leaving the creative kids with diagnoses or sheer boredom. It's like shooting all wildlife to save livestock, only to ruin the ecosystem of human progress, focusing on a purely short term, economical outcome. Time to change that!\n\nYes, I'm passionate about this, thank you. But passion is 1 of the 4 P's, right? c\",)\n\nHi! My name is Paul Carlsson, born -69 and I live in a small town in the south of Sweden named Karlshamn (Carls harbour). I work at Blekinge Institute of Technology where we have educations in media technology (audio, game, visual and web production). I´m also into research where my main interests lies in the possibilities of recreating education as we know it. How to design creative space/environment and how to organize our our education programmes and the content to promote creativity and new ideas. Happy that I found LCL and hope I have the time and space to take part of all your knowledge and ideas.\n\nMy sparetime is spent on being with my family (common-law wife and three kids, 8, 11 and 14) and to play music in some different bands. Started to play the upright bass a couple years ago in an americana band called PPM (Peter, Paul and Martin).\n\nSpotify http://open.spotify.com/album/4cg4ZzjOJ5jqW5Jm2ALdAo\n\niTunes https://itunes.apple.com/se/artist/ppm/id413084885\n\nHi new friends! My name is K-Fai and I work at the Free Library of Philadelphia. I run the Maker Jawn Initiative, a daily afterschool maker program in libraries across North Philadelphia. I help to herd and steer our amazing team of Maker Mentors, nearly a dozen people with backgrounds that include computer science, video production, and art, who guide youth as they identify and articulate their own creative, personal, and future-thinking goals, mostly through the creation of artifacts (videos, eTextile projects, etc) that serve as communal talking-points. Visited with a lot of folks from LLK at DML last month, and I'm really psyched because our entire Maker team is participating in the Learning Creative Learning MOOC and dedicating time during our weekly meetings to discuss the topics. Sometimes you get so entrenched in being a practicioner, that it's hard to step back and reflect, and that's what we hope to use LCL to do!\n\nHello!\n\nMy name is Eva Söderberg and I live in Sweden. I signed up for this MOOC with shaky fingers because I´m not quite certain that I belong. I´m fascinated by creativity and how we learn things, but my field of creativity is more in the line of handiwork and this seems to be a lot about technics. I have a textile background, constantly making something. Clothes, textile art, embroidery, but also ceramics and silversmithing. I need to be working on at least a couple of projects so I don´t get restless.\n\nI´ve been working as a teacher for almost 15 years now and I feel that I´ve found the job for me. I teach kids from the age of 12 to 15 and my subjects are Swedish and Slöjd. Perhaps you could translate \"slöjd\" with craft (textile, metal and woodwork), but I´m not sure it totally covers it. I teach the kids to use the tools and the materials that´s the most obvious, but more important is the skill to experiment and believe in your ability to make things. The process of what you are working with is in focus, preparedness is the word that appears when I try to translate the Swedish word.\n\nMy teaching involves using computers a lot, especially teaching Slöjd. Everything is to be found on youtube, and on the internet and I encourage the kids to think for them selves, try to find the tutorial for what they don´t know but also to make the tutorial when they found out how things work. I´ve come across the Maker Movement a lot lately and my personal challenge as a teacher now is to find a way to work with other materials in Slöjd. I can´t clearly express what I´m hoping to find but I know this was the reason for me to sign up for this MOOC.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI think I read almost all introductions, and it was quite fascinating, learning about such different backgrounds and organizations you are enrolled in !\n\nI'm Laura, I grew up in a french caribbean island, and I am thankful for this childhood in nature. I discovered education and technology back in 2009 when I joined the One Laptop Per Child community. I have worked with OLPC in Madagascar ( 3 summers), Haiti and Jamaica. It was a tremendous adventure.\n\nI graduated with a master of international business which I try not to regret since it taught me a lot, but thanks to OLPC I found my true love which is education/technology/learning/kids/creativity, and this why I am here\n\nI like music, painting, taking picture, singing really loud, kids, and one day I want to build my own sailboat with sails of different colors, solar energy, and I want to be able to grow flower fields on the deck, so we could exchange flowers for books while traveling around the world. I also have a thing for maps.\n\nI look forward to discovering through this course !\n\nCheers,\n\nLau\n\nMy name is Stella and I’m the Director of Educational Technology at an independent K-6 school in Southern California. I studied communication as an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California. I was especially interested in non-verbal communication and communication through advertising at that time. I also love to travel so when I finished my undergraduate degree I worked for American Airlines for a while.\n\nI entered into the teaching profession after I had my daughter, and through several different circumstances I took the computer teacher position at my current employer. The job started off with only 12 computers and 1 printer that were not networked. My job responsibilities were to teach K-5 students how to use the computers. I have been at the school now for 15 years and have seen many changes! My job has evolved with these changes. We now have over 120 computers, which include desktops and 2 laptop carts that are networked, projectors, printers, RedCat microphones and ELMO document cameras. Next year we will be getting an iPad cart. I have seen a great deal of change in a relatively short amount of time. I’ve also learned a lot about networking computers and teaching others… young and old.\n\nIn 2004 I received my Masters in Educational Technology from Pepperdine University. I am now the first point of contact if something goes down on the network (although we have a gentleman who is officially the network specialist but is offsite) and my position has changed to include Instructional Design. I enjoy “tinkering” with new technologies and am curious about how we all learn. I really look forward to the sharing of ideas in this class.\n\nOn a personal note I enjoy cooking, traveling, photography, and snow skiing. Although I was born in Los Angeles, California, my parents are from Kalamata, Greece and I would visit there almost every summer growing up. I speak Greek fluently.\n\nHello everyone!\n\nI am very happy happy to be here with you all!\n\nI am a french-italian tech entrepreneur currently living in Brazil (São Paulo/Rio).\n\nI co-founded two startups www.amuseworld.net and www.nanopop.com.br.\n\nThe first one, Amuseworld is a multimedia entertainment company for little girls (age 6-12). Our dreams is to open up the girls to different cultures to make them become real citizen of the world, sharing the same strong values such as respect, courage, solidarity using technology.\n\nI have been working on this project for the past 5 years and I am now at a turning point with some ideas for spin-off that I would love to discuss further more!\n\nI am really interested in all the ways we could bring girls to embrace more scientific and engineering careers, especially through play & toys.\n\nApart from that I graduated from Singularity University in 2012, which gave me an amazing opportunity to spend 10 weeks on the NASA campus and dive in all the new and exponential technologies.\n\nHope to get to know better some of you soon!\n\nHola, I'm Gerardo Sanchez from Merida, Venezuela. Engineer in electronic, worker of \"Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia\", the National Observatory and Astronomy Research Center in in Venezuela. My principal work is designing new astronomic instrumental, mostly in CCDs cameras and control. Freelance photographer I work mostly making panoramic photography and also 360° interactive views. I joined here one week latter, but I will try to follow you as much as my poor English let me. I'm father of a 13 years old boy who is desperately looking for new ways to learn science and technology. Here, where we live, all kind of resource in this way are limited, not to mention the big crisis we actually have as a country, so we will try to get as much information as we can from here.\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nWhat a lovely supportive community. I'll keep in brief as I know we have lots of reading to do.\n\nI'm an artist working mostly in installation and performance art. I am also an education consultant and visual facilitator when I'm not tinkering and working with thread to build large scale projects.\n\nI am nomadic. I've lived on 3 continents - with the last 5 years in Toronto. Recently, I moved to the shores of lake Erie to a tiny fishing village full of natural wonders. When the sky is just right I can see the dim glowing lights of Cleveland and Detroit across the lake. I look forward to working with you all.\n\nI've attached a photo of some of my work but you can see more at www.sandrapoczobut.com.\n\nIf you're on twitter I will be posting weekly visual facilitation from the course to help support my own and other's learning.\n\n@sansania\n\nHi I am Diane Darrow\n\nI am an artist, writer, educator, and dreamer. I grew up on a small farm in Connecticut, and spent many hours playing in the woods. As a high school student, I was happiest when painting alone in the art studio. When I went to college, I choose to earn a BFA in painting. A few years later, went on to receive an MFA and show my work in galleries and museums.\n\nWhen my son was born, I began to question why I was focusing my creative energies on object making for wealthy collectors. Deeply affected by Suzi Gablick's book \"The Reenchantment of Art\", I changed my vision of art making and directed my attention on building communities of learners and learning environments. I became a classroom teacher and children became my canvas.\n\nToday I work with teachers and technology. My desire to foster creativity remains my life purpose. The medium have used during my life is wide reaching. It began with a crayon and pencil, then I fell in love with oil paint and later on the eyes of a child. I am interested in creation.\n\nHello everyone. My name is Andrew. I took part in this class last year and absolutely loved it.\n\nCurrently I work in Marketing and Social Media for a leading lighting brand in the world of photography. Education has always been a huge part of my personal and professional career.\n\nAs a photographer, I pride myself in learning, and try to stay as current with the ever changing technology and as a trainer I believe learning and marketing go hand and hand.\n\nI hope that moving forward if anyone is looking to make a discussion group I would gladly join up, I think that also helps in the learning process.\n\nI wish you all the best during your time in this class and hope to learn not only from what's presented and the projects that are given but from the community that is connected to this group.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nI'm Amy Browne, a mompreneur from CA from a family full of teachers. I am very excited to hear all of the discussions related to creative learning. Graduate work in the MIT media lab would be a dream come true so I am super excited about the opportunity to be part of this MOOC. I consider myself a \"kindergarten for life\" sort of person so that already struck a cord for me. My background is transdisciplinary design, new media and now parenting so my passion projects have merged into a amalgam of how to best serve my kids future world with what I have to offer it.\n\nI'm quite sure growing up in the classrooms of my family made life long learning as natural as breathing. Environment greatly set my course so I think how to provide that for my kids. My attempt at revolt was to NOT be a teacher but an artist, however now as a Mom I explore the role of creative learning ad media in my children's learning everyday as well as collaborate with their teachers. I completely agree with peer to peer learning which is why my children are in schools not homeschool and why I put effort in helping their schools be updated.Both kids were in Montessori schools until they moved to charters that are whole child. I am a huge fan of Marie Montessori's philosophy and think she was way ahead of her time. I also believe strongly in collaboration as a future necessity for survival or success and open as a human responsibility. I am currently working on projects related with teams from the games industry we hope to be in the social emotional or whole child space upon launching. Would love to see talks about tolerance in collaboration, whole child learning, balancing digital with the natural world, what character means for the next generation.\n\nThanks again for opening this course.\n\n-Amy Browne\n\nHello Creative Learners,\n\nMy name is Juan, I was born and live in Santa Marta, Colombia, I am an new media artist , designer, hackeducator , maker and recently I co -founded a company that seeks to combine technological development , art and education, since I became a teacher I could not stop learning all the time, even though a year ago and left my teaching job , I am still interested to hack education for my two daughters and the people around me have better access to learning opportunities and knowledge.\n\nI have various interests such as datavisualisation, contemporary art, particle physics, 3d printing, creative learning, open source, neuroscience, creative commons, digital citizenship, visual arts, programming, robotics and many more.\n\nI found the LCL and I loved the proposal , and why I'm here , I want to share, learn and teach others, also want to hear and interact with different worldviews of people from diverse cultures and knowledge ..\n\nHi Melissa,\n\nfirst of all, thank you for your appreciation. My idea isa basically to use methods as old as time as theatre, storytelling, role-playing games, treasure hunts etcetera to spark thoughts about how the internet works. This way we can educate children about the internet and the consumption of digital contents even without access to computers, even to the internet too. It's more like a story told and played about the internet, it's more like creating fairytales about the internet. At the moment I'm trying to sell the project to Italian schools (which by the way are totally underfunded) and it's quite tought but the projecy has been shortlisted in an Italian contest looking for the best ideas about social innovation. It didn't make to the final stage but it was great to be selected. If you like the idea we could have a chat and see if our projects can work together or have something to share. What do you think about it?\n\nHi folks, good to meet you -- this is a really interesting group of people!\n\nI am product manager at Wikimedia Foundation, where I help build new tools to help users contribute productively on Wikipedia (1). On the weekends, I am an active member of a collaborative learning community called Pataphysical Studios, where we create art and teach ourselves electronics, woodworking and creative living. (2)\n\nMy previous ventures include: NewsTrust.net, a nonprofit social news network devoted to good journalism; Handtap, a wireless content service for mobile phones; shockwave.com, a web entertainment site at Macromedia; Apple Computer's Multimedia Lab, a new media R&D group; and Videowest, a producer of rock journalism for ABC, MTV and public TV.\n\nI am an Ashoka Fellow for my work as social entrepreneur -- and earned four patents for my interactive TV work at Apple. These days, I am particularly interested in collaborative learning networks.\n\n(1) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fabrice_Florin_(WMF)\n\n(2) http://pataphysics.us\n\nHello, my name is Andrew & I am from Toronto, Canada.\n\nI've joined LCL as I'm interested in this area of creative learning and how highly engaged community experiences can be further defined (e.g. interaction, applied behavioral economics in relation to emotional states) and applied across various sectors. I'm also applying to be a grad student with the Lifelong Kindergarten Research Group next year and hope to get accepted so I can pursue my research interests in this area academically.\n\nHow did this come about?\n\nI was a mentorship coordinator for international & exchange students at YorkU for 2 years and during that time, our team managed to increase enrollment by 400% and participation in monthly events were consistently well attended.\n\nFast forward to 2014, I signed up for the MIT15930x “Who is your customer?” MOOC. At the end of the course, staff sent out an invite for those interested to come to MIT for a bootcamp this summer. I applied and was accepted. The pre-bootcamp weeks that followed were a blur, we started self organizing, first on the edX platform and then subsequently on Facebook.\n\nIn less than a week (working globally around the clock & without having met), we managed to gather those who were selected to form a critical mass, divvying tasks up and assigning them to groups based on areas of expertise (brand creation/pr, video pitch, crowdfunding campaign, sponsorship letters, etc). Through this, I've realized how the pre-bootcamp prep was key to building a highly engaged and motivated community. When we finally met in person in Boston, it was like we already old friends and the in-person working experience at the week-long bootcamp was even more fulfilling.\n\nWhile still recovering from the bootcamp, I've learned that (it is more fun to be a pirate than to join the navy and) it is more about the journey rather than the destination and perhaps, the best way to do this well is to journey together as a community and creatively share what we've learned to others so as to better understand it ourselves.\n\nCan't wait to start off on this journey of learning creative learning with you!\n\nBest regards,\n\nAndrew\n\nURLs\n\nBootcamp Media Page\n\nMITx Bootcamp Facebook Community\n\nCrowdfunding the Next Big Idea & MITx\n\nMy profile on LinkedIn\n\nMerhaba, Hello,\n\nI am a career diplomat with working experience in a variety of challenging environments from the Balkans to Afghanistan. Currently I am heading the department for G20 Outreach and Engagement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ankara.\n\nHaving discovered \"coworking\" experiences of social entrepreneurs and change-makers and got fascinated by the idea of sharing an inspiring space for creative collaboration and innovation, I am connecting with people to explore these exciting concepts through Project InnoMate. InnoMate organizes three Meetup Groups in Brussels, in Luxembourg and in Istanbul.\n\nWith the team at InnoMate Istanbul, we have developed Project InnoCampus which will be a pop-up innovation platform travelling to universities: www.innocampus.org This is a non-profit social responsibility project.\n\nRecently, we have applied to Horizon 2020 research and innovation program of the European Union together with 12 partners from 7 different countries. The aim of our project proposal is to make science education more innovative through FabLabs. We took the responsibility of mobile FabLabs work package.\n\nOne of my passions is also creative education. The TED Talk of Sir Ken Robinson on \"How Schools Kill Creativity\" (2006), the movies \"The Wall\" and \"Dead Poets Society\" truly changed my perception about current education systems. We have to do something about it now! That's why I'm here.\n\nMustafa\n\nHey all,\n\nI'm Dan. I had the fortune to stumble across LCL last year and really enjoyed the community, the work, and the doors it opened for me. I jumped at the chance to be involved again, so I am back as a moderator this year. Hope I can be helpful.\n\nI currently work as the Technology Coordinator at a small, independent (private) school in Boston's Back Bay area. I get to work with students from K to 6th grade, to support the faculty and staff, and to manage tech projects like the school website. For the first 17 years of my teaching career, I was a classroom teacher mostly in grades 4-6. I have also worked as a computer consultant, as an apartment maintenance provider, and in a brewery. I have two children, 3 and 6, who fill my life with all the things kids fill one's life with. When not teaching or parenting or doing educational work like this, I find some creative outlet to delve into. Currently this is designing tabletop games. I recently ran a successful Kickstarter1 for my first game and am now working on getting it published. Other projects have included writing a children's novel and, separately, bookbinding.\n\nI am looking forward to giving back to the LCL after having really enjoyed it last year.\n\nOn twitter, I am @rilesdan though I don't inhabit that space on a regular basis.\n\nHello all! My name is Tracy, I run an Instructional Technology department at a University in Maryland. The timeliness of the email I received for he latest round of this learning community was amazing. I had just returned from the DevLearn conference in Vegas where two of the keynote speakers (Neil deGrasse Tyson and Beau Lotto) spoke about play in learning, creativity and critical thinking skills as keys for educating our current generation of children and young adults. I was inspired to step up my own learning and to expand my own learning community. I am looking for ways to make my office environment one of innovation for what we do, and I'm always looking for fun an exciting ways to help faculty expand their online learning environments so that they are more interactive and effective. As a parent, I'm also looking for ways to keep my 6 year old's passionate curiosity alive (and using it to inspire myself to do the same!)\n\nHi, my name is Mauro. I'm from Buenos Aires (Argentina) but I've also lived in Valencia (Spain) and The Hague (The Netherlands) and now I'm settled in Manchester (UK).\n\nI've studied Mechanical Engineering and have been working \"in the industry\" since, but I've grown tired of working for big projects and companies where I'm just one more cog in the machine. The last time I was happy with my job was when I was tutoring kids in Maths and Physics or when I volunteered for events that interested me (TEDx, music festivals). So now I'm dedicating all my free time to steering my career into something that I enjoy.\n\nI enjoy learning new things, talking to people with passion for their ideas (they don't have to be good ones), programming, DIY technology, music, science fiction, beer and street food. Seriously, I would kill for a burger and a pint right now.\n\nI look forward to meeting new cool people and learning to learn.\n\nHello everyone. I my name is Sandy and thrilled to be here as a moderator. I like to introduce myself by sharing my journey here to the LCL community.\n\nI came to LCL via the first MOOC I ever participated in (CCOW in the spring of 2013). CCOW was truly a life changing experience for me (cue the dramatic music here). It was there that I met, was inspired and learned from some amazing, talented and creative educators. As a result I made some dramatic changes in my teaching and personal learning. It was through CCOW that I came to learn of LCL, unfortunately I had missed the first round. Thanks to Youtube I was able to watch all the previous videos and I jumped right into LCL2 last spring. There I was able to reconnect and meet some new educators. LCL2 led me to Tinkering Emporium’s Coursera course this summer on the Fundamentals of Tinkering which in a word was awesome, and facilitated by fellow LCLers, Mike Petrich, Karen Wilkenson & Luigi Anzivino. All of this open up a world of knowledge and I am forever thankful. It has made me a better educator, and do a dare say a better person…I think so.\n\nOh and here is my standard intro with few more facts: I am K-5 technology teacher and love my job. This is a my 4th career, my career background is fairly eclectic (from a Casino Craps Dealer, Insurance adjuster, Restauranteur to finally my dream job as a teacher) I am passionate about creative computing and learning anything new! My mission is to infected my students with that same passion. New this school year, I am running an after school Tinkering/Hacker/Maker type club, I call it the Tinkering Dojo.\n\nSo with all that said, I am here again to continue to be amazed, inspired and to learn. I hope this time I can give back by perhaps inspiring a few of you to share fearlessly and freely. You'll never know where it may lead you!\n\nHi everybody!\n\nMy name is Andrea, I am from Argentina.\n\nI am a Translator and teacher and MOOCs are fascinating. They are helping me make my dreams come true. I have always wanted to study abroad, but life sometimes can be complicated.\n\nI am learning so much with this opportunity of interacting with people from all over the world. I am trying to persuade my students of doing MOOCs but I have come to realize that language is a problem. Some of the intermediate learners find it very difficult to follow the ideas or participate in the forums.\n\nProbably younger students will use English more naturally than my over 30 students.\n\nI look forward to continue learning and helping others to learn.\n\nIt s an honor to share this space with you!\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nMy name is Drew and I am currently an assistant head of a lower school in metro Detroit. I have not been a world traveler like many of you, but my adventures in life have given me fulfillment so far and a chance to meet many people on this great earth.\n\nI am fidgety and constantly needing to move my fingers or I'll go crazy. My mother would always get mad at me because I often picked at the candles on her beautiful dinner table during mealtime, or she would find my napkin torn to shreds. In school, the floor under my desk would be layered with paper crumbles or pieces of my eraser because I couldn't leave anything alone. I am also the one that tears the labels off of bottles and rolls the playbill into a periscope at every performance. It's not because I'm repressed in any way... I just can't help it! That's why today I have multiple fidget toys on my desk at work and have to carry around silly putty so that I don't destroy a piece of property. Not really, but having something to constantly fidget with could be a good thing for me.\n\nThis truth about me is probably why I love creative learning. I love tinkering with just about anything and coming up with new ideas. I am hopeful this group will be a great resource for me and I can't wait to hear about the many ideas out there! Such a great idea to do this!\n\nI hope this post finds everyone doing well!\n\nSincerely,\n\nDrew Mackay\n\nDear friends,\n\nI'm Ephraim, a young optimistic and eager to learn french student @HEC Paris. Studying business administration, I'd rather get involved in education more than in big companies or banks\n\nI am currently looking for an internship in the education field - in a democratic or alternative school, or in a startup working hard on getting children learn about life with enjoyment and curiosity.\n\nI believe the educational system is no longer adapted to our society and, worse, it's destroying the potential and creativity of our children, and would love to share knowledge and discuss it with you.\n\nI'm looking for intelligent questions, not ready-made answers and like meeting smart and enthusiast people and learn from them. What about you?\n\n\"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.\"\n\nHello world,\n\nI'm Giacomo (eineki if you want to find me online) an italian developer used to live here on earth since the last part of the previous century.\n\nI stumbled on a sort of creative learning almost two years ago and got charmed. Since them I've been a proud member of the Bologna incarnation of Coderdojo Movement.\n\nFor me this is a chance to have a broader view of the principles that lie behind the learning and to have a firsthand experiment of the creative learning practices as an attendee.\n\nI hope this will be also fun\n\nHi - My name is Rik Eberhardt. I work at the MIT Game Lab where I make games and teach undergrads at MIT how to make games. I'm currently working on games about humanatarian relief and games to teach world history, ecology, and earth science. The kinds of games I work on run the gamut from tabletop board/card games to digital video games to alternate reality games and role-play experiences.\n\nI'm currently enrolled in the EdTechX series on the EdX platform that my co-workers are running and I'm finishing up an online Serious Games certificate at MSU. I'm very interested in adult learning - particularly the different methods that are being developed for online learning (my MSU courses have about 10-15 students per cohort, by EdX classes have over 10,000). I'm looking forward to seeing how LCL compares to the others, along with the learning that will happen here!\n\nHi everybody! My name is Elinis, I am from Brazil, but I have been out of my country since 2010.\n\nI am on my beginning my journey as a teacher and looking for what can help me to be good on it. To learn news things is fascinating. I love to help others to believe in themselves and encourage them to make their dreams come true. I am learning more when I can interact myself with people and observing what they have done around the world. I realized through my journey that language is a problem, but not a stopping point. So, I'm look forward to see what I can learn here in this community, hoping I can be able to share in the same proportion.\n\nHi,\n\nMy name is Anders Berggren, Smedjebacken Sweden. This is my third LCL, so I was a little bit confused about the new LCL. Has it really started? Ah, yeah... I get it. The first message is the oldest. Is there a way to sort to newest first?\n\nOk. I live in a small place in Sweden, working with ICT-education and advising. And I love to meet the kids(7-16 yrs) in techprojects, like building \"the future of electrical cars\" with re:cycled stuff.\n\nand Arduino, Scratch, Raspberry Pi.\n\nAh, and I must say; I love the creative, international touch of the LCL. And the Unhangouts. I hope to catch up with you...\n\nBest regards from Smedjebacken, Sweden (Nope, no snow yet... only the evil darkness of november).\n\n/Anders\n\nHi\n\nAs a teacher, my main problem is keeping up the good work (based on my own standards). Not so much keeping up with the administration and doing what I should do, but keep going on the projects I love and that inspire the students in the same way.\n\nI teach computer science in a secondary school in Vilvoorde, Belgium. I have no collegues in this course. That means I'm all by myself. Nobody to converse about ideas or problems.\n\nI come here to meet inspiring people and to work on new content, together, to learn, together, to discuss, together.\n\nThat is my hope\n\nJohan\n\nHello comrades!\n\nI am Jacson - surname used as a name: Brazilian things - a history teacher on the public education system. Living and working in the city of Novo Hamburgo, on the fluvial-lacustrine and industrialized region of southern Brazil.\n\nI live busy days, with the end of the school year here, and the start of summer vacation just ahead in time and in mind visions. Bureaucratic and evaluation procedures coming at its final deadlines, in an inherited rigidity of the only one State Government supported in the Comte's Positivism confession at the political history. In addition, all the Brazilian educational system are in upgrade, incrementing and/or redesign process.\n\nI went back to relax and meditate as in youth, now to enjoy the diffuse thinking in learning and creativity... or simply to enjoy being one. I like to sing and play musical instruments. I was a professional draftsman but currently little practice. I like long walks, riverside and singing birds. I like spontaneous kindness and genuine friendship.\n\nAlso, I headed the organization of the annual edition undergraduate research fair of Polytechnic High School, here where I work this year. Moreover, we have a working group in our school being so awarded in international school science fairs for developing shingles recycling PET bottles.\n\nI never before had assumed such responsibility as a teacher, but someone had to do it; after all my colleague, with whom I planned the fair, was receiving awards in Peru, with their workgroup, in the only date that the school administration has given us to do so... Still, our internal school fair was very cool!\n\nLike I said, I've been busy. But now I get to share here in the community more often. See you, peers!\n\nI liked what I saw from the pictures of your space. I would love to communicate with you about your experience in running your space. I run a similar thing but not from a school but from a science center which is affiliated to the organization I work for. We have students and adults come to our open to the public events. Most ofthe programs we have had using tinkering ideas to make participation a different learning experience. We are planning on bringing these programs to schools to get students to realize that knowledge can assimilated in ways other than the standarded classrooms. With what they have already they can be creative and it is important that they can still think independently. http://www.meetup.com/AST_Spaces/\n\nHi, my name is Leandro Boeira and I´m Master of Engineering, Production Engineering in Modeling and Simulation of Systems and Bachelor of Mathematics in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. I´m leaving in Bento Gonçalves, a city in southern Brazil.\n\nI teach afterschool classes for children and youth (7 to 15 years old) using educational Lego robotics kits, trainning teachers to apply the methodological concepts used in robotic classes collaborating and giving lectures in interdisciplinary approaches for STEM teachers.\n\nAlso undergraduate professor, Technologist in System Analysis and Development, taught fundamentals of computing subjects like algorithms and programming, computational logic and data structures applying tools as kinect for Windows, Lego Mindstorms, Scratch and Alice programming languages. Developed a virtual abacus with students. Testing and ratifying the software kinect2scratch with Kinect for Windows to Stephen R. Howell (Institute of Technology Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland).\n\nI´m very proud to participe this group, and contribute to learning and sharing knowledgement with everybody.\n\nRegards\n\nLeandro\n\nHi everyone,\n\nMy name is Erum , I am from Pakistan, I have two lovely sons who teach me everyday about the world we all live in. I love to learn in a crazy manner, that's what landed me here. I started my learning as a group facilitator for teachers and moms of small children some 12 years ago. I got my Montessori training and played with many 3-6 years old mixed age group classrooms for many years...as I start learning more, i realize that learning is highly individualized and experiential. I have seen kids learning in traditional desk style classrooms and have seen extremely creative learning in my Montessori classrooms and then amazingly natural learning in Nature /outdoor classrooms. As i train teachers of early childhood and others, i invite them to keep Observing kids Scientifically just as a scientist Observe and they will get the hidden formula of learning....that's highly individual experience.\n\nI am excited to be here to learn and unlearn...\n\nHi, everyone. I'm Ula from Taiwan. I'm not really sure if I can join this program, and kind of confused about it. I'm a high school student now and yeah, with poor English. I hope I can join the discussion here and learn more stuffs. I'm interested in everything, especially chemistry and neurology. I'll try hard to improve my English this summer and also learn more about the subjects I like.\n\nNow I'm interest in green products and trying to find more possible way to help our earth.\n\nI'll do more research on neurology in the future and try to find the ways to copy memories from our brain. I know human cloning betrays our morality, but I really hope we can make one, for nothing but for science. It might helps if we use it in the right way, and I know we can do this.\n\nWell, it's a hard issue, but that's my opinion about it.\n\nI'm really looking forward to this!"
