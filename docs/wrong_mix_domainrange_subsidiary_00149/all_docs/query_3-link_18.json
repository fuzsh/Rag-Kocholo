        "text": "LITIGATION\n\nPartner\n\nGlaser Weil\n\nAs a law student, Baum never thought about becoming an entertainment attorney. Today he’s in arbitration with several cases — contract disputes, accounting and profit participation issues, defamation, misconduct accusations, and more — involving celebrity clients and entertainment companies. His work requires discretion, especially during arbitration. Baum enjoys a challenge. Having represented clients on both sides of the #MeToo movement, he’s glad to see that those cases are beginning to change the industry for the better.\n\nWhere’s the truth? “People live in the land of their perceptions,” Baum says. “What people perceive and what they believe is 10 times more important to them than what the actual truth is. They’re just stuck on their perception.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartner\n\nKasowitz Benson Torres\n\nBerlinski, a talent-disputes expert, found himself in a swirl of publicity recently via his representation of Scarlett Johansson in her fight with Disney. The actor complained that Disney forced its subsidiary Marvel to release “Black Widow,” in which she starred, on its Disney Plus streaming service simultaneously with the film’s release in theaters, violating a commitment to an exclusive theatrical release and resulting in devaluation of Johansson’s compensation, which was to be largely based on the film’s total box office. Significantly, despite Johansson having signed an agreement with Disney to arbitrate her dispute with the Mouse House in a confidential hearing, Berlinski managed to inflict widely publicized public embarrassment upon the studio, leading to a significant payout for the actor.\n\nSign of the times: “What a lot of folks are dealing with now is how to compensate talent for the value that they’re bringing to a project when the metrics we’ve used historically to value that talent’s work are changing so dramatically,” Berlinski says.\n\nLITIGATION\n\nGeneral Counsel, Exec VP, Business & Legal Affairs\n\nPartners Entertainment and Media Litigation Group\n\nPartners Entertainment and Media Litigation Group\n\nPartner, Commercial Litigation\n\nVenable\n\nVenable’s Entertainment & Media Litigation Group has taken on cases for clients such as ViacomCBS, Showtime, Fox Digital Entertainment and several A-list celebrities. Much of Brenner’s work includes anti-SLAPP cases and idea submission claims; in recent months he’s handled confidential matters for Hydra, ViacomCBS and Showtime. Briggs — who also serves as president of Los Angeles’ Board of Police Commissioners —obtained $15 million in damages in singer Kristina Buch’s case against producer Noel “Detail” Fisher, and reps numerous high-profile performers in cases spanning copyright and contractual issues, endorsement deals, and other litigation. Fink spends a considerable amount of time on confidential, alternative dispute resolutions for celebrity clients, and represented DMG in its dispute with its former GM, Chris Fen- ton. Well-versed in copyright, trademark, and general business matters, Rosenberg also provides threat-management services to high-profile individuals dealing with stalking and harassment.\n\nFight for Rights: Anti-SLAPP matters are important to Brenner, who fights for First Amendment rights. “When litigating idea submission claims, it is never lost on me that I’m fighting for someone’s reputation. It’s much more than a matter of money when someone accuses my client of dishonesty or idea theft. You’d better be able to back it up if you are going to make such a serious claim.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartners\n\nLavely & Singer\n\nBrettler defended Britain’s Prince An- drew in a now-resolved misconduct claim; and got fraud charges tossed for Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank.” Brettler also reps Armie Hammer and Chris Noth facing allegations. He filed a defamation lawsuit for client David Portnoy of Barstool Sports. Weinsten won and defended an injunction for client studio executives asserting extortion by Charlotte Kirk, the actor whose name was associated in multiple Hollywood sex scandals; and defends using the Coachella name for a client of a California native tribe. Weinsten’s other clients include Digital Domain, Gucci, TV executives Deirdre and Scott Gurney, Paris Hilton, TV reporter Maria Menounos, Ben Silverman’s Propagate Content, and commercials house Tool of North America.\n\nCopyright complexities: Weinsten sees an epidemic of copyright claims made by photographers against celebrities for merely posting photos of themselves on social media. Among possible responses, Weinstein says, “if the celebrities contributed artistically to the final image [having initially collaborated with the photographer], they can claim co-ownership of the copyright.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Communications & Media Industry Group; Co-Chair, Diversity & Inclusion Initiative\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Communications & Media Industry Group; Co-Chair, Commercial Litigation Practice Group\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Music Industry Group; Vice Chair, Sports Industry Group\n\nPartner; Chair, Music Industry Group\n\nCovington & Burling\n\nDelNero advised Univision in its $4.8 billion, Spanish-language TV mega merger creating TelevisaUnivision. For this, the Washington D.C.-based attorney worked a myriad of regulatory approvals. Kamin repped China-based ByteDance prevailing in court rulings versus a federal executive order banning its TikTok in the U.S. Kamin further defended the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee by getting abuse claims dismissed for actions by non-USOPC people; and also repped Nexstar pursuing two cable TV operators for breach of carriage contract. Kamin, Sahni and Sperling repped re- cord labels and publishers pursuing music piracy claims against two inter- net services providers. Kamin and Sahni defended CBS Interactive in an Illinois class-action case seeking cable franchise fees from streaming services. Sperling reps Sony Music Enter- tainment in music royalties disputes. Kamin and Sahni are based in Century City; Sperling in New York.\n\nTime to update: Sahni says conflicts periodically erupt from contracts created before the streaming age, including municipalities seeking local cable TV franchise fees from out-of-town streamers. Collecting local taxes “doesn’t match the economics or reality of streaming,” says Sperling. Sahni adds that applying dated contracts can be “trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartner and Co-Chair, Media, Entertainment and Technology Practice Group, Century City\n\nPartner and Co-Chair, Global Trial Practice Group, New York\n\nPartner and Co-Chair, Trade Secrets Practice Group, Los Angeles\n\nPartner, New York\n\nGibson, Dunn & Crutcher\n\nEdelman, Snyder, Samplin and Ascher defended AMC Network in “The Walking Dead” profit participation dispute, winning a ruling three weeks ago, shrinking one plaintiff’s case. Edelman and Samplin repped Verizon Media, Yahoo and Oath prevailed over image-use claims. Repped by Snyder and Ascher, Bob Dylan and Universal Music defeated a financial claim by a Dylan song collaborator.\n\nEdelman defends Sony Music Entertainment from musicians seeking to reclaim music rights; and TV host Rachel Maddow, MSNBC, and corporate siblings in an anti-SLAPP dismissal over defamation. Snyder got Tinder founders and early employees a $441 million settlement; other clients include Facebook, Lady Gaga, Madison Square Garden and Bruce Springsteen. Samplin won a dismissal for Verizon’s Oath over trade-secret misappropriation claims; and defended cosmetics brand Huda Beauty in an infringement claim.\n\nAscher says talent sometimes claims additional compensation from usage by in-house streaming platforms, if not contemplated in the talent’s original employment contracts. “We expect more disputes around that,” he says. Edelman and Samplin are in Los Angeles; while Snyder and Ascher are in New York.\n\nStreaming model risks: Samplin wonders if big streamers doing talent buyouts of backends assuming a prospective show will be a hit “is a sustainable model as their content proliferates.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartners\n\nFreedman + Taitelman\n\nHardy repped “21 Jump Street” screenwriter Michael Bacall recouping professional fees from an unlicensed attorney, talent agent Richard Lawrence defeating a $22 million lawsuit and musical artist FKA Twigs pressing a boyfriend abuse matter. Kaplan de- fended Quentin Tarantino selling NFTs based on “Pulp Fiction” and advises sports agent Ben Dogra over his CAA separation. Marsh repped Nicole Young in her civil action against her ex-husband, Dr. Dre, reportedly receiving a $100 million settlement, and also talent manager Eric Podwall seeking unpaid commissions from Smokey Robinson. Troupson advised Chris Harrison in settlement for departing as host of ABC Television’s “The Bachelor” and various Hollywood executives for financial settlements from job exits. The litigation foursome are in Los Angeles. While “industry consolidation” is often cited for job cuts, Marsh says that justification doesn’t always hold up under scrutiny. “The universe of jobs may be shrinking, but that doesn’t excuse employers from complying with labor and employment laws,” he says.\n\nExposing abuses: Hardy adds that job- protection laws and regulations are being strengthened in part because Hollywood’s #MeToo movement ex- posed abuses. “[Events in] the entertainment and media industry actually resulted in a change of public policy,” he says.\n\nLITIGATION\n\nChair, Entertainment Labor Group\n\nLoeb & Loeb\n\nBierman is among the few labor experts who represent film, television, digital companies, broadcasting and cable networks, distribution companies, brands, and advertising agencies in guild, union, and other labor matters. She worked closely with Black Label Media and Bunim-Murray Productions, along with the various guilds, to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, while working on agreements in con- nection to shutting down and then re-opening productions, as well as working with Time’s Up on various safety guidelines.\n\nPandemic impact: “COVID-19 contin- ued to be very challenging for produc- tions, not just from a physical safety perspective, but also from a psycho- logical and political perspective,” she says. “The industry’s ability to cope with COVID-19 protocols on produc- tions has evolved substantially.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nManaging Partner\n\nPartner\n\nKendall Brill & Kelly\n\nDuring the pandemic, Kendall and Kelly found themselves settling more cases through arbitration and fewer through trial. The veteran litigators (along with partner Nary Kim) began 2022 by scoring an arbitration win for CAA in a $55 million suit brought by film financier Worldview Entertainment, securing a dismissal of all claims, and their current caseload includes defending Paws Incorporated (owner of the Garfield character) in a pending arbitration with Alcon Media Group. Kelly, along with partner Nary Kim, also worked on a deal for Paramount Pictures subsidiary Paramount Licensing Inc. in a $20 million-plus breach of contract case against a former licensing partner in connection with the development of Paramount hotels and a theme park outside London.\n\nTrial by Zoom: “I think the judges preferred to see attorneys’ faces without having the mask in the way, rather than having people live in the courtroom covered with a mask,” Kendall says.\n\nLITIGATION\n\nFounding Partner\n\nPartners\n\nKinsella Weitzman Iser Kump Holley\n\nDecades of collaboration have forged strong bonds between Kinsella and Kump, who have worked together for more than 30 years. Such teamwork is behind much of the firm’s success. Kinsella paired with Fitzgerald to negotiate a landmark $200 million settlement — one of Hollywood’s largest — in Frank Daranbont and CAA’s long-running “The Walking Dead” profit participation case against AMC. Kinsella and Fitzgerald collaborated on several profit participation, vertical integration and licensing deals. Kump, who has long represented the Kardashian and Jenner families, oversaw a large number of confidential cases in the past year, and teamed with Fitzgerald on entertainment litigation for HBO Latin America. Kump also played a key role in securing client MRC a nearly $31 million award in its arbitration case against Kevin Spacey for damages caused by the actor’s conduct when working on “House of Cards.”\n\nDivide and conquer: Each attorney possesses skills that complement his counterpart’s. Says Kump: “Dale is able to navigate the audit process in order to litigate claims for numerous long-running shows. He stands up to the studios on behalf of creators. [I’m] a staunch advocate for clients … and fight tooth and nail to protect IP. Chad has done a great job of handling confidential mat- ters for talent in arbitration and helping talent lawyers understand the arbitration process.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nChair, Entertainment & Media Litigation Group\n\nPartners, Entertainment and Media Litigation Group\n\nPaul Hastings\n\nThis trio of attorneys reps major studios and clients in some of the most notable negotiations throughout the industry. Godley represented Warner- Media in the second phase investigation of the alleged misconduct on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” and provided next steps guidance (winter and spring 2021). Godley also reps social-media client Sidetalk, an Instagram show with more than 5 million followers and more than 500 million unique views across platforms, in ongoing copyright and trademark disputes. Pearl, a go-to First Amendment attorney, led a team that advised Activision in defamation-related lawsuits and managed a team that gained a full dis- missal of antitrust claims relating to the Steam videogame platform. Marenberg is repping ABC Television and Disney over challenges to their COVID-19 vaccine mandate in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. He’s also repping Pixar over defense of fraud and breach of contract claims regarding “Onward,” and has already gained a dismissal of a separate lawsuit that alleged copyright claims relating to the film.\n\nApplying expertise: “Our practices overlap and then we all have areas of emphasis,” Marenberg says. “The three of us have a lot of knowledge together and when cases come in we think about how to handle them and collaborate.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartners\n\nDavis Wright Tremaine\n\nNew York-based McNamara and Strom are preeminent defenders of the First Amendment. In recent months they beat a $95 million defamation suit brought against Sacha Baron Cohen and Showtime for their series “Who Is America?” by former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Ray Moore, and won the affirmation of a dismissal of a copyright infringement and libel-in- fiction lawsuit by Wall Street performance court Denise Shull over Show- time’s “Billions.” More recently, they successfully defended Netflix and the producers of the docuseries “Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich” in an $80 million defamation and breach of contract suit brought by attorney Alan Dershowitz that was dropped in March.\n\nChilling effect: “There aren’t many successful defamation cases, but we’re seeing more and more of them brought by Russian oligarchs and the whole Trump administration, and they have the top lawyers in the world that make you spend years and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars defending your work,” says Strom.\n\nLITIGATION\n\nL.A. Managing Partner; Chair, Entertainment & Media Litigation\n\nPartner, Entertainment & Media Litigation; Deputy General Counsel\n\nPartner, Entertainment & Media Litigation\n\nKatten Muchin Rosenman\n\nModabber is a trusted adviser to some of the world’s most recognized musicians, including Trent Reznor, Stevie Wonder, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Min Jin Lee, Lil Nas X and Celine Dion and places a big emphasis on helping to control the rights to his clients’ output. Halberstadter is a go-to-lawyer for intellectual property disputes involving major movie and TV studios, production companies, and streaming services, working with heavy-hitter clients including ViacomCBS, Showtime, Starz and Lionsgate. And Weiner handles cases involving copyright, contract, ac- counting, and business tort claims, as well as personal claims against entertainers, directors and professional athletes, working with clients including NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Endemol Shine Group.\n\nMusic isn’t free: “There’s been a massive increase in the amount of unlicensed music being used on social media platforms that needs to be addressed and stabilized,” Modabber says. “People still aren’t clear that music isn’t free, particularly when songs are incorporated into social-media marketing campaigns.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartner; Chair, Litigation Dept\n\nGreenberg Glusker\n\nThis year, Moss represented director Rian Johnson in a dispute with his former agent and got a copyright infringement suit dismissed against NBCUniversal Media, Jerry Seinfeld, and Stacey Snider over “Bee Movie.” But the case he found most interesting was a wiretapping accusation against a Barstool Sports reporter that he argued before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\n\nAdjusting with the times: About NFT and copyright issues, Moss says: “As technology changes and people find ways to monetize intellectual property, lawyers like me need to make sense of how it fits into a set of laws that obviously were not written with any of this in mind. To be on the forefront of evolving modes of entertainment and communication is a pretty exciting thing.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartner; Trial Practice Chair; Firm Vice Chair\n\nPartner; Co-Head, Entertainment, Sports & Media Group\n\nPartners\n\nO’Melveny & Myers\n\nO’Melveny’s team of entertainment litigators is led by Petrocelli, who has been in the news for repping CNN in its dismissal of anchor Chris Cuomo and for repping NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt in a $2.85 billion lawsuit filed by SmileDirectClub for alleged defamation. Lens worked with Petrocelli to successfully squelch a copyright termination effort that threatened to derail a reboot of Fox’s “Predator” franchise, then filed a series of suits on behalf of Marvel and Disney to combat recent moves by the estates or relatives of Marvel writers and artists seeking copyright termination rights on characters including Spider-Man, Iron Man and Thor. Working with Petrocelli and Lens, Godesky helped Marvel and Disney in the resolution of Scarlett Johansson’s lawsuit regarding the distribution of “Black Widow.” She also serves as co-lead counsel defending singer-songwriter Kesha in a lawsuit brought by her former producer Dr. Luke, while Marroso is the co-lead counsel repping Global Rights Music, a startup advocating for composers including Bruno Mars and Smokey Robinson, in an ongoing antitrust suit against a coalition of 10,000 radio stations.\n\nTrending litigation: “Copyright termination and issues around the streaming of content on affiliated platforms will continue to dominate the negotiations and disputes in the industry for the foreseeable future,” Petrocelli says.\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Entertainment, Sports & Media Industry Group\n\nPartners\n\nLatham & Watkins\n\nPutnam repped the Assn. of Talent Agents and separately Intl.

Ellison advises the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. defending against claims and as- sisting its restructuring amid industry pressure; Madison Square Garden Co. in a dispute over the Los Angeles Forum sale; MGM and Mark Burnett Productions on various matters; and Johnny Mathis defending against liability claims involving employment law. Washington represents Beyoncé, her BGK Trademark Holdings and Parkwood Entertainment in a variety of matters. Washington also defends Miramax and former the Weinstein Co. board members in defeating Harvey Weinstein-related claims.\n\nDay of reckoning: Putnam expects the U.S. Supreme Court to soon revisit free speech protections. “A day of reckoning is coming as a result of our societal movement from real news to clickbait,” Putnam says. “It’s something everyone should be watching closely.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nCo-Leader, Global Commercial Litigation & Disputes practice; Managing Partner, L.A. office\n\nPartners\n\nSenior Managing Associate\n\nSidley Austin\n\nAs co-leader of Sidley’s global commercial litigation and disputes practice, managing partner of its Los Angeles office, and head of the Greater Los Angeles Litigation group, Ransom is the connective tissue of this powerful team. Clients include UMG, Capitol Records, Rhino Entertainment and Warner Records. Many of their cases could impact the music industry for decades to come. Highlights: Ransom, Commons and De Lilly represented UMG and Capitol in a putative class action brought by original Beach Boys member David Marks, claiming an underpayment of royalties associated with streaming of recordings in other countries; the court granted Sidley’s motion to dismiss Marks’ First Amended complaint. Gilford, De Lilly and Ransom are currently representing UMG Recordings and Capitol Records in a putative class action regarding a provision of the Copyright Act that allows authors to terminate a grant under certain circumstances after 35 years. Ransom obtained an order narrowing the case, which is now in the discovery phase.\n\nFinding compensation: “It took the music industry a little while to figure out how to successfully monetize digital exploitation of music,” Ransom says. “The Napster days and the challenges of file sharing haven’t entirely gone away. Nonetheless, I think the music industry has been particularly successful in finding a way to distribute its music but to get compensated for it through streaming.”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPrincipal Shareholder\n\nGreenberg Traurig\n\nThe former federal prosecutor and prominent showbiz litigator entered national headlines recently through his representation of Britney Spears in her conservatorship dispute.

In the philanthropic arena, Rosengart serves as General Counsel for the non-profit Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE), handling it on a pro bono basis. CORE was founded by Penn in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. It now works globally and its most recent efforts have focused on combatting COVID-19 worldwide and establishing a presence in Poland in connection with the Ukrainian refugee crisis.\n\nFighting injustice: Rosengart, who is Variety’s 2022 Power of Law honoree, says he repped Spears because “I was concerned that she had been deprived of certain civil or fundamental liberties, even as she was earning hundreds of millions of dollars as a performer, from which others were benefitting,”\n\nLITIGATION\n\nPartner; Co-Chair of Matrimonial & Family Law Practice Group\n\nBlank Rome\n\nThe daughter of a successful trial lawyer, Royce abandoned corporate law early in her career to enter one of the most highly personal areas of the legal profession: matrimonial law.

Other key clients: Sony Music Publishing, ABKCO, peermusic and trade groups RIAA and Merlin.\n\nSharing the wealth: “In a marketplace increasingly dominated by companies where music distribution is just one of their business models, ensuring creator control and fair and transparent compensation requires not just unrelenting focus, but also a deep knowledge of all of the relevant industries,” Scibilia says.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nFounding Partner\n\nPartner\n\nAlter Kendrick & Baron\n\nAlter’s New York-based, female-centric firm stands at the forefront of working with major and independent music publishers as well as private equity, repping Primary Wave in its acquisition of the estate of James Brown, Reservoir Media Management’s purchase of Tommy Boy Records and South Korean giant HYBE in its $1 billion merger with Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings. Alter and partner Baron are also known for their work in helping artists regain publishing and master recording rights under the U.S. Copyright Act.\n\nContent consolidation: Alter anticipates an increasing consolidation of content ownership in the music space “as more of the short-term investment vehicles driving the current boom reach the end of their life cycles and complete exits.” Adds Baron, “It is an honor to be entrusted by our clients to ensure that any risks are identified and mitigated, and that all parties to the transaction are happy at the conclusion of the deal.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Entertainment Transactions Practice; Co-Chair, Entertainment Finance Practice\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Entertainment Transactions Practice\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Entertainment Finance Practice\n\nAssociate, Media & Entertainment Group\n\nDLA Piper\n\nAra and Sherman advised ZASH Global Media & Entertainment acquiring video platform Lomotif.

Johnson and Offsay repped Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in its $8.45 billion sale. Johnson and West handled Spotify for podcast/live audio content. Bruington advised eOne, Moonbug Entertainment and distributor A24 for credit facilities; and Media Res Studio on financing Apple TV Plus productions.

His clients are generating more than 800 hours of television per year, and are operating a number of digital platforms with tens of millions of users per month.\n\nRise of social: “Creators of content have more influence and direct access to audiences now than ever before.

Cooper insists his proudest moment was his participation in, forming and representing the Recording Artist Coalition with Irving Azoff, Don Henley and Crow in repealing the RIAA’s legislative attempt to add “recordings” as a work for hire in the Copyright Act. “The development of accessible new technology will facilitate direct licensing, allowing artists to exploit their original creations to the public in ways we’ve never seen before.” Rosen adds: “Power is more in the hands of the creators than ever before but navigating all the possibilities is going to take long-term vision.”\n\nPeering into the future: Rosenbloum, with his own tech-heavy client roster, says he see “the advent of the metaverse and NFTs, which are going to present numerous legal challenges for the music and entertainment industries over the next several years, in particular the licensing of rights.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nFounder & Principal\n\nThe Davis Firm\n\nThe man who negotiated the sale of Barry Manilow’s song catalog to Hipgnosis in 2020 remained active in that arena last year, creating deals for catalog deals worth hundreds of millions for songwriters, artists and producers throughout 2021. His firm also crossed the t’s and dotted the i’s for chairs and presidents at music companies, including Jeannette Perez’s promotion to COO of Kobalt Music in October and Ryan Press’ rise to president of Warner Chappell Music in November. A true labor of love last year was the superstar-filled We Love NYC Homecoming Concert in Central Park on Aug. 21. Davis and his father, industry legend Clive, were enlisted by then Mayor Bill de Blasio to assemble the event that drew 60,000 attendees and millions of viewers worldwide.\n\nCatalog good and bad: “I have a love-hate relationship with catalog deals,” says Davis. “I appreciate that we are able to transfer tremendous wealth to creators, and have been able to deliver life-changing equity events for them. The value of their life’s work is finally being realized within creators’ lifetimes for so many. I am wary, however, about further consolidation of value and power with a few large corporations. We are not fully considering what removing approvals and long-term appreciation from the creators means and there will be ramifications down the line.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartners\n\nGreenberg Glusker\n\nThe L.A.-based quartet handles a mix of talent deals, financing and M&A.

Their stable of clients also includes numerous other writers, directors and producers (David Chase, Rob Marshall, Ed Solomon, Shawn Ryan, Kurt Sutter, Brad Falchuk, and Lindsey, Bonnie & Terry Turner), top-of-line actors (Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, Chris Pine, John C. Reilly) and authors (Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, Jenny Han, Daniel Silva).\n\nBackend compensation’s future: “Maybe there’ll be deals where you don’t get paid anything more than guild scale up front, but you get a tremendous amount of money if based on results, whether it’s the number of subscribers they’re able to add or the stock performance,” Kelly says.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nSenior Partners\n\nZiffren Brittenham\n\nFischer repped Chernin Entertainment’s extension of its Netflix deal to series commitments; Greg Daniels’ Bandera animation joint venture; and Darren Star for Netflix shows.

Gilbert-Lurie worked a film deal for Imagine Entertainment\n\nat Apple Studios, Sandra Bullock starring in “The Lost City” and Claire Danes for an Apple TV Plus series. Wolf handled Skydance supplying live-action features to Apple; and Judd Apatow for his first-look pact with NBCUniversal. Other Wolf clients include Scholastic (“Clifford the Big Red Dog”); writer-producer Scott Silver (“Joker 2”); and production company Media Res. The four are L.A.-based.\n\nBetter deals? Expecting just a handful of vid-streamers to eventually dominate, Gilbert-Lurie says Hollywood awaits “whether that consolidation leads to better deals for talent because they’ll be deep-pocket companies or whether it will go in another direction.” A key issue is performance-based contingent compensation.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartners\n\nGinsburg Daniels Kallis\n\nGinsburg has been cutting a succession of high-profiles deals for client Timothée Chalamet, including pacts for starring roles in “Don’t Look Up,” director Luca Guadagnino’s “Bones and All,” and Warner Bros.’ “Dune 2” and its “Wonka” franchise.

Levin has a long-time working relationship with Dwayne Johnson and leads the negotiations for “Red One,” which is now set at Amazon. She also repped him on the deal to appear in a Fortnite videogame. Levin negotiated Regina King’s deals to write and act in a Shirley Chisholm biopic and repped her in a Wells Fargo endorsement deal.\n\nCollaboration is key: “This is a supportive environment,” says Levin. “We work together to bring about the best outcomes for our clients in the negotiations that they trust us to do for them.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartner\n\nAssociate\n\nDel Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein Lezcano Bobb & Dang\n\nBilingual in English and Spanish, Lezcano and Ramirez have developed an expertise in repping non-U.S. Latin talent in local content deals with major streamers, negotiating Wise Entertainment’s first-look deal with Amazon to develop Latin-themed programming for the English, Spanish and Portuguese language markets, multiple deals for writer-producer Daniel Krauze for English- and Spanish-language programming (Amazon, Legendary/HBO Max, Apple TV Plus, Sony, MGM/Netflix), and an agreement between the rightsholders, executive producers, Secouya Studios and Amazon for a reboot of “Zorro.” They’ve also cut deals for a wealth of English-language, Latin-themed content, including Nadine Velazquez’s “La’tina” (Showtime) and Miguel Nolla’s “Trap Queen” (Onyx Collective) and negotiated Davy Perez’s writer-producer pact for Paramount Plus’ “Star Trek” franchise.\n\nUniversality in diversity: “My grandmother and my aunt’s favorite movie of all time was ‘My Big Fat Greek Wedding,’ because you could just replace all the Greek characters with Latino characters, and it’s the same movie,” says Lezcano.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nFounding Partner\n\nManaging Partner\n\nLichter Grossman Nichols Adler Feldman & Clark\n\nLichter reps rarified talent on their biggest deals, including Oscar-winning helmer Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland,” “Eternals”), helmer Marc Forster, who recently completed “White Bird: A Wonder Story” for Lionsgate, and documentary filmmaker Irene Taylor, who is helming and producing a doc about the Boy Scouts sexual-harassment controversy for ABC. She also reps MacArthur Genius Grant recipient Jacqueline Woodson, who is now writing “Behind You,” a series for Netflix and Shondaland. Feldman reps helmer Steven Soderbergh, who recently completed “No Sudden Move” and “Kimi.” He also reps helmer Barry Jenkins, who just finished “Underground Railroad” and is now at work on the prequel for “The Lion King.” Other Feldman clients include Viola Davis and Lily-Rose Depp.\n\nStreaming all the way: “The streaming issue was just nascent when the pandemic started, but now it has been pushed to the forefront in every deal whether it’s a traditional feature or ends up streaming,” says Lichter. “We’re dealing with streamers in a much more concentrated way than ever before.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartners; Co-Chairs, Media, Entertainment & Technology Practice\n\nPartners\n\nGibson, Dunn & Crutcher\n\nMasuda and Gourley jointly represented LeBron James’ Spring Hill Entertainment selling a minority stake at a $725 million valuation; James and Arnold Schwarzenegger selling the Ladder nutrition company; and Paul Wachter’s Main Street Advisors in raising funds and various investments. Ross and Gourley advised the Kevin Mayer- and Tom Staggs-led Candle Media in M&A for talent-owned Hello Sunshine and Westbrook Global. Masuda advised Square buying a majority stake in Jay-Z’s Tidal music streamer for $297 million; and Tom Werner, James and Maverick Carter in restructuring and capital raising for their Fenway Sports Group. Masuda repped esports talent manager Loaded Management in raising capital and restructuring; and Michael Eisner’s Tornante Co. selling Topps trading cards. Ross handles Universal Pictures, celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin selling her Ouai hair-care company and app Screenshop in its sale. Tsoneff returned to the firm in January after working legal at a production company. Masuda feels that content creators are in the driver’s seat because technology creates new pathways to consumers such as web outfits licensing very short pieces of music and the re-sale of NFTs automatically generating additional talent payments.\n\nLong live the king: “Content is still king,” Masuda says. “It’s just the distribution methods continue to evolve.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartner\n\nFox Rothschild\n\nMiller’s client list reads like a who’s who across film, television, music and more. His clients include Angela Bassett, Courtney B. Vance and Chris “Ludacris” Bridges and the NAACP, which forged a content development partnership with CBS Studios with Miller’s help. The deal will place projects at Paramount Plus and Apple TV Plus and feature major talents such as Whoopi Goldberg.\n\nA fresh look at IP: The deals for the NAACP “really came out of conversations I had to renegotiate a distribution agreement, and in the process we talked about the potential of the brand and having them think of ways to reach people, celebrate images and look at their IP,” says Miller.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartner, Corporate & Entertainment Transactions; Co-Founder & Co-Chair, Blockchain & Digital Currencies\n\nVenable\n\nO’Brien has made it his mission to be at the forefront of tomorrow’s technologies, specializing in matters at the intersection of entertainment and crypto, closing NFT deals for talent and crypto platforms alike. For example, he repped a major music artist in the development of artwork for sale through an NFT platform; a marquee actor in a promotional agreement with Crypto.com; and a top sports star in the licensing of his name and likeness with the NBA Top Shot NFT program. The lawyer also repped Paradigm Talent Agency in the sale of its North American music booking agency to an affiliate of Wasserman Media Group.\n\nBlazing a trail: “The digital age has been a mixed bag for Hollywood,” says O’Brien. “NFTs and the blockchain are ushering in a great opportunity — digital scarcity — for creators and rights owners. But it takes lawyers with a clear understanding of evolving laws and principles to help clients blaze their trail through this Wild West crypto landscape.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Communications & Media Industry Group\n\nPartner; Co-Chair, Music Industry Group\n\nOf Counsel; Founder, Video Games & E-Sports Practice\n\nSpecial Counsel\n\nCovington & Burling\n\nCentury City-based Polashuk advised PBS for carriage of member TV stations and PBS Kids TV channel on DirecTV. Polashuk’s other clients include Walt Disney Co., Paramount Global, Fox Corp., NFL Network, Ovation TV Pac-12 Networks, TV One, and Univision Communications. Perry repped Fox Entertainment on various NFT initiatives, including a $100 million creator fund; and also brewer AB InBev for collectible Key to the Budverse NFTs, which sold out quickly. Perry and Hill are based in New York. Washington, D.C.-based Irvin advised Chinese gaming giant Tencent on a multiplayer videogame. Irvin’s extensive videogame practice includes Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Psyonix Studios, PUBG Mobile, Riot Games and streamer Trovo. Hill advised the NFL on football rights for Amazon, CBS, ESPN/ABC, Fox and NBC, reportedly for more than $100 billion. Other Hill clients include MLB, NBA, NHL, PGA of America, Portland Trail Blazers, EPIX, MSG Networks, TV One and Weigel Broadcasting.\n\nTech keeps them busy: Polashuk expects content bundling to get more expansive with “so much more customization because of the advancements in ad tech.” Perry anticipates real-world products will be offered in digital in the metaverse as a “tokenized version. That type of activity is on the horizon” and will require extensive legal work.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nFounder, Managing Partner\n\nManaging Partner\n\nPartner\n\nOf Counsel\n\nRamo Law\n\nRamo handles business affairs for content-creating powerhouses such as Imagine Entertainment, Hello Sunshine and Kevin Hart’s Laugh Out Loud and HartBeat Prods., in addition to working with prolific producers such as Yale Entertainment. Chang oversees unscripted matters, handling clients including Boardwalk Pictures (“Chef’s Table”) and Scout Prods. (“Queer Eye”). Canchola specializes in TV, serving as outside production counsel for Skydance Television (“Reacher”) and 20th Television. She also advises clients on all aspects of development, financing and production for both film and television. She reps clients such as Aggregate Films, with Compas leading the firm’s New York office, advising clients on all aspects of scripted and unscripted television, motion picture and new-media development, including Push It Prods. (“The Upshaws”), Imagine Documentaries (“Lucy and Desi”) and the Jim Henson Co. The shifting landscape that’s occupied by the various digital outlets has created dynamic new business models. “The talent content valuation model is the new industry gold rush. The valuations and sales of companies, which were founded by high-profile talents, are where everyone’s chief focus is currently on,” Ramo says.\n\nPodcast nation: Ramo notes that “everyone must be listening to podcasts nonstop because that business is evolving into a distinctive audio ecosystem.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartner\n\nAssociate\n\nFox Rothschild\n\nYou might know Rogers’ name from his work in high-profile cases for Rick Ross and French Montana. Among recent feats, the chairman of the Black Entertainment and Sports Lawyers Assn. renegotiated Kanye West’s Def Jam contract, fetching millions of dollars in advance of the release of the album “Donda.” He also worked a label deal with Columbia for West’s manager, Abou “Bu” Thiam and led a stock restructuring and sale agreement for Ross’ ownership share of Sovereign Brands. Rose assisted Rogers in some of those transactions and also represented such producers as Ronny J, TooDope! and lil88, such artists as YBN Nahmir, Bluebucks Clan and Kali, along with several deals on behalf of others with a variety of major labels not yet disclosed.\n\nHigh tide: “I get excited helping artists leverage their personal brand to create generational wealth,” says Rogers. “For those artists with savvy teams, it is a great time to be in this business.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartner\n\nMyman Greenspan Fineman Fox\n\nRosenberg & Light\n\nYes, he did the paperwork for Justin Beiber ’s chart-topping “Justice” album and the singer’s same-named tour, as well as a starring role for Ariana Grande in the film adaptation of “Wicked” and the launch of her r.e.m. cosmetics line. But Rosenberg is particularly proud of Bieber’s recently announced partnership with Betterhelp, which will provide a month of free therapy to his fans and his road crew, and Grande’s $1.5 million match pledge to advocacy groups fighting anti-trans legislation in Texas and Florida. Client John Legend kept him busy, too; he negotiated the artist’s exit from Columbia, a new label pact with Republic and the sale of his song catalog to BMG and KKR. Rosenberg continues to rep the LVRN label (Summer Walker, 6lack) and Justin Tranter, who wrote Imagine Dragons’ hit “Enemy” and penned the musical “The Circle of Becoming” with Idina Menzel and V (formerly Eve Ensler).\n\nHigher ground: “Important to me is helping to promote underrepresented people — women, people of color and the LGBTQ community — into positions of leadership,” says Rosenberg. “My clients Michelle Jubelirer and Tunji Balogun were appointed chairwoman and chairman of, respectively, Capitol Records and Def Jam. I was very proud to be part of that.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nCo-Founders\n\nAttorneys & Partners\n\nRothenberg, Mohr & Binder\n\nJust one of Binder’s clients, Marshmello, kept him busy with deals to create a “Melloverse” with game Fortnite, play a Wynn Nightlife residency in Vegas and appear in the opening ceremony of the UEFA Champions League Final in Portugal. Binder also landed an MGM Grand stint for Alesso and an Interscope deal for Morray while also repping Gunna, SZA, Jake Wesley Rogers and Flo Milli. Rothenberg inked an administration deal with Sony Music Publishing for artist, songwriter and producer Jon Bellion and a joint venture with Universal Music Publishing for writers Bellion develops. He also reached a distribution agreement for Logic with BMG; deals for Charlie Puth (LG, TikTok, Grub Hub); publishing pacts for Skylar Grey and producers-writers Rice N Peas; and renegotiated label deals for Trevor Daniel, Bankrol Hayden, Jazmine Sullivan and A$AP Ferg. Mohr reached branding and acting deals for duo Chloe X Halle and label deals for Kendra Jae and AG Club, while Almy continues to rep composer-producer Dan Romer (“Luca,” “Dear Evan Hanson”) and songwriter-producer Teddy Geiger.\n\nUnder new management: With new chairs at Capitol (Michelle Jubelirer), Def Jam (Tunji Balogun) and Island (Imran Majid, Justin Eshak), “the decision of where to sign a record deal is more challenging than ever,” says Binder. “The landscape is wildly competitive, leading to more opportunities for strategic dealmaking. After much consideration, Top Dawg Entertainment [TDE] landed a massive partnership with Michelle and Capitol for its newest signee Doechii. Michelle deeply connected with Doechii and understood TDE’s vision from the moment they first met.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nManaging Partner\n\nPartners\n\nGang, Tyre, Ramer, Brown & Passman\n\nThese three top music barristers represent some of the biggest musical acts, including Taylor Swift and Adele, as well as icons Elton John, Paul Simon, Randy Newman and Quincy Jones. Perhaps the firm’s biggest deal last year was negotiating Green Day’s Hella Mega Tour, with a $65 million gross. The firm also negotiated deals for composer Ludwig Goransson, negotiated Pink’s “All I Know So Far” doc for Amazon and Camila Cabello for Disney’s “Cinderella” and her L’Oreal cosmetic line. Says Salomon, who helped negotiate the sale of Neil Diamond’s catalog and his Broadway musical: “What’s really satisfying is helping artists navigate a complicated world to achieve their goals.” Schiffres wonders about maintaining the music business’ double-digit growth over the past five years prompted by streaming. “I’m concerned with both growing the pie and making sure our clients are getting as big a slice as possible.\n\nCatalog sales warning: Passman says artists should think hard before selling their catalogs. “With big dollars being dangled, it’s important to analyze whether a sale is right for your particular situation.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartner, Global Head, M&A Group\n\nPartner\n\nPartner; Co-Head, Tax Group\n\nSullivan & Cromwell\n\nIn 2021, L.A.-based Krautheimer collaborated with Sawyer and Wheeler — both at the firm’s New York headquarters — to combine their expertise in M&A, tax structure, and capital markets to shape their client AT&T’s landmark $106.5 billion deal spinning off Warner Media business into a combination with Discovery. Krautheimer and Sawyer focused on transactional aspects of the deal via nightly Zoom meetings. Wheeler and the tax team created a tax-free transaction by negotiating and constructing the largest-to-date Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Even more impressive: the teams completed negotiations on the 300-plus page deal in just two weeks — during a pandemic. The tight turnaround was necessary to maintain secrecy given the massive scope of the deal and the number of parties involved. Krautheimer, Sawyer and Wheeler participated in AT&T’s sale of Vrio as well as its $16.25 billion deal with TPG Capital to separate DirecTV from AT&T and establish a new DirecTV entity.\n\nRace against time: “Trying to do a deal of this scale in this time period really does require a group of people that work quite well together. It was a challenge. It was two exhausting weeks,” Krautheimer says. “It was a very quick timeline for a challenging transaction, and it’s gone quite smoothly since.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartners, Entertainment & Media Group\n\nReed Smith\n\nCentury City-based Sessa and his New York counterpart Shapiro head up the music, entertainment and media business practice for the 145-year-old Pittsburgh-headquartered firm, which includes more than 1,500 lawyers in 30 cities around the world. Sessa’s roster includes Bon Jovi, Billy Corgan, Meek Mill, Kesha, Irving Azoff ’s Artists Group and Derek Hough, while Shapiro has repped Rihanna in deals for her beauty lines and Anitta for her Netflix special. Shapiro’s proudest recent moment was winning a successful $8 million suit in federal court for EDM star Kaskade, against the Las Vegas Palms Casino and Resort, which allegedly tried to use the pandemic as an excuse for nonpayment. Shapiro pointed out that Kaskade first filed the suit for the breach in late 2019, four months before COVID was even identified.\n\nSupporting the creatives: “It’s simply great to see the result of great work for a great client,” Shapiro says. Sessa adds, “To be able to assist creative geniuses who shape culture is an honor.”\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nCo-Chair, Entertainment, Sports & Media Group\n\nPartners, Entertainment, Sports & Media Practice\n\nO’Melveny & Myers\n\nThe quartet is part of O’Melveny’s team of nearly 100 attorneys in its Entertainment, Sports & Media Group, co-chaired by Siegel, who served as co-lead counsel for Korean entertainment conglomerate CJ ENM in its acquisition of an 80% stake of the scripted business of Endeavor Content, and FuboTV in its $190 million acquisition of French streamer Molotov SAS. Her client roster also includes Warner Bros., Paramount, Bron Studios and Genius Sports. Joining O’Melveny from Manatt, Phelps & Phillips in October, Conner repped the estate of Tom Clancy in negotiations of multiple rights agreements with Paramount for the late author’s novels, and Red Arrow Studios in the $73 million sale of its majority stake in Gravitas Ventures to Anthem Sports & Entertainment. Tobey and Vannini served as lead counsel on several big M&A transactions, with Tobey handling WarnerMedia’s sale of TMZ to Fox Entertainment and Vannini repping ViacomCBS Networks Intl. in its acquisition of a majority stake in Fox TeleColombia & Estudios TeleMexico, and a shareholder in the $900 million sale of media company Hello Sunshine.\n\nNo more one-size-fits-all: “The content providers want a menu of options for distribution and pricing models and innovative ways that a consumer can interact with the product,” says Siegel.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nIndustry Co-Lead, Digital Media & Entertainment; Industry Lead, Games; Chair, Copyright; Co-Chair & Partner, Technology Transactions\n\nIndustry Co-Lead, Digital Media and Entertainment; Partner, Technology Transactions\n\nIndustry Co-Lead, Digital Media & Entertainment; Partner, Blockchain & Technology Transactions\n\nChair, Private Investment Funds; Partner, Corporate\n\nFenwick & West\n\nThis quartet from Fenwick & West provides tech-native legal expertise for its clients from four different offices. Seattle-based Dailey leads the firm’s private investment funds practice, working with clients including Russell Westbrook Enterprises and Kygo’s Palm Tree Crew. Los Angeles-based Klungness has helped bring blockchain and Web3 to the mainstream, repping NBA star Spencer Dinwiddie’s social token company Calaxy, cryptocurrency exchange FTX in its deal with the Coachella fest to launch an NFT collection and major NFT marketplaces including OpenSea, MagicEden and SuperFarm. Over the last year, New York-based Lalla has advised on transactions with an aggregate value of more than $2.6 billion, including the launch of $50 million Gen Z-focused VC fund Animal Capital (with Dailey), the $300 million acquisition of youth entertainment company Complex Networks and $75 million in financing for fitness tech platform Future. San Francisco-based Stanley handles commercial contracts for Epic Games and Riot Games, strategy and operations for Gamestop’s NFT marketplace and matters for Netflix’s new games division.\n\nBleeding-edge challenge: “It’s important to balance the decentralized nature of the blockchain or NFT project and the artist’s interest in retaining its rights and its name and image, because those two things are not always 100% aligned,” says Lalla.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nPartners\n\nSidley Austin\n\nMembers of Sidley Austin’s transaction teamwork well independently and together. Each member of the team has his own accomplishments —Thompson handled the $8.45 billion sale of MGM to Amazon; Fronk represented Amazon in lengthy negotiations with Disney for the new custom voice assistant, Hey, Disney!, which will debuts this year; Petretti handled financing on over $1 billion worth of music-related acquisitions for top global music groups; and Weiss represented the Spring League in selling the U.S. Football League assets to Fox Sports. Together they provide legal expertise and firepower to tackle complex transactions. Thompson is working on a deal — potentially in the hundreds of millions of dollars — to sell a well-known podcast business to a major podcast aggregator; Weiss is providing support with IP- and copyright-related issues, and Petretti is assisting with the financing piece of the puzzle.\n\nFuture forward: There’s a reason Thompson constantly asks clients about long-range plans. “Someone told me a long time ago, ‘Any lawyer should be able to tell you what the law was and is. A good lawyer thinks about where the law is going and what you need to be planning.’ It’s sort of like getting that crystal ball out,” he says.\n\nTRANSACTIONAL\n\nChair, Entertainment Litigation; Managing Partner, L.A.

Weingarten, the office’s managing partner, is a veteran entertainment litigator who was in the media spotlight repping Jamie Spears in the legal battle over the conservatorship of his daughter, pop star Britney. A specialist in corporate and tax law, Epstein closed a variety of deals, repping Spyglass Media Group in a multi-pronged pact that dealt 200 features to Lionsgate, and Ryan Reynolds’ creative marketing agency Maximum Effort Marketing in its sale to Mountain Digital. Mulrooney focuses on estate planning for high-net-worth individuals, including actors, directors, writers, producers and artists. Fohrman works the intersection of media and tech, including blockchain and NFTs, handling novel-use cases involving the integration of music and the metaverse for some of the biggest social media companies, and overseeing hundreds of millions of dollars in music rights transactions.\n\nSky not falling: “Over and over again, they say this technology is going to be the death of this or that, and every single occasion that this comes up, it’s really been an opportunity for the business to not only overcome that adversity, but to use the technology to thrive,” says Weingarten.\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nGlobal Head of Legal Affairs, Spotify Studios\n\nGlobal Head of Business Affairs, Studio Content\n\nSpotify\n\nAn experienced music executive, Bauman has lent his talent to media titans including HBO and Machinima, and jumped to several key roles during his five-year stint at Spotify, where he now heads legal for original content and serves as associate general counsel. During the pandemic, he helped foster an “explosion” of podcast growth on Spotify, in addition to founding his own content discovery app, ZinBin. Chi, meanwhile, secured a first-of-its-kind deal with J.J.Abrams’ production company Bad Robot to produce podcasts exclusive to Spotify; solidified a partnership with Ava DuVernay’s Array, also for exclusive podcasts; and nabbed an exclusive rights deal to popular Alex Cooper podcast “Call Her Daddy.” Furthermore, Chi manages the Chernin Entertainment partnership, and in the same vein, spearheads the TV/film adaptation vertical under\n\nSpotify Pictures.\n\nPodcast future: “There is a continued surge of excellent new music and podcast content being created every day,” Bauman says. “I believe we’ll see continued innovation and new tools evolve across the whole industry.”\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nExec VP, General Counsel\n\nAllen Media Group/Entertainment Studios\n\nDeVitre handles more than affiliate and retransmission agreements for the rapidly expanding Byron Allen’s Allen Media Group. He completed acquisitions of the Weather Channel, HBCUGO.TV, and MGM’s over-the-air diginets ThisTV and Light TV. He also helped integrate several local TV stations and made a multi-year, multi-platform deal with Google/YouTube.\n\nDeVitre’s responsibilities evolve along with the company, which currently boasts more than 20 television stations, eight cable networks, and several digital offerings like the GrioTV, LocalNow and Sports.TV.\n\nLearning curve: “The joy of the job is something I’ve grown with,” DeVitre says. “I’ve learned more in the past 10 years than at any other point in my career, which is amazing, because 10 years ago I was already a really senior lawyer.”\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nChief Legal Officer; Exec VP\n\nLegendary Entertainment\n\nErramouspe’s first full year at Legend­­ary included massive and industry-shifting deals. He oversaw negotiations for a $760 million deal to sell a minority stake to Apollo. But it’s his challenging negotiations with Warner Bros. concerning the day-and-date releases of “Dune” and “Godzilla vs. King Kong” that stand out because the negotiations identified, addressed, and resolved unprecedented pandemic-related movie release issues the film industry had never faced before, resulting in a blueprint for the future.\n\nThe edge of dealmaking: About the Warner Bros. negotiations, Erremouspe says: “The challenge was that we didn’t have a real framework to look to for guidance. We were out on the edge of dealmaking. Which is fun, but does have its challenges.”\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nGeneral Counsel, Exec VP, Business & Legal Affairs\n\nChief Counsel + Business Affairs, UMPG; Digital Rights Management, UMG\n\nExec VP, Business & Legal Affairs, Head of Litigation\n\nExec VP, Business & Legal Affairs Latin America & Iberian Peninsula; Head, Universal Music Latin Entertainment\n\nUniversal Music Group\n\nFrom the first 10% stake that Tencent partners took in 2019 through September’s $53 billion launch on the Euronext Amsterdam in September, the largest initial public offering in the history of the music business, Universal Music’s legal team guided the process that not only lifted the company’s value, but also that of every large player in the business. UMG’s worth is more than six times greater than where investors pinned it just eight years ago, while the steps it took to peel away from parent Vivendi encouraged competitor Warner Music Group to launch its own IPO, one of the biggest of 2020.\n\nAside from the demanding tasks that took UMG public, McMullan kept a watchful eye on internet providers who allow repeated copyright infringements, including Charter, Brighthouse, Grande and RCN, including a $1 billion verdict against Cox that was upheld March 29 by the federal district court in Alexandria, Va. Kokakis orchestrated the February acquisition of Sting’s song catalog, key digital licenses with TikTok and Triller, and publishing deals with Lionel Richie and Ariana Grande collaborator Tommy Brown, among others. Vives struck deals with significant estates, including that of the influential Juan Gabriel, plus streaming royalty terms for global artists while handling complex litigation throughout North America. She and Harleston are founding members of UMG’s diversity-focused Task Force for Meaningful Change.\n\nTaking care of business: “The run-up to UMG’s public listing at the end of September was a transformational period for the company and I couldn’t be prouder of the key role my team played or the end result: the most successful public listing in the history of the music industry,” says Harlston. “Even with the demands of the public listing, my team also continued to sign exciting new artists, acquire the iconic catalogs of some of the world’s most celebrated artists and develop innovative licenses with partners in new areas of our business spanning fitness and health, short-form video and live-streaming. It’s been thrilling — and more than a little exhausting — but none of this success would be possible without the UMG lawyers named on this list and the contributions of so many others on my team.”\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nVP, Business & Legal Affairs\n\nSB Projects & Ithaca Holdings\n\nDuring her first year of law school, Strauss attended a Steve Aoki concert and wrote him a note on the back of a ticket asking for an internship. To her surprise, the DJ responded and connected Strauss with his label, Dim Mak. Soon, she became the company’s legal intern and never looked back. Years later, while working at WME, Strauss helped negotiate Aoki’s performance deals and Vegas residency. Now, she serves as vice president of business and legal affairs at Scooter Braun’s groundbreaking SB Projects and Ithaca Holdings.\n\nAt ease in the biz: “Getting to spend my days supporting an industry that I love makes it easy to go to work each day,” says Strauss.\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nGeneral Counsel\n\nSkydance Media\n\nA Canadian native who previously worked for Vice Media, McKinnon played a key role in the Skydance New Media’s partnership with Marvel Entertainment to develop an original action-adventure game and the formation of Skydance Sports and its subsequent partnership with Meadowlark Media to produce a pair of documentaries. Her day-to-day responsibilities include overseeing the company’s consumer products division, helping manage IP registration and compliance, and developing and advising on its COVID-19 protocols.\n\nPandemic workaround challenges: “It’s kind of gone in waves with the various variants and with the guilds,” she says. “And then you’ve got people traveling, so governments will impose restrictions on what you have to have in order to enter a country.”\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nGeneral Counsel\n\nVP, Legal Affairs & Business Development\n\nPrimary Wave Music\n\nOrtner and Rhulen, Primary Wave Music’s legal team, closed key acquisitions worth more than $500 million in 2021.

Among assets recently landed: estates of James Brown and Toto’s Jeff Porcaro, works from Def Leppard, Paul Rodgers, Alice in Chains’ Layne Staley and Mike Starr, Survivor’s Jim Peterik, and the Regent Music and Jewel Music catalogs. Beyond that, the pair oversees all legal and business affairs with regard to asset management and exploitation, content development and branding initiatives. Projects they’ve facilitated: an immersive Las Vegas show built around the music of Bob Marley, Sun Records-centered podcast “Midnight at the Sun Diner,” a Whitney Houston cosmetics line from MAC, Styx-themed “Oh Mama” beer, and Air Supply’s Valentine’s Day promotion with Edible Arrangements, along with biopics and docs in development, including “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,” the film about Houston that premieres in December.\n\nBe nimble: “We manage our daily juggle,” says Ortner. “On any given day we might be considering a complex chain of title issue in acquisitions, licensing interpolations of a gem in our catalog, negotiating a consumer-products deal for an estate, sorting terms to produce a podcast or planning an NFT drop. We have to be ready for anything the creative team throws our way.”\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nExec VP & General Counsel\n\nSenior VP, Head of Litigation\n\nSenior VP, Head of Digital Legal Affairs\n\nSenior VP, Deputy General Counsel\n\nSenior VP, Deputy General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer\n\nWarner Music Group\n\nIf you only looked at the deals Warner Music completed in the second half of 2021, Robinson’s legal eagles more than earned their keep. In July, the major closed on the assets of Doug Morris’ indie label 12Tone Music, (Anderson .Paak, Dolly Parton, Joji, and ILLENIUM). August sealed a partnership agreement with Madonna for the artists’ career-long catalog. September saw WMG land another career-spanning catalog with the estate of David Bowie, and in December it acquired 300 Entertainment (Megan Thee Stallion, Gunna, Mary J. Blige and Young Thug). In addition to acquisitions, Warner Music eyed emerging technology, including a metaverse deal with The Sandbox to create The Sandbox’s first music-themed gaming world. The company also unlocked NFT opportunities in a partnership with Blockparty, launched artist channels and programming through an alliance with Twitch, and expanded virtual entertainment opportunities with Wave, Genies and Kuaishou.\n\nBrave New World: “As we look to the future, we’re focused on strengthening our internal capabilities—like transacting in crypto or populating virtual environments at scale with our music and other intellectual property — to make sure we’re able to make the most of these partnerships,” says Robinson.\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nGeneral Counsel, Head of Business Affairs\n\nScopely\n\nRosenthal has closed deals for Scopely, a large privately held mobile game company, with many of the biggest names in entertainment — Marvel, ViacomCBS, Sony and WWE. He played a major role in Scopely’s $50 million investment in three European gaming companies in 2021. The attorney also led Scopely’s expansion across Asia and assisted in creating legal entities in Singapore, South Korea and Japan. Rosenthal advises Scopely on ventures into the blockchain space as well.\n\nAdapting old laws to new realities: “There are very few laws that are on point to blockchain,” says Rosenthal. “But we’re using pre-existing laws and regulations that date back to the 1930s in some cases to try to enforce what’s happening in 2022, and that’s complicated.”\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nExec VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary\n\nCity National Bank\n\nBig challenges arose when the pandemic hit in March 2020, and Speaker and his colleagues worked around the clock to secure more than 25,000 PPP loans worth almost $6.2 billion for their clients when many were at risk of shuttering forever. In addition to navigating these programs, Speaker also oversees the bank’s outreach to underserved areas through the Community Reinvestment Act, in which funds are used to build affordable housing and create small businesses, among other initiatives.\n\nOn-call banking: “Find a banker you can have a relationship with,” Speaker says. “From my experience the real problems in life don’t happen between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. You need someone you can call on at 3 a.m. if your business is about to go out of business.”\n\nIN-HOUSE\n\nExec VP Business Affairs and General Counsel\n\nExec VP, Business and Legal Affairs, International\n\nExec VP, Deputy General Counsel, Chief Compliance, Ethics & Privacy Officer\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Deputy General Counsel\n\nExec VP, Head of Business and Legal Affairs, Global Digital Business\n\nSony Music Entertainment\n\nImplementing the 2021 launches of the music major’s Artist Forward and Songwriters Forward programs was not only a priority for Swidler’s team, but also a manifestation of a creative-friendly philosophy advanced by Sony Music Entertainment CEO Rob Stringer and Sony Music Publishing chairman Jon Platt.
