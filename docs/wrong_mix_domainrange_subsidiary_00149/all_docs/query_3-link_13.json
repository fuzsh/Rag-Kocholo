The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:36 p.m. in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA The Chairman. This hearing will come to order. And I should warn our participants here that we have, I believe, a vote at 3 o'clock; originally, it was at 2:45, so we have 15 minutes of grace, some of which will be taken up by my opening statement, for which I apologize, but which I am going to enormously enjoy giving. So, thank you very much for being here. And others are trying to juggle stuff, but they will all be here. Today, our committee is going to examine the issue of consumer privacy in an online world. Mark Pryor had a subcommittee hearing on this subject, with respect to children. But, this is actually the first time, I think, in committee's history, that we have had precisely this kind of, writ large, online privacy hearing. So, it's very important to me. It's an issue I am deeply interested in, and I know my colleagues, especially Senators Kerry and Pryor, who chair the Subcommittees on Communications Consumer Protection, are, also. I thank them for their work on this issue. Imagine this scenario: You're in a shopping mall. And while you're there, there's a machine recording every store you enter and every product that you look at and every product that you buy. You go into a bookstore, the machine records every book you purchase and every book you peruse. Then you go to a drugstore. The machine is watching you there, meticulously recording every product you pick up, from the shampoo and the allergy medicine to your personal prescription, if you are searching for one. The machine records your every move that day--every single move. Then, based on what you look at, where you shop, what you buy, it builds a personality profile on you. It predicts what you may want in the future and starts sending you coupons. Further, it tells businesses what a good potential client you may be and shares your personality profile with them. Do they have your permission for doing that? Of course not. Is it possible that they give you some alternatives, in fine print, which nobody has the time or the interest or the eyesight to read? They might, but that doesn't count, if we're doing this straight up. So, this sounds fantastic, something like out of a science fiction. But, this fantastic scenario is essentially what happens every second of every day to anyone who uses the Internet. Every time you go online, a computer server tracks the websites that you visit. When you send or receive an e- mail, a computer may scan the contents of that e-mail. And when you use a mobile device, a computer often tracks your location--very interesting--your location, where you are. Moreover, these computers--computer servers, these machines, as I call them, are storing all of this information about you and using it to build your personality profile, which, as it happens, they share with others. And thus, we enter the briar patch. From this profile, they determine your personal tastes and private characteristics. They inundate you with advertisements based on this information. They can spam and potentially scam you. So, the questions we ask today are: Do consumers know what these online practices do? Are they--do they have a sense of awareness about this? Do consumers realize that computers are tracking what streets they walk on and what websites they visit? If they're not, is that important? Do they realize that the information they put on their personal websites is being shared with third parties? That wouldn't occur to a lot of teenagers. And what are consumers getting in exchange for this information-sharing, to which they have not given consent? Some can argue, ``Well, the fine print is there, and it's not our fault that you didn't read it.'' I say that's a 19th-century argument, not one suitable for the 21st century or for honest relations with customers. We must also ask: If consumers fully understand just what was being collected and shared about them, what could they do to stop it? Is there an opt-out? Is it in fine print? Is it visible? Do they have this choice, to stop it? Consumers demand the same degree of anonymity on the Internet that they have in a shopping mall? Fair question. I want to close by emphasizing an important point. The consumer I'm concerned about is not a savvy computer whiz kid. I'm not talking about a lawyer who reads legalese for a living and can delve into fine print of what privacy protections he or she is getting. I am talking about ordinary Internet users. I'm talking about a 55-year-old coal miner in West Virginia who sends an e-mail to his son in college, where he is very proud that he is studying. I'm talking about a 30-year-old mother who uses her broadband connection to research the best doctor she can take her sick toddler to see. I'm talking about a 65-year- old man who has just signed up for a Facebook account so he can view photos of his grandson and reconnect with old friends. We have a duty to ask whether these people, and the millions of Americans just like them, fully understand and associate what information is being collected about them, and whether or not they're empowered to stop certain practices from taking place. We have two terrific panels of witnesses today. I want to thank those two chairmen before me, and the others who will follow, for spending their time with us. Senator Hutchison is not here. This is an extraordinarily important hearing--groundbreaking, I hope; and problem solving, I hope. So, I would ask any of my colleagues--Senator Warner, do you have a statement you would like to make? Senator Warner. No comments at this time. The Chairman. Absolute silence from the Committee? STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE JOHANNS, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA Senator Johanns. Mr. Chairman, your comments were so good; I want to associate myself with them. Most importantly, I want to say thank you for conducting this hearing. You can see, by the turnout, that obviously people are interested in this topic. I don't like the sounds of what you describe, just to be very blunt about it. And I am hoping the witnesses, as they parade before us, can soothe my fears here about how much people know about my background just because I choose to use a certain search engine. And so, I think maybe it's time to just go to the witnesses. But, excellent opening comment. The Chairman. I added, with amusement, a comment. My wife and I have four children. They're all between 30 and 40 years old. They're all really good on the computer. Not as good as the two witnesses at the table, but pretty close. And I told them about the hearing we were having today. They were shocked, ``How can you do that? This is the future?'' and, ``These are great companies,'' et cetera, et cetera. So, I left my hearing book with them, including my statements and the explanations, questions and all that kind of thing. And they said, ``Well, we're busy right now.'' I said, ``Well, just return it to my door before dawn,'' which they did. So, that goes in the record. [Laughter.] The Chairman. Julius Genachowski, do you want to start? STATEMENT OF HON. JULIUS GENACHOWSKI, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Mr. Genachowski. I'm happy to. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the important issue of consumer privacy. Privacy is central to our Nation's values and way of life. And the FCC has long worked to protect the privacy of consumers who rely on our Nation's communications infrastructure. Privacy has deep intrinsic value. It is also critical for promoting investment, innovation, and adoption of cutting-edge communications technologies that bolster our economy, promote our global competitiveness, and improve our daily lives. When consumers fear that privacy is at risk, they are less likely to use new communications technologies and services. The Commission's National Broadband Plan concluded that even as consumers learn the benefits of Internet connectivity, they are rightly concerned about privacy online. The plan also discusses how both consumers and companies can benefit from innovative personalized services based on an appropriate use of consumer information. The plan that's recognized is that promoting both broadband and consumer privacy are key to harnessing the opportunities of the Internet. Among the Commission's key principles, when it comes to privacy, are to ensure that consumers--ordinary consumers--are empowered to control how their information is used, that providers are transparent about their practices, and that personal data is secured in a way that protects consumers, including from malicious third parties. The Communications Act includes provisions on consumer privacy relating to telecommunications carriers, cable and satellite companies. And the Commission has extended privacy protections to consumers of interconnected voice-over-IP services. The Commission has been active in enforcing the consumer privacy rules under our jurisdiction. In just the last year, the Commission took action against nearly 300 companies that failed to certify their compliance with our privacy rules, actions against these telecommunications carriers that ranged from issuing notices of apparent liability to imposing fines. The Commission has also adopted rules and worked with the Federal Trade Commission to implement the Do Not Call law, to protect consumers from unsolicited calls, and has adopted rules to prohibit junk faxes. In 2009, the Commission has enforced these provisions against over 400 companies. Historically, the Commission has also worked with the FTC to prevent pre-texting. As telephone and cable companies increasingly provide broadband services, they have growing access to significant and sensitive consumer information. In this regard, the National Broadband Plan reviewed the current regulatory landscape regarding online privacy and found that the existing framework, in some cases, is confusing and would benefit from increased clarity. The Broadband Plan recommended that the FCC work closely on these issues with the Federal Trade Commission. I'm pleased to report that, as recommended by the Broadband Plan, our agencies have formed a joint task force to develop effective and coordinated approaches to protecting online privacy. We're currently working together on education and transparency initiatives to help inform and empower consumers. The FCC is a leading member of OnGuard Online, a coalition of private and private--public and private organizations, spearheaded by the FTC, that provides advice to consumers on protecting their personal information. The FTC has shown consistent leadership here. And, as part of the FCC's focus on consumers, the agency is, today, launching a new online consumer help center. This website will allow consumers to easily access the many resources that the FCC has developed to help consumers, including with respect to privacy issues, such as a consumer- friendly system for filing complaints; and news, information, and advice for consumers. The National Broadband Plan also emphasized that our networks are vulnerable to cyber attacks that can expose personal information. In this regard, the FCC recently began an inquiry on the merits of establishing a certification program for cybersecurity standards and best practices as part of its work on privacy and security. As we continue to move forward in online privacy, security, and other vital issues, it is important that uncertainties in the regulatory framework be resolved. What matters most is the consumer. I look forward to working with the Committee on these issues. And I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Genachowski follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Julius Genachowski, Chairman, Federal Communications Commission Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Hutchison, members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to discuss the important issue of consumer privacy. The right to privacy is central to our Nation's values and way of life, and the Federal Communications Commission has long worked to implement Congress's directive to protect the privacy of consumers who rely on our Nation's communications infrastructure. The Commission also recognizes that privacy has more than intrinsic value: it is critical for promoting investment, innovation, and adoption of cutting edge communications technologies and services that bolster our economy, promote our global competitiveness, and improve our daily lives. When consumers fear that their privacy is at risk, they are less likely to use new means of communication. As the National Broadband Plan that the FCC sent to Congress in March recognizes, even as consumers learn the benefits of Internet connectivity, they are rightly concerned about their privacy online. Consumers are concerned about third parties having access to, and potentially misusing, sensitive information about their online activities, including website visits and searches, e-mail messages, geographic location, health records, energy usage, and purchasing history. At the same time, the National Broadband Plan explains that both consumers and companies can benefit from innovative personalized services based on an appropriate use of consumer information. In the digital economy, digital identities can potentially be beneficial, if consumers are empowered and private information is safeguarded. The Plan thus recognizes that promoting both broadband and privacy are key to harnessing the opportunities of the Internet. The Commission's overarching goals when it comes to privacy are to ensure that consumers are empowered to control how their information is used; that providers are transparent about their practices; and that personal data is handled in a way that protects consumers, including from malicious third parties. In some respects the Internet presents unique privacy challenges, but these principles remain the starting point for protecting consumer privacy. The Communications Act includes several key provisions on consumer privacy. Section 222, for example, requires telecommunications carriers to safeguard information about who consumers communicate with, the length of time they spend using the network, and their location when they use wired or wireless services. Sections 338 and 631 provide corresponding protections for users of services provided over cable and satellite systems. The Commission has formed an internal working group to coordinate the work of its bureaus and offices as they develop policies and take enforcement action under these provisions. The Commission has adopted strong rules to protect consumers of traditional services, and has extended protections to consumers of interconnected Voice over IP services. In just the last year, the Commission has taken action against nearly 300 companies that failed to file timely certifications of their compliance with these rules, including issuing thirteen notices of apparent liability to repeat offenders who failed to file timely certifications for two consecutive years. The FCC also issued an Enforcement Advisory reminding companies of their obligation to file an annual certification of compliance with the CPNI rules, and settled an investigation into one carrier's privacy rule violations. The settlement includes a fine and a compliance plan designed to prevent future violations. In addition, implementing the important ``Do Not Call'' provisions of the Communications Act, the Commission has worked with the FTC to protect consumers from unsolicited calls, and has adopted rules to prohibit junk faxes. Since 2009, the Commission has enforced these provisions against over 400 companies. Among other actions, the FCC has issued 14 forfeiture orders. The Commission has also collaborated with the FTC to prevent pre-texting, the practice whereby third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to telephone subscribers' personal information. As telephone and cable companies increasingly provide Internet access services, they continue to have access to significant and sensitive consumer information regarding customers' Internet communications. The networks operated by Internet service providers are a conduit for their customers' Internet communications, and providers' failure to properly protect consumers' account information can result in the unintended disclosure of personal data to third parties. The National Broadband Plan reviewed the current regulatory landscape regarding online privacy, and found that the existing framework in some cases is confusing and would benefit from increased clarity. The Broadband Plan recommended that the FCC work closely on these issues with the Federal Trade Commission, which has strong expertise on online privacy. I am pleased to report that, as recommended by the Broadband Plan, our agencies have formed a Joint Task Force to develop innovative, effective and coordinated approaches to protecting online privacy. We are currently working together on education and transparency initiatives to help inform and empower consumers in connection with online privacy. We are also working on strategies to help educate consumers with wireless home networks about the need to adopt encryption or other security protections to safeguard their information. In addition, the FCC is a leading member of OnGuard Online, a coalition of public and private organizations spearheaded by the FTC that provides advice to consumers on protecting their personal information, guarding against Internet fraud, and protecting children's privacy online. Several months ago, I was pleased to join Chairman Leibowitz and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to unveil Net Cetera, a guide for parents that covers a variety of issues that children face growing up in an increasingly digital world, including privacy. And as part of its focus on consumers, the FCC is today launching a new online Consumer Help Center. This website will allow consumers to easily access the many resources that the FCC has developed to help consumers, including a consumer-friendly system for filing complaints; news about our major consumer initiatives; and tips and advisories. The National Broadband Plan emphasized that the vulnerability of our communications networks to malicious attack--including malware and other attacks that can expose personal information--is a vital issue that is appropriately receiving broader and more focused attention. This October, the Commission will work closely with the FTC and other Federal agencies to launch a consumer education campaign for National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. The FCC recently began an inquiry into whether we should establish a certification program under which service providers could be certified for their compliance with specific cybersecurity standards and best practices. As we move forward on online privacy, cybersecurity, and other vital issues, it is important that uncertainties in the regulatory framework be resolved. I look forward to working with the Committee on these issues. And I look forward to your questions. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Jon Leibowitz. STATEMENT OF HON. JONATHAN D. LEIBOWITZ, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION Mr. Leibowitz. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Kerry, Senator Warner, Senator Thune, Senator LeMieux, Senator Johanns. I appreciate the opportunity to be here at this, the first full Committee privacy hearing in the Commerce Committee. And let me begin by thanking you, Mr. Chairman and, really, this entire committee, for your support in protecting the FTC's jurisdiction to stop predatory financial practices as part of the financial reform legislation. Let me also note how pleased I am to be here with my friend and colleague Julius Genachowski. Consumer privacy has been a key FTC priority for the past two decades. Our privacy program operates on two main tracks: enforcement and policy development. On the enforcement front, one of our most successful privacy initiatives has been the ``Do Not Call Registry,'' which has given Americans some peace and quiet during their dinner hour, and which the humorous Dave Barry called, ``The most successful government program since the Elvis stamp.'' We vigorously enforce the requirements of the registry. We brought more than 64 actions alleging violations of the ``Do Not Call'' rule. And, just this month, the Do Not Call Registry surpassed 200 million telephone numbers--200 million. We think that might make us almost as popular, perhaps even more popular, than the Elvis stamp. Another enforcement priority is data security, where we have brought dozens of cases. Just today, we announced our latest data security case, this one against Rite Aid. Our complaint alleges that Rite Aid violated FTC Act by, among other things, throwing away personal, private health information, financial information, and employment records into open dumpsters, where anyone could find them and take what they wanted. Our order requires Rite Aid to maintain reasonable data security and independent security audits every 2 years for the next 20 years. Rite Aid has also agreed to pay a million dollars to resolve HHS allegations that it violated HIPAA. Let me now turn to policy development. Over the years, we've hosted workshops, we've issued reports, and encouraged self-regulation on privacy issues. For example, last year we released a report setting forth principles to guide self- regulatory efforts in the area of behavioral advertising. The report was a catalyst for a number of private-sector initiatives. And, while these initiatives are in their formative stages, they are encouraging. More broadly, over the last few months we've hosted a series of roundtables examining consumer privacy in light of changing technologies and business models, including social networking, cloud computing, and mobile devices. We intend to release a public report on the roundtables, later this year, containing additional recommendations in three main areas: First, many roundtable participants stated that companies should begin to bake in, or incorporate, privacy protections into their everyday business practices, such as reasonable security and data accuracy. This is sometimes known as ``privacy by design.'' We'd like to further explore how to encourage companies to implement this concept. Second, the FTC is considering how to simplify the privacy choices presented to consumers. One way would be to recognize that consent may not be needed for certain commonly accepted business practices. So, for example, it may be unnecessary, and even distracting, to ask a consumer to consent to sharing his or her address information with a shipping company for purposes of shipping a product, like a book from Amazon that he or she may have requested. By eliminating the need for choice for these practices, consumers can focus on the choices that really matter. Another way to simplify choice is to present it at a time and place when the consumer is making a decision about his or her data, rather than a long, small-print, difficult-to-read, multiple-clicks-away privacy policy. It may also be useful to have some consistency and simplicity in the way that choices are presented so that consumers aren't constantly bombarded with having to make choices. To this end, one idea we may explore, in the context of behavioral advertising, is a Do Not Track mechanism that's more comprehensive and easier to use than the procedures currently available, usually through a browser. Under such a mechanism consumers could opt-out of behavioral advertising more easily, rather than having to make choices on a web-site-by-web-site basis. Third idea from the roundtables involves increasing transparency about privacy. For example, privacy policies could use standard formats so that consumers could compare privacy protections offered by different companies, and companies could sort of compete on their ability to protect privacy. The Commission is also considering how to best improve transparency in the data broker industry. One final item before I conclude. We have a long history of working cooperatively with the FCC, including, most recently, on the net neutrality proceedings in National Broadband Plan. In connection with that work, we're, today, announcing a joint FCC/FTC task force to implement the privacy recommendations of the National Broadband Plan. But, to further our ability to work together, we renew our longstanding request to repeal the anachronistic common-carrier exemption in the FTC Act. Repeal of the common-carrier exemption would not affect the FCC's ability to protect consumers, but it would ensure that both agencies are able to work collaboratively to best protect consumers. Let me thank you for the opportunity to appear here today. We look forward to working with this committee, and are happy to take questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Leibowitz follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Jonathan D. Leibowitz, Chairman, Federal Trade Commission Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member Hutchison, and members of the Committee, I am Jon Leibowitz, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'' or ``Commission''). I appreciate the opportunity to present the Commission's testimony on privacy.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ This written statement represents the views of the Federal Trade Commission. My oral presentation and responses are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission or of any Commissioner. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Privacy has been central to the Commission's consumer protection mission for more than a decade. Over the years, the Commission has employed a variety of strategies to protect consumer privacy, including law enforcement, regulation, outreach to consumers and businesses, and policy initiatives.\\2\\ In 2006, recognizing the increasing importance of privacy to consumers and a healthy marketplace, the FTC established the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, which is devoted exclusively to privacy-related issues.\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Information on the FTC's privacy initiatives generally may be found at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/index.html. \\3\\ Prior to 2006, the Commission's Division of Financial Practices worked on privacy issues in addition to enforcing laws related to mortgage transactions, debt servicing, debt collection, fair lending, and payday lending. A different division was responsible for identity theft. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although the FTC's commitment to consumer privacy has remained constant, its policy approaches have evolved over time. This testimony describes the Commission's efforts to protect consumer privacy over the past two decades, including its two main policy approaches: (1) promoting the fair information practices of notice, choice, access, and security (the ``FTC Fair Information Practices approach''); and (2) protecting consumers from specific and tangible privacy harms (the ``harm-based approach''). It then discusses recent developments, including the FTC staff's Privacy Roundtables project--a major initiative to re-examine traditional approaches to privacy protection in light of new technologies and business models. Next, it sets forth some preliminary suggestions for moving forward on consumer privacy issues. It concludes by discussing our proposal to repeal the common carrier exemption for telecommunications providers. I. The FTC's Efforts to Protect Consumer Privacy The FTC has a long track record of protecting consumer privacy. The Commission's early work on privacy issues dates back to its initial implementation in 1970 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (``FCRA''),\\4\\ which includes provisions to promote the accuracy of credit reporting information and protect the privacy of that information. With the emergence of the Internet and the growth of electronic commerce beginning in the mid-1990s, the FTC expanded its focus to include online privacy issues. Since then, both online and offline privacy issues have been at the forefront of the Commission's agenda, as discussed in greater detail below. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ 15 U.S.C. 1681e-i. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A. The FTC's Fair Information Practices Approach Beginning in the mid-1990s, the FTC began addressing consumer concerns about the privacy of personal information provided in connection with online transactions. The Commission developed an approach by building on earlier initiatives outlining the ``Fair Information Practice Principles,'' which embodied the important underlying concepts of transparency, consumer autonomy, and accountability.\\5\\ In developing its approach, the FTC reviewed a series of reports, guidelines, and model codes regarding privacy practices issued since the mid-1970s by government agencies in the United States, Canada, and Europe. From this work, the FTC identified four widely accepted principles as the basis of its own Fair Information Practices approach: (1) businesses should provide notice of what information they collect from consumers and how they use it; (2) consumers should be given choices about how information collected from them may be used; (3) consumers should be able to access data collected about them; and (4) businesses should take reasonable steps to ensure the security of the information they collect from consumers. The Commission also identified enforcement--the use of a reliable mechanism to impose sanctions for noncompliance with the fair information principles--as a critical component of any self-regulatory program to ensure privacy online.\\6\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ This work included the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's 1973 report, Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens, available at http://aspe.hhs.gov/datacncl/1973privacy/c7.htm, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's 1980 Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, available at http://www.oecd.org/document/18/ 0,3343,en_2649_34255_1815186_1_1_1_1,00.html. \\6\\ See Federal Trade Commission, Privacy Online: A Report to Congress (June 1998), available at http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/ priv-23.shtm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To evaluate industry's compliance with these principles, the Commission examined website information practices and disclosures; conducted surveys of online privacy policies, commented on self- regulatory efforts, and issued reports to Congress. In 2000, the Commission reported to Congress that, although there had been improvement in industry self-regulatory efforts to develop and post privacy policies online, approximately one-quarter of the privacy policies surveyed addressed the four fair information practice principles of notice, choice, access, and security.\\7\\ A majority of the Commission concluded that legislation requiring online businesses to comply with these principles, in conjunction with self-regulation, would allow the electronic marketplace to reach its full potential and give consumers the confidence they need to participate fully in that marketplace.\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ See Federal Trade Commission, Privacy Online: Fair Information Practices in the Electronic Marketplace (May 2000) at 13-14, available at http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy2000/privacy2000.pdf. \\8\\ Id. at 36-38. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although Congress did not pass the legislation recommended by the Commission, the Commission's efforts during this time, particularly its surveys, reports, and workshops, were widely credited with raising public awareness about privacy and leading companies to post privacy policies for the first time.\\9\\ The Commission also encouraged self- regulatory efforts designed to benefit consumers, such as the development of best practices, improvements in privacy-enhancing technologies, and the creation of online privacy certification programs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ In 1999, Congress also passed the Gramm-Leach Bliley-Act, 15 U.S.C. 6821-27, requiring all financial institutions to provide notice of their data practices and choice for sharing data with third parties. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Commission also brought law enforcement actions to hold companies accountable for their privacy statements and practices. In February 1999, for example, the Commission alleged that GeoCities, one of the most visited websites at the time, had misrepresented the purposes for which it was collecting personal information from both children and adults.\\10\\ In 2000, the Commission challenged a website's attempts to sell personal customer information, despite the representation in its privacy policy that such information would never be disclosed to a third party.\\11\\ These cases stressed the importance of keeping promises about the use of consumer information and demonstrated the Commission's commitment to protecting online privacy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ In the Matter of GeoCities, Inc., FTC Docket No. C-3850 (Feb. 5 1999) (consent order). \\11\\ FTC v.

The Harm-Based Approach In the early 2000s, the FTC de-emphasized its fair information practices approach as the primary means of addressing privacy issues, and shifted its focus to a ``harm-based approach'' for protecting consumer privacy. The approach was designed to target harmful uses of information--those presenting risks to physical security or economic injury, or causing unwarranted intrusions in our daily lives--rather than imposing costly notice and choice for all uses of information.\\12\\ The Commission's privacy agenda began to focus primarily on: (1) data security enforcement; (2) identity theft; (3) children's privacy; and (4) protecting consumers from spam, spyware, and telemarketing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ See, e.g., Speech of Timothy J. Muris, Protecting Consumers' Privacy: 2002 and Beyond, Cleveland, Ohio, Oct. 4, 2001, available at http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/muris/privisp1002 .shtm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Data Security Enforcement Maintaining and promoting data security in the private sector has been a key component of the FTC's privacy agenda. Through its substantial record of enforcement actions, the FTC has emphasized the importance of maintaining reasonable security for consumer data, so that it does not fall into the hands of identity thieves and other wrongdoers. The FTC enforces several laws with data security requirements. The Commission's Safeguards Rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, for example, contains data security requirements for financial institutions.\\13\\ The FCRA requires consumer reporting agencies to use reasonable procedures to ensure that the entities to which they disclose sensitive consumer information have a permissible purpose for receiving that information,\\14\\ and imposes safe disposal obligations on entities that maintain consumer report information.\\15\\ In addition, the Commission enforces the FTC Act's prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in cases where a business makes false or misleading claims about its data security procedures, or where its failure to employ reasonable security measures causes or is likely to cause substantial consumer injury.\\16\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ 16 C.F.R.

Navone, No. 2:08-CV-001842 (final order filed D. Nev. Dec. 30, 2009); United States v. American United Mortgage, No. 1:07-CV-07064 (N.D. Ill. final order filed Jan. 28, 2008); In the Matter of CVS Caremark Corp., FTC Docket No. C-4259 (June 18, 2009). \\23\\ See, e.g., United States v. Rental Research Servs., No. 09 CV 524 (D. Minn. final order filed Mar. 6, 2009); United States v. ChoicePoint, Inc., No. 1:06-CV-0198 (final order filed N.D. Ga. Oct. 14, 2009). \\24\\ In addition, beginning with the CVS case announced last year, the Commission has begun to challenge the reasonableness of security measures to protect employee data, in addition to customer data. See, e.g., In the Matter of CVS Caremark Corp., FTC Docket No. C-4259 (Jun. 18, 2009) (consent order). \\25\\ See, e.g., FTC v. Navone, No. 2:08-CV-001842 (D. Nev. final order Dec. 29, 2009); United States v. ChoicePoint, Inc., No. 1:06-CV- 0198 (final order filed N.D. Ga. Oct. 14, 2009). \\26\\ Developments in state law have also played a major role in data security. The passage of state data breach notification laws beginning in 2003 required increased transparency for companies that had suffered data breaches and thus further enhanced the Commission's data security enforcement efforts. See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Code 1798.29, 1798.82-1789.84 (West 2003). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Identity Theft Another important part of the Commission's privacy agenda has been protecting consumers from identity theft, which victimizes millions of consumers every year. In 1998, Congress enacted the Identity Theft Assumption and Deterrence Act (``the Act''), which provided the FTC with a specific role in combating identity theft.\\27\\ To fulfill the Act's mandate, the Commission created a telephone hotline and dedicated website to collect complaints and assist victims, through which approximately 20,000 consumers contact the FTC every week. The FTC also maintains and promotes a centralized database of victim complaints that serves as an investigative tool for over 1,700 law enforcement agencies. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ 18 U.S.C. 1028 note. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Commission also played a lead role in the President's Identity Theft Task Force (``Task Force''). The Task Force, comprised of 17 Federal agencies and co-chaired by the FTC's Chairman, was established by President Bush in May 2006 to develop a comprehensive national strategy to combat identity theft.\\28\\ In April 2007, the Task Force published its national strategy, recommending 31 initiatives to reduce the incidence and impact of identity theft.\\29\\ The FTC, along with the other Task Force agencies, has been actively implementing these initiatives and submitted a final report in September 2008.\\30\\ Among other things, the Commission has trained victim assistance counselors, Federal and state prosecutors, and law enforcement officials; developed and published an Identity Theft Victim Statement of Rights; and worked closely with the American Bar Association on a pro bono legal assistance program for identity theft victims. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ Exec. Order No. 13,402, 71 Fed. Reg. 27,945 (May 15, 2006). \\29\\ See The President's Identity Theft Task Force, Combating Identity Theft: A Strategic Plan (2007), available at http:// www.idtheft.gov/reports/StrategicPlan.pdf (recommending that key agencies work together to combat identity theft by strengthening law enforcement, educating consumers and businesses, and increasing the safeguards employed by Federal agencies and the private sector to protect personal data). \\30\\ See The President's Identity Theft Task Force Report (2008), available at http://www.idtheft.gov/reports/IDTReport2008.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, the Commission has worked to implement the identity theft protections of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the ``FACT Act'').\\31\\ Among other things, the FTC has acted aggressively to enforce consumers' right under the FACT Act to receive a free credit report every twelve months from each of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies, so they can spot incipient signs of identity theft. For example, the Commission has brought action against a company offering a so-called ``free'' credit report that was actually tied to the purchase of a credit monitoring service.\\32\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ Pub. L. 108-159 (2003). \\32\\ FTC v. Consumerinfo.com, Inc., SACV05-801AHS(MLGx) (C.D. Cal. final order filed Jan. 8, 2007). To provide further clarity to consumers, Congress recently enacted legislation requiring entities that advertise ``free'' credit reports to disclose that such reports are available pursuant to Federal law at www.annualcreditreport.com. See Pub. L. 111-24, codified at 15 U.S.C. 1681j(g). The FTC has promulgated a rule to implement this requirement, 16 C.F.R. 610, and announced last week that it issued eighteen warning letters to companies alleging failures to comply with the rule. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Children's Privacy The Commission has also undertaken an aggressive agenda to protect children's privacy. Since the enactment of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act in 1998 (``COPPA'') and its implementing rule,\\33\\ the FTC has brought 15 actions against website operators that collect information from children without first obtaining their parents' consent. Through these actions, the FTC has obtained more than $3.2 million in civil penalties.\\34\\ The Commission is currently conducting a comprehensive review of its COPPA Rule in light of changing technology, such as the increased use of mobile devices to access the Internet.\\35\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\33\\ 15 U.S.C. 6501-6508; 16 C.F.R. Part 312. \\34\\ For a list of the FTC's COPPA cases, see http://www.ftc.gov/ privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens_enf.html. \\35\\ In spring 2010, the FTC announced it was seeking comment on a broad array of issues as part of its review of the COPPA Rule. See http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/ childrens_2010rulereview.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Unwarranted Intrusions The Commission has also acted to protect consumers from unwarranted intrusions into their daily lives, particularly in the areas of unwanted telemarketing calls, spam, and spyware. Perhaps the Commission's most well-known privacy initiative is the Do Not Call Registry, which has been an unqualified success. The Commission vigorously enforces the requirements of the Registry to ensure its ongoing effectiveness. The FTC has brought 64 actions alleging violations of the Do Not Call Rule. These actions have resulted in $39.9 million in civil penalties and $17.7 million in consumer redress or disgorgement. During the past year, the Commission has filed several new actions that attack the use of harassing ``robocalls''--the automated delivery of prerecorded messages--to deliver deceptive telemarketing pitches that promise consumers extended auto warranties and credit card interest rate reduction services.\\36\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ See, e.g., FTC v. Asia-Pacific Telecom, Inc., No. 10 CV 3168 (N.D. Ill., filed May 24, 2010). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, since the enactment of the CAN-SPAM Act in 2003,\\37\\ the Commission has brought dozens of law enforcement actions challenging spam, including cases involving deceptive spam, failure to honor opt-out requests, and failure to comply with requirements for adult labeling of spam messages.\\38\\ For example, in June 2009, the FTC moved quickly to shut down a rogue Internet Service Provider (``ISP'') that knowingly hosted and actively participated in the distribution of illegal spam, child pornography, and other harmful electronic content. The FTC complaint alleged that the defendant actively recruited and colluded with criminals seeking to distribute illegal, malicious, and harmful electronic content.\\39\\ After the Commission shut down this ISP, there was a temporary 30 percent drop in spam worldwide.\\40\\ Finally, since 2004, the Commission has brought 15 spyware cases, targeting programs foisting voluminous pop-up ads on consumers and subjecting them to nefarious programs that track their keystrokes and online activities.\\41\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\37\\ 15 U.S.C. 7701-7713. \\38\\ Detailed information regarding these actions is available at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/spam/press.htm. \\39\\ FTC v.

Ongoing Outreach and Policy Initiatives While the Commission's consumer privacy models have evolved throughout the years, its activities in a number of areas have remained constant. In addition to enforcement, these include consumer and business education, research and policymaking on emerging technology issues, and international outreach. 1. Consumer and Business Education The FTC has done pioneering outreach to business and consumers, particularly in the area of consumer privacy and data security. The Commission's well-known OnGuard Online website educates consumers about threats such as spyware, phishing, laptop security, and identity theft.\\42\\ The FTC also developed a guide to help small and medium- sized businesses implement appropriate data security for the personal information they collect and maintain.\\43\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\42\\ See http://www.onguardonline.gov. Since its launch in 2005, OnGuard Online and its Spanish-language counterpart Alertaena L!nea have attracted nearly 12 million unique visits. \\43\\ See Protecting Personal Information: A Guide For Business, available at http://www.ftc.gov/infosecurity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The FTC has also developed resources specifically for children, parents, and teachers to help kids stay safe online. In response to the Broadband Data Improvement Act of 2008, the FTC produced the brochure Net Cetera: Chatting with Kids About Being Online to give adults practical tips to help children navigate the online world.\\44\\ In less than 10 months, the Commission already has distributed more than 3.8 million copies of its Net Cetera brochure to schools and communities nationwide. The Commission also offers specific guidance for certain types of Internet services, including, for example, social networking and peer-to-peer file sharing.\\45\\ In addition, the Commission recently launched Admongo.gov, a campaign to help kids better understand the ads they see online and offline.\\46\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\44\\ See FTC Press Release, OnGuardOnline.gov Off to a Fast Start with Online Child Safety Campaign (Mar. 31, 2010), available at http:// www.ftc.gov/opa/2010/03/netcetera.shtm. \\45\\ See http://www.onguardonline.gov/topics/social-networking- sites.aspx. \\46\\ See FTC Press Release, FTC Helps Prepare Kids for a World Where Advertising is Everywhere (Apr. 28, 2010), available at http:// www.ftc.gov/opa/2010/04/admongo1.shtm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Research and Policymaking on Emerging Technology Issues Over the past two decades, the Commission has hosted numerous workshops to examine the implications of new technologies on privacy, including forums on spam, spyware, radio-frequency identification (RFID), mobile marketing, contactless payment, peer-to-peer file sharing, and online behavioral advertising. These workshops often spur innovation and self-regulatory efforts. For example, the FTC has been assessing the privacy implications of online behavioral advertising for several years. In February 2009, the Commission staff released a report that set forth several principles to guide self-regulatory efforts in this area: (1) transparency and consumer control; (2) reasonable security and limited retention for consumer data; (3) affirmative express consent for material retroactive changes to privacy policies; and (4) affirmative express consent for (or prohibition against) the use of sensitive data.\\47\\ This report was the catalyst for industry to institute a number of self-regulatory advances. While these efforts are still in their developmental stages, they are encouraging. We will continue to work with industry to improve consumer control and understanding of the evolving use of online behavioral advertising. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\47\\ FTC Staff Report: Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (Feb. 2009), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/ 2009/02/P085400behavadreport.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. International Outreach Another major privacy priority for the FTC has been cross-border privacy and international enforcement cooperation. The Commission's efforts in this area are gaining greater importance with the proliferation of cross-border data flows, cloud computing, and on- demand data processing that takes place across national borders. To protect consumers in this rapidly changing environment, the FTC participates in various international policy initiatives, including those in multilateral organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC). In APEC, the FTC actively promotes an initiative to establish a self-regulatory framework governing the privacy of data transfers throughout the APEC region. The FTC just announced that it was one of the first participants in the APEC cross-border Privacy Enforcement Arrangement, a multilateral cooperation network for APEC privacy enforcement authorities. In a similar vein, earlier this year, the FTC, joined by a number of its international counterparts, launched the Global Privacy Enforcement Network, an informal initiative organized in cooperation with OECD, to strengthen cooperation in the enforcement of privacy laws. Finally, the Commission is using its expanded powers under the U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2006 \\48\\ to promote cooperation in cross-border law enforcement, including in the privacy area. The FTC has also brought a number of cases relating to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, which enables U.S. companies to transfer personal data from Europe to the U.S. consistent with European privacy law.\\49\\ For example, last fall, the Commission announced enforcement actions alleging that seven companies falsely claimed to be part of the Framework. The orders against six of these companies prohibit them from misrepresenting their participation in any privacy, security, or other compliance program.\\50\\ The seventh case is still in litigation.\\51\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\48\\ Pub. L. No. 109-455 (2006) (codified in scattered sections of 15 U.S.C. and 12 U.S.C. 3412(e)). \\49\\ Companies self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce their compliance with a set of Safe Harbor privacy principles. If a company falsely claims to be part of this program, or fails to abide by its requirements, the FTC can challenge such actions under its deception authority. \\50\\ See In the Matter of Directors Desk LLC, FTC Docket No. C-4281 (Jan. 12, 2010); In the Matter of World Innovators, Inc., FTC Docket No. C-4282 (Jan. 12, 2010); In the Matter of Collectify LLC, FTC Docket No. C-4272 (Nov. 9, 2009); In the Matter of ExpatEdge Partners, LLC, FTC Docket No. C-4269 (Nov. 9, 2009); In the Matter of Onyx Graphics, Inc., FTC Docket No. C-4270 (Nov. 9, 2009); In the Matter of Progressive Gaitways LLC, FTC Docket No. C-4271 (Nov. 9, 2009). \\51\\ See FTC v. Kavarni, Civil Action No. 09-CV-5276 (C.D. Cal. filed July 31, 2009). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- II. Lessons Learned Although the Commission plans to continue its ongoing enforcement, policy, and education initiatives, it recognizes that the traditional models governing consumer privacy have their limitations. The Fair Information Practices model, as implemented, has put too much burden on consumers to read and understand lengthy and complicated privacy policies and then make numerous choices about the collection and use of their data. Indeed, privacy policies have become complicated legal documents that often seem designed to limit companies' liability, rather than to inform consumers about their information practices. The harm-based model has principally focused on financial or other tangible harm rather than the exposure of personal information where there is no financial or measurable consequence from that exposure.\\52\\ Yet there are situations in which consumers do not want personal information to be shared even where there may be no risk of financial harm. For example, a consumer may not want information about his or her medical condition to be available to third-party marketers, even if receiving advertising based on that condition might not cause a financial harm. In addition, some have criticized the harm-based model as being inherently reactive--addressing harms to consumers after they occur, rather than taking preventative measures before the information is collected, used, or shared in ways that are contrary to consumer expectations.\\53\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\52\\ See Speech of Timothy J. Muris, Protecting Consumers' Privacy: 2002 and Beyond, Cleveland, Ohio, October 4, 2001, available at http:// www.ftc.gov/speeches/muris/privisp1002.shtm. \\53\\ See Daniel J. Solove, Identity Theft, Privacy, and the Architecture of Vulnerability, 54 Hastings L.J. 1, 5 (2003). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition, there are questions about whether these models can keep pace with the rapid developments in such areas as online behavioral advertising, cloud computing, mobile services, and social networking. For example, is it realistic to expect consumers to read privacy notices on their mobile devices? How can consumer harm be clearly defined in an environment where data may be used for multiple, unanticipated purposes now or in the future? III. The FTC Privacy Roundtables To explore the privacy challenges posed by emerging technology and business practices, the Commission announced late last year that it would examine consumer privacy in a series of public roundtables.\\54\\ Through these roundtables, held in December 2009, and January and March 2010, the Commission obtained input from a broad array of stakeholders on existing approaches, developments in the marketplace, and potential new ideas.\\55\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\54\\ See FTC Press Release, FTC to Host Public Roundtables to Address Evolving Privacy Issues (Sept. 15, 2009), available at http:// www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/09/privacyrt.shtm. \\55\\ Similar efforts are underway around the world. For example, the OECD is preparing to review its 1980 Privacy Guidelines (see http:/ /www.oecd.org/document/39/0,3343,en_2649_ 34255_44946983_1_1_1_1,00.html); the European Commission is undertaking a review of the 1995 Data Protection Directive (see http:// ec.europa.eu/justice_home/news/consul ting_public/news_consulting_0003_en.htm); and the International Data Protection Commissioners' Conference released a set of draft privacy guidelines (see http://www.privacycon ference2009.org/dpas_space/Resolucion/index-iden-idphp.php). The FTC is closely following these international developments, recognizing that the market for consumer data is becoming increasingly globalized and consumer data is more easily accessed, processed, and transferred across national borders. In addition, following the FTC roundtables, the Department of Commerce also held a workshop and issued a Notice of Inquiry on the related subject of privacy and innovation, in which the FTC has submitted a comment. See In the Matter of Privacy and Innovation in the Information Economy, Docket No. 100402174-0175-01, Comments of the Federal Trade Commission (June 2008), available at http://www.ftc.gov/ os/2010/06/100623ntiacomments.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The roundtables generated significant public interest. Over 200 representatives of industry, consumer groups, academia, and government agencies participated in the roundtables, and the Commission received over 100 written comments. Several common themes emerged from these comments and the roundtable discussions. First, consumers do not understand the extent to which companies are collecting, using, aggregating, storing, and sharing their personal information. For example, as evidence of this invisible data collection and use, commenters and panelists pointed to enormous increases in data processing and storage capabilities; advances in online profiling and targeting; and the opaque business practices of data brokers,\\56\\ which are not understood by consumers. In addition, as commenters noted, consumers rarely realize that, when a company discloses that it shares information with affiliates, the company could have hundreds of affiliates. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\56\\ Data brokers compile information about individuals and sell it to others. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Second, commenters and panelists raised concerns about the tendency for companies storing data to find new uses for that data. As a result, consumers' data may be used in ways that they never contemplated. Third, commenters and roundtable participants pointed out that, as tools to re-identify supposedly anonymous information continue to evolve, the distinction between personally identifiable information (``PII'') and non-PII is losing its significance. Thus, information practices and restrictions that rely on this distinction may be losing their relevance. Fourth, commenters and roundtable participants noted the tremendous benefits from the free flow of information. Consumers receive free content and services and businesses are able to innovate and develop new services through the acquisition, exchange and use of consumer information. Commenters and participants noted that regulators should be cautious about restricting such information exchange and use, as doing so risks depriving consumers of benefits of free content and services. Fifth, commenters and roundtable participants voiced concerns about the limitations of the FTC Fair Information Practices model. Many argued that the model places too high a burden on consumers to read and understand lengthy privacy policies and then ostensibly to exercise meaningful choices based on them. Some participants also called for the adoption of other substantive data protections--including those in earlier iterations of the Fair Information Practice Principles--that impose obligations on companies, not consumers, to protect privacy. Such participants argued that consumers should not have to choose basic privacy protections, such as not retaining data for longer than it is needed, that should be built into everyday business practices. Sixth, many commenters called upon the Commission to support a more expansive view of privacy harms that goes beyond economic or tangible harms. There are some privacy harms, these participants argued, that pose real threats to consumers--such as exposure of information about health conditions or sexual orientation--but cannot be assigned a dollar value. Finally, many participants highlighted industry efforts to improve transparency for consumers about the collection and use of their information. At the same time, commenters questioned whether the tools are consistent and simple enough for consumers to embrace and use effectively. IV. Next Steps The themes that emerged through the roundtable project have led the Commission to consider several ways to improve consumer privacy. Commission staff intends to release a report later this year in which it expects to discuss several issues, as described preliminarily below. A. Integrating Privacy Into Business Practices Many roundtable panelists and commenters raised the importance of companies' incorporating privacy and security protections into their everyday business practices.\\57\\ A number of roundtable participants and commenters emphasized the value of building privacy and security protections into company procedures, systems, and technologies at the outset, so that they are an integral part of a company's business model. Such protections include providing reasonable security for consumer data, collecting only the data needed for a specific business purpose, retaining data only as long as necessary to fulfill that purpose, and implementing reasonable procedures to promote data accuracy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\57\\ See generally, Privacy Roundtable Transcripts of December 7, 2009, January 28, 2010, and March 17, 2010, available at http://htc- 01.media.globix.net/COMP008760MOD1/ftc_web/FTCindex.html and the Privacy Roundtable public comments, available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/ comments/privacyroundtable/index.shtm. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Panelists and commenters stated that these measures would provide consumers with substantive protections without placing the burden on them to read long notices and make cumbersome choices. The Commission also notes that many businesses already are providing these types of protections as a matter of good business practice or due to existing sectoral laws.\\58\\ Accordingly, the Commission is exploring whether and how to encourage companies to incorporate these protections into their practices, whether there are other protections that companies should incorporate, and how to balance the costs and benefits of such protections. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\58\\ See Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681e-i; Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act, 16 C.F.R. Part 314, implementing 15 U.S.C. 6801(b); cases cited supra n. 17. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B. Simplifying Choice The Commission is also considering whether and how to simplify the privacy choices presented to consumers. One way would be to recognize that consumers do not need to exercise choice for certain commonly accepted business practices--those that fall within reasonable consumer expectations. By eliminating the need to exercise choice for these practices, consumers can focus on the choices that really matter to them, and on uses of data that they would not expect when they engage in a transaction. Simplifying choice should also reduce the burdens on businesses. Such commonly accepted business practices may include fulfillment, fraud prevention and responding to legal process, internal analytics, and sharing data with service providers that are acting at the company's direction. For example, it may be unnecessary, and even distracting, to ask a consumer to consent to sharing his or her address information with a shipping company for purposes of shipping a product that the consumer has requested. The Commission is considering how to define these commonly accepted business practices. The Commission is also exploring--in cases where choice would be needed--how to ensure that such choice is more meaningful. For example, rather than discussing choices in a long privacy policy, it may be most effective to present choices ``just-in-time,'' at the point when the consumer is providing the data or otherwise engaging with a company. It also may be beneficial to have greater consistency in the way that choices are presented and expressed, so that consumers can better understand and compare companies' privacy practices. In addition, the Commission is examining how best to protect and provide effective choice for the use of sensitive information, such as health, financial, children's, and location data. C. Improving Transparency The Commission also is considering a number of other ways to increase transparency about commercial data practices. First, the Commission believes that privacy policies should be improved. Indeed, although excessive reliance on privacy policies has been widely criticized, roundtable participants and commenters recognized the continuing value of privacy notices to promote accountability for companies. Accordingly, in its upcoming report, the Commission will discuss ways to improve the disclosures in privacy policies. One possible approach is the use of standardized terms or formats. Clearer, more standardized privacy disclosures could allow consumers to compare the privacy protections offered by different companies and potentially increase competition on privacy practices. Second, the Commission also is considering issues related to the practice of data aggregation. Roundtable participants and commenters expressed concern that data collected for one purpose can be combined with other data and then used for purposes not anticipated by the consumer. Further, unbeknownst to many consumers, companies such as data brokers collect and sell such aggregated data on a routine basis. At the roundtables, some panelists suggested that one solution would be to give consumers access to their data as a means of improving transparency. Others discussed the costs of providing access, and suggested that, if access is provided, it should vary with the sensitivity of the data and its intended use. The Commission recognizes the significant policy issues raised by access, and is examining whether the benefits of access are commensurate with the costs of implementation. The Commission is also considering whether there are other ways to promote greater transparency about the data aggregation practices of data brokers and others. Third, the Commission continues to believe that requiring affirmative express consent for material retroactive changes to how data will be used is an essential means of maintaining transparency.\\59\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\59\\ See In the Matter of Gateway Learning Corp., FTC Docket No. C- 4120 (Sept. 10, 2004) (consent order); FTC Staff Report: Self- Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (Feb. 2009), available at http://www.ftc.gov/os/2009/02/P085400behavadreport.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, the Commission is examining the role of education in promoting greater awareness about privacy among both businesses and consumers. For example, the Commission is interested in exploring whether businesses, industry associations, consumer groups, and the government can do a better job of informing consumers about privacy. The Commission is also evaluating the roles that government agencies and trade and industry associations can play in educating the business sector. The FTC looks forward to developing these concepts further and to working with Congress and this Committee as the agency moves forward. V. FCC/Common Carrier Exemption Issues In recognition of the Federal Communication Commission's (``FCC'') participation in this hearing, the Commission notes that it has a long history of cooperation and coordination with the FCC in policy matters and law enforcement, including those related to privacy. For example, the FCC and FTC cooperated extensively in implementation of the National Do Not Call Registry and continue to cooperate on enforcement of the Do Not Call rules, pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding signed by staff of the two agencies.\\60\\ Similarly, the FCC and FTC collaborated in efforts to address concerns raised by phone pretexters obtaining consumers' calling records without authorization.\\61\\ That tradition continues as the FCC works on implementing its National Broadband Plan. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\60\\ See Annual Report to Congress for FY 2003 and 2004 Pursuant to the Do Not Call Implementation Act on Implementation of the National Do Not Call Registry, available at http://www.ftc.gov/reports/donotcall/ 051004dncfy0304.pdf. \\61\\ See Prepared Statement of the Federal Trade Commission Before the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, ``Combating Pretexting: H.R. 936, Prevention of Fraudulent Access to Phone Records Act (Mar. 9, 2007), at 4, available at http:// www.ftc.gov/os/testimony/ P065409CommissionTestimonReCombatingPretextingandHR936House.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- With this history of productive cooperation in mind, the FTC renews its request for repeal of the telecommunications common carrier exemption from the FTC Act. The Commission believes that repealing the exemption would better enable the FTC and FCC to work together on privacy and other issues, and to leverage their relative expertise and resources, to achieve their common goal of protecting consumers of telecommunication services. The FTC Act exempts common carrier activities subject to the Communications Act from its prohibitions on unfair and deceptive acts or practices and unfair methods of competition.\\62\\ This exemption dates from a period when telecommunications were provided by highly- regulated monopolies. The exemption is now outdated. Congress and the FCC have dismantled much of the economic regulatory apparatus formerly applicable to this industry. The current environment requires telecommunications firms to compete in providing telecommunications services. Removing the exemption from the FTC Act would not alter the jurisdiction of the FCC, but would give the FTC the authority to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices by common carriers in the same way that it protects them against other unfair and deceptive practices. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\62\\ 15 U.S.C. 44, 45(a). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Repeal of the common carrier exemption is particularly timely as the array of communications-related services continues to expand. The FTC has a long track record of addressing competition, consumer protection, and privacy issues with respect to information, entertainment, and payment services. In addition, the FTC has procedural and remedial tools that could be used effectively to address developing problems in the telecommunications industry.\\63\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\63\\ These tools for injured consumers include the FTC's ability to obtain, in appropriate cases, preliminary and permanent injunctions, asset freezes, restitution, and disgorgement under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 44 et seq. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FTC staff continues to work with the FCC on a number of initiatives. Repeal of the common carrier exemption will lead to further and even more productive collaboration and ensure that consumer protection interests are well protected. VI. Conclusion Thank you for the opportunity to provide the Commission's views on the topic of consumer privacy. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress and this committee on this important issue. The Chairman. Thank you very much. The vote is in 5 minutes, so I'm going to ask a question. By that time, John Kerry will have voted and come back, and he'll chair until I get back. This is for Chairman Leibowitz. Millions of consumers go online everyday to buy books, to watch videos, and communicate with friends and family. Because they are sitting in the privacy of their homes, people think that they are not being watched, but they are. When a woman researches breast cancer online, she is not thinking that the Website she visits may be collecting data on her and shared--sharing that data with others. It would never occur to her, never occur to me, but it happens. And she should not have to worry about her online activity being shared with a prospective employer. This is not just games, here, this is--gets to be very serious stuff. People get hired or don't get hired. I know the Federal Trade Commission plans to release a privacy report in the fall, so my questions are the following: What is the FTC--what will you present in the way of establishing base-level privacy protections for consumers that are enforceable and which you have the authority to enforce? Which leads to the second question: Are there limitations on FTC's authority that prevent you from protecting consumers' privacy? Mr. Leibowitz. Well, let me take the second question first. You know, one of the things that we pushed very hard for--and you pushed very hard for with us, in the context of financial reform--was the ability to sanction malefactors--to fine malefactors. And we weren't able to get it this time. But, that seems to me to be a limitation. When you have a company that engages in truly inadequate data security, or a company engaged in fraud--and we go after a lot of people who are engaged in fraud--it would help to have the stronger deterrent of a civil fine. So, that would be one area where we have limitations. On the other hand, our statute that prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices is pretty broad, and it is very, very useful. And we have brought more than 100 spam and spyware cases, we've brought about 30 data-security cases, and we are going to continue to do more. Protecting American consumers' privacy is one of our highest priorities. I would say this: Going back to your opening statement, where you made an analogy to someone walking through a mall, and they're being followed by someone who's sending out information to the stores ahead, further down along the way the consumer is walking. That's a really good analogy, I think, to what is going on, on the Internet today. Because people don't really understand privacy policies and people don't understand third-party cookies, and sometimes they'll sign up for something and their Web browsing will be followed. I will say this: For vulnerable populations and for sensitive information, we have said--and we issued a report last year--that those should be ``opt-in,'' rather than ``opt- out.'' And we believe very strongly in that. Now, occasionally you can have a better opt-out policy than an opt-in policy; but, in general, in terms of informing consumers and protecting their privacy, opt-in, particularly with vulnerable populations, like teens; or sensitive information, like medical records--that's a better approach. The Chairman. Let me ask a second question, and then I have to go. When I do, Byron Dorgan, if you would mind--not mind taking over? Senator Kerry, who just went to vote, when he comes back, then he will chair. When I come back from voting, I will chair. The second is, your example, that you use in your testimony, the company Game Station, quote, ``bought the souls of its customers by adding a line to its terms and conditions,'' demonstrates how few people actually read the-- licensing agreements, and privacy practices.'' One, please elaborate on that. Mr. Leibowitz. Sure. I mean, one of the things that became absolutely clear to us during our roundtables this year is that there's a huge disconnect between what consumers think happens to their data and what really happens to their data; and also consumers' understanding of privacy policies. Most consumers believe that a privacy policy protects their privacy. Instead, a privacy policy delineates their rights, and their lack thereof. There is a story about this company--I think it was called Game Station; it's a British gaming company--on April 1 of this year, they decided to put a clause in that said, ``Unless you opt-out, we take possession of your immortal soul.'' And if you do opt-out, they game you 5 pounds sterling--about $8--as a rebate. And only 12 percent of the people opted out, because nobody else read privacy policies. And I think it was kind of a clever way to make a very disturbing point, which is that privacy policies don't generally protect consumers, and consumers don't generally read them. And that's part of the reason why we're doing this rethink of privacy. The Chairman. Are the licensing agreements and privacy policies effective disclosures? Do they have weight? Mr. Leibowitz. Well, I would say that some do and some don't. You know, in our spyware cases--and we've brought more than a dozen spyware cases--very often they were designed to obfuscate the fact that, if you clicked on a policy, companies would do all sorts of things with your data. I think some privacy policies are actually pretty good, but the question is: What should be the rules of the road, going forward? How do we move everyone up to the right standard? That's part of the reason we're going through this process, this initiative, and writing a report. And that---- The Chairman. As well as the size of the print. Mr. Leibowitz. Yes. And one thing that we've talked about is the notion of having a box with the most important privacy principles in them, and the most important terms and conditions, so consumers will understand it. And it'll be on the first click, not the third or the fourth. And that's a good way to bake in privacy principles. And we'd like to see more of that. The Chairman. Can you create that? Mr. Leibowitz. We can certainly---- The Chairman. Or enforce it? Mr. Leibowitz.--encourage it. And I think some companies are in the process of migrating toward that. I think if we work together, we use our bully pulpit; and maybe if companies don't move forward quickly enough there might be a legislative approach, as well, and we want to work with you on that, if that is where this committee is going. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Dorgan [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. Senator Johanns. Senator Johanns. Let me ask you a couple of specific questions. And I'll tell you where I'm headed on this. I hear your statement about, you know, let's put the privacy policy up, and then I can read it, and I can figure out whether I want to click on, ``Yes, I agree with this,'' or, ``I don't agree with it.'' I'm coming from a different angle. Why don't we want the power of that on my side? And here are a couple of examples: Every once in a while--and I'll bet people in the audience and listening in can relate to this--I get an e-mail from somebody advising me on the latest deal in penny stocks, ``Buy this stock today.'' First time I got it I thought, ``Well, this is easy. I'll just send an e-mail back to Joe Smith,'' whoever the person was, and tell him, ``Please take me off your list. I don't want your e-mails anymore.'' So, it comes back to me, ``Your e-mail is not deliverable.'' Why can't we require that, if I don't want to be on Joe's list to get his advice on penny stocks, I don't have to get it? Mr. Leibowitz. May I just respond to that? So, there's supposed to be an easy opt-out, under the CAN-SPAM Act, legislation that came out of this committee--Senator Dorgan was very involved in it. And if you can't simply click on an easy opt-out mechanism, then they're in violation of CAN-SPAM. So, you can send those e-mails to me, we'll have a discussion about it, and we'll follow up, because they're not supposed to do it. And I think most legitimate companies want to have an easy opt- out mechanism. They want to be in compliance with the law. Senator Johanns. Great. Senator Dorgan. Senator Johanns, might I just point out that there is--in almost all cases, when you get that kind of e-mail, there is, way down at the end, an--generally, an ``unsubscribe''---- Mr. Leibowitz. Unsubscribe. Senator Dorgan.--``icon,'' and so--but, if that does not exist, I think they are in violation of the law. Mr. Leibowitz. If they are in violation of the law--and, I actually went online to buy movie tickets a few weeks ago, and I have been pushing the ``unsubscribe'' button because I'm getting all sorts of--I wouldn't call it ``spam,'' because it's permissible, I suppose, it's just junk corporate mail from this film-buying service. And so, not all the ``unsubscribe'' buttons work properly, but we're also going to work on that---- Senator Johanns. Yes. Mr. Leibowitz.--company, as well. [Laughter.] Senator Johanns. Well, the second question is along the same lines. And again, people relate to this. I go to my doctor, the doctor says, ``You've got this condition.'' Quite honestly, I want that to be enormously private, maybe only share it with my wife. And so, I go on--what's the first thing you do when you get home? You go online to your favorite search engine, and you start looking up everything you can possibly look up. And you spend half the night trying to figure out, ``Am I dying of cancer, or whatever it is?'' Now, is there somebody out there, with that search engine company, tracing that? And next week, I start getting mailings or e-mails, or whatever, saying, you know, ``You need to contact this company. They've got a product that will help with this medical condition''? Why can't I have, in my e-mail, a disclaimer that says, ``Look, folks, I don't want this to be used for that purpose''? Mr. Leibowitz. Well, let me respond to that. If you're going on a large search engine, presumably they're anonymizing your data, and they're supposed to do that. And so, you do have some layer of protection. I think, when you're clicking on advertisements and you're doing other things--or you're browsing through the Internet--that's where I begin to worry about third-party cookies that track all of your wanderings in---- Senator Johanns. Right. Mr. Leibowitz.--cyberspace. I would say this, though. Even with respect to Google or another search engine, sometimes there's an aggregation of data that, if it became public, even though it doesn't have any, what we would call, ``original personally identifiable information,'' could still create a pretty good profile of you. And AOL, a few years ago, had a search engine; they released, for research purposes, a bunch of anonymized searches. And the New York Times did a very clever thing. They sort of reconstructed it, and they came up with some of the people who had done these searches. And so, I think the concern you raise is a very legitimate one. Again, we all understand that there are some wonderful benefits of being able to do all of the things that we need to do and want to do on the Internet, but we have to be very mindful--and we try to be, and I know the FCC does, under Chairman Genachowski--about protecting people's privacy. Senator Johanns. Well, I'm out of time. But, you can kind of see where my questions are going. My point is this: I don't think this is what people are signing up for. I think it is a wonderful tool. I think you can do rather remarkable things, more things than even I would ever understand. But, I think we have an obligation here to try to deal with people's expectation of privacy. And, if I'm out there--maybe I do want to click on an advertisement, see what the best remedy for cancer is, or whatever--I don't want to be subjected, then, to some kind of analysis of my behavioral profile. Mr. Leibowitz. We absolutely agree with you, and we have a two-pronged approach to this. One is when we see a company violating a privacy policy or making a representation to consumers that they then don't live up to, we go after them. And we have brought lots of cases, well over 100 in this area. And then, we're trying to think through what the rules of the road ought to be in--for privacy protections and for clear privacy notices. And that's what we're trying to do, sir. I think we're in general agreement. Senator Johanns. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Dorgan. Thank you. Senator LeMieux. STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE S. LeMIEUX, U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Senator LeMieux. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know Chairman Rockefeller is not here, but I want to commend him for calling this hearing. And I want to thank you both for the work that you're doing on this topic. And I want to especially commend you, Chairman Leibowitz, on the common sense, practical way you're trying to work with the community through these roundtables to have the private sector, hopefully, fashion their own remedies so that it doesn't have to be done by regulation. I think that's always the best method, if it can be achieved. I mean, I think the private sector knows that, if it can't be, that Congress will step in. So, we're there as the backstop to, maybe, give you a little negotiating leverage. But, if the private sector will do that, I think that's the best, to all concerned. And I want to speak to the issue that my colleague from Nebraska was talking about, and that is, this really all comes down to making sure the consumer knows what the disclosure issues are. And it's not a privacy statement, as you correctly pointed out, because you are not gaining rights by going through the privacy statement. It is a ``disclosure of personal information'' statement, and if it were titled that way, people would look at it a lot differently than if they see ``privacy.'' And if we had some uniformity, like I know was done with credit cards, with the box that you see, on your credit card statement, that is i"
