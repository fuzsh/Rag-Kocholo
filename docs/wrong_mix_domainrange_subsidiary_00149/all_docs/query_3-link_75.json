Each language supports a specific subset of metadata types. For details, see Intelligent Tagging for Non-English Languages.\n\nEntity MarkupTags\n\nEach Intelligent Tagging entity markup tag identifies an Entity or a Relation. Entities are straightforward things like companies, people, cities, telephone numbers; Relations are more complex mentions that indicate relationships between things. For example, deals, IPOs, analyst recommendations, company reorganizations.\n\nEntities\n\nClick a link for a description of the entity type and its attributes.\n\nIt is important to note that most attributes are optional; a tag can be extracted with some but not all of its attributes.\n\nAnniversary\n\nCity\n\nCompany*\n\nContinent\n\nCountry*\n\nCurrency*\n\nCurrencyPair*\n\nEditor\n\nEmailAddress\n\nEntertainmentAwardEvent\n\nFacility\n\nFaxNumber\n\nHoliday\n\nIndustryTerm\n\nJournalist\n\nMarketIndex*\n\nMedicalCondition\n\nMedicalTreatment\n\nMovie\n\nMusicAlbum\n\nMusicGroup\n\nNaturalFeature\n\nOperatingSystem\n\nOrganization\n\nPerson*\n\nPharmaceuticalDrug\n\nPhoneNumber\n\nPoliticalEvent\n\nPosition\n\nProduct\n\nProgrammingLanguage\n\nProvinceOrState\n\nPublishedMedium\n\nRadioProgram\n\nRadioStation\n\nRegion\n\nSportsEvent\n\nSportsGame\n\nSportsLeague\n\nTechnology\n\nTVShow\n\nTVStation\n\nURL\n\n*These are the actively enhanced and supported metadata types.\n\nRelations\n\nClick a link for a description of the relation type and its attributes.\n\nIt is important to note that most attributes are optional; a tag can be extracted with some but not all of its attributes.\n\nAcquisition\n\nAlliance\n\nAnalystEarningsEstimate\n\nAnalystRecommendation\n\nArmedAttack\n\nArmsPurchaseSale\n\nArrest\n\nBankruptcy\n\nBonusSharesIssuance\n\nBusinessRelation\n\nBuybacks\n\nCandidatePosition\n\nCompanyAccountingChange\n\nCompanyAffiliates\n\nCompanyCompetitor\n\nCompanyCustomer\n\nCompanyEarningsAnnouncement\n\nCompanyEarningsGuidance\n\nCompanyEmployeesNumber\n\nCompanyExpansion\n\nCompanyForceMajeure\n\nCompanyFounded\n\nCompanyInvestigation\n\nCompanyInvestment\n\nCompanyLaborIssues\n\nCompanyLayoffs\n\nCompanyLegalIssues\n\nCompanyListingChange\n\nCompanyLocation\n\nCompanyMeeting\n\nCompanyNameChange\n\nCompanyProduct\n\nCompanyReorganization\n\nCompanyRestatement\n\nCompanyTechnology\n\nCompanyTicker\n\nCompanyUsingProduct\n\nConferenceCall\n\nContactDetails\n\nConviction\n\nCreditRating\n\nDeal\n\nDebtFinancing\n\nDelayedFiling\n\nDiplomaticRelations\n\nDividend\n\nEmploymentChange\n\nEmploymentRelation\n\nEnvironmentalIssue\n\nEquityFinancing\n\nExtinction\n\nFamilyRelation\n\nFDAPhase\n\nIndicesChanges\n\nIndictment\n\nIPO\n\nJointVenture\n\nManMadeDisaster\n\nMerger\n\nMilitaryAction\n\nMovieRelease\n\nMusicAlbumRelease\n\nNaturalDisaster\n\nPatentFiling\n\nPatentIssuance\n\nPersonAttributes\n\nPersonCareer\n\nPersonCommunication\n\nPersonEducation\n\nPersonEmailAddress\n\nPersonLocation\n\nPersonParty\n\nPersonRelation\n\nPersonTravel\n\nPoliticalEndorsement\n\nPoliticalRelationship\n\nPollsResult\n\nProductIssues\n\nProductRecall\n\nProductRelease\n\nQuotation\n\nSecondaryIssuance\n\nStockSplit\n\nTrial\n\nVotingResult\n\nTIP: Improve the search results of your application by mapping common search strings to entity types. A list of synonyms for financial Entity Relation types is available.\n\nNote to Internal Intelligent Tagging users: Please see the Supplementary Guide for Internal Intelligent Tagging (for internal customers who do not connect through API Gateway) for a list of supported entities and relations, and for details about the differences in the tagging output.\n\nWhich Metadata Tags are Actively Enhanced and Supported?\n\nIntelligent Tagging supports an extensive set of (over 100) metadata types. We actively focus development efforts on enhancing the focused list of concepts that are the most important to our customers.\n\nPriority 1: The following metadata concepts are actively enhanced and tuned:\n\n- Entities: Company, Country, Currency, CurrencyPair, MarketIndex, Person\n\n- Classification: DocCat (topic tags), Slugline, SocialTag\n\nPriority 2: The following metadata concepts may be tuned on demand, but not too often:\n\n- Entities: City, PharmaceuticalDrug\n\n- Relations: Acquisition, Alliance, Bankruptcy, Buybacks, CompanyAffiliates, CompanyEarningsAnnouncement, CompanyLayoffs, CreditRating, Deal, Dividend, IPO, JointVenture, Merger, NaturalDisaster, PersonCareer\n\nPriority 3: The rest of the metadata concepts are experimental and are not maintained (P/R issues are not being actively improved).\n\nComplete list of Entity and Relation types.\n\nInstanceInfo Tag\n\nFor a conceptual explanation of this tag, see How Does Intelligent Tagging Work?\n\nExample 1: A mention of a Company (Company type)\n\nExample 2: A mention of a company location (CompanyLocation type)\n\nEntity Markup Tags - Entities\n\nList of Supported Entities\n\nList of Supported Relations\n\nAnniversary\n\nem/e/Anniversary\n\nExample 1\n\nExample 2\n\nCity\n\nem/e/City\n\nExample1\n\nExample2\n\nCompany\n\nThis is one of the actively enhanced and supported metadata types.\n\nem/e/Company\n\nDefinition\n\nA full or partial company name. The term \"Company\" refers to any business organization, including newspapers, media companies, law firms, etc.\n\nNote: A company name in an index name is not extracted. For example, JPMorgan is not extracted from the phrase, “JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN.” Bloomberg is not extracted from the phrase, “Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index.” Barclays is not extracted from the phrase, “Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index UCITSETF.” Etc.\n\nAttributes\n\nconfidencelevel: A confidence score on a scale of 0 to 1. The value represents the probability that the extracted entity is indeed of the assigned type.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe confidence level score for an em/e/person tag indicates the probability that the extracted person is indeed a person.\n\nThe confidence level score for an em/e/company tag indicates the probability that the extracted company is indeed a company.\n\nThe confidence level score for an em/e/pharmaceuticalDrug tag indicates the probability that the extracted pharmaceutical drug is indeed a pharmaceutical drug.\n\nThe higher the value, the higher the probability.\n\nThe consuming application can use this score to achieve higher accuracy results by ignoring instances with confidence scores below a specified level. Note that boosting Precision in this manner is at the expense of Recall.\n\nEvery em/e tag that displays this attribute also has a corresponding Confidence tag.\n\nforenduserdisplay: A recommendation of whether the tag is suitable as a search item for a specific document (true) or whether the metadata is primarily of use for aggregation and analytics on large quantities of documents (false).\n\nThe confidence score determines if the forenduserdisplay value is true or false.\n\ninlineric: The company Reuters Instrument Code (RIC), if it is mentioned in the text.\n\nname: The text string from the input document that represents the entity. When there are multiple mentions that refer to the same entity, the most complete mention is used.\n\nnationality: The nationality of the extracted Person, Company, or Organization, if it is mentioned in the text.\n\nrecognizedas: Indicates if the extraction was based on a company RIC, company ticker, or company name found in the text. Possible values are: ric, ticker, name.\n\nTicker extraction is a premium feature, enabled with the x-calais-EnableTickerExtraction header.\n\nPlease note that Intelligent Tagging identifies and extracts primary tickers in the text. For example, “Falabella,” the primary ticker of the company SACI Falabella, is identified as a company mention, whereas “FALABE-OSA,” a non-primary ticker, is not extracted.\n\nTo extend ticker extraction to non-primary tickers, ALSO define the x-calais-EnableTickerRecallOriented header. Defining both headers triggers recall-oriented ticker extraction which is optimized for company tagging of research content such as analyst emails. (But not optimized for documents like long research reports.)\n\nAll rics are identified and extracted.\n\nRelated Tags\n\nConfidence, Relevance, er/Company (Disambiguation Tag)\n\nExample1\n\nExample2\n\nContinent\n\nem/e/Continent\n\nExample\n\nCountry\n\nThis is one of the actively enhanced and supported metadata types.\n\nem/e/Country\n\nExample1\n\nExample2\n\nCurrency\n\nThis is one of the actively enhanced and supported metadata types.\n\nThis is a premium metadata type.\n\nem/e/Currency\n\nExample1\n\nExample2\n\nCurrencyPair\n\nThis is one of the actively enhanced and supported metadata types.\n\nThis is a premium metadata type.\n\nem/e/CurrencyPair\n\nExample1\n\nExample2\n\nEditor\n\nem/e/Editor\n\nExample\n\nInput Text\n\n(Editing by Keith Weir and Sara Ledwith)\n\nExtracted Entity\n\nKeith Weir\n\nSara Ledwith\n\nEmailAddress\n\nem/e/EmailAddress\n\nExample\n\nInput Text\n\nFor information contact: info@softwareshelf.co.uk.\n\nExtracted Entity\n\ninfo@softwareshelf.co.uk\n\nEntertainmentAwardEvent\n\nem/e/EntertainmentAwardEvent\n\nExample 1\n\nExample 2\n\nFacility\n\nem/e/Facility\n\nDefinition\n\nThe name of a man-made physical entity.\n\nThings like courts, embassies, consulates, radio stations, and TV stations are assigned a Facility tag only if the text string contains one or more explicit location or building indicator, such as \"the Parliament building,\" \"The crowd outside the Stanislaus County Courthouse,\" etc.\n\nPlaces like parks, borders, settlements, farms, parking lots, etc., are not assigned a Facility tag.\n\nTheme parks and amusement parks are assigned a Facility tag.\n\nUniversities and hospitals are assigned a Facility tag.\n\nAttributes\n\nforenduserdisplay: A recommendation of whether the tag is suitable as a search item for a specific document (true) or whether the metadata is primarily of use for aggregation and analytics on large quantities of documents (false).\n\nname: The text string from the input document that represents the entity.
