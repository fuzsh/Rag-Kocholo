        "text": "Carbondale in the '80s and '90s Group\n\nWhat began as a simple Facebook page to help alumni from the 1980s and 1990s reminisce about their heydays at SIU Carbondale quickly took on a life of its own and generated a new, endowed scholarship for new generations of Salukis.\n\nThe Balancing Education, Experience, and Reality (B.E.E.R. Scholarship) has become one of the most funded financial aid offerings by thousands of alumni, who show their appreciation of the great memories SIU gave them by giving students the opportunity to create their own memories. The group raised more than $150,000 in three years during the annual SIU Day of Giving.\n\nEarlier this year, the group generated nearly 700 gifts totaling more than $52,000. Meanwhile, the group’s ongoing social media discussions continue to be a powerful and influential voice in the life of the university\n\nMarc Morris '86, '92, Ph.D. '09\n\nMarc E.

It was published in 2011 and Teri was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2013 for chronicling and preserving an important piece of basketball history in Illinois.\n\nJoseph Lenzini '77, '84\n\nWhen Lenzini’s parents moved to Carbondale in the early 1950’s, they purposely purchased a home 2 blocks from campus so all of their kids would have access to higher education. Eventually 5 of their 6 kids, plus several spouses and their children obtained multiple degrees from SIU including graduates from the first Engineering class and the first Law School class.\n\nAs a professional engineer, Lenzini has worked for the Illinois Department of Transportation and E. T. Simonds Construction Company. At IDOT he was involved in the interview, selection and supervision of close to 100 students from SIU’s engineering program. Virtually all have progressed to graduation and professional employment and licensure. He has also been involved with the Civil Engineering Department's Professional Advisory Board since 1997, advising the department in matters of curriculum, policy, enrollment, program evaluation, accreditation reviews, and the capstone senior design class.\n\nIn addition, Lenzini has presented class lectures on a variety of topics, provided research materials and led field trips to construction sites.

'73, Agriculture, Education\n\nWilliam A. Doerr, a native of rural Elkville, Illinois, has a 77-year affiliation with SIU. He entered Southern as a 16-year-old freshman in 1941, but his education was interrupted by military service in the U.S. Navy, marriage and a brief period of farming. He completed a B.S. degree in 1951 and immediately transferred to the University of Illinois to pursue an M.S. degree and to become qualified to teach vocational agriculture in Illinois high schools. Doerr taught agriculture at Raymond, Illinois for 13 years before returning to SIU to serve as Superintendent of University Farms and to pursue a Ph.D. degree.\n\nSubsequently, SIU offered other opportunities for service and advancement, including a two-year assignment as Chief of Party for a United Nations Development Program in southern Brazil.

He first came to SIU in 1935, excited to study history and become a teacher. He knew baseball would have to wait, however, as the sport had been discontinued at Southern since 1924. Two years later, Dunn decided it was time to pass on his knowledge of history and athletics. He left Southern to teach and coach, until those plans were interrupted by WWII.Dunn served in Southeast Asia as a member of the field artillery and was captured in March 1942. For three years he remained a prisoner of war working on the infamous “Death Railway,” and then was sent to the prison camp at River Kwai. Refusing to give up, Dunn miraculously survived unimaginable hardships before being liberated in August of 1945. Arriving back in the United States, he quickly revisited his zeal for learning and decided to finish his education at Southern – eleven years after first enrolling.This time things would be different.Coach Glenn “Abe” Martin began to revive the baseball program in 1946, the same year Dunn returned to Carbondale. He was soon able to fulfill his dream of playing college baseball a year later, something unattainable for so long. Noting his maturity and leadership ability, the legendary Martin named Dunn his first-ever team baseball captain in 1947. Upon graduation that year, Dunn returned to teaching history and coaching baseball and basketball in Gorham, Ill. His love of learning never faded, and he walked Southern’s halls once again years later for a Master’s degree in educational administration. This helped set a path to becoming Superintendent of Schools in Gorham, along with stints as superintendent in Illinois school districts at Newman and Anna.Southern Illinois has always called out to this SIU Alumni Association member, and when it finally came time for Dunn to retire, staying in the area was an easy choice for “Abe’s first captain.” Even though he had travelled the world, this area would always be home.\n\nJohn Hubert Dunn\n\nB.S., Education and Human Services Posthumously\n\nJohn Hubert Dunn is recognized as the father of gymnastics in the Pacific Northwest, and he began his involvement with the sport at SIU, as a team captain and six-time championship winner.

Shubrick. He participated in the Invasion of Normandy. After the war, he accepted a teaching position at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, where he earned his master’s degree in education, established a varsity gymnastics team and directed about 150 clinics and exhibitions in the region, which culminated in him setting up the Pacific Northwest College Gymnastics Meet, as well as the Washington State High School Gymnastics Meet.\n\nDunn earned a doctoral degree from the University of Illinois in 1960 and in 1962 accepted a teaching and coaching position at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb Illinois. There, he taught courses in kinesiology, physiology, and bio-mechanics and produced eight winning seasons in gymnastics out of ten. He earned NIU’s Excellence in Teaching award in 1968. Dunn retired in 1986 and established an endowed scholarship for bio-mechanic students at NIU. Dunn held positions in several national offices for collegiate athletics and has received numerous awards, including inductions into six halls of fame for his work in gymnastics.
