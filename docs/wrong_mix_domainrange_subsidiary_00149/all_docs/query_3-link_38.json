        "text": "Do Not Sell / Share / Target\n\nUnder U.S. Privacy Laws there are broad and differing concepts of “Selling” PI for which an opt-out is required. California has an opt-out from “Sharing” for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising (use of PI from different businesses or services to target advertisements). Colorado has an opt-out from targeted advertising. Nevada “consumers” have the right to instruct us not to “sell” “covered information” as those terms are defined by Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes. You may contact us here to be verified and learn more about your opt-out rights under that law. We may Sell or Share your PI and/or use your PI for Targeted Advertising, as these terms apply under U.S. Privacy Laws. However, we provide Consumers an opt-out of Sale/Sharing/Targeting regardless of state of residency.\n\nThird-Party digital businesses (“Third-Party Digital Businesses”) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that Collect PI about you on our services, or otherwise Collect and Process PI that we make available about you, including digital activity information. We understand that giving access to PI on our services, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Share and thus we will treat such PI (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses, where not limited to acting as our Service Provider (or Contractor or Processor), as a Sale and/or Share and subject to a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request. We will not Sell your PI, Share your PI for Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising, or Process your PI for Targeted Advertising if you make a Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-out request.\n\nOpt-out preference signals (also known as global privacy control or GPC): Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which is referred to in California as opt-out preference signals (“OOPS”), which are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of personal information. To use an OOPS/GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the OOPS/GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website. We process OOPS/GPC with respect to Sales and Sharing that may occur in the context of Collection of cookie PI by tracking technologies online by Third-Party Digital Businesses, discussed above, and apply it to the specific browser on which you enable OOPS/GPC. We currently do not, due to technical limitations, process OOPS/GPC for opt-outs of Sales and Sharing in other contexts (e.g., non-cookie PI). We do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled OOPS/GPC; or (2) change your experience with any product or service offered by Chelsea Magazinesif you use OOPS/GPC; (3) apart from notifying you that you opted out, display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the OOPS/GPC.\n\nOpt-out for non-cookie PI: If you want to limit our Processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request here.\n\nOpt-out for cookie PI: If you want to limit our Processing of your cookie-related PI for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such PI, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool or by clicking on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on the banner of the website and app. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-out of cookie PI and to non-cookie PI. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device. A similar tool is available for our app, which you can access via the Do Not Sell/Share/Target option in the settings menu. You must exercise your preferences on each of our websites and apps you visit, from each browser you use, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be effective and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool. Please also refer to Section 11 for other ways to exercise preferences regarding Third-Party Digital Businesses. Beware that if you use ad blocking software, our cookie banner may not appear when you visit our services and you may have to use the link above to access the tool.\n\nWe do not knowingly Sell or Share the PI of Consumers under 16, unless we receive affirmative authorization (“opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years old, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer who is less than 13 years old. If you think we may have unknowingly collected PI of a Consumer under 16 years old, please Contact Us.\n\nWe may disclose your PI for the following purposes, which are not a Sale or Share: (i) if you direct us to disclose PI; (ii) to comply with a Consumer rights request you submit to us; (iii) disclosures amongst the entities that constitute Chelsea Magazines as defined above, or as part of a Corporate Transaction; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law.\n\nOur Responses\n\nSome PI that we maintain is insufficiently specific for us to be able to associate it with a verified Consumer (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that PI in response to those requests if we cannot associate it with a verified Consumer. If we deny a request, in whole or in part, we will explain the reasons in our response.\n\nWe will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we Process to respond to your Consumer request(s). In some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest. We reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.\n\nConsistent with applicable U.S. Privacy Laws and our interest in the security of your PI, we will not deliver to you more sensitive PI such as your account password or payment information in response to a Consumer privacy rights request; however, you may be able to access some of this information yourself through your account if you have an active account with us."
