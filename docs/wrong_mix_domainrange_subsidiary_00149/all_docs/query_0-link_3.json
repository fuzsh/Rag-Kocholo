Many companies were involved in the Code Lyoko franchise, with the two shows, books, games, toys, distribution, and miscellaneous merchandise. Some of these companies are significant enough to warrant their own articles. Some are more minor. This article attempt to list all of both of these groups.\n\nCompanies with their own articles[]\n\nMoonscoop (formerly known as Antefilms)\n\nFrance Télévisions (France 3/France 4)\n\nMegamax\n\nKabillion\n\nAtlantyca\n\nThe Game Factory\n\nNorimage\n\nSplash Entertainment\n\nCanal J[]\n\nCanal J is a French children's TV network. Canal J is a subsidiary of the Lagardère Group. Canal J was one of the two original broadcasters of Code Lyoko, the other being France 3. It was the second French channel to carry Code Lyoko Evolution, following France 4. Canal J also created Code Lyoko's Galaxy, Aelita's Battle, and Odd's Battle. The channel is famous worldwide as both an initial broadcaster and an importer of many childrens' shows, such as Team Galaxy, Martin Mystery, Sonic Boom, Skyland, and Sailor Moon Crystal. The channel frequently cobroadcasts with Cartoon Network. Like France Télévisions, the channel is available on TNT, France's national cable and satellite provider.\n\nhttp://www.canalj.fr/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/canalj\n\nhttps://twitter.com/canalj\n\nCartoon Network[]\n\nCartoon Network was the first international broadcaster of Code Lyoko. CN performed the initial airing of Code Lyoko for the US market within a few weeks of broadcast of the French dub in France. Cartoon Network did not license Code Lyoko Evolution.\n\nCartoon Network was started on October 1st, 1992 by Turner Broadcasting, so that the company could make money off of its animation assets. The channel's first show was the Bugs Bunny short Rhapsody Rabbit. The channel was the initial broadcaster of many popular and critically acclaimed shows in the 90s and early 2000s, such as Dexter's Laboratory, Ed Edd n Eddy, Teen Titans, and the Powerpuff Girls. In 1997, the channel launched Toonami, which was a major introduction of Anime into the US market. In 2000, the channel launched Boomerang, as a dumping ground for canceled and old shows to still make money. Later, in 2004, the channel launched Miguzi, a programming block which carried both Code Lyoko and Totally Spies, two high-performing Franime. Code Lyoko was removed from the Miguzi block for a worse timeslot, but survived the cancelation of the timeslot itself. Code Lyoko continued to be broadcasted until 2007. Initially, the channel was a rebroadcaster of the Hanna-Barbera cartoons, but diversified in 2002 with a code-share channel, \"Adult Swim\", a channel dedicated to animation for people in their 20s and teens.\n\nSeason 4 Airing Controversy[]\n\nFor most of its run, Cartoon Network aired Code Lyoko regularly on its Miguzi block, occasionally giving it timeslots outside the block and running marathons. It was the block's second most popular show when it premiered in 2004, becoming its most popular in 2005.[1][2] The series was Cartoon Network's third highest rated program overall in 2006, behind only Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and Pokémon, respectively.[2][3]. The channel even ordered the prequel episode X.A.N.A. Awakens.[4]\n\nHowever, starting with Season 4 the channel became controversial in the fanbase. With the cancellation of Miguzi around the time Season 4 premiered in May 2007, Code Lyoko moved to weekly premieres on Tuesday nights for the summer. The series then moved to Saturday mornings in September after summer ended, but Cartoon Network skipped Lab Rat during the shift, an episode crucial to the overarching plot. Premieres were often preempted by other programming during this time before Cartoon Network dropped the show from their schedule altogether in November. The last seven episodes of Season 4 were ultimately never aired on the network as a result, instead being quietly released on their website with no advertisement.\n\nThe reason for Cartoon Network removing the show shortly before it finished is unknown, though the channel was going through a regime change in 2007. Mike Lazzo, who managed Miguzi, had left Cartoon Network for Adult Swim by the time Season 4 premiered.[5] The Boston Mooninite Panic in January of that year lead to the resignation of Cartoon Network's general manager Jim Samples along with several other executives at the network, with Stuart Snyder named as his replacement in May.[6] Maxwell Atoms, creator of the channel's The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy series, noted Cartoon Network cancelled nearly all of their original programing during this time.[7] While Code Lyoko wasn't one of their originals, it's been speculated it was taken off the schedule as a result of the regime change. A common rumor says an executive from Cartoon Network posted on Twitter that they personally removed the show as they disliked it. Said tweet has never been found however and the executive's name is unknown, bringing its authenticity into question.\n\nhttp://www.cartoonnetwork.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cartoonnetwork\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/cartoonnetwork\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CartoonNetwork\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network\n\nFunimation[]\n\nFunimation is a media import and localization company that operates out of Texas. The company got its start dubbing the Dragon Ball franchise for Cartoon Network. It primarily makes money by importing Japanese media \"and occasional French shows\", and selling \"and translating\" the media for the English market. Funimation was responsible for releasing some of the early Code Lyoko DVDs, such as \"Movies, Music, and Mayhem\", and other collectible DVDs which are now hard to find. Funimation is a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation, and is one of the largest companies of its kind.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funimation\n\nhttp://www.funimation.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FUNimation\n\nhttp://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation\n\nUniversal Studios[]\n\nUniversal Studios is an American media conglomerate.

It is headquartered in Paris. After the French arm of Moonscoop fell into bankruptcy, and the Moonscoop group performed an economic fruitfly, the rights to Code Lyoko fell under the control of Darguard, who sent it to their subsidiary, Mediatoon Distribution.\n\nMediatoon, a subsidiary of Dargaud specializing in television works, have created 3 YouTube Channels where you can watch Code Lyoko for free in French, English and Spanish. They upload a new episode almost every week. Mediatoon doubles as a media import company, and has helped import Naruto and Fairy Tail to France.\n\nDargaud was founded by Georges Dargaud in April of 1936. At the time, it specialized in minor comics. In 1948, they started \"Line\", a magazine for women. In 1989, Dargaud was purchased by Média-Participations, after the founder retired. Today, Dargaud is run as Groupe Dargaud, which encompasses around 15 secondary publishers. It is most famous for the Tintin franchise, and for making the Garfield show. In 2008, they founded Mediatoon as a subsidiary; and in 2014, purchased the French arm of Moonscoop. Dargaud has been involved in several intellectual property disputes.\n\nhttp://www.dargaud.com/\n\nhttp://www.mediatoon.com/\n\nhttp://www.mediatoon-distribution.com/en/catalog/186/code-lyoko/\n\nhttp://www.mediatoon-distribution.com/en/catalog/187/code-lyoko-evolution/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dargaud\n\nhttps://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dargaud\n\nhttps://twitter.com/EditionsDargaud\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MEDIATOON_Live\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/editions.dargaud\n\nJetix / Disney / Toon Disney / Disney XD[]\n\nJetix was an international programming block and channel which was one of the main broadcasters of Code Lyoko. It was responsible for broadcasting Code Lyoko in Brazil, Argentina, Japan, Mexico \"a role shared with Cartoon Network\", and the Netherlands. It specialized in adventure and action based shows. It was a cooperative project between Fox, Disney, and some shell companies. In 2009 and 2010, the Jetix brand was retired, and folded into the Disney and Disney XD brands. Additionally, Jetix was responsible for creating Perdus dans Lyokô and Treinamento Anti-ZENA. Code Lyoko also aired on Disney Channel Italy, along with several other broadcasters. There's a complicated history here.\n\nJetix started as a set of secondary European properties owned by Fox in Europe, which were partially purchased by ABC during Disney's purchase of ABC. Throughout 2004, Jetix became a consolidated brand which aired as channel blocks, independent channels, and code shares in various countries, spreading world wide. Most of these were with Toon Disney and Disney Channel. In 2008, Disney initiated a buyout, taking over the brand officially. From there, a new channel was launched: Disney XD, which was formed as a merger of Jetix and Toon Disney, even though they were already the same channel in most cases. The new Disney XD shared most of the old programming, though new items shifted into the lineup after the first few years.\n\nDisney Channel itself is a property of the Walt Disney company, one of the oldest entertainment companies in existence. Disney's contribution to the Code Lyoko franchise was airing the show in Italy, along with owning Jetix during its broadcasts of Code Lyoko. Disney is the second largest media company in the world, second only to Comcast. The company's history traces back to the silent film era in 1923, when it worked in animation. Over the years with some losses, it developed some properties such as Mickey Mouse, which remains its flagship character. They then launched the first cel-animated feature length film:: \"Snow White And The Seven Dwarves\". Then in the 40s, the US and Canada were both in World War 2, and much of the company was drafted. Cut off from the foreign market which was the majority of their revenue, and stuck in a command economy, they broke into the propaganda film industry. After the war ended, Disney had a brief experimental phase with a few films such as \"Song Of The South\", a film which blended live action and Animation, often in the same shots; but is now disavowed by the company for being racist. From there till 1966, Disney's film empire grew, culminating in the death of the company's co-founder, Walt Disney. From there, the company diversified into theme parks, though revenue from the art itself was declining, primarily due to the creation of a competitor from their previous employees: Don Bluth Productions. After a few awkward years with at least one corporate coup, the studio released \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", which reused \"Song Of The South\"'s techniques and \"The Little Mermaid\", resulting in an era now known as \"The Disney Revival\". This was the era in which Disney Channel launched. In 1994, Disney purchased ABC broadcasting, and launched a cruise line a few years later. After another coup, Disney started acquiring other media companies, including Pixar, Lucasworks, Marvel, Maker Studios, and Blip. Blip was later shut down.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetix\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_XD\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toon_Disney\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company\n\nITV[]\n\nITV is a British TV broadcasting company. ITV's contribution to the Code Lyoko franchise was being a broadcaster. Between the core ITV brand, and its various aliases, ITV broadcasted Code Lyoko to Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.\n\nITV broadcasted Code Lyoko on the channels ITV4 and CITV. CITV, Children's ITV, was originally a codeshare secondary channel of ITV4. Later, CITV became an independent channel.\n\nAmazon/CreateSpace[]\n\nCreateSpace is a subsidiary of Amazon. CreateSpace's primary contribution to the Code Lyoko franchises was manufacturing the Basic DVDs of the first 4 seasons for the English language market. It's basically an independent publishing company where small media producers can have books, DVDs, CDs, etc; published, and the media producers can sell them.\n\nhttps://www.createspace.com/\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com\n\nFrance Cartes[]\n\nFrance Cartes is a company that publishes card games and board games for the french market. France Cartes' main contribution to the Code Lyoko franchise was their collaboration with Moonscoop to create the Code Lyoko Card Game. France Cartes is operated in Saint-Max, France. France Cartes was formed by merging \"La Ducale\" and \"Grimaud\" in 1962. The resulting conglomerate was renamed France Cartes in 1986.

Spacetoon's contribution to the Code Lyoko franchise was being the initial broadcaster of Code Lyoko to the Indonesian market.\n\nSpacetoon started in Dubai and branched into Indonesia and South Korea before the 2008 economic recession. It was also licensed in India, but Spacetoon India is basically a separate company. In the Arabic markets, Spacetoon created several secondary channels: Spacetoon English, Spacetoon Radio, and Space Power TV.\n\nAfter the recession, Spacetoon Korea failed. Spacetoon English, Spacetoon Radio, and Space Power TV were all forced to shut down in the Arabic language market, with only the original Spacetoon surviving in that market. Spacetoon Indonesia sold its OTA broadcasting channel to NET., a new generic broadcaster. NET. also gained secondary rights to broadcast Code Lyoko in the Indonesian market. This created a similar situation to France Television and Canal J in France. After this, Spacetoon Indonesia became a cable/satellite only provider in Indonesia. From here, Spacetoon Indonesia launched Spacetoon 2, Spacetoon Plus, and Spacetoon 3. Spacetoon 3 lasted less than a year. Due to financial problems, the Spacetoon company was forced to diversify from children's content to also include home shopping. Spacetoon 2 was rebranded as Space Shopping.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetoon\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetoon_Plus\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetoon\n\nhttps://www.spacetoon.id/\n\nhttp://spacetoon.com/\n\nNET.[]\n\nNET. is the other broadcaster of Code Lyoko for the Indonesian market.
