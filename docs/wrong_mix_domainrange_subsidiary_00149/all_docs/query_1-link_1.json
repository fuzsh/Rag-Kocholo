        "text": "The Proud Family is an American animated television series that aired on Disney Channel from September 15, 2001 to August 19, 2005.\n\nAbout 15 years after the original series ended, the series will be returning with new episodes on the Disney+ streaming service, which was originally scheduled in 2021. However, it was delayed to February 23, 2022, since the release date was postponed indefinitely, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The revived series is now known as The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder.\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe Proud Family was created by Bruce W. Smith and was produced by his studio, Jambalaya Studios. Originally piloted for Nickelodeon, it was eventually picked up by the Disney Channel in September 2001. Many of the later episodes of The Proud Family were produced using Macromedia Flash. It was first broadcast in the United States on Disney Channel on September 15, 2001 and was later aired on Toon Disney until February 2009 when Toon Disney was re-launched as Disney XD. It has also broadcast on The Family Channel in Canada. The series also aired Saturday mornings on the ABC Kids block from launch on September 14, 2002 until September 2, 2006. The show was the first Disney animated show which didn't premiere on network/over-the-air television, which had been done since 1985 when the Television Animation unit was started. It marked the first animated Disney Channel Original Series, and, incidentally, the only animated original series from the Disney Channel not associated with, and to be produced exclusively by, Walt Disney's TV Animation arm.\n\nThe Proud Family[]\n\nPenny Proud[]\n\nVoiced by Kyla Pratt; the protagonist and the 14-year-old African-American girl who is usually embarrassed by the way her father, Oscar, acts. She enjoys hanging out with her friends, even though they have gotten her into trouble, and left her to face danger by herself many times. She sometimes listens to and always respects her parents, but often caves in to peer pressure. She is also a feminist at times, and is very logical. She is a very talented singer as shown when she becomes a solo singer for Wizard Kelly productions, but quits after missing her old life. Penny's a Straight A student. She's on the Football team and the Newspaper Staff. Penny tried out for cheerleading, but due to having an accident with the stage being converted into a giant CD, LaCienega got the last spot on the cheerleading squad. Penny is also good at reciting poetry and becomes jealous when Dijonay becomes just as good as her. In The Proud Family Movie, Penny turns 16, and she begins to want independence, but her father has issues letting her go. She saves the world and makes up with him, and he finally realizes she's her own person who can make her own decisions.\n\nOscar Proud[]\n\nVoiced by Tommy Davidson, Oscar is the overprotective father of Penny, Bebe, and Cece, and is the son of Suga Mama. He is very hyper, immature, childish, and semi-dimwitted, though considered intelligent in persona in an almost Homer Simpson manner. Oscar owns a business and produces a venomous brand of snack food called \"Proud Snacks.\" Oscar's biggest weaknesses are money, attractive women, and his wife Trudy.\n\nTrudy Proud[]\n\nVoiced by Paula Jai Parker, Trudy is the veterinarian mother of Penny, BeBe, and CeCe. She comes from somewhat of a wealthy family, her father also being a doctor.\n\nBeBe & CeCe Proud[]\n\nVoiced by Tara Strong; Penny's trouble-making 1-year-old twin siblings. BeBe is a boy with an afro and always has a bottle in his mouth, while CeCe is a girl with brown hair and a pink dress with pigtails. BeBe and CeCe are namesakes of the gospel music brother and sister duo, BeBe & CeCe Winans. CeCe is the older twin. They love Penny very much, but at points play too roughly with her. They are often seen playing with Puff, and most of the time, Puff ends up getting injured. Their voices are similar to Dil Pickles on Rugrats, whose voice is by the same actress.\n\nSuga Mama Proud[]\n\nVoiced by Jo Marie Payton; Penny, Bebe, and Cece's hip, wrestling-loving grandma who does Tae-kwon-do. She is very sassy, and always gets straight to the point when she talks. She constantly insults, discourages and beats up Oscar, but she loves him deep down (during the Proud Family Movie she finally gives him some respect and listens to him for once). Her age is unknown (although in one episode it said she had a driver's license that expired in 1938), and often made fun of by her son. An event from twenty years ago shows her looking exactly the same as before. Suga Mama is in love with Papi. On the contrary Papi despises Suga Mama and often makes rude remarks about her in Spanish which she thinks are compliments, she shows extra amounts of love for her poodle, Puff. Her strength is shown in Lilo & Stitch: The Series when she was able to single handily beat Gantu in a wrestling match without a scratch.\n\nBobby Proud[]\n\nVoiced by Cedric The Entertainer (Arsenio Hall in The Proud Family Movie), Oscar's older brother and Suga Mama's eldest son. He is a fan of groups like Kool & The Gang among others. He sings and talks like the lead singers of the '70's bands The Ohio Players (Sugarfoot) and The Commodores (Lionel Richie). He has a 1959 Cadillac Eldorado that only plays one song and has hydraulics and also a parachute for some safety reasons (as shown in the episode \"Thelma and Luis\" when Suga Mama and Papi accidentally drive it off the Grand Canyon and the parachute saves them). Suga Mama favors him over Oscar. He often has Oscar do things that annoy him very often, but ironically lead to Oscar meeting beautiful women. For example, he gets Oscar to be an Ice Cream man at a basketball game, which leads to one of the cheerleaders asking Oscar out on a date. Bobby and his band, DisFunksunal Junction are a clear parody of band leader George Clinton also known as Dr. Funkenstein and his band Parliament-Funkadelic, also known as P-Funk.\n\nPuff the Dog[]\n\nVoiced by Tara Strong, Puff is Suga Mama's beloved pet poodle. Like his owner, Puff hates Oscar and is often tormented by the baby twins, BeBe and CeCe, who play roughly with him.\n\nCharacters' cast[]\n\nMain cast[]\n\nKyla Pratt - Penny Proud\n\nTommy Davidson - Oscar Proud\n\nPaula Jai Parker - Trudy Proud\n\nJo Marie Payton - Suger \"Suga Mama\" Proud\n\nTara Strong - BeBe Proud, CeCe Proud and Puff the Dog\n\nSemi-regular cast[]\n\nKaren Malina White - Dijonay Jones\n\nSoleil Moon Frye - Zoey Howzer\n\nAlisa Reyes as LaCienega Boulevardez\n\nOrlando Brown - Sticky Webb\n\nCedric the Entertainer - Bobby Proud\n\nPhil LaMarr - Michael Collins\n\nRaquel Lee - Nubia Gross (Nubia is the only speaker of the three Gross Sisters)\n\nKevin Michael Richardson - Doctor Payne / Omar\n\nCree Summer as Peabo\n\nKeke Palmer as Maya Leibowitz-Jenkins\n\nZachary Quinto as Barry Leibowitz-Jenkins\n\nBilly Porter as Randall Leibowitz-Jenkins\n\nCo-starring[]\n\nCarlos Mencia as Felix Boulevardez\n\nMaría Canals-Barrera as Sunset Boulevardez\n\nAlvaro Gutierrez as Papi Boulevardez\n\nAries Spears as Wizard Kelly and Little Wiz\n\nNotable guest stars[]\n\nMo'Nique as Boonnetta Proud\n\nAnthony Anderson as Ray Ray Proud, Sr.\n\nRobert Guillaume as Dr. Vincent Parker\n\nCicely Tyson as Mrs. Maureen Parker\n\nDavid Alan Grier as Reuben Parker\n\nWendy Raquel Robinson as Leslie Parker\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph as Diana Parker\n\nSolange Knowles as Chanel Parker\n\nJamal Mixon as Ray Ray Proud, Jr.\n\nPablo Santos as Johnny Lovely\n\nErica Rivera as Agatha Ordinario\n\nFrank Welker as Chester the Duck\n\nGuest stars[]\n\nAl Roker — a genie-like man who grants wishes at a horrible price.

The rest of the series was later made available to purchase on iTunes, Google Play, and to stream on Disney+.\n\nThe season 1 episode \"Don't Leave Home Without It\" was originally made unavailable on all streaming medias most likely due to music licensing issues regarding the use of Destiny's Child's song \"Independent Women\"; this issue was resolved for iTunes in March 2022.[1]\n\nIn January 2022, Disney announced that The Proud Family: The Complete Original Series would be coming to DVD on March 15, 2022 in belated honor of the show's 20th anniversary (which was actually the year prior).
