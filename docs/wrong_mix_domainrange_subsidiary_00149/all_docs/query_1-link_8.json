        "text": "Macromedia, Inc. is offering a series of online tutorials designed to allow new and existing Macromedia Director 8.5 users to learn how to use the product more quickly and master the creation and deployment of interactive 3D content for the Web. The tutorials include lessons on 3D for current Director users as well as tutorials for 3D artists and Macromedia Flash developers who are new to Director. The video tutorials take users step by step through building a rich media Web experience that incorporates sound, video and 3D assets. There are also more specific tutorials for people coming from other 3D modeling and animation applications, such as Discreet's 3ds max. There are four tutorials available: Director Basics, Behavior Basics, 3D Basics, and Publishing Basics. Users can also download the tutorial source files to enable them to do exactly what is being shown in the tutorials.
