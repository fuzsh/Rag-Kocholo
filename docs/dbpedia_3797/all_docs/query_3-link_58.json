IT&#39;S THE MUSIC Part 1\n\nThe stunning collabo between the Mighty Mocambos and hiphop-legend Afrika Bambaataa goes into the 2nd round. For the joy of all b-girls and b-boys, the Godfather of Hip-Hop and today&#39;s best heavy funk band present their banging new anthem. &#39;It&#39;s The Music&#39; brings the sound of early hiphop livebands into present time, with the Mocambos showcasing their skills on a discofied breakdance beat, only topped by the vocal authorities of the Amen-Ra Of Universal Hip-Hop Culture and fellow Zulu Nation members Charlie Funk (aka Afrika Islam), Hektek and Deejay Snoop, the latter providing a trademark talkbox feature. The flip side contains an exclusive instrumental ready to smash dancefloors on its own.",
