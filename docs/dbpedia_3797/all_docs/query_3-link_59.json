He and GRAND GALLERY, which has a store in Tomigaya, Shibuya-ku, which started as a music label, and DJ MURO's RECOGNIZE have teamed up to create this item.\n\nBAMBAATAA's design for this item was based on his own event flyer designs from the 70s and early 80s. The design is a series of works by a magnificent group of artists. The artists are a superb group of people who will never be seen again as a work of art.\n\nYasushi Ide, owner of GRAND GALLERY, created a song with AFRIKA BAMBAATAA and released the new 7-inch single and CD single \"I'm thinking I'm spacing\" on March 26.\n\nEven if you have not been exposed to HIP HOP for a long time, you may have heard of them.\n\nThe official collaboration with a legend who is also called the father of HIP HOP is a miracle that does not happen so often.\n\nWe will introduce the items another day.\n\nC30\n\nBOW WOW, RECOGNIZE flagship store\n\nselect : vtg wear, old cassette tape\n\n3 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-0001\n\nMorita Bldg. 1F, 3-27-9 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo\n\ntel 03-6384-5811\n\nmail ditc.co.ltd@gmail .com\n\ninstagram\" @c30_tokyo"
