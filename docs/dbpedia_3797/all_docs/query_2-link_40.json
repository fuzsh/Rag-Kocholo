        "text": "Criminal. Before I get to the fact that the Damn Renegades blew my damn mind away, I need to ask the working world a question. What is the society I’m living in that these guys haven’t climbed the stage for a crowd of 50,000 and blown everyone’s denim jackets away with sheer energy? You haven’t given these guys a chance. So here’s an opportunity to clear up you Conscience. The segue was worth the ride.\n\nSometimes I’ll listen to QOTSA’s Song for the Dead just to remind myself that Dave Grohl played drums on that song. The midsection has a part where you’re tricked into thinking the song is over. Conscience holds that same element of surprise, flooding the eardrums like the levee has broken. It is a punk song with a hard rock soul, and energy combined from the cocaine cultured curators of both. The sound annihilates any semblance of boredom or tiredness that you had from that sick playlist. Dump it, start afresh and these guys should be on the top of the list.\n\nNow we can talk about the solos and harmonics. Are you kidding me? For a song that sadly finishes quicker than a twitter feud, the amount of work by these musicians is insane. They harmonize guitar solos, shred through several times in the song and create an incredibly catchy chorus. This song is like reading a signboard-” Buy {product you won’t use after the first day} and get CASH free”. You think, its too good to be true. It is. And this song is that signboard, but based on reality. Oh yeah in case you want more, listen to Caravan and realize true potential.\n\nHope I sold you this song better than the Damn Renegades can sell it themselves:\n\nFind Sinusoidal’s playlists here!\n\nPromotional Disclaimer: The content in this post has been sponsored by the artist, label, or PR representative to help promote their work.Promotional Disclaimer: The content in this post has been sponsored by the artist, label, or PR representative to help promote their work."
