        "text": "Legendary DJ and producer Afrika Bambaataa has been kicked out of the very organization that he founded over 40 years ago, hip-hop awareness group Zulu Nation.\n\nLast month, 50-year-old Ronald Savage, a former music industry exec and New York politician, alleged that he had been molested by Bambaataa between the ages of 12 and 14 during the late 1970s. Afterward, three more men stepped forward accusing the “Planet Rock” performer of the same. His former bodyguard alluded to witnessing incriminating acts, as well.\n\nDespite both Bambaataa and his lawyer’s denials of the allegations, today the Universal Zulu Nation announced that it is “currently under new leadership” and that the process “will involve a significant restructure and…re-assessment.”\n\nTheir statement definitively added that “ALL accused parties and those accused of covering up the current allegations of child molestation have been removed and have stepped down from their current positions.”\n\nThough they do not mention Bambaataa by name, they admit that they will not “condemn one of our founders based on testimony through social media alone,” but that they also refuse to ignore “the comments of parties asserting they have been harmed.”"
