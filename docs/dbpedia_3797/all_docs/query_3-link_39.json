        "text": "Bridget Veltri\n\narts@mustangdaily.net\n\nAfrika Bambaataa influenced the creation of hip-hop culture with his classic track “Planet Rock” in 1982. Now the pioneer will come to San Luis Obispo to help cultivate Cal Poly’s cultural awareness.\n\nThe Cal Poly chapters of Hip-Hop Congress and Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity are bringing the legendary performer to play a show at Downtown Brewing Co. on Sunday night.\n\nBambaataa, also known as the Amen Ra of universal hip-hop and the father of electro funk, is often referred to as the “grandfather,” or “godfather” of hip-hop.\n\nGraphic communications major and Hip Hop Congress member Rachel Cherny credited Bambaataa as being one of the founders of hip-hop and having a significant influence on the development of the genre and today’s artists. He is recognized for co-opting the street gang the Black Spades into the Universal Zulu Nation.\n\n“One of the cool things about him is that a lot of modern hip-hop songs have sampled Bambaataa’s work,” Cherney said.\n\nBusiness junior and Alpha Epsilon Pi president Jordan Leib also acknowledged Bambaataa’s influence on the music industry.\n\n“He is a huge name and I am really excited for this opportunity,” Leib said. “I have known about him for a long time and he has influenced so many artists and I hear him in so many other songs.”\n\nBambaataa is originally from the South Bronx in New York and was actively involved with gangs there before traveling to Africa and getting involved with the music industry.\n\n“His story is that he used to be in gangs in New York and after his trip to Africa, his mindset changed and he came back and began to promote peace and love through music,” Leib said.\n\nHip-hop has evolved in various directions since Bambaataa laid the foundation for it.\n\n“I think that hip-hop has gone in a lot of different directions and that Bambaataa embodies the true spirit of what hip-hop is supposed to be,” Cherny said.\n\nHip-Hop Congress is a national social action network composed of chapters that operate through schools, communities and artists.\n\n“We work for positive social change through hip-hop music,” Cherny explained.\n\nThis is Bambaataa’s first time performing in San Luis Obispo, and Cherny is hoping that he will bring a little bit of the original essence of hip-hop to town with him.\n\n“At Cal Poly we struggle a lot because of the way the school and community are,” she said. “We are trying to change the stereotype we feel that a lot of people have about hip-hop, trying to show the positive side, the way it used to be.”\n\nTickets for the show are available for $20 presale at Boo Boo Records and $22 at the door. Proceeds from the show will be split between Cal Poly’s Hip Hop Congress chapter and Alpha Epsilon Pi.\n\n“Any profit we make from the show will go towards sending our members to our national conference in Seattle at the end of July,” Cherny said.\n\nIn addition to Bambaataa, Cal Poly student Ryan Benedicto or DJ Blindside and Los Angeles band Me and Heath will be performing.\n\nBamabaataa was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007."
