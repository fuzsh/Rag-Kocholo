The first type are those that are those that are timeless, regardless of when they were released and can be enjoyed by multiple generations of music listeners. The other type are those that are historically significant but may not stand the test of time. I feel like this album is in the second category. It might be important to the development of hip-hop and I'm sure that if I grew up with it, the album would hold a special place for me. Listening to it the first time decades after it was released, it only sounds dated. There are some decent ideas on here and it's a pretty upbeat album from start to finish but there's other 80s rap that is far stronger.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nWow. That's legitimately bad.

Great party energy, though it did fall into the background. Thought that's probably because of repetition - it alll already sounds so familiar. I'll give it an extra star since, when I was a kid, I thought Afrika Bambaataa and Mr. T were the same person and that seems wrong.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\n-Renegades of Funk is a banger, but RATM did a better version -Turns out this guy has been accused of sexually assaulting a bunch of boys, so 0/5, I guess.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nIn historical context this album is very important for electro and hip-hop, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's still interesting to actually listen to today. One of the problems of being the genre-definer is that once everything you do has been imitated, you end up looking pretty generic. A higher rating for significance, but for my personal enjoyment I can't go above a 2.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nHonestly if I were rating purely off enjoyment I might not give it 5 stars, but it's impossible to separate this music from how hugely important and influential it was to the early years of hip hop.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nI don't want to live on this planet any more.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nCool to see the proto-Chicago house AND proto-hip hop here all mixed together.

As I checked the site and was about to play it I was readying myself for an old school rap record. To my surprise I was met by something much more rewarding. First of, all the songs here kind of sound like Rockit by Herbie Hancock, which is not a bad thing at all. They also have a lively feeling to them, as if they were actually played and not sampled. Further research revealed that indeed, many parts were re-recorded rather than sampled from the original recordings Then I am reading that this is the first electro album ever made, a genre I am not really familiar with and that I will explore in the next few days. And that's exactly what is interesting in this process: either you get a chance to discover something that you had never heard about, or you get a chance to listen again to some classics you hadn't heard in a while. And then there is the possibility of experiencing an album you already knew as if it were your first time ever, rediscovering aspects that weren't there before. Because we too are like musical instruments: the more you listen, with curiosity and open mind, the more you are fine tuned into a better understanding.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nIntergalactic paedo-ing.

I had a HUGE gut reaction assumption that this record was going to be a major pile of crap. But it's actually FUCKING AMAZING!! I love it. Socially conscious, inspired, unabashedly oddball and cool at the same time; all the elements I like blended up into one funky non-stop party groove. And Renegades of Funk... omg that has been one of my favourite RATM songs for decades!! I love hearing the original track, it's so good too!

One of the best to ever do it, and also one of the first. Anyone who claims to love hip-hop, but doesn't know of the founders, is missing out massively.

There's less musical material in the songs here, so it's a listen best left in context: Hip-hop has other realms to explore nowadays. The rest of the scratching and posse-cutting is about what one would expect, adding up to an essential listen with a little filler.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nDelicious Afro-synth music from the 80s.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nI enjoyed this one. The hip hop and electronica fusion works. Of interest is that I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it in 1986. I'll say my music taste has progressed although some might say the opposite.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nGenre: Electro 3/5 An interesting exploration in electro instrumentals with the addition of hip hop vocals, with the song Planet Rock being one of the first singles to truly synthesize the two sounds, this compilation based around that single is a time capsule, showcasing some of the earliest rap singles around. The unfortunate context behind this album, that Afrika Bambaataa (Lance Taylor) is an all-but-jailed, quite prolific sexual offender, does sour some of what's going on. It's always difficult to look beyond sex crimes in art, especially when it deals with minors, so unfortunately this project is stained. However, the music that lies within is some of the most influential and important hip hop music ever produced, and is an essential listen in that regard. Planet Rock, the aforementioned, very important song, is now viewed and listened to as an \"old-school hip hop\" track, but that does it a disservice. It's essentially one of the earliest songs that set the instrumental template for what would be a whole decade's worth of rap music. The rest of the songs play out pretty much as you'd expect, break beats with the occasional verse and hook, with nothing from the back half sounding particularly exciting. What was exciting, though, was listening to the OG Renegades of Funk, and becoming more and more impressed with Rage Against the Machine's near perfect cover of it. Other than those two big tracks, this album is rather forgettable, unfortunately tainted with nonce behavior, but it's not offensive sonically. This will probably do wonders for those who truly love instrumental hip hop and are interested in its earliest fossils.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nWhen it comes to this album one thing is certain: the influence this had is imense. Like Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa was a cornerstone in early to mid-60's Hip-Hop. Instead of sampling old Soul and Funk records he used Electronic records from artists like Kraftwerk to create a mix of Electronic music, Hip-Hop and Funk that pushed the sound of especially Hip-Hop like no other album in that time. Does that mean that it is a good album and important to understand todays music? Yes! Is it holding up to what it maybe once was? No, absolutely not! The album opens with the title track: 'Planet Rock'. Already you are hit with a very recognisible sound that in the lead synth that has been used and sample from this many times. The \"instrumental chorus\" is taken from 'Trans Europa Express' by Kraftwerk. It is a very funky intro to the album and it already shows that the focus isn't lyrical rapping but more the Electro beats that are topped off with a rhytmic vocal structure. And the cover also looks exactly like the album sounds even from this first track. I just feel like, and this is my main criticism with the album, the song is too long. After a while the instrumental just cannot carry the whole thing, I would've needed some actually working verses with substance. Follow up song 'Looking for the Perfect Beat' has a similar problem. It should've been cut down to the half. You do not have that much important stuff to say to stretch the song to 7 minutes, if 3 or 4 would've been enough. I do like the goofy ad-libs in the middle that go: \"doodle-doo-doo\" or something and the chorus, as well as the overall Funk of this song. And while they might not have found the perfect beat, they at least found the best one on the album. Side A closes with 'Renegades of Funk' that most know because of the Rage Against the Machine cover. It has a nice variety of influences and sound all throughout the song. I think this is the most forward-thinking and influential song on the album although it lacks on certain parts that don't make it entertaining and consistent the whole way through. 'Frantic Situation' opens the second side is the shortest song on the album. The problem is that if the good songs are made over 6 minutes long, the 3 minute songs will likely not have the impact or strength the longer ones have. The song just flies over you without anything really sticking with you. It is pretty much very boring and basic in both beat and rapping. In comparison 'Who You Funkin' With' is a much stronger song. But it sadly cannot live up to anything on Side A. 'Go Go Pop' is probably my favourite on this second half. It is groovy and the beat is really nice although it doesn't achieve the highs from the start. The closing track 'They Made a Mistake' sadly cannot do much either. It gets annoying very fast and even the parts that are interesting do not hold that for long. favourites: Planet Rock, Looking for the Perfect Beat least favourites: Frantic Situation, They Made a Mistake, Who You Funkin' With Rating: light 6 https://rateyourmusic.com/~Emil_ph for more ratings, reviews and takes\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\n2.5/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nWeird record, def not rock\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nDudes talking over lame instrumentals.

One of the cassettes was a recording of a radio show from 1984. It was an interesting blast from the past, especially some of the news reports throughout the radio show. One of the things I thought interesting was a claim from some scientist about how breakdancing could contribute to hair loss. Yeah honestly, if this was the sort of thing that people were breakdancing to back in the mid 80s, I can see it. I thought this was a really fun album, and judging by when it came out I can imagine this had an influence on both hip hop and house music going into the late 80s and 90s, while interpolating and drawing influence from Kraftwerk. It's undeniably aged, but I don't care. This was just a really fun and groovy album.

This album is super important to the evolution of modern hip hop and rap. These songs have been sampled any times, and have influenced so many artists. Interesting side note: Planet Rock (the song) features samples of Kraftwerk's song Trans-Europe Express. These aren't traditional samples, however, as DJ and producer Arthur Baker met with Afrika Bambaataa and decided that instead of just playing a recording of the Kraftwerk tune, they would recreate it. This was done without Kraftwerk's permission, so the band approached the record label, and got royalties awarded to them for sales of the single. Afrika's version of the song (Planet Rock) was sampled and featured in an episode of Trailer Park Boys (I've Met Cats and Dogs Smarter Than Trevor and Cory). In the episode, the boys open an illegal night club in the park. Cory and Trevor are put in, charge of promoting the club around town, and hand out flyers at a gay bar called The Empty Closet. This leads to J-Roc's Crib being full of dudes on opening night. This song is being mixed in the background on opening night. Sampling another artist without asking for permission sounds like another episode of Trailer Park Boys called Who's the Microphone Assassin where J-Roc bootlegs songs of rap artist Detroit Velvet Smooth and calls it \"cross promotion\". It's also interesting that Rage Against The Machine's song Renegades of Funk is a cover of an Afrika Bambaataa song. I had no idea. This is a super solid album. Too bad Afrika Bambaataa is accused of sexually assaulting a bunch of kids.

Then I heard this… hey, this is Kraftwerk’s ‘Trans Europe Express’ with people talking over it? Talking in a ridiculous rhythmic and rhyming fashion, with more drums and bass added?! What the fuck, how DARE they!? Hang on…..it’s…..quite good….it’s actually brilliant!! ‘Planet Rock’ led me down a new path. Hip-hop, or ‘Electro’, as we knew it back then, opened up a new world of music for me; funk, go-go, techno, and house. Music in technicolour!

In terms of legacy, this album is titanic in hip-hop history, collecting a set of singles that were massively influential in developing the sound profile of early hip-hop and the electro subgenre. Afrika Bambaataa was huge in early hip-hop. Unfortunately, he was also a huge child molester, which is a sentiment that I wish I didn't have to express about so many artists on this list (seriously, what the fuck was wrong with rock stars in the 70s?). The music on the album is actually really cool given the technology that they were working with. For as much as 808s are discussed lovingly today, they often sound a bit thin on the track, but they fit in really well here, especially on Looking For the Perfect Beat. The synthesizers are similarly really cool, and the mix is really powerful. The rapping is...well it's early rap. Luckily, groups like Run DMC were about to come along and teach folks how to rap with style. Luckily, they tend to employ a lot of repetition and call and response, so the rapping generally doesn't weigh down the songs too much 4/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nThe funky beginning to many great records\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nThis is remains fantastic\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nMe ha gustado más de lo que esperaba.
