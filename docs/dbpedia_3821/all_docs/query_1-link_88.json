However, no patches are planned for the older versions, ESXi 7.0 and VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x. Users of the unsupported versions are recommended to upgrade to newer versions to receive security updates and support.\n\nMicrosoft reported that multiple financially motivated groups like Storm-0506, Storm-1175, and Octo Tempest have already exploited this vulnerability to deploy ransomware.\n\n“Microsoft security researchers identified a new post-compromise technique utilized by ransomware operators like Storm-0506, Storm-1175, Octo Tempest, and Manatee Tempest in numerous attacks.” continues Microsoft. “In several cases, the use of this technique has led to Akira and Black Basta ransomware deployments. “\n\nEarlier this year, the Storm-0506 group breached an engineering firm in North America and deployed the Black Basta ransomware by exploiting the flaw CVE-2024-37085 to gain elevated privileges to the ESXi hypervisors.\n\n“The threat actor gained initial access to the organization via Qakbot infection, followed by the exploitation of a Windows CLFS vulnerability (CVE-2023-28252) to elevate their privileges on affected devices. The threat actor then used Cobalt Strike and Pypykatz (a Python version of Mimikatz) to steal the credentials of two domain administrators and to move laterally to four domain controllers.” continues Microsoft.\n\nThe attackers created the ‘ESX Admins’ group in the domain and added a new user account to it. The threat actors encrypted the ESXi file system and caused the lost of functionality of the hosted virtual machines on the ESXi hypervisor.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini"
