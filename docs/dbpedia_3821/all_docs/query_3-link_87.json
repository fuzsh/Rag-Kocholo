        "text": "Welcome to the official website of ASKUI\n\nUniversities have always had international dimensions in their research, teaching, and service to society; however, historically, these dimensions have been, in general, more ad hoc, fragmented, and implicit than explicit and comprehensive. In the last decade of the previous century, the increasing globalization and regionalization of economies and societies, in conjunction with the requirements of the knowledge economy, and the end of the Cold War, created a context for a more strategic approach to internationalization in higher education. International organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, and the World Bank, as well as national governments, the European Union, and organizations for higher education such as the International Association of Universities, positioned internationalization as the most important aspect of the reform agenda. Higher education across the developed world, as well as in emerging and developing societies, has come to recognize the importance of internationalization as a key change agent. The main manifestations of the agenda of internationalization in higher education over the past 30 years have been a shift in paradigm from cooperation to competition, the mobility of students, scholars, and a reputation and branding (manifested by global and regional rankings).\n\nThe Indonesian Association of International Offices of Muhammadiyah and ‘Aisyiyah Higher Education, also known as ASKUI PTMA, is an organization that was established in accordance with the directives of the Central Board of Muhammadiyah’s Council for Higher Education, Research and Development (MAJELIS DIKTI LITBANG PP Muhammadiyah).\n\nThe establishment of the Association has as its overarching goal the strengthening of a joint network in terms of cooperation and internationalization for the more than 178 Muhammadiyah and ‘Aisyiyah Higher Education institutions located across the entirety of Indonesia."
