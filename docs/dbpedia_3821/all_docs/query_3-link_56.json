        "text": "4.6/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nGGuest UserI had an extremely pleasant experience when I stayed at the Yogyakarta Marriotr Hotel, I have tried staying at the best 5 star hotels in Yogyakarta, in my opinion this hotel is the best. Breakfast is delicious, I really like the French Toast and the Gudeg, the quality of food at this hotel is above average and satisfying The rooms are clean and modern, the staff is also friendly, the facilities are complete according to what guests need when staying at a 5 star hotel If I come back to Yogyakarta, I will choose to stay at this hotel again!\n\nShow More\n\n4.3/5\n\nExcellent\n\nJJohanAdrianThe receptionist are never smile, when i check in on March 7/20 @12.30 PM and i request for wake up call @5.00 AM to Lilis (GSA) for early morning flight but nobody set it up. So i wake up @5.32 AM and get hurry for it, i call the night shift incharge he said the wake up call is set up @10.20 AM, so funny. Its better i stay in small hostel with USD 5, with friendly staff and clean room. Because i will flight early morning so i have to stay near airport thats why i choose this terrible hotel without wake up call. I know you guys build this hotel near airport for the part of the guest who lookin for their flight so please be aware. Room is clean but many ants on the table when i put my bakpia they swarm it arround. Thanks for ”Good” service Johan\n\nShow More"
