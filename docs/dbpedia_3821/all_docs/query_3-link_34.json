        "text": "4.6/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nGGuest UserThis trip to Yogyakarta was short but very pleasant, thanks to Grand Mercure Yogyakarta. I usually stay in other Accor's hotel in Yogyakarta, but this time, I opt to try to stay in Grand Mercure. The check in process was smooth and super fast. The FOM even also attended me at that time, ensuring that my checking in process was pleasant. They had dedicated desk for Accor member avoiding long queue in the regular check-in counter. Too bad, they couldn't upgrade me to executive room or beyond, due to their high occupancy. The room was in the Premium Deluxe. It was nice, clean, and comfy, although it was not too sound-proof. So you could be disturbed with children running around and shouting in the hallway. Bathroom amenities was quite good for a deluxe room, hoping that they would provide a better one in the higher-level room. They had gym facility, but the operational hours were so limited. They even closed at 11 am to 3 pm. Too bad... They should prolong the operational hour for the gym tho, accommodated with access card, perhaps. The afternoon tea service was provided from 5 - 7 pm, with selection of fritters and small cut of cakes from their selection. Small is literally small, but since I came alone, the food provided was more than enough. For welcome drink selections, alcoholic beverages was provided for platinum member. Love this one!!! The staffs in their bar and lounge were so helpful and cater to all I needed. Thumbs up for them... To my surprise, they provided me a dedicated table for breakfast with my name written on the table. This never could be found in other Accor Hotel. Love also the services provided during my breakfast time. the chef was also good serving my 'delicate' eggs. Check-out process was also super fast. Even another manager was attended at that time greeted me and asked me about their services and facilities during my stay. Overall, this very short trip was very delightful, again, thanks to Grand Mercure Yogyakarta. Definitely gonna stay there again... To all staffs, thanks for your great hospitality and keep up the good teamwork.\n\nShow More\n\n4.6/5\n\nOutstanding\n\nGGuest UserI had an extremely pleasant experience when I stayed at the Yogyakarta Marriotr Hotel, I have tried staying at the best 5 star hotels in Yogyakarta, in my opinion this hotel is the best. Breakfast is delicious, I really like the French Toast and the Gudeg, the quality of food at this hotel is above average and satisfying The rooms are clean and modern, the staff is also friendly, the facilities are complete according to what guests need when staying at a 5 star hotel If I come back to Yogyakarta, I will choose to stay at this hotel again!\n\nShow More"
