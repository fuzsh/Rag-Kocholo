        "text": "Yesterday, President Trump warned that any countries trading with Iran will “not be doing business with the United States” after trade sanctions against the Middle Eastern nation came into effect at midnight.\n\nHowever, one former congressman thinks Trump could be forced to reconsider if Europe “sticks to its guns”.\n\nSpeaking to Russia Today, former Republican Texas representative Ron Paul said the US is “throwing its weight around” with tariffs.\n\nYet he noted Europe needs to “get some backbone” if they are to resist Donald Trump’s trade threats.\n\nMr Paul suggested: “If they stick to their guns, I think the United States would have to adjust policies a bit.”\n\nHe implied the rule banning business from accessing the US market who are engaging with Iran, could be difficult for the President to implement.\n\nMr Paul added: “How are they going to enforce that?\n\n“If China, Russia and other countries are doing business with Iran. How are we going to punish them?”\n\nThe retired politician predicted stubbornness from Europe could force Trump to reconsider.\n\nHe continued: “In time people are going to realise we might have to adjust because countries are not going to tolerate what we have done.”\n\nThe author also seemed to criticise the President’s approach to foreign policy in general, saying the US tendency to blame other countries for problems and then retaliate with sanctions is “very, very bad foreign policy”.\n\nMr Paul suggested open communication would be a better approach to relations with foreign nations.\n\nRouhani claims Trump is using 'psychological warfare' on Iran\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
