Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows:\n\na) he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him. If he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the. State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (center of vital interests); b) if the State in which he has his center of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which he has an habitual abode; c) if he has an habitual abode in both Contracting States or in neither of them, he shalI be deemed to be a resident of the State of which he is a national; d) if the status of resident can not be determined according to sub­paragraphs a) to c), the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.\n\n3. Where, by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1, a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which its place of effective management is situated.\n\nArticle 5\n\nPERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT\n\n1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \"permanent establishment\" means a fixed place of business through which an enterprise of a Contracting State wholly or partly carries on the business in the other Contracting State. 2.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 where a person ­other than an agent of independent status to whom paragraph 6 applies- is acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise and has and habitually exercises in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise unless the activities of such a person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 6. An enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, where such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.\n\nHowever, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise, he will not be considered an agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph. 7. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shalI not by itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.\n\nArticle 6\n\nINCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY\n\n1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2.

The term shalI in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, oil or gas wells, quarries and other places of extracting of natural resources including timber or other forest products. Ships or aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. Where the ownership of shares or other corporate rights in a company entitles the owner of such shares or corporate rights to the enjoyment of immovable property held by the company, the income from direct use, letting, or use in any other form of such a right to enjoyment may be taxed in the Contracting State in which the immovable property is situated. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to the income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services.\n\nArticle 7\n\nBUSINESS PROFITS\n\n1. The profits from business activity derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only sa much of them as is attributable to:\n\na) that permanent establishment; b) sales in that other State of goods or merchandise of the same as those sold through that permanent establishment ; or c) other business activities carried on in that other State of the same as those effected through that permanent establishment .\n\n2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, of this Article where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities, under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses including executive and general administrative expenses, which would be deductible if the permanent establishment were an independent enterprise insofar as they are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, whether incurred in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary. The method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles embodied in this Article. 5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 6. The profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.\n\nArticle 8\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC\n\nProfits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.\n\nArticle 9\n\nASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES\n\n1. Where\n\na) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,\n\nand in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not sa accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly,\n\n2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State -and taxes accordingly- profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are by the first-mentioned State claimed to be profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall, if necessary, consult each other.\n\nArticle 10\n\nDIVIDENDS\n\n1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed 7 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. 3. The term \"dividends\" as used in this Article means income from shares, \"Jouissance\" shares or \"Jouissance\" rights, founders' shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply, 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 6. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State has a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State, the profits of the permanent establishment may be subjected to an additional tax in that other State in accordance with its law, but the additional tax so charged shall not exceed 7 percent of the amount of such profits after deducting therefrom income tax and other taxes on income imposed thereon in that other State.\n\nArticle 11\n\nINTEREST\n\n1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the laws of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. The term \"interest\" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and derived by the Government, Ministries, other Governmental institutions, municipalities, Central Bank and other banks wholly owned by the Government of the other Contracting State, shall be exempted from tax in the first-mentioned State. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.
