Nor it is sustained by them. The roots of poverty can be found in our institutions, concepts, and theoretical frameworks. ~Prof Muhammad Yunus\n\nCredit should be taken as a human right. Only then can other human rights be really established – right to food, right to shelter, right to education, and right to health. ~Prof Muhammad Yunus\n\nMicrocredit is about much more than access to money. It is about women gaining control over the means to make a living. It is about women lifting themselves out of poverty and vulnerability. It is about women achieving economic and political empowerment within their homes, their villages, and their countries. ~ Noeleen Heyzer"
