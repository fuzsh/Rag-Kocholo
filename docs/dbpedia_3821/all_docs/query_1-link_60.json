        "text": "Swarming water-related problems are threatening many arid and semi-arid regions of the earth, and Iran is no exception. Integrating such problems with health, environmental, political, socioeconomic, and sustainability issues has greatly increased demand for managing the problems. This research investigates the Iranians abilities in managing, developing and maintaining their water resources throughout different traditional, transitional and modern time periods. The study shows until the mid-transitional period, owning to the low population and large per capita water availability, Iranians did not feel a great need to make upgrades and alterations in managing water. In the late transitional period, after sending students to the West and founding advanced universities, gradually modern hydrological technologies started appearing in the major cities. In the modern era, population explosion, industry's development, consumerism culture and unprecedented urbanization coupled with drought and global warming, have brought many difficulties for water sectors. Hence, the desire for supply-based policies has prevailed and some strategies, such as deep-pumped well drilling, dam building, and inter-basin water transferring have been undertaken to fix the problems. However, the water resource sustainability not only has not improved, but has worsened through imprudent policies such as food self-sufficiency and subsidizing water. Groundwater over-abstraction, soil-water degradation, shrinking and drying up of water bodies, intensifying flood hazards, dust storming, agricultural and ecological losses, and depopulation of rural areas are among direct and indirect evidence that confirm this claim. In conclusion, if these problems persist, the country will be at risk from water insecurity and water access conflicts.\n\nIran is currently experiencing serious water problems. Frequent droughts coupled with over-abstraction of surface and groundwater through a large network of hydraulic infrastructure and deep wells have escalated the nation’s water situation to a critical level. This is evidenced by drying lakes, rivers and wetlands, declining groundwater levels, land subsidence, water quality degradation, soil erosion, desertification and more frequent dust storms. This paper overviews the major drivers of Iran’s water problems. It is argued that while climatic changes and economic sanctions are commonly blamed as the main drivers of water problems, Iran is mainly suffering from a socio-economic drought—i.e. “water bankruptcy,” where water demand exceeds the natural water supply. In theory, this problem can be resolved by re-establishing the balance between water supply and demand through developing additional sources of water supply and implementing aggressive water demand reduction plans. Nevertheless, the current structure of the water governance system in Iran and the absence of a comprehensive understanding of the root causes of the problem leave minimal hope of developing sustainable solutions to Iran’s unprecedented water problems.\n\nThe past 15 years of exceptionally severe water scarcity in the Islamic Republic of Iran have resulted in the desertification and salinity of formerly arable lands, drying out of Iranian lakes and rivers, and quickly shrinking groundwater resources, while water demand has risen, along with the size of the Iranian population, of which over 70% lives in urban areas now. We have aimed to discover the causes of water scarcity in the IR Iran and evaluated its social and economic impacts. First, we computed the Weighted Anomaly Standardized Precipitation (WASP) Index for the period of 1979-2014. To illustrate the social impact of water scarcity, we analyzed the current water risk for the twenty most populous Iranian cities, by employing the composite index approach to translate hydrological data into comprehensible indicators of water related risks, and made a projection for 2020-2030, by modeling potential changes in the future demand and supply of water. To demonstrate the economic impact of water scarcity, we evaluated the overall agricultural contribution to the IR Iran GDP. We have found that the 1999 severe drought in the IR Iran commenced a period of unusually dry conditions that is still ongoing. The rapidly growing Iranian urban populations presently experience a medium to extremely high overall water risk, with extremely high baseline water stress that, in part, is due to the lack of upstream protected lands. The relationship between baseline water stress and drought severity has been determined as weak, confirming that other factors than drought are equally or more important contributors to the existing water risk. Our projection calculations indicate that Iranian urban populations will continue to experience an extremely high water stress for the coming decade. Due to the fast growth of these populations as well as considerable rise of value added to the IR Iran GDP by other sectors of the national economy, the contribution of agricultural production to the national GDP has declined from about 25% to under 10% (although its total yield has risen considerably) during the past 30 years. This decrease has been directly proportional to the increased foreign food imports, dependency on the IR Iran oil exports and reduction in the non-oil exports. The main causes of water scarcity in the IR Iran appear to be due to climatic factors, insufficient environmental protection, and over-exploitation and mismanagement of water resources, especially by the agricultural sector. In conclusion, our study proposes anti-wasting water management action plan that recommends shifting the IR Iran government response to water scarcity from reactive survival strategies to proactive crisis prevention, with emphasis on safeguarding, monitoring, early warning, and effective step-by-step preparedness and readiness, and by laterally integrating water management between all levels of the IR Iran government, including local, regional and national, for a sustainable, resilient and prosperous economy of the Islamic Republic of Iran now and in the future.\n\nNowadays, climate change is known as one of the greatest biological, social, economic, political crises in the world, in most climate models that simulate future climate condition, they mostly pointed to the critical conditions. So that precipitation decreases in most parts and temperature also increased in most regions. The results of many research also suggests that the areas that are most vulnerable, are extremely more vulnerable toward climate changes. Critical condition which is formed as a result of climate change creates tension and conflict between nations over limited resources. The Middle East as a very fragile region, is one of the including areas that are heavily exposed to these risks. Based on the fact that the country of Iran is fragile in this region, is deeply influenced by these climate conditions. Tensions over limited resources may not only occur between countries but also there is potential in the domestic scale, and if there is no readiness to adapt against this crisis and efforts in order to reduce its effects then accordingly, it leads to tension between the provinces of a country. There were 517 cities that faced with the severe water stress in the warm season of 2014. While the number of these cities in the year of 2015 has reached to 570 cities, this water stress caused tension between some of the provinces in the country and if significant planning and management based on climate facts could not be conducted, then it is possible that leads political tensions among provinces.\n\nDaily consumption of 3.2 million cubic meters of water in the city of Tehran causes not only planning problems (estimation of demand and supply) and excessive costs to supply and transfer water. It also endangers the environment. In addition, it is not compatible with sustainable development. Global warming and the fact that the climate in Iran and specifically Tehran is turning hot has bought water crisis to this city. Considering that the Per capita daily water consumption in Tehran is three times as much as the international standards, the crisis seems to be more serious than water rationing such as the one implemented in the summer of 2014.This paper, aiming to plan to control this crisis, predicted precipitation in Tehran in the following 25 years by means of SDSM Model. Then, the amount of rainwater harvested in the city passages and the roofs was estimated and economically analyzed. Saving 20 percent of the water needed by the city, and an average decrease of 57 million dollars annually to supply and transfer water in Tehran by means of rainwater harvesting could be a management strategy to control the present crisis and the ones ahead."
