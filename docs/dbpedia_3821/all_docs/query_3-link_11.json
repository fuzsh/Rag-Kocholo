In order to qualify, businesses must satisfy SBA's definition of a small business concern, along with the size standards for small business.\n\nWhat is a small business size standard?\n\nA size standard, which is usually stated in number of employees or average annual receipts, represents the largest size that a business (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) may be to remain classified as a small business for SBA and federal contracting programs. The definition of “small” varies by industry.\n\nHow to calculate your small business size\n\nSize standards are mostly based on the average annual receipts or the average number of employees.\n\nHow does SBA calculate annual receipts?\n\nHow to determine number of employees?\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information about size standards, contact the size standards specialist at your nearest SBA Government Contracting Area Office. You also can contact the Office of Size Standards by email at sizestandards@sba.gov or by phone at 202-205-6618.\n\nSee historical versions of size standards, dating back to 2001.\n\nImportant Notice:"
