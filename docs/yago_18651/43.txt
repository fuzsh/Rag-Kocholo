Gordon Ramsay and Tana Hutcheson (now Ramsay), have been married for 27 years since tying the knot in 1996. The lovebirds have since welcomed six beautiful children.

The couple first became parents with the birth of their eldest, Megan, in 1998. Tana then gave birth to twins, Jack and Holly, in 1999, Matilda (Tilly) in 2003, Oscar 2019, and their youngest, Jesse, in 2023.

Gordon and Tana kept her recent pregnancy with their son, Jesse, relatively secret and therefore it came as a major shock to fans when his birth was announced.

Gordon and Tana welcomed their sixth baby to the world in November 2023. In a very unexpected post, Gordon shared photos of his wife Tana and their newborn baby.

Jesse James Ramsay is yet another bundle of love added to the Ramsay family… the couple now have three boys and three girls.

Gordon shared adorable pictures of Tana with baby Jesse and captioned his post, “What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!! One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls… Done.”

However, Tana shared a much more heartbreaking reality on her own Instagram page. Tana shared that her pregnancy with Jesse had been a very worrying time for her after she had a miscarriage with her previous son, Rocky, five months into her pregnancy.

“It’s been a nerve-wracking nine months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle,” Tana shared. Tana also revealed that this would be the couple’s last addition to the family… six children would be a hectic household!

Gordon and his wife welcomed their second-youngest child Oscar in 2019, and the couple were already in talks for baby number six back then.

Gordon spoke to The Mail’s You Magazine in 2021 and revealed that he and Tana had “discussed having another baby.”

“I said it was a great idea. She said: ‘Well, let’s start planning’. So I’m like: ‘Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I’m going to be the oldest dad at school, what’s going to happen on sports day?’,” he said.

“But it’s something we’d still consider, because it’s been such a joy spending time with Oscar.”

Gordon went on to add that their youngest at the time had kept them “super-active” and made them “better parents”, and that while Tana wasn’t pregnant at the time, they were “contemplating”.

Their eldest daughter Megan was the first in the family to attend university, and she graduated from Oxford Brookes University in 2019 with a degree in psychology.

Following in his older sister’s footsteps, Jack attended Dulwich College and then Exeter University, but in 2020, he joined the Royal Marines.

His twin sister Holly has been studying Fashion Design at university to become a model, and she’s also signed with agency Established Models.

Her modelling profile said she is “using her platform to inspire others to create unique and relatable content whilst travelling between London and LA.”

As for Tilly, or Matilda, she seems to be the one who’s taken after her father the most, and she’s ready to show off her skills in the MasterChef kitchen.

She’s starred on a number of cooking shows and written a cookbook called Matilda & The Ramsay Bunch: Tilly’s Kitchen Takeover and has also appeared on Gordon’s shows MasterChef Junior and Hell’s Kitchen.
