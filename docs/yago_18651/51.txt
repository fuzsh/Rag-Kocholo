Tana Ramsay, who is married to celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, is opening up about heartbreaking loss she experienced at 5-months pregnant in 2016.

“I found it really hard when people would talk to me and not mention it because it was like it never happened,” Tana, 46, told U.K. outlet Metro. “You go from having a baby kicking inside of you to suddenly it’s not there.”

Tana recalled how she felt an “aching” in her chest three days after her son died.

“It was my body getting ready to breastfeed, and there was no baby,” she explained.

And though her husband is known professionally for his furious temper and explosive outbursts, Tana says Gordon, 54, was the one who brought her the most comfort.

"Gordon was amazing," she said. "He's always been one to talk about everything. He…never made me feel that, ‘Oh, you know, maybe we shouldn’t talk about it.’”

Tana went on to praise Chrissy Teigen for helping to break the social stigma and shame surrounding pregnancy loss.

Teigen first shared the news of her late-term pregnancy loss on social media with a series of emotional hospital room pictures.

The supermodel and cookbook author later disclosed that her complications were caused by a partial placenta abruption. Teigen and her husband, John Legend, named their late son Jack.

“When I read about her situation, I don’t know the ins and outs, but certainly a lot of it sounded incredibly similar to mine,” Tana said. “It brings it all back and I think she was amazing for talking about it and posting the photos that she did.”
