        "text": "GORDON Ramsay enjoys a romantic date night with his wife Tana in California.\n\nThe celebrity chef, 57, and author Tana, 49, who have been married for 28 years, held hands and shared a kiss as they left up-market sushi restaurant Nobu Malibu at the weekend.\n\nThey drove off in a Porsche as it was revealed that more than 80 percent of the restaurants featured on his TV series Kitchen Nightmares have permanently closed since he intervened to try and turn around their fortunes.\n\nHe visited 105 restaurants in the UK, US, France and Spain for the show, which ran from 2007 to 2014, but only 19 are still open.\n\nEarlier this month it was reported that Gordon had given Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty his blessing to marry his daughter Holly.\n\nThe 24-year-old went public with the Team GB ace on Instagram in June 2023.\n\nThey first met when Holly's younger sister Tilly was competing alongside Adam on Strictly Come Dancing in 2021.\n\nThe pair could be set to tie the knot shortly after dad Gordon revealed he views Adam as the \"perfect\" son-in-law, reports OK! Magazine.\n\nTheir source claimed: \"Gordon really approves of Adam, he’s definitely got the Ramsay seal of approval!\n\n\"Gordon is actually a former footballer himself, he’s good friends with the Beckhams, and he really appreciates all the sacrifices and training that a top sportsman like Adam puts into his career.\"\n\nThey added: \"He really likes Adam, how he treats Holly and is ready to give his blessing if he proposes to his daughter, which is seeming very likely. He would love the Olympian to be part of the family.\n\n\"These two are a perfect match. Holly herself is really happy, she’s fallen hard and she knows her dad thinks Adam will make the perfect son-in-law.\n\n\"He’s cool, he’s strict with his regime which Gordon admires, and he’s a good all-around guy - a perfect match for his daughter. Gordon and Adam have a great bond, too - they respect each other but they also have a lot of banter.\""
