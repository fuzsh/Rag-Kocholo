        "text": "Thrilling news. We have an ambitious new celebrity waiting in the wings. Like a debutante waiting to be presented at court, Gordon Ramsay's wife Tana has made the decision that she would like to graduate from the nursery slopes of the chefs' spouse circuit. As such, she is preparing to take her special brand of . . . well, doubtless whatever it is will become clear . . . all the way to reality TV.\n\nOf course, Tana is already the author of two cookbooks, Tana Ramsay's Family Kitchen and Tana Ramsay's Phoned-In Nepotist Canapés. And she is co-opted thrice monthly into Gordon-helmed photoshoots, public appearances, and interviews about their amazing sex life.\n\nAmusingly, though, she has now judged that the public would like to see more of her family, not less, and this week she was photographed auditioning for ITV's Dancing on Ice. Yes, you read that correctly – the \"celebrities\" have to audition for Dancing on Ice. Isn't that silly? I thought they just rummaged around to see which former Bill stars had fallen down the back of the sofa, then fitted them with skates and the promise of a panto."
