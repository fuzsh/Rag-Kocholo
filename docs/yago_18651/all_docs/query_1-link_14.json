Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nSpeaking to People just two months ago, Ramsay hinted that the family could be expanding soon, stating that his wife wanted \"another one\" as she \"doesn't want Oscar growing up on his own.\"\n\nRamsay then joked about the downsides of potentially being a father again as he approaches his 60s.\n\n\"I'm going to be at school celebrating sports day with a f---ing walker!\" he said. \"'Hey, who's your granddad?' 'That's my dad, actually.'\"\n\n\"So I'm not too sure how many knee hip replacements they'll get by the time they get 21, but I'm going to try,\" he added.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the Ramsays' new arrival and their large family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ramsays grew into a family of eight in November 2023 with the arrival of their son Jesse James Ramsay.\n\nThe celebrity chef announced the birth via Instagram on November 11 by sharing a post showing his wife in the delivery room with their newborn son, Jesse James Ramsay. It is unclear exactly when Jesse was born.\n\nRamsay captioned the post: \"What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!! One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!!\"\n\nHe then suggested that Jesse James would be their last child, adding: \"3 boys, 3 girls.... Done.\"\n\nTana shared a post too, writing that it had \"been a nerve wracking 9 months but we've made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle.\"\n\nShe added: \"Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much.\"\n\nA representative for Ramsay did not respond to a request for comment made outside regular working hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGordon and Tana Ramsay, who married in 1996, always wanted a large family, she said in an interview in 2008.\n\nCayetana \"Tana\" Elizabeth Hutcheson was in her early 20s — and engaged to someone else — when she met Gordon Ramsay at a New Year's Eve party in London, but she didn't think much of him at first, she told The Guardian in 2008. However, they shared a mutual friend so bumped into each other again, and they started dating.\n\nIn 1996, when Gordon was 29 and Tana was 21, they got married in Chelsea, London.\n\nAfter initially struggling to conceive and going through in-vitro fertilization, they welcomed their first child, Megan, in 1998. By 2001, their first four children had been born.\n\nSpeaking to The Herald in 2008, Tana said they were surprised by how quickly their family grew.\n\n\"We knew we wanted a large family,\" she said, \"but for it to happen that close together is amazing. When I discovered I was expecting [our fourth child] Tilly I remember thinking, 'Oh my God, how am I going to manage?' But you do.\"\n\nTana, who initially trained as a teacher, is also accomplished in the kitchen, and she's published several cookbooks, including \"Tana's Kitchen Secrets\" and \"Tana Ramsay's Real Family Food.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn in 1998, their first daughter, Megan Jane Ramsay, does not have a public-facing career.\n\nMegan Ramsay, 25, was the first in her family to graduate from college, her dad shared on Instagram when she graduated from Oxford Brookes University in June 2019.\n\n\"So proud of this young Lady,\" he wrote alongside photos of Megan in her cap and gown, adding, \"hard work pays off !\"\n\nWhile she generally avoids the spotlight, Megan did appear on a 2021 episode of \"Hell's Kitchen,\" in which she celebrated her 21st birthday alongside her father.\n\nAnd while she keeps a low profile, that didn't stop her father from publicly disparaging her boyfriend.\n\nSpeaking to Kelly Clarkson on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" in January 2022, Ramsay said, \"Megan's started seeing her ex-boyfriend again, his name is Byron. He was OK to begin with, a bit wet. You want a man to date your daughter and he was just a little bit pathetic.\"\n\nBut he can be a doting dad, too. On her 24th birthday in May 2022, he shared a photograph on Instagram showing the two together.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to this gorgeous lady,\" he captioned the photo. \"Words can't describe enough how proud you make me feel every day.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn at the turn of the century, twins Holly and Jack Ramsay are now 23 years old.\n\nOn January 1, 2000, Holly Anna Ramsay and Jack Scott Ramsay were born. They arrived seven weeks early, according to Hello! magazine.\n\nIn an Instagram post in December 2020, Tana recalled her struggles as a mother to premature twins.\n\n\"Seeing them become little chubby, healthy babies within the first year was a true blessing and I will always be grateful for the determination they showed and their feisty characters,\" she wrote.\n\nToday, the twins have a close relationship, but their professional interests differ.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolly Ramsay works as a producer and podcast host.\n\nHolly Ramsay is a mental health advocate, podcast and documentary producer, and model. She has a following of over 300,000 on both Instagram and TikTok.\n\nHer podcast, 21 & Over, aims to support young people as they navigate struggles such as \"anxiety, self-doubt, mental health and creating identities in today's world,\" according to its description. In 2021, she opened up about her mental health journey on the podcast, disclosing that she is a survivor of sexual assault.\n\n\"I went to university, studied fashion design, and I loved it. But by the second half of the first year I was being affected by my PTSD and I had no idea that this was happening,\" she said of the aftermath.\n\nIn 2022, Variety reported that she was producing a documentary about sexual education. While that project hasn't materialized yet, Holly and her father revealed during an interview with People in September that they are developing a podcast about \"all the things you couldn't ask your dad and all the things your dad wants to ask.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolly's twin, Jack, has stayed far from the entertainment space, opting for a career in the military.\n\nJack is the athlete of the Ramsay family. According to People, he has played rugby and water polo, and he's studied jiu-jitsu.\n\nIn 2020, Jack joined the Royal Marines. In an Instagram post, Gordon Ramsay publicized his son's accomplishment.\n\n\"Can't tell you enough how proud I am of this young man Jack Ramsay you've made me feel like the proudest father today congrats on joining @royalmarines what amazing achievement,\" he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatilda \"Tilly\" Ramsay, born in 2001, has embraced the spotlight.\n\nIn 2015, Matilda, also known as Tilly, began starring in \"Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch,\" a children's cooking show on the BBC. Tilly later created a corresponding book, \"Matilda & The Ramsay Bunch: Tilly's Kitchen Takeover.\"\n\nHowever, in his April 2023 British GQ interview, Ramsay indicated that Tilly won't follow in his footsteps by pursuing a culinary career, noting that his son Oscar \"is my last hope of having a chef in the family.\"\n\nBeyond her cooking show, Tilly has made her fair share of TV appearances, including her runs as a contestant on \"Strictly Come Dancing\" and Australia's \"MasterChef.\"\n\nTilly Ramsay has over 1.2 million Instagram followers and over 10 million TikTok followers, making her the most-followed Ramsay child on social media. She makes TikToks with her father that reach tens of millions of views. In one popular video, she rated her father on a family vacation.\n\nIn November 2022, she shared a photo of herself as a toddler with her father in honor of his birthday.\n\n\"Happy birthday to my best friend!! Thank you for absolutely everything you do I wouldn't be the person I am without you, love you so much,\" she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016, Tana miscarried a child, Rocky, five months into her pregnancy.\n\nTana has spoken publicly about the pregnancy loss she experienced in 2016, and she encouraged people to discuss the often taboo topic of miscarriage.\n\n\"I found it really hard when people would talk to me and not mention it because it was like it never happened,\" she told Metro in 2020.\n\nIn an October 2021 Instagram post, Tana wrote about her family's experience.\n\n\"If all had gone as we hoped yesterday 14/10/21 would have been our little boy Rocky's 5th birthday, the day he was due not the day he was actually born when he was too little to survive,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Not a day goes by when we don't think of him,\" she continued, \"but, it wasn't meant to be.\"\n\nSpeaking on her husband's role during the hardship, Tana told Metro, \"Gordon was amazing, and he's always been one to talk about everything, and he was very good at sort of talking it out of me and never making me feel that, 'Oh, you know, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.'\"\n\nIn June 2023, she thanked her entire family in an Instagram post for their support throughout the hardship. \"I couldn't do this without my family, you are all everything to me,\" she wrote.\n\nIn 2018, when they were 18, Holly and Jack ran the London Marathon to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital and in memory of Rocky, Hello! reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April 2019, the Ramsays welcomed their 4-year-old son, Oscar.\n\nOscar James Ramsay was born in April 2019. In 2023, Tana shared photos of her son on Instagram for his fourth birthday, writing, \"4 already — wow where has that gone!! 4 years of loving you you crazy clever little boy - love you endlessly.\"\n\nHis sisters, Tilly and Holly, manage the toddler's Instagram account.\n\nAs Insider's Anneta Konstantinides reported, Ramsay has said his 4-year-old son is his only remaining hope for his cooking legacy to continue.\n\nHe told Jimmy Fallon during a January 2021 interview that Oscar is his \"last hope of getting anyone into the industry.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Ramsay previously said that he and his wife were \"contemplating\" another child.\n\n\"She's not pregnant, but we are contemplating,\" he told the Daily Mail of his wife in 2021.\n\n\"We discussed having another baby. I said it was a great idea. She said: 'Well, let's start planning.' So I'm like: 'Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I'm going to be the oldest dad at school, what's going to happen on sports day?'\n\n\"But it's something we'd still consider, because it's been such a joy spending time with Oscar.\"\n\nIn his January 2023 Heart Breakfast interview, he seemed less certain.\n\n\"Tana would like another baby and I'm like, 'No, no, no, no,'\" he said. \"It's already hard enough thinking about when I go to take Oscar to school, 'Hey, what's your grandad's name?'\"\n\nRead next\n\nEntertainment Chef Family\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
