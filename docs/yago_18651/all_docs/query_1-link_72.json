        "text": "Gordon Ramsay and his wife Tana are celebrating 22 years of marriage.\n\nThe TV chef shared a throwback wedding snap to Instagram on Friday to mark the occasion.\n\nIn the photo, the couple – who tied the knot in 1996 – look over the moon with Tana gazing lovingly at her hubby during their special day.\n\nRead more: Gordon Ramsay reveals he wore son Jack’s pants after he went to university\n\nGordon captioned the post: “22yrs today…. happy anniversary gorgeous @tanaramsay.”\n\nFans rushed to comment on the snap with one person writing: “Congratulations and happy anniversary.”\n\nAnother said: “Congratulations to you both. Have a wonderful Day!” while a third added: “Congratulations you two, happy anniversary!! Here’s to many more.”\n\nThe couple’s daughter Holly, 18, paid tribute to her parents on the special occasion.\n\nShe wrote on Instagram: “Happy 22nd anniversary to the two most important people I know, thank you for everything.”\n\nHolly and her twin brother Jack recently moved away for university after passing their A-Levels with flying colours.\n\nBut Gordon, 52, admitted he was struggling with his kids not being at home.\n\nIn October, the star revealed wearing Jack’s pants made him realise just how much he missed him.\n\nGordon borrowed some underwear from the only other male in his household when Jack moved away from home.\n\nAnd it was only when he put the garments on that he realised how much he wanted his son, who is studying at Exeter University, to be back home.\n\nHolly has also moved out of home – even though she’s studying not far from her family home.\n\nDuring an appearance on US programme The Late Late Show with James Corden, Gordon said: “Holly has gone to uni in London, she’s even moved out and we live in London.\n\n“I said, ‘Why are you moving out?’ She said, ‘Peace. Quiet. I can get back at 4 in the morning without you saying ‘What you doing at 4 in the morning.'”\n\nRead more: Gordon Ramsay treats his twins to dinner to celebrate A-Level results\n\nThe couple’s daughter Tilly, 17, is now the only one of Gordon and Tana’s children living with them and they want to do all they can to get her to stay.\n\nHe quipped: “[She’s our] princess, we’re slowing down the studies and asking if she can leave home at 25, manipulation.”\n\nThe couple are also parents to daughter Megan, 20."
