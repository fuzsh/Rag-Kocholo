        "text": "Gordon Ramsay let slip a hint that he and his wife Tana Ramsay could be expecting their sixth child soon.\n\nThe couple, who recently celebrated their 26th wedding anniversary, are already proud parents to five children - Meghan, 23, twins Jack and Holly, 22, Tilly, 21, and three-year-old Oscar - but could have another on the way.\n\nThe Michelin starred chef, who is originally from Johnstone, joined Amanda Holden and Jamie Theakston on Heart Radio to promote his new TV show Next Level Chef.\n\nGordon, 56, was joined by fellow chef Paul Ainsworth to tell listeners all about their new ITV cooking show before the conversation soon turned to the Hell's Kitchen stars family life. “Last time I looked there were five, there could be one more on the way,” he joked.\n\n“Tanya’s jeans aren’t fitting her, she would love one more baby and I’m like no, no, no,\" he laughed. To which host Amanda asked: \"Is it Christmas or is it a baby?\"\n\n\"Do you know what, I don’t know yet. I’ll double check when I get back. I’m going to Boots on the way back from here and I’ll double check,\" Gordon replied.\n\n\"Tana would like another baby and I’m like, 'no no no', it’s already hard enough when I take Oscar to school 'hey what’s your grandad’s name?' or sports day, Jamie when I’m standing there with a stick and an egg and spoon thinking 'holy…'.\n\nGordon insisted he was going to get into serious trouble with his wife following his slip of the tongue, leaving listeners certain the couple are expecting another child.\n\nThis isn't the first time the Kitchen Nightmares star has discussed the idea of expanding the family. \"She's not pregnant, but we are contemplating,\" he told the Daily Mail in 2021 after joking Tana, 47, is \"four months pregnant\".\n\n\"We discussed having another baby. I said it was a great idea,\" Gordon recounted. \"She said: 'Well, let's start planning.' So I'm like: 'Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I'm going to be the oldest dad at school, what's going to happen on sports day?'\"\n\n\"But it's something we'd still consider, because it's been such a joy spending time with Oscar. Just watching his first walks on the beach at Daymer Bay. Watching his first little mouthfuls of food. It has kept us super-active and made us better parents.\"\n\nGordon became a father again in his early fifties as he welcomed baby Oscar with Tana. Speaking to the Mirror at the time, he added: \"I am convinced I am going to spend more time with Oscar, I am excited to be more hands-on.\"\n\nThe dad-of-five also reflected on his own childhood and his relationship with his own father. \"I had a very humble upbringing—loved by my mother and, I think, loved by my father, but I was desperate to get out the sh**hole I was in,\" he explained.\n\n\"I didn't want to turn out like my dad. I didn't want to live in a council house and put my kids to school with second-hand clothes. You strive to better yourself.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox. Sign up to our weekly Showbiz newsletterhere.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
