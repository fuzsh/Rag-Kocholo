        "text": "Born in August 1974, Cayetana “Tana” Elizabeth Hutcheson married the budding chef in December 1996 when she was 22 and he was 30. Since then, they’ve welcomed six children together.\n\nWhat does Tana Ramsay do for a living?\n\nTana, who initially trained as a Montessori teacher, is also accomplished in the kitchen and she’s published several cookbooks, including Tana’s Kitchen Secrets and Tana Ramsay’s Real Family Food. But she admitted to Toronto City News in November 2008 that she’s not as speedy in the kitchen as her chef husband.\n\n“I’ve never been trained as a chef. I take forever to chop an onion or a carrot compared to [Gordon], but it’s my way of real family food,” she told the outlet. “Our dishes are completely different, and it’s the home cooking he wants when he’s at home.”\n\nPer her author’s bio for HarperCollins Publishers, the 49-year-old is a former food editor for Grazia magazine. In 2011 she also opened a salon called All About the Girl in London that offered various beauty treatments, but passed ownership to high end nailbar Townhouse and its founder Juanita Huber-Millet last year.\n\nHow did Gordon Ramsay meet his wife?\n\nTana was in her early 20s – and engaged to someone else – when she met Ramsay at a New Year’s Eve party in London, but she didn’t think much of him at first, she told The Guardian in 2008, describing him as “a complete arrogant arse”.\n\nBut first impressions aren’t everything. They shared a mutual friend, bumped into each other again, and later began dating.\n\nHow many children do Gordon and Tana Ramsay have?\n\nThe couple kept the pregnancy a secret before announcing it on Instagram. Tana wrote: “It’s been a nerve wracking 9 months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle. Ramsay family definitely complete.”\n\nDid Tana Ramsay struggle with fertility issues?\n\nBefore welcoming Oscar and Jesse, Tana miscarried a child, Rocky, five months into her pregnancy in 2016. She has spoken publicly about the pregnancy loss she experienced and encouraged people to discuss the often taboo topic of miscarriage. “I found it really hard when people would talk to me and not mention it because it was like it never happened,” she told Metro in 2020.\n\nIs Tana Ramsay good friends with Victoria Beckham?\n\nTwo years earlier, Tana shared a series of photos on Instagram in honour of her fashion designer friend, captioning the carousel: “Happy happy Birthday to my very special friend – so many memories and lots more to come x you are amazing and I am so grateful for our friendship x love you so much xxx.”\n\nHow does Tana Ramsay stay fit?\n\nTana shared a video on Instagram in August 2021 where she wore her wedding dress and captioned it “25 years and 5 pregnancies later and happy to say it still fits”. Fans were quick to comment on how incredible she looked and one even wrote “Goals”.\n\nThe mother of six enjoys exercising – she goes for daily runs, has completed a half-Ironman and does long cycle rides with Gordon on Sundays, according to British media. “For me, a mum in my 40s, it’s also about doing something just to feel good about myself. I’ve given the kids all of my attention for all of these years, so it’s time for me.”"
