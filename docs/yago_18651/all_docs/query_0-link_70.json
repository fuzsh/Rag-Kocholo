        "text": "Gordon Ramsay and his wife Tana enjoyed a romantic date night over the weekend where they put on an affection display of affection. The couple, who share six children, walked hand in hand and appeared as loved-up as ever.\n\nFor a rare night without the kids, the Kitchen Nightmares star, 57, and cookbook author, 49, treated themselves to dinner at Nobu on Sunday, 4 August. They arrived in their swanky Porsche 911 GT3 RS, which is estimated to be worth £192,000, and walked hand in hand after their romantic evening out.\n\nTana showed off her slim figure, less than a year after welcoming their sixth child in November, in a pair of flared blue jeans and a white cropped vest. She completed the look with a pair of chunky tan leather heels and a nude handbag, while her long brunette locks were down in bouncy waves.\n\nThe TV star chef opted for a navy blue polo shirt, black jeans and a casual pair of black trainers. In photos obtained by Daily Mail, Gordon could be seen lovingly opening the door of his Porsche for his wife of almost three decades.\n\nThe couple tied the knot on 21 December 1996 and have previously spoken about the importance of spending quality time together. Earlier this year, Gordon told PEOPLE: \"Date nights are crucial, whether it's the cinema, whether it's going out for a drive. We have a little time, but it's quality, and so that is really important.\"\n\nHe also spoke about getaways together and previously shared: \"We were in Nottingham two weeks ago. We went to go see Tilly up at her university. And after walking the campus and seeing Tilly on her campus, we then went for dinner at a two-Michelin star [restaurant] up in Nottingham and then drove back the next morning.\"\n\nSign up to OK!'s daily newsletter to get updates sent to your inbox for free\n\nThe parents certainly have their hands full with six children, Megan, 26, twins Holly and Jack, 24, Matilda 'Tilly', 22, Oscar, five, and Jesse who was born in November 2023. Their daughter Holly is dating Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and has been cheering him on in Paris.\n\nThe Olympic champion has credited Gordon for helping him climb out of a \"deep, dark hole\" after he faced personal challenges. This followed when his unbeaten streak came to an end at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, which coincidied with his split from his son's mother.\n\nIn an intimate tell-all with The Sunday Times, Adam expressed his admiration for Gordon's no-nonsense approach to life and work. Adam said: \"He [Gordon] is an incredible energy to be around and an incredible person to have that guidance from. Gordon is a high performer.\"\n\nHe continued: \"He worked his way up to the upper echelons of his industry and works in a place where there's no bulls**t. I take a lot from that and from the professionalism he has every single day with a relentless pursuit.\""
