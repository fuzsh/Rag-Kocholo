        "text": "There’s a new addition to Gordon Ramsay’s family.\n\nThe TV chef’s wife, Tana Ramsay, gave birth to a new bundle of joy on Nov. 11. The Ramsays shared their good news, including photos of their newborn son on his Instagram account. Mr. Ramsay, who celebrated his 57th birthday on Nov. 8, called the new arrival “an amazing birthday present.”\n\nOne photo shows him kissing the head of his newborn son.\n\n“What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!!\n\n“One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done,” Mr. Ramsay wrote in the caption.\n\nThe couple’s announcement was somewhat unexpected, as Tana Ramsay’s pregnancy was largely kept out of the public eye, although Gordon joked about Tana being pregnant earlier in the year, the Daily Record reported.\n\nIn an interview in September, Gordon remarked on the Dish podcast that his 49-year-old wife had expressed her wish to expand their already extensive family, despite he himself not being so sure.\n\n“I’ve got a little secret… Tana wants another one,” he told hosts Nick Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett. No news about Tana’s pregnancy had been made public at the time, and podcast listeners were generally unaware it was a tease.\n\nThe recent announcement sparked a barrage of congratulatory comments on social media, including from other celebrities such as former Chelsea soccer player Frank Lampard and fellow TV chef James Martin.\n\n“Tana looks stunning! Congratulations to you both and welcome to the world Jesse James!” a fan commented.\n\n“Wonderful, Chef! Congrats to your whole family!” posted another.\n\nThe Ramsays’ latest family addition comes on top of their other 5 children, with little Jesse sharing a 25 year age gap with their eldest child Megan. Their son Oscar, the couple’s fifth child was born in 2019. Tana previously suffered a miscarriage at 20 weeks in 2016.\n\nThe Ramsays’ other children are Matilda, a TV presenter and social media influencer best known for hosting the cooking show ‘Matilda and the Ramsay bunch’ on the BBC, as well as twins Jack and Holly. Their eldest daughter Megan graduated from Oxford in 2019, with a degree in psychology.\n\nGordon and Tana Ramsay have been married since 1996.\n\nMr. Ramsay made joking remarks about how he was reluctant to become a dad again, worried that he would be mistaken for his child’s granddad, according to the Mirror.\n\n“It’s like going to school, going out for dinner in two buses. And secondly, I’m going to be the oldest [expletive] at school. ‘Who’s your grandad?’”\n\nRamsay is renown for his controversial approach, often using profanities to describe some of the “disasters” he encounters during his visits to restaurant kitchens.\n\nHe has featured in a vast array of TV cooking and reality shows, including “Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares,” “Hell’s Kitchen,” and “The F Word.”"
