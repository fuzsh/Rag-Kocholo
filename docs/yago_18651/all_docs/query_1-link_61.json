        "text": "You may know Gordon Ramsay as the chef on Hell's Kitchen, but at home he's a dad to four kids between the ages of 14 and 17 with wife Tana. The two have been married since 1996, and Ramsay shared the news in May that his wife was expecting another baby in September. But today, Ramsay, 49, took to Facebook with some heartbreaking news: Tana, 41, suffered a miscarriage after just five months of pregnancy.\n\nRamsay wrote in his post that the couple had a \"devastating weekend\" as Tana \"miscarried our son,\" revealing the previously unknown gender of the baby. \"We're together healing as a family, but we want to thank everyone again for all your amazing support and well wishes,\" Ramsay added. Miscarriages aren't uncommon. According to the Mayo Clinic, about 10 to 20 percent of all pregnancies end in a miscarriage. Most miscarriages happen in the first trimester, however, and Tana was in her second trimester. A late miscarriage like hers is pretty rare.\n\nThe cause of Tana's miscarriage has not been revealed. We do know that age can sometimes make a pregnancy riskier. The Mayo Clinic says that women who are pregnant after the age of 35 have a higher risk of pregnancy loss, including miscarriage or stillbirth. And some studies also show that the risk of miscarriage slightly increases when the paternal age is over 40, too. Other causes of late miscarriages include fetal abnormalities or infection.\n\nOur thoughts are with the Ramsay family during this difficult time, and we're proud of the chef for opening up publicly about the miscarriage. It's an all too common issue that often doesn't get discussed. And Ramsay shared the news in such a positive way: He posted an old photo of him giving his wife a kiss after she completed an Ironman competition. She's one strong lady.\n\nYou can read Ramsay's full post below:\n\nRelated:\n\n12 Little Accessories That Make Reading Even More Enjoyable\n\nThese items can create a cozy atmosphere and help you stay focused.\n\n62 Best Labor Day Sales to Pounce on Before the Long Weekend\n\nExcellent deals on mattresses, skin care, fitness equipment, and more.\n\nWomen’s Sports Bars Are Changing the Game\n\nRoot for your team, make like-minded friends, and enjoy a beer without someone mansplaining free throws.\n\nIs Laser Hair Removal Worth It?
