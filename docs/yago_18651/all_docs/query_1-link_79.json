        "text": "Gordon Ramsay has opened up about his 22kg weight loss in a new interview and has revealed he shed the pounds to save his marriage with wife Tana Ramsay.\n\n“Tana was not impressed with the way I was. It was painful. I used to look at myself in the mirror and think, ‘Holy s–t!’ So it was a big wake-up call,” he said, according to The Daily Mail.\n\nGordon, 51, and Tana, 42, married in 1996 and are parents to four kids: Megan, 20, Holly and Jack, both 18, and Matilda, 16.\n\n“I was overweight. I look at the pictures and think, ‘How did Tana stay around?’ Because Tana has got better-looking and more gorgeous. And there she is, getting in bed with a fat f–k.”\n\nHe added, “I didn’t have a figure. I didn’t feel that good. After working my a– off and achieving a lot, I wanted to get in serious shape.”\n\nIt took Gordon some time to get his diet, exercise routine and health back in order, but he eventually go into a routine that works well for him.\n\n“I started focusing on getting super fit five or six years ago when my life got super busy. You get consumed by the work. You get sucked up,” the Hell’s Kitchen star shared.\n\n“You get drawn in. All of a sudden your ‘me time’ is zero. There was no breathing space, no downtime, no time to even think straight. It all started hitting me hard. I didn’t panic, but my head was not in the game.”\n\nBut don’t worry, the TV star didn’t turn to a dietician to shed the weight. “I haven’t got a dietician, my a–! Do you know what my dietician is?” he asked.\n\n“Standing stark butt naked on the scales every day. That’s my dietician right there.”\n\nYep, that’ll do it, Gordon!"
