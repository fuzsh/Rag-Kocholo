        "text": "First meeting\n\nThe childhood sweethearts met in 1992 when celebrity chef Gordon was aged 26 and Tana was aged 18. Former schoolteacher Tana admitted that the Hell's Kitchen star came across as \"so arrogant\" with a \"larger than life\" character when they met.\n\n\"I remember when I first met him [at 18] – and I was actually dating one of his friends – I said, ‘Oh my God, he’s so arrogant,’ because it’s always his voice you heard. He was always the one riling everyone up. In that respect, he has not changed at all. It’s just gotten more obvious. But at the same time, he is, believe it or not, incredibly sensitive – he’s a crier,\" Tana told People.\n\nWinter wedding\n\nVery few details are known about Gordon and Tana's wedding, aside from a few rare throwback photos. Exiting a set of large church doors, Tana looked stunning in a satin wedding dress with a V-neck and capped sleeves with an embellished trim. The fitted bodice highlighted her waist before the material fell into a full skirt.\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon was pictured gazing lovingly at his new wife wearing a morning suit with a grey waistcoat, a striped tie and a black tailcoat, slicking his blonde hair away from his face.\n\nTying in with the colour scheme, Tana's adorable flower girl was dressed in a red velvet dress with a Peter Pan collar and a maroon flower headband.\n\nMarriage comments\n\nTana sweetly told People that she still gets butterflies around her husband. \"When it comes to our busy schedules, people say, ‘It must be hard having to be apart so often,’\" she began. \"It is, but I feel really lucky that I still get butterflies when we haven’t seen each other for a few weeks. I never want to take that for granted – even with all these kids to worry about. We have a lot of fun.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon joked that Tana was the reason he was motivated to focus on his health.\n\n“[Wife] Tana was not impressed with the way I was,” the Kitchen Nightmares host told The Times. “I was overweight, 18 stone [115kg]. I looked like a sack of [expletive]. I look at the pictures and think, ‘How did Tana stay around?’ Because Tana has got better-looking and more gorgeous. And there she is, getting in bed with a fat [expletive.]\n\n\"It was a big wake-up call,\" said Gordon, who was motivated to lose nearly 30 kilograms as he lost his father at a similar age."
