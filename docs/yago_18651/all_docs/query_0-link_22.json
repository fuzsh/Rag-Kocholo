        "text": "Gordon and Tana's son Jesse joined their family in November\n\nHappy anniversary, chef.\n\nGordon Ramsay celebrated his 27th wedding anniversary with wife Tana on Thursday. The Hell's Kitchen star shared a heartfelt post from their big day on Dec. 21, 1996.\n\n\"Happy 27th wedding anniversary to this amazing woman , wife , mother , thank you for everything you do , love you ❤️,\" he wrote.\n\nThis year was made even more special by the addition of their sixth child together, a son named Jesse James Ramsay, who was born on Nov. 11. Gordon and Tana also share kids, Megan, 25, twins Jack and Holly, 23, daughter Matilda “Tilly,\" 22, and Oscar, 4.\n\nRelated: Gordon Ramsay’s Wife Tana on the Gordon She Knows: ‘I Still Get Butterflies’ (Exclusive)\n\nThe holiday festivities have started at the Ramsay household. Gordon was pictured cuddling his youngest two children in a snap shared by Tana on Wednesday.\n\n“Daddy has arrived home now Christmas can really begin x @gordongram we love you x,” Tana’s caption read.\n\nEarlier this year, Gordon and Tana spoke to PEOPLE about their love story.\n\n“I remember when I first met him—and I was actually dating one of his friends—I said, ‘Oh my God, he’s so arrogant,’ because it’s always his voice you heard. He was always the one riling everyone up. In that respect, he has not changed at all. It’s just gotten more obvious,\" said Tana. \"But at the same time, he is, believe it or not, incredibly sensitive—he’s a crier.”\n\nRelated: Gordon Ramsay Hugs Sons Jesse, 5 Weeks, and Oscar, 4: ‘Now Christmas Can Really Begin’\n\nThey credit their lasting love to strong communication and making time for each other even if it’s just “a drive in the car,” said Gordon. “What comes out on our walks and hikes on weekends is incredible.”\n\n“It sounds really cliché, but as long as you’re friends, as long as you kind of like each other, it’s going to be good,\" added Tana.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
