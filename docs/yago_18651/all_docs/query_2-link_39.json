        "text": "Gordon Ramsay is famously grumpy. In fact, he's made a career out of it. On paper, he wouldn't seem easy to live with. Yet, his wife, Tana Ramsey, has stuck by his side through thick and thin ever since tying the knot in 1996. They share five children and seem, well, pretty happy! According to The Guardian, Tana grew up on a farm in Kent, a short commute to London. Per The Guardian, her childhood was full of playtime. \"'We didn't care about things like clothes,\" she said. \"I was a real tomboy. It was amazing. We'd clear out of the door at nine o'clock in the morning, and didn't come back until we were hungry. With my own children, I'm obsessed with knowing where they are, who they're with. You have to be. But it's so sad [to have less freedom].\"\n\nPer the same outlet, Tana was training to be a Montessori teacher in London and was living with Gordon's mutual friend Tim, whom she had recently broken up with, when they met. Gordon used to store his bike at their flat and one night when he went to get the key, Tana was there. According to The Guardian, \"They talked all night and, as the dawn broke, he took her out on his bike.\" They were married soon after in 1998! Here's more you didn't know about Tana.\n\nTogether, Tana and Gordon Ramsay have five children and are living their best life. Along with being a mother, Tana (born Cayetana Elizabeth Hutcheson) is also, get this, a cookbook author. As she told the Toronto City News, \"I've never been trained as a chef. I take forever to chop an onion or a carrot compared to [Gordon] but it's my way of real family food. Our dishes are completely different, and it's the home cooking he wants when he's at home.\"\n\nTana may be no Gordon, but she does seem passionate. She told the outlet, \"I remember going home and having a home-cooked meal on the table â€” just the comfort that gave me as a child and the security it makes you feel. That's what I want to do for my family.\"\n\nWhile she's faced some backlash for launching a career \"on the back of her husband's kitchen skills,\" as the Herald Scotland bluntly put it, she is dedicated to cooking and to making a name for herself outside of her husband's shadow, despite the haters. \"I enjoy it and I get excited when I do the books and the magazines. It's important for me to do it. I just feel like it's my time now,\" she said. Tana, per The Sun, is also a presenter on UKTV's \"Market Kitchen.\" Her career choice is nothing to get steamed about!"
