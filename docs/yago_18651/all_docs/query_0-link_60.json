        "text": "Her only natural birth was with their daughter Tilly, who was born when Tana was 22. Tana discovered she was four months pregnant with Tilly in 2012. In 2016, the couple endured the heartbreaking loss of their son Rocky, who died at birth. This profound loss marked a significant moment in their lives.\n\nOscar, now five, and Jesse, just eight months old, were both conceived through IVF. The frozen embryos from Oscar's implantation were used later for Jesse. Tana described Oscar’s pregnancy as relatively uncomplicated, “Oscar’s pregnancy was actually – I had one or two scares, but it was very straightforward.”\n\nParenting with Experience and Wisdom\n\nTana's journey through parenthood has been significantly shaped by her experience with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which necessitated the use of IVF for several pregnancies. Reflecting on this, Tana spoke fondly of her youngest, Jesse, noting the emotional connection to her late son Rocky: “There’s a bit of Rocky in Jesse and it’s kind of made us all feel whole again.”\n\nAlso Read: Madhuri Dixit’s Husband Dr Shriram Nene Recommends Following Cooking Oils For Better Heart Health\n\nThe Ramsay household, with children ranging widely in age, faces unique challenges. Tana remarked on the evolution of her parenting style over the years, “I’ve been the youngest mum at the school gate and I’m obviously now the oldest, but I don’t think it stands out. There’s a lot of older mums and, actually, I think we’re all a bit calmer.”\n\nGordon Ramsay echoed his wife’s sentiments in an interview with PEOPLE in May, expressing how the experience has made him a better father the second time around. He praised Tana for her strength and adaptability, highlighting how their shared journey has deepened their bond and understanding as parents.\n\nReasons to Consider In Vitro Fertilization\n\nFor many, the path to parenthood can be fraught with challenges. Traditional options like surrogacy or adoption were once the only alternatives for those unable to conceive naturally. However, the advent of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in 1978 revolutionised family building, offering hope to millions. Here are several compelling reasons why individuals and couples might consider IVF:\n\nMedical Issues\n\nMedical conditions such as endometriosis, which can cause scar tissue on reproductive organs, often hinder natural conception. IVF allows embryos to be implanted directly into the uterus, bypassing such obstacles. Additionally, individuals undergoing treatments that affect fertility, like chemotherapy, can preserve their eggs or sperm for future use through IVF.\n\nAlso Read: Bob Morley Opens Up About Body Dysmorphia; Here’s How To Deal With It\n\nInfertility\n\nInfertility, defined as the inability to conceive after one year of trying or experiencing multiple failed pregnancies, affects many. Approximately one-third of fertility issues arise from the woman's reproductive system, another third from the man's, and the remaining third from a combination or unknown factors. IVF can circumvent many of these issues by facilitating the fertilization and implantation of a viable embryo.\n\nGenetic Disorders\n\nFor couples at risk of passing on inherited genetic disorders, IVF can be a viable solution. Utilizing donor sperm or eggs can mitigate this risk, allowing for the birth of healthy children free from inherited conditions.\n\nParenthood Later in Life\n\nMany women choose to delay motherhood to pursue other life goals. For those in their 30s or 40s, freezing eggs in their 20s can be a strategic option. When ready, these viable eggs can be fertilized through IVF, offering a chance to conceive despite age-related fertility decline.\n\nLGBTQ+ and Surrogacy\n\nIVF provides numerous options for LGBTQ+ couples wishing to start a family. Lesbian couples can use one partner's eggs to create an embryo for the other to carry. Gay couples can employ a surrogate with one partner's sperm and a donor egg, making parenthood accessible regardless of biological constraints.\n\nBottomline\n\nTana Ramsay’s openness about her IVF journey underscores the resilience required in the face of fertility challenges. IVF has provided countless individuals with the opportunity to build the families they dream of, offering solutions to a myriad of reproductive issues. Whether grappling with infertility, delaying parenthood, facing medical challenges, or navigating genetic concerns, IVF stands as a beacon of hope for many. For those considering IVF, consulting with fertility specialists can provide personalized insights and options tailored to unique circumstances, opening doors to the possibility of parenthood."
