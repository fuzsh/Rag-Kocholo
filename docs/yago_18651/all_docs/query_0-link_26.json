        "text": "Cayetana “Tana” Elizabeth Hutcheson was in her early 20s – and engaged to someone else – when she met Gordon at a New Year’s Eve party in London, but she didn’t think much of him at first, she told The Guardian in 2008. However, they shared a mutual friend so bumped into each other again, and they started dating.\n\nIn 1996, when Gordon was 29 and Tana was 21, they got married in Chelsea, London.\n\nAfter initially struggling to conceive and going through in vitro fertilisation, they welcomed their first child, Megan, in 1998. By 2001, their first four children had been born.\n\nSpeaking to The Herald in 2008, Tana said they were surprised by how quickly their family grew. “We knew we wanted a large family,” she said, “but for it to happen that close together is amazing. When I discovered I was expecting [our fourth child] Tilly I remember thinking, ‘Oh my God, how am I going to manage?’ But you do.”\n\nTana, who initially trained as a teacher, is also accomplished in the kitchen and she’s published several cookbooks, including Tana’s Kitchen Secrets and Tana Ramsay’s Real Family Food.\n\nRead on to meet the five kids of the renowned celebrity chef.\n\n1. Megan Ramsay, 24\n\nBorn in 1998, their first daughter, Megan Jane Ramsay, does not have a public-facing career. She was the first in her family to graduate from university, her dad shared on Instagram when she graduated from Oxford Brookes University in 2019. “So proud of this young lady,” he wrote alongside photos of Megan in her cap and gown, adding, “hard work pays off!”\n\nShe now works at a PR and communications company in London, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nWhile she generally avoids the spotlight, Megan did make an appearance on an episode of Hell’s Kitchen, in which she celebrated her 21st birthday alongside her father.\n\nAnd while she keeps a low profile, that didn’t stop her father from publicly disparaging her boyfriend. Speaking to Kelly Clarkson on The Kelly Clarkson Show in January 2022, Ramsay said, “Megan started seeing her ex-boyfriend again, his name is Byron. He was OK to begin with, a bit wet. You want a man to date your daughter and he was just a little bit pathetic.”\n\nBut he can be a doting dad, too. On her 24th birthday in May 2022, he shared a photograph on Instagram showing the two together. “Happy birthday to this gorgeous lady,” he captioned the photo. “Words can’t describe enough how proud you make me feel every day.”\n\n2 and 3. Twins Holly and Jack Ramsay, 23\n\nOn January 1, 2000, Holly Anna Ramsay and Jack Scott Ramsay were born. They arrived seven weeks early, according to Hello! magazine.\n\nIn an Instagram post in December 2020, their mother recalled her struggles as a mother to premature twins. “Seeing them become little chubby, healthy babies within the first year was a true blessing and I will always be grateful for the determination they showed and their feisty characters,” she wrote.\n\nToday, the twins have a close relationship, but their professional interests differ.\n\nHolly is mental-health advocate, podcast and documentary producer, and model. She has a following of over 300,000 on both Instagram and TikTok.\n\nHer podcast, 21 & Over, aims to support young people as they navigate struggles such as “anxiety, self-doubt, mental health and creating identities in today’s world”, according to its description. In 2021, she opened up about her own mental-health journey on the podcast, disclosing that she is a survivor of sexual assault.\n\n“I went to university, studied fashion design, and I loved it. But by the second half of the first year I was being affected by my PTSD and I had no idea that this was happening,” she said of the aftermath. According to Variety, she is in the process of producing a documentary that discusses sexual education.\n\nHolly’s twin Jack has stayed far from the entertainment space, opting for a career in the military. According to People, he has played rugby and water polo and he studied jiu-jitsu.\n\nIn 2020, Jack joined the Royal Marines. In an Instagram post, Gordon publicised his son’s accomplishment. “Can’t tell you enough how proud I am of this young man Jack Ramsay. You’ve made me feel like the proudest father today. Congrats on joining @royalmarines, what [an] amazing achievement,” he wrote.\n\n4. Matilda “Tilly” Ramsay, 21\n\nMatilda “Tilly” Ramsay, born in 2001, has embraced the spotlight. In 2015, she began starring in Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch, a children’s cooking show on the BBC. Tilly later created a corresponding book, Matilda & The Ramsay Bunch: Tilly’s Kitchen Takeover.\n\nHowever, in his April 2023 British GQ interview, Gordon indicated that Tilly won’t be following in his footsteps by pursuing a culinary career, noting that his youngest son, Oscar, “is my last hope of having a chef in the family”.\n\nBeyond her own cooking show, Tilly has made her fair share of TV appearances, including her runs as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing and Australia’s MasterChef.\n\nTilly has over 1.2 million Instagram followers and over 10 million TikTok followers, making her the most-followed Ramsay child on social media. She makes TikToks with her father that reach tens of millions of views. In one popular video, she rated her father on a family holiday.\n\nIn a recent post, she shared a photo of herself as a toddler with her father in honour of his birthday. “Happy birthday to my best friend!! Thank you for absolutely everything you do. I wouldn’t be the person I am without you, love you so much,” she wrote.\n\n5. Oscar Ramsay, 4\n\nOscar James Ramsay, born in April 2019, is currently the baby of the family.\n\nTana shared photos of her son on Instagram in honour of his fourth birthday, writing, “4 already – wow, where has [the time] gone!! Four years of loving you, you crazy, clever little boy – love you endlessly.”\n\nHis sisters, Tilly and Holly, manage the toddler’s Instagram account, which has almost 310,000 followers.\n\nHowever, Gordon has previously said that he and his wife were “contemplating” another child: “We discussed having another baby. I said it was a great idea. She said: ‘Well, let’s start planning.’ So I’m like: ‘Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I’m going to be the oldest dad at school, what’s going to happen on sports day?’”\n\n“But it’s something we’d still consider, because it’s been such a joy spending time with Oscar.”\n\nBut in his January Heart Breakfast interview, he seemed less certain. “Tana would like another baby and I’m like, ‘No, no, no, no,’” he said. “It’s already hard enough thinking about when I go to take Oscar to school; ‘Hey, what’s your grandad’s name?’”\n\n… and the tragic miscarriage of Rocky Ramsay\n\nIn 2016, Tana miscarried a child, Rocky, five months into her pregnancy. In 2023, she wrote about the loss on Instagram, saying, “It feels like yesterday.”\n\nShe has spoken publicly about the pregnancy loss she experienced in 2016 and encouraged people to discuss the often taboo topic of miscarriage. “I found it really hard when people would talk to me and not mention it because it was like it never happened,” she told Metro in 2020.\n\nIn an October 2021 Instagram post, Tana wrote about her family’s experience. Then, in June, she thanked her entire family in another Instagram post for their support throughout the hardship. “I couldn’t do this without my family, you are all everything to me,” she wrote.\n\n“A happy picture taken of us celebrating Megan’s 18th. I was just under 20 weeks pregnant,” Tana wrote. “Little did we know, a few days later I would be holding our little boy Rocky – born with a strong heartbeat, but too little to survive.”\n\n“Although it’s 7 years today, it still feels like yesterday,” she continued. “We all miss you everyday.”\n\nSpeaking on her husband’s role during the hardship, Tana told Metro, “Gordon was amazing, and he’s always been one to talk about everything, and he was very good at sort of talking it out of me and never making me feel that, ‘Oh, you know, maybe we shouldn’t talk about it.’”\n\nIn 2018, when they were 18, Holly and Jack ran the London Marathon to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital and in memory of Rocky, Hello! reported."
