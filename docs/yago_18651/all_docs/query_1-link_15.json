        "text": "Gordon Ramsay's wife Tana has shared the one thing that makes the pair argue, in a rare interview discussing all things marriage, home life and children. The 57-year-old chef and his long-term spouse have been married since 1996 and together they share six children, who range from eight months to 26 years old.\n\nThroughout their time together, the 49-year-old has often been left to fulfil parenting duties alone while Gordon works away on a number of projects from his restaurants to filming. While nowadays he is around more in the home, Tana said they would often clash when he was away working and would try and \"slot back in\" when he came back.\n\nShe spilled: \"I tell you what's interesting, whenever he has been away, the first few days of him being back is really hard.\n\n\"We always have an argument and it's usually because he has to slot back in. He'll sort of say to me, 'Am I even in this family? Because you know you've just done this that and the other, and you don't even ask'.\"\n\nRecalling her response, Tana said: \"I'm like, 'Well because I'm not used to asking, I don't need to ask you to do it, because you're not usually [here], you haven't been here for two weeks'.\"\n\nAddressing the situation further on the Postcards From Midlife podcast, she went on to admit it can be \"quite tricky\".\n\nWith him now being home more than ever before since lockdown, the mother-of-six went on to say the chef had been lapping up precious family time after missing out on such moments, due to his career.\n\n\"Having him around so much more, it does make it really lovely and I think that being older, both of us value those moments,\" she gushed.\n\nBack in November, the couple shocked the world by announcing that they has welcomed their six child Jesse after keeping her pregnancy a secret.\n\nAlongside a picture of the pair cradling their newborn at the time, he wrote on Instagram: \"What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!!\n\n\"One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls…. Done.\"\n\nHe later revealed that keeping their baby news secret was a cautious decision after losing their son Rocky during pregnancy at 20 weeks.\n\n“That was a significant moment in the family's lives,” he told People Magazine. \"And so we tread with caution this time around and we were blessed.\n\n\"Jesse's really helped bring everyone even closer. And then that level of responsibility again, is just even more exciting.”\n\nAddressing how life had been with a new baby in the home, Tana said things had somehow been \"calmer\" since his arrival.\n\nJust two months before, Gordon successfully covered up their pregnancy news by announcing that they were settled at five children, due to his age."
