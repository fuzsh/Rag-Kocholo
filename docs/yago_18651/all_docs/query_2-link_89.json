        "text": "Gordon Ramsay and his wife, Tana Ramsay, have a full nest again!\n\nDespite having four adult children who've already grown up, in addition to two much younger ones, the celebrity chef's family home is full to the brim, once again.\n\nTana—whom Ramsay married in 1996—recently opened up about all her kids moving back home, explaining that each of them are \"demanding.\"\n\nA busy life, indeed, the Tana Ramsay's Real Family Food cookbook author and Hell's Kitchen star are parents to Megan, 26, twins Jack and Holly, 24, Matilda “Tilly,\" 22, Oscar, 5, and Jesse, 8 months.\n\nWhile chatting with Lorraine Candy and Trish Halpin on the podcast Postcards from Midlife, she revealed that while the older ones have lived away from home at some point, \"they've all come back.\"\n\nRelated: Gordon Ramsay Shares Rare Photo of Young Sons in 'Precious Brotherhood Moment'\n\n“They left home, and they’ve all come back,” Tana said of her adult kids. “They moved out of our house three years ago to renovate.”\n\nShe shared that during the time that their London abode was having work completed, Megan and Holly were living with friends, and Jack was “away in the west country.” Meanwhile, Matilda never left, and has stayed at home with her little brothers Oscar and Jesse.\n\n“By the time we finished the project and moved back in three weeks ago, everyone has a bedroom again,” she added. “They’ve all moved home. Holly lives in Nottingham, but she’s always coming back to London.\"\n\nAs for her youngest co-sleeper, whom she welcomed in Nov. 2023, he can rest through pretty much anything—even his older siblings \"sneaking in\" during the wee hours of the morning.\n\n\"Luckily when someone’s sneaking in at three in the morning [and] the dog is barking like crazy, doors are slamming, he sleeps,” she explained. “They just have to revolve around him really.”\n\nNo matter the age range, though, the mom of six admitted that between \"fussy\" eaters and late-night creepers, \"All the kids are quite demanding, but I love it.\""
