However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nGordan Ramsay may be tough in the kitchen, but the MasterChef judge is a softie when it comes to his wife and children. So, who is Gordan Ramsay‚Äôs wife? Keep reading to learn more about the celebrity chef‚Äôs marriage.\n\nWho is Gordan Ramsay‚Äôs wife?\n\nGordan Ramsay has been married to his wife, Tana Ramsay, since 1996. The pair met at a New Year‚Äôs Eve party in London in the early ‚Äô90s, but Tana was engaged to someone else at the time and wasn‚Äôt interested in Gordon. In a 2008 profile of the famous chef for The Guardian, Tana recalled her first impression of Gordon and described him as a ‚Äúa complete arrogant arse.‚Äù\n\nAfter reconnecting a few years later, the pair began dating. They went on to tie the knot on Dec. 21, 1996. Just two years later, Gordon opened up his first solo restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, in Chelsea, London, with the financial backing of his father-in-law. By 2001, it had earned three Michelin stars, launching the chef into stardom.\n\nAt home, Gordon and Tana have their hands full, as the couple are the parents of six children. They welcomed their first child, a daughter named Megan, in 1998. Tana then gave birth to fraternal twins Holly and Jack in 2000, followed by daughter Matilda ‚ÄúTilly‚Äù in 2001. In 2016, Tana suffered a devastating miscarriage, which she has been very candid about.\n\n‚ÄúA happy picture taken of us celebrating Megan‚Äôs 18th, I was just under 20 weeks pregnant. Little did we know, a few days later I would be holding our little boy Rocky ‚Äì born with a strong heartbeat, but too little to survive,‚Äù she wrote on Instagram on the seventh anniversary of Rocky‚Äôs stillbirth. ‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs 7 years today, it still feels like yesterday. We all miss you everyday. We love you Rocky, forever in our hearts. I couldn‚Äôt do this without my family, you are all everything to me.‚Äù\n\nThe pair‚Äôs rainbow baby, a son named Oscar, was then born in 2019. A few years later, Gordon revealed that he and Tana had begun discussing baby no. 6. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not pregnant, but we are contemplating,‚Äù he told the Daily Mail in 2021. ‚ÄúWe discussed having another baby. I said it was a great idea,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúShe said: ‚ÄòWell, let‚Äôs start planning.‚Äô So I‚Äôm like: ‚ÄòOh my god, just pause for two seconds. I‚Äôm going to be the oldest dad at school, what‚Äôs going to happen on sports day?‚Äô ‚Äú\n\nIn December 2023, Gordon and Tana surprised fans with the news of news of son Jesse‚Äôs birth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a nerve wracking 9 months but we‚Äôve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle. Ramsay family definitely complete. Jesse James Ramsay we love you so much ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèº,‚Äù Tana wrote on Instagram.\n\nAside from being a super mom, Tana is passionate about cooking and fitness. In 2006, she published her first cookbook, Tana Ramsay‚Äôs Family Kitchen. She followed that up with five additional cookbooks, including Tana‚Äôs Kitchen Secrets and I Love to Bake. Prior to her career as a cookbook author, Tana worked as a teacher and she also owned a salon for 12 years.\n\nAs for how she and Gordon keep their nearly three-decade-long romance alive, Tana credits strong communication and spending quality time together, including going on hikes or walks. ‚ÄúWhat comes out on our walks and hikes on weekends is incredible,‚Äù she told PEOPLE in September 2023.‚ÄùIt sounds really clich√©, but as long as you‚Äôre friends, as long as you kind of like each other, it‚Äôs going to be good.‚Äù\n\nShe added that Gordon is a lot more sensitive than he appears on TV and has ‚Äúgained more empathy‚Äù as he‚Äôs gotten older. ‚ÄúHe was always the one riling everyone up. In that respect, he has not changed at all. It‚Äôs just gotten more obvious,‚Äù Tana explained. ‚ÄúBut at the same time, he is, believe it or not, incredibly sensitive‚Äîhe‚Äôs a crier.‚Äù\n\nThe mom of six continued: ‚ÄúI feel really lucky that I still get butterflies when we haven‚Äôt seen each other for a few weeks. I never want to take that for granted‚Äîeven with all these kids to worry about. We have a lot of fun.‚Äù"
