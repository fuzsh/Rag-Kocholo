        "text": "One of her daughters, Matilda, has been taking care of her parents and doing wonders as a cook in the kitchen. She started her own food show, Maltida and the Ramsay Bund, which airs on CBBC. Amazingly, her parents have appeared as guests on the show. In addition, Tana Ramsay is also a published author and has authored several cookbooks.\n\nHer husband – Gordon Ramsey\n\nAnyone who sees Gordon in Kitchen Nightmares or Hell’s Kitchen imagines a screaming, foul-mouthed perfectionist who is often barely satisfied with the cooking of others. However, to see him getting close to his wife is a perfect young man who cannot raise his voice. Well, Gordon and Tana’s roller coaster love is something that happened a long time ago.\n\nThe two first met when Tana Ramsay was just eighteen and was in a relationship with another chef. Due to their relationship, they were unable to feed their love flame and subsequently friends zoned out. When Gordon found out the lady was single again, he decided to take his shot. He played romantic on the first date and swept the young lady off her feet.\n\nHer early years in the relationship were filled with mixed feelings. The chef had a tight schedule while working in London and was often unable to see his baby. They worked something out and then made their perpetual commitments at a church in London in 1996.\n\nTana Ramsay’s children\n\nAfter their union, the couple tried their best to have children, but all in vain. Medical tests revealed that Gordon Ramsay had a low sperm count while his wife had polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nDuring treatment, the couple decided to try in vitro conception devices. Things went well when they welcomed their first daughter, Megan, in 1998. With more treatments and care, the couple subsequently welcomed a set of twins; Holly and Jack in 1999 and Maltida in 2002.\n\nSometime in 2016, the couple announced on The Late Night Show in May they were expecting their fifth child, just a month later learned the news that Tana Ramsay had miscarried at five months. The family was devastated and turned to friends for comfort. It almost cost their marriage, but the couple grew stronger and kept alive the love bond they formed two decades ago. Although their unborn son Rocky never met his family, he is forever in their hearts. In memory of him, his sister Megan ran the London Marathon in 2017.\n\nMore facts about Gordon Ramsay’s wife\n\n1. While many people think the Ramsay kids have their parents’ fortune for themselves, the bad-mouthed chef (Gordon) has publicly stated that his kids will get 25% off a down payment on a home.\n\n2. He also stated that he didn’t want to spoil his kids and decided to keep it real so they could make lemonades out of it when life gave them lemons.\n\n3. Tana Ramsay is quite active on social media. She supported the dream of her husband and children in every way and spent a lot of time with the family."
