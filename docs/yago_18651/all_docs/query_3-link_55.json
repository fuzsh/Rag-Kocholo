        "text": "Gordon Ramsay has been married for over 27 years!\n\nGordon married his wife Tana, a schoolteacher turned cookery writer and TV broadcaster, in 1996.\n\nThe couple first met in the early ’90s at a party, though Tana was dating someone else at the time.\n\nAccording to a 2008 profile story in The Guardian, Tana was in her early 20s when she first met him at a New Year’s Eve party. At the time, she was engaged to someone else and not interested in the chef, describing him as “a complete arrogant arse.”\n\nHowever, the two ran into each other again at a flat Tana shared with a mutual friend, where Gordon was storing his motorbike. He stopped by to pick it up, they hit it off and started dating, getting married in 1996.\n\nThey have five children together, including Tilly, 21, twins Jack Scott and Holly Anna, 23, and Megan, 25. Their youngest is Oscar, 4."
