        "text": "Tana Ramsay, author and wife of renowned British chef Gordon Ramsay, recently opened up about her pregnancies and in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure. The couple is parents to six children: Megan (26), twins Jack and Holly (24), Matilda “Tilly” (22), Oscar (5) and Jesse (8 months). During an episode of Postcards from Midlife with Lorraine Candy and Trish Halpin, the 49-year-old opened up about her experience through each pregnancy.\n\nSharing the details, Tana revealed that her first pregnancy with Megan was uncomplicated and smooth, calling it a “straightforward pregnancy.” However, Tana shared that her journey with the twins, Jack and Holly, was more challenging.\n\n“I had a thrombosis when I was pregnant and started bleeding at about 14 weeks, so that was very scary.” In contrast, her pregnancy with Tilly was her only “natural pregnancy” and she didn’t even realise that she was expecting until she was nearly four and a half months along.\n\n“Then Tilly came along, and she was my only natural pregnancy where I got pregnant and didn’t realize,” she explained to Candy and Halpin. “In fact, I was nearly four and a half months pregnant before I realised,” she said.\n\nTana Ramsay also experienced a miscarriage at 20 weeks in 2016. During the podcast, she mentioned how her pregnancy with Rocky seemed smooth initially leading her to believe that she could maintain her exercise routine. “Naturally, as you get older, you worry more. When I got pregnant with Rocky, that was all going swimmingly, and I thought ‘I’m going to exercise throughout,’ and then it all, of course, went terribly wrong,” she said.\n\n“Oscar’s pregnancy was actually – I had one or two scares, but it was very straightforward,” she said. “After you’ve had any kind of scare, it makes you paranoid…I was more careful; energy levels were good.”\n\nTana, who has Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, utilised IVF to conceive Oscar. She shared an endearing story of how Oscar and her youngest, Jesse, were connected even before Jesse’s birth in November 2023.\n\n“When I had IVF when I got pregnant with Oscar, they sort of checked everything then, went through the egg collection — Jesse is actually a frozen embryo from then. He was our little frosty embryo. He and Oscar are almost twins because they were the same collection,” she said.\n\nWhen asked about welcoming a baby at the age of 48, Tana said, “I think the important thing to say is it’s a bit like breastfeeding. No two is ever the same. I don’t think it’s necessarily always to do with age.”"
