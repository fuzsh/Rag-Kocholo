        "text": "On television, Gordon Ramsay is all F-bombs and yelling. But behind the scenes, his relationship with wife Tana is even more dramatic.\n\nWhen Gordon and Tana met, she was dating another man.\n\nBefore the swearing chef waltzed into her life, Tana was dating a different British cook named Tim — who happened to be a friend of Gordon's. After the two broke things off, Gordon swooped in, and he and Tana began a relationship.\n\nThey had to meet at odd hours of the night.\n\nThe life of a chef can be a hectic one, and Gordon's was no different. He couldn't get off work until late at night — or early in the morning — and Tana would wait up to spend time with him.\n\nThe Ramsays got married more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 1996 at a church in London's Chelsea neighborhood. Tana was just 21, and Gordon was 29.\n\nThe early years of their marriage were incredibly tough.\n\nAs they tried to get pregnant, Tana quickly discovered she had polycystic ovarian syndrome. Gordon also shared with James Cordon on The Late Late Show, \"I had a very low sperm count on the back of standing in the kitchen for that length of time close to the stove.\" The two struggled to conceive.\n\nThe couple turned to IVF.\n\nAfter going through in vitro, Tana and Gordon welcomed a baby girl, Megan, in 1998. Thanks to more treatments, they've also been able to have twins Holly and Jack in 1999 and Matilda in 2002.\n\nWith four grown kids, Gordon and Tana were able to conceive again.\n\nGordon announced the news on The Late Late Show in May of 2016. But only a month later, five months into the pregnancy, Tana suffered a miscarriage.\n\nThey leaned on another famous British couple after tragic news.\n\nGordon and Tana have been friends with David and Victoria Beckham for years, and they were part of their support system post-miscarriage. \"They came to see Tana and me immediately and showed their support, and that was mind-blowing,\" he said in an interview with the Daily Mail.\n\nGordon was accused of having a seven-year affair.\n\nIn 2008, a woman named Sarah Symonds claimed she'd been with Gordon on and off during his marriage. The so-called \"professional mistress\" had written a book a year earlier called Having an Affair? A Handbook for the Other Woman. Gordon called the whole ordeal gossip and denied it, and Tana stayed in the marriage.\n\nGordon and Tana's father had a messy split.\n\nThe two went into business together early on in Gordon's career. Tana's dad, Chris Hutcheson, helped Gordon fund his first restaurant, and the two worked together for nearly a dozen years. But in 2010, Gordon accused Hutcheson of embezzling more than one million pounds. After the initial riff, Hutcheson got a six-month jail sentence for hacking into Gordon's email.\n\nBut it only made the couple stronger.\n\n\"We had our family to protect, and you become territorial. We looked after each other. And it's actually brought us — me, Tana, and the children — closer than we've ever been before,\" Gordon told The Daily.\n\nBut Gordon and Tana know how to have fun together, too.\n\nTana's a fitness freak, and Gordon said triathlons are his \"release.\" The pair completed a half-Ironman together in England in 2015. They shared a special hug and kiss on the winners' podium.\n\nFollow Delish on Instagram."
