        "text": "Six months on since Gordon Ramsay and wife Tana became parents for the sixth time, the loved up gave fans a rare glimpse of the newest addition to the family on social media as they celebrate just how far he’d come in such a small amount of time.\n\nAs fans of the star will no doubt know, Gordon became a father for the sixth time, after his wife Tana, announced another adorable addition to the family on Saturday November 11. At the time, the 57 year old celebrity chef, took to Instagram to announce the safe arrival of his third son, Jesse James Ramsay, who weighed a healthy 7lbs 10oz and was affectionately described by his father as a “whopper.”\n\nNow, fast forward six months and the cheeky little chap is more adorable than ever, as Tana revealed on social media. Sharing a carousel of snaps of baby Jesse, the youngster couldn’t hide his cheeky grin as he beamed for the camera in a variety of stylish outfits.\n\nIn the first of several images shared by the star, Jesse was seated in his cot alongside a lamb plushie as he sported a practical but trendy green top and grey jogging bottoms. In another snap, the miniature chef-in-the-making grinned for the photo while donning a dinosaur printed jumper.\n\nA further slew of images also followed, showing Jesse’s progression overtime from his precious newborn beginnings through to his first bath and even some well deserved tummy time!\n\nCaptioning the images, Tana wrote: “6 months of you Jesse x adore every second x @gordongram x”. Following the update, fans were quick to comment on how much Jesse had changed with many fans praising the pint-size cutie. “Such a gorgeous boy - look at that smile xx,” gushed one fan.\n\nA second agreed, adding: “Gosh is growing so fast ! xx How gorgeous xx”. A third fan then commented: “He’s soooo beautiful. Just dreamy!!!” A fourth echoed: “Such a handsome little man,” alongside a string of heart emojis.\n\nAmong the comments, eagle-eyed fans also noticed one from footballing legend David Beckham, a close friend of the couple, who couldn’t help but see a clear resemblance to the couple’s oldest son, Jack Ramsay, as he said: “Little jack” alongside a pink heart emoji."
