        "text": "Gordon Ramsay and Tana Hutcheson (now Ramsay), have been married for 27 years since tying the knot in 1996. The lovebirds have since welcomed six beautiful children.\n\nThe couple first became parents with the birth of their eldest, Megan, in 1998. Tana then gave birth to twins, Jack and Holly, in 1999, Matilda (Tilly) in 2003, Oscar 2019, and their youngest, Jesse, in 2023.\n\nGordon and Tana kept her recent pregnancy with their son, Jesse, relatively secret and therefore it came as a major shock to fans when his birth was announced.\n\nGordon and Tana welcomed their sixth baby to the world in November 2023. In a very unexpected post, Gordon shared photos of his wife Tana and their newborn baby.\n\nJesse James Ramsay is yet another bundle of love added to the Ramsay family… the couple now have three boys and three girls.\n\nGordon shared adorable pictures of Tana with baby Jesse and captioned his post, “What an amazing birthday present please welcome Jesse James Ramsay, 7lbs 10oz whopper!! One more bundle of love to the Ramsay brigade!! 3 boys, 3 girls… Done.”\n\nHowever, Tana shared a much more heartbreaking reality on her own Instagram page. Tana shared that her pregnancy with Jesse had been a very worrying time for her after she had a miscarriage with her previous son, Rocky, five months into her pregnancy.\n\n“It’s been a nerve-wracking nine months but we’ve made it and we have been blessed with this little bundle,” Tana shared. Tana also revealed that this would be the couple’s last addition to the family… six children would be a hectic household!\n\nGordon and his wife welcomed their second-youngest child Oscar in 2019, and the couple were already in talks for baby number six back then.\n\nGordon spoke to The Mail’s You Magazine in 2021 and revealed that he and Tana had “discussed having another baby.”\n\n“I said it was a great idea. She said: ‘Well, let’s start planning’. So I’m like: ‘Oh my god, just pause for two seconds. I’m going to be the oldest dad at school, what’s going to happen on sports day?’,” he said.\n\n“But it’s something we’d still consider, because it’s been such a joy spending time with Oscar.”\n\nGordon went on to add that their youngest at the time had kept them “super-active” and made them “better parents”, and that while Tana wasn’t pregnant at the time, they were “contemplating”.\n\nTheir eldest daughter Megan was the first in the family to attend university, and she graduated from Oxford Brookes University in 2019 with a degree in psychology.\n\nFollowing in his older sister’s footsteps, Jack attended Dulwich College and then Exeter University, but in 2020, he joined the Royal Marines.\n\nHis twin sister Holly has been studying Fashion Design at university to become a model, and she’s also signed with agency Established Models.\n\nHer modelling profile said she is “using her platform to inspire others to create unique and relatable content whilst travelling between London and LA.”\n\nAs for Tilly, or Matilda, she seems to be the one who’s taken after her father the most, and she’s ready to show off her skills in the MasterChef kitchen.\n\nShe’s starred on a number of cooking shows and written a cookbook called Matilda & The Ramsay Bunch: Tilly’s Kitchen Takeover and has also appeared on Gordon’s shows MasterChef Junior and Hell’s Kitchen.\n\nKeep scrolling for more on Gordon Ramsay’s children…\n\nGordon and Tana’s two youngest, Oscar and Jesse seem to be best friends!\n\nIn March 2024, the two posted these adorable photos to their Instagram of the boys hanging out together.\n\nFor Mother’s Day 2024, both Gordon and Tana posted to Instagram to share some photos of all six of their children together.\n\n“Happy Mother’s Day to all, and thinking of those who find today challenging, sending so much love,” Tana penned. “I am feeling incredibly blessed to be a Mummy to these incredible people x.”\n\nIt’s fantastic to see all the children together in one photo!\n\nGordon shared this ADORABLE photo of baby Jesse in February 2024. He captioned the post, “Somebody’s not happy with his breakfast 😳! Jesse’s stare-downs are just like his dad 😂.”\n\nFans found this caption very humorous and took to the comments with some jokes… “He’s totally saying ‘It’s raw, Jennifer!!!’ 🤦🏼🤣,” one fan wrote.\n\nAnother fan wrote, “I guess you’ve met your match Gordon 😂😂.”\n\n“Ok so he looks just like you! The steak is RAW! What a sweet pea!💚” another added.\n\nTana shared this photo of Oscar and Jesse in February 2024. “This was so gorgeous I could not resist x,” she wrote.\n\nOscar is seen holding up his baby brother with a big smile on his face… big brother duties! Oscar is also tagged in the Instagram post; his account is managed by his two older sisters, Tilly and Holly."
