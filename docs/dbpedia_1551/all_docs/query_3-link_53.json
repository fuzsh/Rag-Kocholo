        "text": "McCarthey Athletic Center: Opened in 2004, the 6,000 seat arena, aka “The Kennel,” is well known as one of the nation’s toughest home court advantages. It is home to the Kennel Club, recognized as one of the best student sections in the country, and has been sold out for every men’s basketball game since the building opened.\n\nThe 148,000 square-foot facility includes state of the art locker rooms and coaching office suites for both the men’s and women’s basketball programs. There are two levels to the McCarthey Athletic Center. The event level, includes basketball locker rooms, media room, ticket office, four visiting team locker rooms, athletic administrative offices, the Herak Club Room and an indoor rowing room for the men’s and women’s rowing teams. The concourse level of McCarthey Athletic Center houses men’s and women’s basketball coaching offices, six luxury suites, and concessions stands.\n\nFunded entirely through donor support and installed by Daktronics in the fall of 2017, the video and sound in McCarthey received a major renovation. The upgrades and additions include a centerhung videoboard system with 21-foot by 12.5-foot rectangle screens facing the sidelines, 12.5-foot by 12.5-foot squares facing the baselines and a pair of 36-foot by 9-foot endwall boards that replaced the previously existing video screens and accompanying stat panels. The project keeps the McCarthey Athletic Center on the cutting edge of college athletics and will continue to draw fans into the excitement of the action.\n\nIn addition to hosting basketball events, including the NCAA Women’s Basketball Championships First & Second Rounds, the McCarthey Athletic Center has the ability to host non-athletic events such as concerts, banquets, graduations, meetings and receptions.\n\n“Two brothers from Salt Lake City, Utah came together on a project. That project helped unify a student body, a university and some would say an entire city.\n\nAfter the Gonzaga men's basketball team made its epic run to the Elite Eight, Phil and Tom McCarthey, pledged their support to Gonzaga Athletics by funding the building of the McCarthey Athletic Center.\n\n\"I was blown away,\" said Tom, who graduated from Gonzaga in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in English and is currently on the Board of Trustees. \"There was a sort of magic about [the new arena] and just the feeling about it brought something special to the school and to the whole city.\"\n\nTom knew the growth of the basketball program would result in the development of the University as a whole. Phil's reason to support for the project was a little different. Phil, who is also a 1974 graduate in English Literature and is a Trustee emeritus, was impressed by the way Gonzaga's athletic programs were co-curricular, not extra-curricular. The student-athletes at Gonzaga are a part of the University and are not above their fellow students. They are both students and athletes and the athletic department's focus, ultimately, is to nurture all aspects: mind, body and spirit.\n\n\"Our basketball players - men and women - are students from various backgrounds but they understand who and what Gonzaga is all about,\" Phil said. \"Gonzaga is a very special place. They believe in educating people the world needs most.\""
