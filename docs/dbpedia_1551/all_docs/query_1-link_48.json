        "text": "Accretion Disk: This refers to a flow of matter that is attracted to a celestial object by its gravity and is forced to move around it in an orbit due to the object’s rotational movement – as it does so, it forms a disk, called an accretion disk. This flow of matter can be detected at different wavelengths and plays a key role in important sources for gamma-ray astronomy, such as microquasars or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs).\n\nAbove: Animation of an AGN where one of the relativistic jets – emitted from the supermassive black hole’s vicinity – is shown, as well as accretion disk around the black hole. Credit: CTAO, animation “CTAO Science: Emission to Discovery.”\n\nActive Galactic Nucleus (AGN): This refers to galaxies with a supermassive black hole at their centre (some tens of billions of times more massive than our Sun!) that is eating up all the surrounding material, forms an accretion disk and becomes very luminous. Some AGN show two beams of particles (relativistic jets) moving almost at the speed of light.\n\nApastron: In a binary system, it refers to the point along the elliptical orbit of greatest separation between the two celestial objects.\n\nLeft: Scheme of the most important phases of a binary system, in this case composed of a massive star (blue) and a black hole (black dot). Credit: CTAO.\n\nAxion: Hypothetical particle that is thought to be the main component of dark matter.\n\nAzimuth: Coordinate used to define the position of an object in the sky as seen by a person on Earth, and is the angular distance in the horizontal plane from North to the object’s position in the sky, measured clockwise in degrees. It is part of the Horizontal Coordinate System, along with the Elevation. Unlike the Equatorial Coordinate System, an object’s position in the Horizontal Coordinate system changes with time, as the object rises, crosses the sky, and sets.\n\nCataclysmic Variable: Type of binary system composed of a white dwarf and a star that undergoes sudden increases in its luminosity.\n\nCharge: Physical property of matter, expressed through the force (attraction or repulsion) that it experiences when located in an electromagnetic field. It can be positive, like the charge in protons, or negative like in electrons. While particles with the same charge will be repulsed from one another, particles with opposite charges will be attracted to each other.\n\nCherenkov Light: Bluish light produced when particles move faster than light can travel in a particular medium, such as the air in our atmosphere, glass or water. As nothing can travel faster than light in a vacuum, Cherenkov radiation cannot be produced in a vacuum.\n\nExtended Air Shower created by a gamma ray. When the particles of the shower move faster than the speed of light in air, they produce the Cherenkov light that will eventually be detected by the telescopes on Earth’s surface. Credit: CTAO, animation “CTAO Science: Emission to Discovery.”\n\nCircumstellar medium (CSM): The matter, such as gas and dust, which orbits a star.\n\nCollection Area: Area from which light can be detected by a particular telescope on the ground or in space.\n\nColliding-Wind Binary: Type of binary system formed by two massive stars (more massive than our Sun) that emit strong stellar winds. These winds interact and produce light at different energies, including gamma rays.\n\nCompact Object: Collective name for white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes, given because they are the densest objects in the Universe. They are all outcomes of the death of stars.\n\nConfidence Level (C.L.): This refers to the probability that a particular parameter falls inside a certain range – in other words, how confident we are about a given result. In astronomy, a 95% C.L. is typically used for example in upper limits of the gamma-ray flux (have a look to the definition of Upper limit).\n\nCosmic Rays (CRs): Energetic particles coming from space, outside our atmosphere. Despite their name, they are not rays, but particles: their composition is 99% protons and helium nuclei, while the remaining 1% are electrons, heavier nuclei, etc.\n\nCosmic Voids: Most of the matter in space is clustered, such as in galaxies or galaxy clusters. On the largest scales of the Universe, these form filaments like the strands of a spider’s web or a soap-bubble foam. The cosmic voids refer to the vast space between those filaments.\n\nImage of the dark matter distribution from the Millennium Simulation. The filamentary structure of the Universe at large-scale is clearly visible, where every bright point represents a galaxy cluster and the space between the filaments corresponds to the cosmic voids. Credit: V. Springel, Max Planck Institute für Astrophysik.\n\nCosmos: Synonym of Universe that is typically used by astrophysicists to refer to the Universe as an orderly entity.\n\nCrab Units (C.U.): This unit is related to the Crab Nebula, which is a very luminous well-known gamma-ray source with the steadiest emission. Astrophysicists measure the flux of other sources in the same energy range in terms of the Crab Nebula’s flux (the Crab Nebula’s flux corresponds to 1 C.U.).\n\nCTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory): The CTAO will be the world’s largest and most powerful observatory for gamma-ray astronomy. With more than 60 telescopes located in the northern and southern hemispheres, the CTAO will explore the very high-energy Universe within an unprecedented energy range (20 GeV – 300 TeV) and accuracy. The Observatory will seek to understand the impact of high-energy particles in the evolution of cosmic systems, to gain insight into the most extreme sources in the Universe, such as black holes, or to explore frontiers in physics, such as dark matter. The CTAO will be the first observatory of its kind to operate as an open, proposal-driven observatory providing public access to its high-level science data and software products, making the potential for discoveries limitless.\n\nCTAO Central Organisation: The preparations for the design and implementation of the CTAO is a global initiative that is supported financially by the Shareholders and Associate Members of the CTAO Central Organisation. The headquarters in Bologna, Italy, is the main hub for administration and the overall project and systems engineering activities, while the computing efforts are centralized at the Science Data Management Centre in Zeuthen, Germany. The CTAO’s activities related to infrastructure development and preparations for construction take place at the Observatory’s two array sites in La Palma, Spain, and Paranal, Chile.\n\nCTAO Consortium: The CTAO Consortium (previously known as CTAC) has developed and detailed the CTAO’s key science goals (see Science with the Cherenkov Telescope Array) and will be responsible for the science analysis and publication of scientific results of the Key Science Projects, ensuring that the CTAO produces legacy data sets and data products for use by the entire community.\n\nCTAO-North: The CTAO’s northern hemisphere array or CTAO-North is located on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands (Spain) at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias’ (IAC’s) Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos in Villa de Garafía . At 2,200 metres in altitude and nestled on the slope below the rim of an extinct volcanic crater, the site currently hosts a prototype of one of the CTAO’s Large-Sized Telescopes, the LST-1. In addition to the telescope array, the CTAO will have an operations building and calibration devices on site, as well as an office at sea level. The sum of these facilities is known as the “Northern Station.”\n\nCTAO-South: CTAO’s southern hemisphere array or CTAO-South is located less than 10 km southeast of the European Southern Observatory’s (ESO’s) existing Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile. The telescope array along with the support facilities located in Santiago, Chile, is known as the “Southern Station.”\n\nEffective Time: Total time that a source is observed and that leads to useful data (for example, the total time after removing data taken under poor weather conditions). Not to be confused with Observational Time.\n\nElectric Field: Electric fields are created by the presence of charged particles, and create an electrical force – attraction or repulsion between matter with charge.\n\nElectromagnetic Field: When they were first discovered, it was thought that electrical and magnetic fields were distinct, but in fact we now know that electric and magnetic fields are tangled, so we refer to an electromagnetic field. It propagates as a wave, called an electromagnetic wave or electromagnetic radiation (which we can see as light).\n\nFind more information about the electric field, the magnetic field and the electromagnetic field, in these videos by Khan Academy.\n\nElectromagnetic Spectrum: Classification of electromagnetic radiation (light) according to its energy, frequency or wavelength. From less to more energetic, the spectrum spans from radio waves, microwaves, infrared and visible light, then passing through ultraviolet, X-rays and finally gamma rays.\n\nElectronvolt (eV): Unit of energy commonly used in astroparticle physics. Visible light has an energy of around 1 eV, but gamma rays are much more energetic. The gamma rays that the CTAO will observe have energies from billions (gigaelectronvolts, GeV) to trillions (hundreds of teraelectronvolts, TeV) the energy of the visible light!\n\nPrefixes used in different physics units, for example with energy: 1 GeV (Gigaelectronvolt) = 109 eV (electronvolts).\n\nElevation: Coordinate used to define the position of an object in the sky as seen by a person on Earth, and is the vertical angular distance from the horizon to the object’s position in the sky, measured in degrees. It is part of the Horizontal Coordinate System, along with the Azimuth. Unlike the Equatorial Coordinate System, an object’s position in the Horizontal Coordinate system changes with time, as the object rises, crosses the sky, and sets.\n\nEnergy: Property that all objects in the Universe have, and it can be understood as the capability to perform an activity. Depending on the activity itself, the energy can be divided into different types, for example: kinetic energy (property of moving objects), rotational energy (property of rotating objects) or thermal energy (property of objects with temperatures above absolute zero). Energy is transferred from one object to another, sometimes changing type, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, only interchanged or transferred. One example of this is electrical energy being transformed into light and heat when a lightbulb is switched on.\n\nESCAPE: Alliance formed by several research infrastructures and organisations across astronomy, astrophysics, particle and nuclear physics, including the CTAO, to work together on common challenges to find solutions in the areas of large-scale data management, data processing and analysis in support for open data and research. ESCAPE is one of the five science clusters that exist as part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).\n\nExtensive Air Shower (EAS): Cascade of particles originating from the interaction of a cosmic or gamma ray with the molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere. When the shower is created by a gamma ray, it is called an electromagnetic cascade.\n\nExtragalactic Background Light (EBL): Accumulated light in our Universe coming from different objects that spans almost all energies. This is important to gamma-ray astronomy because the EBL can interact with gamma rays (a process known as “pair production”), reducing the amount of gamma rays – especially those at the highest energies – that make it to Earth.\n\nDid you know…?\n\nThe light’s energy, frequency and wavelength are related one to another. The energy and frequency are directly proportional, which means that the higher the energy, the higher the frequency too. On the contrary, the wavelength is inversely proportional to the other two features: the electromagnetic radiation (light) with longer wavelength, will be less energetic and will have lower frequency. Gamma rays have very high energy and so, high frequency and short wavelength. Since they are all correlated… The electromagnetic spectrum can be shown using any of these three light’s properties!\n\nGalactic Centre (GC): It refers to the centre of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, which hosts a supermassive black hole named Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*).\n\nGalactic Latitude (b): Coordinate used to define the position of an object in our Galaxy. It is measured in degrees and is the angle from the Galactic Centre to the object’s position in the sky, taken in an easterly direction along the Galactic Plane. It is part of the Galactic Coordinate System, along with the Galactic Longitude.\n\nGalactic Longitude (l): Coordinate used to define the position of an object in our Galaxy. It is measured in degrees and is the angle from the Galactic Plane to the object’s position in the sky: it is positive to the north and negative to the south. It is part of the Galactic Coordinate System, along with the Galactic Latitude.\n\nGalactic Plane: This is the region in which most of the matter lies in our Galaxy, which is formed of a spherical central region surrounded by a disk of material containing spiral “arms.”\n\nOur Galaxy, the Milky Way, from different perspectives. Credit: ESO, S. Brunier (picture) / NASA (right top artistic illustration)\n\nGalaxy: A group of billions of stars, planets, dust and different objects bound together by the force of gravity. Our Galaxy is called the Milky Way.\n\nGalaxy Cluster: A group of hundreds of galaxies held together by gravity.\n\nGamma-Ray Binary: Binary system composed of a star and a compact object that emits most of its light in the gamma-ray energy range.\n\nGamma-Ray Burst (GRB): Extremely energetic explosions and the brightest events in our Universe! According to their duration, GRBs can be classified as “short” (if this initial prompt phase lasts less than a couple of seconds) or “long” (if it lasts more, up to hundreds or even thousands of seconds). The short bursts are produced by colliding neutron stars, and the most of the long bursts are thought to be created by particularly energetic supernova explosions, sometimes called “hypernovae.\n\nGamma Ray: The most energetic light in the Universe! Gamma rays are the product of the most extreme events, such as exploding stars, due to the acceleration of cosmic particles or their interaction with the surrounding medium. Gamma rays cover a vast energy range, from approximately ~1 MeV and without a well-defined upper limit. They can be classified according to their energy range (see table below). So far, only gamma rays from the first three energy ranges have been detected, but scientists expect to see gamma rays with energies greater than hundreds TeV, considering the cosmic particle energies. As gamma rays cover a huge energy range – greater than that between microwaves and X-rays for example – we need to use different techniques to observe different energies. Three types of instruments can be used to cover high (HE) and very high (VHE) regimes: satellites (for MeV and GeV energies), Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (for GeV and TeV energies) and Water Cherenkov detectors (above hundreds GeV). The Earth’s atmosphere prevents gamma rays from reaching the ground and hence, the latter two types of instruments perform indirect observations of gamma rays. In the case of IACTs, the information about gamma rays is obtained through the detection of Cherenkov light produced in the Extensive Air Shower (EAS). It is worth mentioning that the CTAO, thanks to its three types of telescopes (LST, MST and SST), will be able to observe uncharted energies (up to 300 TeV) with unprecedented precision, opening an entirely new window to the most extreme Universe.\n\nClassification of the energy domain in gamma-ray astronomy. Energy ranges are approximate and might slightly differ from one publication to another.\n\nDid you know…?\n\nThe noun and adjective of gamma rays are spelled differently. The noun is spelled as gamma rays (for example, “gamma rays are very energetic”), while the adjective is written as gamma-ray (for example, “gamma-ray astronomy is a young field”).\n\nGlobular Cluster: Densely-packed, spherical-shaped group of stars that orbits a galaxy.\n\nGravitational Waves: Disturbances or “ripples” in space-time due to extremely powerful events, such as the merger of two black holes. Gravitational waves propagate through space-time at the speed of light like the waves caused by a drop of water into a pool of water.\n\nGravity: Fundamental force that keeps matter together on large scales.\n\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory: Observatory for neutrinos located in the Antarctic and formed by 5000 detectors situated under ground level inside 1 km² of ice.\n\nImaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT): Instrument used on Earth to observe gamma rays indirectly. The telescope detects Cherenkov light, produced by the interaction of a gamma ray with Earth’s atmosphere. This light is then used to gain information about the gamma ray that produced it, such as its point of origin or its energy.\n\nIn-Kind Contributor (IKC): An In-Kind Contribution (IKC) teams is that who provide goods and services for the software and hardware development and construction of the CTAO. Of the many IKC teams involved in the Observatory, the three telescope collaborations are the most substantial: LST Collaboration, MST Collaboration and SST Collaboration.\n\nInferior Conjunction: A binary system is in conjunction when the celestial objects that composed it are aligned as seen from Earth. The inferior conjunction means that one of the objects (typically the compact object, like a black hole) is in front of the companion according to our line of sight.\n\nInfrared light or Infrared Radiation (IR): A type of light included in the electromagnetic spectrum that is less energetic than visible light. Most of the radiation emitted by bodies at room temperature (~27 °C) falls into the infrared range, including human bodies! Sub-classifications in the range include: Near-Infrared (NIR) and Far-Infrared (FIR).\n\nInstrument Response Function (IRF): Group of characteristics that define the behavior of an instrument, such a Cherenkov telescope, and which must be considered during data analysis (one of them is, for example, the collection area of the instrument).\n\nIntegral Flux: The amount of light per area and time integrated over a certain energy range.\n\nIntergalactic magnetic field (IGMF): Magnetic field that spreads between galaxies.\n\nInterstellar magnetic field (ISMF): Magnetic field that spreads between stars in a galaxy.\n\nDid you know…?\n\nGiven that cosmic rays are charged particles (such as electrons and protons), they get randomly deflected in their travel through space by the IGMF and ISMF. That is why by observing directly cosmic rays, scientists are not able to identify the origin source from which they originate. To understand cosmic-ray sources, we need to study non-charged messengers produced by cosmic-ray interactions within the source, such as neutrinos and, of course, gamma rays! Nevertheless, the study of cosmic rays can lead to important information, such as their abundance in the Universe.\n\nInterstellar Medium (ISM): All the matter and light that lie between the stars in a galaxy.\n\nInverse Compton (IC): Physical process in which electrons moving close to the speed of light transfer most of their energy to low-energy photons, turning them into gamma rays.\n\nLarge-Sized Telescope (LST): The LST is the biggest of the three classes of telescopes that will compose the CTAO. It has a 23-m diameter dish, corresponding to a 400 square metres reflective area, composed of almost 200 segmented mirrors. Although it stands 45 metres tall and weighs around 100 tonnes, it is extremely nimble, with the ability to re-position within 20 seconds. Four LSTs will be built at the centre of the northern hemisphere array. The LSTs are ideal for catching gamma rays at the low edge of the CTAO energy range, and are responsible for CTAO sensitivity between 20 and 150 GeV.\n\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC): Small galaxy that orbits the Milky Way and that hosts important objects for gamma-ray astronomy as well as dense regions with molecular clouds. Due to its proximity and content, it is a very interesting target to search for very high-energy gamma-ray emitters.\n\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO): Instrument dedicated to the observation of gravitational waves. There are two observatories in the United States: LIGO Livingston Observatory (in Louisiana) and LIGO Hanford Observatory (Washington).\n\nLeptons: Elementary particles (such as electrons) that are not affected by the strong nuclear force. In gamma-ray astronomy, when scientists talk about “leptonic gamma-ray emission,” they refer to emissions produced by the interaction of this type of particles.\n\nLight: Photons or waves with a certain energy or frequency, and synonymous with electromagnetic radiation. Sometimes this term is used to describe only “visible light” to distinguish it from other less or more energetic electromagnetic radiation.\n\nLight Curve: This is a plot that represents the flux of a source as a function of time. Very useful in order to study different behaviors over time, such as flares.\n\nLight Year: This is a unit of astronomical distance and corresponds to the distance traveled by light in space in one year. One light year is equivalent to ~9.5 trillion kilometers!\n\nLine of Sight: This is the straight line between the observer (for example, someone on Earth) and what they are looking at (for example, the Crab Nebula in the sky).\n\nLorentz Invariance Violation (LIV): The so-called Lorentz invariance tells us that the laws of the physics are invariant under transformation between two coordinate frames moving both at constant velocity. In other words, two people in different circumstances, moving at the same velocity one from another, would observe the laws of physics behaving equally. This concept is related to Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity and is one of the principles of modern physics… but could this principle be violated? Some theories predict that photons could be dispersed in space in different ways depending on their energy, which would imply a LIV. In order to test these ideas, very specific sources must be observed, which CTAO is planning to do!\n\nLuminosity: Intrinsic characteristic of a celestial object that represents the amount of energy per time unit (for example, eV/second) that the object emits.\n\nMagnetic Field: Distribution of the magnetic force – attraction or repulsion of objects with the property of magnetism – in space-time. A magnetic field is created by the flow of charged particles.\n\nMagnetism: Intrinsic property of some objects expressed through their interaction with magnetic fields that can change the direction of their movement. This property makes objects act as “magnets.”\n\nMagnetosphere: Region around a celestial object dominated by its magnetic field.\n\nMajor Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC): Two Cherenkov telescopes located in La Palma, Spain, for the study of very high-energy gamma rays (from ~30 GeV up to 100 TeV) and inaugurated in 2003.\n\nMedium-Sized Telescope (MST): The MST is the second largest telescope among the three classes of telescope that will compose the CTAO. It has a ~12-m diameter dish and weights around 80 tons. One of its main features is its large field of view (~ 8 degrees), which will allow MSTs to perform fast surveys of the night sky. Nine MSTs are planned for the CTAO-North and 14 for CTAO-South. The MSTs are ideal for catching gamma rays in the middle of the CTAO’s energy range, and they are responsible for the CTAO sensitivity between 150 GeV and 5 TeV.\n\nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU): Agreement between different parties that includes the common line of action. It can also include the rights, requirements or responsibilities of each party.\n\nMicroquasar: System composed of a star and a black hole or neutron star. The latter gobbles up the matter of the star and can produce, on occasion, jets of radiation and particles moving almost at the speed of light!\n\nDid you know…?\n\nOne of the most famous microquasars is Cygnus X-1, which caused Stephen Hawking to lose a bet with Kip Thorne. Do you know the story?\n\nMicrowave: Low-energy radiation of the electromagnetic spectrum (just above radio waves). This is extensively used in modern technology, including to warm up your food!\n\nMonte Carlo (MC): Simulation of gamma or cosmic rays that is extremely important in gamma-ray astronomy. Monte Carlo simulations are needed to analyze data taken by telescopes (for example, with Cherenkov telescopes like those used by CTAO), which describe the simulated development of particle showers initiated by gamma or cosmic rays in our atmosphere, as well as the response of the telescope to those showers. They are named after the Monte Carlo casino in Monaco, since performing Monte Carlo simulations is like rolling the dice many, many times in a game of chance.\n\nMulti-Messenger Astronomy: This is a sub-field in astronomy based on the observation of the Universe with instruments that detect different cosmic “messengers.” There are four possible messengers that are used at present: electromagnetic radiation (at its different energies, such as gamma rays), cosmic rays, neutrinos and gravitational waves. Each messenger can provide different information from the same source.\n\nMulti-Wavelength Astronomy: This is a sub-field in astronomy based on the observations among different instruments that can detect different energy ranges of electromagnetic radiation. For example, observing a microquasar at the same time with radio observatories, infrared telescopes, X-ray satellites and gamma-ray Cherenkov telescopes can provide valuable information on the state of the source.\n\nPair Production: Physical process in which a high-energy photon (such as a gamma ray) interacts with another low-energy photon (for example, an infrared photon) giving rise to the creation of an electron and a positron. In very high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, we say that this process is responsible for “gamma-ray absorption,” which basically ends up decreasing the number of gamma rays that reach Earth.\n\nParsec (pc): Unit of length typically used in astronomy to describe huge distances. One parsec is equivalent to 3.26 light-years or 30 trillion km!\n\nParticle Cascade or Particle Shower: Continue production of particles initiated by the interaction of a cosmic ray or a gamma ray with the molecule of a medium, such as air or water, and which ends when the particles reach a critical energy from which they cannot generate other particles. In the case of air, it is used as a synonym for extensive air cascade or EAS.\n\nPeriastron: In a binary system, it refers to the point along the elliptical orbit of closest approach between the two celestial objects.\n\nPeVatron: It refers to a cosmic source capable of accelerating particles up to PeV (Petaelectronvolts, 1015 eV) energies. Gamma-ray emission from this type of sources, at energies of 100 TeV and above, is expected from the interaction of such high-energy particles.\n\nPhotomultiplier tube (PMT): Electronic device that transforms light into electrical pulses that can be analyzed. Used in several Cherenkov telescopes’ cameras.\n\nPhoton: Elementary particle that forms all electromagnetic radiation (the light).\n\nPion: Type of subatomic particle. There are three types according to their charge: positive pions (π +), negative pions (π −) and neutral pions (π 0).\n\nPion Decay: Over time, the pions can use their energy in creating new particles, which means they get transformed (a process named particle decay). This is an important physical process in astronomy, because charged pions give rise to neutrinos (among other particles), while neutral pions produce gamma rays.\n\nPoint Spread Function (PSF): This is the radius of a circle that contains a certain percentage of light emitted by a point source observed by an instrument. In very high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, if you read that a certain Cherenkov telescope has, for example, a PSF of 0.10 degrees above some energy, it means that most of the gamma rays (normally referred to 68% or 95%) from a point source at those energies, will be collected into a region of the sky with 0.10 degrees radius. Thus, the PSF is used to describe the angular resolution of the telescope: a point source does not have to be seen strictly as a point, but is seen as a “blur” dot of radius equal to the PSF (no object with smaller extension than the PSF will be resolved by the instrument).\n\nDid you know…?\n\nThe smaller the PSF of an instrument the better. This is because with a smaller PSF, an instrument can disentangle smaller and finer details in the sky… so more information!\n\nPositron: Antiparticle of the electron, which means that it has the same characteristics but with opposite charge (in this case, positive).\n\nProton: Subatomic particle with positive charge.\n\nPulsar: Extremely rapidly rotating and magnetized neutron star. It emits two beams of radiation, which can be detected from the radio up to even the gamma-ray band. However, it is like a cosmic lighthouse – it is only visible when passing through our line of sight!\n\nArtistic animation of a pulsar, where its beams of light stand out. Credit: NASA\n\nPulsar Wind: Flow of particles emitted by pulsars into space from all round the pulsar (not to be mixed up with their light beams!).\n\nPulsar Wind Nebula (PWN): Astrophysical object produced when particles from the pulsar wind interact with the surrounding medium. This interaction gives rise to radiation, which can reach gamma-ray energies.\n\nSatellite: Instrument placed in orbit for different purposes, such as the observation of Earth or outer space, communication and navigation goals, etc. Satellites for the observation of outer space are also called space satellites or space observatories.\n\nSensitivity: Minimum amount of light that an instrument can reliably detect. Its value can differ depending on the energy range and so, instruments can show different sensitivity values for each energy range, which is represented in a “sensitivity curve.”\n\nThe CTAO-North and CTAO-South sensitivities compared to currently operative instruments. The plot shows, from one side, the different sensitivity vales for each energy range (which leads to a sensitivity curve) and, from the other side, that the CTAO will have much better sensitivity than any other instrument with same or even less observation time.\n\nDid you know…?\n\nThe lower the sensitivity’s value, the better the instrument! For example, if we have two instruments, one with a sensitivity of 0.6 C.U. (have a look to the definition of Crab Units) and another with 0.4 C.U. for a certain energy range, it means that the first instrument will be able to detect sources whose flux is above 0.6 C.U., while the second will do so for sources with flux already above 0.4 C.U. So the second can detect even weaker sources, which is definitely better.\n\nSilicon Photomultiplier (SiPM): Device that detects light and converts it into an electrical signal to analyze it. An alternative to the photomultiplier tubes used in some CTAO cameras.\n\nSKAO: The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) is a next-generation radio astronomy-driven Big Data facility that will revolutionise the understanding of the Universe at the radio wavelengths.\n\nSmall-Sized Telescope (SST): The SST is the smallest telescope among the three classes of telescope that will compose the CTAO, with a ~4-m diameter primary dish. It is a dual-mirror telescope, a segmented primary mirror and a monolithic secondary one. A total of 37 SSTs are planned only for the CTAO-South array. The SSTs are ideal for catching gamma rays at the highest energies of CTAO’s energy range, and they are in charge of the CTAO sensitivity between 5 and 300 TeV.\n\nSpace: Existing expanse between the objects in the Universe. Although almost entirely empty, it is not completely so! Between bodies in the Cosmos there are cosmic rays, electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, etc.\n\nSpectral Energy Distribution (SED): Relative contribution of each wavelength to the total energy released by the source.\n\nSpeed of Light (c): It typically refers to the velocity of the light in a vacuum, which is the highest possible speed in the Universe: 300,000 km/s! Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, but in other mediums (like the air, glass or water), the light slows down and high-energy particles can exceed the velocity of light in those mediums – this is the principle of Cherenkov light. Speed of light in a vacuum is usually denoted with the letter c, and the velocity of particles can be given with respect to it (for example, 0.95c corresponds to 95% of the speed of light).\n\nStar-Forming Region: Regions of dense material in space containing molecular clouds where the formation of stars is likely to occur.\n\nSteady (source): Refers to a celestial object with emission that does not change significantly over time.\n\nStellar Wind: Flow of matter ejected from the atmosphere of a star.\n\nSuperior Conjunction: A binary system is in conjunction when the celestial objects that composed it are aligned as seen from Earth. The superior conjunction means that one of the objects (typically the compact object, like a black hole) is behind the companion according to our line of sight.\n\nSupermassive Black Hole: A black hole with a mass several billion times bigger than the Sun. They are found at the centres of galaxies, including the Milky Way. Astronomers are not sure exactly how they are formed.\n\nSupernova (SN): Powerful explosion that happens upon the death of a massive star. One of the most energetic events in the Universe – in one moment, it can release more energy than the energy released by our Sun over its entire life!\n\nSupernova Remnant (SNR): Astrophysical object produced by the interaction of the matter expelled in a supernova explosion with the matter of the surrounding medium. This interaction gives rise to light, which can reach gamma-ray energies. They are very important sources in very high-energy astrophysics, because SNRs are expected to accelerate particles up to PeV energies, it means they are thought to be PeVatrons.\n\nSynchrotron: Physical process in which a charged particle (like an electron) moving at relativistic speeds emits light due to the presence of a magnetic field.\n\nSynchrotron Self Compton (SSC): This is Inverse Compton radiation in which the low-energy photon that hits the electron originates from a Synchrotron process from the same electron population."
