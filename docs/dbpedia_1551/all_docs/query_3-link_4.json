        "text": "Instructions for Authors (Autorenhinweise)\n\nTypes of Papers\n\nOriginal article:Original articles are full-length reports of original research. They should contain no more than 3,000 words, excluding references, and must be accompanied by an abstract of 200 words or less.\n\nReview article:Review articles should conform to the submission requirements of full length Original articles.\n\nLetter to the editor: Letters comment on papers previously published in this journal. Criticism of published work must be objective and supported by experimental data, and any such letter accepted for publication will be shown to the author(s) of the original paper, who will be invited to submit a reply for publication in the same issue.\n\nEditorial procedure\n\nAll manuscripts submitted to the journal are subject to a peer review process.\n\nManuscript Submission\n\nManuscript Submission\n\nSubmission of a manuscript implies: that the work described has not been published before; that it is not under consideration for publication anywhere else; that its publication has been approved by all co-authors, if any, as well as by the responsible authorities – tacitly or explicitly – at the institute where the work has been carried out. The publisher will not be held legally responsible should there be any claims for compensation.\n\nPermissions\n\nAuthors wishing to include figures, tables, or text passages that have already been published elsewhere are required to obtain permission from the copyright owner(s) for both the print and online format and to include evidence that such permission has been granted when submitting their papers. Any material received without such evidence will be assumed to originate from the authors.\n\nOnline Submission\n\nPlease follow the hyperlink “Submit manuscript” and upload all of your manuscript files following the instructions given on the screen.\n\nSource Files\n\nPlease ensure you provide all relevant editable source files at every submission and revision. Failing to submit a complete set of editable source files will result in your article not being considered for review. For your manuscript text please always submit in common word processing formats such as .docx or LaTeX.\n\nTitle Page\n\nPlease make sure your title page contains the following information.\n\nTitle\n\nThe title should be concise and informative.\n\nAuthor information\n\nThe name(s) of the author(s)\n\nThe affiliation(s) of the author(s), i.e. institution, (department), city, (state), country\n\nA clear indication and an active e-mail address of the corresponding author\n\nIf available, the 16-digit ORCID of the author(s)\n\nIf address information is provided with the affiliation(s) it will also be published.\n\nFor authors that are (temporarily) unaffiliated we will only capture their city and country of residence, not their e-mail address unless specifically requested.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, do not currently satisfy our authorship criteria. Notably an attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, which cannot be effectively applied to LLMs. Use of an LLM should be properly documented in the Methods section (and if a Methods section is not available, in a suitable alternative part) of the manuscript.\n\nAbstract\n\nPlease provide an abstract of 150 to 250 words. The abstract should not contain any undefined abbreviations or unspecified references.\n\nFor life science journals only (when applicable)\n\nTrial registration number and date of registration for prospectively registered trials\n\nTrial registration number and date of registration, followed by “retrospectively registered”, for retrospectively registered trials\n\nKeywords\n\nPlease provide 4 to 6 keywords which can be used for indexing purposes.\n\nStatements and Declarations\n\nThe following statements should be included under the heading \"Statements and Declarations\" for inclusion in the published paper. Please note that submissions that do not include relevant declarations will be returned as incomplete.\n\nCompeting Interests: Authors are required to disclose financial or non-financial interests that are directly or indirectly related to the work submitted for publication. Please refer to “Competing Interests and Funding” below for more information on how to complete this section.\n\nPlease see the relevant sections in the submission guidelines for further information as well as various examples of wording. Please revise/customize the sample statements according to your own needs.\n\nText\n\nText Formatting\n\nManuscripts should be submitted in Word.\n\nUse a normal, plain font (e.g., 10-point Times Roman) for text.\n\nUse italics for emphasis.\n\nUse the automatic page numbering function to number the pages.\n\nDo not use field functions.\n\nUse tab stops or other commands for indents, not the space bar.\n\nUse the table function, not spreadsheets, to make tables.\n\nUse the equation editor or MathType for equations.\n\nSave your file in docx format (Word 2007 or higher) or doc format (older Word versions).\n\nHeadings\n\nPlease use no more than three levels of displayed headings.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAbbreviations should be defined at first mention and used consistently thereafter.\n\nFootnotes\n\nFootnotes can be used to give additional information, which may include the citation of a reference included in the reference list. They should not consist solely of a reference citation, and they should never include the bibliographic details of a reference. They should also not contain any figures or tables.\n\nFootnotes to the text are numbered consecutively; those to tables should be indicated by superscript lower-case letters (or asterisks for significance values and other statistical data). Footnotes to the title or the authors of the article are not given reference symbols.\n\nAlways use footnotes instead of endnotes.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAcknowledgments of people, grants, funds, etc. should be placed in a separate section on the title page. The names of funding organizations should be written in full.\n\nReferences\n\nCitation\n\nReference citations in the text should be identified by numbers in square brackets. Some examples:\n\n1. Negotiation research spans many disciplines [3].\n\n2. This result was later contradicted by Becker and Seligman [5].\n\n3. This effect has been widely studied [1-3, 7].\n\nReference list\n\nThe list of references should only include works that are cited in the text and that have been published or accepted for publication. Personal communications and unpublished works should only be mentioned in the text.\n\nThe entries in the list should be numbered consecutively.\n\nIf available, please always include DOIs as full DOI links in your reference list (e.g. “https://doi.org/abc”).\n\nJournal article\n\nGamelin FX, Baquet G, Berthoin S, Thevenet D, Nourry C, Nottin S, Bosquet L (2009) Effect of high intensity intermittent training on heart rate variability in prepubescent children.

MS Office files are also acceptable.\n\nVector graphics containing fonts must have the fonts embedded in the files.\n\nName your figure files with \"Fig\" and the figure number, e.g., Fig1.eps.\n\nLine Art\n\nDefinition: Black and white graphic with no shading.\n\nDo not use faint lines and/or lettering and check that all lines and lettering within the figures are legible at final size.\n\nAll lines should be at least 0.1 mm (0.3 pt) wide.\n\nScanned line drawings and line drawings in bitmap format should have a minimum resolution of 1200 dpi.\n\nVector graphics containing fonts must have the fonts embedded in the files.\n\nHalftone Art\n\nDefinition: Photographs, drawings, or paintings with fine shading, etc.\n\nIf any magnification is used in the photographs, indicate this by using scale bars within the figures themselves.\n\nHalftones should have a minimum resolution of 300 dpi.\n\nCombination Art\n\nDefinition: a combination of halftone and line art, e.g., halftones containing line drawing, extensive lettering, color diagrams, etc.\n\nCombination artwork should have a minimum resolution of 600 dpi.\n\nColor Art\n\nColor art is free of charge for print and online publication.\n\nColor illustrations should be submitted as RGB.\n\nFigure Lettering\n\nTo add lettering, it is best to use Helvetica or Arial (sans serif fonts).\n\nKeep lettering consistently sized throughout your final-sized artwork, usually about 2–3 mm (8–12 pt).\n\nVariance of type size within an illustration should be minimal, e.g., do not use 8-pt type on an axis and 20-pt type for the axis label.\n\nAvoid effects such as shading, outline letters, etc.\n\nDo not include titles or captions within your illustrations.\n\nFigure Numbering\n\nAll figures are to be numbered using Arabic numerals.\n\nFigures should always be cited in text in consecutive numerical order.\n\nFigure parts should be denoted by lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.).\n\nIf an appendix appears in your article and it contains one or more figures, continue the consecutive numbering of the main text. Do not number the appendix figures, \"A1, A2, A3, etc.\" Figures in online appendices [Supplementary Information (SI)] should, however, be numbered separately.\n\nFigure Captions\n\nEach figure should have a concise caption describing accurately what the figure depicts. Include the captions in the text file of the manuscript, not in the figure file.\n\nFigure captions begin with the term Fig. in bold type, followed by the figure number, also in bold type.\n\nNo punctuation is to be included after the number, nor is any punctuation to be placed at the end of the caption.\n\nIdentify all elements found in the figure in the figure caption; and use boxes, circles, etc., as coordinate points in graphs.\n\nIdentify previously published material by giving the original source in the form of a reference citation at the end of the figure caption.\n\nFigure Placement and Size\n\nFigures should be submitted within the body of the text. Only if the file size of the manuscript causes problems in uploading it, the large figures should be submitted separately from the text.\n\nWhen preparing your figures, size figures to fit in the column width.\n\nFor large-sized journals the figures should be 84 mm (for double-column text areas), or 174 mm (for single-column text areas) wide and not higher than 234 mm.\n\nFor small-sized journals, the figures should be 119 mm wide and not higher than 195 mm.\n\nPermissions\n\nIf you include figures that have already been published elsewhere, you must obtain permission from the copyright owner(s) for both the print and online format. Please be aware that some publishers do not grant electronic rights for free and that Springer will not be able to refund any costs that may have occurred to receive these permissions. In such cases, material from other sources should be used.\n\nAccessibility\n\nIn order to give people of all abilities and disabilities access to the content of your figures, please make sure that\n\nAll figures have descriptive captions (blind users could then use a text-to-speech software or a text-to-Braille hardware)\n\nPatterns are used instead of or in addition to colors for conveying information (color-blind users would then be able to distinguish the visual elements)\n\nAny figure lettering has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1\n\nGenerative AI Images\n\nPlease check Springer’s policy on generative AI images and make sure your work adheres to the principles described therein.\n\nSupplementary Information (SI)\n\nSpringer accepts electronic multimedia files (animations, movies, audio, etc.) and other supplementary files to be published online along with an article or a book chapter. This feature can add dimension to the author's article, as certain information cannot be printed or is more convenient in electronic form.\n\nBefore submitting research datasets as Supplementary Information, authors should read the journal’s Research data policy. We encourage research data to be archived in data repositories wherever possible.\n\nSubmission\n\nSupply all supplementary material in standard file formats.\n\nPlease include in each file the following information: article title, journal name, author names; affiliation and e-mail address of the corresponding author.\n\nTo accommodate user downloads, please keep in mind that larger-sized files may require very long download times and that some users may experience other problems during downloading.\n\nHigh resolution (streamable quality) videos can be submitted up to a maximum of 25GB; low resolution videos should not be larger than 5GB.\n\nAudio, Video, and Animations\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3\n\nMaximum file size: 25 GB for high resolution files; 5 GB for low resolution files\n\nMinimum video duration: 1 sec\n\nSupported file formats: avi, wmv, mp4, mov, m2p, mp2, mpg, mpeg, flv, mxf, mts, m4v, 3gp\n\nText and Presentations\n\nSubmit your material in PDF format; .doc or .ppt files are not suitable for long-term viability.\n\nA collection of figures may also be combined in a PDF file.\n\nSpreadsheets\n\nSpreadsheets should be submitted as .csv or .xlsx files (MS Excel).\n\nSpecialized Formats\n\nSpecialized format such as .pdb (chemical), .wrl (VRML), .nb (Mathematica notebook), and .tex can also be supplied.\n\nCollecting Multiple Files\n\nIt is possible to collect multiple files in a .zip or .gz file.\n\nNumbering\n\nIf supplying any supplementary material, the text must make specific mention of the material as a citation, similar to that of figures and tables.\n\nRefer to the supplementary files as “Online Resource”, e.g., \"... as shown in the animation (Online Resource 3)\", “... additional data are given in Online Resource 4”.\n\nName the files consecutively, e.g. “ESM_3.mpg”, “ESM_4.pdf”.\n\nCaptions\n\nFor each supplementary material, please supply a concise caption describing the content of the file.\n\nProcessing of supplementary files\n\nSupplementary Information (SI) will be published as received from the author without any conversion, editing, or reformatting.\n\nAccessibility\n\nIn order to give people of all abilities and disabilities access to the content of your supplementary files, please make sure that\n\nThe manuscript contains a descriptive caption for each supplementary material\n\nVideo files do not contain anything that flashes more than three times per second (so that users prone to seizures caused by such effects are not put at risk)\n\nGenerative AI Images\n\nPlease check Springer’s policy on generative AI images and make sure your work adheres to the principles described therein.\n\nAfter Acceptance\n\nUpon acceptance, your article will be exported to Production to undergo typesetting. Shortly after this you will receive two e-mails. One contains a request to confirm your affiliation, choose the publishing model for your article, as well as to arrange rights and payment of any associated publication cost. A second e-mail containing a link to your article’s proofs will be sent once typesetting is completed.\n\nArticle publishing agreement\n\nDepending on the ownership of the journal and its policies, you will either grant the Publisher an exclusive licence to publish the article or will be asked to transfer copyright of the article to the Publisher.\n\nOffprints\n\nOffprints can be ordered by the corresponding author.\n\nColor illustrations\n\nPublication of color illustrations is free of charge.\n\nProof reading\n\nThe purpose of the proof is to check for typesetting or conversion errors and the completeness and accuracy of the text, tables and figures. Substantial changes in content, e.g., new results, corrected values, title and authorship, are not allowed without the approval of the Editor.\n\nAfter online publication, further changes can only be made in the form of an Erratum, which will be hyperlinked to the article.\n\nOnline First\n\nThe article will be published online after receipt of the corrected proofs. This is the official first publication citable with the DOI. After release of the printed version, the paper can also be cited by issue and page numbers.\n\nOpen Choice\n\nOpen Choice allows you to publish open access in more than 1850 Springer Nature journals, making your research more visible and accessible immediately on publication.\n\nArticle processing charges (APCs) vary by journal – view the full list\n\nBenefits:\n\nIncreased researcher engagement: Open Choice enables access by anyone with an internet connection, immediately on publication.\n\nHigher visibility and impact: In Springer hybrid journals, OA articles are accessed 4 times more often on average, and cited 1.7 more times on average*.\n\nEasy compliance with funder and institutional mandates: Many funders require open access publishing, and some take compliance into account when assessing future grant applications.\n\nIt is easy to find funding to support open access – please see our funding and support pages for more information.\n\n*) Within the first three years of publication.

In opting for open access, the author(s) agree to publish the article under the Creative Commons Attribution License.\n\nFind more about the license agreement\n\nResearch Data Policy and Data Availability Statements\n\nThis journal follows Springer Nature research data policy. Sharing of all relevant research data is strongly encouraged and authors must add a Data Availability Statement to original research articles.\n\nResearch data includes a wide range of types, including spreadsheets, images, textual extracts, archival documents, video or audio, interview notes or any specialist formats generated during research.\n\nData availability statements\n\nAll original research must include a data availability statement. This statement should explain how to access data supporting the results and analysis in the article, including links/citations to publicly archived datasets analysed or generated during the study. Please see our full policy here.\n\nIf it is not possible to share research data publicly, for instance when individual privacy could be compromised, this statement should describe how data can be accessed and any conditions for reuse. Participant consent should be obtained and documented prior to data collection. See our guidance on sensitive data for more information.\n\nWhen creating a data availability statement, authors are encouraged to consider the minimal dataset that would be necessary to interpret, replicate and build upon the findings reported in the article.\n\nFurther guidance on writing a data availability statement, including examples, is available at:\n\nData availability statements\n\nData repositories\n\nAuthors are strongly encouraged to deposit their supporting data in a publicly available repository. Sharing your data in a repository promotes the integrity, discovery and reuse of your research, making it easier for the research community to build on and credit your work.\n\nSee our data repository guidance for information on finding a suitable repository.\n\nWe recommend the use of discipline-specific repositories where available. For a number of data types, submission to specific public repositories is mandatory.\n\nSee our list of mandated data types.\n\nThe journal encourages making research data available under open licences that permit reuse. The journal does not enforce use of particular licences in third party repositories. You should ensure you have necessary rights to share any data that you deposit in a repository.\n\nData citation\n\nThe journal recommends that authors cite any publicly available data on which the conclusions of the paper rely. This includes data the authors are sharing alongside their publication and any secondary data the authors have reused. Data citations should include a persistent identifier (such as a DOI), should be included in the reference list using the minimum information recommended by DataCite (Dataset Creator, Dataset Title, Publisher [repository], Publication Year, Identifier [e.g. DOI, Handle, Accession or ARK]) and follow journal style.\n\nSee our further guidance on citing datasets.\n\nResearch data and peer review\n\nIf the journal that you are submitting to uses double-anonymous peer review and you are providing reviewers with access to your data (for example via a repository link, supplementary information or data on request), it is strongly suggested that the authorship in the data is also anonymised. There are data repositories that can assist with this and/or will create a link to mask the authorship of your data.\n\nSupport with research data policy\n\nAuthors who need help understanding our data sharing policy, finding a suitable data repository, or organising and sharing research data can consult our Research Data Helpdesk for guidance.\n\nSee our FAQ page for more information on Springer Nature’s research data policy.\n\nScientific style\n\nPlease always use internationally accepted signs and symbols for units (SI units).\n\nGenus and species names should be in italics.\n\nGeneric names of drugs and pesticides are preferred; if trade names are used, the generic name should be given at first mention.\n\nEthical Responsibilities of Authors\n\nThis journal is committed to upholding the integrity of the scientific record. As a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) the journal will follow the COPE guidelines on how to deal with potential acts of misconduct.\n\nAuthors should refrain from misrepresenting research results which could damage the trust in the journal, the professionalism of scientific authorship, and ultimately the entire scientific endeavour. Maintaining integrity of the research and its presentation is helped by following the rules of good scientific practice, which include*:\n\nThe manuscript should not be submitted to more than one journal for simultaneous consideration.\n\nThe submitted work should be original and should not have been published elsewhere in any form or language (partially or in full), unless the new work concerns an expansion of previous work. (Please provide transparency on the re-use of material to avoid the concerns about text-recycling (‘self-plagiarism’).\n\nA single study should not be split up into several parts to increase the quantity of submissions and submitted to various journals or to one journal over time (i.e. ‘salami-slicing/publishing’).\n\nConcurrent or secondary publication is sometimes justifiable, provided certain conditions are met. Examples include: translations or a manuscript that is intended for a different group of readers.\n\nResults should be presented clearly, honestly, and without fabrication, falsification or inappropriate data manipulation (including image based manipulation). Authors should adhere to discipline-specific rules for acquiring, selecting and processing data.\n\nNo data, text, or theories by others are presented as if they were the author’s own (‘plagiarism’). Proper acknowledgements to other works must be given (this includes material that is closely copied (near verbatim), summarized and/or paraphrased), quotation marks (to indicate words taken from another source) are used for verbatim copying of material, and permissions secured for material that is copyrighted.\n\nImportant note: the journal may use software to screen for plagiarism.\n\nAuthors should make sure they have permissions for the use of software, questionnaires/(web) surveys and scales in their studies (if appropriate).\n\nResearch articles and non-research articles (e.g. Opinion, Review, and Commentary articles) must cite appropriate and relevant literature in support of the claims made. Excessive and inappropriate self-citation or coordinated efforts among several authors to collectively self-cite is strongly discouraged.\n\nAuthors should avoid untrue statements about an entity (who can be an individual person or a company) or descriptions of their behavior or actions that could potentially be seen as personal attacks or allegations about that person.\n\nResearch that may be misapplied to pose a threat to public health or national security should be clearly identified in the manuscript (e.g. dual use of research). Examples include creation of harmful consequences of biological agents or toxins, disruption of immunity of vaccines, unusual hazards in the use of chemicals, weaponization of research/technology (amongst others).\n\nAuthors are strongly advised to ensure the author group, the Corresponding Author, and the order of authors are all correct at submission. Adding and/or deleting authors during the revision stages is generally not permitted, but in some cases may be warranted. Reasons for changes in authorship should be explained in detail. Please note that changes to authorship cannot be made after acceptance of a manuscript.\n\n*All of the above are guidelines and authors need to make sure to respect third parties rights such as copyright and/or moral rights.\n\nUpon request authors should be prepared to send relevant documentation or data in order to verify the validity of the results presented. This could be in the form of raw data, samples, records, etc. Sensitive information in the form of confidential or proprietary data is excluded.\n\nIf there is suspicion of misbehavior or alleged fraud the Journal and/or Publisher will carry out an investigation following COPE guidelines. If, after investigation, there are valid concerns, the author(s) concerned will be contacted under their given e-mail address and given an opportunity to address the issue. Depending on the situation, this may result in the Journal’s and/or Publisher’s implementation of the following measures, including, but not limited to:\n\nIf the manuscript is still under consideration, it may be rejected and returned to the author.\n\nIf the article has already been published online, depending on the nature and severity of the infraction:\n\n- an erratum/correction may be placed with the article\n\n- an expression of concern may be placed with the article\n\n- or in severe cases retraction of the article may occur.\n\nThe reason will be given in the published erratum/correction, expression of concern or retraction note. Please note that retraction means that the article is maintained on the platform, watermarked “retracted” and the explanation for the retraction is provided in a note linked to the watermarked article.\n\nThe author’s institution may be informed\n\nA notice of suspected transgression of ethical standards in the peer review system may be included as part of the author’s and article’s bibliographic record.\n\nFundamental errors\n\nAuthors have an obligation to correct mistakes once they discover a significant error or inaccuracy in their published article. The author(s) is/are requested to contact the journal and explain in what sense the error is impacting the article. A decision on how to correct the literature will depend on the nature of the error. This may be a correction or retraction. The retraction note should provide transparency which parts of the article are impacted by the error.\n\nSuggesting / excluding reviewers\n\nAuthors are welcome to suggest suitable reviewers and/or request the exclusion of certain individuals when they submit their manuscripts. When suggesting reviewers, authors should make sure they are totally independent and not connected to the work in any way. It is strongly recommended to suggest a mix of reviewers from different countries and different institutions. When suggesting reviewers, the Corresponding Author must provide an institutional email address for each suggested reviewer, or, if this is not possible to include other means of verifying the identity such as a link to a personal homepage, a link to the publication record or a researcher or author ID in the submission letter. Please note that the Journal may not use the suggestions, but suggestions are appreciated and may help facilitate the peer review process.\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nAuthors are requested to disclose interests that are directly or indirectly related to the work submitted for publication. Interests within the last 3 years of beginning the work (conducting the research and preparing the work for submission) should be reported. Interests outside the 3-year time frame must be disclosed if they could reasonably be perceived as influencing the submitted work. Disclosure of interests provides a complete and transparent process and helps readers form their own judgments of potential bias. This is not meant to imply that a financial relationship with an organization that sponsored the research or compensation received for consultancy work is inappropriate.\n\nEditorial Board Members and Editors are required to declare any competing interests and may be excluded from the peer review process if a competing interest exists. In addition, they should exclude themselves from handling manuscripts in cases where there is a competing interest. This may include – but is not limited to – having previously published with one or more of the authors, and sharing the same institution as one or more of the authors. Where an Editor or Editorial Board Member is on the author list we recommend they declare this in the competing interests section on the submitted manuscript. If they are an author or have any other competing interest regarding a specific manuscript, another Editor or member of the Editorial Board will be assigned to assume responsibility for overseeing peer review. These submissions are subject to the exact same review process as any other manuscript. Editorial Board Members are welcome to submit papers to the journal. These submissions are not given any priority over other manuscripts, and Editorial Board Member status has no bearing on editorial consideration.\n\nInterests that should be considered and disclosed but are not limited to the following:\n\nFunding: Research grants from funding agencies (please give the research funder and the grant number) and/or research support (including salaries, equipment, supplies, reimbursement for attending symposia, and other expenses) by organizations that may gain or lose financially through publication of this manuscript.\n\nEmployment: Recent (while engaged in the research project), present or anticipated employment by any organization that may gain or lose financially through publication of this manuscript. This includes multiple affiliations (if applicable).\n\nFinancial interests: Stocks or shares in companies (including holdings of spouse and/or children) that may gain or lose financially through publication of this manuscript; consultation fees or other forms of remuneration from organizations that may gain or lose financially; patents or patent applications whose value may be affected by publication of this manuscript.\n\nIt is difficult to specify a threshold at which a financial interest becomes significant, any such figure is necessarily arbitrary, so one possible practical guideline is the following: \"Any undeclared financial interest that could embarrass the author were it to become publicly known after the work was published.\"\n\nNon-financial interests: In addition, authors are requested to disclose interests that go beyond financial interests that could impart bias on the work submitted for publication such as professional interests, personal relationships or personal beliefs (amongst others). Examples include, but are not limited to: position on editorial board, advisory board or board of directors or other type of management relationships; writing and/or consulting for educational purposes; expert witness; mentoring relations; and so forth.\n\nPrimary research articles require a disclosure statement. Review articles present an expert synthesis of evidence and may be treated as an authoritative work on a subject. Review articles therefore require a disclosure statement. Other article types such as editorials, book reviews, comments (amongst others) may, dependent on their content, require a disclosure statement. If you are unclear whether your article type requires a disclosure statement, please contact the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nPlease note that, in addition to the above requirements, funding information (given that funding is a potential competing interest (as mentioned above)) needs to be disclosed upon submission of the manuscript in the peer review system. This information will automatically be added to the Record of CrossMark, however it is not added to the manuscript itself. Under ‘summary of requirements’ (see below) funding information should be included in the ‘Declarations’ section.\n\nSummary of requirements\n\nThe above should be summarized in a statement and placed in a ‘Declarations’ section before the reference list under a heading of ‘Funding’ and/or ‘Competing interests’. Other declarations include Ethics approval, Consent, Data, Material and/or Code availability and Authors’ contribution statements.\n\nPlease see the various examples of wording below and revise/customize the sample statements according to your own needs.\n\nWhen all authors have the same (or no) conflicts and/or funding it is sufficient to use one blanket statement.\n\nExamples of statements to be used when funding has been received:\n\nPartial financial support was received from [...]\n\nThe research leading to these results received funding from […] under Grant Agreement No[…].\n\nThis study was funded by […]\n\nThis work was supported by […] (Grant numbers […] and […]\n\nExamples of statements to be used when there is no funding:\n\nThe authors did not receive support from any organization for the submitted work.\n\nNo funding was received to assist with the preparation of this manuscript.\n\nNo funding was received for conducting this study.\n\nNo funds, grants, or other support was received.\n\nExamples of statements to be used when there are interests to declare:\n\nFinancial interests: Author A has received research support from Company A. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from Company W and owns stock in Company X. Author C is consultant to company Y.\n\nNon-financial interests: Author C is an unpaid member of committee Z.\n\nFinancial interests: The authors declare they have no financial interests.\n\nNon-financial interests: Author A is on the board of directors of Y and receives no compensation as member of the board of directors.\n\nFinancial interests: Author A received a speaking fee from Y for Z.

See also Authorship Principles. The Editor-in-Chief reserves the right to reject submissions that do not meet the guidelines described in this section.\n\nResearch involving human participants, their data or biological material\n\nEthics approval\n\nWhen reporting a study that involved human participants, their data or biological material, authors should include a statement that confirms that the study was approved (or granted exemption) by the appropriate institutional and/or national research ethics committee (including the name of the ethics committee) and certify that the study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. If doubt exists whether the research was conducted in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration or comparable standards, the authors must explain the reasons for their approach, and demonstrate that an independent ethics committee or institutional review board explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of the study. If a study was granted exemption from requiring ethics approval, this should also be detailed in the manuscript (including the reasons for the exemption).\n\nRetrospective ethics approval\n\nIf a study has not been granted ethics committee approval prior to commencing, retrospective ethics approval usually cannot be obtained and it may not be possible to consider the manuscript for peer review. The decision on whether to proceed to peer review in such cases is at the Editor's discretion.\n\nEthics approval for retrospective studies\n\nAlthough retrospective studies are conducted on already available data or biological material (for which formal consent may not be needed or is difficult to obtain) ethics approval may be required dependent on the law and the national ethical guidelines of a country. Authors should check with their institution to make sure they are complying with the specific requirements of their country.\n\nEthics approval for case studies\n\nCase reports require ethics approval. Most institutions will have specific policies on this subject. Authors should check with their institution to make sure they are complying with the specific requirements of their institution and seek ethics approval where needed. Authors should be aware to secure informed consent from the individual (or parent or guardian if the participant is a minor or incapable) See also section on Informed Consent.\n\nCell lines\n\nIf human cells are used, authors must declare in the manuscript: what cell lines were used by describing the source of the cell line, including when and from where it was obtained, whether the cell line has recently been authenticated and by what method. If cells were bought from a life science company the following need to be given in the manuscript: name of company (that provided the cells), cell type, number of cell line, and batch of cells.\n\nIt is recommended that authors check the NCBI database for misidentification and contamination of human cell lines. This step will alert authors to possible problems with the cell line and may save considerable time and effort.\n\nFurther information is available from the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC).\n\nAuthors should include a statement that confirms that an institutional or independent ethics committee (including the name of the ethics committee) approved the study and that informed consent was obtained from the donor or next of kin.\n\nResearch Resource Identifiers (RRID)\n\nResearch Resource Identifiers (RRID) are persistent unique identifiers (effectively similar to a DOI) for research resources. This journal encourages authors to adopt RRIDs when reporting key biological resources (antibodies, cell lines, model organisms and tools) in their manuscripts.\n\nExamples:\n\nOrganism: Filip1tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi RRID:MMRRC_055641-UCD\n\nCell Line: RST307 cell line RRID:CVCL_C321\n\nAntibody: Luciferase antibody DSHB Cat# LUC-3, RRID:AB_2722109\n\nPlasmid: mRuby3 plasmid RRID:Addgene_104005\n\nSoftware: ImageJ Version 1.2.4 RRID:SCR_003070\n\nRRIDs are provided by the Resource Identification Portal. Many commonly used research resources already have designated RRIDs. The portal also provides authors links so that they can quickly register a new resource and obtain an RRID.\n\nClinical Trial Registration\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) definition of a clinical trial is \"any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes\". The WHO defines health interventions as “A health intervention is an act performed for, with or on behalf of a person or population whose purpose is to assess, improve, maintain, promote or modify health, functioning or health conditions” and a health-related outcome is generally defined as a change in the health of a person or population as a result of an intervention.\n\nTo ensure the integrity of the reporting of patient-centered trials, authors must register prospective clinical trials (phase II to IV trials) in suitable publicly available repositories. For example www.clinicaltrials.gov or any of the primary registries that participate in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.\n\nThe trial registration number (TRN) and date of registration should be included as the last line of the manuscript abstract.\n\nFor clinical trials that have not been registered prospectively, authors are encouraged to register retrospectively to ensure the complete publication of all results. The trial registration number (TRN), date of registration and the words 'retrospectively registered’ should be included as the last line of the manuscript abstract.\n\nStandards of reporting\n\nSpringer Nature advocates complete and transparent reporting of biomedical and biological research and research with biological applications. Authors are recommended to adhere to the minimum reporting guidelines hosted by the EQUATOR Network when preparing their manuscript.\n\nExact requirements may vary depending on the journal; please refer to the journal’s Instructions for Authors.\n\nChecklists are available for a number of study designs, including:\n\nRandomised trials (CONSORT) and Study protocols (SPIRIT)\n\nObservational studies (STROBE)\n\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and protocols (Prisma-P)\n\nDiagnostic/prognostic studies (STARD) and (TRIPOD)\n\nCase reports (CARE)\n\nClinical practice guidelines (AGREE) and (RIGHT)\n\nQualitative research (SRQR) and (COREQ)\n\nAnimal pre-clinical studies (ARRIVE)\n\nQuality improvement studies (SQUIRE)\n\nEconomic evaluations (CHEERS)\n\nSummary of requirements\n\nThe above should be summarized in a statement and placed in a ‘Declarations’ section before the reference list under a heading of ‘Ethics approval’.\n\nExamples of statements to be used when ethics approval has been obtained:\n\n• All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Medical University of A (No. ...).\n\n• This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of University B (Date.../No. ...).\n\n• Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of University C. The procedures used in this study adhere to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n• The questionnaire and methodology for this study was approved by the Human Research Ethics committee of the University of D (Ethics approval number: ...).\n\nExamples of statements to be used for a retrospective study:\n\n• Ethical approval was waived by the local Ethics Committee of University A in view of the retrospective nature of the study and all the procedures being performed were part of the routine care.\n\n• This research study was conducted retrospectively from data obtained for clinical purposes. We consulted extensively with the IRB of XYZ who determined that our study did not need ethical approval. An IRB official waiver of ethical approval was granted from the IRB of XYZ.\n\n• This retrospective chart review study involving human participants was in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The Human Investigation Committee (IRB) of University B approved this study.\n\nExamples of statements to be used when no ethical approval is required/exemption granted:\n\n• This is an observational study. The XYZ Research Ethics Committee has confirmed that no ethical approval is required.\n\n• The data reproduced from Article X utilized human tissue that was procured via our Biobank AB, which provides de-identified samples. This study was reviewed and deemed exempt by our XYZ Institutional Review Board. The BioBank protocols are in accordance with the ethical standards of our institution and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\nAuthors are responsible for correctness of the statements provided in the manuscript. See also Authorship Principles. The Editor-in-Chief reserves the right to reject submissions that do not meet the guidelines described in this section.\n\nInformed consent\n\nAll individuals have individual rights that are not to be infringed. Individual participants in studies have, for example, the right to decide what happens to the (identifiable) personal data gathered, to what they have said during a study or an interview, as well as to any photograph that was taken. This is especially true concerning images of vulnerable people (e.g. minors, patients, refugees, etc) or the use of images in sensitive contexts. In many instances authors will need to secure written consent before including images.\n\nIdentifying details (names, dates of birth, identity numbers, biometrical characteristics (such as facial features, fingerprint, writing style, voice pattern, DNA or other distinguishing characteristic) and other information) of the participants that were studied should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, and genetic profiles unless the information is essential for scholarly purposes and the participant (or parent/guardian if the participant is a minor or incapable or legal representative) gave written informed consent for publication. Complete anonymity is difficult to achieve in some cases. Detailed descriptions of individual participants, whether of their whole bodies or of body sections, may lead to disclosure of their identity. Under certain circumstances consent is not required as long as information is anonymized and the submission does not include images that may identify the person.\n\nInformed consent for publication should be obtained if there is any doubt. For example, masking the eye region in photographs of participants is inadequate protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics are altered to protect anonymity, such as in genetic profiles, authors should provide assurance that alterations do not distort meaning.\n\nExceptions where it is not necessary to obtain consent:\n\n• Images such as x rays, laparoscopic images, ultrasound images, brain scans, pathology slides unless there is a concern about identifying information in which case, authors should ensure that consent is obtained.\n\n• Reuse of images: If images are being reused from prior publications, the Publisher will assume that the prior publication obtained the relevant information regarding consent. Authors should provide the appropriate attribution for republished images.\n\nConsent and already available data and/or biologic material\n\nRegardless of whether material is collected from living or dead patients, they (family or guardian if the deceased has not made a pre-mortem decision) must have given prior written consent. The aspect of confidentiality as well as any wishes from the deceased should be respected.\n\nData protection, confidentiality and privacy\n\nWhen biological material is donated for or data is generated as part of a research project authors should ensure, as part of the informed consent procedure, that the participants are made aware what kind of (personal) data will be processed, how it will be used and for what purpose. In case of data acquired via a biobank/biorepository, it is possible they apply a broad consent which allows research participants to consent to a broad range of uses of their data and samples which is regarded by research ethics committees as specific enough to be considered “informed”. However, authors should always check the specific biobank/biorepository policies or any other type of data provider policies (in case of non-bio research) to be sure that this is the case.\n\nConsent to Participate\n\nFor all research involving human subjects, freely-given, informed consent to participate in the study must be obtained from participants (or their parent or legal guardian in the case of children under 16) and a statement to this effect should appear in the manuscript. In the case of articles describing human transplantation studies, authors must include a statement declaring that no organs/tissues were obtained from prisoners and must also name the institution(s)/clinic(s)/department(s) via which organs/tissues were obtained. For manuscripts reporting studies involving vulnerable groups where there is the potential for coercion or where consent may not have been fully informed, extra care will be taken by the editor and may be referred to the Springer Nature Research Integrity Group.\n\nConsent to Publish\n\nIndividuals may consent to participate in a study, but object to having their data published in a journal article. Authors should make sure to also seek consent from individuals to publish their data prior to submitting their paper to a journal. This is in particular applicable to case studies. A consent to publish form can be found\n\nhere. (Download docx, 36 kB)\n\nSummary of requirements\n\nThe above should be summarized in a statement and placed in a ‘Declarations’ section before the reference list under a heading of ‘Consent to participate’ and/or ‘Consent to publish’. Other declarations include Funding, Competing interests, Ethics approval, Consent, Data and/or Code availability and Authors’ contribution statements.\n\nPlease see the various examples of wording below and revise/customize the sample statements according to your own needs.\n\nSample statements for \"Consent to participate\":\n\nInformed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\n\nInformed consent was obtained from legal guardians.\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the parents.\n\nVerbal informed consent was obtained prior to the interview.\n\nSample statements for “Consent to publish”:\n\nThe authors affirm that human research participants provided informed consent for publication of the images in Figure(s) 1a, 1b and 1c.\n\nThe participant has consented to the submission of the case report to the journal.\n\nPatients signed informed consent regarding publishing their data and photographs.\n\nSample statements if identifying information about participants is available in the article:\n\nAdditional informed consent was obtained from all individual participants for whom identifying information is included in this article.\n\nAuthors are responsible for correctness of the statements provided in the manuscript. See also Authorship Principles. The Editor-in-Chief reserves the right to reject submissions that do not meet the guidelines described in this section.\n\nImages will be removed from publication if authors have not obtained informed consent or the paper may be removed and replaced with a notice explaining the reason for removal."
