PSI Probing Solar System Evolution Through Trojan and Hilda Binary Asteroids 13 79 16 One of the most influential and yet poorly constrained events in solar system history is giant planet migration. Two asteroid populations are particularly diagnostic of how our giant planets moved: Jovian Trojan asteroids (hereafter, Trojans) which lie in stable orbits around Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points, and Hilda asteroids which are in 3:2 resonance with Jupiter. Gentle migration models require Trojans to have formed in situ while rapid migration models instead suggest that they were implanted from the outer solar system. Subsequent dynamical models predict Trojans and Hildas to have a common origin. Therefore, knowing the Trojan and Hilda formation location(s) would offer powerful, discerning constraints on key solar system formation and evolution models. Density is one of the only observable properties that can be used to determine an asteroid's formation location, low densities being consistent with an ice-rich outer solar system origin and high densities tied to warmer, rock-rich inner solar system formation. Characterizing binary asteroid systems is the only means of determining density and thus assessing formation location, apart from a spacecraft fly-by. However, only 5 Trojan and no Hilda binaries have been discovered. We propose to confirm and characterize 11 candidate Trojan and Hilda binaries, model their behavior to solve for density, and perform statistical analyses on the resultant Trojan and Hilda density distributions. This work will help provide context for the upcoming Lucy Space Mission to 6 Trojans, including 1 binary system. Matheson, T. NOAO Completing a Network of Next Generation SED standards with DA White Dwarfs 25 In our goal to establish a network of 18th mag flux standards with absolute colors anchored to sub-percent accuracy, we have combined panchromatic multi-band photometry of hot DA while dwarfs from HST (eliminating the terrestrial atmosphere) with ground-based spectroscopy from which the atmospheric parameters of the stars can be gleaned. We test the notion that the pure hydrogen and fully-radiative atmospheres of these stars can be modeled to high accuracy and reliability by contrasting modeled and measured colors (while simultaneously solving for line of sight reddening). Our early analysis indicates that color accuracies of 0.005 mag are attainable. We have in hand data for about two dozen such stars, and we were recently awarded Cycle 25 time with HST for 15 southern standards that will complete our network. To validate the new southern candidates as standard stars, it is critical to demonstrate that they do not vary with time. We propose to continue to use LCO for photometric monitoring of this new set of white dwarfs to assess their variability. Brown, A. U. Colorado Inner Disk Structure and Transport Mechanisms in the Transitional Disk around TCha 42 To better understand how Earth-like planets form around low-mass stars, we are studying the UV (HST), X-ray (XMM), and optical (LCOGT) variability of the young star T Cha. This variability is caused by obscuration of the star by clumpy material in the rim of its inner disk. Changing sight-lines through the disk allow measurement of the temperature and column density of both molecular and atomic gas and the physical properties of the dust grains in the well-mixed inner disk. LCOGT will provide the broad variability context needed for interpreting our HST/XMM observations. The approved space-based program consists of three 5 HST orbit visits, separated by ~4 days, simultaneous with 25 ksec XMM observations. Multiple observations are required to use analysis techniques comprising both differential comparison of broad-band spectra with differing A_v and detailed spectral fitting of gas absorption features at each epoch. The inner disk of T Cha is particularly interesting, because T Cha has a transitional disk with a large gap at 0.2-15 AU in the dust disk and allows study of the gas and dust structure during this important rapid phase of protoplanetary disk evolution. Results from these observations will have wide relevance to the modeling and understanding of protoplanetary disk structure and evolution, and the complex gas and dust physics and chemistry in disk surface layers. Valenti, S. UC, Davis DLT40+: Extending the One Day Cadence Supernova Search to the Northern Hemisphere 500 In the early hours to days after explosion, supernovae (SNe) provide clues to how they explode, and what their progenitor star systems were. Motivated by the need to discover, and study, SNe within the first day of explosion, we have begun a one-day cadence SN search of nearby galaxies (D = 40 Mpc) with a CTIO PROMPT telescope -- the program is expected to find 5-10 SNe per year within a day of explosion. We see an opportunity, however, to extend the search in the northern hemisphere using the world-wide LCO 0.4m network as an additional discovery engine, and to mitigate weather and instrument losses. A ‘DLT40+’ utilizing the growing LCO 0.4m network (especially as the number of sites expands) could in principle find nearly all of the SNe hosted by massive galaxies with D=40 Mpc for years to come. In this proposal, we request 500 hours of 0.4m queue time in order to add 100-200 galaxies in the northern hemisphere to the 400-600 galaxies we already observe with the Prompt telescopes in the southern hemisphere (Dec = 20 degrees) Arcavi, I. LCO Mapping the Diversity and Emission Mechanisms of Transients in Galaxy Centers 40 42 54 The search for the tidal disruption of stars (or TDEs) by super-massive black holes is continuing to yield exciting results. Following our identification of a first class of UV-bright TDEs, we are now identifying new classes of transients in galaxy centers (AKA \"nuclear transients\"). These events may be new types of TDEs or other forms of accretion events. We propose to expand our successful LCO TDE followup program to allow us to study the emission properties of these new types of nuclear transients, in addition to continuing to follow TDEs from the already established classes. LCO is the central component of a multi- wavelength and multi-facility effort to map the phase space of nuclear transients: Swift and JVLA provide UV, X-ray and radio observations; our own aSEATiDE survey and a combination of private and public access to other transient surveys provide suitable targets. We aim to continue to vet TDE candidates and to collect well-sampled photometry and spectroscopy of three new events this semester. The observations obtained as part of this campaign will allow us to continue to study the diversity of black-hole accretion physics and to develop nuclear transients as new tools for characterizing super-massive black holes. Mathur, S. IAC Activity cycles in Kepler Asteroseismic Targets 51 The position of the Sun compared to other solar-like stars have been questioned for some time, in particular with the study of the magnetic activity of solar-like stars through spectroscopic observations. Is the Sun a peculiar star? Recently, the investigation of some Kepler solar-like targets showed that stars enter a transition phase in terms of their rotation and magnetism for a given Rossby number. Subsequently, it was suggested that the Sun is in that transition phase where magnetic braking stops, leading to higher surface rotation rates, and where magnetic activity cycles become longer. However, we need more observational data to prove this theory. We propose to begin long-term monitoring of CaII H and K emission for a sample of 15 solar-like stars for which rotation rates have been measured with the Kepler data and for which we have seismic constraints on their ages and structures. Sonnett, S. PSI Characterizing the Lucy Mission Target 617 Patroclus- Menoetius 21 21 Jovian Trojan asteroids (hereafter, Trojans) lie in stable orbits at Jupiter's L4 and L5 Lagrange points. Their orbits are very sensitive to giant planet migration, making them excellent tracers of migration history. Additionally, binary asteroids are diagnostic of the dynamical environment in which they formed, offering clues to the nature and state of early solar system epochs. Thus, a binary Trojan asteroid is one of the most useful fossils in the solar system. The Lucy mission will launch in 2021 and fly by 5 Trojans, including 1 binary system: 617 Patroclus-Menoetius. Characterizing this system as much as possible in advance of the Lucy encounter will streamline the scientific roadmap and allow fine-scale tailoring of the encounter plan so as to best capture scientifically interesting points in Patroclus' orbit. The Patroclus system will undergo a season of mutual events from 2017-2019 (its last mutual event season before Lucy's launch and the third-to-last before the encounter). All of the mutual events in 2018A are shadow-casting events. Observing these events continuously and in fine detail will allow significant improvement in the system's orbital elements (including determination of whether or not the system has a circular orbit) and constraints on shape and surface scattering properties. We propose to leverage LCO’s queue-scheduled and longitudinally diverse network to observe 16 mutual events throughout 2018A with the goal of improving our knowledge of the orbit and physical properties of this unique object. Sand, D. Texas Tech Explosion Physics and progenitors from a one cadence supernova search 30 11 10 In the early hours to days after explosion, supernovae (SNe) provide unique clues on the nature of their progenitor stars and the physics of their explosion mechanisms. Motivated by the need to discover and fully characterize SNe within the first day of explosion, we have begun a pointed one-day cadence SN search focused on nearby (D=40 Mpc) galaxies with a PROMPT 0.4m telescope at CTIO. This program, called DLT40, will discover ~5-10 SNe per year within a day from their explosion, along with ~10 further SNe per year at later times and a zoo of other transients and variable stars. Here we request follow-up 0.4m and 1m imaging to confirm our incoming SNe, and FLOYDS spectroscopy to classify the most promising objects. Young and nearby interesting transients will eventually be fed to the Global Supernova Program (LCO key project) for a complete follow-up and full characterization. Siverd, R. LCO Hot, Bright Transiting Planets in the Solar Neighborhood 20 80 200 Transiting exoplanets with bright host stars are scientifically very productive because they provide a unique opportunity to accurately measure physical system parameters (mass, radius, temperature, composition). However, only a handful of the known transiting systems are bright enough for detailed characterization. Wide-field photometric transit surveys are well-suited to discovery of these systems but require follow-up observations to vet candidates and obtain high-precision light curves. The KELT project is a wide-field transit survey designed to survey FGK stars of V~7.5-11 mag and discover new planetary systems with high scientific value. With careful analysis, KELT has begun to confirm planets around significantly hotter stars (a population largely ignored to date). As of this writing, four of the seven known hot Jupiters with A- type host stars have been discovered by the KELT survey. Now at the start of its 14th season on sky, KELT has published numerous discoveries from both its Northern and Southern telescopes that include follow-up data from LCO. As our time baseline has grown, new candidates have emerged with longer periods (10 - 20 days). With capable telescopes at many different longitudes, the LCO network is particularly well suited to our photometric needs. Its importance is even greater for the candidates with longer periods that are now emerging. We propose to continue this successful program (taking particular advantage of the growing 0.4-meter network) to obtain high-precision photometry of promising candidates and discover new, bright exoplanets of high scientific value. Huitson, C. U. Colorado Monitoring Stellar Activity for Exoplanet Hosts 30 We propose photometric monitoring of four exoplanet host stars with the 1-m network in order to characterize their variability. The proposed program is important for the success of multiple ground- and space-based programs that are designed to study transiting exoplanet atmospheres. In order to accurately measure a planet’s transmission spectrum, stellar signals must be dis-entangled from true planetary atmospheric signals. Since the stellar contribution varies significantly depending on the number of starspots visible, only independent measurements of the stellar spot level will enable distinction between the two signals. For each planet that we have observed in transit, a total of 10, we have also obtained photometric observations of the host star close in time to the planetary observations to initially characterize their variability. It has now been 1 year since the planetary observations took place and we propose further photometric follow-up of the 4 stars we saw to be active in order to characterize their long-term variability. For these stars, long-term photometric monitoring is the only way to measure the stellar spot level during transit observations, by allowing us to accurately characterize the non-spotted stellar brightness. This brightness level can be inaccurate by a factor of 2 for active stars unless observations over multiple years are conducted. The additional observations will allow us to calibrate our previous photometric observations and maximize the scientific return from our exoplanet transmission spectra. Chatelain, J. LCO Multicolor Light Curve for Unusual Jupiter Trojan (4709) Ennomos 27 The Jupiter Trojan asteroids exist in camps that are co-orbital with Jupiter, preceding and following in the orbit of the gas giant by 60° in either direction. They represent a large population of likely primordial objects that remain understudied due to a combination of their dark surfaces and their relatively large distances from Earth compared to Main Belt objects. Due to their dynamical position and bimodal color distribution, understanding these objects is key to understanding the formation mechanisms of the early Solar System. Of the more than six thousand objects in the Jupiter Trojan swarms, (4709) Ennomos is one of the most unusual. It’s in the trailing L5 Trojan camp, and there is evidence that a large portion of its light curve amplitude is caused by a high albedo spot that takes up as much as 30% of its surface. We wish to either confirm or refute this hypothesis by obtaining a multi-filter light curve for the object over its full rotational period. Such observations will allow us to not only examine the surface features of this particularly interesting object, but also to explore the possibility of more complex and mottled surface characteristics for the Jupiter Trojans at large. This improved understanding of the complexity and variety of surface features on Jupiter Trojans will be critical for placing the targets of the forthcoming Lucy Mission in context within the larger Lagrangian swarms. Lister, T. LCO LCO NEO Follow-up Network 10 153 160 Near Earth Objects (NEOs) are our closest neighbors and research into them is important not only for understanding the Solar System’s origin and evolution, but also to understand and protect human society from potential impacts. NEOs originate in collisions between bodies in the main asteroid belt and have found their way into near-Earth space via complex dynamical interactions. Understanding these interactions, the populations and the orbital element distribution requires accurate orbits and complete samples for the NEO population, in order to properly debias the sample and correctly model the NEO population. Our previous programs of NEO follow-up on the 2-m and 1-m network have tracked and confirmed over a thousand new NEOs, primarily from the Catalina (CSS) and PanSTARRS1 (PS1) surveys. We wish to confirm and characterize new NEOs discovered by the feeder surveys PS1/2 (both now operating), CSS (both telescopes using larger FOV CCDs), and ATLAS and obtain light curves, determine rotation periods and search for satellite mutual events in radar-targeted NEOs. Confirming astrometry and photometry for new NEOWISE candidates is particularly important as this IR survey is unbiased to low-albedo objects allowing a cleaner sample but requires the follow-up to confirm NEOs and provide optical fluxes to derive the albedos. This proposal requests 240 hours of 1-m time, 140 hours of 0.4-m (to follow brighter, Northern targets) and 10 hours of 2-m FTN time for testing spectroscopic NEO follow-up. Greenstreet, S. LCO Detection of the Yarkovsky effect for a selection of near-Earth asteroids 80 The Yarkovsky effect is a non-gravitational force acting on small solar system bodies caused by the anisotropic re-emission of absorbed radiation in the thermal wavelengths. The result is a force not aligned with the Sun-body direction, producing an acceleration that mainly manifests in a change in semimajor axis with time. The amount of Yarkovsky acceleration depends on several physical properties, such as the asteroid spin state, size, mass, and thermal properties, to which detection of the effect can give important constraints. The effect is also important for understanding the transportation of asteroids and meteorites into near-Earth space from the main belt, producing the near-Earth objects (NEOs) and for the formation and evolution of asteroid families. Determining and modeling the Yarkovsky effect can be critical for accurate prediction of asteroid trajectories and even for impact hazard assessment. The Yarkovsky acceleration accumulates as a quadratic effect in the mean anomaly with the time span of the dataset and therefore can be detected from fits to astrometric measurements once the orbit is well constrained. This means that a small number of high quality, timely astrometric measurements can reveal deviations from a gravity-only trajectory, making the Yarkovsky signal detectable. We propose to use the LCO Network to perform astrometric measurements on a subset of NEOs that have the greatest predicted chance of producing a detectable Yarkovsky signal.

SAAO SAAO contribution to Transiting Exoplanet Science Key Project 50 LCO is becoming a one-stop shop for exoplanet observations. With the deployment of NRES it will be capable of obtaining both RVs to measure the orbit and photometry to measure the transit, all using a robotic telescope network. This is especially useful for observations of transiting planet candidates, confirming their planetary nature and measuring their orbit and mass, along with studying the systems architecture. Such observations are currently a bottleneck due to the lack of sufficient observing resources. We will use LCO to observe transiting planets identified by the Kepler, K2, KELT, HAT- South, and TESS surveys. We have identified 4 observing activities where LCO will make a significant contribution: In Part I we will detect transiting warm Jupiters, to study the inflated gas giant planet conundrum. In Part II we will observe transiting systems showing transit timing variations, to look for small planets in wide orbits, beyond the reach of the RV method. In Part III we will observe planet candidates orbiting bright and quiet stars which once confirmed will become prime targets for detailed characterization. In Part IV we will observe transit candidates to check whether the transit signal seen in the survey data is in fact a false positive originating from a deep eclipse on a nearby star diluted with the target in the wide PSF of the survey instrument. Each part is independent of the rest while combined they will make LCO a leading player in the exoplanets field. Potter, S. SAAO DDT, Transients and public outreach 50 Allocation for directors discretionary time, SAAO/SALT Transient program and public outreach. van Soelen, B. U. Free State Optical ToO observations with LCO for H.E.S.S. 33 The H.E.S.S. gamma-ray telescope regularly partakes in campaigns to obtain multi-wavelength observations of variable very-high-energy (VHE: E > 100 GeV) ?-ray sources. Here we propose for ToO time on the LCOGT system to provide optical support for such coordinated multiwavelength observations. The most probable targets will be extra-galactic sources such as blazars and GRBs. Blazars display rapid variability across all wavelengths and while some studies have found tight correlations between the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions, others have not. Observed correlations (or lack thereof), which often include more complicated patterns than simple linear flux-flux correlations, place constraints on the particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms at work within these systems. A major part of the science being undertaken with the H.E.S.S. II telescope is the attempted VHE gamma-ray detection of a GRB. While GRBs are routinely observed at MeV energies and have been detected up to 95 GeV by Fermi-LAT, so far none has been detected at energies above 100 GeV. The H.E.S.S. II telescope has a fully automated GRB observation system, automatically repositioning the system for prompt follow-up observations of GRBs, within as short as 60 seconds, without the need for intervention by the observation shift crew. The LCOGT provides a unique resource to allow for simultaneous optical and VHE observations. Kniazev, A. SAAO Study photometric structure of southern lenticular galaxies in clusters 36 The goal of the project is to study photometric structure of southern lenticular galaxies in clusters. The project supplements the spectral program is now active at SALT. To attribute the stellar population ages and metallicities measured along the slit of spectrograph to certain large-scale components of the galaxies studied, we need the images in gri bands. After data obtaining, we will decompose observed galaxies into bulges and disks to determine strict radial borders and relative brightness contributions of the components at different radii. Kniazev, A. SAAO Confirming the LBV status of spectroscopically selected LBV candidates 10 We have been conducting an optical/near-IR spectral survey of a large subset of central stars residing within newly discovered Spitzer and WISE nebulae and have identified over two dozen new candidate luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. Confirming them as bona fide LBVs requires demonstrating spectroscopic and ~ 1-3 mag photometric variability. Our optical spectro-photometric monitoring already has confirmed four!!! new candidate LBV stars as a bona fide LBV, which presently displaying what appears to be S Dor-type variability. We propose to carry out further photometric monitoring of these four and twenty others spectroscopically selected optically bright LBV candidates, which would allow us to study the development of the LBV activity of new found bona fide LBVs and potentially to confirm the LBV status of some of the LBV candidates. Menzies, J. SAAO Light-Curves of Possible Super-AGB Stars in NGC 6822 1 :We propose obtaining one exposure per month in the I band of the brightest LPVs in NGC6822 in order to characterize their variability. This is an ongoing programme that has been quite successful so far. Because the periods are very long (>500 day) we need observations over a number of years to get satisfactory light curves. Menzies, J. SAAO Evolutionary Period Changes in Hot Bottom Burning Stars in IC1613? 3 We propose obtaining one exposure per month in the Rc band of the hot bottom burning (HBB) variables in IC 1613 in order to further characterize their variability and in particular to find out if the period of the lithium-rich star is changing. Such a change could indicate that real-time evolution is occurring. We have obtained useful data so far, but need to cover several more cycles to determine if the periods are stable. Wilcots, E. U. Wisconsin AGN and the Variable Radio Sky via CHILES VERDES 50 We request 4800s (1.33.hours) per night of LCO time in r band through the end of the current configuration of the Jansky Very Large Array on 29 January 2018 to monitor the optical counterparts to transient and variable radio events detected by CHILES (COSMOS HI Large Extragalactic Survey). CHILES is a deep-field survey conducted at the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), providing deep radio spectral-line and continuum observations of faint sources in the COSMOS field over timescales of ~10 years. The purpose of this proposal is to probe variability of the optical counterparts of the radio continuum sources with ~daily cadence during Nov 2017--Jan 2018 (overlapping with CHILES observations), to: 1. Map the full range of timescales of radio and optical variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN); 2. Quantify the amplitudes of AGN variability, particularly for low-luminosity AGN; and 3. Survey the CHILES field for optical transients, which may have radio counterparts. There has been no previously allocated time on any LCO facility. Hlabathe, M. SAAO Echo mapping of low redshift (z<0.1) AGN as part of the LCO AGN key project 41 Echo mapping of active galactic nuclei (AGN) measures the time lag between the variable continuum and broad emission line in order to determine the size of the emitting broad line region (BLR). We want to use this technique to determine the size of the BLR for a sample of low luminosity AGN at low redshift (z < 0.1). We will trigger spectroscopic monitoring based on the photometric monitoring we propose to carry out with LCO. From these observations, we will calibrate the relationship between black hole mass, the BLR size, the velocity dispersion and the luminosity for low luminosity AGN.

Photometric monitoring of the M dwarfs in the Carmenes sample 200 CARMENES is the new optical and near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph that recently started operations in the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory. The main objective of CARMENES is to carry out a radial-velocity search for low-mass planets around ~300 M dwarfs. As part of our efforts to characterize the sample and avoid spurious radial-velocity signals of activity that can mimic the presence of planets, we plan to acquire contemporaneous photometry of some of these targets to characterize variability and search for rotational periods. Here we propose to carry out a continuous photometric monitoring in the I band of some of the brightest stars of the CARMENES sample that will be followed by the instrument in the next semester over 10-100 days using the SBIG camera at the 40 cm telescopes of LCOGT. Crouzet, N. Searching for transiting cold Jupiters around bright stars 60 Much of our understanding of gas giant exoplanets come from those transiting in front of bright stars at very short orbital separations (P ~ 3 days, a ~ 0.05 AU). These hot Jupiters are coupled to their host stars: stellar irradiation impacts the chemistry and temperature structure of their atmospheres, and tidal interactions with the host star a ects the planet's orbital dynamics and may even impact the star itself. This coupling complicates the modelling of hot Jupiters and impairs our understanding of gas giant planets in general. In this respect, hot Jupiters are complex systems to study. In contrast, gas giant exoplanets with long orbital periods and large separations (P > 30 days, a > 0.2 AU) are largely decoupled from their host stars making them ideal benchmarks to study gas giant planets. Unfortunately, their properties are largely unknown because transiting ones are much harder to detect than those at shorter orbital periods. In fact, they are out of reach of most ground-based transit surveys. CoRoT and Kepler detected such planets but only around faint stars, which make them hard to characterize. The next step in our understanding of gas giant planets will come from the discovery and characterization of transiting \"cold Jupiters\" orbiting bright stars. In the past years, we conducted a photometric transit survey from Dome C in Antarctica through the ASTEP project (Antarctica Search for Transiting Exoplanets, PI: T. Guillot) and identified around forty transit candidates around bright stars, many of them having orbital periods longer than 30 days. Here, we propose to conduct a photometric follow-up of the best candidates with the LCO 40cm telescopes. The LCO network is the only ground-based facility that can perform this follow-up efficiently. Indeed, the long orbital periods yield long transit durations, which cannot be observed in full from a single temperate site. Combining light curves from telescopes located at different longitudes observing the same transit event will allow us to reconstruct a full transit curve. This follow-up should yield the discovery of a few transiting \"cold Jupiters\" that are suitable to characterization and will extend the parameter space in the study of gas giant exoplanets. Licandro, J. Photometric Observations of the Targets of NASA’s Mission Lucy 60 In this proposal we aim to obtain photometric observations of Jupiter Trojan asteroids (617) Patroclus, (3548) Eurybates, and (21900) Orus using the 40cm telescopes in support of the Lucy mission. Lucy is a mission of the NASA’s Discovery Program that is planned to launch in October 2021 and will complete a 12-year journey to six different asteroids - a primitive main belt asteroid (52246 Donaldjohanson) and five Trojans (including 617, 3548 and 21900). Lucy is the first reconnaissance mission of the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. These primitive bodies may be remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets, and serve as time capsules from the birth of our Solar System more than 4 billion years ago. These asteroids are of a more pristine composition, experienced less heating and may contain a significant fraction of ice in their interiors (Jones et al. 1990; Burbine et al. 2008) than the main belt asteroids. Their origin is still under debate. Levison et al. (2008), suggested that a large fraction are transneptunian objects (TNOs) moved to these resonances in an early epoch of the Solar System called the “Late Heavy Bombardment\" (LHB). Jupiter Family (JF) comets and Centaurs are dynamically evolved TNOs. It is therefore reasonable to consider that Trojans are largely populated by captured TNOs, their surface properties should be similar to each other and also similar to those of JF comets and Centaurs with past cometary-like activity. The mission will use a suite of high-heritage remote sensing instruments to map the geology, surface color and composition, thermal and other physical properties of its targets at close range. Prieto, J. Exploring New Parameter Space with SuperWASP-North 40 Despite the significant increase in the number of known transiting planets brought about by the Kepler & K2 missions, questions still remain regarding the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. To tackle these issues we must continue to explore the corners of parameter space, searching out new systems at the edge of what we currently know. Within this context, changes to both the hardware and observing strategy of SuperWASP-North have extended the parameter space it can access into smaller radii and longer orbital periods (Pollacco et al. 2006). Our stare-mode strategy provides less sky-coverage but allows for a faster observing cadence and higher photometric precision. Combined with better control of systematic noise, this allows the detection of both 'warm Jupiters' and Neptune-like planets. Our previous detection strategy required the phase alignment of multiple, periodic transit events, limiting our sensitivity to systems with P < 6 days. Initial results from stare-mode observations confirm that we can now identify planets from individual transits, pushing the boundaries of ground-based planet detection to longer periods only previously accessible from space. This opens up the possibility of discovering `warm Jupiters' in 6-60 days orbits, including orbits in the habitable zone of low-mass, bright K dwarfs, using SuperWASP. These would be ideal candidates for detailed characterisation studies aimed at determining planetary atmospheric properties. Acosta, J. Optical monitoring of a sample of bright gamma-ray blazars 20 Blazars (BL-Lac type and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars) form a class of Active Galactic Nuclei, very luminous from radio-frequencies to very high energies, showing extreme variability and high polarization. The emission is supposed to come from a jet of accelerated relativistic particles, originating at the vicinity of a supermassive black hole, and oriented closely to the line of sight which amplified the radiation. Blazars stand out as a good laboratory to study relativistic jets. The analysis of light curves at different spectral ranges provides a very powerful tool to disentangle the physical mechanisms responsible of blazar emission, specially to locate the regions where emission in different spectral ranges originates. Here we propose to continue our photometric monitoring in the optical range of a sample of blazars, which are very active in gamma rays as well as in the optical-infrared range. Our group actively participates in the international network GASP-WEBT [http://www.oato.inaf.it/blazars/webt/]. The selected sample is daily monitored in the high-energy range by space observatories, like Fermi, AGILE and Swift, despite few targets are also regularly observed using groundbased facilities, like MAGIC telescopes. The use of robotic observing facilities, such as Las Cumbres Observatory, is preferred against observations in visitor mode for our monitoring program, since it permits to have a more regular observing cadence and hence well populated light curves. Casares, J. VRIHα follow-up of Be X-ray binary systems 20 Be X-ray binary systems (BeX for short) are stellar binary systems in which a Be star and a compact object orbit each other around their common center of mass (Reig 2011). A Be star is a main sequence early B star showing hydrogen Balmer lines in emission and an infrared excess with respect normal B stars of the same subtype. Both observational facts are due to the presence of an equatorial circumstellar decretion disc around the B star (Slettebak 1988). The presence of such a circumstellar structure determines both the observational properties of the B star and of the binary system. The exact processes which drive the formation of such a disc are still unknown, although pulsations, fast rotation, and magnetic fields are known to be key ingredients (Porter & Rivinus 2003). The Be disc in the presence of a nearby orbiting compact object is denser and more compact than that of an isolated Be star (Zamanov et al. 2001). X-ray emission is released from the compact companion once or twice per orbit when it approaches the Be star and captures matter from the disc. This matter accretes onto the compact object and loses energy in the form of X-ray radiation. The intensity of the X-ray emission, in turn, depends on the quantity of plasma captured and its density. The study of the properties of Be disks in X-ray binary systems is, therefore, of crucial interest in several fields of research, from the study of the hydrodynamics of plasmas to the theories of stellar structure and evolution, sharing interests with theories of accretion processes and stellar wind modelling, among others. The study of these discs can be overtaken from a large variety of points of view: spectroscopy has been proven to be very fruitful and accurate; X-ray luminosities observed can indirectly give information about the density and size of the disc; photometry has also revealed itself as a key tool to study the properties of Be disks in both isolated and binary stars and to locate optical counterparts (see for example Reig et al. 2005 and Blay et al. 2012). Gomez, M. Spectral Energy distribution of planetary nebulae detected by GALEX 10 Planetary Nebulae (PNe) mainly consist of an ionized envelope surrounding a stellar nucleus. The shaping of a PN takes place at some point between the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and the white dwarf (WD) stellar phases. The characteristic ionized envelope of a PN results from the strong mass-loss experienced during the AGB and post-AGB phases through the stellar wind ejected by their progenitor stars. In fact, an AGB star can lose up to 80% of its mass during its last thermal pulses (Villaver, Garc´ıa-Segura, & Manchado, 2002). Althougth some models explain the simplest morphologies (ISW Kwok, Purton, & Fitzgerald, 1978; Balick, 1987), the most complex ones remains under debate. The study of PNe morphologies provides valuable information about the late stages of stellar evolution for intermediate-mass stars. One of the models proposed to explain the most complex morphologies observed in evolved PNe is related to binaries, common envelope phase, substellar interaction, and non-radial pulstations (e. g. Soker, 1997; Bond & Livio, 1990; Soker & Harpaz, 1992; Ricker & Taam, 2012; De Marco et al., 2013). Thus, binaries may play an important role in the stellar evolution. However, up to only 40 binary central stars of PNe (CSPN) are known (De Marco et al., 2013). Stellar evolution from the AGB to PNe phase is very poorly undestood. In binary CSPN, a double spectral energy distribution (SED) is expected; the ionizing star with a temperature higher than 30000K and the companion, which may have a cooler temperature. To find the double SED, a study of the UV band to optical-IR is needed. The GALEX far-UV and near-UV fluxes, added to optical-IR data, offer an unique sensitivity to detect hot companions, elusive in optical surveys. GALEX FUV and NUV data exist (Bianchi, 2014) for a sample of 500 CSPN, while only a fraction of these has optical photoemtry from SDSS or Pan-STARRS. SBIG6303 mounted in the 0.4m telescope will allow us: obtain the optical photometry in five bands (u g r i z ), fitting a double SED (if binary exist) in conjunction with GALEX catalog, characterize the CSPN, and obtain the stellar temperatures. Positive results from the first part of observations were obtained. For this reason is that we are requesting for the other half of our objects."
