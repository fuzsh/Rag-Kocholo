These programs are optional but can provide depth and breadth to a UC Berkeley education. The College of Engineering does not offer additional time to complete a minor, but it is usually possible to finish within the allotted time with careful course planning. Students are encouraged to meet with their ESS adviser to discuss the feasibility of completing a minor program.\n\nAll the engineering departments offer minors. Students may also consider pursuing a minor in another school or college.\n\nApplicants can apply after second semester sophomore year and up to first semester senior year. Applicants who have completed more than two of the courses prior to applying will not be accepted into the minor; students must apply first.\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\nAll minors must be declared no later than one semester before a student's Expected Graduation Term (EGT). If the semester before EGT is fall or spring, the deadline is the last day of RRR week. If the semester before EGT is summer, the deadline is the final Friday of Summer Sessions. To declare a minor, contact the department advisor for information on requirements, and the declaration process.\n\nAll courses taken to fulfill the minor requirements must be taken for graded credit.\n\nA minimum technical grade point average of 3.0 (math, science & engineering courses) is required for acceptance into the minor program.\n\nA minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for courses used to fulfill the minor requirements.\n\nNo more than one upper division course may be used to simultaneously fulfill requirements for a student’s major and minor programs.\n\nCompletion of the minor program cannot delay a student’s graduation.\n\nPlease see more details at the department website.\n\nProcedure\n\nStudents should apply first, before taking courses. Applications are available in 306 Stanley Hall or on the department website. Completed applications should be returned to 306 Stanley Hall. Please include an unofficial copy of your transcript with the application.\n\nThe department will review all applications and students will be notified by email of the decision.\n\nUpon completion of the requirements for the minor, the student should complete the Confirmation of Completion form. Please submit the form along with an unofficial transcript to 306 Stanley Hall.\n\nThe department will verify the completion of the minor and send the original form to the Office of the Registrar. (Note: for graduating seniors, this must be done no later than two weeks after the end of the term.)\n\nA notation in the memorandum section of the student’s transcript will indicate completion of the minor.\n\nRecommended Preparation\n\nThe upper division requirements for the BioE minor require competency in subject matters covered in the following recommended courses.\n\nCourse List CodeTitleUnitsCHEM 3AChemical Structure and Reactivity3 MATH 53Multivariable Calculus4 MATH 54Linear Algebra and Differential Equations4 PHYSICS 7APhysics for Scientists and Engineers 14 PHYSICS 7BPhysics for Scientists and Engineers 14\n\nUpper Division Minor Requirements\n\nOne course from the BioE Fundamentals List.\n\nTwo upper division courses from the Technical Topics List.\n\nTwo upper division bioengineering courses.

Entering junior transfers are allowed five semesters to complete their degree requirements. Summer terms are optional and do not count toward the maximum. Students are responsible for planning and satisfactorily completing all graduation requirements within the maximum allowable semesters.\n\nAdhere to all college policies and procedures as they complete degree requirements.\n\nComplete lower division technical courses before enrolling in upper division technical courses.\n\nHumanities and Social Sciences (H/SS) Requirement\n\nTo promote a rich and varied educational experience outside of the technical requirements for each major, the College of Engineering has a six-course Humanities and Social Sciences breadth requirement, which must be completed to graduate. This requirement, built into all the engineering programs of study, includes two Reading and Composition courses (R&C), and four additional courses within which a number of specific conditions must be satisfied. See the humanities and social sciences section of our website for details.\n\nClass Schedule Requirements\n\nMinimum units per semester: 12.0\n\nMaximum units per semester: 20.5\n\nMinimum technical courses: College of Engineering undergraduates must include at least two letter graded technical courses (of at least 3 units each) in their semester program. Every semester students are expected to make normal progress in their declared major. Normal progress is determined by the student's Engineering Student Services Advisor. (Note: For most majors, normal progress will require enrolling in 3-4 technical courses required of your current major each semester.) Students who are not in compliance with this policy by the end of the fifth week of the semester are subject to a registration block that will delay enrollment for the following semester.\n\nAll technical courses (math, science, engineering) that satisfy requirements for the major must be taken on a letter-graded basis (unless only offered as P/NP).\n\nMinimum Academic Requirements\n\nStudents must have a minimum overall and semester grade point average of 2.00 (C average). Students will be subject to suspension or dismissal from the University if during any fall or spring semester their overall UC GPA falls below a 2.00, or their semester GPA is less than 2.00.\n\nStudents must achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.00 (C average) in upper division technical courses required for the major curriculum each semester.\n\nA minimum overall grade point average of 2.00 and a minimum 2.00 grade point average in upper division technical course work required for the major are required to earn a Bachelor of Science in the College of Engineering.\n\nStudents must make normal degree progress toward the Bachelor of Science degree and their officially declared major.\n\nUnit Requirements\n\nTo earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering, students must complete at least 120 semester units of courses subject to certain guidelines:\n\nCompletion of the requirements of one engineering major program of study.\n\nA maximum of 16 units of special studies coursework (courses numbered 97, 98, 99, 197, 198, or 199) is allowed to count towards the B.S. degree, and no more than 4 units in any single term can be counted.\n\nA maximum of 4 units of physical education from any school attended will count towards the 120 units.\n\nPassed (P) grades may account for no more than one third of the total units completed at UC Berkeley, Fall Program for First Semester (FPF), UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP), or UC Berkeley Washington Program (UCDC) toward the 120 overall minimum unit requirement. Transfer credit is not factored into the limit. This includes transfer units from outside of the UC system, other UC campuses, credit-bearing exams, as well as UC Berkeley Extension XB units.\n\nNormal Progress\n\nStudents in the College of Engineering must enroll in a full-time program and make normal progress each semester toward their declared major. Students who fail to achieve normal academic progress shall be subject to suspension or dismissal. (Note: Students with official accommodations established by the Disabled Students' Program, with health or family issues, or with other reasons deemed appropriate by the dean may petition for an exception to normal progress rules.)\n\nUC and Campus Requirements\n\nUniversity of California Requirements\n\nEntry Level Writing\n\nAll students who will enter the University of California as freshmen must demonstrate their command of the English language by satisfying the Entry Level Writing Requirement (ELWR). The UC Entry Level Writing Requirement website provides information on how to satisfy the requirement.\n\nAmerican History and American Institutions\n\nThe American History and Institutions (AH&I) requirements are based on the principle that a US resident graduated from an American university should have an understanding of the history and governmental institutions of the United States.\n\nCampus Requirement\n\nAmerican Cultures\n\nThe American Cultures requirement is a Berkeley campus requirement, one that all undergraduate students at Berkeley need to pass in order to graduate. You satisfy the requirement by passing, with a grade not lower than C- or P, an American Cultures course. You may take an American Cultures course any time during your undergraduate career at Berkeley. The requirement was instituted in 1991 to introduce students to the diverse cultures of the United States through a comparative framework. Courses are offered in more than fifty departments in many different disciplines at both the lower and upper division level.\n\nPlan of Study\n\nFor more detailed information regarding the courses listed below (e.g., elective information, GPA requirements, etc.), please see the College Requirements and Major Requirements tabs.\n\nFor plans of study specific to bioengineering area concentrations, see the department website.\n\nFreshmanFallUnitsSpringUnits MATH 1A4MATH 1B4 BIO ENG 10114PHYSICS 7A (taken Sophomore year in Synthetic Biology concentration)4 CHEM 1A\n\n& 1AL15CHEM 3A\n\n& 3AL15 BIO ENG 2621BIO ENG 2521 Reading & Composition Part A Course34Reading and Composition Part B Course341818SophomoreFallUnitsSpringUnits MATH 534BIO ENG 113 PHYSICS 7B4MATH 544 ENGIN 7 or COMPSCI 61A4Engineering Course43-4 Humanities/Social Sciences Course2,33-4Humanities/Social Sciences Course2,33-415-1613-15JuniorFallUnitsSpringUnits Bioengineering Fundamentals Course54Bioengineering Fundamentals Course53-4 Upper Division Technical Topics Course63-4Upper Division Technical Topics (also an Engineering Course)4,66-8 Engineering Course43-4Humanities/Social Sciences course2,33 BIO ENG 100 (or Humanities/Social Sciences course with Ethics content)2,33Free Elective313-1515-18SeniorFallUnitsSpringUnits Bioengineering Lab course74Free Electives107 Upper Division Technical Topics Course4,63-4Bioengineering Upper Division Courses98 Bioengineering Design Project or Research83-4 Free Electives103-413-1615Total Units: 120-131\n\nStudent Learning Goals\n\nMission\n\nSince our founding in 1998, the BioE faculty have been working to create an integrated, comprehensive program. Much thought has been put into the question, “What does every bioengineer need to know?” The faculty have been engaged in considerable dialogue over the years about what needs to be included, in what order, and how to do so in a reasonable time frame. Balancing depth with breadth has been the key challenge, and we have reached a point where the pieces have come together to form a coherent bioengineering discipline.\n\nLearning Goals for the Major\n\nDescribe the fundamental principles and methods of engineering.\n\nUnderstand the physical, chemical, and mathematical basis of biology.\n\nAppreciate the different scales of biological systems.\n\nApply the physical sciences and mathematics in an engineering approach to biological systems.\n\nEffectively communicate scientific and engineering data and ideas, both orally and in writing.\n\nDemonstrate the values of cooperation, teamwork, social responsibility, and lifelong learning necessary for success in the field.\n\nDesign a bioengineering solution to a problem of technical, scientific. or societal importance.\n\nDemonstrate advanced knowledge in a specialized field of bioengineering.\n\nMajor Map\n\nMajor maps are experience maps that help undergraduates plan their Berkeley journey based on intended major or field of interest. Featuring student opportunities and resources from your college and department as well as across campus, each map includes curated suggestions for planning your studies, engaging outside the classroom, and pursuing your career goals in a timeline format.\n\nUse the major map below to explore potential paths and design your own unique undergraduate experience:\n\nView the Bioengineering Major Map.\n\nAdvising\n\nBioengineering provides an array of programmatic and individual advising services. Each student is strongly encouraged to consult with a faculty advisor each semester. Our dedicated Bioengineering undergraduate affairs officer is available through appointments or drop-in times to consult on topics such as course selection, degree requirements, concentration selection, and achieving personal and academic goals. Further advising support is available from staff in the Engineering Student Services Office.\n\nPlease see more information on advising on the department website.\n\nAdvising Staff\n\nUndergraduate Advisor:\n\nMarisela Adler\n\nPhone: 510-642-5860\n\nmariselal@berkeley.edu\n\n306C Stanley Hall\n\nAcademic Opportunities\n\nUndergraduate Research\n\nWe believe it is essential for undergraduates to experience the hands-on application of skills to prepare them for a career in bioengineering. Every student is required to complete at least one semester of research or design before graduation, although most do more. This can be accomplished through our outstanding senior capstone design course, or through other independent study options and research in faculty laboratories. A recent survey shows that 86% of our senior students have undertaken extracurricular research, usually starting in their sophomore year. For research resources, please visit the department website.\n\nStudent Organizations\n\nThere are several active student organizations related to bioengineering, focusing on academics, research, global healthcare, local outreach, social life, career planning, and other worthy efforts. For further information, please see the Student Life page on the department website."
