        "text": "Data and File Formatting\n\nThe archive accepts audio files and derived data products.\n\nAudio Files\n\nFile Format\n\nNeed to be in a standard format, such as .wav, .aif., and .mp3. Raw or proprietary file formats such as .dat are not accepted\n\nTo save space, it is recommended to flac the files. Note that there are limitations in the number of channels that the flac compression can accommodate and flac does not provide any additional compression for .mp3 formats. If you have x.wav files, ensure that the tag -keep-foreign-metadata is used.\n\nFile Naming Conventions\n\nInclude the deployment and timestamp to the highest resolution\n\nExample\n\nKingman_A_01_111110_211500.df20.x.flac where Kingman_A_01 is the site and deployment and 111110_211500 is the timestamp in yymmdd_hhmmss format\n\nDerived Products\n\nSound Level Metrics\n\nAdapted from Wall et al, 2021: Standardized soundscape measurement routines and metrics are essential for comparing datasets across large spatio-temporal scales. Best practices, particularly for deriving ambient sound level statistics from long time series data, have been implemented across several projects (Haver et al., 2018; Heaney et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2021). These practices are driven by established international standards in acoustic terminology [International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2017; Ainslie et al., 2018]. Recommendations from multiple international workshops focused on long-term trends in ambient sound level measurements have centered on the use of decidecade bands, also known as one-third octaves, with an averaging window of 1 m (International Whaling Commission et al., 2014; Consortium for Ocean Leadership, 2018; International Quiet Ocean Experiment, 2020). These parameters reflect the minimum acceptable resolution, with higher resolution spectral (1 Hz bands) and temporal (1-s averages) parameters desired when feasible. See Table 1 in Miksis-Olds et al., 2021 for a summary of these community recommendations. These minimum recommendations balance the amount of information available for comparison with limitations to process and store large datasets (Martin et al., 2021).\n\nRecently, a hybrid millidecade spectra has been proposed to quantify ambient sound levels (Martin et al., 2021; Miksis-Olds et al., 2021). This new approach has not been applied widely across projects, but it could provide a meaningful metric that captures many sources of sound contributing to the soundscape with greater resolution than decidecade, particularly for low frequencies, and offer greater volume compression compared to straight 1 Hz bands. Temporal analysis windows of 1 day to 1 month are noted as the minimum recommendation for establishing long-term (monthly, seasonal, and annual) statistics of the ambient sound levels with desirable analysis windows as short as 1 h (International Quiet Ocean Experiment, 2020). Following these guidelines, the SanctSound project has established hourly decidecade bands created from 1-s observations as one of the standardized metrics calculated across all project sites to enable comparative analysis. Similarly, ADEON has established 1-s decidecade bands as one of the standardized metrics calculated across all the ADEON recording sites.\n\nFollowing the operationalization of MANTA software (Miksis-Olds et al., 2021), the IOOS DMAC project Passive Acoustic Monitoring National Cyberinfrastructure Center (SoundCoop) has established 1-min hybrid millidecade bands as the standardized metric calculated across all the SoundCoop case study sites.\n\nFile format\n\nRecommended file formats are netCDF and CSV with netCDF most preferred.\n\nSee example here of a netCDF file containing hybrid millidecade spectra.\n\nFile naming convention\n\nInclude the project, sound metric, deployment ID, and timestamp\n\nExample\n\nONMS_SB01_20220613_67678214.1.48000_20220615_DAILY_MILLIDEC_MinRes, which follows the format Project_Site_DeploymentID_SerialNum.ChannelNum.SampleRate_YYYYMMDD_SoundMetric\n\nDetections\n\nThe sound source targeted for detection will largely drive the methodology used to extract that signal. Characteristics of the signal such as frequency range and temporal duration need to be considered in that analysis. The desire to document presence/absence over a specific time period (for example, 1 hour or 1 day) or capture finer resolution event detection will further define the methods. DeAngelis et al., (2022) provides a good reference for comparing presence/absence of different detection types for multiple marine mammal species.\n\nFile format\n\nSee example here of a CSV containing detection of North Atlantic right whale upcalls\n\nFile naming convention\n\nInclude the project, deployment ID, and detected sound\n\nExamples\n\nNEFSC_GEORGES-BANK_201806_WAT-HZ_NARW\n\nSanctSound_CI01_01_vessel\n\nSound Propagation Models\n\nFile format\n\nThe recommended file format is netCDF\n\nSee example here of a netCDF containing sound propagation model results\n\nIf you have a different format, please contact pad.info@noaa.gov to ensure it can be archived\n\nFile naming convention\n\nInclude as much descriptive information as possible\n\nExample\n\nSanctSound_CI02_propmodeling_SD0001m_SL165dB_FQ01000Hz_Apr_radarformat_highres.nc where SD is the source depth, SL is the source level, and FQ is the frequency\n\nSound Clips\n\nFile format\n\nSee formatting requirements noted under Audio\n\nSee examples here of sound clip wav files\n\nFile naming conventions\n\nInclude the deployment, timestamp, and ideally also the sound(s) that the clip is highlighting\n\nExample\n\nSanctSound_MB01_04_bluewhaleAcall_20200124T031012Z_8xSpeed.wav\n\nThe graphic above depicts the key metadata components necessary to properly describe passive acoustic data and the stage of the data collection process that they are typically obtained. These metadata fields span high level project description to platform type to details on the hydrophone, preamplifier, and sampling details.\n\nIt is critical to have calibration information for the recording system. At a minimum, manufacturer specifications for the hydrophone must be provided. Additional lab-based calibration pre- and/or post-deployment are preferred. Check out the Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network (ADEON) Calibration and Deployment Good Practices Document for additional community-developed information on these topics.\n\nIn addition to the above project and deployment metadata, data products must also include information about the analysis time period, frequency range, processing method description, protocol references, software name(s) and version(s), and, if applicable, species name.\n\nSee below for example metadata landing pages and associated ISO 19115-2 compliant XML records for various archived datasets:\n\nAudio Files\n\nThe Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network (ADEON) Monitoring Project; XML\n\nThe Ocean Noise Reference Station Network; XML\n\nDerived Products\n\nSound Level Metrics\n\nBroadband Sound Pressure Levels at 1 Hour Resolution; XML\n\nOctave Band Sound Pressure Levels at 1 Hour Resolution; XML\n\nOne-third Octave Band Sound Pressure Levels at 1 Hour Resolution; XML\n\nSound Pressure Spectral Density at 1 Hertz and 1 Hour Resolution; XML\n\nDetections\n\nPresence/absence of dolphin sound production per hour; XML\n\nPresence/absence of fin whale sound production per day; XML\n\nDetection of red grouper sound production; XML\n\nDetection of vessel events; XML\n\nSound Propagation Model\n\nModels across a range of source levels and frequency, and time of year; XML\n\nA Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique and persistent string of characters to identify a digital dataset.\n\nA Data Citation is a unique and persistent set of text used to reference the dataset and includes the DOI.\n\nDOI weblinks resolve to the corresponding dataset overview that contains informative metadata such as data access points, time, location, dataset description, key personnel, and documentation.\n\nDOI Minting and Data Citations for datasets are completed by the NCEI passive acoustic archive team at a project- or dataset-level. The resolution of the citations are based on the needs of the data provider constrained by the NCEI passive acoustic archive practices, and are determined through discussions between the data provider and the NCEI passive acoustic archive team.\n\nThe citation for the entire NCEI passive acoustic data archive is as follows:\n\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. 2017. Passive Acoustic Data Collection. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. https://doi.org/10.25921/PF0H-SQ72. access date\n\nThis is an example of a project-level citation:\n\nNOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and U.S Navy. 2020. SanctSound Raw Passive Acoustic Data. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. https://doi.org/10.25921/saca-sp25 [access date].\n\nLastly, here is an example of a dataset-level citation:\n\nNOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and U.S Navy. 2021.

Expanding the Sound Clips list, allows the user to see the names of the 8 dataset names for the region in the Northeast constrained by the geographical range added. Clicking on the SB02_06 deployment dataset results in a window to pop up with detailed information associated with that dataset.\n\nData can be accessed from the archive by the two Request Data options listed. Request Data from NCEI results in a dialog box where you enter your name, organization, and email. The archive team is then notified of the requested datasets. The team will notify the requestor when the data are posted on ftp. This process is asynchronous. The Access Data from Google takes the user directly to the archive’s cloud-hosted copy on GCP. Data can be accessed immediately from this platform."
