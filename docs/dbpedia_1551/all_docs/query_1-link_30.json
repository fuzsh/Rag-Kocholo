We review the physics of gravitational waves, how they interact with detectors (bars and interferometers), and how these detectors operate. We study the most likely sources of gravitational waves and review the data analysis methods that are used to extract their signals from detector noise. Then we consider the consequences of gravitational wave detections and observations for physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.\n\nA New Window onto the Universe\n\nThe last six decades have witnessed a great revolution in astronomy, driven by improvements in observing capabilities across the electromagnetic spectrum: very large optical telescopes, radio antennas and arrays, a host of satellites to explore the infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray parts of the spectrum, and the development of key new technologies (CCDs, adaptive optics). Each new window of observation has brought new surprises that have dramatically changed our understanding of the universe. These serendipitous discoveries have included:\n\nthe relic cosmic microwave background radiation (Penzias and Wilson [287]), which has become our primary tool for exploring the Big Bang;\n\nthe fact that quasi-stellar objects are at cosmological distances (Maarten Schmidt [323]), which has developed into the understanding that they are powered by supermassive black holes;\n\npulsars (Hewish and Bell [189]), which opened up the study of neutron stars and illuminated one endpoint for stellar evolution;\n\nX-ray binary systems (Giacconi and collaborators [326]), which now enable us to make detailed studies of black holes and neutron stars;\n\ngamma-ray bursts coming from immense distances (Klebesadel et al. [216]), which are not fully explained even today;\n\nthe fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (two teams [313, 288]), which has led to the hunt for the nature of dark energy.\n\nNone of these discoveries was anticipated by the observing team, and in many cases the instruments were built to observe completely different phenomena.\n\nWithin a few years another new window on the universe will open up, with the first direct detection of gravitational waves. There is keen interest in observing gravitational waves directly, in order to test Einstein’s theory of general relativity and to observe some of the most exotic objects in nature, particularly black holes. But, in addition, the potential of gravitational wave observations to produce more surprises is very high.\n\nThe gravitational wave spectrum is completely distinct from, and complementary to, the electromagnetic spectrum. The primary emitters of electromagnetic radiation are charged elementary particles, mainly electrons; because of overall charge neutrality, electromagnetic radiation is typically emitted in small regions, with short wavelengths, and conveys direct information about the physical conditions of small portions of the astronomical sources. By contrast, gravitational waves are emitted by the cumulative mass and momentum of entire systems, so they have long wavelengths and convey direct information about large-scale regions. Electromagnetic waves couple strongly to charges and so are easy to detect but are also easily scattered or absorbed by material between us and the source; gravitational waves couple extremely weakly to matter, making them very hard to detect but also allowing them to travel to us substantially unaffected by intervening matter, even from the earliest moments of the Big Bang.\n\nThese contrasts, and the history of serendipitous discovery in astronomy, all suggest that electromagnetic observations may be poor predictors of the phenomena that gravitational wave detectors will eventually discover. Given that 96% of the mass-energy of the universe carries no charge, gravitational waves provide us with our first opportunity to observe directly a major part of the universe. It might turn out to be as complex and interesting as the charged minor component, the part that we call “normal” matter.\n\nSeveral long-baseline interferometric gravitational-wave detectors planned over a decade ago [Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) [18], GEO [244], VIRGO [109] and TAMA [363]] have begun initial operations [3, 245, 19] with unprecedented sensitivity levels and wide bandwidths at acoustic frequencies (10 Hz–10 kHz) [197]. These large interferometers are superseding a world-wide network of narrow-band resonant bar antennas that operated for several decades at frequencies near 1 kHz. Before 2020 the space-based LISA [71] gravitational wave detector may begin observations in the low-frequency band from 0.1 mHz to 0.1 Hz. This suite of detectors can be expected to open up the gravitational wave window for astronomical exploration, and at the same time perform stringent tests of general relativity in its strong-field dynamic sector.\n\nGravitational wave antennas are essentially omni-directional, with linearly polarized quadrupolar antenna patterns that typically have a response better than 50% of its average over 75% of the sky [197]. Their nearly all-sky sensitivity is an important difference from pointed astronomical antennas and telescopes. Gravitational wave antennas operate as a network, with the aim of taking data continuously. Ground-based interferometers can at present (2008) survey a volume of order 104 Mpc3 for inspiraling compact star binaries — among the most promising sources for these detectors — and plan to enhance their range more than tenfold with two major upgrades (to enhanced and then advanced detectors) during the period 2009–2014. For the advanced detectors, there is great confidence that the resulting thousandfold volume increase will produce regular detections. It is this second phase of operation that will be more interesting from the astrophysical point of view, bringing us physical and astrophysical insights into populations of neutron star and black hole binaries, supernovae and formation of compact objects, populations of isolated compact objects in our galaxy, and potentially even completely unexpected systems. Following that, LISA’s ability to survey the entire universe for black hole coalescences at milliHertz frequencies will extend gravitational wave astronomy into the cosmological arena.\n\nHowever, the present initial phase of observation, or observations after the first enhancements, may very well produce the first detections. Potential sources include coalescences of binaries consisting of black holes at a distance of 100–200 Mpc and spinning neutron stars in our galaxy with ellipticities greater than about 10−6. Observations even at this initial level may, of course, also reveal new sources not observable in any other way. These initial detections, though not expected to be frequent, would be important from the fundamental physics point of view and could enable us to directly test general relativity in the strongly nonlinear regime.\n\nGravitational wave detectors register gravitational waves coherently by following the phase of the wave and not just measuring its intensity. Since the phase is determined by large-scale motions of matter inside the sources, much of the astrophysical information is extracted from the phase. This leads to different kinds of data analysis methods than one normally encounters in astronomy, based on matched filtering and searches over large parameter spaces of potential signals. This style of data analysis requires the input of pre-calculated template signals, which means that gravitational wave detection depends more strongly than most other branches of astronomy on theoretical input. The better the input, the greater the range of the detectors.\n\nThe fact that detectors are omni-directional and detect coherently the phase of the incoming wave makes them in many ways more like microphones for sound than like conventional telescopes. The analogy with sound can be helpful, since microphones can be used to monitor environments for disturbances in any location, and since when we listen to sounds our brains do a form of matched filtering to allow us to interpret the sounds we want to understand against a background of noise. In a very real sense, gravitational wave detectors will be listening to the sounds of a restless universe. The gravitational wave “window” will actually be a listening post, a monitor for the most dramatic events that occur in the universe.\n\nBirth of gravitational astronomy\n\nGravity is the dominant interaction in most astronomical systems. The big surprise of the last three decades of the 20th century was that relativistic gravitation is relevant in so many of these systems. Strong gravitational fields are Nature’s most efficient converters of mass into energy. Examples where strong-field relativistic gravity is important include the following:\n\nneutron stars, the residue of supernova explosions, represent up to 0.1% (by number) of the entire stellar population of any galaxy;\n\nstellar-mass black holes power many binary X-ray sources and tend to concentrate near the centers of globular clusters;\n\nmassive black holes in the range 106–109 M⊙ seem almost ubiquitous in galaxies that have central bulges, and power active galaxies, quasars, and giant radio jets;\n\nand, of course, the Big Bang is the only naked singularity we expect to be able to see.\n\nMost of these systems are either dynamical or were formed in catastrophic events; many are or were, therefore, strong sources of gravitational radiation. As the 21st century opens, we are on the threshold of using this radiation to gain a new perspective on the observable universe.\n\nThe theory of gravitational radiation already makes an important contribution to the understanding of a number of astronomical systems, such as neutron star binaries, cataclysmic variables, young neutron stars, low-mass X-ray binaries, and even the anisotropy of the microwave background radiation. As the understanding of relativistic phenomena improves, it can be expected that gravitational radiation will play a crucial role as a theoretical tool in modeling relativistic astrophysical systems.\n\nWhat this review is about\n\nThe first three-quarters of the 20th century were required to place the mathematical theory of gravitational radiation on a sound footing. Many of the most fundamental constructs in general relativity, such as null infinity and the theory of conserved quantities, were developed at least in part to help solve the technical problems of gravitational radiation. We will not cover this history here, for which there are excellent reviews [259, 132]. There are still many open questions, since it is impossible to construct exact solutions for most interesting situations. For example, we still lack a full understanding of the two-body problem, and we will review the theoretical work on this problem below. But the fundamentals of the theory of gravitational radiation are no longer in doubt. Indeed, the observation of the orbital decay in the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 [388] has lent irrefutable support to the correctness of the theoretical foundations aimed at computing gravitational wave emission, in particular to the energy and angular momentum carried away by the radiation.\n\nIt is, therefore, to be expected that the evolution of astrophysical systems under the influence of strong tidal gravitational fields will be associated with the emission of gravitational waves. Consequently, these systems are of interest both to a physicist, whose aim is to understand fundamental interactions in nature, their inter-relationships and theories describing them, and to an astrophysicist, who wants to dig deeper into the environs of dense or nonlinearly gravitating systems in solving the mysteries associated with relativistic phenomena listed in Sections 6, 7 and 8. Indeed, some of the gravitational wave antennas that are being built are capable of observing systems to cosmological distances, and even to the edge of the universe. The new window, therefore, is also of interest to cosmologists.\n\nThis is a living review of the prospects that lie ahead for gravitational antennas to test the predictions of general relativity as a fundamental theory, for using relativistic gravitation as a means to understand highly energetic sources, for interpreting gravitational waves to uncover the (electromagnetically) dark universe, and ultimately for employing networks of gravitational wave detectors to observe the first fraction of a second of the evolution of the universe.\n\nWe begin in Section 2 with a brief review of the physical nature of gravitational waves, giving a heuristic derivation of the formulas involved in the calculation of the gravitational wave observables such as the amplitude, frequency and luminosity of gravitational waves. This is followed in Section 3 by a discussion of the astronomical sources of gravitational waves, their expected event rates, amplitudes, waveforms and spectra. In Section 4 we then give a detailed description of the existing and upcoming gravitational wave antennas and their sensitivity. Included in Section 4 are bar and interferometric antennas covering both ground and space-based experiments. Section 4 also compares the sensitivity of the antennas with the strengths of astronomical sources and expected signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We then turn in Section 5 to data analysis, which is a central component of gravitational wave astronomy, focusing on those aspects of analysis that are crucial in gleaning physical, astrophysical and cosmological information from gravity wave observations.\n\nSections 7–9 treat in some detail how gravitational wave observations will aid in a better understanding of nonlinear gravity and test some of its fundamental predictions. In Section 6 we review the physics implications of gravitational wave observations, including new tests of general relativity that can be performed via gravitational wave observations, how these observations may help in formulating and gaining insight into the two-body problem in general relativity, and how gravitational wave observations may help to probe the structure of the universe and the nature of dark energy. In Section 7 we look at the astronomical information returned by gravitational wave observations, and how these observations will affect our understanding of black holes, neutron stars, supernovae, and other relativistic phenomena. Section 8 is devoted to the cosmological implications of gravitational wave observations, including placing constraints on inflation, early phase transitions associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\nThis review is by no means exhaustive. We plan to expand it to include other key topics in gravitational wave astronomy with subsequent revisions.\n\nUnless otherwise specified we shall use a system of units in which c = G = 1, which means 1 M⊙ ≃ 5 × 10−6 s ≃ 1.5 km, 1 Mpc ≃ 1014 s. We shall assume a universe with cold dark-matter density of ΩM = 0.3, dark energy of ΩΛ = 0.7, and a Hubble constant of H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.\n\nGravitational Wave Observables\n\nTo benefit from gravitational wave observations we must first understand what are the attributes of gravitational waves that we can observe. This section is devoted to a short discussion of the nature of gravitational radiation.\n\nGravitational field vs gravitational waves\n\nGravitational waves are propagating oscillations of the gravitational field, just as light and radio waves are propagating oscillations of the electromagnetic field. Whereas light and radio waves are emitted by accelerated electrically-charged particles, gravitational waves are emitted by accelerated masses. However, since there is only one sign of mass, gravitational waves never exist on their own: they are never more than a small part of the overall external gravitational field of the emitter. One may wonder, therefore, how it is possible to infer the presence of an astronomical body by the gravitational waves that it emits, when it is clearly not possible to sense its much larger stationary (essentially Newtonian) gravitational potential. There are, in fact, two reasons:\n\nIn general relativity, the effects of both the stationary field and gravitational radiation are described by the tidal forces they produce on free test masses. In other words, single geodesics alone cannot detect gravity or gravitational radiation; we need at least a pair of geodesics. While the stationary tidal force due to the Newtonian potential ϕ of a self-gravitating source at a distance r falls off as ∇∇ϕ ∼ r−3, the tidal force due to the gravitational wave amplitude h that it emits at wavelength λ decreases as ∇∇h ∼ r−1λ−2. Therefore, the stationary coulomb gravitational potential is the dominant tidal force close to the gravitating body (in the near zone, where r ≤ λ). However, in the far zone (r ≫ λ) the tidal effect of the waves is much stronger.\n\nThe stationary part of the tidal field is a DC effect, and simply adds to the stationary tidal forces of all other objects in the universe. It is not possible to discriminate one source from another. Gravitational waves carry time-dependent tidal forces, and so they can be discriminated from the stationary field if one knows what kind of time dependence to look for. Interferometers are ideal detectors in this respect because they sense only changes in the position of an interference fringe, which makes them insensitive to the DC part of the tidal field.\n\nBecause gravitational waves couple so weakly to our detectors, those astronomical sources that we can detect must be extremely luminous in gravitational radiation. Even at the distance of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, a detectable source could be as luminous as the full Moon, if only for a millisecond! Indeed, while radio astronomers deal with flux levels of Jy, mJy and even μJy, in the case of gravitational wave sources we encounter fluxes that are typically 1020 Jy or larger. Gravitational wave astronomy therefore is biased toward looking for highly energetic, even catastrophic, events.\n\nExtracting useful physical, astrophysical and cosmological information from gravitational wave observations is made possible by measuring a number of gravitational wave attributes that are related to the properties of the source. In the rest of this section we discuss those attributes of gravitational radiation that can be measured via gravitational wave observations. In the process we will review the basic formulas used in computing the gravitational wave amplitude and luminosity of a source. These will then be used in Section 3 to make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the strength of astronomical sources of gravitational waves.\n\nGravitational wave polarizations\n\nBecause of the equivalence principle, single isolated particles cannot be used to measure gravitational waves: they fall freely in any gravitational field and experience no effects from the passage of the wave. Instead, one must look for inhomogeneities in the gravitational field, which are the tidal forces carried by the waves, and which can be measured only by comparing the positions or interactions of two or more particles.\n\nIn general relativity, gravitational radiation is represented by a second rank, symmetric trace-free tensor. In a general coordinate system, and in an arbitrary gauge (coordinate choice), this tensor has ten independent components. However, as in the electromagnetic case, gravitational radiation has only two independent states of polarization in Einstein’s theory: the plus polarization and the cross polarization (the names being derived from the shape of the equivalent force fields that they produce). In contrast to electromagnetic waves, the angle between the two polarization states is π/4 rather than π/2. This is illustrated in Figure , where the response of a ring of free particles in the (x, y) plane to plus-polarized and cross-polarized gravitational waves traveling in the z-direction is shown. The effect of the waves is to cause a tidal deformation of the circular ring into an elliptical ring with the same area. This tidal deformation caused by passing gravitational waves is the basic principle behind the construction of gravitational wave antennas.\n\nThe two independent polarizations of gravitational waves are denoted h+ and h×. These are the two primary time-dependent observables of a gravitational wave. The polarization of gravitational waves from a source, such as a binary system, depends on the orientation of the dynamics inside the source relative to the observer. Therefore, measuring the polarization provides information about, for example, the orientation of the binary system.\n\nDirection to a source\n\nGravitational wave antennas are linearly-polarized quadrupolar detectors and do not have good directional sensitivity. As a result we cannot deduce the direction to a source using a single antenna. One normally needs simultaneous observation using three or more detectors so that the source can be triangulated in the sky by measuring the time differences in signal arrival times at various detectors in a network. Ground-based detectors have typical separation baselines of L ∼ 3 × 106 m, so that at a wavelength of λ = 3 × 105 m = 1 ms (a frequency of 1 kHz) the network has a resolution of δθ = λ/L = 0.1 rad. If the amplitude SNR is high, then one can localize the source by a factor of 1/SNR better than this.\n\nFor long-lived sources, however, a single antenna synthesizes many antennas by observing the source at different points along its orbit around the sun. The baseline for such observations is 2 AU, so that, for a source emitting radiation at 1 kHz, the resolution is as good as Δθ = 10−6 rad, which is smaller than an arcsecond.\n\nFor space-based detectors orbiting the sun, like LISA, the baseline is again 2 AU, but the observing frequency is some five or six orders of magnitude lower, so the basic resolution is only of order 1 radian. However, as we shall see later, some of the sources that a space-based detector will observe have huge amplitude SNRs in the range of SNR ∼ 103–104, which improves the resolution to arcminute accuracies in the best cases.\n\nAmplitude of gravitational waves — the quadrupole approximation\n\nThe Einstein equations are too difficult to solve analytically in the generic case of a strongly gravitating source to compute the luminosity and amplitude of gravitational waves from an astronomical source. We will discuss numerical solutions later; the most powerful available analytic approach is called the post-Newtonian approximation scheme. This approximation is suited to gravitationally-bound systems, which constitute the majority of expected sources. In this scheme [79, 169], solutions are expanded in the small parameter (v/c)2, where v is the typical dynamical speed inside the system. Because of the virial theorem, the dimensionless Newtonian gravitational potential ϕ/c2 is of the same order, so that the expansion scheme links orders in the expanded metric with those in the expanded source terms. The lowest-order post-Newtonian approximation for the emitted radiation is the quadrupole formula, and it depends only on the density (ρ) and velocity fields of the Newtonian system. If we define the spatial tensor Qjk, the second moment of the mass distribution, by the equation\n\n1\n\nthen the amplitude of the emitted gravitational wave is, at lowest order, the three-tensor\n\n2\n\nThis is to be interpreted as a linearized gravitational wave in the distant almost-flat geometry far from the source, in a coordinate system (gauge) called the Lorentz gauge.\n\nWave amplitudes and polarization in TT-gauge\n\nA useful specialization of the Lorentz gauge is the TT-gauge, which is a comoving coordinate system: free particles remain at constant coordinate locations, even as their proper separations change. To get the TT-amplitude of a wave traveling outwards from its source, project the tensor in Equation (2) perpendicular to its direction of travel and remove the trace of the projected tensor. The result of doing this to a symmetric tensor is to produce, in the transverse plane, a two-dimensional matrix with only two independent elements:\n\n3\n\nThis is the definition of the wave amplitudes h+ and h× that are illustrated in Figure . These amplitudes are referred to as the coordinates chosen for that plane. If the coordinate unit basis vectors in this plane are êx and êy, then we can define the basis tensors\n\n4\n\n5\n\nIn terms of these, the TT-gravitational wave tensor can be written as\n\n6\n\nIf the coordinates in the transverse plane are rotated by an angle ψ, then one obtains new amplitudes h′+ and h′× given by\n\n7\n\n8\n\nThis shows the quadrupolar nature of the polarizations, and is consistent with our remark in association with Figure that a rotation of π/4 changes one polarization into the other.\n\nIt should be clear from the TT projection operation that the emitted radiation is not isotropic: it will be stronger in some directions than in others1. It should also be clear from this that spherically-symmetric motions do not emit any gravitational radiation: when the trace is removed, nothing remains.\n\nSimple estimates\n\nA typical component of d2Qjk/dt2 will (from Equation (1)) have magnitude (Mv2)nonsph, where (Mv2)nonsph is twice the nonspherical part of the kinetic energy inside the source. So a bound on any component of Equation (2) is\n\n9\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the ratio ϵ of the wave amplitude to the Newtonian potential ϕext of its source at the observer’s distance r is simply bounded by\n\nand this bound is attained if the entire mass of the source is involved in the nonspherical motions, so that . By the virial theorem for self-gravitating bodies\n\n10\n\nwhere ϕint is the maximum value of the Newtonian gravitational potential inside the system. This provides a convenient bound in practice [328]:\n\n11\n\nThe bound is attained if the system is highly nonspherical. An equal-mass star binary system is a good example of a system that attains this bound.\n\nFor a neutron star source, one has ϕint ∼ 0.2. If the star is in the Virgo cluster (r ∼ 18 Mpc) and has a mass of 1.4 M⊙, and if it is formed in a highly-nonspherical gravitational collapse, then the upper limit on the amplitude of the radiation from such an event is 1.5 × 10−21. This is a simple way to get the number that has been the goal of detector development for decades, to make detectors that can observe waves at or below an amplitude of about 10−21.\n\nFrequency of gravitational waves\n\nThe signals for which the best waveform predictions are available have well-defined frequencies. In some cases the frequency is dominated by an existing motion, such as the spin of a pulsar. But in most cases the frequency will be related to the natural frequency for a self-gravitating body, defined as\n\n12\n\nwhere is the mean density of mass-energy in the source. This is of the same order as the binary orbital frequency and the fundamental pulsation frequency of the body. Even though this is a Newtonian formula, it provides a remarkably good order-of-magnitude prediction of natural frequencies, even for highly relativistic systems such as black holes.\n\nThe frequency of the emitted gravitational waves need not be the natural frequency, of course, even if the mechanism is an oscillation with that frequency. In many cases, such as binary systems, the radiation comes out at twice the oscillation frequency. But since, at this point, we are not trying to be more accurate than a few factors, we will ignore this distinction here. In later sections, with specific source models, we will get the factors right.\n\nThe mean density and hence the frequency are determined by the size R and mass M of the source, taking . For a neutron star of mass 1.4 M⊙ and radius 10 km, the natural frequency is f0 = 1.9 kHz. For a black hole of mass 10 M⊙ and radius 2M = 30 km, it is f0 = 1 kHz. And for a large black hole of mass 2.5 × 106 M⊙, such as the one at the center of our galaxy, this goes down in inverse proportion to the mass to f0 = 4 mHz. In general, the characteristic frequency of the radiation of a compact object of mass M and radius R is\n\n13\n\nFigure shows the mass-radius diagram for likely sources of gravitational waves. Three lines of constant natural frequency are plotted: f0 = 104 Hz, f0 = 1 Hz, and f0 = 10−4 Hz. These are interesting frequencies from the point of view of observing techniques: gravitational waves between 1 and 104 Hz are in principle accessible to ground-based detectors, while lower frequencies are observable only from space. Also shown is the line marking the black-hole boundary. This has the equation R = 2M. There are no objects below this line, because they would be smaller than the horizon size for their mass. This line cuts through the ground-based frequency band in such a way as to restrict ground-based instruments to looking at stellar-mass objects. No system with a mass above about 104 M⊙ can produce quadrupole radiation in the ground-based frequency band.\n\nA number of typical relativistic objects are placed in the diagram: a neutron star, a pair of neutron stars that spiral together as they orbit, some black holes. Two other interesting lines are drawn. The lower (dashed) line is the 1-year coalescence line, where the orbital shrinking timescale due to gravitational radiation backreaction (cf. Equation (28)) is less than one year. The upper (solid) line is the 1-year chirp line: if a binary lies below this line, then its orbit will shrink enough to make its orbital frequency increase by a measurable amount in one year. (In a one-year observation one can, in principle, measure changes in frequency of 1 yr−1, or 3 × 10−8 Hz.)\n\nIt is clear from the Figure that any binary system that is observed from the ground will coalesce within an observing time of one year. Since pulsar binary statistics suggest that neutron-star-binary coalescences happen less often than once every 105 years in our galaxy, ground-based detectors must be able to register these events in a volume of space containing at least 106 galaxies in order to have a hope of seeing occasional coalescences. That corresponds to a volume of radius roughly 100 Mpc. For comparison, first-generation ground-based interferometric detectors have a reach of around 20 Mpc for such binaries, while advanced interferometers should extend that to about 200 Mpc.\n\nLuminosity in gravitational waves\n\nThe general formula for the local stress-energy of a gravitational wave field propagating through flat spacetime, using the TT-gauge, is given by the Isaacson expression [259, 332]\n\n14\n\nwhere the angle brackets denote averages over regions of the size of a wavelength and times of the length of a period of the wave. The energy flux of a wave in the xi direction is the T0i component.\n\nThe gravitational wave luminosity in the quadrupole approximation is obtained by integrating the energy flux from Equation (14) over a distant sphere. When one correctly takes into account the projection factors mentioned after Equation (2), one obtains [259]\n\n15\n\nwhere Q is the trace of the matrix Qjk. This equation can be used to estimate the backreaction effect on a system that emits gravitational radiation.\n\nNotice that the expression for Lgw is dimensionless when c = G = 1. It can be converted to normal luminosity units by multiplying by the scale factor\n\n16\n\nThis is an enormous luminosity. By comparison, the luminosity of the sun is only 3.8 × 1026 W, and that of a typical galaxy would be 1037 W. All the galaxies in the visible universe emit, in visible light, on the order of 1049 W. We will see that gravitational wave systems always emit at a fraction of L0, but that the gravitational wave luminosity can come close to L0 and can greatly exceed typical electromagnetic luminosities. Close binary systems normally radiate much more energy in gravitational waves than in light. Black hole mergers can, during their peak few cycles, compete in luminosity with the steady luminosity of the entire universe!\n\nCombining Equations (2) and (15) one can derive a simple expression for the apparent luminosity of radiation , at great distances from the source, in terms of the gravitational wave amplitude [332]:\n\n17\n\nThe above relation can be used to make an order-of-magnitude estimate of the gravitational wave amplitude from a knowledge of the rate at which energy is emitted by a source in the form of gravitational waves. If a source at a distance r radiates away energy E in a time T, predominantly at a frequency f, then writing ḣ = 2πfh and noting that , the amplitude of gravitational waves is\n\n18\n\nWhen the time development of a signal is known, one can filter the detector output through a copy of the expected signal (see Section 5 on matched filtering). This leads to an enhancement in the SNR, as compared to its narrow-band value, by roughly the square root of the number of cycles the signal spends in the detector band. It is useful, therefore, to define an effective amplitude of a signal, which is a better measure of its detectability than its raw amplitude:\n\n19\n\nNow, a signal lasting for a time T around a frequency f would produce n ≃ fT cycles. Using this we can eliminate T from Equation (18) and get the effective amplitude of the signal in terms of the energy, the emitted frequency and the distance to the source:\n\n20\n\nNotice that this depends on the energy only through the total fluence, or time-integrated flux E/4πr2 of the wave. As in many other branches of astronomy, the detectability of a source is ultimately a function of its apparent luminosity and the observing time. However, one should not ignore the dependence on frequency in this formula. Two sources with the same fluence are not equally easy to detect if they are at different frequencies: higher frequency signals have smaller amplitudes.\n\nSources of Gravitational Waves\n\nMan-made sources\n\nOne source can unfortunately be ruled out as undetectable: man-made gravitational radiation. Imagine creating a wave generator with the following extreme properties. It consists of two masses of 103 kg each (a small car) at opposite ends of a beam 10 m long. At its center the beam pivots about an axis. This centrifuge rotates 10 times per second. All the velocity is nonspherical, so in Equation (9) is about 105 m2 s−2. The frequency of the waves will actually be 20 Hz, since the mass distribution of the system is periodic in time with a period of half the rotation period. The wavelength of the waves will, therefore, be 1.5 × 107 m, similar to the diameter of the earth. In order to detect gravitational waves, not near-zone Newtonian gravity, the detector must be at least one wavelength from the source, say diametrically opposite the centrifuge on the Earth. Then the amplitude h can be deduced from Equation (9): h ≃ 5 × 10−43. This is far too small to contemplate detecting! The story changes, fortunately, when we consider astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, where nature arranges for masses that are 1027 times larger than our centrifuge to move at speeds close to the speed of light!\n\nUntil observations of gravitational waves are successfully made, one can only make intelligent guesses about most of the sources that will be seen. There are many that could be strong enough to be seen by the early detectors: star binaries, supernova explosions, neutron stars, the early universe. In this section, we make rough luminosity estimates using the quadrupole formula and other approximations, which are usually accurate to within factors of order two, and, very importantly, they show how key observables scale with the properties of the systems. Where appropriate we also make use of predictions from the much more accurate modelling that is available for some sources, such as binary systems and black hole mergers. The detectability depends, of course, not only on the intrinsic luminosity of the source, but on how far away it is. Often the biggest uncertainties in making predictions are the spatial density and event rate of any particular class of sources. This is not surprising, since our information at present comes from electromagnetic observations, and as our earlier remarks about the differences between the mechanisms of emission of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation make clear, electromagnetic observations may not strongly constrain the source population.\n\nGravitational wave bursts from gravitational collapse\n\nNeutron stars and black holes are formed from the gravitational collapse of a highly evolved star or the core collapse of an accreting white dwarf. In either case, if the collapse is nonspherical, perhaps induced by strong rotation, then gravitational waves could carry away some of the binding energy and angular momentum depending on the geometry of the collapse. Collapse events are thought to produce supernovae of various types, and increasingly there is evidence that they also produce most of the observed gamma-ray bursts [191] in hypernovae and collapsars [397, 249]. Supernovae of Type II are believed to occur at a rate of between 0.1 and 0.01 per year in a milky-way equivalent galaxy (MWEG); thus, within the Virgo supercluster, we might expect an event rate of about 30 per year. Hypernova events are considerably rarer and might only contribute observable gravitational-wave events in current and near-future detectors if they involve so much rotation that strong non-axisymmetric instabilities are triggered.\n\nSimulating gravitational collapse is a very active area of numerical astrophysics, and most simulations also predict the energy and spectral characteristics of the emitted gravitational waves [167]. However, it is still beyond the capabilities of computers to simulate a gravitational collapse event with all the physics that might be necessary to give reliable predictions: three-dimensional hydrodynamics, neutrino transport, realistic nuclear physics, magnetic fields, rotation. In fact, it is still by no means clear why Type II supernovae explode at all: simulations typically have great difficulty reversing the inflow and producing an explosion with the observed light-curves and energetics. It may be that the answer lies in some of the physics that has to be oversimplified in order to be used in current simulations, or in some neutrino physics that we do not yet know, or in some unexplored hydrodynamic mechanism [276]. In a typical supernova, simulations suggest that gravitational waves might extract between about 10−7 and 10−5 of the total available mass-energy [264, 147, 148], and the waves could come off in a burst whose frequency might lie in the range of ∼ 200–1000 Hz.\n\nWe can use Equation (18) to make a rough estimate of the amplitude, if the emitted energy and timescale are known. Using representative values for a supernova in our galaxy, lying at 10 kpc, emitting the energy equivalent of 10−7 M⊙ at a frequency of 1 kHz, and lasting for 1 ms, the received amplitude would be\n\n21\n\nThe upper bound in Equation (11) would give the same amplitude for a source 60 times further away, which reflects the fact that simulations find it difficult to put significant energy into gravitational waves. This amplitude is large enough for current ground-based detectors to observe with a reasonably high confidence, but of course the event rate within 10 kpc is expected to be far too small to make an early detection likely.\n\nGravitational wave pulsars\n\nSome likely gravitational wave sources behave like the centrifuge example we used in the first paragraph of this section, only on a grander scale. Suppose a neutron star of radius R and mass M spins with a frequency f and has an irregularity, a deformation of its otherwise axially symmetric shape. We idealize this as a “bump” of mass m on its surface, although of course it will really be a distribution of mass leading to an asymmetrical quadrupole tensor. The moment of inertia of the bump will be mR2, and it is conventional to parameterize the bump in terms of the fractional asymmetry it creates in the moment of inertia tensor itself. If we idealize the star as having uniform density, then the spherical moment of inertia is 2 M R2/5, and so the bump has fractional asymmetry\n\n22\n\nThe bump will emit gravitational radiation at frequency 2f because the star spins about its net center of mass, so it effectively has mass excesses on both sides of the star. The nonspherical velocity will be just vnonsph = 2πRf. The radiation amplitude will be, from Equation (9),\n\n23\n\nand the luminosity, from Equation (15) (assuming that roughly four comparable components of Qjk contribute to the sum),\n\nThe radiated energy would presumably come from the rotational energy of the star Mv2/5. This would lead to a spindown of the star on a timescale\n\n24\n\nIt is believed that neutron star crusts are not strong enough to support fractional asymmetries larger than about ϵ ∼ 10−6 [370], and realistic asymmetries may be much smaller.\n\nFrom these considerations one can estimate the likelihood that the observed spindown timescales of pulsars are due to gravitational radiation. In most cases, it seems that gravitational wave losses could account for a substantial amount of the spindown: the required asymmetries are much smaller than 10−4, often smaller than 10−7. But an interesting exception is the Crab pulsar, PSR J0534+2200, whose young age and consequently short spindown time (measured to be 8.0 × 1010 s, about 2500 yr) would require an exceptionally large asymmetry. If we take the neutron star’s radius to be 10 km, so that M/R ∼ 0.21 and the speed of any irregularity is v/c ∼ 6.2 × 10−3, then Equation (24) would require an asymmetry of ϵ ∼ 1.4 × 10−3. Of course, we have made a lot of approximations to get here, only keeping our estimates of amplitudes and energies correct to within factors of two, but a more careful calculation reduces this only by a factor of two to ϵ ∼ 7 × 10−4 [12]. What makes this interesting is the fact that an asymmetry this large would produce radiation detectable by first-generation interferometers. Conversely, an upper limit from first-generation interferometers would provide direct observational limits on the asymmetry and on the fraction of energy lost by the Crab pulsar to gravitational waves.\n\nFrom Equation (23) the Crab pulsar would, if its spindown is dominated by gravitational wave losses, produce an amplitude at the Earth of h ∼ 1.5 × 10−24, if its distance is 2 kpc. Is this detectable when present instruments are only capable of seeing millisecond bursts of radiation at levels of 10−21? The answer is yes, if the observation time is long enough. Indeed, the latest LIGO observations have not detected any gravitational waves from the Crab pulsar, which has been used to set an upper limit on the asymmetry in its mass distribution [12]. The limit depends on the model assumed for the pulsar. If one assumes that gravitational waves are produced at exactly twice the pulsar spin frequency and uses the inferred values of the pulsar orientation and polarization angle, then for a canonical value of the moment-of-inertia I = 1038 kg m2, one gets an upper limit on the ellipticity of ϵ ≤ 1.8 × 10−4, assuming the pulsar is at 2 kpc. This is a factor of 4.2 below the spindown limit [12]. If, however, one assumes that gravitational waves are emitted at a frequency close, but not exactly equal, to twice the spin frequency and one uses a uniform prior for the orientation and polarization angle, then one gets ϵ ≤ 9 × 10−4, which is 0.8 of the limit derived from the spin-down rate.\n\nIndeed, even signals weaker than the amplitude determined by the Crab spindown rate will be observable by present detectors, and these may be coming from a larger variety of neutron stars, in particular low-mass X-ray binary systems (LMXBs). The neutron stars in them are accreting mass and angular momentum, so they should be spinning up. Observations suggest that most neutron stars are spinning at speeds between about 300 and 600 Hz, far below their maximum, which is greater than 1000 Hz. The absence of faster stars suggests that something stops them from spinning up beyond this range. Bildsten suggested [77] that the limiting mechanism may be the re-radiation of the accreted angular momentum in gravitational waves, possibly due to a quadrupole moment created by asymmetrical heating induced by the accreted matter. Another possible mechanism [285] is that a “bump” of the kind we have treated is formed by accreting matter channeled onto the surface by the star’s magnetic field. It is also possible that accretion drives an instability in the star that leads to steady emission [308, 270]. In either case, the stars could turn out to be long-lived sources of gravitational waves. This idea, which is a variant of one proposed long ago by Wagoner [383], is still speculative, but the numbers make a plausible case. We discuss it in more detail in Section 7.3.5.\n\nRadiation from a binary star system\n\nRadiation from a binary system and its backreaction\n\nA binary star system can also be treated as a “centrifuge”. Two stars of the same mass m in a circular orbit of radius R have all their mass in nonspherical motion, so that\n\nwhere Ω is the orbital angular velocity. The gravitational wave amplitude can then be written\n\n25\n\nSince the internal radius R of the orbit is not an observable, it is sometimes convenient to replace R by the orbital angular frequency Ω using the above orbit equation, giving\n\n26\n\nThe gravitational wave luminosity of such a system is, by a calculation analogous to that for bumps on neutron stars (assuming that four components of Qij to be significant),\n\n27\n\nin units given by the fundamental luminosity L0 in Equation (16). This shows that self-gravitating systems always emit at a fraction of L0, since M/R is always smaller than 1, but it can approach L0 for highly-relativistic systems where M/R ∼ 1.\n\nThe radiation of energy by the orbital motion causes the orbit to shrink. The shrinking will make any observed gravitational waves increase in frequency with time. This is called a chirp. The timescale2 for this in a binary system with equal masses is\n\n28\n\nAs the binary evolves, the frequency and amplitude of the wave grow and this drives the binary to evolve even more rapidly. The signal’s frequency, however, will not increase indefinitely; the slow inspiral phase ends either when the stars begin to interact and merge or (if they are very compact) when the distance between the stars is roughly at the last stable orbit (LSO) R = 6M, which corresponds to a gravitational wave frequency of\n\n29\n\nwhere we have normalized this to a binary with M = 20 M⊙. This is the last stable orbit (LSO) frequency.\n\nA compact-object binary that coalesces after passing through the last stable orbit is a powerful source of gravitational waves, with a luminosity that approaches the limiting luminosity L0. This is called a coalescing binary in gravitational wave searches. Since a typical search might last on the order of one year, a coalescing binary can be defined as a system that has a chirp time smaller than one year. In Figure the coalescence line is shown as a straight line with slope 3/4 (set tchirp to a constant in Equation (28)). Binary systems below this line have a chirp time smaller than one year. It is evident from the figure that all binary systems observable by ground-based detectors will coalesce in less than a year.\n\nAs mentioned for gravitational wave pulsars, the raw amplitude of the radiation from a long-lived system is not by itself a good guide to its detectability, if the waveform can be predicted. Data analysis techniques like matched filtering are able to eliminate most of the detector noise and allow the recognition of weaker signals. The improvement in amplitude sensitivity is roughly proportional to the square root of the number of cycles of the waveform that one observes. For neutron stars that are observed from a frequency of 10 Hz until they coalesce, there could be on the order of 104 cycles, meaning that the sensitivity of a second-generation interferometric detector would effectively be 100 times better than its broadband (prefiltering) sensitivity. Such detectors could see typical coalescences at ∼ 200 Mpc. The event rate for second-generation detectors is estimated at around 40 events per year, with rather large error bars [101, 211, 242].\n\nChirping binaries as standard sirens\n\nWhen we consider real binaries we must do the calculation for systems that have unequal masses. Still assuming for the moment that the binary orbit is circular, the quadrupole amplitude turns out to be\n\n30\n\nwhere we define the chirp mass as\n\n31\n\nwith μ the reduced mass, M the total mass and ν the symmetric mass ratio. We have left out of Equation (30) a factor of order one that depends on the angle from which the binary system is viewed. The two polarization amplitudes can be found in Equation (132).\n\nRemarkably, the other observable, namely the shrinking of the orbit as measured by the rate of change of the orbital frequency Pb also depends on the masses just through [290]:\n\n32\n\nIn this case, the chirp time is\n\n33\n\nThis is just the equal-mass chirp time of Equation (28) scaled inversely with the symmetric mass ratio ν = m1m2/M2. From this equation it is clear that systems with large mass ratios between the components can spend a long time in highly relativistic orbits, whereas equal-mass binaries can be expected to merge after only a few orbits in the highly relativistic regime.\n\nIf one observes Pb and Ṗb, one can infer from Equation (32). Then, from the observed amplitude in Equation (30), the only remaining unknown is the distance r to the source. Gravitational wave observations of orbits that shrink because of gravitational energy losses can therefore directly determine the distance to the source [329]. By analogy with the “standard candles” of electromagnetic astronomy, these systems are now being called “standard sirens”. Although our calculation here assumed an equal-mass circular system, the conclusion is robust: any binary, even with ellipticity and extreme mass ratio, encodes its distance in its gravitational wave signal.\n\nThis is another way in which gravitational wave observations are complementary to electromagnetic ones, providing information that is hard to obtain electromagnetically. One consequence is the possibility that observations of coalescing compact object binaries could allow one to measure the Hubble constant [329] or other cosmological parameters. This will be particularly interesting for the LISA project, whose observations of black hole binaries could contribute an independent measurement of the acceleration of the universe [195, 131, 48].\n\nBecause chirping systems are so interesting we have also drawn, in Figure , a line where the chirp time can be measured in one year. This means that the change in frequency due to the chirp must be larger than the frequency resolution 1 yr−1. A little algebra shows that the condition for the chirp to be resolved in an observation time T in a binary with period Pb is\n\n34\n\nSince Pb ∝ R3/2M−1/2, this condition leads to a line of slope 7/11 in the logarithmic plot in Figure . The line drawn there corresponds to a resolution time T of one year. All binaries below this line will chirp in a short enough time for their distances to be measured.\n\nBinary pulsar tests of gravitational radiation theory\n\nThe most famous example of the effects of gravitational radiation on an orbiting system is the Hulse-Taylor Binary Pulsar, PSR B1913+16. In this system, two neutron stars orbit in a close eccentric orbit. The pulsar provides a regular clock that allows one to deduce, from post-Newtonian effects, all the relevant orbital parameters and the masses of the stars. The key to the importance of this binary system is that all of the important parameters of the system can be measured before one takes account of the orbital shrinking due to gravitational radiation reaction. This is because a number of post-Newtonian effects on the arrival time of pulses at the Earth, such as the precession of the position of the periastron and the time-dependent gravitational redshift of the pulsar period as it approaches and recedes from its companion, can be measured accurately, and they fully determine the masses, the semi-major axis and the eccentricity of their orbit [394, 344].\n\nEquation (28) for the chirp time predicts that this system would change its orbital period Pb = 7.75 hrs on the timescale (taking M = 1.4 M⊙ and R = 106 km)\n\nFrom this one can infer that Ṗb ∼ 1.5 × 10−14. But this has to be corrected for our oversimplification of the orbit as circular: an eccentric orbit evolves much faster because, during the phase of closest approach, the velocities are much higher, and the emitted luminosity is a very strong function of the velocity. Using equations first computed by Peters and Mathews [290], for the actual eccentricity of 0.62, one finds (see Equation (109) below) ṖT = −(2.40242 ± 0.00002) × 10−12. Observations [394, 388] currently give ṖO = −(2.4184 ± 0.0009) × 10−12. There is a significant discrepancy between these, but it can be removed by realizing that the binary system is accelerating toward the center of our galaxy, which produces a small period change. Taking this into account gives a corrected prediction of −(2.4056 ± 0.0051) × 10−12, and this agrees with the observation within the uncertainties [394, 355]. This is the most sensitive test that we have of the correctness of Einstein’s equations with respect to gravitational radiation, and it leaves little room for doubt in the validity of the quadrupole formula for other systems that may generate detectable radiation.\n\nA number of other binary systems are now known in which such tests are possible [344]. The most important of the other systems is the “double pulsar” in which both neutron stars are seen as pulsars [246]. This system will soon overtake the Hulse-Taylor binary as the most accurate test of gravitational radiation.\n\nWhite-dwarf binaries\n\nBinary systems at lower frequencies are much more abundant than coalescing binaries, and they have much longer lifetimes. LISA will look for close white-dwarf binaries in our galaxy, and will probably see thousands of them. White dwarfs are not as compact as black holes or neutron stars. Although their masses can be similar to that of a neutron star their sizes are much larger, typically 3,000 km in radius. As a result, white-dwarf binaries never reach the last stable orbit, which would occur at roughly 1.5 kHz for these masses. We will discuss the implications of multi-messenger astronomy for white-dwarf binaries in Section 7.4.\n\nThe maximum amplitude of the radiation from a white-dwarf binary will be several orders of magnitude smaller than that of a neutron star or black hole binary at the same distance but close to coalescence. However, a binary system with a short period is long lived, so the effective amplitude (after matched filtering) improves as the square root of the observing time. Besides that, these sources are nearer: there are many thousands of such systems in our galaxy radiating in the LISA frequency window above about 1 mHz, and LISA should be able to see all of them. Below 1 mHz there are even more sources, so many that LISA will not resolve them individually, but will see them blended together in a stochastic background of radiation, as shown in Figure .\n\nSupermassive black hole binaries\n\nObservations indicate that the center of every galaxy probably hosts a black hole whose mass is in the range of 106–109 M⊙ [305], with the black holes mass correlating well with the mass of the galactic bulge. A black hole whose mass is in the above range is called a supermassive black hole (SMBH). There is now abundant observational evidence that galaxies often collide and merge, and there are good reasons to believe that when that happens, friction between the SMBHs and the stars and gas of the irregular merged galaxy will lead the SMBHs to spiral into a common nucleus and (on a timescale of some 108 yr) even get close enough to be driven into complete orbital decay by gravitational radiation reaction. In many systems this should lead to a black hole merger within a Hubble time [221]. For a binary with two nonspinning M = 106 M⊙ black holes, the frequency of emitted gravitational waves at the last stable orbit is, from Equation (29), fLSO = 4 mHz; during and after the merger the frequency rises from 4 mHz to the quasi-normal-mode frequency of 24 mHz (if the spin of the final black hole is negligible). (Naturally, all these frequencies simply scale inversely with the mass for other mass ranges.) This is in the frequency range of LISA, and observing these mergers is one of the central purposes of the mission.\n\nSMBH mergers are so spectacularly strong that they will be visible in LISA’s data stream even before applying any matched filter, although good models of the inspiral and particularly the merger radiation will be needed to extract source parameters. Because the masses of such black holes are so large, LISA can see essentially any merger that happens in its frequency band anywhere in the universe, even out to extremely high redshifts. It can thereby address astrophysical questions about the origin, growth and population of SMBHs. The recent discovery of an SMBH binary [221] and the association of X-shaped radio lobes with the merger of SMBH binaries [254] has further raised the optimism concerning SMBH merger rates, as has the suggestion that an SMBH has been observed to have been expelled from the center of its galaxy, an event that could only have happened as a result of a merger between two SMBHs [222]. The rate at which galaxies merge is about 1 yr−1 out to a red-shift of z = 5 [185], and LISA’s detection rate for SMBH mergers might be roughly the same.\n\nModelling of the merger of two black holes requires numerical relativity, and the accuracy and reliability of numerical simulations is now becoming good enough that they will soon become an integral part of gravitational wave searches.\n\nExtreme and intermediate mass-ratio inspiral sources\n\nThe SMBH environment of our own galaxy is known to contain a large number of compact objects and white dwarfs. Near the central SMBH there is a disproportionately large number of stellar-mass black holes, which have sunk there through random gravitational encounters with the normal stellar population (dynamical friction). Three body interaction will occasionally drive one of these compact objects into a capture orbit of the central SMBH. The compact object will sometimes be captured [305, 338, 337] into a highly eccentric trajectory (e > 0.99) with the periastron close to the last stable orbit of the SMBH. Since the mass of the captured object will be about 1–100 M⊙, while the SMBH will have a far greater mass, we essentially have a “test mass” falling in the geometry of a Kerr black hole. By Equation (33) we would expect that the small body would spend many orbits in the relativistic regime near the horizon of the large black hole: a 10 M⊙ black hole falling into a 106 M⊙ black hole would require on the order of 105 orbits. The emitted gravitational radiation [317, 179, 178, 67, 171, 57] would consist of a very long wave train that carries information about the nearly geodesic trajectory of the test body, thereby providing a very clean probe to survey the spacetime geometry of the central object (which could be a Kerr black hole or some other compact object) and test whether or not this geometry is as predicted by general relativity [318, 198, 177, 176, 68].\n\nThis kind of event happens occasionally to every SMBH that lives in the center of a galaxy. Indeed, since the SNR from matched filtering builds up in proportion to the square root of the observation time tchirp ∝ ν−1 = (µ/M)−1 [cf. Equation (33)] and the inherent amplitude of the radiation is linear in ν [cf. Equation (30)], the SNR varies with the symmetric mass ratio as and typical SNR will be about ten to a thousand times smaller than an SMBH binary at the same distance. LISA will, therefore, be able to see such sources only to much smaller distances, say between 1 to 10 Gpc depending on the mass ratio. For events at such distances LISA’s SNR after matched filtering could be in the range 10–100, but matched filtering will be very difficult because of the complexity of the orbit, especially of its evolution due to radiation effects. However, this volume of space contains a large number of galaxies, and the event rate is expected to be several tens to hundreds per year [67]. There will be a background from more distant sources that might in the end set the limit on how much sensitivity LISA has to these events.\n\nDue to relativistic frame dragging, for each passage of the apastron the test body could execute several nearly circular orbits at its periastron. Therefore, long periods of low-frequency, small-amplitude radiation will be followed by several cycles of high-frequency, large-amplitude radiation [317, 179, 178, 67, 171, 57]. The apastron slowly shrinks, while the periastron remains more or less at the same location, until the final plunge of the compact object before merger. Moreover, if the central black hole has a large spin then spin-orbit coupling leads to precession of the orbital plane thereby changing the polarization of the wave as seen by LISA.\n\nThus, there is a lot of structure in the waveforms owing to a number of different physical effects: contribution from higher-order multipoles due to an eccentric orbit, precession of the orbital plane, precession of the periastron, etc., and gravitational radiation backreaction plays a pivotal role in the dynamics of these systems. If one looks at the time-frequency map of such a signal one notices that the signal power is greatly smeared across the map [320], as compared to that of a sharp chirp from a nonspinning black-hole binary. For this reason, this spin modulated chirp is sometimes referred to as a smirch [322]. More commonly, such sources are called extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and represent systems whose mass ratio is in the range of ∼ 10−3–10−6. Inspirals of systems with their mass ratio in the range ∼ 10−2–10−3 are termed intermediate mass ratio inspirals or IMRIs. These latter systems correspond to the inspiral of intermediate mass black holes of mass ∼ 103–104 M⊙ and might constitute a prominent source in LISA provided the central SMBH grew in mass as a result of a number of mergers of small black holes [30, 31, 32].\n\nWhile black hole perturbation theory with a careful treatment of radiation reaction is necessary for the description of EMRIs, IMRIs may be amenable to a description using a hybrid scheme of post-Newtonian approximations and perturbation theory. This is an area that requires more study.\n\nQuasi-normal modes of a black hole\n\nIn 1970, Vishveshwara [381] discussed a gedanken experiment, similar in philosophy to Rutherford’s (real) experiment with the atom. In Vishveshwara’s experiment, he scattered gravitational radiation off a black hole to explore its properties. With the aid of such a gedanken experiment, he demonstrated for the first time that gravitational waves scattered off a black hole will have a characteristic waveform, when the incident wave has frequencies beyond a certain value, depending on the size of the black hole. It was soon realized that perturbed black holes have quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of vibration and in the process emit gravitational radiation, whose amplitude, frequency and damping time are characteristic of its mass and angular momentum [296, 220]. We will discuss in Section 6.4 how observations of QNMs could be used in testing strong field predictions of general relativity.\n\nWe can easily estimate the amplitude of gravitational waves emitted when a black hole forms at a distance r from Earth as a result of the coalescence of compact objects in a binary. The effective amplitude is given by Equation (20), which involves the energy E put into gravitational waves and the frequency f at which the waves come off. By dimensional arguments E is proportional to the total mass M of the resulting black hole. The efficiency at which the energy is converted into radiation depends on the symmetric mass ratio ν of the merging objects. One does not know the fraction of the total mass emitted nor the exact dependence on ν. Flanagan and Hughes [164] argue that E ∼ 0.03(4ν)2M. The frequency f is inversely proportional to M; indeed, for Schwarzschild black holes f = (2πM)−1. Thus, the formula for the effective amplitude takes the form\n\n35\n\nwhere α is a number that depends on the (dimensionless) angular momentum a of the black hole and has a value between 0.7 (for a = 0, Schwarzschild black hole) and 0.4 (for a = 1, maximally spinning Kerr black hole). For stellar mass black holes at a distance of 200 Mpc the amplitude is:\n\n36\n\nfor SMBHs, even at cosmological distances, the amplitude of quasinormal mode signals is pretty large:\n\n37\n\nIn the first case we have a pair of 10 M⊙ black holes inspiraling and merging to form a single black hole. In this case the waves come off at a frequency of around 500 Hz [cf. Equation (13)]. The initial ground-based network of detectors might be able to pick these waves up by matched filtering, especially when an inspiral event precedes the ringdown signal. A 100 M⊙ black hole plunging into a 106 M⊙ black hole at a distance of 6.5 Gpc (z ≃ 1) gives out radiation at a frequency of about 15 mHz. Note that in the latter case the radiation is redshifted from 30 mHz to 15 mHz. Such an event produces an amplitude just large enough to be detected by LISA. At the same distance, a pair of 106 M⊙ SMBHs spiral in and merge to produce a fantastic amplitude of 3 × 10−17, way above the LISA background noise. In this case, the signals would be given off at about 7.5 mHz and will be loud and clear to LISA. It will not only be possible to detect these events, but also to accurately measure the masses and spins of the objects before and after merger and thereby test the black hole no-hair theorem and confirm whether the result of the merger is indeed a black hole or some other exotic object (e.g., a boson star or a naked singularity).\n\nStochastic background\n\nIn addition to radiation from discrete sources, the universe should have a random gravitational wave field that results from a superposition of countless discrete systems and also from fundamental processes, such as the Big Bang. Observing any of these backgrounds would bring useful information, but the ultimate goal of detector development is the observation of the background radiation from the Big Bang. It is expected to be very weak, but it will come to us unhindered from as early as 10−30 s, and it could illuminate the nature of the laws of physics at energies far higher than we can hope to reach in the laboratory.\n\nIt is usual to characterize the intensity of a random field of gravitational waves by its energy density as a function of frequency. Since the energy density of a plane wave is the same as its flux (when c = 1), we have from Equation (17)\n\nBut the wave field in this case is a random variable, so we must replace h2 by a statistical mean square amplitude per unit frequency (Fourier transform power per unit frequency) called Sgw(f), so that the energy density per unit frequency is proportional to f2Sgw(f). It is then conventional to talk about the energy density per unit logarithm of the frequency, which means multiplying by f. The result, after being careful about averaging over all directions of the waves and all independent polarization components, is [27, 359]\n\nFinally, what is of most interest is the energy density as a fraction of the closure or critical cosmological density, given by the Hubble constant H0 as . The resulting ratio is called Ωgw(f):\n\nThe only tight constraint on Ωgw from non-gravitational-wave astronomy is that it must be smaller than 10−5, in order not to disturb the agreement between the standard Big Bang model of nucleosynthesis (of helium and other light elements) and observation. If the universe contains this much gravitational radiation today, then at the time of nucleosynthesis the (blue-shifted) energy density of this radiation would have been comparable to that of the photons and the three neutrino species. Although the radiation would not have participated in the nuclear reactions, its extra energy density would have required that the expansion rate of the universe at that time be significantly faster, in order to evolve into the universe we see today. In turn, this faster expansion would have provided less time for the nuclear reactions to “freeze out”, altering the abundances from the values that are observed today [281, 346]. First-generation interferometers should be able to set direct limits on the cosmological background at around this level. Radiation in the lower-frequency LISA band, from galactic and extra-galactic binaries, is expected to be much smaller than this bound.\n\nRandom radiation is indistinguishable from instrumental noise in a single detector, at least for short observing times. If the random field is produced by an anisotropically-distributed set of astrophysical sources (the binaries in our galaxy, for example) then over a year, as the detector changes its orientation, the noise from this background should rise and fall in a systematic way, allowing it to be identified. But this is a rather crude way of detecting the radiation, and a better way is to perform a cross-correlation between two detectors, if available.\n\nIn cross-correlation, which amounts to multiplying the outputs and integrating, the random signal in one detector essentially acts as a template for the signal in the other detector. If they match, then there will be a stronger-than-expected correlation. Notice that they can only match well if the wavelength of the gravitational waves is longer than the separation between the detectors: otherwise time delays for waves reaching one detector before the other degrade the match. The outcome is not like standard matched filtering, however, since the “filter” of the first detector has as much noise superimposed on its template as the other detector. As a result, the amplitude SNR of the correlated field grows only with observing time T as T1/4, rather than the square root growth that characterizes matched filtering [359].\n\nGravitational Wave Detectors and Their Sensitivity\n\nDetectors of gravitational waves generally divide into two classes: beam detectors and resonant mass detectors. In beam detectors, gravitational waves interact with a beam of electromagnetic radiation, which is monitored in some way to register the passage of the wave. In resonant mass detectors, the gravitational wave transfers energy to a massive body, from which the resultant oscillations are observed.\n\nBoth classes include a variety of systems. The principal beam detectors are the large ground-based laser interferometers currently operating in several locations around the globe, such as the LIGO system in the USA. The ESA-NASA LISA mission aims to put a laser interferometer into space to detect milliHertz gravitational waves. But beam detectors do not need to involve interferometry: the radio beams transponded to interplanetary spacecraft can carry the signature of a passing gravitational wave, and this method has been used to search for low-frequency gravitational waves. And radio astronomers have for many years monitored the radio beams of distant pulsars for evidence of gravitational waves; new radio instrumentation is turning this into a powerful and promising method of looking for stochastic backgrounds and individual sources. And at ultra-low frequencies, gravitational waves in the early universe may have left their imprint on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background.\n\nResonant mass detectors were the first kind of detector built in the laboratory to detect gravitational waves: Joseph Weber [387] built two cylindrical aluminum bar detectors and attempted to find correlated disturbances that might have been caused by a passing impulsive gravitational wave. His claimed detections led to the construction of many other bar detectors of comparable or better sensitivity, which never verified his claims. Some of those detectors were not developed further, but others had their sensitivities improved by making them cryogenic, and today there are two ultra-cryogenic detectors in operation (see Section 4.1).\n\nIn the following, we will examine the principal detection methods that hold promise today and in the near future.\n\nPrinciples of the operation of resonant mass detectors\n\nA typical “bar” detector consists of a cylinder of aluminum with a length ℓ ∼ 3 m, a very narrow resonant frequency between f ∼ 500 Hz and 1.5 kHz, and a mass M ∼ 1000 kg. A short gravitational wave burst with h ∼ 10−21 will make the bar vibrate with an amplitude\n\n38\n\nTo measure this, one must fight against three main sources of noise.\n\nThermal noise. The original Weber bar operated at room temperature, but the most advanced detectors today, Nautilus [51] and Auriga [227], are ultra-cryogenic, operating at T = 100 mK. At this temperature the root mean square (rms) amplitude of vibration is\n\n39\n\nThis is far larger than the gravitational wave amplitude expected from astrophysical sources. But if the material has a high Q (say, 106) in its fundamental mode, then that changes its thermal amplitude of vibration in a random walk with very small steps, taking a time Q/f ∼ 1000 s to change by the full amount. However, a gravitational wave burst will cause a change in 1 ms. In 1 ms, thermal noise will have random-walked to an expected amplitude change (1000 s/1 ms)1/2 = Q1/2 times smaller, or (for these numbers)\n\n40\n\nSo ultra-cryogenic bars can approach the goal of detection near h = 10−20 despite thermal noise.\n\nSensor noise. A transducer converts the bar’s mechanical energy into electrical energy, and an amplifier increases the electrical signal to record it. If sensing of the vibration could be done perfectly, then the detector would be broadband: both thermal impulses and gravitational wave forces are mechanical forces, and the ratio of their induced vibrations would be the same at all frequencies for a given applied impulsive force.\n\nBut sensing is not perfect: amplifiers introduce noise, and this makes small amplitudes harder to measure. The amplitudes of vibration are largest in the resonance band near f, so amplifier noise limits the detector sensitivity to gravitational wave frequencies near f. But if the noise is small, then the measurement bandwidth about f can be much larger than the resonant bandwidth f/Q. Typical measurement bandwidths are 10 Hz, about 104 times larger than the resonant bandwidths, and 100 Hz is not out of the question [59].\n\nQuantum noise. The zero-point vibrations of a bar with a frequency of 1 kHz are\n\n41\n\nThis is comparable to the thermal limit over 1 ms. So, as detectors improve their thermal limits, they run into the quantum limit, which must be breached before a signal at 10−21 can be seen with such a detector.\n\nIt is not impossible to do better than the quantum limit. The uncertainty principle only sets the limit above if a measurement tries to determine the excitation energy of the bar, or equivalently the phonon number. But one is not interested in the phonon number, except in so far as it allows one to determine the original gravitational wave amplitude. It is possible to define other observables that also respond to the gravitational wave and can be measured more accurately by squeezing their uncertainty at the expense of greater errors in their conjugate observable [110]. It is not yet clear whether squeezing will be viable for bar detectors, although squeezing is now an established technique in quantum optics and will soon be implemented in interferometric detectors (see below).\n\nReliable gravitational wave detection, whether with bars or with other detectors, requires coincidence observations, in which two or more detectors confirm each other’s findings. The principal bar detector projects around the world formed the International Gravitational Event Collaboration (IGEC) [202] to arrange for long-duration coordinated observations and joint data analysis. A report in 2003 of an analysis of a long period of coincident observing over three years found no evidence of significant events [50]. The ALLEGRO bar [243] at Louisiana State University made joint data-taking runs with the nearby LIGO interferometer, setting an upper limit on the stochastic gravitational-wave background at around 900 Hz of [17]. More recently, because funding for many of the bar detector projects has become more restricted, only two groups continue to operate bars at present (end of 2008): the Rome [367] and Auriga [227] groups. The latest observational results from IGEC may be found in [54].\n\nIt is clear from the above discussion that bars have great difficulty achieving the sensitivity goal of 10−21. This limitation was apparent even in the 1970s, and that motivated a number of groups to explore the intrinsically wide-band technique of laser interferometry, leading to the projects described in Section 4.3.1 below. However, the excellent sensitivity of resonant detectors within their narrow bandwidths makes them suitable for specialized, high-frequency searches, including cross-correlation searches for stochastic backgrounds [119]. Therefore, novel and imaginative designs for resonant-mass detectors continue to be proposed. For example, it is possible to construct large spheres of a similar size (1 to 3 m diameter) to existing cylinders. This increases the mass of the detector and also improves its direction-sensing. One can in principle push to below 10−21 with spheres [117]. A spherical prototype called MiniGRAIL[234] has been operated in the Netherlands[181]. A similar prototype called the Schenberg detector[203] is being built in Brazil [21]. Nested cylinders or spheres, or masses designed to sense multiple modes of vibration may also provide a clever way to improve on bar sensitivities [86].\n\nWhile these ideas have interesting potential, funding for them is at present (2008) very restricted, and the two remaining bar detectors are likely to be shut down in the near future, when the interferometers begin operating at sensitivities clearly better than 10−21.\n\nPrinciples of the operation of beam detectors\n\nInterferometers use laser light to measure changes in the difference between the lengths of two perpendicular (or nearly perpendicular) arms. Typically, the arm lengths respond differently to a given gravitational wave, so an interferometer is a natural instrument to measure gravitational waves. But other detectors also use electromagnetic radiation, for example, ranging to spacecraft in the solar system and even pulsar timing.\n\nThe basic equation we need is for the effect of a plane linear gravitational wave on a beam of light. Suppose the angle between the direction of the beam and the direction of the plane wave is θ. We imagine a very simple experiment in which the light beam originates at a clock, whose proper time is called t, and is received by a clock, whose proper time is tf. The beam and gravitational-wave travel directions determine a plane, and we denote the polarization component of the gravitational wave that acts in this plane by h+(t), as measured at the location of the originating clock. The proper distance between the clocks, in the absence of the wave, is L. If the originating clock puts timestamps onto the light beam, then the receiving clock can measure the rate of arrival of the timestamps. If there is no gravitational wave, and if the clocks are ideal, then the rate will be constant, which can be normalized to unity. The effect of the gravitational wave is to change the arrival rate as a function of the emission rate by\n\n42\n\nThis is very simple: the beam of light leaves the emitter at the time when the gravitational wave of phase t passes the emitter, and it reaches the receiver at the time when the gravitational wave of phase t + (1 − cos θ)L is passing the receiver. So in the plane wave case, only the amplitudes of the wave at the emitting and receiving events affect the time delay.\n\nIn order to use such an arrangement to detect gravitational waves, one needs two very stable clocks. The best clocks today are stable to a few parts in 1016 [40], which implies that the minimum amplitude of gravitational waves that could be detected by such a two-clock experiment is h ∼ 10−15. However, this equation is also fundamental to the detection of gravitational waves by pulsar timing, in which the originating ‘clock’ is a pulsar. By correlating many pulsar signals, one can beat down the single-pulsar noise. This is described below in Section 4.4.2.\n\nAn arrangement that uses only one clock is one that sends a beam out to a receiver, which then reflects or retransmits (transponds) the beam back to the sender. The sender has the clock, which measures variations in the round-trip time. This method has been used with interplanetary spacecraft, which has the advantage that the only clock is on the ground, which can be made more stable than one carried in a spacecraft (see Section 4.4.1). For the same arrangement as above, the return time treturn varies at the rate\n\n43\n\nThis is known as the three-term relation, the third term being the wave strength at the time the beam returns back to the sender.\n\nBut the sensitivity of such a one-path system as a gravitational wave detector is still limited by the stability of the clock. For that reason, interferometers have become the most sensitive beam detectors: effectively one arm of the interferometer becomes the ‘clock’, or at least the time standard, that variations in the other arm are compared to. Of course, if both arms are affected by a gravitational wave in the same way, then the interferometer will not see the wave. But this happens only in very special geometries. For most wave arrival directions and polarizations, the arms are affected differently, and a simple interferometer measures the difference between the round-trip travel time variations in the two arms. For the triangular space array LISA, the measured signal is somewhat more complex (see Section 4.4.3 below), but it still preserves the principle that the time reference for one arm is a combination of the others.\n\nThe response of a ground-based interferometer\n\nGround-based interferometers are the most sensitive detectors operating today, and are likely to make the first direct detections [197]. The largest detectors operating today are the LIGO detectors [302], two of which have arm lengths of 4 km. This is much smaller than the wavelength of the gravitational wave, so the interaction of one arm with a gravitational wave can be well approximated by the small-L approximation to Equation (43), namely\n\n44\n\n(See [69] for first corrections to the short-arm approximation.) To analyze the full detector, where the second arm will normally point out of the plane we have been working in up till now, it is helpful to go over to a tensorial expression, independent of special coordinate orientations. The gravitational wave will act in the plane transverse to the propagation direction; let us call that direction and let us set up radiation basis vectors and in the transverse plane, such that lies in the plane formed by the wave propagation direction and the arm of our gravitational wave sensor, which lies along the x-axis of the detector plane, whose unit vector is êx. (For a picture of this geometry, see the left-hand panel of Figure , where for the moment we are ignoring the y-arm of the detector shown there.)\n\nWith these definitions, the wave amplitude h+ is the one that has and as the axes of its ellipse. The full wave amplitude is described, as in Equation (6), by the wave tensor\n\n45\n\nwhere e+ and e× are the polarization tensors associated with these basis vectors (compare Equation (4)):\n\n46\n\nThe unique way of expressing Equation (44) in terms of h is\n\n47\n\nThis does not depend on any special orientation of the arm relative to the wave direction, and does not depend on the basis we chose in the transverse plane, so we can use it as well for the second arm of the interferometer, no matter what its orientation. Let us assume it lies along the unit vector by êy. (We do not, in fact, have to assume that the two arms are perpendicular to each other, but it simplifies the diagram a little.) The return-time derivative along the second arm is then given by\n\nThe interferometer responds to the difference between these times,\n\nBy analogy with the wave tensor, we define the detector tensor d by [146]\n\n48\n\n(If the arms are not perpendicular this expression would still give the correct tensor if the unit vectors lie along the actual arm directions.) Then we can express the differential return time rate in the simple invariant form\n\n49\n\nwhere the notation d: h ≡ dlmhlm denotes the Euclidean scalar product of the tensors d and h. Equation (49) can be integrated over time to give the instantaneous path-length (or time-delay, or phase) difference between the arms, as measured by the central observer’s proper time clock:\n\n50\n\nThis is a robust and compact expression for the response of any interferometer to any wave in the long-wavelength (short-arm) limit. Its dependence on the wave direction is called its antenna pattern.\n\nIt is conventional to re-express this measurable in terms of the stretching of the arms of the interferometer. Within our approximation that the arms are shorter than a wavelength, this makes sense: it is possible to define a local inertial coordinate system that covers the entire interferometer, and within this coordinate patch (where light travels at speed 1) time differences measure proper length differences. The differential return time is twice the differential length change of the arms:\n\n51\n\nFor a bar detector of length L lying along the director â, the detector tensor is\n\n52\n\nalthough one must be careful that the change in proper length of a bar is not simply given by Equation (51), because of the restoring forces in the bar.\n\nWhen dealing with observations by more than one detector, it is not convenient to tie the alignment of the basis vectors in the sky plane with those in the detector frame, as we have done in the left-hand panel of Figure , since the detectors will have different orientations. Instead it will usually be more convenient to choose polarization tensors in the sky plane according to some universal reference, e.g., using a convenient astronomical reference frame. The right-hand panel of Figure shows the general situation, where the basis vectors and are rotated by an angle ψ from the basis used in the left-hand panel. The polarization tensors on this new basis,\n\n53\n\nare found by the following transformation from the previous ones:\n\n54\n\nThen one can write Equation (51) as\n\n55\n\nwhere F+ and F× are the antenna pattern functions for the two polarizations defined on the sky-plane basis by\n\n56\n\nUsing the geometry in the right-hand panel of Figure , one can show that\n\n57\n\nThese are the antenna-pattern response functions of the interferometer to the two polarizations of the wave as defined in the sky plane [359]. If one wants the antenna pattern referred to the detector’s own axes, then one just sets ψ = 0. If the arms of the interferometer are not perpendicular to each other, then one defines the detector-plane coordinates x and y in such a way that the bisector of the angle between the arms lies along the bisector of the angle between the coordinate axes [334]. Note that the maximum value of either F+ or F× is 1.\n\nThe corresponding antenna-pattern functions of a bar detector whose longitudinal axis is aligned along the z direction, are\n\n58\n\nAny one detector cannot directly measure both independent polarizations of a gravitational wave at the same time, but responds rather to a linear combination of the two that depends on the geometry of the detector and source direction. If the wave lasts only a short time, then the responses of three widely-separated detectors, together with two independent differences in arrival times among them, are, in principle, sufficient to fully reconstruct the source location and gravitational wave polarization. A long-lived wave will change its location in the antenna pattern as the detector moves, and it will also be frequency modulated by the motion of the detector; these effects are in principle sufficient to determine the location of the source and the polarization of the wave.\n\nSince the polarization angle of an incoming gravitational wave would generally be expected to be unrelated to its direction of arrival, depending rather on the internal orientations in the source, it is useful to characterize the directional sensitivity of a detector by averaging over the polarization angle ψ. If the wave has a given amplitude h and is linearly polarized, then, if we are interested in a single detector’s response, it is always possible to align the polarization angle ψ in the sky plane with that of the wave, so that the wave has pure +-polarization. Then the rms response function of the detector is\n\n59\n\nThe function is often simply called the antenna pattern. For a resonant bar, the antenna pattern is\n\n60\n\nand for an interferometer, it is given by\n\n61\n\nThe antenna pattern of an interferometric detector is plotted in the left panel of Figure , which clearly shows the quadrupolar nature of the detector. Note that the response of an interferometer is the best for waves coming from a direction orthogonal to the plane containing the detector, and it is zero for waves in the plane of an interferometer’s arms (i.e., θ = π/2) that arrive from a direction bisecting the two arms (i.e., ϕ = π/4) or from directions differing from this by a multiple of π/2. What is the response of an antenna to a linearly-polarized source at a random location in the sky? This is given by the rms value of over the sky,\n\n62\n\nwhich is smaller than the maximum response by a factor of (52%) for a bar detector and by (63%) for an interferometer.\n\nThe polarization amplitudes of the radiation from an inspiraling binary, a rotating neutron star, or a ringing black hole, take a simple form as follows:\n\nwhere h0 is an overall (possibly time-dependent) amplitude, Φ(t) is the signal’s phase and ι is the angle made by the characteristic direction in the source (e.g., the orbital or the spin angular momentum) with the line of sight. In this case, the response takes a particularly simple form:\n\n63\n\nwhere\n\nNote that A, just as F, takes values in the range [0, 1]. In this case the average response has to be worked out by considering all possible sky locations, polarizations (which drops out of the calculation) and source orientations. More precisely, the rms response is\n\n64\n\nfor an interferometer the above integral gives 2/5. Thus, the rms response is still 40% of the peak response.\n\nThe right-hand panel of Figure shows the percentage area of the sky over which the antenna pattern of an interferometric detector is larger than a certain fraction ϵ of the peak value. The response is better than the rms value over 40% of the sky, implying that gravitational wave detectors are fairly omni-directional. In comparison, the sky coverage of most conventional telescopes (radio, infrared, optical, etc.) is a tiny fraction of the area of the sky.\n\nPractical issues of ground-based interferometers\n\nA detector with an arm length of 4 km responds to a gravitational wave with an amplitude of 10−21 with\n\nLight takes only about 10−5 s to go up and down one arm, much less than the typical period of gravitational waves of interest. Therefore, it is beneficial to arrange for the light to remain in an arm longer than this, say for 100 round trips. This increases its effective path length by 100 and hence the shift in the position of a given phase of the light beam will be of order 10−16 m. Most interferometers keep the light in the arms for this length of time by setting up optical cavities in the arms with low-transmissivity mirrors; these are called Fabry-Pérot cavities.\n\nThe main sources of noise against which a measurement must compete are:\n\nGround vibration. External mechanical vibrations must be screened out. These are a problem for bar detectors, too, but are more serious for interferometers, not least because interferometers bounce light back and forth between the mirrors, and so each reflection introduces further vibrational noise. Suspension/isolation systems are based on pendulums. A pendulum is a good mechanical filter for frequencies above its natural frequency. By hanging the mirrors on pendulums of perhaps 0.5 m length, one achieves filtering above a few Hertz. Since the spectrum of ground noise falls at higher frequencies, this provides suitable isolation. But these systems can be very sophisticated; the GEO600 [143] detector has a three-stage pendulum and other vibration isolation components [291]. The most ambitious multi-stage isolation system has been developed for the Virgo detector [175].\n\nThermal noise. Vibrations of the mirrors and of the suspending pendulum can mask gravitational waves. As with vibrational noise, this is increased by the bouncing of the light between the mirrors. Opposite to bars, interferometers perform measurements at frequencies far from the resonant frequency, where the amplitude of thermal vibration is largest. Thus, the pendulum suspensions have thermal noise at a few Hertz, so measurements will be made above 40 Hz in the first detectors. Internal vibrations of the mirrors have natural frequencies of several kHz, which sets an effective upper limit to the observing band. By ensuring that both kinds of oscillations have very high Q, one can confine most of the vibration energy to a small bandwidth around the resonant frequency, so that at the measurement frequencies the vibration amplitudes are extremely small. This allows interferometers to operate at room temperature. But mechanical Qs of 107 or higher are required, and this is technically demanding.\n\nThermal effects produce other disturbances besides vibration. Some of the mirrors in interferometers are partly transmissive, as is the beam splitter. A small amount of light power is absorbed during transmission, which raises the temperature of the mirror and changes its index of refraction. The resulting “thermal lensing” can ruin the optical properties of the system, and random fluctuations in lensing caused by time-dependent thermal fluctuations (thermo-refractive noise) can appear at measurement frequencies. These effects can limit the amount of laser power that can be used in the detector. Other problems can arise from heating effects in the multiple-layer coatings that are applied to the reflective surfaces of mirrors.\n\nShot noise. The photons that are used to do interferometry are quantized, and so they arrive at random and make random fluctuations in the light intensity that can look like a gravitational wave signal. The more photons one uses, the smoother the interference signal will be. As a random process, the error improves with the square root of the number N of photons. Using infrared light with a wavelength λ ∼ 1 µm, one can expect to measure to an accuracy of To measure at a frequency f, one has to make at least 2f measurements per second, so one can accumulate photons for a time 1/2f. With light power P, one gets N = P/(hc/λ)/(2f) photons. In order that δlshot should be below 10−16 m, one needs high light power, far beyond the output of any continuous laser. Light-recycling techniques overcome this problem, by using light efficiently. An interferometer actually has two places where light leaves. One is where the interference is measured, the difference port. The other is the sum of the two return beams on the beam splitter, which goes back towards the input laser. Normally one makes sure that no light hits the interference sensor, so that only when a gravitational wave passes does a signal register there. This means that all the light normally returns toward the laser input, apart from small losses at the mirrors. Since mirrors are of good quality, only one part in 103 or less of the light is lost during a 1 ms storage time. By placing a power-recycling mirror in front of the laser, one can reflect this wasted light back in, allowing power to build up in the arms until the laser merely resupplies the mirror losses [149]. This can dramatically reduce the power requirement for the laser. The first interferometers work with laser powers of 5–10 W. Upgrades will use ten or more times this input power.\n\nQuantum effects. Shot noise is a quantum noise, and like all quantum noises there is a corresponding conjugate noise. As laser power is increased to reduce shot noise, the position sensing accuracy improves, and one eventually comes up against the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: the momentum transferred to the mirror by the measurement leads to a disturbance that can mask a gravitational wave. To reduce this backaction pressure fluctuation, scientists are experimenting with a variety of interferometer configurations that modify the quantum state of the light, by “squeezing” the Heisenberg uncertainty ellipse, in order to reduce the effect of this uncertainty on the variable being measured, at the expense of its (unmeasured) conjugate. The key point here is that we are using a quantum field (light) to measure an effectively classical quantity (gravitational wave amplitude), so we do not need to know everything about our quantum system: we just need to reduce the uncertainty in that part of the quantum field that responds to the gravitational wave at the readout of our interferometer. The best results on squeezing so far [371] have been obtained during preparations for the GEO-HF upgrade of the GEO600 detector [395]. These techniques may be needed for the second-generation advanced detectors and will certainly be needed for advances beyond that.\n\nGravity gradient noise. One noise that cannot be screened out is that due to changes in the local Newtonian gravitational field on the timescale of the measurements. A gravitational wave detector will respond to tidal forces from local sources just as well as to gravitational waves. Environmental noise comes not only from man-made sources, but even more importantly from natural ones: seismic waves are accompanied by changes in the gravitational field, and changes in air pressure are accompanied by changes in air density.
