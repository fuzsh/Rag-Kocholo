Because being vaccinated reduces the risk of being infected with COVID-19, and generally minimizes the risk of severe symptoms or hospitalization, effective 2022, we are following mandated protocol for healthcare organizations in California and requiring full vaccination and a booster to be completed by all employees, vendors and contractors within a reasonable timeframe of eligibility or require proof of eligibility of an exemption from this requirement due to a medical condition or sincerely-held religious belief, subject to applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nFor more information, please contact HR@thepeopleconcern.org.\n\nWhat We Stand For\n\nThese values represent who we are and how we work.\n\nCOURAGEOUS LEADERS\n\nWe are out front addressing issues and doing the right thing in the community, with those we serve and each other.

We are driven by a passion for helping those in need by fostering an empowered community where staff and those we serve thrive.\n\nWITH INTEGRITY\n\nWe are trust worthy and we do what is right even when no one is looking.

As a social justice organization, we value and respect the humanity of everyone we work with and the people we serve. We strive to lead with the values and principles that enable The People Concern staff to develop their potential, bring their whole self to work and participate in an inclusive workplace. We seek to acknowledge and understand our own implicit bias, foster a safe environment to discuss and celebrate diversity, and recruit and hire a workforce throughout our organization that is reflective of our community and clients. We focus on comprehensive, scalable, and sustainable diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and education to affirm the agency as anti-discriminatory, anti-racist and consciously inclusive. We recognize that we all share the responsibility to sustain a nurturing culture that intentionally and unequivocally safeguards our foundational principles in diversity, equity, inclusion, dignity, and respect for all. This is our pathway to mission-critical success in ensuring everyone is housed, healthy, and safe.\n\nEmployee Experience\n\nOur Why\n\nTestimonials\n\nBrodie Butler, Program Manager, Outreach, Access Center\n\n\"During the time I’ve worked with The People Concern, I have grown so much both professionally and personally, and am grateful for all the opportunities I’ve been provided to create positive change within the organization and for our participants.
