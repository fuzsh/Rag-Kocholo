Our next generation of business and sustainability leaders will need all of the above. Anyone else in my network a Scouting leader? Any parents interest in learning more about Scouting? Feel free to message me if so. (And, if you are in the Chapel Hill/Hillsborough area, both boys & girls invited to join our Cub Scout pack 449 or Scouts BSA troop 449!)"
