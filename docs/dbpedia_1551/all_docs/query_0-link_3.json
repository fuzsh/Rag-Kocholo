        "text": "Tracks from the Supernova (abbreviated as TFTS) is an ambient rock album created by The Traveler, centered mainly about the challenges and wonders of outer space. The album is heavily inspired and mainly sourced from an unreleased rock opera by Weezer called Songs from the Black Hole.\n\nHaving a sample range from the 1990s-2000s, the album features heavy themes of exploration, curiosity, romance, loneliness, drama, and even depression (at certain points). In addition, it also contains a serialized narrative, demonstrating the Traveler's mystical, parasocial, lonely voyage across the stars. It was mainly conveyed through the album's structure, description (YouTube video), and even tracks (has several Morse code tracks relaying messages).\n\nTracks from the Supernova was announced on November 7th, 2021, and was later premiered 10 days later on the 17th, featuring 22 tracks.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nThe creation of Tracks from the Supernova was mainly influenced from the lack of motivation from the Traveler into approaching Everything Until Now's 4th stage, sidetracking the moniker into creating other projects. During this time period, the moniker discovered Weezer and their albums, Pinkerton and the unreleased Sounds from the Black Hole, which gave way into the story and samples for the project.\n\nThe project's development was relatively swift and on the November 7th, 2021, a trailer for the project announced it's release. Only 10 days later, Tracks from the Supernova premiered on YouTube.\n\nStory/Narrative[]\n\n(From the YouTube video and based on the story of SFTBH.)\n\nAct I:\n\nIn hope of finding some kind of peace from the troubling moralities, The Traveler hops aboard the Betsy II, a spacecraft, as it starts to fly, sticking outside of it with his self-generating oxygen tank and helmet (Countdown). The ship is leaving the stratosphere and heading into the unexplored reaches of space (Ascending) and as they pass the moon, the Traveler looks forward to adventure, even though the beginnings of doubt and worry have started to form.\n\nA few days out, the Traveler receives a friendly message, in which he thoroughly enjoys and forgets about as he plays a song on his Walkman (A Great Journey Begins). After the distraction, though, the Traveler then spends the days observing the inner workings of the ship, seeing as the captain and the cook make up and form a love, although that love seems to be almost one-sided (Viewing Love). As he watches as the couple gradually grow closer and closer, eventually to a point of private intercourse, the Traveler then starts to wonder about his own lover and slowly begins to long for something he knew (Like a Blooming Flower).\n\nAfter a long and hard process of thought as the ship crosses through meteor showers and comets, the Traveler decides to detach from the ship and explore the vast emptiness of space, via a rope, hooked to the ship. It was so empty and so strange and as it all entered a climax, the vast emptiness of space cried and the Traveler quickly returned, realizing that the love has suddenly grown sour (A Spacewalk). The couple argue back and forth and as the days went by, seemed to have detached from each other and mourned about it (Paranoid). In a sudden epiphany, both the Traveler and the man share a moment, as they both start to feel some void entering inside them. It’s when the Traveler learned the man’s name… Jonas (Now, I Finally See).\n\nAnd with that… they begin to yearn for home (Homesick). Another message arrives for the Traveler, but he ignores it ([750 HZ] No. 1), blinded by the continuous staring at the emptiness of space (Sounds from the Vaccum). The two remain in this state for an undetermined amount of time, only listening to the sounds around them.\n\nAct II:\n\nAnd just as it seems like there is no hope for the both of them… something sparks between them. News. News that they would be landing soon (Reminder). Jonas took up new interests and with a big and heavy sigh, the Traveler managed to go past his sadness as he watches as a new love emerges from the ashes (A New Hope). Unfortunately, as they land onto the planet, the Traveler finds out that Jonas' former love wants to get back together again and thus, a struggle between the three is formed (Love Triangle).\n\nAs soon as that triangle was exposed, his lovers retreated, leaving poor Jonas behind (Things Fall Apart) and the Traveler could only watch as Jonas mourns for everything about them and himself (Now, I Finally See Pt. 2). In an act to help the guy, the Traveler reveals himself to Jonas (Coming Out of Hiding) and the two share a strange, radical, yet sympathetic bond over the next few days (We Find Sympathy).\n\nA week passes, and the Traveler learns of Jonas’ problems, hinting at a possible fate. Despite his best intentions to convince him not to, the Traveler ultimately allows Jonas to do what he wants (The Mission Ends). The mission is a failure and as the ship is about to leave, the Traveler says his goodbyes to Jonas as he walks on the ship and sails away, watching Jonas fall with the planet as the sun eats him alive (Goodbye, Jonas).\n\nAs the Traveler spends the long journey back reflecting on what’s happened and how it has changed him, the story ends with a heavenly-like transition back home (TRANSMISSION).\n\nTrack List[]\n\nTracks From The Supernova # Title Length 01 Countdown TBA 02 Ascending into the Unknown TBA 03 [750 HZ | 22 WPM | 22 Farn WPM] No. 1 TBA 04 A Great Journey Begins TBA 05 Viewing Love as the Third Wheel TBA 06 Like a Blooming Flower TBA 07 A Spacewalk Through the Equilibrium TBA 08 Paranoid about Caring for Her TBA 09 Now, I Finally See.
