Dr. Dresselhaus paved the way for the rise of nanotechnology and blazed a path for women in science and engineering. She was known as the “queen of carbon science” based on her life-long research into the properties of graphite and carbon-based materials. The era of carbon electronics can be traced back to her tireless research efforts.\n\nSponsor(s)\n\nNomination Deadline\n\n15 June\n\nNominate\n\nPresented to\n\nAn individual.\n\nScope\n\nFor outstanding technical contributions in science and engineering of great impact to IEEE fields of interest.\n\nPrize\n\nThe award consists of a bronze medal, certificate, and cash honorarium.\n\nBasis for Judging\n\nIn the evaluation process, the following criteria are considered: Impact on the profession and/or society, sequence of significant technical or other contributions, leadership in accomplishing worthwhile goal(s), previous honors, and other achievements as evidenced by publications or patents or other evidence.\n\nView Award Recipients\n\nIEEE Edison Medal\n\nThe motivation for most scientific and technological advances has been derived from man's imagination and his dedicated desire to achieve a better standard of living. Thomas Alva Edison was endowed with many of those qualities and characteristics, which are so necessary to bridge the gap between imagination and realization.\n\nOn 21 October 1879, Mr. Edison succeeded in producing the first practical incandescent electric light bulb—the beginning of modern illumination.\n\nTwenty-five years later, on 11 February 1904, a group of Mr. Edison's friends and associates created a medal in his name to commemorate the achievements of a quarter of a century in the art of electric lighting. In their words, \"The Edison Medal should, during the centuries to come, serve as an honorable incentive to scientists, engineers, and artisans to maintain by their works the high standard of accomplishment set by the illustrious man whose name and feats shall live while human intelligence continues to inhabit the world.\"\n\nFour years later, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers entered into an agreement with the founders to award the medal. The award now carries the designation of IEEE.\n\nThe IEEE Edison Medal has been presented since 1909.\n\nSponsor(s)\n\nNomination Deadline\n\n15 June\n\nNominate\n\nPresented to\n\nAn individual.\n\nScope\n\nFor a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering, or the electrical arts.\n\nPrize\n\nThe award consists of a bronze medal, certificate, and cash honorarium.\n\nBasis for Judging\n\nIn the evaluation process, the following criteria are considered: leadership, individual contributions, originality, breadth, patents/publications, other achievements, honors, duration of dominance, and quality of nomination.\n\nView Award Recipients\n\nIEEE Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies\n\nThe IEEE Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies was established in 2008.\n\nSponsor(s)\n\nNomination Deadline\n\n15 June\n\nNominate\n\nPresented to\n\nAn individual or team, up to three in number.\n\nScope\n\nFor outstanding accomplishments in the application of technology in the fields of interest of IEEE that improve the environment and/or public safety.\n\nThe IEEE Medal for Environmental and Safety Technologies is relevant to a wide community including intelligent transportation systems, wireless communications, sensor networks control and control and automation, computing, and signal processing.\n\nPrize\n\nThe award consists of a bronze medal, certificate, and cash honorarium.\n\nBasis for Judging\n\nIn the evaluation process, the following criteria are considered: public benefits of the contribution; degree in improvement in important performance metrics; innovative design, development, or application engineering; favorable influence on the contribution on technical professions; and quality of nomination.\n\nView Award Recipients\n\nIEEE Founders Medal\n\nThe IEEE Founders Medal was established by the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1952. It derives its character and purpose from the inspiring example of leadership and service set by the three founders of the Institute: Alfred N. Goldsmith, who was Director Emeritus and Editor Emeritus of IEEE, Messrs. John V. L. Hogan, and Robert Marriott.\n\nThis purpose is perhaps best expressed by the citation that accompanied the first award, which read in part: \"For outstanding contributions to the profession and to the Institute through wise and courageous leadership in the planning and administration of technical developments.\"\n\nThe progress of a profession rests not only on the technical abilities of its members, but on the qualities of leadership and dedication that they possess. It is therefore highly appropriate that among the major awards of IEEE, there is one that brings deserved recognition to these important attributes.\n\nSponsor\n\nNomination Deadline\n\n15 June\n\nNominate\n\nPresented to\n\nAn individual or team, up to three in number.\n\nScope\n\nFor outstanding contributions in the leadership, planning, and administration of affairs of great value to the electrical and electronics engineering profession.\n\nPrize\n\nThe award consists of a bronze medal, certificate, and cash honorarium.\n\nBasis for Judging\n\nIn the evaluation process, the following criteria are considered: outstanding leadership; planning or administration of affairs related to the profession; and quality of nomination. The candidate(s) should be a major industry administrator, or manager of a complex scientific mission. An additional consideration may be service to IEEE beyond normal expectations.\n\nView Award Recipients\n\nIEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal\n\nThe IEEE Richard W.
