        "text": "Many sponsored programs include funds for travel for project personnel. Here is an overview of travel issues that are common on sponsored programs; go to UW TravelWise portal for a complete list of all current travel policies and procedures.\n\nAir Travel\n\nAir travel is typically limited to the lowest available coach fare. Effective 5 January 2015, all air travel must be booked via the UW TravelWise portal using the Concur system or it will not be reimbursed. Concur uses an automated “lowest logical airfare” policy (which is a $150 tolerance threshold above the lowest rate) that allows users some flexibility in determining airlines, departure dates and times, and routes. For more information on reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses, as well as other policy considerations, please review UW System Administrative Policy 410: Purchase & Payment of Business Air Travel for more information.\n\nAppropriate Modes of Transportation\n\nThe approving authority has the responsibility to determine the most appropriate and cost effective means of transportation consistent with the authorized business purpose of the trip, and to consider all associated costs (e.g. employee work time, overnight lodging, meals, mileage).\n\nFor determining if vehicle transportation makes the most economical sense, MapQuest or Google Maps are the standard applications for calculating time and distance.\n\nResearchers with disabilities or who require reasonable accommodations should contact the UWM Travel Office to discuss their options. An accommodation request may be needed prior to departure.\n\nConference/Workshop/Symposium Fees\n\nThe cost of attending conferences, workshops, symposiums, or other dissemination venues are eligible for reimbursement. Researchers should keep the receipts or other materials that document the registration fee associated with attendance.\n\nLodging\n\nThe University’s maximum lodging rates are based upon the General Service Administration, Departments of State and Defense rates for the location and dates of stay. The maximum rate is for a single/standard sleeping room per person or single occupancy.\n\nFor lodging associated with an externally-designated conference, the maximum lodging rate does not apply if the attendee stays at the venue location. For lodging associated with a UW System-designated conference, the cost may not exceed the maximum rate for the location.\n\nAdditional information regarding maximum lodging rates is available in UW System Administrative Policy 415: Purchase & Payment of Lodging. Additionally, faculty and staff may pre-plan their expenses using the new Lodging and Meal Per-Diem Calculator.\n\nMeals\n\nWhen the University traveler is expected to incur costs for meals and incidentals for overnight business travel, the University will reimburse meal and incidental expenses (M&IE) under a per diem allowance. The maximum M&IE per diem allowance will be at the rate established by the General Service Administration, Departments of State and Defense for the location of each full day’s (24 hours) travel. The M&IE per diem allowance will only be paid when the traveler is expected to incur costs for meals and incidentals; business travel requires an overnight stay outside the traveler’s headquarters and when the travel is supported by a University business purpose.\n\nFor Continental U.S. locations, the incidental portion of the M&IE per diem allowance is $5.00. For Non-Continental U.S. and foreign locations, the incidental portion of the M&IE per diem varies by the location.\n\nTravel that does not include an overnight stay will be limited to a tax reportable day trip meal allowance of $15 per day when the approving authority expects the traveler to incur meal expenses. No day trip meal allowance will be paid when the traveler receives a provided meal, regardless of amount.\n\nFor assistance with calculating maximum M&IE, please use the new Lodging and Meal Per-Diem Calculator. Additional information related to maximum M&IE rates is available in UW System Administrative Policy 420: Travel & Expense – Meal and Incidental Expense (M&IE) Per Diem Allowance Reimbursements.\n\nMiscellaneous Expenses\n\nOther expenses are permitted if they are necessary, reasonable, and allocable for the conduct of University business, such as photocopying, Internet, fax, or telephone services or charges. Keep receipts to verify charges; additional justification may be necessary for some expenses.\n\nPersonal Vehicles\n\nPersonal vehicles may be used for activities on your sponsored project. Reimbursement is provided at the University’s standard mileage rate for personal vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, vans). Business mileage will be reimbursed at the IRS authorized mileage rate in effect on the date of travel using the most direct route. For personal vehicles, this rate is $0.575/mile; for motorcycles it is $0.545/mile.\n\nAll individuals requesting mileage reimbursement must complete a Vehicle Use Agreement on the State of Wisconsin Enterprise Fleet Management System prior to travel (typically a one-time requirement). Reimbursement is typically limited to standard map mileage/calculations; a justification is required for mileage reimbursement requests that exceed the available map mileage/calculations.\n\nAdditional information related to mileage reimbursement is available in UW System Administrative Policy 425: Use of Personal Vehicles, Rental Cars, and Fleet for Business Transportation.\n\nRental Vehicles\n\nRental vehicles may be used for activities on your sponsored project. UW System has contracts with Enterprise and National Car Rental, which must be used if vehicles are available. If traveling in Wisconsin, the State has agreements with Hertz, Enterprise, and National Car. All contracted rental car providers include the cost of insurance in the rates for UW System. If traveling domestically, rental car reservations must be made via Concur.\n\nRentals are limited to compact/standard/intermediate vehicle classes. Claims for reimbursement beyond standard/intermediate vehicle classes (i.e. trucks, vans, etc.) for business reasons such as transporting extra passengers, carrying cargo or bulky equipment, etc., must be explained on the expense report.\n\nAdditional information related to mileage reimbursement is available in UW System Administrative Policy 425: Use of Personal Vehicles, Rental Cars, and Fleet for Business Transportation.\n\nTaxi, Limousine, and Shuttle Services\n\nNecessary, reasonable, and allocable charges for ground transportation are reimbursable. Whenever possible, use shuttle services offered by lodging facilities and/or conference sites, which are typically free. Receipts are required for all fares that exceed $25.\n\nAdditional information related to taxi, limousine, and shuttle services is available in UW System Administrative Policy 430: Travel & Expense – Purchase & Payment Miscellaneous Travel Expenses.\n\nTravel Calculator\n\nUW System has developed a Lodging and Meal Per-Diem Calculator to assist Principal Investigators with developing budget estimates for travel. Use of the Travel Calculator is highly encouraged for those Principal Investigators developing travel estimates for inclusion in federal grant and contract submissions. Under the Uniform Guidance, proposals must now include a detailed breakdown of travel costs (airfare, lodging, meals, registration/conference registration fees, taxi/shuttle services, rental cars, etc.). The Travel Calculator will provide lodging and meal estimates based on location and dates of travel.\n\nTravel by Students, Participants, and Other Personnel\n\nTravel on sponsored programs is typically permitted for students, participants, and other personnel, so long as the travel is necessary, reasonable, and allocable. Travel is usually incorporated into the budget at the proposal stage and approved during the initial award negotiation phase.\n\nThe allocation of travel across cost categories may vary across grant programs. For example:\n\nTravel for undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral students on a research grant will likely be charged to the “Travel” budget category; however,\n\nTravel for undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral students on a training or education grant will likely be charged to the “Participant Support” budget category."
