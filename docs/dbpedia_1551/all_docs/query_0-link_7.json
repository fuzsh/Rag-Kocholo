        "text": "Hydra Cluster Gravity Wave & Gamma Ray Burst Simultaneous?​\n\nRead this before my comment:\n\nWhy Detect Them?\n\nHistorically, scientists have relied almost exclusively on electromagnetic (EM) radiation (visible light, X-rays, radio waves, microwaves, etc.) to study the Universe. Some are trying to use subatomic particles, called neutrinos, as well. Each of these 'messengers' of information provides scientists with a different but complementary view of the Universe.\n\nGravitational waves, however, are completely unrelated to EM radiation. They are as distinct from light as hearing is from vision. Imagine humans were a species that only had eyes and no ears. You can learn a lot about the world around you simply by studying the light from objects. Then one day, someone invents something they call an ear. This device senses vibrations in air or water that you could not have known existed before. This ear opens up an entirely new realm of observation that you didn't have access to simply by studying electromagnetic radiation! As an antenna able to detect vibrations in the 'medium' of space-time, LIGO is akin to a human ear able to detect vibrations in a medium like air or water.\n\nThis is the way in which LIGO has opened a new 'window' on the universe. Things like colliding black holes are utterly invisible to EM astronomers. To LIGO, such events are beacons in the vast cosmic sea.\n\nMore importantly, since gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter (unlike EM radiation, which can be absorbed, reflected, refracted, or bent), they travel through the Universe virtually unimpeded, giving us a clear view of the gravitational-wave Universe. The waves carry information about their origins that is free of the distortions or alterations suffered by EM radiation as it traverses intergalactic space.\n\nThe gravitational waves that LIGO detects are caused by some of the most energetic events in the Universe—colliding black holes, merging neutron stars, exploding stars, and possibly even the birth of the Universe itself. Detecting and analyzing the information carried by gravitational waves is allowing us to observe the Universe in a way never before possible, providing astronomers and other scientists with their first glimpses of literally un-seeable wonders. LIGO has removed a veil of mystery on the Universe and in so doing, has ushered in exciting new research in physics, astronomy, and astrophysics.\n\nWhy Detect Them?\n\nA scientific case for the search and detection of gravitational waves https://ligo.caltech.edu/video/BNS-merge\n\nTo be fair I have to add this in my post even though I believe its a mistake in the associated measurement timings with a gamma ray burst and a gravity wave which is labeled GW170817 if you care to look it up.\n\nNow in this video they say a gamma ray burst appeared 1.7 to 2 seconds later after an observation of a neutron merger gravitational wave. This happened in the Hydra Cluster approximately 105 Million light years away.\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp1Za3N4Sy4\n\nHere are possible few conclusions:\n\nA) The gamma ray burst was closer to an inline coordinate of a plane than the source of the gravity wave of the neutron merger making it seem they were related in timing from source to destination. In other words the gamma ray burst happen to occur closer to earth than the video is telling us or from a different source!\n\nGRB 170817A was a gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected by NASA's Fermi and ESA's INTEGRAL on 17 August 2017.[17][25][26][27] Although only localized to a large area of the sky, it is believed to correspond to the other two observations,[23] in part due to its arrival time 1.7 seconds after the GW170817 event.\n\nB) Their data is correct and gamma ray photons vs gravity waves are simultaneous at the time they occur; therefore, gravity waves (carries of em radiation which runs contrary to what is said at Ligo) act exactly the same as light. To be fair my calculation for March of 2025 maybe wrong due to this information , but I can prove they are wrong and please read below.\n\nC) Major localization errors for gamma ray burst!\n\nFor me this is a bummer if gamma rays and gravity waves are no different for how they travel through space timing wise. However I'm not deterred read this below:\n\nGlobular clusters[edit]\n\nNGC 4993 has an estimated population of 250 globular clusters.[5]\n\nThe luminosity of NGC 4993 indicates that the globular cluster system surrounding the galaxy may be dominated by metal-poor globular clusters.[15]\n\nSupermassive black hole[edit]\n\nNGC 4993 has a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of roughly 80 to 100 million solar masses (8×107 M☉).[16]\n\nI will show you why they are wrong period!\n\nI think they got the localized source wrong for a busy Hydra Cluster with a Supermassive black hole. The gamma ray burst I don't follow as happening simultaneous from the same source as the gravity wave, because it defies physics when compared to a gravity wave. I admit the timing is impeccable, however the source distance to produce the near timing is quite possibly different from a active part of a star cluster.\n\nGamma Rays are very energetic! To visualize the number here it is\n\n0.00000000001 eV/c^2\n\nThere is no theoretical upper limit to the energies of gamma-ray photons and no lower limit to gamma-ray wavelengths; observed energies presently extend up to a few trillion electron volts—these extremely high-energy photons are produced in astronomical sources through currently unidentified mechanisms.\n\ngamma ray | Definition, Uses, Wavelength, Production, Examples, & Facts\n\nGamma ray, electromagnetic radiation of the shortest wavelength and highest energy. Gamma rays are produced in the disintegration of radioactive atomic nuclei and in the decay of certain subatomic particles.

Now that we've seen gravitational waves, what does that mean?\n\nHere is my proof for why the above event is incorrect and I choose\n\nA) The gamma ray burst was closer to an inline coordinate of a plane than the source of the gravity wave of the neutron merger making it seem they were related in timing from source to destination. In other words the gamma ray burst happen to occur closer to earth than the video is telling us or from a different source!\n\nAND\n\nC) Major localization errors for gamma ray burst!\n\nWhen comparing light bending gamma ray photons (0.00000000001 eV/c^2 i.e. larger) to gravitons which are of gravitational waves ( .00000000000000000000016 eV/c^2 i.e. extremely smaller) , you cannot tell me with both their energy signatures that they traveled 105 Million light years coming from a source in a Hydra Cluster expelled simultaneously and arrive at what I consider simultaneously with a 1.7 second delay for the gamma ray. Because you would be talking about some other experimental universe by God where all the physics measurements are completely different for this to happen.\n\nAfter reading what Ligo stated that gravity waves are far different from light and realizing the big difference in energy compared to a graviton and a gamma ray photon. Furthermore, they did use a localization for the gamma ray burst in a large portion of the sky in the Hydra cluster and so the similar source for the gravity wave I know is different for the gamma ray burst. Therefore knowing light bends we can still have hope for my calculation of a Supernova showing for Betelgeuse in March of 2025.\n\nI'm very excited to report what I believe could be some lag time information of light vs. gravity waves. My lag calculation for light as in a Supernova arriving in March 2025 maybe fairly accurate; compared to what I hope was a gravity wave release from a Betelgeuse explosion in 1491 registered on January 14, 2020. Here is my light year lag calculation from the python program gravity wave geometric I designed to a percentage.\n\nMy calculation here:\n\n529.2 534.64 x 100 = 98.98\n\n100 - 98.98 = 1.02 % lag delay of light from Betelgeuse\n\nAccording to the paper below light lag compared to gravity waves deviation is up to 3%.\n\nFig. 2\n\nPlot of the ratio (39) between GW and e.m. luminosity distance (black dashed curve), with the associated error band (grey region) controlled by the best-fit parameters of Eq.\n\nIn the large z limit, however, the ratio dGWL/dLdLGW/dL tends to stabilize on the value ≃0.970≃0.970 (see e.g. Figs. 2 and 3 of [9]), which corresponds to a deviation from the standard Einstein result of about 3%.\n\nComparing the luminosity distance for gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals in a simple model of quadratic gravity - General Relativity and Gravitation\n\nWe compute the modified friction coefficient controlling the propagation of tensor metric perturbations in the context of a generalized cosmological scenario based on a theory of gravity with quadratic curvature corrections. In such a context we discuss the differences between gravitational and...\n\nlink.springer.com\n\nHere is a source about Luminosity Distance stating as an approximation:\n\n2. Standard ruler methods. In these methods, we measure the angular size of something whose linear size we think we know. Angular sizes in astronomy are always small, so we use the small angle approximation to get\n\nQUALITY OF APPROXIMATION The plot below shows the fractional error for the formula above (since the conversions to proper distance and angular diameter distance are exact, the fractional error is the same for all the definitions of distance). The solid line is for the standard benchmark model, in which Ωm = 0.267; the dashed line is for a universe in which Ωm = 1 (the old “standard cold dark matter” model of the 1980s and 90s). Note that the approximation always overestimates the true distance, and that it is better for the matter-only universe than it is when dark energy is added.\n\nFor comparison, the plot below shows the fractional error that arises if we use the simple Hubble law, to calculate the distance in the standard benchmark cosmology. In this redshift range, the error produced by doing this is much larger than it is if we use the q0 formula (25% at z = 0.5 instead of 5%). This is compared to luminosity distance; the error if we compare to angular diameter distance is huge (68% at z = 0.5!) and has the opposite sign\n\nhttp://www.hep.shef.ac.uk/cartwright/phy323/DistancesModerateRedshift.pdf\n\nMy python code with the 1.02 % lag delay of light from Betelgeuse.\n\nHere is the inputs for python calculation:\n\nEnter Number to divide Proton: 4191\n\nSpin Number: 1\n\nEnter number of Parsec's for Luminosity Distance: 150\n\nAdd Parsec's for Luminosity Distance: 19\n\nSubtract Parsec's for Luminosity Distance: 5\n\nPython:\n\nimport time print('''Two to the power of Exponential growth of Gravities Constant <G> multiplied by the fine structure constant multiplied by 12 hours divided by n. ________________________________________ ''') while True: n = int(input(\"Enter Number to divide Proton: \")) s = int(input(\"Spin Number: \")) Parsec = int(input(\"Enter number of Parsec's for Luminosity Distance: \")) Plus_Parsec = int(input(\"Add Parsec's for Luminosity Distance: \")) Minus_Parsec = int(input(\"Subtract Parsec's for Luminosity Distance: \")) start_time = time.time() G_constant = (.00000000006674) proton_width = (((0.00000000000001)*s)/(n)) gravity_wave = ((proton_width)) G = ((pow(2,((1 +(((.00000000006674*.0072973*(12/n))*((( 1 )))))))))) Gravities_Geometry = ((G*3.14)) Distance_to_Gravity_Waves_Source = (((((((G))/(gravity_wave))*86400*365)/((Gravities_Geometry)-((G/2))))/9461000000000000))/1000000 Ligos_approximation_Black_hole_merger_from_luminosity = (1000000*3.26*(Parsec+(Plus_Parsec-Minus_Parsec)))/1000000 difference = (Ligos_approximation_Black_hole_merger_from_luminosity-Distance_to_Gravity_Waves_Source) print('{0:.14f}'.format(G_constant),'Gravitational Constant') # print('{0:.99f}'.format(proton_width),'Proton Width') # print('{0:.110f}'.format(gravity_wave),'Gravity Wave') print(G,'G as exponential growth') print('{0:.15f}'.format(Gravities_Geometry),'Gravities_Geometry') print(\"{:,}\".format(Ligos_approximation_Black_hole_merger_from_luminosity),'Ligos distance approximation from luminosity in light years') print('{0:,.1f}'.format(Distance_to_Gravity_Waves_Source),'Distance Gravity Wave traveled going by ONeils Gravity Geometric') print(\"{:,}\".format(difference),'difference from Ligo and Geometric source in light years') e = int(time.time() - start_time) print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(e // 3600, (e % 3600 // 60), e % 60))\n\n​\n\nKnowing that Betelgeuse is now a neutron star we on earth could be experiencing a gravitational anomaly and oddities if the jets spiral in our direction. Global Climate Change & associated weather conditions of all sorts including earthquakes maybe the new dynamic on Earth magnified by the Betelgeuse Neutron Star. As a matter of fact I have noticed increased weather events since January of 2020 all over the World that are not normal. Perhaps you have been reading the news then you understand. Maybe you have experienced this as Fires, Droughts, Floods, Glacier, Hurricanes, Tornadoes and accelerated polar cap melting if you live near the areas affected. 529 gravity years is relatively close and I would expect all sorts of trouble from a changed star gravity wise especially if its a neutron star with an inline jet flickering our way causing mean temperature rises on Earth.\n\nStarbursts are caused by a special variety of neutron star known as a magnetar. These fast-spinning, compact stellar bodies create intense magnetic fields that trigger explosions, which are known as starbursts. Starbursts cause the Sun to develop low Planetary Indices (Kp) and low Electron flux (E-flux) conditions for the Sun-Earth Environment.\n\nE-flux induces the variation of production of ionosphere currents. Ionosphere currents are produced by geomagnetic storms originating from the Star-Sun-Earth environment. Ionosphere current variation has a direct influence on atmospheric temperature [10, 11]. On 25th December 2004 and 23rd February 2005 hailstorms and snowstorms were reported in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Tropics a sudden drop in temperature led to foggy and smoggy conditions. This temperature variation was different in different parts of the Earth, as the effects of solar flares are dependent on the geomagnetic co-ordinate of Earth and its respective position with regards to the stars. Further, the fluctuation of atmospheric temperatures in the month of December 2005, in the first week of January 2006 and in the last week of December 2007, suggests the direct correlation of the Star-Sun-Earth environment (Figure 1). If the electron flux from the sun is low, with the subsequent rise in cosmic rays simultaneously anomalous snowfall and lowering of the atmospheric temperature has been observed. It would be possible to understand the movement of clouds and snowfall, as well as atmospheric moisture, if we could efficiently calculate the influence of space weather and cosmic influence on the thermosphere and atmosphere of the Earth [12]. Based on the same hypothesis it was found that an abnormal rise and sudden fall in E-flux, Kp index and atmospheric temperature has the possibility of triggering earthquakes in active fault areas of the Earth due to temporary changes in the magnetic field of the Earth. The whole process was expressed as a precursor of earthquakes in active fault areas.\n\nCosmic Influence on the Sun-Earth Environment\n\nSOHO satellite data reveals geophysical changes before sudden changes in the Earth's Sun-Earth environment. The influence of extragalactic changes on the Sun as well as the Sun-Earth environment seems to be both periodic and episodic. The periodic changes ...\n\nNEWS FLASH & CONFIRMATION OF A CORE COLLAPSE WITH BETELGEUSE IN 1491 REGISTERED JANUARY 14, 2020 VIA A GRAVITATIONAL WAVE\n\n​\n\nWhile in the wee hours of the morning sometime at 4:59 a.m. my mind was racing to find confirmation of the gravity wave with the little information provided by LIgo for the Gravitational Burst on January 14, 2020 which has been speculated that came from Betelgeuse. The information we have from them is 64.698303 Hz, however we also have the mass of the Earth and Betelgeuse.\n\nBingo, there is a way to see if a distance reading is compatible with a proton width and spin from my python program and using another piece of code which calculates gravitational force between two masses following up with a Pendulum Gravity Force to Hertz program to allow us to see if we have equivalence with the 64.698303 Hz reading obtained from the Gravity Wave. In other words the 64.698303 Hz matches a core collapse from 1491 due to parity from those calculations of the Pendulum, Gravitational Force and the distance I calculated from my python gravity geometric. Betelgeuse exploded in 1491!\n\nWith a minor adjustment to inputting proton width & spin in my python code, it verifies a frequency analysis from the Grace Database (64.698303 Hz) at Ligo Interferometer. The calculation maintained the 529.2 Gravity Geometric years in my python code which achieved an equivalence reading through a Pendulum and Gravity Force to Hertz Calculation!\n\nFirst off, I'm human capable of mistakes while in a rush to prove something, yet I'm humble and I'm not afraid to show my frailties with the above quote for it is not a proof and I will not delete it. I made a huge mistake with the acceleration of gravity in the\n\nSimple Pendulum Calculator\n\n. I used the force of gravity between Betelgeuse and Earth as the acceleration for gravity which is incorrect . Betelgeuse acceleration for gravity is .003162 m/s² while Earth's is 9.80665 m/s².\n\nMy goal was and still is to show that 64.698303 Hz with a timing of duration of 0.013534 seconds was obtained from a gravity wave maybe from Betelgeuse on January 14, 2020 is capable of pinpointing 535 light years or 529.2 gravity years. All we have is is this information for the recording of the probable gravity from Betelgeuse which was labeled with this name S200114f .\n\n(M ☉ is solar masses)\n\nThere is still hope for a comparison from the first gravity wave GW150914 to S200114f to test if a gravity wave on January 14, 2020 came from 535 light years. The first gravity wave came from a distance of 1,271,400,000 light years as a black hole merger at 65 M ☉ which warped 3 M ☉ to produce a 260 Hz lasting .15 seconds at the top end. So for S200114f, if Betelgeuse exploded on 1491 it would be 17.5 M ☉ at 64.698303 Hz lasting 0.013534 seconds. So hopefully I'll be back to post with a comparative from GW150914 to S200114f as a ratio which can still show us from using Hertz and Mass that Betelgeuse is at 535 light years or 529.2 gravity years.\n\nOk don't hold your breath to long I do now think I have the proof of a core collapse of Betelgeuse in the year of 1491 via a gravitational wave on January 14, 2020.\n\nBy analysis of gravity waves GW150914 to S200114f when compared to a ratio from the Black Hole merger of 65 M ☉ at 260 Hz with Betelgeuse frequency of 64.698303 Hz the gravitational release on January 14, 2020 illustrates Betelgeuse's actual total solar mass of about 16.17 M ☉. This fits neatly with a solar mass approximation article from newswise exactly as they say 16.5 to 19 solar masses. Since the information was limited for the gravitational wave of S200114f, does this new found information derived from the Hertz and timings ratios to mass indicate a core collapse of the star Betelgeuse? .\n\nTheir analysis reported a present-day mass of 16.5 to 19 solar mass--which is slightly lower than the most-recent estimates. The study also revealed how big Betelgeuse is, as well as its distance from Earth. The star's actual size has been a bit of a mystery: earlier studies, for instance, suggested it could be bigger than the orbit of Jupiter. However, the team's results showed Betelgeuse only extends out to two-thirds of that, with a radius 750 times the radius of the sun. Once the physical size of the star is known, it will be possible to determine its distance from Earth. Thus far, the team's results show it is a mere 530 light years from us, or 25 percent closer than previously thought.\n\nStudy of supergiant star Betelgeuse unveils the cause of its pulsations\n\nBetelgeuse is normally one of the brightest, most recognizable stars of the winter sky, marking the left shoulder of the constellation Orion.\n\nwww.newswise.com\n\nBetelgeuse's net M ☉ solar mass loss is 2.4255M ☉. The following is very important towards black hole theoretical science; moreover what about this 3 solar mass with the ratio? Well it must have been involved with the violent collision of the black holes warping space time contributing to the gravity wave. As the giant black holes collided in the first nanoseconds; I postulate the area field was not yet settled and it was in the process of forming the 65M ☉. Thus a shape at its fraction of second collision was different until it settled, moving forward as the smaller black hole when entering the larger may have had a 3 solar mass oblong shape at the instant it was swallowed by the larger then finally rotating at a speed with its new mass.\n\nIn the study, the researchers take a closer look at GW150914, the first gravitational wave signal detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), in 2015. The signal was a product of two IN spiraling black holes that generated a new black hole, along with a huge amount of energy that rippled across space-time as gravitational waves.\n\nIf Hawking’s area theorem holds, then the horizon area of the new black hole should not be smaller than the total horizon area of its parent black holes. In the new study, the physicists reanalyzed the signal from GW150914 before and after the cosmic collision and found that indeed, the total event horizon area did not decrease after the merger — a result that they report with 95 percent confidence\n\nHawking’s Black Hole Theorem Confirmed Observationally for the First Time\n\nStudy offers evidence, based on gravitational waves, to show that the total area of a black hole’s event horizon can never decrease. There are certain rules that even the most extreme objects in the universe must obey. A central law for black holes predicts that the area of their event horizons —\n\nThe exact value can be found using Table II in [52], where the leading harmonic ( = 2, m = 2, n = 0) for a black hole with a spin χ = 0.7 has G c3 MωGW = 0.5326 + 0.0808i, giving a ringdown frequency fGW|ringdown ≈ 260Hz 65M ☉ ,\n\nGroup Burst Detectors H1,L1,V1 Time of Signal 2020-01-14 02:08:18.230000 UTC Time Sent 2020-01-14 02:48:21 UTC False Alarm Rate once per 25.84 years Central Frequency 64.698303 Hz Duration 0.013534 seconds\n\nMap of Orion Constellation for gravity wave S200114f\n\nThe short burst was part of the problem for Ligo to accurately pinpoint the source of a gravity wave on January 14, 2020 and sourcing gravity wave locations is complicated as I understand. This was their shortest burst ever, indicative of a core collapse, because no black hole mergers nor black hole neutron star mergers fit such a short burst. It looks as though they collected some heading information for an area of the sky without the complete pin point location. My ratio calculation of 16.17M ☉ really predicts it to be a fit for Betelgeuse from the limited information provided here with frequency and burst duration. When compared to the first gravity wave ever detected of 65M ☉ from a black hole merger the details provided were 260Hz and .15 seconds duration for GW150914. Without all the information basically we have an artifact to decode in the sky. A 535 light year accurate distance reading would imply this calculation which fits with orbital decay for light retardation.\n\nTheir analysis reported a present-day mass of 16.5 to 19 solar mass--which is slightly lower than the most-recent estimates. The study also revealed how big Betelgeuse is, as well as its distance from Earth. The star's actual size has been a bit of a mystery: earlier studies, for instance, suggested it could be bigger than the orbit of Jupiter. Their analysis reported a present-day mass of 16.5 to 19 solar mass\n\nAbove image Betelgeuse 16.17M ☉\n\nMy calculation here from python code due to my Gravity Geometric predicts like orbital decay near 1% for difference in speed of gravity to light speed:\n\nPython Code link Gravity Geometric Calculation\n\n529.1 ÷ 534.64 = .989 x 100 = 98.963 | 100- 98.963 = 1.03 % delay of light from Betelgeuse due to core collapse in 1491 from a gravity wave on January 14, 2020.\n\nPSR 1913+16 orbital decay The speed of gravity (more correctly, the speed of gravitational waves) can be calculated from observations of the orbital decay rate of binary pulsars PSR 1913+16 (the Hulse–Taylor binary system noted above) and PSR B1534+12. The orbits of these binary pulsars are decaying due to loss of energy in the form of gravitational radiation. The rate of this energy loss (\"gravitational damping\") can be measured, and since it depends on the speed of gravity, comparing the measured values to theory shows that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light to within 1%. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity\n\nThat sky chart makes this gravity wave event and Betelgeuse seem to be close together. The actual coordinates should be considered, though.\n\nBetelgeuse: 5 hours, 55 minutes, 10 seconds; +7 degrees, 24 minutes, 24 seconds\n\nLocalization of S200114F: 7 hours, 20 minutes, 28 seconds to 7hours 28 minutes, 48 seconds; +16 degrees, 53 minutes, 7 seconds to +17 degrees, 44 minutes, 5 seconds.\n\nAt their closest, Betelgeuse and S200114F are along a line of similar declination, but 1 hour and 25 minutes apart in Right Ascension. Assuming my calculations are correct, that places them a bit over 21 degrees apart in the sky\n\nAlthough localization depends on the waveform morphology, approximately 50% of detected signals would be imaged after observing 100–200 deg2 in 2015 and 60–110 deg2 in 2016, although knowledge of the waveform can reduce this to as little as 22 deg2. Unlike many electromagnetic observations, gravitational-wave source position uncertainties are very large, typically larger than 100 deg2. Therefore, gravitational-wave searches produce probability distributions over the sky, rather than single locations, from which meaningful quantities are derived. These probability distributions can have very complicated shapes, including severe fragmentation and spatially separated support. A thorough understanding of these distributions can inform the design of follow-up programs as well as the choice of which events should be pursued. Gravitational-wave source position uncertainties are very large\n\nNot so many people are familiar with Orbital Decay with a light delay, Shapiro Delay with light and Einstein's General Relativity regarding the .12 second delay of light at 1.75 arc seconds. The information I have provided points to a Betelgeuse core collapse. I understand that many people need instant visible evidence yet due to the hard facts that work on the medium of light we will have to wait until the year 2025 to see evidence of Betelgeuse as a Supernova from a gravitational wave on January 14, 2020."
