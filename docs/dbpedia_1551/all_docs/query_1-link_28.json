        "text": "Zierler:\n\nThis is David Zierler, Oral Historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is July 28, 2020. I am so happy to be here with Professor William H. Press. Bill, thank you so much for joining me today. To start, would you tell me your title and institutional affiliation?\n\nPress:\n\nI'm the Leslie Surginer Professor in Computer Science and Integrative Biology at The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd how long have you had that role?\n\nPress:\n\nI've been at the University of Texas about twelve years now, and I've had a couple of different titles. That's my current one.\n\nEarly Life\n\nZierler:\n\nBill, let's talk first about your parents. Tell me a little bit about your parents and where they're from.\n\nPress:\n\nMy father was Frank Press, and my mother was Billie Kallick Press. They were both New Yorkers, raised in Brooklyn. My father was well-known as a geophysicist and was later President Carter's Science Advisor. My mother made her career first as a schoolteacher and later on as an educational administrator in various positions.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhere did they meet?\n\nPress:\n\nThey met in high school in Brooklyn.\n\nZierler:\n\nTell me a little bit about your father's career trajectory. Was he the first in his family to go to school?\n\nPress:\n\nFrank and his two brothers were first generation Americans, the children of immigrants. All three brothers made the transition into the professional class. One became a lawyer, one became a trade-paper publisher, and my father, who was the youngest, became a scientist. My father's history is well-told in several oral history interviews by him and by my mother. He died at the age of ninety-five just last January. I love talking about his career and the amazing trajectory he had, from out of the Jewish ghetto in Brooklyn to becoming a world-famous scientist and scientist-statesman. But I think his story is so nicely told in his own oral histories that I wouldn’t add anything in telling it myself.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat extent did he involve you in his career while you were growing up? Did you have a pretty good idea of what a working physicist did for a living, even as a small child?\n\nPress:\n\nObviously, I had much more of an idea than a person chosen at random in the population. But really, my father was more the canonical 1950s absent father whom I saw mainly at family dinner every night. He was totally absorbed in his work and career. I was much more influenced by my mother. To this day, people who meet me who knew my parents say, \"Bill, you’re just like your mother. And you're not like your father at all!\" I think that may be true of many kids of my generation, whose fathers were less an influence than their mothers. My mother was a schoolteacher as I mentioned, loved teaching, loved teaching her own kids, pushed us to excel, with results both good and bad, but certainly many that she intended.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, when you were seven, and your father moved to Caltech. What do you remember about that, or his earlier professional moves?\n\nPress:\n\nI have a fragmentary memory from when I was not quite three years old, and we spent a summer in Houston, where my father was consulting for an oil company as a geophysicist. Then, the next memories I have are all in Palisades, New York, at what is now the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, then called Lamont Geological Observatory. It was brand new at the time. My father had been a graduate student of Doc Ewing at Columbia, and Doc moved with two or three of his graduate students (who became assistant professors) to Lamont. The first years that I remember are growing up on this big estate that had just a couple of years earlier been the Lamont family estate, \"Torrey Cliff\". We lived in a little house, one of several bungalows that were Lamont servants' quarters. These are still there, I think, and used for visitors. (They’ve been renovated, of course!)\n\nI lived in this idyllic, rural environment through first grade at Palisades Elementary School. My mother was unhappy in Palisades, because there were no career opportunities for her. This is discussed in a diplomatic way in my parents' oral histories.\n\nMy father eventually became unhappy with being in Doc Ewing's shadow. Doc was the kind of supervisor whose name always went first on the paper, pretty much independent of how much work he had done on it. So, when my father moved from Columbia, from Lamont to Caltech, that was really when he spread his own wings professionally as a rising star. It was a big change for me too. It made me a Californian instead of a New Yorker, growing up. Although for years, the kids in school made fun of my New York accent, still somewhat present. I had to learn to say \"wah-ter\" and not \"wau-ter.\" And, \"choc-late,\" and not, \"chaw-clate.\"\n\nGrowing Up in Pasadena, California\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, you spent all your years through high school in Pasadena?\n\nPress:\n\nThat's correct. And that was a good time. Pasadena was a medium-sized city. I could get everywhere by bike or bus. It had a wonderful, large public library. It had an electronics store where I could go in, and wait in line, and plunk down my dollar, and buy electronics components for my various hobbyist projects. I could bicycle to the drug store to drop off film from my Kodak Brownie camera to be developed.\n\nMy mother had gone back to work in teaching, which from my perspective, meant that I was without supervision after school every day. We had a housekeeper at home, who would prepare dinner for when my parents got home. But she and I had an unspoken conspiracy: She would pretend to be keeping track of me, and I could just be out in the neighborhood wherever I wanted.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd in the fifties, you could get away with such a thing like that, and it was okay.\n\nPress:\n\nYeah, absolutely. A year after we arrived in California, we moved from Pasadena to Altadena, which is a suburb up in the foothills. We were two blocks from an open canyon space where I and my friends could run around and do anything, as long as we were careful not to step on rattlesnakes.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, was Caltech itself part of your reality as a kid? Did you hang out on campus at times? Did you have a sense of it before you had a sense of math and science yourself?\n\nPress:\n\nNo, no. I think not at all. Of course, my parents’ social life interacted with the Caltech community quite a lot. My parents would have dinner parties and cocktail parties, at which we kids would run around. So, I had some sense of the social side of what a community of scientists looked like. But not really much sense of what scientific research was. I do have to say, however, although my father may have been physically absent most of the day for most of the years of my upbringing, he clearly created an environment in which it was natural for me to become a scientist. I never felt the slightest pressure for that. It was just an environmental thing.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut what do you mean by that? In what ways specifically?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, for example, there was a room in our house that opened to the outside, intended, I think, as a garden shed. I was maybe just nine or ten years old when my father cleared out half of it and built a workbench for me. \"Bill, this is where you can do your projects.\" And I just grew up with the idea that I should have projects, and, in the vaguest sense, that they should be scientific.\n\nIt wasn't that either of my parents paid attention to what I was doing. It was more a benign neglect. \"If Bill's busy in his workshop, he must be doing something educational.\" In second or third grade, I theorized that all liquids consisted of water with something dissolved in them, and that I could find their essence by putting them out in the sun to evaporate. To my great distress, cooking oil never evaporated to reveal its true essence. I think of this as my alchemy stage.\n\nI then passed on to stages that other physicists have gone through. I built Heathkit electronics, I had an oscilloscope, and an audio oscillator and audio amplifier, and those kinds of practical things. So that's, again, back to what I mean by environmental, where it was natural for me to fall into science, but without really feeling any pressure to do so.\n\nZierler:\n\nBill, was your family Jewishly connected at all growing up? Were you members of a synagogue? Did you observe any traditions?\n\nPress:\n\nMy parents were not religious in any way, but they certainly felt themselves to be culturally Jewish. My father had been bar mitzvahed at age thirteen, for example.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, were his parents more observant? I mean, part of that immigrant story?\n\nPress:\n\nNo, they were good left-wing, socialist New York Jews. Their hero was Eugene Debs. Not communist, however. They were fervently anti-Bolshevik, because they had had quite a time getting out of Russia during the Bolshevik revolution. Frank’s was a secular family, but culturally Jewish enough that the boys of that generation were all bar mitzvahed.\n\nWhen we arrived in California, for a while my parents went to Sunday meetings of Ethical Culture, and my sister and I were in Ethical Culture Sunday school. But, at the age of around twelve, I was yanked out of that and sent to Sunday school at the Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center, and then I was bar mitzvahed at age thirteen. In the next generation, my daughter, Sara was raised entirely secularly. I did take her a few times to Jewish services so that she would not be completely unfamiliar with them. Later in life, when she was a professional photographer, a specialty of hers was Orthodox Jewish weddings.\n\nPost-Sputnik Reforms; High School\n\nZierler:\n\nBill, the long-term effect of Sputnik was enormous nationwide, and I know it had a big impact on you. Do you have a specific memory of the event itself? Or was the impact that you felt more sort of broad in terms of what it did to supercharge math- and science-learning in the United States?\n\nPress:\n\nBoth. I have a specific memory of the first Sputnik. Everyone was looking in the newspaper to see what times just after sunset you could look in the sky and see it. My memory of seeing it in the sky may be a later reconstruction. But it certainly, as you say, Sputnik had a big effect. The immediate post-Sputnik era was an amazing time to be going through public schools in a place like Southern California. We didn't realize then how singular that time was. Even before Sputnik, it was a time when smart women became schoolteachers because there weren't other career opportunities, few opportunities for women to become lawyers or doctors, almost none to become businesspeople at a high level. So, I had wonderful schoolteachers, women, and then also I had some wonderful male teachers who had fought in World War II and then gone to college and graduate school under the GI bill. Some became, for whatever reason, schoolteachers.\n\nThen Sputnik came along, with all these curricular reforms. For example, in seventh grade, my math teacher was a man named Arthur Benedict, who, in the War, had been on one of the islands in the Pacific, involved in exploiting the breaking of the Japanese Purple code. On Fridays, he would tell us war stories. That was a treat.\n\nThe other days of the week, he taught us SMSG math, School Mathematics Study Group, a curriculum that became famous and infamous as the \"new math\". It was a curriculum that had been devised by pure mathematicians. If you're a pure mathematician, and you have the empty slate of seventh grade minds, how do you fill them? The now-infamous answer was: with set theory, and fundamentals of mathematics, and all of this stuff that is of no practical use in terms of what most kids need to learn in mathematics. Richard Feynman came out very much against this kind of a curriculum. But I loved it. I ate it up. What did I know about what should be useful or not useful?\n\nSo, we did SMSG math, and then later on, by the time I got to high school, there was a physics curriculum that had developed post-Sputnik. I can't say I learned much from that- I’ll explain in a minute. Before twelfth grade physics, in eleventh grade, I had a wonderful chemistry teacher, a man named Jacob Sadoff. He was famous in Pasadena, not for being a good chemistry teacher, but because in the evenings he was a shoe salesman in the local department store. The students would go there, not including me, and make him bring out pairs of shoes, shoe, after shoe, after shoe, to try on. Later, long after had graduated, I had a chance to ask him, \"How could you tolerate that? It was so disrespectful of these kids.\" These were not the A students, generally. And he said, \"I don't care. I sold a lot of shoes.\" There were state and national competitions in chemistry. I scored, if I recall, fourth in Southern California. That was nice, nothing too special. But the award had the unfortunate effect of convincing me that I knew everything about chemistry, so I never took any chemistry in college or graduate school. Now, many decades later, I'm working in biology, and I have this regrettable gap in my knowledge.\n\nNow, as to twelfth grade, and physics, my teacher was a guy named Keith Miller. He was the physical education teacher, the gym coach. In this huge public high school, there was no one qualified to teach physics. Mr. Miller volunteered, but sadly did a terrible job. I learned nothing. I cut most classes. In public school at that time and that place, you got two grades in every course. You got a grade for skills, which was the real grade, and then you got a grade for citizenship. They counted equally in your grade average. Mr. Miller gave me an A+ in skills and a D in citizenship. He was a very tolerant man to give me a D. It might have been an F. That, along with my C grades in gym, both in skills and in citizenship, meant that in my high school class of 1,500 graduating seniors, I graduated somewhere around number 100 in grade point average. All of my friends got to go up on the stage and receive awards, and I was relegated to the audience.\n\nZierler:\n\nI wonder if that taught you any long-term rules to live by in terms of civics.\n\nPress:\n\nWell, this is one of the examples of: Do I take after my father, or do I take after my mother? My father was always measured, always careful in dealing with others. My mother was always a smart aleck, trying to do and say the unexpected. And I'm afraid I always took after her, and for many decades into my adult life. I think it wasn't until I was about fifty years old and had moved to Los Alamos to be a senior manager in a large organization that I first realized that maybe a more diplomatic way of dealing with others was the right way to be effective.\n\nZierler:\n\nBill, by the time you were in high school, did you see that you were on a path in science as a career? Were you doing sort of research, either informally or in your lab work at school, which sort of suggested that this was the trajectory that you were on?\n\nPress:\n\nYeah, I think definitely. I wasn't sure whether it was going to be science or mathematics. I certainly didn't want to, \"follow in my father's footsteps,\" as I saw them. But I tended to see them quite narrowly. I thought, \"He's a geologist. I’m not interested in anything like that. I’m interested in either pure mathematics or astronomy or physics.\"\n\nZierler:\n\nSo, you didn't really think of him as a physicist so to speak?\n\nPress:\n\nNo. No, I really didn't. It wasn't until decades later that I first got interested in looking at what my father had done in his early career. I went back, and I read his papers. And I was surprised that they were very mathematical, and that his way of thinking about things was not that different from ways that I thought about physics problems. But my route to becoming a theoretical physicist was not through my father at all. It was other people, starting in college, who had a big effect on me.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhich also suggests, and this gets back to an earlier question, really how little you interacted with your father at least on the basis of his scholarship.\n\nPress:\n\nI think that's right. I don't want to minimize his effect on my career, because as I said, you can see that my parents both channeled me into being a scientist, whether or not I was aware of it at the time. And I'd be foolish to say that his being a well-known scientist didn't affect the way I was able to interact with other famous and wonderful scientists. That was something I took advantage of, mostly unconsciously, sometimes consciously, but overall, it was a pretty subtle effect. Other people had a more direct effect.\n\nZierler:\n\nNow, when it came time to think about colleges, first of all, of course, Caltech is right there. Did you consider sort of going to a world-class university that was literally at your doorstep? Or were you specifically looking at opportunities to sort of move far away from home?\n\nPress:\n\nAbsolutely the latter. I was looking to get as far away as I could. In my high school graduating class of 1,500 people, only about 150 even went to a four-year college at all.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo obviously, this is a much bigger high school than just kids of Caltech faculty members.\n\nPress:\n\nOh, yeah. Caltech was a very small blip in Pasadena High School. Pasadena was a middle-class bedroom community of Los Angeles, an easy commute to L.A. downtown. There were two high schools in Pasadena, one on each side of town. John Muir High School on the west side of town was entirely Black and Hispanic and had the poorer teachers and the fewer resources. Pasadena High School was all white and middle-class and was a wonderful high school.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd when you mean all white, you really mean all white.\n\nPress:\n\nI really mean that out of 5,000 students at Pasadena High School, there were at most a few dozen African Americans, maybe fewer. There were also a few third-generation Japanese Americans whose parents had been interned in camps during the War so outrageously.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah.\n\nPress:\n\nUntil the federal bussing mandates, the schools were de facto segregated, nearly one hundred percent. The realtors in Pasadena had a code. If you were a Black family, they would not even show you a house on the east side of town. This was supposed to be cured by enforced bussing. Just a few years after I graduated, the schools became fully integrated. And then the second wave of de facto segregation began, in the form of white flight. When I was growing up, Pasadena had one small private school. Ten years after I graduated, I think a majority of white families had pulled their kids out of the public schools and put them into newly founded private schools. So, it's just one of these terrible object lessons: You try to do the right thing, and the consequences are not necessarily what you wish for.\n\nCollege Applications\n\nZierler:\n\nOkay. It's an important point though. Besides Harvard, what other schools did you apply to?\n\nPress:\n\nI applied to Harvard, Yale, Chicago, Berkeley, and got into all of them. Out of the 150 kids in my class who went to a four-year college, only fifteen of us went to a college out of state. California, then and to some extent now, is just its own universe. My high school sent, I don't know, thirty or forty kids to Berkeley; but Berkeley wasn’t far enough away from home for me, so Harvard and Yale were my top choices. Of course, the irony was that my father moved from Caltech to MIT at the beginning of my freshman year. So, my attempt at distance failed completely.\n\nZierler:\n\nI didn't know that detail. I didn't know the timing of that. Did you see him in Cambridge at all? Did you spend time with him?\n\nPress:\n\nI went home once a week to do laundry at my parents' house. Right after I heard that I was admitted to Harvard, I went to Berkeley for the summer, working at Lawrence Berkeley Lab in the Powell-Birge bubble chamber group. And while I was there, I had a phone call from my mother, and she said, \"We weren't telling you two kids, but, this last year, Frank's been negotiating to move from Caltech to MIT. \"And we're moving there in the fall, just when you'll be going there, Bill. And, oh, by the way, all your precious possessions in the house here in Pasadena, we'll have the movers pack them up and put them into storage in Cambridge.\" So that came as quite a shock. But it really was convenient having my parents living there, so I could do laundry at their house. And to some extent, visit with them.\n\nMostly, however, it was understood by both my parents and by me that their parenting extended through getting me into college, and then paying the tuition. After that, in a friendly way, my parents and I mostly went our separate ways. My attitude towards my parents was, \"Thank you very much. It's been great. I'm glad you're paying the tuition. I'm pretty much on my own now.\" They had launched me, and I felt empowered to then move on from there. While I may have gone home every week to do my laundry, and I did interact with them, they were both relatively minor influences in my life after that point. Still, there's no question that my father's prominence affected my interaction with other scientists because they knew whose son I was.\n\nAdjusting to Harvard\n\nPress:\n\nWhen I got to Harvard, I learned that I was actually lucky to get in at all, probably in large part because of geographical distribution. Harvard didn’t expect me to do particularly well. I know this because, in my freshman year, I got into trouble over a prank involving phone calls made to the answering machines of deans. I was summoned into the office of the freshman dean. Across his desk, he had opened my admissions record. Very prominently, in the upper left-hand corner, was Harvard's statistical prediction of my future grade average. In large print, it said C+. Pasadena High School sent someone to Harvard maybe once every ten years, and people from big California public high schools generally did not do well in the Ivy League schools back east.\n\nZierler:\n\nDo you have any theories on why that might be?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, I can tell you how hard it was for me. First of all, it was a huge culture shock, being immersed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, versus Pasadena, California. Second of all, thrown together were about half people from public schools and about half preppies—kids from private schools, especially New England residential private schools. Those kids knew how to study. Even if they weren't going to be the best Harvard students, even if they were going to be the ones to graduate with a B or C average, they had skills that, coasting through public high school as a smart kid, I had just never learned.\n\nI arrived, and I enrolled in the highest-level pure math course that I could get into. And I did poorly. In terms of non-science and math things, I enrolled in a junior-level course in East Asian history that was being taught by John Fairbank, the famous China scholar, and Edwin Reischauer, the famous Japan scholar. And I got a C in that. This was a real shock.\n\nIt was never explained as such to entering public-school kids, but there were really two tracks through Harvard. There was the track through a great, great research university, where in your field of choice, whether it be in the sciences or anything else, you could dig deep and learn a great amount. And then there was a track for people who were going to go off and do things in the world that were not academic. There had to be a track through Harvard that let them graduate with a respectable B average, not necessarily taking the same courses as the people who would become academic scholars and leaders in intellectual fields.\n\nSo, there were courses that were \"gut courses\", and then there were courses that were definitely not. The catalogue didn't tell you which were which. You had to ask around to find out. Once I learned to take an appropriate mixture of gut courses, I did okay. The guts were always interesting, amusing, easygoing, and you could get an easy A, or A-.\n\nZierler:\n\nAt what point did you settle on physics?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, basically, when I discovered that I couldn't do pure mathematics. And that was pretty early on, so already by the beginning of sophomore year, I declared my major as physics. In high school, I had only the slightest hint of what pure mathematics was. In my senior year, I was able to take the calculus course that was offered at Pasadena City College, commuting there during school hours on my little Honda motorbike. Now, normally, Pasadena City College, a good two-year, junior college then and now, would offer a kind of vanilla calculus course. But that particular year, they had hired for the course a graduate student of Tom Apostol, the Caltech professor. Apostol had written a famously abstract first-year calculus book. That was the textbook being offered to a mixture of junior college students and a few of us high school students taking the course.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you have an idea at the time how out-of-the-world this was for a junior college kind of course?\n\nPress:\n\nI did. I did. Here's an example of my father's sort of hands-off influence: He looked at Apostol’s book, and he said, \"Let me give you the calculus book that I used when I was a freshman in college.\" I wish I could remember what the name of it was. It must've been written in the 1920s. It had infinitesimals instead of the more rigorous delta-epsilon limits, and so on. All he had to do was give me that book, and I could eat it up. Well, that's all consistent with my discovering that I could do practical mathematics and do well in the kind of mathematics in physics courses. But I just didn't have that special abstraction of mind to do pure math. I could never have been a good mathematician. At the same time, I wasn’t finding physics courses completely easy, maybe from having skipped all the physics classes in high school. My first-semester freshman physics instructor was Dan Kleppner, who was then just a new assistant professor.\n\nZierler:\n\nHe must've been in his late twenties at that point? He must've been really young.\n\nPress:\n\nEarly thirties. When he moved to MIT with tenure, he of course became very famous. As an example of what kind of thing just stumped me, it took me a long time to realize that physics courses didn’t teach what's true, they teach an agreed-upon set of abstractions that are useful. The first week of freshman mechanics, you learn that when you put a weight on the table, gravity exerts a downward force, and the constraint from the table exerts an exactly equal and opposite upward force. And I just couldn't understand that. How could the table know exactly what force to exert?\n\nI think I was two months into the semester when I realized that I actually did have some physical intuition, a term of art well-known to physicists. So, I shouldn't be stumped by not understanding the equations. I should think about it physically. I thought about constraint forces, and I realized that the table wasn't infinitely rigid, that the weight sort of depressed itself into the table a little bit. We had learned about harmonic oscillators by this point. There was a restoring force that would increase linearly until it equaled the force of gravity. Suddenly, I was able to do those kinds of problems. I realized that as I used physical intuition, and also thought about the equations, I should also try to understand the nature of the abstraction being made. I think that's something that's very poorly taught in physics. Then and now.\n\nZierler:\n\nInteresting. Would you say that this is a perspective that you've kept close throughout your career?\n\nPress:\n\nYeah. I pretty quickly understood that my strength was going to be physical intuition. And I could capitalize on that strength by being just mathematical enough to understand how the equations embodying that intuition ought to come out. Then, I could either work it out myself, or, more usual in my subsequent career, find someone to collaborate with who was really mathematical. Very often I could be the impedance matcher between a physical viewpoint and a purely equation-based mathematical viewpoint.\n\nInfluences of Harvard Faculty\n\nZierler:\n\nParticularly in the physics department, were there professors that you became close with?\n\nPress:\n\nI wouldn’t say I was close with Kleppner. That was just my baptism by fire in what a Harvard physics course looked like. In the second term, however, electromagnetism was taught by Ed Purcell, who was very influential on me, and became one of my scientific heroes.\n\nZierler:\n\nI want to ask first about Purcell's style as a teacher. What was he like in the classroom?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, he was exactly like the book that he wrote. Which was one hundred percent committed to the idea that the physics could be described before you tried to write down equations, that the physics could be described by a kind of intuitive geometrical perspective. In electromagnetism, you could understand lines of force intuitively before you ever knew what equation they came from. Given that I had already discovered that I wasn't good at pure math, and I did have some degree of physical intuition, I really grooved on this. He became my model of what a physicist should be. Ed Purcell was always approachable. Anybody in his class could go knock on his door and come and ask him a question, and he would always have some interesting gadget on his desk that had nothing to do with the freshman course. He was a wonderful, sharing man who loved physics and loved teaching physics.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd clearly, he was formative for your own intellectual development as a physicist.\n\nPress:\n\nHe was. You’ll see in a bit that, in graduate school, I had to unlearn some of that. I had to learn that there were other styles of doing physics that I needed to master. But if I'm listing influences, another interesting one was Dick McCray. He taught the only astronomy course I took at Harvard. McCray, became, later at the University of Colorado, one of the great theorists of his generation.\n\nBut he was an absolutely new assistant professor at that point, and he didn't have a clue how to teach. It was a course with half a dozen Harvard seniors. We were all cocks of the walk. We weren't going to take any nonsense from a green assistant professor. McCray would come in and hand out a problem set, and we would look at it and tell him which problems we wished to do and which we didn't want to do. Later, as an assistant professor at Princeton, I found myself on the opposite side of this kind of transaction. At both Harvard and Princeton, there's a fixed pecking order in which senior undergraduates outrank junior assistant professors. Maybe it’s they're going to graduate and become the donors that keep the university going. Still, Dick must have taught us something. Among the six of us, three became professors of astronomy: me; Bob Kirshner, who became a professor at Michigan and then Harvard; and Rich Gott, who became a professor of astronomy at Princeton.\n\nZierler:\n\nWho else influenced you?\n\nPress:\n\nI took Norman Ramsey's quantum mechanics course. Ramsey had a set of mimeographed lecture notes. I was visiting my parents while I was taking that course, and I said to my father, \"Well, I'm enjoying Professor Ramsey's quantum mechanics course. And he has these lecture notes.\" My father said, \"Oh, can I look at them?\" He looked at them, and he started laughing because he had taken Norm Ramsey's quantum mechanics course as a first-year graduate student at Columbia in 1946. And the notes were identical. They hadn't changed in an entire generation. Norm, who, later, as a colleague, I got to know pretty well, had simply perfected the art of teaching first semester quantum mechanics.\n\nSenior year, I took Schwinger's course, called Advanced Quantum Mechanics. It was a graduate course. He brushed off advanced quantum mechanics in about a week and then started teaching Source Theory, which is something known now only to historians of science. This was Schwinger's attempt to redress the balance that his way of doing quantum electrodynamics had lost out to Feynman's way of doing quantum electrodynamics, namely Feynman diagrams and so on. And so now, twenty years after that, Source Theory was his way of thinking about, I guess, strong interaction physics. At the time, it was completely not obvious to me what that course was about. And to this day.\n\nI dutifully attended all of Schwinger’s lectures, and I took notes, and I learned absolutely nothing. Schwinger never looked at a student’s problem set, and he never looked at a final exam. He had a grader who did those things. My problem sets would come back with grades like 0.5 out of 10. On the final exam, I looked at the questions and realized that this was going to be another 0.5, but now out of 100. I wrote on the first page of my blue book, \"Dear Grader, I have been accepted for graduate school at Caltech. If I fail this course, I will not be able to go to Caltech, and I will be drafted and sent to Vietnam. Please take this into consideration.\" And I got a B. That's my Schwinger story.\n\nZierler:\n\nDid you even try to approach him?\n\nPress:\n\nIt was clearly impossible. Even his graduate students. Schwinger saw his graduate students a couple of hours per semester. Throughout his career, he delivered beautifully polished lectures. But he was lecturing to himself. If the audience were full of Schwingers, he would've been better appreciated.\n\nAt this time, I really didn't know whether to think of myself as a theoretical physicist (in the making) or as an experimental physicist. I always had term-time jobs, grading and working in the physics labs. My financial arrangement with my parents was that, for college, they would pay tuition, room, and board. I was supposed to find jobs, summer jobs and term-time jobs, to pay my miscellaneous living expenses, which at the time was possible to do.\n\nExperience with Experimental Physics\n\nPress:\n\nMy junior and senior years, I worked in Gerald Holton's high-pressure physics lab. I never saw Holton, although, when I came back to Harvard as a professor, I came to know him as a colleague. Gerry had inherited Percy Bridgman's high-pressure lab. The equipment was from the 1920s. Bridgman had used it for the research that led to his 1946 Nobel Prize. Now, by my time, Holton was already primarily an historian and philosopher of science. He was already involved in the Einstein Papers at Princeton, and he had founded the journal Daedalus. In any case, he was never in the lab. But the lab was still there, and he had a post-doc, a guy named Steve Hawley. Steve was supposed to get publishable results in high-pressure physics out of this ancient, literally hand-pumped high-pressure equipment. I was assigned to Steve. Steve tried to make an experimental physicist out of me because really, these jobs were what we would now call internships—supposed to be learning opportunities. I soon enough learned that I just wasn't very good at laboratory work. I mean, I was just all thumbs. But also, I didn't know when or how to ask for help.\n\nAt one point, Steve sent me off with, \"Go to the stock room, buy the parts, and build a twelve-volt, five-amp power supply with less than three-tenths of a percent ripple,\" or some set of specifications like that. I looked in Purcell's freshman physics book to figure out how to do this. I had no idea that there were things like active components, or voltage regulators, or any such thing. So, I ordered a big enough capacitor and big enough choke (inductor) to meet the specifications that were given, calculated as a freshman physics problem. It turned out that the inductor weighed thirty pounds, and my power supply had to be moved on a cart. Hawley looked at it and decided that he would never again assign me to do practical things.\n\nWhat he did instead, which was wonderful for me, was assign me to take over the data reduction for his experiments. I had to learn to use the time-sharing computer that Harvard had just bought and migrate all the data off of IBM cards. This wasn’t my first introduction to computing. The summer before college and the summer after my freshman year, I had summer jobs at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. That was computing with IBM cards.\n\nAnyway, by the time I graduated from Harvard I knew I wasn't cut out to be an experimental physicist. But some remaining ambiguity about this helped me get into graduate schools, I think. It still looked, from my record and my letters of recommendation, like I might be an experimenter. There was a glut of people who wanted to do theory, and my experimental work, even all-thumbs, set me apart. The admissions committees probably thought that if I failed at theory, I could still be an experimenter.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd, Bill, would you say looking back that you gave experimentation an honest shot, just to see what your aptitude was in that?\n\nPress:\n\nExperimental physics would've been the natural outgrowth of my experience growing up, having my own workbench, and building Heathkits, and so on. And again, environmentally, my father was more an experimental physicist than a theoretical physicist, at least in the time that I was growing up. He was then famous for building new kinds of seismographs, and for early applications of computers to reducing seismic data. To this day, at home, I'm always fiddling around with peculiar projects in my shop and around the house.\n\nBut I learned that I didn’t have the concentration on detail that you need to be a good experimental physicist. Theorists are always derogating experimentalists, \"Oh, their brains are in their fingertips.\" To me, that sounds like a big compliment, because it's exactly what I didn't have—brains in my fingertips, the way good experimenters had.\n\nWHRB and Student Activism\n\nZierler:\n\nBill, before we get to the kinds of graduate schools that you were thinking about applying to, I want to switch for a minute over to the social scene during your undergraduate years. Of course, the late 1960s, there's all kinds of interesting things that are happening on campus and beyond. What was your personal relation to the various protest movements that were going on in Cambridge at the time, the anti-war movement, Civil Rights, Women's Rights movement? Did you tend to sort of get yourself in the middle of that, or were you sort of more aloof from those issues?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, I was involved, but in a strange way. The circle I was in was totally sympathetic with those issues. But I have to tell you more precisely what my circle was. This is the answer to, what did I actually do in my four years at Harvard, besides physics? The answer: WHRB, the undergraduate radio station. People think that you go to Harvard to take courses, get grades, get your degree. That's true enough. But almost all Harvard undergraduates- I think Harvard admissions selects for this, take up some activity, some passion, that comes to occupy most of their waking hours. I don’t mean coursework. It might be athletics, it might be the Harvard Crimson. In my case, it was WHRB. I spent by far more hours at WHRB than I did studying, or in classes, or anything related to physics. The radio station was its own self-contained enterprise. Harvard donated the space, but it was run by us undergraduates—no such thing as a faculty advisor, even. I learned a lot. Everybody did a little bit of everything. I mostly did studio engineering and engineering construction, again using my not-very-good fingertips to build electronics stuff; and I did a bit of announcing. Then I became seriously interested in classical music, and became classical music director, and did that for a couple of years. If you were a music listener in the Boston area and tuned to WHRB (one of just two classical music stations), what you heard was what I thought you should hear. That was really a lot of fun.\n\nOkay, but back to your question. In the student protests, WHRB was very much involved, but as supposedly neutral journalism. My classmate Chris Wallace became famous later on as a career journalist. Of course, it may have helped that his father was Mike Wallace.\n\nWhen students took over University Hall and ejected the deans, and later the police were called, I was in the middle of all that. I was in and out of University Hall. What was I doing? I was stringing wire out the windows because we knew that when the police were eventually called, the first thing they would do is try to cut off our broadcasting from inside. We strung multiply redundant cables through the air to freshman dorm room windows, and then from there, through telephone wires back to the radio station.\n\nZierler:\n\nThis is guerrilla journalism.\n\nPress:\n\nOf course. We weren't completely neutral, obviously. Clearly our sympathies were with the students. But because our broadcasts were perceived as neutral, or at least not completely given over to the students' side, we ended up being go-betweens for the negotiations between the students and the administration. Those were very interesting meetings to be in on. Still, that spring, my main worry was, would I be drafted or not? Would the Vietnam War interfere with my going to graduate school?\n\nZierler:\n\nBill, how systematically did you think through what you might do if you were drafted? Did it ever become a real-enough possibility that you really had to think about what your response might've been?\n\nPress:\n\nIt was painfully obvious that the kids who were being killed in Vietnam were not the educated white kids, but the poor, African American, Hispanic, and other minority kids.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd you recognized this at the time?\n\nPress:\n\nYes. Realistically, I wasn't afraid of being suddenly snatched out of Harvard and finding myself in a Vietnamese rice paddy. Looking back, I say this with some feeling of guilt. The Vietnam War had many repercussions, one of which was a deepening of class lines between those who were drafted and those who managed to get out of it. Realistically, the penalty I was facing was to lose a couple of years out of my life doing a boring desk job somewhere. Maybe that would be in Saigon, but more likely somewhere like Huntsville, Alabama. So, the worry was more about disruption than fear of danger. In my Harvard class of about 1,000 men (Harvard had not yet merged with Radcliffe) the number killed in Vietnam is very small. One or two people, if I recall. The fraction who did any military service at all must be well under ten percent, despite the draft. Al Gore was in my Harvard class. He was the son of a senator, and he enlisted.\n\nComputer Hacking\n\nZierler:\n\nLet’s go back to computers. At that point, as you're weighing the various options before you, are you seeing computers as part of the equation, no matter what it is that you end up doing?\n\nPress:\n\nI was not yet seeing that I would end up, in graduate school, riding a wave of new applications of computers to physics. But I was already in love with computer hacking. I mean hacking in the sense that you don't just write the program to do the science. You're in love with the computer and its internals, and you just stay up all night trying to get as deep into the computer as possible.\n\nZierler:\n\nSo, when you're using the word hacking at this early stage, you're not talking about disrupting systems. You're just trying to get into the machine.\n\nPress:\n\nWell, not maliciously disrupting systems. But, my first computer hacking was not entirely above board. We're back in Gerry Holton’s lab. I had reduced some data for Steve Hawley, and he was happy with it. But a week later, he got the bill for my computer time and he just couldn’t afford me. I said, \"Let me see what I can do.\"\n\nThe computer was a time-sharing system, basically just a mainframe computer, but with many people on terminals working simultaneously. An individual user almost never could crash the whole machine. Time-sharing systems had to be well-engineered in that respect. These systems grew out of the Multics effort at MIT, historically. What I had discovered was that it wasn't hard for an individual user to crash his own session. You could write a program to do it intentionally. You'd run that program, and suddenly the teletype would type, \"Login:\" as if you had never been logged in. All your charges for the previous session got lost. This was an example of someone's bad software design: When you logged out, the system totaled up your charges and booked them. If you managed to get off the machine without logging out, you were home free.\n\nI went back and told Steve Hawley, \"It's okay, Steve. From now on, all your computing will be free.\" And it was. Now, obviously this raises the question, was I stealing? Was I a thief? Was I committing a crime at the time? The answer is yes, but it is also a little muddled. At the time, these kinds of pranks were seen as fooling around within the envelope of an experimental, newfangled system. It was different from sneaking into the chemistry stock room and stealing something, for example. I never, ever would've considered doing anything like that.\n\nI saw, over the next few years, a phase change in attitudes. Computer hacking that we did would now be called dishonest, or even criminal; but it wasn't born that way. There was a change in social expectations. Was I ever caught hacking, and was I disciplined? Yeah, all the time. I would get summoned to the office of the Director of the Computer Center and get yet another verbal slap on the wrist. I was the leader of a group of hackers. They knew who we all were- we all came from the radio station, unsurprisingly. We discovered many wonderful things deep in this machine. To the extent that I'm a computer scientist today, a lot of the basic principles I learned about operating systems and machine architecture, I learned hacking into machines then.\n\nWe discovered at one point that we weren't the only group hacking this computer. This other group was destructive. They were wiping out people's files. Our group was hauled into the computer authorities. They threatened to refer us to the dean for serious disciplinary action. It's not us, we told them. We promised to find the other hackers and get rid of them. In return for that, we wanted the computer center to forgive all our hacking, past, present, and future. They didn't exactly agree to that, but they let us proceed.\n\nWe did find that other group. They were the famous MIT phone phreaks who had built blue boxes and black boxes to cheat the telephone company. That's its own whole story, one that has been told in a book by Phil Lapsley and in other places. This group of kids at MIT brought the whole Bell system to its knees, forced the reengineering of the entire Bell toll charging system. Theirs was a mixture of adolescent prank and criminal activity. They were trying to diversify and become computer hackers. Fortunately for us, they were terrible at computers.\n\nOnce we figured out who they were, then, Mafia-like, we and they divided up the territory. We would be the computer hackers in Cambridge. They would be the phone phreaks. Our two groups got together once a week at midnight for a one-hour seminar series. We taught them computer hacking, but only theoretically. They taught us phone phreaking. To this day, I have a lot of knowledge, now completely out-of-date, about how Bell System Long Lines worked.\n\nChoice of Graduate School\n\nZierler:\n\nListening to your overall undergraduate experience, it certainly doesn't sound like there's an absolute linear line to pursuing a physics graduate education. You were interested in lots of things. You could've gone in any direction. And so, I'm curious how that informed the kinds of opportunities that you saw before you, both in terms of fellowships, or jobs, or graduate programs, or perhaps taking time off. Many eminent physicists say, \"This is the path that I was on, and this is what I was doing, one hundred percent straight ahead.\" It doesn’t sound like the case for you.\n\nPress:\n\nThat's a great question. First of all, we can eliminate taking time off because I didn't have that option, because I would've been drafted. My only hope of not being drafted was to get a graduate deferment by going to graduate school in physics. Later, even these deferments were eliminated.\n\nI was interested in all kinds of other things, but I considered those things \"extra-professional.\" I was immersed in computer hacking and in classical music. I spent hours and hours listening to classical music, programming classical music at the radio station, writing scripts for radio features. Some friends at the radio station became musicologists and performing musicians of note. Robert Levin, who became a pianist, harpsichordist, and composer, as well as a Harvard professor, was a friend. But I was already on a track where my profession was going to be physics. I only applied to graduate schools in physics.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah. So, you never really strayed from this idea that physics was really your bread and butter throughout your undergraduate years?\n\nPress:\n\nI think once I discovered I was good at it, and once I became inspired by people like Ed Purcell as a scientist and human being, people like Kleppner and McCray and Ramsey as physicists, then I was just in the groove to go to physics graduate school. I got in everywhere I applied.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhich was where? We've already established that you're pretty well-rooted in pursuing theory in graduate school, right? So now that leads to, what are the programs that are doing the most consequential work in theory at the time? And, what kind of advice did you get from your professors at Harvard? And were there individuals that you were thinking that you specifically wanted to work with as well?\n\nPress:\n\nI applied to Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, and Caltech.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat was your specific perspective on Harvard? One school of thought is, \"You're at Harvard. Why would you go anywhere else?\" And the other, of course, is, \"It's time for you to see the bigger world out there.\"\n\nPress:\n\nI was (and am) a total believer in the second of those. Harvard was my last choice.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut in terms of the advice that you got?\n\nPress:\n\nLet's go through the four because they all were somewhat different. I think that my number-one choice throughout was Caltech. It is hard to say exactly why. An element was returning to my hometown. I grew up in Pasadena, even though I had very little familiarity with Caltech while I was growing up. My father was, by this time, no longer there.\n\nZierler:\n\nI wonder if, also, you had to go to Harvard to appreciate Caltech, in the sense that you never could've appreciated as a high schooler in Pasadena.\n\nPress:\n\nWell, I never would've considered Caltech as an undergraduate. I understood that it was a science school. I wanted a broader, liberal arts education. The other big effect drawing me back to Pasadena was that my girlfriend, who I knew in high school, who became my wife, Margaret Lauritsen, was the daughter and granddaughter of Caltech physics professors. She was close to her family. She was much closer to her family, in our college years, than I was to mine. So, the idea of us moving together back to the Los Angeles area, both going to graduate school there, her being close to her family, I think that was a factor.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd were you married as an undergraduate, or only when you started graduate school?\n\nPress:\n\nMarried at the very beginning of graduate school. But we were together through all our undergraduate years. Together in a commuting sense. Margaret went to Berkeley and graduated from there in three years. She then transferred as a special student to MIT my senior year. For the three years, I spent a lot of time in Berkeley. Harvard had long vacations, and I would do an extra week on each side of every vacation and spend them in Berkeley with Margaret. So, when you asked about Harvard in those turbulent years, in the sixties, I was about equally immersed in Berkeley's turbulent scene. I was tear-gassed in People's Park by the police even though I was there only as a tourist.\n\nZierler:\n\nWas there a particular person you wanted to work with at Caltech?\n\nPress:\n\nThrough my parents, I had grown up knowing socially, slightly, some of the Caltech physics professors. Not Kip Thorne, because he had arrived at Caltech just two years earlier, in 1967. But I knew of Kip Thorne. He had written a famous 1967 Scientific American article on gravitational collapse that I read. Maybe it was through Margaret's father, Tommy Lauritsen, hearing about this rising superstar that they had hired, the youngest full professor in the department, and so on. In any case, general relativity and gravitational collapse was a hot subject then.\n\nSo, Kip was known as a rising star at Caltech. Besides Kip, everybody wanted to go to Caltech and work with Dick Feynman. But you arrive at Caltech, you want to do theory, and it takes about five minutes for you to learn from the rumor mill that working with Dick Feynman is a bad idea. If you could do it at all. Feynman took on very, very few students, and the students he took on tended to be students that he just got along well with personally, irrespective of whether they were any good. I wanted to do either particle physics, which was on the cutting edge, or general relativity, which was also on the cutting edge. Interestingly, not astronomy per se. The fact that I drifted into astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology came later. I went to Caltech wanting to do something very pure. Either very pure general relativity or very pure particle physics.\n\nZierler:\n\nBefore you actually made that decision to go to Caltech, what about the other schools?\n\nPress:\n\nA lot depended on where Margaret got in to graduate school. Margaret had been an undergraduate at Berkeley, and she was applying to graduate schools in linguistics. The linguistics professors at Berkeley knew her, and she almost surely could get in there. I could too. Berkeley took a huge graduate entering class. So that was one possible place.\n\nMIT was another. The attraction there in linguistics was Chomsky. Margaret was there, my senior year, as a special student, and she had gotten to know some of the linguistics professors, although Chomsky not at all. But she had taken Morris Halle’s course. He was Chomsky’s longtime collaborator. If Margaret had gotten into the MIT Linguistics Department as a regular PhD student, I probably would've gone to MIT. Margaret got into UCLA, which was a very good place, if not quite as good as MIT. So, the attraction of her family living there, and Feynman and Thorne at Caltech, that decided it.\n\nHertz Graduate Fellowship\n\nZierler:\n\nLet's talk about Livermore. How did that opportunity come about?\n\nPress:\n\nI wish I could remember where I first heard of the Hertz Foundation. This was a little foundation that, from an undergraduate's perspective, was just a notice on the bulletin board for graduate fellowships. Someone must've pointed me to it. The Hertz Foundation awarded graduate fellowships that paid twice as much as any other graduate fellowship, for example the NSF fellowships. It was not obvious who they were- just a little private foundation that gave fellowships in the applied physical sciences, valid only at a certain list of top schools.\n\nAll of the schools that I applied to were on that list. So, I applied for their fellowship. What did I know, and when did I know it? The Hertz Foundation was in fact a creature of Edward Teller. When I applied, it had been giving fellowships for only a couple of years. Teller had gone around to his rich friends, including John Hertz—no relation to Heinrich Hertz, the nineteenth-century physicist. John Hertz founded Hertz Rent-a-Car and, before that, the Yellow Cab Company, so he had made a fortune several times over. He was a staunch American capitalist who could very much groove on Teller's right-wing politics.\n\nHertz and his wife Fannie already had in place a foundation for their smaller philanthropic endeavors. Edward took control of it and installed a board of directors that read like a litany of extreme right-wingers of the time, especially controversial because these were the Vietnam years. J. Edgar Hoover was on their board of directors. General Curtis B. LeMay, who was famously quoted as wanting to bomb the Soviet Union back to the Stone Age. And so on. Had I known more about the Hertz Foundation I might not have applied. I had no political sympathy for them. But I had no idea. You couldn’t just Google and find out things in those days.\n\nAnyway, I did apply. One afternoon, I was in Gerry Holton's lab when the physics department secretary came rushing in and said, \"Do you know Edward Teller?\" I said, \"You mean the father of the hydrogen bomb? No.\" She said, \"Well his office is on the line, and they want you to call them back at this number and then fly to New York City immediately tonight.\" Why New York City? Because there was an American Physical Society meeting going on. This was supposed to be my Hertz Fellowship interview.\n\nIn those days, you could leave Harvard at 2:00 in the afternoon, and you could be in New York City by about 5:00, with no reservations, flying for next to nothing on the Eastern Airlines shuttle at student fare. So many ways in which the world has changed to make those facts no longer true! Well, there was a hotel suite where the Hertz Foundation had set up camp, and they had never heard of me. They had no record of my application.\n\nI said, \"But I got a phone call from Edward Teller's office.\" They said, \"Oh, well, then you probably applied. Okay, we'll interview you.\" They rounded up a couple of Livermore Lab folks to interview me, one of whom was Lowell Wood, who I later got to know well, and who later also became infamous in his way. It was a peculiar interview. The questions were just out of left field. \"What do you think about gravitational collapse? What do you think about hydrogen bombs?\" They didn't mean politically. They meant; how did I think the bombs worked? What was the physics of it?\n\nUnrelated to the politics of the Hertz Foundation, the kinds of students they were looking to award fellowships to were very much of the Ed Purcell, physical-intuition type. I came to learn that that was also the Edward Teller way of thinking about physics, of visualizing how things worked, visualizing things geometrically, and so on.\n\nI got the fellowship, and along with the fellowship came an offer of a summer job at Livermore Lab. It wasn’t a requirement to take the job, but it paid much more than other typical summer work, so I went to work at Livermore that summer. A very interesting experience. On the one hand, my interactions with Edward Teller soon confirmed that all of the terrible things that people said about him were true, that he was an extreme anti-Communist, right-winger with an unfortunate, large political influence. At the same time, one didn't have to interact much with Edward to learn that his politics were walled off from his mentoring of students. You could look at the people and the fields that Hertz Fellowships were awarded to, and there was no political coloration in it. Then and now, I think that Teller was a very evil man. Not just misguided, not just on the wrong side of history, but really evil in the sense of believing that the ends, as he saw them, justified any means.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhich ends are those, Bill?\n\nPress:\n\nThe defeat of the Soviet Union. The implacable hatred of everything Russian. This isn't the place to try to retell Edward Teller's history.\n\nZierler:\n\nNo, but it's valuable to hear your perspective.\n\nPress:\n\nI'll tell you, decades later, in 2002, I read Edward's published memoirs. I knew a lot of the people that he was describing, not in his early history, of course, but the later years. I was struck by the fact that everybody already dead was stabbed in the back in his memoir, and everybody still alive was treated very gently. Why? Because the living were still around to contradict his self-serving retelling of events or to criticize him for his politicizing every possible event.\n\nSo, politically, I have no love of Edward or of his disciple Lowell Wood (I think that's really the accurate word). But they were both, especially Lowell because I saw much more of Lowell than I did of Edward, excellent mentors, not just to me but to all the people they took under their wing at Livermore. It's just one of these decisions in life. You can decide that some people are so evil politically that you want nothing to do with them. Or you can decide, \"Let’s see what I can learn here, for my own benefit, while staying clear of their politics.\" It’s not always an easy choice, but I made it.\n\nJust a hint of the Foundation’s right-wing origins: As a Hertz Fellow I had to sign an annual pledge that, in a \"national emergency\", I would devote my efforts to the \"defense of the United States\". These were not neutral words during the Vietnam years. Another condition was that I was supposed to do my thesis research in an \"applied physical science\". So, before accepting the fellowship, I called Lowell Wood, and told him that I wanted to go to Caltech and work in general relativity. Would this be a problem? Lowell said, \"Well, by my way of thinking, general relativity is an applied physical science, and I feel that for the United States to be strong in general relativity is also to strengthen its national defense. But if you want, I'll go to Edward, and I'll get him to give you a call and reassure you that he also agrees.\" This wasn't necessary. Lowell was so close to Edward that he could speak for him in all such matters.\n\nI was supported as a Hertz Fellow for all my years in graduate school, and I never heard a peep that I was working on something out of what they thought was applied physical science in support of the defense of the nation. But, subtly, they knew what they were doing. My Hertz experience introduced me to the world of national security and defense science, which later became a big part of my whole career, culminating when I went Los Alamos as Deputy Laboratory Director. So, in their terms, their bet on me paid off. Not just me. If you look at where Hertz Fellows have gone, a number of them have made their careers in national security, including in the military. There are a couple of Hertz Fellows who have become flag or general officers.\n\nTeller, in person, couldn't help being a caricature of himself. Peter Sellers in the movie Doctor Strangelove is absolutely aping Teller mannerisms. But Teller was not actually the caricature that he was made out to be. He may have been an evil man, but he was a very complex evil man. I think in his calculation of keeping politics out of some aspects of what he did, namely awarding graduate fellowships, but not out of other aspects, namely the kinds of science that he pushed at Livermore Lab, the x-ray laser, Star Wars, and so on, wasn't haphazard. He had a strategy, and in terms of his interacting with young people, his strategy was very clearly, \"Let's show the best young people how exciting it can be to work in defense science. Most of them will just go off and work in academic science, but a few will make careers (or parts of their careers) in defense, still a good return on investment.\"\n\nI'm supportive of the Hertz Foundation even now. It has outgrown its right-wing origins and now supports the best people in a much wider range of fields and at a broader set of places. Its emphasis has shifted subtly from national security to tech entrepreneurship, though it still encourages government service. My wife and I have traveled to several of the Hertz alumni meetings.\n\nLawrence Livermore Laboratory, Interactions with Teller\n\nZierler:\n\nThe summer your spent at Livermore, what was it like day-to-day?\n\nPress:\n\nMost of the summer students at Livermore were able to get security clearances. They worked \"behind the fence\" and were exposed very directly to the physics of nuclear weapons. There was a series of classified lectures, including a sort-of honorary lecture by Edward Teller. Most lectures were by people who were the actual bomb designers of the time. I never got my security clearance during the summer I was there. Why? Because I was \"living in sin\" with Margaret, whom I later married. It was the FBI that, at the time, actually did the investigations for security clearances. The FBI had decided that anybody \"living in sin\" was a bad security risk. That was the actual term they used.\n\nEven then, Margaret and I just laughed at this. I mean, this was the end of the 1960s. There had been the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War, the Sexual Revolution. This was just ridiculous. But there was nothing to be done about it. There was a ground-floor corridor of one of the physics buildings at Livermore that had a movable wall. At the beginning of the summer, a few offices were on the classified side of the wall. Everybody on the other side was waiting for their clearances. In the course of the summer, the wall was moved step-by-step, compressing us miserable people who hadn't yet gotten their security clearances into smaller and smaller numbers of offices.\n\nNo door in that wall, of course. The building had an entrance at one end that was inside the barbed wire fences, and an entrance on my side that went out into the open area. You would walk a quarter of a mile to get to the other side of the building, going through a badge check, fence gate, and so on. By the end of the summer, there were just two of us in the one office left on the unclassified side, me and Lou Witten. Lou was a professor of general relativity at Syracuse. He was my father's age and had been a Communist sympathizer in the late 1930s. He was never going to get his clearance. Lou is, of course, now famous as the father of Ed Witten. Some years later, I got to know Ed, who always treated me with a respect I didn't deserve, as if I was of his father's generation, because he knew that his father and I had spent a summer sharing an office.\n\nZierler:\n\nThat's very funny.\n\nPress:\n\nWell, it was also a wonderful coincidence, because Lou taught me a lot of general relativity that summer. I was already going to Caltech. Kip was already someone I thought I might want to work with. And by the time I was done with that summer, and Lou had taught me a lot, I knew that when I arrived at Caltech, I wanted to work with Kip.\n\nZierler:\n\nYeah.\n\nPress:\n\nGood. Okay. Let me tell you an Edward Teller story way out of time sequence. I don't mind wasting your time with stories that are not revealing of me very much, but are revealing of some of these other famous figures that…\n\nZierler:\n\nI’m always in the market for a good Edward Teller story.\n\nPress:\n\nSo, I had worked that summer in Livermore. And I had met with Teller a few times subsequently, met with Lowell Wood many times. And I was a former Hertz Fellow who had gone on to be something of a success. And it's now almost fifteen years later, the mid-1980s, and I'm at Harvard. I'm a full professor, and I'm a new department chair. An establishment figure, all of a sudden.\n\nOne day I got a phone call from Mike May, who had been the Laboratory Director the summer I was there as a student. Mike was no longer Director, but still very influential at the Lab. He was calling because he had a problem. There was a vacancy in the position of Associate Lab Director for Physics. Roger Batzel, the Lab Director, was also soon to retire. Traditionally, Associate Lab Director for Physics was the stepping-stone to become Lab Director. Edward was pushing for Lowell Wood to fill the position—eventually to become Director.\n\nEveryone else at the Lab, although they respected Edward as their Founding Father (he was by now a pretty old man), knew that it would be disaster for the Lab if Lowell got the job. All of the Livermore Lab establishment was arrayed against Edward and Lowell, but they had to proceed covertly, because Edward was still around, and he was still very politically influential.\n\nBut Mike May had a plan. He would nominate me for the position, even though I had no interest in the job whatsoever. On the basis of my having been a Hertz Fellow, and having been Edward’s summer student, I would inevitably be one of those invited to be interviewed. I would come and give a great interview. Particularly great, because I didn't want the job, so I could be even more freewheeling than usual- I could promise anything.\n\nIn effect, I would be the anti-Lowell Wood, like particle and antiparticle. Lowell was the career Livermore person. I had gone off into academia. Lowell was politically close to Teller. I was a Harvard academic—the exact opposite. In practically every respect, Lowell and I could meet and annihilate as particle and antiparticle. The result would be that the job would go to a neutron, a dark horse candidate, a very measured, very politically adept guy, John Nuckolls, who had also been a mentor of mine, a wonderful man.\n\nNuckolls did in fact get the job and later went on to become Laboratory Director, so Mike May’s plan worked perfectly. But there was drama along the way. I flew out to Livermore and started doing individual interviews, which went very well because almost everybody high-up in the Lab was in on the plan. On the search committee, there must've been one or two people who were Teller acolytes, and then everybody else was establishment Livermore. They knew that I didn't really want the job, and they knew that in the end, they were supposed to pick John Nuckolls.\n\nBut I was playing my assigned part and was scheduled to meet with a lot of people, including Lowell Wood, because, after all, he had been my mentor. Lowell kept me waiting in his outer office half an hour, opened the door, looked at me, and said, \"Et tu, Brute?\" Slammed the door. That was all I saw of Lowell.\n\nLowell must've then gotten on the phone, however, because within fifteen minutes, an admin person came rushing in. \"Doctor Teller wants you to have dinner with him tonight, at his home near the Hoover Institute, across the Bay.\" I said, \"Sure. Why not?\" They cut short my schedule. A car arrived to take me across the Bay to Edward Teller's house. It was just Edward and his wife, Mici, who I had never met before. There was a Mexican cook, who served the meal and then left the house so that just the three of us could be alone. During the dinner, Edward began by saying, \"We cannot talk physics or policy at dinner because the lady is not a physicist. And she is Hungarian.\" This was a little Teller joke. Mici was no more nor less Hungarian than he was.\n\nAt dinner, Edward showed off that he had actually boned up on my research. Despite his joke about Mici, he asked very sensible questions about my astrophysics research at the time. He was very complimentary of me. That was first part of the dinnertime conversation.\n\nBut soon, the talk turned political. He started asking what I thought about nuclear arms control and such things. It became clear that he was trying to draw me out to give extreme liberal views that he felt he could later use to discredit me. Extreme meaning typical of a Harvard professor, not any more extreme than that. I thought, \"Oh, wow. This is great. Two can play this game.\" I was effusive about how important it was to have arms control treaties with the Soviet Union, and trust-but-verify, and all these things that in normal times, would've gotten Edward angry. But no, he was just filing it all away. Maybe he even had a tape recorder running. Who knows? And I thought, \"Well, this is great.\" I was developing the fantasy that I could be the one who could turn Edward Teller into a liberal. I would just find the right compelling and logical arguments, and he would say, \"You're absolutely right, Bill. I never thought of it that way before.\" I won't try to do this in a Teller accent, \"I've been completely wrong for the last forty years, and I'm going to announce tomorrow that I support the nuclear freeze movement, and I'm going to campaign for Teddy Kennedy.\" So that was the fantasy. Didn't happen.\n\nThen after dinner, Mici excused herself, and we went to the living room, and he served me brandy, a real gentleman. He said, \"Bill, I understand that you're interested in coming to the Laboratory.\" This was the only small lie I had to tell: I had to say, \"Well, yes, I'm interested in learning about the opportunity.\" Teller said, \"We need you at the Laboratory. I fully support your coming to the Laboratory. I'm going to work to get you a position at the Laboratory much better than the merely administrative position of Associate Director for Physics, which someone less qualified than you, like Lowell Wood, will be able to do. I want you to come to the Laboratory to be able to do anything you want, at a high salary, for as long as you want, with many post-docs as you want, fully supported and guaranteed by me. Of course, you must promise in writing that you will have no interest in anything administrative.\"\n\nZierler:\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nPress:\n\nI said, \"Thank you, Dr. Teller. That is such a generous offer. I'll have to think about it.\"\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd it was, \"Dr. Teller\"? That's how that went, always, \"Dr. Teller\"?\n\nPress:\n\nYou called him Dr. Teller to his face, but you referred to him as Edward. That was the way that you signaled that you were in his inner circle. I don't think he would've chewed your head off if you called him Edward, but no one did. Talking physics, he was a lot of fun. And as I say, John Nuckolls got the job.\n\nZierler:\n\nWell, people are complex.\n\nPress:\n\nGoing back now to when I was just entering Caltech, I should tell the story, though, of Teller's letter to my draft board. At some point, graduate deferments were ended, and I was, once again, in danger of being drafted. But draft boards, which were all community-based, could still award deferments in very special cases for people whose work was essential to the national defense. If you were an aircraft engineer at Lockheed working on military fighter jets, then your draft board could choose to defer you. Each case was decided at the local level.\n\nEdward wrote a letter to my draft board saying that I had been working at Livermore on the national defense, and I was now continuing my work at Caltech. The letter went on, and it was way over the top. Clearly, it must've been written by Lowell and signed by Edward. My draft board was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, because that's where my parents had moved right before I had to register for the draft. The response to Teller’s letter was that I received an induction notice and was ordered to report to downtown Los Angeles the next week for induction into the U.S. Army.\n\nI called up my draft board. There was a nice lady there who worked at the front desk. I said, \"Oh, hello, I'm one of your people. I'm a graduate student at Caltech. You were supposed to get a letter from Edward Teller, and he was supposed to explain to the board…\" She said, \"Wait, let me get your file.\" She came back, she said, \"I have your file, and I see this letter from Edward Teller. The board read and considered that letter. They thought it was a very impressive letter. But they didn't know who this Edward Teller was.\"\n\nZierler:\n\nReally? How?\n\nPress:\n\nDraft boards were ordinary citizens chosen to serve locally. This shows that there were limits to even Edward's influence. I did manage to avoid being drafted. First by failing the physical exam on something temporary. Then, when they had instituted the lottery, I drew, by pure luck, a high lottery number.\n\nCaltech, First Work for Tombrello\n\nZierler:\n\nWas Caltech a homecoming to some degree? Or did it feel like a new institution that you didn't have any particular connection to?\n\nPress:\n\nComing to Pasadena was certainly a homecoming. I had no particular prior experience with Caltech. While my father was there, his office wasn't even on campus. All the time I was growing up, the seismological laboratory was in the Linda Vista hills. At that time, seismometers had to be on bedrock, and the data couldn’t be remoted to another location, because everything was analog. Margaret and I were married the week before graduate school began. Margaret knew Caltech very well, had been the teenage kid there as part of her parents' social circle in Kellogg Lab, the nuclear physics lab within the physics department. At the time, high-energy physics was in Kellogg as well.\n\nVery soon after I arrived to Caltech, I went in to see Kip and said, \"Oh, hello. Can I work for you?\" And he said, \"Are you in danger of being drafted? Because I only accept first-year students officially if it's something that they need to tell their draft boards.\" I told him that I just failed my physical and had one year before the issue would come up again. He said, \"Well, then I'm not going to take you on. But you can start attending the seminars in my group, and you can see if there's a research problem you might be interested in.\" We got to talking. I was primed by my summer compressed into the office with Lou Witten to know what was going on in general relativity research, at least at a superficial level.\n\nA lot of what was going on was Joseph Weber's apparent discovery of gravitational waves. These are the gravitational waves that LIGO actually did first discover forty-seven years later. Weber’s experiment was faulty, something on the continuum between \"just plain wrong\" and \"sad, self-delusional fraud\". That was not obvious at the time, however. All the general relativists hoped that the discovery was real. Anyway, I was all up on Joseph Weber's experiment, and this must have impressed Kip.\n\nTommy Tombrello, who was a nuclear physics professor in Kellogg Lab, was thinking of doing a gravitational wave experiment. He never actually did. I think he was preempted by Richard Garwin's experiment, which definitively disproved what Weber claimed to have been seeing. But that was later. Kip said, \"Why don't you go talk to Tommy Tombrello about gravitational waves?\" So, I did that. Tombrello said to me, \"Look, I'm a nuclear physicist. I haven't done anything like this before. I talk to Kip all the time, but it will be your job to explain to me how to build an apparatus. How does this all work, this gravitational wave stuff?\" I was flattered to be treated so seriously.\n\nI worked out a whole semi-Newtonian way of thinking about gravitational waves. Much of this seems trivial now, but at the time, gravitational waves were still considered very exotic and not even necessarily real. There had been a long historical debate about the reality of gravitational waves. Were they simply a choice of gauge, and they could be made to go away? Or did they have a physical reality? This had been settled by the time I arrived in graduate school, but not too many years before. Today it's obvious, since gravitational waves show up in the Riemann tensor, which always manifests as a physical, tidal gravitational force. But it still wasn't fully settled that there was a completely local, Newtonian way of thinking about the interaction of a gravitation wave with an apparatus. There were people who said, \"Well, you can think of it that way in some approximation, but there will be effects of the same order that you’ll miss.\"\n\nSo, I went off and, learning some general relativity, thought of a way of expressing it in a way that made clear that a Newtonian stretching force was not only there, but it was all that was there. The local Newtonian picture described the wave’s interaction on masses, its interactions with photons and mirrors, and all that stuff. I was pretty proud of myself that I had developed all this.\n\nBut when I went back to Kip to tell him about this, he didn't like it at all! I can say this safely, now that Kip has won a Nobel Prize and been recognized as the great physicist that he always was, but Kip was not an Ed Purcell kind of physicist. He was not an Edward Teller kind of physicist. Kip starts with the equations. You start with the equations, and then you work out the physics, and then maybe you say, \"Oh, I could've thought of that.\" But it's irrelevant that you could've thought of that. It came from the equations.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd that wasn’t your approach?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, I was doing for gravitational waves what Purcell does for electromagnetism in his freshman textbook. It starts with physics, not mathematics. He draws lines of force. I was the first person to think about lines of force for gravitational waves. Is that an important discovery? No, not at all. It's just a perspective that lets you visualize things more concretely. I was taking relativistic equations, carefully calculating Newtonian limits (so that I wouldn’t miss any effects) and showing that you could cast the equations in a way that looked pretty much like electromagnetism, except it's quadrupole instead of dipole, implying some obvious changes.\n\nAny modern researcher in the field of gravitational waves or general relativity will say, \"Well, of course. We've always known that viewpoint. That perspective has been around since, oh, I don't know, the mid-seventies.\" Exactly so. These viewpoints get established because someone actually describes them and evangelizes for them; in this case, me. And, pretty soon, more effectively, Kip.\n\nZierler:\n\nIt’s a different approach?\n\nPress:\n\nThere's a kind of doing science where your single-minded goal is to discover things. You want to have things with your name on that you've discovered. Okay. I've been lucky enough to do a little bit of that, but not much. It’s not even what I'm proudest of. What I'm proudest of are instances where I've succeeded in developing, feeding into a field, new, different viewpoints, or perspectives, or ways of thinking about things. And the first example of that, in my career, really was gravitational waves.\n\nTowards the middle of the year, Kip scheduled me to give a talk to his group on gravitational waves. It was an honor- me, a first-year graduate student. John Wheeler, who had been Kip's graduate thesis advisor at Princeton, was visiting at the time. Wheeler was also Feynman's graduate thesis advisor. So, I gave my talk, and it was terrible. It went over like a lead balloon. Wheeler fell asleep, and woke up towards the end, and gave me (maybe I'm over-dramatizing) a look of sheer horror at the fact that I was still talking. Normally at the end of Kip's seminars, people applaud politely. This time, no one said a word. People filed silently out of the room. Richard Price, Kip's senior graduate student at the time, came to my office that afternoon and said, \"Bill, it's not as bad as you think.\" I said, \"How bad is it, Richard?\" \"It's not as bad as you think. If Dick Feynman had been there, he might've led you to the right path.\"\n\nThis forced me to some serious introspection, because I was pretty sure that what I had done was good work. It was my first realization that the different styles of physics are different not just cosmetically. They're profoundly different. And a field advances, in part, because people in different places have different ways of thinking about things. Kip’s was a group of mathematical general relativists. I had completely failed to speak their language. My talk would've worked for Ed Purcell, bless his heart; would've worked for Edward Teller; and surely would've worked for Dick Feynman, because Feynman was so smart that he could understand, speak, and translate among all the styles. Feynman might have thought the work was trivial, but he wouldn't have been mystified by it.\n\nThe last opera written by Richard Strauss is Capriccio. It’s a wonderful, long, musical debate about, who is more important, the poet or the composer? Which has the greater primacy, poetry or music? Since it’s Strauss, you know how it has to come out. In physics, the similar debate is, which is more important, physical intuition, or equations? After my talk, I felt like I had been cast as the poet in that opera, on the losing side.\n\nCaltech, Social Milieu\n\nZierler:\n\nI want to touch a little bit more on this idea that both you and your wife had come from Caltech families, and you sort of had arrived back home, at least intellectually. And so, I want to get a sort of broad-based view on how your intellectual pedigree as a couple influenced, at least from the beginning, how you thought you might pursue your graduate education at Caltech.\n\nPress:\n\nWell, it was a funny situation. In my first year in graduate school, also Margaret's at UCLA, we kind of lived dual lives in the Caltech community. Socially, we were \"that cute young couple\" at Kellogg Lab parties. And Kellogg Lab was a real partying place. We partied with Willie Fowler, Dick Feynman always came to the parties, and Margaret's father, Tommy Lauritsen often hosted them. Tommy was a heavy drinker at these parties, not always to good effect. So that was sort of our social milieu.\n\nBut then, by day, we were struggling graduate students. I would limp in, hung over, to Willie Fowler's 8:00 am course on nuclear astrophysics, and, of course, it was a different Willie Fowler and a different me. I was the lowly graduate student; Willie was the professor who always insisted on lecturing at 8 o'clock am. So that was just a strange thing to get used to, or for Caltech and that community, the Kellogg Lab community but that included Kip Thorne's group in those early days, getting used to that.\n\nIn terms of classwork and graduate school life, that was just the hardest year of my whole life. Harvard had not prepared me for Caltech. Of course, as we’ve discussed, my version of Harvard was spending time at the radio station and trying to spend as little time on physics as I could. You could do that at Harvard. Caltech was, and I gather still is, the Marine Corps of graduate schools, where the courses were very intense, and all of the preparation was for the candidacy exam that came at the end of the first year. You took your candidacy exams, they were graded, and you were told what your rank was in your class. That rank enormously affected, especially for theorists, which professors were willing to take you on as thesis students.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut you embraced that duality?\n\nPress:\n\nHere's what I would say about that. I could not escape the reality that I was Frank Press's son, and Margaret was Tommy Lauritsen's daughter. We were a kind of junior- very junior- power couple. But there was also in front of me the example of Tommy and his father, Charlie Lauritsen. Charlie was, by almost any judgment, the better physicist, notwithstanding his having gone off in World War II and never quite coming back to pure research. Tommy was always in his father's shadow, professionally and personally. Margaret and I enjoyed the Kellogg social scene, and we didn't mind being the cute young couple. But I didn't want that social life to become defining of who I was professionally, a struggling first-year graduate student. I especially didn't want to end up like Tommy, in his or my father's shadow.\n\nZierler:\n\nYou mean you wanted to be taken seriously on your own terms.\n\nPress:\n\nNot just wanted to. Expected to. I was planning never to play the social connection card. Now, realistically, you can say that I didn't have to play it. It was just there. Maybe so, and there was nothing I could do about it. Still, I was determined never to play that card intentionally. So, yes, it was a little uncomfortable sometimes, palling around with the older Kellogg Lab folks at these parties, which-\n\nZierler:\n\nBut you and your wife had to know this coming in. This could not have been a surprise to you.\n\nPress:\n\nYes. Not even a Faustian bargain. We didn't have to sell our souls. It was a choice to go back to Pasadena. I have a good friend, just my age, a very distinguished physicist. He really fought hard to get where he is. He comes from a working-class background, from a family that discouraged his going to college, and so on. And it's just amazing the stories he has about his struggles to become, as he has, quite a well-known physicist. He and I were joking around about how maybe each of us should write his own memoirs. I must have been telling him some Dick Feynman story at the time. I said, \"No, no. You should write your memoirs. Because yours is an amazing story, what you went through to make it in life. The trouble with my writing a memoir is…\" I didn't even have to say it. He finished the sentence for me. \"Your story, Bill, is about how you had every possible advantage in life and nevertheless managed to succeed.\"\n\nZierler:\n\n(Laughter) Well, on that note, let's end it here.\n\n[End 200728_0228_D]\n\n[Begin 200818_0269_D]\n\nZierler:\n\nThis is David Zierler, Oral Historian for the American Institute of Physics. It is August 18, 2020. I'm so happy to be back with Professor William H. Press. Bill, thank you so much for joining me again.\n\nPress:\n\nMy pleasure, of course.\n\nJoining Kip's Group, Gravitational Waves\n\nZierler:\n\nLet’s talk more about what led to your interest in trying to join Kip's group. What was going on there at the time that attracted you?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, I think I was no different from most graduate students with only the vaguest idea of what was really going on, what was exciting in physics. But at the time, Kip was the rising young star in the department. I knew that I wanted to be a theorist. We already discussed how, as an undergraduate, I pretended to be an experimenter; but I just wasn't good at it. So, I went to Caltech like everybody else, thinking that if I wanted to do particle theory, I wanted to work with Feynman. And if I wanted to do something different, well, gravitational collapse and gravitational waves were very much in the air. Weber had just done his experiment, which seemingly detected gravitational waves.\n\nZierler:\n\nBut in terms of working with somebody like Kip or Dick, how much overlap is there really in terms of what the student him or herself is interested in? In other words, you have the kinds of physics that you want to pursue. How do you decide who to work for?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, I wouldn’t say that you have a lot of agency in this regard. You arrive as a lowly graduate student. If you're lucky enough to do well on the candidacy exam, then you make the rounds. Now, I had more independence than most because I was a Hertz Fellow, so I was financially independent. I didn't have to find a thesis advisor with the funds to support me. Kip, when I first went to him, said that, after a year, he would see how I did on my candidacy exams, and see how many open slots he had in his group.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat did you do with Kip's response? How did you respond to that?\n\nPress:\n\nWell, that was fine with me. Of course, I didn't know whether I would do well on my candidacy exams. Like all first-year graduate students, I had forebodings. As I said, Harvard had not prepared me. So, it was a rough year. I think all graduate students have to have fantasies about what are they going to do when they flunk out. Margaret and I were going to open a small restaurant and become short order chefs or something like that. It's questionable how much we truly believed that, and how much you just need something to grasp in graduate school to get you through. And, luckily, I did do well on my candidacy exams.\n\nLet me mention something ugly about those times. I came in number two in my class in the candidacy exam. The person who came in number one was a student from China. But the lore in the department was that a Chinese student always came in number one, and that he should be discounted. So, the perceived top of each class was the non-Chinese student who came in as number two.\n\nZierler:\n\nBill, let's talk about the sort of origin story of LIGO. When Kip talks about LIGO, he prominently mentions the review article that you did with him on gravitational wave astronomy. Where do you situate yourself specifically in that broader origin of LIGO and gravitational wave physics?\n\nPress:\n\nWe already talked about my work for Tombrello, and how badly it went when I tried to give a seminar on that. Kip, at first, didn’t like my perspective at all. But he did come around. By the time I was Kip's student, I would say ninety percent I was learning from Kip, as one should as a graduate student with a thesis advisor. And maybe ten percent, Kip was learning from me, because I was giving him this sort of more physical viewpoint.\n\nSo to the extent that I contributed to that field, I was an early influencer in understanding that gravitational waves were like electromagnetic waves: When you think of them as metric perturbations, they may seem esoteric, but locally within the wave zone, there's the equivalent of an electric field, there's a magnetic field. On time scales short compared with the frequency of the wave, they're quasi-static. The electric field makes charges move; the changing magnetic field makes currents flow. Exactly that viewpoint goes over to gravitational waves. You can understand essentially all modern gravitational wave experiments in this kind of quasi-Newtonian way that we now take for granted.\n\nZierler:\n\nWhat were some of the bigger questions that Kip had in mind about gravitational waves?\n\nPress:\n\nFrom the very beginning, Kip had a vision not just of gravitational wave physics, but of gravitational wave astronomy. That was the title of our review article, and it was Kip's title, \"Gravitational Wave Astronomy.\" It was a controversial phrase to put on the title of a review article. Gravitational waves had not even been detected yet except possibly in the Weber experiment, which had fallen into grave doubt.\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd why? What was the doubt behind that experiment that didn't make this a done deal?\n\nPress:\n\nWeber’s supposed gravitational waves were hugely, many orders of magnitude, stronger than any astrophysical source that anybody could dream of. When I started working more mathematically on gravitational waves with Kip, people were still trying to find a way that maybe Weber could be seeing a real effect. So, for example, Charlie Misner at Maryland and his group had an idea, really just a phrase, \"gravitational synchrotron radiation.\" Could there be astrophysical sources close to black holes that could beam gravitational radiation?\n\nRichard Price was working on that, and Kip assigned me to a kind of an apprenticeship with Richard, I think to train me into being a more mathematically oriented physicist. My physical intuition was all well and good, and it did find its way into the review article and into Kip's textbook with Misner and Wheeler. But, fundamentally, if I was going to be in Kip's group, I had to learn to be more of a mathematical physicist. Richard Price was supposed to teach me. Well, that didn't lead anywhere in terms of the Weber experiment. The Weber experiment disappeared when Garwin and others definitively failed to confirm it.\n\nOne of the problems that Kip assigned to Richard Price and me to work out, it could be done in perturbation theory was a speculation due to Jim Bardeen, that if you shot a small particle into a black hole, you could get gravitational waves whose wavelength were characteristic of the size of that small particle, or the velocity of that small particle, or something that could give hope of generating these relatively high-frequency gravitational waves that Weber was claiming to see.\n\nWhat Richard and I showed was that the gravitational waves that you got out always had the characteristic scale of the black hole itself. That, I think, was the first hint to me that I should use these perturbation equations to understand black holes as dynamical objects. When you banged on a black hole by shooting something into it, what you got out was characteristic of the black hole, not characteristic of what you shot into it. When you shoot a BB gun at a bell, you get out the sound of the bell, not of the BB.\n\nEvery scientist has something in his or her head that they consider their first discovery, their first understanding of something that the rest of the world didn't understand yet. For me, it was my paper, \"Long Wave-Trains of Gravitational Waves from a Vibrating Black Hole.\" I wouldn’t claim sole credit. I was immersed in a research group and in a whole milieu, but I would say this idea, that you should talk about vibrations of a black hole and not simply gravitational waves from things external to the black hole, was a viewpoint that I originated. Kip, and others in his group, and soon others in other places, adopted this, and it became the standard view.\n\nNowadays, when LIGO talks about analyzing events, they talk about dividing the event into an in-spiral stage, which is semi-classically the gravitational waves from two-point objects circling around each other and spiraling in. Then, the system goes over to what they call a ringdown stage, where you're no longer seeing the object spiraling, but you're seeing properties of the black hole itself. Seeing, in fact, normal modes of the black hole. I think I was the first to use the word \"ringdown\" for a black hole. Or \"normal mode.\" But who can know now?\n\nZierler:\n\nAnd in terms of your workflow with Kip, did he essentially give you a problem to work on that he needed worked himself? Or did you have sort of the inclination, or the initiative, or the independence even, to come up with that problem for yourself?\n\nPress:\n\nKind of in-between. Kip was great at understanding when problems were ripe, when the equations existed, the technology existed. And then Kip would assign problems to his graduate students or to teams of his graduate students. Kip always believed that there should be collaboration within his group, that no one should be hiding results from anybody. In terms of communication between his group and other groups, I think we would depend on Kip for telling us when we had results that were far enough along that we should share them with other groups, even well before publication.\n\nNiche in Computational Work\n\nPress:\n\nOne major thing that I brought to these collaborations among graduate students in Kip’s group was that I understood what you could do with a computer. I understood that better than my peers because I had been a computer hacker at Harvard, which really got me into the depths of the machines. And I had worked at Lawrence Berkeley lab and learned to program on what were big computers at the time. And then, at Livermore Lab, I had picked up the culture of, \"Here's a physics problem. How do we compute it? How do we map it to what a computer can do?\" This was a culture that was then was quite new in theoretical physics.\n\nRichard Price was two- or three-years senior to me. He would say, \"Try to derive this result from these equations.\" And I would say, \"Well, why should I derive it? I can just take your equations, and put them on the computer, and see what they do.\" These were ordinary differential equations. Nowadays they would be trivial to calculate, and even then, not too hard. And he would say, \"Really? Really, you can do that?\" So that became my niche, this kind of interface between the analytic calculations and what could be done on computers at the time.\n\nThat was a niche that continued throughout my graduate career and beyond. I always needed a more mathematical collaborator to work with in relativity. I was never a truly facile mathematical relativist. My principal collaborator soon became Saul Teukolsky, who was one year behind me in graduate school, who had come to Caltech from South Africa (which, at the time, was considered very, very exotic). With Saul, it almost was the inverse of with Richard. I would go to him and say, \"I'm about to program this on the compute"
