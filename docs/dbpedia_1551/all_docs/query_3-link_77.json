A duration can be specified, otherwise the wave continues until a call to noTone(). The pin can be connected to a piezo buzzer or other speaker to play tones.\n\nOnly one tone can be generated at a time. If a tone is already playing on a different pin, the call to tone() will have no effect. If the tone is playing on the same pin, the call will set its frequency.\n\nUse of the tone() function will interfere with PWM output on pins 3 and 11 (on boards other than the Mega).\n\nIt is not possible to generate tones lower than 31Hz. For technical details, see Brett Hagmanâ€™s notes.\n\nSyntax\n\ntone(pin, frequency)\n\ntone(pin, frequency, duration)\n\nParameters\n\npin: the Arduino pin on which to generate the tone.\n\nfrequency: the frequency of the tone in hertz. Allowed data types: unsigned int.\n\nduration: the duration of the tone in milliseconds (optional). Allowed data types: unsigned long.\n\nReturns\n\nNothing"
