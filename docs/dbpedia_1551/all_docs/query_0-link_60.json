        "text": "The TTU Office of Research did a nice bio of my strange career progression (thanks go to Sally Post!)\n\nWe did it! We finally saw a binary neutron star merger. First detected via their gravitational waves and then through other astrophysical messenger channels\n\nRai Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne win the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for making it all possible!\n\nI gave a talk on guitar acoustics at a local winery\n\nThe TTU Office of International Affairs have featured me on their website.\n\nCheck out my new visualisation of our search for gravitational waves in supernova remnants (in R Shiny). See detailed explanation below.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nMy current work involves the vibrations of (and travelling through) space-time, known as gravitational waves, as part of the LIGO collaboration.\n\nI'm also interested in advanced signal processing methods, particularly those related to sparse methods.\n\nI like playing with computers and have constructed novel computing systems.\n\nProf. Benjamin Owen and I recently looked for continuous gravitational waves from nine young supernova remnants in LIGO's Sixth Science Run (S6). Here's a graphic representing their relative positions in the Galaxy, and the gravitational wave upper limits we established for each:\n\nG1.9-0.3\n\nDist.: 8.5 kpc, Age: 100 yr\n\nG18.9-1.1\n\nDist.: 2 kpc, Age: 4,400 yr\n\nDA 530 / G93.3+6.9\n\nDist.: 1.7 kpc, Age: 5,000 yr\n\nCas A / G111.7-2.1\n\nDist.: 3.3 kpc, Age: 300 yr\n\nIC 443 / G189.1+3.0\n\nDist.: 1.5 kpc, Age: 3,000 yr\n\nVela Jr. I (wide) / G266.2-1.2\n\nDist.: 200 pc, Age: 690 yr\n\nVela Jr. II (deep) / G266.2-1.2\n\nDist.: 750 pc, Age: 4,300 yr\n\nMSH 11-62 / G291.0-0.1\n\nDist.: 3.5 kpc, Age: 1,200 yr\n\nG347.3-0.5\n\nDist.: 0.9 kpc, Age: 1,600 yr\n\nG350.1-0.3\n\nDist.: 4.5 kpc, Age: 600 yr\n\nGalactic positions of the supernova remnants we searched, all of which are very close to the galactic plane. The yellow dot represents the Solar System. Two possible locations for Vela Jr. were used.

Hurt.)\n\nBiography\n\nEnough people, at first blush, have trouble tracking my career trajectory, so I made a graphical representation to help:\n\nIt's all about waves...\n\nMy Honours' project involved modelling how charge accumulates in a quantum device known as a resonant tunnel diode. This was performed at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, under the supervision of Prof. Mike Reid and Prof. Simon Brown.\n\nThe title of my PhD project was \"The Acoustics of the Steel-String Guitar\" (PDF download---yes, it was as fun as it sounds). This was done at the Music Acoustics Laboratory, the University of New South Wales (UNSW), under the supervision of Prof. Joe Wolfe, Prof. John R. Smith and Gerard Gilet. During this project, I learned how to make guitars. I then applied this to making three steel-string (folk) guitars to be as similar as possible---except for the wood species on the sound-board (top). I measured the vibratory properties of the important components that went into the three instruments, and measured the vibratory and acoustic behaviour of the instruments at various stages of construction. I also did some work on the violin, trying to determine whether there is anything behind the anecdotes that they 'improve' with ageing and/or playing.\n\nI then applied the techniques I'd developed to characterise vibrations in wood to manipulate the behaviour of termites using their vibratory communication systems, with Prof. Joseph Lai and Dr Theo Evans and the CSIRO Termite Group. This was a joint project between UNSW at the Australian Defence Force Academy and CSIRO, so I would often get asked \"what do termites have to do with the Defence Force?\". It turns out that these supposedly dumb insects are surprisingly sophisticated engineers, able to determine material properties of their food using vibrations, as well as using them for complex social communication. This work led to a patent to stop termites eating wood, by using their own vibratory signals! Yes, it sounds weird, but it works.\n\nSelected Publications: ( Click here for full publication list)\n\n(Hover over an article to see an editorial summary of each)\n\nGW151226: Observation of Gravitational Waves from a 22-Solar-Mass Binary Black Hole Coalescence.\n\nAbbott, B.P. et al.
