        "text": "A taste of Chez Panisse history\n\nIt’s tough to rustle up a new story about the most written-about restaurant in Berkeley, but California Magazine has dipped deep into the Chez Panisse archive at the Bancroft Library and come up with a fascinating look at its early days.\n\nCAD for RNA\n\nJoint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) researchers have developed computer assisted design (CAD)-type tools for engineering RNA components to control genetic expression in microbes. This holds enormous potential for microbial-based production of advanced biofuels, biodegradable plastics, therapeutic drugs and a host of other goods now derived from petrochemicals.\n\nNew video shows reconstruction of 'brain movies'\n\nUC Berkeley scientists Jack Gallant and Shinji Nishimoto have wowed the world by using brain scans and computer modeling to reconstruct images of what we see when we’re watching movies. UC Berkeley broadcast manager Roxanne Makasdjian has produced a video of how they achieved this breakthrough, and where they’re headed.\n\nStudy details how dengue infection hits harder second time around\n\nOne of the most vexing challenges in the battle against dengue virus, a potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus, is that getting infected once can put people at greater risk for a more severe infection down the road. A new study with UC Berkeley researchers details how the interaction between a person’s immune response and a subsequent dengue infection could mean the difference between getting a mild fever and going into a fatal circulatory failure.\n\nA Single Cell Endoscope: Berkeley Researchers Use Nanophotonics for Optical Look Inside Living Cells\n\nBerkeley researchers have developed a nanowire endoscope that can provide high-resolution optical images of the interior of a single living cell, or precisely deliver genes, proteins, therapeutic drugs or other cargo without injuring or damaging the cell.\n\nSaving on Energy Bills: Meeting Families in the Middle\n\nBerkeley Lab study identifies steps that can deliver significant savings on home energy bills for middle-income households.\n\nTrimming time in stacks\n\nComputer science graduate student Aditi Muralidharan has developed a sophisticated text-analyzing tool that could speed literary searches for humanities scholars and other researchers.\n\nLuke Lee gets $1.5 million Gates Foundation grant to develop diagnostic chip\n\nLuke Lee, professor of bioengineering and co-director of the Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center, gets nearly $1.5 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a portable microfluidic chip that can be used to diagnose multiple infectious diseases, such as HIV, TB and malaria, at the same time.\n\nWildlife researchers want your old socks\n\nThose old or unpartnered socks clogging up your sock drawer are wanted by a Berkeley-led team of wildlife scientists studying the rare and elusive Pacific fisher in its Sierra habitat. Meat-stuffed socks are catnip to the furry little weasels, and chewing through the socks keeps them around long enough to be photographed.
