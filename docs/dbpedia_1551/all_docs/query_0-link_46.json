EUVE Science News ==================== 1.1 Recent EUVE Science Highlights ---------------------------------- by Dr. Pierre Chayer, EUVE/CEA Scientist Discovery of Warm Gas in the Center of the Virgo Cluster with EUVE Drs. Richard Lieu, Jonathan Mittaz, Stuart Bowyer, Felix Lockman, Chorng-Yuan Hwang, and Jurgen Schmitt performed an observation of the central region of the Virgo Cluster with the EUVE deep survey telescope. A point source and and extended emission halo were clearly detected. It is the first detection of cluster gas emission in the EUV. Dr. Lieu and his collaborators show that the emission cannot be interpreted by the cluster gas at X-ray temperatures and propose a second gas component with temperature between 5E+5 and 1E+6 K. 1.2 IAU Circular Regarding EUVE J2115-58.6 ------------------------------------------ Excerpted from IAU Circular No. 6297, 29 Jan 1996 N. Craig, University of California at Berkeley, reports: \"An optical counterpart for EUVE J2115-58.6 has been identified as a magnetic CV, probably an AM Her-type cataclysmic variable. The field, centered at R.A. = 21h15m41s, Decl. = -58d40'48\" (equinox 2000.0), was observed as part of the EUVE Optical ID Campaign on 1995 Dec. 10.063 UT with the 1.5-m telescope (Loral) at Cerro Tololo. The proposed optical counterpart, at R.A. = 21h15m41s, Decl. = -58d40'54\", well within the source error circle, is a star of estimated mv = 16.0. The optical spectrum clearly shows the characteristics of a cataclysmic-variable spectrum, with the typical Balmer emission lines, as well as lines of He I, Ca II and strong He II emission. The continuum increases sharply toward the blue at short wavelengths. The CV EUVE J2115-58.6 was detected during the all-sky survey in the EUVE Lexan/B band (5.8-17.4 nm, 0.07-0.21 keV) on 1992 Oct. 20, and also during the gap-filling on 1993 Apr. 19. A countrate of 0.05 cts/s is calculated. Monitoring photometric and spectroscopic observations are urged.\" 1.3 Abstracts of Recently *Accepted* EUVE Papers ------------------------------------------------ Included below are abstracts of EUVE-related papers recently *accepted* for publication.

Mauche To appear in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Quasi-coherent oscillations have been detected in the extreme ultraviolet flux of the dwarf nova SS Cygni during observations with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer satellite of the rise and plateau phases of an anomalous outburst in 1993 August and a normal outburst in 1994 June/July. On both occasions, the oscillation turned on during the rise to outburst and persisted throughout the observation. During the 1993 outburst, the period of the oscillation fell from 9.3 s to 7.5 s over an interval of 4.4 days; during the 1994 outburst, the period fell from 8.9 s to 7.19 s (the shortest period ever observed in SS Cyg, or any other dwarf nova) within less than a day, and then rose to 8.0 s over an interval of 8.0 days. For both outbursts, the period P of the oscillation was observed to correlate with the 75-120 A count rate I_(EUV) according to P is proportional to I_(EUV)^(-0.094). A magnetospheric model is considered to reproduce this variation. It is found that an effective high-order multipole field is required, and that the field strength at the surface of the white dwarf is 0.1-1 MG. Such a field strength is at the lower extreme of those measured or inferred for bona fide magnetic cataclysmic variables. -------------------------------------------------------------- AUTONOMOUS OPERATION OF THE SCIENCE PAYLOAD ON THE EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER R.F. Malina Submitted to International Astronautical Federation, Symposium: IAA 11, Small Satellite Missions Symposium, Session: IAA 11.3, On Board Autonomous Systems for Small Satellites, 1995. [CEA publication #677; not preprinted] The EUVE satellite was launched by NASA in 1992. In 1993, NASA began to drastically reduce available funding for operations and threatened early end of operations unless innovative lower cost approaches to operating EUVE could be found. This paper describes the re-engineering of the EUVE science operations center that has been successfully carried out. The EUVE science operations center was designed around the premise of around-the-clock staffing. In late 1994, the EUVE science operation center was successfully moved to one 8-hour shift, 7-day a week operation with no loss of science return and with increased payload safety. In late 1995, the EUVE science operations center will move to zero manned shifts. This has been carried out through the rapid infusion of new autonomous monitoring software on the ground and increased on-board autonomy. Commercially available artificial intelligence software was augmented for the EUVE-specific requirements. In 1995, EUVE was designated by NASA-GSFC as a flight operation innovation testbed. This has allowed rapid prototyping of software in a real operations environment and rapid, safe, migration of new operation procedures and software into operations use. The EUVE innovation program was carried out with innovative engineers at NASA, JPL, Ames Research Center, and GSFC. The biggest impediment to moving from operations concepts based on human availability and intervention to operations predicated on full autonomy with human intervention only for anomaly response has been institutional resistance not availability of low-cost technical solutions. -------------------------------------------------------------- SEARCHING FOR A FUNDAMENTAL HEATING MECHANISM IN LOW-ACTIVITY DWARFS M. Mathioudakis To appear in Astrophysical Letters and Communications, presented June 1995 at the NATO ASI on Solar and Stellar MHD Flows in Crete, Greece. [CEA publication #703; not preprinted] The detection of a well-defined lower limit in the surface flux versus color diagrams, and the fact that all late-type dwarfs examined have chromospheric Mg II emission cores, shows that the formation of chromospheres in late-type dwarfs is universal. This result implies that a basic, fundamental heating mechanism exists in the atmosphere of late-type dwarfs. Recent results in the extreme ultraviolet and in X-rays have shown that low-activity dwarfs have detectable coronal emission. Their corona is characterized by relatively cool temperatures, typically less than a few million degrees. Current theories of acoustic heating reproduce quite well the observational parameters of low-activity dwarfs. However, the basal emission could also arise from a fundamental magnetic rather than acoustic heating mechanism. We review the observational properties of low-activity dwarfs and compare them with current theories of atmospheric heating. -------------------------------------------------------------- EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET EMISSION LINES OF FE XIII IN SOLAR AND STELLAR SPECTRA F.P. Keenan, V.J. Foster, J.J. Drake, S.S. Tayal, and K.G. Widing Astrophysical Journal, 453, 906-910, 1995. [CEA publication #708; not preprinted] Recent R-matrix calculations of electron impact excitation rates for Fe XIII are used to derive the theoretical electron density sensitive emission line ratios R_1 = I(3s^2 3p^2 1D-3s3p^3 1D)/I(3s^2 3p^2 3P_2-3s3p^3 3P_2) = I(318.12 A)/I(320.80 A) and R_2 = I(3s^2 3p^2 1D-3s3p^3 1P)/I(3s^2 2p^2 3P_2-3s3p^3 3S) = I(256.42 A)/I(251.95 A), which are found to be up to 70% different from earlier diagnostics. A comparison of the current line ratios with both solar flare and active region observations, obtained by the Naval Research Laboratory's S082A spectrograph on board Skylab, reveals generally good agreement between densities deduced from Fe XIII and those estimated from diagnostic line ratios in species formed at similar temperatures, such as I(219.12 A)/I(211.32 A) in Fe XIV. This provides experimental support for the accuracy of the line ratio calculations, and hence the atomic data adopted in their derivation. In Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer satellite (EUVE) spectra the Fe XIII emission lines are found to be severely blended. However, an analysis of these lines measured in the spectra of Procyon and alpha Cen demonstrates that they still allow very approximate values of the electron density to be inferred. Moreover, it should be possible to increase the accuracy of the measured line fluxes, and hence of the inferred densities, if longer exposures of the stars concerned can be obtained. -------------------------------------------------------------- MULTIWAVELENGTH DATA SUGGEST A CYCLOTRON FEATURE ON THE HOT THERMAL CONTINUUM OF GEMINGA G.F. Bignami, P.A. Caraveo, R. Mignani, J. Edelstein, and S. Bowyer Astrophysical Journal Letters, 456, L111-L114, 1996. [CEA publication #709] A new set of ground-based optical, HST, UV, and EUVE data on Geminga are presented. The object, identified with a high proper motion isolated neutron star (INS), is seen to emit thermal radiation with a temperature in the range (2.2-2.8)E+5 K. This is compatible with the global thermal emission from the surface of a standard neutron star of Geminga's spin-down age located at the distance of about 160 pc, recently reassured through its annual parallax. However, in the \"optical\" (3400-8000 A) range, combined ground-based and HST data suggest the presence of a spectral feature (either in emission or possibly in absorption) superimposed on the Rayleigh-Jeans continuum. Its simplest interpretation could be related to an ion (H or He) cyclotron frequency for the object's canonical magnetic field of 1.5E+12 G. This is the first observational evidence for an optical spectral feature in an INS. A search for a similar effect should also be feasible for PSR 0656+14, the only other INS possibly showing optical thermal emission from its surface. -------------------------------------------------------------- SELECTED HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER S. Bowyer and R. F. Malina Advances in Space Research, 16, 15, 1995. [CEA publication #715; not preprinted] We present a few scientific highlights from the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) all-sky and deep surveys, from the EUVE Right Angle Program, and from the EUVE Guest Observer Program. The First EUVE Source Catalog includes 410 extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources detected in the initial processing of the EUVE all-sky data. A program of optical identification indicates that counterparts include cool star coronae, flare stars, hot white dwarfs, central stars of planetary nebulae, B star photospheres and winds, an X-ray binary, extragalactic objects (active galactic nuclei, BL Lacertae), solar system objects (Moon, Mars, Io,), supernova remnants, and two novae. -------------------------------------------------------------- THE EUV SPECTRUM OF AT MICROSCOPII B. C. Monsignori Fossi, M. Landini, J. J. Drake, and S. L. Cully Astronomy & Astrophysics, 302, 193, 1995. [CEA publication #717] The extreme ultraviolet emission obtained during a 1992 July 14-17 observation of AU Mic has been studied with lines detected with the short, medium, and long wavelength (SW, MW, LW) spectrometers on the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE). The flares were observed during this period. The time evolution of the differential emission measure is presented. The synthetic spectrum derived from the differential emission measure is compared with the observed data. An estimate of the density and volume of the emitting plasma is obtained using Fe XXI lines. -------------------------------------------------------------- SCIENCE ON-LINE PROJECT: THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE LESSON PLANS USING INTERNET RESOURCES R. Battle and I. Hawkins Report to NASA, 1995. [CEA publication #720] We begin this report with a description of the history, goals, and structure of \"Science On-Line -- Earth and Space Science for the Classroom (SOL),\" an Internet-based lesson plan development project. In the second section, we present the theoretical principles upon which the project was designed. In the third section, we present an overview of the Science On-Line events. In the fourth and fifth sections, we describe the Internet-based lesson plan development process. This includes a discussion of design problems, successes, and development practices. In the sixth section, we present a section on the pilot-testing phase of the lessons. This section describes the pilot testing and gives a brief overview of feedback for each of six lessons generated by the pilot-testing phase. Implications are described in the seventh and final section. We envision that the Science On-Line (SOL) results will provide valuable guidance for the design and implementation of similar future programs. -------------------------------------------------------------- WHITE DWARFS IN CLOSE BINARIES IN THE EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER ALL-SKY SURVEY S. Vennes and J.R. Thorstensen In White Dwarfs, ed. D. Koester and K. Werner (Berlin: Springer-Verlag), Proceedings of the 9th European Workshop on White Dwarfs, 313-317, 1995. [CEA publication #722; not preprinted] We examine the orbital and physical properties of the EUVE sample of white dwarfs found in binary systems with short orbital periods (~1 d). These systems, consisting of a hot white dwarf and a main sequence star, are recent survivors of a common envelope phase responsible for dramatic momentum losses and orbital shrinkage. The white dwarfs in close binaries also constitute a surprisingly large fraction of the total sample of white dwarfs discovered in the EUVE all-sky survey. Most secondary stars are M-dwarfs, with an average mass of > 0.5 M_solar, and comparisons with some simulated samples of close binaries suggest that many more systems with very low mass secondary stars (< 0.3 M_solar) remain to be discovered. -------------------------------------------------------------- SPECTROSCOPY OF THE LYMAN CONTINUUM OF HOT DAS USING THE EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER J. Dupuis and S. Vennes In White Dwarfs, ed. D. Koester and K. Werner (Berlin: Springer-Verlag), Proceedings of the 9th European Workshop on White Dwarfs, 323-327, 1995. [CEA publication #723; not preprinted] We report observations by the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) of the hot DA stars Feige 24, G191-B2B, HZ 43, GD 71, and GD 153 which are among the brightest white dwarfs observed by EUVE. Spectral features such as the He I photoionization edge at 504 A and the autoionization feature at 206 A, as well as the He II photoionization edge at 228 A are fingerprints of the ISM typically detected in the EUVE spectra of hot DA. Effective temperatures both obtained from the fitting of pure hydrogen and metal-blanketed models are derived along with the ISM column densities of H I and He I. -------------------------------------------------------------- ORFEUS AND EUVE OBSERVATIONS OF THE COOL DO HD 149499 B R. Napiwotzki, S. Jordan, D. Koester, V. Weidemann, S. Bowyer, and M. Hurwitz In White Dwarfs, ed. D. Koester and K. Werner (Berlin: Springer-Verlag), Proceedings of the 9th European Workshop on White Dwarfs, 337, 1995. [CEA publication #724; not preprinted] We present an analysis of FUV and EUV observations of the cool DO white dwarf HD 149499 B. It is by far the brightest star (V ~ 11.7) of this class. However, it is a secondary in a binary system, separated from a K0V primary 3 mag brighter in V by only 1.5 arc-sec. This makes optical observations of the white dwarf nearly impossible. However, in the FUV/EUV region the flux of the hot white dwarf is virtually undisturbed by the cool companion. -------------------------------------------------------------- SCIENCE-ON LINE: PARTNERSHIP APPROACH FOR THE CREATION OF INTERNET-BASED CLASSROOM RESOURCES I. Hawkins and R. Battle To be presented at the 80th Annual Meeting of the American Education Research Association, New York, April 1996. [CEA publication #725] This project investigates methods by which collaborations among teachers, other professional educators, and scientists can help the access of scientific data by teachers and students, taking advantage of a more technologically-driven, research-based model of learning. This investigation is developing case studies for effective ways of supporting teachers in the contextually relevant use of Internet technology in the class room environment. -------------------------------------------------------------- THE CREATION OF INTERNET-BASED PRACTICES FOR TEACHER-DEVELOPED ON-LINE CLASSROOM RESOURCES R. Battle and I. Hawkins To be presented at the 80th Annual Meeting of the American Education Research Association, New York, April 1996. [CEA publication #726] This study investigates effective practices for educationally-relevant uses of distributed Internet resources made available by the advent of platform-dependent World Wide Web resources. This investigation developed case studies of emerging practices in the context of the creation and pilot testing of classroom Inter net-based instruction lessons. These case studies will serve as exemplars of tested Internet-based lesson development practices for the educational community. -------------------------------------------------------------- 2. EUVE Science Operations News =============================== 2.1 Change in Data Recording Strategy -- Orbital Night Only ----------------------------------------------------------- by Ronald J. Oliversen, EUVE Associate Project Scientist at GSFC On 14 Mar the EUVE Project changed the on-board tape recording management scheme to record orbital night data only. This change has been precipitated by reduced funding for spacecraft operations, the eight hour on-board tape record capacity, and the eventual single-shift coverage of the explorer platform flight operations team. For most programs, this change should have minimal impact on EUVE science. The EUVE Project has never had a requirement to deliver orbital day science data (due to the poorer quality of these data) and has only delivered orbital night data as the standard GO data product. For those few programs that have made special requests for orbital day data in the past, we will not change our data recording strategy to accommodate those requests. We regret any problems that this may cause. 2.2 CEA Proposal to \"Outsource\" EUVE Mission -------------------------------------------- by Dr. Roger Malina, EUVE Mission Operations Principal Investigator It is now NASA policy to carry out outsourcing of routine spacecraft operations to industry or academia. After discussion with NASA officials and the EUVE Users Committee, the University of California at Berkeley has submitted a proposal to NASA for outsourcing of EUVE that is responsive to this new NASA strategy. The proposal addresses concerns raised by the EUVE Users Committee to ensure that an outsourced EUVE project is fully responsive to the needs of the user community, and for completion of the EUVE archive after the end of mission. Additional information on this unsolicited proposal can be obtained by contacting Roger Malina (rmalina@cea.berkeley.edu). NASA currently plans to terminate EUVE operations in the Fall of 1997. NASA will be conducting a Senior Review this summer that will consider extending EUVE operations beyond this date; as we understand it, unless EUVE is successfully outsourced, extension beyond the Fall of 1997 is unlikely. The EUVE Users Committee will be developing the proposal to NASA to make the scientific case for extending EUVE operations beyond fall 1997. New EUVE scientific results over the coming months will be important factors in convincing NASA to extend the EUVE mission. The EUVE user community is urged to make the EUVE Users Committee or the EUVE GO Center aware of new results accepted for publication so that these can be highlighted in the EUVE extended mission proposal. 2.3 Upcoming Observation of Comet 1996 B2 (Hyakutake) ----------------------------------------------------- by Dave Meriwether, ISO Observation Support Team Leader The long-period comet C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake; P = 18,000 years) will make its closest approach to Earth this month, coming to within ~10 million miles -- a mere stone's throw in astronomical terms. EUVE will observe C/1996 B2 for four days in late Mar. At that time the motion of C/1996 B2 relative to EUVE will be such the comet will be moving across the satellite's field of view at a speed comparable to that of the Moon. To compensate for this rapid motion, EUVE will need constant pointing adjustments to properly track C/1996 B2, which makes this observation the most difficult one yet made with EUVE. However, it is expected that the science return will be worth the effort, and will reveal an unprecedented amount of information on the nature and behavior of comets. 2.4 Public Data Release for 1 Apr 1996 -------------------------------------- by Dr. Nahide Craig, ISO User Support Scientist The table below lists the GO observations that become public on 1 Apr 1996. For each entry is given the target name, the approximate exposure time in ksec, the GMT start and end date(s) for the observation, the spectral type of the target, and the data identification code. All public data sets can be ordered from the archive via WWW and electronic or postal mail (see addresses below). Please be sure to include in your order the DataID(s) of interest. Processed data sets are shipped on 8mm tape (or, if requested, on CD-ROM) via postal mail. The data rights policy for GO observations states that GOs have proprietary rights to the data for one year from the date (s)he receives it. It is often the case that long observations are broken up over many months; e.g., an observation approved for 60 ksec may actually be observed for 10 ksec one month, 20 ksec the next and 30 ksec three months later. In such cases the one-year proprietary period begins after the GO is sent the final piece of the completed observation. =============================================================== Target ~Exp Observation Date(s) SpT DataID Name (ksec) Start End =============================================================== Data Sets Available 1 Apr 1996: CN Leo 100 24 Jan - 27 Jan 1995 M go284 CN Leo 35 27 Jan - 29 Jan 1995 M go285 EK UMa 46 14 Dec - 15 Jan 1994 CV go286 EUVE J0425-572 7 19 Jan - 19 Jan 1995 NOID go287 Feige 24 29 22 Oct - 23 Jan 1994 WD go288 Vela 139 4 Feb - 9 Jan 1994 SN go168 Vela 43 18 Mar - 20 Jan 1994 SN go289 Vela 73 25 Nov - 27 Jan 1994 SN go290 =============================================================== 2.5 On-Line Access to EUVE -------------------------- Listed below are the various methods for on-line access to EUVE: o CEA World Wide Web (WWW) URL http://www.cea.berkeley.edu/ telnet www.cea.berkeley.edu 200 (for those without a WWW browser) o anonymous FTP ftp ftp.cea.berkeley.edu Name: anonymous Password: type_your_full_e-mail_address o anonymous gopher gopher ftp.cea.berkeley.edu o EUVE Electronic Newsletters Past issues -- available via the CEA WWW site Subscriptions -- mail majordomo@cea.berkeley.edu (\"subscribe euvenews\") Post message to all subscribers: mail euvenews@cea.berkeley.edu o GI Program Are you interested in finding out about or using EUVE data?
