        "text": "Let's get the ball rolling with PoorSound earlier inquiry.\n\nPoorSound said:\n\ni was talking about swapping the Vifa out of the original design i posted, with the Peerless HDS. Would that be a problem?\n\nGo ahead and build the boxes. If you look at the website now, note it announces the updated Elsinore \"Mk2\" and the recommended drivers are different. The Vifa XT25 tweeter was judged less than ideal being a 4 Ohm in an 8 Ohm speaker system. That 4 Ohm is totally exposed because of the high sensitivity (if it was lower then a series padded resistor would have kept the Z higher). So the search went out for a compatible 8 Ohm tweeter and also one that was hopefully more than 91dB/2.83V.\n\nYou can still use the 6.5\" HDS PPB but my preference in Mk2 uses the Nomex 830875 and, yep, you guessed it, Peerless HDS Tweeter. Not the older HDS but the newer 810921.\n\nThe crossovers only has resistor value changes to 6.5\" drivers, but has a different hi-pass to the tweeter; same component layout but quite different values. It also includes a conjugate filter that not only flattens the large Z peak around 1KHz down to about 12 Ohm as well as greatly reducing the negative phase angle (electrical) caused by the tweeter's main coupling cap just below the crossover.\n\nThe Nomex version is also about 1dB more sensitive, is now a genuine 8 Ohm design and is largely within 6-12 Ohm above 100Hz. The system was modeled with amplifier output impedances as high as 3 Ohm, so SETs and zero-feedback tube PPs will have no problems and the amplitude (frequency) response is hardly modulated by the output Z.\n\nThis afternoon we heard the Reference 3a Veena speaker at Audiophile Society of NSW. The Veena is rated 89dB but the Elsinore was judged about 3dB more sensitive. This latest version is VERY easy to drive for a multi-way type speaker.\n\nThe new Peerless HDS tweeter is, IMO, a real honey. I hope the DIY fraternity takes it to heart. It is quite an improvement on the Vifa XT25. If any of you guys are considering using it, go for it! I have issues with the more expensive Scan-Speak/Revelator tweeters and I am not the only one. There are some published distortion figure I am sure others have seen, like Zaph's. The new HDS tweeter not only measures low distortion, it sounds that way.\n\nI intend to do some distortion measurements of my own and compare it to other tweeters I have here including XT25.\n\nRe movies: Build four of these and... whew! The SPL capability would be awesome. No need for subs, trust me, they have quite a wallop in the bottom. Modest power of 35W/ch in my room and a single pair are capable of concert level with ease, now four? Whoa!\n\nJoe R.\n\nPoorSound said:\n\nWow!\n\nI'm a little torn here! I have all the components (i decided not to mess with your design and go with the XT25.) I don't have the boxes built so i could possibly go with the Peerless tweeter...what do i need to do? what do i need to replace in the crossover? I was a little dissapointed i didn't get the use the Peerless HDS tweeter so i hope i can make this work! Will the Peerless still be horn loaded?\n\nAlso, Joe, while i get to talk to you here...\n\nI got all my components from Solen. I copied your crossover completely , but they sent me one wrong component. i think it was an inductor. Your crossover has a L161.0, but solen sent me the L161.1. will this make an audible difference?\n\nThanks alot\n\n1.1mH will not make a big difference, the parallel resistor, if changed, would make a bigger difference than the inductor.\n\nPlease note that the Elsinore Project is just that, a project. I can apologise for the changes being made, but hopefully you can see how things can go awry as things are in a state of flux. But with the Mk2 things should settle down.\n\nThe website needs to be updated and will be asap. The Mk1 still works absolutely OK, but Mk2 uses a better tweeter, is also more suitable for tubes whereas Mk1 is better off with Solid State or tube amps with lower output Z.\n\nJoe R."
