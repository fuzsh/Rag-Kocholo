        "text": "UST is offering at least one full tuition scholarship for newly admitted HISD high school seniors who identify a problem in their local community, and have a plan to solve that problem!\n\nWe are looking for creative, motivated, service-oriented students who want to make a change for the good of their community. Students cannot apply until they have been admitted to UST, so please apply now!\n\nLearn More\n\nThe V.J. Guinan Presidential Scholars Program is a four-year opportunity for a select number of Catholic students who are in continuous pursuit of academic excellence and servant leadership. This program awards full tuition scholarships to students who excel academically and uphold the Catholic mission of the University. This opportunity is open to incoming freshmen only.\n\nGuinan Scholars take on the role of UST Presidential Ambassadors and leaders within Campus Ministry. In these capacities, they engage current and prospective students by highlighting the incredible formation that UST offers. Scholars live in community and engage their fellow Celts by residing on campus the first year.\n\nScholars are called to discover their gifts, develop spiritually, advocate for justice, and lead ethically in service to the world. Inspired by the Basilian Fathers’ core values, each year Guinan Scholars will focus on one of UST’s core values: goodness, discipline, knowledge, and community.\n\nFreshman Year – Scholars grow in the core value of discipline by committing to involvement within Campus Ministry and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. This involvement is a foundation to the following years in the program.\n\nSophomore Year – Scholars grow in the core value of community by serving their brothers and sisters in Christ on campus, locally, and globally through various service projects and trips.\n\nJunior Year – Scholars grow in the core value of knowledge by growing in their understanding of and execution of the gifts God has uniquely given each of them.\n\nSenior Year – Scholars grow in the core value of goodness through mentoring and a capstone reflection.\n\nApplication opens each year in February. Candidates for the fully-virtual interviews will be selected in February. Interviews are by invitation only and are scheduled to take place in March.\n\nPlease review the candidate requirements listed below:\n\nIdeal Candidates:\n\nCatholic students serious about attending a Catholic university in order to strengthen their formation and serve the community.\n\nRecommended 3.5 GPA or higher on 4.0 index in a college preparatory curriculum\n\n* Given that many standardized exams were cancelled and safety concerns surrounding COVID-19, we will not be considering SAT/ACT scores for the 2021 Guinan Scholars Program application process.\n\n** The selection committee reserves the right to consider candidate(s) who may fall slightly outside the above parameters.\n\nApplication Materials\n\nCompleted V.J.
