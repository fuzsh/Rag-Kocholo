        "text": "Van der Valk\n\nProject May\n\nA rare opportunity\n\n‘Project May’ offers you a rare and exciting chance to commission the build of a brand-new design on which we’ve already completed a great deal of engineering and preparation. The keel has been laid for this sleek 33-metre superyacht so she could be ready to explore your favourite cruising areas in 2026. An all-aluminium tri-deck beauty with an enclosed wheelhouse and many surprises inside and out, everything above the main deck bulwarks can still be customised to your preferences, from the superstructure livery to the interior layout.\n\nSpecifications\n\nLOA 33.10 m\n\nTop speed 23 knots\n\nBeam 6.75 m\n\nFuel tank 14600l\n\nEngine 1432kW\n\nWater tank 2600l\n\nYear\n\nT.b.d.\n\nHull no\n\nWV0135\n\nLWL\n\n27.50m\n\nDraft\n\n2.00m\n\nDisplacement\n\n133t (est.)\n\nHull material\n\nAluminium (AlMg4.5Mn – H321)\n\nSuperstructure material\n\nAluminium (AlMg4.5Mn – H111)\n\nHull Shape\n\nHard chine, moderate V\n\nClassification\n\nRINA C ✠Hull •Mach, Ych (Short range).\n\nEngine brand & type\n\n2 x MTU 12V2000M97L,1432kW @ 2.450 rpm\n\nCruising speed\n\n18.4 knots\n\nShaft & Propeller\n\nStainless steel water lubr. duplex ø=100mm, VEEM Ultraskew 5-bladed propellers Ø1050mm\n\nGearbox\n\nZF 3050V / Reduction 3,00:1\n\nBow/stern Thruster\n\n80hp hydraulic proportional bow and stern thruster\n\nGenerators\n\n2 x Köhler 55EOZDJ 55 kW\n\n55kW 120/240 Volts 0.8PF 3 Phase 1800 RPM 60 Hertz\n\nHolding tank capacity\n\n1700l\n\nCabins\n\n1 owner, 2 VIP, 2 twin guest\n\nCrew\n\n5 person crew, 3 cabins\n\nNaval architect\n\nDiana Yacht Design\n\nExterior design\n\nGuido de Groot Design\n\nInterior design\n\nGuido de Groot Design.\n\nOwner’s repr.\n\nNot applicable\n\nGeneral Arrangement\n\nProven hull\n\nThe hard-chine, semi-displacement hull for Project May is proven in practice on the award-winning Blue Jeans. With all naval architecture and engineering finalised, you’re assured of a yacht with excellent stability and a high-level performance. A key design feature is the wheelhouse saloon with bar. There’s full flexibility for you to adapt this to your wishes, from a family play area to a cosy cigar lounge. Whatever you choose, expect a seamless connection to the superb open aft deck with its large four-seater whirlpool, seating area surrounding a table and sun loungers.\n\nAs you will realise, Project May is ideal if you would like to step into a mature phase of design without the need to go fully custom. You can choose a different hull livery but we like the way designer Guido de Groot has played with colours and deployed darker areas on the superstructure to create such a sleek and distinctive look.\n\nAnother aspect that is completely open to your input is the full-beam owner’s suite forward on the main deck, which comes with its own small lounge and an extra-large balcony. As the exterior renderings show , windows in the front of the suite at the bow and a large opening in the bulwark will offer you fabulous views through the free foredeck.\n\nInspired interior\n\nFor inspiration on how the interior might look, Guido de Groot has created these exquisite images of the main saloon, designed in a subtle and classy soft contemporary style. It’s a wonderful example of how space can be optimised on a 34-metre vessel, with round sofas and chairs, a circular carpet, and a curvaceous aft door and wall. The delightful choice of colours and tones make for an ambience that is simultaneously cosy and spacious. Guido would welcome the chance to sit down with you and take this design to the next level… Or of course start with a blank canvas for your own ideas.\n\nLots more choices\n\nFurther renderings of the rest of the interior can be made as we discuss how you’d like the four suites on the lower deck to look. One idea you can see on our initial GA is a fitness room that doubles as a twin guest cabin with two Pullman beds, along with two guest doubles and a twin. With a true chef’s galley plus accommodation for five crew and a self-sufficient mess, every wish will be catered for on Project May.\n\nMature design\n\nYou also have the option to install a hydraulically operated swimming platform that can sink below the waterline. This would be a useful asset for placing a tender there on short bay-hopping trips without having to take her in and out of the garage. Combining an explorer look with a superyacht style, Project May has bluewater capacity and is ready to take you on the voyages of a lifetime."
