        "text": "Tianshu Wang Adam Burrows Tianshu Wang\n\nAbstract\n\nWe here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be two to ten times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the 56Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of proto-neutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº50% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and 48Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.\n\n(stars:) supernovae: general ‚Äì (stars:) neutron ‚Äì (stars:) ‚Äì hydrodynamics\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe emerging theory of core-collapse supernova explosions (CCSNe) suggests that there is most often a delay in explosion after the bounce of the Chandrasekhar-like core of most massive-star CCSN progenitors (Janka, 2012; Burrows & Vartanyan, 2021). During this delay, turbulence driven by neutrino heating behind the shock in the so-called gain region (Bethe & Wilson, 1985) builds and becomes more vigorous over time, while the mass accretion rate through the stalled shock slowly ebbs. At some critical point (Burrows & Goshy, 1993), either when the silicon-oxygen shell and its associated density jump is accreted and/or when the mantle between the accretion shock and the inner core otherwise becomes unstable and can‚Äôt maintain quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium (Wang et al., 2022), the shock is launched. The basic agencies of explosion are continuing neutrino heating and the turbulent hydrodynamic stress behind the shock and for most progenitors the turbulence is crucial to the explosion (Burrows et al., 1995; Janka & Mueller, 1996; Wang et al., 2022; Burrows et al., 2024). The accumulated energy in the post-shock ejecta, when corrected for the binding energy of the outer stellar mantle, starts negative and builds over time, reaching its asymptotic positive value sometime between ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.5 and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº10 seconds after bounce. The timing of explosion and its subsequent development depend centrally on the mass density profile of the Chandrasekhar-like core at the time of the collapse instability, frequently associated with a ‚Äúcompactness‚Äù parameter (O‚ÄôConnor & Ott, 2011) which increases roughly, though not monotonically (Sukhbold et al., 2016, 2018), with progenitor mass. The lower compactness progenitors generally seem to explode with lower energies, lower 56Ni yields, lower recoil kicks, and more spherically. When higher compactness models explode, they do so with greater explosion energies, greater 56Ni yields, greater asphericities, and larger kicks (though the latter with significant scatter; Burrows et al. (2023)). While there is not yet quantitative agreement among supernova theorists performing sophisticated 3D simulations (Lentz et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2016; Takiwaki et al., 2016; M√ºller et al., 2017; Ott et al., 2018; Glas et al., 2019; M√ºller et al., 2019; Burrows et al., 2019, 2020; M√ºller & Varma, 2020; Powell & M√ºller, 2020; Stockinger et al., 2020; Kuroda et al., 2020; Bollig et al., 2021; Vartanyan et al., 2022, 2023; Burrows et al., 2024), there is overall qualitative agreement on the specifics articulated here. Burrows et al. (2024) summarize the systematic correlations between observables, compactness, and progenitor mass seen in their comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art 3D simulations.\n\nHowever, the 8.8 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (n8.8) solar-metallicity progenitor of Nomoto (1984) and Nomoto & Hashimoto (1988) and both the 8.1 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (u8.1; 10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT solar metallicity) and 9.6 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (z9.6; zero-metallicity) models (A. Heger, private communication), with the lowest compactnesses published, do explode in 1D (Kitaura et al., 2006; Burrows et al., 2007; Janka et al., 2008; Fischer et al., 2010; H√ºdepohl et al., 2010; Melson et al., 2015). Though this is the realm of the so-called ‚ÄúONe,‚Äù or ‚Äúelectron-capture‚Äù progenitors (Nomoto, 1984; Nomoto & Hashimoto, 1988; Leung et al., 2020; Limongi et al., 2024), the extremely-low metallicity models u8.1 and z9.6 in fact have iron cores at the time of collapse; however, all such models (including n8.8) have NSE (nuclear statistical equilibrium) core compositions at bounce. For such models that explode in 1D the turbulent stress and 3D effects are not crucial factors in the inauguration of explosion. This is because their rarified envelopes lead to a post-bounce mass accretion rate that plummets immediately after bounce, and with it the accretion ram pressure, while the early post-bounce neutrino luminosity (most of it sourced by the diffusive component from the shocked proto-neutron star (PNS) inner mantle) is adequate to power a prompt, neutrino-driven explosion , though with low asymptotic supernova energy, and such explosions transition into a neutrino-driven wind very early on (Wang & Burrows, 2023a).\n\nNomoto (1984) introduced the idea that ONe cores (such as his 8.8 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT model) achieve the effective Chandrasekhar mass and start to collapse not by the photodissociation of iron-peak nuclei, but by electron capture, and that there is burning on infall. However, what type of inner structures the stars in the ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº8‚àí--9 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT progenitor mass range (and for a spread of metallicities) actually possess at the end of their lives has not been definitively determined. This is in part due to the many thermal pulsations such cores experience and their electron degeneracy. The latter can lead to many flashes that are difficult to simulate, and the former significantly retard progress to collapse in extant stellar evolution codes. The result is not only ambiguity, but that there are very few published models in this mass range available to supernova modelers. Limongi et al. (2024) and Leung et al. (2020) discuss these issues (see also Jones et al. (2019)) and Limongi et al. (2024) suggest that solar-metallicity stars in the ZAMS mass range ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº8.2‚àí--9.2 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT will be electron-capture supernovae. However, due to myriads of intervening thermal pulses at the end of their calculations they have yet actually to reach the mass density threshold for electron capture on 20Ne.\n\nNevertheless, despite the remaining uncertainties concerning the core structures of massive stars in the 8‚àí--9 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ZAMS mass range, the existence of theoretical evolutionary models that lead to explosions in 1D (spherical) enables a study of the effects of 3D through a comparison of 1D and 3D simulations. This is the subject of this paper. In addition, the Salpeter mass function indicates that this range of ZAMS mass space occupies a disproportionate fraction of progenitor space, though remaining uncertainties in stellar evolution leave the actual fraction a subject of conjecture. Should all stars between 8 and 9 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT technically explode in 1D, then this would constitute ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº15% of massive star deaths and nearly 15% of core-collapse supernovae.\n\nWe begin in ¬ß2 by describing the distinctive hydrodynamics of 1D, prompt, neutrino-driven explosions and compare with the same models in 3D. We also summarize their explosion energies, the recoil kick speeds, and the gravitational mass range of their residues. In ¬ß3, we discuss sound wave generation and the characteristics of the acoustic component and in ¬ß4 we provide the distinctive nucleosynthesis. The latter includes the 56Ni, 57Ni, and 44Ti, and 48Ca yields, as well as their possible weak r-process production. We conclude with a general discussion of the results and thoughts concerning future theoretical directions.\n\n2 General Hydrodynamics and Results\n\nThe radiation/hydrodynamic code we use for this study is Fornax (Skinner et al., 2019; Vartanyan et al., 2019; Burrows et al., 2020, 2024). For the 1D simulations, we use a radial grid with 1024 zones and for the 3D simulations we use a 1024(rùëüritalic_r)√ó\\times√ó128(Œ∏ùúÉ\\thetaitalic_Œ∏)√ó\\times√ó256(œïitalic-œï\\phiitalic_œï) grid. The outer boundary radius is 20,000 kilometers (km) (for models u8.1 and z9.6), 30,000 km (for solar-metallicity models s9.0a,b and s9.5), and 45,000 km for solar-metallicity model s9.25. Our explorations of models s9.0a,b, s9.25, and s9.5 (Sukhbold et al., 2016), all of which explode only in 3D, have already been published (Wang & Burrows, 2023a, b; Burrows et al., 2024) and are included here for comparison. We use the u8.1 (10‚àí4superscript10410^{-4}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT solar) and z9.6 (zero metallicity) progenitors from A. Heger (private communication) as example models that explode in 1D. Models s9.0a and s9.0b differ only in the imposition of perturbations on infall in the former, with consequences predominantly for the nucleosynthesis (see Wang & Burrows (2023a, b)).\n\nThe number of neutrino energy groups is twelve (for ŒΩesubscriptùúàùëí\\nu_{e}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, ŒΩ¬Øesubscript¬Øùúàùëí\\bar{\\nu}_{e}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_ŒΩ end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and ‚ÄúŒΩŒºsubscriptùúàùúá\\nu_{\\mu}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT‚Äù neutrinos, where the latter bundles ŒΩŒºsubscriptùúàùúá\\nu_{\\mu}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, ŒΩ¬ØŒºsubscript¬Øùúàùúá\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_ŒΩ end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, ŒΩœÑsubscriptùúàùúè{\\nu}_{\\tau}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œÑ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and ŒΩ¬ØœÑsubscript¬Øùúàùúè\\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_ŒΩ end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œÑ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT neutrinos) and the 3D runs for the u8.1 and z9.6 models were performed on the NERSC/Perlmutter GPU cluster. We employed the SFHo equation of state (EOS) for all simulations (Steiner et al., 2013). Figure 1 depicts the initial density profiles of the most compact collapsing structures, compared with a few less compact configurations for models that do not explode in 1D (Burrows et al., 2024). Note in particular the different perspectives provided when plotted versus interior mass and radius, where the latter shows not only the slight differences between the u8.1 and z9.6 models, but the singular character of the n8.8 model. Calculating the compactness at 1.75 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, as we normally do, may not capture the extreme contrasts between core and mantle for those models that explode in 1D, so it may not be as useful a discriminant. Though for those models the compactness is extremely low, using the central density or entropy at collapse may be better (Temaj et al., 2023) and we provide these quantities in summary Table 1. However, for now we will not focus on specific discriminating indices. Rather, we seek to explore the differences between 1D and 3D developments when the 1D models explode and leave to future work the detailed origin of the Chandrasekhar-like structures in the cores of the least massive CCSN progenitor stars.\n\nFigure 2 portrays the mean shock radius versus time after bounce for the 1D (dashed) and 3D (solid) models (left panel) and also provides for comparison the corresponding development of the 3D models s9.0a,b, s9.25, and s9.5. We note that though the 1D u8.1 model explodes, that explosion is delayed significantly. Its explosion is marginal, with an energy of only ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº1049 ergs (see Table 1). This is a direct consequence of its slightly thicker envelope than found for the z9.6 model (Figure 1). A slightly enhanced initial mantle density translates into a slightly greater mass accretion rate (MÀôÀôùëÄ\\dot{M}overÀô start_ARG italic_M end_ARG) and accretion ram pressure after bounce. These delay the explosion until the accretion rate subsides. For many progenitor models, such an eventual decrease in accretion rate is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in driving luminosity, with the result that explosion is not assured (Wang et al., 2022). However, for the models that explode in 1D, the diffusive component of the luminosity provides a floor, so that the rapid decrease in MÀôÀôùëÄ\\dot{M}overÀô start_ARG italic_M end_ARG is not accompanied by a decrease in the driving neutrino luminosities. The result is explosion, though the asymptotic explosion energy (Figure 2, right panel), contingent as it is upon the integrated mantle neutrino heating rate, is generically low.\n\nAs the right-hand-side of Figure 2 demonstrates (and Table 1 summarizes), the final explosion energies for the z9.6 model are ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.125 Bethes (1D) and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.22 Bethes (3D), while for the u8.1 model they are ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.017 Bethes (1D) and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.17 Bethes (3D) . Interestingly, the explosion energies in 3D for the u8.1 and z9.6 models are slightly higher than the explosion energies for the s9.0, s9.25, and s9.5 progenitors, despite their larger compactnesses and neutrino luminosities. It is the greater delay to explosion and the associated wasting of the heat deposited during a longer stall to explosion of the s9.0, s9.25, and s9.5 progenitors (despite their slightly higher luminosities at the same post-bounce times) that results in slightly lower asymptotic explosion energies for them. This provides an ‚Äúasterisk‚Äù to the conclusion that explosion energy tracks compactness (Burrows et al., 2024) and is likely a metallicity effect ‚àí-- published lower metallicity progenitors have higher compactnesses upon collapse (Sukhbold et al., 2016).\n\nFigure 3 portrays the evolution of the neutrino luminosities of species ŒΩesubscriptùúàùëí\\nu_{e}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, ŒΩ¬Øesubscript¬Øùúàùëí\\bar{\\nu}_{e}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_ŒΩ end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and ‚ÄúŒΩŒºsubscriptùúàùúá\\nu_{\\mu}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_Œº end_POSTSUBSCRIPT‚Äù of models z9.6 and u8.1 in both 1D and 3D. We note that for the u8.1 model the ŒΩesubscriptùúàùëí\\nu_{e}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ŒΩ¬Øesubscript¬Øùúàùëí\\bar{\\nu}_{e}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_ŒΩ end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT luminosities in 1D start larger than the corresponding luminosities for the 3D model. This is due to the significant delay to explosion of this 1D model and the resultant larger mass accretion rate (and corresponding accretion luminosity) at this earlier phase compared with that found in 3D, which explodes much earlier. As Figure 1 shows, the envelope of the u8.1 model is slightly thicker than that for the z9.6 model. As seen in Figure 2, this results is a quicker explosion in 1D for the latter than the former.\n\nHowever, at slightly later times, the luminosities of the 3D models overtake those for the 1D models for both the z9.6 and u8.1 progenitors and continue higher thereafter. This is a direct consequence of proto-neutron star (PNS) convection in the residual core and is a purely multi-D effect. Driven by negative lepton gradients in the PNS (Dessart et al., 2006; Nagakura et al., 2019), such convection dredges heat from the core, is found during the first second after bounce in these models between about 15 and 30 km, and continues unabated for the duration of the PNS cooling phase.\n\nThe left lower panel of Figure 3 shows the net neutrino heating rate in the gain regions for the 1D and 3D models of the u8.1 and z9.6 progenitors. Due to PNS convection and a slight physical expansion in the shock radius (and, hence, the gain volume) in 3D due to turbulence behind the initially decelerating shock, the neutrino heating rates in 3D are generally larger. As a result, the explosion energies in 3D are larger than in 1D. This is particularly the case for the u8.1 model due to the significant delay in its 1D explosion. The difference in the wind mass loss rates between the 1D and 3D models (bottom right of Figure 3) at later times is also quite pronounced, amounting to approximately a factor of three in MÀôÀôùëÄ\\dot{M}overÀô start_ARG italic_M end_ARG. This is a major difference in the behavior of 3D models and emphasizes that, though these models explode in 1D, one must perform 3D simulations to capture their true behavior.\n\nFigure 4 shows the evolutions of the recoil kick imparted to the 3D u8.1 and z9.6 models, and compares them to similar curves for the s9.0a,b, s9.25, and s9.5 models. A much more comprehensive discussion of this general topic can be found in Burrows et al. (2023). We see in Figure 4 that the kicks are low, near ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº40 km s-1 for the u8.1 model and at ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº13 km s-1 for the z9.6 model. Not shown on this plot is that these modest kicks are due mostly to anisotropic neutrino emissions. The ejecta are mostly launched spherically and do not contribute to the same degree. That this is likely the case for the lowest mass progenitors was discussed and motivated in Burrows et al. (2023).\n\nWe provide the final neutron star baryon and gravitational masses for the residual neutron stars in Table 1, along with a variety of other summary model characteristics and results. We are using the SFHo EOS and note that the gravitational mass in particular is contingent upon this. Nevertheless, we find gravitational masses for the u8.1 and z9.6 neutron stars near a low value of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº1.25 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Note that the gravitational mass for the residue of the s9.0 model is expected to be slightly lower still, as is the neutron star mass for the residues of accretion-induced collapse (Dessart et al., 2007).\n\nFor models that explode in 1D (and their 3D counterparts), the hydrodynamics transitions quickly into a wind phase (Duncan et al., 1986; Burrows, 1987; Burrows et al., 1995; Qian & Woosley, 1996; Wang & Burrows, 2023a). In fact, for them the power in the wind contributes substantially to the total energy of the blast.

In our calculation of the acoustic power, we calculate the time average using a 20-ms sliding window (50 Hz). This filters out the influence of the expanding shock. Changing this frequency cut to any value between 25 and 80 Hz doesn‚Äôt influence the measured acoustic power (especially at late times), since the acoustic component generally has frequencies above 80 Hz (¬ß3).\n\nFigure 5 is quite illuminating. First (as suggested in the bottom right panel of Figure 3), the mechanical power of the late-time wind is approximately seven and four times higher in 3D than 1D for the z9.6 and u8.1 progenitors, respectively. This is a direct consequence of the PNS-convection-boosted neutrino luminosities and heating rates.

Third, while during the first second after bounce the neutrino luminosity clearly exceeds LPNSsubscriptùêøPNSL_{\\rm PNS}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PNS end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (early on by an order of magnitude), the two approach one another at later times as the accretion phase abates and the PNS settles into its quasi-static Kelvin-Helmholtz phase. The fluctuations in LPNSsubscriptùêøPNSL_{\\rm PNS}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PNS end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are clearly seen in Figure 5 .\n\n3 Sound Generation and Acoustic Power\n\nNevins & Roberts (2023) have speculated that the nucleosynthetic yields of such lowest-compactness progenitors could be affected by this acoustic component. Gossan et al. (2020) have suggested that acoustic power could help drive the supernova explosion. Figure 6 depicts snapshots at two different times of the divergence of the velocity in the inner 1000 km of the explosions of the u8.1 and z9.6 3D models. Roughly concentric waves of velocity perturbations are clearly seen. Movies of these waves show that these perturbations propagate at speeds of cs+vsubscriptùëêùë†ùë£c_{s}+vitalic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_v, where cssubscriptùëêùë†c_{s}italic_c start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_s end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the local speed of sound and vùë£vitalic_v is the wind speed. After inner turbulence settles (within ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.2 seconds of bounce), a Fourier analysis reveals that these sound waves have frequencies between roughly 100 and 250 Hertz (Hz). We comment that no such waves are seen in the 1D simulations.\n\nFigure 7 depicts space-time diagrams of the radial velocity along (Œ∏,œï)=(œÄ/2,0)ùúÉitalic-œïùúã20(\\theta,\\phi)=(\\pi/2,0)( italic_Œ∏ , italic_œï ) = ( italic_œÄ / 2 , 0 ) (along the x-direction of Figure 6) for both models u8.1 and z9.6. The colors represent the magnitude of the radial velocity. The region of PNS convection, the epoch and realm of early turbulent convection, and the striations that track the emergent sound waves are all encapsulated in this plot. The black line follows the PNS radius, defined as where the mean density equals 1011 g cm-3.\n\nHowever, though sound waves are unambiguously generated (Figures 6 and 7), the inferred luminosity is quite small. To derive this quantity we subtract out the mean flow to obtain the pressure and speed perturbations and then use the last (sub)equation in Eq. 1 to obtain the sonic power. Figure 5 demonstrates that after ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.3 seconds after bounce and just outside the PNS radius (see Figure 7), the emergent acoustic power is small, about five orders of magnitude below LPNSsubscriptùêøPNSL_{\\rm PNS}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_PNS end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. However, at earlier times our estimate of the acoustic power emerging from deeper in gets as high as ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº1048-49 ergs s-1. The turbulence in this region at these earlier times makes it quite difficult to derive this quantity (see eq. 1 and Figure 7), since extracting the relevant pressure and velocity perturbations in this region at this early phase before the flow settles into a smooth, approximately spherical, wind is messy. Nevertheless, it might be that the core generated sound power reaches early on within three orders of magnitude of the peak mechanical luminosity in the PNS convection region and four orders of magnitude of LŒΩe+LŒΩe¬Øsubscriptùêøsubscriptùúàùëísubscriptùêø¬ØsubscriptùúàùëíL_{\\nu_{e}}+L_{\\bar{\\nu_{e}}}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT + italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT over¬Ø start_ARG italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and that it is absorbed within a few tens of kilometers of the region of PNS convection. Wave damping would likely be due to non-linear breaking and/or neutrino cooling (Gossan et al., 2020), and if the former could very marginally contribute to powering the supernova and subsequent wind.\n\nNevertheless, our results challenge the notion that sound generated by tapping PNS convection might be a major factor in powering the supernova or in nucleosynthesis (Nevins & Roberts, 2023; Gossan et al., 2020). However, we have yet to extract the corresponding quantities for other progenitor models. All we can say currently is that we derive quite low acoustic powers for the u8.1 and z9.6 models. It would, however, be illuminating to determine whether higher spatial resolution simulations yield a similar conclusion.\n\n4 Nucleosynthesis\n\nThe origin of the elements is the primary topic of investigation in nuclear astrophysics and has been studied in great detail for more than seventy years. A rich literature (Thielemann et al., 1996; Rauscher et al., 2002; Woosley et al., 2002; Heger & Woosley, 2010; Nomoto et al., 2013; Sukhbold et al., 2016; Limongi & Chieffi, 2018; Curtis et al., 2019) has been created that encompasses pre-supernova stellar evolution, explosive nucleosynthesis, Œ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ±-rich freeze-out (Woosley et al., 2002; Nomoto et al., 2013; Arcones & Thielemann, 2023; Wang & Burrows, 2023b), post-explosion winds (Duncan et al., 1986; Burrows, 1987; Burrows et al., 1995; Qian & Woosley, 1996; Wanajo et al., 2018; Wang & Burrows, 2023a), and neutrino nucleosynthesis (Woosley et al., 1990; Fr√∂hlich et al., 2006; Pruet et al., 2006) that forms the core of our general understanding of the sources of the isotopes of Nature. However, recent developments (Lentz et al., 2015; Wongwathanarat et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2017; Wanajo et al., 2018; Sieverding et al., 2020, 2023; Wang & Burrows, 2023a, b) highlighting the differences between the traditional 1D supernova nucleosynthesis calculations with ad hoc explosions in spherical symmetry and more modern 3D perspectives informed by self-consistent simulations of the explosion, complicated debris trajectories, and the associated nucleosynthesis are emerging to deepen, if also complicate, this narrative.\n\nIn this context, and for this paper, we have sought to determine the differences between 1D and 3D nucleosynthetic realizations for the u8.1 and z9.6 progenitors as representatives of those (rare) models that explode in current theoretical state-of-the-art 1D simulations. We will not here be exhaustive, but will emphasize only the most salient differences we find and will defer to a later work in the context of a larger suite of progenitor models a more detailed investigation. We use the procedures outlined in Wang & Burrows (2023b) to perform the nucleosynthetic calculations.\n\nThe left-hand side of Figure 8 depicts the final electron fraction (YesubscriptùëåùëíY_{e}italic_Y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) distributions for both the 1D (dashed) and 3D (solid) simulations of the u8.1 and z9.6 models. The differences are stark. The 1D models generally explode a bit later and less vigorously. As a consequence, ŒΩesubscriptùúàùëí\\nu_{e}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ŒΩ¬Øesubscript¬Øùúàùëí\\bar{\\nu}_{e}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_ŒΩ end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT absorption on the ejecta has time to push the YesubscriptùëåùëíY_{e}italic_Y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT into a predominantly proton-rich state, with very little neutron-rich matter ejected. In contrast, the 3D models explode earlier and more energetically, with the consequence that ŒΩesubscriptùúàùëí\\nu_{e}italic_ŒΩ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ŒΩ¬Øesubscript¬Øùúàùëí\\bar{\\nu}_{e}over¬Ø start_ARG italic_ŒΩ end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT absorption does not have sufficient time to elevate initially neutron-rich matter near the PNS surface into a very proton-rich state. Moreover, the higher late-time neutrino luminosities in 3D (Figure 3) and the longer dwell times of a fraction of the ejecta result in a spread in the YesubscriptùëåùëíY_{e}italic_Y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT on the proton-rich side to even higher values. The net outcome is a pronounced widening of the YesubscriptùëåùëíY_{e}italic_Y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT distributions of the 3D models vis √† vis the 1D models, with significant consequences for the emergent nucleosynthesis. At the same time, the asymptotic entropy distributions (right-hand panel of Figure 8) are not dramatically different between the 1D and 3D realizations. There are differences, however, in the entropy distributions of the u8.1 and z9.6 models themselves.\n\nFigure 9 shows one of the major consequences. On the left hand panel is the mass fraction distribution of the ejecta versus atomic mass number (Aùê¥Aitalic_A). On its right-hand panel is the corresponding production factor (see Wang & Burrows (2023b)). For the lower Aùê¥Aitalic_As, most of the nucleosynthesis is accomplished prior to the supernova during stellar evolution, and the models are quite similar. However, for the higher Aùê¥Aitalic_As on these plots there is a pronounced difference in the yields. The 1D models do not generate much near the first peak of the r-process (a ‚Äúweak‚Äù r-process), while the 3D models clearly do, and this is a direct result of the presence of significant neutron-rich ejecta in them. This conclusion echoes a similar conclusion in Wang & Burrows (2023a) concerning the nucleosynthetic differences between the s9.0a and s9.0b models. The former (with imposed initial perturbations that kick start turbulence) experienced a more rapid explosion that left enough neutron-rich ejecta to result in significant weak r-process production . These results (re)emphasize the potential importance of the lower mass CCSN progenitors studied in Wang & Burrows (2023a) and Wang & Burrows (2023b) as contributing sources of the first peak of the r-process. We provide the corresponding 56Ni yields in Table 1.\n\nCuriously, the 48Ca yields for the 3D u8.1 and z9.6 models are ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº1.58√ó\\times√ó10-5 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº3.31√ó\\times√ó10-5 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, respectively. This reflects the neutron-richness (Figure 8) of a large fraction of their ejecta and emphasizes, as do the results for the s9.0a model, the possibility that this most neutron-rich of stable nuclei might originate in the explosions of the lowest mass massive stars. The corresponding 44Ti yields are ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº3.5√ó\\times√ó10-6 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº2.9√ó\\times√ó10-6 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, respectively, with the values still growing at the end of the simulation (Wang and Burrows, in preparation). This emphasizes again the important role played by the neutrino-driven winds in 44Ti production, as discussed in Sieverding et al. (2023); Wang & Burrows (2023b).\n\nFor 57Ni, the yields are ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº1.5√ó\\times√ó10-4 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº1.4√ó\\times√ó10-4 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for models u8.1 and z9.6, respectively, resulting in 56Ni to 57Ni ratios of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº40. This is near the solar value of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº43. Moreover, the stable Ni (58Ni, 60Ni, and 62Ni) to 56Ni ratio of the ejecta is around ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº1.0‚àí--1.5 for both 3D models, or 15‚àí--30 relative to the solar ratio of ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.057 (Karrer et al., 2007). If the u8.1 and z9.6 models had had solar metallicity envelopes, the ratio of the aggregate nickel to iron ejecta (after 56Ni decay) would have been ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº5‚àí--6, and this may be what we might expect for a solar-metallicity model that theoretically would have exploded in 1D. However, such a conclusion must await a proper simulation of the relevant progenitor.\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nIn this paper we have focused on the behavior of the cores of representative massive stars that technically explode in spherical symmetry. According to current theory, this is a small subclass of supernova progenitors with very tenuous mantles that at solar-metallicity might have ONe cores at the onset of collapse and inhabit the ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº8‚àí--9 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT mass range (Nomoto, 1984; Limongi et al., 2024). These would be so-called ‚Äúelectron-capture‚Äù supernovae. The classic such model is the solar-metallicity 8.8 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT model of Nomoto (1984), which was shown originally to explode in 1D by Kitaura et al. (2006) and in 2D by Burrows et al. (2007). However, as the behavior of models u8.1 and z9.6 demonstrates, the mass range at extremely low metallicity for which models theoretically explode in 1D may be broader and such progenitors may in fact have iron cores at the onset of collapse.\n\nWhen simulated in 3D with a modern supernova simulation code, we find that the observable outcomes of representative progenitors of this class (for this paper chosen to be the u8.1 and z9.6 models of A. Heger) are quite different than found in 1D in almost all relevant quantities. In particular, we find for the u8.1 and z9.6 progenitors that in 3D the explosion energies are 0.171 B and 0.207 B and the 56Ni yields are 0.572√ó\\times√ó10-2 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and 0.566√ó\\times√ó10-2 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, while in 1D the corresponding quantities are 0.017 B and 0.129 B and 0.164√ó\\times√ó10-2 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and 0.922√ó\\times√ó10-2 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (see Table 1). The large differences in the explosion energy and 56Ni yield between the 3D and 1D simulations of the u8.1 progenitor reflect in part the significant delay to explosion of the latter, associated with its slightly denser mantle (Figure 1). However, the explosion energies are significantly larger in 3D in both progenitors, a consequence not only of the shorter delay to explosion (most prominant for the u8.1 model), but also of the presence in the core of PNS convection (suppressed in 1D). Such lepton-driven convection (Dessart et al., 2006; Nagakura et al., 2020) boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº50% at later times (Figure 3) . The range of final gravitational masses is narrow, and for the 3D models is ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº1.25 M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. This number reflects not only the initial stellar model core structure, but the nuclear equation of state (SFHo) employed in our simulations.\n\nWe find that the distribution of the electron fraction (YesubscriptùëåùëíY_{e}italic_Y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) of the debris is significantly broadened for the 3D models with respect to their 1D counterparts. The more neutron-rich 3D ejecta contain significant weak r-process and 48Ca yields that may be important features of this lower end of the CCSN progenitor mass range. This has also been seen in the solar metallicity s9.0a model (Wang & Burrows, 2023b, a). In addition, we find that the stable nickel to iron ratio of these models is ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº20, and is much higher than that measured for the Crab Nebula (T. Temim, private communication). However, the corresponding ratio for our lower-mass/solar-metallicity/iron-core progenitor models s9.0a and s11 do comport with the Crab measurements, though the ratios for most of the rest of our recent 3D simulation suite (Burrows et al., 2024) are roughly solar. What this may mean will be discussed in Wang & Burrows (in preparation).\n\nWith such tenuous mantles, neutrino-driven mechanical winds emerge quickly and are a major factor in the overall supernova energy. Importantly, after a few tenths of a second after bounce, Lm‚Å¢e‚Å¢c‚Å¢hsubscriptùêøùëöùëíùëê‚ÑéL_{mech}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_e italic_c italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.25 and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº0.15 times smaller in 1D than 3D for the u8.1 and z9.6 progenitors, respectively. We also find that Lm‚Å¢e‚Å¢c‚Å¢h‚àùQÀô1.8‚àí1.6proportional-tosubscriptùêøùëöùëíùëê‚ÑésuperscriptÀôùëÑ1.81.6L_{mech}\\propto\\dot{Q}^{1.8-1.6}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_e italic_c italic_h end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àù overÀô start_ARG italic_Q end_ARG start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1.8 - 1.6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, where QÀôÀôùëÑ\\dot{Q}overÀô start_ARG italic_Q end_ARG is the total neutrino energy deposition rate at the base of the wind.\n\nCoupled with the results for a much broader spectrum of progenitors (Burrows et al., 2024), the results we witness in this paper support the idea that there is a continuity in dynamical behavior and outcomes across the entire progenitor continuum and that the lower mass realm is not qualitatively distinct in terms of the explosion mechanism or dynamics. However, there may be an interesting stellar metallicity dependence of the explosion energy at the low mass end, with lower metallicity explosions for these progenitors having ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àºtwice the explosion energy at the same low ZAMS mass. This conclusion, however, has yet to be made robust and will require further study.\n\nInterestingly, we find that the cores of the 3D models (as opposed to 1D models) radiate acoustic power that may play a modest, though quite sub-dominant, role in supernova and wind dynamics (Gossan et al., 2020; Nevins & Roberts, 2023). This component seems sourced in the fluctuations associated with inner PNS convection and has a frequency range between ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº100 and ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº250 Hz. Whether acoustic power plays an important role anywhere across the supernova progenitor continuum is unlikely, but this has yet to be investigated in adequate detail.\n\nIn conclusion, we have found that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D (spherical symmetry), one must perform modern supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Tea Temim, David Vartanyan, Chris White, and Matt Coleman for previous conversations and/or ongoing collaborations and Alex Heger for sharing his u8.1 and z9.6 progenitor models.
