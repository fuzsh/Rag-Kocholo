        "text": "Georgia Tech awards and coordinates numerous student fellowships – varying in value from a few hundred dollars that may be awarded on top of other funding such as an assistantship, to full fellowships that cover tuition, fees and pay a stipend.\n\nInstitute-level fellowships are managed by the Office of Graduate Education and paid via the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid and the Office of the Bursar. Most fellowships are awarded and nominated internally by schools, not by Graduate Education nor the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. There are also many school-level fellowships which are handled separately by individual academic departments.\n\nThe Office of Graduate Education administers Institute-funded fellowships such as the President’s Fellowship and the Georgia Tech Institute Fellowship, and many others. For example, we manage externally funded programs such as the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship Program, Ford Foundation and Department of Energy fellowships. We work with colleges to facilitate internal competitions for ARCS Foundation Atlanta scholars, and nomination processes for Dolores Zohrab Liebmann, Gilliam fellowship for Advanced Study and Schmidt Science Fellows. We also work with Academic Deans from individual Colleges to facilitate selection processes for donor-initiated fellowships.\n\nThe following information is meant to help you better understand the fellowship and funding opportunities available to you.\n\nFellowships vs. Scholarships\n\nFellowships:\n\nUsually awarded for doctoral research.\n\nMerit-based; not need-based.\n\nFunding is typically meant to be used for tuition and fees but is sometimes discretionary for student awardees to use as they see fit.\n\nOften come with a stipend.\n\nScholarships:\n\nAwarded to students based on academic achievements, financial need, or a combination of both.\n\nUsually merit-based; sometimes need-based.\n\nGenerally, funding must be applied directly to tuition and other related expenses.\n\nDo not include stipends.\n\nFellowship Opportunities\n\nThere are a variety of fellowship opportunities available to graduate students. The awards listed in this section are only a selection of those available.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, many of the awards listed in this section are open only to U.S. citizens and/or U.S. residents. It is challenging for international students to secure fellowships because many are funded by the U.S. government and/or come with a U.S. citizenship requirement.\n\nBe sure to search online utilizing the resources and databases below and ask professionals in your field for additional options.\n\nMulti-Discipline\n\nFellowship NameDescription/EligibilityDeadlineChih Research Publication AwardsThe Chih Foundation awards graduate students whose research publication(s) reflect invention and innovation for the betterment of society in the fields of Engineering, Computer Science, and Health Science.

There are more limited fellowship and funding options for master’s level students and programs. If you are a master’s level student, or are considering a master’s level program, you may be more likely to secure a fellowship if you are pursuing a research-based master’s degree.\n\nWe recommend students to explore fellowship opportunities available for a wide range of degree levels, disciplines, program types, etc., by accessing the fellowship databases below.\n\nPeer Institution Fellowship Databases\n\nPeer institutions offer fellowship databases which students can use to filter by your circumstances and interests. Please disregard those opportunities that are specific to enrollment at those universities.\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nUniversity of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) GRAPES Database\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nDuke University Research Funding Database\n\nJohns Hopkins University\n\nOther External Fellowship Databases\n\nNSF 101: Graduate and Postdoctoral Research Funding Opportunities\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation supports research opportunities and provides stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and scholars.\n\nThere are multiple ways to find these programs, including the funding search on NSF’s website and the NSF Education & Training Application, which is growing its list of opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.\n\nPIVOT Funding Database\n\nOpportunities for all disciplines and project types.\n\nCreate an account to save searches and receive funding alerts.

The website \"Personal Finance for PhDs\" may be useful.\n\nDo I include my scholarship, fellowship, or education grant as income on my tax return (for U.S. citizens and residents for tax purposes ONLY)?\n\nThis IRS Interactive Tax Assistant will help you determine whether the educational assistance you received is taxable. If you attended more than one educational institution and the funds were used for expenses other than qualified education expenses, run the interview separately for each educational institution.\n\nIs my fellowship taxable if I am a nonresident for tax purposes?\n\nIn general, U.S. sourced taxable scholarships, fellowships, and grants that do not represent compensation for services are not subject to withholding when paid to U.S. citizens and residents, but they are subject to withholding when paid to nonresident aliens. If you are not sure if you are a resident or nonresident for tax purposes be sure to consult your GLACIER account. If you do not have a GLACIER account, please put in a ticket at asc.gatech.edu for assistance.\n\nThe withholding tax rate for nonresidents for tax purposes is 30%. However, the withholding tax rate may be reduced to 14% (or a lower treaty rate) if you are a nonresident alien student, researcher, or grantee who is temporarily present in the United States with an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, and the taxable amounts you received are either:\n\nIncident to a qualified scholarship to which section 117(a) applies; or\n\nGranted by certain types of organizations described in section 1441(b)(2).\n\nIf, immediately before arriving in the United States, you were a tax resident of a country that has an income tax treaty with the United States, then you may be eligible for benefits under the applicable treaty, such as an exemption from tax, with respect to your scholarship, fellowship, or grant, including a specified amount that represents compensation for services. In order to determine whether you are eligible for a tax treaty, please consult your GLACIER account. If you do not have a GLACIER account, please put in a ticket at asc.gatech.edu for assistance.\n\nAny part of your scholarship, fellowship, or grant that represents compensation for services performed in the United States is subject to graduated withholding.\n\nAdditional Resources"
