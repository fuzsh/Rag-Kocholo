        "text": "Jim Horan serves as Managing Deputy Commissioner, overseeing the Department’s bureaus of Construction and Compliance; Multi-Family Finance; Homeownership; Community Engagement and Racial Equity; Policy; and Housing Preservation. With the City of Chicago since 2001, Horan has worked in community building for over 22 years, long prioritizing the right to quality housing for all Chicagoans.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2023, Horan provided leadership, vision, and oversight to ensure efficient and accountable operations within the five units that make up DOH's Construction and Compliance Bureau, including long term monitoring of the over 400 properties within the City’s affordable housing portfolio; oversight and approval of the construction phase, contractor activity and payments for multi-family buildings; monitoring and reporting on minority and woman contractor participation; enforcement of the Davis Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements; and all aspects of construction management for work performed under for the Home Repair Program (HRP), formerly the Roof and Porch Program, and senior small repair program.\n\nFor 2024, Horan played an integral role in the expansion of the HRP and the Department’s contractual agreements with seven new delegate agencies and general contractors, six of which are Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC). These partnerships are just one of the ways the Department has recently scaled up its support of BIPOC communities and wealth building.\n\nBefore joining DOH, Horan held positions in various divisions within the Department of Planning and Development. Over the years he has worked on community economic development efforts to revitalize neighborhoods on the south and west sides of the city, including planned developments, economic development, affordable housing, and financial incentives for providers of affordable housing.\n\nHoran holds a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Studies and a Master's Degree in Urban Planning from the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee.\n\nMatt Stern is currently serving as the interim Director of Policy, Research, and Legislative Affairs. He has been a key driver in developing and incubating new affordable housing programs and funding sources, including Green Social Housing, the new DOH/DPD affordable housing and economic development bond, and multiple state and federal grant opportunities.\n\nSince joining DOH in 2022, Matt has led the department’s implementation of the Chicago Recovery Plan, working with teams across the department to deploy $200 million of one-time funding to address critical housing needs across the city. Under his leadership, the department has invested CRP funds in over a dozen distinct affordable housing strategies, including building new programs from the ground up to address homelessness and building decarbonization.\n\nPrior to working at the City, Matt worked on community development and tax policy at the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, led the design and construction of residential solar projects for a renewable energy startup in New England, and worked on development equity and land rights in western India. He is published in the Journal of the American Planning Association and the Carolina Planning Journal.\n\nTamra Collins serves as Deputy Commissioner for the Housing Development Bureau for DOH. The Bureau includes the Housing Finance Division (Multifamily Finance and Asset Management) and the Neighborhood Development and Housing Preservation Division, including the Troubled Buildings Initiative, Micro-Market Recovery Program, Community Receiver, Chicago Neighborhood Rebuild pilot program, and Tax Increment Financing Purchase Rehab.\n\nPrior to her current role, Collins’ nearly two decades of experience includes as Project Coordinator and Financial Planning Analyst (FPA) with both DOH and the Department of Planning and Development, where together with local elected officials, developers, nonprofits, and community organizations she worked to bring safe, decent and affordable housing and economic development to the residents of Chicago. Collins has expertise in the financial analysis and underwriting of multi-family financing projects utilizing private and public resources including land, Tax-Increment Financing, Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Tax-Exempt Bonds, Community Development Block Grants, and HOME Investments Partnership Programs. In addition to her duties as an FPA, Collins served as team lead in technical assistance and departmental liaison to All Chicago’s Continuum of Care, which works to prevent and end homelessness throughout all 77 communities.\n\nCollins is a graduate of Southern University and A&M College, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Baton Rouge, LA. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Marketing.\n\nRima Alsammarae strives to increase and enhance the engagement and communication between the Department of Housing and the public, spreading awareness of the department’s programs, grants, and projects. Creating clear and open pathways to DOH’s work is of paramount importance to her, as she values transparency and equitable accessibility to information.\n\nPrior to joining DOH, Rima worked as a journalist and editor in Dubai and Beirut, where she covered the fields of architecture and development with a particular lens on the Near East and North Africa. Her work has shaped both her understanding of the NENA region’s varied historical development, as well as her passion for global urbanization. To Rima, cities are more than just dense urban centers – they’re the backdrop of the day-to-day for most of the world’s population. Cities are living organisms that need constant care.\n\nRima received an editorial award for an article she wrote and produced in 2018 on the great Iraqi architect Rifat Chadirji, and obtained her Master’s in Urban Resilience from UIC Barcelona in 2022. In 2020, she co-founded a bilingual website named Round City, which publishes academic and journalistic pieces on architecture and development in both English and Arabic."
