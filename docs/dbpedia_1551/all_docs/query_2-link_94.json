This edition can be distinguished from the (also undated) 1895 reprint by the \"Ward Lock and Co.\" in which the imprint in the reprint was changed to that of \"Ward, Lock, Bowden and Co.\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's first novel, and was first published in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, July 1890. Six new chapters are added to this first appearance in book form, with many other additions and variations.

THIS COPY LACKING TWO PRINTS: \"Sybil in her Dressing Room\" and \"Basil in Black Leather Suit\" Jim Dine worked on a stage version of Wilde's novel with English director Robert Kidd for the Bath Academie of Art at Corsham, moving the setting to London during the 1967 Summer of Love. The play was never finished, as the scheduled lead actor, James Fox, objected to Dine's \"obscene\" costumes, derailing the whole production. Petersburg Press stepped in and offered to print Dine's drafts for the adapation.
