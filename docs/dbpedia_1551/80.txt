The development of the complex Supernova case has been nothing short of a pursuit of perfection. It is a contemporary timepiece fashioned in a new Trip-Tick® case which has evolved Bremont’s classic three-piece case construction to achieve a crisp, exquisitely finished aesthetic with beautiful curves and angles.

The resulting ergonomic design is sublime to the touch and beautifully plays with light through the contrasting brushed and polished effects found across the case construction and dial.

Turning the watch over reveals an exhibition case back where the ENG375 calibre and decorated rotor can be viewed, protected by a rubber anti-shock movement mount.
