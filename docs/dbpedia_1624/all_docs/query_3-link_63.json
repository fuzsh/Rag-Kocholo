        "text": "What is really important in product photography?\n\nProduct photography is a subset of still life photography – taking pictures of inanimate objects. It is used in product catalogues, in e-commerce and its main goal is to depict a product as it is, in an attractive way. Good quality product photography is important for e-commerce as it provides information about a product, builds customer’s confidence, and reduces the number of questions.\n\nIn contrast, the goal of commercial (advertising, styled) product photography is to create emotions around the product and tell a story about it. It will aim to attract and engage a potential customer in a story.\n\nBoth types of still life photography can be put into practice with the help of a traditional or automated photo studio. Your studio setup will require different lenses for different purposes. And indeed, the decision whether you wish to engage in commercial or product photography will be defining your choice of lens.\n\nIt is exactly the optical setup of your equipment that will be of key importance to produce good product photography. Read on to our “what is important in a lens?” and “how to proceed with settings?” sections to gain useful information for your choice of lens.\n\nThe photos show the difference in magnification depending on focal length (distance from the subject was the same for each picture).\n\nPhysics aside, for product photography, you should choose a lens with a focal length of at least 50mm or preferably, a higher one. Lenses with a focal length smaller than 50mm can force you to deal with the wide-angle distortion. An example of this fault is visible in the first picture below. The longer the focal length when photographing an object of the same size, the further you have to move it away from the object. Thus, when choosing a lens, remember about the size of the studio space you use.\n\nMagnification ratio\n\nThis is a parameter that often remains hidden from a first-time buyer as you would most often have to look into technical specifications of the lens model to find it. It remains crucial for the quality of macro photography and thus is worth considering.\n\nThe better your magnification ratio, the more detailed your pictures of small products will be. Imagine a small earring magnified to double its size without a loss of detail. This is what you are aiming at with the magnification ratio.\n\nTechnically, magnification ratio is the size ratio at which the photographed object is thrown on the sensor of the camera. A 2cm wide ring shot with a 1:1 magnification lens will be depicted on the sensor with a size of 2cm, while a 1:2 lens will render a 1cm object on the sensor. Simply speaking, look for a higher magnification ratio to achieve better results.\n\nMagnification ratio remains correlated with minimum focusing distance (described below), as the maximum scale is achieved only at the closest distance a lens is able to focus.\n\nMinimum focusing distance\n\nEach lens has a focusing distance limitation – the minimal distance from which the lens can focus on the product. When the distance between the camera and the item is smaller than provided in the lens specification, it will not be able to catch focus properly. You might have to move the camera away from the product.\n\nIn some situations, when you cannot move the camera further from your product (e.g. when using a fixed position in an automated photo booth), you need to manipulate the product. Otherwise, the lens may turn out to be useless.\n\nImage quality in product photography\n\nToday’s customers expect high-quality images. Even though they often use small resolution smartphone screens to view your website, the image has to be sharp for other purposes as well. For example, you might need your pictures for publication in print or on a website, to be seen on large computer screens.\n\nThere are a lot of factors which affect the quality of the final image and lenses are the most important. You should make sure that the lens gives you overall sharpness, from corner to corner. Especially, when you plan to crop detail images from a high-resolution picture.\n\nWhich lens settings should I choose?\n\nWhat aperture value for product photography?\n\nAperture is one of the exposure parameters, next to shutter speed and ISO. It indicates the hole of variable diameter inside the lens, through which light travels into the camera body and onto the image sensor. Simply speaking, It regulates the amount of light which the camera sensor will receive. Thus, it correlates to image brightness and affects the image quality and its depth of field.\n\nIn product photography the aperture stays key to maintaining high quality sharp image and comes into close interplay with shutter speed and ISO. It is one of the questions you cannot omit, if you are interested in the best camera settings for product photography. Read our extensive guide on the aperture to discover how precisely you can manipulate this setting for various effects. For now, a short graphic to acquaint you with the basics.\n\nKeeping in mind that your product photography will require an aperture value of around f/11, it is worth adjusting ISO and shutter speed values accordingly. This order of settings will allow you to keep the sharpness, while still retaining control over brightness.\n\nWhen choosing a lens for product photography, you need to take into account the depth of field you need, the aperture that you are going to use and the quality that is available at this aperture. Different lenses will have different quality at different aperture values. In general, it’s best to keep aperture values of f/16 or below (f/11, f/7).\n\nIn some cases, e.g. in high quality jewellery photography, you may need to use apertures from the range of f/4 – f/5.6 to achieve the best quality (though compromising the depth of field). In this case, to achieve a bigger depth of field, you can use software techniques such as focus stacking.\n\nComparison of pictures taken with aperture f/2.8, f/29 and with focus stacking\n\nWhat is focus stacking for macro photography?\n\nMacro photography is demanding. Product pictures shot with macro lenses offer high level of detail at the cost of focus difficulties. The background and more distant features of the product suffer from low depth of field – they can get blurry and disturb the overall impression of the image. Think of a bracelet with a diameter of 5cm where only the front part stays in focus in the resulting picture.\n\nHere, professional photographers come up with a technique called focus stacking to remedy this issue. It is available for all lenses as it depends on focusing solely. Several photos are shot with focus on different areas of the product and then “stacked” onto each other using post-processing software. The result is usually a crisp sharp image of the product with maximum depth of field (read on to “lens settings” section for more on depth of field manipulation).\n\nThe focus stacking technique in macro product photography is automatically implemented in Orbitvu photo studios and known as “Super Focus”. It will allow you to shoot good macro photos of your products while sparing your work-time in the post-processing software.\n\nMost frequent issues with lenses for product photography\n\nAnyone involved with product photography has already identified several areas which might pose risks to the quality of final images. For a start, let us tell you about several basic faults of lenses.\n\nChromatic aberration\n\nChromatic aberration is an optical problem of a lens. It happens when there is high contrast between the white background and dark edges of an item. A frequent risk for product photographers, as they usually use white backgrounds.\n\nAs a result of chromatic aberration, you can see “fringes” of different colours along the boundaries between dark and bright parts. Even though it is possible to eliminate chromatic aberration in post-production, choosing a high-quality lens with minimal chromatic aberration will better serve your needs and save your time.\n\nWhat is NOT important in your choice?\n\nThere are lens features which add to the price and play its role in shooting action – ports, models, videos. They do not bring benefits for product photography.\n\nMinimum aperture\n\nMinimum aperture is the smallest value or the biggest hole which can be formed in a photographic lens. In the model description of the lens you will usually find a minimal aperture range, right next to the focal length (e.g. 24-105mm f/3.5-5.6). This range reflects the largest possible aperture depending on the focal length used. In this case, the 105mm focal length allows the smallest aperture value of f/5.6 and the 24mm focal length allows f/3.5 minimum aperture value.\n\nMore expensive lenses allow you to use the same minimum aperture value throughout the entire zoom range. The most expensive lenses (so-called fast lenses) allow you to achieve very large apertures in the range of f/1.2-f/2. In the case of product photography, this is usually not important as small apertures are rarely used due to very shallow depth of field.\n\nFast focusing\n\nFast-focusing is not the most important feature of a product photography lens as your item does not move. This is what you should think about when considering the purchase of lenses to shoot action: e.g. in a reportage or in sports photography.\n\nSilent autofocus\n\nThis feature would be helpful when recording a video with sound. When you use the lens for product photography, it is not as important. No sound, no problem.\n\nImage stabilization\n\nIt is practical when shooting handheld video or when you take pictures free-hand. When taking pictures in a photo studio, you will be using a tripod or a similar camera support so there will be no need for image stabilization.\n\nIn the case of some photo-automation solutions (e.g. Orbitvu Alphashot) stabilization has to be permanently disabled when taking images with background removal.\n\nMirrorless cameras have the image stabilization feature in the camera body. Problem solved – there is no longer a need to buy lenses with this option built-in.\n\nHow to choose a lens? – a step by step guide\n\nWith many lenses to choose from on the market, the decision can be difficult and will require some consideration. That’s why we’ve decided to guide you through the process with a step-by-step tutorial.\n\n1. Think about the budget you want to spend on purchasing the lens.\n\nFirstly, the camera model is important. It will be the body that makes good use of the lens potential. If you need to choose and do not have an unlimited budget, it is better to acquire a crop-sensor camera and its dedicated lenses.\n\nSecondly, remember that good quality photos can bring you more profit, so take into account how much you can get out of your lens itself.\n\nLast but not least, lenses tend to lose value over time much less than cameras and usually will be used longer than a camera.\n\n2. Take into account all of the functionalities.\n\nImage quality and sharpness, minimum focusing distance and focal length remain key. You already know that, so your lens decision might be a step further now.\n\n3. Full-frame or crop-frame sensor?\n\nEvery digital camera has an image sensor inside which collects information about the image which is taken. The sensor size in your camera poses a question for the choice of lens due to variations that it causes in available focal length.\n\nA full frame sensor is a digital version of a 35mm film frame. Full frame cameras, in most cases, offer more flexibility. You can use a higher ISO value without getting significant grain effect. It also guarantees, which is important to product photographers, higher image quality. The full-frame is more often used by professionals and the price is higher than the price of crop frame cameras. Additionally, full-frame cameras have smaller depth of field.\n\nA crop frame camera has a smaller sensor. Modern crop cameras can give very satisfying results at lower costs. If you need images for your online shop, you should be able to find some models which will suit your requirements. Smaller sensor means a bigger depth of field than in full-frame cameras.\n\nIt remains possible to use some DX lenses (for crop sensors) on a full-frame camera body. The cameras should automatically switch to DX mode and use only a part of their sensor, one of the same size as in case of a crop frame camera. This, however, happens only if the camera has the “auto-cropping” option and at a loss of resolution. Still, beware of mount compatibility issues between DX lenses and full-frame cameras – always check the specifications.\n\nIn case you want to use a full-frame lens with a crop sensor camera you need to recalculate the effective focal length multiplying it by the crop factor (e.g. 1.5). To show it on an example, crop lenses with focal length 35-135mm used in a full-frame camera will have an effective focal length of ~50-200mm.\n\n4. Choose the brand.\n\nEach brand that produces a body kit has a different lens mount. You cannot use a Nikkor lens for a Canon body and vice versa – a Canon lens for a Nikon body.\n\nYou may also wonder whether to buy lenses from brands other than camera manufacturers. Consider Tamron or Sigma here, who are producers with a significant popularity. In this case, you must remember that the specification should include the type of mount for which the lens was manufactured (e.g. Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Sony). A lens from non-producer brands can be a pretty good compromise – the price is usually lower, while the quality corresponds to that of the original camera producer-branded one.\n\nRemember that these so-called “replacements” may have a different mode of operation, i.e. you will need to calibrate your body with the lens from time to time. Otherwise, you might obtain an unwanted effect of back or front focus. This means that the focal point in the taken picture is shifted in relation to the point you chose while taking the picture.\n\n5. Choose a lens with an appropriate focal length.\n\nTypes of lenses – focal length\n\nThe focal length changes across a wide range of different types of lenses on the market. Main types can be summed up as follows:\n\nvarifocal lens (zoom lens) – allows the focal length to be adjusted within a range (e.g. 27-70mm, 25-105mm, etc.);\n\nprime lens – offers only one fixed focal length (the most popular and universal is 50mm).\n\nIf you photograph items of different sizes, a varifocal lens will allow you to adjust the zoom level to the subject size at any moment. When using a prime lense the only option to zoom-out the image is to move the camera and the lens further from the object. With a zoom lens you can simply make the zoom wider (smaller focal length) without changing the camera position.\n\nWhen you use a fixed lens, you will always have the same focal length, the same angle of view. Although the work can be less comfortable and present some limitations, you will always get the same focal length results. The standard lens, which is 50mm, has a focal length near the optimal 44mm, similar to human vision.\n\n6. Check the lens specification and use a lens comparison website before the final decision.\n\nYou may have realized so far that the parameters of lenses are a complicated multi-dimensional question. To your help in confusing situations come websites such as Digital Photography Review, which offer lens comparison engines and articles. There will be many details listed in a clear table form and an option to compare several lenses. Try this link for their useful comparison tool.\n\nRecommended lens for product photography\n\nDo you remember the feeling of having to look into the thick technical specification and manual booklets of any equipment you buy? Don’t worry, it’s a normal reaction to their specifically difficult language and big volume. However, this time we would like to invite you to have a look into the detailed description of the lens you intend to buy.\n\nSearch there at least for the magnification ratio parameter, one of the less advertised ways to good quality macro photos. Most of your potential buys will already have a “macro” label but with a dive into the tables you will be able to better compare and analyze the pros and cons.\n\nFrom us, here comes a recommendation shortlist of lenses from various brands. We paid attention to the focusing parameters and all the factors we mentioned earlier. It would be important for you to remember that all producers use different mutually incompatible mounts for their lenses. The mount can differ from DSLR to mirrorless even within one brand. Build your set carefully also minding whether you use a crop-frame or full-frame camera.\n\nCanon:\n\nCanon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM – (for crop-frame cameras) You get a very versatile focal length for various needs of product photography. The lens is well-priced and, for Canon, offers a good price-quality ratio.\n\noptimal price-quality / versatile focal length\n\nCanon EF 24-105 mm f/4 L EF IS II USM – (for full-frame cameras) Again a very wide range of focal length.
