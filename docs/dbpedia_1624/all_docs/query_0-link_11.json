        "text": "\"...The company will focus on high-end lenses domestically and make the factory more resistant to fluctuations in demand by being able to flexibly change production items....\"\n\nNikon are obviously confident in sustained demand for their Z Nikkors, even after these heady times of the DSLR>Mirrorless Transition.\n\nThe CEO of Sigma commented on the possible trends of the optics market [emphasis added]:\n\n\"Last year was not so bad,\" he says, when asked about the state of the market: \"It looks like the trend of the shrinking market has hit the bottom.\" But he suggests this may not continue: \"For the time being, many photographers are now switching from DSLR to mirrorless, which will sustain the market. However, after they switch to mirrorless cameras, I worry that the market could shrink in the coming years.\"\n\nSigma CEO talks market trends, the challenge of innovation and the future for APS-C\n\n\"All camera and lens manufacturers have to be innovative,\" says Sigma CEO Kazuto Yamaki, but \"technology competition among manufacturers may not always be beneficial to customers... some other specifications might be more important.\"\n\nGlass has always had a very high margin content providing the major bottom line contribution, usually we see around 5 or so lenses sold to every camera body sold.\n\nFrom a investors perspective and some forward thinking i am guessing glass can be made more universal as have Tamron and Sigma done for years, they have also been a PRICE security defense wall for Nikon Canon Sony glass.\n\nColour management is critical be it cameras or glass, different colours appeal to different people, how to offer that diverse colour range needs can be seen in different brands of lenses and cameras, you have Sony, Canon Nikon, Fuji, Sigma Tamron, it seems all bases are covered, what do they have in common, there all Japanese and collectively dominate the global industry, is there a industry alliance, who knows.\n\nTamron and Sigma may be growth effected- vulnerable first if the lower priced products coming out of China keep coming and no doubt getting better, a welcomed thing for so many people, not everyone needs exotic needle sharp gear. Box shifter major retailers will keep pushing these lines, they will secure market share with unit sales or obtaining greater margins for higher end brands, all a bit like the supermarket industry. Will Nikon Canon Sony ever go full retail directly, watch this space.\n\nCurrently i sense Nikon Canon Sony are moving up stream, Tamron and Sigma will need to shift further up stream as well as the tide of new technology and budget products keeps getting higher.\n\nIn Ways Fuji is in a innovative league of its own, my opinion only. Fuji is a highly underrated innovative product line, their key is excellent colour management and they defiantly make excellent glass. Small Light compact savvy products to affordable MF.\n\nIt seems Glass and Colour management is the life raft so to speak, we say date the camera marry the glass don't we LOL.\n\nNikon taking up a new manufacturing facility has many other reasons behind it as well.\n\nWe know RED is part of the longer term Nikon strategic plan for cameras, optics as well as entering the overall higher end video product market.\n\nThe big three players seem to be shifting from higher unit volume with lower price points to lower volume higher price point, to achieve this you need to offer quality innovation Niche products that work.\n\nNikon is predominately an optics company.\n\nCamera bodies as a pool is becoming very competitive if your not a savvy software orientated company its going to be a tough gig.\n\nCamera bodies are essentially becoming more like lap tops, phones I Pads full of feature buzz rich tech savvy things like Apps presets customizable software and auto features that are impressive and in many cases make traditional skill sets some what obsolete.\n\nThe growth market in cameras seems to be involved around Ai, phones, drones, Go Pro products, and above all VIDEO,\n\nNikon focusing on and investing in new upstream optics manufacturing facilities complimented with excellent colour management, that combination will be hard to attack.\n\nOnly an opinion\n\nAfter launching a Restructuring Program in 2015, it took Nikon a few years to divest the big investments of its Imaging Division dedicated to mass produce Consumer Entry cameras, as well as wind down production of F mount lenses and high end DSLRs.\n\nNikon keeps stating the company's future emphasis is on the high-end, more profitable markets, particularly optics. These include microscope lenses and industrial instruments, besides the Z Nikkors for its MILCs. Cine lenses are also a high probability now that Nikon owns RED.\n\nIt's further likely the significant investments in Robotics, since 2015, are improving the efficiency and quality of the in-house manufacturing of Nikon products, alongside selling robotic imaging technology. Robotic manufacturing will include producing lenses in its new factory.\n\n\"Nikon's grabbing RED out of nowhere for next to nothing is producing even more product envy at Canon/Panasonic/Sony, as well as a little bit of panic. A Nikon that emphasizes high end across both still and video yet undercuts the others in price while pushing the envelope on performance is very, very scary. To explain why, I have to use the smartphone market as an example: Apple is not the largest volume producer with iPhone worldwide, yet Apple scoops up far more of the profits in the smartphone arena than the others combined. High end done right is the Golden Egg in tech, and Nikon suddenly seems to be figuring that out (again).....\"\n\nMaybe it is as simple as being a profitable company\n\nNothing wrong in being simply profitable, its what excites shareholders to stay and or even invest more.\n\nProfitability must be tied to a degree of growth to survive, unless you have a patented product monopoly of some sort.\n\nNikon has done a bad job of transitioning from one era to another, never the less they have finally gotten to where they are now despite the painful experience for customers subjected to product initial under development, QC and supply issues, least not forgetting loss of market share.\n\nGrowing of market share, that's the next challenge, profit is one thing growth is another.\n\nGrowth can come from mergers acquisition or innovation.\n\nBottom line, when you look at where Nikon was a few years back with higher unit volume and market share, reasonable steady profits, till mirror less hit the pavement big time led by Sony.\n\nThe industry has lost over 50% of the global market for many reasons regardless of it being DSLRS or Mirror less............yet profitability today is showing as doing very well and in cases well ahead or on track, doesn't that mean costs have been cut be it product redesign, outsourcing, pushing production, add to this margins and prices that have been raised, that's ok short term to fill up the war chest and meter out throwing a bone to feed the investors occasionally, but it gets to a point where cost cutting and margin hikes can only do so much........your back to needing Growth and Innovation, something every one else is looking for as well.\n\nSo my punt is now its time for the old rule of the big need to get bigger the small need to adapt or get out, also what i feel is its the prime time to keep the door open for opportunity to buy market share, consolidate the industry somewhat, mergers or acquisition can very well be a good thing, certainly for the balance sheets.\n\nBeing profitable rich and powerful doesn't always mean you survive, its the adaptable that do, look at nature and the universe.\n\nWhat is ahead is of everything is the arrival of people generational change, internet demands, coupled with Ai, and new innovative ideas shaping our future.\n\nHardware anyone can make, software is a skill and key, sadly it drives our way of life.\n\nIs a safe haven for now unique light compact powerful glass or in general good optics everyone needs or is looking for especially as videography which is growing quickly.\n\nInteresting times ahead.\n\nOnly an opinion"
