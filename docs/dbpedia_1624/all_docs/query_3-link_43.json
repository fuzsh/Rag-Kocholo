        "text": "Since, as shown above, I do a bit of everything in my nature photography — landscapes, macro, birds, wildlife, camera traps, remote wide angle setups, aerials — I wanted a high-resolution body like my beloved Canon 5DsR but with improved dynamic range and high ISO performance for landscapes and wildlife and better AF and frame rate capabilities for action. The Sony a7RIII seemed to fit the bill and, I thought, would allow me to ease into the mirrorless world by letting me transition over while using my Canon lenses. B and H Photo Video loaned me a Sony a7RIII body to review, and I even ended up buying it, thinking that I would grow into it eventually. You can read my thoughts on the Sony a7RIII during this transition but, in the end, I found that I did not like mirrorless for the kind of work I do, and I particularly was not a fan of Sony’s implementation of mirrorless.\n\nMirrorless restricted me in many ways (battery life, durability, the EVF lag, use of flash). I also quickly tired of always having to concentrate on where to find things in the giant Sony menus. In sum, I found mirrorless to be inefficient and less enjoyable for my style of shooting. I realize mirrorless is the future, and many people love it. Many people love Sony mirrorless cameras. That’s fine with me as Sony is really pushing the technology, and it’s great that we have lots of options. Mirrorless simply isn’t the right choice for me and my photography right now.\n\nSo, after my flirtation with mirrorless, I decided I wanted to stick with DSLRs for as long as I could. That left me with two options.\n\nFirst, I could wait for Canon to come out with a new DSLR that would combine the best features of the 5DsR (high megapixel count) and the 5DIV (good high ISO and dynamic ranger, faster frame rate). But that did not seem likely to happen. Even if it did, it seemed likely that the sensor performance would still lag behind that of Nikon and Sony.\n\nSecond, I could switch systems to Nikon and use the already existing Nikon D850 as my camera body of choice. That body offered exactly what I wanted for everything I do in my nature photography, and I’m quite familiar with Nikon camera bodies. So, switching would not entail a steep learning curve. Plus, Nikon appears to be committed to putting out a successor to both the D850 and the D5 next year. So, switching to Nikon would put me in a position to be able to use great, cutting-edge DSLR bodies for quite some time into the future.\n\nNikon D850 — Quite simply, the king of cameras for nature photography. I truly believe it’s the best camera ever made for the nature photographer who shoots a variety of subjects and styles and does creative work in challenging environments.\n\nNikon D500 — A great action camera in APS-C format, but I haven’t bought it yet. For the moment, I will wait and see what happens with the D750 DSLR successor, the to be announced follow-up to the D850, and even the rumored mirrorless APS-C body that Nikon is developing. Yes, I could live with mirrorless for a second body dedicated to natural light action/bird portraits. If I needed a backup today, however, the D500 would be a great choice that boasts fantastic AF performance and frame rate.\n\nTamron 17-35 mm f/2.8-4 zoom lens — Nikon doesn’t have the best offerings for wide angle zooms. The 14-24 mm is fantastic but it’s a beast and a pain for using filters (which I almost always do for daytime landscape photos). Nikon’s 16-35 mm f/4 zoom is just OK, not great like the Canon version. And Nikon doesn’t have a 16-35 mm f/2.8 lens. So, the new Tamron fit the bill for very good sharpness, light weight and compact size, the 77 mm filter thread, and a great price. I do wish it had image stabilization though.\n\nTamron 35-150 mm f/2.8-4 zoom — The companion to the above lens, this Tamron zoom also sports the 77 mm filter size important to me and boasts great performance in a do it all focal length for everything from landscapes to portraits. It focuses quite closely too, which makes it a good lens for butterflies and lizards. It does have VC, Tamron’s image stabilization technology. And it’s also light, compact, and pretty inexpensive. It should prove to be a great one lens solution for aerial photography!\n\nSigma 150 mm f/2.8 macro — This has been my macro lens of choice for years with my Canon cameras, and I wanted it again for Nikon. For some reason, it’s now discontinued (most likely Sigma is now focusing on mirrorless mounts), but I was able to find a good used copy for a great price. The 150 mm focal length is the sweet spot for macro in my opinion as it’s light enough to handhold but also has a tripod collar for more static work, all while providing superb performance at a comfortable working distance. If you can’t find a used copy of the Sigma 150 mm macro, their 105 mm macro version is available and is also a great performer. I’m not a big fan of the Nikon 105 mm f/2.8 macro because it becomes an f/4 lens at closer focusing distances. That’s not a big deal for many, but I sometimes like to shoot tight macro at f/2.8 for a creative look.\n\nSigma 150-600 mm f/5-6.3 Contemporary zoom — Years after Sigma lent me a copy for a review (see the full blog post here), this lens continues to impress. It’s not the fastest telephoto for autofocus nor is the image stabilization stellar, but the ability to take tack sharp images in a wide zoom range, even wide open, and in a fairly small, light, and sub-$1000 package is amazing. I love animals in the environment so a telephoto zoom is the perfect lens for me. And, when I need the occasional tight standard portrait of a bird or mammal, this lens performs very well at that holy grail focal length of 600 mm.\n\nNikon 20 mm f/1.8 — I decided on this lens to do double duty for night work and wide angle macro. It’s sharp, fast, and has a very close minimum focus distance. And yes, it also has the 77 mm filter thread so I can easily use a polarizing or ND filter with this lens.\n\nGodox V860 II — I have three of these. They work well in the hotshoe, on a flash bracket, or as wireless radio frequency slaves or masters. And they work with any camera system; just buy the appropriate transmitter from Godox for around $60. They do everything that a Canon 600-RT or Nikon SB-5000 will do but for a fraction of the price and with a great flash interface (copied from Canon!). The custom lithium battery by Godox is also great as it recycles quickly and holds a charge for an extended period compared to rechargeable NiMh AA options.\n\nGodox AD200 — This amazing flash gives me about 2-3 stops more power than a standard hotshoe flash but in a small form factor. It’s basically a studio strobe that’s not much bigger than a standard flash, and it works seamlessly with Godox’s wireless flash transmission system for any camera brand. I use this flash when I need to add light on a subject in bright tropical daylight conditions. The AD200 sports a similar custom lithium battery pack.\n\nGodox XPro transmitters — At a cost of around $60, these are the units that allow us to use any Godox flash off-camera and with full capabilities for any camera system. I have one for Nikon of course but also others for Canon and for Sony, just in case I borrow gear or I want to plug a client into a setup during a workshop.\n\nDJI Mavic 2 Pro — I love aerial photography (in fact I’m starting a new coffee table book project on the theme this year), and the Mavic 2 Pro is awesome. It’s small enough to always include with my gear for any trip, and the image quality, flight time, and features are great. I use mine with Freewell polarizing and ND filters for most of my still work. While nothing can substitute for the opportunity to get up in an ultralight plane, a helicopter, or a gyrocopter with my DSLR camera, drones open up a whole new world for aerial photography.\n\nHuawei P30 Pro — Yep, we’ve arrived at that point where a photographer’s smartphone is a key piece of gear. Because Apple products are crazy expensive and service is limited in Costa Rica, I use Windows and Android. Huawei has made great strides in camera technology for phones. I use my phone for dual-camera video recording for new blog and e-book projects, for workshop candid photos, for behind the scenes photos, and for high-quality travel photos for advertising and social media. The P30 Pro boasted night photo mode before the iPhone 11 and is a great all-around performer with its ultra-wide angle and zoom capability. This phone was released before the Trump trade wars so it is fully vetted for Android updates and Google services.\n\nHuawei Matebook Pro — This laptop is the Macbook Pro for Windows users and, in some ways, even better, especially for the price. It’s light, fast, feature-packed and looks great. It’s a clone for sure but it’s what I’ve always wanted as a Windows user, and Huawei did it very well."
