        "text": "Nikon’s recent NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 seems natural in the development of the line. The company started their mirrorless Z-mount lens lineup with a series of excellent f/1.8 primes and now ups the game. Every full-frame system offers at least one 35mm f/1.4; it’s a classic, so this move is to be expected from Nikon. Oddly, though, Nikon hasn’t endowed this lens with their prestigious “S” monicker. The new 35mm f/1.4 is about the same size as its f/1.8 sibling, and to complete the oddity – the f/1.4 version is more affordable! So what’s going on here? Let’s dive in.\n\nNikon was among the last players to enter the mirrorless game. The company took an initial shot with their innovative (but rather unsuccessful) “1 series” in 2011, but it wasn’t until late 2018 that the Japanese manufacturer announced the Z series. The company also initially blocked third-party optics and only recently allowed some development, so they are still heavily dependent on in-house R&D and production.\n\nNikon has produced some impressive optics for the Z-Mount over the years and took an innovative path regarding their mirrorless lineup. Arguably, the most prominent set of the Z-Mount is the f/1.8 “S” prime line. Taking the higher road, these lenses denounce the affordability associated with f/1.8 prime lenses for a new approach. Modern optics and better build made them larger than traditional f/1.8 primes, but that was partially offset by the modest aperture, so the set is substantially smaller than the SIGMA Art lenses. Nikon managed to create a compact yet high-end prime set.\n\nEnter the Nikon NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4\n\nThe new Nikon NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 occupies an odd segment. It’s 2/3 stops faster than the 35mm f/1.8 S while maintaining a similar size and the same 62mm front filter diameter. The new lens foregoes the AF/MF switch but gets a useful function ring for various assignable functions. To top it off, weather sealing is also in place. So why didn’t Nikon assign it with the premium “S” – and why is it priced at a more affordable sum than the slower, older, function-ring-less 35mm f/1.8 S?\n\nThe secret is in the (optical) sauce?\n\nThe new NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 optical formula consists of 11 elements in 9 groups, two of which are aspherical elements. This is simpler than its f/1.8 S counterpart, boasting 3 aspherical and two ED (Extra-low Dispersion) elements. The latter also got Nikon’s top Nano Crystal Coating. Both lenses use 9 rounded aperture blades. The NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 weighs 415g/0.91 lbs, while the f/1.8 is a tad lighter at 370g/0.81 lbs. While we haven’t had the chance to examine the lens’ performance, the simpler optics, combined with a faster aperture, could lead to inferior technical quality.\n\nGeared for video\n\nThis new lens complements Nikon’s newfound video passion. The current crop of impressive hybrids, with some high-end video features, dictates some updates to the lens lineup. The new 35mm f/1.4 delivers – suppressed focus breathing, a silent STM motor for focusing, and a clickless function ring that will make motion capture more streamlined. Its compactness will ease rigging and gimbal work.\n\nWhere should we place the NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4?\n\nThe NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 is quite an anomaly, at least in modern optic terms. Just try to recall the last time you saw an f/1.4 lens priced lower than a similar f/1.8 in the same line when both were still in production. We have had premium f/1.8 lenses, such as the Sony ZEISS 55mm f/1.8, but Nikon’s situation is different and rather rare.\n\nIf anything, this new NIKKOR lens reminds me of traditional 50mm f/1.4 DSLR lenses. Those were moderately affordable, provided excellent light-gathering capability at the bright end, and excellent technical quality at narrower aperture settings. Fairly compact, they often used simple double Gauss designs and were relatively soft at f/1.4. No fancy construction either. They were mainly “plastic-fantastic.” But they worked.\n\nOptimal compromise\n\nIn a world of extreme resolution and painfully sharp lenses, Nikon took the road less traveled. Instead of focusing on pristine optical performance (pun!), the company chose to emphasize compactness, ease of use, and affordability. The company markets the new 35mm towards hybrid content creators as well as APS-C shooters (as a fast, normal option, 53mm equivalent). It should also work for all kinds of documentary photography, environmental portraits, etc. An interesting move on Nikon’s part.\n\nPrice and availability\n\nThe Nikon NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 Lens will set you back $596.95 / €638.53. The lens is available for pre-order with estimated shipping in mid-July."
