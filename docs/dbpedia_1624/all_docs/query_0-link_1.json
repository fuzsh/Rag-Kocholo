        "text": "TOKYO - Nikon Corporation (Nikon) is pleased to announce that the total production of NIKKOR lenses for Nikon interchangeable lens cameras reached 120 million* as of April, 2024.\n\nAs one of the world's few manufacturers that begins its manufacturing process from the production of optical glass, Nikon offers NIKKOR F lenses for single-lens reflex cameras and NIKKOR Z lenses for mirrorless cameras. In 2023, NIKKOR celebrated the 90th anniversary of its first product release. Drawing inspiration from the NIKKOR brand's remarkable 90-year history and its endless technological advancements, Nikon remains committed to contributing to the development of imaging culture, with the hope of expanding possibilities for imaging expression.\n\n*The total number of interchangeable lenses for SLR and mirrorless cameras produced by Nikon.\n\nThe NIKKOR brand\n\nThe 90 years of NIKKOR's history commenced in 1932 with the registration of the NIKKOR trademark by Nikon (then Nippon Kogaku K.K.), soon followed in 1933 by the introduction of Aero-Nikkor aerial photographic lenses. Nikon is one of the world's few manufacturers that begins its manufacturing process from the production of optical glass. From the initial design and development to the production and final inspection, the entire process leading to the release of a NIKKOR lens is managed in accordance with Nikon's own strict quality standards. This commitment to excellence is the foundation for the exceptional optical performance and superior quality of NIKKOR lenses. Over the years, by consistently developing lenses that feature the cutting-edge optical technologies of the time, NIKKOR has grown to be a globally recognized brand renowned for its high-performance lenses.\n\nNIKKOR F lenses, throughout their legacy of more than half a century since their initial introduction in 1959, have continually incorporated the cutting-edge technologies of the time, including such features as aperture control, autofocus, and vibration reduction (VR). NIKKOR Z lenses are designed for use with Nikon mirrorless cameras for which a new mount with the largest diameter in the industry*1 was adopted. Further possibilities in lens design have been unlocked through the adoption of this new mount, greatly increasing capabilities in optical performance. A wide variety of specialized NIKKOR Z lenses that support each user's creative imaging expression has been released, including the high-performance flagship NIKKOR Z 58mm f/0.95 S Noct, which achieved the milestone of being the fastest lens in Nikon history with an aperture of f/0.95*2.\n\n*1 Among full-frame mirrorless cameras, as of May 23, 2024. Based on Nikon research.\n\n*2 Among interchangeable lenses for Nikon cameras.\n\nRelated Links"
