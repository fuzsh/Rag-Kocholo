        "text": "Fashion and portrait photography are two similar intertwining threads intricately woven throughout the same fabric. Each genre of photography is used to influence one another’s unique point of view and is then captured through a unique lens for a differing viewpoint.\n\nWhile both fashion and portraiture are used to ultimately tell a story, the unique characteristics of that storyline can be greatly expounded upon with the various focal lengths paired with the angles that we choose to utilize in our captured frames.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the best lens for fashion portrait photography, there’s a multitude of choices at your disposal. Ranging from fixed focal length prime lenses and the multiple pluralities offered by zoom lenses, there really isn’t a wrong choice. It all comes down to personal preference.\n\nEach focal length provides photographers with pieces of glass that are suitable for capturing images with unique angles, ultimate sharpness, and an aesthetic or look that the lens is predominantly known for.\n\nThe following lenses are the best lenses for fashion and portrait photography that come highly recommended by working fashion photographers to ignite or elevate your current body of work.\n\n50mm prime lens\n\n85mm prime lens\n\n35mm prime lens\n\n24-70mm zoom\n\nEgith of Wilhelmina Models, Los Angeles captured with the Canon EF 50mm f/1.2L USM Lens.\n\n50mm Lens\n\nIf there were to be a recommendation for the single most versatile lens on the market, the 50mm lens would be it. Often referred to as thenifty fifty, the focal length is hands down the best all-around prime lens for portraiture and fashion photography.\n\nThe 50mm lens is known as one of the most powerful workhorses in the industry because of its portability and adaptability. They are one of the lighter lenses in the photography industry and are quick to focus on almost any and all lighting conditions, making it an ideal lens in the fast-paced world of fashion where speed is of virtue.\n\nThe focal length of the 50mm lens is wide enough to capture full body length as well as 3/4 body length frames in tighter spaces that fashion photographers rely on to showcase the designs. The slight distortion of this particular prime lens creates more angular frames that are ideal for lengthening our subjects while simultaneously creating a subtle slimming effect.\n\nThis focal length is my personal lens of choice when it comes to working with men’s portraiture and enhancing the architectural curvature of their bone structure without depending on the light to carve out their visage.50mm is also a natural focal length choice when it comes to providing a little more height to female models and women in general.\n\nIlias of Red Models NYC captured with Canon EF 50mm f/1.2L USM Lens.\n\nPortrait photographers rely heavily on the 50mm lens because it offers a striking balance of the background with closer proximity to the subject for environmental portraits. This compromise makes it easier to establish a scene within a narrative for a fashion story or editorial. It also is ideal for photographers who specialize with personal branding as the prime focus.\n\nWhile there is a slight distortion, it is minimal enough that the 50mm focal length can also be used to capture tighter crops and portraits in a desirable manner. The 50mm lens is just wide enough to begin to achieve the unique ground-up perspective for unique angles that are heavily sought after in fashion while providing the option for sufficient bokeh from a slightly different perspective.\n\nIt is also light enough that image stabilization isn’t a prerequisite to achieving stunning results. Because of this simplicity and versatility, fashion photographers have orchestrated entire model test shoots using only a 50mm lens.\n\nChristine of APM Model Management, NYC captured with the Canon EF 50mm f/1.2L USM Lens.\n\nPricing for 50mm lenses is relatively inexpensive, starting under two hundred dollars for an entry-level f/1.8. The price tag naturally compounds as we move towards an aperture of f/1.2 and the newest highly esteemed mirrorless options. The more expensive offerings come equipped with weather sealing as well as better bokeh.\n\nSeeing as how the 50mm easily adapts to other genres of photography which aren’t often in a fixed environment such as weddings, street photography, and photojournalism, it is worth it, in the long run, to invest in the glass that will stand up to the environment. Additionally, the wider aperture is ideal for low light situations as well as creating better bokeh which is more suitable for portraiture.\n\n50mm Lens Recommendations\n\nBest Overall Lens\n\nSony Planar T* FE 50mm F1.4 ZA Lens - $1,498\n\nCanon RF 50mm f/1.2L Lens - $2,299\n\nBest Budget Lenses\n\nCanon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM Lens- $349\n\nNikon 50mm f/1.4G AF-S Nikkor Lens - $446.95\n\nSigma 50mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art Lens - $1,008\n\nMy Personal Favorite 50mm Lens\n\nCanon EF 50mm f/1.2L USM Lens - $1,399\n\nAllision of Red Models NYC captured with Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L II USM Lens.\n\n85mm Lens\n\nThe 85mm lens is perhaps best known as the quintessential portrait lens among photographers. The versatility of capturing striking close-ups as well as full-length frames with sufficient details is the prime reason why this lens is attached to my camera more than 85% of the time.\n\nThese medium telephoto lenses are notoriously tack-sharp which is ideal for the details and textures of fabrics in fashion photography while the compression of the longer focal length creates beautiful bokeh, making it easier to separate the subject from the background which is ideal for portraiture.\n\nWhether shooting in natural light conditions or within the studio, these lenses track subjects and focus well. 85mm is also the perfect focal length as it creates just enough distance from the end of the photographer’s lens to the subject while still being able to communicate clearly.\n\nWhen shooting tighter crops with fashion photography, I especially like to use the 85mm for added drama when playing with light and shadows to accentuate the textures of the hair, skin, and clothing. Although this lens is primarily used for tighter crops and headshots, the overall sharpness makes it a worthy contender for ¾ length shots as well as full-body images where the details are of the utmost importance.\n\nAndrew of Brown Agency captured with Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L II Lens.\n\nThe depth of field created by the 85mm focal length is easily manageable to create captivatingly moody portraits that make a lasting connection with the viewer. The compression of the lens yields a lot of artistic opportunities for photographers when storytelling by providing a very unique vantage point.\n\nSimply shooting through an object while focusing on the subject adds a level of depth and provides an element of voyeur within the environment, setting the stage to improve the overall feel of the scene.\n\nIt has to be said that the science behind the most expensive offerings of these 85mm lenses historically remains largely unchanged and is slightly antiquated at best, not to mention that these heavy hitters are sometimes seemingly as agonizingly slow to focus in less than ideal light as they are heavy.\n\nThis is not a bad thing as most of the newer mid to entry-level 85mm lenses being introduced to the market are offering a competitive edge at a better price point that is difficult to say no to.\n\nFor example, Sony created an entry-level f/1.8 85mm lens a few years back that performed more akin to a mid-level lens from a prominent competitor that was double the cost. It is quick to focus in an arena of lighting and shooting situations and the image quality is superb. This particular lens is a delight to shoot with and the image quality does not disappoint.\n\nChristine of APM Model Management NYC captured with Canon EF 85 f/1.4L IS USM Lens.\n\nOther companies have since followed suit by introducing lenses that provide image stabilization, a necessary evil as the megapixel arms race continues and the world of photography is migrating to the land of mirrorless at the cost of a mere fraction of a stop reduction. Canon’s 85mm f/1.4L is another shining example of this market trend.\n\nSimply put, it is not necessary to purchase the most expensive 85mm lens in this case if you are shooting with a DSLR or you have been shooting with mirrorless for a while. Now if you are changing over to the newest mirrorless offerings from either Canon or Nikon, be prepared to shell out a lot of money.\n\nFinally, if the opportunity presents itself to rent thecreme de la creme Zeiss 85mm lens, I highly recommend indulging in the beauty and change of pace the manual masterpiece has to offer.\n\n85mm lens Recommendations\n\nBest Overall Lens\n\nZeiss 85mm f/1.4 Apo Planar ZF.2 Manual Focusing for Nikon - $4,490\n\nBest Budget Lenses\n\nSony FE 85mm F1.8 E-Mount Lens - $598\n\nSigma 85mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art Lens - $1,199\n\nMy Personal Favorite 85mm Lenses\n\nCanon EF 85mm 1.4L IS USM Lens - $1,599\n\nSony FE 85mm F1.4GM G-Master E-Mount Lens - $1,798\n\nMichala of Major Models NYC captured with the Canon EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM Lens.\n\n35mm Lens\n\n35mm lenses are tools of specificity and they are often revered as the storytelling lens for their ability to capture more than simply a pretty picture. The 35mm focal length is ideal for incredible environmental portraits where the subject is the main focus for both portrait and fashion photography.\n\nIt can also be used to create a more intimate connection with the viewer by creating portraits that feel as though the subject or model is in close enough proximity to reach out and touch. Fashion photographers often rely on this viewpoint and capitalize on this in order to create a sense of intimacy and connection with the viewer when bringing a fashion story to life.\n\nThe 35mm focal length is an interesting lens because it can be rather challenging for photographers to utilize when it comes to incorporating people into the environment and it does require practice to become well versed with the desired angles to facilitate the overall scene.\n\nThat being said, it is easy to fall in love with this lens once the user has become acquainted with and embraced its nuances. The 35mm focal length is one of the very best lens choices to successfully incorporate and communicate a story within our imagery for portrait and fashion photography.\n\nMichala of Major Models NYC captured with the Canon EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM Lens.\n\nOn a full-frame camera, the 35mm lens provides an image quality that is reminiscent of a wider lens on a medium format film camera body. This timeless look set the precedence for the standard of fashion photography from its inception and it will continue to be sought after for years to come.\n\nThe 35mm focal length is wide enough that it provides only a slight distortion and yet it isn’t so unrealistic that the overall frame becomes fallible; its point of view remains true. This is an exemplary perspective when capturing environmental portraits, especially for commercial branding sessions, where the entirety of the environment is necessary to convey the specific point of view.\n\nMichala of Major Models NYC captured with Canon EF 35mm f/2 Lens.\n\nWhen it comes to shooting in small spaces such as a car or the back of an AirStream, the 35mm offers proximity to the subject that can be so close that it feels as if we are invading their personal space while at the same time providing the viewer with the sense that they are part of that scene. It creates just enough separation from the background, maintaining the subject as the main focal point of interest.\n\nLast but not least, the focal length of the 35mm lens allows fashion photographers and portrait photographers alike to capture entire full-length images in a thriving city background safely. Once this lens becomes second nature, it is difficult to put down and its unique perspective often unleashes endless creativity. I have yet to work with a 35mm lens at any price point that has failed to provide the intended results.\n\n35mm Lens Recommendations\n\nBest Overall Lens\n\nSigma 35mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art Lens - $899\n\n*This lens is the best overall value as well for the price point.\n\nBest Budget Lenses\n\nCanon EF 35mm f/2 IS USM Lens - $599\n\nCanon RF 35mm f/1.8 Macro IS STM Lens - $499\n\nSony FE 35mm f/1.8 E-Mount Full Frame Lens - $748\n\nTamron SP 35mm f1/8 Di VC USD Lens - $599\n\nMy Personal Favorite\n\nCanon EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM Lens - $1,799\n\nElle of Glacier Model Management captured with the Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM Lens.\n\n24-70mm lens\n\nFor those photographers that do not naturally gravitate towards prime lenses or prefer to have more of a one size fits all option, the 24-70mm lens will be your go-to lens. It offers a one-stop-shop for most of the focal lengths that are relied upon for fashion and portrait photography alike. It may actually be the all-around best lens for fashion and portrait photography.\n\nWhile it doesn’t offer the same bokeh as the high end 85mm lenses, the compression is more than sufficient to separate the subject from the background and not detract from the story being told. In fact, it is a gratuitous compromise that runs parallel between the benefits of the 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm prime lenses.\n\nThe convenience of the 24-70mm focal length allows fashion photographers to stay in one place and capture a multitude of crops of the exact same image without having to work or move around the subject.This is essential for capturing lookbooks where hundreds of looks are being shot as quickly as possible. A 24-70mm zoom lens can be used to shoot an entire story, both fashion and commercial portraiture alike, while offering unique angles and perspectives.\n\nThe 24-70mm lens is also a lens to be used for embracing distortion. Playing around with the never-ending variety of angles and perspectives is as much fun as it is artistically liberating. The distorted look is heavily embodied throughout the realm of fashion photography to create a mood while simultaneously accentuating the product being sold.\n\nThe distortion facilitated by shooting at a wider focal length from the ground up yields a sense of power and presence while also highlighting the fashion being worn. Adversely, shooting down at the subject can create a sense of belonging while focusing on an item such as a purse or pair of shoes makes for a playful fashion image.\n\nElle of Glacier Model Management captured with the Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM Lens.\n\nThese same characteristics and ideals are used by portrait photographers to influence how we can use the 24-70mm focal length to capture our clients. We shoot up at our subjects when we want to convey a sense of strength and confidence.\n\nWe shoot at both eye level and even slightly down at our portraiture subjects in order to showcase a feeling of approachability and even slight vulnerability, making the overall frame that much more believable and impactful.\n\nThe drawback of these lenses is that they are not the most ergonomically friendly lens to work with. Additionally, their convenience and ability to encapsulate such extreme varieties comes at a steep cost, often upwards of $1,000. It is worthwhile, however, to invest in something of this caliber to ensure the best array of image quality options for our clients.\n\n24-70mm Lens Recommendations\n\nBest Overall Lenses\n\nCanon RF 24-70mm f/2.8 L IS USM Lens - $2,299\n\nSony FE 24-70mm f/28 GM G Master E-Mount Lens $2,198\n\nBest Budget Lenses\n\nNikon Z 24-70mm f/f S Lens for Z Series Mirrorless - $996.95\n\nSigma 24-70mm F2.8 DG OS HSM IF Art Lens - $1,299\n\nTamron SP 24-70mm f/2.8 Di VC USD G2 Lens - $1,199\n\nMy Personal Favorite Lens\n\nCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM Lens - $1,699\n\nMichala of Major Models NYC captured with the Canon EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM Lens.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nProper lens choice paired with thoughtfully planned out and executed angles can take an ordinary fashion or portrait photoshoot and improve upon the overall quality of the images produced. As the world is steadfastly moving to all things mirrorless, it isn’t necessary for portrait and fashion photographers to keep their current lineup of glass and buy a quality adaptor such as a Metabones to make the transition easier.\n\nIt is also never a bad idea to purchase one main lens and rent the other pieces of glass to explore their capabilities and ultimately choose what is the best fit for your camera bag. Many fashion photographers working in the industry own minimal gear and will rent the best camera bodies accompanied by the best high-end lenses for the job, ensuring high overall client satisfaction.\n\nWhether the preference is multiple primes or a more one size fits most approach with a zoom lens, these lenses are sure to aid in adding to the narratives that we tell when it comes to capturing our clients."
