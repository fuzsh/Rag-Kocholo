Why is it that there is still so little glass made by smaller manufacturers for the full frame mirrorless mounts from Canon and Nikon? Dave McKeegan offers up some statistics to show the vast difference between Sony and every other manufacturer",

        "text": "Notice that in #1 I said f/1.2 or f/1.4 and I clearly meant fast primes, which are currently lacking in Nikon's line-up even if many of them will be filled within the next year or two. I specified f/1.4 for the 105mm because they have a 105mm macro lens so I thought it was important to specify that it was a fast 105mm that they were missing.\n\nAs for saying that those are extreme lenses, they really aren't Super telephoto lenses are standard lenses in sports and wildlife photography. A 70-200mm f/4 is hardly an extreme lens-just the completion of the f/4 set. Tilt-shift lenses are standard in architectural and real estate photography. Slow compacts are the furthest thing from \"extreme lenses\". Fisheyes and 11mm/12mm ultra-wides are probably the most niche thing in that list with fisheyes being standard gear in the growing world of 360 photography.\n\nWhat makes you think that Nikon licensing their mount would force them out of business? If that was the case, they may as well be a dead company walking because you're basically claiming that the only reason they're able to stay in business is by artificially forcing people to use their own first-party lenses. If Nikon opened their mount, many people would still opt to purchase Nikon lenses because of their quality and many people who wouldn't otherwise purchase one of their bodies due to their first-party lenses being expensive may opt to do so because they can afford the third party options. Having more bodies sold would put them in a far stronger position overall than trying to make an extra buck from their lenses.\n\nAs it stands, none of these companies can plan for \"decades\". The entire camera industry is perpetually a few bad years away from ruin at this point. Trying to implement a decades-long strategy in a year-by-year market is a terrible business strategy because we've literally no clue what the market will look like 10 years from now, much less 20. Having a large market share is the closest thing that any of these companies have in terms of insurance for an uncertain future.\n\nAs for who is providing those lenses, Sigma, Tamron, Zeiss, and Samyang all provide many of those options save for the super telephotos and the tilt-shift lenses which are not likely to be AF anyway."
