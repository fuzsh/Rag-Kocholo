Still, the above-mentioned lens right now being auctioned on the German branch of ebay is quite unknown to me. Out of plain curiosity, anybody encountered this lens before?\n\n<p>\n\nGreetings Karl Johan\n\nI've never heard of it, and doubt that it is a F-mount lens. Could be\n\na misprint (for f2.8). Can you provide a pointer (URL)?\n\nI remember reading that Nikon once made a \"Ultra Micro\" MF lens that\n\nmagnifies down to 10X, and has the highest central image resolution\n\never acheived with commercially available camera lens. But I can't\n\nremeber its focal length or aperture. It was for some special\n\nindustrial camera. I also don't remember if it had F mount.\n\n....yes, that is the lens I saw. Apparently the seller has no idea\n\neither. Would be fun to know, though. I tried to contact the lone\n\nbidder, but that was not possible on ebay.de\n\n<p>\n\nKarl Johan\n\nThe following was posted on the Nikon MF onelist:\n\n\"\n\n<p>\n\n\"Das Nikon-Handbuch\" by Peter Braczko, 2nd edition\n\n1999, includes a list of Micro- and Ultra-Micro-Nikkors, designed for\n\nindustrial\n\npurposes, e.g. semiconductor chip production. It\n\nalso includes a picture of an Ultra-Micro-Nikkor 1:2/55 mm in a\n\nwooden box. According\n\nto Braczko, this lens was introduced in 1965 and is\n\nnot designed to support general photography, any adaption to 35 mm\n\ncameras is\n\ndifficult.\n\n<p>\n\nTo do macro photography with a bellows, Nikon\n\nmanufactures a series of \"Macro-Nikkors\". Braczko lists 4 Macro\n\nNikkors: 2.8/19 mm,\n\n4.5/35 mm, 4.5/65 mm, 6.3/120 mm.\n\n<p>\n\n\"Das Nikon Handbuch\" is published in German language\n\nby Wittig Fachbuchverlag, Chemnitzer Stra_e 10, 41836 H|ckelhoven,\n\nGermany.\n\nAs i know, an English translation of the current\n\n2nd edition is on the way.\n\n<p>\n\nBest regards\n\nUwe\n\nHello my name is Bill Baker\n\n<p>\n\nat the company I work for we use this lens, for vision inspection on\n\ncomputer chips. I found your article while looking to purchase\n\nanother one actually...as for as commercial use im not sure how it is\n\nused...as far as I know its mainly for inspection purposes...\n\n<p>\n\nnot sure if this info helps but at least you know a little more about\n\nit. It checks the parts for markings, pin location,\n\nCoplinarity...stuff like that...for what we use it for it is a very\n\ngood lens.\n\n<p>\n\nLater,\n\n<p>\n\nBill Baker"
