        "text": "Cosina Company, Ltd. of Nagano, Japan is a Japanese camera and lens manufactuer.\n\nDescription\n\nCosina Company, Ltd. (株式会社コシナ or Kabushiki-gaisha Koshina) is a Japanese camera and lens manufactuer. The company was founded by Mr. B. Kobayashi in 1959 as a lens factory under the name Nikō (or Nikoh).[1] Though the company has produced cameras and lenses under its own name, it is better known for making equipment for resale under other company's brand names. Cosina has manufactured camera bodies for many well-known camera brands, including Canon, Contax, Nikon, Revue, Olympus, Vivitar, and Yashica. Cosina also manufactures the modern Voigtländer Bessa line of cameras and optics, along with the newly revived Zeiss Ikon rangefinder camera and lenses.\n\nCosina has a long history of manufacturing optical glass and is currently capable of producing glass and plastic aspheric lenses. Their factory maintains a glass furance that is heated to 1300 C, running 24 hours a day. All glass produced by Cosina today is lead-free eco-glass. Their current glass polishing technology is able to achieve sub-micron precision. They also have vacuum-deposition optical coating capabilities that are certified to meet Carl Zeiss lens standards.[1]\n\nIn Germany, a lot of Cosina cameras and lenses were marketed by Photo Porst, for many years Germany's biggest photo retailer and mailorder house under their house brand name Porst.\n\nOne of Cosina's more interesting camera designs was the E1 Solar, introduced in 1994. The E1, a 35mm film SLR, is powered by rechargeable batteries charged by a small solar panel atop the camera prism housing.\n\nA recent Cosina-branded product was the SW-107, identical to the (silver) Bessa L except for a different top plate, made at the beginning of the Cosina Voigtländer era for areas where Cosina was not authorized to market the Voigtländer trademark. The 107 is hard to find now.\n\nIn 2005 Zeiss and Cosina announced a partnership whereby Cosina would manufacture the new Zeiss Ikon RF camera and most of the accompanying M mount lenses.\n\n126 Film\n\nCosina Instant Matic N-284 (the company's first complete camera)\n\n35mm SLR\n\nK mount\n\nCosina C1\n\nCosina C1s\n\nCosina C2\n\nCosina C3\n\nCosina CS-1 (1978)\n\nCosina CS-2\n\nCosina CS-3\n\nCosina CT-1\n\nCosina CT-1A\n\nCosina CT1G (1982)\n\nCosina CT1 Super (1983)\n\nCosina CT1EX\n\nCosina CT-2\n\nCosina CT-3\n\nCosina CT-4\n\nCosina CT-7 (Computer CT 7)\n\nCosina CT-7D\n\nCosina CT9 (1986)\n\nCosina CT-10\n\nCosina CT-20\n\nCosina E1 Solar\n\nCosina PM-1\n\nM42\n\nCosina 1000S\n\nCosina 4000S\n\nCosina CSL\n\nCosina CSM\n\nCosina CSR (Vivitar XC-2)\n\nCosina Hi-Lite\n\nCosina Hi-Lite 202\n\nCosina Hi-Lite 205\n\nCosina Hi-Lite 402\n\nCosina Hi-Lite 405\n\nCosina Hi-Lite DL\n\nCosina Hi-Lite DLR\n\nCosina Hi-Lite HDL\n\nCosina Hi-Lite EC\n\nCosina Hi-Lite EC II\n\nCosina Hi-Lite ECL\n\nCosina SLR\n\nArgus/Cosina STL 1000[2] (but note Argus STL 1000)\n\n35mm compact\n\nCosina 35 (rangefinder, same as Vivitar 35EE)\n\nCosina 35 Compact E (Same as the the Porst 135 S, similar to Voigtlander VF 135.
