        "text": "Using a smaller aperture like f/11 or f/16 should get you enough depth of field to get both temples in focus. Put your camera in \"A\" mode (aperture priority) to select the desired aperture. You will need lots of light or a tripod because small apertures mean longer shutter speeds.\n\nYou will need about 6 inches depth of field to get both temples in focus.\n\nYou can use a depth of field calculator to see what actual settings work for your camera and lens.\n\n55mm at f/16 at 36 inches will give you 6.6 inches depth of field.\n\nDOF Calculator\n\na good manual recipe - google depth of field for aps-c sensor - like http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html - choose nikon d3200 - has the same size sensor, use a tripod, choose an aperture and focus distance then I suggest i.e. F8, in this case have object distance at least 120cm or 4ft at focal length of 55mm - or choose lower focal length and you can get closer - then choose any focus point within the depth of field that covers whole glasses or both texts. Try different focal lengths, apertures and object distances to frame it - if needed crop in lightroom or photoshop\n\nIn addition to Mike Sowsun's answer which I recommend, you need to be sure of where you focus. The \"green box\" in your question suggests an automatic mode, which can be problematic in product photography. I would use a central point focus, and aim for something about 1/3 of the way from the closest important point to the furthest (when I say important, the ear ends of the arms can go out of focus a little with no detriment, it's a matter of style). You can either lock the focus and pan the camera, or crop later to get the framing you want (unless you're putting it ona poster, you'll have resolution to spare so you can afford to crop, which also allows you to back away a little and increase your DOF.\n\nLots of light is a generally good idea because you don't want deep shadows, I would use a tripod (or even a rolled up coat on a desk) as well to steady the camera."
