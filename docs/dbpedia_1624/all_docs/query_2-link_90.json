        "text": "Skip to translations\n\nWHY NETFLIX HAS AN APPROVED CAMERA LIST\n\nTo help creatives produce their best work and create compelling visual experiences for our audience, Netflix requires 90% of a program’s final total runtime to be captured on approved cameras using the following capture requirements. For nonfiction content, this threshold may be more flexible.\n\nWe collaborate extensively with the creative community, camera manufacturers, and globally recognized experts to approve cameras that support reliable and flexible production workflows. Approved cameras have been evaluated by Netflix technologists to ensure they meet image capture benchmarks for dynamic range, color accuracy, detail rendition, signal to noise ratio, resolution, and key workflow requirements. These evaluations help our partners know they’re using the best and most appropriate capture technology when telling their stories.\n\nFor more on why Netflix has an approved camera list see \"Approved Cameras - Behind the Scenes.\"\n\nThis article also provides best practices in an effort to help productions avoid common image capture pitfalls or errors.\n\nWe understand that limited use of non-approved cameras may be necessary in certain situations. Netflix is available to navigate those specific image capture decisions. Please reach out to your Netflix point of contact with any questions or concerns specific to your production. For information on using Non-Approved Cameras see: Non-Approved Cameras: Recommended Settings & Best Practices.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCAPTURE REQUIREMENTS\n\nAPPROVED CAMERAS\n\nIMAGE CAPTURE BEST PRACTICES\n\nCAPTURE REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn order to meet image capture standards required by Netflix, the following capture attributes must be adhered to.\n\nNote: Not all cameras that meet these capture requirements are approved. These requirements are the minimum specifications necessary for a camera system to be considered for approval. Other attributes must be taken into account such as dynamic range, form factor, stability, workflow compatibility, and more.\n\nAPPROVED CAMERAS\n\nCameras that have been approved for Netflix productions are listed below. We will continue to maintain and update this list as new camera systems become available and are evaluated by our technologists.\n\nARRI\n\nCanon\n\nPanasonic\n\nRED\n\nPanavision\n\nSony\n\nBlackmagic\n\nIMAGE CAPTURE BEST PRACTICES\n\nWhile not required for Netflix productions, the following best practices will help productions avoid common pitfalls and workflow errors that can lead to added costs, lost time, or creative compromises.\n\nBlack Balancing / Black Shading\n\nBlack balancing, sometimes referred to as black shading, of a camera’s sensor should be performed regularly in accordance with manufacturer provided guidance. For optimal results, please allow the camera to reach its normal operating temperature prior to performing the sensor calibration. The black balancing/shading procedure defines an imaging system’s proper black level given its current operating state and may reduce the visibility of misbehaving pixels while operating under fluctuating temperature ranges. To ensure this process is performed correctly, please refer to the instructions in your camera’s operating manual.\n\nFraming Charts\n\nTo ensure on-set framing meets the creative and technical needs of your production, a framing chart should be shot before principal photography begins and processed through the dailies, editorial, and VFX pipelines.\n\nFor Best Practices involving Framing Charts and Dailies Workflows see:\n\nFraming Charts Best Practices\n\nDailies: Best Practices\n\nChoosing an Aspect Ratio\n\nChoosing an aspect ratio for the active image area of your production is a creative decision; however, aspect ratio can affect your workflow. “Aspect Ratio - An Overview” from our foundational video series demonstrates how aspect ratios may be used for story purposes and outlines technical considerations.\n\nWe’ve also designed a Framing & Working Resolution Calculator which can determine if your capture and framing method is Netflix approved.\n\nAspect ratio choices should be discussed with Netflix for approval.\n\nAnamorphic Lenses\n\nWhen using anamorphic lenses, extra resolution may be required for capture. Camera selection should take this additional need into account. Cameras that meet this resolution requirement and are approved for anamorphic capture are designated in the list above. If you are unsure if your desired camera system has the necessary resolution or have questions about anamorphic capture, Netflix is here to help. Please contact your Netflix project lead to discuss implications or concerns.\n\nColor Management\n\nIn order to ensure compatibility with your project’s color pipeline, productions should test each camera format’s color space transformation into the working color space. “The Benefits of Color Management” from our foundational video series explains why color management is important to Netflix and provides an introduction to the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES).\n\nTo explore color management further see: \"What is Color Management?\"\n\nSpanned Clips\n\nRecording single takes across multiple camera cards, also known as “spanning clips,” should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Spanning clips across camera cards increases the likelihood of downstream workflow issues.\n\nFilm Capture\n\nFor productions seeking to shoot any photochemical film, please contact your relevant Netflix project lead.\n\nExternal Recorders\n\nIn some instances, productions may require the use of approved cameras with external recorders. The recording format should be in line with minimum requirements outlined at the head of this document, and should be discussed with your Netflix point of contact.\n\nTRANSLATIONS\n\nالعربية\n\nDeutsch‬\n\nEspañol (España)\n\nEspañol (Latinoamérica)\n\nFrançais\n\nItaliano\n\n한국어\n\nPolski\n\nPortuguês\n\nрусский\n\nไทย\n\n繁體中文\n\nTürkçe\n\nIndonesian\n\nChange Log:\n\n2022-12-01\n\nSony FR7 added.\n\n2022-08-01\n\nSony FX3 & Sony HDC-F5500 added.\n\n2022-06-27\n\nUpdated introduction & best practices content.\n\n2022-04-19\n\nRed V-Raptor 8K VV added.\n\n2022-04-17\n\nSony Venice 2 6K added.\n\n2022-03-21\n\nSony Venice 2 8k added.\n\n2022-01-04\n\nPanasonic BS1H added.\n\n2022-01-04\n\nAspect Ratio foundational video added.\n\n2021-04-23\n\nSony HDC-4300 removed\n\n2021-01-29\n\nLanguage changed around aspect ratios to clarify that choice of aspect ratio is not a technical decision but a creative one.
