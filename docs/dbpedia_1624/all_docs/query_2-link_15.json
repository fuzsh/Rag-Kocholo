        "text": "In spring of 2022 my 18-month old 600mm f/4E lens had its autofocus module fail and I had to wait 4 months for Nikon USA to get the part in stock and do the repair. It was evident that this failure was relatively common for them to have no spare parts in stock, and that they were doing fewer production runs of the parts for the lens. I had the same module fail on my 70-200mm f/2.8E lens and Nikon as with the 600mm f/4 refused to acknowledge that this was a manufacturing defect as they had in the past with other Nikon lenses and cameras I have owned.\n\nThis should be a consideration when buying any f-mount lens or camera that it may not be repairable in the future as the parts needed will not be available.\n\nIn spring of 2022 my 18-month old 600mm f/4E lens had its autofocus module fail and I had to wait 4 months for Nikon USA to get the part in stock and do the repair.

I had the same module fail on my 70-200mm f/2.8E lens and Nikon as with the 600mm f/4 refused to acknowledge that this was a manufacturing defect as they had in the past with other Nikon lenses and cameras I have owned.\n\nThis should be a consideration when buying any f-mount lens or camera that it may not be repairable in the future as the parts needed will not be available.\n\nI asking about parts for bodies and lenses in nikon service center. They told me - service support for F-mount will be available many years. Especially the last generation DSLR (D5, D6, D500, D850, D780) and lenses with sign \"E\" (electromagnetic diaphragme).\n\nThank you Fred for this update. The day we knew was coming is here. I accelerated the purchase of a 19mm f/4 PC lens last summer because I wasn't sure how much longer Nikon would make them.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the impact on the F-mount used market. Might be negative given fewer repair parts or lower priority by Nikon to do F-mount repairs (per Carlson's comment above), or for certain popular F-mount lenses, it may boost prices as supply vs demand creates a bump.\n\nThe prices of exotics will remain the same as now, maybe a little bump for the likes of the 200/2. The rest of the prices will crater. It's not just the transition to ML, Nikon sells 10% of the number of bodies they sold 15 years ago. There will forever be an oversupply of common F mount lenses.\n\nI think we all knew this was coming. Some of the F-mount designs have been around a long time and there are Z-mount alternatives. The F-mount versions were falling further and further behind. Nikon would much rather sell out than produce too long and have to discount deeply.\n\nI think we will see some real bargains in F-mount gear. If the new lenses are discounted, it pushes down the price for used gear. We've seen the prices for used long lenses fall a great deal. Some of these lenses work very well on Z camera bodies.\n\nThis also suggests that Nikon will shift production into more Z lenses. Z lenses only took up a fraction of capacity two years ago, but today, it's got to be over 90% anyway. Discontinuing production of F-mount lenses, parts production, and reducing inventory makes a lot of sense.\n\nAgree completely but Nikon stated shortly after the Z9 release and shipped, they stated they were done with F mount bodies and lenses. A bit surprising it took them basically 2 years to make it official.\n\nAnother vacuous NR post\n\nWhere's the official statement from Nikon?\n\nNR has tripped up badly recently eg we are still waiting for the Z9 Firmware update that NR predicted for December 2023 (?)\n\nThe day is nigh for the Z to replace F entirely - at least sales of new ILCs and new lenses made by Nikon. But DSLRs are still shipping, and selling - according to CIPA data. Europe is the largest market. As of mid 2023, approx 1 DSLR was sold for every 3.4 MILCs\n\nThe Latest CIPA Reports Show That DSLRs Aren't Dead\n\nWhile DSLR sales have dropped percentage-wise compared to last year, there are still many being sold, according to the latest CIPA report.\n\nDSLR camera shipments worldwide 2022 | Statista\n\nThe number of digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera shipments worldwide has been on a downhill ride since 2012.\n\nValue of MILC vs DSLR sales is the important differentiator, which must be shaping Nikon's strategy, especially as one can predict more MILC buyers also buy new Z lenses versus the purchaser upgrading to a new DSLR.\n\nOne of the first official explanations/statement by Nikon was nearly 4 years ago - appended quote. One of the shorter answers in the same dpr interview portends interesting implications. The manufacturing techniques Nikon has built for its Z mount lenses are different from the F System. It follows Nikon may well have decided not to update its F Mount production line(s), or perhaps only modify specific procedures for priority F Nikkors.\n\nFour years later (actually six since 2018), Nikon is still building its Z System, as OhShita explained recently in a PetaPixel interview earlier this week. This is going to be a few years ahead. Only then, can expect Nikon will cut clean from its F System, and assume \"all DSLR customers will [ultimately] be satisfied by the features provided by mirrorless, and will shift to the Z system.\"\n\nLol I'm not about to go searching for 2 year old news. It was from an interview of some Nikon exec that said they were concentrating on mirrorless and that no new R&D would happen in DSLR gear. That they were moving on from DSLRs and the F mount.\n\nDo you have a sense of the timeframe over which you’ll transition customers away from DSLR, eventually?​\n\nWe haven’t finalized our plan yet. At this time I can say that we will prioritize both DSLR and mirrorless. We also want to complete our Z system: that’s the first priority. At a certain point, we hope that all DSLR customers will [ultimately] be satisfied by the features provided by mirrorless, and will shift to the Z system. That’s the goal. But until then, we will continue to develop DSLRs.\n\nI'm not sure I completely buy the rumor. I suspect there is some confusion even internally and the answer is more nuanced. Nikon is not going to prematurely announce broad decisions such as discontinuing production of F-mount lenses in general.\n\nNikon has previously indicated they will discontinue sales of entry level products. The entry level D3500 and D5500 products and related lenses clearly fall into that category. Their previously communicated timeframe is to end all sales of those products by 2025 (they were not specific about when in 2025). This implies discontinuing a wide range of activities to support entry level consumer products. For example, sales through big box retailers require a lot of support in the form of marketing, staff, and advertising. That's not very scalable - a 50% decline in sales does not translate to a 50% drop in costs - so at lower levels it is less and less profitable.\n\nOn the other hand, Nikon is planning to significantly grow sales to enthusiasts and professionals. The DSLR and F-mount lenses has some value in this segment. Some companies own larger numbers of DSLR cameras and F-mount lenses. It's not always financially practical for them to replace all gear and go to mirrorless at once. If a core lens like a 24-70 f/2.8 or 70-200 f/2.8 fails and needs replacement, they need to be able to buy one. The same may be true for camera bodies - they may have proprietary reasons for needing certain camera models. Government contracts usually require product certification, and certifying a new camera is expensive and can take time. I don't think Nikon will be discontinuing production of ALL F-mount lenses - just some of them based on supply and demand.\n\nI do see limited need for designing new lenses. F-mount designs can be easily adapted to Z-mount, but not the other way around. With F-mount adaptation, you just need a spacer on the back end and a Z-mount that communicates. Going the other way, you might need a negative spacer. Some of the long lenses are much more easily modified because they have a spacer type design already in place - and it could be removed. But even then, it's not a simple feat.\n\nThe end of F-mount lenses by Nikon does not mean the end of F-mount lenses. You still have designs from Sigma, Tamron and others that will be produced and can be reasonably modified for F-mount.\n\nOne other lingering issue for the future of DSLR cameras is the EU requirement for USB-C charging. I'm not sure how that applies to existing models such as the D850 and D6, but Thom Hogan points out the potential issue. This is an EU issue today, so those cameras could be sold in the US and turn up as gray market models in other countries. There is also potential for new battery designs that support USB-C charging and some of those designs already exist."
