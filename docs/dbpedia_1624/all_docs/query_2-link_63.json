        "text": "It's no secret that many sensors for Nikon cameras Designed and manufactured by Sony. Nikon simply buys ready-made sensor chips from Sony.\n\nNikon is also involved in creating sensors for its cameras, but mostly the company is only designing its own sensors, and it’s hard to say exactly where they are produced. Most likely, the companies themselves were engaged in the manufacture / refinement of the sensors. Renesas (presumably all sensors that start with 'NC'), Sony, Matsushita (actually the same Panasonic) and towerjazz.\n\nSeveral cameras are made on production sensors Toshiba. After Sony has absorbed Toshiba, Toshiba is indicated, and Sony is shown in brackets.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that the development of the unusual JFET-LBCAST sensor for cameras Nikon D2HThe D2Hs is wholly owned by Nikon. Therefore, it is not necessary to unequivocally state that Nikon does nothing herself :).\n\nThe table below indicates who developed / manufactured the sensor.\n\nAttention: the data in the label may not correspond to reality, since it is very difficult to find the version of the sensor that is used in a particular camera. I tried to make the most correct / true table, if I made a mistake somewhere, please write this in the comments and be sure to offer a confirmation link.\n\nsensor Camera Models Nikon NC81338L (CMOS) D3, D700 (the sensors themselves from Matsushita?) Nikon NC81361A (CMOS) D3s (the sensor itself from Matsushita?) Nikon NC81362A (CMOS) D3100 Nikon NC81369R (CMOS) D3200 Nikon NC81366W (CMOS) D4, D4s, Df Nikon JFET-LBCAST (LBCAST) D2h, D2hs Sony IMX-007-AQ (CMOS) D2x, D2xs Sony IMX-071 (CMOS) D7000, D5100 Sony IMX-094-AQP (CMOS) D800,D800E, D810,D810a Sony IMX-021-BQR (CMOS) D300 Sony IMX-038-BQL (CMOS) D90, D5000, D300s (?) Sony IMX-128- (L) -AQP (CMOS) D600, D610, D750 Sony IMX-028 (CMOS) D3x Sony ICX-453-AQ (CCD) D40, D50, D70, D70s Sony ICX-493-AQA (CCD) D40x, D60, D80, D3000 Sony ICX-483-AQA (CCD) D200 Sony ICX-413-AQ (CCD) D100 Sony IMX-193-AQK (CMOS) D7200 (?), D5300, D5500, D5600, D3300, D3400, D3500 Sony (model name unknown) (CCD) D1, D1h Sony (model name unknown) (special 'rectangular' CCD) D1x Toshiba HEZ1 TOS-5105 (CMOS) D5200, D7100 Toshiba (Sony) T4K54 (CMOS) D5, D6 (?) Sony IMX-321 (CMOS) D500, D7500 Sony IMX-309-AQJ (backside illumination CMOS) D850 (sensor itself from Towerjazz?) Sony IMX-309-BQJ (backside illumination CMOS) Nikon Z7, Z7 II (similar to IMX-309-AQJ) Sony Nikon Z6, Z6 II, Z5 (similar to IMX-128) Sony? (stacked backside-illuminated CMOS) Nikon z9 Sony? (similar to IMX-321) Nikon z50, Zfc\n\nI want to note that the sensor itself is the basis for a high-quality image, but at the hardware level there are many more important parts, such as the ADC width, processor capabilities and much more, that form the final image.\n\nMy experience\n\nPersonally, I absolutely do not care what is in the camera, as long as it works well and performs the necessary tasks. I absolutely do not care who or where these or those sensors are made. The plate I made was created more for the sake of interest. Of course, I would like Nikon to make its own sensors, since this is the heart of a modern camera, and Nikon knows the point in quality things. And what will happen if Sony stops supplying / selling its sensors for Nikon?\n\nI also want to note that Sony manufactures / sells its sensors not only for Nikon, but also manufactures cameras based on its sensors, and many Pentax cameras (and with it Samsung) also use Sony sensors.\n\nLeave your thoughts on the sensitive topic of sensors in the comments.\n\nComments on this post do not require registration.
