        "text": "Nikon Z lenses\n\nSince Nikon launched the Z system in 2018, they’ve done an exemplary job of filling out the lens selection for these capable mirrorless cameras. The Nikon mirrorless lenses are probably the most exciting Nikon professional camera lenses right now, and the range now includes all the standard focal lengths used by professionals, such as the Nikon Z 70-200mm f/2.8 VR S Lens.\n\nWhile the range was initially all full-frame, Nikon has recently introduced a Z camera with a smaller “DX-format” APS-C sensor – the Nikon Z50 – and it has lenses to match, such as the Nikon Z 50-250mm f4.5-6.3 DX VR Lens.\n\nNikon F lenses\n\nNikon’s range of digital SLR lenses to fit Nikon F-mount is huge and encompassses everything a photographer could conceivably want. It includes both FX-format lenses for full-frame DSLRs, and DX-format lenses for more affordable, beginner-oriented DX-format DSLRs. Bear in mind that Nikon FX lenses can still be used on DX format camera; they will just have an increase in effective focal length by a factor of about 1.5x (so a 24mm lens will behave roughly like a 35mm lens).\n\nYou can also use DX lenses on FX cameras – which is useful if you’ve just upgraded after starting on the smaller-sensor cameras. The DSLR will automatically detect the lens being used and activate crop mode to avoid vignetting.\n\nDon’t worry if this is all a bit technical – the upshot is that any Nikon DSLR lenses will work on any Nikon DSLR!\n\nPrimes and zooms\n\nYou’ll hear these terms a lot when shopping for lenses. The difference is simple – prime lenses have a single fixed focal length, and zoom lenses have a focal range they can zoom through.\n\nWith this in mind, it might seem like zoom lenses are the obvious choice. However, prime lenses have one thing going for – the fact that they don’t need to incorporate a zoom mechanism means they can be much sharper, with a better optical construction. If you need a versatile lens that’s great in lots of different situations, a zoom is better. However, if you’re after image quality above all else, then consider getting a prime lens.\n\nWide-angle lenses\n\nThe term “wide-angle” tends to refer to lenses with a focal length or focal range of anything less than about 35mm. These expansive lenses allow you to fit a great deal in the frame, and the more extreme wide-angles will provide an exaggerated perspective that makes them great for leading lines. The Nikon 16-35mm f4 G AF-S ED VR Lens is a good example of a wide-angle zoom.\n\nStandard lenses\n\nStandard lenses cover a focal length of about 50mm, with some leeway on either side. This is a perspective roughly equivalent to that of the human eye, and so is good for producing naturalistic images with a realistic feel. Many starter kit lenses will cover a standard focal length – the Nikon 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 G AF-P DX VR Lens is a typical example – and it’s a great place to start if you’re learning photography.\n\nTelephoto lenses\n\nTelephoto lenses have a longer focal length. Short telephotos of around 85mm are often used for portraits as they provide a flattering, narrowed perspective of people’s faces, while longer telephotos tend to be used for wildlife and sports shooting where it’s not possible to get close to subjects. Telephoto lenses tend to be larger, so you may need to consider a bigger camera bag.\n\nLenses like the Nikon 200-500mm f5.6E ED VR AF-S can bring extremely distant subjects into sharp focus, while many professionals rely on the kind of focal range provided by lenses like the Nikon 70-300mm f4.5-5.6E ED VR AF-P."
