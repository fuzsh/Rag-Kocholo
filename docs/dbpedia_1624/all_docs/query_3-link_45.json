        "text": "For over 100 years, Nikon has produced some of the best cameras on the market, well-loved by professional photographers and amateurs alike. Nikon is a market leader, making some of the best mirrorless cameras and some of the best DSLR cameras available to buy today. Nikon has some of the best models in both categories, whether you're looking at DSLR vs mirrorless cameras or know exactly what you're looking for.\n\nOur expert reviewers have tested these cameras themselves, giving their honest reviews of the pros and cons of each model. We've also included a 'what to look for' section below to help you gain a more detailed understanding of what makes a good Nikon camera.\n\nWe've considered a range of budgets and different types of cameras to help you find your perfect Nikon match. From entry-level models to the best cameras suited to professional use, we've tested DSLRs, mirrorless, compact and larger cameras to help you make an informed decision.\n\nIf you need something compact and lightweight, a mirrorless camera might be the right choice for you. They are also great for videographers, with some of them boasting technology that means you can shoot video up to 120FPS in 4K and even benefit from in-body image stabilization\n\nAlternatively, a heavier DSLR gives you the option to change between lenses and boasts fantastic shooting quality. If you're not quite sold on Nikon yet, be sure to check out the best cameras for astrophotography, best cameras for photo and video and camera deals.\n\nThe quick list\n\nSkim through our top picks below, or scroll down to see our full reviews of each product.\n\nThe best Nikon cameras we recommend in 2024\n\nBest overall\n\nCurrently sitting at the top of our overall best cameras guide, the Nikon Z8 is easily crowned the best Nikon camera as well. It combines the very best aspects of the Nikon D850 and the flagship Nikon Z9 models to create a camera with unrivaled versatility and performance across all fields of photography. Whether you're a professional or an enthusiastic amateur, this camera is an absolute treat to use and offers stunning results.\n\nThe 45.7MP sensor delivers highly detailed still images and 8K video. It offers RAW images and captures a wide variety of video codecs such as N-Log, ProRes Raw HQ and more, making it an excellent choice for videographers. There's also an unbelievable burst shooting rate of 120FPS for sport and action photographers, although you will sacrifice some image quality when shooting at this blistering speed.\n\nThe autofocus is fast and reliable, detecting human and animal subjects even in darker conditions. Enabling Starlight View will drop the detection range right down to -9EV. This, combined with a night vision mode that dims the rear screen and electronic viewfinder and uses only red pixels to preserve your night vision, makes it a fantastic camera for astrophotography, too.\n\nWith the Nikon Z8, you'll get all this for around $1500 less than their flagship Z9 model, which really clinches the deal for us. It's still pricey and primarily aimed at professionals, but if your budget can stretch to it, we think any photographer would be thrilled with this camera.\n\nRead our full Nikon Z8 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest professional mirrorless\n\nThe Nikon Z9 is Nikon's flagship mirrorless camera, outstripping every other Nikon camera's spec sheets. Outstanding, fast autofocus is powered by deep-learning artificial intelligence that cleverly tracks subjects from people, animals, and vehicles, focusing on the eyes of living subjects even when framed upside down.\n\nThis is a mirrorless camera designed for professionals, but it would be equally welcome in the hands of an enthusiast, should they be able to afford it. We'd give it five stars, but it's missing half a star as it'll be out of the price range of some.\n\nA blisteringly fast 120FPS electronic stills capture, 8K30p video, and detailed 'real-live' electronic viewfinder, which is the brightest in the world (at 3000-nit), show that Nikon isn't messing around here. It also has dual CF Express Type B card slots for twice the speed of Type A and ultra-reliability with dual card backup.\n\nYou'll be spoiled by the numerous functions the Z9 offers. As a still image shooter, you can customize almost every aspect of the process, and have the ability to use this body just as easily in landscape or portrait mode. The stand-out options are the vast array of options on the camera body itself.\n\nRead our Nikon Z9 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest under $3000\n\nSitting nearly two-fifths cheaper than the Nikon Z9, this camera has much of the capability without the enormous price tag, though it is still a sizeable investment.\n\nIn our Nikon Z7 II review our verdict after putting it through its paces is that it offers the perfect balance of speed and precision and can master most styles of photography.\n\nIt boasts great dynamic range and an expandable ISO that boosts up to 102,400 and is stabilized by a five-axis in-body image stabilization technology that can steady shots by up to five stops.\n\n10FPS stills shooting at maximum resolution may not sound ground-breaking, but when you consider it's capturing a huge 45.7MP, 14bit photos, it's pretty eye-watering. A dual card slot makes the 7 II compatible with XQD (or super fast CF Express) and SD/SDHC/SDXC (up to UHS-II) cards for ultimate flexibility. 4K UHD video shoots smooth 60FPS but can go as high as 120FPS when dropped down to full HD resolution for slow-motion effects.\n\nThe exposure preview on the Z7 II is fantastic, probably the best of all the cameras we’ve used. Composing scenes on any camera in low light is difficult because less light means a darker view, making it more difficult to level horizons and ensure focus is where it needs to be. However, with the Z7 II there’s hardly any image noise when viewing on the rear screen or EVF, horizons are clearly visible and so are stars, making it easy to compose scenes and zoom in on stars to manually focus.\n\nRead our Nikon Z7 II review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest classic style\n\nIf you're looking for a stylish camera that's still capable of keeping up with modern technological developments, then look no further than the Nikon Zf. This classic-looking camera comes with an array of tactile metal dials reminiscent of film SLR but combines this with the impressive speed and performance you'd expect from a quality mirrorless camera.\n\nThe dials aren't there for show; they are efficient. The more you use them, the less you have to consciously think about what you're doing and you'll quickly find that adjusting your commonly used settings becomes second nature, speeding up your workflow. We like that there is no need to navigate different menus for every shot you take.\n\nIt contains the same flagship processing engine as the Nikon Z8 and Z9 models, alongside an extremely effective autofocus system with low-light sensitivity that drops down as low as -10EV. To put that into perspective, it's the lowest of the whole Nikon Z series line, and it makes shooting in low light an absolute breeze.\n\nIt also benefits from a fully articulated touchscreen, and while the 24.5MP sensor may be nothing to shout home about, we think that this camera offers great specs for the price that sits around the $2000 mark.\n\nRead our full Nikon Zf review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest value for money\n\nThe Nikon Z6 is identical to the Nikon Z7 on the outside but lacks a few of the higher-end features found in its bigger brother. The resolution is nearly halved at 24.5MP, which sounds drastic, but in reality, is perfectly fine for most shooters. In fact, that drop in resolution makes it more suited to astrophotography due to the lower propensity for high ISO image noise. That is one of the reasons that after our Nikon Z6 review, we placed it in our best cameras for astrophotography guide.\n\nFull frame, it can capture stills at 14FPS, four times faster than the Z7, and an enhanced buffer means up to 200 consecutive JPEG images (or 124 12-bit uncompressed raw images) in one burst, likely more than most owners will ever need.\n\nFlexible video frame rate recording and Raw file output via HDMI (including ProRes RAW) at 4K30p UHD means it's perfect for the hybrid shooter or filmmaker, even able to be powered through USB-C by an external power source (and charge the battery, too) for longer filming sessions.\n\nThe Z6 has already had an upgrade in the form of the Nikon Z6 II which feels a little more refined in the hand, has an improved image processor and features 4K video at 60FPS. If those are things that are important to you, have a read of our Nikon Z6 II review. We haven't included it on this list because we think the Z6 is better value for money and the upgrades don't necessarily justify the jump in price.\n\nRead our Nikon Z6 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for casual users\n\nAs well as its attractive looks, the Nikon Z fc is an easy-to-use mirrorless camera for casual use, especially for disciplines like travel and street photography, where you want something small but capable. It has a small form factor so it can be easily transported in your day bag or jacket pocket.\n\nThe design of this timeless model is essentially based on Nikon's FM2, first sold in 1982, but it benefits from modern technology, improved dial positioning and more automation.\n\nIn our Nikon Z fc review, we found that it is highly capable of tracking faces and movement, and the images are sharp with an impressive dynamic range. The camera can also take a shot within less than one second of being started up. Again, it supports the spontaneous moments you'll want to capture in street and travel photos.\n\nThis isn't the camera for you if you want to shoot sports or action as the continuous burst mode isn't the best — you could lose the shot you wanted while the camera is buffering.\n\nIn our review, the camera performed better in the noise department than we had expected. We could push it up to ISO 12,800 before we began to see any noticeable noise — great if you're looking to take compelling images after dusk.\n\nRead our Nikon Z fc camera review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest full-frame DSLR\n\nDespite being a few years old now, the D850 is so competitively priced and with such a comprehensive set of specs that it should appeal to just about anyone, whether taking photography seriously for the first time or a seasoned pro. It is no surprise it is B&H Photo's number one seller. It also sits at the top of our best cameras for astrophotography buying guide.\n\nA full-frame DSLR, it benefits from 45.7MP stills, albeit at a lagging 9FPS mechanical (with the battery grip) compared to the Z9’s electronic 120FPS, and captures 4K30p UHD video uncropped. It can continuously shoot at 9FPS for up to 51 uncompressed 14-bit raw files.\n\nThe backlit illuminated buttons and a tilting touchscreen make it easy to use the D850 in the dark without having to fumble around with a torch. It is compatible with almost every F-mount lens that Nikon has produced, so you have a wide variety of lenses that you can use with this camera.\n\nIn our Nikon D850 review, we loved the wide, bright optical viewfinder which made looking into the scene to compose the shot a real treat. It has 153 AF points (99 cross-type) in view. An in-built viewfinder cover stops extraneous light leaking through the viewfinder and onto the image sensor during longer exposures — a must for low light or astrophotography.\n\nRead our Nikon D850 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for low light\n\nThis is probably the ideal choice for those seeking a full-frame Nikon DSLR but who don't want to go crazy on price. An evolution from the fantastic D750 body, this DSLR builds on its legacy and improves in several areas.\n\nIn our Nikon D780 review, we found a chunky grip feels good in the hand, and a tilting 3.2-inch rear screen provides a nice, bright view when not opting for the optical 0.7x magnification viewfinder.\n\nThe D780 is a solid hybrid performer. Quick switching from stills to video shooting can be done using the sliding switch surrounding the Live View button. When slipped into movie mode, the rear screen displays appropriate aspect ratio restrictions and brings with it a multitude of appropriate video-related settings, making a great camera for filming as well as snapping pictures.\n\nLike its predecessor, it's a bit of a low light behemoth and handles high ISO noise well on images, with an expanded ISO range of up to 204,800. Though two types of autofocus (one for the viewfinder, the other for the rear screen) means that mirrorless bodies with hybrid AF take the edge in this regard. But for those who like traditional DSLR stylings and handling, the D780 is a brilliant full-frame option.\n\nRead our Nikon D780 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest crop sensor\n\nAt the higher end of Nikon's crop sensor DSLR bodies sits the D7500. Despite a drop in resolution compared with the previous model, the D7200, it actually has improved ISO performance and autofocus sensor in the shape of the 51-point Multi-Cam 3500 II — something we discuss in our Nikon D7500 review.\n\nIt can shoot 4K video which relies on contrast autofocus detections, but switch over to shooting through the viewfinder and you're met with phase-detection autofocus which enhances accuracy even further.\n\nWe found the D7500 to be more than ample for capturing images of stars, the moon, and even the odd galaxy. Most of the time we’d recommend a full-frame camera to capture the finest detail when it comes to astrophotography, as the larger real estate a full-frame image sensor offers to soak up all that starlight, but the D7500 is a solid option too.\n\nKeep up to speed with the action thanks to the 8FPS continuous burst speed capture, or drop it down to continuous low, which shoots between 1-7FPS based on the options set. Lightweight in hand because of its carbon fiber construction, it may not be as sturdy as some of the magnesium alloy bodies, but it still has good weather sealing to protect it from the elements. It features a functional tilting rear screen, making composing at awkward angles a breeze.\n\nRead our Nikon D7500 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest professional DSLR\n\nThe D6 was at the top of the tree for a long time regarding all-round Nikon performance. Aimed at professionals, it's still one of the most expensive Nikon cameras you can buy due to its rugged construction, extreme weather sealing, and hefty DSLR performance. It can shoot up to 14FPS continuously and has an expandable ISO ceiling of over 3.2 million.\n\nIt doesn't have in-body image stabilization like the mirrorless cameras though, so users will have to rely on the vibration reduction in lenses to steady the shots. It has a LAN port for wired connection to PC or FTP server for immediate distribution to clients.\n\nThe D6 is undoubtedly a pro-level camera body, it is even compatible with Kensington locks to keep gear secure when shooting with multiple bodies on location. A comprehensive button layout and quick call-up display make it fast to shoot stills or to capture 4K30p UHD video.\n\nCheck out all the Best DSLR cameras\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for vlogging\n\nAs an APS-C crop sensor DSLR sitting between the D3400 and D7500, you'd be forgiven for thinking it's just another gap-filling camera. Instead, it's one of the only DSLRs Nikon makes that has a vari-angle screen.\n\nBy unfolding and rotating 360 degrees, it's helpful when shooting selfies, filming vlog style or composing in awkward shooting positions. Its 3.2-inch screen is touch sensitive too, which makes it easy to operate and access quick menus. In our Nikon D5600 review, we found that the resolution, picture quality and sharpness of the image on the touchscreen is excellent at all angles, even in bright sunlight.\n\nA better resolution count than its bigger brother, the D7500, it doesn't capture 4K video, but it does shoot Full HD at a smooth 60FPS. It also has an HDMI output and a 3.5mm audio input for external microphones, again making it ideal for vlogging on a budget.\n\nRead our Nikon D5600 review\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest for beginners\n\nAs Nikon's first APS-C mirrorless body the Nikon Z50 had quite a bit of ground to cover in terms of Nikon's step into the mirrorless market. Coming in with 20.9MP stills resolution and 4K30p UHD video recording capability, it's a good all-rounder for beginners and those new to photography.\n\nIts hybrid autofocusing system covers 90% of the frame and works great for low-light shooting since it can autofocus down to -4EV. It captures up to 11FPS on continuous burst mode for speedy snapping of sports and wildlife, and when paired with an appropriate telephoto lens its 1.5x crop gives a longer effective focal length for getting in close to the action.\n\nThere are 20 creative effects in-camera — with an intensity slider to adjust the strength — perfect for adding your own style whether shooting stills or video. While it's compatible with Nikon's Z-mount lenses, only three dedicated DX lenses are available at the time of writing, so keep that in mind when purchasing.\n\nCheck out all the Best beginner cameras\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nBest zoom range\n\nThe Nikon Coolpix P1000 bridge camera has a phenomenal 125x optical zoom which Nikon reports as the world's biggest zoom range. Its effective focal length is 24mm up to 3000mm telephoto. That means taking photos of the craters on the moon is entirely doable from your backyard.\n\nThe camera also features Dual Detect Optical Vibration Reduction stabilization system, which offers up to five stops of steadying, perfect for reducing camera shake when using that incredible zoom. For a compact, it's filled with detail by shooting 16MP stills and 4K UHD video for photographers that want to dabble in both media.\n\nIt has a large 3.2-inch vari-angle screen and an electronic viewfinder with 2.359 dots of detail. It shoots both JPEG and Raw file formats for flexible image editing, and while its ISO range is a little limited compared with DSLR and mirrorless bodies, its maximum of 6400 should be more than enough for most situations.\n\nCheck out all the Best cameras for astrophotography\n\nBack to the top ⤴\n\nThe best Nikon cameras: What to look for\n\nThere are many things to consider when purchasing a Nikon camera. First off, whether you need the option for interchangeable lenses, as their compact cameras have sharp, versatile fixed lenses that offer a wide zoom range for any occasion.\n\nHowever, F-mount DSLRs contain a huge lens heritage, compatible with almost any model, whether you want a classic film lens or the latest and greatest telezoom with all the bells and whistles. Z-mount mirrorless lenses are sharper still and can combine Vibration Reduction technology (should they have it) with in-body stabilization for ultra-smooth stills and video performance, all while keeping a smaller form factor.\n\nIt's best to consider your budget range first, then look at the key specification differences between models in this price bracket. Decide whether you will keep your camera with you at all times, day-to-day and whilst traveling. In this case, look for something lightweight and compact. If you need the very best performance from your camera for professional work, focus on the features, resolution and autofocus instead of form-factor.\n\nHow we test the best Nikon cameras\n\nTo guarantee you're getting honest, up-to-date recommendations on the best Nikon cameras to buy here at Space.com, we review every camera thoroughly to test each product fully. Each camera is reviewed based on many aspects, from its construction and design, to how well it functions as an optical instrument and its performance in the field.\n\nEach camera is carefully tested by either our expert staff or knowledgeable freelance contributors who know their subject areas in depth. This ensures fair reviewing is backed by personal, hands-on experience with each camera and is judged based on its price point, class and destined use. For example, comparing a 60MP full-frame mirrorless camera to a sleek little crop-sensor DSLR wouldn't be appropriate, though each camera might be the best-performing product in its class.\n\nWe look at how easy each camera is to operate, whether it contains the latest up-to-date imaging technology, whether the cameras can shoot high-quality stills photos and high-resolution video, and also suggest if a particular camera would benefit from any additional kit to give you the best viewing experience possible.\n\nWith complete editorial independence, Space.com are here to ensure you get the best buying advice on cameras, whether you should purchase an instrument or not, making our buying guides and reviews reliable and transparent."
