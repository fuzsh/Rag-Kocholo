        "text": "The Sony α7 IV is the best camera for product photography that we've tested and one of the best all-around options for both pros and hobbyists. Its 33-megapixel full-frame sensor can capture incredibly detailed images, and it's a well-rounded camera for those interested in shooting some video on the side. While a fast autofocus system isn't necessary for product photography the same way it is for sports or wildlife photography, this camera has a fool-proof AF system that can reliably nail focus on static objects, so you don't even have to think about it. To top it off, Sony's E mount system includes a wide range of both native and third-party lens options.\n\nHaving said all that, this high-end camera is probably overkill for most amateurs and shop owners. If you don't need advanced video capability or haven't had much experience with photography, the camera's many features and extensive controls will likely feel daunting. If that sounds like you, check out our other top picks below.\n\nIf you and your wallet aren't ready to dive into a high-end full-frame camera like the Sony α7 IV, the Fujifilm X-T5 offers a great mix of features and performance at a slightly lower price point. That's partly due to its smaller APS-C sensor, but don't be fooled—this camera can still capture stunning images. In fact, with a whopping 40.2 megapixels, it has the highest-resolution APS-C sensor on the market, meaning you'll get incredibly crisp and detailed images, with some leeway to crop in your images if needed.\n\nThat aside, this is a photographer's camera through and through, with an old-school design that includes dedicated exposure control dials and a portable body. Plus, if you're the kind of person who prefers not to fuss around with images after the fact, the camera's pre-set film simulation profiles can help you get storefront-ready photos straight out of the camera. That said, the X-T5's ergonomics and manual exposure dials can take some getting used to and are aimed at those who already know their way around camera settings.\n\nThe Nikon Z 5 offers incredible value for all kinds of product photographers. It's a fantastic entry-level full-frame camera, especially if you're primarily interested in photography. Though it doesn't have as much resolution as the Sony α7 IV or the Fujifilm X-T5, its full-frame sensor can capture high-quality images and performs well in trickier lighting, making it a good choice for those working with natural light. It also includes in-body image stabilization (IBIS), which can help you get steady shots at slower shutter speeds if you don't have bright product lighting.\n\nThis is definitely a steal of a camera body for amateur photographers, but it's worth noting that the cost of full-frame lenses can quickly add up, and they're typically a bit bigger and heavier than crop sensor alternatives like you'll get for the X-T5 above. That said, Nikon's Z series lenses are of excellent quality, particularly in the premium S Line. Ultimately, if you're looking for a full-frame camera for product photography, the Z 5 offers a ton of value for its price.\n\nWhile our picks above are all great enthusiast-level cameras, the Sony α6400 is a well-rounded entry-level model that's a great fit for anyone who's just starting out. Though it doesn't have IBIS like the cameras mentioned above, that won't matter too much if you have decent lighting, a tripod so you can slow down your shutter speed, or a lens with a wider aperture. Beyond that, it has an excellent APS-C sensor that captures sharp, detailed images.\n\nThough it uses Sony's older, less intuitive menu system and has somewhat cramped ergonomics, it benefits from the company's extensive lens selection. Sony's E mount has substantial third-party lens support, so there are a ton of options to try if the kit lens isn't cutting it. If you're more of a hybrid shooter and want to record some video on the side, or you simply prioritize ergonomics, the Canon EOS R10 is an excellent alternative with a better grip and more intuitive user interface, as well as slightly better video specs, though it's pricier and lens selection is more limited. For most people, the α6400 will be more than enough, and its lens selection and portability make it well worth considering.\n\nThe Canon EOS Rebel SL3/250D is a fantastic starter DSLR, but any older DSLR, new or used, will get the job done if you're on a tight budget. You can probably even get away with just using a modern-day smartphone. As mentioned above, the lighting and setup of your products will make the biggest difference in your product photography. Still, the SL3 has a lot to offer among budget options, with excellent ergonomics and great image quality straight out of the camera. It's also quite portable for a DSLR and has a much longer battery life than mirrorless alternatives.\n\nCanon's EF/EF-S lens mount has a very wide lens selection, including more affordable options, so you can also easily upgrade to better lenses down the line as your skills grow. A budget mirrorless camera like the Canon EOS R50 is another good option, with more bells and whistles and better video features. However, it's a tad pricier, and lens options for the RF mount are still fairly limited. However, the best budget option is whatever is most accessible to you, whether it's a used older model or the smartphone in your back pocket.\n\nIf you prefer the simplicity and portability of a point-and-shoot camera, the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III is one of the best point-and-shoots for product photography. It's on the pricier side for a compact camera but includes handy features like a tilting screen and pop-up flash. Unlike most smartphones and cheaper compact cameras, the G7 X Mark III uses a slightly larger 1-inch sensor, so image quality is great for its class.\n\nWhile it isn't as versatile as interchangeable lenses, the built-in lens on this model has a bit of zoom range, giving you some flexibility for framing and composition. Of course, the camera's also remarkably portable, making this a great choice for those who don't want a heavy, bulky kit. Just know that its compact size does come at the cost of battery life and more cramped ergonomics. It's harder to find in stock these days, so you may have to shop around or buy one off the used market."
