        "text": "Mirrorless Camera Z 9\n\nThe Z 9 is the first flagship model of the Z series mirrorless cameras bringing together Nikon's leading-edge technologies to deliver the best still and video features and performance in Nikon history. Thanks to the newly developed stacked CMOS sensor and the EXPEED 7 image-processing engine, the most powerful AF performance among Nikon cameras is realized. Also, this advanced AF system detects nine subject types for both stills and video: people, dogs, cats, birds, bicycles, motorcycles, cars, trains, and airplanes. With this system, decisive moments can be reliably captured for diverse subjects.\n\nDigital SLR Camera D6\n\nThe Nikon D6 features the most powerful AF in Nikon history and further evolved high-speed continuous shooting, while allowing faster image transfer than ever before. Thanks to the latest EXPEED 6 image-processing engine, it yields exceptional image quality, enabling posting without post-processing. It is a flagship model designed for every professional sports photographer and photojournalist who wants to nail the best moments with more confidence in beautiful images and deliver them before anyone else.\n\nNIKKOR Interchangeable Lenses for Cameras\n\nNIKKOR Z lenses that realize new-dimensional optical performance and the wide variety of the NIKKOR F lens lineup meet the diverse needs of our customers, from entry-level users to professional photographers. Superb depiction that enables the capture of any subject beautifully is achieved with Nikon's unique knowhow and cutting-edge technology.\n\nBinoculars WX 7x50 IF\n\nWX series binoculars have a super-wide field of view and were developed by combining the highest-class optical technologies, that Nikon has accumulated for a full century, with a passion for manufacturing. Providing a super-wide field of view that was realized especially for astronomical observation enthusiasts, the viewer experiences a feeling as if spacewalking into a starry sky, without perceiving the frame.\n\nBinoculars EDG 8x42\n\nComprising our flagship models, the EDG series binoculars employ leading-edge optical technologies. For instance, EDG binoculars utilize Nikon's renowned ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass, as well as a field-flattener lens system. This means the user can enjoy a sharp, contrast-rich and clear image throughout the entire field of view.\n\nFieldscope MONARCH 82ED-S\n\nEmploying an exceptional optical design, the MONARCH 82ED-S Fieldscope delivers beautiful image quality achieving an amazingly bright view. Its excellent operability further expands the enjoyment of every user. The advanced Apochromat Optical System with ED glass minimizes chromatic aberration to the furthest limit of the visible light range.\n\nCOOLSHOT PRO STABILIZED Laser Rangefinder\n\nThe STABILIZED function is employed to reduce vibrations caused through hand movement by approx. 80%, and a red internal OLED display is used to provide improved visibility. Measurement response time is the fastest among Nikon Laser Rangefinders for golf at approx. 0.3 second."
