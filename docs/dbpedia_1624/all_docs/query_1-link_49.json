        "text": "Nikon is a Japanese multinational corporation that specializes in optics and imaging products.Â\n\nFrom cameras and microscopes, to optical measurement systems, Nikon offers a large variety of products to its customers, which are renowned for their outstanding optics, design, and features\n\nInteresting Statistics of 2021 Highlighting Nikonâs Growth:Â\n\nRevenue ofÂ $4.4 billion\n\nOperating profit ofÂ $0.4 billion\n\nMarket capitalization ofÂ $3.77 billion\n\nStock price ofÂ $10.6Â on 31st March, 2022\n\nTotal assets ofÂ $8.5 billion\n\nWorkforce ofÂ 18,400 employees\n\nMarket share ofÂ 33.9%Â for DSLR cameras\n\nOperations inÂ 70 countries\n\nWhile Nikon has been struggling to stay afloat as new competitors emerge in the market, most loyal customers canât imagine a world without Nikonâs cameras.Â\n\nLet's take a deeper look at Nikon's remarkable innovations right from its foundation in 1917 to today - more than a century later.\n\n{{cta('eed3a6a3-0c12-4c96-9964-ac5329a94a27')}}\n\nNikonâs Beginning and Launch Of First Products\n\nNikonâpreviously named âNippon Kogakuââwas established in 1917 in Tokyo.Â\n\nIn the early 20th century, Japan was striving to modernize itself and establish its place in the global market. As a result, developing different domestic products was the countryâs top priority.Â\n\nNikon Begins with a MergerÂ\n\nThe production of advanced optical instruments was a âmatter of national urgencyâ and thus, the president of an already well-established brand, Mitsubishi, was entrusted with this tremendous task. His name wasÂ Koyata Iwasaki.Â\n\nThe easiest way to establish an optics company was to build on the expertise of preexisting companies.Â\n\nWith that logic, Iwasaki merged the optical instruments division of theÂ Tokyo KeikiÂ company and the mirror division ofÂ Iwaki GlassÂ withÂ Fujii Lens Manufacturing.Â\n\nBy bringing together the expertise of each of these divisions, Iwasaki was able to get a headstart in the domain of optical manufacturing.Â\n\nWhat Were Nikonâs First Products?\n\nIn 1918, Nikon started its research on optical glass but reached a dead end.Â\n\nDespite the joint expertise, the company could not initially address the myriad technical difficulties that came with manufacturing the product.Â\n\nThe research on optical glass was suspended temporarily, and the company worked on developing its binocular models.\n\nIn 1921, the MIKRON ultra-small-prism binoculars were designed, manufactured, and sold by Nikon. With their compactness and high functionality, they became leading products in the market, and updated versions of the product continue to reign to this day.Â\n\nOn the other hand, Nikon's strategy included importing technical knowledge from foreign industries.\n\nIn 1921, the company invited eight engineers from Germany who would initiate the design of Nikonâs photographic lenses.Â\n\nTo step into the optical market, the company needed to fully encompass the competitors' technologies. It first started by imitating European products before adding its own twist to them and, therefore, rendering them unrecognizable from their European counterparts.Â\n\nThe first series of lenses, which were more or fewer copies of European lenses, were called âAnytar.â This lens was designed by Heinrich Acht, one of the eight engineers invited to Japan.Â\n\nIn 1929, after Acht departed from Japan, the company made improvements to the lens.\n\nIn the meantime, the need to produce optical glasses became more pressing, and in 1922, the company resumed its suspended research.Â\n\nIt started by creating research facilities, and sure enough, in a matter of months, Nikon had carried out its first test-melting of glass and performed it's first kilningâboth of which are important stages of the production of optical glass.Â\n\nHowever, tragedy came in the form of the Great Kanto Earthquake, which damaged the company's glass research facilities.Â\n\nIn under five months, Nikon recovered the damage, and the research was then resumed. By March of 1927, 70 major melts and 220 trial melts had taken place. These efforts would improve the company's glass quality while creating the foundation for mass production.Â\n\nThe company also set up an analysis laboratory in its Oi Dai-ni plant and began research into other stages of optical glass production, such as glass annealing. In 1927, Nikon achieved its first successful glass annealing.\n\nNikonâs First Microscope Sets The Foundation\n\nAlong with the mass production of optical glass; the company had also been working on developing a microscope since day one. Its efforts came to fruition in 1925, with the release of its very first microscope.\n\nThe same engineer who created the Anytar lens was involved in the development of this product, as he brought with him rich expertise in the domain.Â\n\nTogether with Acht, Nikon released its JOICO microscope in 1925. With its 765x magnification, the microscope was a big deal at the time.Â\n\nHere Come The NIKKOR Lenses\n\nDeveloping photographic lenses isn't easy, but Nikon achieved that feat in 1929 when it released its first camera lens called the \"Anytar 12cm F4.5.â\n\nThe lens was the first in a series of camera lenses, which would collectively be known as the NIKKOR lenses.Â\n\nThese were born out of a strong desire of the Japanese to break out of their dependency on European companies for photographic lenses.Â\n\nNikonâs business model revolved around learning from experts in the field. Local designers traveled to Europe, visiting camera store after camera store in Berlin, until they had some semblance of an understanding of the production of these lenses.\n\nEven then, the process was tedious, and quite often, the image quality would not come out as wonderful as expected.Â\n\nAfter much trial and error, however, the company was successful in developing the lenses.Â\n\nThe product name \"NIKKOR lenses\" was designated in 1933 when the company delivered lenses that could be used in aerial photography. These would come in handy for map-makers.Â\n\nThese lenses, introduced in 1933, were titled âAero-NIKKOR.âÂ\n\nNikonâs Product Reaches the Tokyo Science MuseumÂ\n\nIn 1931, Nikonâs 8-inch astronomical telescope was installed in the roof observatory dome of the Tokyo Science Museum (which is now called the National Museum of Nature and Science).\n\nIt was the first full-fledged model of its kind produced in Japan.\n\nThe telescope stayed in the museum for about seventy years. During this period, it underwent many modifications, as developers kept it up to date. Its superiority made it the perfect instrument to take a look into the heavens.Â\n\nThe telescope still exists and is on permanent display in the same museum, in a zone called âExploring the Universe.âÂ\n\nKey Takeaway #1: Lead Your Industry by Incorporating Diverse PracticesÂ\n\nThe designers of Nikon didnât shy away from learning from their European colleagues. In fact, the company even brought in eight German engineers to aid their local engineers in the development of the lenses.Â\n\nWhere the German engineers could not help, Nikonâs designers took it upon themselves to visit Germany and learn through observation and inquiry, the tedious process of photographic lens production.Â\n\nThese âlessonsâ in manufacturing paid off, and it wasnât long before Nikon became a leading name in the production of optical lenses in Japan.\n\nNikonâs Innovation During Mid-20thÂ CenturyÂ\n\nOver the next few decades, the Nikon brand exploded in the global photography market as it reached milestone after milestone.Â\n\nThis was achieved through a mix of high-end products and clever marketing strategies, which would seal its name as a leading business all over the world.\n\nNikon set off the process of expansion by first going public in 1939.Â\n\nThe First Nikon CameraÂ\n\nIn 1946, the company's breakthrough came in the form of its new compact cameras. It was anticipated that these cameras would be popular in the market, so the leaders wanted to give the cameras a powerful brand name.\n\nAt that point, the company was still called \"Nippon Kogaku.\" Initially, Nikon settled for the brand name \"Nikko\" which was an abbreviation of its original name. Afterward, they added an \"n\" to the name, birthing the new company name \"Nikon.\"Â\n\nThe first Nikon camera was sold and marketed in 1948. It was initially called âNikonâ but as the company developers introduced new models, âModel Iâ was added to its name.\n\nIn the same year, the Model I profile projector was also introduced, which offered new features such as the parallel beam illumination method.Â\n\nThe expectations regarding the camera were met when in 1950, the New York Times published an article lauding the quality of the Nikon cameras and the NIKKOR photographic lenses.Â\n\nThe praise came following high acclaim from LIFE magazine photographers who had traveled to the Korean War battlefields armed with Nikonâs cameras.Â\n\nWhile other cameras had been unable to withstand the freezing temperatures of the Korean Peninsula, the Nikon cameras were able to produce high-quality pictures, documenting the bloodshed of the war.Â\n\nThe article was a huge accomplishment for the company as it hailed the company's cameras as one of the best in the world and even âbetter than German lenses.â Plus, it contributed to Nikonâs sales growth in the following years.\n\nThe accomplishment was also monumental on a national level, as it was the first time Japanese cameras had performed so well. Previously, cameras from the country had been known only for their beautiful exteriors.Â\n\nThe âMade in Japanâ stamp was renewed; instead of being associated with bad quality, the stamp now became a marker of excellent performance.Â\n\nThe NIKKOR Lenses - A Symbol of Optical Perfection\n\nAnother breakthrough for the company came in the form of an extremely high-resolution lens released in 1962.\n\nAfter World War II, Nikon relied on microfilm cameras imported from the USA. Before the printing press existed, microfilm cameras were used to store documents.Â\n\nHowever, the catch was that English characters were easier to capture than the intricate Japanese alphabet. The company catered to this local demand by introducing high-resolution lenses called \"Micro NIKKOR\" in 1956.Â\n\nDemand for resolution increased even further over time as companies needed high-resolution lenses to create printed circuit boards.Â\n\nIn the August of 1962, Nikon was finally able to meet this demand after much difficulty in the form of the âUltra Micro-NIKKOR.â Only two years later, the company updated the product, effectively developing a lens with the highest resolution in the world.Â\n\nFor reference, in 1964, Nikonâs innovative lenses were able to distinguish 1260 paired black and white strips per millimeter.\n\nThe lenses took the global and domestic markets by storm. They were also used later as the core technology of lithography systems, which would be called âthe most precise machinery in the world.âÂ\n\nHow Did Nikon Cameras Evolve Overtime?\n\nFrom the moon to the North Pole, Nikonâs cameras reached all sorts of peculiar places in the years to come.Â\n\nThis was largely because Nikon's engineers took specific requests from organizations and celebrities and focused on updating the cameras as rapidly as possible.Â\n\nIn 1959, the company released the Nikon F camera, which would become an important milestone in Nikonâs history.\n\nThis camera brought together Nikonâs optical and precision technology and garnered a major reaction across the globe.Â\n\nIt became the companyâs first lens-interchangeable camera and was renowned all over the world as a high-end SLR. It remained in production for 15 years, with more than 800,000 units produced!\n\nOver the years, many more models of the Nikon cameras were introduced, each contributing additional features and catering to specific demands. These features were one of the biggest reasons for Nikonâs success.\n\nFor example, the NIKONOS all-weather camera was introduced in 1963. As the name suggests, this camera was resistant to all weather and could withstand water/air pressure as well as heat.Â\n\nIn 1971, a Nikon camera landed on the moon.Â\n\nNASA had made special requests to the company to create a camera that would overcome the extreme environments of space. As a result, Nikon launched the Nikon Photomic FTN, which made use of NASA-specified materials such as lubricating oil.Â\n\nThe Nikon F2, on the other hand, was created for the professional photographer as well as the novice, as the camera offered easier operation, faster shooting, and impeccable quality all in one product.\n\nIn 1977, a Nikon camera made it to another peculiar place: the North Pole.Â\n\nAfter Naomi Uemura, one of Japanâs leading adventurers, first discovered the Nikon cameras when he first completed his dog sled trip around the Arctic Circle in 1976. Almost all of the photographers who greeted him at the finish line were armed with Nikon cameras.Â\n\nAs a result, Uemura requested the company to create a special camera for him, which he would use on his trip to the North Pole.Â\n\nNikonâs engineers immediately set to work and, after some experimentation, created the worldâs first titanium-exterior SLR camera in 1977.Â\n\nThis camera was called the Nikon F2 Titanium Uemura Special, named after the famous adventurer. In 1978, Uemura used the camera to document his six-month adventure to the North Pole.Â\n\nNikonâs Marketing Strategy: Organize Photography Clubs and ContestsÂ\n\nFor Nikon, simply developing high-end products wasnât enough. As the years passed, the company came up with new marketing strategies to promote photography culture.Â\n\nThe NIKKOR club was founded in 1952 with the help of renowned Japanese photographers like Ihei Kimura, Ken Domon, Jun Miki, Yusaku Kamekura, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Hideko Takamine.\n\nThese photographers were not just experts in the field, but they were also passionate about promoting photography culture. For example, in 1950, Kimura and Domon had set up a photographersâ society in Japan.\n\nTheir expertise and passion helped the Nikkor Club grow. In 1953, the Club released its first newsletters, which were widely read by its audience.Â\n\nOver the years, the Club continued to serve as a marketing platform for the company, boosting Nikon's market share. One of the most prominent events arranged by the Club was the Nikkor Club Tokyo Grand Photo Session.Â\n\nIn 1968, more than 6000 Nikon fans gathered at the Hayama Marina for the photo session. The event was divided into exciting segments, from photography instruction sessions to model photo shoots.Â\n\nThe event helped bring together professionals and fans and garnered interest in photography, as well as Nikon's cameras and photographic lenses.Â\n\nSimilarly, the company also opened a photo gallery called the Ginza Nikon Salon. The first exhibition of this gallery was called \"The Eyes of Ihei Kimuraâ â who was a celebrated Japanese photographer.Â\n\nAnother marketing strategy adopted by Nikon was arranging a photography contest sponsored by the company. This contest was titled â1st Nikon Photo Contest International.â\n\nIn its first year, 1969, the contest attracted more than 21,000 submissions from thirty-seven countries all over the world. The contest proved to be a massive success in terms of attracting the relevant audience.Â\n\nNikon continues to hold an annual photography contest to this day. It is now known as the âNikon Photo Contest.âÂ\n\nFurthermore, since 1974, the company has chosen the Nikon Calendar photos from contest submissions, allowing participants to reach out to large audiences while promoting their own products.Â\n\nKey Takeaway #2: Nurture a Community Around Your ProductÂ\n\nNikonâs marketing strategy was not limited to airing simple advertisements. Its establishment of the photography club and the photo contest promoted the culture of taking pictures all over the world.\n\nEvents like the Grand Tokyo photography session further created a sense of community around the Nikon cameras and motivated people to engage in the art of photography.Â\n\nAs a result, the company was able to create a newfound desire for its productânot just by developing high-quality products but by creating avenues through which the products could be put to good use.Â\n\n{{cta('eed3a6a3-0c12-4c96-9964-ac5329a94a27')}}\n\nNikonâs Expansion of Product RangeÂ\n\nFollowing the success of its cameras, the company continued to update its Nikon series and introduce new products along the way.\n\nThe Nikon strategy was to bank on opportunities if a new need arose in the market. Whether it was film cameras or high-precision lenses, the company's engineers were the first to produce them.Â\n\nNikon: A History of FirstsÂ\n\nIn 1976, the VLSI Technology Research Association asked Nikon to develop a stepper, which would reduce circuit pattern sizes by 90%.Â\n\nThe development of the stepper required the company to master several core technologies.Â\n\nFirstly, the stepper required a projection lens capable of high-precision resolution and a high-precision, high-speed moving stage for positioning. The issue with the moving stage was that it was difficult to get it to move straight.\n\nNikon beat the obstacle and emerged victorious, creating a device that was accurate enough to âhit a tennis ball with an arrow on the top of Mount Fuji all the way from Tokyo.âÂ\n\nFor reference, Mount Fuji is on the island of Honshu, which is 62 miles away from Tokyo.Â\n\nSecondly, the stepper also required photo-electric sensors, which would convert light into electric signals. Nikon's innovation and expertise shined through in this phase of production as well.\n\nWithin two years, the company delivered the first prototype of the product and received high acclaim. Later, in 1980, the NSR-1010G stepper was introduced, becoming the first domestically produced commercial device.Â\n\nIn the next year, Nikon released the TITEX titanium ophthalmic frame, once again being the first in the world to develop such a unique product. These frames were stronger but lighter, making them a useful option for anyone looking for a more comfortable experience with glasses.\n\nNikon scored another first in 1984 when it introduced the NT-1000 35mm film direct telephoto transmitter. This was developed together withÂ Kyodo News AgencyÂ and specifically designed for use by the media.\n\nThe device revolutionized traditional systems by allowing users to read photographic negatives and positives directly. Previous systems made use of enlarged prints.Â\n\nSince direct reading was quicker than enlarging prints and reading them, the device was perfect for the time-sensitive needs of journalists.Â\n\nAlong with this telephoto transmitter, the company released a still video camera system in 1988, both of which ultimately paved the way for digital camera systems in the future.Â\n\nIn 1985, the company released its first digitized surveying instrument, and in 1986, Nikon further diversified by developing the TRISTATION 600 and 600M three-dimensional coordinate measuring machines. With these, Nikon hit another first, as no such machine in Japan achieved such spatial accuracy as these did.Â\n\nThe following year, Nikon released the NSR-L7501G large substrate exposure system, which was the first of its LCD steppers and scanners. Once again, the product was unique in the market, as it could expose a maximum area of 75mm compared to the 30mm area in the traditional lithography world.Â\n\nA few years later, in 1995, Nikon came up with another revolutionary invention: the CNC video measuring system.\n\nAs technology progressed, there was a pressing need to produce extra-precise measurements of electronic and automotive parts without touching them.Â\n\nThe CNC video measuring system was the solution to this issue: the system combined image-processing technologies and optical measurement technologies to produce a non-contact measurement system.Â\n\nThe company made another breakthrough in 2006 with the release of its ArF immersion scanner. This first of its kind, this product changed the direction of immersion lithography technology and achieved the worldâs highest N.A.Â\n\nN.A. controls the quality of the image produced through lithography. This means in 2006, Nikon was producing the best-quality images out there!Â\n\nThe company didnât stop with the measuring system. Nikonâs strategy has always been to release product after product that would blow away customers from different markets.Â\n\nThe next year, the company came up with the groundbreaking BioStation CT cell culture observation system, which would help in live-cell observation.Â\n\nWhat this device did was, it inserted the microscopeÂ insideÂ the incubator. This meant that scientists didnât have to remove live cells to observe them.Â\n\nAnother development came in 2010 when Nikon marketed its new non-contact multi-sensor 3D metrology system. While the measurement system that the company created in 1995 was already way ahead of its time, this system jumped further into the future with its on-the-mark measurements and high speed.Â\n\nWhile the company has been known mostly for producing cameras, all the aforementioned products shed light on its indispensable position in the optical market, boosting Nikon's market share in other areas as well.Â\n\nHow did Nikon Develop its Cameras in the Late 20thÂ Century?Â\n\nNikon's innovation saw no end when it came to camera creation. The company put out model after model as its engineers hunched over tables, determined to provide the best image quality in the world.Â\n\nA few of these were of particular importance.Â\n\nFor example, in 1980, the Nikon F3 was developed, which was the first camera to offer electronic shutter control.\n\nIn the same year, the Nikon F3 Big Camera was developed, along with an F3 Small Camera, both of which traveled to space in 1981. These cameras were made at NASA's request.\n\nIn 1983, the company released an SLR camera with an AF mechanism. While today the auto-focus feature in cameras seems common, back in the day it was a challenge to achieve this feat.Â\n\nA few years later, Nikon decided that its cameras should also travel underwater. 1992 saw that decision come to fruition with the release of the Nikonos RS underwater AF SLR cameraâyes, the AF means, the auto-focus function was present even underwater!\n\nIn 1995, the company collaborated successfully with Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. and released its E2 and E2s cameras. The expertise of Fuji Film came to much use, as digital cameras would become omnipresent in the future.Â\n\nTwo years later, Nikon would come up with its first compact digital camera on its own.Â\n\nDuring that time, the company was working on another projectâdeveloping the well-known DSLR camera. This camera was released in 1999 and was revolutionary in various aspects including quality, speed, dimensions,Â andÂ price.Â\n\nThe DSLR was developed in just two short years and stood out in the market for being just one-third of the price of its competitors.Â\n\nIn 2010, new models of the digital SLR cameras, D3S and D3X found themselves in NASAâs space station. The International Space Station continues to use them for internal and extravehicular activities.Â\n\nKey Takeaway #3: Grab Untapped Opportunities by Applying Your Expertise to Different Industries\n\nNikon could have stopped at the production of camerasâthey were hugely successful either wayâbut the company grew because it diversified and targeted other markets as well.Â\n\nFor example, Nikon produced microscopes that allowed for live-cell observations. This was a unique problem faced by biologists. The company had done its research; it knew of the gap in the market and it rushed in to fill the space.Â\n\nSimilarly, the optical measurement systems created by Nikon werenât targeted at photographers, but at automotive markets.Â\n\nThese systems would allow automotiveâand other electronicâmarkets to come up with precise measurements for the parts of their machines.\n\nNikon understood that the use of lenses was not limited to producing images, but that they could also be used to come up with measurements. Their in-depth knowledge of their product allowed them to venture into previously untapped markets and generate high revenues through them.Â\n\nNikonâs diversification would also be the reason why it would stay afloat in the following years.Â\n\nNikonâs Digital Transformation and Fight Against Competitors\n\nDespite Nikonâs innovative products, the company faced a turbulent period in 2013 with the rise of smartphones.\n\nThe company was only able to stay afloat because of the various other products it had sold.Â\n\nWhen profit dropped by about 50% in 2013, however, the company decided to focus more on said products, while exploring other optical technologies tentatively.Â\n\nHow did Nikon Beat the Smartphones?Â\n\nStripped off its demand for digital cameras, Nikon made a smart decision to set aside money for deals, mergers, and acquisitions.Â\n\nThe best way to deal with the crisis, after all, was to turn to companies that were doing different things and learn from them.Â\n\nIn 2015, the company took overÂ U.K.âs Optos Plc., which was a medical technology company. This acquisition was true to Nikon's earlier decision to focus on products other than cameras and would allow the company to tap into a new market.\n\nNikon also soon gained 100% control overÂ Mark Roberts Motion Control Ltd.Â This company specialized in motion control equipment used in films and advertisements.\n\nOnce again, the takeover filled in some of the gap left by the reduced digital-camera demand as it focused on a separate market. After all, smartphones were well and good when it came to individual usage, but films and advertisements required more high-quality equipment.Â\n\nA few years later, in 2019, Nikon took another initiative by establishing the Next Generation Project Division. This division is aimed at providing manufacturing solutions to clients to create greater synergy in the optical industry. The project also intended to form strategic investments and alliances with industry-leading companies worldwide.Â\n\nThis was a step away from Nikonâs traditional develop-and-sell strategy over the years.Â\n\nTwo years later, Nikon established a stronger foothold over the market by acquiring yet another companyâMorf3D.Â In line with its new project division, this company also provided additive manufacturing solutions to clients.Â\n\nNikonâs Marketing Strategy: The Nikon Museum and âCapture Tomorrowâ Campaign\n\nAs Nikon hit its first century, the Nikon Museum was opened to set off its 100th birthday celebration.\n\nThis was a unique marketing strategy, as the companyâs entire history was put on display in the museum. A shop was also set up within museum grounds to encourage visitors to buy Nikonâs products.\n\nJust like the NIKKOR club became a marketing platform, the museum, too, served the same purpose.Â\n\nThe museum would intermittently hold screenings of movies like âThe F2, the Worldâs Greatest Mechanical Cameraâ or âThe Appeal of the NIKKORâ, which would create awe around the companyâs products and give them higher exposure.Â\n\nNikon merchandise was also available at the museum (there were mugs with camera illustrations!). In short, the company aimed to form a sense of community around its products through its museum.Â\n\nNikonâs marketing strategy was more robust than ever. The company also established a BioImaging Lab, which would attract relevant customers from a more niche market.Â\n\nThis research lab was aimed at scientists looking for high-quality optical equipment to carry out their research and was an excellent way of bringing them together organically, while subtly providing their products within lab grounds.\n\nLastly, the company also launched the âCapture Tomorrowâ campaign with the help of world-famous photographers such as Jamari Lior and Weerapong Chaipuck.Â\n\nThe campaign aimed to pivot Nikon toward a âfuture-oriented outlookâ. It consisted of shots taken by the aforementioned photographers through its new Z series mirrorless cameras. These shots, along with a video, were revealed to the public.Â\n\nAccording to Stephanie Dugas, the campaign focused âon the brandâs energy in driving excellence and reshaping the future of photography to explore limitless possibilities.â\n\nHow Did Nikon Embrace Digital Transformation?\n\nOver the last decade, Nikon released many more products, including updated versions of cameras, microscopes, and telescopes.\n\nSmooth operations of the company could not have been possible without internal digital transformation.Â\n\nOver the past decade, the company has bought software like Salesforce Service Cloud, SAP Cash Management, and Adobe Connect, to ensure the efficient organization of the business.\n\nNikon also signed an agreement withÂ Digizuite, aiming to use its Digital Asset Management (DAM) SaaS software as part of its digital transformation strategy.Â\n\nThe software would allow consistent distribution of the brandâs digital content. This was important to achieve as the company was also conducting operations in Europe as well as Japan.Â\n\nSince Nikon is a technological company, its research centers are well-equipped and conducive to innovation and invention as well.Â\n\nKey Takeaway #4: Reframe Your Solution to Create a New Market and Increase Demand\n\nNikon faced a backlash because of its focus on cameras but thankfully, it had other products to keep its ship sailing.Â\n\nOne of the things that Nikon did while responding to the declining demand for its digital cameras was to engage in takeovers and acquisitions that would boost products that were still in high demand.Â\n\nThis allowed the company to compensate for its losses in the camera market.Â\n\nOn the other hand, Nikon didnât give up on cameras. By adopting a marketing strategy that focused on promoting photography culture, the company was able to bring back some of its revenue from the camera market.Â\n\nIn contrast with smartphones being the new âinâ product, Nikon created a brand image that made it seem like a âfuture-oriented companyâ. For example, its new tagline read âUnlock the future with the power of lightâ. It also created multiple social media accountsâespecially on Instagramâto interact with the youth and promote photography culture among them.\n\nIn that sense, Nikon pushed back against the smartphone revolution, putting its cameras as the face of the future.\n\nIn other words, Nikon tried to ensure that its cameras were the âright productsâ. After all, it couldnât waste years of investment on its high-quality cameras.Â\n\nIt is important to remember that it was able to do so because the demand for cameras hadnât completely disappeared. Professionals still needed cameras for their photography. What Nikon needed to do was create more professionals by promoting photography culture.Â\n\nWhy Is Nikon So Successful?Â\n\nNikonâs continuous innovation and smart marketing strategies made it a leading optical company in the global market.Â\n\nNikonâs VisionÂ\n\nNikon strives to brighten the human experience through its cameras.Â\n\nâUnleashing the limitless possibilities of light. Striving to brighten the human experience. Focused, with purpose, on a better future for all.âÂ\n\nNikonâs MissionÂ\n\nNikonâs mission is to empower people through its imaging products.Â\n\nâTo know what you want from imaging today and tomorrow, and to empower you through images to realize your dreams.âÂ\n\nNikonâs Growth by NumbersÂ\n\nStrategies to Learn from Nikonâs JourneyÂ\n\nNikonâs journey offers many lessons for business leaders, c-level executives, and entrepreneurs hoping to make an impact.\n\nSome of the key strategic takeaways are as follows:Â\n\nLearn from Competitors to Beat themÂ\n\nDuring its initial years, Nikon had to depend upon German engineers to help develop its first products.Â\n\nFor example, its Anytar lens was created with the help of Heinrich Acht, who was one of the eight foreign engineers invited to Japan.\n\nWhen the engineers left, Nikon had an abundant pool of knowledge and expertise to draw from.Â\n\nOnly a few decades later, the company surpassed its German competitors, when the New York Times hailed its lenses as far better than their German counterparts, boosting Nikonâs market share internationally.Â\n\nEstablish Your Market Presence Through Memorable EventsÂ\n\nNikon had an annual photo contest that reminded both fans and potential customers of its presence in the world each year.Â\n\nSimilarly, the company also held events such as Tokyo Grand Photo Session, which brought traffic their way.\n\nIt helped that the people who organized these events were often experts solicited by the company.Â\n\nBy gathering experts and holding such events, Nikon was able to create a tradition around its cameras. Plus, there was an increasing sense of community as professionals and amateurs came together in the NIKKOR club to learn the art of photography.Â\n\nBe the First to Create Solutions to Customer Problems\n\nNikonâs strategy revolved around being the âfirstâ to figure out potential customers who were facing imaging-related problems. Due to this attitude, the company was able to develop solutions to problems faced by a diverse audience, including scientists and astronauts.Â\n\nNikon was also quick to identify the unique needs created by the technological revolution. By developing and marketing an accurate optical measurement system, the company was able to generate revenue from all those manufacturers who needed precise measurements for their productsâ electronic parts.Â\n\nOn the other hand, the company created new possibilitiesâby introducing waterproof and space-weather conducive cameras, Nikon allowed customers to take their products to places they would never have imagined before.\n\nConcentrate on Products with the Highest Revenue TurnoverÂ\n\nWhen smartphones surpassed digital cameras in the market, Nikon realized that it could no longer invest most of its energy in cameras.Â\n\nIt shifted its attention to other products in that duration. For example, it was in the last decade that the company established a bioimaging lab, which would boost the sales of its microscopes.\n\nThe company also acquired relevant companies such asÂ Optos PlcÂ which would allow it to gain expertise in the medical technology market.Â\n\nIt was important for the company leaders to recognize that if they didnât turn their attention to other products, their revenues would fall. In the end, Nikonâs diversification strategy boosted its revenue growth.Â\n\nIt is worthwhile to note that Nikon didnât try to compete against hegemonic trends; it tried to align itself with those trends and provide solutions to different potential audiences.Â\n\nNikonâs journey has not been easy but it has managed to stay afloat for over a century. The key to its success has been its innovation of products, as well as its unique ability to rapidly offer solutions to emerging problems in the market. While the company has found itself in deep waters due to competition, it still enjoys a high market share and is indispensable in the optical imaging market.\n\n{{cta('eed3a6a3-0c12-4c96-9964-ac5329a94a27')}}"
