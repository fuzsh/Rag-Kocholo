        "text": "My first ever DSLR was a Canon t4i Rebel that I got for Christmas in 2014. I still have it and I’ve stood by Canon since then and truthfully, I still stand behind Canon.\n\nSo when I posted that I was selling all of my Canon gear, people were definitely in shock and wanted to know why.\n\nI’ll start by saying, this is not a “make the switch to Nikon, right now, post.” Everyone can sit here and go on and on about why Canon, Sony, Nikon, or mirrorless is the way to go. Instead I want to share why I felt Nikon was the better investment for me and my business.\n\nWhen I went full-time with my business I was just like everyone else thinking I needed to shoot everything: families, seniors, weddings, and obviously horses were the focus. So I grew my arsenal and made the appropriate upgrades when it was time. I pursued weddings for a few years and started photographing horse shows in 2018. Overtime I worked with people who shot both Nikon and Canon, having both RAW files in my editing bay was where I saw the difference between the two. I still to this day will say Canon color tones are still the best for human skin tones. They are a lot milkier of an orange and softer blacks vs Nikon leaning toward yellows and a very dark and contrasting black. When it came to portraits and weddings, the skin tones were of the utmost importance to me. Is it a simple fix in photoshop? Of course, but that extra editing is tedious and not something you want to deal with when you have multiple photographers and gear that you are editing. So yes there is a reason when wedding photogs looking for second shooters say this type of gear preferred.\n\nAs my business pivoted and I decided I was strictly photographing horses, we started taking on more horse shows. This is when I really started paying attention to keep rate and longevity.\n\nWhen it comes to my team of photographers at horse shows, we were about 50/50 with Nikon and Canon users. When I looked at the keep rate between the two, for both artistic and standard shots, Nikon always was higher. Canon I felt like struggled with anything other than the standard jump photo. Not to toot my own horn, but I knew when a photo missed because of me vs my camera.\n\nAs I ended 2019 and did my first year of 10 show contracts on top of 200+ portraits, I started having A LOT of gear problems. I felt like I was constantly having to take in my gear because something was always slightly off when we were at horse shows (portraits were not a problem, but I was definitely overshooting because I was constantly second guessing myself). I was lucky that the Canon factory was down the street and could take it in without a second thought. When I would ask why I was back a week later having the same issue, I always got the answer of “well you do shoot a lot and your gear is getting old.” I found it hard to believe that they considered a 13 month old $4,000 camera old and god forbid I was shooting a lot because it was MY JOB.\n\nMeanwhile, my main second was on year 6 with her Nikon D4, she upgraded to the D6 this year. When I saw her frames on my screen I said for the first time ever “dam that’s SHARP.” This year was also the first show season that I wasn’t bringing in the most sales off of my photos and I knew a lot of it was me playing safe for the keep rate and because I could visibly see the difference: my gear wasn’t keeping up.\n\nSo I tried the D850 and the D6 since I could steal them from my team while at a show. I liked the D850 too, but when it came to the speed, longevity, and the 3D tracking that would help significantly increase my keep rate… the D6 was worth the extra money.\n\nThe Canon 1DX Mark iii was Canon’s flagship body which was supposed to be the equivalent to Nikon’s D6, so I rented it as my last hope to not have to completely switch ship. I was extremely disappointed. It was fast, but not as fast. It was sharp, but I didn’t think it was any sharper then my 5D Mark iii or IV, and since the oldest gear I had was barely 3 years old I had lost faith that Canon was creating products that could last me 5 or 6 years if I was going to continue to have an intense horse show schedule.\n\nSo I made the switch to Nikon.\n\nAs I’ve told many people, if I was still pursing weddings and sticking to portraits I would not have made the switch. It wasn’t that the gear wasn’t working, it just wasn’t keeping up for where my business was heading. I had an entire wedding set up of lens, back up bodies, cards and batteries for days. It was a HUGE loss in Canon equipment (although, professional gear holds its value and I’m thankful and I was able to sell pretty much everything fairly quickly). It was a HUGE investment purchasing Nikon and I have major anxiety not having backup gear at the moment."
