        "text": "If you’re new to photography, you have a lot of reasons to look at the best beginner DSLR cameras. That’s still true in 2024, even as many manufacturers are winding down DSLR production. For one thing, entry-level DSLR cameras are often more affordable than mirrorless alternatives. From our experience, their physical controls also make them great cameras to learn with.\n\nWe’ve tested a lot of DSLR cameras over the years. In that time, we’ve learnt that the best beginner models share a few key characteristics: they’re easy to use, shoot excellent stills and have reliable battery life. Most also work with a wide range of lenses. In a sign of the industry’s shift from DSLR to mirrorless, the camera that we think best ticks those boxes has actually been discontinued: the Nikon D3500. Luckily, you can still find it for sale online.\n\nThe idea behind this guide is to give you a clear picture of what entry-level DSLRs are available right now. To do that, we’ve compiled the results of our in-depth reviews and summarized our personal favorites. We’ve explained the positives and drawbacks of each camera, as well as deciphering some photography jargon. And if you want to know more about how we review entry-level DSLR cameras, you can scroll to the bottom for an insight into our testing process.\n\nThe quick list\n\nThe round-up below will give you an instant overview of the best beginner DSLR cameras available in 2024, including what each option is best for. When you find one that ticks your boxes, use the links beneath each entry to jump down to our full summary reviews.\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best beginner DSLRs for 2024\n\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best beginner DSLR cameras in our list. We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\n\nThe best beginner DSLR overall\n\nNikon D3500 sample images\n\nNikon has officially ceased production of the D3500, but it remains an excellent option for those who are new to photography. Building on the foundation laid by the D3400, it adds a handful of extra perks. Battery life is one of them: unlike power-hungry mirrorless models, we found in testing that the D3500 could capture more than 1,500 images between charges – way ahead of most other DSLRs. We found that the 24MP sensor was capable of delivering excellent image quality, too.\n\nNikon also revised the body and control layout of the D3500 compared to previous generations, which we think makes it nicer to handle and easier to use. The useful Guide Mode takes the first-time user’s hand and walks them through all the key features in a way that makes everything easy to understand. We still think the Nikon D3500 is the best DSLR option for new photographers, and one of the best cameras for beginners overall. If you’re just getting started and can find one in stock, we reckon you will as well.\n\nRead our in-depth Nikon D3500 review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best budget DSLR for beginners\n\nCanon EOS Rebel SL3 / 250D / 200D Mark II sample images\n\nThe EOS Rebel SL3 (also known as the 250D and 200D Mark II outside the US) isn't Canon's cheapest DSLR, but we think it offers a great blend of features, performance and value. For a start, it's the smallest and lightest DSLR with an articulating screen, which means it isn't an intimidatingly large as some of its rivals. It also adds a fresh processing engine and 4K video recording to its Rebel SL2 (EOS 200D) predecessor.\n\nWe were impressed with its responsive touchscreen, speedy start-up time and excellent Dual Pixel CMOS AF system, which also works when you're shooting 1080p video (though not sadly in 4K). Its 5fps burst shooting can't compete with the latest mirrorless cameras, so those who like to shoot sports or action should look elsewhere. But for our money, the EOS Rebel SL3 / EOS 250D makes more sense than Canon's super-budget DSLRs, such as the EOS Rebel T100 (also know as the EOS 4000D / EOS 3000D).\n\nRead our in-depth Canon EOS Rebel SL3 / EOS 250D review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best premium beginner DSLR\n\nCanon EOS Rebel T8i / EOS 850D sample images\n\nThe Canon EOS Rebel T8i (know as the EOS 850D outside the US) picks up the baton from the popular Rebel T7i / EOS 800D, which is now tricky to find. It isn't a huge upgrade: the most notable addition is a 4K video mode, which we found to be hampered by frame-rate restrictions. Still, the Rebel T8i / EOS 850D remains one of our favorite all-round DSLRs for beginners.\n\nYou get a Dual Pixel phase-detection AF system, which in our tests was fast, reliable and great for video. Its button layout is also very considered, while the vari-angle LCD screen handles really well. As long you ignore that headline of 4K video, which involves a crop and the loss of phase-detection autofocus, it remains a great option for anyone who's starting a photography hobby and prizes DSLR advantages like battery life and handling over the latest mirrorless tech.\n\nRead our in-depth Canon EOS Rebel T8i / EOS 850D review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best rugged beginner DSLR\n\nPentax K-70 sample images\n\nIt's several years old, but the Pentax K-70 – or the Pentax KF, which is essentially the same camera with a slightly sharper display – remains a good-value option for beginners who want something different from the 'big two' DSLR manufacturers. It's a particularly good choice if you have a stash of old Pentax lenses gathering dust. The K-70 benefits from a useful articulating screen, while the hybrid live view autofocus system proved to be a practical alternative to the viewfinder during our review.\n\nOur favorite thing about the K-70 is its tough build quality, which is typically lacking in entry-level models. If you're keen to take lots of pictures outdoors – for example, you might want to try landscape photography – then being able to rely on the K-70 in inclement weather is a big bonus. One slight disappointment is the kit lens which is often bundled with the camera: while it offers a longer focal length than most, we found it could be a little soft in places. Still, with solid specs and rugged credentials, the Pentax K-70 is a capable all-rounder that's worth considering.\n\nRead our in-depth Pentax K-70 review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best beginner DSLR to grow with\n\nNikon D5600 sample images\n\nHere's another beginner DSLR that is holding its own in a market dominated by mirrorless cameras. The D5600 is a step up from Nikon's D3000-series models, with set of specs strong enough to rival the likes of the Canon EOS Rebel T8i / EOS 850D (see above). Key advantages over the D3500 include a large touchscreen that has a vlogging-friendly articulating design to flip round to the front, plus Wi-Fi and a healthy range of additional control on the inside.\n\nIn our tests, its 24.2MP sensor produced detailed images that didn't disappoint. In fact, despite the D5600's age, you'll likely need to upgrade to a full-frame camera to get better results. We also found its 39-point AF system to be decent, if a little dated, while polished handling makes the D5600 a well-rounded entry-level DSLR. You need to pay more for the privilege, but it makes sense to go for the D5600 if you want a beginner camera with growing room: it'll be a reliable companion for years to come.\n\nRead our in-depth Nikon D5600 review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best bargain beginner DSLR\n\nCanon EOS Rebel T7 / EOS 2000D / EOS 1500D sample images\n\nThis is one of the cheapest DSLRs in Canon's current line-up, which also makes it a very cost-effective way to get access to an endless assortment of compatible lenses, flashguns and other accessories. Its low price tag means it understandably lacks some of the fancy tricks of its bigger brothers – including a flip-out display and 4K video recording – but there's still a good level of physical control on offer.\n\nMost importantly, we found the image quality produced by its 24MP sensor to be sound. The camera is designed very much with its target audience in mind, including a Feature Guide to help you understand basic settings. Its impressive battery life is also better than many mirrorless models at this price point. During our review, we found it a well-rounded starter option for those on a budget, with features such as Wi-Fi, NFC and Full HD video rounding out the specs.\n\nRead our in-depth Canon EOS Rebel T7 / EOS 2000D / EOS 1500D review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best enthusiast DSLR for beginners\n\nCanon EOS 90D sample images\n\nThe Canon EOS 90D might be the last enthusiast DSLR the company ever makes. If so, it’s going out with a bang: the versatile 90D packs a high-resolution sensor which, paired with Canon’s Digic 8 imaging engine, offers the enticing prospect of uncropped 4K video at 30fps. In our tests, color reproduction was superb and there was plenty of detail in both stills and video. A new 216-zone metering system also helped in this department, even if noise did creep into images above ISO 8000.\n\nLike the 80D before it, the deep grip meant the 90D felt comfortable to handle, while a joystick made selecting from the Dual Pixel CMOS AF points a cinch. Battery life is a boon, too, with at least 1,500 shots possible on a single charge in our experience. It's possibly a bit too much camera for an absolute beginner (both in price and features), but there's no doubt it offers a lot of room to grow into. Either way, the 90D proves that DSLRs still very much have a place in the mirrorless world.\n\nTo save some money on Canon products, check out our Canon discount codes.\n\nRead our in-depth Canon EOS 90D review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nHow to choose\n\nHow do I choose the best beginner DSLR?\n\nThere are four main factors to consider when buying an entry-level DSLR: the camera's size, sensor size, screen and lens options.\n\nIf you're trying to learn your way around manual settings like aperture and shutter speed, which is one of the main benefits of a DSLR, then you'll ideally need a model that's small and light. This means you'll be more likely to take it out regularly and master those controls. The most beginner-friendly cameras, including the Nikon D3500 and Canon 250D, tend to be particularly small for DSLRs, so take a close look at those.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the camera's sensor size. Most beginner-friendly DSLRs have APS-C sensors, which are much larger than a smartphone's and more than good enough for those starting out on the photography journeys. But if you're buying second-hand, you may find that full-frame options like the Nikon D610 and D750 come into your price range.\n\nFull-frame cameras aren't necessarily better than APS-C ones. The traditional strengths of full-frame are dynamic range, strong low-light performance, and pleasing bokeh, but these all add to the cameras' size and price. Consider the kinds of things you like to photograph – it can sometimes be easier to shoot distant subjects like wildlife and sports with APS-C cameras due to their narrower angle of view (like in the example below).\n\nIf you're looking to shoot lots of video along with your stills, DSLRs can be cheap YouTube workhorses too, so make sure you look out for models with a vari-angle screen (like the ones on most Canon models) if you need this. These can help you shoot from different angles and also flip round to the front so you can check your framing while recording to camera.\n\nLastly, you'll want to consider lenses. As a beginner, you'll most likely be starting from scratch, which means it makes more sense to buy your DSLR with a kit lens. A word of warning here, though – most manufacturers offer two types of kits lens, one with image stabilization and one without. It's best to go with the image-stabilized kit lens, as you'll be able to shoot sharper images at slower shutter speeds.\n\nWhile an 18-55mm kit lens will be more than enough to get you started, one of the big benefits of DSLRs is being able to add extra lenses for different kinds of photography. For example, wide-angle and telephoto zoom lenses, as well as high-quality macro options. You can also add a flashgun and other accessories, which help you to make the most of whatever types of photography you're into.\n\nWhat do different photography terms mean?\n\nWhen choosing your first DSLR, you'll might come across photography terms that you're not familiar with. To help you decipher these, we've explained some of the main jargon below.\n\nDSLR: This stands for Digital Single-Lens Reflex. The key thing to understand is that DSLR cameras use a mirror to bounce light from the lens on to a sensor inside.\n\nMegapixel (MP): Megapixels are a measure of image resolution. One megapixel equals a million pixels. More megapixels generally means a sharper image.\n\nSensor size: Sensor dimensions are usually measured in millimeters. Standard sizes are APS-C (16.7x25.1mm) and full-frame (24x36mm). A larger sensor usually gives you better image quality and low-light performance.\n\nISO: This stands for International Standards Organization. It's a way of measuring a sensor's sensitivity to light. Higher numbers can gather more light in dim conditions, but also introduce grain.\n\nAperture: This is the opening in a lens that light passes through. Aperture is measured in f-stops. Lower numbers indicate wider apertures, allowing more light to enter the camera.\n\nShutter speed: This measures how long a camera's shutter stays open to let light reach the sensor. Faster speeds freeze motion; slower creates blur.\n\nLens mount: This is the mount that allows you to attach different lenses to a DSLR camera. Different manufacturers have their own systems.\n\nImage stabilization (IS): This helps to reduce camera blur when you're taking photos handheld. It can be found in the lens or within the camera body itself.\n\nAutofocus (AF): This feature automatically changes the cameras focus to keep subjects sharp. Faster autofocus speeds help to capture quick-moving subjects.\n\nRAW: A file format that retains more image information from the sensor and gives you more editing options compared to JPEG files.\n\nJPEG: JPEG images are compressed in-camera to make them smaller in size, but offer less flexibility for editing than RAW files.\n\nViewfinder: An optical viewfinder is one of the key features of a DSLR camera. This viewing window gives you a true preview of a given scene reflected through the lens.\n\nIs mirrorless or DSLR better for beginners?\n\nThere are several similarities between the best beginner mirrorless and DSLR cameras. Both give you the option to change lenses, which means you can upgrade to different lenses as your skills grow. Both are also available with a range of sensor sizes, to suit your aspirations and budget.\n\nBut there are also key ways in which mirrorless and DSLR cameras differ. The main one is that DSLR cameras use a mirror to reflect light onto their sensor; mirrorless cameras do not. This means mirrorless cameras usually offer faster shooting speeds, which is useful if you'd like to try action or wildlife photography.\n\nDSLR cameras are traditionally known for their big grips and accessible controls. These make them easy and comfortable for learners to handle. Certain mirrorless cameras imitate this DSLR styling, but many have more compact bodies. This can affect their ergonomics, but also makes them a good choice for beginners who want a camera that’s easy to carry around.\n\nDSLR cameras are also known for their optical viewfinders, which give you a true picture of the scene that you’re shooting. Mirrorless cameras, in contrast, utilise electronic viewfinders and/or touchscreens for framing purposes. The latter can be easier to adjust to if you’re upgrading from a smartphone, but many beginners prefer the analogue experience of an optical viewfinder.\n\nWhether a mirrorless or DSLR camera is better for you will come down to personal preference. It’s worth noting that entry-level DSLR cameras tend to be more affordable than their mirrorless equivalents. For more detail, it's worth reading our comprehensive mirrorless vs DSLR cameras guide. If you don’t know what kind of camera you need at all, check out our easy-to-follow guide: what camera should I buy.\n\nCanon vs Nikon: which is better for beginners?\n\nEven though Pentax still makes DSLRs, Canon and Nikon rule the market with the most DSLR models under their individual belts. And they both compete in terms of feature set, image quality and price. So which brand's entry-level DSRLs is best for you?\n\nThat will be a personal choice. Both manufacturers have several excellent choices as you can see from our list above. Both have beginner DSLRs that are compact, easy to use and come with a plethora of lenses to support your growing passion for photography. A lot of them are also wallet-friendly, in case you're looking for a budget DSLR.\n\nThe only points of difference between the two are the external button layout and internal menu setup – they're different on Canon and Nikon. That said, both are user-friendly, so the ultimate choice will come down to which one suits you best.\n\nHow we test beginner DSLRs\n\nBuying a camera these days is a big investment, so every camera in this guide has been tested extensively by us. These days, real-world tests are the most revealing way to understand a camera's performance and character, so we focus heavily on those, along with standardized tests for factors like ISO performance.\n\nTo start with, we look at the camera's design, handling and controls to get a sense of what kind of photographer it's aimed at and who would most enjoy shooting with it. When we take it out on a shoot, we'll use it both handheld and on a tripod to get a sense of where its strengths lie, and test its startup speed.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, we use a formatted SD card and shoot in both raw and JPEG (if available). For burst shooting tests, we dial in our regular test settings (1/250 sec, ISO 200, continuous AF) and shoot a series of frames in front of a stopwatch to see if it lives up to its claimed speeds. We'll also look at how quickly the buffers clears and repeat the test for both raw and JPEG files.\n\nWhere applicable, we also test the camera's different autofocus modes in different lighting conditions (including Face and Eye AF) in single point, area and continuous modes. We also shoot a range of photos of different styles (portrait, landscape, low light, macro/close-up) in raw and JPEG to get a sense of metering and its sensor's ability to handle noise and resolve fine detail.\n\nIf the camera's raw files are supported by Adobe Camera Raw, we'll also process some test images to see how we can push areas like shadow recovery. And we'll also test its ISO performance across the whole range to get a sense of the levels we'd be happy to push the camera to.\n\nBattery life is tested in a real-world fashion, as we use the camera over the course of the day with the screen set to the default settings. Once the battery has reached zero, we'll then count the number of shots to see how it compares to the camera's CIPA rating. Finally, we test the camera's video skills (where necessary) by shooting some test footage at different frame rates and resolutions, along with its companion app.\n\nWe then take everything we've learned about the camera and factor in its price to get a sense of the value-for-money it offers, before reaching our final verdict.\n\nShould you buy a mirrorless camera over a DSLR?
