        "text": "It’s been quite long time since I planned to write this article, thought things would change for better, but time goes one, things remain the same…\n\nThe reasons why I love Nikon\n\nHi, Nikon! My name is Denis, I am your fan! My first camera was D90, it was the greatest camera I’ve used because that still had a screwdriver to make older lens AF work, this feature was almost the deal-maker since I wasn’t able to purchase new AF-S lens (yeah, poor kid, with great talent, deal with it).\n\nThe time goes by, now I am a grownup with nearly perfect job along with a great salary. So, I purchased a Nikon D750. Hell yes, the greatest thing I’ve ever played with (in the 1.5–2K USD price range). It is weather-sealed, solid body, good ergonomics, a new tilting screen did its job while I was shooting at weird angles, believe me. Camera’s sensor and the processor “EXPEED 4” did a great job at low light. Oh, and 2 SDHC card slots are extremely useful, I nearly forgot about syncing images to a hard drive often because my setup included 2 x 128Gb UHC high-speed SD cards. The most awesome feature for me was an ability taking photos in movie-mode (I recommend to learn more about that on the official Nikon’s website if you are not familiar with that), every image taken had that great scenic look, like in a movie due to the proportions (16x10 against 4x3 in photo-mode).\n\nAccording to DSLR camera market report, Nikon D750 was one of the most best-selling budget cameras among its direct competitors. So, yeah, I consider myself as the lucky one who owns this great camera! Within the bigger budget, you may find Nikon D5 that was a market-beating camera with tons of great features like:\n\nincluding fast autofocus contrast-based AF\n\nnew EXPEED 5 processor\n\ndual slot for 2 CF or 2 QXD cards\n\ninternal 4K UHD 30 FPS at 100Mb/s video capturing\n\n15 FPS in raw while shooting stills\n\nSo, the market found D5 to be the best sports camera for stills due to the high-speed shooting. Did Nikon D5 become the most selling camera? — No! Did Nikon D5 become the most versatile DSLR camera? — No! Did Nikon D5 become the best sports camera? — No! Excuse me, if D5 is none of this, so why should I spend nearly 7K USD on a camera that is not good?\n\nThe reasons why I hate Nikon\n\nThis is what I call “a blame-game”. My frustration starts here… First of all, I’d like to declare few statements why Nikon does its job badly:\n\nLenses. Pricey. Bad image quality production.\n\nD5 and D850 are bad cameras!\n\nVideo features are so bad! I bet Nikon’s cameras can be cheaper if they exclude those, because if you put a feature in your high-end cameras, that feature **MUST** be great, but not “almost-avarage-OK-for-fun-only”.\n\nOkay, now let’s try to describe each statement in details.\n\nLenses\n\nNikkor (sub-brand) is widely known as a good brand. It is kind of hard to find the poorly made lens, believe me, I’ve owned (or still own) the following lens:\n\nNikkor 14–24/f2.8 AF-S\n\nNikkor 24–70/f2.8 AF-S\n\nNikkor 85/f1.8 AF-S\n\nNikkor 85/f1.4 AF-S\n\nNikkor 50/f1.4 AF-D\n\nNikkor 50/f1.4 AF-S\n\nSo, if you use Nikon’s lens you might be aware of a golden ring collection lens (i.e., The Holy Trinity):\n\nNikkor 14–24/f2.8 AF-S\n\nNikkor 24–70/f2.8 AF-S\n\nNikkor 70–200/f2.8 AF-S\n\nAll of these lenses are pricey as hell, but I guess, I’m okay with that, just to make things clear, I have never seen or tested a wide-angle lens that is better than 14–24/f2.8. BUT! Nikko 24–70 /f2.8 is not good at all, an even it’s a newer version that comes with VR. Photographers buying and using Nikkor 70–200/f2.8 just for the portraits, but is very heavy and huge, as a frequent traveller I’d leave that lens at home, so, if that will stay at home forever, why do I need that lens? In my perfect Manfrotto Manhattan backpack, you might find Nikkor 14–24/f2.8 and Sigma Art 85/f1.4, despite the thing that I own Nikkor 24–70/f2.8 as well.\n\nI’m sorry for stepping aside from the original statement. The price of the Nikkor’s lenses is pretty high, however, the price is not the only criteria here, let’s add image quality as well.\n\nSo, how do I see an image quality? First of all — bokeh, it has to be creamy, it should be very good, it appears that none of Nikkor’s The Holy Trinity lens is good in terms of bokeh, but any prime lens starting from 85/f1.4 has nice bokeh, but the price for those lenses is very high, at most of the times I’d double checked whether I need a pricey lens if photography is my hobby but not a job I’ve been paid for. Sharpness, despite my expectations, almost all lenses at price lower than 1.3K has kind of doable sharpness, I expected to get a working diaphragm at f2.8, but how reckless I was! f4.0 to f8.0 or higher, just imagine what kind of bokeh you’d get that those values…\n\nNo more complains, sorry. As a photographer with a limited budget I do a lot of research on the particular lens I’d like to purchase. Every camera manufacturer has its own “recommended” lens to use, every brand has its own army of ambassadors who attempt to advertise camera and lens they’ve been given. But any other photographer who’s not committed to any brand does a lot comparison between the native lens (from Canon, Sony, Nikon, Lumix, etc.) and 3rd-party manufacturer lens (Sigma, Tamron, Samyang, etc).\n\nUnfortunately, in terms of price, built quality and image quality Nikon is no longer the most recommended lens for Nikon shooters. Let’s do a direct comparison between Nikon’s and Sigma’s Art prime lens:\n\nAs you probably mentioned, I’ve excluded “nifty-50” because Nikkor 50/f1.4G is not a “golden ring” lens, meaning that is a crappy piece of plastic. Unfortunately, I have no idea which lens I can compare to this one, even manual-focus Samyang is better.\n\nOkay, so, what we see here. According to my comparison, Nikon pushed their price for lenses up to the sky for no reason. Sometimes it’s just a matter of 3–5 hundreds USD, but in most cases, the price is twice higher compared to Sigma’s Art series which is weird as hell because Nikon can’t beat Sigma in final image quality for sure. I’m sorry, Nikon, but overpricing your own lens is not a successful market strategy.\n\nSo, consider me a Nikon fan, who disrespects Nikon due to their native lens pricing. The next topic is cameras, so let’s have some fun.\n\nWhat is Nikon D850?\n\nFor those of you who are not familiar with Nikon’s product design strategy, I’d like to highlight that Nikon D850 is a cheaper version of D5, at least this is what I thought it has to be initially.\n\nD850 is a new flagship camera model within the DXXX full-frame model line. Is it better than D810 — yes! But is it worth its money? — No.\n\nWe all understand that any manufacturer wouldn’t release a new camera that is a direct competitor to its high-end camera. Because why should I buy expensive (7K+ USD) when I can purchase the same features but in a smaller body, meaning I can take +1 lens with me.\n\nUnfortunately, Nikon did what they did. They took off couple major features of D5 like impressive FPS in raw, fast AF system (D850 has the same capabilities as D5 but much slower), took cheaper body (nearly the same as D810). Now tell me, are these missing features made D850 worth 3K+ USD? I’m sorry, I’m not buying.\n\nUnfortunately, Nikon did what they did.

Now tell me, are these missing features made D850 worth 3K+ USD? I’m sorry, i’m not buying.\n\nDirect competitors and perfect camera’s profile\n\nLet’s investigate DSLR/mirrorless market. Which cameras are direct competitors to D850:\n\nCanon 5D mark IV\n\nSony A7r mark III\n\nSony A9\n\nSo, how do you see the perfect profile of the camera you’d spend 3–3.5K USD? Let’s find out about it. Canon is well-known as rock-solid wedding camera that can do nice images in raw along with being capable to produce “almost-good” video quality, but still, misses picture profile in for the video mode, good AF features. Sony is a rock-star here: great images, internal high-resolution 4K recording, SLOG video profile gives an ability to use LUTs to make the video look amazing, amazing AF, but battery life is awful (700 shots or 1 hour of video per on a single).\n\nI found out that the best camera for my own needs is a camera with the following features:\n\nmoderate FPS in raw (i often to scenic shots, so, I don’t really care about sports and cases when I do need a blazingly fast AF)\n\nperfect weather-sealing, dust protection (shooting in the desert, in deep snow or somewhere in a hot place)\n\nhigh resolution (my current camera has 24MP, but I do enjoy the resolution of medium format cameras, maybe 36 to 52MP is my ideal case)\n\ngreat variety of picture profile for both photo and video (I often shoot in neutral profile, that’s the only good profile my camera has)\n\nlow light shooting (with Nikon D850 you can produce a clean image up until ISO 1000, after that it bad)\n\ninternal full-frame 4K 60FPS in Apple ProRes 422\n\ngood battery (Nikon’s batteries are really good, it took almost 3.3K shots to drain it, Sony’s batteries are the most awful ones here and most expensive as well)\n\nAF features (this is the most critical feature, among mentioned cameras, Nikon’s AF sucks as much as possible, it’s 2K18, who uses contrast-based AF… Sony has nearly perfect AF that provides phase detectors, eye tracking, face tracking, etc.)\n\ninternal body image stabilization (it seems like Nikon haven’t heard about that at all)\n\nAm I able say that Nikon D850 is a good camera? — No, it’s not even close. It misses good AF, it has awful video features, bad AF, what else? Can I recommend Nikon D850 to anyone? — No.\n\nAm I able say that Nikon D850 is a good camera? — No, it’s not even close. It misses good AF, it has awful video features, bad AF, what else? Can I recommend Nikon D850 to anyone? — No.\n\nProfit no longer the target?\n\nThat’s the major question. Nikon, why the profit is no longer a major target for the company? Among its competitors, Nikon D850 is the worst camera, how so? Within the price range Nikon D850 also is not a great choice, how so?\n\nThis paragraph would sound like a product pitch, but it’s not, it’s just a sane conclusion — Sony is the best choice on market within 3–3.5K USD by offering a great variety of photo and video features, but with moderate batteries, so, consider buying three of those. Most of Pro shooters will say that it’s not a valid comparison since Sony A-series is a mirrorless camera line, but not a DSLR, so it’s by default better due to the absence of family mirror problems. Well, maybe, but if a manufacturer would provide an open platform for lens developers there would be no problems with mirrors, for sure, am I wrong?\n\nMarket battle is almost lost, surrender, Nikon!\n\nEven taking into account that Nikon D850 is a top camera at DxOMark comparison along with Sony A9 in terms of image quality, it still may remain good photo camera, nothing else. However, the market goes towards versatile cameras which Sony already producing for nearly a decade, still, Nikon unable to provide a truly versatile camera, basically, you can get a photo camera with expensive useless video feature for fun.\n\nSo, Nikon, are you drunk? You lost the battle of “The Mirrorless”! With current zero offerings, Nikon would never be capable to enter a market with competitive offering to any of Sony’s cameras, unfortunately.\n\nMoreover, take a look at YouTube, what is the most versatile travel camera for Pro shooters? I was quite surprised by what I have seen there and I tend to agree that it’s an honest truth, the most versatile camera is the latest Canon 1Dx (it’s not D5, it’s not Sony A7s mark II), not D5 or D850.\n\nNikon, please tell me, what’s left? Cameras are not great among the competitors, lens are very expensive and produce the same quality comparing to twice-cheaper Sigma Art series.\n\nControversial Nikon mirrorless announcement\n\nA week ago (end of July 2018), Nikon publish press release of their efforts making totally new to them camera — first full-frame mirrorless camera.\n\nSo, I thought we, Nikon-ers, must be excited about that Nikon dropping new camera onto our heads and travel backpacks but are we? Somehow Nikon was able to get shit-wave as a feedback and here’s why:\n\nRumoured price. According to those the price for a new camera would be around 3–4K USD!\n\nNEW (!!!) bayonet. No more Nikon F, holy-molly! It means you’d need to get an adapter to make your AF-S lens to work and an obvious question is: what about the 3rd-party lens from Sigma Art, for instance? Would they work? How slow would an AF be? Would an adapter be shipped with the camera? And so on…\n\nIn order to predict specs of the new camera, we need to put that a direct competitor to Nikon’s top bodies: D5 (it can’t be better in terms of photo and AF, maybe better video features) and D850 (must be at least the same due to its price). So, my predictions are:\n\nthe same tilting screen as they have since D850\n\nbigger sensor (bigger than at D5)\n\nsame low light shooting capabilities as at D800 (best bet, as at D850)\n\nsame contrast-based AF system as at D850 (not as at D5 because it makes the mirrorless and D5 direct competitors)\n\n2 microSD slots\n\nEN/EL 5 batteries\n\nno rolling shutter effect\n\nshutter speed to be equal to 10–14 in RAW\n\nadditional control screen as they have at FF bodies\n\nshitty internal 4K at 100MBS, no Apple 422 (maybe super35 mode)\n\nBut the bigger issue is the rumored price, how Nikon can compete with Sony’s A-series with a price tag at least twice bigger when you’d get the most awful video features ever presented in modern digital photography?\n\nUnfortunate results\n\nPlease tell me, Nikon, what’s wrong with you? Within the previous year, you celebrated the 100th anniversary. All your fans expected to see something remarkable, but you proposed remastered versions of The Holy Trinity, nothing else. Literally, nothing was presented in Las Vegas during March 2018. Is it worth attending your booth at upcoming Photokina 2018? Or should I dump all my stuff to the aftermarket and buy Sony A9 or upcoming A7s mark III?\n\nAt this moment, I have no idea, but still, I do believe in Nikon, but my faith is no longer strong enough…"
