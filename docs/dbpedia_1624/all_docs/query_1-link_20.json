        "text": "Hi Demetrius!\n\nYour proposition would be my expectation. Canon are registering a bunch of new bodies (5?) and those will likely come with a suite of optics as well.\n\nIt has to come eventually - the point is this sort of delay is normal, it's just that the comparison with Sony's plethora of 3rd party lenses available now is compared to Canon and Nikon now, and that's not a fair comparison, given Sony's massive head start in the market.\n\nI cannot imagine the cost of developing the technology for a new platform in terms of the design, tooling and building, of cameras and lenses, and it's to be expected that the investing OEM will want to have the gear market to themselves for a while to get some of that back. That said, they aren't stupid, so they know they have to open the market up to let in 3rd parties at some stage.\n\nIt's interesting that Fuji, which has had their FX mount out for some time, has only now really allowed Tamron to make 3rd party lenses for their XT cameras, yet I see very little criticism of them - this higher level of criticism is what we in NZ call the 'tall poppy syndrome'. Not unlike the flak Microsoft has tended to get for being dominant in the PC field.\n\ncheers, TREVOR\n\nThe mark of good photographer is not what they hold in their hand, it's what they hold in their head;\n\n\"All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow\", Leo Tolstoy;\n\n\"Skill in photography is acquired by practice and not by purchase\" Percy W. Harris\n\nI think why Fuji isn't talked about as much is because they're more of a niche player. Compared to the top 3 camera makers those being Canon, Nikon and Sony. When you ask most people that are normal people that don't know much about cameras. When you ask them about camera manufacturers the 2 names they'll say are Canon and Nikon. Some will say Sony but when cameras come to mind its always Nikon and Canon. Before Sony the top 4 camera makers were Canon, Minolta, Nikon & Pentax. Sony was very small in the camera market when they bought the Minolta A Mount. Sony did admit it was out of touch with its customers when it came to the A Mount. They've had much more success with the E Mount system. Nikon has the largest mirrorless lens mount size with the new Z Mount system. Nikon's first attempts with mirrorless didn't start out too well at all. Their live view AF in their DSLRs weren't very good. It was quite slow even for motorized/ AF-S/ SWM (Silent Wave Motor) lenses. This caught up with Nikon and caused there new mirrorless system to suffer. Other things like Autoexposure which we've had for years didn't work either so did their i-TTL/ CLS flash system not work well. With Canon everything seemed to be a seamless transition other than a new RF Mount. Pentax has decided NOT to move mirrorless cameras and intends to continue making DSLR cameras. I've tried using Pentax's cameras but when it comes AF it's slow and behind the competition as far as DSLRs go. Pentax uses a weird hybrid AF system built into newer motorized lenses. The lenses contain an AF motor along with the ability to be focused by the motor in the camera body to retain compatibility with older DSLRs that can't AF motorized/ SDM lenses. The motors in these lenses have a high failure rate. These newer lenses will often cause the camera to switch back and forth between the lens motor and body motor when the lens motor fails. I expect the camera to autofocus when it is set to do so not play tug of war of which AF motor is used. There AF algorithms for motorized lenses are way behind everyone else and its very slow. Screw drive lenses seemed to do better in this respect but its also slower too.\n\n-Demetrius\n\nBodies: EOS 40D (Retired) & EOS 5D Mark IV (Current)\n\nLenses: EF Trinity, EF 50mm F/1.8 STM, EF 70-210mm F/4 (Brought out of Retirement) & EF 85mm F/1.8 USM\n\nSpeedlites: 470EX-AI & 600EX II-RT"
