        "text": "I don’t discuss politics much here and I won’t today either, but there has been a lot of talk lately about the US/Mexico border. I lived in Arizona for over three decades and visited the border quite a few times. Most of my trips were to the busy crossing at Nogales. Whenever friends or family would visit, we’d drive down from Phoenix, park in the Safeway parking lot near the border and cross into Mexico for some shopping. Mostly, we’d buy colorful blankets that were nice to look at but kinda scratchy to cuddle up with. Visitors also wanted to try a bottle of Coca-Cola in Mexico, which tastes sweeter than what we buy in the US. More syrup, I suppose.\n\nIn 2008, I spent a few days in Bisbee which is a quirky little southern Arizona town worth checking out, especially for photographers. One afternoon, I drove a few miles to the border near Naco, Sonora where I saw this border patrol agent sitting in his truck enjoying his lunch and watching the wall. We chatted a bit and I asked if I could snap this picture. I shot this with my Nikon D70s and a AF Zoom-Nikkor 24-120mm f/3.5-5.6D IF—a lens that gets mostly terrible reviews but served me well for years.\n\nI read a statistic that said 1 in 5 Americans pays for a self storage unit. I am one of them. Or at least I was until this past weekend. I’ve moved a couple of times in the last 14 years and during one of those moves, I rented a small storage unit for some of my stuff. It was only supposed to be short term. I remember thinking at the time that my stuff would be in there for six months or maybe a year until I could sort through it and figure out what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to throw away. Each month, when I wrote the check for the rent on Unit 129, I said to myself that I need to get over there and sort through that stuff. But my storage unit was 60 miles away and it just seemed easier to write the check and put it off for another day.\n\nThis past weekend, I finally confronted my procrastination. I rented a truck from U-Haul and to save my back, hired a young friend to help me load. It had been some time since I had been to my storage unit…years actually…and when I opened the door, I was overwhelmed by stacks of deteriorating cardboard boxes, cobwebs, mouse poop and dust covered artifacts. Stuff. Stuff that at one point I purchased with real money. Stuff that had meaning enough for me to keep and store and pay rent on. There were some things that were of real value. I had a large chest of tools. Good tools, tools I could use. There were some old pictures. An old Lionel train set that might be worth something. An orange Home Depot bucket. An extension cord on a retractable reel. Everything else in there had no real value, no use any more. It was trash. All trash.\n\nI walked around the heap of stuff, poking into dusty boxes, picking up this and that. I recognized everything around me and wanted to find some reason why I had saved this stuff, but I couldn’t. I was deeply disappointed in myself for neglecting this chore for so long and felt an intense and painful sadness as I looked over the relics of my life. I negotiated with my helper to load and haul everything to the landfill for me. Three full pickup truck loads. 80% of what I was paying to store went straight into the trash.\n\nI called the rental office at the storage facility yesterday and told them that I had vacated Unit 129. The woman thanked me for my business “all these years.” Just out of curiosity, I asked her how long I had rented there? “Since 2013”, she said.\n\n11 years…my God.\n\nI am currently shooting two cameras from the Nikon film era; the Nikkormat FTN from 1967 and the Nikon N90s from 1994. And while they are so very different from a technology standpoint—the Nikkormat is an all mechanical, manual focus, manual exposure camera while the N90s offers multiple exposure modes with matrix metering, motorized film advance and auto focus…they filled exactly the same niche nearly three decades apart—as back-up cameras for professional photographers.\n\nThe Nikon F was the preferred choice of photographers who made their living with their cameras in 1967. Nikon pro bodies have always been wildly expensive and while a well-heeled pro might have a second pro body as a back up, many used less expensive but still very capable bodies. The Nikkormat FTN was such a camera in the late 1960s. In the 70s, pros might have had a Nikon FM in their camera bag along side their F2.\n\nBy the 1990s, professional photographers were making the transition to auto focus cameras and Canon would soon capture the professional market with their EOS line. But for those who stuck with Nikon and Nikon’s first auto focus pro body—the F4, “pro-sumer” cameras like the N8008s and N90s became less expensive choices for a back-up. I purchased a N90s brand new in 1997 and I recall paying around $1000 for the camera and a 50mm f/1.8 kit lens. The F4 body alone was north of $2500.\n\nI purchased my Nikkormat at a local camera shop and after I got it home, I posted an image of my new acquisition on the Nikkormat/Nikomat Facebook group I belong to. Over the next few weeks, quite a few photographers gushed over the FTN and several pros told stories about using the sturdy, dependable Nikkormat as a back up to their F or F2. I had my FTN serviced and modified. You can read about that here.\n\nThe N90s is my latest camera purchase. Mine is nearly mint with its original box and paperwork. I joined the N90s/F90x Facebook group and as with the Nikkormat, several pros commented about using the N90s as a back up camera for weddings and sporting events. A few even said that the N90s was their main body— a bridge camera as they waited for Nikon to release the F5 in 1996.\n\nI will post complete reviews of both cameras here soon, but I will say that I am truly enjoying both of these Nikons. The FTN is pure, simple analog joy while the N90s feels a bit like coming home to a period in my life when I was shooting a lot of film and developing and printing in my home darkroom.\n\nThis is mostly a blog about photography. I write about old film cameras and having fun with them. Once in a while I stray and talk about the days when I used to work in radio and television, my experiences selling on eBay or even how rude people can be on social media. But mostly, it’s a blog about photography—my opinions and thoughts. I don’t always get it right but I try and do the best job I can with the information I present here.\n\nI never talk about my politics or even politics in general because I think your beliefs are your own personal thing. And whatever you believe, as long as it’s not hurting another person, is your own business.\n\nI start each workday the same way. I make myself a cup of coffee, open my laptop and catch up on the news. I used to get a morning paper and flip through that, but a good newspaper is hardly that anymore, so I click around two or three news websites, hit the shower and head to the office.\n\nLately, I find catching up on the news unsettling. It gives me a mild level of anxiety. I’m old enough to know that there’s always been bad news and conflict in the world, but it seems we’ve reached a point where the lines between fact and fiction, news and opinions, have become so blurred, it’s driving a level of discord I have never experienced in the six decades of my life. Back when I worked in broadcasting, anytime we put an opinion on air, we had to disclose it as “commentary.” That’s not the case anymore and lots of good people I know are digesting opinions as fact and that can be very dangerous in so many ways. What’s more troubling is when people in power believe in and make decisions based on the same misinformation.\n\nI am not going to stick my head in the sand, but I do need to modify my consumption of news for my own mental health. I am still figuring out what that’s going to look like. Many years ago, I was an avid watcher of the CBS News program Sunday Morning. Charles Kuralt or Charles Osgood would always close out the show by saying “Today, we leave you with….” followed by a few minutes of fields full of wildflowers with birds chirping or waves crashing on a beach. It was a way to say that even in this noisy world full of bad news, there are amazing and beautiful things, if we just take a few minutes each day to notice them.\n\nI just received my Nikkormat FTn back from a CLA and modification by my friend Jim Holman at International Camera Technicians in San Diego. I found this camera in my local camera shop and it was in lovely condition. Hardly a scratch anywhere with a very nice optics.\n\nI really like these Nikkormats. I own four now—this FTn, an EL, FT2 and FT3. Nikkormats were built during a time when a camera was designed to last. And you can really feel that, especially after a thorough service.\n\nIn addition to the CLA, I had Jim do some modifications on my FTn. My FTn is an early model which came with a matte fresnel focus screen with a central disc of of micro-prsims. My aging eye prefers a split-image screen. Nikon calls this a “K” screen. The focus screens were not interchangeable on the Nikkormats, but a skilled technician can swap them out during a CLA. However, I had to find a donor camera. The Nikkormat FT2 and FT3 came standard with a split-image screen, but I really wasn’t keen on spending the money that these models were fetching just to harvest a focus screen. As I was doing my research, I discovered that later in the production run of the FTn, Nikon offered a K screen option—buyers could order their camera with either a matte fresnel screen or the split-image one. These later cameras also had a plastic tipped film advance and self-timer levers (just like the Nikon F Apollo and F2 cameras). Since “parts only” FTn bodies were selling on eBay for $20-$40, my mission became finding one of these later cameras that had been ordered with the K screen.\n\nThis kind of stuff takes patience, but it’s fun. Each day, I scoured the eBay listings for parts only FTn bodies with the plastic tipped levers. Sellers rarely take photos of their viewfinder, so I had to contact the sellers and ask. Finally one day, a listing popped up for a camera in pretty sad shape—missing the film rewind crank among other things. What caught my eye was that this camera came in its original box.\n\nYou control all of the camera’s functions with a thumbwheel and most photographers can figure out how to drive the N8008S pretty quickly without looking at the owner’s manual. Film loading is easy, just drop in a film cartridge, pull the leader over the red line, close the back and tap the shutter release once. The Nikon advances the film to the first frame. Depending on the mode you choose, the N8008S can burn through a roll of film in as fast as 3.3 frames per second.\n\nThe N8008S is not a camera for someone who wants to fully immerse themselves in full manual control of their photography. Rather, this is a camera that you relax and just have fun with. Put it in program mode and let the camera do all of the heavy lifting for you and just click away. By the time this camera came out, Nikon had really nailed TTL metering and I had a hard time coming up with a situation where the N8008S didn’t deliver near perfect exposure. Over a couple of weeks, I shot two expired rolls of film—some Fuji 400 and Kodak T-Max 100. I used the Nikkor zoom and my 50mm f/1.8 AF-D lens. Here’s puppy day at our local park.\n\nOver the past 15 years of serious film photography, there have been several cameras that I initially dismissed because the ones I tried were not functioning as they were designed. My first Pentax Spotmatic was a corroded mess. My first Olympus OM-1 had a gummed up film advance due to years of neglect. And my first Minolta SR-T, a 101 model if I recall, had a dead meter, lots of debris in the viewfinder and a gritty feeling film advance. When you’re buying decades old film cameras online and learning as you go, you’re going to buy a few duds. It’s part of the game. And sometimes, those bad experiences color your opinion about a camera. Luckily, I bought another Spotmatic and had Eric Hendrickson service it. A lovely camera. Same with the OM-1. Found another and sent it off to John Hermanson. A CLA’d OM-1 is a joy to shoot.\n\nAnd now for Minolta. Recently, a stunning black body SR-T 202 showed up for sale from one of my trusted eBay sellers, freshly CLA’d for a good price. I’m a sucker for black body SLRs and this one, with a six-month warranty, seemed like a good investment.\n\nThe Minolta SRT series ran from 1966 to 1981. There are many different models with confusing numbers. My camera, the SR-T 202 was also called the SR-T 303b and SR505, depending on what country you purchased the camera in. All of these cameras are manual focus, manual exposure cameras with TTL metering. Some featured Minolta’s exclusive CLC metering system. CLC stood for Contrast Light Compensator, sort of an early version of matrix metering. The camera had two metering cells rather than just one giving the photographer more precise control over exposure. Or so the manual says.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my SR-T 202 to arrive, I did some research on early Minolta manual focus lenses and found that the MC-Rokkor-PF 58mm f/1.4 had great reviews. Not only was the lens a stellar performer optically, many photographers raved about how nice this lens was to use. I found a seller online who specializes in this particular lens, services and sells them. My new lens and camera arrived within days of each other.\n\nThe SR-T 202 is a big, heavy brick of a camera. There a no contours or curves, little in the way of ergonomics. By comparison, while my Minolta X-700 which came out in 1981 fits my hand like a glove, this camera felt a bit awkward. I also found the strap lugs to be in a weird place, poking my fingers as I shot. As I worked my way through my test roll of Kodak Tri-X, the camera and I made friends and I found some hand and finger positions that felt comfortable.\n\nI recall having a conversation with a professional event photographer friend of mine in the mid-1990s. He was probably in his mid-60s at the time and had just traded in his Nikon F3 bodies for a pair of Nikon N8008s auto-focus cameras. I remember him saying that he would have probably shot those F3s forever if his eyesight wasn’t beginning to fail him. Retirement wasn’t an option, he told me, so auto-focus allowed him to continue earning a living. Luckily, I don’t earn my living with my photography and my +1.50 readers are fine for computer work, reading and other close-up tasks. But I have been struggling a bit with my manual focus cameras lately making me regret selling my last two auto-focus cameras late last year. I have a Fujifilm X-T1 for digital photography, but I started yearning for another auto-focus film body.\n\nI considered all of the usual suspects…Nikon F4, F5, N90s…or perhaps I might even begin a journey into Canon auto-focus film bodies. I browsed eBay and also kept my eye on the used gear case at my local camera store. Over the course of a couple of weeks, two cameras appeared there; a Nikon N8008s, which I felt was a nod to my aforementioned photographer friend and a Contax N1. I was very familiar with the Nikon but knew nothing about the N1. The N8008s was a steal for under a hundred bucks complete with a Nikkor 28-85mm f/3.5-4.5 AF-D zoom. The Contax body, which was new old stock, in its original box and with the “remove before shooting” insert still in the film chamber. The N1 cost me $200.\n\nThe Contax N1 was one of the last film cameras manufactured by Kyocera who, throughout the 1990s, built some brilliant Contax 35mm SLRs. I had a Contax RX for several years and loved that camera along with its amazing Carl Zeiss lenses. You can read my review of the RX here.\n\nThe N1 was introduced in 2000, aimed at professional photographers. A pro-sumer model, the NX came out about the same time. In 2002, Contax released the N Digital, the first professional digital SLR with a full frame sensor. Kyocera would halt all camera production a few years later in 2005. Unlike earlier Contax cameras which used the Contax/Yashica (C/Y) mount lenses, the N1, NX and N Digital used the new N mount glass. In cooperation with Carl Zeiss, Contax released a few prime lenses for the N cameras and several zooms:\n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 17-35mm F/2.8\n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 24-85mm F/3.5-4.5\n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 28-80mm F/3.5-5.6\n\nCarl Zeiss Planar T* 50mm F/1.4\n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 70-200mm F/3.5-4.5\n\nCarl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 70-300mm F/4.0-5.6\n\nCarl Zeiss Planar T* 85mm F/1.4\n\nCarl Zeiss Makro-Sonnar T* 100mm F/2.8\n\nCarl Zeiss Tele-Apotessar T* 400mm F/4\n\nWhile I easily stumbled across the N1 body at a good price, finding an affordable lens, I would soon discover, would be much more difficult. I have always been a prime lens guy and really like 50mm. With that in mind, I started my N mount search looking for a 50mm Carl Zeiss Planar, which I had owned before in C/Y mount with my Contax RX. All of the N mount Planars I found were between $700 and $1000…way out of my budget. After some research, I found that the two Vario-Sonnar mid-range zooms were closer to my price range and would give me the 50mm focal length as well as wide-angle and medium telephoto. The 28-80 was the most affordable and also offered me macro capability. Interestingly, the only Contax N mount lenses I could find for sale in any focal length were from Japanese sellers. I’ve purchased several cameras and a few lenses from Japan and have always had good luck, so after finding a 28-80 from a seller with lots of good reviews and a 100% rating, I pulled the trigger. One of the things I find very cool about buying from Japanese sellers on eBay is that shipping is usually free and the items arrive here in California in 2-3 days via FedEx, as was the case with my lens.\n\nWith all of the anticipation of a kid at Christmas, I eagerly unwrapped my lens and mounted it to my N1 body, inserted the big 6v Lithium 2CR5 battery and turned on the camera. Everything came to life except…the auto-focus lens wouldn’t auto-focus. I fiddled with switches and knobs and poured over the owner’s manual. In manual focus mode, everything worked fine. The lens focused manually and the focus confirmation indicator in the viewfinder worked as designed. I was stumped. Was it the lens or was it the camera? While you can find oodles of information about Nikon or Canon camera issues online, there’s not much out there on the Contax N1 or these lenses. I called the camera shop I bought it from and they just shrugged…”Can’t say what the problem might be. Maybe the camera body, maybe the lens. That’s the first Contax camera we’ve ever had in the store. You’re a great customer. You can return it for a full refund if you want.” I really liked the N1 and because it was hardly used, if at all, my hunch told me the fault was in the lens, not the camera body. I contacted the seller in Japan and told him that the lens would not auto-focus. The seller was responsive and kind, suggesting I try this and try that before initiating a return. The one forum I found on these lenses mentioned that it could possibly be a stripped focus gear. After a few days of back and forth messages, I mentioned the stripped gear idea to the seller and he authorized the return for a full refund. Back online, I found another 28-80 from a different Japanese seller and three days later, I was once again unwrapping and eagerly mounting a lens to my N1. This time…bingo! The lens auto-focused like a dream!\n\nThe N1 is a feature-packed camera. Multiple shooting modes including manual, aperture and shutter priority and a fully automatic program mode. Multiple metering patterns too. Shutter speeds from 4 seconds up to `1/8000th of second. Exposure compensation, multiple drive and auto-focus modes, selectable auto-focus points, manual focus assist and probably more things once I read the entire owners’s manual.\n\nI am a member of several vintage camera and general photography groups on Facebook and there are two “conversations” that always amuse me.\n\nThe first is around the subject of mechanical cameras that require no batteries and those that do. I am fascinated by the numbers of photographers who go on and on about how mechanical cameras that do not require batteries are so much better than those that require batteries for their shutters or metering. The standard line is that if you are out in the field shooting with a purely mechanical camera, you’ll never have to be concerned about not being able to take a photograph because your battery died. Honestly, I’ve been taking pictures with film cameras since 1975 and I have never had a battery give up on me while out shooting. And even if that happened, I always have a spare in my camera bag. I mean, how hard is it to carry around a little button cell battery? I pay far more attention to the battery level in my Fujifilm X-T1 or even in my iPhone than I ever have with any old film camera. But I digress.\n\nThe other Facebook interaction, which happens often whenever I post a picture of one of my cameras with a UV filter on the lens, are comments around my use of protective filters. “Please take that filter off of that lens!” Or, “Beautiful lens ruined by that filter—take it off now!” If I engage in any of these conversations, most of these people tell me how clear protective filters degrade the image quality or cause reflections. It is possible that adding another piece of glass in front of a lens might degrade the image quality in some barely perceptible way, but in all my years of photography, I’ve never noticed it or had any problems with reflections.\n\nI take a great deal of care in finding nice examples of lenses for my cameras and feel that a clear protective filter is cheap protection for my investment. If I get dust on my filter, it’s easy to clean and I don’t worry about leaving cleaning marks on the front element of an expensive lens. I see so many otherwise fine old lenses for sale on eBay that have cleaning marks and scratches on them.\n\nSo, I use protective filters on my lenses. Do you?\n\nI first read the phrase “looking for light” on the blog of my photography friend, Amanda Creamer. Amanda creates some stunning, dreamy images with her film and digital cameras. I loved “looking for light” so much, I wrote and asked her if I could borrow it and use it here from time to time. Photography is, at its very basic level, the art, application, and practice of creating images by recording light. As a photographer, I find myself looking at the world around me in terms of light and shadows.\n\nRight now, I am focusing my efforts and honing my skills in black and white photography, but not too long ago, my wife and I spent a lovely weekend up the California coast near Mendocino. I brought my Nikkormat FT3 and Pentax Spotmatic with me, both loaded with black and white film. We stayed at the Little River Inn just south of Mendicino and on our first night, we had dinner in the hotel’s restaurant. Our host seated us at a table with a view of the Pacific. It was the magic hour and as I looked out the window, I was awed by the palette of colors. After many years of living at the coast, my experience is that my iPhone rarely gets it right, but this night it sure did. The sky, the ocean and the artificial light from the porch of the Inn all worked together, perfectly. Even the reflection of the restaurant’s chandelier in the upper left is a nice touch I think. I make it a practice not to bring my phone with me for relaxing dinners out, but on this night, I am glad I broke my rule.\n\nI consider the 1970s the golden age of 35mm SLRs. Canon, Minolta, Pentax, Olympus and Nikon were all in fierce competition to create the very best machines possible. Photographers benefited from this competition with a wide choice of great cameras and amazing lenses. This was still the era of mostly metal and glass and a testament to the quality of camera manufacturing from this time is the fact that many of these machines remain viable, functioning and serviceable today.\n\nI stumbled across this nice example of a Nikkormat EL in my local camera shop. I went to browse on my lunch hour and walked out with a new camera and a thinner wallet. The Nikkormat EL was introduced in 1972 and was one of Nikon’s first attempts at a camera with an electronically controlled shutter and aperture-priority auto exposure. Around the same time, an all-black body ELW was available which is the same camera with the exception of its ability to add an AW-1 auto winder. The EL is a pre-AI body which means that Nikkor lenses need to be manually indexed to the body using the Nikon twist; move the body indexing pin all the way over to the right (looking at the camera body), set the aperture on the lens to f/5.6, mate the lens to the body and then twist the lens to its smallest aperture and then to its widest. This sounds way more complicated than it is but necessary so the camera “knows” which lens you have on. Everything after that is typical 1970s SLR.\n\nThe EL is basically a large Nikon FE. The viewfinder read out is the same as the FE and FE2 with a big analog needle. This display is my favorite of all of the Nikon SLRs of this era—it’s easy to read and makes total sense. Other than having to index the lens to the camera, the EL’s other quirk is the battery. The EL takes a type PX28/4LR44/544 battery which looks like a little AA battery. The battery chamber is behind the mirror so you need to take off the lens and lift the mirror to insert the battery.\n\nMy EL is almost pristine. I cannot see any scratches or scuffs anywhere. I wonder if it was ever used? As I inspected the body inside and out, I did notice the seals were original and deteriorating pretty badly which is pretty common for a 50+ year old camera. My plan was to put a test roll through the EL and see if everything else was working and if I enjoyed shooting it. If it passed those tests, I’d sent it out for new seals and a general look-over.\n\nI found a roll of Kodak Portra 400 in the back of my fridge and shot it over a weekend in March. I rated the film at 200 ISO which I always do with Portra 400. On a walk around my neighborhood, I discovered some spring color.\n\nI had big plans to take my Nikon FE everywhere with me for a couple of weeks as I tried my first roll of Ferrania P33 black and white negative film. I had been reading good things about this film and wanted to give it a proper test drive. Fate had other ideas. A friend was looking for a nice FE and asked if I would sell mine. Just about the time I was asking if I could finish off the roll of film I had in the camera, he sent the PayPal payment. So, I clicked off a half a roll at my desk and around the house, rewound the film and packed up his camera.\n\nFerrania P33 is an ISO 160 film manufactured by Film Ferrania, an Italian company that has been making film since 1923. Film Ferrania calls P33 “a breakthrough in black and white photography blending innovation and tradition.” From the few shots I made with my test roll, mostly close ups of some of my gear on the white surface of my home office desk, P33 may become my go-to black and white film. I like it a lot.\n\nThe film has very little grain and and a pleasing range of tones; inky blacks, subtle mid-ranges and crisp whites. The speed of this film is perfect for me as I shoot a lot of 100 speed black and white film. Kodak’s Plus-X Pan 125 was one of my favorite films when it was in production, so P33 hits a special sweet spot for me. At $11.99 per roll, Ferrania P33 falls right into line with a number of similar black and white emulsions. I liked it so much, I ordered a few more rolls from Freestyle Photo. I am excited to try more.\n\nI’ve always had a fear of electronic flash photography and I admit, it was a fear of the unknown. My experience with flash photography was limited to flashcubes on Kodak Instamatic cameras, flashbars on Polaroid instant cameras and the SB-24 Nikon Speedlight I bought for my Nikon N90s back in the 1990s. I never got good pictures from any of those set-ups, mostly because I really didn’t know what I was doing. Many years ago, a friend hired me to shoot his wedding. To this day, I still cannot figure why he did or moreso, why I agreed to do it considering I didn’t have a clue. It was an outdoor daytime wedding and the available light stuff was pretty acceptable. The few flash shots with my N90s and Speedlight were horrible. The marriage didn’t last but my friend, who is still my friend, said it had nothing to do with my photographs. Thank goodness for that.\n\nThe rest of my portfolio of flash photographs consisted of over-exposed and washed out shots of my kid’s birthday parties or similar results from other family gatherings. I don’t think I had ever taken a flash photograph that I have been happy with. My history, coupled with what I perceived as the complicated process of achieving good results with flash, has contributed to my fear.\n\nA recent acquisition of a Fujifilm X-T1 digital camera prompted me to starting wondering again about trying some flash photography. With the X-T1, I could experiment, learn and see my results immediately rather than incur the expense of film and processing while I fumbled my way around. I was also very curious about off-camera flash, both for still subjects and maybe even some portraiture. The most important part of this fear-conquering journey was not spending tons of money doing it. So I began my research and ended up going back in time 50 years.\n\nThe Vivitar 283 electronic flash was introduced in 1970 and quickly became the most popular professional and advanced amateur flash of its day. Vivitar sold more than 3 million units by 1973 and the 283 remained in production, on and off, for nearly 30 years. The power and dependability of the 283 along with a wide range of accessories, made it the choice of wedding and studio photographers. Because of the vast numbers of 283s produced and their outstanding reliability, you can pick one one up today for around $10, which is what I did. Mine came in its original box with instructions and shows little signs of use. The day mine came, I quickly installed four AA batteries, turned it on and pushed the test button. It worked!\n\nA family member wanted some portraits taken for a work project. I knew I could get some decent available light shots outdoors with my X-T1, but I thought this might also be a good time to experiment with off-camera fill flash using the 283, VP-1 and my camera set on manual mode. I set the camera to 200 ISO and the shutter speed to the camera’s 180th of a second synch speed. It was a bight sunny day. I put the tripod-mounted flash off to one side of my subject. Full power was way too much but as I dialed the output power back to 1/16th of full, the results were outstanding. I shot a series of portraits which looked amazing. My subject has not given me permission to share those headshots at this point, but I intend to shoot some more I can share here with permission as well as enlisting Orvie, my Golden Retriever, who loves to pose for portraits.\n\nThe Vivitar 283 also gave me an opportunity to try out my Minolta IV-F Autometer, taking flash readings. I connected the Minolta meter to the flash using a PC synch chord, held the meter near my subject pointing back towards the camera. Pressing the button to take the reading fires the flash, giving me the proper exposure setting. I did feel kind of like a pro photographer with the Minolta Autometer dangling from my neck.\n\nWhen I began dabbling in analog photography again in 2010, I started writing my thoughts about the old cameras I was trying in a paper journal. A few years after that, I launched a Flickr account and began sharing pictures of my old cameras and the photographs I made with them. Other Flickr members commented on my gear or complimented my photos and that felt good. I enjoyed the connection with other photographers. About the same time I launched my Flickr account, I came across Jim Grey’s Down The Road blog. As I browsed through his posts, I found we were on similar paths, navigating life after the end of difficult marriages and discovering the joys of old cameras. Jim’s blog became an inspiration for me to start one of my own.\n\nI began the blog over on WordPress in 2014. I lived in Bodega Bay, CA then. Bodega Bay is often foggy. Sometimes the sun would break through the fog in interesting ways. These bright or clear spots in breaking fog are known as fogdogs. Photography has been, in one way or another, always a part of my life. During some very dark and difficult times, it was my way of coping, giving me a bright and clear path forward. I decided to call my online place The Fogdog Blog.\n\nFor a reason I cannot even remember now, I became frustrated with WordPress, had a tantrum and moved my blog over to Squarespace in 2015 where it lives today.\n\nI do admit, there have been times when I have considered turning the thing off, but then someone will comment on a post or send me a nice note through email telling me that they Googled a certain old camera and found the site and how helpful my information was to them. Or that they enjoyed one of my photographs. And even though I’ve never really worked at building an audience, it is gratifying to see some of my camera reviews show high up in the search rankings.\n\nHonestly, the best part of all of this are the friends I’ve made here. Kind, thoughtful, curious, generous people who all share a love of analog photography. Thank you, all.\n\nThis is not a proper review of Rollei’s RPX 400 black and white film. This is a grumbly review because while shooting this roll during my recent weekend in Mendocino, my Pentax Spotmatic decided to jam up on me. The film advance just stopped dead winding from one shot to the next. Grrrrr! I got about a dozen frames into the roll. Rather than tear up the sprocket holes, I rewound the film back into the canister and called it a day. Oddly enough, when I got back home and fiddled with the Spottie, everything seemed fine.\n\nRollei RPX 400 is a high speed black and white negative film that was recommend to me by fellow photographer Gregory Gross. It’s distributed by Maco (Hans O. Mahn GmbH & Co. KG, Maco Photo Products), a Germany-based supplier of photographic films and chemicals, licensing the Rollei brand name. The company says that Rollei RPX 400 is a new film that is based off of the original Agfa APX emulsion. Some digging revealed that this film is most likely made by Ilford. Whatever the truth, I loved the old Agfa APX 100 film and was anxious to try RPX 400 and the slower, finer grained RPX 100. I only wish my Spotmatic would have cooperated.\n\nHere are the frames that were salvageable.\n\nI’ve been on a bit of a Nikkormat kick recently and picked up a very nice, nearly new in appearance FTn body for cheap. The FTn, like many of the vintage cameras I have used over the years, has a micro prism focusing screen that is not interchangeable by the photographer. My aging eyes prefer a split image screen so I’ve managed to have several of my old cameras modified from micro prism to split image. Eric Hendrickson modified my Pentax Spotmatic SP and K2 bodies during a CLA which greatly improved the user experience for me.\n\nI am currently running a test roll of Kodak Tri-X through the Nikkormat. I’ll post a full review once I’ve finished and developed the roll, but I will say that this is quite an enjoyable camera to use. I think these Nikkormats are often overlooked for sexier cameras and that’s a shame. Although it’s a heavy camera, there’s really nothing not to love about a Nikkormat.\n\nTo make this camera a true keeper, I do want to invest in some modifications. First, the FTn uses banned 1.35v 625 Mercury batteries. For my test roll, I’m using a 1.5v 625 alkaline cell. Many FTn users say there’s really no difference with forgiving print film, but I’ll want to have this camera’s meter modified to use the 1.5v battery nonetheless.\n\nIn addition to the battery mod, I would really love to have a split image focusing screen installed. This is definitely a job for a skilled tech, so I’ve reached out to Jim Holman at ICT to do a CLA, the battery mod and the focus screen swap. In order to do that, I needed to find a donor camera with a split image screen.\n\nThere are always quite a few Nikkormat FTn bodies for sale on eBay, but it’s difficult to find one that has a split image screen. The screens from the later FT2 and FT3, which are split image, will work in the FTn but those bodies are more expensive…more than I wanted to invest just to harvest the focus screen. I discovered during my “research” that the later FTn bodies with a plastic tip film advance and self-timer levers from the F2, often came with the split image screen, also called the “K” screen. Since most of the listings did not mention what type of screen was installed and none of them had pictures that included a clear shot of the screen, I had to contact the buyers and ask.\n\nAfter several weeks of browsing, I came across a “parts only” FTn that came with its original box and sticker on the rewind lever that identified this camera as having the Nikon K screen. I offered the seller $20 for the camera and the offer was accepted."
