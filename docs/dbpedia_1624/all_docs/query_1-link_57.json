        "text": "Michael Spady says:\n\nI have been using Nikons only for about a year and a half. I use a D500 and a D7500 (which is kind of a more budget-minded D500). Both models have served me well. The reason I switched from Pentax to Nikon was not image quality. I still own a Pentax K-3 with a 50mm 2.8 Macro, and it still performs as well as ever. I had become interested in avian photography, and found that Pentax's autofocus system was not adequate to track birds in flight.\n\n47 months ago\n\nMichael Spady says:\n\nI know people who use D800s, D810s, and D7200s; they create excellent images and are happy with those models. I started with Nikon when the D500 had become very popular with wildlife photographers, and have never used the older ones. I might go for a D750 to use the full size format, and to get more coverage from my wide angles. Some day I would like to use a 10-20 that is really a 10-20mm. On the other side of the coin,, my 200-500 shoots like it was a 300-750 on my crop sensor bodies.\n\n47 months ago\n\nOrbmiser says:\n\nWent up thru the ranks D40 in 2008 D80 then D200 and D90 in 2011 which was my Main for 8 years. Tho still miss my D200 as had the last great CCD sensor that gave more natural colors and light straight out of the camera.\n\nMade great images on my D40 thru the D90 and wouldn't hesitate shooting a D200 again. Tho last few years was giving mirroless 4/3rds a go with a used EM-1 mark I eventually moved back to Nikon with my present D500 setup.\n\nCamera's are just tools and handled correctly and working around their inherit limitations is the goal in creating outstanding images. Just comes down to the model that covers your type of shooting. Can even see giving Fx a go with a old D700 or D750.\n\nAs age of camera has less to do with creating outstanding images.\n\nOriginally posted 47 months ago.\n\nOrbmiser edited this topic 47 months ago.\n\neasy reading [deleted] says:\n\nThom Hogan of www.dslrbodies.com wrote a great article a few years ago on this very same subject.\n\nCheck it out here: www.dslrbodies.com/newsviews/nikon-2017-news/may-2017-nik...\n\nHe makes some valid points but I would add that the camera that you have in your hands now is better than the one you don't own yet. You only have to look at the great reviews of \"early\" cameras and see how they were hailed as great image makers. As the years have passed these cameras are not any less capable, its just that the newer bodies are more capable. You can look through Flickr and see great images captured with all sorts of cameras, both new and old.\n\nPersonally, I still enjoy shooting with my D300s bodies. I would buy a D3s if it could be repaired if it broke. They are still too expensive to gamble my money on if it stopped working.\n\n47 months ago\n\njacklowry47 says:\n\nGingerBeard118:\n\nPhotographers are supposed to be creative people, so you could have any cameras from as far back as you can go, if needed, all the way back to the first Nikon DSLR camera (assuming it's still compatible with current software).\n\nAs Gunny Highway (played by Clint Eastwood) in Heartbreak Ridge would say...\n\n\"You adapt. You overcome. You improvise.\"\n\nSometimes some people don't care about the image quality of the photo, as long as they get to see the subject of the photo. Some people can't tell the difference.\n\nSo, it's up to you.\n\n46 months ago\n\neasy reading [deleted] says:\n\nGood points\n\nI would add that for many (most?) people that never print wall size prints and only share their images on Social Media or perhaps an HDTV, the earliest, lowest resolution cameras can still provide a more than adequate solution.\n\nI tell people that they should never upgrade their cameras or their lenses until the gear they have no longer lets them deliver the results they want. If you are shooting action sports in low light you need the best sensors and fastest lenses. If your needs are more \"pedestrian\" you can get by with just about any \"modern\" DSLR. In fact, you can get great bargains on \"old\" cameras that everyone traded up from. Its not a bad thing.\n\nOriginally posted 46 months ago.\n\neasy reading edited this topic 46 months ago.\n\nWolfBlass1 says:\n\nI use a D700, D7100 or D300 for a photo day out but generally a D5300 and a 16-85mm Nikkor for holidays. I just love the small, lightweight body and I find the 16-85mm covers the majority of situations without having to change lenses. The D7100 is still a lovely camera with its 24mp Toshiba sensor capable of great images, especially when paired with the pro grade 17-55mm DX 2.8 Nikkor. Images really are excellent. Does massive numbers of megapixels matter ? probably not, as my most notable image which is hung as a canvass in a hotel restaurant was taken some years ago with a 10 mp D80 and an 18-70mm non VR lens !\n\n45 months ago\n\nFrankie The Photog says:\n\nA camera is a camera is a camera. I just got some great images out of my D200 a few months ago. I use a camera daily and professionally that was introduced in 2013 (the first gen Sony A7). I also adore my Fuji XT-1 (came out in 2014). Camera manufacturers have done a great job at making us all think that the camera in our hand is JUNK and we NEED that new shiny DFX-29 or whatever. WE DON'T. What we need to do is get out and shoot. I'm not saying Im above camera lust, but its usually some USED body thats $600. It will be a cold day in hell before I pay over $2K for a camera body again. Getting 80-90% of the same features as NEW for 1/2 (of less) the price is just the smart way to go. Don't believe the hype!\n\nSide Note: My images out of the D200 gave a look that I havent been able to achieve with other cameras. Maybe because it was the last Nikon to use a CCD sensor.\n\n45 months ago\n\neasy reading [deleted] says:\n\nYou are right on target. You only have to take a look at the reviews of older cameras when they first came out to see the \"experts\" praise the picture taking capabilities of the newest DFX-01. Every iteration of camera technology brings new capabilities to the photographer but unless you really need those specific capabilities you are paying for tech you aren't using. That \"old\" DFX-01 doesn't get worse; its just that newer cameras get somewhat better.\n\nI tell anyone that asks me: \"Don't upgrade your gear until it is no longer capable of giving you the images you want of expect.\" Otherwise it's just a waste of money.\n\nI started with a Nikon D40 and moved up to a D200 when I wanted (and needed) higher resolution, giving up the 1/500 flash synch speed in the D40 (sigh). The D200 served me well for several years. I started to shoot my son's cycling and found the fps and AF tracking not fully up to the task and moved up to the D300s which I still consider a very fine, very capable camera (I have two). I would still be shooting with the D300s bodies if my other son didn't start playing indoor volleyball in dimly lit high school gyms. That tired old D300s sensor just couldn't handle the high ISO settings I really needed to shoot at the speeds I needed to really stop action. I needed a camera with a modern sensor capable of high ISO values so I bought a used D500.\n\nAnd now that COVID-19 has killed of most spectator sports I haven't even had a chance to try out that D500 in the gym.\n\nBut I must admit it works great for outdoor volleyball!\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/77279817@N07/48231961807/in/album-72157709511870072/]\n\n45 months ago\n\nphill_dixon says:\n\nI have a D5100 in the boot of my car with a 55-300 DX as a what-if.\n\nI have the D5, D850 and D500 for planned stuff.\n\nCouple of years back saw a goshawk so found a layby and went to photograph. There was a guy there already stomping about huffing and puffing.\n\nI was quieter, got closer and snapped a couple of nice shots.\n\nWhen it flew off he bowls over with big lens and kit and starts giving me the spiel of bad light, etc... his shots were awful on very expensive kit.\n\nHe then takes out his phone and shows me his shots from Indonesia, because the D5100 images are better. So I start showing him some of mine from there, Africa and the like and asking where he went. He seems agitated and keeps looking at my camera and then his kit.\n\nThe goshawk returned and he goes back into the routine of messing with menus and buttons and faffing. Everything but shooting.\n\nSo I stopped him, spent next hour sorting his stance, positioning and getting him to just take photos and read the viewfinder. His photos were much better once he forgot about all the settings and options and concentrated on the basics.\n\nUpshot if you do the basics well you get good results, and all the tech in the world can't fix that.\n\n43 months ago\n\neasy reading [deleted] says:\n\nGreat points I look at some spectacular streams on Flickr and then find that the amazing landscapes I am enjoying were shot by someone with a D3300 and a kit lens. Other times I view stunning work to see that it was shot with a cell phone camera.\n\nI have a friend, a retired Full Colonel, who can buy whatever gear he wants, and does. He and his wife travel all over the American Southwest shooting the National Parks and then make beautiful picture books for friends and family. As I flipped through his latest album (shot with a D850 and all sorts of high end glass) I stopped at a double paged panoramic spread of his wife and daughter walking thru the Garden of the Gods. When I expressed envy and admiration for the shot and asked him what he shot it with he sheepishly replied, \"My iPhone.\"\n\nSometimes the right gear helps make the picture but as always, it's the skill of the photographer that makes it great.\n\n43 months ago\n\neasy reading [deleted] says:\n\nAgain, great points. I was friends with a fellow Flickr photographer who did all her work with her cell phone. When she asked for advice on what sort of camera to buy I suggested a used Nikon D3200 and kit lens, about $300 at the time. I told her that it would get her started in serious photography and if she didn't like it she could sell the kit for pretty much what she paid for it.\n\n\"We don't do used and we don't don't do beginner\" she told me as she bought a new D750 and 24-120 zoom.\n\nShe was thrilled when she got it but I kept looking for work shot with this high end gear but never saw anything in her stream. When I asked about it she sheepishly responded that the gear was \"too big, too heavy and too complicated\" to carry around all the time she didn't like to use it.\n\n43 months ago\n\nWolfBlass1 says:\n\nYes Keith, I agree with the statement of yours. I have NEVER bought a new DSLR, mainly due to high prices and certainly don't think that I personally am missing out on the very latest technology. I certainly look through the camera menus and sub menus but don't change much after my initial settings. Don't get me wrong, I'm like a kid in a sweetshop going into a camera shop but at the end of the day, decent camera, good glass and, unless you start 'pixel peeping' your images can match that of the latest model costing hundreds more.\n\n43 months ago\n\nPatrick Vierthaler (using albums) says:\n\nI am very happy with my D750, and if I need a longer range on my 70-200, my D7000. I was a classical example of growing slowly: D40 for the first 4-5 years with a kit lens. Then bought a D700 with the 16-85mm and learnt to love the upper screen on the body. Finally, some 4-5 years later, I went full-frame, and enjoy every minute since then.\n\nI would say: it's not so much about caring about the technical issues of older cameras, as it's always depending on what you want to shoot.\n\nHowever, when you buy an \"old\" camera, it's really important to check the shutter count. I bought my D7000 used in 2012 and roughly one year later the shutter unit broke. :/ Used cam here had one year warranty, but these mechanical failures can happen.\n\nBesides that, it's really a question of what you do. The reason I love my D750 is due to its great dynamic range and low noise, allowing me to shoot without tripod in darker conditions. (tripods are often forbidden were I shoot)\n\nOther than that, even my D7000 makes absolutely gorgeous images with the right lens.\n\nI wouldn't go back to my D40 though, that is clearly a downgrade in every way.\n\n43 months ago\n\neasy reading [deleted] says:\n\nThom Hogan has published an excellent Upgrade Guide for Nikon cameras. You pick the camera you own and he comments about why or if you should upgrade. He also posted a very good article on the subject where he basically recommends DX users upgrade from any of the 12 MP cameras to a 24 MP camera.\n\nI personally own D3300, D500 and D300s bodies and while I find the D300s still quite usable in many situatons, the other two cameras greatly outpace it in resolution and high iso/low light capabilities.\n\nFind the Ultimate Upgrade Guide here: www.dslrbodies.com/cameras/camera-articles/ultimate-camer...\n\nFind the second article here: www.dslrbodies.com/newsviews/nikon-2017-news/may-2017-nik...\n\nOriginally posted 40 months ago.\n\neasy reading edited this topic 40 months ago.\n\nRM GN says:\n\nHi! What I've learned over the years is to consider what you finally want to do with your photos. If the final output is for forums or for your tablet or smartphone, the size of yours photos will probably never exceed 2000 Px in width. For this purpose, the majority of cameras produced over the last 10 years will do. All the rest is about your personal skills. If you intend to have your photos printed 40x60 cms you may start to think about a newer model. And whatever you are told about great \"out of camera\" JPGs: Even with my latest Nikon Z I find myself shooting RAW in order to get what I want.\n\nCheers, Roland\n\n36 months ago\n\nchannyuk (using Albums) says:\n\nInteresting discussion thread! For me, I would agree with many here, for FX then the original first Nikon full framers i.e. D700/D3 are still wonderful cameras to use, and provide fantastic image quality even now (providing you don't need to print huge, or crop extensively). For DX, I had the D90 which I felt had good image quality up to ISO 800. So, in good light and not too much dynamic range in the scene, I think a D90/D300 would still pass. Otherwise, the D7000 would be more flexible, and then once we get into the 24MP DX sensors, we're probably not too far off what we have currently anyway. So, we're talking about going back to around summer 2008?\n\n36 months ago\n\neasy reading [deleted] says:\n\nGood points\n\nI think when it comes to old cameras, all things are relative. Search online for reviews of the D300s or the D700 and see how well they were received back then. Many a professional used the D700 for weddings, portraits and event photography. With the battery grip and pro EN-EL4 battery you can get 8 fps for sports. Lots of news, sports , wedding and other important events were coverd with these cameras.\n\nThe D300s was the poor man's DX camera with similar performance.\n\nYou are spot on when you consider \"good\" light and accepatable dynamic range as part of the image quality equation.\n\nThe latest generation of cameras provide better low light/high ISO capabilities while maintaining better dynamic range. The old cameras are fine when used within their limits and make great starter cameras for cash strapped photographers. Remember, good lenses last forever. Put your money in good glass and trade up camera bodies when you need advanced capabilities.\n\n36 months ago\n\nbrowndave238 says:\n\nJust got my hands on a F401, only put one roll of Velvia through it so far but the images are superb, at present I'm also using a D810, my daughter is using my old D7200 and my wife is using a P90 bridge, it's ideal for her being as she is disabled so the lightness and built in lens are a massive plus for her, some of the images she can take on it are excellent, specially seeing as it's only 12.1mp,\n\n36 months ago\n\nCharlyMakrayRice says:\n\nDepends on how good a photographer you are. Newest cameras also expose our mistakes to the highest degree. I still find my oldest camera's gave me the shots I still love the most. The smaller megapixel range, and lower levels of mechanics to think about allowed me to create. Camera improvements only got in my way. I felt I had to go learn way too many new skills and I froze. Now that I'm not earning a living from photography there's no return on any investment in equipment. For me it's all enjoyment. I do want to be able to do in-camera multiple exposure, and full frame. That's it for future goals ... a nice used D750 will probably do what I need. For now it's still an entry-level D3200 with a collection of vintage lenses and various adaptors. My beloved and seemingly too small nearly worn out Olympus E510 and lenses is still in the bag ... that set gave me the greatest pics.\n\n36 months ago\n\neasy reading [deleted] says:\n\nGood observations I did some informal testing over the past weekend with my \"new\" old D700 FX sensor compared against my new D500 DX sensor. The D700 looked just OK at ISO 6400 (its highest native setting) while the D500 still looked great at 6400 and was just starting to become noisy at 12,800 (but still quite usable).\n\nNewer DX sensors are pretty darn good now and you might benefit from an upgrade to a D7200. Cheap and effective. Check out Thom Hogan's recommendations here:\n\ndslrbodies.com/cameras/camera-articles/ultimate-camera-up...\n\nCheck out this ISO 25,600 shot made with my D500. The D7200 sensor is only about a 1/2 stop behind.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/77279817@N07/49527462587/in/album-72157713161090081/]\n\nI'm no longer so sure that you need to upgrade to FX to get the High ISO image quality you want.\n\nOriginally posted 36 months ago.\n\neasy reading edited this topic 36 months ago.\n\nMichael Spady says:\n\nI switched from Pentax to Nikon when I became interested in avian photography. Pentax's autofocus system was not up to the job. My first ever Nikon is a D500 I have shot lots of pictures with the ISO in five figures. Shooting in Raw, the noise shows with such a high ISO. I recommend Topaz Denoise to deal with the noise. Noise reduction in Lightroom or photoshop has never impressed me. If I decide to add an FX camera, I may try a D750 or a D810 (those are the only FX cameras at the top of my head).\n\n36 months ago\n\nPatrick Vierthaler (using albums) says:\n\nyankee photographer1:\n\nI'm afraid you are right about that. Looking at my Instagram or the people around me here in Japan, the camera market is dominated by mirrorless these days. And while it's sad to see the DX DSLRs slowly gone, I cannot help but also worry about the future of full-frame DSLRs... right now we have the D6xx, D7xx, D8xx and the professional Dx. But will they slowly abandon the prosumer line too? Hmm... I did get myself a D780 recently, and I hope to be able to upgrade in 6-8 years again, so that I can continue to use all my lenses. But we will see!\n\n35 months ago\n\nCzar Hey says:\n\nI'm surprised to see this thread still so active after almost a year.\n\nI primarily shoot with a Nikon D700 and a Nikon D7100, both of which aren't \"new\" by today's standards. The D7100 delivers excellent results in good lighting, but the quality drops rapidly at anything past ISO 4000. The D700, meanwhile, remains quite usable even in the ISO 6400+ range, and so when lighting gets poor the D700 continues to kick butt and chew bubblegum while I quietly pack the D7100 back into my bag. I quite adore both cameras, however, and I use them both extensively. I'm going to have to upgrade eventually, sure, but these cameras have delivered good results for their age, rivalling most smartphone cameras even today.\n\nAbout two months ago I was at an indoor bike park with a few friends. The lighting in the park was pretty bad, and most smartphone cameras would've crapped the bed in there. My D700 performed well even at the highest ISO settings—not stellar, but nothing unreasonable. It ended up being a pretty good day for everyone.\n\n35 months ago\n\nTheregsy says:\n\nIts all about where, when and how you'll be using it. Fuji Finepix S2 Pro in decent light awesome, Nikon D2x again with good lighting no problem, D40 as before in decent conditions all will produce the goods. However if you start moving into areas where conditions aren't perfect or you need high speed focussing, blistering burst mode to capture the action shot or anything like that you need to start bringing the technology more up to date. I know freelance press photographers who are still using D90's and D300's, they are still providing the goods. Myself I prefer a good FX body for the low light capabilities and as good as my D750 is the venerable D700 still works very well in comparison, as does a D3. Its horses for courses at this point, as ever my biggest advice is to try them out, just going to hold one could give you a big clue as to which is right for you. I hate tiny compact and mirrorless bodies as the balance feels horrible, to me, nothing wrong with image quality.\n\n35 months ago\n\npkostulak@ymail.com says:\n\nName a camera with a bad image quality. Consider image quality vs quality of the image. I don't think Nikon made a bad DSLR and other companies also for that matter. Are you talking about noise at high ISO? Resolution for huge prints? Even these two things don't go hand in hand. Define your topic or otherwise it is meaningless.\n\nBTW I use Nikon F3 and I really like it although it is an SLR and not DSLR which is what this group is about. it is from the 80s\n\n34 months ago\n\nLighttosensor says:\n\nA few months ago, I bought the Nikon D750. This camera is 7 years old, but it's still a excellent camera. Both in terms of image quality and features, there is nothing I would miss. As long as it's not getting totaled for some reason (which would make me quite sad), I don't see a reason to buy a newer one.\n\nI even considered a used Nikon D700 beforehand, which is 13 years old. The old memory cards and 12 MP stopped me from buying it. 24 MP offers me more room for cutting things out and will be sufficient what seems to be forever.\n\nSome of my lenses are even older than that. They were made in the 1990 ths for analog cameras and guess what - the image quality is still fantastic. So I don't quite get the notion of buying expensive (compared to the body) and new lenses. No doubt, images would be sharper, but is it really worth it? Sometimes, sharper is not actually better.\n\n34 months ago"
