        "text": "Updated 2/7/23: Nikon just announced that the NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.2 S and NIKKOR Z 26mm f/2.8 will be available in late March for $2,799.95 (85mm F/1.2S) and $499.95 (26mm f/2.8).\n\nNikon Z camera users will be happy to hear that there are two new Z-series FX prime lenses under development: the NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.2 S and the NIKKOR Z 26mm f/2.8 wide-angle lens.\n\nThe mid-telephoto NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.2 S, will certainly appeal to a wide range of photographers, especially those whose specialties include portrait, fashion and weddings. In addition to the versatility of its focal length, this lens’ fast f/1.2 aperture is ideal for shooting in low light—especially when you’re covering a moodily lit wedding reception. And, of course, portrait photographers (among others) will appreciate the lens’s dreamy bokeh. Perhaps more importantly, this lens is part of Nikon’s Z-mount S-line. If you’re not familiar with the “S” designation, Nikon explains that S-lenses offer superior resolution and deliver edge-to-edge sharpness, with “little to no drop in sharpness” when shooting wide open thanks to the larger Z mount. Additionally, these lenses create the beautiful bokeh that’s desirable when shooting with fast aperture lenses.\n\nIt will also features an impressive 2.8 ft (0.85m) minimum focusing distance that lets users get close enough to subjects to capture immaculate details, and will allow photographers to embrace shooting with challenging backlight through its Nano Crystal Coat technology which Nikon says is built to suppress ghosting and flare.\n\n[Read: Nikon Z 28-75mm f/2.8 Lens is a Lighter, More Affordable Workhorse]\n\nAlso in development, the NIKKOR Z 26mm f/2.8 wide-angle lens is targeted at advanced amateurs. It’s not an “S” line but it’s a slender, lightweight, go-anywhere, everyday lens that will includes an STM motor that enables a highly accurate AF drive and a minimum focus distance of eight inches (0.2m) to let users get close to their subjects. Whether you’re a street shooter, a wedding photographer or someone who simply wants to travel light, this little lens looks to be a good companion.\n\nAs of now, we have no pricing, no launch date and very few specs. However, we can speculate that the NIKKOR Z 85mm S-lens will likely carry a premium price while the little wide-angle NIKKOR Z 26mm will be more price-friendly. We’ll let you know when we have more details."
