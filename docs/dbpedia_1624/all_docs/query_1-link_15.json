A great name can help your brand stand out from the crowd and create an emotional connection with potential customers.\n\nThis list of creative real-world camera brand names provides a range of examples that you can draw inspiration from when coming up with your own unique name.\n\nCanon:\n\nThis company has been around for decades and their name reflects their commitment to creating quality cameras. The word “canon” means a set of accepted rules or principles, which is perfect for a photography-related brand!\n\nNikon:\n\nThe Nikon name was derived from the words “ni” (Japanese for two) and kon (short for “konishiroku”, the original name of the company). This clever combination implies that their cameras have two different functions – to capture and create.\n\nSony:\n\nSony is a well-known brand in many industries and its camera range has been incredibly successful. The origin of the name “Sony” comes from a combination of Latin and Japanese words meaning “sound” and “imaging” respectively.\n\nFujifilm:\n\nThis company started out as an imaging supplies manufacturer before expanding into digital photography. The word “fuji” is derived from Mount Fuji, which is considered sacred in Japan – making it an apt choice for a company with such deep roots in the country’s culture.\n\nOlympus:\n\nThe name of this camera brand is inspired by the Greek mountain Olympus, which was believed to be the home of the twelve gods. The name implies power and strength – perfect for a company that strives to create powerful cameras.\n\nPanasonic:\n\nThis company’s camera range has been growing rapidly in recent years and their name reflects their ambition. “Pan” comes from panoramic while “sonic” comes from sound – two features that are important when creating quality images with a digital camera.\n\nUse the Camera Business Name Generator\n\nHave you assembled up to five keywords that accurately reflect your company?

These could include features like special lens capabilities, durability, portability and anything else that makes your camera stand out.\n\nKeep it simple.\n\nGoing with something too lengthy or complicated may make it hard to recall and discover you among competitors. On top of that, resist temptation when considering outlandish spellings which don’t accurately reflect how the name is pronounced.\n\nBe unique.\n\nMake sure your brand name is one-of-a-kind and adds value to your product. Consider any special characteristics or features that set it apart from other cameras, as well as elements like color and texture that could be incorporated into the name for added impact.\n\nConsider your target audience.\n\nWhen coming up with a name for your camera brand, think about who you’re targeting and how the name might resonate with them. Are they professional photographers or amateur hobbyists? Is there a particular market demographic that you want to reach out to? Choose a name that speaks to your target audience and helps draw in their attention.\n\nCheck Domain Availability\n\nOnce you have a name in mind, it is important to make sure that the domain for the website is available. Checking domain availability is as easy as opening a site such as GoDaddy and searching for the name you want to use.\n\nChoose Your Domain!\n\nWhen it comes to registering your domain name and launching your camera business website, the process is as simple as selecting a hosting provider or registrar. To begin, compare prices and features of different providers on websites such as GoDaddy.com or Namecheap.com for the best bargain that suits your needs.
