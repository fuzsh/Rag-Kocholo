        "text": "Nikon is a Japanese company specializing in optics and imaging. Its full name is Nikon Corporation (㈱ニコン, Kabushiki Kaisha Nikon) since 1988.\n\nHistory\n\nThe company was founded in 1917 as Nippon Kōgaku Kōgyō K.K. (日本光学工業㈱, often rendered in English as Nippon Kogaku or, following as different convention, Nippon Kougaku) with the merger of two Japanese optical firms with military connections. The company's first camera lenses were designed in the 1920s by Heinrich Acht, who was invited with a team of German engineers (see Nippon Kōgaku lenses before 1945). After the departure of Acht, the lens design department was taken over by Sunayama Kakuya (砂山角野). The first lens mounted on a camera for civil use was the Anytar 12cm f/4.5 made in the early 1930s, renamed Nikkor in 1932. From 1934, the company supplied lenses to Seiki Kōgaku for the early Canon cameras.\n\nDuring World War II the company expanded significantly, supplying optical equipment to the Japanese military, including various aerial cameras.[1]\n\nAfter the war, Nippon Kōgaku decided to produce cameras for civil use, and two projects were started: a 6×6cm TLR and a 35mm rangefinder camera. The TLR, called Nikoflex, was shelved because of problems to find an adequate leaf shutter. The rangefinder camera was inspired by the German Contax and Leica. It is said that various names were considered, including Pentax, Nicca or Nikorette.[2] It was finally released as the Nikon in 1948.\n\nThe Nikon I proved very successful, and was followed by a long line of rangefinder cameras. In parallel, the company produced a range of Nikkor lenses both in Leica mount and for its own rangefinder cameras. The quality of these lenses attracted the attention of many professional photographers and photojournalists desiring better results from the small 35mm format.\n\nIn 1959, Nippon Kōgaku introduced the Nikon F, an advanced mechanical single lens reflex (SLR) camera that proved to be extraordinarily durable and reliable. With the F, Nikon introduced its philosophy of high-quality, low-friction, close-tolerance mechanisms requiring less lubricant than other cameras.source needed This workmanship had a practical side, as Nikons have accompanied more photographers to extreme environments — from the summit of Mount Everest to the depths of the Saharan Desert — than any other SLR camera. The F became an overnight success with many professional and serious amateur photographers, and spawned a succession of popular Nikon 35mm film cameras, culminating with the Nikon F6.\n\nIn 1983 Nikon launched the Nikon F3AF, a professional SLR with autofocus together with the autofocus lenses AF 80mm f2.8 and AF 200mm f3.5 ED-IF, a fast portrait lens and a fast tele lens since the camera was designed as kind of press camera. Both lenses had internal AF motors and worked on a slightly modified F-lenses bayonet, thus enabling the usage of manual focusing lenses on the autofocus camera body.\n\nIn the mid 1990s Nikon made its first DSLRs, the E-series, expensive cameras producing low image resolution. In the late 1990s, Nikon introduced its consumer line digital photography products with both the Coolpix line of consumer and \"prosumer\" cameras as well as the Nikon D-series (DSLRs).\n\nIn 2003 the company owned Photonics Technology Group which developed an own kind of image sensors (LBCAST-technology instead of common CCD or CMOS chip-architecture). In 2008 Nikon returned to conventional sensortypes with its FX-format CMOS sensor (FX-Format=35mm film frame-format) which it applied in its Nikon D3 DSLR. In autumn 2011 Nikon introduced its mirrorless digital camera system after concurrents Panasonic, Olympus, Sony and Samsung had won big market shares with help of the first and second generation of their mirrorless system cameras, and Panasonic and Olympus even had launched the 3rd generation. The Nikon 1 system uses an own sensor format and special 1 Nikkor AF lenses.\n\nFor several years Nikon produced the leading edge advanced cameras with 35mm format image sensors in the market. In 2017 the Nikon D850 DSLR took more out of its Sony imaging sensor than concurrent Sony's Alpha A7 R Mark II despite of the Nikon's sensor gave more megapixels, thus needing excessively more technological approach to get out more quality out of its smaller pixel pitch. But in the same year Sony improved its high-end camera to Mark III, probably to make its 35mm format CSC cameras technologically at par with Nikon's DSLRs.[3]\n\nDigital\n\nSLR\n\nNikon D1 - 1999\n\nNikon D1H - 2001\n\nNikon D1X - 2001\n\nNikon D2H - 2003\n\nNikon D2Hs - 2005\n\nNikon D2X - 2004\n\nNikon D2Xs - 2006\n\nNikon D3 - 2007\n\nNikon D3s - 2009\n\nNikon D3x - 2008\n\nNikon D4 - 2012\n\nNikon D4S - 2014\n\nNikon D5 - 2016\n\nNikon D6 - 2020\n\nNikon D40 - 2006\n\nNikon D40x - 2007\n\nNikon D50 - 2005\n\nNikon D60 - 2008\n\nNikon D70 - 2004\n\nNikon D70s - 2005\n\nNikon D80 - 2006\n\nNikon D90 - 2008\n\nNikon D100 - 2002\n\nNikon D200 - 2005\n\nNikon D300 - 2007\n\nNikon D300s - 2009\n\nNikon D500 (2016)\n\nNikon D600 - 2012\n\nNikon D610 - 2013\n\nNikon D700 - 2008\n\nNikon D750 - 2014\n\nNikon D780 - 2020\n\nNikon D800(E) - 2012\n\nNikon D810 - 2014\n\nNikon D810A - 2015\n\nNikon D850 - 2017\n\nNikon D3000 - 2009\n\nNikon D3100 - 2010\n\nNikon D3200 - 2012\n\nNikon D3300 - 2014\n\nNikon D3400 - 2016\n\nNikon D3500 - 2018\n\nNikon D5000 - 2009\n\nNikon D5100 - 2011\n\nNikon D5200 - 2012\n\nNikon D5300 - 2013\n\nNikon D5500 - 2015\n\nNikon D5600 - 2016\n\nNikon D7000 - 2010\n\nNikon D7100 - 2013\n\nNikon D7200 - 2015\n\nNikon D7500 - 2017\n\nNikon Df - 2013\n\nNikon E2 - 1994\n\nNikon E2s - 1994\n\nNikon E2N - 1996\n\nNikon E2Ns - 1996\n\nNikon E3 - 1999\n\nNikon E3S - 1999\n\nSee also Kodak for the various DCS models based on Nikon bodies.\n\nSee also Fujifilm for DCS models with Nikon lens compatibility and cameras based on Nikon DSLR bodies (S2 Pro and S3 Pro)\n\nInterchangeable-lens compact\n\nNikon 1 series\n\nNikon 1 J1 (2011)\n\nNikon 1 J2 (2012)\n\nNikon 1 J3 (2013)\n\nNikon 1 S1 (2013)\n\nNikon 1 V1 (2011)\n\nNikon 1 V2 (2012)\n\nZ Series\n\nMirrorless 24×36mm or APS-C cameras\n\nNikon Z 5 (2020) - 24MP\n\nNikon Z 6 (2018) - 25 MP\n\nNikon Z 6 II (2020) - 25MP\n\nNikon Z 6 III (2024) - 25MP\n\nNikon Z 7 (2018) - 46MP\n\nNikon Z 7 II (2020) - 46MP\n\nNikon Z 8 (2023) - 46MP\n\nNikon Z 9 (2021) - 46MP\n\nNikon Z 30 (2022) - 21MP APS-C\n\nNikon Z 50 (2019) - 21MP APS-C\n\nNikon Z fc (2021) - 21MP APS-C\n\nFixed Lens\n\nAll Nikon's compact digital cameras with fixed lenses are branded with the Coolpix trademark and are listed together.\n\nStill Video Cameras\n\nNikon QV prototype (modified F-801)\n\nNikon QV-1000C\n\n35mm film\n\nAuto focus SLR\n\nNikon F3AF - 1983\n\nNikon F4 - 1988\n\nNikon F4e - 1991\n\nNikon F4P\n\nNikon F4s - 1988\n\nNikon F5 - 1996\n\nNikon F6 - 2004\n\nNikon F50 (N50) - 1994\n\nNikon F55 (N55) - 2002\n\nNikon F60 (N60) - 1999\n\nNikon F65 (N65) - 2000\n\nNikon F70 (N70) - 1994\n\nNikon F75 (N75) - 2003\n\nNikon F80 (N80) - 2000\n\nNikon F90 (N90) - 1990\n\nNikon F90X (N90S) - 1992\n\nNikon F100 - 1999\n\nNikon F-401 (N4004) - 1987\n\nNikon F-401S (N4004S) - 1989\n\nNikon F-401X (N5005) - 1991\n\nNikon F-501 (N2020) - 1986\n\nNikon F-601 (N6006) - 1990\n\nNikon F-801 (N8008) - 1988\n\nNikon F-801S (N8008S) - 1991\n\nNikon U\n\nNikon U2\n\nManual focus SLR\n\nNikkorex F / Nikkor J - 1962\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat EL - 1972\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat ELW - 1976\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FS - 1965\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FT - 1965\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FTN - 1967\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FT2 - 1975\n\nNikomat/Nikkormat FT3 - 1977\n\nNikon EL2 - 1977\n\nNikon EM - 1979\n\nNikon F - 1959\n\nNikon F Photomic - 1962\n\nNikon F Photomic FTn - 1968\n\nNikon F Photomic T - 1965\n\nNikon F Photomic Tn - 1967\n\nNikon F2 - 1971\n\nNikon F2 Photomic - 1971\n\nNikon F2 Photomic A - 1977\n\nNikon F2 Photomic AS - 1977\n\nNikon F2 Photomic S - 1973\n\nNikon F2 Photomic SB - 1976\n\nNikon F3 - 1980\n\nNikon F3HP - 1982\n\nNikon F3P\n\nNikon F3/T - 1982\n\nNikon FA - 1983\n\nNikon FE - 1978\n\nNikon FE10 - 1996\n\nNikon FE2 - 1983\n\nNikon FG - 1982\n\nNikon FG20 - 1984\n\nNikon FM - 1977\n\nNikon FM10 - 1995\n\nNikon FM2 - 1982\n\nNikon FM2n - 1983\n\nNikon FM2/T - 1994\n\nNikon FM3A - 2001\n\nNikon F-301 (N2000) - 1985\n\nNikon F-601M (N6000) - 1990\n\nLeaf shutter SLR\n\nNikkorex 35 ( 1960-1962)\n\nNikkorex 35|2 (1962-)\n\nNikkorex Zoom 35 (1963-)\n\nNikkorex Auto 35 / Nikon Auto 35 (1964-)\n\nRangefinder\n\nNikon I (1948)\n\nNikon M (1949)\n\nNikon S (1951)\n\nNikon S2 (1954)\n\nNikon SP (1957)\n\nNikon S3 (1958)\n\nNikon S4 (1959)\n\nNikon S3M (1960)\n\nNikon S3 2000 (2000)\n\nNikon SP 2005 (2005)\n\nFixed lens / Compact\n\nAs with other Japanese manufacturers, Nikon's models were given different names in different territories and formed a confusing array of series, some of which lasted several years and crossed over with others.
