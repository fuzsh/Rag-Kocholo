        "text": "I have just viewed the highly skewed video by Tony Northrop on the issue of Canon and 3rd party lenses. The source incident of this video was that Viltrox reverse-engineered patented material and created their own versions of RF lenses. This was alluded to in a response from Canon read out in the course of the video. Reverse-engineering of technology developed by others is a clear violation of patent rights and is strictly illegal, so Canon were completely within their rights to give them a cease and desist notice and stop that.\n\nNot only was selling RF lens mount Viltrox units a clear violation of the patent, but people were complaining about the performance of lenses and expecting Canon to support them - which is clearly ridiculous, as Canon had no part in the making of the lenses and thus no responsibility for them. What these issues and complaints did do was to bring Canon's brand into disrepute which is also a legal violation.\n\nNorthrop's statements about the future of 3rd party lenses are just click-bait and purely speculative. He has a site to run and the more clicks he gets the better the site earns him revenue. There is absolutely no proof that Canon will deny 3rd party manufacturers access to license the IP to create their own lenses for the RF mount. Just be patient, and don't hit the panic button and don't jump to conclusions!\n\nNorthrop mentioned that Sony have a range of 3rd party lenses for their MILC units. Absolutely right, and they started their MILC systems in 2013, six years ahead of both Canon and Nikon. They too did not release the IP for their lenses for some years, so again there is some misrepresentation of the situation here.\n\ncheers, TREVOR\n\nThe mark of good photographer is not what they hold in their hand, it's what they hold in their head;\n\n\"All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow\", Leo Tolstoy;\n\n\"Skill in photography is acquired by practice and not by purchase\" Percy W. Harris\n\nI really challenge the term reasonable speculation in this context. A lot of hype has been injected into the situation by sites that thrive on click bait and people are falling for it.\n\nWhat we know: Two minor lens manufacturers who apparently poached IP to use the RF mount get told to stop. Several sites have taken this and run with it, creating a herd panic situation by suggesting Canon may not allow 3rd party lenses to be produced for their RF mount, without any real proof\n\nWhat we don't know: What will happen in the immediate future, but there are clues that one can assemble and they are worth exploring.\n\nHistorical Context: Back in the 90's I was around when Canon changed from the FD to the EF mount for their new range or EOS systems. 3rd party companies like Tamron had been producing mounts for makers - I had their lenses for my Nikon and Canon gear for about 12 years. When the EF mount came out there was a delay between that being released and 3rd party lenses coming to market, and an article at the time explained why.\n\nCanon wanted to establish its brand as reliable and was still doing work to perfect the firmware in a controlled manner. Outsourcing that to 3rd parties was not considered a good idea for anyone, and then there was the obvious business decision to allow some time for EF lenses to be sold. However, that period was relatively brief as a lot of lenses came on market from Canon in quick succession.\n\nNow fast forward to Canon's release of the RF mount in 2019. It was definitely late to the MILC market and had to get some bodies out there, so it released the rather tepid R and RP bodies, along with a few lenses. Then something completely unplanned happened. COVID hit.\n\nThe impact was massive across the world and across many industries, especially those relying on Chinese manufacture - and Canon was one of those. There were reports of empty factories, and closed production lines for lack of staff, lack of raw materials and as simple things as screws, without which parts could not be assembled. Because different manufacturers got their components from different sources, they were impacted in different ways. That disruption is still being felt and it has had two impacts on Canon's processes.\n\nThe design and development of new lenses and significant disruption to supplies for production. We are seeing the same thing with the Nikon Z9, for example with massive backlogs of orders, so this is not unique to Canon.\n\nCanon should have got more lenses out and would likely now be in a position to license their IP to other makers, but they are likely not - their lens road map is still not fully developed. They have done great work via their adapters to allow legacy native and 3rd party lenses to work well with Canon R-series bodies, but the native R lenses are lagging, especially in the lower price bracket. Things have got more complicated as people clamoured for more bodies, APS-C bodies and lenses to match - the market they have to fill has expanded significantly.\n\nHowever, 3rd party suppliers have also been impacted and the bigger names are likely also stressed for resources for both development and production for the same reasons.\n\nCanon aren't stupid, they know that having 3rd party glass will enhance their market for those who, for one reason or another, do not use native Canon glass, so it's actually to their advantage to let that market develop. Sigma and Tamron have signalled that they will be developing glass 'in due course'. I doubt that they will say that and risk criticism if that was not a practical possibility.\n\nSo, instead of committing to statements about abandoning Canon, or whatever, I am merely saying that there are many more factors to consider than the ones being touted to make Canon into a villain. Canon is a business entity and it is pragmatic in engaging with trusted suppliers. However, given their behaviour, Viltrox may not be on the immediate list for early licensing. I note that they are still selling EF and EF-M glass with no issues, and they have said they are stopping production of RF glass for the time being.\n\nSo, be patient - this situation is very, very new and let's wait until the dust settles.\n\ncheers, TREVOR\n\nThe mark of good photographer is not what they hold in their hand, it's what they hold in their head;\n\n\"All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow\", Leo Tolstoy;\n\n\"Skill in photography is acquired by practice and not by purchase\" Percy W.
