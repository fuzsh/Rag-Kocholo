        "text": "highlight\n\nAt Nikon, the design and production divisions cooperate from the early development stage to realize superior quality in the manufacture of digital cameras and interchangeable lenses.\n\nA concentration of expertise, from development to manufacturing\n\nTeam members make prototype lenses by arranging the necessary molds and parts shown on the blueprints, carefully checking that the products perform as they should. They must be durable enough for customers to use them with confidence, constructed without incident in a timely fashion during the manufacturing process, and without any variation in the finished product. Throughout the process, the team repeatedly evaluates and verifies that everything works perfectly and resolves any issues that arise.\n\nThe Nikon Thailand team believes in the importance of direct communication with designers. They known that productivity improves when they can directly ask questions about the design concept and learn about issues that came up in the process of creating previous products.\n\nFor Nikonâ€™s designers and production engineers, the knowledge base at Nikon Thailand is invaluable.\n\nOur teams come together as a unit with one single goal: to create superior quality products.\n\nOutlookContinuously improving manufacturing quality"
