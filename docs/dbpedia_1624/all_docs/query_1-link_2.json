        "text": "With so many different camera brands offering a wide range of cameras, it can be hard to narrow down the best of the best. Besides, with camera technology as advanced as it is, it's hard to go wrong with a good camera from any brand. The upshot is that choosing one over another mostly depends on personal preferences and needs, as well as what kind of lenses you want to use. Still, each brand has its own strengths and quirks, so it's good to be aware of what they each bring to the table.\n\nWe've bought and tested over 100 cameras from the best camera brands out there, and below are our top camera recommendations from the most popular brands. The brands aren't ordered by rank or position; the first brand listed isn't necessarily the best, and the last brand isn't the worst because what's best for you will depend on your own specific needs. Instead, we've listed the brands by popularity and market share while trying to keep brands with similar audiences together to make it easier to find what best suits your needs. If you're looking for your first camera, you can check out our recommendations for the best cameras for beginners. Otherwise, you can look at our picks for the best cameras for photography or the best cameras overall."
