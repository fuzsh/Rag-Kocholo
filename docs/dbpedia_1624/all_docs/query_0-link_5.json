        "text": "You can rely on seamless compatibility and excellent performance when working with Nikon SLR camera lenses along with Nikon DSLR cameras. Important features like vibration reduction, aperture control, and autofocus are painstakingly tailored to your camera's needs.\n\nWhat Makes Canon Lenses a Powerhouse in the Industry?\n\nF-Mount Lenses\n\nF-mount lenses can function with just about any Nikon camera that is currently available. Autofocus and electronic aperture adjustment, however, might only function in manual mode.\n\nFull-frame Lenses\n\nAll Nikon SLR cameras, regardless of whether or not they use film, have full-frame sensors, or cropped sensors, can use Nikon FX lenses.\n\nDX Lenses\n\nThe DX lenses can physically work with full-frame cameras, but thanks to their image circle, they cannot entirely cover the sensor. Compared to their full-frame counterparts, these lenses are typically lighter and more compact.\n\nGold Ring Lenses\n\nNikon fastens a gold ring close to the front of the lens as a visual cue that the lens is a \"gold ring lens\" designed for professional use. Wider apertures on these lenses enhance low-light performance and enable the use of higher shutter speeds."
