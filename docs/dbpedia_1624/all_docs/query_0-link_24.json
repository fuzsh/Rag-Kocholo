        "text": "Electronics\n\nCamera accessories\n\nThe First Nikon Z-Mount Mirrorless Lenses You Should Buy\n\nUpdated August 22, 2024\n\nBy Ben Keough\n\nBen Keough is an editor covering cameras, working from home, powering, and hobbies. He also writes about coffee, beer, and food for Wirecutter.\n\nNikon has been a powerhouse in the camera industry since the earliest days of single-lens reflex models, and it’s famous for the quality and breadth of its lens lineup. It offers perhaps the deepest lens roster of any manufacturer, with legacy-lens compatibility going back to the 1950s. And with the introduction of the Z-mount mirrorless system, it has produced some of the sharpest, fastest-focusing, and most well-rounded lenses it has ever made.\n\nIf you’ve recently bought into Nikon’s mirrorless Z system—either DX (APS-C) or FX (full-frame)—you have a wide variety of lenses to choose from, and making the right decision can be difficult. We’ve tested nearly every Z-mount lens available today, and we’re confident that we can help you choose the right lenses for you.\n\nBelow you’ll find recommendations for a basic first lens that everyone should have, plus picks for a kit-lens replacement, an everyday zoom, a telephoto zoom, a wide-angle zoom, a superzoom, a portrait lens, and a macro lens.\n\nIf you don’t shoot with a Nikon mirrorless camera but still want to invest in some great starter lenses, take a look at our lens guides for Canon EF- and RF-mount and Sony E-mount bodies.\n\nHow we picked\n\nAffordable price\n\nEven the cheapest lenses aren’t cheap, but we targeted lenses under $2,000 in every category—and many of our picks cost much less.\n\nAccurate autofocus\n\nManual focusing can be a joy, but for beginners autofocus is essential. We considered only those lenses with reliable, accurate AF.\n\nSolid support\n\nWe limited our testing to lenses from brands with a reputation for reliability, trustworthy warranties, and good customer service.\n\nUseful focal length\n\nWe prioritized certain types of lenses and focal lengths that would be most useful to photographers new to the Nikon system.\n\nWhy you should trust us\n\nI’m a supervising editor at Wirecutter covering cameras, working from home, powering, and hobbies. I’ve written about camera gear for more than a decade for Wirecutter and a range of other tech outlets, including Reviewed.com, Digital Camera Info, and PentaxForums.\n\nI’m also an avid hobbyist photographer. I’ve dipped my toes into various camera systems, including Pentax, Fujifilm, and Micro Four Thirds, but I’ve been shooting with Nikon cameras and lenses the longest—since 2008.\n\nFor this guide:\n\nI spent over a year researching more than 60 Nikon Z-mount autofocus lenses and testing the 28 most promising.\n\nI used each lens in the field, while walking around my neighborhood with my dog, hiking in the mountains of northern New Mexico, eating my way through street-food festivals in Los Angeles, and attending concerts.\n\nI read dozens of reviews from longtime Nikon-gear reviewers such as Thom Hogan, Ken Rockwell, and the experts at DPReview. I also watched reviews from YouTube reviewers like Christopher Frost and Chris Niccolls and Jordan Drake of PetaPixel.\n\nLike all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I’m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.\n\nThe first lens you should get: The fast prime\n\nAssuming that your camera came with a decent, basic zoom lens, the first addition to your collection should be a small, portable, fixed-focal-length (prime) lens that has a useful field of view and can deliver great images in dim light. For most people, the best option is a 50mm (or its equivalent on APS-C) lens with an f/1.8 or wider maximum aperture.\n\nThis focal length gets close to the perspective of human eyesight, making the images you capture feel a lot like what you picture in your mind.\n\nOur pick\n\nThe ideal everyday-carry prime lens, this fast 50mm lens is sharp from edge to edge, even at f/1.8, and it produces buttery-smooth background blur at its widest apertures.\n\nThe Nikon Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.8 S is the latest “nifty fifty” in Nikon’s long history—and by far the best one the company has ever made. Almost by default, it’s a lens that should be in every Nikon photographer’s bag.\n\nThis is the sharpest affordable normal lens that Nikon has ever made. Part of the company’s high-end S line, this lens is more expensive than most previous Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lenses, but it’s also far sharper and more contrasty than any that came before, even at its widest aperture setting. Unlike previous nifty fifties, it’s also weather sealed, protected against moisture and dust.\n\nFor a prime lens, it’s versatile. Despite its lack of zoom capability, it’s an ideal option for everything from short portrait work (where its wide maximum aperture comes in handy) to landscapes (where its edge-to-edge sharpness and lack of distortion are key) to architecture (at a distance).\n\nIts bokeh makes both human and animal subjects pop. Nikon makes better portrait lenses, but if you want to photograph people and pets and aren’t ready to invest in a dedicated portrait optic, the Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.8 S is a great start. When you’re shooting at its widest aperture, backgrounds simply dissolve into nothingness and foreground your subjects thanks to the lens’s high sharpness and contrast.\n\nThe older version is good too, but you need an adapter for that lens. If you’re on a tight budget, you can find the older Nikon Nikkor AF-S FX 50mm f/1.8 G for less than half the price (or for a mere fraction used). The downsides: You need an FTZ or FTZ II adapter to use it on a Z-mount mirrorless camera, the image quality you get from it at wide apertures isn’t as good, and it isn’t weather-sealed.\n\nOur pick\n\nThis 45mm-equivalent prime lens has a field of view very similar to that of our full-frame pick, and it offers most of the same great qualities in its optical performance and build.\n\nBuying Options\n\nThe Sigma 30mm f/1.4 DC DN Contemporary is the “normal” option in Sigma’s Contemporary line of prime lenses for Nikon Z, and it matches up in nearly every way to our full-frame pick despite carrying a much lower price tag. Since Nikon doesn’t offer a wide-aperture normal prime for APS-C Z cameras, this Sigma model is currently your best bet.\n\nIt may feel even more natural to use than our full-frame pick. This lens’s 30mm field of view on APS-C cameras is equivalent to 45mm on a full-frame camera, which is arguably even closer to natural human vision than 50mm. In theory, this means that the images this lens can capture will correspond more closely to what you see without a camera up to your eye, though everyone has their own preferred “normal” focal length.\n\nIt’s quite sharp, and it has great bokeh. Like Nikon’s Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.8 S, this Sigma lens is sharp, especially in the center of the frame, even at its maximum aperture of f/1.4—which is two-thirds of a stop brighter than that of our full-frame pick. It’s also capable of producing creamy-smooth background blur that makes your subject stand out.\n\nThe only real flaw we found here is some chromatic aberration (purple fringing) at the widest aperture, but you can correct that in editing.\n\nYou have a cheaper option if you don’t mind using an adapter. Nikon doesn’t make a normal prime for its APS-C Z-mount cameras, but you might consider a cheaper legacy-lens alternative: the extremely affordable Nikon Nikkor AF-S DX 35mm f/1.8 G. Again, you need an FTZ adapter in this case, and this lens is not as sharp or as bright as our recommendation from Sigma, but the price is unbeatable.\n\nAlternatively you could use the excellent Nikon Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.8 S as a 52.5mm-equivalent normal lens, but it’s far more expensive than the Sigma lens and much larger, so it feels unbalanced on APS-C cameras.\n\nThe kit-lens replacement\n\nWhen most people buy a new camera, they get it with a lens—typically what’s referred to as a standard zoom, but also a “kit lens.” For a full-frame camera, this is usually something like a 24–70mm lens, and that’s exactly what Nikon pairs with most of its full-frame Z-mount cameras.\n\nThe good news is that the Nikon Nikkor Z 24–70mm f/4 S is one of the best kit lenses ever made, and it’s a great value-add for new Nikon camera buyers, since it retails at $900 by itself. But if you bought your camera body-only or simply want a lens with a wider constant aperture, you can find better options out there.\n\nOur pick\n\nIf you didn’t get a lens with your camera, or want a wider aperture than Nikon’s excellent 24–70mm f/4 kit lens offers, this is your best bet. It’s bright, sharp, and capable of producing beautiful bokeh.\n\nBuying Options\n\nIf your camera came with Nikon’s Nikkor Z 24–70mm f/4 S, you probably don’t need an upgrade. It’s an excellent piece of glass, and it’s perfectly capable of capturing stunning images in most circumstances. But if you yearn for a wider aperture or bought your full-frame Z-mount camera without a lens, the Tamron 28–75mm f/2.8 Di III VXD G2 is an excellent choice.\n\nIt’s a full stop faster than Nikon’s kit lens. This Tamron lens has a constant maximum aperture of f/2.8, so it can use faster shutter speeds in dim light and produce more beautifully blurred backgrounds than Nikon’s 24–70mm f/4 S. For most people, f/4 is totally fine, but if you find yourself bumping up against high image noise or slow shutter speeds, this Tamron lens can buy you a bit more slack.\n\nIt’s much cheaper than Nikon’s own 24–70mm f/2.8 S. Nikon makes its own fast-aperture standard zoom, the Nikon Nikkor Z 24–70mm f/2.8 S, and it’s an absolute beast. But it also costs a jaw-dropping $2,400, in stark contrast to the Tamron lens’s bargain $1,000 price tag.\n\nThe image quality and build are excellent. The Tamron 28–75mm f/2.8 G2 is a strong performer throughout its zoom range, with edge-to-edge sharpness right from f/2.8, beautiful bokeh, and pleasing color rendering. Although it isn’t a macro lens, it can also get quite close to your subject—7.1 inches from the sensor at 28mm and 15 inches at 75mm—producing some striking images.\n\nThe build quality is also extremely solid, with a pleasing heft, a fingerprint-resistant body, and wide, rubberized focus and zoom rings. It also has a USB-C port for firmware updates and compatibility with the Tamron Lens Utility software, which allows you to customize the function of the lens’s Hold/Set button.\n\nAt just 4.6 inches long and 540 grams, this lens is shorter and much lighter than the Nikkor Z 24–70mm f/2.8 S (4.96 inches, expanding to 6.15 inches at 70mm, and 805 g) and barely heavier than the Nikkor Z 24–70mm f/4 S (500 g).\n\nIt offers full weather-sealing. While Tamron doesn’t make a big deal of it, the 28–75mm f/2.8 G2 is fully weather-sealed and has a fluorine coating on the front element to keep water from beading on the glass.\n\nThe everyday zoom\n\nThough today’s kit lenses can be surprisingly sharp, they cover less range than many people want during a long day of shooting. If you’d prefer to carry just one lens that can cover virtually everything you might want to capture, from architecture to landscapes and from portraits to action, you need something that goes beyond the typical 24–70mm (or 18–55mm, for APS-C) range of a kit lens.\n\nTo have all that capability crammed into a single lens, you usually need to give up a bit of image quality and accept a little extra weight, but the results you get from the best of these all-rounders might still surprise you.\n\nOur pick\n\nIf you want a single lens that can (almost) do it all, this is the one. Its wide-angle to medium-telephoto zoom range and its relatively fast, constant maximum aperture make it especially versatile.\n\nOur favorite everyday zoom for full-frame Z-mount cameras—and one of the most pleasant surprises of all the lenses we tested for this guide—is the Nikon Nikkor Z 24–120mm f/4 S.\n\nIt’s like a bag full of prime lenses. The zoom range covers all kinds of shooting situations, and this lens is sharp regardless of the focal length you choose. The constant maximum aperture of f/4 is still bright enough that you can use it indoors (if you don’t mind cranking up the ISO sensitivity) while getting beautifully blurred backgrounds.\n\nIt offers all the benefits that come with Nikon’s S-line lenses. This lens offers great build quality, and like other S lenses it’s weather-sealed, so you can use it in inclement weather and worry less about dust getting sucked onto your sensor.\n\nIt isn’t too big or heavy. The 24–120mm f/4 S is a bit bigger and heavier (1 pound 6.3 ounces) than your average kit lens, but it’s lighter than the less versatile Nikkor Z 24–70mm f/2.8 S, which tips the scales at 1 pound 12 ounces. Many shooters are happy to make that kind of trade-off.\n\nOur pick\n\nThis lens boasts an especially versatile zoom range capable of capturing everything from wide-angle architecture and landscapes to portraits and wildlife shots.\n\nAPS-C photographers have fewer options for this kind of lens, at least for now. The best we’ve found is the Nikon Nikkor Z DX 18–140mm f/3.5–6.3 VR, which squeezes a lot of zoom range into a compact package.\n\nIt’s sharp enough. This lens is not quite as bitingly sharp as our full-frame pick, and in that regard it might even lag behind the 16–50mm kit lens that comes with Nikon’s APS-C Z cameras. It doesn’t have the 24–120mm lens’s constant maximum aperture, either. But it’s still a very competent performer, especially considering the zoom range it offers.\n\nIt covers a lot of ground. This lens offers quite a bit more zoom range than our full-frame pick does, but with the drawback of a variable maximum aperture. With a full-frame-equivalent range of 27–210mm, you can grab everything from wide-angle landscapes to wildlife.\n\nIt’s small and lightweight. One of APS-C’s biggest advantages over full-frame is that the bodies and lenses can be more compact, and this lens delivers in that respect. At 11.2 ounces, it’s about half the weight of our full-frame pick despite offering more zoom. That pint-sized design suits smaller APS-C Z-mount bodies like the Z 50 and Z fc.\n\nIt offers Nikon’s powerful image stabilization. Thanks to the addition of Nikon’s Vibration Reduction (VR), you can still use this lens indoors despite its relatively narrow maximum aperture, and that feature may even make this lens viable for sports coverage.\n\nThe telephoto zoom\n\nIf you like to photograph fast-moving sports or wildlife, a telephoto zoom lens is essential, and one with a wide, constant aperture is ideal. Nikon makes a few such lenses for its Z system, but many are pricier than we feel comfortable recommending to beginners who are just building a kit.\n\nOur pick\n\nNikon’s budget wide-aperture telephoto zoom lens punches above its class with excellent sharpness and creamy bokeh, but it lacks image stabilization.\n\nA notable outlier in Nikon’s pricey telephoto range is the Nikon Nikkor Z 70–180mm f/2.8, which is broadly believed to be a version of an existing Tamron lens.\n\nIt outperforms its price tag. Despite its affordability in comparison with Nikon’s other wide-aperture telephoto zoom lenses, this model is sharp throughout its zoom range, and its f/2.8 maximum aperture produces beautifully creamy backgrounds. Because of that wide aperture, it’s ideal for shooting indoor sports such as basketball and hockey, a task that zoom lenses with smaller apertures may struggle with. It’s also a fantastic portrait lens in a pinch.\n\nBut that bargain price brings trade-offs. The main drawbacks to this lens are its lack of image stabilization (though most full-frame Z bodies have in-camera stabilization) and weather-sealing. The zoom range is also a bit shorter than the 70–200mm that’s customary for this class of lens.\n\nCompared with Nikon’s S-line telephoto lenses, it’s light and compact. One significant upside is that the Nikkor Z 70–180mm f/2.8 weighs a lot less than Nikon’s far pricier Nikkor Z 70–200mm f/2.8 VR S—a mere 1 pound 12.1 ounces, as opposed to 3 pounds. It’s also 2.7 inches shorter.\n\nYou can find good adapted-lens alternatives. Nikon’s DSLR-era 70–200mm f/2.8 VR lens went through several iterations, all of them great, and they can often be found used for well under $1,000. Sigma and Tamron both made similarly excellent 70–200mm lenses for Nikon DSLRs, which are sometimes available for even less. As usual, these lenses require an FTZ or FTZ II adapter for use on Nikon Z bodies.\n\nOur pick\n\nDespite its kit-lens price, this lens offers excellent sharpness and a generous zoom range that makes it suitable for (some) sports, travel, and wildlife.\n\nIf you own an APS-C Z-mount camera and plan to shoot mostly outdoors—say, wildlife, slower-moving sports such as golf, or distant landmarks on vacation—the Nikon Nikkor Z DX 50–250mm f/4.5-6.3 VR is surprisingly great for what amounts to a kit lens. It’s the best purpose-built telephoto lens for APS-C, but serious photographers may want to consider a full-frame lens with a constant maximum aperture instead.\n\nIn the right conditions, it’s a strong performer. Because of this lens’s narrow, variable aperture, it can’t produce the same beautiful bokeh as our full-frame pick can. But under the right circumstances, this compact, lightweight lens is capable of capturing beautifully crisp, clear images. And while the background blur isn’t as extreme as with the Nikkor Z 70–180mm f/2.8, the bokeh it produces is notably smooth.\n\nNikon’s Vibration Reduction helps compensate for the variable aperture. The Nikkor Z DX 50–250mm f/4.5-6.3 VR offers Nikon’s in-lens image stabilization, which effectively combats camera shake at the long end of its 75-375mm–equivalent zoom range. That means you may be able to eke out some nice shots in dimmer conditions despite its narrow aperture.\n\nOur full-frame pick may still be a better choice. Owners of Nikon’s APS-C cameras have fewer options to choose from when it comes to long focal lengths. In fact, if you own a Z 50 or Z fc and want to shoot the kinds of subjects discussed above, you’re better served by biting the bullet and getting the full-frame Nikkor Z 70–180mm f/2.8 (a 105–270mm equivalent on those cameras).\n\nThe wide-angle zoom\n\nIf you often find yourself taking photos in tight spaces—real-estate photography, museums, and the like—a wide-angle lens is an essential tool. And it’s also a great thing to have with you when you’re strolling the concrete canyons of, say, New York City or Tokyo.\n\nThese lenses tend to start ultra-wide, with exaggeratedly stretched corners, and narrow down to a perspective that’s wider than what you can get from the fast prime lenses we recommend above. But even at their widest, the best of these lenses avoid fish-eye-like barrel distortion, opting for a rectilinear field of view. As a result, they can also work well for capturing breathtaking landscape and street-photography shots.\n\nOur pick\n\nThis lens provides a distinctive perspective for architecture and landscapes, as well as street photography and everyday shooting.\n\nThe best wide-angle zoom lens we tested for full-frame cameras is the Nikon Nikkor Z 14–30mm f/4 S, which dazzled us with its range, image quality, and solid build.\n\nIt’s expensive, but it’s nearly flawless. Although this lens is not cheap, it is remarkably contrasty, resistant to unsightly lens flare (a common issue with wide-angle lenses), and very wide. It’s sharp from edge to edge at all focal lengths, too.\n\nIt’s surprisingly versatile for a wide-angle lens. The short minimum focusing distance of the Nikkor Z 14–30mm f/4 S allows it to serve as an effective—if unusual—portrait lens for fun people shots. Its 30mm maximum focal length is still considered wide on a full-frame camera, but that’s longer than what you get in many wide zooms, so you can use it for lots of different subjects.\n\nIn-camera corrections render it distortion-free. This lens displays quite a bit of barrel distortion on the wide end and pincushion on the long end in raw files, but JPEGs get automatic correction in-camera to be nearly perfectly rectilinear. (Corrections for raw files are also available in Adobe Lightroom and other popular developing software.)\n\nOur pick\n\nThis lens’s 18-42mm–equivalent range can cover wide-open vistas and people shots equally well. And its Power Zoom function makes it a great choice for video work.\n\nFor crop-sensor photographers—and people who like to shoot video—the Nikon Nikkor Z DX 12–28mm f/3.5–5.6 PZ VR is a great choice.\n\nIt’s perhaps even more versatile than our full-frame pick. Although this lens is not as wide as that model, its widest focal length (18mm equivalent in full-frame terms) is still more than expansive enough for great architecture and landscape shots. But its 42mm-equivalent maximum focal length is a great everyday focal length, squarely in the “normal” ballpark. As a result, this lens can work well for more conventional people photos and still-life shots, too.\n\nIt performs well across its zoom range. Like its larger sibling, this lens is sharp, contrasty, and capable of focusing very close. Its bokeh isn’t as smooth as what you can get out of the Nikkor Z 14–30mm f/4 S, but that isn’t really something most people look for in a wide-angle zoom.\n\nIt’s especially good for vlogging and other video capture. As a Power Zoom lens, the Nikkor Z DX 12–28mm f/3.5-5.6 PZ VR zooms smoothly and silently, and you can even control the focal length remotely for vlogging and other video uses. Adding to that video utility is Nikon’s reliably strong VR image stabilization, which can produce beautifully smooth footage even when you’re walking with the camera.\n\nThe superzoom\n\nA superzoom lens is rarely the best option—these do-it-all optics often sacrifice sharpness, distortion control, and a wider maximum aperture in exchange for sheer range. But if you want to carry only a single lens on trips and don’t mind the downsides—poor light-gathering ability indoors or on cloudy days, less blurry backgrounds, and so on—they can be a good choice.\n\nOur pick\n\nDefying stereotypes of superzooms, this lens exhibits great center sharpness throughout its range, and its effective image stabilization makes it a solid birding lens despite its dim maximum aperture.\n\nThe Nikon Nikkor Z 28–400mm f/4–8 VR outperforms the reputation of most superzoom lenses with very good sharpness, beautiful colors, and effective image stabilization. It’s capable of capturing everything from wide-open landscapes to portraits and even sports or wildlife.\n\nIf you’re willing to live with its few shortcomings, that versatility makes it a great companion for backpacking trips, a day out with the family, or anything else that life might throw at you.\n\nIts image quality is surprisingly good. You won’t mistake the images coming out of this lens for shots you’d get from some of Nikon’s S-line lenses, but as consumer zoom lenses go, the 28–400mm f/4–8 VR stands at the head of the pack. Sharpness is high, especially in the center, and background blur is smooth even at longer focal lengths and f/8. Images are contrasty, and colors are vibrant.\n\nIt has a small maximum aperture, but VR mostly makes up for that. This lens’s maximum aperture starts at f/4 at 28mm and jumps all the way to f/8 by 200mm. With less light coming in due to the restricted aperture, you need more ambient light to freeze action and get clear shots.\n\nOn a lens without optical image stabilization, that would mean using higher ISO settings and getting more image noise as a result, but Nikon’s Vibration Reduction (VR) provides 5 stops of stabilization, which should allow your camera to shoot at slower shutter speeds without blur from hand shake. If your camera supports Synchro VR, the collaboration between lens and body VR pushes that to 5.5 stops.\n\nBut even with that benefit, this is not a lens that’s great for indoor or nighttime photography. VR might prevent blur from your hands moving, but it can’t help to stop the motion of the people or objects you’re capturing—only a faster shutter speed can do that.\n\nIt’s weather-sealed, despite not being an S-line model. Dust and water protection is a feature that Nikon typically reserves for its high-end lenses, but the company wisely included it on this go-anywhere, do-anything lens. The 28–400mm f/4–8 VR features seals around the moving parts of the lens barrel, as well as the lens mount, providing some protection against inclement weather.\n\nDespite its range, it’s relatively small and lightweight. One of the benefits of this lens’s smaller maximum aperture is that it’s compact and lighter than you may expect. The 28–400mm f/4–8 VR measures just 5.6 inches long when retracted for storage, and it weighs 725 grams—slightly less than the 795 grams of our 70–180mm f/2.8 telephoto zoom pick, which covers a lot less ground.\n\nThe portrait prime\n\nIf you love taking photos of people and pets, a dedicated portrait lens—typically a prime (non-zoom) lens with a focal length between 70mm and 105mm—is the best way to capture them. Lenses in this range can isolate your subject from the background, especially with the wide apertures that primes can utilize, and they don’t distort human features the way wider lenses do.\n\nOur pick\n\nThis is the sharpest version of Nikon’s classic portrait lens yet, with impressively smooth background blur that really makes your subject pop.\n\nThe Nikon Nikkor Z 85mm f/1.8 S is a classic example of a portrait lens, delivering shallow depth of field, smooth background blur, and bitingly sharp, contrasty results even at its widest aperture setting.\n\nIt’s almost optically flawless. Unlike some older portrait lenses, including Nikon’s own previous 85mm offerings, this model is nearly as sharp in the corners as it is in the center of the image. That means it can also work well to capture distant landscapes and architecture. And it’s almost completely distortion-free, even with in-camera corrections turned off.\n\nIt’s weather-sealed and ruggedly built. Like Nikon’s other S-line lenses, the Nikkor Z 85mm f/1.8 S is resistant to water and dust, and it’s built from more robust plastics (plus a metal mount) than what you can find in some of the company’s more budget-oriented lenses.\n\nThe previous-generation equivalent is really cheap. If you want to save a bit of money, Nikon’s Nikkor AF-S 85mm f/1.8 G, made for DSLRs, is also a very good lens and can work on Z cameras with an FTZ adapter. The trade-off for paying half as much as you would for a Z-mount 85mm lens, or less if you get it used, is slightly softer results (especially at the widest apertures, in the corners of the image), marginally less-smooth bokeh, and slower autofocus.\n\nOur pick\n\nFor DX cameras, this lens provides a perspective similar to that of our full-frame pick, and it has an even brighter maximum aperture.\n\nBuying Options\n\nFor crop-sensor Z bodies, the Sigma 56mm f/1.4 DC DN Contemporary is a great option that stacks up to our full-frame pick in almost every regard.\n\nIt offers a classic portrait focal length. With a full-frame-equivalent focal length of 84mm, it provides almost exactly the same field of view as the Nikon Nikkor Z 85mm f/1.8 S.\n\nIt’s sharp, it creates pretty bokeh, and it can focus close for a portrait lens. Like the Nikkor Z 85mm f/1.8 S, this lens is sharp from edge to edge, even at its bright f/1.4 maximum aperture, and it produces creamy bokeh. It can focus closer than most portrait lenses, too, which amplifies its ability to blur backgrounds.\n\nIt balances well on Nikon’s smaller APS-C bodies. Portrait lenses are often big and heavy, but this Sigma lens is relatively compact and lightweight at a little under 10 ounces and 2.34 inches long. That makes it a great match for the smaller Z 50 or Z fc, and even the Z 30.\n\nIt’s well built and weather-sealed. Like our full-frame pick—and Sigma’s other Nikon Z-mount lenses—the 56mm f/1.4 DC DN Contemporary is built from robust plastics that offer a premium feel, and it features a metal mount and weather-sealing. (Sigma’s lenses have a gasket on the lens mount, while Nikon’s Nikkor S-line lenses also include internal gaskets around every moving part.) You can use this Sigma lens in light rain, at the beach, or in the desert without worrying about the health of the lens or your camera.\n\nThe macro lens\n\nMost people don’t need a macro lens, but if you love photographing the hidden world—things on the scale of insects, soap bubbles, the details of rare coins, or the minutiae of flowers—you might be one of the few who do. And if you want to shoot both the small stuff and gorgeous portraits, a good macro lens can pull double duty.\n\nOur pick\n\nNikon’s sharpest macro lens gives you a breathtakingly clear, close-up view of things normally unseen.\n\nNeither Nikon nor third-party lens makers currently produce any Z-mount APS-C macro lenses, so we have only one pick here: the Nikon Nikkor Z MC 105mm f/2.8 VR S.\n\nIt does everything you could want a macro lens to do. This lens is wickedly sharp, as all good macro lenses are, and it offers 1:1 magnification, so it can reproduce your subject at life size. (Some less-expensive and smaller macro lenses are limited to 1:2 magnification or require an add-on converter to reach 1:1.)\n\nIts exceptional bokeh makes it a great portrait option. This lens’s relatively wide maximum aperture of f/2.8, combined with its ability to focus extremely close, allows it to turn the background of your photos into a soft, creamy blur. Though the maximum aperture narrows to f/4.5 at the closest focusing distances, it still produces especially smooth bokeh.\n\nIt’s loaded with features. Like other S-line lenses, the Nikkor Z MC 105mm f/2.8 VR S is sealed against weather and dust, and it includes Nikon’s optical Vibration Reduction (VR)—very important when you’re working at such close distances. The lens body has several helpful features too, such as a function button, an OLED display, and a control ring that you can assign to control both aperture and other functions.\n\nIf you’re willing to give up optical image stabilization, Nikon’s Nikkor Z MC 50mm f/2.8 also offers 1:1 magnification and a more reasonable 75mm effective focal length on APS-C cameras, but we preferred the image quality from the 105mm macro lens. The Nikkor Z MC 105mm f/2.8 VR S also gives you more working distance from your subject when you get to 1:1 magnification.\n\nYou can find lots of other good macro lenses, if you’re willing to use an adapter. If you’re seeking to shave a little off the price of a brand-new Nikkor Z-mount macro lens, the Sigma 105mm f/2.8 EX DG OS HSM Macro is a great alternative that can work with an FTZ adapter. It isn’t quite as clinically perfect as the Nikkor Z MC 105mm f/2.8 VR S and lacks some of that model’s bells and whistles, but it’s still impressively sharp, capable of 1:1 magnification, and equipped with image stabilization. Purchased new, this Sigma lens can save you more than $300 in comparison with the Nikkor Z equivalent, and in used condition it can be much, much cheaper.\n\nUsing DSLR (and film-era) lenses on Nikon mirrorless cameras\n\nOne of Nikon’s key advantages in comparison with competing camera systems is that it goes out of its way to ensure that older lenses work on its new mirrorless bodies, including with autofocus and proper metering.\n\nSpecifically, all F-mount DSLR lenses with electronic focusing motors (those with an AF-S, AF-P, or AF-I designation) can work with full autofocus and auto-exposure capability on Z-mount cameras via the company’s FTZ and FTZ II adapters. The two adapters have identical functionality, but the FTZ II does away with the original’s tripod foot so that it works better with large lenses that have their own tripod feet, as well as with the Z 9 camera and its integrated vertical grip.\n\nThis means you can get very cheap DSLR-era lenses that work well on the latest bodies, such as the AF-S Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 G, which costs around $200 new or $100 or less used, in contrast to the $530 that Nikon usually asks for the Z-mount Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 S. And you can also mount older, manual-focus lenses—going all the way back to the beginnings of the F-mount in 1959—using the same adapter. In total, Nikon allows you to use approximately 360 older Nikkor lenses with its cutting-edge Z cameras.\n\nIn light of all that, you may be asking why we don’t recommend any F-mount lenses in this guide. We have a few reasons:\n\nIn many cases, Z-mount lenses are simply better performers. Nikon Z lenses are newer, designed for the Z-mount, and—generally speaking—equipped with improved optical performance, better glass coatings, and faster autofocus than older lenses.\n\nErgonomics are often worse with F-mount lenses. Because these older lenses were designed for cameras with a different mount and a different register distance, they can make the smaller Z-mount mirrorless bodies feel front-heavy.\n\nOlder lenses may not be supported for long. Though relatively few photographers are likely to need to send a lens in for repair, this is still a concern. Nikon has begun phasing out support (including repairs, due to parts availability) for many DSLRs and DSLR-era lenses, which means that repairs will be much more difficult in the future.\n\nBut even with all of that said, there are some excellent bargains to be had, especially if you’re buying used, and since Nikon’s Z-mount lens system isn’t complete yet, at this time you can find some lenses (for example, tilt-shift lenses and exotic telephotos) that are available exclusively in F-mount. When there’s a relevant F-mount lens to consider in a given category, we’ve recommended it above.\n\nHow we picked and tested\n\nUnlike some of its rivals, Nikon has opened the Z-mount to third-party lens manufacturers, and as a result, a healthy number of options are available for the relatively young system. To winnow the contenders, we established a few criteria: a list price under $2,000, autofocus capability, and solid support (which ruled out some of the less-established third-party brands).\n\nOver the course of eight months, we systematically tested nearly every Z-mount lens that met those criteria, including both first-party Nikon Nikkor glass and third-party options from Sigma, Tamron, and other lens makers. We didn’t shoot resolution tests or measure distortion—if you’re interested in that kind of technical data, you’ll find no shortage of specialist websites and YouTube reviews that break it all down. Instead, we shot with the lenses in the real world, evaluating both overall image quality and other, fuzzier metrics such as handling, durability, and ease of use.\n\nIn general, we’re assuming that you already own a “kit” lens that came bundled with your camera—something like the Nikkor Z 24–50mm, Nikkor Z 24–70mm f/4 S, or Nikkor Z DX 16–50mm f/3.5–6.3 VR. Our goal with this guide is to provide recommendations for lenses that outdo those general-purpose zooms by providing a wider maximum aperture, additional focal length, or other useful capabilities, such as macro.\n\nThis article was edited by Phil Ryan and Erica Ogg.\n\nMeet your guide\n\nBen Keough\n\nBen Keough is the supervising editor for Wirecutter's working from home, powering, cameras, and hobbies and games coverage.
