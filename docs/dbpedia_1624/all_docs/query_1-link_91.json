It is about flexibility and less constraint which allows Nikon the freedom to design lenses that can encompass more benefits with way less drawbacks. Also, better IQ just doesn't mean central sharpness, we are talking negligible CA, lower distortion, better edge to edge sharpness just to name a few benefits that the Z mount allows designers to address. Both Canon and Nikon adopted a wider mount and shorter flange distance for that reason.\n\nThe 14-30 f4 would never have been able to be made if F mount in the size and weight that it is. The 14-24 f2.8S is smaller, way lighter and has better IQ than the F mount version. The 24-70 f2.8S is much smaller, lighter and much better IQ than the F mount version. The 24-120 f4 smaller, lighter and way better optically. 24-70 f4, small, light and an optically very good lens - but no F mount counterpart. The point is, it was made to marry with the small, light Z6 and Z7 at time of release to show the advantages of the Z mount in making it possible to have small light cameras. The 400 f4.5 arguably would never have been made in F mount - ridiculously light, small and superb IQ. ...Show more →\n\nLance B wrote:\n\nI am not sure what you are actually getting at.

Nikon's senior engineers have emphasized the advantages of the Z Mount are to \"prioritize overwhelming optical performance\". As you rightly point out the Z mount enabled its symmetrical design of the 14-30 f4S, so it avoided the huge bulbous front element of a Ultrawide with a retrofocus design.\n\nIn the wider context, the Z Mount facilitates the distinctly symmetrical designs we see in many S Line Nikkors, including the U-Wide zooms, which are in fact designed smaller, according to Akihiko Obama:\n\n\"...The Z-mount is actually a great contributor to the downsizing of the camera, of the mount itself, and in pursuing high-performance optical functions, as well as enabling the filter attachment.\"\n\nhttps://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2019/03/29/mount-wars-z-mount-really-does-help-lens-design-and-af-nikon-tech-interview :\n\n\"...The biggest consideration by far was what the large diameter and short depth would do for optical quality, in terms of center resolution, corner-to-corner sharpness, reduced shading (vignetting), reduced optical aberrations and improved AF coverage. My impression was that huge-aperture capability was something that largely came along for the ride.....\"\n\nIn yet another Interview - senior Nikon engineer, Fujiwara San emphasized :\n\nhttps://dc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1239336.html\n\n\"From the standpoint of optical design, the shorter the better, so the optical designers demanded that it be made shorter. It gets harder. We had to make the body cover thinner and thinner, which made it difficult to ensure rigidity. After careful consideration of the need for space for a mechanical shutter and the thickness of the cover glass of the image sensor, we came to the conclusion that 16mm was the ultimate solution.....\n\n......In the case of the Nikon Z mount, we chose a mount with a large diameter because we prioritized overwhelming optical performance, but other companies have adopted a smaller mount that can appeal to its compact size and light weight to compete with single-lens reflex cameras. I think\"\n\nThe designers of the pair of Z Macros also emphasize improved features in several areas of their designs:\n\nhttps://qicai.fengniao.com/536/5365367.html\n\nEdited on Sep 03, 2023 at 02:14 PM · View previous versions\n\nAcuteShadows\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: On\n\np.7 #4 · p.7 #4 · Why was the larger Z mount necessary, exactly?\n\nLance B wrote:\n\nI am not sure what you are actually getting at.

As I am seeing this discussion, there is general agreement that Nikon is using the larger diameter. Differences are related to whether Nikon does use the Z mount in order to make lenses smaller, or if Nikon could do so, and whether Nikon uses the Z mount in order to make lenses better. Thus, in my view, your post seemed to answer a question that was already settled in the discussion.\n\nphilip_pj\n\nOffline\n\n    \n\n: On\n\np.7 #7 · p.7 #7 · Why was the larger Z mount necessary, exactly?\n\nSo far we have not seen Cosina take advantage of the large mounts offered by Canon and Nikon. The Z lenses they have brought to market for Nikon FF have all been repurposed directly from Sony/Leica M derivatives, small throat or no. APOs at 35mm and 50mm included.\n\nTheir recent 50mm f1.0 is a case in point - the design is identical for Leica M and Nikon Z, apart from beefing up the lens body for the Nikon mount and the extended length (the irony). It went from 485 grams and 74mm x 55mm (VM) to the Z specs of 600 grams and 68mm x 67mm. That 67-55 mms difference in length equates to the difference in FFD for the two mounts: 16mm (Z) and 28mm (M).\n\nMount diameters are: Leica M (44mm); Sony E (46mm); Canon (54mm); and Nikon Z (55mm).\n\nHow good is this 50/1? Good enough for many M faithful to sell their superfast 50mm lenses. Because Cosina has abandoned Sony users, they now only offer this one to Leica, Nikon and Canon users.

Rather it is to understand how necessary it was for Nikon to develop the new mount, and If necessary why?\n\nIn my view it was necessary for Nikon to develop a mount other than the F mount to more fully take advantage of what mirrorless cameras have to offer. I firmly believe that Nikon did the right thing doing so.\n\nIt likely wasn't necessary for Nikon to go as big with the mount as they did. Other manufactures have shown with their mirrorless lenses that high performing, small. and light (per category) lenses can be designed and manufactured with smaller mounts.\n\nCurrently, Nikon lenses tend to be heavier than the current releases (in the same category) from some other manufactures. As has been pointed out, Nikon is in its first generation of mirrorless lenses. The full potential of the Z mount probably has not been realized at this point. But speculating on what the next generation may look like provides no solid way to evaluate at this time. We can only reference the current status from all the manufactures. The claims that the Z mount is superior to other mounts remains unsubstantiated at this time. This extension of such a claim is not from Nikon, but from the fan base. Although Nikon does nothing to temper this extension, and sometimes seems to loosely play into it. That is marketing, no big deal. Nikon is not alone in this kind of thing.\n\n1bwana1\n\nOffline\n\n     \n\n: On\n\np.7 #11 · p.7 #11 · Why was the larger Z mount necessary, exactly?\n\nphilip_pj wrote:\n\nSo far we have not seen Cosina take advantage of the large mounts offered by Canon and Nikon.

Think about holding a small print at arm's length and then ask random people if the image is sharp. If 50% or more people consider it \"sharp\" then it passes the test at that shutter speed. However, most of the people who use expensive cameras want images that are sharp to the level of the individual pixels of the image, i.e. similar to what one would get using a tripod. When this criteria is used, completely different results are obtained.\n\nFotomagazin's test using various cameras and 70-200/2.8 lenses was published a few years ago. Nikonrumors shows the summary table for 200mm here:\n\nhttps://nikonrumors.com/2021/07/22/nikon-z7ii-ibis-compared-with-other-cameras.aspx/#more-159371\n\nThe A9II + 70-200/2.8 GM (V. 1, not the current one) gave \"very good\" sharpness down to 1/50s, while the Nikon Z7 gave \"very good\" sharpness down to 0.6 seconds exposure time. What the specific criteria are that Fotomagazin used I don't know since I don't have a copy of the magazine where the test was published.\n\nDuade Paton's 180-600 vs. 200-600 test however illustrated very clearly how different the performance of the two stabilization systems is when using a long lens.\n\nMove to 6:54 in the timeline for the beginning of the comparison in stability. In this case Paton seems specifically interested in hand-held videos and the stability of those but anyway the difference is quite startling. Sony is supposed to be technology leader in cameras and Minolta invented the sensor-moving stabilization (which Sony got by acquiring Konica-Minolta's camera business and various brands have since produced their own versions of it) so it's surprising that Sony hasn't been able to put in a better stabilization performance here. I can't believe that the optical stabilization of the lens is the issue here (since both the 70-200mm's and 180(200)-600mm point as Nikon having the lead here, and my own experience with Nikon DSLR and mirrorless products suggests that the very high level of stabilization is specifically achieved by combining in-camera and in-lens VR systems as that kind of viewfinder stability is certainly not seen in the Nikon DSLRs. I tested my VR 300/2.8 G II with the Z6 II and D850 and was shocked how hard it was to hand-hold the 300 with the D850 after using it on the Z6 II for a bit, the viewfinder images was just bouncing around a lot with the DSLR and returning to the Z camera it became rock steady again. (Many here probably know how much I like the optical viewfinder but in this aspect the Z wins by a country mile thanks to the advanced stabilization technology they've been able to put in the FX mirrorless offerings). I thinkk that the narrow mount (and image circle of the lenses) could be holding Sony back, since they're certainly not known to lack in engineering ability or resources. Considering Sony's long experience in video cameras (from what I've read their camcorders with long zooms are highly regarded for stability) it is even more baffling how they could let the comparative newcomer (Nikon) get the upper hand in the video stability when using long lenses hand held.\n\nIf someone can demonstrate evidence that refutes Paton's findings (or those of Fotomagazin) by all means present them. No, don't quote figures from the CIPA stabilization test as it only considers the lowest imaginable standard for sharpness in the determination of how many stops the stabilization helps with hand-held stability.\n\n1bwana1\n\nOffline\n\n     \n\n: On\n\np.7 #14 · p.7 #14 · Why was the larger Z mount necessary, exactly?\n\nilkka_nissila wrote:\n\nThe EV figures for stabilization that Sony would quote probably reflect the results of the CIPA test, which only requires a very low level of sharpness to be achieved and does not test the ability of the system to produce images that are truly sharp.

When this criteria is used, completely different results are obtained.\n\nFotomagazin's test using various cameras and 70-200/2.8 lenses was published a few years ago. Nikonrumors shows the summary table for 200mm here:\n\nhttps://nikonrumors.com/2021/07/22/nikon-z7ii-ibis-compared-with-other-cameras.aspx/#more-159371\n\nThe A9II + 70-200/2.8 GM (V. 1, not the current one) gave \"very good\" sharpness down to 1/50s, while the Nikon Z7 gave \"very good\" sharpness down to 0.6 seconds exposure time. What the specific criteria are that Fotomagazin used I don't know since I don't have a copy of the magazine where the test was published.\n\nDuade Paton's 180-600 vs. 200-600 test however illustrated very clearly how different the performance of the two stabilization systems is when using a long lens.\n\nMove to 6:54 in the timeline for the beginning of the comparison in stability. In this case Paton seems specifically interested in hand-held videos and the stability of those but anyway the difference is quite startling. Sony is supposed to be technology leader in cameras and Minolta invented the sensor-moving stabilization (which Sony got by acquiring Konica-Minolta's camera business and various brands have since produced their own versions of it) so it's surprising that Sony hasn't been able to put in a better stabilization performance here. I can't believe that the optical stabilization of the lens is the issue here (since both the 70-200mm's and 180(200)-600mm point as Nikon having the lead here, and my own experience with Nikon DSLR and mirrorless products suggests that the very high level of stabilization is specifically achieved by combining in-camera and in-lens VR systems as that kind of viewfinder stability is certainly not seen in the Nikon DSLRs. I tested my VR 300/2.8 G II with the Z6 II and D850 and was shocked how hard it was to hand-hold the 300 with the D850 after using it on the Z6 II for a bit, the viewfinder images was just bouncing around a lot with the DSLR and returning to the Z camera it became rock steady again. (Many here probably know how much I like the optical viewfinder but in this aspect the Z wins by a country mile thanks to the advanced stabilization technology they've been able to put in the FX mirrorless offerings). I thinkk that the narrow mount (and image circle of the lenses) could be holding Sony back, since they're certainly not known to lack in engineering ability or resources. Considering Sony's long experience in video cameras (from what I've read their camcorders with long zooms are highly regarded for stability) it is even more baffling how they could let the comparative newcomer (Nikon) get the upper hand in the video stability when using long lenses hand held.\n\nIf someone can demonstrate evidence that refutes Paton's findings (or those of Fotomagazin) by all means present them. No, don't quote figures from the CIPA stabilization test as it only considers the lowest imaginable standard for sharpness in the determination of how many stops the stabilization helps with hand-held stability....Show more →\n\nSony claims it's new stabilization system as demonstrated in the newly released A7CR (7 step) is effective down to the one pixel level. I don't think That is the CIPA rating standard. Since the A7CR is a 60 megapixel sensor that should mean criticle sharpness at 7 steps. I will wait to see it myself before judging that."
