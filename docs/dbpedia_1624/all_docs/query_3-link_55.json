        "text": "In this tutorial, we will provide a concise overview of Nikon's current lineup of digital cameras, aiming to help photography beginners gain a general understanding of Nikon's product series.\n\nOur goal is to assist you in finding the ideal camera model that suits your needs.\n\nDesigned specifically to aid newcomers in their camera selection journey, this series aims to provide valuable assistance for purchasing a new camera.\n\nTo enhance the reading experience for beginners and ensure practicality, we will focus on discussing the popular and currently available models, while minimizing discussions on older discontinued models.\n\nSo, let's delve into the world of Nikon cameras and find the perfect match for your photography aspirations.\n\nIn this article, you will learn:\n\nNikon Camera Models: What You Need to Know\n\nTraditional Lineup: Nikon D-Series DSLR Cameras\n\nPopular Lineup: Nikon Z Series Mirrorless Cameras\n\nFor Moon-Shooting: COOLPIX Fixed Lens Cameras\n\nAction Cameras: Nikon KeyMission Series\n\nProduct Recommendation: A Great Assistant for Post-Processing in Photography\n\nNikon Camera Models: What You Need to Know\n\nIn this first section, we will introduce you to the different series of Nikon cameras, giving you a foundational understanding of their offerings.\n\nNikon cameras can be broadly categorized into four series:\n\nD-Series: DSLR Cameras\n\nZ-Series: Mirrorless Cameras\n\nCOOLPIX Series: Compact Point-and-Shoot Cameras\n\nKeyMission Series: Action Cameras\n\nNext, we will delve into each series, providing you with a comprehensive reference when it comes to choosing a Nikon camera.\n\nTraditional Lineup: Nikon D-Series DSLR Cameras\n\nNikon's history in camera manufacturing dates back to 1948. Since 1999, all Nikon DSLR camera models have been named using the format of a letter \"D\" followed by a number.\n\nWhen you come across a DSLR camera with a model name starting with \"D\" followed by a number (e.g., D850), it is most likely a Nikon DSLR. However, if the model name starts with a number followed by \"D\" (e.g., 850D), it is likely a Canon DSLR.\n\nSimilar to other major camera brands, the Nikon D-series DSLRs follow a pattern where shorter numbers indicate higher-end models.\n\nFor example, a single-digit model like the D6 represents Nikon's top-tier flagship camera, while a three-digit model like the D780 falls slightly lower in the lineup, and a four-digit model like the D3500 is Nikon's entry-level offering.\n\nWithin Nikon's D-series DSLRs with the same number of digits, a higher starting number indicates a higher-end model.\n\nFor instance, the D850, which starts with an 8, is a more advanced model compared to the D780, which starts with a 7. Similarly, the D7500, starting with a 7, is a step up from the D5600, which starts with a 5.\n\nFurthermore, the second digit from the left often indicates the generational relationship between models, although the specific increment between generations may vary.\n\nFor example, the D850 is the successor to the D810, the D7500 is the successor to the D7200, and the D5600 is the successor to the D5500.\n\nSpecifically, Nikon currently offers the following DSLR product lines:\n\nFull-frame Speed Flagship: Dx (e.g., D6)\n\nFull-frame Image Quality Flagship: D8x0 (e.g., D850)\n\nFull-frame Entry-level: D6X0/D7x0 (e.g., D780)\n\nAPS-C Speed Flagship: Dx00 (e.g., D500)\n\nAPS-C High-end: D7x00 (e.g., D7500)\n\nAPS-C Mid-range: D5x00 (e.g., D5600)\n\nAPS-C Entry-level: D3x00 (e.g., D3500)\n\n1. Full-frame DSLR Cameras\n\nNikon Dx Series\n\nThe Dx series (with a single-digit number following the \"D\") represents Nikon's full-frame speed flagship DSLR cameras.\n\nThese models epitomize Nikon's exceptional autofocus and continuous shooting capabilities, comparable to Canon's 1D series and Sony's A9 series. They are particularly suitable for professional sports and news photographers who require top-tier performance.\n\nThe lineage of this product line dates back to the D1 in 1999, with the latest model being the D6 released in 2020. The D6 currently stands as one of the most powerful DSLR cameras in terms of optical autofocus performance.\n\nNikon D8x0 Series\n\nThe D8x0 series represents Nikon's second most expensive lineup of full-frame DSLRs, emphasizing superior image quality, comparable to Canon's 5D series.\n\nThis series began with the D800 in 2012, with the latest model being the D850 released in 2017.\n\nThe D850 has received acclaim from renowned review institution DPReview as \"the best DSLR on the market today,\" making it the preferred choice for DSLR enthusiasts seeking ultimate image quality.\n\nNikon D7x0 and D6X0 Series\n\nThe D7x0 and D6X0 series offer relatively affordable and entry-level options within Nikon's full-frame DSLR lineup, comparable to Canon's 6D series.\n\nThe difference in the initial digit of the model names does not indicate two separate product lines. In fact, it stems from the negative impact caused by design flaws in the D600 released in 2012.\n\nTo regain trust, Nikon introduced the D750 in 2014 as a replacement, distinct from the D600.\n\nThe latest model in this series is the D780, launched in 2020. If your budget is around $2000, you primarily capture still photographs, and you are a DSLR enthusiast, the D780 would be an excellent choice for you.\n\n2. APS-C DSLR Cameras\n\nNikon Dx00 Series\n\nThe Dx00 series represents Nikon's speed flagship APS-C format DSLR cameras, offering strong autofocus and continuous shooting performance.\n\nThese cameras can be seen as the APS-C counterparts of the previously mentioned Dx series and are comparable to Canon's 7D series.\n\nThe lineage of this series can be traced back to the D100 in 2002, with the latest model being the D500 released in 2016. Currently, this series has been discontinued.\n\nNikon D7x00 Series\n\nThe D7x00 series is Nikon's high-end APS-C DSLR lineup, representing the best image quality among Nikon's APS-C cameras.\n\nIt offers a well-rounded package at a relatively moderate price point, following the traditional mainstream configuration, comparable to Canon's 00D series.\n\nThis series began with the D7000 in 2010, with the latest model being the D7500 released in 2017. It excels in image quality among APS-C cameras.\n\nNikon D5x00 Series\n\nThe D5x00 series is Nikon's mid-range APS-C DSLR lineup, offering slightly reduced features compared to the D7x00 series but at a more affordable price.\n\nThis series started with the D5000 in 2009, with the latest model being the D5600 released in 2016. Currently, this series has been discontinued.\n\nNikon D3x00 Series\n\nThe D3x00 series is Nikon's most affordable and entry-level DSLR lineup, beginning with the D3000 in 2009 and featuring the latest model, the D3500, released in 2018.\n\nThis series offers basic configurations and is suitable for individuals with a limited budget, a desire to own a DSLR, and no video requirements. Currently, this series has been discontinued.\n\nNikon Df Series\n\nNikon also has a special model called the Df, released in 2013. It features a retro design and a 16.2-megapixel full-frame sensor, reminiscent of film-era mechanical dials.\n\nHowever, it lacks video recording capabilities. With the addition of a meter coupling lever, the Df is compatible with non-chipped vintage lenses. Overall, the Df is a highly personalized product and has also been discontinued.\n\nSince the introduction of Nikon's Z mirrorless cameras in 2018, the release of new DSLR cameras has significantly slowed down. In July 2022, Nikon announced the cessation of new DSLR camera development.\n\nIf you are a first-time camera buyer and wish to avoid potential upgrade issues in the future, we highly recommend considering a mirrorless camera.\n\nFor more information on the differences between mirrorless and DSLR cameras, you can refer to our article: Mirrorless vs DSLR Cameras: Which is Best for You?\n\nYou can also check out a video shared by photographer Mitch Lally on YouTube, where he discusses whether or not you should consider purchasing a DSLR.\n\nPopular Lineup: Nikon Z Series Mirrorless Cameras\n\nSince the first appearance of mirrorless cameras in 2008, major camera manufacturers have been gradually developing and introducing their own mirrorless camera products.\n\nNikon is no exception, as they released the \"1\" series mirrorless cameras in 2011 (yes, the series is actually called \"1\").\n\nHowever, Nikon treated the \"1\" series as more of an experimental project and equipped the cameras with a small one-inch sensor, resulting in image quality comparable to compact cameras.\n\nConsequently, the series failed to gain widespread recognition and popularity among consumers. The project was eventually discontinued in 2015.\n\nHowever, as mirrorless cameras started gaining an edge over DSLRs in the competition, Nikon, as a traditional DSLR manufacturer, began to feel the threat.\n\nTherefore, Nikon made a strategic shift, resurrecting their mirrorless camera business and officially launching the Z series mirrorless system in 2018 with the introduction of the Z 6 and Z 7 cameras.\n\nThis time, the Z series mirrorless cameras were not just an experimental project for Nikon but represented the future direction of their development.\n\nOver the past three years, Nikon has focused its research, development, and production efforts on the Z series cameras, lenses, and accessories, aiming to keep pace with other manufacturers and secure a share in the growing mirrorless market.\n\nThe naming convention of Nikon's mirrorless cameras is similar to their DSLRs:\n\nFirstly, shorter numbers indicate higher-end models. For example, the Z 50 is an entry-level APS-C format camera, while the Z 5 offers better image quality as a full-frame camera.\n\nSecondly, when the numbers have the same length, a higher initial digit signifies a higher-end positioning. For instance, the Z 8 is positioned higher than the Z 7, which, in turn, is positioned higher than the Z 6.\n\n1. Full-frame Mirrorless Cameras\n\nNikon Z 9 Series\n\nThe Nikon Z 9 represents Nikon's most powerful flagship lineup. It was released on October 28, 2021.\n\nThis camera combines almost all of Nikon's cutting-edge technologies, including an advanced 45 million-pixel stacked CMOS sensor, EXPEED 7 image processor, intelligent subject tracking, and the ability to record N-RAW video at up to 8K/60p.\n\nThe Nikon Z 9 mirrorless camera sets a benchmark in terms of image quality, autofocus, continuous shooting, and video capabilities. And its price reflects its top-tier status, coming in at approximately $5,500.\n\nFor users with a generous budget, the only concerns when considering the Z 9 would be its potential performance overkill and the size and weight of the camera.\n\nNikon Z 8 Series\n\nThe Nikon Z 8 represents Nikon's high-value, semi-flagship lineup. The Z 8 was released on May 10, 2023, and shares similar overall specifications with the Z 9.\n\nHowever, the Z 8 features some simplified or downgraded aspects in terms of card slots, battery, and button design.\n\nNevertheless, compared to the price of Z 9, the Z 8 is priced at around $4,000, offering excellent value for money. It can be considered the highest-performing camera in the $4,000 price range.\n\nNikon Z 7 Series\n\nThe Z 7 is Nikon's full-frame high-end lineup primarily focused on delivering exceptional image quality. It currently has two generations of products.\n\nThe first generation (Z 7) was released in 2018, offering image quality that comes close to Nikon's highest-resolution DSLR, the D850.\n\nAdditionally, it features an advanced lens mount, reduced weight and size, improved autofocus performance for video, and the ability to record 10-bit Log externally.\n\nWhile the autofocus performance may be slightly behind Canon and Sony's models at the same price point, it has no significant drawbacks that are hard to accept.\n\nThe second generation (Z 7 II) was released in 2020 as an updated version of the first generation.\n\nThe main upgrades include the addition of an SD card slot, enhanced continuous shooting capabilities (increased buffer capacity and slightly improved shooting speed), improved autofocus capabilities (low-light autofocus and eye-detection autofocus for video), extended battery life, and support for 4K/60fps video recording.\n\nNikon Z 6 Series\n\nThe Z 6 series is Nikon's balanced mid-range full-frame mirrorless camera lineup and currently has two generations of products. The first generation (Z 6) was released in 2018, aiming to cater to both photo and video shooting.\n\nIt has comparable specifications to the Sony A7 III and even offers a better screen and viewfinder. However, it falls slightly short in terms of battery life and lens selection compared to Sony.\n\nThe second generation of the Z 6 (Z 6II) was released in 2020 as an updated version of the first generation.\n\nIt mainly added an SD card slot, improved continuous shooting performance (increased buffer capacity and slightly improved shooting speed), enhanced autofocus capabilities (low-light autofocus and eye-detection autofocus for video), and extended battery life.\n\nIt's a worthwhile option for users with a budget under $2,000.\n\nNikon Z 5 Series\n\nThe Z 5 series is Nikon's entry-level full-frame lineup targeted at a lower price point. The Z 5 was released in July 2020 and is another low-cost full-frame mirrorless camera priced around $1,000, following Canon's RP series.\n\nCompared to other models at a similar price point, the Z 5 offers excellent image quality and features such as in-body image stabilization, a high-resolution electronic viewfinder, and dual SD card slots.\n\nIt not only surpasses low-cost full-frame mirrorless cameras like the Canon RP in terms of performance but also provides a more comfortable user experience compared to older DSLR cameras like the D750.\n\nThe weaknesses of the Z 5 lie in its slower burst shooting speed and relatively modest video capabilities. Therefore, users who prioritize high-speed continuous shooting and primary video shooting should consider other options.\n\nHowever, overall, the Z 5 is currently our highly recommended full-frame mirrorless camera model at around $1,000.\n\n2. APS-C Mirrorless Cameras\n\nNikon Z 50 Series\n\nThe Z 50 is Nikon's mid-to-high-end APS-C product, released in 2019. It offers average performance and features, without standing out significantly. It faces competition from excellent models like the Canon R10, making the Z 50 not a particularly compelling choice.\n\nNikon Z fc Series\n\nThe Z fc is a special model from Nikon based on the Z 50, featuring a retro design. It was released in 2021 and takes inspiration from Nikon's iconic FM2 film camera.\n\nIn terms of internal specifications, the Z fc shares a high similarity with the Z 50, almost like a shell swap with minor differences.\n\nFor example, the Z fc has a side-flip screen and includes eye detection in video recording. Whether it's worth paying extra for the aesthetics depends on how appealing the design is to you.\n\nNikon Z 30 Series\n\nThe Z 30 is Nikon's entry-level APS-C product, released in 2022. It is positioned as a Vlog camera, competing with the likes of the Sony ZV-E10. Specifically, the Z 30 optimizes its design for amateur Vlog users based on the specifications of the Z 50.\n\nIt includes a side-flip screen, removes the electronic viewfinder, improves microphone audio, and adds a recording indicator light.\n\nFor Moon-Shooting: COOLPIX Fixed Lens Cameras\n\nCOOLPIX is Nikon's series of fixed lens cameras that use 1/2.3-inch or even smaller image sensors with effective pixels not exceeding 20 million.\n\nThe theoretical image quality of these cameras is difficult to surpass the latest smartphones, and their straight-out-of-camera results cannot match the automatic effects produced by smartphone algorithms.\n\nIn this situation, COOLPIX cameras face challenges and don't enjoy high popularity. However, they still have one ace up their sleeve: powerful zoom and telephoto capabilities!\n\nAmong the currently available COOLPIX cameras on the market, except for a few models starting with \"W\" that emphasize all-weather durability (waterproof, shockproof, dustproof, freeze-proof), the rest boast significant zoom ratios.\n\nFor example, the compact A1000 can achieve an optical zoom equivalent to 24mm to 840mm.\n\nThe P series of COOLPIX cameras are known for their exceptional zoom and telephoto capabilities. Currently, there are two models available, the P950 and P1000, both resembling DSLR-style cameras and priced below $1000.\n\nThe P950 offers an optical zoom range equivalent to 24-2000mm, while the P1000 goes up to an equivalent of 24-3000mm. What does 3000mm mean?\n\nThis means that you can capture the entire surface of the moon clearly using the P1000. Let's take a look at this photo shared on the Nikon official website, taken with the P1000.\n\nSuch extraordinary telephoto capabilities have turned the P series into an \"internet sensation\" in recent years. Many online videos shot with the P1000 have gained millions of views.\n\nHowever, for the majority of beginners and amateur enthusiasts, is it necessary to spend hundreds of dollars on a \"peculiar\" camera that can capture close-ups of the moon but only delivers smartphone-level image quality? That's a decision for you to make.\n\nTo learn more about tips and techniques for photographing the moon, please take a look at our tutorial: 7 Expert Tips for Capturing Stunning Moon Photos.\n\nAction Cameras: Nikon KeyMission Series\n\nAs an action camera under the Nikon brand, the KeyMission series has minimal presence and is challenging to find on the market.\n\nWhen it comes to action cameras, GoPro is renowned for its popularity and stability, while DJI's Action and Insta360's One RS stand out for their innovative features. So, we do not recommend purchasing Nikon's KeyMission series action cameras.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about choosing an action camera, we suggest checking out our article: Top 5 Action Cameras for Capturing Your Adventures.\n\nProduct Recommendation: A Great Assistant for Post-Processing in Photography\n\nNow, as we wrap up this tutorial about how to choose a Nikon camera, we want to introduce you to a fantastic tool that can greatly enhance your post-processing workflow: TourBox.\n\nWhen it comes to photography, capturing the perfect shot is just the beginning.
