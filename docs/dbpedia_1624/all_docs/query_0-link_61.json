        "text": "In this guide, we’re counting off the best Nikon lenses for mirrorless cameras and DSLRs. Whether you’re using a Z-mount or F-mount camera, you’ll find lenses here to tempt you, with a broad cross-section of zooms and primes that our team have found to be particularly impressive.\n\nAs well as having two different lines of camera, Nikon also offers two sensor sizes – full-frame and the smaller APS-C. Nikon refers to these as FX and DX respectively, so if a lens has “DX” in the name, you know it’s only suited to APS-C cameras. FX lenses will work on both, but may be a little heavy when mounted to DX bodies. They’ll also have a narrower field of view, due to the crop factor.\n\nWhether you want to shoot portraits, landscapes, architecture images, street photos or whatever else, there will be a fantastic Nikon lens here to help make it happen. We’ve made sure to include budget-friendly picks as well as the pro stuff, so don’t worry if your funds are limited. So, all that’s left to do is dive in!\n\nQuick Navigation\n\nBest Mirrorless Lens\n\nHere are our picks of top lenses to buy for Nikon’s mirrorless Z system. Featuring some absolutely outstanding glass, the Nikon Z system of lenses provides a selection of professional and affordable optics for full-frame and APS-C cameras in the range. This isn’t a comprehensive selection of lenses – just a round-up of our team’s particular favourites. And, we’ve included some third-party options as well as lenses made by Nikon.\n\nNikon Z 50mm f1.8 S Lens\n\nDesigned for Nikon's Z series compact system cameras, the NIKKOR Z 50mm F1.8 S lens is a fast prime lens aimed at replicating the human eye's field of view. Edge-to-edge clarity and pristine image reproduction are just a few of the highlights of this impressive lens. A new, powerful stepping motor ensures accurate and silent autofocus for both stills and videos.\n\n£539.00 View\n\nPros:\n\nVery affordable to buy\n\nLightweight and portable\n\nCan double up as portrait lens on a DX camera\n\nCons:\n\nNo stabilisation\n\nLet’s start with something straightforward – and affordable! This is one of the most reasonably priced lenses for the Z mount at the moment, and happily it’s also one of the most useful. When mounted to a camera with a full-frame sensor, the Nikon Z 50mm f1.8 S provides roughly the equivalent to the field of view of a human eye. This makes it perfect for general-purpose photography and capturing things in a naturalistic way – street and documentary shooters should find it useful. All this is bolstered by the f1.8 maximum aperture, which allows for the creation of shallow depth of field and vivid bokeh.\n\nNikon Z 35mm f1.8 S Lens\n\nCapture pristine images with the NIKKOR Z 35mm F1.8 Z from Nikon. This prime lens offers a razor sharp image across the frame that is characteristically unlike traditional fast lenses of the same focal length. Point light sources, such as in night time landscapes are where this lens excels; retaining focus definition while also capturing smooth and natural bokeh in out-of-focus areas.\n\n£809.00 View\n\nPros:\n\nSuperb sharpness with excellent rendering of “point” light sources\n\nReliable autofocus\n\nDoes brilliantly in backlit situations\n\nCons:\n\nf1.8, not f1.4 (it’s a shame but not unforgivable)\n\nA wider prime, well suited to landscapes and architecture shooting, the Nikon Z 35mm f1.8 S boasts edge-to-edge sharpness thanks to a sophisticated internal optical design, and it particularly excels at rendering “point” light sources, i.e. distant small lights of the kind you might see in night-time landscapes. Autofocus is fast and accurate, as you’d expect from a nippy mirrorless system lens, and the body is built to be resistant to dust and drips, standing you in good stead for an outdoor shoot.\n\nNikon Z 85mm f1.8 S Lens\n\nThe Nikon NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.8 S is a premium S-Line fast-focusing lens that delivers incredible detail throughout the frame. Whether shooting stills or video, this full-frame mirrorless lens lets photographers portray subjects with astonishing clarity. The Nikon NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.8 S offers a flattering perspective, breath-taking resolution, stunning bokeh in addition to focus and life like accuracy compensation. This 85mm prime lens is perfect for shooting portraits, wedding and fashion photography as well as street photography and interviews. In a nutshell this lens is the lens for any situation which needs to highlight the human form and can satisfy the needs of a photographer as well as a documentary filmmaker alike.\n\n£719.00 View\n\nPros:\n\nLovely bokeh quality\n\nSilent focusing system\n\nShort close focusing distance\n\nCons:\n\nf1.8, not f1.4 (we just wanted that bit more)\n\nThis is definitely a good choice if you’re planning to shoot portraits with your Nikon Z camera – the short telephoto focal length of the Nikon Z 85mm f1.8 S is ideal for flattering your subjects and making them look as good as possible. The f1.8 maximum aperture also means you can create the kind of shallow depth of field that’s essential for good portraiture, and the minimum focal distance is just 0.8m, in case you want to get really close. Anti-reflective Nano Crystal Coat and a smooth, silent multi-focusing system round out a seriously well-featured lens.\n\nNikon Z 24-70mm f2.8 S Lens\n\nIntroducing the first Nikon Z f/2.8 Pro Lens - the fast NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S. Nikon today introduces the first of the f2.8 pro lenses for Nikon Z. The NIKKOR Z 24-70mm f/2.8 S is a professional lens that boasts an exceptionally compact build, advanced optics, and extensive weather sealing. Stills or video, this workhorse lens delivers superb results.\n\n£2,024.00 View\n\nPros:\n\nUltra-sharp throughout zoom range\n\nCustomisable control ring and function button\n\nComprehensive weather sealing\n\nCons:\n\nPriced for professionals\n\nCovering the workhorse focal range beloved by professionals worldwide, the Nikon Z 24-70mm f2.8 S is designed for those who are really planning to put their Nikon Z camera through its paces. As well as offering ultra-sharp performance, it’s also designed to be extensively customised to just the way you like to work, with a control ring that can be set to cover your preferred function, as well as a function button with 21 different assignable options. It’s built tough, too, with plenty of weather sealing, so wherever the next challenge takes you, the Nikon Z 24-70mm f2.8 S will be able to keep up.\n\nLensbaby Velvet 56mm f1.6 Lens for Nikon Z\n\nThe Lensbaby Velvet 56mm f1.6 is a lens that's packed with versatility and creative opportunity. It is primarily a portraiture lens that will produce velvety, glowing and ethereal images, but at the same time, has a 1:2 macro ratio enabling the capture of stunning macro photography. Using Lensbaby's trademark optics, you can capture creative images that are beautifully dream-like images with wider apertures as well as sharp and unique shots as you stop down, giving give a film-like-feel. The true beauty of this lens is that whether you are shooting portraiture or macro work, you can achieve a unique look and feel to you images, reminiscent of classic film cameras and lenses. It match the feel of the images you take, the lens has an old-fashioned design to its barrel exterior - An all-metal body with a clear-anodised finish and engraved aperture/focus markings.\n\n£449.00 View\n\nPros:\n\nDistinctive ethereal look to images\n\nAffordable\n\nWorks great in close-up\n\nCons:\n\nWon’t suit every situation\n\nNo autofocus\n\nLensbaby has done a great job of converting its catalogue to be compatible with the Nikon Z range. Great for portrait and macro work alike, Lensbaby’s Velvet 56mm f1.6 Lens produces images with a soft and velvety look at its maximum aperture of f/1.6, and then as you stop down produces images that are sharper, but still retain a distinctive look. Its 1:2 macro capabilities make it well-suited for close-ups, while the 56mm focal length is good enough for portraits but is also pleasingly general-purpose. It’s a great lens to pair with your Nikon Z camera for experimentation and pushing things a little further.\n\nSamyang MF 85mm f1.4 Lens for Nikon Z\n\nThe Samyang MF 85mm f1.4 - Nikon Z Fit is one of Samyang's first lenses for the Nikon Z mount. It is a fast-aperture, manual-focus, short telephoto prime lens and creates incredibly vivid colours with soft, pleasing out-of-focus area (bokeh). This lens is ideal for low light photography thanks to its bright f1.4 maximum aperture. It creates a luscious mood in photographs, featuring beautiful bokeh, particularly in portraits and city light shots, where the background is out of focus. This is all thanks to the lens' rounded aperture having 8 curved blades. The Samyang MF 85mm f1.4 Z is the creative tool photographers dream about.\n\n£279.00 View\n\nPros:\n\nAffordable option for portraits\n\nf1.4\n\nCons:\n\nNo autofocus\n\nSamyang has also got in on the Z-mount action, producing this manual-focus 85mm short telephoto lens that’s great for the budget-conscious portrait photographer. Available for a price significantly lower than Nikon’s own version, it doesn't have all the same features and functionality, but does provide an f/1.4 maximum aperture that’s actually a little better than the Nikon, which manages an f1.8. So, if you can live without autofocus and want to save a bundle, this is something to bear in mind.\n\nBest DSLR Lens\n\nHere, we’ve collated a selection of our favourite lenses for Nikon’s venerable F-mount DSLR range. While new lenses aren’t really being developed for this range, it includes a huge selection of stone-cold classics and you could spend a happy photo-taking life shooting entirely on F-mount – many people have. And remember that these lenses can easily be converted to work with mirrorless Z-mount cameras via the FTZ adapter.\n\nNikon 50mm f1.4 G AF-S Lens\n\nThe Nikon AF-S 50mm f/1.4G lens is a fast, fixed focal-length Nikkor lens with a built-in Silent Wave Motor (SWM) to enable smooth and quiet autofocus. The high-quality optical system delivers fantastic image quality, minimising both flare and chromatic aberration. Ideal for portrait photography, general use, and video recording, this lens has an ultra-fast maximum aperture of f1.4, with a unique rounded 9-blade diaphragm for smooth, natural bokeh.\n\n£413.00 View\n\nPros:\n\nVersatile focal length\n\nDoes well in low light\n\nConverts to a portrait lens on DX-format\n\nCons:\n\nNot weather sealed\n\nNo stabilisation\n\nThis fast lens is a great all-purpose optic for your Nikon DSLR camera. It covers a field of view similar to that of a human eye, making it great for street and documentary work, while its f/1.4 aperture gives it a real edge in low light. Also, if you mount it on a DX-format camera you’ll get a focal length of about 75mm, which makes it a good choice for portraiture. However you choose to use it, you’ll find the Nikon 50mm f1.4 G AF-S Lens to be a stalwart companion you’ll want in your kit bag every time.\n\nSigma 105mm f2.8 Macro EX DG OS HSM for Nikon F\n\nThe Sigma 105mm f2.8 Macro EX DG OS HSM is a high performance, large aperture medium telephoto macro lens that comes with an Optical Stabiliser (OS).

Improvements include enhanced AF tracking and exposure control, edge-to-edge sharpness, minimum focus distance, and a new magnesium-alloy lens barrel.

It’s extremely light at just 230g, making it an ideal companion for the lighter DX DSLRs, and provides a perspective that’s manifestly different to a standard kit lens. The autofocus is near-silent too, so it’s a solid choice for video use, and getting striking shots that draw your viewer into a frame.\n\nNikon 85mm f3.5 G ED AF-S VR DX Micro Nikkor Lens\n\nThe Nikon AF-S DX Micro Nikkor 85mm f3.5G ED VR Lens is a compact and lightweight DX format Macro lens with high-quality optics.
