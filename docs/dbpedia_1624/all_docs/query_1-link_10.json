        "text": "Wondering Who Makes the Best Camera Lenses? Let’s Discuss!\n\nWritten by Colette Nichol, Solo Filmmaker and Story Strategist\n\nEstimated reading time: 8 minutes\n\nIn the world of filmmaking, video production and photography, the quality of your lenses can be as crucial as the camera itself. Different lenses have different capabilities that can significantly impact your final product. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the types of lenses available and list 10 of the best camera lenses, while addressing some common questions about lens quality, brands, and cost.\n\nBut first, if you’re just wondering which brands manufacture the best lenses in the world, here’s a quick answer. Zeiss, Canon, Nikon, and Sigma are the top makers of SLR lenses which can be used in photography and video production on DSLRs and mirrorless cameras.\n\nThe top makers of cinema lenses include Zeiss, Leitz, Angenieux, Cooke, Fujifilm, and Arri.\n\nYou can also get good cinema lenses by Canon and Sigma. If you want to buy cinema lenses, rather than rent them, and you’re not a millionaire, you’ll want to look at Rokinon for affordable, though not premium, options.\n\nYou can view the top SLR lenses for photo and video by price, on B&H Photo Video here.\n\nTypes of Camera Lenses\n\n1. Prime Lenses\n\nKnown for their fixed focal length, they offer superior sharpness and a wider aperture. A fixed focal length means that the lens does not zoom. It’s field of view or frame is one size only.\n\n2. Zoom Lenses\n\nOffer a range of focal lengths, providing versatility. You can zoom in and out to adjust the frame.\n\n3. Telephoto Lenses\n\nIdeal for capturing distant subjects. These ultra zoom lenses are used in sports and wildlife photography and video.\n\n4. Wide-Angle Lenses\n\nPerfect for capturing expansive scenes. If you’re using a full-frame camera, anything that’s 24mm or lower is considered a wide angle.\n\n5. Macro Lenses\n\nDesigned for extreme close-ups with sharp detail. I love using my macro lens for nature shots and also weird portraits. For video work, they can be fun to use but they are challenging. A macro lens allows you to get much closer to the subject than with a normal lens.\n\n6. Cinema Lenses\n\nSpecifically built for filmmaking, offering smooth focus and aperture control. Cinema lenses have T stops rather than F stops. They allow you to more easily use a focus puller on your lens. They also provide the best image quality of any type of lens. They can cost as much as $150,000 for a cinema zoom lens. An average-priced cinema lens is about $5000 to $10,000 per prime lens.\n\n4 Best Canon Lenses for Video Shooters on a Budget\n\nI shoot on Canon and Blackmagic, though I’ve used most major camera brands over the years including Panasonic and Sony. But I do love Canon lenses! If you’re a video shooter with an entry-level or intermediate Canon camera, check out these lenses. If you want recommendations for other brands, check out this post on camera lenses for video here. And keep in mind that you’ll need to know your lens mount before you buy a lens!\n\n8 Best Camera Lenses from $2000 to $13,000\n\nNow keep in mind that while these lenses might be great, you need to get a lens that works for YOUR camera! And you also need to get a lens that works for you style of shooting. There’s no such thing as the absolute best lens. You have to get the right lens for you.\n\n1. Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS III USM: A versatile telephoto lens.\n\n2. Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM: A top-notch zoom lens for full-frame Sony cameras.\n\n3. Sigma 85mm f/1.4 DG HSM Art: A prime lens known for its sharpness. Best for photography on a full-frame camera.\n\n4. Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 14-24mm f/2.8G ED: A good wide-angle lens for photo and video.\n\n5. Zeiss Otus 1.4/55: If you’re a photographer or video creator shooting on a full-frame this prime lens is going to give you insane quality. But also, it’s pretty darn expensive.\n\n6. Panasonic Lumix G X Vario 12-35mm f/2.8 II: A great choice for crop-sensor Micro Four Thirds cameras and covers the low to mid range nicely.\n\n7. Canon RF 28-70mm f/2L USM: A crisp and high-quality zoom lens for Canon’s mirrorless cameras. This is best for the full-frame series not the crop-sensors.\n\n8. Leica Noctilux-M 50mm f/0.95 ASPH: A luxury option for outstanding detail and image quality. The lens apparently outperforms the human eye. And frankly, for $13,000 it had better!\n\nCommon Questions\n\nWhich company has the best camera lens?\n\nThis varies based on your specific needs and camera compatibility. Canon, Nikon, Sony, Sigma, and Zeiss are all renowned for their quality lenses.\n\nWhich lenses are best for filmmaking?\n\nCinema lenses from brands like Zeiss, Cooke, and Arri are often favoured for their optical quality and build. However, many DSLR and mirrorless lenses also perform well. Unless you’re shooting for the big screen a regular (i.e. not cinema lens) is just fine.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend renting lenses if you’re shooting short film because it’s much cheaper than buying and you can make more “sophisticated” lenses selections rather than relying on the lenses you own.\n\nDoes the brand of camera lens matter?\n\nWhile the brand can be a sign of quality, the specific lens characteristics and compatibility with your camera are more important. If you need a fast lens, then getting the right minimum f-stop will be more important than which brand you buy. Also, you typically want to make sure you don’t have to use an adapter. So make sure the lens is made to go with your camera’s lens mount.\n\nDo Canon or Nikon make better lenses?\n\nBoth brands have their strengths. Choice should be based on compatibility with your camera and specific lens needs. While I’m a Canon shooter, I can’t deny that Nikon makes good lenses. However, in my opinion, it makes absolutely no sense to put a Nikon lens on a Canon camera and vice versa.\n\nGet the right lens for your camera and try not to use an adapter unless strictly necessary.\n\nWhat is the most expensive camera lens?\n\nSpecialized lenses like the Leica Noctilux-M or the Canon EF 1200mm f/5.6L USM are among the most expensive SLR lenses. However the most expenses lenses are cinema zooms which start at around $100,000 per lens.\n\nWhat makes a camera lens more expensive?\n\nFactors include optical quality, aperture size, focal length, build quality, and specific features like image stabilization or weather sealing. Typically high-quality telephoto lenses are quite expenses because they need high quality glass, a wide aperture, as well as premium build quality with weathersealing.\n\nWhat makes a good quality camera lens?\n\nWhen I’m looking for a lens, I’m trying to balance a low fixed aperture (which allows me to shoot more easily in low light) with sharp image quality, colour saturation, and autofocus. I don’t want a lens that feels like it’s made of plastic unless I’m looking for a walkabout lens that needs to be ultra light weight.\n\nSharpness, clarity, build quality, aperture size, and minimal distortion are key indicators of a good quality lens. But honestly, sometimes you’ll sacrifice quality just to have a lens that weighs less! No point having a killer lens if it’s too heavy to take anywhere. And yes, I speak from experience.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nChoosing the right lens is a important decision for any filmmaker, photographer, or video creator.\n\nWhile there are many great lenses from various manufacturers, the best lens for you depends on your specific needs, camera compatibility, and budget. Remember, a good lens is an investment that can elevate your work and bring your creative vision to life.\n\nAnd finally, don’t get trapped in the gear-decision rabbit hole for too long. You can always sell your lens if it’s not the right fit. The most important thing is to be shooting!\n\nMore Lens & Camera Articles\n\n⭐ The Best Lens For Video Hands Down\n\n⭐ How To Know What Lenses Are Compatible with My Camera\n\n⭐ What is a fisheye lens?"
