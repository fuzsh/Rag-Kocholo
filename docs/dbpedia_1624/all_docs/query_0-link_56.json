It's a compact powerhouse, boasting unmatched performance, making handheld shooting a breeze. This lens is a milestone for Nikon, being their shortest and lightest 600mm prime lens ever created, designed with a near-silent AF drive system to keep up with fast and erratic subjects, perfect for capturing those fleeting moments in wildlife or sports photography.\n\n2018: 3 lenses - Two primes and one zoom.\n\n2019: 7 lenses - Three primes and four zooms.\n\n2020: 8 lenses - The year they introduced their first telephoto for the Z-Series.\n\n2021: 9 lenses - The debut of the first super-telephoto lens, the Nikon Z 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 VR S. It was optically fantastic but big and heavy, not ideal for outdoor photographers who prefer handheld shooting.\n\n2022: 6 lenses - Four new super-telephoto lenses, with focal lengths ranging from 400mm to 800mm.\n\n2023: 8 lenses - Only one new super telephoto, the 600mm. But it's a game-changer - leaner, meaner, and designed around a size-reducing Phase Fresnel (PF) lens element. This makes it lighter, better balanced, and more budget-friendly compared to other super-telephoto lenses. There are plenty more features here, but this is not a product review. Check out all the specs here.\n\nNikon's strategy is all about precision and catering to photographers' unique needs. They didn't rush into the super-telephoto game but carefully crafted lenses tailored to specific photography demands. This approach reflects agility, adaptability, and a customer-centric mindset. They maintain a balance between predictability and pleasant surprises, keeping photographers on their toes.\n\nNikon's lens development strategy mirrors effective software product development. Just like their roadmap aligns with market trends and customer needs, software development should start with a clear vision rooted in user requirements. The iterative nature of Nikon's roadmap is similar to agile software development, emphasizing adaptability and responsiveness to customer preferences and industry dynamics. The balance between planned releases and unexpected innovations aligns with the flexibility required in software development, where roadmaps coexist with agile feature enhancements."
