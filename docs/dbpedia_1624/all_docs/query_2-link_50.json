        "text": "And the mirrorless camera race is on! Sony are way off in the lead, Nikon not too far behind, and Canon are still tying their shoelaces at the starting line.\n\nWho will win the race?\n\nWho is heading in the right direction?\n\nAnd who is crippling themselves?\n\nIn 2018 Sony released the A7III and it was so cheap and good that it shocked the world.\n\nSony: “We’re losing money on this body but hey look at what we can do!”\n\nThen Nikon released the Z6 the same year and everyone kind of just shrugged.\n\nNikon: “Hey don’t forget us! We’re going mirrorless too!”\n\nThis is unfortunate because if the A7III didn’t exist, the Z6 would’ve been really impressive! Everyone would’ve paid attention to the new Nikon Z system. But today the Z6 just sits there in the corner, quietly gathering dust and looking embarrassed.\n\nBut there’s a glimmer of hope in the future for Nikon! And it has to do with how Sony and Nikon have set themselves up for the future.\n\nSony vs. Nikon\n\nThe Sony A7III and Nikon Z6 mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras (MILC) are really similar. Even more similar than most photographers would think.\n\nAs a wedding photographer the Sony A7III and Nikon Z6 are both reliable choices for my purposes. However,\n\nSony is better at most things: autofocus, low light performance, native lens range, 3rd party lens support, dual card slots, exposure compensation dial, video, customisation, and battery life.\n\nNikon is better at some things: grip and handling, menu layout, monitor resolution, and touch screen.\n\nBoth are similar in size, and both suck at image stabilisation.\n\nIt is their similarities that determines where they go into the future. And that’s because it all comes down to which direction Sony decided to take way back in 2010, when they couldn’t possibly have foreseen the consequences.\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\nSony Handicapped Themselves with the E-Mount\n\nCrazy right? Problem is, it’s never going to get better. Not for full frame, anyway.\n\nThis is most noticeable in the Sony 5-axis In Body Image Stabilisation (IBIS). The Sony IBIS sucks so much, you might as well not have it. It’s terrible.\n\nHere’s why that is. Take a look at the full frame sensor on any Sony Alpha camera. You’ll notice something really rather odd:\n\nSony, what the hell? Why is your lens mount CUTTING OFF THE CORNERS of your full frame sensor? Wouldn’t this directly result in heavy vignetting, limit future lens designs, and unusable IBIS?\n\nIndeed, here is Nikon’s Z6 full frame sensor for comparison:\n\nSee how the mount is comfortably larger than the sensor? Now that’s a big mount! Almost intimidating how big it is…\n\nNikon: “You can’t even handle this mount Sony, it’s so big.”\n\nSony: “Wow that is a big mount Nikon. Fast, wide. Very impressive. Gosh I’m so embarrassed with my teeny weeny mount.”\n\nLet’s take a closer look again at the full frame sensor from Sony:\n\nIsn’t is ridiculous how the mount has to overlap the corners of the sensor? And the Sony IBIS is showing for it. They can’t improve their IBIS, whereas Nikon’s mount has plenty of room for the IBIS to jump around and party:\n\nIs the small mount a poor design choice, or perhaps just a misstep? I say neither.\n\nThat’s because:\n\nSony Cameras Were Originally Designed for APS-C ONLY, NOT Full Frame\n\nI’m pretty sure Sony had no intention of making full frame cameras. I’m quite certain they were instead supposed to be drinking buddies with Fujifilm, Nikon DX, Samsung NX and Canon EF-M. APS-C all the way baby!\n\nAnd so when they released the first Sony A7 way back in 2013, and the people loved it, that’s when they probably panicked.\n\nSony: “No one was supposed to like full frame! Everyone laughed at our NEX cameras so we made the A7 for a laugh! It was only supposed to segment the market so people would buy the smaller, slimmer APS-C cameras. Quick, convince the public this is what we meant to do all along!”\n\nThat’s probably how it went down. And they successfully kept up the charade for as long as they could — and did an incredible job innovating, despite their circumstances!\n\nThey designed a lot of amazing lenses: 85mm F1.8, 24mm F1.4!\n\nShared design and proprietary information with 3rd party manufacturers: Sigma, Tamron, Samyang!\n\nSo unless they physically change the sensor or all the mounts and lenses that they’ve ever made, it’s the end of the line for Sony.\n\nI don’t think Sony knows which direction to take in the next few years\n\nAnd I think they know they’re basically screwed in the MILC game and focus on the PS5 and video games. That capable full frame sensor of theirs can’t move. And they’ve already built all these expensive systems around the E-Mount, which have pretty much hit the physical limit of lens design.\n\nThink about it: they even stopped bothering trying to put stabilisation into their lenses. The only full frame lenses with Optical SteadyShot (OSS) are all F4 lenses, like the 16–35mm F4.\n\nKnow which lenses do have OSS? oh that’s right, those designed for APS-C.\n\nAnd Sony has this hangup where they have to stick everything into small and compact bodies. Sony thinks they’re doing everyone a favour — which is nice, I like small and light — but it’s not comfortable to hold in the hand. Give me a bigger hand grip any day, like Nikon and Canon cameras.\n\nYou know where small and light camera bodies makes sense? Again, APS-C.\n\nThat’s why Nikon has a Chance\n\nAnd can take the lead in the mirrorless full frame race!\n\nNikon does a lot of things worse than Sony, but all these faults are features that can still be fixed. Especially that unreliable autofocus. Nikon, go and copy Canon and get onto that dual pixel autofocus! You can do it!\n\nThat’s because,\n\nNikon is SPRINTING to Catch Up to Sony\n\nSony was smart and got into the MILC game early, well before the others even put their shoes on. I’m sure they looked at Fujifilm and noticed which way the wind was blowing. They have at least 5 years ahead of the competition. But Nikon is quickly catching up, and may even surpass Sony in the next few years in what they offer.\n\nFor example, I’m a wedding photographer. My image priorities are to capture moments and expressions at the wedding. Shooting wide open, I expect from a lens 3 things:\n\nShallow depth of field and dreamy bokeh\n\nSolid low light performance\n\nQuick and reliable autofocus\n\nThat’s why I need lenses that are either fast primes or fast zooms.\n\nSo to a wedding photographer, this is what the lens roadmap of Sony, Canon, Nikon and Fujifilm (APS-C) looks like:\n\nNotice how in 2018 Nikon is blazing right out the gate AND looking towards the future?\n\nMeanwhile, Canon joined the race in 2018 too but their pace is different: they’re gonna continue cautiously moving forward, and wait for the moment when Sony burns out and Nikon stumbles. Sneaky sneaky.\n\nConclusion\n\nIs Sony crushing the competition? Yes.\n\nDoes Nikon have potential? Absolutely.\n\nTo be honest I’d like Nikon to come out ahead — that way everyone wins. And everyone can go do something else outside of the crowded and waning photo industry:\n\nNikon can focus on cameras for professional photographers.\n\nCanon can focus on gear for cinema.\n\nFujifilm can focus on physical film and photo paper.\n\nSony can focus on music and game consoles.\n\nThe real 1st place winner? Samsung — they made that killer NX1, then left the game early to make great phones instead.\n\n2nd place goes to Panasonic, who are making the lithium batteries that everybody else relies on.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n5 Sony Cameras That Died Before They Could Shine\n\nSony 35mm F1.8 | Review\n\nSony 85mm F1.8 | Review\n\n5 Unexpected Things to Expect from Your Wedding Photographer"
