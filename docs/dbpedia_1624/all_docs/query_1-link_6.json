        "text": "Hung Truong\n\nI have two Nikon (Nikkor) 12~24 lenses and both have been outstanding performers, and at f 4.0 the slower aperture is not much of a problem, since subject movement is minimized across the field of view by the very wide angle, allowing for use of a slow shutter speed and still minimizing subject movement artifacts. I would recommend the 12~24 f 4.0 lens.\n\nAbout other manufactueres' lenses; it is noted above that (1) they fill in gaps in the Nikon lineup and that is true, and may be a very good reason for you to buy one. Image quality is quite good for many of the secondary manufacture lenses, and if image quality were the only concern, I'd say that you should be relatively happy with any well-reviewed lens out there, be it Nikon, or Sigma, Tamron, etc.\n\nBut there's more to the equation: Go to any camera swap meet, look at E-Bay prices, peruse (or advertise on) Craig's List. When a secondary manufacturer lens hits the secondary market (e.g.: used) market, there is a significant loss of interest in those lenses. They may boil down two several reasons besides the obvious one of not having the Nikon imprimatur.\n\nOne of those has been prior build quality. For years Nikon made lenses that were extremely solidly built; their old AIS and AI lenses which I have have never seen a failure due to manufacturing or build quality problems, in fact, I can't think of even one lens that has ever failed me in 35 years.\n\nOf course with auto-focus lenses, there are more moving parts and with VR lenses, even more, so the integrity of the manufacturer becomes even more important, as by their very nature such lenses are bound to fail more often, particularly if they receive heavy use or exposure to the elements. That occurs for me a lot in 'street' shooting, especially when carrying two cameras at all times, which tend to cause the lenses to knock into one another, or get caught in doorways, closing doors of trains, elevators, etc. and so on.\n\nWhile Nikon service has had many complaints, recently I have noticed a great improvement, and they always handle my issues and problems with courtesy and generally great promptness, for which I am indebted.\n\nHere is a story: I once set two lenses, a Nikon reflex lens and a Sigma zoom on my automobile in Yellowstone, got distracted, then got into my car and started to drive away. I heard something, stopped and got out -- both lenses had fallen off the car (and not been run over).\n\nThe Nikon reflex lens I put on my camera and aside from a slight rub and almost a scratch in it, it continued to work at 100% and still is in my camera bag. On the other hand, the Sigma zoom was destroyed by the impact; with not only some external damage but also with internal damage, such as the Iris having been severely damaged.\n\nA friend bought all-Sigma several years ago then went on a horseback trip into the mountains. He reported that all his Sigma lens basically were 'ruined' by the constant bounding, etc. and impact from being in saddle bags and literally because the cost of repair was too high, had to be thrown away. He now buys all Nikon lenses.\n\nMaybe the build quality of secondary lenses has improved, and if so, one might want to mount them, but if one buys something that one may not need for a lifetime, one also has to look at resale price.\n\nThere is a decided lack of interest in Sigma, Tamron, etc., lenses at the resale level, and the above stories may have something to do with it. If you ever plan to resell a secondary manufacturer lens, you should look carefully now at the resale market for such lenses. Nikon lenses of high quality (not the cheaper 'consumer' lenses or 'kit' lenses) tend to hold their value very well, and sometimes can be sold a year or so later for as much or more than their cost, something that amazes me.\n\nThere also is a ready market for Nikon lenses -- the name does mean something to resale buyers. There is a huge market for used Nikon lenses, and those of secondary manufacturers tend to take quite a beating, I think or simply be ignored by those who are knowledgeable users who have not researched a particular lens from a secondary manufacturer.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to put all Sigma lenses on my camera and know I could get just the same images and about the same image quality for the most part on my camera(s), but past reputation and experience about built quality and more difficult resale do not, for me, make up for the long-time good name Nikon has made for built quality.\n\nThe same goes for any better reviewed lens from any manufacturer, including Tamron, etc.\n\nYou no longer can pound nails with Nikon cameras and their lenses no longer are so impervious to shock hazards, etc., as they once were, but it takes quite a bit to harm a Nikon lens. Failures are infrequent in the many lenses I use. I've had less good luck with those of secondary manufacturers.\n\nThat being said, I took my best photo (balloon man) with the lens of a secondary manufacturer which then cost less than $50, and my most-viewed photograph ever (Anti-War Then, Fixed Bayonet), was taken with a Soligor 28 mm f 4 prime lens that I bought in Hong Kong new for $28, and the same lens also took a photo of Richard Nixon that has been well-received and both those photos are pin-sharp.\n\nIf you buy a lens solely for yourself, you can make a determination of build-quality and read reviews about optical quality, and I am certain for some lenses you can do better than Nikon with certain focal lengths and maximum apertures. But it's a trade-off with reputation, repair, warranty (Nikon in the US has a one-year warranty with a five-year 'service contract' that is a warranty in disguise, and if you're a California resident, you don't even have to register the warranty. Warranties are of great concern if you're buying auto-focus lenses with vibration reduction and even militate against ever buying 'so-called' grey market lenses.\n\nSome Nikon lenses are simply unequalled anywhere by anybody, such as my 200~400 f 4, which is an amazing lens (if very, very heavy).\n\nOthers have significantly less reliable build such as the 18~200 f 3.5~5.6, which all have a 'bind' in their zooming at a certain millimeter range as well as issues of pincushion and barrel distortion, which should arise when covering such a great range of focal lengths.\n\nIt's all a reason for making intelligent decisions rather than just becoming a blind adherent to one school of thought (I'll only buy all-Nikon) vs. another (I'll buy whatever lens makes the best photos, regardless.\n\nMy solution currently is to maintain an all-Nikon lineup because I use certain lenses very heavily and I need service from time to time, and I sometimes live outside the US (a Nikon US warranty is good throughout the world, but a Nikon warranty from outside the US is not good inside the US).\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to use lenses (or cameras) from other manufacturers and be sure I could get superb quality photos, if the issues of resale, service and lens build quality were not something I would always have to be researching.\n\nSince I don't want to occupy myself overmuch with reading lens reviews, so I tend to go with what works, and for me that is choosing the sharpest Nikon lenses serves me well.\n\nBut if Tamron or Sigma came to me and said 'here are free lenses, use them daily, and report back to us on how well they withstand hard, constant use on the street, and if you like them, endorse them,' I'd have no issues with mounting them on my camera(s) or endorsing them if they did work well.\n\nWith the new Nikon cameras (D300 and D3) which yield high quality images at very high ISO, I tend to shoot everything with high ISO when it's 'street', so the issue of an f 4 (Nikon) lens vs. the availability of a f 2.8 lens from a secondary manufacturer would be not much incentive to change from a supersharp lens (Nikon 12~24 mm f 4).\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nJohn (Crosley)"
