Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned professional, understanding the strengths and offerings of each brand can help you make an informed choice that suits your photographic style and needs.\n\nAs a recommendation, as long as you stick to the big manufacturers, you cant go too far wrong. I say this because you don’t want to invest thousands of pounds into a camera system and then the maker go out of business needing you to start again.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhich camera brand is best for beginners? Canon and Nikon offer great entry-level models that are user-friendly and provide a solid foundation for learning photography. As they are so widely used the second hand market makes access to high quality cameras and lenses even easier.\n\nAre mirrorless cameras better than DSLRs? Mirrorless cameras offer advantages in size, weight, and often speed, but DSLRs still have benefits in terms of battery life and lens selection. I personally made the switch to mirrorless in 2020 and haven’t looked back, I think they blow DSLR’s out of the water.\n\nIs it worth investing in a high-end camera brand like Leica or Hasselblad? High-end brands offer exceptional quality and unique features, but they require a significant investment. They’re worth it if you value those specific attributes and can afford them. Otherwise, you’ll probably find them too slow, clunky and heavy for everyday use."
