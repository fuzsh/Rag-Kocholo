        "text": "Building your work means you may also have to do free jobs but only if you enjoy it. I’m not talking about undercutting other photographers (which is a shitty thing to do, but we’ll talk about that later…), but helping out people who don’t have a budget themselves or have very little. I did a few of these shoots including shooting a Pitts Special, Keston Cobblers’ Club band, and Tim Hutton’s AutoTweetUp were all free or practically free (under £50/I was fed two slices of pizza). This is because they didn’t have money to pay me and I wanted to photograph them because it looked fun. The Kestons ended up hiring me a couple more times since and they’re super fun to hang out with, and the location of AutoTweetUp, Bicester Heritage, became one of my most continual clients because they liked the images from that meeting. I still do free jobs for poor people to help them out with their own dreams because we all need a leg up sometimes.\n\nFinally, it sounds straightforward but it’s got to be said – BE A NICE PERSON. A big client recently said to me “There are thousands of great photographers out there but at the end of the day, we’re going to hire the ones who we like to hang out with”. There are some photographers I know who don’t get hired by a bunch of clients because they’re a bit shitty, arrogant and drama queens. There are some, bless them, that just struggle to chat and be sociable. Once you’re a massively famous photographer like David Bailey, you can probably get away with it because people really do want your work but before we get to Bailey status, we need to be able to get on with the people hiring us. Be open, friendly, enthusiastic, hardworking, open to suggestions and for goodness sake, smile. You’re doing the thing you love!!\n\nTL;DR – Ask nicely, ask again, don’t be over professional. Take the cars away from the coffee and cake scene, use that instead to make connections.\n\nMost of my clients come to me. If I ever want to work for someone (like in the early days with Octane and Goodwood), I drop them an email to tell them how much I like their magazine/event/product etc and that I’d love to collaborate with them/work with them. I send them a link to my work, tell them my day rate and see if they get back to me. If they reply (which is not always the case), they might say that your rate is too high for them, in which case you ask them what figure they had in mind and see if you can come to an agreement. Don’t be put off if they don’t get back to you, this will happen. Email them again in 6 months time once you’ve got more work under your belt. They may reply with ‘Love your work! We’ve got a shoot coming up that we think you’d be great for.’ Bingo.\n\nTry to be professional in your writing but don’t over do it. ‘Dear Sir/Madam’ is a little OTT. Depending on the client, alter your tone. I’m a very sociable person so I usually include lots of ‘Hi there!’s and smiley faces, but that may not always be the best approach. Talk to them sincerely, like you would face to face, check your spelling and grammar (the most basic but looked over thing… You’re writing to people who publish text and images! They see a grammatical mistake like the devil just appeared on their screen!) and don’t give them your whole CV in an email. Qualifications have very little to do with it.\n\nIf you want to bump up your portfolio, go to car meets and chat to owners. I see so many photographers shooting cars at car meets but those images will not get you noticed. If you shoot a nice image of a car that’s parked up next to some other average cars, that will also not get you noticed. You know how when you go to a job interview, you’re meant to try and dress in a manner that the interviewer can see you in that position? Do the same for your jobs. Potential clients want to see images they would publish in their magazine and I’m sorry to say, car and coffee meets are not often one of them. Talk to the owners of some of the cars you think look awesome, or owners that have an awesome story about their car (Barry has driven his Hillman Imp the distance to the moon!!), ask them if they’d like to have them and their car photographed, give them a contact card, and then go and spend an afternoon hanging out with them. Take the car to a cool location and shoot like you were shooting it for a magazine. You make some great friends along the way too! My Series 1 Land Rover images for example – I saw the car at a meet and thought ‘that looks cool!’ and introduced myself to the owner, Jason. Jason said he was free that weekend for a shoot. I photographed Jason and the Landy. 3 years later, I’m his groomsmaid at his wedding this year, driving that car as their wedding car!\n\nTL;DR – Skill outweighs gear any day. You can learn composition but it’s something that has to then occur naturally.\n\nYou can have a crap photographer with the best camera on the market and they’ll create high-quality crap photos. Or you can have a fabulous photographer only shooting with their mobile phone and get more Instagram followers than you or I will ever have because their ‘eye’ for an image is amazing. Take @supersangron, for example, all shot on an iPhone!\n\nYou can learn composition, yes, but it will take a lot longer for you to naturally get the gist of a good image. I have always been artistic and think I’ve always had a talent for photography. The best way I can describe it is like looking at my subject through my lens and feeling like any one of these images, and once I ‘see’ the image, I know it’s right because suddenly it feels like all of those annoying, uneven things are ironed out. My compositions are more of an innate feeling than a decision. Yes, we all know about the golden ration and rule of thirds, but sometimes and image just feels right. The colours, the composition, the subject – it all just works.\n\nA lot of the time you get thrust with a location and a subject and you just have to make the best image you can from what’s in front of you. Like Goodwood for example, everything is go go go. No planning, just shooting. It takes me a good hour or two to really get into the swing of it and get my photography ‘eye’ warmed up and working. You can plan and plan and plan a shoot, but your favourite shot of the day ends up being something you shot one frame of because you liked the look of it. I will plan basic locations of places I like the look of on Google Street View, but after that, I usually just show up and go for it. ‘I like that location > that angle feels right > shoot angle and see what else happens’. Overthinking can lead you to doubt yourself and not to capture the true, honest moment."
