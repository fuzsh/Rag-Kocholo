If you’re still on the fence, check out our comparison of mirrorless vs DSLR cameras. But if DSLR is for you, read on.\n\nChoosing the right DSLR in 2024 is no easier than choosing any other kind of camera. It comes down to your skill level, your budget and your shooting style. That means we can’t categorically recommend one single camera that’s right for everyone – although we do have a personal favorite: the Nikon D3500.\n\nOfficially, it’s been discontinued, but the D3500 can still be found online. We suggest keeping an eye out for it Amazon’s Prime Day camera deals: with a simple interface, excellent sensor and reliable battery life, it ticks all the right boxes for beginners.\n\nEvery option below has been tested comprehensively in the real world, to assess factors such as handling, battery life, autofocus and image quality. Like our list of the best beginner DSLR cameras, the idea behind this guide is to help you find the right DSLR for your needs and budget.\n\nTop 3 picks\n\nIf you want a shortcut to the best DSLR cameras in 2024, the round-up below will give you an instant overview. If any options take your fancy, use the links beneath each entry to jump to our full summary.\n\nBest by use-case\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best DSLRs for 2024\n\nBelow you'll find full write-ups for each of the best DSLR cameras in our list. We've tested each one extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\n\nThe best beginner DSLR camera\n\nNikon D3500 sample images\n\nNikon has discontinued the D3500, but you can still find it available online and second-hand. That’s a good thing, because we think it's an ideal choice for beginners looking to sharpen their skills. Despite its age, the D3500 has a very capable APS-C sensor. To get the most out of it, we’d recommend buying the D3500 with the ‘VR’ version of its kit lens, as this incorporates Nikon’s image stabilization system at little extra cost. Nikon also has a vast catalog of DX system lenses, giving you plenty of choice when your skills advance enough to justify a glass upgrade.\n\nWe think the Nikon D3500 is proof that you don’t have to pay a fortune to get a great camera. In our tests, we found the images it produced were top-notch. We were also impressed by the camera's battery life and ease of handling. During our review, we praised the accessibility of controls for learners, as well as the guide mode, for the way it introduces novices to manual controls. While enthusiasts should look further down this list, in the right hands, the D3500 is a match for cameras that cost a lot more.\n\nRead our in-depth Nikon D3500 review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best crop-sensor DSLR\n\nCanon EOS 90D sample images\n\nThe EOS 90D was quite the step forward for the EOS DSLR line when it launched in 2019. It was the first of its kind to sport a 32.5MP APS-C sensor, giving it a decent number of pixels for both cropping and producing large prints. Unlike the earlier 80D, it offered uncropped 4K video recording, along with a new processing engine and faster burst shooting. The 1300-shot battery also provided far more juice than the average mirrorless camera, while protection against dust and water was a bonus.\n\nIt still stacks up well today. In our review, we were impressed by the versatility of the 90D. It's an excellent all-rounder for those who like to photograph a broad range of different subjects. It is worth weighing up whether the benefits of a mirrorless alternative to the EOS 90D, like the Canon EOS M6 Mark II, might appeal to you. The M6 Mark II is smaller, cheaper and offers faster burst shooting. But by focusing on key areas like battery life, handling and a fully articulating rear screen, Canon has made the EOS 90D a strong and versatile alternative for anyone who prefers the DSLR experience.\n\nRead our in-depth Canon EOS 90D review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best full-frame hybrid DSLR\n\nNikon D780 sample images\n\nThe D780 is effectively a hybrid of a full-frame DSLR and a mirrorless camera like the original Nikon Z6. While it's still relatively expensive, the D780's slight price drop since it landed in 2020 means it's now our top pick for anyone who wants to combine the benefits of mirrorless tech and DSLRs. Our review revealed that the D780's image quality is among the best around, while its 4K video skills are boosted by the inclusion of modern features like Face and Eye detection.\n\nBuilding on the solid foundation laid by the D750, the D780 uses the same 273-point on-sensor phase-detection AF system as the Z6, allowing it to focus rapidly when you're shooting via Live View. If you prefer to frame through its optical viewfinder, you'll be able to make the most of its impressive 2,260-shot battery life. As one of the latest DSLR it's still quite pricey, but if that isn't an issue for you, then the D780 is one of the best full-frame all-rounders you can buy.\n\nRead our in-depth Nikon D780 review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best value all-rounder for enthusiasts\n\nNikon D7500 sample images\n\nFancy the Nikon D500 but don't fancy the price tag? Well, if you're prepared to make a few compromises here and there, the D7500 is what you should be looking at. It's packed with the same 20.9MP APS-C sensor (or 'DX' as Nikon calls it) as its more senior stablemate, and also matches it in offering 4K video recording.\n\nNikon has also furnished it with the same 180k-pixel RGB metering sensor and the tilting screen on the back is just as large at 3.2 inches in size, although not quite as detailed, and it's all wrapped up inside a weather-sealed body. In our tests, we were impressed by a number of things, including battery life, image quality and handling. It's a great all-rounder for those with a healthy amount of budget.\n\nRead our in-depth Nikon D7500 review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best entry-level full-frame DSLR\n\nCanon EOS 6D Mark II sample images\n\nAlthough it's a full-frame DSLR, the entry-level EOS 6D Mark II is impressively user-friendly. While we found the chassis rather plasticky in our review, the 26MP sensor housed within is stellar, and offers Canon's trusty Dual Pixel CMOS AF system when using live view mode. The rear touchscreen also offers tap-to-focus and tap-to-shoot for anyone missing a joystick.\n\nWith 45 AF points to choose from and a burst speed of 6.5fps, there's plenty you can capture – including some decent wildlife shots as well. It's not quite fast enough for speedy trackside racing shots, but we discovered in our tests that it does surprisingly well for most anything else. The 6D Mark II is reliable, produces great results and is still a favorite amongst enthusiast photographers.\n\nRead our in-depth Canon EOS 6D Mark II review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best flagship DSLR\n\nCanon EOS 5D Mark IV sample image\n\nThe Canon EOS 5D Mark IV tweaks and improves on almost everything before it, with a 30.4MP sensor and advanced 61-point AF system, together with 4K video recording – all of which performed well in our real-world tests. With a 5D Mark V successor essentially ruled out by Canon, the Mark IV will continue to be one of the most compelling DSLRs at this price point.\n\nIts 4K video options are a little limited, with the frame-rate topping out at 30fps and no options to shoot in a flat gamma profile. But if you're mainly looking for a powerful DSLR for stills photography, the EOS 5D Mark IV remains a surprisingly modern proposition, considering its age – and the fact that you can still buy it new is a testament to its popularity.\n\nRead our in-depth Canon EOS 5D Mark IV review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best DSLR for image quality\n\nNikon D850 sample images\n\nIt's hard to think of another DSLR that wows like the D850 does, even after several years on the market. It's on the pricey side for sure, but this is justified by the things we discovered in our tests, including excellent image quality, bags of features and a rugged, weather-resistant magnesium alloy body. The 45MP sensor is still one of the highest in terms of resolution in any DSLR, while the 7fps burst mode is unusually high for a camera with such a sensor.\n\nAdd to that a cracking AF system, wonderful handling and great 4K video, and its versatility should be easy to appreciate. Like the sound of the D850, but want to go mirrorless? Well, while not strictly a mirrorless version of the D850, Nikon's newer Z7 mirrorless camera shares the same 45MP resolution as the D850, but features some clever tech of its own, including an all-new lens mount.\n\nRead our in-depth Nikon D850 review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nThe best DSLR for sports and wildlife\n\nCanon 1D X Mark III sample images\n\nCanon’s final flagship DSLR is a fitting swan song. Designed for professionals who need speed, performance and image quality in a sturdy package, the 1D X Mark III pretty much covers it all. In our tests, we were extremely impressed with the 1D X Mark III’s capabilities. Its rugged build feels solid enough to survive a war zone and, while it’s a big camera, we appreciated its ergonomics during our review. We also found it a camera that could handle any situation.\n\nSports, wildlife or front-page action: its performance was never in doubt. With a fast processor, deep buffer and rapid 20fps burst speeds, this is a camera that doesn’t compromise. That’s equally true of the AF system, which uses deep-learning to enhance precision. Its video prowess is handy, too, with 4K/60p capture available. Stacked to the hilt with features and power, it’s probably overkill for the average photographer, especially considering its expensive price tag. Yet it’s also a truly impressive DSLR that represents a worth investment for professionals.\n\nTo save some money on Canon products, check out our Canon discount codes.\n\nRead our in-depth Canon EOS 1D X Mark III review\n\nThe best black and white DSLR camera\n\nPentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome sample images\n\nIf you’re committed to shooting in black and white, we think the Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome is a great choice. In our review, we were impressed with how it handles, especially for a camera that’s large and heavy compared to the latest mirrorless options. We found it well-built, comfortable in the hand and blessed with an array of direct access controls. Together with an LCD on the top plate, these make the Monochrome a pleasure to shoot with.\n\nOur tests also found image quality to be excellent, aided by impressive ISO control: stills are sharp and usable, even at ISO 51,200. 5-axis in-body image stabilization also assists in keeping results crisp. There’s no escaping that it’s expensive for an APS-C camera without the versatility of color photography, but it is cheaper than both the Leica M and Q-series Monochrom models. It might be eccentric, but it's also a well-equipped option if black and white is your style – particularly if you’re already invested in Pentax lenses.\n\nRead our in-depth Pentax K-3 Mark III Monochrome review\n\n^ Back to the top\n\nHow to choose\n\nHow do I choose the best DSLR camera?\n\nA DSLR remains the cheapest way to get a camera with interchangeable lenses and a viewfinder (you’ll find many entry-level mirrorless cameras don’t have viewfinders). But what else should you consider when choosing one?\n\nThe main differences between an entry-level DSLR and a more advanced one are in the camera’s design, sensor and shooting features. Beginner DSLRs like the Nikon D3500 (see no.1 above) are often smaller than their more premium equivalents. This has historically made them some of the best travel cameras around, though it usually also means a lack of weather-proofing and fewer manual controls.\n\nThe size difference is often also related to sensor size. More affordable DSLRs tend to have APS-C size sensors, while pro-friendly ones like the Nikon D850 are full-frame cameras. You can see a diagram showing the difference below.\n\nThere is no outright ‘better’ sensor size, with each having their own advantages and drawbacks. To find out more about these, check out our guide on how to buy a full-frame camera.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between a beginner DSLR and a mid-range model, paying a bit more for the latter will usually get you increased shooting flexibility, which could see you keep the camera for longer and save you money in the long run. The extra features you tend to get are improved continuous shooting speeds (handy for shooting sport or wildlife), superior high ISO performance (useful in lower light), and sometimes an extra memory card slot.\n\nYou can also find outstanding value by shopping for a second-hand DSLR from a reputable retailer. Because many manufacturers are no longer making new DSLR models, there is a healthy market for good quality used models. The Canon EOS 800D, for example, is a solid entry-level DSLR that can be found at a good discount. Similarly, the Nikon D750 is an older full-frame option that represents excellent second-hand value.\n\nIf you’re just looking to step up from your smartphone or point-and-shoot camera, though, then an entry-level DSLR will give you the image quality boost and manual controls you need to grow into your new hobby. Finally, a quick word of advice if you don’t have any lenses – buy your new DSLR with a kit lens, as it’s cheaper to do this than buy them separately.\n\nWhat is a DSLR camera exactly?\n\nLike most modern cameras, a DSLR allows you to record still images to a memory card. What makes a DSLR camera different is the way that it directs light to the sensor inside. DSLR stands for digital single-lens reflex camera. Breaking that down, the ‘digital’ refers to the sensor. This can be anything from a standard APS-C sensor, all the way through full-frame to the much larger medium format.\n\n‘Single-lens’ is fairly self-explanatory: it means that DSLR cameras use one and the same lens to frame, focus and shoot photographs. Almost all cameras do this nowadays, but the terminology is a hangover from the days when retro rangefinder and twin-lens-reflex models used multiple lenses to achieve the different functions.\n\n‘Reflex’ refers to perhaps the most important component of a DSLR camera. It means that a mirror inside the body directs the light which comes down the lens. When you’re framing a shot, this light is sent to the optical viewfinder, giving you a true analogue impression of the scene. But when you press the shutter button to start an exposure, this mirror will flip up. In an analogue SLR camera, this would expose the film inside. In a DSLR, it allows the digital sensor to capture the available light.\n\nBesides the optical viewfinder, another benefit of this reflective system is that DSLR cameras have to be larger than their mirrorless equivalents. This might sound like a downside, but it means DSLR cameras can benefit from famously good ergonomics. DSLR cameras also support interchangeable lenses, so you can switch to more suitable glass when you need to shoot a different scene – from a prime lens to a zoom lens, for example. And because the format has been around for so long, you should have no trouble finding compatible lenses and accessories.\n\nFor a more detailed explainer on how DSLRs compare to their mirrorless counterparts, check out our in-depth Mirrorless vs DSLR comparison feature.\n\nWho stopped making DSLR cameras?\n\nAs you’ll see from the list above, there are still plenty of excellent DSLR cameras still available for photographers. That said, it’s an unavoidable truth that most manufacturers are now focused squarely on putting their latest tech into mirrorless models.\n\nThe result of this industry shift is that many of the biggest camera manufacturers have stopped developing new DSLR cameras. That includes two former stalwarts of the genre: Canon announced in 2021 that the EOS 1D X Mark III would be its last DSLR flagship, while Nikon followed suit in 2022. Some feel it could be a good thing for photography as a whole.\n\nThat’s doesn’t mean you can’t buy DSLR cameras from those companies: both are still producing existing models. In fact, Canon has promised to continue making DSLRs for as long as there is demand for them. But that doesn’t mean their future is secure, either. Nikon has officially discontinued several models, including both the D5600 and D3500 (our favorite DSLR camera) and neither brand will bring any new models to market. And they’re not alone, with Sony also withdrawing the last of its DSLRs from shelves.\n\nWhile this development doesn’t augur well for fans of the format, chances are that the total demise of DSLRs is still several years away. What’s more, you can still find fantastic value on the healthy second-hand market.\n\nHow we test DSLRs\n\nBuying a camera these days is a big investment, so every camera in this guide has been tested extensively by us. These days, real-world tests are the most revealing way to understand a camera's performance and character, so we focus heavily on those, along with standardized tests for factors like ISO performance.\n\nTo start with, we look at the camera's design, handling and controls to get a sense of what kind of photographer it's aimed at and who would most enjoy shooting with it. When we take it out on a shoot, we'll use it both handheld and on a tripod to get a sense of where its strengths lie, and test its startup speed.\n\nWhen it comes to performance, we use a formatted SD card and shoot in both raw and JPEG (if available). For burst shooting tests, we dial in our regular test settings (1/250 sec, ISO 200, continuous AF) and shoot a series of frames in front of a stopwatch to see if it lives up to its claimed speeds. We'll also look at how quickly the buffers clears and repeat the test for both raw and JPEG files.\n\nWhere applicable, we also test the camera's different autofocus modes in different lighting conditions (including Face and Eye AF) in single point, area and continuous modes. We also shoot a range of photos of different styles (portrait, landscape, low light, macro/close-up) in raw and JPEG to get a sense of metering and its sensor's ability to handle noise and resolve fine detail.\n\nIf the camera's raw files are supported by Adobe Camera Raw, we'll also process some test images to see how we can push areas like shadow recovery. And we'll also test its ISO performance across the whole range to get a sense of the levels we'd be happy to push the camera to.\n\nBattery life is tested in a real-world fashion, as we use the camera over the course of the day with the screen set to the default settings. Once the battery has reached zero, we'll then count the number of shots to see how it compares to the camera's CIPA rating. Finally, we test the camera's video skills (where necessary) by shooting some test footage at different frame rates and resolutions, along with its companion app.\n\nWe then take everything we've learned about the camera and factor in its price to get a sense of the value-for-money it offers, before reaching our final verdict."
