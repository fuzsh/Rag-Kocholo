        "text": "If you think you just fell victim to a clickbait headline, trust me, you haven’t. Indeed, in an official press release, Nikon Corporation announced that they are entering into an agreement to acquire 100% of RED.com, LLC. Surprised? Me too.\n\nPlease note: this is an evolving story. Make sure to update this article frequently for more details.\n\nLately, RED Digital Cinema has been at the center of a series of plot twists within our industry. Just a few weeks ago, RED announced a partnership with ARRI to develop a custom V-RAPTOR XL camera to use with ARRI DNA glass on the upcoming Tron: Ares movie. Soon after that, they launched the V-RAPTOR [X] – the first cinema camera to feature an 8K Vista Vision sensor with global shutter technology. And now, straight out of the blue, we find out that yellow is taking over red.\n\nThis may be even more surprising considering that two years ago the two companies were fighting in court over in-camera compressed RAW patents. Now, without any further ado, let’s take a look at Nikon’s press release.\n\nRED becomes yellow – Nikon to acquire the American company\n\nTOKYO – Nikon Corporation (Nikon) hereby announces its entry into an agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding membership interests of RED.com, LLC (RED) whereby RED will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nikon, pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Mr. James Jannard, its founder, and Mr. Jarred Land, its current President, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions thereunder.\n\nSince its establishment in 2005, RED has been at the forefront of digital cinema cameras, introducing industry-defining products such as the original RED ONE 4K to the cutting-edge V-RAPTOR [X] with its proprietary RAW compression technology. RED’s contributions to the film industry have not only earned it an Academy Award but have also made it the camera of choice for numerous Hollywood productions, celebrated by directors and cinematographers worldwide for its commitment to innovation and image quality optimized for the highest levels of filmmaking and video production.\n\nThis agreement was reached as a result of the mutual desires of Nikon and RED to meet the customers’ needs and offer exceptional user experiences that exceed expectations, merging the strengths of both companies. Nikon’s expertise in product development, exceptional reliability, and know-how in image processing, as well as optical technology and user interface along with RED’s knowledge in cinema cameras, including unique image compression technology and color science, will enable the development of distinctive products in the professional digital cinema camera market.\n\nNikon will leverage this acquisition to expand the fast-growing professional digital cinema camera market, building on both companies’ business foundations and networks, promising an exciting future of product development that will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in film and video production."
