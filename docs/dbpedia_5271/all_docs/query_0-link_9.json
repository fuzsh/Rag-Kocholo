        "text": "OKLAHOMA HISTORY\n\n\"Once upon a time would be a good way to start writing about the Marland palace in Ponca City and the family for which the mansion is named. The story sounds much like a fairy tale from an era long ago.\n\nThe story is told in a new book, \"Palace on the Prairie: The Marland Family Story (Oklahoma Horizons Series, $29.95).\n\nAuthors C.D. Northcutt, William C. Ziegenhain and Bob Burke weave a story of a mansion and a family that makes fascinating reading. The story is happy and sad.\n\nFirst, the family: Wealthy oil company owner Ernest Whitworth Marland adopted the beautiful Lydie Roberts, making her his only daughter. After E.W. Marland's wife died, he revoked Lydie's adoption and married her in 1928 amid a torrent of press attention.\n\nNow, the palace: E.W. Marland built a $5.5 million palace in Ponca City, which historians have called the finest home ever built in Oklahoma. However, E.W. and Lydie lived there only two months before financial woes struck, causing them to begin living in a smaller building on the grounds.\n\nMinus his fortune, E.W. turned to politics. First he served as a congressman and then was elected governor of Oklahoma in 1934. Lydie was a charming hostess and was schooled in all the social graces.\n\nE.W. died in 1941, while still dreaming of making another fortune. Lydie lived alone until 1953, when she packed her car, broke all ties with Oklahoma and roamed the nation. She did various jobs, including a stint as a motel maid in Independence, Mo., and lived on the streets for a time. In 1975, she was persuaded to return to Ponca City. With her beauty faded and her health failing, she lived as a recluse in her cottage on the palace grounds until she died in 1987.\n\nThis coffee-table book captures the building of the ornate palace now owned by Ponca City and open to the public. It offers a full review of E.W. Marland's climb to riches and his generous philanthropy and includes a comprehensive genealogy. The book is a worthwhile and welcome exploration of a family that made a deep mark on Oklahoma.\n\nArchive ID: 3053502"
