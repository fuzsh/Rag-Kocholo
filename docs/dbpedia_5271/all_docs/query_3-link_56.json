Wes Moore, a vet, on Vance military attack on Walz\n\nIn 2021, 43-year-old Wes Moore already had a long and eclectic resume: he was a troubled-student-turned-Rhodes Scholar, a decorated Afghanistan combat veteran, an investment banker, and a best-selling author. But, in June 2021, in what would be his first political campaign, Moore announced his candidacy for governor of Maryland. The following November, Moore’s long-shot bid made him the first Black governor of Maryland and the third Black person to be elected governor of any U.S. state.\n\nDifficult childhood\n\nMoore was born in Takoma Park, Maryland, to college-educated parents William Westley Moore, Jr., and Joy Thomas Moore. His father was a journalist and broadcaster, and his mother, who had immigrated to the United States from Jamaica with her parents, also worked in media. Shortly before Moore’s fourth birthday, his father died of epiglottitis, an acute but treatable viral infection that caused his windpipe to shut down. Grief-stricken and facing the prospect of raising young Wes and his two sisters alone, Joy Moore moved the family to the Bronx, New York, to be near her parents.\n\nAs a boy, Moore was described as charming, social, and well-liked but not hugely motivated as a student. In 1991 he was picked up by police for spraying graffiti on a wall outside a bar. The run-in with the law, coupled with his poor grades, led his mother to make a hard decision. Joy Moore sent her son to the Valley Forge Military Academy and College, in Pennsylvania.\n\nMeet Wes Moore\n\nBirthdate: October 15, 1978\n\nBirthplace: Takoma Park, Maryland\n\nEducation: Johns Hopkins University, B.A., 2001; Oxford University, Master’s degree in international relations, 2004.\n\nCurrent position: 63rd governor of Maryland\n\nFamily: Married to Dawn Flythe Moore; they have two children, Mia and James\n\nQuotation: “I knew at an early age that I would devote my life to fighting for people like my mom. I know the roots I come from. I know the DNA that runs through me.”\n\nYoung Wes Moore was miserable in the strict military environment far from New York. He tried to run away and begged his mother to allow him to come home. In what Joy Moore would call “one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made,” she told him he had to stay at the school she had borrowed the money to pay for.\n\nDuring the years he was at Valley Forge (1991–98), Moore found his footing. In a 2023 interview with Encyclopædia Britannica, Moore recounted:\n\nI was developing an identity in my hometown and school as a troublemaker….The military environment allowed me to remake myself. [Being there] taught me leadership: what changed me wasn’t getting screamed at; what changed me was when I was put in charge of something.\n\nAt Valley Forge Moore was active in sports, playing basketball and football as well as running track and wrestling. He demonstrated early leadership skills, serving as class president three times and regularly making the dean’s list. Valley Forge was also where he had his first experiences as a public speaker. A teacher encouraged him to enter a speech contest about the U.S. Constitution. In part of the speech, he said: “I am proud to be an American because I understand just what my ancestors had to go through in order for me to be called American.” He won the contest.\n\nThe beginning of public service\n\nMoore graduated from Valley Forge in 1998 with an associate’s degree, was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant, and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree (2001) at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2000 he was awarded a Rhodes scholarship, and he began studying at Oxford University in 2001, earning a master’s degree in international relations (2004). During his time at Johns Hopkins, Moore was a star wide receiver on the football team and interned for Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, his introduction to politics. He served in Afghanistan in 2005–06 as part of the 82nd Airborne Division, achieving the rank of captain.\n\nCareer in business\n\nUpon his return from Afghanistan, he worked as an investment banker at Deutsche Bank before being selected in 2006 to be a White House fellow, where he worked in the office of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. A 2006 Baltimore Sun article about his fellowship included this quote and prophetic ambition: “‘My goal is to change things,’ said Moore, who has dreamed of being governor of Maryland.” After his time at the White House, Moore went back to investment banking, this time to Citibank, where he worked from 2007 to 2012.\n\nIn 2014 he founded BridgeEdU, a company designed to help students transition to college. But the company never fully realized its goals and was sold in 2019. Despite the business stumble, Moore was named chief executive officer of the Robin Hood Foundation in 2017. The New York City-based organization helps to fight poverty in the city by funding food banks and shelters. Robin Hood also offered aid to underserved communities in the city during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moore left Robin Hood in 2021 as he prepared to set his sights on politics.\n\nAuthor and rising star\n\nEven as he was navigating the world of investing, Moore was moving into the limelight for other endeavours. In 2011 he was featured with other Afghanistan and Iraq war veterans on the cover of Time magazine under the headline, “The New Greatest Generation.” A year earlier his first book, The Other Wes Moore: One Name, Two Fates, was published. In it he chronicles his life and that of another young Black man who shared his name and was about his same age but lived a very different life. “While I was on my way to study at Oxford, my namesake was on his way to do life in prison,” Moore said at the time. The book became a bestseller in part because of the enthusiastic support the memoir and its author received from Oprah Winfrey, who would remain an ardent supporter of Moore as his reputation grew. He would go on to write numerous other books, including Five Days (2020; written with Erica L. Green), which recounts what happened in Baltimore in the days after the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody.\n\nPolitical aspirations\n\nMoore, despite being a political neophyte, announced in June 2021 that he was running for the governorship of Maryland as a Democrat. Popular incumbent Republican Gov. Larry Hogan was prohibited from seeking reelection because of term limits on the office. With no incumbent to face, the field of candidates in the Democratic primary was crowded and impressive: it included two former cabinet secretaries from the Barack Obama administration, Tom Perez (Department of Labor) and John B. King, Jr. (Department of Education), as well as several well-known local and state politicians.\n\nMoore ran on a platform of fighting inequality, childhood poverty, and climate change. He also campaigned on creating equal access to health care (often citing his father’s death). The story of what his widowed immigrant mother endured also drove him. “I knew at an early age that I would devote my life to fighting for people like my mom. I know the roots I come from. I know the DNA that runs through me,” he told Britannica. “It taught me a mentality of service, of not just surviving but thriving.” By the time primary voters went to the polls in July 2022, there were 10 Democrats on the ballot. Moore edged out Perez and the rest of the field, getting 32.4 percent of votes cast.\n\nHis Republican challenger was Dan Cox, a state legislator who garnered the endorsement of former president Donald J. Trump. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Cox called then Vice Pres. Mike Pence “a traitor.” While Moore was heavily favoured to be elected Maryland’s first Black governor and the third Black man to be elected governor of any state (after Virginia’s Douglas Wilder and Massachusetts’s Deval Patrick), he faced questions about elements of his life story, including the statement on the jacket of one of his books that he was a native of Baltimore. In the end they mattered little, and Moore won in a landslide, with 64 percent of the vote.\n\nMoore laughs when asked about the ambition it requires to run for governor as a first political campaign: “I wasn’t interested in going into politics; I wanted to be governor. Part of the reason I wanted to run for governor is because of what the governor does. I’ve been a public servant much of my life. I haven’t been a politician.”\n\nPersonal life\n\nMoore married Dawn Flythe in 2007. She had previously worked as a senior policy adviser for Maryland Lieut. Gov. Anthony Brown. The couple have two children, a daughter, Mia, and a son, James. James recited the Pledge of Allegiance at his father’s inauguration.\n\nA historic inauguration\n\nMoore was sworn in as the 63rd governor of Maryland on January 18, 2023. The day was filled with symbolism: he laid a wreath at the Annapolis dock that was once a slave port; he took the oath on a Bible once owned by abolitionist Frederick Douglass; he was introduced by Winfrey; and, perhaps in a nod to future presidential ambitions, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton was a guest.\n\nWhen Moore stood to deliver his address, he spoke to the citizens he had been elected to lead:\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you for the honor you have bestowed upon me….We’re blocks away from the Annapolis docks, where so many enslaved people arrived in this country against their will. And we are standing in front of a capitol [building] that was built by their hands. We have made uneven and unimaginable progress since then."
