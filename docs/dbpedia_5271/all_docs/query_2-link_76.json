Well, I’ll want the reporters and editors at InDepthNH.org---the only news medium that staffed the critical Northern Pass hearings, from beginning to end. InDepthNH.org---good, solid, statewide news coverage, the kind you can depend on, the way things used to be and the way they should.”\n\nJohn Harrigan, writer\n\nColebrook\n\n\"We desperately need investigative news organizations like InDepthNH to counter the fake Facebook postings and toxic partisan diatribe masquerading as the truth. I’m immensely grateful to InDepthNH for the invaluable work they do.\"\n\nGloria Norris\n\nFilmmaker, author of KooKooland\n\n“New Hampshire owes a debt of gratitude to IndepthNH.org for its investigative journalism covering government accountability issues. It has been a pleasure teaming up with them to enhance government transparency and accountability in the Granite State.”\n\nGilles Bissonnette\n\nACLU-NH Legal Director"
