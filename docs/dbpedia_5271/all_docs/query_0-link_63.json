        "text": "The withholding of Maryland income tax is a part of the state's \"pay-as-you-go\" plan of income tax collection adopted by the 1955 session of the Maryland General Assembly. The provisions are set forth in the Tax-General Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. The law aids in the proper collection of taxes required to be reported by individuals with taxable income. Generally speaking, the state's system resembles the federal withholding plans.\n\nWithholding tax is not an additional tax, but merely a collection device. Its purpose is to collect tax at the source, as the wages are earned, instead of collecting the tax a year after the wages were earned. Please see the Maryland Withholding Guide and the links at the bottom of the page for more information.\n\nAs an employer, you must record sums that are withheld from employee wages in a ledger account to clearly indicate the amount of state tax withheld. These funds must be submitted to the state on the due date assigned to you.\n\nYou may use our withholding tables to determine the correct amount of state and local income tax that must be withheld from employee wages. To determine a precise amount to be withheld, use our percentage method tables.\n\nThe total income tax required to be withheld on wages for the purposes of the withholding tables and schedules is calculated without regard to the marginal state income tax rates of less than 4.75%.\n\nThe wages earned by a spouse of a nonresident U.S. servicemember may be exempt from Maryland income tax under the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act, when the spouse of the servicemember is not a legal resident of Maryland. The income tax withholding exemption may be claimed by filing a revised Form MW507 with their employer. For more information, see Employer Withholding Tax Alert- Important Information for Spouses of U.S. Military Servicemembers\n\nIf the payor of an eligible rollover distribution made to a Maryland resident is required to have federal income tax withheld from that distribution, then Maryland income tax must be withheld from the distribution at a rate of 7.75 percent.\n\nThe withholding specifically applies to an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of §3405(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, subject to mandatory withholding of federal income tax and received by a domiciliary or statutory resident of Maryland.\n\nThe 7.75 percent tax must be paid to the Comptroller of Maryland with Form MW506 (Employer's Return of Income Tax Withheld). If the payor of the distribution is not currently registered with the Comptroller and has not established a withholding account, the payor can register online. Payment may also be made online for free through the Maryland Tax Connect Portal.\n\nFor more information, see Administrative Release 41 - Withholding on Designated Distributions from Retirement Plans\n\nHouse Bill 632 (Chapter 352, Acts of 2011), the Earned Income Credit Information Act, requires the Comptroller to publish the maximum eligibility for the State earned income tax credit (EITC) on or before January 1 of each calendar year. This Act also requires the Comptroller to notify all employers in Maryland by mail of the information on the State EITC. The employer then must notify each employee who may be eligible for the federal or State earned income tax credits electronically or in written form by December 31. The Act took effect on January 1, 2012. You may view and download the Tax Alert for this new requirement. You may also read the IRS notice.\n\nCertain employees may be entitled to claim an earned income tax credit on their 2021 federal and Maryland income tax returns if both their federal adjusted gross income and their earned income is less than the following:\n\n&dollar;51,464 (&dollar;57,414 married filing jointly) with three or more qualifying children\n\n&dollar;47,915 (&dollar;53,865 married filing jointly) with two qualifying children\n\n&dollar;42,158 (&dollar;48,108 married filing jointly) with one qualifying child\n\n&dollar;21,430 (&dollar;27,380 married filing jointly) with no qualifying children\n\nThe notice to employees must include the following statements: (1) the employee may be eligible for the federal and State earned income tax credits; and (2) the employee may be eligible for the State earned income tax credit. We have created a sample employee notice for you to use, however, you may create your own as long as it includes the two statements above.\n\nTaxable wages include all employee compensation, such as salaries, fees, bonuses, commissions, vacation allowances, back pay, and retroactive wage increases.\n\nWages paid in any form other than money are measured by their fair market value. These include lodging, meals, property, or other considerations for personal services.\n\nWithholding is not required for:\n\nDomestic service in a private home.\n\nServices performed by a duly ordained, commissioned or licensed minister of a church or religious order in the exercise of duties.\n\nNonresidents (if their income consists entirely of wages or other compensation for personal services performed in Maryland, and their state of residence has a reciprocal agreement with Maryland. All other nonresidents are subject to withholding.)\n\nMilitary spouses\n\nThe wages earned by a spouse of a nonresident U.S. service member may be exempt from Maryland income tax under the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act, when the spouse of the service member is not a legal resident of Maryland. The income tax withholding exemption may be claimed by filing a revised Form MW507 and Form MW507M with their employer. For more information, see Employer Withholding Tax Alert - Important Information for Spouses of U.S. Military Servicemembers issued November 23, 2009.\n\nLottery and other gambling winnings in excess of &dollar;5,000 are subject to withholding at a rate of 8.75% for Maryland residents or 8% for nonresidents. Pari-mutuel (horse racing) winnings in excess of &dollar;5,000 and at least 300 times as large as the original wager are subject to the same withholding rates.\n\nIf you have an employee who expects to have less than &dollar;12,950 in income during 2022, you are not required to withhold Maryland state and local income tax. Students and other part-time workers affected by this situation may claim an exemption from withholding, using Maryland Form MW507, Employee's Maryland Withholding Exemption Certificate. You should keep the completed MW507 certificate with your records.\n\nMany high school and college counselors have partially completed MW507 forms that eligible employees can use to claim the withholding exemption with their employer.\n\nYou are responsible for sending a copy of an MW507 certificate to the Compliance Division under the following circumstances:\n\nYou have any reason to believe the certificate is incorrect.\n\nThe employee claims more than 10 exemptions.\n\nThe employee claims \"exempt\" as a result of having no tax liability for the preceding tax year, expects to incur no liability this year, and the wages are expected to exceed &dollar;200 a week (a new exemption certificate must be re-filed each year by the 15th day of February for employees whose income tax liability is determined on a calendar basis or by the 15th day of the second month following the last day of the employee's tax year).\n\nThe employee claims exemptions from withholding on the basis of residence in a reciprocal state.\n\nMail completed forms to:\n\nComptroller of Maryland\n\nCompliance Division, Compliance Programs Section\n\n301 W. Preston Street\n\nBaltimore, Maryland 21201\n\nNonresidents who work in Maryland or derive income from a Maryland source are subject to the appropriate Maryland income tax rate for their income level, as well as a special nonresident tax rate. The special nonresident tax rate has increased from 1.25% to 1.75% in 2016.\n\nBy law, the nonresident tax rate must equal the lowest local income tax rate paid by Maryland residents (currently 1.75%) combined with the top state tax rate.\n\nEmployers must withhold Maryland income tax for nonresidents using the 1.75% rate. See Withholding Tables for regular and percentage method withholding amounts.\n\nWashington, D.C., Pennsylvania and Virginia residents\n\nResidents of the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania and Virginia who did not maintain a place of abode in Maryland for more than six months (183 days or more), are exempt from withholding of Maryland tax on Maryland wages and salary by the authority of a reciprocity agreement between Maryland and these jurisdictions.\n\nWest Virginia residents\n\nWage and salary income for residents of West Virginia is not taxable to Maryland, regardless of the amount of time spent in Maryland, and they are exempt from withholding of Maryland tax on Maryland wages and salary by the authority of a reciprocity agreement between Maryland and West Virginia.\n\nLocal tax for certain nonresidents\n\nThe local income tax is imposed on nonresidents employed in Maryland, who reside in local jurisdictions that impose a local income or earnings tax on Maryland residents.\n\nDuring 2012, the following states had local jurisdictions which impose local earnings taxes on Maryland residents: Alabama, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New York, and Ohio.\n\nBoth state and local income tax withholding is required on wages of residents of local jurisdictions in the states above which impose an income or earnings tax of Maryland residents, if they work in Maryland. Since Maryland shares a state tax reciprocity agreement with Pennsylvania, only the local tax should be withheld for Pennsylvania residents working in Maryland and living in a jurisdiction that taxes Maryland residents. The local tax is computed at the rate of the local Maryland jurisdiction where the taxpayer is employed.\n\nNonresident tax on sale of Maryland property\n\nA nonresident tax on the sale of Maryland property is withheld at the rate of 8% (2.25% plus the top state tax rate of 5.75%) for individuals and 8.25% on nonresident entities. For more information, see Withholding Requirements for Sales of Real Property by Nonresidents.\n\nNonresident pass-through entity tax rate\n\nThe tax rate for pass-through entities is 7.5% on nonresident individual members (including nonresident fiduciary members) and 8.25% on nonresident entity members. For more information, see Pass-Through Entities.\n\nYou are not required by law to withhold Maryland income taxes from the wages paid to a domestic employee in a private residence. However, you may do so as a courtesy to the employee.\n\nIf you wish, you can register your withholding account online and use the Maryland Tax Connect Portal to file your withholding returns electronically for free.\n\nYou can also refer to our Employer Withholding Guide or Withholding Tables to determine the correct amount of state and local income tax that must be withheld from employee wages. The total income tax required to be withheld on wages for the purposes of the withholding tables is calculated without regard to the marginal state income tax rates of less than 4.75 percent. The local income tax, which is calculated as a percentage of taxable income, is included in the amount shown in the withholding tables.\n\nIf taxes are not withheld, then the employee will need to make estimated tax payments.\n\nIf you are a nonresident who owns and is selling or transferring real property and associated tangible personal property in Maryland, you must make a tax withholding payment to the local Clerk of the Circuit Court or the State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT). The payment must be made before the deed or other instrument of transfer is recorded with the court clerk or filed with SDAT.\n\nGenerally, the person responsible for your closing, a title company for example, is responsible for ensuring that sufficient funds are withheld at settlement and for paying the amount of withholding tax due to the Clerk or SDAT when the deed or other instrument of transfer is presented for recordation.\n\nIn the case of a nonresident individual, the payment is 8% of the total property sale payment made to the individual. A nonresident entity must make an 8.25% payment. See Withholding Requirements for Sales of Real Property by Nonresidents.\n\nUnder this provision, a nonresident entity is an entity that is:\n\nnot formed under the laws of Maryland more than 90 days before the date of the sale of the property, and\n\nnot qualified by or registered with SDAT to do business in Maryland more than 90 days before the date of the sale of the property.\n\nIn the case of multiple owners, withholding is required from each of the nonresident owners based on the percentage of the total payment that represents each nonresident's ownership percentage.\n\nAt settlement, you must complete Form MW506NRS - Return of Income Tax Withholding for Nonresident Sale of Real Property. The settlement agent must then present Copies A and B of Form MW506NRS to the clerk or SDAT, along with payment.\n\nIn addition to filing Form MW506NRS with a tax withholding payment, you are still required to file an end-of-the-year income tax return with Maryland for the year in which the sale occurred.\n\nFind Account Numbers\n\nYour Federal Employer Identification Number is the nine-digit number located in the upper left part of your withholding return, under the label \"FEIN.\"\n\nYour Maryland Central Registration number is the eight-digit number located to the right of your FEIN, under the label \"REGISTRATION NBR.\"\n\nClosing a Withholding Account\n\nYou can close your withholding account by calling 410-260-7980 from Central Maryland, or 1-800-638-2937 from elsewhere, Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.\n\nPlease be ready to provide the following information:\n\nName\n\nTelephone Number\n\nAccount number\n\nReason for closing the account (out of business, no employees, etc.)\n\nClosing date\n\nYou can also close your account by completing and remitting the Final Report Form available in your withholding coupon booklet, or by completing Form MW506FR.\n\nExisting accounts\n\nYou have two options to file your employer withholding reports: you can file electronically, or you can file using pre-printed coupons in a coupon book that we send to you, which contains your Employer's Return of Income Tax Withheld (Form MW506).

If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, the statements must be filed by the next business day.\n\nThe 2023 Maryland record layout is the only acceptable format for both current and back year tax electronic filing submissions. PDF's, Diskettes, Excel spreadsheets, or CD's are not acceptable.\n\nElectronic submissions should be reviewed for accuracy using the Bulk Upload Testing Application. Rejected submissions will render error codes which will be listed in the 2023 Maryland Employer Reporting of W-2s Instructions and Specifications Booklet.\n\n2023 Maryland Employer Reporting of W-2s Instructions and Specifications Booklet - RS and RV record reminders\n\nThe RS (W-2) record must include the Employer Identification Number in positions 328-336 and the Maryland Central Registration Number in positions 338-345. Failure to include your Employer Identification Number and Maryland Central Registration Number will result in your data being rejected.\n\nIf you are expecting an overpayment, it must be reported in the 'RV' record. Please indicate as to whether you are a requesting a refund or want to apply it as a credit. Refunds will be approved based on the request in the 'RV' record.\n\nFailure to include a date and time stamp in positions 497-512 of the 'RE', 'RS' and 'RV' records will result in the entire file being rejected.\n\nThe RV record is an electronic version of the paper form, MW508, Annual Employer Reconciliation Return. The RV record contains all the information from the MW508 and is a required record in the electronic file. Do not send the paper MW508 with your electronic filing submission as the RV record is considered the electronic version. Only send in a paper Form MW508 when the report is for all zeros.\n\nOutsourced Payrolls\n\nIf you outsource your payroll, please provide the transmitter/submitter with the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) and the Maryland Central Registration (CR) Number. You can find the account numbers in your pre-printed employer withholding tax returns coupon book and on the Form MW508.\n\nAvoid duplicate filing\n\nDo not report duplicate information. If you file returns electronically, do not file identical paper documents. This may result in erroneous balance due notices and/or penalty notices.\n\n1099s and W2-G\n\nFor tax year 2020 and going forward, the IRS has removed reporting for nonemployee compensation from Form 1099-MISC, box 7 to Form 1099-NEC.\n\nCombined Federal/State Filing Program\n\nAlthough the Comptroller of Maryland is a participant in the IRS Combined Federal/State Filing Program, we are not able to process any 1099's that are submitted via this program.\n\nIf you are participating in the Combined Federal/State filing program, Maryland still requires you to submit your 1099 file via SFTP directly to Maryland.\n\nThe State of Maryland will follow federal guidelines. Please reference the 2023 Maryland Employer Reporting of 1099s Instruction and Specifications and IRS Publication 1220 for detailed information.\n\nFor assistance with Maryland employer withholding, 410-260-7980 in Central Maryland or 1-800-638-2937 from elsewhere, Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. You can also e-mail your withholding questions to us at taxhelp@marylandtaxes.gov\n\nElectronic Filing\n\nFor assistance with magnetic media reporting, call 410-260-7150 from Central Maryland, Monday - Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\nE-mail questions concerning electronic filing to efilew21099help@marylandtaxes.gov\n\nEmployer Withholding FAQs\n\nUnemployment Insurance\n\nFor information about with unemployment insurance, visit the Maryland Division of Unemployment Insurance Web site.\n\nWithholding Online Services\n\nFile Withholding Taxes Electronically\n\nFiling Business Taxes Electronically\n\nFile Form MW508 and W-2s Electronically\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Calculator\n\nThe Withholding Tax Facts are developed by the Comptroller's Office each year to inform taxpayers of any new legislation affecting withholding tax and/or new procedures on how it is collected, remitted etc.\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2024\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2023\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2022\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2021\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2020\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2019\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2018\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2017\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2016\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2015\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2014\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2013\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2012\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2011\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2010\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2009\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2008\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2007\n\nWithholding Tax Facts 2006\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (09/2023)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2022)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2021)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Employer Withholding Requirements for Teleworking Employees (05/04/2020)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2020)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Employer Withholding Requirements for Teleworking Employees During the COVID-19 Emergency (05/2020)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2019)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2018)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2017)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2016)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2015)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2014)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (10/2013)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Changes in Income Tax and Employer Withholding (06/2012)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Earned Income Tax Credit notification requirement for employers (12/2011)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Important notice to employers regarding changes in the income tax withholding, effective January 1, 2010, as a result of the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act (11/2009)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Important notice to employers regarding changes in the income tax and income tax withholding, effective July 1, 2008 (06/2008)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – (12/2007)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alerts En Español\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Los empleadores están requeridos de notificar acerca del Crédito por el Ingreso Trabajado (10/2022)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Los empleadores están requeridos de notificar acerca del Crédito por el Ingreso Trabajado (10/2021)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Los empleadores están requeridos de notificar acerca del Crédito por el Ingreso Trabajado (10/2020)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Los empleadores están requeridos de notificar acerca del Crédito por el Ingreso Trabajado (10/2019)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Los empleadores están requeridos de notificar acerca del Crédito por el Ingreso Trabajado (10/2018)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Los empleadores están requeridos de notificar acerca del Crédito por el Ingreso Trabajado (10/2017)\n\nEmployer Withholding Tax Alert – Los empleadores están requeridos de notificar acerca del Crédito por el Ingreso Trabajado (10/2014)"
