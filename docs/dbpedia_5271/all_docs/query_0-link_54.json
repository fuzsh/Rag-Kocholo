        "text": "I am incredibly honored to come home to where I started my career with The Nature Conservancy eight years ago as urban conservation director, now with the privilege of serving as the executive director of the Maryland/DC chapter. This region is unique, unlike any other place in the world: from the forested Appalachian Mountains, to our vibrant cities, to the fertile agricultural lands, to the storied waters of the Chesapeake Bay, where the crash of every wave is a whisper of the rich history in which this region is interwoven with the natural resources that have shaped the course of history for our region.\n\nThese places are all connected, and we feel a mighty responsibility to care for this beautiful place in which we have the privilege to reside.\n\nThough I’ve had opportunities that have taken me away for periods of time, the National Capital Region has always been my home. I have always felt the magnetic pull of this landscape, and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to lead critical conservation work that will have lasting benefits for our communities.\n\nOur region is not spared from the stark realities of the environmental crises plaguing our planet. Climate change wreaks havoc on our ecosystems and threatens our quality of life. Now, more than ever, is the time for us to tackle the environmental challenges we face and for our region to continue to be at the vanguard of implementing solutions that protect nature and people. Our chapter is in a fortunate position to serve as an example to others.\n\nOur staff, partners and supporters share the passion and commitment to lead ambitious and innovative projects and programs designed to deliver lasting solutions to the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss so that others around the world can look to us for inspiration.\n\nMy career at TNC has highlighted the importance of both firmly establishing tangible solutions at the local level while working with partners that span large geographies to achieve success at scale. I am keen to work with all of you as brothers and sisters in conservation as we keep our sights set on 2030—a year that represents a tipping point for our planet.\n\nI am grateful for your continued support as we tackle existential environmental threats locally and globally, for current and future generations. I look forward to this new adventure and the fruitful impacts we will have together in our home.\n\nRead the Press Release: Kahlil Kettering Named New Executive Director of The Nature Conservancy’s Maryland and DC Chapter\n\nKahlil Kettering, Executive Director\n\nKahlil provides overall management and leadership for the Maryland/DC Chapter’s conservation and policy work across the state and district. He previously served as TNC’s Bezos Earth Fund Program Director from 2021-2023. In this role, he provided strategic management, overseeing all TNC deliverables associated with the $100M Bezos Earth Fund gift to TNC. He served as the point person working with project teams around the globe to collaboratively deploy and scale natural climate solutions to capture greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPrior to this position, Kahlil started his career at TNC as the inaugural Urban Conservation Program Director for the Maryland/DC chapter from 2015-2021, where he developed conservation strategies in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, centered on implementing projects that elevate the intersection of protecting nature in urban areas and the benefits nature provides people in cities.\n\n“Now, more than ever, is the time for us to tackle the environmental challenges we face, and for our region to continue to be at the vanguard of implementing solutions that protect nature and people.”"
