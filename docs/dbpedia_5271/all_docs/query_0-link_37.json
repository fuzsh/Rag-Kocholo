        "text": "Tillman's formula came to ultimate fruition in 2017 when Maryland captured its first NCAA National Championship since 1975. He then led the Terps back to the top in 2022 with an undefeated 18-0 season capped by the 2022 National Championship.\n\nSince taking over the helm as Maryland head coach 13 years ago, Tillman has led the Terps to 10 NCAA Final Fours, eight national title games and a 181-52 (.777) overall record. He will enter his 15th season at Maryland in 2025.\n\nTillman's Career Record (16 seasons): 201-71 (.739)\n\nTillman's Record at Maryland (13 seasons): 181-52 (.787)\n\nTillman's NCAA Record: 31-11 (.737), 10 Final Fours, 2017 and 2022 National Champion\n\n(updated after the 2024 season)\n\nMember of the Tewaaraton Selection Committee\n\nMember of the IMLCA Diversity and Inclusion Committee\n\nChair, NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Rules Committee\n\nTillman's numbers since arriving in College Park in 2011 are impressive, leading the country in All-American selections (88), NCAA Tournament wins (31) and Final Fours (10) during that 14-year span.\n\nIn just 14 NCAA Tournament appearances, Tillman has already supplanted himself among the greatest coaches in history. His 31-11 (.738) career NCAA Tournament record ranks sixth all-time in NCAA history.\n\nAdditionally, the program's accomplishments have translated to the classroom, as Tillman has had 23 USILA Scholar All-Americans in 14 seasons. The 2015 spring semester and 2016 fall semester combined for the program's highest GPA in more than 10 years.\n\nTillman led the Terps to their 10th Final Four and eighth national title game since 2011 in the 2024 season. It also marked 21 straight years for the program with both double-digit wins and postseason appearances.\n\nUnder Tillman, three Terps earned USILA All-American and All-Big Ten honors in Ajax Zappitello, Luke Wierman and Eric Spanos. Zappitello also earned the Lt. Raymond Enners Outstanding Player of the Year, the first close defenseman to do so since 1993, and the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year award. Wierman finished the season as the NCAA Division I statistical champion for Face-Off Winning Percentage. The Terps also had three USILA Scholar All-Americans (Zappitello, Wierman, Jack Koras).\n\nIn 2023, Tillman led the Terps to an NCAA-best 20th consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance. Maryland finished with 10 wins in the 2023 campaign, marking the 20th year in a row the program hit double-digit wins, the longest active streak in NCAA Division I men's lacrosse.\n\nThe 2022 season was one to remember for Tillman and the Terps. Maryland became the first undefeated NCAA Champion since 2006 and the team's 18 wins were the most ever by an undefeated champion. Unanimously named 2022 Big Ten Coach of the Year, Tillman's Terps were Big Ten Regular Season Champions and Big Ten Tournament Champions for the second straight year.\n\nThe 2022 offense set program records in points (522), goals (318), goals per game (17.67), and assists (204). The team's 204 assists were an NCAA record.\n\nIndividually, 2022 was also an astounding season. While Logan Wisnauskas set Maryland records for career points and goals en route to the first 100-point season in Terps history, others made their mark as well.\n\nMaryland earned the maximum eight players to the All-Big Ten teams and then a program-record 12 USILA All-American selections. The Terps took home the Tewaaraton Award, Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, and Big Ten Specialist of the Year. Logan McNaney, from Tillman's same hometown of Corning, NY, took home Most Outstanding Player of the 2022 Final Four.\n\n2021 brought one of the most remarkable campaigns in Maryland lacrosse history, as Tillman led Maryland to 15 straight wins, the Big Ten Regular Season and Tournament Titles, and the National Championship game.\n\nThe Terrapin offense was firing at historic levels, ranking second in the nation in scoring offense (15.94), first in shooting percentage (39%), first in points per game (25.69) and second in assists per game (9.75). Maryland set program records for points in a season (411), goals in a season (255) and assists in a season (156), toppling marks that had stood at UMD since the 1970s.\n\nNine Terps earned USILA All-American honors in 2021. Jared Bernhardt compiled the greatest individual offensive season in program history under his guidance, becoming the program’s second-ever Tewaaraton Award winner while setting new Maryland records for career points (290), goals (202), single-season points (99), single-season goals (71), goals in a single NCAA Tournament (18) and points in a single NCAA Tournament (24).\n\nMaryland was set up for another memorable season under Tillman in 2020, racing out to a 5-1 start and No. 4 ranking in the USILA Coaches Poll before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the shortened season, the Terps picked up two top-10 wins over No. 6 Penn and No. 5 Notre Dame and five players earned Inside Lacrosse Media All-America honors.\n\nTillman’s 2019 team advanced to the program’s 17th consecutive NCAA Tournament while reaching the quarterfinal round for the sixth straight season. Jared Bernhardt became Tillman’s third consecutive Tewaaraton Finalist while becoming one of five Terrapins to garner USILA All-American honors.\n\nMaryland did not skip a beat in 2018 despite losing four first team All-Americans to graduation from the 2017 title team, as Tillman led the Terps to their fifth straight Final Four and seventh in eight seasons and a Big Ten regular season title. Connor Kelly became the third Tewaaraton finalist in program history and was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, and five individuals were named USILA All-Americans.\n\nMaryland went 16-3 and captured the Big Ten regular season and tournament titles en route to capturing the 2017 National Championship. Tillman coached Matt Rambo, who set team records for points (257) and goals (155) en route to capturing the program's first-ever Tewaaraton Award, and Tim Muller, who earned the Schmeisser Award for being the nation's top defender. The Terps had a nation's-best nine USILA All-America selections, while Isaiah Davis-Allen became just the second student-athlete in Maryland history to receive the Senior CLASS Award.\n\nThe Terrapins won a program record 17 games in addition to piecing together a single-season record 16 consecutive wins in 2016 as they returned to the National Championship game, where they lost an overtime heartbreaker to UNC. Tillman's team swept the Big Ten regular season and tournament titles, while compiling the NCAA's top-ranked RPI. Eight players earned USILA All-America honors and Matt Dunn was named a Senior CLASS Award First Team All-American.\n\nMaryland had another phenomenal season in 2015 when Tillman led the team to a Terrapin single-season record 15 victories and a berth in the NCAA national title game. The Terps featured the top-ranked scoring defense (7.1 goals allowed/g), as junior Kyle Bernlohr claimed the Ensign C. Markland Kelly, Jr. Award. Additionally, five players earned USILA All-America honors and Casey Ikeda was also a USILA Scholar All-American.\n\nTillman captured his first career ACC Coach of the Year honor by leading the Terps to the 2014 ACC regular season championship and the program's third Final Four appearance in four seasons. Senior Niko Amato earned the Ensign C. Markland Kelly, Jr. Award as the nation's most outstanding goalie, as five Maryland players earned USILA All-America honors.\n\nTillman's third season in College Park saw the Terps ascend to the top of the national rankings for the first time since 2006, following a 12-10 win at then-No. 1 Loyola on Feb. 21. Maryland earned a bid to the NCAA tournament for the 11th consecutive season, which is the longest active streak in Division I men's lacrosse. Seniors Jesse Bernhardt and John Haus became the first Terrapins since 2006 to earn first-team All-America honors, leading a group of seven Maryland honorees.\n\nThe 2012 season was viewed by many as a rebuilding year after Maryland graduated 17 seniors in 2011, but Tillman rallied the team and the Terrapins returned to the NCAA championship game with sensational postseason performances from seniors Joe Cummings and Drew Snider among others. Five Terps earned All-America honors following Maryland's 12-6 campaign and junior Jesse Bernhardt was selected as co-recipient of the ACC's first-ever Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nIn his first season in College Park Tillman guided the Terps to a 13-5 record, the 2011 ACC championship (the program's first since 2005) and a berth in the NCAA championship game (the first for the Terps since 1998). Eight Terrapins earned All-America honors in Tillman's first season, which is the most Maryland players selected in a single-season since 2004.\n\nTillman was hired as the University of Maryland's head men's lacrosse coach on June 16, 2010, becoming the ninth coach in the then-85-year history of the program.\n\nWidely considered one of the top coaches in the country and a dynamic recruiter, Tillman was the head men's lacrosse coach at Harvard for three seasons prior to his arrival in College Park. His last recruiting class for the Crimson was rated No. 3 in the nation, according to Inside Lacrosse.\n\nDuring his three seasons at Harvard, Tillman compiled an overall record of 20-19, including an 8-5 mark in 2009, which was the Crimson's highest win total since 1999.\n\nTillman's time at Harvard produced a number of the most memorable wins in the program's history. His last season, during which Harvard climbed as high as No. 11 in the national polls, Tillman guided the Crimson to an 11-8 victory over No. 6 Princeton, which was the first time Harvard had defeated the Tigers in 20 years. In 2009, Tillman led the Crimson to a season-opening 9-6 upset victory at No. 5 Duke.\n\nTillman improved his teams in every aspect over during his three seasons. Prior to his arrival in Cambridge, Mass., the Crimson ranked 40th and 42nd, respectively, in total offense and defense. Tillman's defense ranked as high as No. 3 in the nation, while his offense rose to No. 15 in the country. He also dramatically improved Harvard's extra-man offense, from the 51st-ranked unit before he arrived, to a perennial top 15 unit.\n\nPrior to Harvard, Tillman spent 12 seasons at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. After six seasons as an assistant coach, he was promoted to head assistant coach and offensive coordinator prior to the 2002 season. From 2004 through 2007, Tillman helped lead the Midshipmen to the some of the most successful seasons in program history, including four straight NCAA tournament berths, four consecutive Patriot League tournament titles and four straight Patriot League regular season championships.\n\nIn 2004, with Tillman at the helm of the Navy offense, the Mids made a remarkable run through the NCAA tournament, defeating three Ivy League teams (Penn, Cornell and Princeton) en route to a spot in the national championship game. Tillman's offense was a key component of Navy's success that season, ranking third in the nation in scoring offense. Following the Mids' tremendous 2004 season, Tillman was awarded the first of his two Collegiate Lacrosse Assistant Coach of the Year Awards by the Maryland State Lacrosse Coaches Association.\n\nDuring his 12 season at the Naval Academy, Tillman was responsible for helping develop first team All-America midfielders Graham Gill and Billy Looney and second team All-America attackman Jon Birsner. In his 12 seasons in Annapolis, the Mids compiled an overall record of 104-63.\n\nTillman started his coaching career as an assistant coach at Ithaca College. He spent four seasons (1992-95) with the Bombers, helping lead them to the Division III national semifinals in 1992.\n\nIn addition to his extensive coaching experience, Tillman also serves as a member of the Tewaaraton Award Men's Selection Committee.\n\nTillman is also extremely active in the community, regularly speaking to local schools and lacrosse programs. He has been highly involved with Team IMPACT since 2015, which matches children with life-threatening illnesses with sports programs. In addition, he also regularly coaches in the annual \"Shootout for Soldiers\" event locally.\n\nA 1991 graduate of Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration, Tillman was a three-year member of the school's Dean's list. He had the opportunity to play for legendary coach Richie Moran and was a member of the 1989 squad that earned a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nTillman was a goalie when he entered college, but played a number of positions for the Big Red, giving him a great appreciation and understanding for the overall game of lacrosse.\n\nTillman played professionally for the Baltimore Thunder and the Washington Power of the National Lacrosse League. During his final two seasons in Baltimore, he helped the Thunder reach the NLL Championship and Semifinals. Tillman also played for the Toyota Lacrosse Club, who won five-consecutive Southern Division Championships, including a world championship in 2000.\n\nA native of Corning, N.Y., Tillman was previously commissioned into the U.S. Navy as a fleet support officer and was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal."
