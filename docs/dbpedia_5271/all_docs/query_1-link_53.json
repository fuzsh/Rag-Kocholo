        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nBrian Williams\n\nTitle\n\nDefensive Coordinator/Defensive Line Coach\n\nEmail\n\nbwill347@umd.edu\n\nBrian Williams is entering year six with the Terrapins in 2024. Williams joined the Maryland coaching staff in 2019 and was promoted to Defensive Coordinator in February 2022. He also serves as the Terrapins defensive line coach.\n\nWilliams, who was on Head Coach Michael Locksley's first staff at Maryland, served as the Terps outside linebackers coach in 2019, the defensive line coach in 2020 and was elevated to co-defensive coordinator in 2021.\n\nMaryland's defense has taken significant strides forward under Williams' leadership and the defense has allowed less points per game each year since 2019. The 2023 season was particularly impressive as the Terps allowed just 22.5 points per game, the fewest number since 2010.\n\nWilliams also led six defenders to All-Big Ten honors for the most for the Terrapins since 2014 in defensive backs Tarheeb Still, Beau Brade and Ja'Quan Sheppard, defensive lineman Quashon Fuller, and linebackers Ruben Hyppolite II and Jaishawn Barham. Still, a 2024 NFL Draft selection, led the way with special team honors.\n\nWilliams' defense was essential in Maryland beating Auburn 31-13 in the TransPerfect Music City Bowl, marking the first time in program history that Maryland has won bowl games in three straight seasons. In that game, the Maryland defense had two interceptions, including a pick-six.\n\nIn 2022, Maryland also allowed the fewest number of rushing yards and total yards for a Terps defense since 2012. Williams' defense steadily improved as the year went on and Maryland didn't allow a touchdown over the final 132 minutes of play in 2022.\n\nWilliams saw five of his defenders earn All-Big Ten recognition in 2022 as defensive backs Deonte Banks, Jakorian Bennett and Beau Brade, linebacker Jaishawn Barham and defensive lineman Ami Finau were all recognized by the league after the regular season. Barham was also named as a Freshman All-American by the College Football News. In Williams' first season as the Defensive Coordinator, Maryland won eight games and captured the 2022 Duke's Mayo Bowl.\n\nIn 2021, Williams guided Sam Okuayinonu to a career year where he earned Third Team All-Big Ten honors after leading the Terrapins and standing 12th in the Big Ten with six sacks (all solo). The defensive lineman also led the team with 8.5 tackles for loss. Ami Finau also earned Big Ten plaudits under Williams after a season where he had several impressive games for the Terps, including posting a career-high 11 tackles to go along with a sack and forced fumble at Michigan State.\n\nWilliams served as the primary play caller for the Terps final two games in 2021 - wins over Rutgers and Virginia Tech. With Williams on the headset, the Terps allowed just 26 total points in those two games, which were the two lowest point totals allowed by the Maryland defense against Power Five teams all season. Maryland only allowed 298 yards of total offense per game over those two, totaled six sacks, held Rutgers and Virginia Tech 8-of-29 on third down and forced two turnovers, including returning a fumble for a touchdown against the Hokies.\n\nMaryland's defensive line saw drastic improvement under Williams in 2020, led by All-Big Ten performer Mosiah Nasili-Kite, who led the Big Ten and ranked 23rd nationally in with 0.80 sacks per game, recording four. In just five games, Maryland had more sacks than it did in nine Big Ten games the year prior, tallying 14 in 2020, the second-best per game mark in the Big Ten, averaging 2.60 per game. Three different defensive lineman: Nasili-Kite, Finau and Okuayinonu all recorded at least a half sack.\n\nAs the head of the outside linebacker unit in 2019, Williams coached graduate transfer Keandre Jones to a career year, where he earned All-Big Ten plaudits. Jones led Maryland and ranked 27th in the nation (seventh in the Big Ten) with 15.0 tackles for loss and led the Terps with seven sacks, three forced fumbles and three quarterback hits, while recording 74 tackles (49 solo).\n\nPreviously at UAB, Georgia and Florida State, Williams is regarded as one of the best recruiters in the nation. He was dubbed as the top recruiter in the Big Ten and sixth best recruiter nationally by 247Sports after the 2021 recruiting cycle. Since Williams' arrival, the Terps have had four consecutive top-40 classes, including the No. 18 class nationally in 2021. Williams was the lead recruiter on current Terps Ruben Hyppolite II, Taizse Johnson and Tommy Akingbesote. In the 2023 class, Williams' strong connections in Florida brought in Jonathan Akins and Deandre Duffus.\n\nPrior to Maryland, Williams helped lead UAB to a Conference USA Championship and the program’s first ever 11-win season in 2018 under Eddie Robinson National Coach of the Year Bill Clark. Under Williams guidance, redshirt senior Chris Woolbright earned all-conference honors after leading the Blazers with 83 tackles and two interceptions while tallying 13.5 tackles for loss.\n\nIn 2017, Williams helped lead the Blazers to a successful campaign which was highlighted by the development of senior Tevin Crews. Crews stayed at UAB during the program’s two-year hiatus and once he was back on the field, Williams coached him to career numbers and All-Conference USA accolades. Crews was the only player in Conference USA to rank in the top 10 in both tackles per game (7.8) and tackles for loss (12.0). He finished the season with a career-high and team-best 102 tackles to go along with his 12 TFLs, three sacks, three pass breakups, one interception and one forced fumble.\n\nOverall, Williams helped UAB return from a two-year hiatus in 2017 to set the program record for FBS wins (8), Conference USA wins (6) and finished with a perfect 6-0 record at home for the first time ever. The Blazers’ appearance in the Bahamas Bowl was just the second bowl game in program history.\n\nAlthough 2017 was Williams’ first year coaching games at UAB, he joined the Blazers coaching staff in January of 2016 to help bring the program back.\n\nPrior to UAB, Williams was at the University of Georgia in 2015 as the player relations director for the Bulldogs’ defense. Before that, he was on staff at Florida State for two years as a defensive analyst and was a part of the Seminoles’ 29-game winning streak which included winning the 2013 National Championship.\n\nThe Florida State defense finished the 2013 season allowing just 12.1 points against, anchored by linebackers Telvin Smith and Reggie Northrup. Smith led the team with 90 tackles and 9.5 TFL. Williams contributed to FSU’s defense that ranked second in total defense, first in passing defense and third in rushing defense.\n\nWilliams had a very successful high school coaching career before jumping to the collegiate level. His first coaching stop was at Rickards High School in Tallahassee. He then returned to his alma mater of Miami Carol City High School where he spent seven years coaching football and teaching math and special education.\n\nAfter one year in Georgia, Williams moved back to Tallahassee to begin a three-year stint at Godby High School as the Defensive Coordinator. Williams helped Godby win the Florida state title in 2012 as the Cougars finished with an overall record of 15-1.\n\nWilliams played high school ball at Miami Carol under legendary Florida coach Walt Frazier. He earned a scholarship at Albany State University in Georgia and then transferred to Florida A&M where he finished his college degree in 2002.\n\nWilliams is married to the former Diasha Walker.\n\nUpdated July 10, 2024\n\nPersonal Information\n\nFull Name: Brian C.
