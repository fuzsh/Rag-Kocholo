        "text": "What is Domestic Violence?\n\nIt’s one or more abusive acts between family or household members, or victims of sexual assault. Get help.\n\nWhat is a protective order?\n\nIt’s a court order that says one person must refrain from doing certain acts against another person. It’s Maryland’s version of a restraining order or stay-away order.\n\nCan I get a protective order?\n\nYou must have a certain type of relationship with the other person to be eligible for a protective order. Your relationship qualifies if you:\n\nare married, divorced, or currently separated;\n\nare related by marriage, blood or adoption (this includes stepparents and stepchildren if they have lived with you for at least 90 days in the past year);\n\nhave lived together in a sexual relationship for at least 90 days in the past year;\n\nare the parents of a child together;\n\nhave had a sexual relationship with each other in the past year;\n\nare a vulnerable adult;\n\nwere raped or sexually assaulted by the other person (including attempts) in the past six months.\n\nWhat if my relationship doesn’t qualify for a protective order?\n\nA peace order is another way the court can protect you. Any relationship that does NOT qualify for a protective order is eligible for a peace order. Those relationships include neighbors, strangers, or someone with whom you have a non-sexual dating relationship. Learn about peace orders. See a brochure on protective orders.\n\nWhat is an abusive act?\n\nBefore the court can grant a final protective order, you must prove that the other person committed an act of abuse. Get help. Acts of abuse include:\n\nassault;\n\nan act that places a person in fear of imminent serious bodily harm;\n\nan act that causes serious bodily harm;\n\nrape or sexual offense, or attempted rape or sexual offense;\n\nstalking;\n\nfalse imprisonment;\n\nrevenge porn.\n\nWhich forms do I need for a protective order?\n\nFile a Petition for Protection from Domestic Violence, or form CC-DC-DV-001. Attach a form called the Addendum-Description of Respondent, or form CC-DC-DV-001A. Law enforcement uses this Addendum when serving paperwork on the other person. Find the forms online. Or, ask a court clerk or court commissioner for forms.\n\nCan I keep my address private?\n\nWhen you file court documents to open a case, law enforcement must give copies of those documents – which include your contact information – to the other person. If you’re concerned about your safety because disclosing your address puts you at risk of further harm, ask the court to keep your contact information private. Use the form called Request to Withhold Address, or form CC-DC-DV-026. There is also a more permanent way to keep your address private on all documents called Safe-At-Home. Learn more at mdcourts.gov/addressprivacy.\n\nWhere do I file my completed forms?\n\nFile your papers in a courthouse when they are open. If you have a current custody or divorce case with the other person, consider filing in the same courthouse where that case was heard. Courts are open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. most weekdays. If courts are closed, find a District Court Commissioner’s Office. Keep in mind that office ONLY accepts protective order petitions when courts are closed.\n\nCan I file my petition remotely/electronically?\n\nHouse Bill 296 (Ch. 334)/Senate Bill 280 (Ch.335)\n\nTemporary Protective Orders - Electronic Filing and Video Conferencing Hearing\n\nEFFECTIVE 10.01.2022\n\nAuthorizes a petitioner to file electronically a petition for a temporary protective order with a court from:\n\ndomestic violence prevention/assistance program\n\nsexual assault prevention/assistance program\n\nhuman trafficking prevention/ assistance program\n\nchild advocacy center\n\nvulnerable adult program\n\nhospital where the petitioner is receiving medical treatment\n\nAnother location approved by the court\n\nA court that receives a petition filed electronically shall hold a hearing through the use of video conferencing on either the same business day if the petition is filed during regular court hours and the court is open or the next business day the court is open if the petition is not filed during regular court hours.\n\nThese advocacy groups may access the necessary filing information here (Authorization Required)\n\n*If you need access to this page, please contact the clerk’s office\n\nWhat happens after I file my petition with the court or commissioner?\n\nIf you filed your petition with a commissioner when court is closed, you will have an immediate interim hearing where you will explain the events and behaviors that you believe were abusive. If the commissioner finds that your relationship qualifies and the abuse occurred, they will issue an interim protective order which lasts about two days. Your papers will include a date and time for a temporary hearing in court. At this hearing, you explain what happened to a judge. If you filed your petition during court hours with a clerk of the court, this will be your first immediate hearing. If a judge determines your relationship qualifies and abuse occurred, they will issue a temporary order which lasts for seven days, unless the court extends it.\n\nKeep in contact with the court as it schedules your final hearing. Both individuals may be at this formal hearing and offer testimony and evidence.\n\nWhat are the safeguards in a protective order?\n\nOrders granted at the beginning of your case (interim or temporary orders) provide short-term safeguards for a few days or weeks. The court can order the other person to:\n\nstop abusing, threatening, or harassing you;\n\nhave no contact with you;\n\nstay away from your home, work, or school;\n\nleave your home (if you are married OR if your name is on the lease or deed).\n\nYour order might also address temporary child custody, possession of a pet, safeguards at child-care providers, and possession of firearms.\n\nOrders granted at the end of your case (final protective orders) provide safeguards for up to a year. The court can order those safeguards listed above, plus the following additional provisions:\n\nuse and possession of a jointly owned vehicle (your name must be on the title);\n\ncounseling for domestic violence or substance abuse;\n\na temporary child access or visitation schedule;\n\nemergency family maintenance or financial support. You qualify if you and the other person are married or if you have custody of children.\n\nI was served with a protective order. What do I do?\n\nYou are identified on those papers as the Respondent. You are not being arrested or charged with a crime. Carefully read the order which explains how much contact, if any, you may have with the Petitioner. The order will include a hearing date. This is not a criminal case, so you are not entitled to a public defender. The judge will ask whether you want to agree (or consent) to the order. You may also challenge (or contest) the order. Protective orders have serious consequences. Consider speaking with a lawyer.\n\nCan I ask the court to limit public access to my protective order case?\n\nThe court may limit access to case records under certain circumstance. Read more about how to ask the court to keep information private.\n\nWhere can I get help with domestic violence or filing a protective order?\n\nHouse of Ruth Domestic Violence Hotline (410) 889-7884\n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline (800) 799-SAFE\n\nMaryland Network Against Domestic Violence\n\nGet help. A list of domestic violence service providers in Maryland\n\nWhat is Victim Information and Notification Everyday (VINE) – Protective Order (VPO)?\n\nIt’s an automated notification system. Register your protective order case with VPO to receive notifications about whether the order has been served, expired, or dismissed. Read more about Maryland VPO. Register a protective order case with VPO. Read more about VINE.\n\nHow do I enforce, modify, or extend my protective order?\n\nIt’s a crime to violate certain conditions of a protective order, such as contacting, harassing, or abusing someone. File criminal charges at a commissioner’s office or call police, who may arrest someone who violates an order. If found guilty, they face up to 90 days in jail and up to $1,000 in fines.\n\nAnother option when someone disobeys a court order is called contempt. File for contempt if a Respondent violates ANY provision of the protective order. Submit a Petition for Contempt (Violation of Protective Order) or form CC-DC-DV-007 and ask for a hearing. There is no specific penalty if the court finds someone in contempt, but a judge may order whatever is necessary to enforce a protective order. This may include jail time."
