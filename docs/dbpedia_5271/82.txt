Discovered in 1965 by a Chicago news reporter working for the Flash Taxicab Company as a driver and living in a rented room in the basement of the YMCA -- only eight years after having been Governor. His explanation is that he had "got drunk." Marland actually enjoyed being a taxi driver, explaining that it was his ambition in politics which likely drove him to drink. Soon after the story made the national papers, he gained employment for a wealthy racetrack owner, but he succumbed to pancreatic cancer later that same year.
