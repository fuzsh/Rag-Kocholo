        "text": "ContagiousThe Isley Brothers\n\nThe Isley Brother's song, \"Contagious,\" peaked at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100. This meant that the band of brothers became the first group to score a Top 50 hit in six consecutive decades on the chart.\n\nThunderstruckAC/DC\n\nAngus Young created the distinctive opening guitar part for \"Thuderstruck\" by playing with all the strings taped up, except the B. He learned the studio trick from his older brother George Young, who was the rhythm guitarist for The Easybeats.\n\nThe Jean GenieDavid Bowie\n\nThe band Simple Minds took their name from the line \"He's so simple minded he can't drive his module\" in David Bowie's \"The Jean Genie.\"\n\nPaper PlanesM.I.A.\n\n\"Paper Planes\" was inspired by M.I.A.'s hassles trying to get a visa to enter America.\n\nRudeMagic!\n\n\"Magic\" was the first word to serve as both the title of a #1 hit (Olivia Newton-John's 1980 tune \"Magic\") and the name of an artist behind a chart-topping song (Magic!'s 2014 hit \"Rude\").\n\nPossessionSarah McLachlan\n\nSarah McLachlan's \"Possession\" contains passages from letters a stalker sent her. He sued her for $250,000 and committed suicide before the trial.\n\nIncongruent Opening ActsSong Writing\n\nHere's what happens when an opening act is really out of place with the headliner, like when Beastie Boys opened for Madonna.\n\nJohn Lee HookerSongwriter Interviews\n\nInto the vaults for Bruce Pollock's 1984 conversation with the esteemed bluesman. Hooker talks about transforming a Tony Bennett classic and why you don't have to be sad and lonely to write the blues.\n\nGene Simmons of KissSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe Kiss rocker covers a lot of ground in this interview, including why there are no Kiss collaborations, and why the Rock Hall has \"become a sham.\""
