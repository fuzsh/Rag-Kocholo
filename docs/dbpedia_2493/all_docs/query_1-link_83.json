        "text": "NEW YORK, Jan. 6 (UPI) -- R&B group B2K has disbanded after six years and millions of records sold, Billboard reported Tuesday.\n\nThe act, composed of Omarion, Lil Fizz, J-Boog and Raz, released three albums, two EPs and a soundtrack through Sony's Epic label.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe group's 2002 self-titled release debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's top R&B/hip-hop albums chart.\n\n\"We've had a great run together making hit songs, albums and now movies,\" said Chris Stokes, the band's manager. \"The kids are growing up and are interested in pursing their own careers. I have enormous respect for each of them, and I wish them success in their pursuit of their individual careers. B2K was an extremely talented singing group that will surely be missed.\"\n\nThe group's biggest hit featured Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs on the song \"Bump, Bump Bump,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April.\n\nAt the end of December, B2K performed several shows together in support of the \"You Got Served\" soundtrack.\n\nThere is no word on whether the group will perform at a previously scheduled show on March 5 with Bow Wow at Texas' annual RodeoHouston event."
