        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nO'RYAN\n\nTake It Slow\n\nProducer(s): BAM & Ryan\n\nWriter(s): various\n\nPublisher(s): various\n\nGenre: R&B/HIP-HOP\n\nLabel/Catalog Number: TUG Entertainment/Universal 21231 (CD promo)\n\nSource: Billboard Magazine\n\nOriginally Reviewed: June 19, 2004\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his brother, former B2K frontman Omarion, O'Ryan makes his debut with \"Take It Slow.\" Unlike many of his contemporaries, the 16-year-old singer steps out on a limb, choosing to introduce himself with a straight-up ballad. The gamble appears to have paid off. The guitar-accented track, produced by the team of BAM & Ryan, never overpowers the young upstart's voice. Instead, it provides the perfect backing for O'Ryan to showcase his tenor. Lyrically, the single covers familiar territory—taking one's time with love—and even references Usher's \"Nice & Slow.\" With his musical pedigree and a sound that is mature beyond his years, O'Ryan shouldn't have a problem getting airplay at R&B radio. He may even give his brother a run for his money in the near future.—RH\n\nPost by ClassicCase on\n\nJust as I predicted....one of the members of B2K will go off with something this good. I think this kid will make it. Sounds like possible staying power if he keeps it up.\n\nIsn't there an album that we must look forward to from O'Ryan?\n\nPost by HER MINAJesty on\n\nIm not sure if you are confused, but O'Ryan was never in B2K. He is the younger brother of Omarion, who WAS in B2K.\n\nPost by ClassicCase on\n\nJust said:\n\nIm not sure if you are confused, but O'Ryan was never in B2K. He is the younger brother of Omarion, who WAS in B2K.\n\nOooooh......I see.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nHe looks just like Omarion. This sounds like B2K even though it's better than most of their songs. But B2K is over and I'm alright with that so this is just unnecessary.\n\nPost by strong4PMB! on\n\nI don't care for it. He seems to have a better voice than Omarion (judging by the video), but he doesn't bring anything new to the table, so I say \"Nay.\" He's just another addition to TUG's list of flops.\n\nPost by HER MINAJesty on\n\nI didn't pay attention to it but I saw the video on BET last week. The new girl in 3LW plays his love interest in the video. He does look exactly like Omarion, but I bet this will flop as well."
