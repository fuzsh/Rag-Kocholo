        "text": "Omarion has recently broken his silence on reuniting with his group B2k, and while the lead singer of the quartet talked about his experience on the “Millennium Tour,” he also touched upon releasing new music and his next solo project.\n\nDuring a recent interview, the 34-year-old said that B2K’s reunion tour almost didn’t happen. “It was moments that that was an actuality, but I think the universe just made it so,” Omarion said.\n\n“I think it was meant to be. It was just meant to be. It’s certain things that happen in your life and you think, ‘How am I going to get through this? Or what’s going to happen?’ And there were times when the tour was like that,” Omarion explained. O also said that there was one point where B2k went from four members to three.\n\n“We even get down to three members, so I didn’t really know what to expect but I knew I wanted to finish it. I was also reminded of why we were separated and why a lot of fans felt the way that they did,” Omarion said. He said that when B2k separated it was like a “bad marriage.”\n\nWhen Omarion was asked if he had new music coming out, he said yes and talked about how it was innovative and bold. “We got tunes in the clip, and without speaking too much on it because at this point, I’m not doing anything that is short of unprecedented, new, and forward,” Omarion explained.\n\nAlthough many fans wanted to hear new music from B2k to coincide with the tour, Omarion said that they needed to focus on their trek around the nation.\n\n“We were prominently focused on the tour. Everyone wanted new music, but I said let’s get through the tour guys,” Omarion explained. “It’s all about the fans. It’s all about supply and demand.”\n\nWhen Omarion was asked if reality TV helped or hurt his career, the R&B singer said his stint on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood was all a part of his plan.\n\n“For me, it was a plan at the time when I was on a record label where I didn’t really have the support that I deserved. Love & Hip Hop, I saw as an opportunity for me to get my music out there,” Omarion shared.\n\n“And at the time it was supposed to be and it worked. Also, I’m a pretty private person, so I thought that it would be a good opportunity to just share my life.” During the interview, O also revealed that he now has his own record label titled Omarion Word Wide that he’s very excited about.\n\nGlennisha Morgan is a Detroit-bred multimedia journalist and writer.
