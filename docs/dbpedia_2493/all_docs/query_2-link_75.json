        "text": "NEW YORK — Bow Wow and Omarion’s collaborative album will be out before the end of the year. “Face Off” will arrive Dec. 11 via Columbia as a standard 12-track CD or as a CD/DVD combo featuring behind-the-scenes footage and videos from the artists’ prior albums.\n\nAlbum track “Hood Star” has been making the rounds online since last month, and another song, “Girlfriend” is also at radio now. A video for the latter is scheduled to premiere on BET next week, while a video for album track “Hey Baby” is being timed to the album’s release week.\n\nThe two performers are hardly strangers, having partnered on past Scream tours, while former B2K frontman Omarion appeared on Bow Wow’s 2004 single “Let Me Hold You.”\n\n“He’s one of my best friends,” Bow Wow said of Omarion. “So any time you get a chance to work with somebody you’re best friends with, it’s not even gonna be like work.\n\nBow Wow will be on the road starting in early December with Chris Brown, with Omarion scheduled to make select appearances on the bill in major markets."
