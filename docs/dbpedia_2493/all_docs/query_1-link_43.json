        "text": "After six years and three albums, R&B boy band B2K have split up. The group’s four members — Omarion (Omari Grandberry), Lil’ Fizz (Dreux Frederic), J-Boog (Jarell Houston) and Raz (DeMario Thornton) — cited internal disagreements for the split.\n\n“We’ve had a great run together making hit songs, albums and now movies,” manager Chris Stokes said. “The kids are growing up and are interested in pursuing their own careers.”\n\nTrending\n\nThe breakup comes on the heels of the December release of You Got Served, the group’s feature film debut and its accompanying soundtrack. B2K’s recording history was brief but prolific, starting with the release of their self-titled album (which was certified gold) in 2002. A year later the quartet began to flood the market, releasing a new studio album, the platinum-certified Pandemonium!, as well as a pair of remix albums and a handful of EPs and singles."
