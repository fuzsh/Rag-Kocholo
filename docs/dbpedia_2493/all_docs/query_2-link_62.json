        "text": "Lil’ Fizz is an American actor and rapper who sings rap, hip hop and R&B. His birth name is Dreux Pierre Frédéric and he was born on November 26, 1985 in New Orleans, Louisiana. He later moved to Los Angeles, California, where he pursued his career in music. He had been interested in music since he was a child and knew he wanted to be a rapper when he grow up. In 1998, he started a boy band by the name of “B2K” which stands for “Boys of the New Millennium”. The band was named thus due to the fact that the start of the new millennium was the time that they started making music. The original group members included Lil’ Fizz, J-Boog (Jarell Damonte Houston), and Raz-B (De’Mario Monte Thornton). In 1999, they added another member to the group, that is, Omarion (Omari Ishmael Grandberry).\n\nThe group first appeared in the rapper Bow Wow’s video for his song called “Ghetto Girls” and also served as the opening act on his tour (named “Scream Tour I). In 2001, the band released their first single titled “Uh Huh” which was a dance number and became a popular hit. The album’s other singles included “Gots Ta Be” and “Why I Love You”. Their self titled album “B2K” was released on March 12, 2002 and reached #2 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs albums chart. The album was certified Gold, and following its release, the band performed at concerts such as a special concert held for Nickelodeon in July 2002. They also started getting exposure around this time and were featured in entertainment magazines such as “Word Up” and “Right On”.\n\nLil’ Fizz, along with B2K, accompanied rapper Bow Wow on his second tour titled “Scream Tour II” which also featured other artists such as TG4 and IMx. In December 2002, the band released a special Christmas album as well as their second studio album titled “Pandemonium!”. This album featured collaborations with several artists such as P. Diddy, Makeba Riddick, Romeo and Jhene. When it was released, it entered the charts at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and No. 3 on Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums Charts. The lead single from the album was “Bump, Bump, Bump” which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, making it their first Top 10 and first No. 1 single. Another song “Girlfriend” also ranked well on the charts. The music video for this song featured prominent celebrities such as Will Smith, Vivica A. Fox, Flex Alexander, Ronald Isley, and Jennifer Freeman.\n\nIn 2003, Lil’ Fizz was featured as a member of a dance crew in the film “You Got Served” along with his fellow band members from B2K. The group spilt up shortly afterwards, due to differences between the band members and their manager Chris Stokes. Lil’ Fizz then launched his solo career. His debut album was titled “Payday” and it was released on July 17, 2007. It was available to download as a digital version on iTunes. In 2009, he teamed up with J-Boog from B2K to release a 5 track album titled “Night Life” which was again released for download on iTunes. The album was launched under the umbrella of a new record label launched by Lil’ Fizz and J-Boog, named “Popular Entertainment”.\n\nLil’ Fizz is currently working on new material for his upcoming albums. He has a son named Kamron David Frédéric with his ex-girlfriend Moniece Slaughter, who is also a rapper and R&B artist."
