        "text": "B2K singer DeMario “Raz B” Thornton is quitting the R&B group’s reunion tour after less than a week, citing concerns about his personal safety.\n\n“Raz B is officially off the tour,” he announced in a video posted early Wednesday morning. \"I don’t feel safe because I feel like Chris Stokes is around. So guess what? I’m off the tour. Good luck to everybody. No disrespect to [Omarion] because he’s my brother. [Omarion] if you want to come talk to me and you want me to do the tour, I’ll do the tour, but I’m officially off the tour.”\n\nAccording to Hot New Hip-Hop, Raz B accused former B2K manager Chris Stokes in 2007 of molesting him a decade earlier when he was 11 or 12 years old. Raz’s brother, Ricardo “Ricky Romantic” Thornton, also accused Stokes of sexual abuse.\n\n“Oh, guess what? I guess we’re about to shoot the new ‘Surviving Chris Stokes’ movie, right? So call Lifetime 'cause I’m ready to talk,\" Raz added Wednesday morning, referencing Lifetime’s recent “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary that led to multiple sex abuse charges against singer R. Kelly.\n\nRaz B recently reunited with B2K members Omarion, Lil Fizz, J-Boog for the “Millenium Tour.” The group, best known for songs “Bump Bump Bump” and “Uh-Huh,” is celebrating hits of the early 2000s with special guests Mario, Pretty Ricky, Bobby V, Chingy, Ying Yang Twins, and Lloyd.\n\nB2K and the rest of the performers are scheduled for a concert tomorrow (Thursday, March 14) at the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester. It’s unclear if Raz B’s departure will affect the show, the tour’s sole stop in Upstate New York.\n\nStokes, also known for directing the films “House Party 4” and “You Got Served,” formed B2K in 1998 and managed the young boy band along with R&B group Immature and singer-actor Marques Houston. He also created the Christopher Brian fashion line that featured Kim Kardashian and was sold in her Dash store.\n\nStokes denied abusing Raz B in 2007 and again in December when B2K reunited.\n\n“Negativity I will never play into,” Stokes tweeted. “I never hurt any of B2K & Always had their best interest at heart including financially. I forgive any negative energy or tweets! God forgives and so do I. They back! Now stay positive in 2019 & Go get your tix! Enjoy them being back! Much love!”\n\nOmarion has not commented on Raz B’s departure. MTV reported in 2007 that Omarion, who left B2K in 2004 to start a solo career, accused the Thornton brothers of “lying” about Stokes.\n\n“Chris is a father figure to myself and many others in the industry,\" Omarion said at the time. \"He’s guided us, helped raised us and is nothing more than an inspiration and someone I respect and look up to. I have spent countless hours, days, weeks and months with the man — since the age of 5 — and have never once seen him behave inappropriately. He’s married to my aunt, and I know this man very well. I stand behind him with no question whatsoever. I have grown up around Chris, and this is crazy to me. These people have damaged me and my reputation. I won’t stand silent and will do all within my means to speak the truth about this matter.”"
