If you could, which B2K song would you erase from everyone's memory?\n\nRaz-B sparked a debate with his decision, because some of the other members didn't agree. See which song is getting bump, bump, BUMPED:\n\nRaz-B\n\nOmarion\n\nJ-Boog\n\n2. If you had to give each member of the group a superlative, like \"Class Clown\" or \"Most Likely to Succeed,\" what would they be?\n\nLil' Fizz\n\n~And that's when things began to heat up~\n\nUnhappy with Fizz's selection, Omarion and J-Boog decided to pick their own superlatives.\n\n3. Who's the worst dancer of the group?\n\nLuckily, they were all able to come to an agreement for this one.\n\nIt looks like their bond hasn't changed one bit. To see more of the hilarious things we talked about, be sure to watch my full Burning Questions interview with B2K.\n\nShare This Article"
