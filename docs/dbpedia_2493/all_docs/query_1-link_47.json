        "text": "Singer/rapper/actor Drake hasn’t finalized his highly-anticipated major label deal yet, but friend and collaborator Omarion, who appeared on Drake’s popular “So Far Gone” mixtape, has found a label home. Omarion has signed to Lil Wayne’s Young Money imprint, becoming Drake’s labelmate.\n\nSpeculation about the signing started when fellow singer, Tyrese, posted a Twitter message several days ago congratulating him on his new deal. Omarion took to his own Twitter page just yesterday and confirmed that he is indeed signed to Young Money.\n\nOmarion’s last album, 2007’s “Face Off,” the collaborative project with Bow Wow, has sold 365,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The one-time B2K member was formerly on T.U.G./Sony Urban Music/Epic."
