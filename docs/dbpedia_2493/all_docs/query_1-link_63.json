With a mixture of contemporary dance-pop covers and popular Y2K songs, including “Waiting For Tonight” (JLo) and “Touch It” (Monifah), the EP is a celebration of queerness and pop culture, which is the heart of BOY2K’s music.\n\nFusing house, techno, nu-disco, and pop music, BOY2K is committed to making people move and think about the world. Their self-described “resistance music” addresses a wide range of topics, including technology, social media, sexuality, and more. The upcoming EP, B2K, is heavily inspired by the club scene and is made for anyone who loves to dance and be in the moment, feeling enigmatic and worldly."
