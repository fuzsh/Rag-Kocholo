After Lifetime’s Surviving R.Kelly documentary has rocked the entertainment business, Omarion felt moved to provide his stance on R. Kelly specifically when it comes to songs he and his group members sing.\n\n“I haven’t seen but felt compelled to voice my position on this very serious issue since #rkelly has written songs for #B2K,” Omarion tweeted. “EVERYONE has to be RESPONSIBLE. Many have bared witness to the unthinkable and yet have remained silent.”\n\nOmarion goes on to state that while he knows it will disappoint some fans those selections will be excluded from the set. That means “Bump, Bump, Bump,” “What a Girl Wants” and “Girlfriend” will no longer be performed.\n\nYou can see the complete messages from Omarion below."
