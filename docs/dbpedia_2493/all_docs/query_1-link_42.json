        "text": "After much speculation, rapper and entrepreneur Rick Ross announced today (May 2) that he has signed singer/actor Omarion to his growing label Maybach Music Group (MMG). The announcement took place at a press-conference at NYC’s Eventi Hotel. Press and label reps were present to welcome the MMG’s newly proclaimed “Maybach O” to the label which is also home to Meek Mill, Wale, Teedra Moss, and others.\n\nOmarion has been a solo artist for nearly a decade, releasing three albums, ‘O,’ ’21,’ and ‘Face Off,’ a collabo album with rapper Bow Wow. Omarion was signed briefly with Lil Wayne’s Young Money in 2009, but soon left reportedly due to business concerns.\n\nThe new MMG member released his mixtape The Awakening in May 2011.\n\nIt’s official – Omarion is now in the Maybach Music family. The multi-platinum R&B singer recently announced that he has joined Rick Ross’ record label, making him one of its newest members. This collaboration marks an exciting new chapter for both artists and fans alike.\n\nOmarion’s career began at a young age when he rose to fame as part of the popular music group B2K. Since then, his solo albums have gained international recognition with hits like “Touch”, “Ice Box” and “Post To Be”. He also starred on VH1’s “Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood” which added to his success. Now, teaming up with Rick Ross will bring even more attention to Omarion’s already successful career.\n\nRick Ross founded Maybach Music Group in 2009 and it has since become home to some of today’s hottest hip hop stars such as Wale and Meek Mill. As a member of this illustrious crew, you can be sure that Omarion will continue to make waves in the music industry. With this powerful union between two major forces in the game, only time will tell what amazing things they’ll accomplish together!\n\nOmarion’s Career History\n\nOmarion has been in the music business for some time now. His career began back in 2004 when he rose to fame as part of the group B2K and went on to release his solo debut album, O, a year later. Since then, Omarion has achieved success with multiple hit singles, albums and tours around the world; even earning himself five Grammy nominations along the way.\n\nRecently however, Omarion took an unexpected turn by joining forces with Rick Ross’ Maybach Music Group label earlier this year. The move was highly anticipated by fans who have been following his career since its inception and it’s certainly paying off for him so far. With several collaborations released already featuring Omarion alongside other MMG artists like Wale and Meek Mill, there’s no doubt that this is just the beginning of a very successful partnership between him and Rick Ross.\n\nIn addition to being signed to one of hip-hop’s biggest labels, Omarion also recently announced plans to embark on his own tour next spring – something that would never have happened had it not been for his association with Maybach Music Group. It looks like we can expect great things from Omarion in 2020!\n\nMaybach Music Group Overview\n\nMaybach Music Group (MMG) is a record label founded by Rick Ross in 2009, which has since become one of hip-hop’s most successful imprints. It was created to showcase some of the industry’s top talent and has certainly achieved that goal with artists like Wale, Meek Mill and now Omarion as part of its roster. On top of this, MMG also serves as an umbrella company for other ventures such as Maybach Films, Maybach Books and even their own clothing line.\n\nOne thing that makes MMG stand out from other labels is the family atmosphere it provides for its members. There are frequent collaborations between various signees on projects like Self Made Volumes 1 & 2, creating a team environment that helps bring everyone closer together and push each other to make better music. This sense of comradery among the label’s stars has been instrumental in driving its success over the years; something that Omarion will be lucky enough to experience firsthand now he’s joined forces with them.\n\nOmarion is sure to benefit greatly from being part of MMG – both musically and financially – so fans should definitely keep an eye out for what else might come out of his partnership with Rick Ross’ iconic label moving forward.\n\nConclusion\n\nI. Summary of Omarion’s Career\n\nOmarion has been a successful musician for several years now, with his career beginning in 2004 when he released his first album ‘O’ and reaching its peak with the release of Billboard 200 chart-topping albums such as ‘21’ and ‘Face Off’. His success has continued through collaborations with other artists, most recently becoming a member of Rick Ross’ Maybach Music Group.\n\nII. Overview of Maybach Music Group\n\nMaybach Music Group is an American record label founded by rapper Rick Ross in 2009.
