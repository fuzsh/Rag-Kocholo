        "text": "Whether you've been following Omarion since his B2K days or just got put onto him during his current reign with Maybach Music Group, the 29-year-old singer has given fans a bunch of hits throughout his career. In Complex TV's new epsiode of #TBT, Maybach O goes through his impressive catalog.\n\nOne of Omarion's first hits was \"Gots ta Be\" with his former group B2K. The video for the song helped push its popularity along, which the singer says featured a 'Beatles vibe.' \"This is really a part of us implementing the young Beatles vibe. Like the fans and them going crazy over us and everything,\" he says. \"We always thought we were superstars, especially at this age.\"\n\nOmarion also talks about gaining wisdom from Puffy during the video shoot for \"Bump, Bump, Bump,\" which became B2K's first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100. He later branched out as a solo artist in 2005, with \"O\" being the lead single from his album by the same name. Fans may remember the sexy bedroom scene that took place in the video. According to Omarion, he got a little too excited during the shoot. Good thing his leading lady was a pro.\n\nWatch the full episode of #TBT above, where Omarion also talks about the video for \"Ice Box\" and his friendship with Solange. Be on the lookout for his MMG debut album Sex Playlist, which is scheduled to come out later this year."
