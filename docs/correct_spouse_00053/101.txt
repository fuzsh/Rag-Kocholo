Sandra Bullock is welcoming her ex-husband, Jesse James, to Texas, saying the pair has moved past the ugly breakup that followed revelations of Jamesâ€™ affairs. "I support Jesse in his move to Austin," Bullock tells People magazine in a new cover story out Wednesday. "We have both moved on with our lives and only want the best for each other. Anything else that is said on my behalf is inaccurate." Bullock finalized her adoption of Louis, her 8-month-old son, in New Orleans last week. James has been seen with Kat Von D., star of LA Ink, in Las Vegas.
