        "text": "Less than a year after actress Sandra Bullock and Jesse James split when news of James' lurid affairs hit the press, he revealed he is ready to walk down the aisle again and is engaged to \"LA Ink\" star Kat Von D, People magazine reported.\n\nJames, 41, called his fiancee, the tattooed redhead whose real name is Katherine von Drachenberg, an \"amazing woman who stood behind me when the world turned their backs.\"\n\n\"My love for her is beyond description. So honored that she said 'yes.' Growing old with her is going to be a blast!\" the motorcycle mogul added about his 28-year-old love, whom he began dating last summer.\n\nJames' five-year marriage to Bullock, 46, ended when his affair with tattooed stripper Michelle \"Bombshell\" McGee was revealed shortly after Bullock won an Academy Award in March for her role in \"The Blind Side.\"\n\nOther women also came forward to divulge their trysts with the host of the reality TV show \"Monster Garage.\" James and Bullock finalized their divorce in June. His marriage to Kat Von D will be his fourth.\n\nThe bride was previously married to tattoo artist Oliver Peck, but they divorced in 2007. After her divorce, she dated Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx from 2008 to January 2010. Sixx was most recently linked with Charlie Sheen's ex-wife Denise Richards."
