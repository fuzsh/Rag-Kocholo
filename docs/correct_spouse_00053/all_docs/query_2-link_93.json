        "text": "March 19, 2010&#151; -- When girl-next-door Sandra Bullock married tattooed biker Jesse James in 2005, they seemed an unlikely pair.\n\nShe was \"Miss Congeniality,\" a popular, well-paid Hollywood actress. He was a reformed bad boy turned successful businessman and reality TV star.\n\nBut the couple seemed to prove naysayers wrong, finding domestic bliss in Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, while raising James' three children from his two previous marriages.\n\n\"He's gotten over the wildness and I'm the wild one now!\" Bullock was quoted saying in People magazine in 2006.\n\n\"Obviously we know Jesse James has a colorful past,\" E! gossip columnist Marc Malkin told ABCNews.com. \"But all things indicated that he was so happily married. He had settled into this nice life as her husband. The guy was crying when she won her Oscar.\"\n\n\"Was he crying for Sandra?\" Malkin wondered. \"Or was he thinking, 'Oh God, this is going to come out?'\""
