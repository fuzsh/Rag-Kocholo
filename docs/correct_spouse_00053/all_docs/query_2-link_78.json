        "text": "Sandra Bullock knew about Jesse James’ engagement to Kat Von D before he announced it. The Blind Side actress split from the motorcycle entrepreneur in March last year after he had an affair with tattoo model Michelle 'Bombshell' McGee and friends say he warned his former wife about his impending nuptials to avoid upsetting her.\n\nA source told website PopEater: \"It may seem like only yesterday that Jesse and Sandra split, but for her, life has changed so much, that it seems like ages ago. Sandra knew it was coming, and she was ready.\"\n\nMeanwhile it has been revealed tattoo artist Kat’s ring was designed by jeweller Neil Lane – who also created Sandra’s wedding ring – and is a four-carat platinum and diamond ring. He told People magazine: “It’s a beautiful ring set with a central round diamond in the middle with smaller surrounding diamonds for an overall dome shape. It has a delicate filigree pattern with very pretty scroll-work.”\n\nJesse – whose divorce from Sandra was finalised last June - revealed his happiness at the engagement yesterday. He said: “2010 was actually the best year of my life because I fell in love with my best friend. An amazing woman who stood behind me when the world turned their backs.\n\nWhile some people have questioned his tact, this is not the first time 41-year-old Jesse has hinted his marriage to Sandra was not entirely happy. Writing on his blog in December, he said: “From a distance I appeared to have it all, beautiful wife, Amazing kids, Awesome home, but if you got close enough to really see me? I was empty inside. My spirit and soul were gone.”"
