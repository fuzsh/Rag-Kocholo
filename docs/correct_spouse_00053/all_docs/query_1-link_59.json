        "text": "Bryan Randall, who has been Sandra Bullock’s partner since 2015, died Saturday, August 5 at the age of 57, his family said. His cause of death was complications related to ALS, which he’d struggled with for three years and chose not to reveal publicly.\n\n\"Bryan chose early to keep his journey with ALS private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honor his request,” a statement from his family reads. “We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours.”\n\nBullock, 59, met Randall when he photographed her son Louis’ birthday party in January 2015. Randall was a model before he shifted career paths into photography.\n\nBullock was previously married to Jesse James; the two divorced in 2010 after five years of marriage. In a 2021 interview on Red Table Talk, Bullock said that she didn’t “need a paper to be a devoted partner and devoted mother,” discussing Randall and whether they’d ever marry. \"I don't need to be told to be ever present in the hardest of times. I don't need to be told to weather a storm with a good man. So if that's what you have.... Think about what kind of parent he would be. Think about what kind of parent you would be. And what if something happened? Would you both be great parents to those children even if you didn't make it as a couple. Think about the children first.”\n\nBullock and Randall co-parented three children together: Louis, now 13, Laila, 10, and Randall’s daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nIn 2022, Bullock told CBS’ Sunday Morning that she’d be taking a hiatus from acting, citing a desire to be at home with her family.\n\n“I want to be at home,” she said. “I’m not doing anyone any favors who’s investing in a project if I’m saying, ‘I just want to be at home.’ ’Cause I was always running, I was always running to the next thing. I just want to be present and responsible for one thing.”\n\nBullock’s sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, shared a remembrance of Randall on Instagram on Monday, calling ALS a “cruel disease.”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n“I’m convinced that Bry has found the best fishing spot in heaven and is already casting his lure into rushing rivers teaming with salmon,” she wrote alongside a smiling photo of Randall.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon’s Ser Simon Strong Is “The Only Gentleman in an Ungentlemanly World”\n\nAs violence abounds in Westeros, Rhaenyra arranges a secret meeting with Alicent and tries to broker some kind of peace. Plus, Simon Russell Beale drops by Still Watching to discuss the introduction of his new character, the Lord of Harrenhal.\n\nBusiness\n\n“I’m Not Naive”: Inside Emma Tucker’s Rocky Wall Street Journal Reboot\n\nThe British-born editor has injected America’s business paper of record with ambition and verve, while unnerving the newsroom with unapologetic cuts. The restructuring “may look callous,” she says. “But it’s so that we get it right, so I don’t have to do it over again.”\n\nStyle\n\nAt Le Sirenuse, Vacationing Is a Work of Art\n\nAll great hotels have top-notch service and ritzy clientele. But how many have a Nicolas Party at the bottom of the pool?\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Bear Season 4: Everything We Know\n\nThe show’s unprecedented use of “to be continued” begs several questions, one of them being: Are we getting new episodes of The Bear sooner than expected?"
