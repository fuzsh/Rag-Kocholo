        "text": "Sandra Bullock and Jesse James have a prenuptial agreement that states he gets no money in a divorce if he cheats during the marriage, RadarOnline reports.\n\nWhile James is financially successful on his own, Bullock, who just won a best-actress Oscar for “The Blind Side,” earns top dollar. Her fortune is far bigger than his, sources told RadarOnline.\n\n“If she divorces Jesse and proves he was cheating, which won’t be hard, Sandra won’t have to pay Jesse anything,” a source familiar with the situation told the website.\n\nJames has been linked sexually to four other women and reportedly told his wife that he was involved with seven women in total.\n\nJames has been undergoing sex rehab at Sierra Tucson in Arizona and a friend and lawyer describe him as a “broken man.”\n\nBullock is said to be drawing up divorce papers with a lawyer.\n\nEven at 68, looks like Bob Dylan is still considered a subversive threat in China.\n\nThe former protest singer canceled concerts in Hong Kong and South Korea after the Chinese government refused to grant him a permit to perform.\n\nDylan, who reportedly was looking forward to his first performance in mainland China, was due to sing in Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nJeffrey Wu, the head of operations of Dylan’s promoter Brokers Brothers Herald, said: ‘China’s Ministry of Culture did not give us permission to stage concerts in Beijing and Shanghai, so we had no alternative but to scrap plans for a South East Asian tour.’\n\nWu added that the ‘chance to play in China was the main attraction for him (Dylan). When that fell through, everything else was called off,’ London’s Daily Mail reports.\n\nThe South East Asian dates were to come off the back of a string of performances in Japan as part of his Never Ending Tour.\n\nDylan, who performs 100 concerts a year, may have been refused because of the controversy caused by Icelandic singer Björk in China in 2008.\n\nAfter singing Declare Independence at a concert in Shanghai she chanted ‘Tibet! Tibet!’\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt visited Bosnia on Monday to spotlight the plight of 117,000 people who have not able to return to their homes, 15 years after the end of the Bosnia war.\n\nAnd they did so under the radar. There were no reported media sightings of the celebrity couple.\n\nThe two arrived Sunday evening, said Aida Prljaca, the spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo.\n\nJolie, who has been a UNHCR ambassador since 2001, will visit projects meant to help Bosnians who cannot return home, either because their homes have not been rebuilt or the infrastructure in their villages has not been repaired.\n\nSome 7,000 people live in dozens of refugee centers throughout the country. The other 110,000 live primarily with relatives or in rented housing.\n\nJolie is currently filming “The Tourist” with Johnny Depp in Italy.\n\nDennis Hopper’s estranged wife and daughter can live on his property while the couple resolve their bitter divorce case and the actor fights prostate cancer, a judge ruled Monday.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Amy Pellman also ordered the actor to pay $12,000 a month in spousal and child support.\n\nHopper, 73, did not attend the hearing but was repeatedly described by his attorney as “desperately ill.”\n\nHopper’s adult children attended but did not speak. Pellman sternly told both sides they needed to come together during what appeared to be Hopper’s final days. “It’s never one-sided,” Pellman said of the family turmoil. “There needs to be street-cleaning on both sides of this street.”\n\nThe judge noted the couple’s 7-year-old daughter is about to undergo the traumatic loss of her father and the rhetoric should be toned down.\n\n“Having her extended family in a war with her mother is not in her best interests,” Pellman said. The rulings came after two months of bickering in court filings, including allegations of abuse by both sides, and jockeying for financial position.\n\nThe couple has been married for nearly 14 years. Hopper filed for divorce in January. “It’s heartbreaking and I hope it can be amicably resolved,” Victoria Duffy Hopper said after the hearing.\n\nShe has been living in a house at her husband’s Venice compound, which is also home to one of his adult children. She has agreed to remain at least 10 feet away from the “Easy Rider” star and avoid the main home on the property. She said in court filings the divorce was an attempt to cut her out of her inheritance, an accusation that has been denied.\n\nHopper’s attorney, Joseph Mannis, said after the hearing that he was happy with the outcome, aside from the judge awarding Victoria Hopper $200,000 in attorney and accountant fees.\n\nHe said his side did not intend to further contest the spousal or child support orders but was preparing for a fight over the couple’s prenuptial agreement. The agreement calls for Victoria Hopper to lose her stake in her husband’s estate if they are divorced or not living together when he dies.\n\nAnother hearing on how to divide Hopper’s life insurance policy will be held in May.\n\n— The Associated Press also contributed to this report\n\nlsmith@denverpost.com\n\nMore celebrity headlines"
