        "text": "Sandra Bullock has had her share of great loves, just like the characters in her charming romantic movies.\n\nThe Oscar winner seemed to find her lifelong match in Jesse James, whom she wed in July 2005. However, they divorced in June 2010 after multiple women came forward in March claiming they'd had affairs with James. He later admitted to the infidelity during a 2011 appearance on ABC News.\n\nBullock and James had begun the adoption process for son Louis in January 2010, but Bullock finished the process as a single parent after their split. She also went on to adopt daughter Laila in December 2015.\n\nAfter becoming a mother, the actress moved on with Bryan Randall in 2015. Randall died at age 57 in August 2023 after a private three-year battle with ALS. News of his death came days after Us Weekly confirmed that he and Bullock were in a \"cooling-off period\" after spending time apart.\n\nScroll down to revisit Bullock’s dating history:"
