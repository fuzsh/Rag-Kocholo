        "text": "Jesse James, the estranged husband of movie star Sandra Bullock, has given his first interview since news broke in March of his infidelity.\n\n\"I took a pretty amazing life and amazing success and marriage â€¦ and threw it away by my own hands,\" the motorcycle maker and TV reality show star told ABC's Nightline, which released some clips from the interview on Friday.\n\nJames, 41, admits he cheated on Bullock, his wife of five years.\n\nOnly days after Bullock won an Oscar on March 7 for her role in The Blind Side, media reports said he had affairs with at least four women.\n\nThe 45-year-old actress filed for divorce from James in late April and recently revealed that she had adopted a New Orleans-born baby boy, named Louis Bardo Bullock, back in January.\n\nIn an interview with People magazine, Bullock said she will be raising Louis as a single parent but still hopes to remain in the lives of James's three children.\n\nThe interview with James will be broadcast on Good Morning America on May 25 and on Nightline later the same day."
