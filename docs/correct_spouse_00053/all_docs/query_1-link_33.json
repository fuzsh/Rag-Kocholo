        "text": "Who would have ever thought?\n\nLess than two weeks after taking home the best actress Oscar for her role in \"The Blind Side,\" Sandra Bullock pulled out of the film's London premiere amid tabloid reports that she is having marital troubles with husband Jesse James, according to People magazine.\n\n\"Blind Side\" star dishes on Oscar nomination and why she resisted marriage.In a statement released to People, Bullock wrote, \"Due to unforeseen personal reasons, a trip abroad to support 'The Blindside' has been deemed impossible at this time. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and thank you for your continued support of the film.\"\n\nMessages left for representatives of Bullock and James were not immediately returned.\n\nAccording to an article in In Touch magazine, a model who had hoped to work for James' company, West Coast Choppers, alleges that she had an affair with James, much of which occurred while Bullock, 45, was filming \"The Blind Side.\"\n\nJames, 40, was visibly emotional during Bullock's Oscar speech, wiping away tears and later telling the press how \"proud\" he was of his wife.\n\nThe rumors of infidelity come just a few months after James won his custody battle with his **** star ex-wife, Janine Lindemulder.\n\nlol whatever,\n\nThose pics tell a million words. Hmmm lets see, do I want a tatooed up trailer park chick, a **** star that has been ridden more times than a 100k busa, or a classy - award winning actress?\n\nAny questions? ???\n\nmaybe she's frigid\n\nedit: if he wants something else he should not have gotten married."
