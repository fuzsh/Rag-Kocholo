        "text": "In addition to losing Discovery Channel’s American Chopper: The Build-Off, Jesse James has made some fans angry over referring to ex-wife Sandra Bullock as “some Hollywood actress.”\n\nPHOTOS: 19 of Hollywood’s All-Time Shortest Marriages\n\nOn Monday’s episode, the reality star tried to appeal to fans and gain some credibility among the motorcycle community when he admitted to being caught up with his relationship with the Oscar-winning actress and the accompanying glitz.\n\n“I just became like a big shot and like married some Hollywood actress and didn’t talk to anybody anymore, so I feel bad,” he said on the show. “And I feel obligated to reconnect with all these people and show them that I’m still the same fabricator motorcycle guy. I’m not what I became.”\n\nAfter marrying in 2005, Bullock, 47, filed for divorce from James, 42, in April 2010 as reports of his multiple infidelities hit the news headlines. TLC’s LA Ink star Kat Von D confirmed she and James were dating about four months later.\n\nViewers took to their Twitter accounts to express their anger over his apparent disregard to his ex-wife. Here are several viewer reactions that were fit to print.\n\nNote: Some comments have been edited for content and grammar.\n\nangietatzDec\n\ni hate Jesse james !! He’s always attacking sandra bullock..! He’s a self-centered a–hole freak !\n\ngoombakidDec\n\nJesse James: Leeching off of others success. First Sandra, then Kat, now you lose to #PDJ. Psh, you never had it.\n\nRonnieNaviDec\n\nJesse James has no class (not that he cares) and a loser. What the heck Sandra B saw in him?\n\nnanchers\n\nJesse is so unfair to sandra, blaming her for his mistake, by dishing his fans. that was his fault, not to blame her for it\n\nAndreaKempfer\n\nDoes anyone actually like this man?\n\nTatianaJudith\n\nHe’s a pig…\n\nradron\n\nJesse James is so cocky and that is another reason a awesome person like Sandra left him she was too good for him\n\nJMethenyJr\n\nPitching a new show to Discovery starring Jesse.. will call it Sandra Bullock’s Garage.\n\nWhat’s your take on James’ reference to Bullock? Tell us in the comments section below."
