        "text": "(CNN) -- The custody clash between Jesse James and ex-wife Janine Lindemulder over their 5-year-old isn't over, but James says his current wife isn't part of it.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, James' attorney said that \"the statements made on 'Good Morning America' earlier this week about the ongoing custody case between Mr. James and Ms. Lindemulder were inaccurate and unfortunate. Sandra Bullock is not a party to this litigation.\"\n\nThe battle for custody began after Lindemulder was released from a brief prison sentence for tax evasion.\n\nIn an October 13 letter to the judge presiding over the custody case obtained by CNN, Lindemulder wrote that she and her daughter were \"eager to get back to a normal, healthy, loving life.\"\n\nLindemulder, who has an admitted history of drug use, was granted visitation rights on Sundays, provided she didn't consume any drugs or alcohol and ensured there was no contact between her daughter, Sunny, and her new husband, felon Jeremy Aikman.\n\nOn October 29, James returned to court with allegations that Lindemulder had not kept their daughter away from Aikman, according to Access Hollywood.\n\nThe following Wednesday, Lindemulder appeared in an interview on \"Good Morning America\" denouncing Bullock and James' earlier allegations that she was an unfit parent. The couple wrote separate letters at the time of Lindemulder's legal woes late last year expressing their concern for Sunny's well-being and safety when she was with Lindemulder.\n\n\"I am the best mother I can be,\" she said during the interview Wednesday, although she admitted to making \"horrific choices in the past.\"\n\nNonetheless, Lindemulder added, \"Sandy doesn't know what goes on in my house.\"\n\nThe former Penthouse model said she would like to sit down with Bullock and talk about the issue as \"two women.\"\n\n\"It hurts tremendously,\" Lindemulder continued. \"The accusations, especially from Sandra ... because we've never sat down and talked. That's the one thing that I wish more than anything, for a remedy for what's happening here, is just communication.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether or not Lindemulder will get her wish, as it looks like James wants this battle to stay in a court of law.\n\n\"Mr. James's sole concern is for the safety, welfare and best interests of his daughter,\" his attorney said in the statement. \"The proper forum to resolve this case is in the courtroom.\""
