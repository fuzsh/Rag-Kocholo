        "text": "Sandra Bullock's ex Jesse James has been accused of cheating by his pregnant wife Bonnie Rotten in an explosive Instagram rant.\n\nFormer adult entertainer Bonnie has taken aim at the West Coast Choppers reality TV star, 53, as she branded him a \"disgusting human being\" in a now-deleted post.\n\nThe couple, who are expecting their first child together, tied the knot in an intimate Texas backyard ceremony in June earlier this year.\n\nJesse and Bonnie, his fifth bride, appeared happier than ever as the newly-wed pair enjoyed their Florida Keys honeymoon in August.\n\nHowever, just months later Bonnie has accused Jesse of \"trying to f**k other women\" while she's 10 weeks pregnant.\n\nBonnie also claimed that husband James has blocked her on social media, but is still following his ex and other girls on his Instagram.\n\nTaking to her own Instagram Story in a series of explosive posts, Bonnie said: \"I see his page he's following his ex and a bunch of girls.\n\n\"I’m his pregnant wife and he chooses to act like this. THAT’S NOT A MAN. I’m so hurt by everything he has done to me. He doesn’t give a f*** about anyone but himself.\n\n\"He’s a truly disgusting human being. I do not like putting this s**t on social media but it’s the only way he will feel anything is if everyone knows WHAT HE TRULY IS.\"\n\nShe spoke of those who 'warned her' about James, who famously cheated on his famous ex-wife Sandra Bullock, leading to their divorce in 2010.\n\nBonnie posted: \"Everyone can laugh at me make fun of me whatever you want to say. Nothing will make me feel worse than how I truly feel right now.\"\n\n\"I should've known better you're all right,\" she added.\n\nJesse and Sandra were together from 2003 to 2010 and it was in 2005 that the former couple tied the knot before adopting their first child Louis.\n\nFollowing their divorce, Sandra told The Independent: \"My life took a trajectory that wasn’t very pleasant, but I feel like it had to happen in order for me to fully understand what family was about.\"\n\nAt the time, Jesse told The Hollywood Reporter: \"I got divorced and lost a kid I adopted because of it. Whether that’s fair, whether I should have lost a kid due to infidelity, which I don’t think anybody ever does. But I think with 'Hollywood Law' that’s totally fair.\"\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Jesse's representatives for a comment.\n\nBonnie's posts come after the couple shared gushing posts following their small wedding ceremony earlier this year, complete with loving captions.\n\nJesse posted pictures at the time, alongside the caption: \"1 Corinthians 16:14. Let all that you do be done in love. Greatest day ever yesterday!\"\n\nBonnie wrote: \"6.25.22 I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. Yesterday was the most magical day.\"\n\nIn another post she said: \"I am so thankful to have those close to us join us for our day of love.\"\n\n\"All the planets were aligned, figuratively and literally. I found my soul mate. I won't be letting him go,\" she added. \"Mr and Mrs James.\""
