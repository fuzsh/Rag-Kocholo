        "text": "Sandra Bullock and Jesse James have reportedly finalized their divorce after five years of marriage after it was revealed that he had cheated on her with a bevy of chicks, according to a new report.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actress and the bimbo-chasing, bad boy biker signed the final documents last week, TMZ.com reported today.\n\nSealed documents were filed with the clerk’s office in Travis County, Texas, with TMZ reporting that the paperwork made the divorce final.\n\nBullock filed for divorce on April 23, saying the marriage “has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities.”\n\nThe 45-year-old Tinseltown beauty — who won the Best Actress Oscar in March, only to find out days later her husband was cheating — later revealed she had adopted a baby boy, Louie.\n\nJames, 41, checked into a rehabilitation center after weeks of reports that he cheated on Bullock throughout their marriage, but later left the Sierra Tucson center in Arizona.\n\nBullock’s seemingly perfect five-year marriage was shattered when tattooed stripper Michelle “Bombshell” McGee revealed that she and James had been having a torrid affair.\n\nAfter McGee revealed that she had bedded James, other women came forward with similar tales."
