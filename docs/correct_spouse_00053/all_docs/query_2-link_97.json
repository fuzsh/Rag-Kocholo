        "text": "Austin star graces magazine’s October cover\n\nNEW YORK — It’s been three years since Austin’s Sandra Bullock split from her husband Jesse James but she has no desire to go backward and examine what happened, especially not publicly.\n\nDays after Bullock won the Best Actress Oscar for “The Blind Side,” tabloids reported James had cheated on her. Paparazzi flooded to Austin to cover the story.\n\nShe reacted swiftly, by going under the radar and filing for divorce.\n\nNow she tells Vogue, “We’re all where we’re supposed to be” and “I’m grateful that I’m here, blessed to have what I have.”\n\nWhat Bullock has is a three-year-old son named Louis who she adopted in January 2010, in the middle of awards season. She managed to keep him a secret for the first few months of his life.\n\nVogue’s Oct. issue goes on sale Sept. 24. This fall Bullock stars in “Gravity,” with George Clooney.\n\nPink recognized by Billboard\n\nNEW YORK — Billboard has named Pink its woman of the year.\n\nBillboard announced Monday that the pop singer will receive the honor at its annual Women in Music event Dec. 10 in New York City.\n\nPink’s sixth album, “The Truth About Love,” has sold 1.7 million albums since it was released last year. It launched three Top 10 hits, including the No. 1 jam “Just Give Me a Reason.”\n\nPast recipients of Billboard’s woman of the year award include Beyonce, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift.\n\nPink is currently on her international “The Truth About Love Tour.” She comes to San Antonio Nov. 14 and Dallas Nov. 16."
