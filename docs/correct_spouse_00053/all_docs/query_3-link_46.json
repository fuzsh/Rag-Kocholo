        "text": "She's not an actor who is known to stir up much controversy, but in 2010 Sandra Bullock was in the middle of a scandal thanks to her husband at the time, Jesse James. Five years into his marriage to Bullock, multiple women came forward claiming that they'd had affairs with James. The Oscar winner and Monster Garage host divorced soon after those affairs came to light. Since then, Bullock's ex has addressed his infidelity, including calling cheating \"part of life.\"\n\nRead on to find out more about the dramatic end to Bullock and James' whirlwind romance and to see what they've both said about his affairs.\n\nREAD THIS NEXT: Kristen Stewart Said She \"Lit Her Universe on Fire\" When She Cheated on Robert Pattinson.\n\nBullock and James were married for five years.\n\nBullock and James got married in 2005. It was the first marriage for Bullock and the third for James, who also had three children from those previous relationships.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n\nIn a 2006 interview with Vanity Fair, Bullock explained that they met when she took her godson, who was a fan of James and his show, to visit the set of Monster Garage. From there, James began pursuing Bullock via email. She said that she was apprehensive at first but that he won her over.\n\n\"I went, 'Wow.' I didn't think he'd like jazz or classical music,\" Bullock told the magazine. \"So basically through a courtship of letters, which I didn't even recognize, I learned about a human being. It was not something I wanted, needed, or looked for, but because he was a stronger person than I was, spiritually and on a tolerance level, I was lucky enough that he educated me.\"\n\nSeveral women accused James of cheating.\n\nIn 2010, multiple women claimed publicly that they'd had affairs with James during his marriage to Bullock. People reported on four women who had come forward, including one who said that their affair continued until the news of the other affairs came out. Another woman said she wasn't sure if he was married at the time.\n\nAfter this, James released an apology. In a statement to People, he called the \"vast majority of the allegations … untrue and unfounded,\" but continued, \"There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me. It's because of my poor judgment that I deserve everything bad that is coming my way.\" He also said that he hoped one day Bullock and his children would \"find it in their hearts to forgive [him].\"\n\nFor more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nBullock was simultaneously having one of the best years of her career.\n\nWhile her family life was being blown up, Bullock was thriving in her professional life. Amid the scandal, she cancelled appearances to promote her movie, The Blind Side, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Also after the news broke, James entered a treatment facility for \"personal issues\" for 30 days.\n\nBullock filed for divorce from James a month after the claims were made public. As reported by People, when she shared that she had filed for divorce, she also revealed that she adopted a son, Louis. Bullock and James had been looking into adopting a child together, but when they split up, Bullock continued on with the adoption process on her own.\n\nJames later said he \"wanted to get caught.\"\n\nIn 2011, James addressed his cheating in an ABC News interview. \"I knew it was horrible,\" he said. \"It made me feel horrible … I knew I would get caught eventually, and I think I wanted to get caught. It was me trying to self-sabotage my life.\"\n\nBy that time, Jesse was already in another relationship, this time with LA Ink star Kat Von D. Asked whether he thought it was hurtful to Bullock to move on so quickly, he said, \"I can't worry about her anymore. I think I've spent a good chunk of the last five or six years worrying only about her, and what she thinks, and what I should do … I think it's time to worry about Jesse and making sure Jesse's happy.\"\n\nHe said cheating was \"part of life.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah, I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that's end of story,\" James said in a 2017 interview with the Daily Mail. He also said that people still call him out for the affairs on social media. \"The easy [put down] is like, oh well you cheated on Sandra Bullock. That's the world's easiest comeback.\" He added, \"In general, both women and men cheat. It's part of life.\"\n\nJames claimed that \"a lot of good happened\" due to his marriage to the actor ending. \"[I]t helped me focus on being a dad more, it helped me focus on doing the right thing and being myself, and getting out of LA and getting a better life for my kids,\" he explained.\n\nBullock opened up about the grieving process.\n\nIn 2010, a few months after the scandal, Bullock told People, \"We have both moved on with our lives and only want the best for each other.
