        "text": "Motorcycle man Jesse James is engaged to tattoo artist Kat Von D.\n\n“It’s true,” James told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nNo wedding date has been announced.\n\nJames and Von D began dating over the summer after his very public split from Oscar-winner Sandra Bullock.\n\nThe 41-year-old biker-businessman and reality TV star called Von D his best friend. Von D, whose real name is Katherine von Drachenberg, says James is the one. The 28-year-old stars on the TLC reality show “LA Ink.”\n\nThe engagement was first reported Thursday by People.com.\n\nJames told the magazine, “2010 was actually the best year of my life because I fell in love with my best friend. An amazing woman who stood behind me when the world turned their backs.”\n\nJames and Bullock were married for five years. Their marriage collapsed amid allegations of James’ infidelity just after Bullock won an Oscar for her role in “The Blind Side” in March, 2010.\n\nJames apologized publicly to the actress and his three children from previous relationships for causing them “pain and embarrassment beyond comprehension.”\n\nHe later told ABC’s “Nightline” that he was the most hated man in the world for capping off Bullock’s career high with a deeply personal low.\n\nThe couple separated in March and their divorce was finalized in June.\n\nJames began professing his love for Von D on Twitter earlier this month, writing on Jan. 9: “I have Never Felt so Loved! I’m The Luckiest (man) in the World!”\n\nVon D posted on the micro-blogging site Thursday that she is “overwhelmed with joy.”"
