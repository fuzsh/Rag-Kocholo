        "text": "Just days after Rotten, 29, filed for divorce from James, 53, for a second time following a domestic dispute in late November, the pair has purportedly reconciled, telling the court they would be dismissing the case, per legal documents obtained by Radar Online.\n\nJESSE JAMES REQUESTS JUDGE'S PERMISSION TO PREVENT WIFE BONNIE ROTTEN FROM ENTERING HIS HOME\n\nThe actress, who is currently expecting her first child with the West Coast Choppers founder, is reportedly living back at home with her formerly-estranged husband.\n\nRotten first attempted to divorce her husband, whom she married in June, on Thursday December 1, claiming the TV personality cheated on her in a pointed Instagram post.\n\n“Yeah Jesse is busy trying to f**k other women while I’m pregnant,” the mom-to-be wrote alongside a sonogram snap posted to her Instagram account shortly before filing for divorce on Wednesday, November 30, adding that she felt \"so hurt by everything he has done to me.\"\n\n\"He didn’t give a f**k about anyone but himself he’s truly a disgusting human being,” she continued, saying that she “should’ve known better” considering James’ track record —seemingly referencing how the star famously cheated while married to actress Sandra Bullock.\n\nThough she concluded the heartfelt post by reiterating her passion for her husband — \"I love Jesse so much,\" Rotten wrote — she filed for divorce for a second time on Tuesday, December 6.\n\nJESSE JAMES' PREGNANT WIFE BONNIE ROTTEN FILES FOR DIVORCE FOR A SECOND TIME HOURS AFTER REUNITING WITH HUSBAND\n\nRotten has remained tight-lipped on her decision to stay in her marriage this time around, yet Rotten posted a cryptic quote attributed to Greek philosopher Socrates, seemingly offering a glimpse at her mindset.\n\n“Those who are the hardest to love need it the most,” read the message shared to her Story."
