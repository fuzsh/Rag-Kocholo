        "text": "(CNN) -- Oscar-winning actress Sandra Bullock has filed for divorce from Jesse James in a Texas court, saying their marriage \"has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities.\"\n\nBullock, 45, and James, 41, separated soon after she won the best actress Academy Award in March amid tabloid reports of his marital infidelity.\n\nAustin, Texas -- where Bullock owns businesses -- is a \"much better jurisdiction for her\" to file in than California because the Texas judge is allowed to consider 20 factors, including cheating, when dividing assets, said family law attorney Diane Reul.\n\nCalifornia's community property law provides for a 50-50 split, she said.\n\nJames, in a statement given to People magazine, said the divorce filing \"has left a huge hole in my heart.\"\n\n\"Sandy is the love of my life, but considering the pain and devastation I have caused her, it would be selfish to not let her go,\" he said.\n\nThe divorce petition, filed Friday in Travis County, Texas, District Court, gave few details about the 5-year-old marriage's troubles.\n\n\"The marriage between petitioner and respondent has become insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities that destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage relationship and prevents any reasonable expectations of reconciliation,\" the petition said.\n\nThe petition does not refer to the son Bullock recently acknowledged that she adopted.\n\nShe told People magazine that she adopted Louis Bardo Bullock, and infant born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in January.\n\nJames addressed the adoption in his statement to People.\n\n\"The decision to let my wife end our marriage, and continue the adoption of Louis on her own, has been the hardest,\" he said. \"The love I have for Louis cannot be put to words. Not having him around to love and to hold has left a huge hole in my heart.\"\n\nThe filing hinted that there is agreement between Bullock and James on some issues already.\n\n\"Petitioner believed that petitioner and respondent will enter into an agreement for the division of their estate,\" it said.\n\n\"My guess is under the table, they're cutting a deal,\" Reul said.\n\nBullock's filing said James -- a motorcycle designer and reality TV star from Long Beach, California -- already agreed that the divorce would be handled in Texas.\n\n\"We still might see paperwork come through where he is disputing that,\" Reul said.\n\nBullock, a Virginia native, opened a restaurant, bakery and floral shop in the Sixth Street tourist area of downtown Austin. She's also been quoted by an Austin newspaper in recent years saying the city is her \"real home.\"\n\nTexas has no state income tax, which makes property ownership a key way to show residency, Reul said.\n\nBullock's petition, filed without using their names, was titled: \"In the matter of the marriage of B.A.S. and J.J.G.\" Those letters are their initials in reverse.\n\nWhile the Bullock-James separation has given journalists plenty to write about in recent weeks, the divorce may be quieter, Reul said.\n\nTexas law allows for attorneys to keep what is said in depositions and interrogatory filings out of the public case file at the courthouse, she said: \"They exchange them privately.\""
