        "text": "In his first sit-down interview since allegations surfaced that he cheated on wife Sandra Bullock, Jesse James tells ABC’s Vicki Mabrey that he still loves the Oscar-wining actress and believed that he would get caught.\n\n“When I was doing it, you know, one, I knew it was horrible, it made me feel horrible,” James told ABC’s “Nightline” in a new clip which surfaced on Monday, of the interview which is set to air on Tuesday. “And two, I knew I would get caught eventually, and I think I wanted to get caught… It was me trying to self-sabotage my life.”\n\nWhen Mabrey asked why he would hurt his wife, James said, “It’s hard for me to talk about, a little bit, because I still really love her and care about her.”\n\n“I’ve spent my whole life with the kids and with her trying to … protect her from everything,” James continued in the clip. “But, the most hurt she’s ever been caused is by the person that wanted to protect her.”\n\nAs previously reported on AccessHollywood.com, in a previous clip of the interview released last week, James – who described himself as the “most hated man in the world” – said, “I took a pretty amazing life and marriage and threw it away.”\n\nJames’ interview came in the wake of Bullock’s People cover story last month, in which she revealed she’d adopted a son, Louis, and was filing for divorce from James.\n\nThe former couple wed in 2005."
