        "text": "Well, thank gosh she got rid of him!\n\nIn a candid new interview, Jesse James opened up about his infamous cheating scandal with his ex-wife Sandra Bullock â and fully admitted to the wrongdoing that leaked back in 2010.\n\nâYeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah, I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And thatâs end of story,â Jesse, 47, confessed to Daily Mail. âIn general, both women and men cheat. Itâs part of life.â\n\nSandra and Jesse in 2010.\n\nJesse and Sandra, 52, previously married in 2005 and split in 2010 (their divorce was finalized in 2012) after Jesse publicly blamed the split on his multiple accounts of disloyalty with other women. Many of those women came forward and admitted to the affairs.\n\nMUST SEE: Cate Blanchett Wears Her Wedding Ring Amid Husband Andrew Upton Cheating Rumors!\n\nFollowing their highly-publicized breakup, Jesse has been a victim to trolls on social media. âThe easy [put-down] is like, âOh well, you cheated on Sandra Bullock.â Thatâs the worldâs easiest comeback,â he revealed. âItâs like people love to see you fall. And the farther you get, the higher you get, the more they love it. I look at myself now and I look at how I was feeling then, and I think I was completely overreacting as far as letting it really get to me.â\n\nSandra and Jesse in March 2006.\n\nIn a previous Twitter rant, Jesse suprised fans when he suggested Sandra once cheated on him during their previous five-year-long marriage as well. âAhhh cheating goes both ways sweetie. Just because you got all teary eyed at some actress. Doesnât mean she wonât cheat on her husband,â he replied to an angry follower, who hit him with the âYou cheated on Sandra Bullockâ line. Sandra didnât comment on the matter.\n\nMORE: Sandra Bullock Reveals How Adopting Her Daughter Has Positively Changed Her Life!
