        "text": "In 2010, Jesse James went from being Sandra Bullock's husband to the subject of a shocking celebrity scandal when it was revealed he was cheating on the Oscar-winning actress. James opened up in a new interview with omg! from Yahoo! about the backlash he received from his high-profile split from Bullock, and claims he's done more than enough apologizing.\n\n\"I think I've paid the price and then some, you know? I don't know anybody anywhere that's had to endure what I had to endure for basically infidelity,\" the \"Jesse James: Outlaw Garage\" star said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames married Bullock in 2005, but their relationship crumbled in 2010 after numerous women, including Michelle \"Bombshell\" McGee, came forward claiming to have been with him. The story dominated tabloid headlines for months, and continued to grow as more women came forward alleging affairs. Almost immediately, James became one of the most-hated figures in pop culture, while Bullock remained America's sweetheart.\n\nJames issued a public apology to Bullock in March 2010, and he admitted his wrongdoing.\n\n\"It's because of my poor judgment that I deserve everything bad that is coming my way,\" he said in the statement. \"This has caused my wife and kids pain and embarrassment beyond comprehension and I am extremely saddened to have brought this on them.\"\n\nThough he apologized and owned up to cheating on Bullock, the public continued to view him in an extremely negative light, and James told omg! from Yahoo! that his actions only made his life harder.\n\n\"I stood up like a man and admitted my wrongs and what I did and all that did is make every s*** tabloid everywhere across the world come after me even harder,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis new comments on his split from Bullock echo statements he made last year on the Australian radio show \"Kyle and Jackie O Show.\"\n\n\"The only people who said negative stuff to me were the paparazzi and they were being paid to do that, \" he said about his marital drama. \"The media portrayed it as this big, huge negative thing but if anything, I got more support from everybody else, because, yes, I cheated on my wife but so do a lot of other people.\"\n\nAnd it seems Bullock wasn't the only woman James has been accused of cheating on. He was engaged to \"LA Ink\" star Kat Von D in early 2011, but the couple called it quits for good in September, with Von D claiming James cheated on her with 19 women.\n\nFor more from James, head over to omg! from Yahoo!."
