        "text": "Sandra Bullock became a Hollywood icon thanks to her unforgettable roles and incredible personality so it's no surprise she's had a fair share of great loves and rollercoaster relationships over the years. It was recently reported that her long-term partner Bryan Randall died after a secret battle with ALS.\n\nHis family confirmed the news in a heartbreaking statement. The model-turned-photographer, 57, had been battling the neurological disease in private for the last three years. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the most common form of Motor Neurone Disease and happens when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, called motor neurones, stop working properly and die prematurely.\n\nFollowing his death, his family wrote: \"It is with great sadness that we share that on Aug. 5, Bryan Randall passed away peacefully after a three-year battle with ALS. Bryan chose early to keep his journey with ALS private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honor his request.\"\n\nThey added: \"We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours. At this time we ask for privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan. His Loving Family.\"\n\nSandra, 59, met Bryan in 2015 but previously dated the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Bob Schneider, Ryan Gosling and Jesse James before she found love with Bryan.\n\nBryan Randall (2015 - 2023)\n\nThe Proposal actress Sandra met Bryan when he was a photographer at her son's birthday party in 2015. It wasn't long before they publicly confirmed their relationship. They even made an appearance at Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's wedding the same year they met.\n\nShe mostly kept her relationship with Bryan away from the spotlight but has touched on their love for each other over the years in interviews and brought him to several red-carpet events. On an episode of Red Table Talk with Jada Pinkett Smith, Sandra explained that Bryan had nothing to do with her adoption plans.\n\nSandra said: \"I had Louis first. Then when I met him, we hadn't been together that long and I said, 'Remember that NDA you signed when you photographed my son? You know that still holds … because I'm bringing home a child when I come back from Toronto'.\"\n\nThe actress recalled Bryan being both \"happy and scared\" after hearing her plans to adopt again, but she admitted that ultimately he was \"a saint\" about the situation. She said: \"He's very patient. A saint. He has evolved on a level that is not human.\"\n\nAccording to the Lost City star, Bryan was 'very Christian' and a great role model to the children. \"I don't always agree with him and he doesn't always agree with me,\" she explained. \"But if they can take away from that and that is where they feel drawn to, he's the exact right parent to be in this position.\"\n\nThroughout his battle with ALS, Sandra was by his side to support him and look after him. Her sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, took to Instagram to reveal he \"had the best caretakers in [Sandra].\"\n\n\"I’m convinced that Bry has found the best fishing spot in heaven and is already casting his lure into rushing rivers teaming with salmon,\" Gesine said. \"ALS is a cruel disease but there is some comfort in knowing he had the best of caretakers in my amazing sister and the band of nurses she assembled who helped her look after him in their home. Rest in peace, Bryan.\"\n\nChris Evans (2014)\n\nIn 2014, it was rumoured that Captain America himself was 'pursuing' the Miss Congeniality star, At the time, a source claimed to Us Weekly that they went to a dinner party together with friends and 'spent the night talking' until midnight.\n\nSandra was even asked about the reports and she joked that the two already 'filed for divorce' and that the media was 'a little behind'. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, she said: \"You guys are a little behind. We’ve since married and it started breaking apart, so we separated.\n\n\"We filed for divorce, and I hope everyone can respect our privacy. But we’re going to remain friends and share responsibility of the farm animals we’ve taken on because you just can’t abandon the animals.\"\n\nJesse James (2003 - 2010)\n\nSandra and Jesse, 54, met each other after she brought her godson on a trip to West Coast Choppers' Long Beach headquarters in 2003. Jesse gave her a tour and later called her, but she ended up rejecting him twice.\n\nHe soon managed to win her over the two ended up tying the knot in 2005. Sandra admitted the relationship wasn't something she 'needed' or 'looked for' while Jesse admitted in 2010 that he feared she would be a 'b****' and 'some Hollywood snob' before he met her.\n\n\"I talked to her for a couple minutes and it was like getting hit in the head with a brick. Here's a woman I had assumptions about and she couldn't be farther from that,\" he explained at the time. Their happiness was short-lived as, in 2010, multiple women claimed they had affairs with him.\n\nHe went as far as checking himself into a rehab centre for sex addiction and the two divorced the following June. Admitting to the affairs he said to MailOnline in 2017: \"Yeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah... I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that's [the] end of story.\"\n\nRyan Gosling (2002-2003)\n\nBarbie star Ryan Gosling and Sandra had a brief relationship in the early 2000s. The two met on the set of the psychological thriller, Murder by Numbers, in 2001.\n\nShe was soon questioned whether the two were 'just friends' and she explained: \"If you were to add the word 'just,' it would probably be a bit of a lie. So, I'd say we're friends.\" Sandra said that the actor taught her how to 'disregard all that isn't important' and called him a 'little Buddha'.\n\nDespite their break up in 2003, the two remained friends and, years later, Ryan said 'show business' was the reason for their split.\n\n\"When both people are in show business, it's too much show business. It takes all of the light, so nothing else can grow,\" he told The Independent. He even said she and other ex-girlfriend Rachel McAdams were 'the greatest girlfriends of all time'.\n\nBob Schneider (1999 - 2001)\n\nBob Schneider and Sandra dated for several years, with her describing their relationship as 'very low-key' in an old interview with Cinema.com.\n\n\"It’s something I learned through trial and error,\" she said at the time. \"Dating is complicated for me. I have a fear of saying the l-word. Oh my God! I always feel like the minute I say it the sky will fall. Bob and I talk German all the time to each other, which is terribly funny because I'm so bad at it. Maybe saying 'I love you' in German could be easier for me.\"\n\nHis song Blue Skies for Everyone featured in her film Gun Shy and his other track, Bullets, showed up in her hit movie, Miss Congeniality.\n\nMatthew McConaughey (1996-1998)\n\nFans were head over heels for the idea of Sandra and Matthew dating in the 90s. The A Time to Kill stars managed to keep their romance a secret from the public for two years before they split in 1998.\n\n\"It’s the work we both put in. There’s a great amount of respect and love,\" she told Cosmopolitan of her relationship with Matthew in 2003. \"I feel very cared for by Matthew. No matter where he is in his life or where I am in mine — he could be married — I know we would stay close.\"\n\nIn 2014, Matthew presented her with the Decade of Hotness Award at the Guys Choice Awards and said: \"I've worked with you. I've tried to kiss you, successfully and unsuccessfully. I've been directed by you, in a short film and also to the exit of many bars.\"\n\nTate Donovan (1990 - 1995)\n\nShe met the O.C. alumn while filming for Love Potion No. 9 before dating and briefly getting engaged. However, things didn't work out and they called it quits in 1995. After splitting, he told Vanity Fair: \"I can’t explain why things worked out the way they did. We both know why it happened.\"\n\nShe even became friends with Jennifer Aniston thanks to the relationships they had with the actor. \"We were introduced by our former boyfriend. I say ‘our’ because you and I both partook of this one human being,\" Sandra told the Friends star in her Interview cover story in February 2020. \"We both partook of Tate. … Who was a very patient human being, given that he dated us both.\""
