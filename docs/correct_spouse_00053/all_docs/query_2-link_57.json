        "text": "NEW YORK (CBS) Us Weekly is reporting that Sandra Bullock has decided to file for divorce from her cheating husband Jesse James. But is that a good idea?\n\nThis news comes from an unnamed friend of Bullock's who says the actress has made up her mind and is talking with her lawyer.\n\nThe magazine also says that Bullock is seeking custody of James's 6-year old daughter from a previous marriage, though a rep for Bullock denies this.\n\nIt's highly unusual for an ex-stepmother to be granted custody of a child, but Bullock is apparently very close with Sunny, and both are devastated by all this.\n\nJames' representative told People magazine in a statement Tuesday that James \"realized that this time was crucial to help himself, help his family and help save his marriage\" and is seeking professional help.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Sandra Bullock go through with divorce?"
