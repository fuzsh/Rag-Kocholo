        "text": "If the goal was to win the public back over, he, um, missed the mark.\n\nSeven years after news broke that Jesse James serially cheated on then-wife Sandra Bullock, the former tabloid king is opening up about life post-Hollywood. He spoke with the Daily Mail -- and each tidbit is weirder than the next.\n\nThe basics: Now on wife number four, James currently lives in Texas, where he has a gun manufacturing business and a National Rifle Association clothing line. He's in the process of creating a very special gift: A customized weapon for President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I\"m just not sure how I'm going to get it to him,\" James said. \"I asked his people and they don't know either.\"\n\nYou can piece together where James' political leanings lie, but more surprising were his remarks on marriage and infidelity. James and Bullock had been married for five years when his shocking affairs leaked to the press.\n\n\"In general, both women and men cheat,\" he said. \"It's part of life.\"\n\nDespite this blas√© attitude, James (sort of) acknowledged the importance of taking responsibility for his actions.\n\n\"Yeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah,\" he said. \"I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that's end of story.\"\n\nBullock and James split in 2010, just weeks after she took home the Best Actress Oscar for her role in \"The Blind Side.\" The world was shocked to learn that James had stepped out on America's sweetheart with a number of rough-around-the edges women, including stripper and tattoo artist Michelle McGee.\n\nJames is now married to drag racer and billionaire heiress Alexis DeJoria, and he's quick to dismiss certain parts of his marriage history: \"The first one doesn't count because I was 20 when I got with her and she was 30,\" he said, referring to first wife Karla James. He was also briefly married to porn actress Janine Lindemulder.\n\nFor her part, Bullock is doing better than ever: She's now mom to two adoptive children, a son and a daughter. She has been dating photographer Bryan Randall since 2015."
