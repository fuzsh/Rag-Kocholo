        "text": "At the time, Bullock had just won her first Academy Award, for \"The Blind Side,\" and had adopted a child, Louis — but those successes were overshadowed by the public split.\n\nIn the interview with CBS ahead of the release of her latest movie, \"The Lost City,\" Bullock said she'd been worried about how the infidelity scandal and her subsequent split from James might affect her son.\n\n\"I mean, so much had happened,\" Bullock, 57, said. \"How do you process grief and not hurt your child in the process? It's a newborn. They take on everything that you're feeling. So my obligation was to him and not tainting the first year of his life with my grief.\"\n\nSince splitting with James, Bullock has been in a long-term relationship with the photographer Bryan Randall. She also adopted a second child, Laila, in 2015.\n\nRelated stories\n\nDuring the wide-ranging interview, Bullock also spoke about the hardships of being a mother of two Black children.\n\n\"I have a level of defense that millions of mothers have that aren't white,\" she said. \"I have an understanding of how scary it is, and I just get really emotional because I think of hundreds of years of women who've never been able to relax into motherhood — they've never been able to relax.\"\n\nBullock said last year on \"Red Table Talk\" that she was very protective of her children and that she'd been \"schooling\" Louis about racial discrimination since he was 6 years old.\n\n\"I let him process it,\" she said. \"He knows how the world works. He knows how cruel it is. He knows how unfair it is, and now Laila is knowing it.\""
