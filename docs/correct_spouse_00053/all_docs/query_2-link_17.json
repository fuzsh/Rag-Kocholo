        "text": "Sandra Bullock and Jesse James used to be among the renowned couples in Hollywood. Unlike other power couples, this duo was especially well known for their ‘messy split’ that left both Bullock and James heartbroken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the infidelity between the couple and James’ cheating rumors began to spread, Bullock felt she could not forgive her then-husband easily for embarrassing her, and filed for divorce.\n\nAlso Read: Sandra Bullock Dodged a Bullet by Losing $430M Forgettable Franchise to Angelina Jolie Only to Steal Movie from ‘Salt’ Actress 12 Years Later That Won Seven Oscars\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSandra Bullock’s Embarrassingly ‘Messy’ Divorce with Jesse James\n\nAlso Read: Steven Spielberg Didn’t Find Sandra Bullock Good Enough for His Movie That Made Nearly 1600% Profit at the Box-Office\n\nSandra Bullock, famous for her role in Miss Congeniality, met Jesse James in the December of 2003 at James’ show Monster Garage’s shooting place, West Coast Choppers. After over one and a half years since their first meeting, the couple decided to get married on 16th July 2005. They even adopted a child, that was to be their first and last, and named him Louis.\n\nHowever, everything didn’t go as planned for this power couple. During the years that they were together, infidelity rumors along with Jesse James’ cheating scandals started to float on the wide web. Eventually, after a series of unfortunate events, the 6 years-married pair finally decided to break up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though James apologized to Bullock as soon as he realized the consequences of his actions, however, the Miss Congeniality star wasn’t ready to forgive her husband just yet and thus filed for divorce. Years later, talking about her split and how she overcame it, Sandra Bullock said in an interview,\n\n“My life took a trajectory that wasn’t very pleasant, but I feel like it had to happen in order for me to fully understand what family was about.”\n\nWhile it was Bullock’s decision that caused the split between the pair, however, the actress, later on, did admit to being heartbroken about the situation.\n\nAlso Read: “That’s a loser thing to do”: Chris Evans Felt Embarrassed By His Extreme Obsession With Sandra Bullock Despite Allegedly Dating $250M Actress Years Later\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJesse James Found Losing His Child Challenging\n\nWhen in 2010, Sandra Bullock and Jesse James decided to end their six-year-old marriage, their child’s custody was granted to Bullock and James lost all his rights towards his child, Louis, altogether. All in all, James regretted his actions, and even though he was ready to face the consequences of his actions, he found leading the rest of his life without his child to be the most challenging part of his split with Bullock.\n\nYears later, when Sandra Bullock was asked about her current relationship with her former husband Jesse James, the actress responded by saying,\n\n“[It’s] a different one. A bittersweet one. One of new understanding. One of forgiveness. One that changed my life…The father I have known Jesse to be with all [his] kids is one that I hope Louis can experience one day.”\n\nSandra Bullock is currently in a live-in relationship with photographer Bryan Randall whom she met in 2015 during her son Louis’s birthday party, where Randall was called to photograph the event.\n\nAdvertisement"
