        "text": "He became notoriously unpopular after it was exposed he repeatedly cheated on Hollywood heavyweight Sandra Bullock, and it seems that seven years on, Jesse James has no regrets.\n\nIn a telling new interview with The Daily Mail, the West Coast Choppers founder reflects on his high-profile split with the now-52-year-old.\n\n“Yeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah,” James told the publication.\n\n“I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized. And that’s end of story.”\n\nThe TV personality confessed that he still receives criticism to this day over his infidelity.\n\n“The easy [put-down] is like, ‘Oh well, you cheated on Sandra Bullock.’ That’s the world’s easiest comeback,” he went on.\n\n“In general, both women and men cheat. It’s part of life. It’s like people love to see you fall. And the farther you get, the higher you get, the more they love it.\n\n“I look at myself now and I look at how I was feeling then, and I think I was completely overreacting as far as letting it really get to me.”\n\nJames, who began dating the Gravity star in 2005 after meeting her on the set of Monster Garage, went on to blame the paparazzi as one of the reasons that led to his adultery.\n\n“I think it was having 50 or 60 or paparazzi outside my house for five or six months. That was not a good feeling. I’m a fighter, man, I come from the tradition of — if you do something I don’t like, I’m going to punch you,” he says.\n\nJames is now happily married for the fourth time to billionaire daughter and drag racer Alexis DeJoria.\n\nWATCH: Sandra opens up about her emotional Mother’s Day in the video below! Article continues…\n\nThe 47-year-old and Sandra wed in 2005. Five years later, not long after the star’s Oscar win for The Blind Side, multiple women spoke out claiming that James had engaged in affairs.\n\nAlthough he initially checked into rehab to save their marriage, the couple’s divorce was finalised in June 2012, and while the former flames were in the process of adopting son Louis when the scandal broke, the now-seven-year-old’s adoption was finalised by Sandra alone."
