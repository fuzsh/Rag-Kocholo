        "text": "Jesse James just can't keep picking the scab of his failed marriage to Sandra Bullock.\n\nIn an intro to his new Discovery Channel competition series \"American Chopper: The Build Off,\" which pits James against Orange County Choppers and the team of Paul Teutul Sr. and Paul Teutul Jr., the former Mr. Bullock takes a hard swipe as his former wife, with whom he split after five years because of his infidelity.\n\n“I became a big shot and married some Hollywood actress and didn’t talk to anybody anymore, so I feel bad,\" says James. \"I feel obligated to reconnect with all these people and show them that I’m still the same fabricator motorcycle guy. I’m not what I became.”\n\nAfter their five-year marriage ended after it was revealed James had cheated on Bullock with tattoo model Michelle \"Bombshell\" McGee (and, allegedly, several other women), James piled on the humiliations when photographs surfaced of the bike customizer playfully giving Nazi salutes followed by his tumultuous relationship and near trip to the altar with tattoo artist (and Bombshell McGee doppelganger) Kat Von D.\n\nVon D, incidentally, recently accused James of cheating on her with 19 different women.\n\nPerhaps getting back to basics is the best choice for James these days."
