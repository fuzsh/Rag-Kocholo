Social and emotional sensing - Gauge emotions and opinions based on a piece of text. - Understand and deliver a more nuanced message back based on sentiment. ENTERPRISE WIDE USE CASES FOR AN LLM Classiﬁcation and Clustering - Categorize and sort large volumes of data into common themes and trends to support more informed decision making. Language Translation - Globalize your content by feeding web pages through LLMs for translation. - Combine with chatbots to provide multilingual support to your customer base. Document Summarization - Distill large amounts of text down to the most relevant points. Content Generation - Provide detailed and contextually relevant prompts to develop outlines, brainstorm ideas and approaches for content. L Adoption dependent upon an Enterprise’s risk tolerance, restrictions, decision rights and disclosure obligations.
