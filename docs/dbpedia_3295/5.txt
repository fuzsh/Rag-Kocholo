Please note the new URL for this page -- http://www.gumbopages.com/noncomm-radio.html --

and adjust your links accordingly. I am a firm believer in independent, non-commercial community radio.

The most interesting and creative radio in North America is invariably found over on the left-hand side of the dial, those frequencies between 87 and 92 mHz that in the U.S. are reserved for educational, community and noncommercial use. No matter where you are, if you twiddle your dial over on the left, you're bound to find good, eclectic radio programming, an oasis from the vast wasteland that is commercial radio in this country. If you're hitting the road, find those stations here!

NOTE to radio station webmasters: While compiling this list, I was astonished at the number of radio stations that do not list their broadcast frequency on their web sites. This is essential information, folks! Don't forget!

If you have any additions or changes -- stations not listed here, or further descriptions and/or web pages of stations that are listed here, out-of-date links (remember, this is a one-man operation and I can't keep on top of all this by myself) -- please e-mail them to me. I especially seek listings for independent radio from outside North America. We hope to make this the Web's most comprehensive and detailed listing of non-commercial radio stations!

Click on the state or province abbreviation for a shortcut, or view listings for stations outside North America.

A couple of other abbreviations explained: NPR = National Public Radio, the largest public radio network in the U.S.; PRI = Public Radio International, a rival network which was originally called American Public Radio after its split from NPR.

San Francisco, KUSF in Exile. "From 1963 until 2011, KUSF 90.3 FM was a community- and student-run broadcast FM station owned by the University of San Francisco (USF). On the morning of Tuesday, January 18, 2011, USF officials informed the on-air DJ that the station was shutting down, and that he was to immediately cease programing and leave the broadcast studio. That DJ and the other community and student volunteers on site were then escorted off the premises by campus police. Having secretly decided to sell the station, USF President Stephen A. Privett entered into a complex three-party arrangement with USC and corporate broadcasting giant Entercom. The KUSF license was sold without public hearing or notice, even to USF students or faculty. Our object is to support the preservation of the KUSF FCC license as a local, diverse, Non-Commercial Educational (NCE) station serving its San Francisco Community of License. Our group includes KUSF DJs, USF faculty, and diverse community members, all working together to stop the sale of KUSF and return community radio to San Francisco."
