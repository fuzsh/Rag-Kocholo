        "text": "Almost 60 years ago Anthony Wagner, the late Garter King of Arms, tentatively concluded that 'heraldry was coming into use and taking formal shape for a generation or more before our first clear evidence for it.' 1 Other armorists have hinted at the same opinion, but few have tried to substantiate it. Even Wagner himself did not really put forward arguments, other than to list a handful of early armorial seals from all over Europe dated to the period from 1136 to 1159. There are least two, interconnected reasons for this reticence. The first is the obvious shortage of data, which almost without exception come from seals. Very few seals have survived from the twelfth century , and only three families provide seals for more than one individual (Candavène-Saint-Pol, Clare, and Savoy). The second reason derives from the unwillingness of most scholars to speculate without having documentary evidence on which to build their hypotheses and arguments. If we accept Wagner's conclusion though we might more appropriately call it a hypothesis—there are several families that we might expect to have adopted armo-rial emblems around or shortly after 1100, i.e. at the conclusion of the First Crusade (without proposing any relation between the two). But to what extent, in which order, and at which social level did this happen? The problem facing us in substantiating the hypothesis can be reformulated in more general terms: is it possible to date an adoption of arms to before it is documented? Speculation has been engaged in for more than a hundred years. J. Horace Round more or less explicitly dated the adoption of the quarterly arms of Mandeville before 1144, but as discussed below, though this dating has often been cited, it was based purely on a rough extrapolation from seal data fifty to a hundred years later. 2 If it can be shown that different branches of a family bearing nearly identical arms were distinct and separate at a certain date, this would provide a better basis for extrapola-tion; but they would have to be effectively, physically separated, not just moved into the next valley or a few shires away. The primary aim of this paper is to investigate whether there is evidence to substantiate the adoption of arms before the date of any surviving documentation. Three sets of data were chosen to explore the possibilities.\n\nGrechylo A. Contemporary flags of the Ukrainian regions: Old traditions and new designs. From: Proceedings of the XX International Congress of Vexillology, Stockholm, 27th July to 1st August 2003 /ed. by J. O. Engene. – Bergen: Nordic Flag Society, 2004. – P. 233-254. Ukraine consists of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and 24 oblasts (regions or provinces). The new law on local self-governments, adopted by the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) of Ukraine in 1997, allowed local authorities to confirm the coats of arms, flags, and other symbols of oblasts, rayons (districts), cities, towns, and villages. Over the last six years, all oblasts have adopted their own symbols. Most of them have already adopted regional flags. Many of these flags have old historical signs and colours (Volyn, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, etc.), but some oblasts have chosen new designs (Donetsk, Cherkasy, Kherson, and others). Ukraine is divided into 25 administrative territories — 24 oblasts (provinces or regions) and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Two cities, Kyiv and Sevastopol, have a special, national status. The oblast borders have remained unchanged since 1959, when Drohobych oblast was joined to the Lviv oblast (Fig. 1). After the disintegration of the Ruthenian Kingdom (Galician-Volynian State) in the middle of the 14th c., the Ukrainian lands were divided among various neighbouring countries. During this time the arms of separate administrative territories were used. When Ukraine was absorbed into the USSR, none of the oblasts possessed their own arms or flag. Only after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the declaration of Ukrainian independence did a process of the formation of symbols of administrative territories begin. The first regional coat of arms was ratified for the Transcarpathian (Zakarpattya) oblast in December 1990. In 1992 the symbols of Crimea, which received the status of an autonomous republic, were adopted. In both cases, the symbols were adopted for specific, acute political reasons: local communists influenced by Moscow tried to kindle regional separatism and to prevent the restoration and development of the new Ukrainian state. Starting in 1990, many cities and towns actively began restoring and using their former symbols. The arms of the city of Chernivtsi in particular were accepted based on historical sources, and in 1994 the arms of the Chernivtsi oblast were adopted. The decisions on symbols were adopted by the respective local councils, though according to the then extant legislation of the former USSR, Ukrainian SSR or independent\n\n\" The hardest thing of all is to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there is no cat. \" – Confucius. Confucius: Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher, 551 – 479 BC. The Latin phrase, Historia est Magistra Vitae, conveys that the study of past history should serve as a lesson to the future. The word 'history' commonly expresses events that have already taken place, and are documented as facts. Many people wish to ignore that this is a natural truth. Truth is the unabashed description of compiled facts on a subject, particularly when events in time have been recorded and produce no other outcome. Truth differs from theory and hypothesis, wherein these latter produce only partially know events, and supposition replaces facts for understanding the topic. Until the complete facts are known, supposition takes the place of full understanding. Therefore, when knowledge is imparted to provide full understanding there is no room for non-truth. Supposition, theory and hypothesis must make an exist. When publishing any topic for review, the author(s)must provide for all information that is known to be the truth, particularly when facts are available to make a determination. When facts are tangible, able to be touched and read, the final analysis can take but one path; not two, and not several. When dealing with known events, omitting the observance of set rules, and long held traditional foundations of processes, omission yields bad history. When true history is observable, touchable, and readable it presents things which may have been overlooked to form a hypothesis or theory about a topic. History is present in records, documents and accounts. As historical information is available to heraldists and genealogists alike, what reason would there be to create theories or hypotheses about armorials and family pedigree, and thereby discard known relationships? The obvious answer is: There is no reasonable motive to do so. However, when facts are discarded and ignored, anyone will realize that here is clearly an agenda behind it, and motive to do so. A divergent outcome to history can only come about where new information has been discovered, sometimes with comparison of records, and/or where certain rules, discoveries, or procedures do not support the once accepted. To be clear, discarding truth does not place any expression in the realm of new discovery. There is nothing new when it comes to dismissing history and pedigree, or for that matter, knowledge on other topics. Somewhere, someone, in the past, or sadly at present, dismisses facts as being irrelevant, ignoring the truth entirely, posturing their concocted views to fill the void of their very own self-imposed whims. This has happened before and will surely happen in the future as well. If fact, such is occurring at this very time revolving around the names MacTavish and Thom(p)son. When history is discarded all manner of things are possible, including the formulation of fictions, pseudo-history, half-truths. The historical stature of Clan MacTavish is misrepresented in many INTERNET, or other, venues, some expressed in anciently penned Highland Traditions, which are nothing but the myths of Argyllshire. Without question, MacTavishes are of Gaelic origin and culture and much older than the myths portray. This article is meant to explore one of those inconsistencies and half-truths being presented modernly about the MacTavishes, addressing a hypothesis that MacTavishes are in some way related to the Scottish Lowland and Midland Thompson armigers, expounding some very strange reasoning based solely on armorial similarity. This armorial hypothesis does not provide what is known and recorded about the MacTavishes in traditional or even historical accounts, which when examined would dispel any such nonsense. A half-truth does not make a fact, nor does the bending or manipulation of historical facts make statements truthful. As Confucious' philosophy imparts at the head of this article, there might be no cat to be found, and thus finding the \" cat \" becomes an impossible feat. Once the dark room has been illuminated, it becomes clear, there was no \" cat \" to be found. Thus, completely illuminating the room reveals – there simply is nothing at all in the room as it has been described. Looking at the entire room is necessary to determine, what, if anything, is there. The authors of any subject access certain information to accomplish the goals of their writings, but can and often do omit the background of the documentary sources they profess, or may simply eliminate the entire truth expounded in those historical writings. When this occurs, the events can be bent to the writer's own whims. When facts get in the way of what any writer is attempting to express, facts disappear. When facts vanish, the outcome is an incorrect view of actual events; and non-truth emerges. To provide accuracy, particularly regarding a subset of people, understanding is required. It may take several years to accomplish"
