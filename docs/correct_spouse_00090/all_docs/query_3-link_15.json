        "text": "Leigh, Postgate, Lass, Middleton\n\nLooking for further information on George A Leigh and Margaret L Robison who married in Bristol in 1936. Margaret was born in 1909 and passed on in 2004., possibly in Cambridge. They had one known child, Rosemary Leigh b.1946 who married Ian C Postgate in 1966. Sadly the marriage failed. Rosmary then married Rodney E Lass in 1983 and Ian married Barbara S Middleton also in 1983. Hoping someone out there can help. COOMBEE now COMBER\n\nHi I am looking for any relatives of Mary L Coombee DOB C 1865 & her brother Albert W Coombee (who was employed as a baker)both born in Horsham. Then they appear on 1891 census at 31 Westbury Road, Croydon. Any family or information please get in touch. Many thanks! BOOKER\n\nI am searching for details of Mary Ann BOOKER who was born in Horsham c1833 but moved to Kensington in London where she married William Henry SKINNER. Her father was William BOOKER who is noted as deceased on the marriage certificate of 1855. I would appreciate contact from anyone who may have information on this family. KNIGHT/KING in HORSHAM\n\nMy father Herbert John Knight b Sept 23, 1904 and his brother George b May 19 1906 in Horsham. Their father Arthur R Knight was in the Royal Army and their mother Anne Gallagher may have been staying with family in Horsham. Anyone have any info on this family? Could someone look for the baptisms of these children at St Mary`s? HALL HARRIS Enigma\n\nMy father Arthur HALL, and his twin Wilfred Charles, were born to Edith HALL (nee Harris) 7 June 1907 in Horsham. Edith, born 1879 Bombay, was married to Sgt John HALL, born 1874 Lucknow, of 65th Regt. There appears to be no \"logical\" reason why Edith should be in Horsham at this time. I am trying to trace her family and believe that she may have \"gone home to mother\" to have the twins. This is pure supposition.Could sks please help me ? I am trying to establish if there was a Harris family to which she was connected in Horsham/environs. Burns/Corrie\n\nAny details of the union between Annie Burns and James Corrie from Dumfrieshire Scotland, of their children a son Thomas Patrick Corrie who married Mary Charman daughter of George and Annie, I am 1 of his 2 sons and I have two sons of which 1 has a son also, it would be great to get in touch with family so as to communicate. Bates Goddard Marriage\n\nAnnie Goddard married Joseph Bates in 1890 in Horsham. Whilst I don not think they stayed around the area very long, if anyone has anyinformation, or can look at the parish record for me I would be grateful. I do not know the names of Annies parents yet. Any help would be appreciated Peter Jenkins - Horsham\n\nMy ggg grandfather, Peter Jenkins born 1 November 1837 at Horsham, Sussex. He was the son of William Jenkins and Hannah (nee Walden) married 13 June 1837 at Horsham. Hannah and William also had Mark, Harriett, John, Matilda, Alice, William, Sarah Ann, Mary and Hannah. Peter married Ellen (Denman) 26 December 1857 at Horsham. Their children were Frederic, Ellen, Clara, Christopher and Peter. Christopher died at Upper Bewbush, Lower Beeding on 4 April 1866 of Scrofula Abcess (type of TB). His father was present. In the 1871 Census it states that, Frederic 13, Ellen 10, Peter 9, and Clara 7 were living in the Workhouse at Horsham. We have no knowledge of what happened to Ellen after Christophers birth or of Peters after Christophers death. Maybe they died between these times and the 1871 Census. Cannot find any more about them can anyone tell me where to go from here. Clara my gg grandmother married George Standing and lived in Brighton - she did keep in touch with her brother Peter who settled in the POrtsmouth area. Has anybody any info of Peter/Ellens family in the 1861 Cenus or where Clara Jenkins/Standing resided in subsequent Censi. Streeter Family\n\nI have some information on the Streeter family from Horsham but have come to a wall at James Streeter and his marriage to Mary Ann Seagrave in Horsham on 19 June 1827. Connected to this family are also the Dewdney's, Hardings, Meads,Goachers, Seagraves and Penfolds. Any help appreciated Potter Family\n\nI have information on the potter family. One of my ancestors, an Alfred Blackiston boarded with the family in Horsham in 1901, and they were benefactors in his will. The whole family are mentioned, even the married name of the daughter. One son was called Harry potter."
