However, it is not a proven link and needs to be treated with caution, although the age at death matches exactly.\n\nNote that the Sussex Marriage Index has a Mary ROFFE married Francis Goldsmith 19 Feb 1781 at Brighton spouse otp (\"signs ROOFE\") and Francis is a batchelor of Arundel (lic). The marriage licence says that Mary is 25+ and Francis is 25+. The fact that the transcriber states \"signs ROOFE\" shows the interchangeability of the two surnames.1,2\n\nMarriage*: Susanna Roofe married John Holden on 30 January 1778 at St Nicholas, Brighton, Sussex, England , both of this parish.3\n\nMarried Name: As of 30 January 1778, her married name was Holden.\n\n(Witness) Will: Susanna Roofe is mentioned in the will of John Holden dated 6 April 1813 at Brighton, Sussex, England .4\n\nResidence*: In 1819 Susanna Roofe and John Holden lived at North St, Brighton, Sussex, England.2\n\nDeath*: Susanna Roofe died in 1824 at Brighton, Sussex, England .\n\nBurial*: Susanna Roofe was buried on 23 September 1824 at St Nicholas, Brighton, Sussex, England , age 67 years, abode Grenville Gardens.2\n\nFamily:\n\nJohn Holden b. c 1747, d.

Could this be a sister to Henry? One of the witnesses was Sarah White.1\n\nMarriage*: Henry White married Sarah Richardson, daughter of James Richardson and Sarah Mockford, on 5 April 1795 at St John the Baptist, Clayton, Sussex, England , Sarah's surname is spelt RICKERSON, both of Clayton, witnesses John Ailward and James Geer (who appears to be the parish clerk.)2\n\nAnecdote: In searching for this marriage there were two possibilities:\n\n24 Jun 1798 Henry WHITE married Sarah MARTEN at Clayton\n\n5 Apr1795 Henry WHITE married Sarah RICKERSON (RICHARDSON) at Clayton\n\nThese two Sarah's are:\n\nSarah RICHARDSON bap. 20 Dec 1777 to James and Sarah Richardson at Clayton\n\nSarah MARTEN bap. 20 Sep 1778 to John & Sarah Marten at Clayton\n\nHenry's first wife, Sarah, was buried at Clayton on 20 Jan 1802, age 24 years. Assuming that the above Sarah's were born one month before baptism, their ages on 20 Jan 1802 would have been: Sarah Richardson 24 years, Sarah Marten 23 years. The date at burial therefore supports Sarah Richardson being Henry's first wife.3\n\nAnecdote*: The marriage of a Henry White and Sarah Marten at Clayton on 28 Jun 1798 makes identification of children after this date difficult as both couples lived in Clayton. Their first child was likely Henry, baptised 18 Nov 1798 at Clayton. The next baptism is for Jane White on 29 Jun 1800, and she could be the child of either couple. Intriguingly, there is a baptism at Clayton on 4 Oct 1801 of John White son of Henry and Ann White. There are no Henry White marriages to an Ann in the Sussex Marriage Index in this period so there is the possibility that this is a mistake and should be Henry and Sarah (ie not Ann).2\n\nMarriage*: Henry White married Jane Gorringe on 20 November 1803 at Ditchling, Sussex, England , both of this parish. Henry was a widower.2\n\nAnecdote*: Sometime between 1804 and 1811 Henry and Jane moved from Ditchling to Brighton.\n\nOccupation: Henry White was husbandman on 2 April 1813.4\n\nResidence*: On 2 April 1813 Henry White and Jane Gorringe lived at Carlton Rd, Brighton, Sussex, England.4\n\nAnecdote: For the 1841 census, Henry and Jane were living in Edburton, just behind the Downs, where Henry later died in 1843. It is interesting to note that their son William had two children, William and Henry, who died in Brighton but were buried in Edburton in 1832 and 1829 respectively, suggesting that Henry and Jane moved to Edburton before 1829.5\n\nOccupation*: Henry White was an agricultural labourer on 7 June 1841.5\n\nDeath*: Henry White died on 11 March 1843 at 4 am, Edburton, Sussex, England . He died of disease of the heart, age 77 years.6\n\nBurial*: Henry White was buried on 16 March 1843 at Edburton, Sussex, England .7\n\nAnecdote: After Henry's death, it appears that Jane moved to Brighton to live with her son James and his family. She died in Brighton in 1846 but was buried in Edburton with Henry.8\n\nFamily 1:\n\nSarah Richardson b. 20 Dec 1777, d. 1802\n\nMarriage*: Henry White married Sarah Richardson, daughter of James Richardson and Sarah Mockford, on 5 April 1795 at St John the Baptist, Clayton, Sussex, England , Sarah's surname is spelt RICKERSON, both of Clayton, witnesses John Ailward and James Geer (who appears to be the parish clerk.)2\n\nChildren:\n\nHenry White b. 31 Jul 1796\n\nSarah White b. 6 May 1798\n\nFamily 2:\n\nJane Gorringe b. c 1782, d. 8 Jan 1846\n\nMarriage*: Henry White married Jane Gorringe on 20 November 1803 at Ditchling, Sussex, England , both of this parish.

Richard does have two children, Joseph and Sarah. It implies to me that Richard was likely brought up by his uncle Joseph and his wife Sarah (Hannah's parents).\n\nI think it is also an important fact that Richard lived in Framfield and Uckfield up to about 1861 when he moved to Buxted. This is telling me that whatever happened to the family after 1808 did not cause Richard (al least) to move away from the area. Maybe Hannah died after the birth of Thomas Realf in 1807 which was the cause of their son Thomas dying 9 months later (if so, it is puzzling why we can't find her burial - but wouldn't be a first). If the parents had moved away after 1808 (which would be one explanation for their absence thereafter) then surely Richard would have gone with them, so I can't see this as being a possibility.\n\nMaybe the parents split up, and Thomas moved away, leaving Hannah to live with her parents and bring up Richard. If this was the case you would think that Richard would have appreciated the effort and named a child after his mother.\n\nMy best guess based on this evidence is that Hannah died after the birth of Thomas (but we can't find her burial - not unknown in parish records). Richard was raised by Hannah's parents Joseph and Sarah Morris, and that husband Thomas remained in the area, never remarried and possibly died in Uckfield workhouse on 1 Oct 1858 age 77 years (giving his birth c1781 which sounds right). However, there is a Thomas RELF baptised 27 Mar 1783 in Framfield to John and Dinah Relf which is another real possibility for that death in the workhouse. Another Thomas Relf was baptised 27 Sep 1778 in Heathfield.\n\nI think there is a strong case for saying that Richard was brought up by Hannah's parents.\n\nG.

The actual marriage has not been found so it must be assumed that it didn't go ahead.

John Breach baptised 2 Dec 1750 at Eastbourne St Mary son of John Breach and Eliz.\n\n2. John Breach baptised 1 Feb 1750/51 at Eastbourne St Mary son of John Breach and Mary Sergeant (priv. baptism 19 Dec 1750).\n\n3. Jno (John) Breech on 20 Jan 1754 at Ditchling St Margaret, son of Jno (John) Breech and Ann. A brother Joseph baptised there as well in 1755.\n\n4. John Breach on 18 Aug 1758 at Eastbourne St Mary to Thomas Breach and Mary Denman. This is not the Thomas Breach and Mary Pritchard who married at Hamsey in 1728 but the Thomas Breach and Mary Denman who married at Bexhill on 9 Jun 1756 (te entry in the Sussex Marriage Index contains the comment that Thomas is of Eastbourne).\n\n5. John Breach baptised 10 Dec 1760 at Litlington (near Alfriston) son of Ann Breach.\n\nThe conclusion is that our John Breach is the one baptised 20 Jan 1754 at Ditchling because:\n\n1. Our John Breach was living at Hamsey where there was also a Joseph Breach (his brother), both having children baptised there and also,\n\n2. John's burial in 1830 gives his age as 75 years, giving a birth date c1755 which most closely matched to the Ditchling baptism. There are no Joseph Breachs in the SFHG baptism index before 1755 strongly suggesting that the Joseph Breach at Hamsey was the one baptised at Ditchling in 1755. It would be reasonable to assume that the John Breach at Hamsey was his brother also baptised at Ditchling in 1754.\n\nThe 1750/51 baptism at Eastbourne was of interest as it would make John Breach a brother of Benjamin Breach who was living at Hamsey with John and Joseph Breach. However, there is a possible marriage of this John Breach to Elizabeth Cogger Eldridge in 1772 at Battle and subsequent children born at Hastings. One of the children is named Mark (not a common name) which would be consistent with this John Breach being the son of John Breach and Mary Sargeant as Mary's father's name was Mark.4,2\n\nAnecdote: Discussion 2\n\nThere were four families having children baptised at Hamsey between 1777 and 1796:\n\nWilliam Breach and Jane Corner (m. 14 May 1776 at Hamsey, botp).
