The Saint comes face to face with drama in a bus shelter, which includes a sudden death, sabotage and a beautiful woman, Magda Vamoff (Dawn Addams) which leads him on a Blue Goose chase. The external shots show snow on the ground – no doubt from the cold winter of '62-'63.\n\n142\"Starring the Saint\"26 September 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Ronald Radd, Wensley Pithey, Alfred Burke, Jackie Collins, Alexander Davion, Paul Whitsun-Jones\n\nByron Ufferlitz (Ronald Radd), a somewhat unscrupulous film producer, wants Simon Templar to play the Saint in a film telling his own life story. However, events take an interesting turn when Simon discovers the body of Byron Ufferlitz with Peggy Warden (Ufferlitz's secretary) hiding behind the curtains. An interesting distraction is that this episode has Jackie Collins (who plays April Quest) a few years before she commenced her writing career. April Quest calls Ufferlitz both cruel and a user of people.\n\n153\"Judith\"3 October 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Julie Christie, David Bauer, Robert MacLeod, Andre Boulay, Margo Johns, Ross Parker, John Serret\n\nWhilst set in Canada, concerning wheeler dealer businessman Burt Northwade (David Bauer) who is selling a gas turbine design built by his brother Dr. Northwade, Burt's mansion is identifiably in North London! The Saint is accused of trespassing on the mansion's grounds. Judith (Julie Christie) has her own reasons for wanting the plans which are very valuable to replace petrol engines in cars.\n\n164\"Teresa\"10 October 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Lana Morris, Eric Pohlmann, Marne Maitland, Paul Whitsun-Jones, Alexander Davion, George Little, Alan Browning, Lawrence Dane, Marie Burke\n\nIn Mexico, Mrs. Teresa Alvarez (Lana Morris) is seeking her husband Gaspar, who disappeared two years earlier after making a failed attempt on the life of the President. She and Simon both know Miguel Artigas (Alexander Davion), a trapeze artist at the circus who was with Gaspar on the night that he disappeared. Miguel is shot during the performance, and dies shortly after passing key information to his wife and the Saint.\n\nNOTE: Marne Maitland would join Roger Moore playing Mr. Lazar in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun\n\n175\"The Elusive Ellshaw\"17 October 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Philip Latham, Angela Browne, Richard Vernon, Anthony Bate, Arthur Hewlett, Philip Bond, James Ottaway, Nicholas Pennell, Ellen McIntosh, Walter Brown, Norman Pitt\n\nBased on a story from The Saint Goes On.\n\nWith a number of location shots returning us to London, a wife, Mrs. Ellshaw (Ellen McIntosh) spots her missing husband, Mr. Ellshaw (Philip Latham), through a shop window, and she follows him to a flat which the Saint visits -- only to find it completely empty. Returning to Mrs Ellshaw's flat, Simon and Anne Ripwell (Angela Browne) find her body and Inspector Claude Teal (Norman Pitt) takes statements. There is then at attempt on the life of Sir John Ripwell (Richard Vernon).\n\n186\"Marcia\"24 October 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Samantha Eggar, Johnny Briggs, Philip Stone, Tony Beckley, Philip Anthony, Kenneth MacKintosh, Marion Mathie\n\nClaire Avery (Samantha Eggar) has been recruited to fill the shoes of the late Marcia Landon, who committed suicide following an acid attack which had ended her film career. Claire does not have much experience and the entire film crew members have no belief in her, which is only made worse when she receives a blackmail demand. Screenplay: Harry W. Junkin Director: John Krish\n\n197\"The Work of Art\"31 October 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Yolande Turner, Alex Scott, Martin Benson, Robert Cawdron, Hamilton Dyce, John Bailey\n\nSimon Templar is visiting Paris where a friend, Juliette (Yolande Turner), is a clothes designer but the firm for which she is working also has an agent of the Algerian rebels, Jean Bougrenet (John Bailey) in their midst -- and when he fails to liquidate some forged bonds for the rebels, his death becomes a matter which the Saint investigates.\n\n208\"Iris\"7 November 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Barbara Murray, David Bauer, Cyril Luckham, John Ronane, Ferdy Mayne, April Wilding, Meadows White\n\nMary Hardy (April Wilding) has sought the assistance of Simon Templar in connection with a play in which she is due to appear. The play appears to be a complete flop which Rick Lansing (David Bauer) is financing for the benefit of his wife Iris (Barbara Murray). However Simon knows that Lansing is running a protection racket which leads to the \"accidental\" death of Harry Blundel (Meadows White).\n\n219\"The King of the Beggars\"14 November 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Maxine Audley, Oliver Reed, Warren Mitchell, Yvonne Romain, Ronnie Corbett\n\nSimon is back in Rome and re-united with the friendly taxi-driver, Marco Di Cesari (Warren Mitchell as before). Simon has witnessed the murder of a blind beggar and then sees another female beggar being attacked for protection money by Joe Catelli (Oliver Reed). The female beggar is actually an actress, Theresa Mantania (Yvonne Romain), whom the Saint has seen wearing the same costume on stage. So who is extorting money from the beggars?\n\n2210\"The Rough Diamonds\"21 November 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Douglas Wilmer, George A. Cooper, Geoffrey Palmer, Paul Stassino, Frank Jarvis, Ray Austin\n\nSimon Templar enjoys a trip First Class accompanying £100,000 worth of diamonds from Africa back to the United Kingdom at the request of Alan Uttershaw (Douglas Wilmer), and an armoured van is due to meet the plane at Gatwick. Pete Ferguson (Geoffrey Palmer) is the driver of the van who is murdered when the van is hijacked and provides a reason for an investigation by the Saint. During a dance, there is one noteworthy statement: \"The Twist is finished\"!\n\n2311\"The Saint Plays with Fire\"28 November 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Justine Lord, Joseph Fürst, Robert Brown, Tony Beckley, Margaretta Scott, John Hollis\n\nBased on the book Prelude for War The British Nazi Party is staging a comeback, and Simon Templar is introduced to a journalist writing an exposé of the financing at a rally in Trafalgar Square. The subsequent death of the journalist, John Kennet (Tony Beckley), takes place in a fire at the home of Sydney Fairweather, in a locked room from which the Saint is unable to extract him. The inquest appears to be a complete whitewash until the Saint gives evidence.\n\nNOTE: Robert Brown would replace Bernard Lee as \"M\" in four James Bond films from 1983-1989. Joseph Furst played Dr. Metz in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever.\n\n2412\"The Well Meaning Mayor\"5 December 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Leslie Sands, Mandy Miller, Norman Bird, John Gill\n\nIn Seatondean on the south coast, Sam Purdell (Leslie Sands) has just been re-elected mayor, defeating his rival George Hackett (Norman Bird), who accuses the mayor of corruption over major development contracts in the town. After Hackett dies in a car accident, his daughter Molly (Mandy Miller) asks Simon to investigate, and he offers the mayor a bribe, which is soundly rejected - so what has really been happening?\n\n2513\"The Sporting Chance\"12 December 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Derren Nesbitt, Gerard Heinz, Godfrey Quigley, Bruce Boa, Carol Cleveland\n\nIn Ontario, Professor Mueller (Gerard Heinz), a defector from the GDR, feels that the Canadian government has not kept its promise to enable his family to join him despite having delivered all that they need for a satellite guidance system. He is planning to go back - but his family manages to defect and the messenger sent to tell him they are safe mysteriously dies. Like the Professor, Simon is on a fishing trip in Ontario and the death of his friend raises questions. Carol Cleveland plays Marion Kent, who is a secretary, and Derren Nesbitt plays Netchideff, who is charged with getting the Professor back to East Germany.\n\n2614\"The Bunco Artists\"19 December 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Peter Dyneley, Justine Lord, Mary Merrall, John Standing, Arnold Diamond, André Maranne\n\nNetherdon Parish Church is in need of a final £2000 for the restoration fund, and a mysterious visitor, Mrs. Wades, offers the cash providing she can see the existing £6000 in cash as part of the due diligence of the charity. Jean Yarmouth (Justine Lord) is the daughter of the vicar's secretary and a close friend of Simon Templar; she happens to be around when an American detective, Henderson (Peter Dyneley) arrives with the local police to arrest Mrs. Wades. The detective and Mrs. Wades disappear to Nice where the Saint pursues them to try and recover the missing funds.\n\n2715\"The Benevolent Burglary\"26 December 1963 ( )\n\nGuest cast: John Barrie, Suzanne Neve, Rachel Gurney, Arnold Diamond, Ivor Salter, André Maranne\n\nIn Monte Carlo this week, Simon assists a musician friend, Bill Fulton (Gary Cockrell), win the hand of Meryl Vascoe (Suzanne Neve), the daughter of Elliott Vascoe (John Barrie), whom it seems needs to be taught a lesson. Mr. Vascoe believes that his art gallery with an excellent alarm system cannot be burgled. The Saint enters into a bet for £5000 with Mr. Vascoe that someone will manage it within 4 days in front of the press - which leads to the challenge being widely reported.\n\n2816\"The Wonderful War\"2 January 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Ferdy Mayne, Alfred Burke, Suzanna Leigh, Renée Houston, John Bennett, David Graham, Noel Purcell\n\nOil has been discovered in the Middle Eastern nation of Sayeda, but the Prime Minister and the army stage a coup, killing the ruler but allowing his son, Prince Karim (Louis Raynor), to escape to Kuwait, aided by Mike Kelly (Noel Purcell). Lilla McAndrew (Suzanna Leigh) is concerned for her missing father (also murdered) and requests assistance from Simon Templar to establish the truth -- and also to re-instate the son as ruler, perhaps?\n\n2917\"The Noble Sportsman\"9 January 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Sylvia Syms, Anthony Quayle, Jane Asher, Donald Pickering, Francis Matthews, Russell Waters, Martin Wyldeck\n\nLord Yearley (Anthony Quayle), the \"Noble Sportsman\", is a renowned sportsman with a much younger wife (Sylvia Sims), who has a wandering eye - she ends her relationship with architect Paul Farley (Francis Matthews) when she finds out that she is pregnant. Lord Yearley's daughter Rose (Jane Asher) knows Simon Templar, whom she approaches for help when her father receives a letter threatening that he will be killed.\n\n3018\"The Romantic Matron\"16 January 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: John Carson, Patrick Troughton, Peter Diamond, Joby Blanshard, George Little\n\nIn Buenos Aires, there has been a recent gold security van heist, a glamorous American traveller, Beryl Carrington (Ann Gillis), Simon Templar and a curious story concerning the \"resistance\" to a new government spun by Ramone Venino (John Carson) who is being \"followed\" by a pair of unsavoury characters. Inevitably Simon has to explain it all to the local Inspector of police (Patrick Troughton).\n\n3119\"Luella\"23 January 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Sue Lloyd, David Hedison, Suzanne Lloyd, John Woodnutt, Julian Holloway\n\nBill Harvey (David Hedison) arrives with his attractive wife for a stay in London - but Doris (Suzanne Lloyd) has to go to Paris to see her expectant sister. Bill wants to party, but Simon has promised to look after him. However, Simon eventually agrees to a night on the town - during which Bill suffers. The following night in his hotel, Luella (credited as Susan Lloyd and later known as Sue Lloyd) orders a martini and Bill immediately shows an interest. A compromising situation and some blackmail require the involvement of the Saint to get every thing straightened out.\n\nNOTE: As an inside joke, Simon Templar was confused for James Bond in the episode. Roger Moore had been offered the movie role twice during the run of the series, not being able to accept until 1972. Ironically, David Hedison joined Roger Moore in his first Bond film \"Live and Let Die\" in 1973 as Felix Leiter. He played Leiter a second time in 1989's \"Licence to Kill\".\n\n3220\"The Lawless Lady\"30 January 1964 ( )\n\nAdapted from a story in the 1930 book Enter the Saint.\n\nGuest cast: Dawn Addams, Julian Glover, Kenneth Benda, John G. Heller, James Belchamber\n\nCountess Audrey (Dawn Addams) is the apparent object of Simon Templar's affection - but he has noticed a coincidence between the guests she entertains and the houses of those guests being the subject of break-ins and thefts. He proposes that they become partners in crime, and she accepts. Hilloram (Julian Glover) is her chauffeur and undertakes the thefts until replaced by the Saint. Countess Audrey is planning a huge heist whilst on board a yacht leaving Cannes - having invited some very rich people and their jewellery.\n\nNOTE: Julian Glover would join Roger Moore on the big screen in 1981 as villain Ari Kristatos in the James Bond film \"For Your Eyes Only\".\n\n3321\"The Good Medicine\"6 February 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Barbara Murray, Anthony Newlands, Bill Nagy, Jean Marsh, John Bennett\n\nDenise (Barbara Murray) married Philippe Dumont (Anthony Newlands), a chemist, in Beauvais, France where they create a huge cosmetics empire based on his knowledge and her drive, leading to the \"Denise Dumont\" empire using heavy advertising and employing 300 staff. Denise then dumps Philippe, and later she is introduced to Simon Templar by journalist David Stern (Bill Nagy). David Stern and Philippe's sister, Marie (Jean Marsh), encourage Simon to redress the financial balance when polite requests for funds are rejected.\n\n3422\"The Invisible Millionaire\"13 February 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Katharine Blake, Michael Goodliffe, Nigel Stock, Mark Eden, Jane Asher, Eunice Gayson, Basil Dignam, Charles Morgan, Peter Lawrence\n\nQuite early on we find out that Mrs. Marvin Chase (Katherine Blake) is rather too fond of Mr. Chase's assistant Bertrand Tamblin (a young Mark Eden, long before his stint as Alan Bradley on Coronation Street), who dies when Marvin Chase (Basil Dignam) crashes the car, the latter suffering disfiguring facial burns. Simon knows Chase's secretary, Nora Prescott (Eunice Gayson), who has some concerns when Chase starts selling all of his assets and no one can actually see him or hear him speak. Nora's murder raises even more questions.\n\nNOTE: Continuing the James Bond connection, Eunice Gayson would play Sylvia Trench, James Bond's love interest in the first two films \"Dr. No\" and \"From Russia with Love\".\n\n3523\"The High Fence\"20 February 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: James Villiers, Suzanne Lloyd, Peter Jeffrey, Reginald Beckwith, Harry Towb, Stanley Meadows\n\nGabrielle Forrest (Suzanne Lloyd) and Simon interrupt a jewellery theft in progress at the former's house. A gunshot deflates one of Simon's tyres, which enables them to get away, but a study of police photographs identifies Johnny Anworth (Harry Towb) as one of the miscreants. However, a mysterious bystander had reported them breaking into the house; who is he, and to whom was her reporting? Who is the \"High Fence\" who reportedly pays twice the amount any other fence offers for stolen jewellery?\n\nNOTE: James Villiers played Bill Tanner with Roger Moore in the 1981 James Bond film \"For Your Eyes Only\".\n\n3624\"Sophia\"24 February 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Imogen Hassall, Oliver Reed, Wolfe Morris, Tommy Duggan; directed by Roger Moore\n\nOn holiday in Athens, Simon Templar is invited to become involved in an archaeological dig in Kyros at the invitation of Professor Grant (John Wentworth). The local hotel owner, Stavros, has an outspoken daughter Sophia (Imogen Hassall) and a roguish nephew Aristides (Oliver Reed) who has been living in Los Angeles and is apparently very rich. On arrival he is particularly interested in a valuable item uncovered by the Professor.\n\n3725\"The Gentle Ladies\"5 March 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Avice Landon, Renée Houston, Barbara Mullen, Timothy Bateson, Anthony Nicholls, Barry Wilsher\n\nIn the Sussex seaside town of Bosham, there are three elderly ladies -- Florence, Ida and Violet Warshed -- whom it seems have been in \"hiding\" for some years until tracked down by Alfred Powls - the ladies all call him Freddie - and he is soon blackmailing them for money as he calls them by some completely different names. Florence has already met Simon Templar through a small accident and he is soon interested in Mr. Powls.\n\n3826\"The Ever-Loving Spouse\"12 March 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Jeanne Moody, David Bauer, Alexis Kanner, Robert Arden, Bartlett Mullins, Max Faulkner, Barry Jones\n\nVisiting San Francisco, The Saint is staying at a hotel where a convention of candy makers is taking place. One of the factory owners, Otis Fennick (Barry Jones), is caught on film in a compromising situation with a partly clad young blonde, Norma Upton, who is working with a photographer. It seems that Mrs. Fennick (Jeanne Moody) does not intend to blackmail her husband but instead wants to gain a divorce.\n\n3927\"The Saint Sees It Through\"19 March 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Margit Saad, Carl Duering, Joseph Fürst, Gordon Sterne\n\nIt appears that a former girl-friend of Simon's, Lili Klausner (Margit Saad), who is somehow both a nightclub singer in Hamburg and a person with links to a smuggling ring which has recently stolen twelve pictures from the Kremlin; needless to say, the Russians want them returned, no questions asked. Once in Hamburg, the Saint links up with Fritz Kapel (Gordon Sterne), who is working with American intelligence and then reacquaints himself with Lili, who is not admitting why she walked out on him in New York some three years earlier.\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseriesTitleOriginal air date401\"The Miracle Tea Party\"8 October 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Nanette Newman, Fabia Drake, Conrad Phillips, Robert Brown, Edward Jewesbury, Charles Houston, Michael Standing, Basil Dignam; directed by Roger Moore\n\nSimon catches sight of Geraldine McLeod (Nanette Newman) in a telephone box at London Waterloo station when an acquaintance of hers, Franklin (Edward Jewesbury), dies (murdered) in another booth. They both work at Portland Naval Base. Before he died, Franklin placed a small box in bag which she later discovers contains £500, whilst Simon spots that they are being followed. It transpires that Franklin was a Special Branch plant on the track of information leaks.\n\n412\"Lida\"15 October 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Jeanne Moody, Erica Rogers, Peter Bowles, Aubrey Morris, Robert Raglan, Marne Maitland, Henry McCarthy\n\nJoan Wingate (Erica Rogers) has asked for Simon's assistance as her sister, Lida Verity (Jeanne Moody), appears to have changed in recent times, and Joan is concerned over her odd behaviour. Simon is enjoying the warm weather in the Bahamas to rain in London, but Lida's death soon sets in motion an inquiry requiring the Saint's usual skills in mental gymnastics and physical defence! The viewer, however, senses that Lida's friend, Maurice Kerr (Peter Bowles), may know more than that to which he admits.\n\n423\"Jeannine\"22 October 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Sylvia Syms, Jacqui Chan, Manning Wilson, John Dearth, Robert Cawdron, Peter Diamond, Martin Miller\n\nIn Paris, visiting diplomat Madam Chen (Jacqui Chan) has a very precious pearl necklace which it seems is of interest to a number of professional criminals, one of whom, Jeannine Roger (Sylvia Syms), is acting as Public Relations for Madam Chen, and is also \"recognised\" by the Saint under another name although it may be a mistaken identity.\n\nNOTE: This is actually the first episode of the series where Simon looks up at the halo above his head before the opening credits.\n\n434\"The Scorpion\"29 October 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Catherine Woodville, Nyree Dawn Porter, Geoffrey Bayldon, Philip Latham, Dudley Sutton, Ronald Leigh-Hunt\n\nThe Saint is pontificating on the uncertainty of London weather when his phone rings - Long Harry (Philip Latham) wants help. Last week, Harry broke into a house to steal a letter for \"The Scorpion\". The letter was left in a locker at Victoria Station, but Harry watched for the letter to be collected and he knows the face of the individual. It seems likely that a Government minister, Mark Everest (Ronald Leigh-Hunt) will be the subject of blackmail. Mark Everest has a secretary, Karen (Catherine Woodville), who has a habit of listening at doors and to telephone calls. The blackmailer appears to be Patsy Butler (Nyree Dawn Porter).\n\n445\"The Revolution Racket\"5 November 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Eric Pohlmann, Peter Arne, Suzanne Lloyd, Ed Bishop, Michael Godfrey, Reginald Jessup, Walter Randall, Clive Cazes, Michael Lynch\n\nIn a South American republic, the Saint finds a couple of guns pointing at him inviting him to a restaurant where the local police captain, Carlos Xavier (Eric Pohlmann) treats him to a Chilean Riesling wine and provides guidance on the various other diners of the evening, especially Doris Inkler (Suzanne Lloyd) and the very rich Enriquez brothers who can afford to lead a revolution if they can source the arms needed.\n\nNOTE: More James Bond connections: Eric Pohlmann (uncredited) provided the voice of the unseen head of SPECTRE, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in From Russia with Love (1963) and Thunderball (1965). Ed Bishop had small speaking roles in You Only Live Twice (1967) and Diamonds Are Forever (1971), but was not included in the film credits for either.\n\n456\"The Saint Steps In\"12 November 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Geoffrey Keen, Justine Lord, Annette Andre, Ed Bishop, Peter Vaughan, Michael Robbins, Neil McCarthy, Nicholas Pennell, David Jackson\n\nMadeline Gray (Annette André in her first appearance in The Saint) approaches The Saint at the Savoy Plaza hotel bar in London and shows him a letter threatening her life if she sees Hobart Quennel (Geoffrey Keen) this evening. Her father has created \"Process G\" - a new way of producing synthetic fibres. Simon thinks it is all a hoax - until he finds that he needs to take it seriously and follows her to Quennel's house where two \"police officers\" are attempting a kidnapping, which Simon foils. Quennel has a very large company which has been looking at the new process but has not made a bid for it. At Quennel's house the door is answered by Andrea (Justine Lord), whilst Quennel states that the process is worthless.\n\nNOTE: This is the first time in the series where Simon \"introduces\" himself before the halo appears on the screen before the credits. Continuing the James Bond connections, Keen played Defence Minister Sir Frederick Gray in 6 Bond films (5 with Moore) between 1977-1987.\n\n467\"The Loving Brothers\"19 November 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Ray Barrett, Reg Lye, Ed Devereaux, Annette Andre, Betty McDowall, Grant Taylor, Dick Bentley, John Tate\n\nSomewhere in the great Australian outback outside the Kinsall mine, the Saint's Land Rover suffers a broken feed pipe and a passing Linda Henderson (Annette André) tows him to a nearby settlement for repairs. Pop Kinsall (Reg Lye) reckons there is more silver down that mine. In O'Shea's bar, Simon gets some background on Willy and Wally Kinsell - Pop's sons whom he has not seen for 15 years. Pop is desperate as he needs 3000 quid urgently to meet the next payment on the mine lease.\n\n478\"The Man Who Liked Toys\"26 November 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: John Paul, Maurice Kaufmann, Jeanne Moody, John Baskcomb, Inigo Jackson\n\nLewis Enstone (John Baskcomb) is thought to be the subject of blackmail, at least according to his secretary, Claire Wheeler. He is regularly taking cash out of the bank and she does not know why; after all, £750 a week is more than a mistress might cost. Claire asks the Saint to investigate - but we soon become aware that Lewis is not on good terms with his wife Marjorie (Jeanne Moody), and when Lewis Enstone dies, there is a need to investigate the suicide - or was it murder? Harry Duggan (David Lodge) is a firebrand union leader of a strike at Costello and Hammel which Lewis wants to acquire.\n\n489\"The Death Penalty\"3 December 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Wanda Ventham, Paul Stassino, Brewster Mason, Arnold Diamond, William Marlowe, Alan Curtis\n\nThe Saint was passing through Marseille until a nail in his tyre delayed him; as he tries to depart, a man dies in front of his car, dying from a bullet wound. The city is under the control of the Latini a local crime syndicate to which the dead man had links. Simon finds a beautiful blonde, Laura Stride (Wanda Ventham), striding along the highway in the mountains, and returns her home. How are these events linked? Colonel Latignant (Arnold Diamond), as ever in the south of France, is on hand to provide the narrative links. the dead man is Suza who ran much of the Latini operations locally.\n\nNOTE: More James Bond Film Connections: Paul Stassino would play two roles in 1965's \"Thunderball\". Arnold Diamond was in an uncredited role in the Bond spoof \"Casino Royale\" in 1967.\n\n4910\"The Imprudent Politician\"10 December 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Anthony Bate, Justine Lord, Michael Gough, Jeremy Burnham, Mike Pratt, Jean Marsh, Moray Watson, John Bryans, Jimmy Gardner\n\nIt appears that the Minister for International Trade, Christoper Waites (Anthony Bate), has been leaking information to his mistress, Denise Grant (Justine Lord). He is planning a major speech on Monday which will double the price of certain companies and the blackmailers, Tim Burton (Jeremy Burnham) and Alex Morgan (Mike Pratt), just want to know who will benefit so that they can invest now and cash in on Monday - before returning the letter to Denise which they currently hold and no one will be any the wiser. Luckily, the minister has the Saint as a house guest for the weekend.\n\n5011\"The Hi-Jackers\"17 December 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Walter Gotell, Ingrid Schoeller, Neil McCallum, Shane Rimmer, Michael Collins, Richard Shaw\n\nSimon is enjoying the Oktoberfest in Munich, whilst we see an empty army truck being stolen and then gaining new number plates. It appears that the gang stealing the truck have designs on cigarettes and liquor under the control of the US Third Army Corps - and have someone on the inside who can provide the keys to the store: Mathilde Baum (Ingrid Schoeller), who spends the evening with the Saint at the funfair.\n\nNOTES: Plenty of James Bond connections in this episode. Rimmer played uncredited roles in 1971's \"Diamonds are Forever\" and 1973's \"Live and Let Die\" and playing Commander Carter in 1977's \"The Spy Who Loved Me\". Collins was always used as Gert Frobe's English dubbing voice, including \"Goldfinger\". Bond fans definitely know Gotell, who played Morzeny in \"From Russia With Love\" but was more known for playing KGB boss General Anatol Gogol from \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" through 1987's \"The Living Daylights\", which includes five of Moore's Bond films.\n\n5112\"The Unkind Philanthropist\"24 December 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Charles Farrell, David Graham, Sarah Brackett\n\nThe Saint is driving in Puerto Rico when he is stopped by a woman who says her husband, Juan, is about to be killed. When Simon Templar reaches the farm, he finds two thugs trying to evict the farmer, who has signed an agreement for a loan which he cannot repay. He also crosses the path of Miss Tristan Brown (Sarah Brackett) whom it seems has money to give away to the local poor people on behalf of a foundation ... except that to qualify for a gift, you have to give Ms. Brown $20,000. In a restaurant, Simon overhears Juan seeking more time from Elmer Quire (Charles Farrell) who is playing hardball over the loan -- and interestingly Mr. Quire is one of the potential recipients of a grant from the foundation.\n\n5213\"The Damsel in Distress\"31 December 1964 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Catherine Woodville, John Bluthal, Paul Whitsun-Jones, Ray Austin\n\nAn Italian restaurateur, Allessandro Naccaro, has a problem - his daughter has a child but no husband, as the miscreant Guiseppe Rolfiere has fled the country with both his secretary Barbara Astral (Katherine Woodville) and £1m from the Apex Building Society; it is a matter of grand larceny, according to Chief Inspector Teal, who is charged with the investigation. Rolfieri has been spotted in Florence and the Naccaro family want him returned to London to marry the daughter before he is murdered, whilst the police were unable to extradite him and so they would also welcome his presence on British soil by underhand means were it possible. Rolfieri is looking for a chauffeur - a job entirely suited to the capabilities of the Saint.\n\n5314\"The Contract\"7 January 1965 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Robert Hutton, Elizabeth Weaver, John Bennett, Richard Easton, Michael Peake; directed by Roger Moore\n\nReturning home, as most people are going to work, Simon Templar is initially the subject of a murder attempt as a car drives at him.

Fish (Christopher Benjamin) is a somewhat dubious antiques dealer with links to Thandrel's illicit business activities.\n\n1079\"The House on Dragon's Rock\"24 November 1968 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Anthony Bate, Annette Andre, Alex Scott, Mervyn Johns, Talfryn Thomas, Glyn Houston, David Garfield, Daffyd Havard, Peter Lawrence, Reg Pritchard; directed by Roger Moore\n\nWith quite a few establishing shots in Wales, it feels less studio-bound, and the story also marks a diversion into science fiction territory for The Saint, who is investigating the disappearance of a shepherd, Owen Thomas (Talfryn Thomas), who reappears with a torn coat and lash marks on his chest. The local residents think it is the supernatural, but a nearby research establishment run by Dr. Sardon (Anthony Bate) and his assistant and niece Carmen Grant (Annette Andre) is also raising suspicion.\n\n10810\"The Scales of Justice\"1 December 1968 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Andrew Keir, Jean Marsh, Mark Burns, Gillian Lind, John Barron, Geoffrey Chater, Ronald Leigh-Hunt, Victor Maddern, John Boxer, Brian Badcoe\n\nThe Directors of Combined Holdings are being murdered after receiving a postcard warning that they are next, and five of them have died in five months. Gilbert Kirby (Andrew Keir) receives a card indicating that he is next – on the day on which he becomes Lord Mayor of London.

Victor Maddern appears as Jim Cowdry, valet and driver to Sir John Mulliner.\n\n10911\"The Fiction Makers: Part I\"8 December 1968 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Sylvia Syms, Kenneth J. Warren, Justine Lord, Philip Locke, Roy Boyd, Graham Armitage, Lila Kaye, Anthony Blackshaw, Roy Hanlon, Nicholas Smith, Tom Clegg, Ralph Ball, Richard Davies\n\nAlthough originally edited and shown as two episodes, this is not included in the ITV4 reruns of The Saint. The writer Amos Klein (Sylvia Sims) has written some interesting plots and they have been spotted by Warlock (Kenneth J. Warren), who wants to enter a highly secret and secure complex, Hermetico, using names and characters based on the fiction of Klein plus the skills of the author to ensure a perfect break-in and escape. Due to mistaken identities, Warlock thinks that the Saint is the author and she is merely his secretary.\n\n11012\"The Fiction Makers: Part II\"15 December 1968 ( ) 11113\"The People Importers\"22 December 1968 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Neil Hallett, Susan Travers, Imogen Hassall, Ray Lonnen, Kevork Malikyan, Ron Pember, Michael Robbins, Joan Newell, Julian Sherrier, Nik Zaran, John Garvin\n\nHarry (Michael Robbins) has taken Simon Templar on an angling expedition when a 30ft motor boat passes them dangerously close.

Warren) who offers him even more money – to prevent his daughter, Jenny (Judee Morton), from being killed. Kersh treats his assistant / office boy, Arnie Garnett (Warren Stanhope) quite badly. By the time this was aired, Warren Stanhope had already appeared on Coronation Street whilst John Savident, who plays a special effects maestro here, would not appear there, I say, would not appear there, for some years yet.\n\n11315\"Vendetta for the Saint: Part I\"5 January 1969 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Ian Hendry, Fulton Mackay, Peter Kristof, Derek Sydney, Gábor Baraker\n\nFirst of a two-part episode based on the novel, Vendetta for the Saint. In a nightclub in Naples Simon witnesses a meeting between \"Dino Cartelli\" (Ian Hendry) and James Euston (Fulton Mackay), former colleagues at a bank who were once close friends. The subsequent death of Euston means the Saint commences an investigation into Al Destamio (Ian Hendry), who resides on Capri, where Simon is met by Lily (Aimi MacDonald) in a bright red MG. Later in Sicily Simon is driving the same bright red MG!\n\n11416\"Vendetta for the Saint: Part II\"12 January 1969 ( ) 11517\"The Ex-King of Diamonds\"19 January 1969 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Ronald Radd, Isla Blair, Stuart Damon, Paul Stassino, Willoughby Goddard, Alan Rowe, Jeremy Young, Derek Smee, Hugh Morton\n\nArriving in Nice, Simon is approached by a man who hands over a bright yellow open top Rolls-Royce. The story is very much secondary to the interplay between the Saint and Rod Huston (Stuart Damon – one of the Champions) as a test of the format which would apply to the forthcoming show The Persuaders! with which many of the team would be involved. The ex-King of Slavonia (Willoughby Goddard) is keen to win at cards tonight to pay for a revolution; Henri Flambeau (Ronald Radd) and his daughter Janine (Isla Blair) need to pay the bills whilst others just want to win big!\n\n11618\"The Man who Gambled with Life\"26 January 1969 ( )\n\nGuest cast: Clifford Evans, Veronica Carlson, Jayne Sofiano, Steven Berkoff, John D.
