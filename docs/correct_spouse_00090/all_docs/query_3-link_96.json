        "text": "1790 – 1880 AD\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nTHE NAKED CHRONOLOGY\n\nHorsham 1790-1815\n\nHORSHAM IN THE REVOLUTIONARY ERA\n\nIn 1789 the French Revolution started in France. In Horsham, the Duke of Norfolk, Robert Hurst and Thomas Medwin were secretly negotiating their own revolution: the taking back of the burgesses into the sphere of political power, from the influence of the Irwin family. Both revolutions were based on ideas and on notions of liberty. Norfolk’s on the liberty expressed and defined in the Magna Charta, and in manorial law; whilst in France it was the removal of the French versions of these very manorial customs and duties. In France, the culmination of stage one of the Revolution was the execution of the King and Queen in 1793, which saw a fracturing of society and notions of sovereignty. The Norfolk’s revolution culminated a year earlier in 1792 when the sovereignty of parliament was obeyed, the usurpation of power quashed, and Norfolk’s Horsham MPs were forced to resign.\n\nIn France, the second stage of the Revolution saw the revolutionary leaders turn on themselves and a constant state of revolt occurred. In Horsham, the revolution carried on, but inside a framework of law, so therefore it has not been seen as revolutionary. But it was, because, in effect, Norfolk was trying, and to a large extent succeeding, in turning back the clock to the medieval period. Norfolk was now using medieval laws to ensure his control of the town was absolute. Laws which had slowly been forgotten, or neglected, were now resurrected by his men in Horsham and he used the law to achieve his goal; for example, the right to a horse, the deal with the War Department over the barracks, fines for commons etc.\n\nThe Horsham the Duke was now trying to control was a town that lay between the bustling, growing seaside resort of Brighton and the rapidly-growing London. The turnpiking of the roads led rapidly to increased coach traffic. By 1775 there were six stagecoaches between Horsham and London a week, and a post office and postmaster are recorded in 1769 (a thrice-weekly service was mentioned in 1678). Whilst the town was connected by mail and turnpike roads, it was not on the canal network. In 1787, the Wey and Arun built a wharf at Newbridge near Billingshurst (which was the end of the navigable part of the river Arun.[1]) But Horsham could not get an extension built. In 1790, the trading success of Horsham was tied to the road (in 1785, balloon flight had been tried, with Rear admiral Sir Edward Vernon and Count Zambeccari leaving Tottenham Court Road at 4pm and crashing in a field just outside Horsham an hour or so later).\n\nHorsham society was evolving, with ties being formed amongst people with related interests but not necessarily family ties. This had occurred first of all through religious beliefs, (Catholics, then Quakers, Baptists, Methodists etc); now it was spreading to social beliefs with the creation of societies to help each other, mutual self-help groups. This development marks the growth of social differentiation, the growing awareness that your concerns might not be the same as your neighbours. As we will see later, it then spread to groups such as book groups and then down to agriculture and horticulture, but that is taking us well in to the 19th century. The first notable one was The Prosecuting Society, formed in 1784, mentioned above. This was followed two years later by the Horsham Society for the Benefit of Widows; both worked on the benefit of members rather than the town as a whole, the latter being a type of insurance organisation, so ensuring widows were not turned out of home and into the workhouse.[2] Set out below are the articles of the Society which show how it operated.\n\nBoth these Societies were based on the notion of risk aversion, helping to spread risk. Another society, club, team, that was formed during this period was the Horsham cricket team, whilst the Bell ringers were also an early society. As no constitution or rules for these two groups have been found, it is difficult to know how they viewed themselves. The fact that none have been found suggests that the association was quite fluid, whereas the Prosecuting and Widow organisation had a very tight structure, possibly because they dealt with money. What can be said, though, with certainty is that Horsham was a town where societies and organisations could grow and develop.\n\nAs these societies sprang up, it was not long before the business world would cotton on to the success that a locally well-supported network of help based on income could provide. (The Turnpike trusts had shown how successful raising revenue on projected income could be. But the trustees were not all drawn from the town, but from towns and landowners through which the road went.) Within five years Horsham had its first Bank, the Horsham Bank, in 1791. The partners were Thomas Hansen, Samuel Shergold, Thomas Scutt, Stephen and John Rice and John Lanham.[3]\n\nToday we take banks for granted, yet they are a comparatively recent phenomenon and at the time of writing Tesco, the supermarket chain, has just announced record profits for 2004; one area which provided those profits was its financial and banking section. However, John Lanham was there first, for his main trade was as a grocer who then diversified into banking, rather like the supermarkets, promoting his banking interests when selling groceries.[4] Before Horsham Bank appeared, how could budding entrepreneurs raise funds to expand? They could save, but there was no interest paid on savings stored under the bed. They could sell parts of the business, they could go into partnership, and they could on certain items raise subscriptions, as for example on the Evers book mentioned above, and so spread the risk and cost.\n\nAnother way to raise money was to mortgage their property. But there was no building society, and the mortgage would be done with another individual. For example, Bysshe Shelley was, according to his letters to Robert Hurst, always on the lookout for making money by lending money at a high rate of interest. One such was a tripartite mortgage agreement in 1799, when he lent to William Hammond, landlord of the Lamb Inn together with the widow of Captain Draper, Elizabeth Draper, £600, followed by a further £200 in 1806. By 1815 the mortgage was still worth £546.5s (loan and interest).[5] This of course was only possible to prove if you had the title deed to the property, and if that title was to a burgage plot, you also had the right to vote.\n\nWith the competition between Norfolk and Irwin there was rampant property inflation. This happened with the old gaol. The dilapidated building that had been a running sore on the expense account of the county was sold in 1782 at auction to Lady Irwin for £620. (It was then discovered that it should not have been sold without an Act of Parliament, which was duly passed in 1787.) The building was then used as a schoolhouse. When Norfolk wanted to gain control of the town, the prices of burgage properties rose substantially.[6]\n\nThe Horsham Bank was the first attempt to make a pool of money available that was not tied to property but to projected income. It was using the mechanics of the Turnpike Act for everyday purpose. The Horsham Bank was the first business set up in Horsham that involved multiple partners. Whilst lawyers need to know the law in order to prosecute the cases and offer advice, with the Bank all they had to do was lend money, fix a rate of interest and get a return; they did not necessarily take equity on the property. In that sense it was probably the first business in Horsham that actually produced nothing, nor relied on any assets. However, this was probably its downfall. The lawyer relies on knowledge of the law; that is his main asset; the banker should (as they do today with the “subject to status” clause) assess the risk of the individual, whether they will default on payment, and the risk of the money markets changing, and thus fix a rate of interest that is high enough, or flexible enough. Horsham Bank did none of this and so within two years was literally bankrupt.\n\nIn the year of its foundation, in 1791, M. Pintosh issued a Horsham token with the sign of the anchor and the monarch’s head on the back with the motto “long live the king”. However, recent research has shown that, unlike the 17th century tokens, the Pintosh token is a fake (See Elaboration at the end). The fact that no tokens were issued suggests one or all of the following: the need for small change was slight in Horsham, reflecting a stagnating trading situation, a declining market, or that the demand for small change was being met by tokens being issued from other town’s traders; perhaps even London, reflecting the widespread trading links; or trust in the worth and status of Horsham was so low that no-one would accept any coin issued from a Horsham trader. If two years later the bank collapses, what does that say for the creditworthiness of the town? Tokens, more than any other coin, were directly tied to trust, for it was not legal tender, though it was not illegal tender either; it simply relied on people agreeing its value.\n\nBy the 1790s, Horsham had become a centre of a network of turnpiked roads that enabled it to exploit a hinterland. (In 1787 it was commented on that the turnpiking of the Dorking to Horsham road enabled Horsham’s Saturday market to attract much of Dorking’s corn trade[8]. The first wave of turnpiking had ceased by around 1772, though subsequent Acts were passed for improving the roads already turnpiked. In effect, by 1775 the road network had been established. However, the use of the waterways for transporting goods had hardly developed beyond that of “correcting” river courses.\n\nThe Arun at Horsham was too shallow for barge traffic which could only get as far as Newbridge near Billingshurst. By 1790 Horsham was beginning to notice a decline in trade. In November of that year it was agreed to see if the weekly beast and cattle market granted to John Wicker and established in 1705 could be resurrected.[9] The market had failed previously and there was no certainty that it would succeed this time, other than the fact that Medwin was now involved in it and he had the ear of the Duke of Norfolk. It became apparent, not only to those in Horsham, but also to national manufacturers, that if Horsham could be linked to the growing network of waterways then Horsham could function as an inland port. All they had to do was make the Arun navigable. On 9 July 1792 a packed Town Hall heard the first plan to make the Arun navigable from Newbridge to Weald Cross, Slinfold[10]. This was a relatively cheap option; however, it did not really provide the solution they wanted, so the great canal builder and surveyor John Rennie was commissioned to make a survey from Newbridge to Farthing Bridge, a mile further upstream, on the main Guildford to Horsham road. The estimated cost was £18,133. Subscribers were sought to fund it and soon £15,000 was raised. Amongst the subscribers were the Wedgwood family who obviously saw the attraction of transporting their china and earthenware by canal rather than over the roads, though their subscription of £3,000 by varying amounts from the brothers suggests also a clear commercial money lending decision rather than just a manufacturing one, a decision that probably reflected Horsham Bank’s investment and those who invested from London.\n\nThe creation of a new market and the thought of increased trade brought by the canal probably encouraged the town to make sure its market was well run, following best practice, and if that meant buying a new brass bushel measure for the Clerk of the Market so be it, so in November Horsham had its official measures,[11] which are now on display in the Museum. Horsham could offer a well-regulated, trustworthy market.\n\nIn February 1793, the following year, a bill for this was presented to the House of Lords for Horsham Navigation and soon Horsham would be connected by water to the ports in the south. Except it didn’t happen. The scheme could only work by using the river Arun. The latter part of the River Arun was controlled by The Arun Navigation and agreements could not be reached. The scheme went into liquidation in 1794, though its apparent desirability was obvious to all including William Marshall who in his Rural Economy of the Southern Counties promoted the extension of the Arun to Horsham either by improving the river or cutting a canal across the vale through Billingshurst. In fact, there were a number of canal schemes proposed for which the West Sussex Record Office hold plans. There was one from New Bridge to Farthing Bridge dated 30 September 1811 and another for the same year for a proposed “Merstham and Newbridge canal …at Newbridge”. This scheme involved creating a reservoir in St Leonard’s Forest and Tilgate as well as creating an aqueduct over the waste-water stream from Warnham Ponds. A year later another plan was drawn up from the Wey and Arun to Broadbridge Heath.[13]\n\nAlthough we don’t know exactly when, we can say for certain that by 1794 St Leonard’s Fair had moved from St Leonard’s Forest onto Horsham common[14] where it sold mainly Welsh cattle. The Fair was first recorded in 1438, when it may have been established to sell wild horses. By 1441 and later, it was held on St Leonard’s day (6 November), but after the calendar change in 1752 it moved to 17 November. In 1608 it was described as being held on Booth’s land and in 1724 as being held in Mannings Heath By this time the Fair did not sell just livestock, but also items such as stockings which were recorded as being bought in 1717 by the farmer Thomas Merchant[15].\n\nBefore the collapse of the canal scheme; and possibly partly the cause of it, in 1793 France had become a Republic and declared war on Europe. Whilst the French Revolution had been stirring up the intellectual foment of European thinkers, the governments of the day were concerned but not unduly threatened. The King had issued a proclamation “for the suppression of wicked and seditious writing” which the townsfolk had supported at a meeting in the Town Hall in July 1792,[16] but there was little sign of political agitation. Now, with the execution of the Royal family, panic spread, with the other royal families demanding a lid to be put on the revolution. England, which had started the century in a European war, was ending the century in one also, and within the 90-odd years, England had become Britain and was now the dominant power in Europe; economically, technologically and militarily.\n\nHORSHAM AT WAR\n\nIn 2000 Horsham Museum marked the Bicentenary of the founding at Horsham of the Rifle Brigade, the world’s first. At their foundation in March 1800, they were known as the Experimental Corps of Riflemen, changing to the 95th Rifle Regiment, and it was this Regiment that a fictional character, Richard Sharpe, created by Bernard Cornwell, joined. He gave the exhibition the title “Sharpe’s Horsham”. The exhibition drew on the Medwin archives to create a story of Horsham during the years of the French Revolutionary and then Napoleonic Wars. In the exhibition I used all the legal papers and other documents to create a series of newspaper-style stories. They have never been published, but were well-received as a way of making dry legal documents interesting. So whilst the style is different from the normal history book, they are included here in the mini essay at the end of this chapter. The following boxes set the scene for what is recounted below.\n\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY WARS 1792 to 1815 – An Outline\n\nThe wars were fought in short, sharp attacks and battles rather than stretched-out warfare. This is because the French could not sustain long periods of warfare. The soldiers were not paid, but lived off the land they marched through. Once an area had been taken over, the French army stripped it bare and new revolutionary governments were set up.\n\nSussex was Britain’s frontline during these wars, with temporary barracks and supply depots being constructed across the county.\n\nThe wars can be summed up by three coalitions between European powers against France in 1793-96, 1799-1801 and 1805-14. The coalitions were organised by the British with Austria, Prussia (modern Germany) and Russia supplying the troops. Unfortunately, the coalitions did not last long because the coalition partners often had a different agenda from the British.\n\nFIRST COALITION 1793-96\n\nRussia made little contribution to the war effort, as it had taken over Poland and was dealing with absorbing that territory. Prussia dropped out in 1795 for the same reason. This left Austria, which ruled the Netherlands and northern Italy, to face a French attack. The Spanish changed sides in 1795-6, leaving Britain isolated with just the navy to defend its shores and empire.\n\nSECOND COALITION 1799-1801\n\nThis coalition was made possible by a new Tsar in Russia who was eager to play a larger role in Europe. The Russian army managed to recapture most of Austria and Italy before Napoleon retook the area. Unfortunately, the Tsar was assassinated, leaving Britain isolated again. The Continental allies made peace in 1801. This was followed by a Peace treaty with Britain in 1802 that lasted for less than a year.\n\nTHIRD COALITION 1805 -1814\n\nThis war started with the naval Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, in which Horsham-born John Pilfold captained the Ajax. It was this decisive battle that ensured British naval supremacy and stopped a French invasion. Unfortunately, on land, Napoleon destroyed each of his enemies in turn. Vienna, Berlin and Warsaw were soon in French hands. In July 1807 a Peace treaty was brokered between Russia, Prussia and France, leaving Britain isolated for the third time.\n\nThe British fought back, waging a naval war against French trade. The British also moved into Portugal and Spain in 1808, making their civil wars into an international war which Napoleon could not muster enough forces to subdue. One by one the allies began to rejoin the Coalition. The Russians grew tired of the French and joined with Sweden against France. In 1812 Napoleon put 600,000 troops on the Russian border with Poland and decided to take Moscow. It was a bad decision, as his army was stretched out over 500 miles, the Russian winter was severe and the Cossacks had a scorched-earth policy. Napoleon fled, and fewer than 1 in 20 of his men survived. The campaigns of 1813-1814 were decided more by logistics than great military strategy. In April 1814, with the British, Russians and Prussians camped in Paris, Napoleon abdicated. The war was over.\n\nTHE PEACE OF 1814\n\nNews of Napoleon’s abdication travelled slowly. Wellington was still fighting Soult, the French commander, six days after Napoleon had abdicated! Some two months later, in June, Corfu’s Imperial garrison only surrendered when a British frigate called on them to do so.\n\nTHE ONE HUNDRED DAYS\n\nIn February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba where he had been sent in exile. Within three weeks he had won over Marshal Ney who had been sent to capture him, and had entered Paris in triumph forcing Louis XVIII to flee. Within three months he was threatening the forces of the Coalition.\n\nOn 16 June he defeated the Prussians, but they managed to regroup. On 18 June he attacked the British led by Wellington at Waterloo near Brussels. After a day of unending slaughter, the Prussians, riding over the horizon, played the decisive blow. On 22 June Napoleon abdicated and on 15 July, a fugitive at Rochefort, he surrendered. He was taken to Plymouth and then to exile on the island of St Helena.\n\nThe Duke of Norfolk, who had seen his two candidates for the election of 1790 be selected and then rejected on appeal in 1792 by the House of Commons, decided to let nature take its course. Francis Viscountess Irwin was now 58 years old, and by biding his time he could see the town become his; either through default, lack of political ambition by her inheritors, or by behind-the-scenes negotiation.\n\nIt must be remembered that the Duke of Norfolk was playing the “long game”; he was someone who planned ahead; he, after all, virtually project-managed the long-term rebuilding of Arundel Castle; his interest in history could give him a sense of perspective. So whilst it may be seen as not doing anything, it was probably his game plan. Granted, if he was successful in his first election at Horsham he would have accepted a “quick kill”, but in reality he probably expected a long-term fight on his hands, gradually clawing back political power, and that is the reason why, come the next election, he let things ride. He would, with the help of his steward, continue to re-establish his manorial and legal rights. Add to that Norfolk’s interest in genealogy; it was he who financed the great Dallaway’s History of Sussex.\n\nHe would have been aware that Viscount Irwin only had daughters. The estate would go to the daughters and whomever they married. The eldest daughter, Ann, had married Lord Viscount Beauchamp, who would become Marquis of Hartford. Isabella was the beauty of Georgian society and known social hostess in the circles in which Norfolk would mix; a circle that included the Prince of Wales, a man whom Norfolk would count as a friend. (It was said that Ann persuaded the Prince to accept the restricted Regency when his father was incapacitated; obviously taking after her mother in astute counselling). Norfolk would have known the Hartford family would inherit the Irwin estates; a statement of fact made implicitly clear in her father’s will issued on his death in 1778, two years before Isabella’s marriage, that Hartford had to take the Ingram name before their family name in order to acquire title. All he had to do was maintain his friendship and await his time[17].\n\nThe added factor in the planning was the political turmoil in France which was spreading into England, causing some to question the validity of any election where the vast majority could not vote. Norfolk believed in the radicalism of conservatism, rather than liberalism. Doing political battle in Horsham would draw attention to the iniquities of the system and also to the fact that Norfolk was trying to recreate the “ancient regime” of Medieval England in 18th century Horsham. So after the excitement amongst the few, in 1792 Horsham politically went to sleep and no need to concern with Horsham’s history for at least 20 years or more. The election became a 152-page account written in Volume II of Frazer’s Controverted Elections, along with Steyning, that featured in the same volume. The account is particularly interesting as it contains a map identifying all the burgage properties. This information was provided by Medwin.\n\nThe 1790s saw a rapid rise in prices, rampant inflation and falling wheat production caused by bad harvests, as noticed as illustrated by the bread supply problems mentioned in the various correspondence.[18] This would have led to a decline in trade in Horsham markets; particularly corn. Some of this could have been ameliorated by the increased productivity brought about by continued investment in agricultural improvements. The Shelley family of Field Place were noted for their interest in selective breeding;[19] these were, after all, the years in which Southdown sheep were, through selective breeding, growing in popularity.[20] However, it was the arrival of the barracks in Horsham that saved the town and neighbouring area. By 1796 the war against the revolutionary army was going badly, in that the First Coalition established by Britain had fallen apart, leaving Britain isolated. The Government set up a Barracks Department with a plan to establish 23 barracks in Sussex, making it a militarised zone as it had been some 800 years earlier. However, this time it was the Government rather than the King directing the effort, though still using the Lords to administer the finer details. Horsham had one of the largest barracks in the county. In September, a lease was signed for 21 years with Treadcroft for the land.[21] This might suggest that the War Office expected the war to last that length of time or, more likely, it was the shortest amount of time that Nathaniel would lease the land for.\n\nThe barracks lay under what are now the houses in Worthing Road and Horsham Cricket club, with “Barrick Field” being used for shooting practice. Costing £60,000, they were not cheap, and the investment of that magnitude was made to be in constant use. The Barracks could take 960 men in total (though on occasion, overcrowding was noted in 1813).[22] Each regiment stayed for around three months at a time, and at least 69 regiments were stationed in Horsham.[23] In effect, Horsham, whose population in the urban area in 1801 was recorded in the census as 1,539,[24] saw its population increase by 50% for the period 1796 to 1800, in 1804 and then from 1807, to 1814. Importantly, it was a population of young men, with few attachments, who were drawing the income in, not recirculating the money within the community. In addition, money was also coming in from the Government, who had to feed and clothe the soldiers. John Brown, a draper who lived in West Street, wrote a memorandum about this time in Horsham, but the memorandum was written many years later in America. Brown suggests that £1,000 a week was being pumped into the Horsham economy, and this was new money, not money drawn from the community of Horsham and then spent within Horsham. It cannot be underestimated how much this money saved Horsham.\n\nIt should also be remembered that the government was in the process of introducing, or had already introduced, a number of taxes, not on income; that would occur later, but on goods and services. As a contemporary satirical poem of the day had it:\n\n“Should foreigners staring at English taxation\n\nAsk why we still reckon ourselves a free nation,\n\nWe’ll tell ‘em, we pay for the light of the sun,\n\nFor a horse with a saddle-to trot or to run;\n\nFor writing our names;- for the flash of a gun;\n\nFor the flame of a candle to cheer the dark night;\n\nFor the hole in the house, if it lets in the light;\n\nFor births, weddings and deaths; for our selling and buying;\n\nTho’ some think ‘tis hard to pay threepence for dying…;\n\nOne would think there’s not room one new impost to put,\n\nFrom the crown of his head to the sole of his foot.\n\nLike Job, this John Bull his condition deplores\n\nVery patient indeed, and all covered with sores”,\n\nBilly Budget [25]\n\nThe impact of these taxes on candles, on windows (whose effect can still be seen today in Georgian houses with blocked-up windows), on soap, on watches (which led to the making of the Parliamentary Clocks; those large-faced clocks that hung in pubs enabling people to see the time from the street and of which the Museum has a fine example), and other products, such as a tax on bricks (see below), would have had an effect on Horsham market and town in restricting trade. The £1,000 a week bought in by the army was even more keenly required.\n\nThe quality of the barracks was commented on in a contemporary 1797 account: “I cannot say much praise of the Barracks at Horsham, they appear to be Miserable ill built places and must be wretchedly cold in Winter”[26]. Ann Jemima Clough (which suggests that the £60,000 cost didn’t buy quality, unlike some of the military architecture of the period). Though it should be noted that the buildings were of such a standard that they were taken down at the end of the war and re-used, and two are at least still in use today.[27]\n\n1798 was the year that income tax was introduced as a wartime measure, paid at 10% of income over £200 per year. It was also the year that Horsham, as a town, decided to get involved in the war effort; perhaps some degree of shame came into play, of Horsham having a military barrack in the town but no-one to defend the town itself, except the expectation that the soldiers would do so. As a letter written at the time by Sarah Hurst to Robert, who was then probably thinking of buying Park House, this notion was clearly prevalent at the time. “What can poor Horsham have done to you, if you dislike its military populousness, who ever ran away from their defenders: surely those shou’d not who have families & fortunes to protect”[28]. Though it was more likely because of the sense of panic brought about by the Government considering, and then passing, the Defence of the Counties Act which proposed the mass evacuation of the entire population except for able-bodied men if there had been an invasion. This plan had been brought about by the realisation that by the end of March 1798 the French had enough boats to transport 70,000 men[29].\n\nIt had taken exactly four years for Horsham to respond to the call first made on 1 May 1794 for able-bodied Sussex men to volunteer to defend their county. On 1 May 1798 a meeting was held at the Town Hall when it was unanimously resolved that all those capable of bearing arms should form an “association” for the “preservation of public peace and the protection of lives and property”. One corps of cavalry and one of infantry would be trained and exercised twice a week. The cavalry would defend the countryside in a ten-mile radius of the town; the infantry within a five-mile radius. Services to be given free but the Government would provide uniform and arms.\n\nIn all, twenty joined the Cavalry under the leadership of Timothy Shelley of Field Place, and 66 joined an infantry under commander of General Leland of Strood Park. Though by 11 May, doubts were expressed if they could make the “Loyal Horsham Volunteers respectable”[30], On 20 May, Timothy decided he had better things to do, so he claimed to the Duke of Richmond, Lord Lieutenant, that he could not find enough “persons composed of the better classes of the Community”[31]. Whilst Timothy was backing away, his friend Sir Cecil Bishop of Parham personally raised and equipped a troop of yeomanry in 1798. Perhaps the fear of invasion subsided by the middle of May; so, with it, the imperative to act.\n\nWhilst the need to raise a militia diminished, it did not stop the march of the statisticians. An audit, though then called a survey, was carried out parish by parish identifying what was available by subscription, not demand, if an invasion occurred.\n\nThe Parish of Horsham was the second largest in West Sussex, covering a total area of 17.3 square miles. It included the now separate parishes of Southwater, Roffey and Broadbridge Heath as well as parts of Rusper, Faygate and Lower Beeding. Whilst the schedules identified materials available by subscription, they do give some, even if hazy, indication of the movable wealth of the area.\n\nSchedule 1: Livestock and transport\n\nSchedule 2: Removal of livestock\n\nSchedule 3: Arms and men (in effect, volunteers)\n\nSchedule 4: Men employed to be “pioneers” (to damage road and bridges)\n\nSchedule 6 (5 is missing:) Transport\n\nThe amount of data collected in these and other schedules took over two years to process, so was not reported on to the County until 13 August 1801 when it was decided that the whole clearance of the county was not possible. It would require over 50,000 wagons to remove grain and hay.[32] Whilst identifying the amount of stock subscribed to, i.e. allowed to be taken, the audit does reveal that Horsham Parish was quite an agricultural one still, with a large number of sheep. It also backs up the apathy of local people to fight.\n\nWe get a good look at Horsham in 1799[33], as it was described in some detail in a book written by James Edward, a land surveyor, publisher and engraver who wrote Companion from London to Brighthelmston which he published in several parts from 1796 onwards, with the Horsham section written in 1799. The publication relied on the same techniques first promoted by Pope at the beginning of the century, using subscribers to fund the production cost, with Horsham having over 20 subscribers. It is not a travel book, nor is it really a guidebook to the town. It does describe the route in and out of Horsham, but the buildings that are identified are more as spatial markers for verbal directions for those who can not read maps.\n\nThe book is a literal and geographical map that concerned itself with travelling through a landscape, a landscape that was also part of the people’s memories, and those memories litter the descriptions of the houses and buildings. And just as memories can be misleading, so are those comments and the spellings given. The description of Horsham reads as if Mr Edwards’ route through Horsham had been decided on by having identified subscribers who, for vanity reasons, would want to be mentioned. He then asked passers-by for information about prominent houses; those spatial markers, and they told him what they could remember, including spelling of names.\n\nEdward gives an historical account of Horsham that is at odds with what was known at the time. His opening paragraph states that Horsham was a lordship of the Howards “till forfeited to the crown”; that might be true, but the Howards did recover it and, at the time the book was written, the Duke was aggressively trying to maintain the ownership of the town (see above). He goes on to describe the church as an “elegant and spacious building, and the hall where the assizes for the county are often held very commodious”. This compares which what we know: the church was in very poor state of repair as described by previous travellers, and the hall was in need of a rebuild some 12 years later. As for the comment “Here is a well endowed free school”, this was patently an untruth; a school so badly-endowed as to be non-existent, with a headmaster claiming £30 a year, but not having any pupils. This account is what we would today call “spin”, and what at that time was called puffery; to ‘puff’ was to exaggerate in order to sell a place.\n\nHaving said that, the book does have some interesting comments. The Dog and Bacon pub was called the Dog and Beacon, because “Dog and” was a correcting of a phonetic word for Dorking: the pub was actually then called The Dorking Beacon. In the account for Denne Park House, he mentions the avenue of trees and “a fine painting of Lord Stafford”, but not the large portrait that was mentioned in the previous description of the house in 1723 which now hangs in the Museum. One of the longest descriptions in the book concerns a lost mansion of Horsham, probably more than the building of the barracks; it was this house that caused the greatest gossip in the town as it was a mansion built but never lived in.\n\nIt would appear that Bysshe Shelley (the poet’s grandfather) had pulled down Warnham Place and then erected a “spacious brick edifice”, with neither offices or stables, “and the new erect mansion stood many years without having an inhabitant; and about four years since was entirely pulled down”, with the materials sent to Gorring to build his new mansion near Worthing. He describes this story in detail yet, when he visited, the building no longer existed, except a stable block on which he hangs the story. The stable block had been built by John Shelley, Bysshe’s brother (see above) for a mansion that he planned to erect on the corner of the Bishopric and Worthing Road, but that mansion was never built. So the story is about a building that was never built, and a house built but never lived in and then pulled down. A fascinating, gossipy story, but not relevant in a public guide that gives directions to travellers, except possibly to indicate what a strange place Horsham is. Though, if the account is based more on gossip, then it makes sense, as the waste would have been retained in people’s minds; a sort of “urban legend”.\n\nIn December 1799 the Duke of York announced that a camp for training elements of the regular army was required, including “a Corps of Riflemen by detachments to be returned” to their battalions “when properly instructed and the exercising of the five Regiments together as a Light Corps”[35] There then followed a debate amongst the military strategists as to how the specialist marksman, a soldier who had shown his worth in America and agreed a necessity, should operate within the structure of the Army. Should they follow the Austrian model and have them mixed in with the battalion, or follow the Prussian model and have them as a separate single specialist corps which would support the light infantry? In the end, the Duke decided on training just a small body of men from every battalion to act as sharpshooters.\n\nOn 17 January 1800 he ordered that 14 regiments were to detach 30 privates, two corporals, two sergeants, one ensign, one lieutenant and one captain “to form a corps of detachments from the different regiments of the line for the purpose of being instructed in the use of the rifle and the system of exercise adopted by soldiers so armed”[36]. It was made clear that, once trained, the soldiers would return to the regiments and another 14 regiments would send troops. The Duke also instructed that only “such men as appear most capable of receiving the above instructions and most competent to the performance of the duty of Rifleman” should be sent; some regimental commanders saw it as an opportunity to send some of the worst men.\n\nThe next question was: where would they be sent for training? It was decided that Horsham offered the best facilities, perhaps because of the large training field that would later acquire the name “barrack field”; not where the barracks were built, but where men from the barracks trained. In early February, eight of the detachments had arrived at Horsham; the Duke, as Commander in Chief, forced the other six detachments to be sent, only to notify five of the colonels that all 34 of the men they sent were “unfit for Service” and so to send “good and serviceable men”, whilst some individuals from the remaining regiments had to be sent back. By late March 33 officers and 510 men had been selected, and on 1 April 1800 the first parade of the “Experimental Corps” took place in Horsham. A month later they were marched to Swinley near Windsor Forest for intensive training. Horsham’s role in the formation of one of the great regiments of the Napoleonic war; the 95th has slipped from the town’s memory.[37]\n\nThe war against France was going badly for Britain. Not only that, but the years 1798-1801 were very poor harvests, causing fears of food shortages and leading the government to put artificially high prices on corn to encourage growth. In July 1801 a secret circular went out to the District Commanders warning of the threat of imminent invasion. It was probably this circular that encouraged another detailed survey to be done, and another one two years later in 1803.[38] The survey was far more comprehensive and accurate, but it did reveal marked changes in livestock numbers which are difficult to explain away. The data is also presented in a different format: rather than combine livestock and transport, it is now separated out.\n\nSchedule 1: Livestock\n\nSchedule 2: Transport\n\nThe sizeable drop in number of sheep in the parish, from 2057 to 130, was a marked transformation in farming practices. Alan Siney has argued that the wetter weather led to chronic foot problems, as it was not only Horsham that saw the reduction.[39] The other possibility could be the time of year, with the great sheep fairs taking place in September. The reduction in number of draught oxen from 54 to 9 might suggest a change in use to draught horses, which rose from 326 to 340, though there is no direct correlation. (Oxen reduced in number by 45, and horses increased by 14), which suggests one would expect a reduction in the number of wagons as there are fewer draught animals, or perhaps a change in transport from the heavier wagon to the lighter cart, but the number of wagons increased by 17 and the number of carts by 36.\n\nIn fact, it is dangerous to read too much into the figures, because you are not comparing like with like. The first set of figures are voluntary, those subscribed to, or given in return for a payment; the second set are actual numbers available. So the first set is probably the minimum number, the second the actual number. This in turn means that any increase in number from 1798 to 1801 cannot be read as an absolute increase in number, whilst any reduction in number between 1798 and 1801 figures can be, unless the enumerator miscounted or misinformed.\n\nIn the 1801 survey a number of bread ovens were recorded for the first time. It revealed that there were eight bakers with large baking ovens and 297 small private ovens. In the land tax for 1785, some 566 inhabitable houses were recorded in Horsham parish, which suggests that around half of all homes in the parish had bread ovens, which is surprising when you consider the mid-19th century Dickens’ story A Christmas Carol using the baker’s oven to bake the roast – though that was in an urban area.\n\nThe demand for accurate statistical information was such that the first national census was conducted in 1801. It revealed that Britain’s population stood at 10.4 million and London at 864,001, with the population of Horsham given at 3,204 (which probably included the inhabitants of St Leonard’s Forest in Lower Beeding), and the population of the urban area given at 1,539.[40] Horsham, although seen as a town then, today would be viewed as no more than a village. It is perhaps worth remembering this small number of people, as it would directly play a part in the revenue base for future improvements. (This of course excludes any revenue generated through the market tolls).\n\nIn effect, the town had to rely on the munificence of the wealthy few to obtain any civic building, as the population was too small to pay for it. In this respect one cannot but admire the Horsham folk for playing the political card so well that they managed to get things done in return for giving up political freedom. At a time when identity was tied to locality rather than nation, why worry about who your MP was, providing that the local Lord or Lady paid for a new organ, fire engine, town hall etc?\n\nOn 27 March 1802 Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens; war was over. In reality, both sides were exhausted after nine years of fighting, and both sides knew war would start again. So both sides prepared for it, using the 14 months of peace to catch their breath. But life also went on in much the same way as before. Timothy Shelley stood as MP for Shoreham and was duly elected in July of that year. He then set about enhancing the value of his property in Worthing by getting a Turnpike Act passed for a new road to the seaside resort.[41] “A Mr Heath of Horsham was responsible for the road improvements carried out which not only eased the gradients, but reduced the distance by two miles compared with the route via Steyning”.[42] Visitors to Worthing would travel on the Horsham to Steyning turnpike opened in 1764, then on to Worthing; this new link left that turnpike just south of West Grinstead Park. This new turnpike eventually became the A24 and passing through Horsham encouraged greater coaching traffic.\n\nHorsham was now at the apex of two growing coastal routes: one to Brighton, as indicated by Edwards’ book (mentioned above), and one to Worthing. Today, when we are used to World Wars where the nation as a whole was fighting the cause, it seems strange that money was laid out on new turnpike roads to seaside resorts. But in reality the bulk goods could be taken by the ports and the riverine canals that grew up along the coast; roads were not built for bulk transport but for the pursuit of leisure.[43] The impetus for leisure was peace so it is not surprising that in the 14 months of peace the Turnpike Act was passed, followed by Timothy Shelley being made a Commissioner of Worthing, when the little village was given the status of a town in 1803.[44]\n\nIt was in this period of peace that the Society of Independent Protestant Dissenting Calvanists, as they called themselves, who had been in Horsham “for many years”, built “a new brick building or Meeting house” in what became Springfield Road. In 1769 John Cragg sold a quarter of an acre of land in the “back lane” from West Street to the Common, to John Morth, the Carpenter. In March 1802 John sold part of the property and part of another to allow Society members to have access to the new meeting hall. The pastor was one John Harm, who gave the chapel its common name: “Harms Chapel”. It was a popular chapel, so popular in fact that by 1813, plans were afoot to build a new one. It is the new chapel built in 1814 that appears as a woodcut in Howard Dudley’s History and Antiquities of Horsham[45].\n\nThe creation of the turnpike road to Worthing now made Worthing part of Horsham’s hinterland rather than, as it had been in medieval times, the other way around. In medieval times, the Manors of Tarring cum Marlpost and Broadwater owned outlying land in Horsham which they exploited seasonally. By the end of the medieval era seasonal exploitation of the woodland had to a large extent ceased. Now the creation of the roadway, a superhighway, enabled the connection to be re-established; except, and only for a short period, Horsham was the dominant partner. The fact that the Shelley family owned land in Worthing and its neighbourhood only enhanced the connection between Horsham and Worthing. It also led to the establishment of businesses in both towns: for example James Phillip, printer, of Horsham, would set up a branch for his sons C and W Philips at 12 Warwick Street.[46] The fact that the bill for printing carried out in Worthing was issued from Horsham suggests that the profits were not being ploughed into Worthing, but into the Horsham economy, Worthing being more like a colony[47] (though, in this particular case, the printing of a book by Shelley might be more complex than that and involve false imprints.)\n\nIn 1803 the Napoleonic Wars started. This time the fear of invasion was palpable. On 7 July a meeting took place in Brighton with the Duke of Richmond in the chair at which volunteers came forward to serve in a militia. By September 1803 there were 5,000 Sussex Volunteers and, as MP, Timothy Shelley had to take responsibility for the Horsham Company. The volunteer force was highly structured and well organised. Major Beauclerk of St Leonard’s Lodge was in charge of the northern division of the Rape of Bramber. Next in command was Captain J W Commerell of Strood Park (who was also High Sheriff), who was in command of the Horsham Company. He then had three Lieutenants: Timothy Shelley, Nathanial Treadcroft Esq. and Hon. J.P. Capel of Holmbush. By 16 February 1804 the first official inspection took place on Horsham Common when the inspecting officer, Colonel Lyon, complimented the officers and men on their smart appearance but rebuked them for “unsteadiness under arms.”[48]\n\nIn July 1804 negotiations occurred between the Duke of Norfolk and the Board of Ordinance for the erection of a Depot to house extra armaments. The negotiations successfully concluded with a letter dated 6 August 1804 when the Office of Ordinance wrote to Thomas Medwin as Steward to the Duke of Norfolk and town clerk saying that the Duke of Norfolk had “signified to the Board of Ordinance his consent to the Erection of an Armoury to contain 10,000 stand of Arms, on Horsham Common”, to which Medwin replied that the Duke would like 100 guineas to pay for the acre of ground.[49] This is revealing for it shows the assuredness that the Duke now feels he has in Horsham’s affairs. Whilst he owned the land, he would have to get the permission of the burgesses to, in effect, remove an acre of land from common use. He obtained permission and kept the money.\n\nWhy was the Arms depot built so far from the Barracks? The reason was probably due to the fear of armed mutiny. As well as fear of French invasion, the Government of the day also feared mutiny and riot amongst the soldiers. A fear that was spread by the number of what were considered seditious writings. Horsham had, in 1792, held a meeting to praise the King for the suppression of seditious writings.[54] The effigy of Thomas Paine was put on a donkey and paraded round the Carfax before being burnt[55], whilst in 1797 the Derbyshire Militia quartered at Horsham Barracks offered a reward of 70 guineas “for the apprehension of any person or persons concerned in the distributing seditious publications or by any other artful means tending to excite discontent and disaffection in the regiment to the prejudice of good order and military discipline.”[56] Then, before any theatrical performance could take place in the town, the manager had to obtain permission from the barrack commander that it would not lead to trouble.[57]\n\nAs a footnote in the life of William Blake, the author, poet artist and radical Nathaniel Tredcroft, of the Manor House, sat in judgement on Blake when he appeared at the Michaelmas Quarter Sessions held on 4 October 1803 at Petwoth. Tredcroft “always wore powder in his hair and his dress was a blue tail-coat with gilt buttons, buff waistcoat, and drab cloth trousers, with either top boots or gaiters.”[58] Blake had left London and had settled at Felpham, a small hamlet near Bognor, where some altercation occurred and in the fever of the times Blake was arrested. He was taken to Petworth where the jury charged him with being a “Wicked seditious and Evil disposed person who had attempted “with force and arms” to “encourage and incite as far as in him lay the Enemies of our said Lord the King to invade this realm” and that he said “Damn the King and his Country; his Subjects and all you Soldiers are [59]sold for Slaves”.\n\nThe jury also concluded that Blake had attacked a man. Blake had to plead: pleading guilty, he would have been tried straight away; pleading not guilty he would have to await a further trial, which he did, with it taking place in Chichester in January 1804. At the trial, at which Tredcroft was not in attendance, Blake was found innocent, or as a contemporary account had it, “After a very long and patient hearing he was by the Jury acquitted, which so gratified the auditory, that the court was in defiance of all decency, thrown into an uproar by their noisy exultations”[60]. Whilst back in Warnham, some two or three years earlier, another poet, Shelley, born in 1792, would write his earliest known poem, The Cat. The poem was an early critical attack on the landlord against the tenant, the first strains of his radical intention. However, the impact of Percy Bysshe Shelley is very slight in Horsham’s history until the late 19th and late 20th century, and it is there that his story will be told.\n\nAround 1804, for some reason yet to be found, the Mercer Company renewed its interest in Collyers school. For half a century it had let the school slide into educational torpor but now, in the middle of a major war, it started to make enquiries about its school in Horsham. Was this because of a national demand for educated poor children to enter the ranks of the navy, as shown in the records of the then London, but later Horsham, boarding school Christ’s Hospital? The vicar of the day, Jameson, was a strong Tory supporter and ally of Lady Irwin. He had in 1786 asked for a rise in his salary as Master from £30 a year, but that was turned down. In 1801 he took on as Usher at the school James Thornton, son of Richard Thornton and partner in Thornton’s Academy. Obviously conflict of interest was not an ethical issue though, as will be seen, James was a deliberate thorn in the side of the Mercer Company in its endeavours to resurrect the school. In 1804 the Company willingly gave £100 to repair the Usher’s rooms at the school, perhaps as a way of removing the maiden ladies; two Miss Hunts, who had leased the room for a circulating library.\n\nThe willingness of the company to give the £100 made Thornton realise that the Company was no longer content to sit back and do nothing. He wrote to Robert Morrison of Wolverhampton where the citizens had removed the Company from involvement in the grammar school, obviously thinking along similar lines. The reply he received suggested that he should employ a good “attorney of ability and integrity”, and that the success of the case depended on showing “neglect and misapplication of the Property entrusted to them,”[61] that is, the Company. Therefore, if Thornton was going to go ahead or threaten it, he would have to show that the Company neglected the school. He did not want to stir things up and force the Company hand, and by doing so encourage the Company to become involved, so he filed the letter away, and carried on teaching in his father’s school.\n\nThat Horsham should have a circulating library is not that surprising. The economics of the book trade meant that books written by long dead authors and those out of copyright were getting cheaper and cheaper, but new books were getting more and more expensive each year. This was not down to the material costs, but to the payment of authors and their copyright fees and the fact that the publishers working together demanded higher prices for newly-written books.[62] So, whilst the Romantic era may be dominated by Byron and Scott in terms of sales, authors such as Thompson, who published his Seasons in the 1720s, were being sold in vast numbers. A mistake often made by writers of this period is to assume that authors such as Shelley were influential, but the cost of buying his work when published was prohibitive to the majority of the population; only when he was published by the pirates did his work move into the hands of the radicals. Therefore, the only chance many people had to read the current literature of the day was through the circulating library, or book club.[63]\n\nFrom Highmoor’s account mentioned above, we know that a bookshop was running a circulating library of sorts in the 1780s. It is possible that Phillips, mentioned above, also ran a small circulating library as he was involved in surveying, stationery supplies and printing, but we do not know for certain. What we do know is that the library situated near the Church suggests, and no more than that, a weekly reading pattern with books being taken out and returned on the Sunday. It is also possible that the soldiers in the barracks were good customers with the library being close by. What can be said for certain is that some people in Horsham were reading and taking part in the intellectual debates of the era, something that becomes apparent later in our story.\n\nInterestingly, there is one area of Horsham that has a connection with the Battle of Trafalgar, and that is the area of the Common around the Nelson public house. The streets in this area have names such as Shelley Road, Victory Road, Spencers Road. Nelson Rd, and Trafalgar Rd. The renewed interest coming up to the Bicentenary of Trafalgar has led to museum staff being asked, or on occasion told, that the land was owned by Nelson, or had a connection with the famous battle. This is where history can get in the way of a good story.\n\nBefore the land was built on in the 1870s to 1910 period[64], there was a terrace of early- to mid-19th century houses along Trafalgar Road that developed with detached houses of the same date in North Parade.[65] The museum archives hold a lease for 21 years from Edward Lucas to Samuel Woollan for Trafalgar House dated November 1819. Edward Lucas lived at Stamerham, whilst Samuel resided at Duke Street, London. The property consisted of Trafalgar House, a brew house, coach house, stable, Garden and a field or croft lying opposite the house. Trafalgar House is also mentioned in a legal case in 1832, so the name was current throughout this period and may have given itself to the road name.[66] However, Spencers Road is not named after the only British Prime Minister assassinated in 1812, Lord Spencer, but after Spencers farm; a farm, along with other property, that was owned by Sir Percy Florence Shelley, son and heir of the poet who sold Spencers farm along with other farms on 13 July 1875[67], providing large amounts of land for development, just as he had done in Worthing.[68]\n\nShelley Road is probably named after the family rather than any direct connection with the poet. So the Trafalgar connection is down to a house named after the battle, a house that gave a sense of identity in an area with no distinguishing physical features; hence the unusual name,[69] that led property developers to name the streets after the battle, whilst Spencer being a Prime Minister at the time of Shelley was coincidence rather than design. The popularity of Nelson and the nation’s regard for him can be seen in the large number of commemorative souvenirs produced at the time or for centuries afterwards. On display in the gallery Horsham’s History can be seen a bone cribbage case with a very naϊve painting of the memorial to Nelson. The case itself holds a set of dominoes.\n\nThe impact of the Battle of Trafalgar has been greatly debated. It has been argued that it led Napoleon to give up any notion of invading England and, thus, the fear that caused the volunteer forces to be established diminished. A recent work summarises the most recent thinking on the battle. “At the end of the campaign Britain had an unchallenged command of the sea, in quantity and quality, materially and psychologically, over all her actual or potential enemies, which she had never known before. …On 2nd December Napoleon won a great victory at Austerlitz over the Austro-Russian armies and destroyed the coalition Pitt (the British Prime Minister) had laboured to construct. Seven weeks later Pitt himself was dead. Whatever Trafalgar had won, it had not won the war. Nor had it saved Britain from invasion, for Napoleon’s invasion schemes had already collapsed under the weight of their own absurdity so completely that even the emperor had noticed.” Rodgers goes on to state that the Battle must not be seen as of marginal importance, though “Napoleon had no sooner thrown away his fleet than he realized how much he needed it to break out of the strategic limitations of his situation, and spent the rest of his reign in a futile and immensely costly attempt to reconstruct it…We shall see, moreover, that Trafalgar was also the guarantor of Britain’s economic prosperity, which allowed her to continue at war and to subsidize her allies at war, while Napoleon ground up and consumed the resources of France and all western Europe to feed his military ambitions”[70]. And a Horsham man, Captain John Pilfold, played a part in that victory.\n\nThe following year one of the burning issues within Parliament took place, and one in which Horsham MPs took a notable role was the abolition of slavery. Slavery is one of those areas of British history that seems to slip by unnoticed or unaccounted for. No previous history of Horsham has drawn attention to it so, for many, one can assume that it occurred, but occurred elsewhere. In March 1721 Rich Ingram was appointed Governor of what became Barbados: St Lucia and Dominico Islands, with their prominent slave labour. His and the family’s wealth was expected to increase through such an office, though he died before he could take it up. We know that John Baker was Solicitor General for the Leeward Island before coming to Horsham, and his diary has a large number of references to slaves. He employed a black cook at Horsham, Eudosia, but whether she was a former slave is open to question.[71] However, the overriding impact of slavery, one that influenced every strata of society, was not the wealth that enabled the large stately homes to be built, the money to buy the Chippendale furniture, or the Wedgwood pottery, or silver etc. that we associate with 18th century culture, but sugar. Britain became addicted to sugar; something made possible by the slave trade.[72]\n\nHowever, it is in the abolition of the slave trade that Horsham MPs played a significant role; one that has been forgotten. Because of that, it is recounted in the main narrative of Horsham, rather than as a mini essay at the end of the chapter.[73]\n\nIn 1789, just before the fall of the Bastille, a debate occurred in Parliament on Slavery. The debate followed the publication of a two-volume report prepared by the Privy Council on the subject. The debate was the start of a 17-year campaign that eventually led to the Abolition of slavery in law by Britain in 1807. The first debate did not go well for the abolitionists led by Wilberforce with the support of William Pitt and Edmund Burke. The anti-abolitionists were stirring in defence of the trade which they saw as fundamental to the life blood of Britain. Then the French Revolution occurred, and this helped the slave traders. As the one-time Horsham MP would state, “If any person be desirous of having an adequate idea of the mischievous effects produced in this country by the French Revolution …he should attempt some reform on humane and liberal principles …”[74]\n\nIt was against this background that the 1790 election took place. In Horsham Lady Irwin’s candidates were Lord William Gordon, her son-in law, and a James Baillie; against them for the Duke of Norfolk’s interests were Timothy Shelley and Wilson Braddyll. Baillie was a retired West Indian Merchant and a slave owner; it is likely that he had paid Lady Irwin to stand so he could defend the case for slavery in Parliament. However, due to Norfolk’s manipulation of the electoral process, it was Shelley and Braddyll who were elected. The following year, in 1791, Wilberforce introduced a motion to abolish the slave trade; it had been two years since the debate, and the arguments concerning slavery had changed from one of the beneficial affects of the trade to the impracticality and unwisdom of abolition. The vote was 88 to 163 against abolition. The movement then spread to the streets, with petitions against the slave trade; some 500 alone being received in 1792.\n\nInterestingly, it has been argued that the abolitionists learnt their craft through the Quaker movement. “Clarkson argues that it was the Quakers, in both England and America, who provided many of the basic models for the production and use of free publications, as they provided the initial moral and intellectual impetus for abolition generally…What, then, were the Quaker’s publicity methods? In July 1783 the Quakers had the first meeting of their secretly established CFS (Committee for Sufferings) which was dedicated to publicising the abuses within slavery systems. …All their efforts went into raising awareness, whether through petitioning, targeting schools and the government with free books or infiltrating the public press.[75] In Horsham we can see this, in that as early as 1746 an address was sent by the Quakers to the King George II congratulating him on the suppression of popery.[76] Horsham had a strong and active Quaker group and so the abolitionist movement may have had their beginnings, in Horsham, at least, from within the quaker movement.\n\nOn 8 March 1792, the Norfolk candidates were de-selected and James Baillie and William Gordon were duly returned as MPs for Horsham. The following month Wilberforce tried again to carry a bill abolishing the trade. On 2 April 1792 “one of the greatest debates in the history of legislative assemblies”[77] occurred. And James Baillie, MP for Horsham, spoke for the retention of the trade.\n\nWilberforce started the debate with: “Africa, Africa, your sufferings have been the theme that has arrested and engages my heart. Your sufferings no tongue can express, no language impart”, before going on to discus further outrages. Then the first declaration made for the status quo was that made by James Baillie, “a Scotsman from Inverary, the agent for Grenada, who had lived both on that island and on St Kitts. He owned a plantation in Demerara and talked, in his only speech in the Commons, of the “wild, impracticable and visionary scheme of abolition “; he thought that there was brutality on innumerable ships, not just slave ships, and in innumerable European armies; and that there was more wretchedness in the parish of St Giles in London, where he had a house, than in the colonies. He also thought that the revolution in Saint –Dominique (slaves had revolted) had been directly caused by the unfortunate discussion of abolition of the slave trade”[78]. The debate continued when Dundas suggested an amendment, a compromise, that the word “gradually” be inserted. At 6.30am the following morning the vote was 230 to 85 in favour of Dundas’s motion “that the slave trade ought to be gradually abolished”.\n\nThen, in 1793, Revolutionary War occurred; Pitt’s attention was turned elsewhere, Wilberforce lost support as he opposed the conflict, and the attack on the salve trade could be argued as an attack on ancient British institutions. It was also the year in which Horsham’s pro-slavery MP James Baillie died.\n\nThe next great impetus for abolition occurred after 1802, when Napoleon revived the French slave trade and reintroduced slavery itself into the French Empire. In 1803, the Danish enacted their agreement of 1792 to abolish the slave trade. Then in 1804 Wilberforce introduced his fourth bill to the House of Commons; it passed 49 votes to 24, mainly because of the Irish members. There was now a new opponent of the bill: the MP for Sussex County, John Fuller, a planter from Jamaica who insisted that “he had never heard the Africans deny their mental inferiority.” Although it passed the Commons, it did not pass the Lords, with Dundas, now Lord Melville, proposing a delay.\n\nIn 1806 a “Government of All the Talents” was formed following the death of William Pitt. One of the “talents” would become Horsham’s MP in 1812, but in 1806 he was the Attorney-General, Sir Arthur Pigott[79], and introduced a bill forbidding British captains to sell slaves to foreign countries. It was a stepping-stone whose language was such that few realised its importance. It passed the House of Commons 35 to 13 and the House of Lords 43 to 18. The abolitionists were over the moon. In November 1806 an election was called, and those standing for Horsham included Henry Temple, Viscount Palmerston, who would later play an important role in the worldwide abolition of the trade through the use of British Foreign policy. He would be standing for Lady Irwin’s interest, along with Fitzharris, against Norfolk’s men, Wilder and Parry Jones. The Bailiffs, rather than decide who was elected and face the problems of dissatisfied members, decided to send a double return, leaving it to Parliament to decide. So Palmerston would be elected as MP for Horsham, only to be de-selected by the House of Commons in January and Norfolk’s men returned.\n\nOn 23 February 1807 there was the last significant debate on the abolition. John Fuller MP for Sussex was strongly opposed to it, saying “We might as well say ‘Oh, we will not have our chimney swept, because it is a little troublesome to the boy’” yet despite this and other opposition the bill passed with 283 votes to 16. “The final debate was remarkable for an elegant comparison by Sir Samuel Romilly between Napoleon and Wilberforce; at the end of it, the whole house rose to give the latter unprecedented applause”[80]. Sir Samuel would become a Horsham MP in 1807; he was another proponent of abolition. The bill received royal assent on 25 March, the very last Act of the Parliament before it was dissolved, and from 1 May 1807 the trade would be illegal.\n\nOne figure who has not been mentioned in the account so far has been The Duke of Norfolk, the Duke who believed passionately in English liberty based on the Magna Charta; what was his view and impact on the debate? The Duke of Norfolk was a passionate abolitionist who worked to ensure the bill would be passed. Thomas Clarkson, the great abolitionist, who wrote a two-volume history of the struggle in 1808, records the problems the bill had in passing through Parliament, and that “on Monday, the twenty-third, the House of Lords met. Such extraordinary diligence had been used in printing the bill, that it was then ready. Lord Grenville immediately brought it forward. The Earl of Westmoreland and the Marquis of Sligo opposed it. The Duke of Norfolk and the Bishop of Landaff (Dr Watson) supported it.”[81]\n\nOn 29 April, Parliament was dissolved and a new election was held. Those standing for Lady Irwin’s interest were Joseph Marryatt and Henry Goulbourn, and those for the Duke, Sir Samuel Romilly and Love-Parry Jones-Parry. Sir Samuel reported in his memoirs that he obtained the candidature through the offices of his abolitionist friend Pigott, the Attorney General mentioned above, but that he knew the seat, if he won the election, was likely to end up in an appeal. Romilly won the election but an appeal was made by Irwin’s men. Due to the war, the appeal was not heard for over a year and the Committee did not report until 26 February 1808, when Romilly and Parry-Jones-Parry were removed and Marryat and Goulborne were claimed to be duly elected.\n\nInterestingly, in his account of the abolition of the slave trade, Thomas records the following: “Many ordinary petitions were also laid against this decision (to abolish the slave trade) of the legislature of the world’s largest slave trader: for example, one from Joseph Marryat, member of Parliament for Horsham, a substantial West Indies merchant and father of ‘Captain Marryat’ the novelist. But they were to no avail: 30 April 1807 was the last date when a slaver legally sailed from a British port.”[82] The point is, Marryat was not Horsham MP at the time; he was representing himself as he did not take that position till 1808.\n\nIt is interesting to note that two of Lady Irwin’s candidates were pro-slave traders: Baillie and Marryat, whilst the Duke of Norfolk gave help to the abolitionists. Was there a deep-seated pro-slavery desire from the Viscountess Irwin, or was she doing it because they paid the most money, or did she select men to “spite” Norfolk? The latter is unlikely because she did not know of the attack on her power in 1790 election. As for the other two possibilities, James Lomax[83] of Temple Newsam, an authority on the Irwin family. said that as far as he is aware the Irwins had no slavery interests though she was friendly with a slave-owning family and merchants, so the money-making option seems the most likely reason.\n\nThere was one further election in 1807: that of the County MPs that took place at Lewes between 15 and 28 May 1807. 108 of the Horsham Freeholders voted (the voting qualifications were different for County MPs from those for Horsham MPs). The candidates were Wyndham, Fuller and Colonel Sergison. The election was fought almost entirely over one issue: slavery, as Fuller, as noted above, was greatly in favour of the trade. Pasted up around the town was the following squib:\n\nYOUR Vote alone perhaps, may Thousands free,\n\nWho now are chained in cruel SLAVERY\n\nFrom Wife, from Children. And from all that’s dear,\n\nThey’re torn and sold as Beasts and Sheep are here;\n\nUsed cruel past Expression to relate,\n\nAnd oft expire in this sad, horrid State;\n\nThen if you’ve HUMAN feeling, and free Voice,\n\nLet SERIGISON & WYNDHAM be your Choice.\n\nConsider this before you go to Poll!\n\nYour single Vote Perhaps, may free the Whole,\n\nThe stain of SLAVERY from Britain’s Isle remove.\n\nAnd bring Ten Thousand Blessings from ABOVE1\n\nMUNGO\n\n—————\n\nPhillips, Printer, Horsham\n\nOf those 108 who voted from Horsham, 101 voted for Wyndham, 22 for Fuller and 86 for Sergison (Every voter had two votes to elect two MPs) Horsham was strongly opposed to slavery, yet by Irwin’s manipulation had a pro-slavery MP.\n\nAs a postscript to the abolition movement, on 19 July 1814 a petition was sent from Horsham to the House of Commons noting that it was with “the greatest regret that in the recent treaty of peace with France no provision was made for the abolition of the slave trade.”[84]\n\nOn 20 November 1807 Lady Irwin died at Temple Newsam; the estate then passed to the Marquis of Hartford who was friendly with the Prince Regent, who in turn was friends with The Duke of Norfolk. The Duke of Norfolk could now if he so wished acquire the freehold of the burgages from the Marquis, assuming the Marquis wanted to sell. In 1809, in a survey quoted by Albery, the Duke of Norfolk had 23 burgages; the Marquis of Hartford 33.[85] It would take four years to accomplish the sale.\n\nIn 1806 Jamerson, the Vicar of Horsham, resigned the Mastership of Collyers, asking a young Thomas Williams, who seems to have been undertaking some clerical work in the Paristo take over. As Headmaster, Williams asked for the Company to pay for some repairs to the School. This encouraged the Mercer Company to send Thomas and William Palmer to Horsham to investigate the school. In June 1807 they arrived and found that the school had no pupils. The new Master wanted to teach, but there were no pupils. The reason was the Parish copy of Richard Collyer’s will. The Vicar argued that no one knew how the pupils for the school should be selected, as the Parish copy was missing the words: “… by the Vicar and Churchwardens and two honest men of the same Parish such as the Parishioners shall think most indifferent, the said two men to be admitted…”[86].\n\nInterestingly, the Parish copy of the will was complete enough for Dr Hutchinson, some 50 years earlier, to argue the Company should pay for the upkeep of the parish roads from the profit on the rents (see above). The Vicar, if he wanted to, could have asked to find out the missing words, but in reality this was editing of the worst kind. The Palmers were not impressed, and through the Company suggested that the Vicar call a Parish Vestry meeting to see how the school could be reopened. In return the Company would set out new regulations “as shall appear of most public benefit”. If the Vicar and the Parish prevaricated then the Company would revert to paying the salaries as stipulated in the Will: £10 and 10 marks; as all increases had been legally “gratuities during pleasure”.\n\nThe Parish responded with a Vestry meeting on 13 August 1807. The meeting passed a number of resolutions, the intention of which was clearly to frighten the Company with the thought of additional expenditure. The Vestry argued for, amongst, other things, an increase in the salaries, and that cost should not be passed on to the parents as the school should provide free education, as “there are many families who are entirely incapable of offering the smallest expense for the education of their children”[87]. This was followed by a meeting on 26 October where the Vestry appointed a sub-committee of “9 respectable Inhabitants of the same Parish” to put forward a scheme to the Company.\n\nThe scheme included raising the Usher’s salary to £100 a year, giving the Usher the full use of the Usher’s house and the complete control of over 30 boys of the lower class. The Company debated the proposal and came back with its own: that both premises and pupils were to be under the control of the Master, and the salaries were to be £100 for the Master and £60 for the Usher; and these to be at the pleasure of the Company, not a right. Not only that; the current incumbents were to be confirmed in post and had to submit themselves to annual approbation, or review.\n\nThe Parish had to accept the new deal in full, or not get anything. In February 1808 the Vestry accepted the proposals after a heated debate: 35 for, and 29 against. The school could now re-open. In April 1808 the Company, having accepted the new code, sent a copy to the Master and the Usher to sign. Williams the Master signed, but Thornton the Usher did not; he refused to sign the agreement, resign or surrender the tenancy of the Usher’s rooms. The Company got around this by employing a temporary Usher, George Phillips, so in May 1808 the school opened. Though, according to Thornton, it was a sham: Thornton, as was the custom of the day, published an appeal for support from the town folk. This resulted in a legal case which would take years to settle; in the meantime the school ticked over.\n\nThe following year, in 1809, the same year as the turnpiking of the Horsham to Guildford Road, a cutting was made in Picts Hill, thus lowering the road and making it easier for coaches. It had been assumed that the cause of this was the death in a freak accident of Thomas Medwin’s son who rolled over on the descent from Picts Hill[89], yet the fatal accident occurred in 1806 and the road was lowered in 1809. However, it is clear from the letter of complaint (see box above) that the loss of trade through the turnpike would have made it a necessity and probably had as much to do with the cutting as the accident. The cutting can still be seen today: as you drive pass the Christ’s Hospital turn out of Horsham on the Worthing Road, you drive through a cutting.\n\nThis year also saw the nation celebrate the accession of George III some 49 years earlier. An account of how the nation celebrated was gathered together by “A Lady The wife of a Navel Officer”, as the title page of the book recording the events of 25 October 1809 stated. For Horsham, the account is as follows:\n\n“The Jubilee was celebrated in the most joyous, loyal, and benevolent manner; the day was ushered in by the ringing of bells, which continued till noon, when the garrison, consisting of the 51st Regiment, with part of the 23d, and 32d, fired a feu de joie on Den-Hill, which was returned by the Volunteers in the town; after which the regiments of the Garrison marched to the Market-square, and gave three hearty cheers, in which they were joined by the inhabitants with the greatest enthusiasm; at three o’clock a large party dined at the King’s Head. A subscription was raised for the poor, from which nearly 1900 received 1 lb of bread, 1 1lb. of meat each, and money in proportion to the number in family.”[90]\n\nThere was also a sermon preached in the church which was published. Unlike most of the sermons published that were preached in the town[91] this was for, and directed to, the people of Horsham. The sermon is entitled “A SERMON preached in the Parish Church of Horsham, on Wednesday, October 25, 1809, being the Anniversary of the accession of King George the Third: and the day on which his Majesty entered the Fiftieth year of his Reign. Appointed to be kept as a Jubilee. By the Reverend Thomas Williams, A.B. of Exeter College, Oxford; and Master of the Free Grammar school, Horsham. Printed by James Phillips; and sold by E. Griffith. Price, Two shillings and six-pence.” The eight-page publication then includes a dedication “to the Inhabitants of the Parish of Horsham, and particularly those who honored (sic) it with their approbation. The following Discourse, is Dedicated and Addressed, by Their obliged and humble servant, T.W.” This is then followed by more “humble pie” with a letter to the inhabitants of the town of Horsham. The sermon takes 1st timothy, 2d.-1.2. as its text. There then follows page after page of praise for the king with the following paragraph and note: “To enjoy the GOOD of this Life for OURSELVES ALONE, is a SELFISH consideration, not, (I am proud to say) belonging to any of us here: and when we reflect, that our Prayers are this day presented to the Throne of grace, for our BELOVED and VENERABLE MONARCH, accompanied by one of the CHIEF duties of Christianity, CHARITY TO THE POOR* we may entertain a reasonable hope, that these Prayers will be heard, and that all things will be given, expedient for us.” The * goes on to state “The Sum collected throughout the Parish for the Relief of the Poor, amounted to MORE than One Hundred Pounds, and was distributed in Bread, Meat, and Money, to each indigent and industrious family. The Persons who obtained the relief, exceeded Sixteen hundred.”[92]\n\nThe publication itself is quarto, which gives very wide margins to the thin text. This was the era of large paper copies, where large, wide margins gave a sense of luxury and quality.[93] Phillips had access to at least one ornamental font as well as various different sizes of type. The errata note at the end points out 15 mistakes, out of 16 pages of text. Obviously, the printing job was stretching the ability of J. Phillips, who up to that time had just printed the odd sale notice and auction list.\n\nThat such celebrations occurred in Horsham should not be surprising, as in May 1800 the Town had sent an address to the King congratulating him on his escape from assassination.[94] Whilst the Parish Church was adorned with an unusual painted panel sometime between 1801 and 1815, which now hangs in Horsham Museum, the panel was bought from a secondhand dealer in Bromley in 1889, which suggests that it might have been removed from the church during its Restoration in 1864. As the label on the back states, ‘These arms must have been painted between 1801 and 1815. The Electoral Cap occurs over the shield of pretence of Hanover and the Fleurs de Lys are absent from the English shield. The Fleurs de Lys were resigned by George III by Royal Proclamation in 1801 and the Electoral Cap was dropped when Hanover was made a kingdom in 1815.’\n\nWhat is remarkable about this account is not the pro-monarchy celebration, which in the time of War one might expect, but that there were 1900 people in Horsham deemed “poor”; deserving of charity. The population of Horsham in 1811 was 3,839[95], though that probably included the whole parish and some outlying areas (see above), which would suggest that around half the population were considered deserving poor. This suggests that while some were benefiting from the army barracks in the town, the wealth was not being distributed, and the idea as expressed by some Horsham historians that poverty became a problem for Horsham after the War needs to be re-assessed. The reality is that Horsham had a very large “underclass”.\n\nHowever, money was continuing to flow into the economy with the war now entering its “beginning of the end”. The demands on the nation’s manpower were such that men were being encouraged to fight from all over the empire. In December 1810 the 102nd Regiment was stationed in Horsham. The 102nd were different from the other regiments because they had originally been called the New South Wales Corps and served in Australia. Arriving in Horsham Barracks in December, they had brought with them wives and children, the cream of the growing population of the new colony. The Parish Register for the winter of the year 1810/11, records that 77 children died due to a epidemic, possibly of measles, and of those 77 children 45 had the same surname as the men of the 102nd. This epidemic also killed nearly all the women brought over with the troops. The effect on the development of New South Wales was such that it is recorded in the history of that state.[96] Whilst the death of 45 children was devastating, what has not been noted is that Horsham lost 33 children of its own to the epidemic. This large number of deaths may well reflect the degree to which poverty was putting a strain on the people of Horsham; the children were malnourished and so susceptible to diseases, whereas those from New South Wales were encountering this pathogen for the first time.\n\nWhilst all of this was going on behind the scenes, the Duke of Norfolk was entering into negotiations with the Marquis of Hartford to buy the property owned by the Ingram family. He had hoped to buy from Sir Henry Fletcher his Burgages, but the price was too high[97], so negotiations continued with the Marquis with the help of the Prince Regent. How much of these discussions was common knowledge cannot be told from the records. However, the town faced a new and pressing problem.\n\nBy 1808 the town of Lewes had spent £15,000 on a new County Hall, which emphasised how poor the Town Hall was. This led to an argument by the justices for pulling the town hall down[98] and rebuilding it. This was followed a year later by the suggestion that the quarter sessions should move elsewhere.[99] This would have been a severe blow to the status of Horsham and to the traders who benefited by the courts coming to town. The tax base of the town was so small that the previous Town Hall had been built as a gift by the Eversfield and Ingram families (see above), and even after 80 years of growth the town could not afford to sort the problem out.\n\nIt has been argued that the Duke stepped in to help Horsham out after he had purchased the town. However, in the Arundel archives there is a plan for the new town hall on paper watermarked 1810.[100] It might be that the plan was drawn on old paper stock, or it could indicate that the Duke’s negotiations to acquire Horsham were progressing well enough for him to invest time in designing the Town Hall.\n\nIn a letter quoted by Albery, dated 1 February 1812, the Duke of Norfolk writes, “Sir Henry’s terms put an end to all hope of a favourable negotiation between us, and I was thereby induced to listen with eagerness to a proposition made by the Marquis of Hartford in November, 1810, and to purchase his estates at a most exorbitant price”[101], which suggests that the design of the town hall was linked to the purchase of Horsham, both being planned in 1810. In fact, a document in the Norfolk archives housed in Arundel Castle states that the sale was carried out on 31 December 1810 when an “Articles of agreement for sale “ was drawn up with the price of £91,475 for “All the Horsham properties devised in the will of Charles Viscount Irwin”[102].\n\nNews of the purchase leaked to the press, and on 25 February 1811 the Sussex Advertiser announced:\n\n“The Duke of Norfolk has purchased of the Marquis of Hartford his property in Horsham, by which the electioneering struggles between the two parties will be put to an end. The Ministerial influence will lose two Members and the Irwinites at Horsham will be losers annually of two good jollifications”.\n\nThe amount of legal paperwork to go through meant that it was not until June 1811 that the deal was finally completed, with the Duke handing over the remaining £31,475 on top of the “£60,000 already paid.”[103] Horsham now belonged to the Duke.\n\nAt the time of these legal negotiations in London on 31 January 1811, the Master of the Rolls sat to hear the case concerning Collyer’s School, between Thornton and the Mercer Company. The case was brought by the Attorney General. The reason for the Crown’s involvement was that the only one entitled to evict Thornton from the School-house was the legal owner; and that was unknown. The Company may pay salaries and repair the fabric, the Parish select the pupils, but neither were the “heir-at-law of Richard Collyer”, who was unknown, so the Crown would step in, and only the Lord Chancellor could make orders for the future of the school.\n\nThornton must have been well advised when he stuck struck out back in 1808. In the case, the Company asked that the School should have a constitution, a set of Trustees, and directions given to run the school as the Founder had intended. The company also set out how the school had been run since 1808; that it had taken 60 boys and given them primary education which was “consonant to the general wish of the present day”[104]. The Courts went away to think about what they had heard and Collyers carried on teaching a primary education.\n\nIn Horsham the Duke was now in full command, back to, as he would see it, the Lord Paramount owning most of Horsham’s burgage plots and with it the associated rights, duties and obligations, including the burgesses’ rights to the Common. In August he asked Medwin to place an advertisement in the papers proposing to enclose Horsham Common. The advert ran on 9 September 1811 in the Sussex Weekly Advertiser, baldly stating that:\n\n“Notice is hereby given that application is intended to be made to Parliament in the ensuing session for an Act for dividing, allotting and enclosing Horsham Common, and the waste lands adjacent or contiguous thereto lying within the several manors of Horsham…. Dated at Horsham this fourth day of September 1811…”[105]\n\nHaving helped the Duke of Norfolk gain control of Horsham by developing strategies that would inflict maximum nuisance on the Irwin’s, Thomas Charles Medwin, the town’s solicitor overplayed his hand, believing himself to be irreplaceable. Unfortunately for him, he was not and in September Norfolk fired him.[106] Medwin had been also helping out Sir Henry Fletcher and the Duke may have thought there was a conflict of interest. Equally he may have taken umbrage in that Sir Henry had forced him to negotiate with The Marquis because he would not sell his burgages to him; Medwin may have given away confidences. Equally the sacking was over collecting manorial fees and Norfolk may have thought that he had employed Medwin to tighten up and collect monies due to him as a way of control. Now with the enclosure of the Common there was less demand for his skills. We just do not know. Medwin was now a free agent and the Medwin archive now has an anti-Norfolk spin, rather than pro-Norfolk.\n\nOn 1 February 1812, the Duke of Norfolk wrote to Sir Henry Fletcher, second-largest burgage holder in Horsham, saying: “Whatever be the result of this proposition the enclosure of the Common appears to be an advantageous measure, and I am therefore preparing the draught of the Bill with as much speed as possible and will send it for your perusal.”[107] By 25 February 1812 Mr Hurst presented a Bill for enclosing Horsham Common which, by 20 March, had received Royal Assent.[108] There was virtually no comment in the town. The 24-page Act goes into some detail of the mechanics of the enclosure, run by Commissioners who were “required to set out and allot unto the owner …for in lieu of the tithes of corn and grain that might yearly arise issue and renew out of the said common …parcels of the residue of the said common as…shall be equal to one eleventh part thereof in lieu and full satisfaction and compensation. [109] This meant that even the land left, after division of the Common into the respective owners’ holdings, was split amongst holders of the tithes. There were then three portions of land:\n\nland sold to pay for the enclosure, some 69 acres 3 roods 30 poles\n\nthe land owned by the owner of the burgages\n\nland given in compensation for the tithes, the latter two totalling 662 acres 1 rood 8 poles[110]\n\nThe first tranche of Common land was sold by auction on 22 October 1812, and that was to pay for the legal expenses. The first sale raised around £100 an acre and included land from the South East Corner of New Street (then known as Pest House Lane): some 28 acres in total, whilst the sale on 14 January to pay for enclosing land in Roughey manor raised less than half that. That land was in Crawley Road, Forest Road and Comptons Lane South.[111] Interestingly, the purchasers of the land were not outsiders but people from Horsham; those who were obviously benefiting from the Barracks, e.g. Philip Chasemore, butchers who had the contract of supplying meat to the Barracks, [112] Charles Oaks, gunsmith, two of whose guns are on display in the Museum, Duke of Norfolk, Frances Scawen Blunt, Tredcroft, John Lintott etc. The biggest purchaser of land was Robert Hurst, the Member of Parliament who had brought forward the enclosure bill.[113]\n\nWilliam Albery, who viewed the enclosure of the Common with distaste, sets out in his Millennium who purchased the land at the auction, who obtained the land through the enclosure, and who bought various plots of land and the prices paid. Albery shows that Norfolk acquired in total around 486 acres of land, but he sold around 172 acres; Hurst received as compensation for various tithes some 63 acres of Horsham Common, with Sir Henry Fletcher receiving around 47 acres. There then followed various sales between land owners with Robert Hurst being the principal purchaser, who spent £10,005 16s 3d on land in Horsham and Roffey[114] which came from the estate of Sarah Hurst, the diarist, who died in March 1808.[115] Was Robert Hurst the person who gave the idea of enclosing the Common to the Duke of Norfolk? He had money to burn, after all. We do not know. However, through the purchase of this land he became one of Horsham’s most important landowners. The end result was that Norfolk had ended up with around 330 acres of the common (320 from the allocation and 10 from purchase), whilst Hurst ended up with around 213 acres (69 allotted and 144 bought)).[116] In reality, the enclosure of the Common only brought around 132 acres of new land into the domain of private ownership (the 69 sold to pay for the process and the 63 in lieu of tithes given to Hurst); the rest had already been in private ownership but with commoners’ rights.\n\nIf the enclosure of the Common was intended to recoup the cost of buying Horsham, it was a poor proportion for Norfolk. He raised £9,955 16s and 3d for sale of Horsham Manor land and a further £224 for the sale of Hawkesbourne Manor land; some £10,199. 16s 3d in total, but he spent £776 buying up land, leaving a grand profit of £9433, around 10% of the cost of the burgage plots, though he did own all the houses. This profit was only possible because he sold land, though it could be argued that selling capital assets is not really a profit at all.\n\nThe Enclosure of the Common, as well as seeing a major redistribution of land ownership in Horsham, also saw some significant developments in the makeup and layout of the Town. For centuries the Common had acted as a barrier to growth to the north, east and partly to the west. The river had stopped growth along the southerly border; Horsham was therefore restricted in areas to expand, other than the large open market waste in its centre, or through the development of the farmland owned by the burgesses. The enclosure of the Common created a large pool of land which could be developed, as the 19th century will show. However, Horsham still had large tracts of land within the borough which were under-developed.\n\nThe other change was to the medieval roadways that crisscrossed the Common. When the land was a common, routes over the land were determined by geographical features; now, routes were determined by land ownership. This meant that some roads or tracks had to be diverted and new ones created. The enclosure commissioners foresaw this and allocated £1,393 for the making of roads, the money coming from the sale of common land.\n\nBy July 1813 Horsham common enclosure was completed. The land enclosed was poor quality with only one belt of good land and that was to be used by market gardeners later in the century.[121] The “common rights” were only those that belonged to the burgesses, they didn’t belong to the people of Horsham and whilst some undoubtedly did miss these rights the soil could only be used for grazing livestock, not intensive farming. The enclosure was in the end a good thing for Horsham, for without it the Town could not develop or expand unless there was the construction of multiple tenancy occupation units that were starting to appear on the coast in Brighton and Worthing, but a rare feature in Horsham.\n\nIn 1812/13 the Duke of Norfolk bought very little land, in fact he was the major seller. One reason could be the shortage of cash available. He had just spent out over £91,000 and then his beloved town was facing a problem that would affect more people in Horsham in the short term than the enclosure of the common. On the 23rd March 1812 the Judges declared the Town Hall unfit for use, complaining to the Lord Chief Baron.[122] They wanted to move out of Horsham. The creation of the turnpike network meant that the poor roads through Sussex were no longer an excuse, not when thousands of travellers were yearly going from London to the growing coastal resorts. If the Assizes left Horsham so would all the trade that the Courts would bring in. The War could not go on for ever so eventually the army would leave the town and with them the £1,000 a week pumped in to the local economy. Something had to be done.\n\nThe Duke of Norfolk stepped forward with his design sketched out perhaps two years earlier, and rebuilt the Town Hall at a cost of £8,000[123] which seems to be a lot of money for comparatively little work. It included the addition of a new north façade, decorated with coats of arms, made from Coade stone, a new staircase built at the south end and the open ground floor was permanently enclosed as a lower court room.[124] This meant that Horsham lost its market house, the open space underneath the meeting room, but gained according to a quote in Albery a building “greatly superior to any other Court of Justice in Sussex” The Justices stayed, the town folk were grateful and Norfolk had built an unusual monument.\n\nVery little attention has been given to the architecture of the Town Hall. The Duke in rebuilding the north façade changed it from a classical style building to a Norman style battlemented and turreted building. Why? The answer lies in the Duke’s ideas of what is portrated by architecture. The Duke’s greatest construction was not Horsham Town Hall, but Arundel Castle. Although asking advice from the leading architects of the day the Duke project-managed the reconstruction of Arundel. As Robinson states in his book on the Norfolks, “The architectural style of the new parts of the castle was determined by the Duke’s Whig principles; it was a hybrid of Perpendicular Gothic and Norman (then called “Saxon”) which were associated in the Duke’s eyes with ancient liberty, and the whole building was in one sense intended to be a temple of liberty, a fact made clear (in Latin) on the foundation stone: ‘Charles Howard Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Arundel in the year of Christ 1806 in the sixtieth year of his age dedicated this stone to Liberty asserted by the Barons in the reign of John’ This theme was continued in the sculpture…all of which celebrated the triumph of liberty over royal tyranny.

(Was it from this belief that Norfolk’s abolitionist desire grew?)[127]\n\nIn light of all these threads it is possible to see that the Town Hall was an outpost of this belief, a physical manifestation, a smaller version of Arundel Castle built in Horsham. It should not be seen as just a Town Hall, but as a monu"
