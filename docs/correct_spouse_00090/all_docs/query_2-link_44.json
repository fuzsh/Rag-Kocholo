O friendship, how piercing are your darts—there, there, again there. All mists curl off the roof of my being. That confidence I shall keep to my dying day. Like a long wave, like a roll of heavy waves, he went over me, his devastating presence—dragging me open, laying bare the pebbles on the shore of my soul. It was humiliating; I was turned to small stones. All semblances were rolled up. ‘You are not Byron; you are yourself.’ To be contracted by another person into a single being—how strange. (Passage marked by Enid Marx in her copy of Virginia Woolf ’s The Waves, Enid Marx Collection, Victoria and Albert Museum) And what [is she] thinking? All this life has somehow come together; there is a reason for it; a coherency in it, could one but seize it. The biographer answers the innumerable questions that we ask as we stand outside on the pavement looking in at the open window. Indeed there is nothing more interesting than to pick one’s way among these vast depositaries of facts, to make up the lives of men and women, to create their complex minds and households from the extraordinary abundance and litter and confusion of matter which lies strewn about. A thimble, a skull, a pair of scissors, a sheaf of sonnets are given us, and we have to create, to combine, to put these incongruous things together. There is, too, a quality in facts, an emotion which comes from knowing that men and women actually did and suffered these things, which only the greatest novelist could surpass. (Virginia Woolf, ‘How Should One Read a Book’) One must have chaos inside oneself to give birth to a dancing star. (Nietzsche quoted by Tippett from Michel Tournier’s The Wind Spirit, Those Twentieth Century Blues) If we have the courage and the freedom to write exactly what we think; if we escape a little from the common sitting room and see human beings not always in their relation to each other, but in relation to reality; and the sky too and the trees or whatever it may be in themselves; if we look past Milton’s bogey, for no human being should shut out the view; if we face the fact, for it is a fact, that there is no arm to cling to, but that we go alone and that our relation is to the world of reality and not only to the world of men and women, then the opportunity will come and the dead poet who was Shakespeare’s sister will put on the body which she has so often laid down. Drawing her life from the lives of the unknown who were her forerunners, as her brother did before her, she will be born. (Woolf, A Room of One’s Own, my emphasis)\n\nFresca_01_Plms 11/04/2017 11:24 Page vii\n\nPREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS A Tale of Research or Biography as Detection and Jigsaw ‘A thimble, a skull, a pair of scissors, a sheaf of sonnets’\n\nI\n\nN the ten-line foreword to her  Hogarth Press book, entitled A Childhood, Francesca Allinson describes her efforts to avoid ‘shut[ting]’ her protagonist, Charlotte, ‘too closely within the exact hours and places of her own experience’. This resistance to enclosure, to pinning down one’s subject, I found echoed in the lines marked by Fresca’s friend and the illustrator of A Childhood, designer Enid Marx, in her first edition of Virginia Woolf ’s The Waves () held at the Victoria and Albert Museum archives. The last sentence of the extract, used here as one of the book’s epigraphs, are the words of Bernard, the character most often linked to Woolf herself. They read: ‘O friendship . . . To be contracted by another person into a single being—how strange’. Although I have tried to find out as much information, in as much detail as possible, about Fresca, following Fresca’s and Marx’s lead, I have tried to maintain an openness to her story and to let myself consider how Fresca’s life and work intersected with that of her contemporaries. In her own prologue to A Childhood, Fresca warns that ‘if [Charlotte] strikes you as odd, have patience with her, for many of her contemporaries felt and acted very much as she did’. To borrow from Woolf ’s A Room of One’s Own, in many respects an author and a book seminal to this project and to Fresca’s life (Woolf ’s original lectures were presented at Cambridge University while Fresca was in her last year at Oxford University), rather than pin down Fresca I have tried to ‘let [the] line [of thought] dip into the stream’: ‘Thought—to call it by a prouder name than it deserved—had let its line down into the stream. It swayed, minute after minute, hither and thither among the reflections and the weeds, letting the water lift it and sink it until— you know the little tug—the sudden conglomeration of an idea at the end of one’s line: and then the cautious hauling of it in, and the careful laying of it out?’ Details of Fresca’s life came to me as items, as clues, ‘a thimble, a skull, a pair of scissors, a sheaf of sonnets’. Following Woolf ’s lead, I have ‘pick[ed] [my] way about among these vast depositaries of facts, [made] up the lives of men and women, [created] their complex minds and households from the extraordinary\n\nvii\n\nFresca_01_Plms 11/04/2017 11:24 Page viii\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements abundance and litter and confusion of matter which lies strewn about’. I have structured Fresca’s story after the fashion of A. J. A. Symons’s  The Quest for Corvo: An Experiment in Biography, as a kind of detective story in terms of these items (books, photographs, wills, etc.) and where possible in terms of the order in which they presented themselves to me. In the absence of a single Fresca archive, I have built my own. My goal with this book has been to expose the biographical process, to show the project ‘in the making’, and, in this regard, I follow in the footsteps of and am indebted not only to the work of A. J. A. Symons, but A. S. Byatt, Janet Malcolm, Daniel Mendelsohn, Richard Holmes, Lisa Cohen, Hermione Lee, Alison Light, and Martha Hodes, among many others. This is a ‘biography-in-action’, to use Michael Holroyd’s helpful term for Richard Holmes’s work. To this end, I have included leads that did not pan out, that did not produce gold, as well as, of course, those that did, and details and anecdotes that pertain only peripherally to Fresca’s life story. Several readers of this manuscript advocated separate appendices for different characters, or several different books. Sybil Oldfield, for example, suggested a second book under the title I have adopted here for this preface: Biography as Detection and Jigsaw. While acknowledging and addressing as best I could readers’ concerns about losing the Fresca thread, I have opted to keep in many of the deviations, the rabbit holes, the spider’s webs, the roads not taken, and the dead ends. As Hermione Lee argues in the introduction to her collection of writings on biography, Virginia Woolf ’s Nose, quoting Henry James, biography, like death ‘smooths the folds’ of the person one loved. ‘The figure retained by the memory is compressed and intensified; accidents have dropped away from it and shades have ceased to count; it stands, sharply, for a few estimated and cherished things, rather than nebulously, for a swarm of possibilities.’ I want to show the folds of a life, ‘the swarm of possibilities’, and also the bumps one encounters on the quest to write the story of that life. In her recent Common People, Alison Light describes her own ‘reflection on the process [of researching the lives of her family]’ as a means to ‘let the texture breathe a little and to capture, if I could, something of the emotional see-saw which accompanies archive visits and historical discoveries’. My aim, further to Light’s, is to reveal how the frequently haphazard research process mirrors the emotional see-saw that is life, in the sense that breaks in the historical record are often reflections of breaks in the lives of an individual. Fresca: A Life in the Making captures the topsy-turvy quality of most of our lives, as well as showing how biography too can get turned upside down in the making, how a single remnant, story or image can throw everything into different relief. viii\n\nFresca_01_Plms 11/04/2017 11:24 Page ix\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements This book incorporates traditional biographical research methods, such as on-site archival work, interviews, and standard library research. It also takes advantage of the many newer resources available via the Internet such as Wikipedia, Google Maps, Google Books and crowd-sourcing mechanisms. Beyond the fact that this is simply what the research landscape now looks like, some of these newer resources prove particularly useful for secondary or lesser known figures such as Fresca. Library catalogues, book sellers’ online inventories, and eBay are all wonderful sources of information, but it does mean that the research, like some of the images, is of varying quality and reliability, and that, as a result, there is occasionally a layered or secondhand quality to my findings.\n\nMost compelling about Fresca’s story, and certainly the thing that drew me to her, is the extraordinary breadth of her experiences, her tenacity, her vitality, her engagement, and her conviction. On Fresca’s death Lady Margaret Hall principal Lynda Grier described Fresca in a letter to Margaret Lambert as ‘so full of life, the essence of it’. And she continued: ‘I think I always felt more alive when [Fresca] had paid me one of her all too infrequent visits. Last time she came it was to tell me about the wood, I suppose about . She was looking magnificent, and as usual I felt revived by the sight of her.’ I hope I have captured Fresca’s vitality in this book. Grier was not the only person whose life Fresca transformed. While Fresca’s story constitutes the backbone of this book, there are many, many different lives being lived here. Fresca’s life story is the story of several intersecting circles of intellectuals and of many diverse creative enterprises, some of whom and which have yet to be written about in any detail. This is a book about women and men who were ‘unconventional, multifariously creative, and on a quest for new ways of living and loving’, as Eleanor Breuning eloquently put it. It is about individuals whose refusal of categories often hampered their bid for celebrity or kept them in the background; these were people who worked together at a period, framed by two world wars, when collaboration and cooperation were perhaps even more necessary to creative production than they usually are. Just like Fresca, I have relied on and been shaped intellectually and emotionally by a vast number of people. While I take responsibility for all errors and inconsistencies in this book, I want to acknowledge that my work is indebted to many people’s hard work and expertise and it has been a pleasure to collaborate with so many different people on this project. If I have missed anyone here, they will find themselves in the book. I am indebted to Fresca’s family and friends, especially the late Sonya Allinson, but also the late Vanessa and Michael, and the next generation of ix\n\nFresca_01_Plms 11/04/2017 11:24 Page x\n\nPreface and Acknowledgements Allinsons, Tim, David, and Christine. Thanks also to Kit and Jean Martin who were the first to give me clues in my quest for Fresca and generously welcomed me into their home. Oliver Mahony, Archivist at Lady Margaret Hall, also provided invaluable information early in the process. Eleanor Breuning, Jill Lewis, Alan Powers, and Matthew Eve, as well as Verity Elston and her colleagues at Compton Verney provided help learning about Enid Marx and Margaret Lambert. Caitlin Adams, Charles Lillis, the Wogan-Brownes, and the late Beryl Mackay, daughter-in-law of Eleanor Elder, helped me build my picture of Judy Wogan and the Arts League of Service. In the field of music and Tippett studies, Alain Frogley, Thomas Schuttenhelm, Justin Vickers, Meirion Bowen, Nicolas Bell, David I. Clarke and the late John Amis gave invaluable advice. I’d also like to thank Danyel Gilgan who shared anything he could find related to Wilf Franks and Fresca and Virginia-Lee Webb and Christopher Weathersbee about Den Newton. My wonderful colleague and friend Mark Hussey read all of this and was immensely supportive. Beth Daugherty, Sibyl Oldfield and Elizabeth Raisanen also read big pieces and gave me lots of excellent feedback. Jude Cook provided invaluable advice on my proposal and Stephen Rogers has been hugely helpful throughout the project, even accompanying me on some of my first excursions. Oliver Soden, working on his own biography of Michael Tippett, read everything and was hugely generous with ideas and suggestions. Many other colleagues and friends helped in myriad ways: Claire Battershill, Nicola Wilson, Alice Staveley, Elizabeth Willson-Gordon, Mike Widner, Alina Oboza, Ida Thuv, Paul Peppis, Mark Whalan, Heidi Kaufman, Leah Pickup, Catherine Brindley, Ellen Mulligan, Michele Taylor, Richard Taylor, Theresa Koford, Richard York, Kristin Barker, Danielle Curran, Michele Gladieux, Christi Binstadt, Dan Schmitt, Susan Lowdermilk, Mira Geffner, Hilary Ross, Midna Ross, Chulita Southworth, Jackie Jones, Susie Harries, Alexandra Harris, Helen Smith, Trevor Bond, Stephen Barkway, Stuart Clarke, Catherine Hollis, Greg Thomas, Kelly Sultzbach, Rachel Bowlby, Christine Froula, Diane Gillespie, Emily Kopley, Melba Cuddy Keane and colleagues and students at the Honors College at the University of Oregon, especially Carol Giantonio, Henry Alley, Roxann Prazniak, Susanna Lim, Vera Keller, Joseph Fracchia, Tonya White, Rabea and Deborah Stueckeman and Monique Balbuena. Very special thanks to my lovely friend Emma Fenton and her family, Simon Hall, Leo and Charlie, and also to my mother, Susan Franks, my father, John Franks, who died sadly during the writing of this book, and my nephew Oliver Franks.

The list is J. Howard Woolmer’s checklist of the books and pamphlets published by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press between  and . I am fascinated by networks, and Woolmer’s list of  titles represents an opportunity to begin charting the routes via which unknown authors and their works have made it into the hallowed cultural sphere of Bloomsbury. Woolmer, a rare book dealer, has organized his checklist by year and within each year names appear alphabetically. ‘Francesca Allinson’ stands at the top of the list for  shoulder to shoulder with eminent Bloomsbury philosopher, atheist and pacifist Bertrand Russell.\n\n From J. Howard Woolmer’s Checklist of the Hogarth Press.\n\nStrange bedfellows aren’t an unusual sight on the Hogarth Press list. Famous names sit side by side with names lost to obscurity. At the Hogarth Press, Freud, whose Beyond the Pleasure Principle appeared in its first English translation in , and T. S. Eliot, whose The Waste Land was published in its first English edition in , consort with long forgotten poets such as Ruth ManningSanders, author of Karn (), and Ena Limebeer, author of To a Proud Phantom (). These less recognizable names intrigue me. I want to know more about these writers whose literary lights glimmered momentarily and then faded. What \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 2\n\nPrologue stories lie behind these names on Woolmer’s list? I have had some luck tracking down Birmingham Group writer John Hampson, author of two novels at the Press, a very successful murder mystery set in a Derbyshire pub called Saturday Night at the Greyhound in  and a slower-selling growing-up novel called O Providence in . I’ve visited Hampson’s nephew, Roger Hubank, a retired English professor and writer of books about mountains, at his Loughborough home and he has given me access to Hampson’s correspondence and his censored homosexual writings. I’ve also made efforts to learn about New Zealand novelist Anna D. Whyte, like Hampson twice published by the Woolfs. In Whyte’s case, I have contacted Bill Manhire, professor of English at Victoria University in Wellington, NZ, via email. Whyte, he tells me, has been overlooked. No birthdate for Whyte and dismissive reviews of her ‘ship-board romance/light novel’ about ‘English People in Florence’ mean that I may well now be, Manhire suggests, ‘the world expert on Anna Whyte’. After Woolmer’s bibliography, I take down from my bookshelf J. H. Willis’s  history of The Hogarth Press, Leonard and Virginia Woolf as Publishers. Willis’s work is quite comprehensive, but I find no mention at all of Allinson there. Francesca Allinson, like Anna D. Whyte, appears to be in the overlooked category. Who is she and how did she move into the Woolfs’ orbit? I order a copy of Allinson’s book online and turn to the Internet for clues.\n\nThe first name to come up in connection with Allinson is British composer Sir Michael Tippett (–). Tippett’s contemporaries Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears are familiar names to me, but I know less about Tippett although he is considered one of the great British composers of the twentieth century, among his best-known works A Child of Our Time (), the secular oratorio based on a Negro spiritual and the events that triggered the Kristallnacht pogrom of . I read theories later about how the longevity of Tippett’s career impacted his fame and questions of celebrity and obscurity become puzzles for me across the length of my search for Allinson. I learn that Tippett had ties with the peace movement, that he was jailed as a conscientious objector during World War II and that he subsequently became chair and then president of the Peace Pledge Union. Like Britten and Pears, I discover, Tippett was an open homosexual. I check out of the library Tippett’s Those Twentieth Century Blues, published in  and labeled an autobiography. Although the book is disjointed, I can now piece together a first topsy-turvy portrait of Allinson. What becomes immediately clear is the intensity of the professional and personal connection that Tippett shared with the woman I now come to know as ‘Fresca’. In Tippett’s pages I find a love story which has a beginning, a middle and a tragic end. \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 3\n\nPrologue\n\n Young Michael Tippett.\n\nIn her first appearance in Those Twentieth Century Blues, Tippett refers to Fresca as ‘one of two women most crucial to my life’. Theirs is a dramatic first encounter. Tippett recounts how he met Fresca through his cousin Phyllis Kemp when Phyl was living in the Allinson family house in Christchurch Avenue, London, in approximately . Phyl was a student at University College London and she was one of a number of students the Allinsons took in. Fresca would have been  years old, Tippett . The connection is immediate, according to Tippett: ‘[T]here was Fresca with that huge goitre on her neck, from which she suffered so badly and for so long. Something happened between us.’ Revealing some first clues about Fresca’s heritage, Tippett says he stayed in  at a children’s home in Bavaria ‘started by a young couple, cousins of Fresca on her Berlin Jewish mother’s side’. Tippett refers next to a trip he and Fresca made to Germany in , at a moment when he ‘began to sense the importance of music-making and the theatre in communicating messages and ideas of significance, especially to the more deprived sections of the community’. The purpose of the trip, for Tippett, is to take a course in vocal music at Georg Goetsch’s Musikheim in Frankfurt an der Oder in preparation to run a Yorkshire work-camp for students and local people started by Rolf Gardiner, Alan Collingridge, Goetsch and Jim and Ruth Pennyman whose property is being used. Fresca’s German is better than Tippett’s and she helps him through choral recitation classes. They combine this trip to the Musikheim with walking in the Bavarian hills, over the Reisengebirge, ‘living rough and sleeping mostly in haybarns’, in so doing, says Tippett, ‘break[ing] free of a conventional type of existence’. From Frankfurt they travel on to Czechoslovakia, in part so that Fresca might pursue her love of puppets and her passion for baroque churches. After visiting Dresden, Tippett says, Fresca stays on in Germany with friends while he returns to England ‘and [they meet] up again in Boosbeck’. In a second mention of Fresca’s health, Tippett describes how walking in Germany presents \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 4\n\nPrologue a challenge for the ‘frailer’ Fresca and he suggests that Fresca is also motivated to accompany him because she feels it will ‘draw [them] closer together’. Fresca comes up again in terms of the Boosbeck camp for out-of-work miners in East Cleveland, Yorkshire, for which the trip to Germany has prepared Tippett. Fresca plays Lucy, according to Tippett, in his production of John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera, alongside the local milkman as Macheath and a miner’s daughter as Polly. Tippett and Fresca have by this time become fellow travellers in their young lives and both see music as a social and political force for change. Tippett’s subsequent activities include the Morley College based South London Orchestra, an orchestra for unemployed cinema and theatre musicians and recently graduated music students. This association is the result in part, he says, of his encounter with London Labour Choral Union conductor Alan Bush, introduced to him by Fresca in the late s. Tippett also mentions at this point another person who has come to him via Fresca, an actress called Judy Wogan. But his collaboration with Wogan on a piece called Miners, the text of which she has written, didn’t, he feels, turn out well. Tippett’s descriptions of Fresca’s sexuality complicate my understanding of her relationship with him. Clearly Tippett and Fresca are very candid with each other. With both Fresca and another important female friend, Evelyn Maude, Tippett ‘talk[s] openly and frankly about [his] problems’. Suggesting a strong heterosexual side to Fresca, Tippett has her declaring that Eric Kennington’s portraits of airmen are ‘marvelous examples of the heroic and the bedworthy’; and he describes Fresca’s trip to New York, following a trip to Switzerland to have her goitre operated on, for ‘one of what she called her “rutting sessions,” with men who had to be foreign or Jewish’. Tippett identifies himself as the object of Fresca’s heterosexual desires: she dislikes it ‘when [Tippett] appear[s] feminine in relation to other men’. She even wants to have or to raise a child with Tippett, asking whether he’ll marry her and accept a child conceived with another man. Although Tippett refuses to raise another man’s child, ‘having children through artificial insemination by the husband’ is discussed, as is marriage with Fresca. Nevertheless, Tippett also identifies with Fresca because of what he characterizes in both of them as ‘turbulent homosexual sides’, although their ‘own relationship was one of great serenity … For a while, Fresca went to live with a lesbian actress, but in the long term found this produced tension. Eventually she left saying that she was bringing into her life a turbulence which might have disturbed her life as an accepting lesbian and as an actress.’ Tippett then says that he ‘realised for [himself ] it was the other way round: [he] accepted the turbulence as necessary for creative work’. Following this is a paragraph outlining the three main streams of Fresca’s professional career: first, ‘her interest in puppets, [which was allied to] her work \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 5\n\nPrologue as a choral conductor—[including her direction] in Oxford [of ] a version of Orazio Vecchi’s madrigal comedy, L’Amﬁparnasso, with puppets’; second, her career as a writer, ‘(hence her identification with Virginia Woolf )’ and her ‘autobiographical volume, A Childhood ’; and, third, ‘her [absorption] in folk-song and [the help she provided Tippett in finding] the right tunes for [his] Robert of Sicily’.\n\nBut, by far the largest piece of Tippett’s autobiography dedicated to Fresca covers the period just prior to and during World War II. It is included in a chapter titled ‘The Heart’s Assurance’, the name of a work that Tippett dedicated to Fresca and which was first performed in  at The Wigmore Hall in central London. The return to Fresca follows a long section on Tippett’s homosexuality, his relationship with Bauhaus-trained artist Wilf Franks in the s and his dream analysis, where Fresca’s appearances suggest that she remained a confidante to Tippett. In the ‘The Heart’s Assurance’ section, there is more about Fresca’s influence on Tippett’s professional life, including her introduction to Tippett of the work of English composer Henry Purcell (–), her funding of Tippett’s first recordings and also her provision of living space for Tippett at her Mornington Terrace house. Here Tippett explains his pacifist stance, outlining the events that led up to his three-month-long imprisonment. Fresca, too, I learn from Tippett, supports the rights of conscientious objectors with the purchase of ‘a plot of land near East Grinstead [in Sussex], large enough to run as a smallholding’. Here ‘conchies’ can do land work instead of military service. According to Tippett, Fresca lives in a flat in East Grinstead and makes frequent visits to Tippett in Oxted, about  miles away. Tippett records the demise of ‘Fresca’s commune’, caused in part, he says, in another cryptic reference to Fresca’s love life, because Fresca is ‘having an affair with an older man—a conchie in the First World War’. Tippett mentions Fresca’s health again: Fresca’s return to London from East Grinstead is interrupted due to ill health ‘(probably as a result of having left the goitre operation too late)’. She’s forced to ‘go and stay a halfinvalid with her brother Cyril Allinson and sister-in-law, near Streetly End in Cambridgeshire’. At this point, Tippett reproduces a series of letters from himself to Fresca. This first batch of letters, the earliest of which date from , the latest , organized in two chronological sequences, deal mostly with Tippett’s composition work and, after , his preparations for his stay in prison. The letters suggest intimacy. Tippett encourages Fresca in her work on folksong. He shows concern for Fresca’s health: he’s glad an ulcer has been ruled out; he’ll be ‘thankful when [Fresca] is properly well’; and he regrets to hear she’s ‘off to Addenbrooke’s [hospital in Cambridge]’. Revealing a reciprocal rela\n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 6\n\nPrologue tionship, Tippett’s requests for Fresca’s support are myriad. He asks for help with his musical composition work and with money. Could Fresca housesit for him and run his Morley College choir should he be imprisoned? She’s the closest to himself that he can offer the choir. In one letter, dated , Tippett asks that Fresca accompany him to meet ‘[German conductor Walter] Goehr in the artist’s room & his wife, & Phyllis & the orchestra etc.’ in an official capacity, as ‘virtually wife—that’s to say something besides our joint selves, something public & professional’. In a kind of heterosexual masquerade, he asks that she not wear trousers, as she has told [mutual friend] Den Newton she plans to, but to come ‘in [her] proper dress [in which Fresca] always look[s] essentially feminine and good’. Fresca and Tippett also exchange gifts. A Raoul Dufy print and a painting by Fresca’s brother, painter Adrian Allinson, seem to have come to Tippett from Fresca. Interestingly in terms of a connection back to Fresca’s Hogarth Press book, Tippett mentions Virginia Woolf several times. Woolf appears to represent a shared language, a shared passion for Tippett and Fresca. Tippett writes to Fresca from Oxted on a Saturday in : ‘I think I must give you [a very early Christmas gift] “The Waves”’, ‘because it’s so much our own book in some curious intimate way. I’ll try to get it in London [en route to Cambridge from Oxted] on Thursday’. Later in this first series of letters, in an exchange dated ‘sat evening, ’, Tippett has just finished reading Woolf ’s To the Lighthouse: ‘such exquisite & mature art. I am not surprised the price was what it was for her.’ Woolf also makes a cryptic appearance in a scene involving Tippett’s and Fresca’s sexuality. After commenting that both had their ‘turbulent homosexual sides’, but confirming that ‘[their] own relationship was one of great serenity’, Tippett recalls an incident when they were walking arm in arm together ‘in a London square’. Tippett writes that when he said to Fresca ‘“you know we really belong to one another” […] she responded cryptically “You see that woman ahead of us. It’s Virginia Woolf.”’  Den [Douglas] Newton, described first as a conchie and a writer by Tippett in Those Twentieth Century Blues, is, at this point, an important link between Tippett and Fresca. Tippett comes to see Den at Fresca’s and Den takes provisions and reading material from Fresca to Tippett; Den relays information, such as Fresca’s plan to wear trousers to the concert. Other names that come up at this point are David Ayerst, John Layard, Jeffrey Mark, Karl Hawker and ‘Uncle Tom Eliot’. Tippett also makes another cryptic mention of Jude [sic] Wogan— he’s ‘glad to hear [her] voice on the ‘phone & what she said’. He ‘hope[s] it all comes out alright & a love based on the great quiet after the storm & not with admixture of hysteria any more’. Is Jude or Judy, I wonder, the lesbian lover to whom Tippett refers? \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 7\n\nPrologue A section titled ‘The Price of Pacifism’ follows the first batch of Fresca’s letters, consisting of a description of Tippett’s H.M. Prison Wormwood Scrubs experience and the reproduction of several letters exchanged with Evelyn Maude, his correspondent while in prison. After a few pages of comments about the post-war period, Tippett veers back quite suddenly to Fresca with another series of letters prefaced with the statement: ‘During the war period, Fresca and I shared each other’s troubles, ambitions and dreams.’ The first few letters are out of order, then there is a series from May to July/October  and a couple from January,  and , , reproduced in chronological order. A  letter about a work in progress that would become Tippett’s The Midsummer Marriage closes with ‘love to you both’. A  letter has Fresca in Cambridgeshire with Cyril and Veronica. A  letter that suggests both Fresca and Tippett are reading Edmund Wilson’s The Wound and the Bow, borrowed from the Times lending library, closes with ‘Please get well soon.’ On April , , Tippett is sorry ‘to see [Fresca] poorly again’, but on May  ‘relieved to hear [she’s] getting better again?’ Tippett mentions friends, including Newton, and looks forward to the time ‘when we can re-make our circle more permanently after the war; and that always seems to turn out in my mind as after your weakness passes’. Tippett asks Fresca for help with his Peace Pledge Union pamphlet (reproduced in Moving into Aquarius) and Fresca and he exchange reading materials, Plotinus for Turgenev. Again, in a letter dated June , Tippett mentions Virginia Woolf: he’s been reading her work and ‘as usual becoming so overcome by atmosphere as to lose sense of the here & now. It’s extraordinarily powerful stuff & feminine to a degree—in the best sense that is. Sometimes the artistry is uncanny.’ At this point Tippett reproduces a first letter from Fresca, dated ‘Invasion Day []’. It is an account of Fresca’s ‘waking dream’ followed by Tippett’s Jungian interpretation of the dream. In June , Tippett talks about Germany, fearing on the one hand, and wanting on the other, that ‘Germany [will] collapse’, that it ‘will be the scapegoat & will be dismembered & reduced to a colony of big business, with labour gangs snatched from Russia’. Suggesting an allegiance with Germany and things German, several letters are signed at this point in German, with herzlichkeit or warmly. At this time, Tippett briefly mentions Fresca’s poor health and discusses Fresca’s folk-song book: Tippett thinks ‘the new plan for chapter III excellent’ and he promises to pass on a recently purchased book, ‘Survey of Anglo-Saxon Art by [Thomas] Kendrick’ [Anglo-Saxon Art to A.D.  ()] which will provide inspiration. Tippett’s cottage is bombed in August . He moves in temporarily with friends in Sussex, then, once \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 8\n\nPrologue back in his cottage, appeals to Fresca for provisions. Tippett refers to Fresca’s ‘Alexander technique training’, designed to improve posture and muscle strength. After the letter dated January , , the closing four pages of this chapter move quite suddenly to Fresca’s death. ‘The last years of the war were also Fresca’s last years,’ writes Tippett. Tippett and Fresca try to live together but the experiment fails because Tippett’s music gets in the way. Unable to cope with her ill health and with the war, Fresca escapes from under the watchful eye of her family and takes her own life by drowning in the River Stour. She is wearing a cross, originally a gift from Evelyn Maude to Tippett that he had ‘insensitively’ passed on to Fresca. Fresca leaves notes for Tippett and for Judy Wogan. With Tippett’s letter she includes a ‘photograph, taken during [their]  [likely actually ] tour of Germany and Czechoslovakia, of [Tippett] with a little child; and a copy of Shakespeare’s sonnets open at No. LVII’. Tippett reproduces the Shakespeare sonnet and the suicide note in full. Tippett closes this chapter with a description of the piece he will dedicate to Fresca five years after her death. The Heart’s Assurance is a song cycle for high voice and piano, with music set to verse by two young poets, both of whom had died in World War II, Sidney Keyes at  and Alun Lewis at . Tippett says that ‘he widened [the work] to commemorate all those who lost their lives and loves in the brutality of battle’, as he feels that Fresca had in her way. I search Tippett’s autobiography unsuccessfully for a photograph of Fresca. I turn to Thomas Schuttenhelm’s edition of The Selected Letters of Michael Tippett which contains only letters written by Tippett. I do not find a picture of her there either. Suggesting that he too recognized Fresca’s importance, Schuttenhelm has placed Fresca fourth on the list of approximately twenty correspondents, preceded only by Adrian Boult, the BBC and Schott music publishers. Schuttenhelm’s selection of the letters to Fresca, larger than Tippett’s in Those Twentieth Century Blues, tells much the same story, although in greater detail. However, what the Selected Letters enables me to do that Those Twentieth Century Blues does not is to measure Tippett’s tone with Fresca against that used with other correspondents. The letters about Fresca to Den Newton are of particular interest. Was Fresca in love with Den and/or Den with Fresca? Details from Tippett’s letters to Den about what Fresca leaves catch my attention. Tippett tells Den that among Fresca’s papers is her unpublished folksong monograph that she hopes the two of them will complete. Tippett has ‘written to Veronica [Allinson, Francesca’s sister-in-law] about the MS and will go there to get it if necessary’. \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 9\n\nPrologue Most of the pile of F’s private papers are my own letter[s?] and one of yours. Between her bit of diary (with dreams) and my dreams and letter and bits of other things there’s a curious chunk of ‘shadow’ biography, which I shall keep for a while at any rate before destroying—or leave somewhere safe for you to read or destroy one later day when I am also in the cold ground. Her inner life is just the chaotic febrile world of imagination which a poet has to inhabit at times for his sins. But a woman has greater difficulty to express it artistically as a personal satisfaction. What is a ‘shadow biography’? I find it defined as a kind of negative image, an unauthorized version of a life that contains the information censored from the official version. My map, actual and metaphorical, is considerably more detailed at this point. I’ve found Fresca at several London addresses. While the Mornington Terrace house has been destroyed — a fact confirmed by an interactive website called bombsight.org, which lists it as a ‘hit’ — I find two Christchurch Avenues in London: one in Brondesbury, the right one, and another not far off in Brent. Uncannily, I realize that my usual London base, the home of my college friend Emma Fenton, is just several streets away from the Brondesbury address. I have also found Fresca in East Grinstead and in Cambridgeshire. The Selected Letters of Michael Tippett provides a full address for the Mill House in Cambridgeshire, so I dispatch a letter enquiring about the missing manuscript of the folk-song monograph with the thought that English houses, especially nice ones, often remain in the family.\n\nWhile I await a response to the Mill House letter, I receive Fresca’s A Childhood. The book represents my first material evidence, my first real piece of Fresca. On a first look, I am struck by the book’s resemblance to a child’s notebook. It looks like an exercise book creatively, but somewhat crudely, wrapped by a child in brown paper and made to look like a real book. In the cover’s whimsical repeat pattern of a child’s game of naughts and crosses, a blue crayon strikes through the winning line of crosses top left to lower right. The book’s title, author’s name and the name of the press are in a neat cursive, a child’s hand, black crayon shadowed with blue. The price,  s.  d. or seven shillings and sixpence, is set in a spiky circle on the spine. Confirming what I’ve learned from Woolmer’s Checklist of The Hogarth Press, A Childhood is a midsize hardback volume, with blue cloth boards; it comprises  pages. It is larger than some Hogarth Press books such as the Living Poets \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 10\n\nPrologue\n\n Dust jacket of A Childhood (Random House).\n\nor the various pamphlet series, but is nonetheless compact. I find no traces of ownership in my copy. The front fold of the dust jacket, down the side of which Enid Marx’s design repeats itself, holds the Press’s marketing blurb. The description of the book immediately complicates a reading of it, a caveat at odds with the more inviting cover. A Childhood, the blurb declares, is ‘[a] book by a new writer which it is not altogether easy to classify. It is either biographical fiction or fictional biography.’ The blurb then cites Fresca’s preface in full, a second warning against trying to find the author herself among its pages, while at the same time tempting one to do so: In the following pages, the seasons of one year pass and at the same time Charlotte grows from about nine to fourteen. I have left out all mention of her precise age; partly because it does not matter and partly because I have not wished to shut her in too closely within the exact hours and places of her own experience. Unavoidably, Charlotte is more like myself than anyone else: yet if she strikes you as odd, have patience with her, for many of her contemporaries felt and acted very much as she did. \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 11\n\nPrologue Complicating further the status of the work as standard autobiography, Fresca’s preface asserts that five years are condensed into a single year, a means, she suggests, to avoid ‘shut[ting the protagonist] in’ in terms of time and place. The resistance to identification suggests unease. The key seems to reside in the last sentence, which sets the book up as at once personal and universal and its protagonist as at once eccentric and a common type. The front fold identifies the designer of the dust jacket and of the wood engravings that preface each chapter as ‘Miss Enid Marx’. The cover page sports The Hogarth Press logo, Vanessa Bell’s Omega Workshop-like version rather than E. McKnight Kauffer’s more modernist wolf ’s head/printing press device inaugurated in . It also includes the familiar details of publication that put Fresca in the orbit of the two better-known names that have led me to her: PUBLISHED BY LEONARD & VIRGINIA WOOLF AT THE HOGARTH PRESS,  TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON, W.C.I, . The book has been printed in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, at the Garden City Press Ltd. All printing operations moved to the Garden City Press Ltd after  Mecklenburgh Square was bombed in . The Press operations had been transferred to Mecklenburgh Square from Tavistock Square in August  due to redevelopment plans. A table of contents follows the title page, listing seven simply titled chapters, ‘Illness’, ‘Sunday’, ‘The Forest’, ‘Seaside’, ‘More Seaside’, ‘Pity’ and ‘Preparations’. Last of all, taking me back to a name in Tippett’s Those Twentieth Century Blues, I find a dedication: TO JUDITH WOGAN.\n\nA few weeks later, I receive a response to my letter to The Mill House. The sender of the folded airmail envelope is Kit Martin. Kit tells me that Cyril and Veronica Allinson are deceased and identifies himself as their heir. He mentions Fresca’s Hogarth Press book, her suicide and subsequent burial at The Mill House. He also informs me that Fresca was a student at Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford and suggests I follow up with them. Among the items Kit gives me is a transcription of Fresca’s will, providing a treasure trove of information, an outline of Fresca’s life. Her legacies include an Essex wood, shares in a Sussex farm, a caravan, silver spoons, a typewriter, a Parker pen, a china crucifix, books and a recorder. As recent biographical work on Jane Austen by Paula Byrne and on now obscure writer and collector Mercedes de Acosta by Lisa Cohen suggests, objects owned by individuals, ‘[the] texture of things, [and the] life of objects’, tell us a great deal about our subjects. Fresca’s will is dated October , , six months prior to her suicide. Also included are handwritten or holograph instructions (unsigned) clearly recorded just before Fresca took her own life. \n\nFresca_02_Prologue 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 12\n\nPrologue\n\n Fresca at 16 (courtesy of Kit Martin; Allinson Estate).\n\nAlong with the will, Kit provides my first photograph of Fresca. This photo of Fresca aged  makes a stark contrast to the will, taking me back to the beginning of Fresca’s life, whereas the will marks its end. ‘What story lay in between?’\n\n\n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 13\n\nPART ONE\n\nA Childhood A\n\nLONG with Fresca’s will and photograph, Kit Martin provides a brief biog-\n\nraphical sketch. I learn that Fresca was born Enid Ellen Pulvermacher Allinson on August , , at  Spanish Place in Central London. She is the youngest of five children alphabetically named: Alfred, Bertrand, Cyril, Dulcie, who dies as an infant, and Enid, Francesca’s birth name. Twelve years separate the oldest, Alfred, born , who will change his name to Adrian, from the youngest, Fresca, born . Kit also gives details about Fresca’s education. Educated by German and French governesses, at  Fresca goes first to University College London. After an interruption due to ill health, she returns to college in , aged , but this time to Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford. Kit gives me the name of Fresca’s father—early whole foods, vegetarian and natural prescriptions guru Dr Thomas Richard Allinson, known as T. R. (–). Kit also includes a copy of Connoisseur magazine, which contains an article and a picture of brother Adrian skiing and a photograph of an unidentified woman on an Edwardian bicycle. The photo is in Cabinet Format, so named because the larger format portrait in its stout cardboard frame is designed to sit on a cabinet. I identify the bicycle as a  Model No.  Lady’s Special Premier with Leatherette Chaincase. At first I assume the woman with the bicycle is Fresca’s mother, but I later realize she is the Allinson family’s longtime German nanny and companion Clara Barkow, known as Tickie. Kit also provides a letter, dated , from Fresca’s niece Sonya Allinson who writes from  Clara Barkow (courtesy of Eavesham Road in Cheltenham, answering an Kit Martin; Allinson Estate). \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 14\n\nPart One earlier enquiry about Fresca and discussing a plan to mark Fresca’s grave. Sonya’s existence suggests the possibility of living relatives—perhaps she had known Fresca—and one of the next letters I write is to her.\n\nSonya’s first letters move me forward. Her memories of Fresca and those of her older sisters, Enid and Vanessa, are those of children, although the older girls would have been approaching twenty (Sonya only sixteen) when Fresca died. People have told me that they did not take photographs during the war and I wonder how the devastating events of wartime impacted other acts of memory. What Sonya does tell me about Fresca suggests an energetic and creative life, but also one haunted by tragedy. Enid and Vanessa remember Fresca ‘making notes and collecting songs, material for her book’. They have memories of Fresca’s puppets, ‘a small puppet theatre in her room at the top of grandmother’s house at  Christchurch Ave’; the puppets are ‘hung on hooks in the basement’. Fresca was a favorite aunt to ‘E and V’, according to Sonya; they ‘recall bathing in the nude and setting fire to the grass in the sand dunes’ when holidaying with Fresca at Cley-next-the-Sea in Norfolk and Toozie (St Osyth) in Essex. Fresca is also Sonya’s ‘favorite relative, the others being so eccentric and alarming’. Sonya describes Fresca as ‘kind [and] considerate, [she] made one feel important—delightful company, gay (in the old sense of the word) and always concealing her sadness’. Among the tragedies in Fresca’s life, according to Sonya, ‘was that she had very little love for her mother, indeed some revulsion, always blaming her ill health on the fact that Granny was too old when she was born and had never been a strong, healthy woman’. She suggests a connection between Fresca’s A Childhood and her real life in this regard: ‘This comes into the book.’\n\nSonya’s first letter to Kit has emphasized the celebrity of Fresca’s oldest brother and her senior by twelve years, the artist Adrian Allinson, his dates –. I turn to Adrian as a possible means to get closer to Fresca. Kit provides Adrian’s  unsigned Times obituary, titled ‘MR ADRIAN ALLINSON: PAINTER DETACHED FROM FASHIONS’. The obituary celebrates Adrian as painter, pacifist and mountaineer. It sounds a note of eccentricity and non-conformism that will repeat itself time and time again in terms of all of the Allinsons: Mr Adrian Allinson, the artist, died yesterday at his studio in London. He was . His complete detachment from fashions in art may be indicated by saying that he exhibited impartially at the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists and the London Group. In sympathy he was \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 15\n\nA Childhood with the ‘advanced’ people, but he kept his head, so that his work passed muster with the champions of orthodoxy. The principle that Allinson stood for was formal organization of the picture, leaving the question of degree of realism in representation to follow. By natural bent he painted close to the appearance of things, but his conscious effort was to compose them in an orderly and rhythmical design. He shirked nothing in carrying out his aim and the combination of realism with decorative disposition gave to his work a peculiarly arresting quality. This was intensified by his preference for landscapes in the South of Europe, Majorca and North Africa, where things are seen clearly in a strong light. His characteristic defect was to seem too rational and calculating. As is not uncommon with highly intellectual painters, he seemed to have more freedom and impulse in watercolour than in oil. Adrian Paul Allinson was born in  and he was at first intended for medicine, so that his early training was scientific and his scientific habit of mind was evident in his work, in the unflinching acceptance of botanical character in decorative flower paintings, for example. Deciding to give up medicine for art Allinson studied at The Slade School, where he won a scholarship in his second year, and afterwards in Paris and Munich. His first professional occupation was as a designer for the stage. Between  and  he was scenic designer for the Beecham Opera Company, and the value of this experience in clarifying his ideas, as well as of his taste for music, could be seen in his later work. Without prejudice to his loyalty Allinson held pacifist opinions, and since he was as uncompromising and outspoken in conversation as he was in his art this led to an unhappy difference with the late William Marchant, director of the Goupil Gallery, who refused to exhibit his pictures. It speaks for the general recognition of Allinson’s integrity that the hostility to him soon died down. For a time he taught at the Westminster School of Art. Besides painting he practised various branches of applied art, including sculpture in glazed pottery, and he was latterly poster designer to British Railways (Southern Region). Allinson’s first appearance at the Royal Academy was with two Swiss landscapes and a portrait, and thereafter he was a regular exhibitor, as well as at the New English Art Club and the other societies already mentioned and in several European cities. He was, however, most closely associated with the London Group and took an active part in its policies and in organizing its exhibitions. In his youth Allinson, who was an athletic, bearded man, earnest in conversation, was an active mountaineer; and he was a member of the \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 16\n\nPart One Alpine, British Universities and Kandahar Ski Clubs. He was married and had one son. I make quick progress digging up further information on Adrian, despite the fact that there is as yet no monograph focused on his work. To the facts provided by the Times obituary I add the following details: Adrian studied medicine at Middlesex Hospital and he organized a sculpture exhibition on the roof of Selfridges’ department store in . Looking online, I discover that the body of Adrian’s work is vast and varied. I find the biggest single collection at ‘Art UK’, a BBC site ‘which aims to show the entire UK national collection of oil paintings, the stories behind the paintings, and where to see them for real’. Adrian’s work includes landscapes, mostly alpine and Mediterranean, portraits, wood cuts, poster art, cover art, ceramics, cartoons and illustrations of ballets for ballet historian Cyril Beaumont’s books, including many of Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballet Russe ballet company. (Pictured [left to right]: Adrian Allinson’s ‘Dorothy in the Yellow Coat’, ‘Scene from Le Jardin des Amoureux’, a theatre poster [Victoria & Albert] and costume design for a Flame [Victoria & Albert]). A second string to his bow, Adrian also works as a translator, from both French and German. He has translated several works by Anatole France and a biographical study and two essays by Belgian symbolist writer Maurice Maeterlinck (), among other things. I also find Adrian on the peripheries of the lives of several famous Slade Art School graduates, including Bloomsbury figures Mark Gertler and Dora Carrington, as well as Edward Wadsworth, Christopher [C.R.W.] Nevinson, and Stanley Spencer. Adrian appears in David Boyd Haycock’s recent book\n\n ‘Jardin des Amoureux,’ by Adrian Paul Allinson, UK, 1911 (V&A).  Adrian Allinson’s ‘Dorothy in the Yellow Coat’ (Allinson Estate).\n\n\n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 17\n\nA Childhood\n\n Adrian Allinson’s costume design for a Flame in an unproduced ballet (V&A).\n\n Poster advertising George Bernard Shaw’s The Great Catherine at the Vaudeville Theatre, by Adrian Paul Allinson, UK, 1913 (V&A).\n\nabout The Slade School of Fine Art, A Crisis of Brilliance, and I find pictures of him there. In all of these, Adrian’s idiosyncratic personality stands out: first, at a Slade picnic in  where Mark Gertler and Edward Wadsworth sit to Adrian’s right and Stanley Spencer to his immediate left; and second, in John S.

They include composer Philip Heseltine (Peter Warlock) and writer Jean Rhys, both of whom he met at painter Augustus John’s Crabtree nightclub in the early part of the First World War. Rhys later describes her relationship with Adrian as a ‘semidemi love affair’. I find Adrian in one of Rhys’s short stories, entitled ‘Till September Petronella’. Rhys casts him as the awkward and unloved Marston, with ‘his long, white face and his pale-blue eyes’, opposite Heseltine’s more seductive Julian. Adrian responds, according to Lilian Pizzichini, by describing Rhys as beautiful, but also over-delicate and a wet blanket. Carole Angier explains that Adrian renamed Rhys Ella in his autobiography, which I have at this point yet to see.\n\n Nina Hamnett by Roger Fry.\n\n Jean Rhys.\n\n ‘Mr Watkins,’ portrait of Alan Odle, by Adrian Paul Allinson, UK, 1914 (HRC).\n\n Adrian Allinson’s portrait of Dorothy Richardson and Odle, undated (Beinecke).\n\n\n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 19\n\nA Childhood Through his friendship with painter Alan Odle, fellow St John’s Wood School of Art student and Café Royal drinker, Adrian also meets writer Dorothy Richardson, Odle’s wife, in about . Richardson describes Adrian as ‘always in difficulties with an endless succession of girlfriends’ and Odle’s biographer Martin Steenson suggests that it was the ‘lascivious Allinson’, not Odle, who seduced sculptor Nina Hamnett. Adrian and Richardson become lasting friends, Richardson editing his unpublished autobiography during a stay at her house in . (Pictured clockwise: Nina Hamnett by Roger Fry; Jean Rhys; Alan Odle [by APA]; Adrian’s portrait of Richardson and Odle, undated [Beinecke])\n\nAt this point I have run across several references to Michael Allinson, Adrian’s son and Sonya, Enid and Vanessa’s cousin. Searching online, I discover that Michael has become a Broadway actor, and I track him down via the New York social club the Players Club, of which he is the past president. Michael has been Rex Harrison’s understudy and has played Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady for many years on Broadway. He’s also had major roles in The Beaux’ Stratagem, Henry IV Part I, and The Importance of Being Earnest, in Shadowlands with Nigel Hawthorne, Oliver and An Ideal Husband. More recently, I note, Michael has had a small part, Sir David, in George Clooney’s film Syriana. Bruce of the Players Club calls Michael in Orange County, California, on my behalf and then calls me back with Michael’s number. Speak loudly, Bruce tells me. Michael (pictured here as Henry Higgins in ) has not lost his beautiful theatrical British accent. He is in his late eighties and he can’t remember very much about Fresca. Like Sonya, Michael affirms that Fresca was his favorite aunt. Sonya Allinson has told me that Michael ‘had his own room in Mornington Crescent (as did C & V [Cyril and Veronica] and, Tippett and perhaps others)’.  Playbill for My Fair Lady starring Michael Allinson.\n\n\n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 20\n\nPart One Michael is planning a version of My Fair Lady for a local venue. He has found an Eliza and she is ‘tall and tolerably good-looking’. He has tried out a performance at the retirement home and, he tells me, ‘the old crones were up out of their wheel chairs clapping’. He coughs and then apologizes, he broke a rib the week before. Michael clearly wants to talk and I see why the charming Michael was so easily able to become the philanderer I later learn he was. Michael mentions that he has two sons. I find son Tim Allinson, an engineer living in Orange County, just south of Los Angeles, on the Internet. Tim gives me a copy of Adrian’s autobiography, held with Dorothy Richardson’s papers at the University of Tulsa (which I had seen mentioned by Jean Rhys’s biographers). He also provides another photograph of Adrian, uncanny in its resemblance to the -year-old Fresca. This image has somehow found its way onto the cover of the Penguin Classics Complete Saki resulting, Tim tells me, in some confusion.\n\n Adrian Allinson (Allinson Estate).\n\n Adrian Allinson on the Penguin Classics Complete Saki cover (Penguin).\n\nAdrian’s autobiography, entitled A Painter’s Pilgrimage, proves invaluable in terms of understanding the Allinson upbringing. It represents a polished and detailed record, the result of Adrian’s efforts to ‘dress the body of [his own] book in the best suit of literary clothes it [was] in [his] power to cut’. He has ‘remodeled \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 21\n\nA Childhood the style three times’ and, in a reference to Richardson’s editing, has sought ‘the advice of more expert tailors than [him]self at each fitting’. Like Fresca, Adrian has ties to the literary world, socially, but also in his capacity as a translator and an illustrator of covers of little magazines such as Coterie, and he likely writes with an eye to publication. In his introduction, Adrian explains that he had planned to write his memoirs once an old man, however a ‘sequence of sleepless nights brought about by the London Blitz’ has precipitated him into the project a lot sooner than he’d anticipated. Forced to move into the Gloucestershire countryside, deprived of his brushes and inspiration, Adrian has turned to writing. He writes from memory, he says, not having accumulated the diaries and letters necessary for a more anchored account; and this he sees as giving him greater freedom. Adrian gives the actual date of composition of the autobiography as April , ‘when the very existence of Britain seems to hang in the balance’. The central theme of the first pages of Adrian’s autobiography, in a section titled ‘PARENTAGE’, is the thoroughly non-conformist nature of the Allinson family. Adrian characterizes father T. R. Allinson and mother Anna Pulvermacher as ‘rather outside the general ruck of the class and time to which they belonged’. He acknowledges that he too was ‘cast from the same freakish mould’. He is considered ‘by popular standards [to be] a queer fish, a freak, one of those “artist fellows”, whom much may be forgiven, but who at the same time cannot be taken quite seriously’. Adrian provides a detailed description of his father’s upbringing. Adrian’s T. R. is the hero of an adventure story who strikes out on his own. Raised in Lancashire by ‘a wealthy and ardent Catholic’ stepfather, although ‘of yeoman stock’ himself, Tom dodges a career in the priesthood, opting instead for medicine and ‘the extremes of Atheism [sic]’. Rejected by his stepfather, Tom works first as a chemist’s assistant before going to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine (qualifying in ). Tom’s next stop is London, where he opens a practice in Islington and sets about challenging ‘the orthodox medical methods of the day’ with an investigation of ‘problems of Hygiene and Diet from a common sense angle’. T. R. experiments first on himself, developing what Adrian calls ‘Spartan habits, in which the exclusion of all flesh foods, stimulants and narcotics was the predominating feature’. Despite ‘an equable temperament, which made social intercourse with him easy and frictionless’, T. R.’s ‘fanaticism, combined with an utter disregard of public opinion, his open condemnation of the medicine bottle and the surgeon’s knife’ lead to accusations of ‘quackery’. An ‘unconventional’ dress code means he was considered a ‘crank as well’. Adrian describes the marriage of his parents as one of convenience: T. R. realizes that ‘a married doctor inspires more confidence than a bachelor’. \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 22\n\nPart One According to Adrian, his father is motivated neither by love of a particular woman nor desire for family in selecting a wife. Finding that women who share his views on free thought and vegetarianism are few among the English middle classes, T. R. looks for a foreign wife. He chooses Anna Pulvermacher, identified by Adrian as the German friend of one of his patients and ‘born in Berlin of “liberal” Jewish parents’. Adrian’s first descriptions of his mother show her to have been a suitable choice for his father. Set on the profession of artist at the age of four, the headstrong Anna struggles through her father’s financial gains and losses on the stock market to achieve success as ‘a competent portrait painter’, her later work hung by the Royal Academy. Adrian describes his mother as a ‘a sound draughtsman [with an] unobtrusive technique and a sympathy for her sitters’. Her formal training, however, extends only to two years under the tutelage of ‘a fashionable portrait painter’. Confirming Anna’s gifts as a draughtsman, among items held by Kit Martin at the Mill House I find a sketchbook, dating from the s. Included is this sketch of Clara Barkow, the woman on the bicycle, whom I’d misidentified earlier on as Anna, and two figures at work, one sewing (or perhaps lacemaking), the other reading, likely Anna’s parents.\n\n Anna Pulvermacher’s sketches (courtesy of Kit Martin; Allinson Estate).\n\nAnna’s dedication to art influences Adrian’s decision to become an artist, in particular his selection of The Slade, although it seems neither mother nor son knew much about the school before he went there. Anna had taken a few classes there herself, without however realizing the prestige of the school. Anna’s love of music also represents a ‘pleasurable memory’ for Adrian. \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 23\n\nA Childhood However, despite these shared interests, mother and son do not see eye to eye. Adrian portrays Anna, rather cruelly, as rigid and sexless, characteristics that inevitably produce tension between Anna and her children: ‘There had been no flirtations or love affairs in her life and in any case she lacked the type of feminine looks and charm [allure] that attract easy attention from men. [. . . ] She was conscientious to a fault and dominated by a sense of duty, but showed a lack of humour and of attractive feminine foibles. In later years an aggressive dogmatism introduced an element of friction between her and her family.’ And in another short description, Adrian takes his critique a step further: Had mother been endowed with specifically feminine charms, those early days might have contained for me elements of ecstasy which fall to the lot of most children, illuminating childhood with unforgettable moments of glory. My memory records no such experiences; an ordered and controlled animal well-being devoid both of highlights or deep shadows fill the canvas. Consistent with both parents’ penchant for austerity, T. R.’s northern English thrift and Anna’s German immigrant background, and despite his mother’s artistic talents, the Pulvermacher Allinson home life, according to Adrian, is plain and restrained. The ‘shoddily furnished’ house accommodates ‘bamboo monstrosities, ill designed chiffoniers and overmantles’ not uncommon at this period for families of their rank, Adrian admits. The walls are ‘closely hung’ with Anna’s portraits ‘mainly versions of ourselves at all ages’, says Adrian, ‘which we did not find stimulating to our young imaginations’. Adrian speculates that his own preference for landscapes over portraits and his interest in ‘design and colour’, absent from his mother’s work, may have resulted from ‘this early surfeit of faces’. The children are occasionally treated to a theatre visit, albeit with cheap seats in the pit. The mantra at home is ‘Moderation in all things’ and the family motto ‘Live and let live.’ T. R. discourages ‘luxurious habits through an over generous distribution of pocket money’. Adrian admits that, in retrospect, he appreciates the lessons he has learned about respecting all animals (‘I am happy’, he says, ‘in the thought that no fish, bird or beast has died for my entertainment’), but he wishes that the ‘moderation’ principle had itself been applied with more moderation. ‘We grew up in an atmosphere of rationalism and philosophic nihilism. George Bernard Shaw was the family patron saint,’ writes Adrian. ‘His satire and devastating criticism of current cant and humbug were our mental food, so that all the tender fantasies and charming nonsense dear to children never came our way.’ \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:38 Page 24\n\nPart One Adrian’s account also brings perspective on the broader Allinson family. ‘Neither T. R. nor Anna had strong attachments, father having left Manchester as a young man and mother having emigrated from Germany.’ Adrian describes the ‘entire absence of close relatives’ on both sides, with the exception of ‘some cousins by marriage of his mothers’, in strong terms, as resulting in ‘emotional [. . .] starv[ation]’. Anna’s death certificate, which I find along with the sketch book at the Mill House, names niece Sofie Ehrlich of a York Street, Berlin (New Hampshire, US, or Germany), and cousins Mrs Rosy Myers and Mrs Nash; the census lists Esther Gershon as a ‘cousin’. Adrian mentions a visit to an aunt in Berlin when he was ; he also calls Broadway actress Lena Maitland ‘cousin’. Adrian explains that his father is so preoccupied with work that ‘there was little entertaining in our house’. T. R. finds the company he needs among his patients who ‘run to the tens of thousand [and are] drawn from every rank of life’. The few guests that do make it to the Allinson table are oddballs, according to Adrian. Among them is Louis de Rougemont, famous for his tall tales of experiences amid cannibals appearing in the Wide World Magazine, and champion woman cyclist and vegetarian Miss Simons. Perhaps explaining his presence at the Allinson table, de Rougemont had invented an unsuccessful meat substitute during World War I. Despite the negative portraits of Anna in particular, Adrian closes the first section of his autobiography with retrospective optimism about his upbringing. Adrian’s description confirms the source of the Allinson children’s unconventionality: ‘The general tenor of home life was one of advanced liberalism from which the usual Victorian taboos and smugness were entirely lacking. Father was a rebel whose refusal to kowtow to the conventions laid down by the British Medical Association had caused him to be crossed off the medical register. Far from handicapping him, this allowed him to pursue his chosen course.’ And he closes with: ‘Freedom in fact was the keynote of our upbringing and if I had been given a conscious choice of parents, I doubt I could have bettered the one made for me’ (my emphasis).\n\nAdrian writes in his autobiography that it isn’t until his secondary school that he realizes his ‘race’ puts him at a disadvantage—and he appears to mean by ‘race’ his Germanness rather than his Jewishness. In one of only a handful of mentions of Jewishness in the autobiography, Adrian describes fellow Slade student painter Mark Gertler’s Jewishness as something foreign to himself and makes no reference to his own heritage. Adrian writes: ‘Born in Whitechapel, [Gertler] was sensitive of his origin and background but our friendship was inti\n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:39 Page 25\n\nA Childhood mate enough for me to be invited to his home. The East End was “terra incognita”; visits there seemed quite an adventure. The jostling crowds of Russian, Polish and Central European Jews had so transformed this corner of London that I felt I was going abroad but minus the expense and discomfort entailed.’ Jewishness has come up in Fresca’s A Childhood. In her second chapter, entitled ‘Sunday’, Fresca’s protagonist Charlotte’s friend Thea is Jewish. Again, here Jewishness is held at a remove. Perhaps heralded by Charlotte’s imaginary other, Lizzie Simpkins of chapter one, I wonder if red-headed, green-eyed impulsive Thea might be a second alter ego for Fresca/Charlotte. The lesson in this second chapter is justice and maybe Fresca feels that it is from the GermanJewish side of the family that she has acquired a sense of fairness. At the end of ‘Sunday’, the impulsive Thea ‘unable to endure an insufficiently final religion as well as her own violent temperament, is shortly to meet someone who would convert her to the Roman Catholic religion’. Supporting the idea that Thea is Fresca, Sonya tells me that Fresca converts to Catholicism as a teenager. In a letter (that comes to me later in the research process) to Miss Fletcher, tutor at Lady Margaret Hall, Fresca’s friend Margaret Lambert explains Fresca’s name change. She says that T. R. Allinson ‘being a strict rationalist of the Victorian stamp gave his children names alphabetically and had them registered, not baptized. When [Fresca] became a convert to Catholicism in her teens she took the baptismal name of Francesca and by that name all her friends knew her.’ Adrian’s Germanness appears to have represented a more significant issue than did his Jewishness. After election to the artists’ exhibiting society, the London Group in , Adrian’s affiliations with Germany, both his blood and his sympathies, result in his exclusion from an exhibition at the Goupil Galleries: ‘In the autumn of ’ when war fever seemed at its most virulent Marchant, the owner of the Goupil Galleries where our annual shows were held, sent an ultimatum to the Group.’ Marchant (–), London art dealer, son of a Bristol iron-founder, insists that ‘no enemy aliens, conscientious objectors or sympathizers with the enemy were permitted to exhibit in his galleries, and should the Group contain any of these, his walls would be closed down’. Adrian knows that ‘this shot was aimed mainly at [his] own head as [he] was reputed to embrace all three elements in one person’. Although ‘it was unanimously agreed [at a special meeting] that politics should be kept out of the domain of Art and the Group rejected Marchant’s terms’, no other gallery is available. Adrian withdraws his work ‘on condition that [the group] sever [their] connection with [Marchant] after its termination’. When World War I breaks out, Adrian is in Dieppe with artist Walter Sickert. Adrian explains his lack of concern for England and an objection to war, which would flower into conscientious objection, again with an oblique \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:39 Page 26\n\nPart One reference to the German blood running in his veins: ‘In England too, the warfever raged, but somehow I seemed immune; was there not enough British blood in my veins for me to catch it, or were there other reasons?’ He has been brought up, he says, ‘to consider the taking of life—whether animal or human—as a crime’. And, further, in terms of Germany, family ties complicate his support of the war: ‘The stay in Munich [with an aunt, as a boy] had tended to make me look upon Germans as a people much like ourselves, little variations of temperament and habits of life seemed all that differentiated the two peoples. Possibly the shallow judgment of youth, but it was mine and I clung to it. Today I still cling to it.’ I later discover that similar experiences motivated Fresca’s conscientious objection.\n\nDuring World War I there is much anti-German sentiment in England. Prohibition includes a wartime ban on the sale of German-made products in shops and on German classical music. Robert Graves and Alan Hodges, in their The Long Week-End: A Social History of Great Britain –, report that ‘[t]he popular Press continued to refer to the Germans as Huns even so late as ; nor was any faith given to the complaint of Germans during the Armistice period that they were starving—as many of them were’. The Allinson family’s Spanish Place home is just around the corner from the concert hall now called the Wigmore Hall. Given the family’s interest in music, it is likely they attended, or at least knew about, some of the early performances which featured ‘Artur Schnabel, at the age of , play[ing] a recital so successful that a second was hastily arranged []; composers Percy Grainger and SaintSaëns [. . .]; Melba and Caruso [singing]; [and] -year-old Thomas Beecham [giving] his first concert []’. Built by and originally named for German piano makers Bechstein, the building, which opened in May of  as a piano showroom with a -seat concert hall, just a year before Fresca’s birth, is seized as enemy property in  and sold to Debenhams at a drastically reduced price before reopening as Wigmore Hall in . The Pulvermacher Allinsons likely witness this seizure and sale with some trepidation. I find online parliamentary records in the form of an order for and an appeal against governess Clara Barkow’s deportation in  that provide evidence the family is indeed touched by Germanophobia, and possibly also anti-Semitism. GERMAN GOVERNESS. (REPATRIATION).\n\nHC Deb  April  vol  cc-W W Colonel Josiah WEDGWOOD asked the Home Secretary whether it is intended to deport to Germany, \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:39 Page 27\n\nA Childhood against her wish and that of her employers, Miss Clara Barkow, aged fiftytwo, who has been in the employ of Dr. T. R. Allinson, of , Spanish Place, for the last twenty-five years as governess, etc., seeing that she has no relations or financial interests in Germany? §Mr. Edward SHORTT Repatriation has been postponed for the present, pending further consideration of the case. I learn from Sonya Allinson that Barkow (–) was not only governess to the Allinson children, but also T. R.’s secretary, Anna’s companion and ultimately housekeeper to Fresca. That Barkow’s repatriation was a real possibility is reflected in the fact that the size of the German population in England more than halved between  and . I also find an announcement of Bertrand Pulvermacher Allinson’s name change to Bertrand Pater Allinson in the London Gazette on May , . He is living at Christchurch Avenue. ‘I [. . .] a natural born British subject [. . .] give notice that by deed poll dated th April, , enrolled in the Central office of the Supreme Court, I formally and absolutely relinquished my second forename of Pulvermacher, and adopted the second forename of Pater.’ Most of the other name changes listed alongside Bertrand’s were clearly from the German: from Guggenheim to Gillingham, Franzke to Franks, Pfeiffer to Fifer, Paternheimer to Wheatley, Tautz to Tower. I later find Cyril’s notice also in the London Gazette, but a year earlier, January , . Cyril chooses the name of Thackeray’s young English hero, Pendennis. Kit Martin also has deed pole documents for Adrian who chooses to change his Pulvermacher to Paul, perhaps, I speculate given the moment and Adrian’s professional choices, in honour of painter Paul Gauguin (–) or maybe Paul Morel of D. H. Lawrence’s Sons and Lovers (). These are not the only name changes made by the Allinson children. Adrian’s grandson Tim asks me why I think Adrian changed his name from Alfred. Adrian means ‘dark’ in German, and in Greek it translates as ‘wealthy’; Paul means ‘small, humble’, and, like Francesca, which appropriately means ‘free’, it has a Catholic connection. Brother’s and sister’s choices bring to mind Dante’s Divine Comedy’s Paolo and Francesca. Paolo and Francesca were painted in  by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, himself both artist and poet, double like Francesca and Adrian. In choosing Adrian and Francesca, neither Alfred nor Enid upset the alphabetical sequence of names chosen by their father.\n\nIn an effort to gauge how close Fresca and Adrian were, I check Fresca’s will again, but find no mention of either Adrian or son Michael, despite the fact that \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:39 Page 28\n\nPart One both are still alive when Fresca dies. Fresca’s other siblings appear: Bertrand P. Allinson as B. P., and Cyril in his capacity as the will’s executor; nieces Enid, Vanessa and Sonya are all named. I go back to Tippett looking for mentions of Adrian. I find one reference to a painting and another to Adrian’s attendance of a concert in . Considering the possibility that Adrian links Fresca to the Woolfs and to the Hogarth Press due to his immersion in a Slade School of Art scene that is closely tied to Bloomsbury, I also consult Woolf ’s letters and diaries. I find just one mention of Adrian, an unfavorable one. In a letter of , Woolf tells her sister, painter Vanessa Bell, that she has been to an exhibition of the London Group and that she ‘couldn’t bear Allinson’. In part as a result of the age difference between the two, Adrian mentions Fresca only briefly in his autobiography. However, when she does appear, it is in terms of collaboration and, in the most important instance, in reference to what Adrian characterizes as the ‘astonishing resemblance’ between himself and his youngest sibling. In her first appearance in the autobiography, Fresca joins Adrian’s wife Joan in an effort to promote one of Adrian’s art shows. The two women don sandwich boards and parade up and down the streets of the East End. This stunt, Adrian admits, does not improve the attendance at his exhibition, but the newspapers pick up the story. In a second appearance, in an important section on music, Adrian expresses regret that he and Fresca didn’t see as much of each other as they might have. He describes them as similarly double in terms of their devotion to the arts, he art and music, she writing and music. Interestingly, for Adrian this double-ness represents both a positive and a negative: I sometimes think that if the advantages of a first-class musical education had been mine in childhood, as was the case with Francesca, a sister twelve years my junior, I might have devoted my life to this art. There has been only one reference to her in these pages, the discrepancy in our ages having prevented her playing the part in my life which her astonishing resemblance to me might otherwise have determined. Francesca is blessed, or if you will, cursed with the same many-sidedness with this difference, that is the second string to her bow is literature. Adrian’s comments about his and Fresca’s dedication to multiple art forms remind me of a folding screen by Adrian (–) that I have seen at the Victoria and Albert Museum website. ‘Allegories of the Arts’ depicts a musician composing, a painter at his easel, actors on stage and a writer at his desk. \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:39 Page 29\n\nA Childhood\n\n Adrian Allinson’s ‘Allegories of the Arts’ (V&A).\n\nI wonder if Adrian was at home very much when Fresca was growing up. In his autobiography, Adrian mentions that while at The Slade, up through , when Fresca would have been , ‘[he] had [his] studio at the top of the parental mansion to which [he] could invite [his] friends at all hours of the day or night, and though pocket money was limited, it sufficed for the needs of the moment’. This suggests that Fresca might have come into contact with some of Adrian’s friends and fellow students. Did Fresca witness an episode in which Adrian burst into his father’s bedroom late at night seeking medical help after overdosing on absinthe and hashish? Was she aware that Adrian was sheltering for a time his friend John Currie’s mistress at the family home—an act of kindness on Adrian’s part which nonetheless horrified the housekeeper? Even if Fresca missed these incidents, Adrian’s selfdescribed dandyism and his bohemian lifestyle, as well as his stance as a conscientious objector beginning in World War I, must, I believe, have made an impression on her. Adrian is, in his own words, ‘a slender young man with sloping shoulders, rather above middle height; [his] face, abnormally long, of a high colour and decorated with side whiskers. The forehead is high and boy[ish] as are the cheekbones; and the sensuously curved lips are of so carmine a tint, that [he] was frequently but erroneously accused of applying lipsticks’. Adrian prefers ‘early Victorian dress, with a preference for check trousers, black jacket, a stock tie and frilled shirt’. ‘[A] shock of wavy brown hair complete[d] a picture that evoke[d] \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:39 Page 30\n\nPart One the epithet “Byronic.”’ His ‘passage through the London streets [was] punctuated by “raspberries”, titters or stares’. Although frequently and understandably ‘taken for a pervert’, Adrian’s ‘amours’, he asserts ‘[ran] along orthodox lines’. Despite the datedness of his dress, Adrian’s taste in transport ran to the ultra-modern and he was ‘almost inseparable from [his] motorcycle’. ‘Occasionally the half penny Press would publish a portrait of me with a caption to the effect that this sort of exterior was just permissible in peacetime but that we were now at war.’ Adrian emerges from The Slade with ideas about art and democracy that anticipate his younger sister’s commitment to social justice. Adrian espoused a more utilitarian view of art than his Slade professors, ideas which remind me of those which motivated Roger Fry to open his Omega Workshop in . Looking back, Adrian asserts that ‘The Slade concentrated too much upon the training of students for a career in “Fine” art.’ He says that ‘[he] would rather see a well-designed and executed fabric, chair or pot in a room than any number of indifferent pictures [and that he] prefer[s] a really good reproduction of a great painting on a wall to an original canvas of poor quality’. ‘It is the “how” rather than the “what” that matters in the artist’s contribution to life. In the last resort we are more moved by imperfection than by perfection, however humble the former or grandiose the latter.’ Along similar lines, in an article about economics and the theatre which appeared in The New Age in January , when Fresca was , Adrian argues that ‘a freedom of economic and social intercourse [such as that enjoyed by the Greeks] must exist in the life of the modern Anglo-Saxon democracy before we can hope for any renaissance of a vital stage art. The efforts of men like Barker, Shaw, Galsworthy and Craig, and of women like Miss [Annie] Horniman and Margaret Morris are almost of necessity doomed to failure and will remain so until the shackles, economic and social, which hinder the development of our democracy, are broken asunder.’ These same ideas about art and democracy will direct Adrian’s choices for a set of murals that he paints at cost for Fresca’s alma mater, Lady Margaret Hall, mentioned in the autobiography. Unfortunately, Lady Margaret Hall has no record of these murals. At this time I carried out two nine-foot mural decorations for Lady Margaret Hall, the women’s college in Oxford, of which my sister had been a graduate. As the college had recently been enlarged, and all available funds had been spent leaving nothing in reserve for ‘mere decoration’, I agreed to work for nothing on condition that at least my out-of-pocket expenses for materials should be guaranteed. So poor was L.M.H. that the women students were asked to subscribe a pound per head for this purpose! The \n\nFresca_03_Pt1 10/04/2017 16:39 Page 31\n\nA Childhood Principal and her attendant dons visited my studio in a body to see what sort of work I did and discuss the scheme. The ladies were enthusiastic over what they saw and left me carte blanche as to subject and treatment. In theory, this seemed the ideal condition for work, but in practice it left me with the difficult problem of choosing an idea that would please both them and the students; I would rather have been nailed down to a specified subject. As the College could not afford to keep me in Oxford during the process of painting directly on to the walls, I had panels made and executed my designs in my London studio. The theme I chose for the decorations which were to cover two asymmetrical spaces in the Common Room of the College was ‘Leisure’ wherein the idle hours of rich and poor women were contrasted. The wealthy reveled in an idyllic Italian landscape while the poor were confined to the slums of a modern industrial city.\n\nI visit Sonya and Vanessa Allinson for the first time in October . After purchasing flowers on Paddington Station platform I take the train out west through first an unattractive London suburb and then into the Cotswolds. Although I have traversed this portion of England before I’m not prepared for the ancient quality of the landscape and its beauty is a fitting prelude to the grace of the women I am about to meet. When I arrive at Sonya’s retirement home, Astell House, in Cheltenham, late in the day per Sonya’s request I find her apart from the rest of the residents, at the top of the house in a little sitting room of her own. While waiting, I sit in a common room and watch the other lady residents doze in front of a Clint Eastwood movie. The television issues American expletives and gunfire while the Queen and her corgis look down on us from a photo frame on the mantelpiece. The retirement home staff prepares us some tea and biscuits. Vanessa arrives late with more biscuits and chocolate rolls, having had trouble locating a taxi. Sonya is small and shy, Vanessa tall and attractive. The"
