His character would become the second husband to w:c:emmerdale:Annie Sugden and appear intermittently until he killed off during the plane crash storyline. Leonard died on the episode transmitted on 30th December 1993 (episode 1829) but his body was still seen in w:c:emmerdale:Joe Sugden's car on 5th January 1994 (episode 1831).\n\nThis would appear to be Bernard's last television role before he retired from acting.\n\nSources[]\n\nGaughan, Gavin. 7 May 2008.
