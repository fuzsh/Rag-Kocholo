        "text": "Finally, many secret weddings took place in the precincts of the Fleet Prison, London, from 1667-1754, and over a thousand of these involving Sussex people are included. The only limitation is that the Index does not normally include records after the introduction of General Registration in July 1837.\n\nThe Index was originally compiled on slips by a dedicated team, lately from the Sussex Family History Group (SFHG), over a 30-year period from a variety of sources, with modern transcripts used in many cases. These can be of varying reliability, depending on the clarity of the original and the palaeographic skills of the transcriber. Subsequently another team input these slips to word processor (and latter, database) with, of course, further possibilities of error.\n\nAs the amount of data provided in the Index also varies (witnesses names are not always given, for instance) recourse should always be made to the original PR and/or BT for confirmation and possible further details. This cannot be emphasized too much."
