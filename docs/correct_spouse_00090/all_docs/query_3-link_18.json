        "text": "I am trained as a medical sociologist and I have an interest in mixed-methods research, qualitative research and evaluation research. A large share of my academic work has been in the fields of Public Health, Health Promotion and the Organisation of Maternity Care. I have substantial research experience in conducting large-scale comparative studies, usually applying interdisciplinary and mixed-methods approaches.\n\nI have been involved in evaluating large-scale community-based public-health interventions in Scotland funded by, for example, the Chief Scientist Office (Scottish Government, Edinburgh), the Wellcome Trust, and NHS Health Scotland.\n\nI have has also published on various aspects of research methods in a format easily accessible to a lay audience, including a paper on research ethics published in a midwifery journal.\n\nMy international research is largely based in Nepal. We are involved in several research projects in the community with Green Tara Nepal to improve health and well-being of poorer people in Nepal... In 2009 we started a DelPHE grant in collaboration with the oldest university in Nepal, Tribhuban University, the University of Aberdeen and Green Tara Nepal. This interdisciplinary project: Improving Access to Research Literature for Higher Education Institutions in Nepal (PARI Initiative) helped build research capacity at Nepalese universities.\n\nIn 2020 we started an interdisciplinary project, led by the University of Sheffield, examining the consequences for the health system of Nepal’s move to a federal government structure. The three-year project is UK-funded by the MRC, Wellcome Trust and DFID under the Health Systems Research Initiative. The project is collaboration between researchers at the Universities of Sheffield, Bournemouth (Prof. van Teijlingen) and Huddersfield in the UK and the Manmohan Memorial Institute of Health Science and PHASE Nepal in Kathmandu.\n\nIn early 2021, the UKCGE (UK Council for Graduate Education) awarded me Recognised Research Supervisor status.\n\nmore\n\nDelPHE (Round 4), British Council: Partnership on Improving Access to Research Literature for HE Institutions in Nepal (PARI Initiative), £ 53,000 for three years (with Prof. Ram Sharan Pathak & Dr. Bhimsen Devkota (both Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu, Nepal, Dr. Padam Simkhada (University of Sheffield) and Prof. Edwin van Teijlingen from BU’s School of Health & Social Care, and also Visiting Professor at Manmohan Memorial Institute of Health Sciences (MMIHS) affiliated with Tribhuvan University.\n\nThe PARI Initiative aims to improve evidnece-based practice in Higher Education in Nepal, in short trying to move away from textbook teaching in health care and teach Nepali students about finding the most appropriate evidence-based treatment for each patient. PARI will help to refocus curricula in Nepal with greater emphasis on research information.PARI has attracted considerable media coverage in Nepal, e.g. http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Make+education+research-oriented%26sbquo%3B+says+expert&NewsID=367115\n\nFor further details on BU webpages see:\n\nwww.bournemouth.ac.uk/hsc/news/2013/feb/ne001-pari-project-improves-research-nepal.html\n\nFor academic output see:\n\nhttps://wfpha.confex.com/wfpha/2012/webprogram/Paper9064.html\n\nEdwin is the joint lead with Prof. Aminur Rahman from CIPRB (Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh) of a project called Sonamoni. This project aims to reduce the deaths of newly-mobile toddlers from drowning in rural Bangladesh. BU is leading on this interdisciplinary study of nearly £1.7 million funded by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) till 2026... This multidisciplinary project is a collaboration of BU’s Centre for Midwifery & Women's Health (CMWH), BU’s Department in Accounting, Finance & Economics and Department of Design & Engineering, and external partners, namely the University of the West of England, the University of Southampton, the Poole-based Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), Design Without Borders and the already mentioned CIPRB.\n\nThe second large-scale project Edwin is involved with 'ENSURE-Nepal' is led by La Isla Network (USA). This project is in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health (USA), Nepal Development Society and Bournemouth University are leading the first-ever international effort to research and address trafficking among Nepalese migrant workers. The work is funded by a US $4 million cooperative agreement awarded by the U.S. Department of State’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, International Programs for the period 2022-2027.\n\nmore"
