        "text": "English: locative name, occupational name presumably for the keeper of a bellchamber, the room where bells were hung in a bell tower or in a belfry, from Middle English (Old English) belle âbellâ + Middle English (Old French) chambre âroomâ. However, the compound is not recorded in OED before 1848. A keeper of a bellchamber may also have been the bell ringer."
