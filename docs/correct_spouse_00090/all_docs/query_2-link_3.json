        "text": "Bernard Archard was a reliable character actor of authoritative demeanour who spent the best part of his career in supporting parts, becoming a recognisable face, if not a name, while occasionally getting the chance to do more.\n\nFor Archard this opportunity came in 1959 when he was cast as Lt-Col Oreste Pinto in the BBC series Spycatcher, which was based on true events. Pinto was a Dutch intelligence officer, reckoned to be one of the best at winkling out spies, who was based in Britain during the Second World War.\n\nSpycatcher was usually confined to a single room with a table and two chairs, and was essentially a two-hander featuring Archardâ€™s Pinto, and the man he was trying to unmask as a German spy.\n\nTall,"
