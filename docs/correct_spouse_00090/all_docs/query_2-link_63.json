LONDON: PRINTED FOR HER MAJESTY'S STATIONERY OFFICE, BY EYRE AND SPOTTISWOODE, PKINTERS TO THE QUEEn's MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. And to be purchased, either directly or through any Bookseller, from EYRE AND SPOTTISWOODE, East Harding Street, Fleet Street, E.G. ; or JOHN MENZIES & Co., 12, Hanover Street, Edinburgh, and 90, West Nile Street, Glasgow; or HODGES, FIGGIS, & Co., Limited, 104, Grafton Street, Dublin. 1896. Pyice Fourteen Shillings. PREFACE. The Bills and Answers in Chancery preserved in the Public Record Office from the reign of Elizabeth to that of Charles the First, inclusive, are arranged in two Series. To the first of these there are old manuscript indexes, which give only the surnames of the plaintiffs and defendants, without any indication of the subjects of the different suits or of the counties. The Commissioners on the Public Records, considering that the information thus afforded was inadequate, caused a new index to be begun on a very elaborate and expensive scale, and, between the years 1827 and 1832 three large folio volumes of it were published, under the title of \" Calendar of the Proceedings in Chancery in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.\" This calendar was printed in tabular form, the first column giving the necessary references to the documents, the second the christian names and surnames of the plaintiffs, and the third those of the defendants. The fourth column states the objects of the suits, the fifth describes the premises, and the sixth specifies the counties. Each volume is provided with an Index Locorum and an Index Nominum. A certain number of suits, apparently of minor importance, which are noticed in the manuscript index of surnames, were, however, omitted from this Calendar. No serious attempt has yet been made to supersede the old indexes of names for the reigns of James I. and Charles I., although that for the latter reign has been printed by the Index Society. It is to be hoped that some steps will hereafter be taken in this direction. The Second, or Supplementary, Series, to which the present volume is the first instalment of a calendar or index, consists of a large collection of Bills and Answers, extending from the reign of Elizabeth to that of Charles the Second inclusive, of which 102 bundles only had been indexed at the Tower, under the title of \"Miscellaneous Chancery Proceedings,\" the index consisting of three manuscript quarto volumes. The remainder of the collection, comprising some 400 bundles, were altogether undescribed, and therefore inaccessible to the searcher. To these have been added a great number of analogous documents which have been brought to light by the recent classification of the contents of the Public B/eoord Office, and which by the carelessness of former custodians had been detached from the regular series, and altogether lost sight of. The present index has been prepared by officers of this Department somewhat on the lines laid down by the Commissioners on the Public Eecords, but on a less ambitious and costly scale, one column being omitted and the description of th& premises being curtailed as much as possible.
