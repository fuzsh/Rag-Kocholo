The salaries indicated under the heading “Median Salary Public” reflect those salaries of the 50th percentile, among those graduates working in government jobs or judicial clerkships at the federal or state level.\n\nIn determining median salaries, jobs classified as “JD advantage” have been excluded (i.e., positions in which the employer requires a JD or considers it an advantage to hold such a degree, but in which admission to the bar is not required).\n\nThe rationale behind entitling this report as the “2020” report is that our 2020 Law School Rankings report and 2020 Law School Profiles are of considerable interest to prospective law school applicants who seek to enroll in classes commencing in fall 2020. At the time of our publication of this report in spring 2019, these employment statistics reflected the most current data available.\n\nSource: The data have been compiled from a variety of sources, including from data released publicly by the law schools."
