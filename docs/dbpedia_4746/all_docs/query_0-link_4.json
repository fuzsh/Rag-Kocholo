        "text": "The Arizona Summit Law School, known until 2013 as the Phoenix School of Law, is a for-profit, private law school located in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nFounded in 2005 and accredited by the American Bar Association in 2010, SummitLaw is the only private law school in Phoenix, Arizona, and asserts to have had a bar pass rate of 100 percent. However, according to the Supreme Court of Arizona Committee on Examination, the bar passage rate for first time test takers in the July 2014 Bar Exam was a mere 54.7%. Comparatively, the other two law schools in Arizona, Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, had first-time bar passage rates for the July 2014 Bar Exam of 88.4% and 88.6% respectively.\n\nThe school is not affiliated with the similarly named University of Phoenix.\n\nLocation"
