        "text": "Welcome with host Miss Arizona USA, Officer Candace Kanavel\n\nOrientation and Color Guard\n\nAwards Presentation: Innovative Program: Barbell Saves\n\nAwards Presentation: Public Safety Partnership: Peoria PD and HeartFit for Duty\n\nA Tempe Police Officer by day & beauty queen by night, Officer Candace Kanavel, crowned Miss Arizona USA in May, wears many hats — including a crown! Candace works on patrol, specializes as a Crisis Intervention Trained Officer, and plays a pivotal role as a Hostage Negotiator for the SWAT Team. Beyond her law enforcement duties, Candace is the driving force behind the initiative \"Yes She CAN,\" which is dedicated to instilling confidence and capability in women through essential skills like self-defense and situational awareness.

Her message is clear: you can be anything AND everything you want to be!\n\nLaw enforcement careers are often fraught with traumatic experiences, and while officers are trained to physically survive these events, they are rarely prepared for the ensuing mental battles. \"Life After the Pulse Night Club\" is a candid account of Agent Rivas' law enforcement career, detailing his struggles with trauma, the agency's varied responses to mental health, and the personal toll it took on him. Agent Rivas' story progresses from despair to healing, culminating in his collaboration with Trauma Behind the Badge to educate and support other officers facing similar challenges.\n\nOur life experiences, particularly traumatic events, shape our brain's structure and chemistry, altering our perceptions and reactions. First Responders, who often encounter individuals with compromised coping skills due to trauma, sometimes neglect their own trauma unless it's widely acknowledged. Trauma affects personality, communication, and memory, and understanding this is crucial for both community crisis intervention and personal well-being.\n\nAmanda Stamps, a retired Mesa Police officer with extensive experience in crisis intervention and peer support, has educated numerous officers on handling mental illness and crisis situations. With a rich educational background in psychology and counseling, and her role in developing CIT programs, Stamps actively promotes first responder wellness and trauma response.\n\n*Earn 1.25 CE Credit from NBCC\n\nThis presentation delves into the specific causes of suicide among firefighters, stressing the significance of managing factors within their control and advocating for organizational support for mental wellness. This talk aims to provide actionable strategies for mental health maintenance and suicide prevention, with relevance for all first responders.\n\nThe architect of this vital program is Captain Jon Scaife of Sedona Fire District. Drawing on personal experience and his professional role as the leader of the Peer Support Team, Captain Scaife has also pioneered a Mental Health Resiliency and Education Program, dedicated to equipping firefighters with the tools for mental health management from the start of their careers, in hopes of mitigating more severe issues later on.\n\nThis session aims to further equip clinicians with the skills to work effectively with first responders, covering the recognition of transference and countertransference, the use of consultations, and identifying when to refer clients to additional resources. Attendees will learn about fire service history, first responder schedules, addiction, sleep issues, suicide risk assessment, and compassion fatigue, concluding with effective therapeutic techniques for addressing trauma and family issues within this demographic.\n\nShoshana, a seasoned licensed clinical social worker with over 25 years of experience and founder of Sequoia Springs Trauma Healing Center, will share her expertise. With advanced degrees from the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, she specializes in treating trauma, addictions, and eating disorders and has been instrumental in developing multi-agency trauma programs to support individuals and families during times of conflict and transition.\n\n*Earn 1.25 CE Credit from NBCC\n\nThis interactive workshop is designed for individuals seeking to enhance, develop, or redesign programs and services that align with organizational objectives while fulfilling community needs.

Excessive worry and anxiety can be as harmful as the events feared, particularly due to the detrimental effects of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones, while essential for the body's \"fight or flight\" response, can cause muscle tissue degeneration, notably affecting the heart. This is significant considering the stark contrast between the number of deaths due to rare events like murders (16,000 in 2019 in the U.S.) and those resulting from heart disease (over 600,000 in the same year).\n\nDr. Peterson, an expert in Integrative Health and a faculty member at Grand Canyon University and United States University, leads a discussion on the abuse of the sympathetic nervous system response, hidden dangers in exercise and diet, and the impact of stress on health. His work in mindfulness training, instructional design, and health education accreditation brings a wealth of knowledge to understanding and addressing chronic stress and its long-term effects, highlighting the importance of proactive self-care.\n\nThe presentation focuses on the often-overlooked long-term effects on Crisis Intervention Responders. Despite developing effective tools and best practices, these professionals must continually refine and enhance their skills for sustained effectiveness in the field. This session will provide practical tips and strategies for crisis responders to not only maintain but also strengthen their abilities, ensuring longevity and resilience in their demanding roles.\n\nLeading the presentation are Enzo and Erika, experienced Crisis Intervention professionals from the Phoenix Police Department.

Understanding these impacts is crucial for first responders, who often are the first point of contact for survivors. They need to provide trauma-informed care to avoid secondary victimization.Samantha Mendez, Forensic Nurse Supervisor at HonorHealth, leverages her experience as a forensic nurse examiner to educate professionals on handling violence cases sensitively. Her work focuses on supporting victims, reducing health disparities, and enhancing access to care in underserved areas. With a background in trauma nursing and public health, Samantha is a key figure in improving the response to sexual and interpersonal violence.\n\nNavigating Trauma, Embracing Self-Care, and Transforming into a Wellness Warrior\n\nDrawing on her extensive experience as a former 9-1-1 dispatcher, Cassie openly shares her personal struggle with trauma and the journey towards healing. Her story is not just a narrative of recovery but also a source of empowerment for others, particularly first responders, helping them recognize PTSD symptoms in their own lives. Cassie's compelling account is an inspiration, motivating her audience to develop effective coping strategies and prioritize self-care, essential for sustaining healthy careers and personal relationships.\n\nWith a robust 14-year background in Law Enforcement, Cassie brings a deep understanding of the field as a member of the peer support team, a supervisor, and a trainer.

I left for a few years after high school and returned to the area. I started working at Cottonwood Police Department 7 years ago. When I first applied to work in dispatch I had no clue what I was getting into! I previously worked in the banking industry. Talk about a completely different world. When I first started at our center we were a 911 PSAP and dispatched for 1 police department and 5 fire/medical agencies. We have since expanded adding on 2 additional police departments. I never realized the impacts on my personal life or mental health when I first started. After several traumatic calls I started to dig into what I could do to help my own mental health and discovered so many resources.\"\n\nJess Howard is the Director of Contact Center Operations and Clinical Services at Solari.

He emphasizes the urgency of providing necessary support to those suffering in silence, advocating for proactive measures within departments to prepare for and handle such crises effectively.\n\nHaving served over 30 years as a first responder, Chris’s own journey with post-traumatic stress, including a personal encounter with suicide, deeply informs his advocacy and speaking engagements.
