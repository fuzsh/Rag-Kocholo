The arbitration will be conducted at a location determined by the arbitrator in Los Angeles County, California, and administered by and in accordance with the Rules of Practice and Procedure of ADR Services, Inc. In any arbitration proceeding, the parties shall be limited to three (3) depositions each, absent a showing of a good cause and subsequent order by arbitrator. Prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs, expenses, including expert fees, and reasonable attorney fees. In rendering the award, the arbitrator shall determine the rights and obligations of the parties according to the substantive and procedural laws of California.

Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nIn no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to the Site and/or the Services (including your visit to or use of the Site and/or the Services) be instituted more than three (3) years after the cause of action arose.\n\nYou and the Company agree that any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute, whether in arbitration, in court, or otherwise, will be conducted solely on an individual basis, and that neither you nor the Company will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, a representative action, a collective action, a private attorney-general action, or in any proceeding in which you or the Company acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity, you and the Company further agree that no arbitration or proceeding will be joined, consolidated, or combined with another arbitration or proceeding without the prior written consent of you, the Company, and all parties to any such arbitration or proceeding. If the class action waiver (which includes a waiver of private attorney-general actions immediately preceding this paragraph) is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, whether by judicial, legislative, or other action, then such provision will not apply to those parts. You and the Company irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in Los Angeles County, California, USA, for all proceedings in court under this paragraph.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe editorial staff's screening process at the Company is designed to collect the best possible law school outlines. However, these outlines are submitted by students and may contain inaccurate information. As described above, we make no warranties as to the accuracy of the information they contain. Use these outlines at your own risk and do not rely on them for legal advice.\n\nUse these outlines to enhance your studies, not as a substitute for assigned work or academic requirements. Some law schools have a policy that permits law students to take their own outlines into final exams. If your law school has such a policy you are prohibited from representing any of the outlines contained in this database as your own. If you are not sure of your law school's policy, you should contact the appropriate administrative staff at your school.\n\nIntegrated Document\n\nThese Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the use of the Site and/or the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and the Company relating to your use of the Site and/or the Services. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision in that or any other instance. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable, such provision will be limited or deleted to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining terms remain in full force and effect.\n\nThe section headings in these Terms of Use are included for convenience only and are not a part of this Agreement."
