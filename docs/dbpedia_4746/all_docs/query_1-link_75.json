        "text": "LSAT test-takers at schools like Arizona Summit Law School often spend as much as a year studying, while other future law students try to take the exam with little or no preparation! An average test-taker starts studying about three months before the exam. And though many LSAT prep books are a common study method, many competitive test-takers take live prep courses.\n\nWith Kaplan, you'll have exhaustive resources available to you, including 70+ released LSAT exams and unlimited access to our industry exclusive - The LSAT® Channel - providing you hundreds of hours of live or On Demand instruction by Kaplan's best teacher on every LSAT topic and difficulty level.\n\nCheck out the recommended classes below that are starting soon if you're ready to start raising your score. If you can't find a local In Person option in Surprise, know there are many live classes that are available online."
