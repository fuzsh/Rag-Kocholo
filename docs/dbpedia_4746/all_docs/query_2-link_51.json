        "text": "Yale is a bargain. According to a new list of law school costs released by a six-year-old non-profit group called Law School Transparency, Yale ranks in 48th place among 199 schools, behind such lesser-known institutions as Arizona Summit Law School and John Marshall Law School in Chicago. Assuming that students borrow to pay for their education and receive the median financial aid, the cost to get a Yale J.D. is $204,255, according to LST. By contrast Columbia, the most expensive school in the country, costs $263,694 while Harvard, No. 7 on the list, costs $245,019. The slide show above shows the 10 most expensive schools. Go to LST’s site for the complete list (Note: I’ve excluded SUNY Buffalo from my slide show because I’m assuming most students are in-staters).\n\nIn a tough job market for lawyers, where in 2013 fewer than two thirds of new law graduates found work that required them to pass the bar exam, aspiring attorneys need to be careful about where they get their degrees. “There really are only two things people ought to consider when deciding where to go to law school,” says Paul Campos, a professor at the University of Colorado’s law school who tracks law school costs. “One is the cost and the other is job outcomes.”\n\nLST provides both statistics. For most students, Columbia is well worth its high cost, given how many of its grads land good jobs. Ninety-five percent of 2013 grads were in long-term jobs requiring a law degree nine months after graduation, and a full 97.3% had full-time jobs. Most of the schools in the top 10, like Harvard, University of Chicago, Cornell and NYU have similarly strong employment stats.\n\nBut many grads of the two schools in the top 10 that don’t have marquee names, Arizona Summit and John Marshall, are struggling. At Arizona Summit, which is owned by a private, for-profit company called InfiLaw that is a subsidiary of Chicago-based private equity firm Sterling Partners, only 45% of 2013 graduates had found full-time jobs requiring a J.D. within nine months of graduation, according to American Bar Association figures. An Arizona Summit spokesperson counters that 77% of the class of 2013 had found some kind of full-time work nine months after graduation, and that three years post-graduation, alumni made an average of $58,800. But that’s not an encouraging number given that the cost for Arizona Summit is $247,000, according to LST’s figures. At John Marshall Law School, No. 8 on LST’s list, a J.D. costs $238,976. But only a little more than half of 2013 grads, 51.8%, had found full-time legal jobs nine months after graduation. (A spokeswoman for John Marshall says, “We have a strong commitment to our students and their success. Our job placement numbers continue to improve, as does the outlook for the overall job market.”)\n\nThe LST list may stir some controversy because it comes to its cost numbers using a unique methodology. Instead of ranking schools according to their stated full-freight cost, Kyle McEntee, LST’s executive director, made an effort to come up with the real cost to students. Some 83% of law students go into debt in order to finance their legal education, he says, and 43% pay full tuition. As they move through school, tuition and the cost of living inevitably climb and interest accumulates. LST’s projected cost figures factor all of that in.\n\nMcEntee, a graduate of Vanderbilt law school, started Washington, DC-based LST together with fellow Vanderbilt alum Patrick Lynch while they were still in school, because they were concerned that prospective law students couldn’t get enough data about how graduates fared in the job market. McEntee runs LST with a staff of more than 50 volunteers, and he’s scrupulous about numbers. The ABA requires all schools to report the employment outcomes of their graduates and schools are increasingly making those numbers available on their websites.

For instance fewer and fewer home buyers use lawyers to close deals. Title companies have taken on that task. More than 85% of divorces are now uncontested and involve minimal or no work by lawyers, says Campos, as companies like LegalZoom and Nolo provide do-it-yourself forms. Vast amounts of legal research has been automated, given that computers can perform discovery tasks like searching for terms in documents pertaining to a product dispute, a task that used to be painstakingly performed by humans with legal training. “It’s a classic supply and demand scenario,” says Campos. Even for lawyers at elite firms, compensation has come down. The $160,000 starting salary for associates at most top firms hasn’t budged since 2007. Given inflation, that amounts to a pay cut of more than $15,000."
