        "text": "Last Known Arizona Summit Law School Ranking\n\nBefore its accreditation loss and closure, Arizona Summit Law School ranked among the nation’s Law schools. The institution ranked 27th in its prime. However, this ranking plummeted after the school lost its ABA accreditation in 2018. This particular loss of accreditation additionally impacted the school’s eligibility for participation in regular law school ranking bodies and considerably harmed its track record and standing within the legal education world.\n\nThe 27th place Arizona Summit Law School at one time reflected its early promise and standing among law schools. Nevertheless, the ensuing loss of ABA accreditation had long-lasting consequences, leading to the school being dropped from ranking lists and eventually shut down. The accreditation loss altered the institution’s trajectory and permanently altered its position in the legal education landscape.\n\nPhoenix Law School Reputation\n\nPhoenix Law School (formerly Arizona Summit Law School) endured many challenges which caused it to be stripped of its ABA accreditation and closed down. Even with its convenient location and access, accreditation issues, low bar admission rates, and bad work placement figures cast doubt on the quality of education it provided. These eroded confidence in the legal community and exacerbated the school’s failing reputation over time.\n\nConforming with ABA requirements is crucial for law schools to educate their graduates to practice law nationwide. The ABA sets these standards to guarantee good quality and consistency in legal education so that students have the abilities and expertise to pass the national bar examination and pursue legal careers without geographical limitations. In case they fall short of those standards, law schools risk rendering their graduates ineligible to practice law in certain states – possibly squandering their investments in legal education. Hence, the loss of ABA accreditation is a reminder that these standards must be upheld to safeguard law school graduates’ future.\n\nArizona Summit Law School Numbers\n\nArizona Summit Law School’s numbers reflect its performance in its operating years. Such figures, including bar passage rates and work placement numbers, are ABA standards that indicate the quality of a law school. However, these areas of Arizona Summit Law School struggled, with lower bar passage rates and questionable job placement rates, probably contributing to its loss of ABA accreditation. These figures illustrate how much accreditation standards impact a law school’s reputation and viability within legal education.\n\nArizona Summit Law School LSAT Median 148 (Fall 2017) Phoenix Law School Median GPA 2.81 (Fall 2017) Arizona Summit Acceptance Rate 46.2% AZ Summit Law School Ranking No. 27th (Last Known) Arizona Summit Law School Bar Pass Rate 43.5% as of 2018 AZ Summit Employment Outcomes 37.3% of 2018 Graduates\n\nThese figures suggest that Arizona Summit Law School failed to meet ABA standards for the conduct of law schools. The school needed a median LSAT of 148 and a median GPA of 2.81 and struggled to get higher applicants. Its high acceptance rate of 46.2% and low bar pass rate of 43.5% as of 2018 additionally indicated its issues in preserving academic excellence and educating students for the legal field.\n\nFurthermore, the employment rate for 2018 graduates is 37.3%, demonstrating the school has difficulty offering students meaningful career pathways. These low and unfavorable numbers, not meeting ABA standards, eventually resulted in Arizona Summit Law School closing and its demise as a legal education institution.\n\nTuition and Financial Aid at Phoenix Law School\n\nA recent Phoenix Law School review on Quora noted that tuition was USD 64,856. This cost appeared high for students who might not necessarily be practicing law yet, the reviewer said. The review also stated that even if you do not intend to go into Law, the tuition at Phoenix Law School is pricey.\n\nNevertheless, financial assistance is available to law school students at other institutions.
