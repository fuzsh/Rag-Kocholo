        "text": "TEMPE, Ariz., Oct. 17, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- The No. 1 bar exam passage rate among Arizona law schools once again belongs to ASU's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law.\n\nResults of the July Arizona bar exam show ASU Law graduates with an 89.1 percent passage rate. The state's overall bar exam passage rate was 74.6 percent.\n\n\"The results confirm what we have known for years, our students are the best and the brightest and we couldn't be more proud,\" College of Law Dean Doug Sylvester said.\n\nArizona's two other law schools, the James E. Rogers College of Law at the University of Arizona and Arizona Summit Law School, posted bar passage rates of 88.6 percent and 54.4 percent, respectively.\n\nOn Oct. 31, ASU Law will host a swearing-in ceremony for alumni being admitted to the State Bar. Arizona Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Berch will administer the oath.\n\nIn an economy in which law school graduates are having a difficult time getting real lawyer jobs, ASU Law is recording success in postgraduate job placements.\n\nAccording to data collected by the American Bar Association in the spring of 2014, ASU Law was No. 19 in the nation for job placement in real lawyer jobs for its 2013 graduates.
