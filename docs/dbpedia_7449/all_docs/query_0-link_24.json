The company welcomes Kirsteene Phelan, former Australian PR and Communications Manager for online craft and design marketplace Etsy.com as Director of Communications, based in their global headquarters in Melbourne.\n\nRome2rio is a multi-modal travel search site founded by Michael Cameron and Bernhard Tschirren in 2010 that attracts 8 million global visitors each month, mainly from Europe.

We are essentially a complex, data-driven technology company operating in global consumer travel market. We have done a good job using SEO to become the market leader however we are now looking to tell our company stories in new and compelling ways. Kirsteene’s experience and understanding of our company and our objectives make her a perfect fit.”\n\nKirsteene Phelan says, ”I’m thrilled to be joining the Rome2rio team and to be combining my twin interests of storytelling and travel. Rome2rio has access to a deep repository of interesting data, ready to be crafted into compelling content and I’m looking forward to collaborating with such a talented team.”\n\nKirsteene, who was Etsy.com’s 1st hire in the southern hemisphere, spent 4 years with the company working on traditional and influencer media relations, grassroots marketing, and partnerships. Kirsteene has also taught business media relations and marketing skills for numerous clients including the Victorian State Government and RMIT University."
