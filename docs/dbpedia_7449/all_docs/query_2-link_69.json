You’ll often see elderly women sitting on the streets begging which pulls at your heart strings. Georgia is so concerned by men looking at women that they are introducing a fine for it. Don’t let this put you off Georgia solo travel, as I travelled through the country and felt completely comfortable.\n\nIf you are travelling off the beaten path when visiting places in Georgia, you do need some Georgian or Russian phrases to get by. Tour companies and hotels and hostels tend to speak English making it easier to travel around solo. Do be careful with your belongings in hostels in Tbilisi and make sure that your valuables are always locked away in case of thieves.\n\nIf you want to feel more comfortable base yourself in Tbilsi, Kutaisi and Batumi and do day trips from Tbilisi or the other cities instead of navigating the lesser-known towns and villages by yourself.\n\nThere are also areas of Georgia that are controversial. Not dissimilar to Transnistria in Moldova, the breakaway region of Abkhazia declared independence in 1999. This area on the eastern coast of the Black Sea is under conflict with Georgia and Russia and it’s not advised to travel there. South Ossetia is another disputed region which is recognised by Russia as an independent state but not by Georgia.\n\nOverall, Is it safe to travel to Georgia alone? Yes and independent travel in Georgia is relatively easy but if you are unsure of places to go in Georgia and what to do in Georgia solo, you may feel more comfortable on one of the group Georgia tours.\n\nPlaces To Visit in Georgia\n\nGeorgia is such an understated country. Its location is debatable with many believing it is situated in Asia and not Europe. Because the Caucasus Mountains form the border between Europe and Asia it is easy to see the confusion. This adds to Georgia’s uniqueness which offers a blend of the East and West.\n\nAs an emerging destination Georgia seems to be growing in popularity. Its draw is not only its wine and cuisine but also its history and nature. As a budget destination it’s easy to travel and stay in comfortable accommodation for a fraction of the price.\n\nThe country is steeped in nature and more than 75% of Georgia is mountains. Shkhara is Georgia’s highest peak. There are so many places to visit here, from the Black sea coastal resort of Batumi to the winelands of Kakheti. The country is definitely one for the intrepid explorer.\n\n* Before you travel, check what paperwork or visas are required for Georgia.\n\nTbilisi\n\nWhen you visit Georgia solo, Tbilisi will probably be your first port of call. The capital was founded in the 5th century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali, and a statue of him on a horse sits above the river, opposite the hot springs which inspired him to built a city here. The city is a blend of old and new with futuristic-looking structures weaved within its landscape.\n\nTbilisi is the best place to visit in Georgia for health and wellness. The city is known for its sulphur baths with their healing mineral qualities. The Abanotubani district is where you’ll find all of the egg-smelling baths ranging from budget to the more luxurious spa experience.\n\nYour Tbilisi itinerary should definitely include a walking tour to get your bearings in the city then spend some time exploring the Tbilisi historic district. If you are there on the hour, watch the clock tower which was created by a famous local puppeteer. Every hour a puppet show acts out the circle of life to onlookers; amusement\n\nOpposite the river is the city’s cable car which takes you up to the giant statue of Mother Georgia which looks over the city. The walk back down takes you past the castle and the zip line (great for the adventurous GatG). * Read: Things To Do in Tbilisi\n\nThe Peace Bridge is the newest bridge in the city and was opened in 2010. Its wavy design joins both sides of the river and connects with Rike Park, a nature spot to relax and watch the world go by. The Narikala Fortress is another great spot to enjoy some nature. You can take the trail along this 4th century ancient fortress which runs near the Mother Georgia statue down (a tourist attraction in Georgia) to the old town. Or take a stroll around Turtle Lake instead.\n\nIf you only see one church here make it the Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi. This magnificent church is the third largest Orthodox Cathedral in the world, and the tallest church in Tbilisi. It symbolises “New Georgia” and has a golden dome which you can see from nearly everywhere in the city. It is a bit of a climb to get there but the walk is definitely worth it. For the best view of the city head to Mtatsminda Park.\n\nFrom Tbisili you can take day trips to Borjomi, a quaint little village and the source of the country’s most healing mineral water. The garden area surrounding the springs are so calming. Take your own bottle to try both the warm and cold mineral water straight from the ground.\n\nDavid Gareja Monastery\n\nDavid Gareja cave monastery complex (also known as ‘Davit Gareja') is close to the border with Azerbaijan (which you can see from the complex). The monastery was founded by a monk in the 6th century which has since been expanded to include hundreds of cells and churches all within the rock face. Within the semi-desert landscape you can wander around the 13 monasteries and monks living quarters all carved out of rock. David Gareja Monastery is one of the Georgia tourist attractions and is reachable via Udabno, the nearest village. The climb to get here can be steep.\n\nVardzia\n\nWhen you explore Georgia, another impressive complex of rock architecture is Vardzia. This cave city site isn’t as old as David Gareja but it is just as majestic and one of the most beautiful places in Georgia. Vardzia dates back to the 12th century and sits on the bank of the Mtkvari River. Construction of the underground cave fortress was ordered by Queen Tamar and it is thought that there were once 13 levels.\n\nYou can spend hours exploring the cave system and the little chapels. You can see everything including an old pharmacy and even an old wine cellar as you imagine what life was like back then. Inside the church is one of the only 12 paintings of Queen Tamara.\n\nRabati Castle in Akhaltsikhe is another complex to see. Originally built by Turks, the castle was invaded and taken back by Georgia with the help of the Russians. Inside the castle grounds are an influence of different cultures and architecture. You’ll find a mosque, synagogue and a church within the 13th century complex.\n\nKutaisi\n\nKutaisi is in the west of Georgia and is the country’s legislative capital. Is Kutaisi worth visiting? Yes! It is home to three picturesque monasteries and is less developed than Tbilisi. It’s actually one of the world’s oldest inhabited cities and is Georgia’s third largest city.\n\nIt’s a great base from which to see Prometheus Cave, one of the countrys' natural wonders and a must see in Georgia. It is the biggest cave in Georgia and you can take a boat trip to explore its underground rivers and lakes. It’s only 20km away from Kutaisi and although it is one of the most touristy spots the fact that it is 60-70 million year old makes it worth seeing.\n\nIf you are a nature GatG then Okatse Canyon and Kinchkha Waterfall are some of natures’ best. The falls are nearly 70 metres high and there is a pathway which you can take around the canyon. If you have time add Lomina Lake to your itinerary. It’s a bit of a walk but well worth it.\n\nBoth the Bagrati Monastery and Gelati Monastery are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The Bagrati Monastery is the green domed 11th century monastery which can be seen on a hillside from anywhere in Kutaisi. It is one of things to do in Georgia for free and is walkable from the city with great views of a giant cross and the river below. Afterwards, stop in the nearby botanical gardens.\n\nThe Gelati Monastery is a bit further out and reachable by bus or taxi. This medieval monastic complex was founded in the early 12th century and is a complex consisting of three churches. It is free to go inside and see the mosaics and frescoes. Is Kutaisi safe? Yes and it is easily walkable so stroll around the city, stopping at the State History Museum as you go.\n\nAs one of the oldest wine regions in the world Georgia produces great quality wine which has an amazing taste. Most of the wine in Georgia comes from the grapes grown in Kakheti. Each village has their own type of Georgia wine named after the places they were produced. Enjoy wine tasting at one of the wineries, one of which has more than 50,000 bottles – a wine GatG’s dream and one of the fun things to do in Georgia.\n\nBatumi\n\nIf you are ready for some Black Sea action, Batumi is where it is at. This coastal resort attracts the partygoers during the summer months so it is touristy but it can be a refreshing change from the rest of Georgia. It does have more than casinos and clubs to entertain you. Just walking around this city will show you random things on each corner from peacocks to dancing fountains.\n\nSpend an evening at the top of the Alphabet Tower, one of the tourist attractions in Georgia and a 135 metre structure which looks like a DNA molecule. For another view take the ‘Argo” cable car for a gorgeous panorama of the sea and the mountains. It’s a striking city to walk around with an astronomical clock, a summer theatre (in an Asian style), and the Sea Station – one of the architectural symbols of the Old Batumi.\n\nThere are a mix of religious buildings such as a mosque, synagogue and Armenian church. They even have a replica of Bologna’s fountain in Italy called Fountain “Neptune.” * Read: Things To Do in Batumi\n\nWalk along the promenade at dusk where you can stop in the restaurants for some Georgian cuisine with a sea view. Or watch the old men fishing or playing chess. There are so many quirky statues here, many of which depict love.\n\n‘My First Love' is a cute architectural piece but the best and most photographs has to be Ali & Nino – an 8-metre moving sculpture symbolising eternal love and understanding amongst nationalities. Yes it’s tacky but Batumi is so much fun. From here you can do day trips to the Gonio-Apsaros Fortress and the Petra Fortress, as well as national parks.\n\nIf love is still on your mind, then you should definitely pay a trip to Sighnaghi, the city of love. It’s one of the prettiest towns and has lovely views over the Alazani valley.\n\nIf you are a winter sports GatG don some skis and head to one of the ski villages which make up more than 80 kms of slopes. Gudauri is the largest ski resort and sits at 1283 metres. Other popular resorts are Bakuriani, and Mestia. Skiing here is open from December until April and is said to be cheaper than the Alps.\n\nOther Places To See in Georgia\n\nSvaneti is a region in the northwest of Georgia. It is known for its watchtowers and attracts hikers and climbers. If you like history and culture and want to learn more about the Svan people and their traditions it’s worth taking the marshrutka from Kutaisi to this region. A popular route to hike is from here to Mestia and Ushguli (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), staying in local guesthouses on the way.\n\nOther best places in Georgia are Mtskheta – the religious capital with three of the country’s most important churches. Chiatura – an old-mining town, and Uplistsikhe – an abandoned rock town which was once an inhabited cave city up until the 13th century. If you love hammocks head to Hauschi which is famous for them. Apparently when the factory closed down the locals started making their own.\n\nWhether you like to ski, explore cave cities or just drink wine, solo travel Georgia before the secret gets out…\n\nWhere To Stay in Georgia\n\nIf you stay in the capital there really are plenty of hostels to choose from. The standard of hostels here are great with some even offering female-only dorms. In Kutaisi guesthouses are more the norm but with the country being so economical you can easily afford to book a private room with a bathroom. Some guesthouses include their own Georgian breakfast.\n\nPlus there’s Airbnb which connects you to unique travel experiences and isn’t just limited to staying in a local’s spare room. All of the budget Georgia accommodation below have been recommended by solo female travellers from our Girls about the Globe community and come with our Solo Female Friendly endorsement.\n\nFor all other Georgia accommodation, check rates and availability for all accommodation in Georgia here\n\nBatumi – Boutique Hotel Medusa – $\n\nNowhere is Batumi is far but this hotel which feels more like a boutique hostel is walkable to nearly everywhere in Batumi. The well-equipped stylish kitchens are ideal if you prefer to cook your own meals, and there are huge sofas to relax on. You can even wash your own clothes and hang them on the clothes horse outside.\n\nThe rooms are clean and they have a female-only dorm room (which is pink). There is a 24 hour front desk and they provide a free breakfast to set you up for the day. Choose from a double room with a sea view or a bed in a 6-bed dorm room. * Check rates and availability for Boutique Hotel Medusa\n\nBatumi – Orbi City Sea View – $$\n\nThis 4-star accommodation is just across from the beach. The apartments are clean and modern with a view of the city or the sea. There’s everything you need onsite such as a restaurant and a bar, a gym, pool and even a sauna.

There is complimentary tea, coffee, wine and even brandy! They provide an airport transfer which is ideal with many flights arriving in the early hours of the mornings. * Check rates and availability for Kiev Kutaisi Hotel\n\nTbilisi – Hostel “Your Home” – $\n\nI love this hostel. It’s called Hostel “Your Home” because it literally feels like a home away from home. The manager is so friendly and helpful and will help you with tours or transfers. There is a communal lounge where you can hang out and watch TV with the other guests on the comfy sofas. They often share meals too.\n\nThe hostel is near a metro station meaning that it’s easy to get around the city and is close to many restaurants with different types of cuisine. The female-only dorm is really spacious with a large drawer under the beds to lock away all of your things. They provide towels for an extra charge and have a female-only bathroom too. * Check rates and availability for Hostel “Your Home”\n\nTbilisi – Fabrika – $\n\nThis hostel is seriously huge. Located inside an old sewing factory that was used during the Soviet times, the hostel has several cafes and bars inside, a courtyard, and even a coworking space. It resembles more of a mini village than a hostel which is perfect for those days when you don't want to leave the hostel. It’s easy to meet people in the bar area and a bar crawl runs from here too.\n\nThe beds are comfortable and come with a light and your own power socket. You’ll find hairdryers in the bathrooms too. Do take your earplugs though if you decide to stay on a weekend. Choose from a bed in a 3, 4, 6 or 10-bed mixed dormitory room, or a 6-bed female-only dorm.

Most tours have an average of 10 people and there is no upper age limit. Once you book your trip you pay extra for any excursions you want to do when you’re there.\n\nThey offer an 8 day adventure combining Georgia with Armenia. The tour starts at Yerevan and ends in Tbilisi. I have personally used G Adventures and recommend them as a solo female friendly company. * Check rates and availability for G Adventures tours\n\nIntrepid Travel Georgia\n\nIntrepid Travel is similar to G Adventures with an average of 12 people on each small group tour. Over half the people who book their trips are solo travellers. They tend to use hotels instead of hostels and have a more comfortable style of accommodation hence the trips can appear a bit more than G Adventures. Their tours range from 10 days to an epic 80 days and also include Azerbaijan on your Georgian itinerary.

I took this Georgia local tour as a solo and had the best time. You also get to learn about Georgian wines with the tour guide, and try khachapuri (their flatbread with cheese). It’s a great evening tour.\n\nWorld Sightseeing Tour – This company offers everything you can possibly do in Georgia. From city sightseeing bus tours to boat trips at night, they offer all kinds of Georgia guided tours. I took several day trips from Tbilisi with them to Vardzia, Rabati and Borjomi which was easier than organising it independently. Their Georgia sightseeing tours are really cheap and depart frequently but if you travel low season you may need to pre-book as a minimum amount of people are needed.\n\nGet Your Guide – Get Your Guide helps you to find top-rated activities and one day tours in Georgia. Choose from a Kazbegi Mountains cultural tour, a Vardzia cave tour with a guide, or a full-day wine tour in the Kakheti wine region.

Just check the reviews, price and availability then book online. * Check rates and availability for all day tours\n\nHow to Travel in Georgia\n\nIf you choose to travel around Georgia by train, the trains are a mix of modern and old Soviet-style trains. Travel from Kutaisi to Tbilisi and expect to pay just £4 for the 5.5 hour journey. Railway.ge are the best website to check for train schedules and book online tickets. You can then show your barcode to the guard as you board. Reservations may be required for all trains so pre-book.\n\nSome of the roads are in poor condition so be prepared if you do decide to hire a car, and fill your petrol tank up in the cities if you can. Vanilla Sky flies from Mestia to Tbilisi and Kutaisi. They use small planes and sometimes cancel so plan for any cancellations.\n\nThe public transport in the capital city is good as Tbilisi has a good metro system. The trains are really deep underground so expect to be be on an escalator for a while. They also have a bus system where you pay onboard. For a more authentic experience take a mashrutka – a yellow minibus which runs around the city. You may need to write down your destination and ask when to get off.\n\nKutaisi is walkable but instead of taking buses to places outside of the city you may prefer to take a tour instead.\n\nGeorgia Itinerary\n\nThere are so many places in Georgia that one week in Georgia just isn’t enough. Don’t limit yourself to a one week Georgia itinerary. To get from place to place can take a few hours so plan your itinerary wisely to see all the must sees in Georgia and save time.\n\nYou can base yourself in Kutaisi to take a day trip to see canyons, and Vardzia. Or choose to stay longer in Tbilisi instead and base yourself there to also see Vardzia, David Gareja, and Sighnaghi.
