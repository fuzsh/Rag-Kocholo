        "text": "Ten years ago, today, I incorporated the company from my sister-in-law's New York City apartment. Congratulations Rome2rio, you're ten years old. Cheers.\n\nMy wife, Michelle, and I had just finished spending a year traveling through Europe and Asia. I had become increasingly passionate with a vision for building a travel search system that was about more than just flights. The next week we flew back to Seattle, which had been our home for the prior three years. Most of our worldly possessions were stored in a container in Bellevue.\n\nWe met up with some dear friends - our Seattle Aussies network - and shared our plans to return to Australia and the ideas behind Rome2rio. One of our friends, Bernie Tschirren, was passionate about the same problem with travel planning - surely there should be a product that lets you search all modes of transport, including trains, buses and ferries. A product that would help you discover how to get to actual destinations, not just to big cities and airports. Bernie wanted a travel search engine that would show users how to get to destinations such as Machu Picchu. He was ready to leave the US and excited about the idea of living in Melbourne, a new home given he had grown up in Perth. Suddenly Rome2rio had transformed from a nice little side project idea to a proper start-up with two committed co-founders.\n\nWe spent the early years developing Rome2rio out of my parents' living room in Albert Park, Bernie's apartment in Southbank, and at coworking events such as Melbourne Jelly. We launched the site in April 2011 with a trip to San Francisco. We spent four weeks of solid networking, met a variety of experienced founders, learned a lot, and managed to pull off some tech blog coverage for the launch.\n\nOver the next couple of years the business continued to grow. We raised capital from investors, won some government grants, set up office in the Inspire9 co-working space, and hired our first team members. The product starting gaining traction as we refined our approach to SEO and grew our monthly user base into the millions. The team bonded over a passion for what we were building, gatherings such as our company retreats, and a love of working together.\n\nBy 2017 the Rome2rio team had grown to a full-time headcount of around 40. We had a strong developer team of around 20, some talented in-house data science capabilities, and the team was rounded out with a variety of specialist roles such as finance, operations and customer service. We also had a team of around 30 - 40 freelancers around the globe who collect hard-to-find transport information and input it into our system; a critical part of the Rome2rio magic that allows us to offer complete itineraries in far-flung places.\n\nWe had also moved into our own office in Richmond, right next door to the co-working space we had called home for so many years.\n\nLast year we sold Rome2rio to Omio, a major Berlin-based Venture Capital backed travel company that also shares a vision for making multi-modal travel easier to plan and book.\n\nBernie and I had accomplished what we set out to do, and it was a success beyond our wildest dreams. We had built the fast, accurate, comprehensive and polished search product that we had craved for during our own travels. We had created a team and culture in Melbourne that rivaled our experiences in the US.\n\nThe Omio team have proven to be some of the sharpest operators in the travel space, and have delivered on their promise to continue to invest in the Rome2rio team and brand. It has been a challenging year, especially for the travel industry, yet Omio and Rome2rio have weathered the storm reasonably well and are in a good position to bounce back when borders reopen. Rome2rio's business model has proven more resilient than other travel sectors, and Omio recently closed a $100 million capital raise that has secured both company's futures.\n\nHappy birthday, Rome2rio. Here's to another ten good years."
