        "text": "So you’re thinking about backpacking through Europe? Great! But the big question that’s on everyone’s mind is “how much does it cost to travel through Europe?”\n\nWhen I first backpacked in Europe I had very little idea how much it would all cost. I figured I would go back through all my notes and records to help give you a ballpark idea of how much you should budget to backpack Europe.\n\nQuick Look At Travel Costs To Backpack Europe\n\nThe main day-to-day costs associated with backpacking Europe include accommodation, food, sightseeing, public transportation, and a few extra incidental costs.\n\nMost frugal-minded, hostel-hopping backpackers spend around $75-$125/day in Western Europe and $40-$90/day in Eastern Europe. At this level, you can travel fairly modestly and comfortably without making too many sacrifices but you’re not going to be living it up.\n\nIf you watch your budget closely and make a conscious effort to keep your costs down, it’s possible to drop your expenses by around 25%. Lowering your costs from this point starts to become difficult, so you’ll have to get creative.\n\nAccommodation Expenses For Backpacking Europe\n\nThere is a wide range of lodging options in Europe — from super cheap to super expensive. But since we’re budget travelers, I’m going to stick with the cheaper options.\n\nHow Much Do Hostels Cost in Europe?\n\nHostels in Europe are traditionally the cheapest option when it comes to accommodation. Below are typical hostel prices for a night in a hostel dorm room for a few popular destinations.\n\nNote: These prices are for the cheapest option at decently rated hostels. You might be able to find a slightly cheaper place if you choose the bottom-of-the-barrel option. You can also spend (considerably) more if you want a private room.\n\nHere is a sample list of average hostel prices via Hostelworld (our favorite booking site):\n\nLondon: $35-$85\n\nParis: $35-$70\n\nDublin: $35-$70\n\nAmsterdam: $35-$65\n\nMunich: $30-$55\n\nBerlin: $23-$45\n\nKrakow: $15-$30\n\nBudapest: $18-$40\n\nBarcelona: $30-$45\n\nCheck out our hostel price guides for a more in-depth look at hostel prices:\n\nHow Much Do Rental Apartments Cost in Europe?\n\nI’m a big fan of rental apartments and they can be an affordable option in many cities—especially for groups. Rental apartments are often priced similarly to cheap hotels but you get nice bonuses like more space, kitchens, and a feeling like you’re local.\n\nOf course, there are some downsides like check-in/check-out logistics, extra fees, cleaning issues, maintenance issues, etc.\n\nHere is our guide to short-term rentals in Europe if you want to learn more.\n\nHow Much Are Cheap Hotels in Europe?\n\nThere are plenty of cheap (and crappy) hotels all throughout Europe — just don’t expect much at the budget traveler’s price range. However, the price of a cheap hotel can sometimes be lower than a hostel if it is shared by two or more people.\n\nWe’ve found that Booking.com has the best price and selection.\n\nIs Couchsurfing in Europe Free?\n\nCouchsurfing is a popular and free way to travel throughout Europe. You can read all about how Couchsurfing works here, but don’t expect to rely on it for all your accommodation needs because it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find hosts.\n\nHow Much Does Food Cost in Europe?\n\nFor the budget traveler, your daily food budget will be anywhere from $20-$60.\n\nAt the lower end of this price range, you’ll mostly be eating the free hostel breakfast and homemade meals/picnics from the grocery store. If you’re on a super tight budget, you can lower your food costs down to $10/day but you’ll have to get creative.\n\nAt the middle to high range, you can eat at cheap takeaway restaurants ($8-$12 for a meal), affordable sit-down restaurants ($15-$25 for a meal), and maybe have a few snacks throughout the day.\n\nWe suggest budgeting a little high for food because even the most diehard budget travelers will break down and buy a prepared meal sometimes. When you’re not familiar with the city, it can be challenging to find a grocery store and it’s even worse when you’re already hungry. Additionally, making a meal after a long day of sightseeing can sometimes be a pain in the ass, so it will often be challenging to motivate yourself to cook something.\n\nWe also encourage everyone to set aside some cash for trying the local cuisine. Given that food is such a large part of experiencing a country’s culture, it would be a shame to miss this experience.\n\nFood and drinks can kill any budget — especially for us penny pinchers. Here are some tips for eating and drinking on a budget in Europe.\n\nHow Much Are Sightseeing and Attraction Prices in Europe?\n\nWe suggest budgeting about $15-$35/day for sightseeing costs in Europe.\n\nYou go to Europe to experience the culture and to see the sights. Well, get out your wallet because most attractions charge an admission fee. The fees are usually not outrageous, but they do add up. Many places offer student/youth discounts, so be sure to inquire about those.\n\nWhile you may not do something that requires an admission fee every day, we suggest budgeting $15-$20. Below is a list of admissions prices at some popular attractions in Europe so you can get a feel for how much things cost:\n\nLouvre Museum (Paris): $18\n\nCentre Pompidou Museum (Paris): $18\n\nTower of London: $37\n\nVan Gogh Museum (Amsterdam): $20\n\nWalking Tours: Free (guides work on tips) or $25+ for paid tours\n\nNote: Many museums offer discounted or free tickets to students and/or people under 26.\n\nMany cities also have sightseeing passes which can be a good deal for some travelers. I’ve reviewed a few of the most popular here:\n\nLondon Pass Review\n\nParis Pass Review\n\nGo Berlin City Pass Review\n\nRome & Vatican Pass Review\n\nGo Rome Pass Review\n\nVienna Pass Review\n\nDublin Pass Review\n\nStockholm Pass Review\n\nGo Barcelona City Pass Review\n\nNew York City Pass Review\n\nGo Madrid City Pass Review\n\nHow Much Does Public Transportation Cost in Europe?\n\nBetween subways, buses, and trams, European public transportation is excellent in nearly every large and medium-sized city. Furthermore, it’s usually affordable. Most cities are walkable but in some cases, public transport might be a better use of your time and energy.\n\nMost cities sell a range of tickets and travel passes (i.e. single tickets, 1/3/5/7 day passes, monthly passes, etc.) so it’s smart to do a little research to find the option that works best for you. Below are some examples of transportation costs:\n\nLondon Tube (w/Oyster Card): $3.50/off-peak single fare or $14/all-day\n\nParis Métro: $17 for 10 single tickets\n\nAmsterdam (tram): $23 for 72 hours of unlimited travel\n\nBudapest (bus and subway): $17 for 72 hours of unlimited travel\n\nPrague: $1.60 for a single tram ticket\n\nBarcelona (metro): $1.40 for a single ticket on the metro\n\nHow Much Does Alcohol Cost in Europe?\n\nEurope has an insane amount of good beer and wine — so you should sample all you can. And let’s be honest, most backpackers drink their fair share as they travel around. Just be cautious because those big nights out can cost you a fortune — but I don’t have to tell you that. As always, buying alcohol from the grocery store is a great way to save a lot of money.\n\nListed below are some sample alcohol prices from around Europe:\n\nLondon (pint of beer): $3.20-$6.50 but expect to pay more at trendy clubs/pubs.\n\nParis (wine): $7-$14 for a cheap bottle of good wine from the store.\n\nPrague (pint of beer): $2 at a restaurant and around $.70 from a grocery store.\n\nBudapest (pint of beer): $2-$4 at a bar.\n\nMunich (beer): $10 for a huge mug at a beer garden and around $1.25 for a liter of beer from the store.\n\nCopenhagen (pint of beer): $9-$14 for a pint of craft beer from a bar.\n\nBuffer Money For Backpacking Europe\n\nWe like to keep a “buffer” fund for emergencies and unexpected expenses like laundry, souvenirs, toiletries, clothing, skydiving, missed trains, etc.\n\nBackpacking Europe City Travel Price Guides\n\nOne major factor in how much you’ll spend while traveling depends on where you travel — you’ll obviously spend more in Paris than in Prague. That’s why we’ve made a series of detailed European City Price Guides that cover day-to-day travel costs like food prices, accommodation prices, and other common expenses that you’ll find in Europe’s most popular cities.\n\nOur Europe City Price Guides also outline some of the best budget-friendly restaurants and other money-saving tips to help you keep your travel costs down.\n\nAMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS Travel Costs For Backpackers\n\nAverage Daily Budget Travel Cost: €55-€80 (Approx. $65-$95).

Some plans even cover loss and theft of personal items and rental car collision coverage. There are multiple companies that offer insurance, but World Nomads Travel Insurance seems to be a popular choice for backpackers.\n\nMobile Data Plan\n\nYou’ll want high-speed mobile data for your phone while traveling in Europe but the international data plan from your provider can cost you $70-$100/week. However, you can buy prepaid SIM cards and eSIM data plans that will run you about $15-$25/week.\n\nI’ve written multiple articles about getting mobile data for Europe:\n\nData Plans and Smartphone Phones Abroad: Staying Connected While Traveling Europe\n\nHow To Buy A SIM Card and Mobile Data Plans in Europe\n\nGuide To Buying SIM Cards and Mobile Data Plans in France\n\nGuide to Buying SIM Cards and Mobile Data Plans in Germany\n\nGuide To Buying SIM Cards and Mobile Data Plans in Italy\n\nGuide To Buying SIM Cards and Mobile Data Plans in Spain\n\nGuide To Buying SIM Cards and Mobile Data Plans in the United Kingdom\n\nGuide To Using eSIM Data Plans in Europe\n\nPassport: $135\n\nIf you don’t have a passport, you’ll need to get one to travel to Europe. Be sure to apply early because it will cost you another $60+ if you need one in less than 4-6 weeks. Passport photos will cost you about an extra $10, or you can print your own for free at ePassportPhoto.\n\nTravel Backpack or Luggage: $85-$300\n\nMost people choose to bring a backpack to Europe. We’ve compiled a list of the best travel backpacks and created a guide on how to choose the perfect backpack. If you’re on a budget, ask your friends if they have an old backpack or consider buying a used one.\n\nTravel Accessories: $75+\n\nThere are all sorts of accessories (plug adaptors, guidebooks, travel towels, sporks, journals, etc.) that will help make your backpacking trip more enjoyable, but how much you spend will depend on what kinds of things you want. This cost estimate can skyrocket if you start adding things like digital cameras, tablets, and specialty travel clothing. Check out our\n\nCheck out our Backpacking Packing List for Men and our Backpacking Packing List for Women to get an idea of what we recommend packing. Both guides will outline pretty much everything you’ll need.\n\nAirfare: $450-$1500\n\nYour airfare costs will vary based on a dozen factors. We do have a guide to finding cheap flights to Europe that will help you get the best deal possible.\n\nTransportation Costs Within Europe\n\nTransportation within Europe (i.e. traveling from city to city) can make up a large percentage of your travel budget, but it is also very hard to predict how much you’ll spend. There are so many factors that go into how much each form of transportation (train, plane, bus, car, etc.) will cost that I can’t really give a super accurate estimate. However, I can give you some general guidelines and point you to more in-depth articles.\n\nRemember, the less you change locations, the less you’ll spend. Consider spending more time at each location if you’re on a very tight budget.\n\nTrain Travel Prices\n\nThe trains in most of Europe are amazing, and they’re usually fairly affordable. Most countries charge by distance traveled, but the prices can change based on the time of day, availability, and type of train (high speed vs normal speed). Tip: On high-speed trains, it is best to book as far in advance as possible to ensure the best price.\n\nHere are some helpful guides to taking trains in Europe:\n\nComplete Guide To Train Travel In Europe\n\nBelgium Train Guide\n\nEngland Train Guide\n\nFrance Train Guide\n\nHow To Buy Train Tickets in France\n\nGermany Train Guide\n\nItaly Train Guide\n\nHow To Buy Train Tickets in Italy\n\nNetherlands Train Guide\n\nPortugal Train Guide\n\nSpain Train Guide\n\nHow To Buy Train Tickets in Spain\n\nSwitzerland Train Guide\n\nEurail passes are another popular method of travel for backpackers. These passes aren’t dirt cheap like they were in the past, but for many travelers, this is still an affordable way to travel. There are dozens of Eurail passes available to suit almost any need. Prices range from about $100 for a super basic pass to $2000 for a 3-month unlimited pass.\n\nFor more info, read our Guide To Rail Passes in Europe.\n\nEurope Flight Prices\n\nAir travel inside Europe can be very affordable — cheap even. For example, it’s not uncommon to find a one-way ticket from Paris to Berlin for $50 or from London to Barcelona for $40. Of course, there will be extra costs like transportation to and from the airport.\n\nFor more information, read our article about how to find cheap flights in Europe.\n\nEurope Rental Car Prices\n\nTraveling by car is a good way to travel if you want to see small towns and rural areas. It’s a pain in the ass if you’re city-hopping. I rented a car to drive around France for four days and it cost around $200 for an automatic transmission car (after all the extra taxes). However, you’ll cut your rental fees in half if you know how to drive a manual transmission. You also have to consider all the potential extra fees like tolls, gas, parking, etc. — which add up quickly.\n\nLearn more about renting a car in our guide to car rentals in Europe.\n\nLearn More About Backpacking Europe"
