        "text": "The Livorno port is industrial. No passengers are allowed to walk through it.\n\nThere are several options:\n\n-- If you are on NCL you can take their shuttle direct to the train station. No other line (that I know of) offers this option.\n\n-- There will be a line-up of taxis when you get off the ship. You can negotiate with them for a ride to the train station but many are unwilling to undertake this short trip -- they are looking for full-day fares to Florence or Pisa. Expect to pay 20-25 euros if you can find one willing to take you. (This would cover up to four people so you could try to find someone to share....)\n\n-- The remaining option is to take the ship shuttle to a central piazza in Livorno that is also a transportation hub of sorts. Once there, take a city bus to the train station. OR consider the buses that leave directly from this piazza to Florence or Florence/Pisa (these are special buses laid on for tourists, not city buses and can be a good option).\n\nTo answer your other questions about the train:\n\n-- Yes it is safe. As always in urban areas, look out for pickpockets; keep your valuables in a spot that is not accessible.\n\n-- You can use cash or credit card to purchase tickets. I would wait and buy them at the station just in case of changes to your schedule. There are machines in the station or you can wait in the ticket line. You can also purchase tickets in the little shop to the right of the ticket windows.\n\nCHECK THE TRENITALIA SCHEDULE (shared above) CAREFULLY. As I recall, the trains from Livorno are frequent in the morning but when returning in the afternoon there is a period in the early-mid afternoon where there are not very many options. Best advice I learned here is to always figure out what is the last train that you could take and still make it back to your ship (allowing time to get back once on the ground in Livorno) -- and then plan on taking the train BEFORE that one so that you have a \"just in case\" option.\n\nEdited December 8, 2022 by cruisemom42\n\nAll good (and accurate information) above as far as I can recall.\n\nWhen I went (years ago, now), there was no shuttle directly to (and hopefully from) the train station. Had there been, I would have jumped on it in a heartbeat to simply things. Even at a cost.\n\nInstead, my group of 3 headed to the taxi line to see if we could convince one to take us to the train station. Along that short walk, we teamed up with 2 strangers to make a group of 5 to split the cost of the taxi. We paid 25 euros for the trip (keep in mind this was years ago, so it may be higher now). So, we effectively paid 5 euros each for the taxi. The first few taxi drivers declined us. But we found one that eventually said yes.\n\nWe purchased tickets inside the train station at the service window. We were able to find seats together on the train. The train was safe. Watch your valuables. The Santa Maria Novella train station in Florence was just a short walk from the sites, so there should be no issue there. Have a decent map (paper or on your phone) and you're good to go to walk everywhere.\n\nOur only challenge was on the return trip. Upon arrival back at the Livorno train station, there were no taxis waiting to take us back to the ship. We waited at the taxi stand and others joined in. After about 15 minutes or so, still no taxis. I asked the agent inside if they could call a taxi. He just shrugged his shoulders at me. Then I saw a public bus waiting at the station and I somehow determined he was heading to the Piazza Grande, which is closer to the city center. I can't recall if the bus driver spoke enough English or if it was signed on the bus or what. But my group jumped on board and paid for it with some remaining euros. I was thinking we'd be more likely to get a taxi to the ship from the more central city location. However, while looking around, we saw shuttles to the cruise ships around the corner (closer to Piazza del Municipio). So I approached the one which had a sign for our ship and asked if I could ride back. I offered money, but the driver just waved us on. I believe the payment was actually supposed to be done on the ship in the morning for the shuttle, but we never did pay for it.\n\nSo, bottom line, we got back to the ship in plenty of time. But we were a little nervous when we faced no taxis at the train station. If your ship has a dedicated ship-to-station shuttle that runs both ways, then this will greatly simplify the day.\n\nEven with that one issue, riding the train into Florence was a great decision for us.\n\nEdited December 8, 2022 by MeHeartCruising\n\n4 hours ago, mikepmcm said:\n\nIf you're looking to save time the train timetable seemed to be no faster than the cruise's bus excursion. We too thought about the train but the uncertainty in getting to the station, and returning back on time, made the added costs of the ships excursion to be preferable. There are several private tours available but the common complaints on message boards was the shuttles used had no bathrooms for the hour and a half ride.\n\nIf you're on the ball and get your day started right away, you WILL have more time in Florence than via the bus tour, which invariably seems to make a long rest stop enroute to Florence.\n\nA few years ago I did a detailed post laying out the minute-by-minute process and you can have at least an additional hour to 90 minutes in Florence by using the train. It may not seem like a lot, but adding more than 10% more time over what most tours offer is often the difference between being able to see one more thing in Florence.\n\nAlso, I don't understand your statement about bathrooms. Rarely do coaches have working onboard bathrooms. On a true private tour, you can ask your driver for a stop whenever it's needed. If you're talking about a ship tour, surely it is not too much to think that a participant should be able to go at least 90 minutes without a bathroom break? I just recently returned from a Med cruise where the transfer from Venice to Ravenna to board the ship was 3 hours -- no bathroom stop offered.\n\n2 hours ago, euro cruiser said:\n\nAs most restaurants don't even open for dinner until 7 PM or so, and the train ride back requires about 90 minutes, I doubt you'd be back by 9 PM.\n\nAt any rate, your odds of getting a taxi are much higher at Pisa than Livorno. I would not count on taxi availability at Livorno, although you could get lucky. If you speak Italian well enough to make a phone call you can call the company posted at the station.\n\n13 hours ago, Macdooger4 said:\n\nNot a bad idea, except I don't really want to spend any more money, haha...thjhis trip is already costing a fortune!\n\nMacdooger-\n\nA taxi from Pisa should be about 50-65 euros. Certainly more at night.\n\nhttps://www.rome2rio.com/map/Pisa/Piazza-Luigi-Orlando-Livorno-Province-of-Livorno-Italy\n\nA transfer service will be more expensive than the taxi.\n\nNot to sound crazy, but you can book a good, simple room in Florence for between 50 and 100 euros and it will include breakfast. You can train to Pisa the next day for sightseeing. Then train to Livorno followed by inexpensive bus or shuttle to the port.\n\nI just did a fake booking for early May on one of the hotel search engines and it came up with about 115 rooms between 50 and 100 euros. Some with very good ratings in simple guest houses or 1 or 2 star hotels. They generally do not require prepayment and can be cancelled up to a day or so before arrival. You could book one at no risk while you decide on other arrangements or reconsider your plans. A night in Florence is something to really be enjoyed."
