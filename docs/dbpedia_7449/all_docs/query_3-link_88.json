Where accommodation with private outdoor space is not available, we have selected comfortable hotels with spacious common areas as well as a convenient location close to recreational areas and sights. As your comfort is our priority, we try to book hotels located within walking distance of the Camino. Despite our effort, on rare occasions your accommodation can be located a few kilometers away from the trail, so we organise transportation to/from your accommodation.\n\nPisa International Airport 35km: Firstly you need to reach Pisa central train station (Station Ferroviara Pisa Centrale).

The unreserved regionale train from Viareggio to Lucca also costs 3 Euros and takes just under 30 minutes travel time.\n\nFlorence International Airport 70km: To reach Santa Maria Novella train station (S.M.N) from the airport the easiest way is to take the city line.
