        "text": "When running any company it's important to know what you are in the business of actually doing. For CEO of transport search engine Rome2rio, Rod Cuthbert, the answer is easy: \"We help people answer the question 'How do I get from A-B?' We've made a rock-solid decision that that's a good business to be in,\" he says.\n\nBy the numbers at least, he's right. The site, which launched in 2011, currently gets over 8 million visitors a month (he expects that will hit 30 million within another couple of years, based on current growth).\n\nThe idea that users could ask \"How do I get from London to Geneva?\" and be provided with options and pricing on everything from planes and trains to ridesharing, came about when two former Microsoft employees (Michael Cameron and Bernie Tschirren) had the idea of building a search engine just for travel.\n\nThen San Francisco-based, Cuthbert had just sold his travel aggregator Viator to TripAdvisor,. All three were keen to move back home to Australia, so they joined forces, using Cuthbert's commercial nous to give the technically driven concept legs.\n\n\"I really only know one industry and that's online travel,\" Cuthbert says.\n\nIt's an industry he started in early. After dropping out of school before the end of year 12, Cuthbert began working with computers. The inspiration? His dad, who was the computing manager at Cadbury Schweppes.\n\n\"They had one of the first mainframes in Australia and I loved going in there. I wrote a letter to a company hiring in Melbourne, including the bit about my dad's job, and they hired me,\" he laughs.\n\nThe next decade or so saw Cuthbert running computer stores, working in technical roles and eventually, starting a company to help businesses built websites in the very early days of the internet.\n\n\"Nobody knew how big it would be, but we guessed it might be important,\" he says.\n\nCoincidentally, most of the clients wanting websites were travel companies – either as agencies or wholesalers. Cuthbert realised there was an opportunity to aggregate all their products (and more) into one place online, and Viator was born.\n\nNineteen years later, he sold it to TripAdvisor, leaving Cuthbert free to help Rome2rio kick off.\n\n\"Building a second business is completely different, but a lot of fun,\" he says.\n\nBut with the fun comes serious business opportunities. Rome2rio is about to merge into a booking tool – so users will not only find the best travel option for their route, but be able to book tickets directly, earning the site a commission in the way a traditional travel agency would, and putting them in competition with sites like Expedia and Webjet.\n\nWhile the latter doesn't seem to bother him – it's a different product offering, he says – Cuthbert is fully cognisant he's playing in an acquisitive market. Eventually, he surmises, Rome2rio will be bought out by one of the big players.\n\nBut in the meantime, his focus is on the product, and on ensuring that his 18 team members understand exactly how a piece of code impacts the end user.\n\n\"You're searching on how to get from A to B and are going to make a travel decision or a booking based on that. We want all our developers and staff to understand how crucial [their work] is in making you a satisfied customer,\" he says.\n\nCURRICULUM VITAE\n\nName: Rod Cuthbert.\n\nCurrent position: CEO, Rome2rio.com, a multimodal transport search engine and booking site based in Richmond, Victoria.\n\nResponsibilities: Commercial strategy and industry relations, particularly in Europe, our major market.\n\nEducation: I'm definitely a student in the \"School of Life. I left school just before the end of year 12. It was a time when you could get into some interesting roles pretty quickly.\n\nAdditional training/courses: Not many to note, or remember. Early jobs at NCR and DEC featured tons of great training, all of which is now out of date. That's the computer industry for you.\n\nProfessional associations: I'm not much of a joiner, though I recently bought a share in a racehorse, so I'm thinking of joining the VRC. Professionally, I'm a regular judge at the Phocuswright Travel Innovation Awards in the US, a gig I really enjoy.\n\nHonourable mentions: Rome2rio has won People's Choice Award at Phocuswright (2012), the TRAVELtech GlobalCollect Website of the Year (2013) and WITovation's Data Specialist Award (2015)."
