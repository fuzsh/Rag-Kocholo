        "text": "üé§ Hackstreets Back, ALRIGHT! üé§ Our 2024 Rome2Rio hackathon was nothing short of amazing. With a 90s theme, think Backstreet Boys vibes but with keyboards, whiteboards and code. üòé From groundbreaking ideas to unbeatable team spirit, our team showed exactly why this event is the highlight of our year. One of our senior engineers explained, \"We love the Rome2Rio hackathon. It's a time for us to get together, have fun, and let our creativity flow freely. With no usual boundaries, it's inspiring to see the level of innovation that comes out of it.\" Massive thanks to all our hackathon heroes, judges, and organisers who made this one ‚ÄòLarger than life‚Äô üöÄ See it in action here: https://lnkd.in/gQpD3Vf4 #HackstreetsBack #TechInnovation #Teamwork #Hackathon #AsLongAsYouCodeWithMe\n\nSouth Korea has been topping many travel wish lists lately. Thanks to its K-pop sensations, recent K-dramas on Netflix, and famous K-food, it's a destination firmly on the travel radar. Rome2Rio's Senior Data Operations Manager, Claire Baxter, recently spent a week in Seoul: working in the morning allowed her to explore later in the day. \"Working remotely was a great way to experience Seoul. There is so much to do and it is a really big city, so trying to fit it all into a couple of days could have been quite overwhelming. Spending a full week there, working in the mornings and exploring in the late afternoon/evening, meant that I could slow down and focus on one neighbourhood each day. I felt I got to know the city much better doing it this way so would really recommend it to people whose work allows them to do this. After work hours, I recommend going to a Korean baseball game...the atmosphere was off the charts! Each player has their own chant and dance, and the whole crowd knows them and chants/dances along with the cheerleaders. I enjoyed hiking the city walls at Insangwan and Naksan Mountain followed by many visits to many, many bakeries. Getting the airport bus, the metro and walking were easy ways to get around. Get yourself a T-Money card. It can be used for travelling on the metro but also for making purchases at convenience stores. You can buy one from a convenience store and then top it up at metro stations. Walking you'll find so many unexpected sites and parks on the way that you'll miss if you're underground. There's so much more green space than I was expecting. It makes the city much more beautiful than I‚Äôd anticipated.\" #remoteworking #traveltech #ontheroad #southkorea\n\nAt Rome2Rio, we're not just about helping others plan trips; we're travel enthusiasts ourselves! üåç ‚úàÔ∏è. Recently Head of Data Operations, Kurt Andersen, took advantage of our travel benefits to visit family and spend three weeks in England, with weekend trips to Paris and Dublin. Kurt's highlights included: ‚Ä¢ Cheering on Chelsea's men's and women's football teams at Stamford Bridge ‚Ä¢ Exploring world-renowned art galleries like Tate Modern and The Louvre ‚Ä¢ Finding the perfect pint of Guinness in Dublin It wasn't all about the destinations; Kurt enjoyed 'road testing' our product to get around. Here are some of his top transport tips: üöå \"The Tube isn't the be-all and end-all in the UK ‚Äì often buses are quicker and cheaper for many journeys. üö§ Thames Clipper/Uber Boat is a great way to travel for longer journeys in London, with amazing river views along the way. üö≤ Cycling around Paris was great ‚Äì no direction, just following my nose! Thankfully, Rome2Rio got me back to my hotel after I had ended up a long way away. üõ≥Ô∏è Always look for the road less travelled. I took a ferry from Dublin to Holyhead on the way to London with a night in Liverpool. I saw so much more than just flying back to London and wouldn't have visited Liverpool otherwise.\" Thanks, Kurt, for sharing your pics and story! #tripplanner #traveltech #UK #Paris #Dublin #transport\n\nHeld annually since 1955, NAIDOC Week is an annual celebration and recognition of the culture, achievements and resilience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The calls for the week to include a national public holiday have not been heeded. Yet the week has been gaining more momentum with increasing numbers of people and companies celebrating. This week we've held a range of events including a photo competition. It was designed to get the team out and about, exploring places of significance to First Nations' history and culture in their local areas. So far entries have included a scarred tree, murals, traditional meeting places and Uluru at sunrise all accompanied by thoughtful descriptions. A highlight is the blend of cultures from this entry from Engineering Manager, Priya K Kumaran, with her entry of a mural in Richmond seen from the train. She said \"Every time I pass this on the train I think of the quote from Bhagavad Gita (Hindu scripture): 'The spirit is beyond destruction. No one can bring an end to a spirit which is everlasting'. To me this means things around can change but the truth will always remain.\" Thanks to Priya for her photo and words. #NAIDOC2024 #FirstNations #NAIDOCWeek\n\nAt Rome2Rio we rely on our freelance data specialists and customer service team members dotted around the world. üó∫Ô∏è üåé Over the years we've created a number of rituals to keep us all connected, including our annual photo challenge, which helps everyone to get to know each other better with a little healthy competition on the side. From stunning landscapes to pet accessories, participants flexed their photography skills submitting quality (and at times hilarious) pics according to weekly themes. üì∏ The winners were... Wildflowers blooming in the Atacama Desert during 'desierto florido' (flowering desert). @melisagescoto The Ruskeala Express, a famous, vintage train which operates in Karelia, Russia. Nikolai Khrustalev Rori the cat, sporting a pair of sunnies. The very definition of a 'cool cat'! Pavlos Papadimitriou Ishan wearing a Rome2Rio tee on a Mumbai suburban train. Ishan Chaurasia Thanks to our wonderful freelance team for participating and Kaitlin McDowell for organising. Until next year üì∏‚ù§Ô∏è #traveltech #remotework #teamengagement #techteam"
