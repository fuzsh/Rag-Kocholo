        "text": "ASX-listed online travel marketplace Jayride has announced the appointment of Rod Cuthbert as an independent, non-executive director.\n\nCuthbert is the founder, former CEO and chairman of Viator, a global marketplace for tours and activities which launched in 1995 and was acquired by Tripadvisor in 2014.\n\nHe is also the former boss of Rome2rio, the door-to-door travel search engine which was acquired by Omio in December 2019.\n\nCuthbert is currently a non-executive director of Veltra Corporation, which is regarded as Japan’s leading online seller of tours and activities; and of Imperium Tourism Holdings, a travel group with agency, wholesale, tour, and technology assets.\n\nAndrey Shirben, chairman of Jayride, said the company’s board was delighted with Cuthbert’s appointment.\n\n“As part of our ongoing process of board refresh and renewal, we have been seeking an independent, non-executive director with proven experience in the global expansion of online travel technology businesses,” he said.\n\n“Rod has proven experience building successful businesses in our industry and delivering value for shareholders through both good times and bad.\n\n“We look forward to working closely with him as we execute on our three long-term strategic priorities of increasing traveller retention, conversion and acquisition.”\n\nCommenting on his appointment, Cuthbert said: “I’ve known managing director Rod Bishop and the team at Jayride since their early days, and have admired their ability to stay focused on a specific sector of the travel market.\n\n“They are attempting to solve what is a difficult problem for travellers, and they’re clearly making real progress, notwithstanding the temporary challenges presented by COVID-19.\n\n“The fact that it’s a tough job is what makes this such an attractive opportunity. The company that solves airport transfers first will reap substantial rewards over a long period of time.\n\n“I look forward to helping Rod and the team achieve that goal.”\n\nPlease wait while we sign you in with LinkedIn.\n\nThis may take some time.\n\nPlease be patient and do not refresh the page.\n\n(A new window from LinkedIn should open for you to authorize the Travel Weekly login.
