        "text": "Rome2Rio\n\nFounded in Australia, the travel-focused tech scale-up, Rome2Rio, is a world-first platform that offers a multi-modal solution to help travelers across the globe easily get from A to B.\n\nWith over 30 million users a month as of 2022, Rome2Rio is tapping into a niche section of the multi-trillion dollar global travel industry. It’s no wonder it’s such an exciting time to join their fast-scaling journey.\n\nWhat Rome2Rio is all about\n\nPicture this: you decide that you’re ready to take a well-deserved vacation and look to begin planning the logistics of getting to your dream destination. You plug your starting and end points into a popular travel planning platform and, low and behold, you are only presented with flight and hotel options. What if you don’t want to fly to your destination? What if your destination is not a major city or is off the beaten track?\n\nThis is where Rome2Rio excels! An Australian success story with global reach, Rome2Rio, is a multi-modal travel planning platform. The door-to-door search engine allows you to search any city, town, attraction, landmark, or address across the globe and it will present you with numerous options for modes of transport to get you from A to B. Post-Covid travel has literally never been so easy.\n\nFounded in 2011 in Melbourne by two engineers originally from Seattle, Rome2Rio’s product has seen significant growth in popularity in the past decade. Acquired by European travel giant, Omio in 2019 - the stars are the limit for these guys. Now attracting over one million users to their platform a day, or over 30 million users a month, it is no wonder that the team is looking to expand its capacity and impact.\n\nJoining Rome2Rio now is a phenomenal opportunity to join a company on an exciting and stable growth journey, as well as to help shape a product while solving the real-time problems of millions of users worldwide.\n\nRome2Rio is looking to add a Senior Full Stack or Back End Developer to their cross-collaborative team.\n\nYou’ll be heavily involved in the processing, tooling, and collecting of all of the data sets collected to show their users from sources worldwide. You’re keen to explore different algorithms and data structures to make sure that users are able to search for the best travel functions at the speed of light.\n\nYou’ll have the opportunity to impact millions of users a day while working on a product that will show the fruits of your labour in real-time. You’ll also get to work on modern technology in a highly agile environment.\n\nThe Team\n\nRome2Rio works in five cross-functional engineering teams, with three of these teams focused directly on working end-to-end across the product. You will be joining the Engagement Team where you will be working closely with users on the main flow of the Rome2Rio Map Project within their Explore product.\n\nEach team is an autonomous and agile unit consisting of a Product Manager, Data Scientist, Designers, and Engineers.\n\nCulture & Values\n\nThis company has a truly special culture. Rome2Rio prides itself in its can-do, engineering-centric culture built by the founders and shaped and upheld by the rest of the team.\n\nThey also put a lot of importance on values like mental health, work-life balance, and continuous learning and upskilling for the team. These values are seen through company lunches, flexible working hours in a casual office space, 5 weeks of annual leave a year, and a yearly health and wellness benefit.\n\nFinancials & Benefits\n\nOn top of a great market salary, you’ll get a generous biennial travel allowance to use during your five weeks of annual leave to test the Rome2Rio application as a user as well.\n\nThey also offer access to a budget for an annual learning and development budget, a biennial ground transport fund for transit expenses outside of Melbourne, as well as 10 weeks of paid parental leave for primary carers and 4 weeks for secondary carers."
