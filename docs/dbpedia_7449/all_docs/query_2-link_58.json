        "text": "“We wanted to create something to expedite what a forwarder has to go through, checking a million different sites or platforms. We want them to choose the best route for their needs so we consolidate as many choices for them as we can,” she said.\n\nFeatures available today include route and schedule searching. By simply entering an airport, seaport, city or country, forwarders can see a mix of options, giving them the capability to make the best choice based on all information provided.\n\nAs the company continues to add features, it will provide two-tiered plans for certain premium features, but company officials told FreightWaves they believe they will always have a free plan to inspire freight forwarders to think differently about their supply chains.\n\n“We know from our survey of how the industry performs pre-shipment research that freight forwarders spend many hours each week searching for routes, carriers, schedules and prices, visiting multiple sites to gather the data, then more time on other sites double-checking their findings. They can do all of that in minutes using Fluent Cargo,” said CTO Andy Greig.\n\nWatch now: Why ocean container volume recovery won’t be fast\n\nThroughout the next quarter, customers can expect updates to the system including scheduling a whole week of container pickups, vessel sharing agreements, alliances and feeder network integrations, and routing guidance for river barges, rail options and domestic trucking rates.\n\nBernstein, who gets to take her experience from previous ocean shipping work and translate it into technology, is excited to be involved in developing a tool that can help smaller freight forwarders compete.\n\n“Seeing the amount of time and information that goes into creating our unique algorithm to be able to parse through all of this data and provide these results in milliseconds. … I think it is just really exciting to be a part of this new approach.”\n\nRead more\n\nSAP launches AI solutions for ‘future-proofing’ supply chains\n\nArchlynk acquires WCS Consulting to raise bar on supply chain solutions"
