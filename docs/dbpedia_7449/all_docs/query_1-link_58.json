There is hourly service on the train from Santiago to Ourense and then a change of train but the schedule isn't that great. It looks like a better bet would be from A Coruna (direct train to Sarria) and buses that you have to change in Lugo but better connections. With all the pilgrims from Santiago you would think there would be a Santiago->Sarria direct train.\n\nBradypus\n\nMigratory hermit\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nToo many and too often!\n\nJan 12, 2020\n\n#7\n\nWith all the pilgrims from Santiago you would think there would be a Santiago->Sarria direct train.\n\nThere were plans announced in 2018 to create a direct bus service that would run from Santiago to O Cebreiro and passing through Sarria and the other main Camino Frances towns along the way. I have heard nothing more about the idea since. Personally I would find it very strange and unsatisfactory to travel all the way to Santiago just in order to leave it by bus or train and then walk back to there. Seems a peculiar way of approaching a pilgrimage to begin from your destination!\n\nLos peregrinos tendrán línea de bus desde Santiago para hacer el Camino\n\nEl Xacobús irá hasta O Cebreiro y parará, entre otros puntos, en A Lavacolla, Arzúa y Palas\n\nClive Williams\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nWalking the Camino de Santiago, only the last 100km from Sarria to Santiago I'm April 2020\n\nJan 12, 2020\n\n#8\n\nThis video is worth a watch:\n\nThe cost is about €10 for the bus to Lugo and bout €5 from Lugo to Sarria.

We would like to get to Sarria on that Sunday so that we have a day to look around on the Monday before starting the walk on the Tuesday. We are then planning on have a couple of extra nights in Santiago after completing the walk.\n\nReally appreciate your help so many thanks,\n\nClive\n\nMark McCarthy\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCF 2014 2015\n\nLourdes 2 SdC 2016\n\nSarria 2 SdC April&Oct 2016 & (April 2018)\n\nCamino Baztan June 2017\n\nJan 12, 2020\n\n#9\n\nThere is a bus at 18:45 which gets into Lugo at 20:30 amd they you have a quick change at Lugo stop to take the 20:35 Monbus to Sarria. It is a small bus station and the bus generally arrives in early so a 5 minute switch over should be OK. The Monbus arrives in Sarria at 21:05. It is about a 10/15 minute walk from the bus station to the old town where most of the albergues are based. There is not a lot to see in Sarria itself and personally, if I had an extra day I would either split the third day (which is the toughest day) by staying in Melide or have an extra day in Santiago.\n\nClive Williams\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nWalking the Camino de Santiago, only the last 100km from Sarria to Santiago I'm April 2020\n\nJan 12, 2020\n\n#10\n\nThere is a bus at 18:45 which gets into Lugo at 20:30 amd they you have a quick change at Lugo stop to take the 20:35 Monbus to Sarria.

It doesn't show it anymore, even though Rome2Rio still advises about it. Their webpage doesn't let to chose Sarria as a bus station at all now, neither from nor to Sarria.\n\nI emailed them last week and was said that schedules are changing and better to give them a call - 982292900 .\n\nI just hasn't done it yet, as still have plenty of time and hoping they will amend the webpage schedules accordingly.\n\nMy other option, as advised above is to get to Lugo either by bus (Empresa Portomarin) or by train (renfe) and then quite many trains/buses to Sarria.\n\nDonjek\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012 SJPdP - Fisterra\n\nJan 13, 2020\n\n#15\n\nHi,\n\nI was wondering if anyone could advise on the best form of travel between Santiago and Sarria. I am walking the last 100km of the Camino de Santiago and finding the train/bus websites very unclear on times and cost. The walk starts from Sarria and as I fly in to Santiago need to get to Sarria the same day.\n\nHas anyone had any experience of this and willing to give me some guidance please.\n\nMany thanks\n\nClive Williams\n\nEmpresa Friere bus from Santiago Airport to Lugo.\n\nMonbus from Lugo to Sarria.\n\nBuy bus tickets - Check bus schedules - Monbus\n\nBuy online bus tickets and check schedules.

There I planned to snare a quite-late-afternoon ALSA bus to Santiago via A Coruna. My badly injured left foot had finally given up the ghost....\n\nHOWEVER! Sitting in the Piedrafita bus shelter I glanced at the various handbills pasted onto the glass sidewalls. And there I saw, to my complete surprise, a MONBUS schedule. It showed a MONBUS route from Piedrafita to Santiago which tracked closely with the Camino. A route which would actually get me to my destination hours before the ALSA bus! Wow!\n\nSure enough, a shiny new bus pulled up at 3:15 pm and I hopped on. Ticket cost 16 Euros. I was the only rider for most of the journey. There were a few locals and a very few peregrinos.... The bus stopped at O Cebreiro, Triacastela, Samos, Sarria, Portomarin, and on and on. Wonderful ride, allowing me glimpses of many familiar Camino towns. It arrived at the new intermodal Santiago Station at 6:30 pm\n\nOnce back home I went online and tried to find/print that MONBUS schedule. Couldn't find it!\n\nI'll bet it runs in the other direction, too, from Santiago to Sarria and O Cebreiro....\n\nLast edited: Nov 8, 2021\n\nJohn Sikora\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2021\n\nNov 8, 2021\n\n#18\n\nMonday, Sept 27, 2021.\n\nAfter a sorry Caldo Gallego lunch in O Cebreiro I hobbled 4 km downhill to the very forgettable truck-stop town of Piedrafita do Cebreiro.

In the screen capture in the attachment in post #22 the stops listed on the left side and the route shown on the right side do not match. Rome2Rio has had a problem with Piedrafita do Cebreiro and O Cebreiro for years.\n\nHere is a screen capture of the route of the MonBus going from Sarria to Santiago and without going through Lugo. It is the bus route that corresponds with @trecile's timetable but I can't make Rome2rio display the whole route from O Cebreiro, and this despite the fact that Rome2rio correctly indicates that the bus starts in Piedrafita do Cebreiro (orange label top right).\n\nLast edited: Nov 9, 2021\n\nKanga\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrancés x 5, Le Puy x 2, Arles, Tours, Norte, Madrid, Via de la Plata, Portuguese, Primitivo\n\nNov 10, 2021\n\n#26\n\nThe two youngsters who started Rome2Rio in their parents living room in Melbourne have sold it for some enormous sum to a company that has a focus on selling tickets. Rather sad as it was very responsive when it was about the way to get from one place to another, rather than making a profit out of ticket sales. I once took a photo of a bus schedule and sent it to them and they replied with gratitude immediately, and updated their database. I can't imagine there is any profit in local bus schedules.\n\nDoughnutANZ\n\nKa whati te tai ka kai te tōreapango\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2019, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 & 2028.\n\nNov 10, 2021\n\n#27\n\nMonday, Sept 27, 2021.\n\nAfter a sorry Caldo Gallego lunch in O Cebreiro I hobbled 4 km downhill to the very forgettable truck-stop town of Piedrafita do Cebreiro.
