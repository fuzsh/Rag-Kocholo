        "text": "Near the end of the “Manet/Degas” exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, there is a small drawing by Edgar Degas of a bearish man with a beard. At first glance, you might think the man in the drawing is Edouard Manet, but in fact he’s an author and critic named Edmond Duranty. Nine years before this drawing was created, Duranty wrote something critical of Manet, in response to which Manet, encountering Duranty in a cafe, slapped him. Duranty demanded that Manet apologize. Manet refused. Duranty challenged Manet to a duel. The duel, by sword, took place three days later. Manet was unscathed; I guess you could say he won. Duranty, the man in the Degas drawing, “received a wound in his upper chest,” as the museum text accompanying the drawing states matter-of-factly. I stared incredulously at the text’s last line: “Surprisingly, the two men remained friends after the incident.”\n\nBy the time I really noticed the Duranty drawing, I was on my sixth or seventh visit to “Manet/Degas,” which is closing today. I’d been dipping in and out of it ever since it opened in late September, arriving at odd hours and loitering with intent. The show for me offered a fascinating narrative of a friendship, and in every gallery there lay coded clues and submerged hints about the intense feelings that the two painters had for, and about, each other. The fact that Degas had done a drawing of a man whom Manet wounded in the chest made me feel that Manet was part of the story Degas was telling. It’s a story both amazing and faintly familiar to anyone who’s read Greek tragedy, the Bible or Shakespeare, or watched the evening news. As grandiose as it sounds, it also felt familiar from my own experience.\n\nI recognized in the story the excitement of adjacency that comes with certain friendships that border on rivalry — when you have a friend who inspires feelings in you, some admiring, others confusing or even unpleasant, even hateful, and all of them as intense as love. It’s a love that can turn readily to rage but can also be rocket fuel to keep you going creatively, out of both a need for your friend’s approval and a fear that, with his accomplishments, that friend will leave you behind. Rivalry and affection become so intertwined as to become indistinguishable. When you add ambition to the mix, it creates a complexity that ultimately can make these friendships deeper and more valuable, the most treasured friendships of all, especially after they are lost.\n\nEarly in the Met exhibit, you encounter a pair of engravings, accompanied by text that details the meet-cute story of Degas and Manet’s relationship. They met at the Louvre, while gazing at a Velázquez. Degas was drawing directly onto the waxy surface of a copper plate without having first made a preparatory drawing, a style Manet found unorthodox. Manet approached him and paid him a compliment for his audacity.\n\nContemplating this moment in which a heartfelt compliment was the spark of a complicated friendship, I thought of my friend, the writer Robert Bingham, who died of a heroin overdose in 1999. At a gallery show in New York in the early 1990s, Rob, then a stranger, came up to me and told me he’d read a short story of mine and liked it very much. The story was about a young man whose father died young. I would later discover that Rob was a guy whose father died young, as had mine, though this affinity was something we never actually acknowledged in words. Rob later got involved in a literary magazine I’d started and we had various adventures at home and abroad; he got married and then he died. Now it all seems to have taken place in the blink of an eye, though the exact span, gallery to funeral, was about seven years. In the spring of 2000, we both published novels, his posthumous.\n\nWe had a strange dynamic with our writing: outwardly supportive but not involved in the particulars. We talked about literature all the time but we didn’t read each other’s work or offer notes. We were each a source of anxiety for the other, but also of confidence, in equal if fluctuating measures. To say we were competitive is surely true, but it would miss something more interesting: Rob and I wholeheartedly wanted the best for each other, while also feeling stressed out by the prospect of being exceeded by the other.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
