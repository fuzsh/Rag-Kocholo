(It’s pronounced Nuh-wynn.)\n\nThat’s me in the picture.\n\nI started booking shows at 15. I would hop on the bus straight from class and head all over the Bay Area, performing at parties, restaurants and events. All the while I was honing my craft, creating an impactful and personal style of magic.\n\nI enlisted at 18 and trained as a communications specialist. I traveled all over the world, connecting with people from diverse cultures. I learned the psychology behind human interactions, behind building rapport and creating emotional connections.\n\nI was able to perform magic in some unbelievable locations, from the harsh 105° heat of Death Valley to the Philippine mountains of Fort Magsaysay (and I still blew their minds).\n\nBut enough about me...\n\nYou want your event to be a triumph. You want the entertainment to go without a hitch. You want to hire somebody who understands your vision, and can help you achieve it. You want a consummate professional, who’ll take away all the stress.\n\nYou want your guests to go away perplexed, delighted and itching to come back.\n\nAnd you want to be the hero that pulled it all together, to have adoring crowds falling over themselves to congratulate you on your event-planning superpowers (OK, I’ll stop…).\n\nGive me a call and let's make that next event the most memorable one yet!"
