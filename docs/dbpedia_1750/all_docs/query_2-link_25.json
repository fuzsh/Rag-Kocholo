        "text": "In reflecting on his many years of involvement in U.S. politics and the LGBTQ rights movement, Paul Kuntzler points out that Dec. 28 of this year will mark his 62nd year as a resident of Washington, D.C. And he also points out that two days before that, on Dec. 26, he will celebrate his 82nd birthday.\n\nThose who have known Paul Kuntzler over the years say that while his is not a household name in politics and the LGBTQ rights movement, he has played a critical role as an everyday hero and behind-the-scenes organizer for the Democratic Party and the local and national LGBTQ rights movement.\n\nAmong other things, Kuntzler served as campaign manager for D.C. gay rights pioneer Frank Kameny’s 1971 role as the first openly gay candidate for the U.S. Congress when Kameny ran for the newly created position of non-voting Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives for D.C.\n\nIn his role as campaign manager, Kuntzler is also credited with arranging for more than a dozen volunteers from the then-Gay Activists Alliance and Gay Youth group of New York City to come to D.C. on a bus that the Kameny campaign paid for to help gather the needed 5,000 signatures to get Kameny’s name on the ballot.\n\n“I knew how difficult that was going to be,” Kuntzler said. “And I recognized we were not going to do this all on our own,” adding that the gay volunteers from New York, who joined forces with local D.C. volunteers, obtained a total of 7,800 signatures of registered D.C. voters to get Kameny’s name on the ballot.\n\nAlthough Kameny finished in fourth place in a six-candidate race, his run as the first openly gay candidate for the U.S. Congress drew national publicity, including support from actor Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward, who made a $500 contribution to the Kameny campaign while they were performing at the time at D.C.’s National Theater.\n\nObservers of the LGBTQ rights movement at that time considered Kameny’s candidacy an important development in the effort to advance LGBTQ rights both in D.C. and nationwide.\n\n“Looking back, that probably was one of the most significant things I did in my life,” Kuntzler said in recalling his role as Kameny’s campaign manager.\n\nHe says his involvement in politics began in the summer of 1960 in his hometown of Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich., a Detroit suburb, when he co-founded the Grosse Pointe Young Democrats and served as a volunteer on the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy.\n\n“I met JFK at the Detroit airport and shook his hand,” Kuntzler recalls while he joined a crowd of supporters welcoming Kennedy on his arrival for a campaign tour in Michigan. “It was Labor Day weekend – Sunday, Sept. 4, 1960,” Kuntzler said in demonstrating an amazing recall of dates and events.\n\nKuntzler, who traveled to D.C. to attend the Kennedy inauguration on Jan. 20, 1961, said the idealism of the Kennedy administration prompted him to move to D.C. one year later to become involved in politics and the fledgling gay rights movement.\n\n“I met Frank Kameny at Lafayette Chicken Hut on Sunday, Feb. 25, 1962,” Kuntzler says in referring to the then-popular D.C. gay bar. “And he was then president of the Mattachine Society of Washington,” Kuntzler noted, which was the first significant gay rights group in D.C. that Kameny co-founded.\n\n“He invited me to attend the next Mattachine Society meeting,” Kuntzler recalls. “So, on Tuesday, March 6, 1962, at Earl Aiken’s apartment on Harvard Street, I became the 17th member of the D.C. Mattachine Society.,” Kuntzler continued. “And at the age of 20, I was the only minor involved in the gay rights movement consisting of about 150 people in five American cities,” he said. “I’m the only one still living of the original 17.”\n\nHis membership in the Mattachine Society of D.C. was the start of Kuntzler’s 50-plus years of involvement in the local and national LGBTQ rights movement. He recalls that he helped make history when he joined Kameny and other members of the Mattachine Society in April of 1965 for the nation’s first gay rights protest in front of the White House.\n\nKuntzler said he brought with him a large poster-size sign he made reading, “15 Million Homosexuals Protest Federal Treatment.” He said Mattachine Society of D.C. co-founder Jack Nichols asked permission to carry that sign on the picket line in front of the White House. Kuntzler gave him permission to do so.\n\nTo this day, Kuntzler says, he has a large United Press International photo of Nichols carrying the sign with Kameny, lesbian activist Lilli Vincenz, and Kuntzler standing beside him with the White House as a backdrop.\n\nIn the following three decades or more, Kuntzler served as an organizer and founder of several LGBTQ organizations and projects while pursuing a work career as a manager for several organizations. He served from 1973 to 2007 as assistant executive director for advertising, exhibits and workshop sales for the D.C.-based National Science Teachers Association.\n\nHis many behind-the-scenes involvements included serving in 1975 as the first treasurer for the Gay Rights National Lobby, one of the first national LGBTQ rights organizations based in D.C. that later evolved into the Human Rights Campaign in 1980, for which he also served for a short time as treasurer. In 1979, Kuntzler became a co-founder of the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, D.C.’s first LGBTQ Democratic organization.\n\nAlso in 1979, Kuntzler helped found the National Convention Project, an effort to elect openly gay delegates and secure a “gay rights” plank in the platform at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. The effort resulted in the election of about 100 openly LGBT delegates to the 1980 convention from states across the country, including D.C. and the adoption of an LGBT supportive plank in the Democratic Party’s platform at that time.\n\nKuntzler said he and the others working on the project, which he called a success, were deeply disappointed when then-Democratic President Jimmy Carter lost the November 1980 presidential election to Republican Ronald Reagan. But he said he was inspired to continue his work on behalf of the Democratic Party and LGBTQ rights issues over the next several decades.\n\nThe person most important in his life, Kuntzler said, was his domestic partner Stephen Brent Miller of 42 years who died in July 2004.\n\n“Stephen and I met on Friday, March 30, 1962, at Lafayette Chicken Hut,” Kuntzler said. “I was sitting on the side and Stephen was sitting in the middle, and I think he sent me a beer and then came over and sat down and we talked,” Kuntzler recalls. “We had our first date on the second Sunday in April of 1962.”\n\nThe two went to brunch before going to see a movie and then took a bus to get to Frank Kameny’s house. It was a housewarming party of the house that Kameny had just secured a lease to rent for his residence and his gay rights endeavors. Miller, a professional stenographer who later started his own court reporting business, Miller Reporting, quickly took on the role of being the loving spouse to a committed activist, people who knew the couple have said.\n\nKuntzler said his attendance at the Human Right Campaign’s annual Washington dinner last month, which is one of the nation’s largest LGBTQ events, in which President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden spoke, was a further sign of progress for the LGBTQ rights movement as he sees it.\n\nAsked if he has any advice for the LGBTQ community at this time, Kuntzler said, “I think we need to continue to be vigilant … We need to continue to be vigilant.”\n\nThe executive director and at least one staff member at the D.C.-based LGBTQ youth advocacy organization SMYAL reported the organization has received “threats to do bodily harm,” according to a D.C. police report, following the publication of an article in a conservative online publication that accuses SMYAL of placing prepubescent children “on a pathway to medical mutilation” through SMYAL’s transgender youth support programs.\n\nThe highly critical article was published Aug. 5 in the online publication Townhall.com, which states on its website that it is part of the conservative Salem Web Network that reaches out to “audiences interested in Christian and family themed content and conservative values.”\n\nSMYAL spokesperson Hancie Stokes told the Washington Blade in a statement that SMYAL was not surprised to see “hateful rhetoric” in the publication’s comment section and posted on social media. “While there were no specific threats against our facility or personnel, out of an abundance of caution we alerted authorities to ensure safety of our staff and community,” the statement says.\n\nThe D.C. police report, which lists the incident as a hate crime, says that threats were reported on Aug. 7 by SMYAL Executive Director Erin Whelan, who is listed in the report as Respondent 1. “R-1 received threats that were directed toward her and her staff,” the report says. “R-1 felt threatened by these statements and was in fear for her and her staff’s safety,” it says.\n\nThe police report also identifies another SMYAL staff member as a victim of the threats. But the report does not disclose how the threats were made other than its reference to “statements” reported by Whelan.\n\nThe Townhall.com article, which is 25 pages long, among other things, raises concerns over a SMYAL program called Little SMYALs that is funded in part by a $50,000 grant from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s Office of LGBTQ Affairs for fiscal year 2024. The article notes that SMYAL documents state that the program provides services to school kids from kindergarten through eighth grade after school hours.\n\nAccording to the article, Townhall.com obtained a copy of the grant application through a Freedom of Information Act request. It says the application shows SMYAL agreed to a grant requirement that its purpose in part is to end gun violence and to place “All Students on Pathways to Success.”\n\nThe article says that while applying for the grant, SMYAL argued that those two objectives were achievable through SMYAL creating “a safe space where youth can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination,” “celebrating identity,” “promoting self-acceptance,” and “developing a positive sense of self.”\n\nIn response to a request from the mayor’s office for SMYAL to describe in writing a “programmatic achievement” of the project in the second quarter of the grant period, the article quotes from SMYAL’s response and implies that SMYAL inappropriately encouraged an eight-year-old child to become transgender.\n\nThe article states that as an example of the program’s “efficacy,” SMYAL shared a “success story” of a “little girl whom SMYAL, using a made-up male alias, identified as ‘Daniel.” The article then asserts, “Evidently, the exalted eight-year-old, now a poster child for the program’s cause, was groomed into believing she’s a boy.”\n\nThe article states that SMYAL and the mayor’s office did not respond to Townhall’s requests for comment before the article was published.\n\nIn response to a request by the Washington Blade for comment from the mayor’s office on the article, mayoral spokesperson Daniel Gleick sent the Blade this brief response from the mayor’s office: “Washington, D.C. is proud to be a community that supports, welcomes, and loves our LGBTQ community. We’ll keep fighting for a safe and inclusive future for every Washingtonian, especially the next generation.”\n\nIn its own statement SMYAL strongly disputes the claims made by the Townhall.com article.\n\n“It is important to understand that this is a heavily biased article from a notorious anti-LGBTQ outlet,” SMYAL spokesperson Stokes says in the statement. “Our community is unfortunately very used to these discriminatory and biased attacks. Rather than addressing their complete misrepresentation and mischaracterization of our work point by point, we remain steadfast in continuing to support our community with unwavering strength,” the statement says.\n\nIt adds, “To be clear, SMYAL adheres to all relevant laws and regulations governing youth organizations, and we have a rigorous vetting process in place for our staff to ensure the safety of our youth participants. We actively work to create a community and space where LGBTQ+ youth and their parents and caregivers can thrive through affirming programs and services to develop critical life skills, build community, and foster a sense of belonging…SMYAL believes and trusts that the work we do is lifesaving.”\n\nSMYAL Executive Director Whelan added in the statement, “SMYAL proudly stands by our 40-year history of providing care and support to LGBTQ+ youth.” According to Whelan, “When you work with the LGBTQ+ community you know there are extremists who seek to spread misinformation and politicize our work. SMYAL is aware of our detractors, and we’re committed more than ever to providing inclusive and affirmative support for LGBTQ+ youth and their parents and caregivers.”\n\nOfficials with Whitman-Walker Health say they are moving forward in a joint project with the D.C. Department of Health to increase public awareness of the HIV prevention medication known as PrEP that was launched on July 16 during the first annual PrEP Awareness Day in Washington, D.C.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a proclamation on July 16 for PrEP Awareness Day to “call upon all residents, healthcare providers, and community organizations to participate in efforts to increase awareness, understanding, and accessibility of PrEP.”\n\nIn a separate statement, Whitman-Walker noted that July 16, 2024, marks the 12th anniversary of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of PrEP medication as a safe and effective means of preventing HIV infection.\n\n“This day is dedicated to raising awareness about the life-saving benefits of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PreEP) and its critical role in the fight against HIV/AIDS,” the statement says. The statement notes that PrEP has been proven to reduce the risk of HIV infection by up to 99 percent when taken as prescribed.\n\nBut Whitman-Walker officials and officials with the D.C. Department of Health’s HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, STD and TB Administration, known as HAHSTA, also pointed out at a July 16 press conference announcing PrEP Awareness Day that a large majority of people who could benefit from PrEP are not using it.\n\n“Despite its proven efficacy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), less than 25 percent of the approximately 1.2 million Americans who could benefit from PrEP are currently using it,” Whitman-Walker said in its statement.\n\n“This statistic underscores the need for enhanced public education and outreach to ensure that more individuals, especially those in marginalized communities, are aware of and have access to PrEP,” the statement says.\n\nAs part of its effort to step up promotion of PrEP, Whitman-Walker hosted two happy hour social events, including one on July 17 at the D.C. gay bar Thurst Lounge. The second one was held July 24 at the Sycamore & Oak entertainment center and food court in the city’s Congress Heights neighborhood near Whitman-Walker’s Max Robison Center facility.\n\nWhitman-Walker spokesperson Lisa Amore said Whitman-Walker also has and continues to host “PrEP conversations” at local D.C. beauty and hair salons with a special outreach to African-American women.\n\nAmong those who spoke at the July 16 press conference launching PrEP Awareness Day related efforts were Clover Barnes, Senior Deputy Director of D.C.’s HAHSTA; Naseema Shafi, CEO of Whitman-Walker Health; Juan Carlos Loubriel, Senior Director of Community Health and Wellness at Whitman-Walker Health; and Dr. Kellan Baker, Executive Director and Chief Learning Officer at Whitman-Walker Institute.\n\n“We gather here today not just to raise awareness, but to reaffirm our commitment to ending the HIV epidemic,” Loubriel told those attending the press conference. He said the fact that less than 25 percent of those who could benefit from PrEP are using it is a “gap” that highlights the urgent need for increased awareness and access to PrEP.\n\n“We aim to bridge this gap and ensure that everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or gender identity, has the opportunity to safeguard their health,” he said.\n\nPublic health officials have pointed out that HIV/AIDS continues to be a major public health challenge, with over 1.2 million people in the U.S. living with HIIV and thousands of new infections each year.\n\nInformation about accessing PrEP can be obtained from the D.C. Department of Health at 202-741-7892; and from Whitman-Walker Health via email at [email protected] or by calling 202-939-7690."
