This course emphasizes the understanding and the interdisciplinary nature of video game design; this course is not a computer programming course. Formerly known as GCOM 420.\n\nGAME 303 Video Game Level Design\n\nUnits:3\n\nHours:36 hours LEC; 54 hours LAB\n\nPrerequisite:GAME 301 and MODL 302 with grades of \"C\" or better\n\nTransferable:CSU\n\nCatalog Date:August 1, 2024\n\nIn this course, students will explore the art of video game level design.
