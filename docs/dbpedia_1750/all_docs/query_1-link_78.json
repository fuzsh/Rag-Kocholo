        "text": "Your Southern California Real Estate Agency\n\nHiring the right real estate agent is about finding a professional who cares about you, and wants to earn your respect and trust. We truly care about our customers and clients; and that's why we're so successful. 999 Investments Realty has a proven track record. With years of experience, and hundreds of homes sold, we really love helping Southern California buyers and sellers just like yourself achieve their dreams of buying or selling. We know how to locate the finest properties, and negotiate the best deals. It's our job to know about the latest market conditions, government regulations, and upcoming developments â so that you don't have to.\n\nBuyers' Representation\n\nAs your Buyer's Representative, we can make the process of house hunting much easier and more efficient than if you did it all yourself. We can help you get financing, guide you to local neighborhoods, help you determine your budget, and prioritize a list of essential features that you need in your next home. We'll save you valuable time by finding the properties that best suit your requirements, and will show you only the most promising ones. Once you've found a place that catches your eye, we'll look at comparable properties in the area to help determine a purchase offer. Then we'll negotiate on your behalf with the seller to make sure you get the most favorable terms. It's our job to look after your best interests, and we will do so at no cost to you as a buyer.\n\nSellers' Representation\n\nSelling a house on your own can be an overwhelming task. There's advertising to plan and budget for, open houses and private showings to arrange, purchase offers to negotiate, contract contingencies to worry about, and complicated paperwork to fill out. Make it easy on yourself by putting your home in the hands of seasoned professionals. We have extensive experience marketing properties and showing them to their best advantage.\n\nFirst, we'll perform a comparable market analysis to determine the most appropriate price for your home. Then we'll provide home staging advice and suggest landscaping changes that will help draw buyers in. We'll advertise your home through a variety of methods, including local publications and online MLSÂ® listings. We may even showcase your home as part of our site's Featured Listings.\n\nWhen it comes to negotiating a purchase offer, we'll make sure that you get the best price the market will allow. We'll help you understand contract contingencies and details of the closing process, in addition to handling all the paperwork for you. Essentially, we're here to represent you throughout the entire selling process, and to make sure that your real estate transaction is a positive and profitable experience."
