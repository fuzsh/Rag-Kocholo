        "text": "Q: Please tell us a little bit about your family.\n\nWe are a family of 3. Myself, Thuy and Tristan, who’s 13 going on 30. We enjoy doing activities together like fishing, crabbing, riding bikes and watching movies.\n\nQ: Please tell us about your current, past, or future career/volunteer work.\n\nI operate Mani Pedi at the Isle, a waterless concept nail salon. Check us out at: https://www.manipedisugarlandtx.com/ I created this process to address the major concern everyone has when getting a pedicure, “Is the tub clean?”. Most nail salons do not properly disinfect their pedicure tubs after every customer and because of that, there’s been a rise in bacterial infections like fungus and staph. With the waterless process, there is zero risk of cross contamination and not only is it the cleanest process, it’s also the most comfortable because we are able to incorporate zero gravity massage chairs that everyone sits in. Give it a try and you’ll never go back to the old dirty way.\n\nQ: What do you love most about what you do?\n\nI love the chit chats and interactions with customers.\n\nQ: Where do you see yourself/family in 5 to 10 years?\n\nHopefully retired and chilling on a beach somewhere.\n\nQ: Share something interesting about yourself that most people don’t know.\n\nI beat a former world ranked pro pool player, Rafael Martinez, in an 8 ball tournament.\n\nQ: How long have you lived or worked in Sugar Land?\n\n10 years.\n\nQ: What brought your family to Sugar Land?\n\nOpening our nail salon brought us to Sugar Land.\n\nQ: Name a favorite place you like to visit in Sugar Land?\n\nI actually don’t have a favorite place in Sugar Land. Every part of Sugar Land is great!"
