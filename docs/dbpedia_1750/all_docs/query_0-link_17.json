After her year working as a nanny Jean enrolled in Teachers College and embarked on a successful career in education from classroom teacher to Principal to Supervisory Officer with the Toronto Catholic School Board.\n\nIn 1967 Jean served on the committee that helped organize the first Caribana festival. In 1973 she headed the Toronto chapter of the Congress of Black Women of Canada, later becoming national president. In 1985 Jean left teaching to be the chair of the Metro Toronto Housing Authority where she remained until 1993 when she entered politics.\n\nIn 1993 Jean Augustine was elected to the House of Commons, the first black woman ever. From 1993-96 she was Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nIn 1995 Jean put a motion before Parliament to recognize February as Black History Month nationwide; the motion was passed unanimously in December 1995. In 2002, Jean was appointed Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of Women) making her the first black woman to achieve a post in Cabinet. In 2003 Jean was appointed Minister of State (Multiculturalism and Status of Women); and later would become Deputy Speaker of the Parliament.\n\nIn 2007, after Jean had retired from parliament, the Ontario Government appointed her the province's first Fairness Commissioner. In this role Jean influenced hundreds of improvements made to licensing procedures for professionals educated outside Ontario – improvements that made the process easier to navigate, more transparent and impartial for qualified foreign-trained professionals. After eight years at the helm of OFC, Augustine retired in March 2015.\n\nJean has received many honours and awards. In 2009 she was made a member of the Order of Canada. In 2014 Jean was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nIn 2008, The Jean Augustine Chair in Education, Community & Diaspora opened at York University to help advance education, equity and inclusiveness. The following years have brought the launch of the Jean Augustine Girls' Leadership Academy in Scarborough; the Jean Augustine Centre for Young Women's Empowerment in Toronto; and in 2017, the brand new state-of-the-art Jean Augustine Secondary School in Brampton. Jean holds seven Honorary Doctorates and is among the 100 Brilliant Minded Women in Canada.\n\nJean is a mother of two daughters and grandmother of two grandsons.\n\nSOURCE Canadian Ethnic Media Association"
