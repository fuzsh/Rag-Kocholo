Host, Que-Tran and Professor Nguyen will be discussing his book Văn Chương Tranh Đấu Miền Nam.\n\nProfessor Nguyễn Văn Sâm has been teaching Vietnamese literature since 1962. He has published more than 100 short stories and novels in Vietnamese and is recognized and respected in Chu Nom, a writing system that was used to write the Vietnamese language before undergoing romanization sometime in the 17th century.\n\nIf you would like to connect with Professor Nguyễn Văn Sâm or view his list of works, you can find more information here:\n\nWebsite: https://www.namkyluctinh.org/tuyen-tap/nguyen-van-sam/tieu-su.html\n\nGuest: Professor Nguyễn Văn Sâm\n\nHost: Que-Tran Hoang\n\nEditor + Intro Host: Mai Huynh\n\nSupport the show\n\nTonight, Veronica and Vi will be talking about Loss and Grief but with a focus on the Indigenous Peoples of Canada and the residential school system.\n\nJust a brief overview. The Residential school system operated from the 1880s up to 1996 and was organized by the Canadian Government and was run by Churches. The idea was to educate Indigenous Children and assimilate them into “mainstream white Canadian society”*. The children were removed by force from their families and placed in these schools where many of them were abused and killed.\n\nTonight’s episode is the last in our Let’s Talk series. We hope that we were able to open the door to a better understanding of mental health in the Vietnamese community. I would like to personally thank Veronica and Vi for their hard work and openness in creating this mini-series for the public. They were very kind to volunteer their time, skills, and knowledge to Vi Can Shine! and the community at large.\n\n*https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/the_residential_school_system/#shift-away\n\n--------------------------------\n\nABOUT VI LY\n\nVi is an educational content creator who regularly hosts shows at Vi Can Shine!

Everyone needs a break from their situation from time to time. Most importantly, everyone needs a few happy moments in their lives to give them hope for better days.\n\nWith this in mind, I’ve started a GoFundMe to help Veronica bring one of her projects to fruition!

They’ll also talk about how people can help their family members suffering from depression.\n\nJust some brief facts from CMHA to share. In Canada, in a year, 1 in 5 people will experience mental health problems and by age 40 about half of the population will have a personal experience with mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate. It affects people of all ages, education, income levels, and culture.\n\nThe social stigma and the dismissiveness of mental health issues that exist within the Vietnamese community can sometimes force people to suffer in silence and not seek the help they need and exacerbate the problem even further. We hope that by openly talking about mental health and the struggles that people go through, we, as a community, can start to understand and, most importantly, be kinder and more supportive of those suffering from mental health issues.\n\nIf you are suffering and in crisis, please call your local crisis hotline. We’ve also listed resources for you or your family in our show notes.\n\nVi and Veronica would really appreciate your feedback regarding their show.

In 1978, together with her husband, they formed a resistant group, Luc Luong Viet Nam Tu Do, to fight for freedom. In 1979, her husband and her 13-month son were arrested. Her husband was sentenced to execution, while she was sentenced to 14 years in prison.

In this episode, hosts Quyn Lê Erichsen, M.Ed., RCC, and Edison Tran with guest Cai Tran, discuss how we can connect with our grandparents and grandchildren in a positive and healthy way.\n\nQuyn has a Master's degree in counselling psychology from Simon Fraser University. She has worked with thousands of people across Canada and the U.S., guiding them to make profound changes in their minds and in their lives. You can find more info about Quyn on her website: https://www.quynle.com\n\nFor some of us who are a part of the Vietnamese Diaspora, we sometimes struggle with finding our roots and connecting to the culture our parents grew up in. In the second half of the episode, Mai Huynh will be having a conversation with other fellow Vietnamese Canadians, Tuan Pham and Victoria Tran, about what it means to be Vietnamese and how they each define themselves.\n\nGuests:\n\nConnecting with Our Grandparents: Cai Tran\n\nVietnamese Identity: Tuan Pham, Victoria Tran\n\nHosts:\n\nConnecting with Our Grandparents: Quyn Lê Erichsen, Edison Tran\n\nVietnamese Identity: Mai Huynh\n\nNews: Lan Ngo\n\nEditor: Mai Huynh\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/vicanshine)\n\nIn this episode, Steven Ngo (chair of the VPABC anti-racism committee) and Edison Tran (producer) chat with the Vancouver Police about the rise in anti-Asian hate crime, what we can do as a Vietnamese community, and of course, Vietnamese food.\n\nOur guests are Police Superintendent Howard Tran and Inspector Tan Tran. Superintendent Howard Tran is the highest-ranked Vietnamese officer in Vancouver and oversees the hate crimes unit. Inspector Tan Tran was the first Vietnamese officer hired by the VPD in 1996. Both of them have worked for the police for over 20 years.\n\nDuring the second half, Edison will be chatting with Van Bui about his experience with battling Leukemia, and what helped him through the ordeal. He is a husband to a loving, supportive wife, a father to two young boys, and is an actuary by profession. He hopes to help those who are going through a similar experience or has a loved one overcoming cancer with his story\n\nGuests: Howard Tran, Tan Tran, Van Bui\n\nHosts: Steven Ngo, Edison Tran\n\nTranslator: Vy Li\n\nRadio Introductions: Lan Ngo\n\nEditor: Mai Huynh\n\nSupport the show (https://www.patreon.com/vicanshine)"
