        "text": "Note: Projects for Summer 2024 will be posted in mid-February, and applications will be accepted on a rolling basis from Monday, February 19 until Friday, March 1 at 4:30pm. We anticipate completing hiring decisions on or around March 8 (the beginning of Spring Break).\n\nHerb Scarf Summer Research Opportunities in Economics is a program designed to give Yale students a chance to immerse themselves in ongoing research with faculty in the Department of Economics and other affiliated departments and professional schools. Working closely with a faculty mentor, students will get a better idea of what “doing research” actually means, and why a professor views it as exciting and worthwhile. Students will also have an opportunity to learn, through practical experience, some of the skills associated with the process of doing research -- data collection, coding, writing, and other tasks involved in a research project. The program also includes group events organized by the Program Directors, Tra Nguyen and Sabrina Peng, who are both PhD students in economics. This programming includes faculty and graduate student talks, programming workshops, and social events that teach research skills and help build a community of RAs who can support each other.\n\nParticipating students (Scarf RAs) will be required to work 160 hours on their faculty mentor’s project during the 8-week period from Monday, June 3 to Friday, July 26 (or other dates mutually agreed upon with the student and faculty mentor). Because the goals of the program include developing a cohort of peer colleagues and promoting research mentorship between students and professors, if you are offered and choose to accept a Scarf RA position, you will be required to be in New Haven during the 6-week period from Monday, June 3 to Friday, July 12 to participate in the in-person events organized by the Program Directors and to have in-person research meetings with your faculty mentor."
