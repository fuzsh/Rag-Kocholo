        "text": "The Communications Team works to make sure our branding and voice is people-centered, justice-forward, and free of as much legal jargon as possible.\n\nDeShonna Johnson-Garay, Digital Coordinator\n\nDeShonna Johnson-Garay (they/them) is the Digital Coordinator at If/When/How where they curate intentional, digital spaces of integrity, awareness, and community across If/When/How’s social media platforms. Prior to their time at If/When/How, DeShonna’s political home was Southerners on New Ground (SONG) where they found their sweet spot in the movement as a member of the “DigiCommz” working group. Believing deeply that everyone has a space in the movement (and that may not be on the frontlines!), DeShonna found a beautiful merge of their Sociology and Journalism degrees in digital organizing where they were able to take their sociological teachings of “the personal is political,” and create spaces for people and communities to tell their stories themselves and uplift the voices of those that society and the media has often said were “voiceless.” With this newfound alignment, DeShonna went on to do communications/advocacy work at the Atlanta Policing Alternatives and Diversion Initiative while obtaining their Master in Public Administration (with a specialization in public policy). Afterwards, they served as the digital organizer for Solutions Not Punishment Collaborative (SNaP Co.) curating digital space for Black Queer and Trans folks and sex workers in Atlanta.\n\nIn organizing and outside of it, DeShonna is a creative channel and holistic healing facilitator first. Dedicated to providing spaces for people to be their full, Free selves mind, body, and Spirit free of shackles – those imposed by policy and those imposed by Self, DeShonna is just as much a healing justice organizer as a digital one. They serve their community by providing one-on-one holistic herbal consultations and general herbal support as a community herbalist and healing facilitator. DeShonna has also served as a resident healer and facilitated Black, autonomous healing spaces for several Black, Queer-led social justice organizations including National Bail Out (NBO) and Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100). In other work, they have led workshops discussing Gender Affirming Herbal Therapy© and herbs beneficial for transitioning naturally or complementing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT).\n\nDeShonna’s work – in whatever form – is influenced by their Ancestors, their lived experiences as a Black, Queer, Fat, Non-Binary Trans femme from DA SOUF (“Jawja,” specifically), and their key motto: “never perfect. Always genuine.”\n\nJen Girdish, Communications Director\n\nJen Girdish is If/When/How’s Communications Director.
