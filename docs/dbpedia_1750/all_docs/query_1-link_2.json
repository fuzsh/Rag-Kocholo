He specializes in digital photography of natural landscapes and wildlife from around the world.\n\nIn April 2017, he served in the prestigious National Park Artist in Residence program at Petrified Forest, Arizona, and continues to create programs for the National Park Service. His work also includes an exclusive assignment as a photographer for the Boston Museum of Science, and a position as a program guide and brand ambassador for Swedish outfitter Fjällräven.\n\nHis images have been licensed by organizations such as the Nature Conservancy, Tamron USA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and numerous local and international publications, and his outstanding image-making and teaching have gained him equipment sponsorships from Tamron USA and Sun Surveyor.\n\nPaul lives and works out of Flagstaff, AZ, and can be seen promoting and selling his work at art shows across the southwest. He is also a lecturer and contest judge for camera clubs and the New England Camera Club Council. The Boston Camera Club awarded him Judge of the Year honors for 2015-2016.\n\nPaul offers private one-on-one photography lessons and tutoring for photographers of all ability levels in the Flagstaff area and northern Arizona. He is also available for speaking engagements and commissioned work."
