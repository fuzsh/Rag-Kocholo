        "text": "This was our first experience selling a home. We had lived there and raised our family in the home. Paul was amazing. He quickly answered any questions we had and he was in constant contact with us. We were informed of any information he had on what was required to sell. The experience was so easy and stress free. I would recommend Paul to anyone selling. He was actually recommended to us which says everything about his ability to help smooth over any issues and his experience was so greatly appreciated.\n\nWe had the pleasure of working with Paul for selling our existing home, and purchasing a new one. The entire experience was extremely enjoyable. Paul was very knowledgeable and offered a sense of comfort throughout the whole process. He made us aware of things we otherwise would not have thought about, and consistently went above and beyond to get us the best results. His communication and attention to detail were very impressive. We would highly recommend Paul to anyone looking for a relator that genuinely has your best interest in mind and will go above and beyond to make it happen!\n\nVery professional, I would work with him again. He understood the industry and gave us a lot of feedback. He was always on time, he genuinely seemed to have our best interest and this was our first rental property.\n\nPaul is hands down the best agent! He clearly has an extensive wealth of knowledge in real estate and truly has his clients best interests at heart. He is professional yet personable, reliable, honest, transparent, and a great communicator. We came to strongly value Paul's input incredibly quickly. He shared the good, the bad, and the ugly, never rushing us to make a decision and supporting us every step of the way. We would 10000000% recommend Paul to anyone and everyone!\n\nHad great experience and was very satisfied with Paul‘a professional work. When we had appointments to see houses, he took time to come early and inspected the houses to make sure we understood clearly condition of those before making our decision. Paul also has a good team of inspection and other services.\n\nWe had wonderful experience working with Paul in purchasing our very first house. He is very professional and have extensive knowledge of the market. Paul always provided his honest review about the properties which we viewed and we never saw him in rush for anything. He was extremely helpful, open, transparent, and reliable. Words can not describe how much we thankful for all his help . We highly recommend signing Paul as your realtor. You will be in good hands :-)"
