        "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights was created in 1968 to carry on the legacy and forge ahead with the unfinished work―all in pursuit of the dream of a more just and peaceful world.\n\nThe scope and reach of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights has expanded substantially over the years, yet since its inception the organization has remained focused on the protection of civic space―the freedoms of assembly, association, and expression; the right to dissent without fear of reprisal or persecution; the most basic of rights upon which all others are based.\n\nRFK Human Rights partners with frontline advocates in all corners of the globe to ensure freedom of civic activism, hold leaders accountable, and speak truth to power at every turn. Over the years, we have launched human rights education and engaged the business community in pursuit of our goals. We have fought for racial justice, economic justice, and criminal justice reform. And we have protected women from violence and helped young people who might otherwise be overlooked become the leaders of tomorrow.\n\nAs you scroll through the first fifty years of our history, you will see some of the work we have done to bring about lasting and essential change.\n\nHurricane Katrina: Relief and Recovery\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, RFK Human Rights and community organizer Stephen Bradberry co-founded the Gulf Coast Civic Works Campaign—a partnership of local community, faith, student, labor, and human rights organizations, and their national allies. The Campaign advocated for federal legislation to create living wage jobs, rebuild neighborhoods, and restore the environment in communities still struggling to recover from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike. After President George W. Bush announced that no additional funds would be sent for Gulf Coast recovery, Bradberry and RFK Human Rights organized a bus caravan of hurricane survivors who went to Washington to lobby Congress. Within days, the White House decision was reversed, and an additional $19 billion was allocated for recovery relief.\n\nIn addition, the New Orleans City Council agreed to plans that would turn much of the Lower Ninth Ward, a traditionally African American community, into a golf course. RFK Human Rights facilitated a public relations campaign, featuring Stephen Bradberry, which directly led to overturning the ordinance. Bradberry is a 2005 recipient of the RFK Human Rights Award.\n\nAs a result of intervention and advocacy efforts by RFK Human Rights, the BP Oil settlement with Gulf residents included a $105 million commitment to build and strengthen health clinics across four states of the Gulf coast. Clinics included toxicity analysis and care, as well as community organizing components to help ensure neighborhood involvement and leadership. Nearly a dozen clinics were funded with the initial July 2013 disbursement. Bradberry’s community-based Alliance Institute administered the funds.\n\nRFK Compass Investors: New Approaches to Investing\n\n“The power to act is the power to command resources.” —Robert F. Kennedy, 1964\n\nRobert F. Kennedy advocated partnering the best of community action with the best of private enterprise. And this is precisely what the RFK Compass program was created to do—connect the people with the ideas to the people with the resources.\n\nWhen it was launched in 2009, RFK Compass Investors was the first and only human rights program to talk with the world’s largest institutional investors about the direct links between protecting human rights and optimized investment returns. These discussions have shed light on how racial and economic justice are deeply intertwined. Over time, they have helped uncover best practices to harness the private sector’s considerable influence and enlist it in the cause of racial and economic justice.\n\nEach year, Compass convenes a powerful network of institutional investors, fund managers, and investment consultants, representing almost $7 trillion in assets under management. With the help of industry experts, human rights professionals, political leaders, academics, labor representatives, and the RFK Human Rights leadership, they explore investing approaches that actively prioritize the “S” in ESG (environmental, social, and governance). The social factor is frequently overlooked because its impact on society is often hard to measure but, as recent worldwide protests show, it’s often what stakeholders care about most. The “S” is about ensuring that a company is respecting human rights in the way it makes money, up and down the supply chain. It’s about women and minority-owned firms. It’s about promoting equity in the investment community, both in access to capital and access to career opportunities. In short, the “S” in ESG is about considering human rights violations as risk factors when making investment decisions.\n\nIn the years to come, RFK Compass Investors will continue to build on this framework through continued discussion and greater action in support of racial and economic justice—for the investing community and for society at-large.\n\nRFK Juvenile Justice Collaborative: Renewed Opportunity\n\nThe Robert F. Kennedy Children’s Action Corps was founded in 1969 to promote child welfare and juvenile justice. In 2009, this Massachusetts-based organization partnered with RFK Human Rights to form the RFK Juvenile Justice Collaborative (RFK JJC).\n\nRFK JJC was the first DC-based, national project focused on the issues of youth reentry, and its accomplishments are many. It co-founded a federal policy group that develops strategies and recommendations to improve educational opportunities for reentering youth, while educating policy makers in the process. In 2011, RFK JCC co-sponsored a conference on juvenile justice at Georgetown University’s Center for Juvenile Justice Reform. And in 2012, the organization collaborated on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) reauthorization bill in Congress and secured changes in the Senate bill that would ultimately improve access to education for these young people.\n\nIn 2013, RFK JJC co-wrote and released a policy paper at the Correctional Education Summit co-hosted by the Ford Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education. The paper outlined recommendations for youth in the juvenile justice system and those reentering. It was signed by 128 organizations, including the National Education Association, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and the American Probation and Parole Association, and widely circulated to advocacy groups. RFK JJC continues to meet with federal policy makers at the Departments of Justice and Education in ongoing efforts to implement the important recommendations.\n\n“Robert F. Kennedy Juvenile Justice Collaborative was formed in 2009 to improve federal youth reentry policy through advocacy, coalition building, and giving voice to youth who are directly impacted by the justice system.”\n\n—Kerry Kennedy\n\nCombatting LGBTI Discrimination in Uganda\n\nIn March 2013, Kerry Kennedy led an RFK Human Rights delegation to Uganda to confront discriminatory practices against the LGBTI community. On the first day of their visit, the team held a three-hour meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni regarding the anti-homosexuality bill that was wending its way through Parliament—a bill that called for the death penalty for certain offenses and potential criminal sanctions for parents, friends, and doctors who failed to report those suspected of being LGBTI. The delegation also met with political and religious leaders and various members of civil society.\n\nAt the time, the situation in Uganda for the LGBTI community was especially bleak. They lived in constant fear of human rights violations, including attacks by police.­­­ One evening, following a reception hosted by RFK Human Rights, two LGBTI guests were arrested. The delegation followed the police cruiser to the city jail in Kampala and spent the better part of the night negotiating their freedom. After the intervention of the Inspector General of the Ugandan Police, the top commander of the national force, the two were released at 11:00 p.m. The Inspector General stayed on to meet with the delegation into the early morning hours. Due to his leadership and determination to create a responsible, responsive, and professional force, important actions were put into place. Ugandan police would receive human rights training, a police department desk would be established to service the LGBTI community, and a hotline would be created to offer further support.\n\nDuring a follow-up trip to Uganda in January 2014, the RFK Human Rights team met again with President Museveni. While there has been incremental progress since then, many discriminatory practices remain in place.\n\nJustice for Journalist Nelson Carvajal\n\nIn April 1998, Colombian journalist and teacher Nelson Carvajal was murdered in Pitalito, Colombia. Years later, in 2015, in what they called a “step of great importance,” the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) and RFK Human Rights welcomed the decision of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) to submit the case of Nelson Carvajal to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The hope was that justice would finally be done.\n\nThe IAPA, RFK Human Rights, and the Carvajal family, formally requested that case be submitted since the murder has not been solved by the Colombian government after 17 years. RFK Human Rights led the legal representation. On March 13, 2018, the Inter-American Court issued a judgment declaring the State of Colombia internationally responsible for the death of Carvajal and for failing to guarantee his right to freedom of expression. This marked the first time in the history of Latin America that a country was held responsible for the assassination of a journalist.\n\nFrom Mass Bail Out to Criminal Legal System Reform\n\nRFK Human Rights stands committed to shrinking the scale, scope, and power of mass criminalization and mass incarceration systems in the U.S. In 2018, over the course of one month, the organization coordinated the release of over 100 people across New York City who had been unjustly incarcerated because they could not afford the price set on their freedom.\n\nThe October 2018 Mass Bail Out Action at Rikers Island, inspired by the movement to end bail nationwide, was a collaborative effort of thousands of volunteers, community groups, service providers, public defenders, faith communities, formerly incarcerated people and their families, as well as public officials and activists. The goal: to free women and young people who are victims of a system designed to keep those who lack financial means behind bars pre-trial. It was the largest bail out action that has ever occurred in a single city, posting nearly $1.2 million in bail to free 105 individuals.\n\nThe facts are damning. The U.S. cages more people in its jails and prisons than any other country in the world. In addition to costing taxpayers billions, communities of color who are under-resourced and over-policed are disproportionately harmed. Nearly every day, an average of 500 women and 100 minors are isolated from family, school, and community as they endure neglect and abuse behind bars. And most are simply awaiting trial.\n\nModeling Robert Kennedy’s solidarity approach, RFK Human Rights is continuing to change the narrative for those most directly impacted by the prison industrial complex—Black, Brown, and Indigenous people, and those experiencing poverty. In 2020, we helped push forward landmark New York State legislation that significantly reduced pretrial detention and eliminated cash bail for 90 percent of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies—an important step towards the constitutional promise of presumption of innocence. We are incredibly proud of this effort and the impact that it has already had on the lives of so many. On any given night, there are nearly 7,000 fewer people in jails statewide, which means that they are spared from losing jobs, housing, and custody of their children while they await their rightful day in court.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Human Rights aims to take action where elected officials have failed to do so. Together with frontline advocates, we continue to leverage our unique platform, resources, and expertise to shine a light on the injustices of pre-trial detention and mass incarceration, and to advance the cause of criminal justice reform.\n\nOur Story Continues…\n\nIn 1988, Tom Brokaw interviewed Ethel Kennedy to mark the 20th anniversary of Robert F. Kennedy’s death. Brokaw noted that many of the issues Kennedy talked about and cared about so deeply were still with us. He asked Ethel if she thought we would have already solved these problems.\n\n“Well, I thought we‘d make a dent, and I think we did. A lot of people have made some sacrifice in their lives to make it a better world, and I think in a lot of ways it is. There’s a lot more we can do.”\n\nIn this timeline, we reflect on the first fifty years of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. While much has been done in pursuit of a more just and peaceful world, we understand that the fight to preserve and advance human rights is a long and arduous one. That fight could not be more important, and we remain fully committed to carrying it on for generations to come."
