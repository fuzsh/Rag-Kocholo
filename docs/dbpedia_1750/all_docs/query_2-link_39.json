        "text": "Gülgün Kayim is of Kurdish, Turkish and Circassian Heritage.\n\nShe has more than 25+ years of experience working in the fields of public art, location-based performance, and arts and cultural leadership in nonprofit, educational and government settings. From 2011 to 2023 she served as the founding Director of the Office of Arts, Culture, and the Creative Economy for the City of Minneapolis.\n\nGülgün is a member of the Mayor’s subcabinet and works with elected officials, artists, cultural organizations, public agencies, community leaders, and activists to explore how arts and culture are central to building strong healthy communities. Her work in creative placemaking, investments in the arts and artists, public policy, and cultural justice/equity have become national models of practice.\n\nShe has also served in positions as Assistant Director of the Artist Fellowship program at the Archibald Bush Foundation, St. Paul, the Coordinator of Public Art on Campus, and the Jerome/Lilly Temporary Public Art Commission programs at the Weisman Art Museum, Minneapolis, and Affiliate Faculty in the Department of Theatre Arts and Dance at the University of Minnesota. She also founded and served as the Co-Artistic Director of the award-winning Skewed Visions performance company from 1998 to 2011.\n\nGülgün served on the Executive Committee of the US Urban Arts Federation and was the local policy, co-chair for Get Creatives Working Coalition and she is a member of Americans for the Arts and Grant Makers in the Arts. She has also served in a variety of advisory capacities with national arts organizations including: ArtPlace America, the National Endowment for the Arts, Americans for the Arts, National Coalition for Arts Preparedness & Emergency Response, and the Government Alliance on Race and Equity Arts Workgroup. She holds a Master of Fine Arts in Theatre Directing from the University of Minnesota, a Master of Arts in Theatre Theory and Criticism from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a BA with honors in Theatre and Film from the University of Middlesex, London.\n\nGulgun also speaks Turkish.\n\nKelly has worked with the City of Seattle since 1999, starting as an intern with the Office of Arts & Culture.\n\nShe has a degree in Fine Art from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas where she spent a lot of her time working with the Donna Beam Fine Art Gallery and as an intern working on the grand opening of the Bellagio Fine Art Gallery.

In her free time Kelly enjoys paddling, skiing, and gardening.\n\nFourteen years of social justice work has attuned Otts to the rhythms of stories and how they can move us to action. Blogs were the newest form of social media back then, and Otts trained the Seattle contingent of the Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride to document and share their cross-country journey with the family and supporters they left behind.\n\nTechnology planning and strategic communications led to electronic advocacy and movement building, where Otts learned that all the shiny promise of emerging online platforms meant nothing without mobilizing grassroots participation. Along with video production, he began exploring other visual communications like graphic design, comics, and most recently, animation.\n\nOtts is a bit of a flake with his art practice, flitting from illustration and comix, book arts, paper engineering, and social practice.\n\nJenny Crooks brings passion and creativity to her work for supporting the cultural community and is dedicated to making funding accessible and equitable. She joined ARTS in 2012 as an Arts Program Specialist to manage the office's community-based funding programs including Neighborhood & Community Arts and smART ventures.

After working as a contract specialist with Sedgewick Payne brokerage, where she managed multi-million dollar international accounts, she came aboard LHPAI in 2003. Her artistic lineage starts with her father, the noted jazz pianist Kenny Boas, one of Seattle's celebrated jazz-era musicians. She continues as a founding member of The Mahogany Project, a performing arts group that provides African-American's a means to be the makers and owners of their art. Her play Journey from Spruce Street premiered in the 2007 Mahogany Project's theater festival. In 2015, her play Jazz Prayer about the 1940s jazz era in Seattle premiered at Theater Off Jackson with Freehold Theater's Emboldenedplay about Buddy Bolden. Sandra's plays, including Sister Fusion and Black Label, challenge simple-minded stereotypical beliefs about African Americans and reveal her family's vanguard confrontation of racist barriers in Seattle. A social activist, her career has always included involvement in race and social justice initiatives in both the public and private sectors.\n\nJahi Bouvier, born and raised in Seattle with family ties to the Central District, is a visual artist and activist.
