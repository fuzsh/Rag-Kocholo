        "meta_description": "There are well-known tactics for persuading others, coauthor Robert Cialdini’s prominent among them. But when leaders need to prompt long-term behavioral change, these tactics need to be applied differently. Cialdini and his coauthor, a researcher of influence tactics, suggest three methods for delivering long-haul persuasion in a complex system that build on Cialdini’s earlier work: Offer compromises proactively, promote unity, and appoint a system steward. Importantly, all three approaches emphasize the agency and involvement of those on the receiving end.",
