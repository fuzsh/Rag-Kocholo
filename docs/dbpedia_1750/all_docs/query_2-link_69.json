        "text": "Third-term Tewksbury rep has background as legal services attorney\n\nTewksbury State Representative Tram T. Nguyen, left, accepted the Women’s Bar Association of Massachusetts (WBA) Emerging Women Leaders in the Law Award last week. Nguyen was honored alongside fellow recipients Julie Dick, Avana Epperson-Temple and Whitney Williams at the WBA annual gala on Oct. 16 at Marriott Copley Place in Boston.\n\nNguyen, who is in her third term serving the 18th Essex District that includes Andover, Boxford and North Andover along with Tewksbury, was nominated for the award last spring by her colleague, first term State Rep. Adrianne Ramos of North Andover.\n\n“I was honored to nominate my colleague, Rep. Tram Nguyen, for this award,” said Ramos. “Through her years of dedication to social justice and change from her time at Greater Boston Legal Services and now as a state representative, she has emerged as a leading and influential figure in every aspect. I am so excited to continue following her journey through the Legislature and in law.”\n\nNguyen was first elected into office in November 2018 and is the first Vietnamese American woman in elected office in the Commonwealth. In her career as a legal services attorney with Greater Boston Legal Services she represented domestic violence survivors, workers, seniors, veterans and children.\n\nAs Tewksbury’s rep, Nguyen has worked with colleagues Dave Robertson and Vanna Howard and Sen. Barry Finegold to return $21,296,623 in Chapter 70 funding, unrestricted local aid and funds earmarked for projects to Tewksbury, as well as $500,000 in State Hospital mitigation funding to be split two ways.\n\nCircuit breaker funding is expected to be higher than anticipated, in fact, with an additional $208,000 allocated to cover all private out-of-district day tuitions.\n\nNguyen has sponsored a number of bills, including H.76, protecting sensitive information from security breaches; H.644 to to protect vulnerable elders from abuse; and, with Howard, H.868 mandating further testing after combined sewage overflow events and H.1703 for legislation to protect animals from convicted animal abusers.\n\nNguyen thanked the WBA and Rep Ramos.\n\n“It is humbling to accept an award that celebrates the importance of women’s equality and uplifting other women to achieve success in the legal field,” she said. “Women supporting women is how we make positive change.”\n\nThe WBA was founded in 1978 by a group of activist women lawyers and is committed to women achieving full and equal participation in the legal profession and in society. Nguyen says she looks forward to continuing her advocacy to help create racial and economic justice for all Massachusetts residents.\n\n“This year’s group of Emerging Women Leaders is an exceptional group of women attorneys whose talent and accomplishments thus far in their careers are commendable,” said WBA President Jessica Babine. “I look forward to their continued good work and celebrating their contributions to the legal profession into the future.”"
