Journalist and former activist Kim Paul Nguyen goes on a journey through the heart of Australia’s coal country, meeting the most hardcore on both sides of a vicious national debate, to discover if there’s any possibility of finding common ground.

The impact of climate change has already hit Australia hard, with enormous bushfires in 2020 and devastating floods this year. But over the past two decades taking action on climate at a government level has been nearly impossible – with leader after leader toppled in what came to be known as Australia’s “climate wars”.

At the heart of this conflict is coal. As one of the country’s biggest exports, the industry still holds immense social, cultural and financial power over domestic politics.
