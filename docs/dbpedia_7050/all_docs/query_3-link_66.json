        "text": "2. Prof. Ferdinand Porsche chauffeured Archduke Franz Ferdinand in a Lohner-Porsche in 1902.\n\n3. In 1939 Prof. Ferdinand Porsche designed the Mercedes Benz Type 8 car to be the fastest car on earth with a projected top speed of 470 mph. Because of the political events at the time, the car never got to do its run.\n\n4. During WWI, Prof. Ferdinand Porsche designed heavy transport vehicles: flatbed trailers with the wheels powered by individual hub-motors.\n\n5. The very first 356\n\n(356 #1 - prototype) was\n\na mid-engined car.\n\nThe rest of the production\n\nhad a rear-engine layout.\n\n6. Beutler Carrosserie turned closed 356s into open ones – completing its first custom cabriolet in 1947, three years before Porsche came to America and a full seven years before the 356 Speedster was introduced.\n\n7. U.S. importer Max Hoffman displayed the first U.S. Porsches in his New York City showroom by late 1950.\n\n8. In 1952, US auto maker Studebaker contracted Porsche to develop a new car and engine.\n\n9. Hoffman conducted Porsche 356 test drives on Park Avenue, an accomplishment hat could not be proficiently duplicated today.\n\n10. Hoffman's Porsche dealer showroom was designed by famous Architect Frank Lloyd Wright. It is now a modern office building with a Mercedes-Benz dealer on the street level. Hoffman also contracted Wright to build his home in Rye, NY.\n\n11. In addition to importing the first Porsche models to the United States, MaxHoffman also raced Porsches. Several of Porsche's initial U.S. racing victories can be attributed to him.\n\n12. Hoffman is also credited for the birth of the Porsche Speedster, with the intention of producing a lower-cost Porsche to compete with the Austin Healey 100, Triumph TR-2 and MG models in the United States.\n\n13. In 1952, Hollywood dealer John von Neumann wanted to race a Porsche, so he ordered a 356 without paint or upholstery to modify it himself.\n\n14. The Porsche logo/crest\n\nwas designed in the USA\n\nin 1952 by Dr. Ferry Porsche on\n\nhis napkin as he sat opposite U.S.\n\nimporter Max Hoffman in a New\n\nYork restaurant.\n\n15. In the original 356 Speedster, a tachometer was not standard, nor were padded seats, sun visors or heaters.\n\n16. An exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1953 featured 10 automobiles, including a 1952 Porsche 1500 Super.\n\n17. The first Porsche to appear at the New York Auto Show was in 1954 and was called \"a snappy Porsche roadster.\"\n\n18. The Porsche Club of America was founded in 1955, only five years after Porsche was introduced to the United States.\n\n19. The word \"Continental\" appeared on the side of the 1955 Porsche Coupe and Cabriolet, but only in North America.\n\n20. The Porsche of America Corporation was founded in 1956, taking over national representation of the brand from Max Hoffman.\n\n21. The inaugural Porsche Parade took place in greater Washington D.C. on August 29, 1956.\n\n22. The first appearance of a\n\nPorsche at the historic\n\n12 Hours of Sebring\n\nendurance race was in\n\n1956, piloted by Hans\n\nHerrmann.\n\n23. One of the first U.S. Porsche brochures in the 1950s featured a pair of woman's gloves on the cover with a set of Porsche keys. The tagline read: \"The keys to miles of pleasure . . . \"\n\n24. British automotive weekly publication Autocar became the first outlet to test a Porsche in April 1956, a Porsche 356.\n\n25. The first Porsche series-produced roadster was aptly named the America Roadster for its intentional distribution entirely within the United States. It was completely unpublicized in Europe and only 16 models were ever built.\n\n26. The first vertical-drive German inline engine was displayed at the 1958 New York Auto Show along with several other \"firsts\", including the first diesel outboard motor.\n\n27. Jean Behra drove the first single-seat Porsche race car in the 1958 Formula 2 race at Rheims, France.\n\n28. The \"D\" in the 1959 \"Speedster D\" takes its name from the Drauz Factory of Heibronn.\n\n29. The 1950s Porsche airplane engine (based on the 356 1.6 L) could power a helicopter when mounted vertically.\n\n30. Rear seats, headlights, and higher bumpers were the prime accessories fitting a new Porsche in 1960. The starting price for one of these new models was a whopping $3,400.\n\n31. Porsche withdrew from the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance race in 1960 in protest over organizers requesting that the manufacturer use a particular brand of gasoline.\n\n32. Porsche's production of diesel tractors peaked in 1960/61 with 150,000.\n\n33. The first American citizen\n\nto win a Formula One\n\nChampionship victory at\n\na U.S. track while driving\n\na Porsche was Dan Gurney\n\nin 1961.\n\n34. Dan Gurney also won\n\nPorsche's first (and only)\n\nworld championship Grand\n\nPrix with a victory at Rouen,\n\nFrance in 1962.\n\n35. The 911 was originally the 901, until Peugeot informed Porsche of its trademark rights on cars named with a \"0\" between two numbers.\n\n36. At the end of its production in 1965, Porsche 356 models were being produced exclusively for the American market.\n\n37. 1966 was the first full production years for the 900 series Porsches and one-half was shipped to the United States, while one-quarter stayed in West Germany.\n\n38. The 907 prototype, developed in winter 1966/67, was the first Porsche to go faster than 300 km/hr (186 mph).\n\n39. In 1967, a Targa version of the popular-selling 911 model was introduced. It included a stainless-steel rollbar to provide a solution to suspicions that the United States would outlaw open-top convertibles.\n\n40. Porsche's 914/4 model was sold as the \"VW-Porsche\" in Europe but only had the Porsche crest in the United States.\n\n41. More than 100 dealerships marked the increasing popularity of Porsche models the United States by opening simultaneously on November 1, 1969.\n\n42. The 1970 Porsche 914 was initially ruled as unsafe for driving in the United States because it lacked proper side marker lights on its front end.\n\n43. The first twenty five (25) 917 racecars were called Secretary Cars because they were literally assembled by secretaries and anyone with a pulse at the factory. Porsche needed to build enough 917s in a short amount of time to satisfy the FIA homologation inspectors. They did it, and the rest is history.\n\n44. The first ever Porsche \"drivers' school\", a precursor to the current Porsche Sport Driving School, was conducted on May 29, 1971 at Mitchell Field, Long Island, NY.\n\n45. The 1975 Silver Anniversary limited edition was built in both coupe and Targa body form, painted in diamond-silver metallic and individually numbered.\n\n46. For the 1976 912E, \"E\" stands for Einspritzung, meaning \"fuel injection,\" because the car had Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection.\n\n47. The 924/944 water-cooled Porsche models were designed by an American, Tony Lapine.\n\n48. The first few Porsche 924 Turbos to come to the United States had black and white-checkered flag fabric on the seat inserts and door panels.\n\n49. Porsche partnered briefly with Indianapolis 500 racing in 1980 for the first time in its long motorsports history on the Formula One racing circuit.\n\n50. The Interscope Porsche, developed for racing in the Indianapolis 500 race in 1980, was originally unveiled at a press conference at Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York City.\n\n51. The enduring success of the 911\n\nmodel is owed to American CEO\n\nPeter Schut\\z, who in 1980, after\n\neeing the pr\\oposed end of\n\nproduction in 1981 on a chart,\n\nextended the line with a marker\n\nand told Helmuth Bott to \"make\n\nit happen.\"\n\n52. It is largely believed that Peter\n\nSchutz was selected as CEO\n\nof Porsche from 1981 to 1986\n\nbecause as an American, it was\n\nhoped that he would revive\n\ndwindling U.S. sales of the 911.\n\n53. The success at the 24 Hours of LeMans in 1981 is due to combining chassis from three 936 models with experimental engines developed for U.S. Indy Car racing.\n\n54. Porsche began promoting vacation delivery in 1982: order the car in the United States, take delivery in Europe, drive around the continent and return the car to the factory to have it shipped home.\n\n55. The Porsche 928 in the film Risky Business is actually a total of four cars ranging in years from 1979-1981. Each car had different options such as interior colors, wheel design s and even paint colors. The production crew had to be very careful about which part of the cars they filmed to make it look like only one vehicle was used in the movie.\n\n56. Al Holbert set a FIA international class speed record while driving a stock 928 S4 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1986. His speed: 171.110 mph.\n\n57. The 959 was the most technologically advanced supercar of its generation. A 200 mph, all wheel drive, turbo powered Porsche which won its class at the 24 hours of Le Mans and also won the overall first place in the grueling Paris to Dakar Rally. Because Porsche didn’t provide the USDOT with four 959s for crash testing, the car was never certified by the NHTSA for street use in the US. In 2001 with the passage of the “Show & Display”, the crash test requirements were removed and US imports of 959s were allowed.\n\n58. Porsche 911 engines were air-cooled for an astounding 34 years before switching to a water-cooled format in 1998 to meet increasingly stringent environmental rules and Porsche's desire to provide more power while reducing fuel consumption.\n\n59. In 1992 it took 125 hours to build a Porsche 911. By 1994 the factory was down to 80 hours, thus reducing the cost of the cars.\n\n60. The Porsche 911 RS entered the United States in 1993. The \"RS\" stands for \"Rennsport,\" German for \"race sport\" or racing. It had no sunroof, A/C, backseat or power steering.\n\n61. Porsche was the first auto manufacturer to make passenger air bags available, optional or standard.\n\n62. The names for both the 911 Carrera and the Panamera came from Mexico's historic Carrera Panamericana race, where Porsche scored many victories.\n\n63. Notable past and current American celebrities who are or were Porsche enthusiasts include James Dean, Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Ralph Lauren, Robert Redford, Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, and Patrick Dempsey.\n\n64. Only 1,270 units of the V10, 612HP Carrera GT were built between 2004 and 2006. 604 of them were sold in the USA. The original production run had been established at 1,500 units but new airbag regulations in the US killed the run a bit short.\n\n65. In 2013 Porsche established a record at the famed Nürburgring by setting the fastest lap ever by a production car (on street-legal tires) of 6:57:00, with the 918 Hybrid.\n\n66. The 800-volt technology used in the all electric 2020 Taycan was developed by Porsche for the 919 Hybrid Racecar.\n\n67. Porsche was the last major manufacturer to enter Formula-E (all electric formula cars). After 30 years Porsche has returned to single-seater racing.\n\n68. Porsche now offers a Club Sport Package for each one of its GT cars: GT2, GT3, and GT4.\n\n69. It is estimated that over 70% of all Porsches ever built are still running today.\n\n70. The correct pronunciation of Porsche is \"Porsch-eh.\""
