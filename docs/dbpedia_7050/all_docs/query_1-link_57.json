Or else you were looked at with strong suspicion. If you wanted to work for the regime membership was basically a requirement. The motor corps was a relatively benign organisation.\n\n__________________\n\n79 SC Targa\n\n72 T Targa Sold\n\n68 T Coupe Sold\n\n65 912 Coupe Sold\n\n62 356B Coupe Sold\n\nRETIRED\n\nJoin Date: Jul 1999\n\nLocation: BOULDER Colorado\n\nPosts: 39,417\n\nThe US brought over the rocket scientists that the Russians didn't steal.\n\nThe French put old Ferdie in jail.....the family had to pay a ransom to get him back. They started up in Austria because they couldn't get approval for a plant in Germany.....Ja....youse gots to have pemits, papers und approval......\n\nLooting and war prizes were common. Now in the PC world, you send back an armband you get court marshalled.\n\nJust a social commentary.\n\n__________________\n\n1983/3.6, backdate to long hood\n\n2012 ML350 3.0 Turbo Diesel\n\nReiver\n\nJoin Date: Nov 2011\n\nPosts: 54,707\n\nI don't believe Ferdie helped designed the B1 but did work on the production of that design and tooling efficiencies etc. Toward the end of the war (44 onward)the VW plant was almost totally involved with aircraft repair.\n\nSpeer assigned work forces (slave labor) but they operated their production lines with them.\n\nThe big designer mugs went to White Sands...great Museum there with the history of our German rocket boys.\n\nBTW, the German Air Force still sends the majority of its pilots to Holloman AFB. in New Mexico to train...the \"German Club\" on Ft. Bliss, Tx (actually the German mess for the German servicemen) had an excellent Oktober Fest every year. They'd fly in a German C 141 with fresh German beer and a big band, hot pretzels and cheese, wood cutting contest...felt like I was back in Germany."
