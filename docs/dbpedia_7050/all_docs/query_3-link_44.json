        "text": "Photos courtesy Porsche unless noted\n\nThis article originally appeared in the June 2024 Porsche Panorama\n\nMy first trip to Germany was an offer I couldn’t refuse: Drive nearly every generation of the 911 while touring Rhineland-Palatinate in the central-western part of the country. The area is probably best known to Americans for the Rhineland’s role preceding World War II and for the major U.S. Army offensive in early 1945. The scars of armed conflict are still present, if you look closely. Today, it is known more for its winemaking, forests, and abundance of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. You could call it the Napa Valley of Germany.\n\nBut you probably didn’t know that. I didn’t. And most of the Porsche employees who organized the trip also were experiencing the region for the first time. If there’s one thing I can say after my travels, it’s that Rhineland-Palatinate is certainly not flyover country, but it is a slower paced and rural complement to more well-known regions of Germany.\n\nSeveral 911s on the tour, plus the Cayenne and Sprinter chase and camera vehicles.\n\nThe shuttle to the Kloster Hornbach Hotel, the trip’s base of operations, was a pleasant two-hour ride on the autobahn from Frankfurt International, the scenery growing less industrial with every mile.\n\nThe town of Hornbach, one of many that dot the countryside, was founded as a monastery in the eighth century, with the Kloster Hornbach Hotel now at the town’s center. Narrow, hilly streets meander between apartments and townhouses. If I walked two miles south, I’d be standing at the border with France.\n\nThe Kloster Hornbach Hotel.\n\nYour author enjoys lunch with other colleagues on the trip.\n\nI wouldn’t be walking to France, but instead filming four of the seven Porsches I’d be driving over the next two days. I parked the cars in a courtyard and spent several hours taking in the scenery that framed my shots. Cobblestones, an old mansion, crumbling architecture adjacent to renovated townhouses, and a scattered line of bullet holes running up one of the church’s brick walls all were part of the environment.\n\nAll the Porsche 911s that we'd be driving, each from a different generation. Photo by Damon Lowney\n\nParked next to the church.\n\nThe Porsches lined up for us to drive were courtesy of the Porsche Museum. In this feature, I’ll give you driving impressions of the 996 Carrera 4 Cabriolet, 997.2 Targa 4S, and the 992 Carrera T, and you can find full video reviews of the 1971 911 S Targa, 1983 911 Carrera Cabriolet Turbo-look, 993 Turbo S, and 991 Carrera S 50th Anniversary on PCA’s YouTube channel or by visiting this page where they're all embedded.\n\n997.2 Targa 4S (foreground) and 996 Carrera Cabriolet. Photo by Damon Lowney\n\nAgain, this was my first trip to Germany. I’d visited Europe in 2007, and England for Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2022. I was a bit nervous driving here because my German is limited. Fortunately, there was always a Porsche-employed tour guide leading our procession, and a smartphone programmed with the day’s navigation.\n\nSo which car was I assigned to drive on German roads for the first time? A 993 Turbo S. Yeah. With a mix of horror and excitement, my driving partner and I swapped places after I rode shotgun for about an hour. The 3.6-liter flat six fired up and settled into a calm idle that betrayed the fury of 450 horsepower (Euro spec) and 398 lb-ft of twin-turbocharged torque. Some of the roads were too narrow to fully experience the Turbo S’s magic, and then there was the traffic, plus the fact this was one of just 345 cars built. But the vehicle was fun in spurts and kept me comfortable on the way to Hambach Castle.\n\n993 Turbo S.\n\nOur trip was officially called the Porsche Heritage Drive Experience. Since 2019, Alexander E. Klein, head of vehicle management at the Porsche Museum, has held these events for journalists to explore culture and tradition around the world. He was inspired by Blue Shield International and UNESCO’s missions to pre- serve and share cultural heritage. In 2023, Porsche decided to explore local culture in a nod to the company’s 75th anniversary.\n\n992 Carrera T, with Hambach Castle on the mountain in the background.\n\nAnd that’s why we were driving to Hambach Castle. During the late 1700s and early 1800s, the dominant forces of the German Confederation imposed censorship and mass surveillance upon citizens. From May 27 to May 30, 1832, in support of democracy and free speech, civilians held the Hambach Festival at the castle, an event disguised as a nonpolitical celebration. At the start of the event, the “Hambach Flag” with the inscription “Germany’s Rebirth,” was hoisted above the old castle ruins. The colors: Gold, red, and black. Democracy in Germany as it is today started here.\n\n996 Carrera Cabriolet.\n\nLeaving Hambach Castle, I drove a 996 Carrera 4 Cabriolet to our next destination. In this company of vehicles, the 996 felt the most ordinary behind the wheel. The interior doesn’t compare favorably to the 911s that came before and after, but it’s still nice. Driving position is excellent, the clutch was the easiest to operate, and the 3.4-liter flat six is a gem, providing more than adequate thrust, but not enough to overwhelm the average driver. It was easily the most appropriate car for a weekend drive in the sun.\n\nWeinessiggut Doktorenhof in Venningen is well worth a visit.\n\nOur next stop was a favorite: Weinessiggut Doktorenhof. The specialty: vinegar. Located southeast of Hambach Castle, in Venningen, Doktorenhof has been making vinegar for hundreds of years. To take a tour of the cellar and herb chamber, where artisan vinegar is made and fermented in dozens of barrels, we had to don dark, hooded robes. I avoided this due to camera equipment. It felt very cult-like, though it was clearly in good fun. The smell and humidity were overpowering. The 400-year-old bacteria, the “vinegar mother,” is prominently displayed in a massive jar next to the herb chamber. All vinegar made here has a little bit of the mother. The end results of the meticulous process are some of the best sipping drinks I’ve ever enjoyed. Who would have thought: vinegar for food and drink.\n\nHerb chamber.\n\nRobes must be worn during Weinessiggut Doktorenhof's tour.\n\nThe Vinegar Mother.\n\nFollowing Doktorenhof, it was time to drive the 997.2 Targa 4S with PDK. As a modern Targa, it’s easy to drive and relishes being driven hard. Compared with the 996, this 997.2 feels more cohesive, better built. The controls are equally as good and communicative, and the design of the interior and the materials used are an improvement. And they should be, as this car was produced about a decade after the very first 996s.\n\n997.2 Targa 4S.\n\nThe second day of driving first took us to a forest hut in the mountains behind Hambach Castle. This and more than 100 other huts in the region, linked by hiking paths, are run by volunteers and usually open to the public on weekends. Not ancient, but a well-established German tradition started more than 100 years ago. Hut guests can purchase refreshments and drinks served out of a dimpled glass. If you go hiking, and you should, be sure to do so in the vicinity of the hut network to take advantage of the services.\n\n911s parked in front of Speyer Cathedral.\n\nSpeyer Cathedral, on the eastern border of Rhineland-Palatinate, probably was meant to be the crown jewel of this experience, yet that accolade must be shared with Doktorenhof — it really was that good.\n\nApproaching the cathedral and looking up is dizzying, with the massiveness of its red sandstone only partly visible from the entrance. Portions of it have been rebuilt since it was first completed. Even I can appreciate the building’s claim to be the largest remaining Romanesque structure in the world. Inside the basilica, the vaulted ceiling stretches over three aisles before reaching a large dome. We were guided to the basement and crypt, then to the top of one of the towers.\n\nThe trip’s driving highlight, and my last stint, was in the 992 Carrera T. I pulled into line behind the 1983 911 Carrera Cabriolet Turbo-look (an early preproduction car ordered by then Porsche CEO Peter Schutz) and the tour leader in a Cayenne. Fortunately, both the Cayenne and Turbo-look drivers were willing and able to turn up the wick. We were all itching for this after a day of restrained driving.\n\nThe Carrera T sizzled as I snatched third from second using the standard seven-speed manual transmission, the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter flat six emitting its signature metallic wail from about 7000 rpm to the 7500 rpm redline. With a curb weight of about 3,250 pounds, the Carrera T flat six’s 379 horsepower is more than enough to require a judicious right foot — all 331 lb-ft hit from 1950-5000 rpm. Power oversteer is a thing.\n\nThe 992 Carrera T is great fun on a back road.\n\nFor 15 minutes, I was focused on the corners ahead. Engine screaming, chassis bending, corner digging. The T had a near-GT3 level of precision over throttle, steering, and brakes that helps blur the line between risk and reward. It was brilliant, transforming a great drive into a lasting memory.\n\nI’d recommend any of the places and experiences mentioned in the article, yet it represents just a small portion of things to do in Rhineland-Palatinate. Remember: The Napa Valley of Germany. And if you can do it behind the wheel of a Porsche, all the better.\n\nClick here to read about how Porsche eFuels powered these Porsches and the tech behind producing it.\n\nWant to receive more great Porsche content?\n\nSubscribe to e-Brake News\n\nPorsche Club of America's weekly newsletter.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n» One show you need to see: Techno Classica Essen\n\n» Spectacular roads and destinations defined Treffen Georgia Mountains\n\n» Techno Classica Essen: The show you've never heard of yet need to attend\n\n» Porsche starts two eBike companies 129 years after Ferdinand Porsche built his first\n\n» Porsche celebrates founding of first Porsche club in Germany 70 years ago"
