        "text": "Ferdinand Porsche, creator of the German sports car that bore his family name and son of the legendary engineer who designed the Volkswagen Beetle, died yesterday at his family's vacation home in the Austrian resort town of Zell am See. He was 88.\n\nMr. Porsche, known as Ferry, and his father, also named Ferdinand, were symbols of the ambitious breed of German industrialists who thrived under the Nazis and then rose phoenix-like from the ashes of wartime defeat. A younger generation fought so much among themselves, however, that the family's sports car company stumbled badly. But Mr. Porsche lived just long enough to see his business regain financial health.\n\nPorsche A. G., founded by Ferry's father, who was a close friend of Adolf Hitler, grew rich on military contracts until Allied bombs obliterated the factories that turned out its designs. In the aftermath of World War II, Ferry Porsche decided to defy conventional wisdom and build a luxury sports car in a nation so prostrated that its inhabitants could barely afford motorcycles. Within a few years, his sports car reached the pinnacle of the automotive trade, and has remained there in the eyes of many discerning critics.\n\nWith recognition came immense wealth: The Porsche family fortune is estimated at more than $3 billion. But sibling rivalry flared among the third generation of Porsches. Their business feuds and extramarital affairs earned them a reputation in the tabloid press as the ''Ewings of Germany.'' Their bickering grew so intolerable that Ferry Porsche, who had become the company's supervisory board chairman, expelled them from management of the family company.\n\nThe outsiders he brought in to run the company have achieved a mixed record over the last couple of decades. But contrary to rumors from time to time that it would be sold, Porsche has remained the only major independent sports-car maker in the world.\n\nFerry Porsche (pronounced PORSH-ah, never PORSH) was born on Sept. 19, 1909, in Wiener-Neustadt, Austria. After World War I, the Porsches moved permanently to Stuttgart, where his father was appointed chief engineer of Daimler-Benz, manufacturer of the Mercedes cars. Before learning to ride a bicycle, Ferry already had his first automobile accident. While sitting on his father's lap behind the wheel of a car, he drove it into a wall.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
