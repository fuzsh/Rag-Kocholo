        "text": "Luxury automaker Porsche has revealed the first car designed by its founder was electric, in a show at its museum in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, Germany.\n\nFerdinand Porsche's design was dubbed the Egger-Lohner electric vehicle C.2 Phaeton model, or the P1 for short.\n\nThe car, made in 1898, was recently unearthed in an Austrian garage, external, where it had been stored since 1902.\n\nThe 22-year-old Ferdinand Porsche, who would start Porsche in 1931, designed the P1 for carmaker Jacob Lohner.\n\nAfter a trip to the US, Ludwig Lohner, the owner of that firm, became convinced that the age of the horse and carriage was ending, and he asked Ferdinand Porsche to come up with an electric drive train.\n\nFerdinand Porsche designed an \"octagonal electric motor\" that was powered by electric batteries and suspended amidst shock absorbers in the rear of the vehicle.\n\nUsing a complicated series of gears, the car was driven using a 12-speed controller, which had six forward gears, two reverse gears and four gears with which to brake the car.\n\nThe P1 took to the streets of Vienna, Austria, on 26 June 1898.\n\nThe P1 could reach speeds of up to 21mph (34km/h) and travel up to 49 miles on a single charge.\n\nThe car could be styled as an open-air chassis or a coupe."
