        "text": "Ben: It's definitely por-shuh.\n\nDoug: Por-shuh.\n\nBen: Por-shuh.\n\nDoug: Yeah. Definitely don't say porsh.\n\nBen: Definitely don't say porsh.\n\nDoug: I met one of them at one point. They say not like por-shah, but more like por-shuh. I think it's a German thing, so we all say por-shuh.\n\nBen: If you say Porsche with a German accent, it comes out like por-shuh?\n\nDoug: Yeah. That's probably exactly what it is.\n\nBen: Welcome to season 12, episode 6 of Acquired, the podcast about great technology companies, and the stories and playbooks behind them. I'm Ben Gilbert.\n\nDavid: I'm David Rosenthal.\n\nBen: We are your hosts. Today, we tell the story of Porsche. If you liked our LVMH episode, you are going to love this one. Not just because it's a European luxury brand, there is possibly even more family drama, creeping takeovers, and complex corporate structures at play.\n\nWhy is Porscheâthe brand and the productâso special? The company has struck an incredible balance of both building some of the world's finest supercars while also being a great daily driver, unlike (say) a Ferrari or a Lamborghini. Of course, these are expensive daily drivers with the average Porsche costing $110,000, but they have managed to nail being a prestige brand with pricing power and make a ton of cars at 350,000 per year.\n\nToday, we'll study how they cultivated such a vibrant community, which conveniently for them is comprised of extremely wealthy people. But it has not always been this way, and it certainly didn't start this way. Today's story has Nazis, tanks, the first electric vehicles, and like most luxury brands, some misadventures in the 1980s.\n\nDavid: Oh yes.\n\nBen: If you like quirks and features, you're going to be pumped about our partner in crime to help us tell this story, Doug DeMuro. Doug is one of David and I's favorite YouTubers and content entrepreneurs. He operates the largest independent YouTube channel focused on car reviews with millions of subscribers.\n\nHe also used to work at Porsche corporate, and is about as big of an enthusiast of the brand as you'll find anywhere. In fact, we are filming this episode now sitting in his garage in front of a very special Porsche, Doug's Carrera GT. Welcome to Acquired, Doug.\n\nDoug: Thank you for having me.\n\nBen: It's wonderful to have you here. Listeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, sign up for email updates at acquired.fm. Join the Slack. We'll be talking about it after this episode, acquired.fm/slack.\n\nWithout further ado, David, take us in. Listeners, this is not investment advice, David and I and Doug may have investments in the companies we discussed. This show is for informational and entertainment purposes only.\n\nDavid: To set the stage a little bit, I think that even though it's a marketing phrase...\n\nDoug: The German engineering thing.\n\nDavid: It's worth sharing a little bit of history because it is more than just a marketing phrase. There's a pretty long and incredible history of science and engineering in Germany and Austria. It goes all the way back to the scientific revolution and Johannes Kepler.\n\nActually, before World War II, Germany had produced more Nobel laureates in scientific fields than any other nation in the world. Folks like Max Planck, Erwin Schrodinger, Kurt Godel, and Albert Einstein. These are all German and Austrian scientists.\n\nThis tradition extends also, of course, to the auto industry. It is very likely that the first gas-powered transportation vehicleâthis was looked more like a tricycle than a car, but predecessor of a carâwas created by a German inventor in 1864 named Siegfried Marcus.\n\nI say probably, because nobody really knows, because Marcus was Jewish, and the Nazis destroyed all records related to him during the war; we're going to talk a lot about the Nazis here in a minute. Either way, though, Germany definitely did create the first successful production consumer automobile. It was a vehicle called the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. That was made in 1885 by Carl Benz.\n\nBen: I recognize that name, Benz.\n\nDavid: Indeed, you probably do, as most listeners. Around the same time, another German inventor named Gottlieb Daimler sets up his own motor company. In the early 1900s, they have a model that they're producing. It goes on to be quite popular. It's named after the daughter of one of their biggest dealers in their dealer network. Of course, we are talking about Mercedes. I have no idea that's where the Mercedes name came from.\n\nBen: Neither did I.\n\nDavid: Yeah, crazy. Benz and Daimler ended up merging in 1924, and thus Mercedes-Benz is born. You might be asking, what does this have to do with Porsche. It turns out quite a lot because in 1906, Daimler scores a pretty big win in this fledgling German auto industry when they recruit the current Potting prize winnerâthe Potting prize was for Austria's automotive engineer of the yearâto come be their new Chief Engineer at Daimler, one Dr. Ing. h.c. Ferdinand Porsche.\n\nThe whole doctor, engineer, honoris causa thing, is a bit of a red herring, although Porsche, the person and the company, would make quite a big deal about it. The dude never even finished college, let alone got a PhD. It was an honorary degree that he got later in life.\n\nBen: Wait, the Dr. Porsche is doctor like the Seuss doctor?\n\nDavid: He had an honorary doctorate.\n\nDoug: He was already doing stuff that he was engineering and creating, hence the honorary doctorate.\n\nDavid: Yes. Nonetheless, he definitely was a badass engineer. We're going to talk about all of the amazing things that this guy creates, but we also got to state this upfrontâthis is as good place as anyâFerdinand Porsche and many other folks in the family and in the early Porsche and Volkswagen (as we will see) days, were also huge Nazis.\n\nFerdinand himself, not just was a Nazi, but was a very close personal associate of Adolf Hitler. He was a member of the SS. We're going to glorify him and many of these other folks here of their business and engineering contributions, but that doesn't mean that these are good people, so keep that in mind.\n\nBen: Yeah. This isn't like one of those people that you hear, oh, well, at that point in time, the Nazis were so big and powerful, they just got course, or they collaborated. It's like, no, this dude was [...]. Real big Nazi.\n\nDavid: Yeah, he was definitely a Nazi. When Ferdinand takes this new post as the head of engineering at Daimler, he moves his family from Austria where he was the Potting prize winner, to Stuttgart in Germany. Doug, you probably have some more context on this, but Stuttgart is basically the Detroit of the German auto industry.\n\nDoug: And it certainly has become more that way since Porsche as we'll get to because Mercedes-Benz is there, and it really does feel like a manufacturing cradle especially for cars.\n\nDavid: I think it's not even much like Detroit. It's not even just the car companies, but all the suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nDoug: Everybody you meet in Stuttgart, just like when you go to Detroit, works for Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, a supplier, or something like that.\n\nDavid: It is the industry town.\n\nDoug: Yeah.\n\nDavid: Porsche, Ferdinand, it's not a short period of time. It's two decades that he is running the engineering and the car design for Mercedes-Benz. While he's there, towards the end of his time as we're getting into the lead up to World War II, he comes up with a concept. He thinks that he can produce a small, affordable car that can really become the first German and European mass-market automobile.\n\nBack in the US, there was the Model T and Henry Ford. That existed, but Ferdinand's vision is a small car. The Model T was a large car, like a modern, small automobile that Germans everywhere can buy.\n\nDoug: Which was important because in Germany in that time, car ownership was not anywhere near as big as it was in the United States. Apparently, only 2% of Germans owned a car versus 30% of Americans by the 1930s, so mobilizing Germans was not something that had happened en masse at that point.\n\nDavid: This really was a challenge to build a car that could be affordable enough for the average German person to buy it. Indeed, it was a challenge because the board of Daimler Benz rejects it. They're like, no, we can't do this. We make expensive cars for wealthy people.\n\nThey get into a huge fight over this, and Ferdinand ends up leaving the company pretty acrimoniously in 1929. Doug, you worked at Porsche, you have content. I think to this day, the rivalry between Mercedes-Benz and Porsche has some bad blood there.\n\nDoug: It heats up and it cools down. There's more to discuss in that in the future for sure, but they ultimately do share that town, too. There's rivalry, but you'll have beers with them. You can't avoid hanging out with Mercedes-Benz's employees also.\n\nDavid: Love it. Once he leaves, Ferdinand bumps around for a little while. In 1931, he starts a consulting firm to advise other car companies, not Daimler Benz, but other car companies in Germany, Europe, and I think in America, too, on their designs, do some work for them, and maybe even design cars for them. He names it the Dr. Ing. h.c. Ferdinand Porsche Konstruktionen und Beratungen fur Motoren und Fahzeugbau. I apologize to any German speakers out there.\n\nDoug: To be fair to you, it's a lot.\n\nDavid: It's a mouthful, I studied French in college. That translates as The Dr. Ing. h.c. Ferdinand Porsche Consulting and Design Services for Motor Vehicles company. This is the beginning of Porsche the company. Up until 2008 and 2009, which we will get to much later in the episode, that is the company that makes Porsches. Wow.\n\nBen: If you look up the stock of Porsche, and you pick the right Porsche, and there's a couple we'll talk about, that's still the full name of the company, all of his honorary things.\n\nDavid: When he's starting this new company, he enlists the financial support of two people. One is his son-in-law, his daughter Louise's husband, one Anton Piech. Remember that last name because it is also going to be very important as we go along here. The other person is Adolf Rosenberger.\n\nIf you are a Porsche history nut, you probably know about Anton Piech. You probably don't know about Adolf Rosenberger because shortly after they start the company, Rosenberger was Jewish, and he gets arrested by the Gestapo. He gets imprisoned. He eventually bribes his way out and escapes to America. But during the war, Porsche and the Nazis totally appropriate his stake in Porsche, and he's written out of history.\n\nBen: Wow.\n\nDavid: This new Ferdinand company, in 1934, they land one very, very, very large contract that would go down in history both for the company and the world. That contract would be to design Ferdinand's vision, the small, affordable car for the people, a Volkswagen, you might say in German. That car would go on to become the Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nThe company that contracted Porsche to build and design it was Volkswagen, which was established to do so by Adolf Hitler. I had heard rumors over the years like oh, yeah, there's a Nazi connection here, like Adolf Hitler founded Volkswagen.\n\nDoug: It's bigger than a connection.\n\nDavid: There's not a connection because it's the same person.\n\nDoug: Right, it's the thing.\n\nBen: Facebook, I feel like that has some Zuckerberg Association, but I've never really put it together.\n\nDavid: Yeah, there's some link between Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.\n\nBen: I just got to say, this early in the episode, we may as well like pointed out already, it is crazy how comfortable we all are driving Volkswagens and Porsches when it was not just a little Nazi-affiliated, like founded by Nazis, and yet the way the world has evolved, people became okay with it.\n\nDoug: All the German brands. Most of them used Jewish labor in their factories at that time. Obviously, very different people run the businesses now, so you just put it out of your mind.\n\nDavid: Generations have gone by, also less so on the Porsche side of things, more so on the Volkswagen side of things, as we'll see with the history here. There is a pretty incredible refounding of Volkswagen after the war. I think if it were not for this refounding that we'll talk about in a minute, it would not exist today. It's just wild, freaking Adolf Hitler founded Volkswagen.\n\nBen: It's crazy. The Beetle, this people's carâDoug, you might know thisâdid it go on to become the most popular car ever in the entire world?\n\nDoug: Probably.\n\nDavid: Yes. It is very hard to get actual production and sales data, especially for old cars.\n\nDoug: Especially for cars like the Beetle, which were produced in many countries over many years. They were building them in Latin America through a couple of years ago, maybe 2003 or something, so it's difficult to figure out. But obviously, whether or not it was the most or one of the most, obviously, the effect of that car is clear today.\n\nDavid: I tried to think. I could not think of any other model, I believe the original Beetle is likely the single longest-produced and largest both in terms of length of time and number of units produced of a single generation model of car. The Civic, the Mustang, the F-150, definitely sold more than the Beetle, but those aren't the same cars. The Beetle was the same freaking car until the New Beetle in 1990.\n\nDoug: It's interesting when you think about the Beetle because young people today look at it as a cute, classic car. But at the time, it was what you drove to drive your family around. We'll talk more as we get to postwar. But in Germany at the time, it's a real, important, practical family car.\n\nDavid: This original Volkswagen, the Hitler Volkswagen, one of the things you can do when you start a company as a fascist dictator, you can create a new city to house this company in, which he did. Hitler creates a new city in Germany known as the then called, the city of the strength through joy car. That was what they wanted to call the Beetle, originally.\n\nDoug: The strength through joy car.\n\nDavid: That was like a Nazi phrase like the joy.\n\nBen: It didn't get much more German than that.\n\nDavid: Yeah. This is Wolfsburg. This is the city that Volkswagen is still located in today. Hitler created it.\n\nBen: Not just Volkswagen, but the Volkswagen Group, one of the largest car conglomerates in the world that owns many other brands weâre familiar with, all out of Wolfsburg.\n\nDavid: All out of Wolfsburg. Hitler creates Volkswagen, he creates Wolfsburg. They do start production of the Beetle before World War II starts. They only make about 200 units. These are super rare today if you find a pre-war Beatle. Then World War II begins on September 1st, 1939. As you would expect, all the Volkswagen and Porsche operations get repurposed to making military vehicles.\n\nThere's a bunch of dark stuff. Everything, Doug, you mentioned earlier, forced labor, concentration camps, was the Nazi war effort. It all happened. We're going to skip over this period for our purposes today, but note, it happened.\n\nAfter the war, though, a whole bunch of really interesting stuff happens that basically fractures and separates out the Volkswagen operations from the Porsche operations for the rest of the century and into the 21st century. It's so ironic, given that they are now one company again.\n\nBen: Where are they?\n\nDavid: Where are they? That's the question.\n\nDoug: The funny thing is also, they danced around. Even in this period, then in the decades after that, and then of course now, they were always flirting with each other.\n\nDavid: Yes. First on the Volkswagen side, I alluded to this a minute ago, it's a pretty amazing story, what happened. You would think there's no way. You can't imagine that Volkswagen would survive postâWorld War II, given what we now know, the origin of the company.\n\nWhat happens is Wolfsburg ends up in the hands of the British at the end of the war. There's this whole crazy thing in Germany, like all the allied armies are coming in, and literally, Germany and Berlin ends up getting split into East Germany, West Germany, East Berlin, West Berlin. Wolfsburg is in the hands of the British.\n\nRemember, because it was a political organization, it wasn't a company before the war, nobody owns it. It's this orphaned organization. It's super unclear. There's no proprietorship of it.\n\nThe initial plan that the British come up with, they were going to dismantle the factory, ship it over to Britain, and essentially have Britain appropriate the Volkswagen technology and operations. The Beatle was almost a British car.\n\nDoug: But supposedly, the British didn't want. The British saw the plans for Volkswagen for the Beetle and said, no one's going to ever want to buy that car. It's crazy to think about now. It gives you an idea of how the British would operate their car industry, which is constant missed opportunities. They literally looked at the models that they had built, and they said, nah. They literally said it is not commercially viable.\n\nDavid: Wow. The British government lacked vision for this. But a singular British person did see the vision for this, and that is the officer who was in charge of the territory where the factories were on the ground managing it. Major Ivan Hirst, a legendary figure in Volkswagen history.\n\nHe finds one of the pre war production Beetles, the 200 that were made. He starts driving it around, and he's like, hey, this thing's actually pretty good. I think we can maybe do something with this here. He also sees, and this becomes increasingly obvious as the postâWorld War II state of world affairs takes place here in Germany like the Cold War is about to start. He realizes that West Germany needs an economic revitalization here. We need to restart German industry because the iron curtain is falling just to the east here.\n\nHe amazingly proposes and convinces the British command to leave the factory in Wolfsburg, maybe easier than I thought, because the British didn't want it apparently. And also to place an initial seed order to restart the company for 20,000 Beetles that the British military is going to adopt and use as their main military transport. Not as a tank, not an armored Beetle, but they're going to use it to drive officers and stuff around. From that seed order, that is now the new Volkswagen. Yes, Hitler started it, but then Ivan Hirst really started it.\n\nDoug: Totally. One of the things that I find interesting about the Beetle is that Europe was so war torn after World War II, all these places. We're in similar situations to Germany. The people needed to get back to work, they needed to be able to drive and go places, and each European country had their own Beetle. UK had the mini, Italy had the Fiat 500, France had the Citroen 2CV. They all look similar.\n\nBen: Wait, these are all based on the Beetle?\n\nDoug: No, but they all came from the post-war era, where they needed something small and cheap to remobilize the citizenry, basically. Each country developed had their own car that did that for each country. But in Germany, of course, the Beetle became a global hit, whereas in those countries, it was more in their era.\n\nDavid: Yeah, you don't see a lot of Citroens.\n\nDoug: Yeah, but the 2CV was a huge, huge car. The French, just like the Germans, needed to get back to work, needed to start building stuff again, and also needed a cheap car to cruise around it.\n\nDavid: Yeah, super interesting. That's Volkswagen. Put a pin in them. We'll come back to them in about 50 years because there's a lot more to say on Volkswagen.\n\nBen: That's about how long they would make that one model of the Beetle.\n\nDavid: Yes. The New Beetle would get introduced, I think, in 1998. The first ones post-war were made in 1940, so yeah.\n\nBen: Crazy.\n\nDavid: Crazy. Isn't that wild?\n\nDoug: It's insane.\n\nDavid: What about Porsche? They have a bit of a different path. After the warâ\n\nBen: We should say, during the war, Ferdinand Porsche was designing tanks and other military transport.\n\nDavid: He designed the Elephant anti-tank tank, the most powerful land-based tank ever created. (a) Terrible, but (b) just the range of design talent that he had, he designed the Beetle, and he designed the largest anti-tank tank ever created.\n\nDoug: Within a couple of years.\n\nDavid: Yeah.\n\nBen: And also, some of the very first hybrid and electric cars in history. But at that time, battery technology wasn't advanced enough, so you're lugging around this huge weighted battery pack to get almost no juice out of it, so it didn't really go into production.\n\nDavid: He was a genius. This also runs in the family, too. Many of his descendants are both engines and cars geniuses. After the war, Ferdinand and the son-in-law, Anton Piech, are both arrested by the French as war criminals. Tried in France, they ended up being imprisoned for two years in France. Ben, you did a little research on this, right?\n\nBen: Yeah. I think the technical thing they got them on, which is why they only had two years, was for the forced labor that they took the imprisoned Jews and forced them to work in the factories. But all the other war crimes that were stacked against them ended up not being charged, so quick trip in and out of war criminal prison.\n\nDavid: Ferdinand' son, Ferry Porsche, who had been working in the business I think a little bit before the war and then during the war, too, was also arrested for war crimes too at the end of the war. He gets released after six months in the summer of 1946. He and his sister Louise are like, what are we going to do? We got to rebuild the family. Are we going to restart the business? Let's go figure things out.\n\nThey return to the family's ancestral home in Austria. That happens to be quite convenient because during the last days of the war, as Stuttgart and other large scale German military production facilities were getting bombed by the Allies, Porsche took about 20 or so of the best, most talented engineers and production people that they had, they move them out of Stuttgart, and they moved them to the Austrian countryside so that they wouldn't be targeted, so that the Allied bombers wouldn't know where they are.\n\nThis is pretty crazy. They are literally operating out of a sawmill in a farming village in southern Austria named Gmund. We're talking about a couple of thousand people maybe that live in this area.\n\nBen: David, I know you read $500 worth of textbooks on Porsche.\n\nDavid: There is this incredible history of Porsche called Excellence Was Expected that was written by Karl Ludvigsen. We have to owe a big thank you to him for the research for this episode. The photos, the archive work that are in this volume, is incredible.\n\nBen: I read a coffee table book that was the complete illustrated history of the 911. For this episode and this topic, you want a visual history. It's not like there are audiobooks and Kindle books that we could do our normal amount of research on. All this stuff is in these huge, heavy bound pictorial books.\n\nDavid: These are amazing objects that are being produced. There's just such a visceral tangible quality to them that we don't usually cover on Acquired.\n\nFerry and Louise go back to Austria. They're there in Gmund. They're like, well, what if we start a new company and see what we can do around here? There are some vehicles we can start fixing up.\n\nThis is literally like the Sony story. If you remember when Sony first got started in Tokyo at literally the same time, they started by fixing radios. The second Porsche company, Porsche Konstruktionen GmbH, which is an Austrian company that they start to do this, start up fixing old military vehicles that are around there in Austria. Unlike Sony in Tokyo, though, where there were a lot of radios in Tokyo, there weren't a lot of cars in Gmund. Pretty quickly, they're like, ah, we don't have any more cars to fix off.\n\nBen: Bad business.\n\nDavid: Yeah, about not a large market, shall we say. At this point, Ferry has an idea, and it turns out it's a pretty damn good one. He definitely liked and agreed with his father's vision for a small car, car for the masses, a Volkswagen. But he always had one major problem with the Beetle, which was that it was slow, and it just was not fun to drive.\n\nDuring the war, he actually had a custom Beetle made that he drove during the war with a supercharged engine. Ferry said later in a 1972 interview, I saw that if you had enough power in a small car, it is nicer to drive than if you have a big car, which is also overpowered, and it is more fun. On this basic idea, we started the first Porsche prototype to make the car lighter and to have an engine with more horsepower.\n\nBen: Doug, can you contextualize what a big moment in world history this is?\n\nDoug: It's an interesting concept because sports cars in general weren't a thing that much. There's going to be people around and say, no, there were a lot of sports cars before. But it was really a thing of real enthusiast, wealthy people, that sort of thing, would buy cars to go motor racing in the era of brass era and that kind of stuff. The concept of creating something more affordable, littler that was still fun, was an interesting idea that it was a touchstone of a concept that has really been taken, obviously, by them and refined and others as well.\n\nDavid: In research, when I looked up some of those sports cars pre-Porsche, you look at them and things are Franken-cars. They are huge. The engine bays in the front of the cars are two thirds of the length of the car. There's this one Ferrari from that era, and I'm like, how do you even steer this thing? It looks like a boat.\n\nDoug: The thought at the time really was, you want to go faster, more. More power, which of course creates more weight, which of course creates the need for more power. They did that, but it was unwieldy.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Even to this type, a Carrera GT sitting behind us, that's not a large car.\n\nDoug: Right, and that was a Porsche thing. It was an even more of a Porsche thing at this time.\n\nDavid: Totally.\n\nBen: David, you said a word there that if people aren't into cars, they may not know this supercharge. Doug, what does it mean to supercharge a car?\n\nDoug: Basically, an engine takes in air. Air mixes with the fuel and it creates a combustion. More or less, that's how a combustion engine works. Supercharge pushes in even more air to create more power, basically. The term supercharged would be referring to like, it takes the same engine, but adds this thing to force more power through.\n\nDavid: It literally force more air in.\n\nDoug: Yeah.\n\nDavid: I don't think turbos have been invented yet. Turbos would obviously become a big thing for Porsches much later.\n\nDoug: The concept of turbos is actually fairly similar to supercharging, except that it spins something that adds even more air basically. Thus, turbochargers result in power being produced. As the car makes more power, it makes more power, if that makes any sense. It spins itself up in a faster way. There are pros or cons to either of them.\n\nBen: For those following along at home, this is end of the 40s, 1947 type era.\n\nDavid: Yeah, those couple of years after the war, when everything was getting figured out. Ferry has this idea. He's like, oh, I like driving my supercharged beetle, this is really fun. They have a small car that also had a lot of power in it. What if we take this small operation of our elite team here in Gmund and try and build a car that does that? It also turns out that we built the Beetle, so we know how to work with the Beetle.\n\nThere are a bunch of Beetle parts around. The Beetle was the main chassis platform for a lot of military vehicles for Germany during the war. What if we take a lot of those parts and the basic architecture of the Beetle, which is a rear-mounted, air-cooled engine on a small car, and we try and put something together here? This becomes the legendary Porsche 356.\n\nFor some context on this, you can buy an old Beetle today for $10,000â$15,000 at auction, even a classic one from the 50s or 60s. 356s regularly sell for about $300,000 at auction, and special ones go for well, well, well above a million. This is a big idea. The gulf between a Beetle and a 356 is large.\n\nBen: Doug, why is the desirability of these cars so different today?\n\nDoug: Production numbers are probably the biggest component of that one. They made literally a zillion Beetles. The 356 is special because it really was one of the real touchstone moments of the sports car coming out of the war, how we define this sports car today. It was a special thing, a special time, and a special moment. And a lot of them also weren't treated all that well.\n\nUltimately, the 356 was not affordable, but they made a decent number of them. They got to be relatively cheap. It was the old used Porsche for a while in the 60s and 70s, so not that many of them were saved. Now it's revered as, when we look back, this major moment in Porsche history.\n\nDavid: Yeah, this was another thing. Obviously, in Gmund and then even when Porsche moves back to Stuttgart here in a minute, their production capability is not nearly as large as Volkswagen, so they need to price these things pretty high. They priced them at the German equivalent of $3750 in the late 40s. That's about $42,000 today. But we're talking about war-torn Europe that you're trying to sell this. That's a lot of money.\n\nHere's the crazy thing. There's a market for that, even in war-torn Europe for a $40,000 sports car. There are enough people who, it turns out, are interested enough in various vision for a small, fun, fast sports car.\n\nDoug: Initially, it was slow. It took them a while. The first couple of years, they only made a couple hundred of them or something like that. It was initially pretty slow, but then things started to kick around. People in Germany started to get some money, and things started to take off.\n\nIt may be worth pointing out also in the context of the sports car. The 356 coming out of World War II was the beginning of the sports car really taking off. Like I mentioned before, the earlier ones were these big giant things that were only operated by enthusiast who know how to work them. But in post-World War II, there was a lot of optimism.\n\nIn Britain, it was happening to MG who was coming out with their sports cars, Austin-Healey, Jaguar. These cars all were born from this postwar period of like, hey, these cars had been refined to the point where we can use them, drive them, and enjoy them. That really became a thing. And in Germany, it was the 356.\n\nDavid: That takes us to the late 40s here. They're starting to produce the 356 in Gmund. At the end of 1947, Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Piech got released from French prison. They come back to Austria, the family is all together, and they got to decide what to do here.\n\nRight around that same time, Volkswagen is getting back up and running. Hirst is running it. It's the vision they're going to make the beetle for Germany and for the world. They come back to the Porsches, and they say, hey, we still want to do business with you. In fact, we actually want to expand the scope of our business with you guys, even more than it was before the war because we could still really use technical design, consulting work, and really leadership from you individual Porsches here at Volkswagen. After all, you designed the beetle.\n\nToo, though, we're not a government organization in the same way anymore. We need distribution. You guys have this new Austrian Porsche company that you've set up. How about this?\n\nThey propose two things. They say, let's reinstate that old German Porsche company, the doctor, engineer, honoris causa, blah-blah-blah. We'll recreate the German Porsche company. It'll resume doing the technical design and consulting work for us here at Volkswagen. In return, they give that German Porsche company literally the sweetheart deal of a lifetime, a royalty on every Beetle sold worldwide.\n\nBen: No way.\n\nDavid: Yes. This is how intertwined these two companies are.\n\nBen: The deal is, we want your Austrian company to distribute our Volkswagens. In order to coerce you to doing that, we also want the consulting work.\n\nDavid: Ben, you're on the right track. This is a hell of a sweetheart deal for the Porsche family. You are right to be saying, why would the German government do this?\n\nBen: Do you know what kind of royalty?\n\nDavid: It was enough that it was very meaningful cash flow and source.\n\nDoug: Probably at the time, not even clear just how right amazing it would be.\n\nDavid: Right. Nobody knew that the Beetle was going to become the international hit that it would, but the German government did know that this was a lot of value. They also may or may not have known that, on the Austrian Porsche side for the dealership distribution side, that was also a lot of value. We're not going to talk as much about the Austrian operations of Porsche for the rest of the episode, but it becomes a huge business.\n\nBy the time in the early 2000s, when it all gets consolidated back into one company, for most of the two separate histories, that was the larger company by revenue. The Austrian Porsche company becomes the largest car dealer network in Europe, not just for Volkswagens, but for all types of automotive brands. They're doing billions of annual revenue within a few years here.\n\nDoug: What an opportunity to be given a distribution network just as the car is starting to become a big thing.\n\nDavid: Exclusive distribution rights to Volkswagens.\n\nBen: And they're in countries, not just in Austria. They're all over the place.\n\nDavid: Yeah, they're all over the place in Europe. Even more incredibly, what the family decides is that Ferdinand and Ferry, the original Ferdinand and his son, Ferry, are going to be back to Stuttgart and retake over the German operations of Porsche, Louise and Anton, the son-in-law, they're going to stay in Austria and run this dealership business. Anton dies in 1952, and Louise is the one who builds this business. Louise and her children turned that into the largest car dealer network in Europe.\n\nBen: Doug, the way the value chain evolved for selling cars, there's this very clear delineation in the US, at least, until Tesla of separating the dealership from the manufacturer. There is no direct-to-consumer. Was that already obvious at this point in history when Porsche has these two different companies?\n\nDoug: It's an interesting question. I suspect the answer is more or less. In some brands, I bet they were selling direct-to-consumer, and some I bet they weren't, some of the smaller ones maybe. I suspect the reason this worked out is because these companies didn't want to be the ones who were distributing all these cars across and doing all this. They were focused on manufacturing.\n\nDavid: I think there also might have been a technical reason, which is, even though this new Volkswagen was reconstituted as a company, it's only shareholders at this point in time who were the German government. So both the national West German state and the state of Lower Saxony within West Germany, which still to this day holds 20% of Volkswagen, which is crazy. They would IPO Volkswagen (I believe) in 1960 or 1961. Even though it was a company, it was a German national company to operate in other states, other countries in Europe. They probably needed third parties. Wild, right?\n\nAll right, listeners. For our first sponsor of this episode, we have our good friends at Tiny. Tiny, as you all know by now, is the Berkshire Hathaway of the Internet. They have built and acquired the world's premier collection of truly wonderful internet businesses.\n\nIt's so awesome. They're now a public company. They're the OGs. They started 10â15 years ago doing this. And now they're doing deals up to 100-plus million in size.\n\nBen: That's crazy. I never thought we would be saying that. Back when we started working with Tiny, we always positioned it as, if you have a wonderful small business on the Internet that might be doing a couple of million in operating profit. Things are very different now. They still love buying those businesses, but they have real scale to be the buyer of choice for internet businesses of any size.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Tiny has always been a great destination for bootstrapped and founder-led businesses, but now they're also at a scale where they can work with venture firms, too. For companies in your portfolio that aren't going to make it to IPO on their own, shoot Tiny an email and that could be a great exit option for your portfolio.\n\nBen: Tiny really is the poster child for durability, long-term thinking, compounding, because the whole thing started just with the profits of their very first business, the design agency, Metalab. Everything since is really just reinvesting positive cash flows in attractive investment opportunities, be it internally inside of the businesses themselves, or externally by buying new companies and just continuing to grow and compound. It's just like what we talked about here on Acquired in so many episodes.\n\nDavid: Totally. If you run a company, on a board of a company, or know of a company that might make sense for Tiny, just shoot them a note at hi@tiny.com. When you do, tell them that Ben and David sent you.\n\nAlso, for those of you who aren't following Tiny founder Andrew Wilkinson on Twitter out there, make sure you give him a follow. He has some great, great Twitter content. He's one of my favorite people in my feed.\n\nBen: Yup, grab the popcorn. All right, listeners, back to the episode.\n\nDavid: Okay. Ben, you hit on this a minute ago. What the hell? Why is the new western-controlled West German, post-Nazi government giving this deal of a lifetime to these former Nazis?\n\nBen: It's not just we'll pay you for the cars you distribute that we make. We will pay you for all cars that we make, every Beatle, regardless of whether you distribute it or not.\n\nDavid: Yes, to the German company, and then the Austrian company has exclusive rights to distribute it. It's a crazy deal. Here's what's going on. It actually, as crazy as it sounds, makes sense.\n\nWe talked about a minute ago, the Iron Curtain and the Soviets. It's so hard for us to remember now, but Germany, post war, was ground zero for the Cold War. The battle against the Soviet Union was happening right there, right next door.\n\nFor the West, reconstituting the West German industrial base was of paramount importance. The Marshall Plan that people probably know about, this is why the Marshall Plan happened. This is essentially part of this philosophy of, we don't care that these people used to be Nazis. But for Porsche, for Mercedes-Benz, and for lots and lots of German industrialist companies, the reason that they get restarted and reinjected with steroids, so to speak, is like, hey, we got an existential threat next door, we got to rebuild the industrial base.\n\nThe deal that they give them does come with an implicit string attached, which is they basically say to Porsche and other companies, we're not really going to give you a license to print money. Instead, we will give you a license to essentially create enterprise value.\n\nWhat West Germany does is they create one of the oddest tax incentive systems I've ever seen. For ordinary people in West Germany, post war, the tax rate was very low. The maximum amount of taxes that any normal person would pay would be 15%, 20% of your income. But for these new, old industrialists above a certain income, Germany sets the marginal tax rate at 95%.\n\nBen: They basically cap your income.\n\nDavid: Yeah. People are complaining. If you live in California, oh, my gosh. I'm paying 13% state income tax on top of federal. Imagine if the marginal tax rate were 95%.\n\nBen: Right, you would just have no incentive to earn any additional dollars.\n\nDavid: Right, and that's on the personal side. It's equally bad on the corporate side. Any profits are taxed.\n\nWhat are they trying to do here? They're trying to incentivize capital reinvestment in the industrial pace. They're basically saying to Porsche and others, set all this up. We're going to create all the incentives, such that you will plow all of the money, all these royalties we're giving you from the Beetles, et cetera, into building up your production capabilities, investing in R&D, new models, et cetera. It sounds crazy on paper, but my God, it actually works. It works really freaking well.\n\nDoug: Do you think there was some guarantee that the tax rates would lower someday?\n\nDavid: Maybe, and I think they did. As we'll see, Porsche becomes pretty institutionalized there of like, don't take profits. Instead reinvest them in new models, R&D, and racing to the great benefit of the brand.\n\nI mentioned one of the things that Porsche invests in over the years is race cars and racing. This is super interesting. None of us are racing historians. That's a whole another branch of the automotive industry.\n\nHere we are in the late 40s, early 50s. Racing in this era doesn't look at all like it looks today. It hadn't professionalized yet. The line between consumer enthusiast car market and professional racing market was very, very blurry.\n\nIt turns out that, even though manufacturers, including Porsche, would make special versions of cars for racing for Le Mans being the most famous race at the time and others around the world, you look at an F1 car today, or you look at a Le Mans car, there is no connection between that and something you can buy in a dealership.\n\nDoug: And you or I would not be able to even operate it.\n\nDavid: A super obvious point to illustrate this is, folks that are probably no names like James Dean or Steve McQueen, these famous Hollywood actors that were known as did all these racecar films, were also professional racecar drivers.\n\nDoug: Yeah, professional as it were in the time period.\n\nDavid: Yeah, they competed in real racings in addition to being actors.\n\nDoug: Imagine Brad Pitt jumping into Le Mans.\n\nDavid: Right? I was about to joke they'd kill themselves. James Dean did kill himself in a Porsche 550 Spyder, which Porsche would make a dedicated racing type vehicle that was also a consumer production vehicle, the 550. That never would have happened if Porsche wasn't incentivized to invest all their profits. Maybe you can say, the legendariness of that car, these sell for $5 million-plus today?\n\nDoug: They only made 90 of them in the end. It was a car that in theory, you could go and buy. While the 356 was the sports car that you could gentleman race, the 550 Spyder was for people who were really like, let's go racing and do it. But like you said, you could. A person could walk into it not a dealership necessarily, but just order one. But it is an absolute legend.\n\nDavid: Totally.\n\nBen: You see this moment where you see that bifurcation between anybody can do it and what the very best of the world look like. That seems to be true across everything in the world today, in the way that what Taylor Swift is doing on the stage on her tour, has nothing to do with a person who picks up their guitar, is talented, and plays at the local bar. She is the SR-71 pilot, this playing on a local bar stage is flying a Cessna, and the machinery to do so is entirely different, in the same way that you're talking about car racing, splitting at this moment in the early 50s.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Back to racing, we were talking about the Spyder a minute ago, I get so excited about James Dean. But Doug, to your point, 356s in 1951 and 1952, win their class at Le Mans. They don't win it outright. Other bigger powerful cars win it outright, but they win their engine classes at Le Mans. They're modified a little bit, but you basically buy them.\n\nDoug: That was a special thing, but that was the point of those classes. It was that there were cars for people who could go buy a car off the street and modify it.\n\nDavid: I think this was pretty unique to Porsches at the time. Certainly, you could go buy Ferraris, and Ferraris competed and whatnot. But again, Ferraris were a different thing. These weren't 356s, and I think they're probably also a lot more expensive than $3700.\n\nDoug: Plus, an important distinction between Porsche and Ferrari in this era, is that Porsche was largely focused on road cars, and then the road cars went racing, except for the 550, which was purpose built for racing. There were racing versions of the 356, but the goal was mostly road cars. Whereas Enzo, very famously, he just wanted to race. He hated his road car customers deeply.\n\nIt wasn't his thing. He just wanted to race. He only sold road cars to finance racing. A lot of the road cars that he ended up selling, were either based on race cars, or just former race cars. He was just like, I'm done with this crap, whereas 356s were being sold in pretty good volume.\n\nDavid: There's this great, great, great Ferry Porsche quote about this, which he would say later about the 911, but I think this also applies in early form to the 356. The quote is, \"We have the only car that can go from an East African Safari to Le Mans, then to the theater, and then to the streets of New York.\" That's such a unique thing, especially in this era.\n\nDoug: It remains true. It's Porsche's thing to this day, how relatively usable the car is in just about any setting. You can drive it to work. You can actually take it on a racetrack. That has remained an ether, whether or not it's constantly a north star for them, it is what they do more than anybody else.\n\nDavid: I was trying to think what the right other luxury brand analogy is. Porsche definitely is a luxury brand. It's not like we're making apples and oranges here. It's like a Rolex to me. What do you think?\n\nBen: Absolutely. You buy those watches to wear them. You don't buy them to keep them in a case and ogle at. They're steel. They're originally made for people who are swimming the English Channel or scuba diving. I think it's reasonable to also compare it to continuing in the luxury world like a Rimowa suitcase. Those aren't that expensive. They're three times, four times more expensive than regular luggage, but...\n\nDavid: They're not a Louis Vuitton trunk.\n\nBen: Right. You buy it to use it. It can get a little beat up. That's why it's made out of stainless steel also. It's not a Birkin bag.\n\nDavid: Brands like this are so valuable.\n\nBen: Because it has both the breadth and the depth. There are enough people who are like, I love Porsches because they're my cars I can actually drive, but they are supercars.\n\nDavid: Yes. This thing behind us goes 200 miles an hour?\n\nDoug: Yeah.\n\nBen: This thing behind us is a little bit different.\n\nDoug: There have been, and we'll get to it. The 550 Spyders, one of them, there have been some portions that go one way or another in the philosophy. But generally speaking, it's a middle of the road, going back to Ferry's quote about this exact thing, can do all these things.\n\nBen: Doug, one question for you. I'm going to keep going to you for terminology. David mentioned Le Mans. What is that?\n\nDoug: There are various car races that are considered the big car race. The Indy 500 is the car race of that racing series. Le Mans has always been a place to prove technology. It's a 24-hour race, so you switch drivers. It proves the endurance and the capabilities of a car and of a manufacturer over that time period. It's really serious.\n\nIt's always raining, it's always a disaster, it's in the middle of the night, and it's difficult. Being able to win or win your class, Le Mans is like the Monaco Grand Prix, the Super Bowl, if you will, of vehicles racing and that racer.\n\nDavid: Porsche would probably advance this argument that, relative to the other races, it's closer to what you want for an all-around-car that would also be a drivable car because fuel efficiency matters.\n\nDoug: It's also a road race, so it's not on a racetrack. It's literally on the closed-down roads in a French countryside and race on the road. There's some component of, instead of purpose building a car for a circuit like cows we're using this road two days before.\n\nDavid: Totally. On the back of all this success, James Dean, Steve McQueen, and all this, as you would imagine, Porsches start to become quite popular in America. I don't think Ferdinand and Ferry envisioned like, we're going to sell cars in America. This wasn't part of the business plan. But in 1954, Porsche sells 588 cars in the US, which was 40% of their entire production for the year. That 40% basically stays constant and goes way up for a while in the 70s and 80s, but it never dips below that. America is a huge market for Porsches.\n\nDoug: It's amazing to think that 588 cars was 40% of Porsche production. I agree with you, by the way, about your point that they didn't really have America in the business plan. One thing to provide some context, it's important to keep in mind, the number of sports cars startups happening in Europe at this time was significant, most of which listeners viewers will never really heard of because they all died.\n\nThese came out, they showed up, they raced a little, they sold some cars, they fail. There were tons of these. There was no concept that Porsche would be more successful than any of them. Obviously, the family hoped it would, and it became that way. But so many families hope theirs would, too, and they all failed. Somehow, Porsche grew, grew, and grew.\n\nDavid: Part of it was the incredible success of the cars. A big part of it, too, was the royalty on the Beetles. That's a nice steady source of cash flow that you can invest in your operation.\n\nBen: With forced reinvention. You're doing stuff like racing. You're doing stuff like looking internationally. You're like, what can we invest in that we're not sure if it's ROI-positive investments?\n\nDoug: We can be speculative because we know we got the money coming in. Beetle continues to be more and more and more popular. It only continues to embolden them to reinvest.\n\nDavid: Right. Speaking of reinvesting, as we get to the 1960s, the 356 is great. That's an amazing car. I don't know, Doug, where you would put it. In my mind, it's not quite a modern car. It's close. It's not a Model T, but it's not a 911.\n\nDoug: Right. What was starting to happen was, the 356 was one of the leaders of the charge of the sports car in that era. What was clearly starting to happen was, other sports cars are showing up that were refining some of the principles.\n\nDavid: Yes. We're now in the 60s, Ford announces the Mustang, Jaguars got the E type, and Chevy comes out with the second generation Corvette, the Stingray.\n\nDoug: All these are starting to show up. Everything is like, okay, there's a lot of pressure.\n\nDavid: Yup. In 1962, Ferry Porsche makes the decision like 356 is amazing, rebirth of the company, we got to invest the profits and replace it with a new model. For a couple of years, Porsche had actually been working on a design for a sedan for a larger model. It seems heretical now. If people look at the Panamera, they're like, eww. It was actually going to be the second model of Porsche.\n\nBen: I feel that way. Every time I see a Panamera drive by, I'm like, why does Porsche make this car? I see them driving by, so that's why they're making cars.\n\nDavid: China is why they make that, but we'll get to that later. The next generation of Porsches, Ferry's son Ferdinand, known as Butzi, named Ferdinand, named after his grandfather, the founder of Porsche, was working in the company. He had been leading the body design for this larger sedan that Porsche was going to make. Ferry decides, for a bunch of reasons, to cancel the sedan project.\n\nProbably the most important reason was, I don't know how much of this was government motivated and how much of it was just a cabal of Mercedes and BMW. They were the sedan makers. Porsche maybe could have challenged them, but it was like, hey, they've got their turf, we'll keep our turf in sports cars, and everybody will be happy here.\n\nAnyway, they decided to cancel the project and double down on sports cars. At the same time, Ferdinand Porsche, Butzi, the grandson, his cousin from the Austrian side of the family, Louise and Anton's son, also named Ferdinand, Ferdinand Piech, also joined the company. These two young Turks, the grand sons, Ferdinand, are here in the company.\n\nPiech is working in the engine department. It turns out that he's a pretty brilliant engine designer. I believe even as a young kidâDoug you know more about this historyâI think he really was the one that led the development of the six-cylinder boxer engine for Porsche. He didn't invent the six-cylinder boxer engine, but the engine that ends up in the 911 that is, still to this day, the model for the 911 engine, comes from him, I think.\n\nHe's working on it for a racing car project that ends up not coming together. Ferry says, okay, let's take these two failed projects that the next generation is working on, let's weave them together, take the styling that Butzi has done for the sedan, take this amazing engine that Ferdinand has built for the racing operations, and let's see what happens when we put them together. This is the birth of the Porsche 901.\n\nBen: David, I'm not familiar with that model. What is that?\n\nDavid: Doug, I'm sure you knew this. Lots of people listening know the story.\n\nDoug: This is a famous, famous story.\n\nDavid: I had no idea. I think most people have no idea. The 911 is only called the 911 because Peugeot, of all companies, had a trademark in France for any car with a model name of any Roman number with a zero in the middle and then any other number, so X0X.\n\nDoug: In fact, all Peugeot cars, even to this day, are named 205, 206, 207, 208, 308, 408, 508. They trademark them all just knowing that eventually, that would happen.\n\nDavid: Unbelievable. It makes sense. Porsche's like, we can't really not sell in France. France wasn't the biggest market, but it wasn't a small market.\n\nDoug: The story that I've heard about this is that they said, we got these badges that say nine, zero, and one. Why don't we do 911 because we have the nine and the one already, hence the 911.\n\nSome of this may be more powerful than others. One of the things that I don't understand is why they wanted to call it the 901 in the first place. I was never really able to get great information about that. The 356 was purportedly named because it was the 356 engineering project they did. But did they really do 500 engineering products between 356 and 901?\n\nDavid: A couple of details that I got on this from Excellence Was Expected. I could be wrong on this, but (1) I believe 901 was the name of the engine project that Ferdinand Piech was working on. I think that's the origin of it. (2) Yes. In Porsche lore, the reason these model numbers are like, these are the engineering projects that they start, but that's totally apocryphal. They jump around all the time.\n\nDoug: Now they go forward and backward.\n\nDavid: Yes. Going back to the very, very beginning of the consulting company, they started with type seven or project number seven because they didn't want to look like they were random companies like, oh, yeah, we've already done six projects, this is project number seven. I forget who they were working for.\n\nBen: It's like when you're starting a new company and you're sending your first invoice. You don't call it invoice number one.\n\nDavid: Right, exactly. The lore is that, all of our projects have model numbers. I'm like, yeah, BS. It's so funny.\n\nBen: To be clear, I admired designs of Porsche cars before doing the research for this, but knew basically nothing about the company or its lineup. I've certainly never owned one. It took me a long time in the research to realize that there are a lot of car designs that start with nine that are all 911s. I didn't write them all down, but the 964 and the 959.\n\nDoug: It gets complicated because what ends up happening, just like happens to every car, is they start to get redesigned. As the years go on, they need newer models. They still call it the 911. Let me just distinguish the newer version from the older version is to call it by the project number, which is 964, 993, et cetera. If you're really into it, you got to know not just that it's a 911, but which version it is.\n\nBen: And not all 911 say 911 on the back, so you can't even use that as your reference.\n\nDoug: No. It's a little complicated. Maybe that's part of the success. There's a language you have to speak in order to get Porsche to an extent. There's something to that.\n\nDavid: I think it's really brilliant. I don't know how much this is intentional versus its evolved this way with the brand. But to me, it's just so brilliant because there is this tribe language to Porsches. If you see a 911, you know instantly that it's a 911. It is iconic. It's one of the most iconic designs in the world.\n\nDoug: Partly because they've essentially kept the shape the same since this.\n\nDavid: Since 1962, yeah. Pretty immediately, this car is a big hit. 1962 is when they start working on it. They first start selling it in 1964. They sunset the 356 in 1965, so 1966 is the first year that's fully 911 for Porsche production.\n\nThey sell almost 13,000 cars in 1966, which that's 10â12 years ago, they only sold a thousand total. They're now 13X in 10 years. That number of almost 13,000 911s they sold was 15% more than their best year with only the 356s. Doug, how would you characterize? What makes the 911 so special?\n\nDoug: It's important to keep in mind, at the time, you didn't know. It was just like this thing, this sports car they had come up with. Again, there were a lot of sports cars, and it was whatever. But of course, what has ended up happening is that this car has become symbolic of the sports car.\n\nI think a lot of people, if you were to mention a sports car, they would say the 911. It just has become the car. Like you say, it was clear very early on that they had something special in this great combination of reliability, comfort, practicality, just like the 356 had been but just better.\n\nDavid: To my thinking, the flat-six boxer engine, which was a great engine that Ferdinand Piech designed to go in this first 911, there's something cool and unique to it. Like we've been talking about the difference between Porsches and other cars here, this is a performance engine, but it's a six, and it's rear-mounted.\n\nDoug: Right. The 356 had a boxer four. To explain what a boxer engine is, these days, most cars have inline engines where the cylinders are in a line. A lot of other cars in the past have had V engines, where the cylinders literally make a V for balance. The boxer engine, the cylinders are literally across from each other. It's flat. They call it a flat engine or a boxer because the cylinder heads look like they're boxing each other as they go back and forth.\n\nThe benefit of the boxer engine was that it's got this great balance to it because it's literally flat in the car. Yes, it was unusual. I don't think it was necessarily unusual to do a six-cylinder engine. Although as time has gone on, it has started to become more unusual.\n\nThe police cars still have six cylinders, even as V8s and V12s became more popular, but it was the thing. It was what they did. It was part of that ethos of keep it relatively light, relatively simple, and strip things down to the core essentials of the car.\n\nDavid: An average person can walk off the street, buy one, operate it, drive to work, and have a great time.\n\nDoug: It wasn't crazy fast or anything else.\n\nDavid: Yup. The old 356 had four cylinders. Now, the 911 have six cylinders. Like you said, it's not a world class powerful fast car, but it elevates the 356 into a much moreâ¦ You can really achieve a lot more with this than you could with the 356s. This becomes super important from a business side for Porsche because they priced the 911 about 50% higher than they had the 356.\n\nWhat they do at first, they realized this is going to create a major price gap or lineup here. We're going to lose a lot of customers by elevating, so they do a stop gap. At the same time that they introduced the 911, they also introduced the 912. The 912 is a 911 with the old 356 four-cylinder engine. They essentially downgrade the 911 to be the entry-level model only as a stopgap. They don't want to do this permanently.\n\nThey sell about three quarters of the units or the 912s, the cheaper four-cylinder ones, and one quarter of their sales are the more expensive 911s. The profit margins, though, on the 911s are so much higher.\n\nFerry starts thinkingâand this is part of the plan all along, I thinkâlet's create a whole new model. The old 356, we're going to bifurcate our performance, real enthusiast customers who are willing to spend, and we're going to make great margins on those models. That's going to be the 911. Let's create a new car that can be the entry-level Porsche. We'll eventually introduce the Boxster 20-plus years later. It takes Porsche a while to really get to the perfect end state of this strategy here.\n\nFor this new car, Ferry says, hey, we're not really equipped yet to be running multiple lines as just us, Porsche the company, we need a partner for this new car. Let's turn to our good old friends at Volkswagen and jointly engineer and produce this new car with them.\n\nIn 1967, Porsche kicks off a joint project with Volkswagen to produce a new mid-engined roadster, eventually smaller, more compact car, and mid-engined. not rear-engined, called the 914. The idea is that they're going to make both a four-cylinder and a six-cylinder version of this. The four-cylinder version is going to be a Volkswagen, the six-cylinder version is going to be a Porsche. Ferry puts his nephew, Fernand Piech, in charge of this joint project with Volkswagen. A very fateful decision, as we shall see.\n\nWhat ultimately happens with the 914, there's a change in CEO of Volkswagen, and the new CEO definitely sees the value in deepening the relationship with Porsche and specifically their relationship with young Ferdinand. He wants to continue the project, but he's like, I actually don't think that a sports car makes sense in the VW lineup. Why don't we just have all of these be Porsches?\n\nBen: The plan was originally to have some of the 914s be branded VW and some of them be branded Porsche?\n\nDoug: Volkswagen had made a little sports car called the Karmann Ghia previous to this in the 60s. The thought was that they wanted to replace the Karmann Ghia, Porsche wanted an entry level car, let's jointly develop it. Porsche gets the more powerful one, the 914/6, the six-cylinder and Volkswagen to get the four-cylinder, but the decision was made, like you said.\n\nDavid: The new VW CEO, he actually gets a pretty good deal out of this. He deepens the relationship with Ferdinand. He gives the car fully to Porsche. But in exchange, VW takes over all of Porsche's distribution in America. A huge deal for VW. We're starting to re-intertwining these companies just a little bit.\n\nBen: That deal is an enormously wide-ranging partnership, because you're trading distribution from one side of your business with the ability to create a product on your other side. It's basically merging the companies because it's so massively intertwined now in this partnership, where it's not like, oh, yeah, we partner with them on this one small little thing. It's like, no, our car that we expect to sell more of than any other car, is made by this other company. Meanwhile, on the VW side of things, it's like, America, the most important and largest growing car market in the world, we now own the distribution for Porsche. Even if it's not structured this way, this is a merger.\n\nDavid: If history were a straight line, what you were saying would come to pass. Unfortunately, it's not a straight line or fortunately for drama on our show. You're absolutely right. The 914 goes on to be a huge success. It sells way more units than the 911, which was the whole strategy.\n\nPorsche is cool with this. They're like, great, we're making our profits on the more expensive 911. We've segmented out our market. The 914 is the entry level Porsche. It sells 100,000 units in the eight years that it's on the market.\n\nI think it really shows. Doug, you can comment on this. There is also a market for mid-engine Roadsters, including the one sitting behind us, regardless of price. These are pretty amazing sports cars.\n\nDoug: Yeah. Porsche, previous to this, had all been rear engines, the 911, the 356, so this was a mid-engine, which was starting to really take hold in the car world as the right design because the engine in the middle is really the perfect balance. You can put the engine right in the center of the car, and it gives you perfect weight distribution.\n\nWhen I was talking about sports cars, in my mind, God intended sports cars to be mid-engined. It's more difficult. The engineering is more difficult than front engine. Rear engine is just insane, but Porsche made it work. They're always been great at that. But mid-engined is how it should be.\n\nBen: When you say mid, this basically means that it's still obviously behind where the passenger sit but in front of the rear axle?\n\nDoug: In this case. There are technical mid-engine cars, where the engine is in the front but behind the front axle. But most people, when referring to a mid-engined car, are talking about a car that has the engine between the passenger compartment and the rear axle.\n\nDavid: I think you have a video where you say, the Cayman GT4 RS, which is the Cayman and the Boxster are the same, it's the same lineage we're talking about here, is the best modern Porsche.\n\nDoug: Yeah, I feel that way. It's controversial because the 911 is the Porsche.\n\nDavid: Don't hate us in the comments.\n\nBen: I don't know, Doug. I feel like I've seen multiple the best on your channel.\n\nDoug: Every car is the best when it comes out, and then it's superseded by the next best.\n\nDavid: One of the differences between YouTube and podcast world is titles. SEO is really important in the YouTube world, right?\n\nDoug: Very, and I don't even take advantage of it as much as some like my colleagues.\n\nDavid: Around this topic here of engines, I got to imagine, this is one of just the huge sea changes that is coming with electric vacation of performance cars. It's a whole different set of calculus. It doesn't matter that there's no engine anymore.\n\nDoug: Although, even for a performance electric car, you still want the weight to be as close to the middle of the car as possible for a similar reason, honestly. But the engine component and all that other stuff, boxer, it's gone.\n\nDavid: It's gone. A minute ago, Ben, you said like, oh, this naturally would lead to a merging of VW and Porsche. I was like, well. This was in the late 60s when the 914 launches. As we head into the 70s, the oil crisis happens, and sports cars become less of a thing. People are really worried about this. This is a challenge to Porsche. It's particularly a real challenge to the 914.\n\nInterestingly, 911 sales stay relatively robust throughout the 70s because it's a luxury good. Just like in any recession and even sector-targeted ones like the oil crisis in the auto industry, for true luxury goods, those people, the market for that is very resilient. The 914, though, very different story.\n\nAs we head into the mid-70s, even though it was a very successful car and project for Porsche as a whole, it starts becoming a real money loser. This creates a lot of tension in the company. This is a backdrop of stress.\n\nAnother family dynamic that's emerging, which is you've got these two Ferdinand grandsons that are starting to vie for control of the company, they're now probably in their 30s, maybe entering their 40s, Ferry's getting older here. Who's going to take over the company? We've got succession vibes here.\n\nOn the one side, you've got Butzi Ferdinand Porsche, he's got the name. He's Ferry's son, and he's a great designer. He designed the 911, maybe the most iconic car design ever.\n\nBen: And this is German Ferdinand, the one's working and actually producing the cars.\n\nDoug: But the other Ferdinand, the son of Louise and Anton, was hired by the German company also.\n\nDavid: Yeah, he's hopped over. He's, on the one hand, like this dark horse kid. He's the Austrian side of the family. You've got the car dealership, business, blah-blah-blah, but he also proved himself as an incredible engineer executive. He was in charge of this 914 project. He managed it with Volkswagen. That was an incredibly successful car until the oil crisis, et cetera.\n\nHe's like, yo, this should be my company. Tensions, of course, start to rise. Something pretty incredible happens. We've come across on the show. There are lots of stories out there of family businesses, succession, and how all this happens. I don't think there's another case of anything going down like this that I've ever heard of.\n\nIn the fall of 1970, Ferry and Louise together, call a joint family summit. They're like, we're going to settle things. I don't know. I'm speculating here, but I suspect Ferry and Louise didn't have a lot of acrimony over. They're brother and sister. Louise had her company, Ferry had his company.\n\nDoug: They're both making a lot of money.\n\nDavid: They're both making a lot of money, everybody's happy. This is between the children here. They call a family summit. At the end of it, they come to a very, very surprising decision. They don't decide that one Ferdinand or the other is going to take over. Instead, they make the call that the families are going to completely and jointly exit operating the business, everybody out of the pool, not the two Ferdinands. Ferry himself, who's running the company.\n\nFerdinand's long dead at this point, the original Ferdinand. They're going to continue owning the company, but they will no longer manage the company. They will no longer operate the company. They will no longer design cars. They will no longer make product decisions.\n\nFrankly, this is just insane. It'd be one thing if they were like, oh, you know, we're really not that good at this. We should hire professional men. These are ledly generational talents in the car industry. The best solution they can come up with is, you know what? We're all done here.\n\nBen: This is crazy. I would be so fascinating to get video footage of what actually went down in that room and the logic that they could walk themselves through to this is actually the best outcome.\n\nDavid: There are some direct quotes from a lot of them in Excellence Was Expected. As you can imagine, it's a very delicate topic. They're also German, so they're very prim and proper. I think Ferry basically admits. He's like, yeah, there probably was a better solution to this. It did mean that we could reunite as a family.\n\nI think he said something like, there were still tensions, but we could go to each other's birthdays again, something like that. I guess in that, if you value family above all else, maybe it is irrational. It's crazy.\n\nDoug: It's especially a crazy decision because like you said, they were killing it. They built a family business until this point, and it had been a very successful one because of the efforts of the family. Looking back on this, we know what happens to Ferdinand Piech which we'll get to, but you've got him on this up and coming track where he's so legit.\n\nDavid: He must have been so pissed.\n\nDoug: It's like, no, you're out.\n\nDavid: He definitely was so pissed. Let's talk about what happens here. Butzi goes off and founds Porsche Design, so there exists. There's Porsche sunglasses out there. You can buy Porsche designed laptops, all this stuff. That's him. That's a totally new company that he started.\n\nIt has now been reabsorbed into the broader Porsche conglomerate. But that was started, he was like, all right, great, I want to be a designer. That's the path that he goes down.\n\nBen: The same thing happened in the Gucci family, for anyone who's seen the Gucci movie with Adam Driver. He's just a family member who wanders off and does some, effectively, brand licensing. He's like, I'm going to take the family name and make some money off of it.\n\nDoug: Which is obviously what's happening here.\n\nDavid: I think he also was very talented. He designed the 911, for God's sake. He's talented, but yes, trading on the name here. The other Ferdinand, Piech, this guy, oh, my God, he is a G.\n\nAt first, I imagine inspired by his grandfather, he's like, I'm going to go start my own engineering consulting company and consult for other car companies. He does do that for a little bit. But pretty quickly, thereafter, remember, VW and the new CEO really wanted to build this relationship with Porsche, with Piech. He gets recruited to come in and take over Audi for VW. I think he enters working within Audi, but then very quickly becomes the head of the Audi brand for Volkswagen.\n\nBen: Doug, at this point in history, what does the Volkswagen Group own brand-wise?\n\nDoug: That's an interesting question. The brands that we know, I think it was just Volkswagen and Audi.\n\nDavid: Audi had been a separate company.\n\nDoug: Audi had been a separate company, and it's also important contextually here to make one really important point about Piech and Audi. At that time, Audi was a joke. Audi was not what it is now. Now you view Audi as a legitimate competitor of Mercedes and BMW. Back then, it was more like how Saab would have been treated. It was an absolute second or third tier brand. It was not a brand that was desirable at that time.\n\nDavid: It would be like today's...\n\nDoug: Infinity?\n\nDavid: I know you owned a Kia, but Kia and Hyundai are trying to enter the luxury market.\n\nDoug: It was on that level of like, nah, I'm going to stick with Mercedes.\n\nDavid: Yeah.\n\nBen: Was the Audi 5000 the thing that saved them and brought them back?\n\nDoug: On the contrary, actually, that car was the one that had the famous scandal in the United States, where the 60 minutes found that unintended acceleration, where it would accelerate, which turned out to be unfounded. But their reputation was severely damaged by that. That was this era. Audi needed to turn around. Volkswagens got out either like, we don't know what the hell to do with this thing. We got BMW and Mercedes, they're killing it.\n\nDavid: Piech comes in. This dude is good. This was such a mistake to force him out of Porsche. He turns around Audi and builds Audi into, Doug, like you said, the Audi we know today. He's so successful that in 1993, he gets promoted and becomes CEO of Volkswagen.\n\nDoug: You had this situation where they kicked him out of running the company, and then he goes and ends up running Volkswagen.\n\nDoug: It's wild.\n\nDavid: Wild. He oversaw and launched the new Beetle. Literally, his grandfather's legacy, he turned over the Beetle model to the new Beetle.\n\nBen: How long was Ferdinand Piech running Volkswagen?\n\nDavid: A long time. In 1993, I believe he was chairman until 2015, 2016 maybe? A long time.\n\nDoug: he develops this reputation of being this just iron-fisted. When you say I can only imagine how upset he was when they made the decision to end the family involvement, he has this rep of being incredibly angry, and everything must be to his standard. I can only imagine how angry he was.\n\nDavid: He had 13 children by, I think, four different women.\n\nDoug: That's a lot of kids. He was that typical, how you think of a German industrialist. Around this time, Volkswagen started really gaining a lot of brands. In the late 90s, they bought Lamborghini. They own two Europe-only brands, one for Spain and one for Eastern Europe. They repurchase the rights to the Bugatti name, which had gone to an Italian company. They brought it back to France where it was initially existing.\n\nDavid: Yeah, restarted. Doug, you said, but to put a bow on it of what a baller Piech was. In 1999, the Global Automotive Elections Foundation award him the car executive of the century.\n\nDoug: By the way, that's uncontested. In the car world, Ferdinand Piech is looked at as exactly what you're saying, the guy. Everybody knows his impact. Everybody knows how effective he was.\n\nDavid: The family's Porsche is just like, yeah, now you got to get out of here. Unbelievable. Maybe he wouldn't have had the motivation. Who knows? It's just wild.\n\nBen: But Volkswagen is much bigger company than Porsche. He got kicked out of his own company, so he went and ran a much bigger one that competes with it.\n\nDoug: Then he grew even bigger.\n\nDavid: Yeah, wow. Back to the Porsche side, this decision was really not good, really not good. The first CEO who comes in, the first professional manager CEO, actually is somebody who has been with the company for a long time. Ernst Fuhrmann becomes the first non-family member CEO of Porsche. He was actually part of the original elite engineering crew back in the sawmill in Gmund, so he has a long history with the company. Unfortunately, he was probably a better engineer than a manager, though.\n\nHis first move is to scrap the 914 and instead introduce the 924. The 924 was another joint project between VW and Porsche. The problem with the 924, I think it actually was a decent car. Doug, you actually reviewed a 944 recently, which is the next iteration of it. You can say, I think it was a good car, but it's not a Porsche. It's a front-engined water-cooled.\n\nDoug: It suffered from that stigma for sure. The saving grace was it was actually a pretty good car to drive. Over the years and even at the time, it was accepted as, hey, we all get that it came from a Volkswagen but the beloved 914, and it drives pretty well. People were like, yeah, we'll take this as the entry Porsche of the time, but it wasn't a 911.\n\nDavid: It wasn't a 911, and it wasn't a 914 either.\n\nDoug: No. It was a totally different thing. The 914 was a small lightweight compact roadster removable top. The 924 was definitely a different situation.\n\nDavid: Fuhrmann had a quote on it when asked about, what is this? He says, \"The 924 is aimed at new clients who either can't afford a 911 or are not necessarily looking for the performance of a 911. I guess that's true. That's also true of the 914, but that's not the right way you want to position your brand.\n\nDoug: That's quiet part loud.\n\nDavid: Yeah.\n\nBen: Can you come up with something that is not using the word not to describe who wants it? How about you say, who would want it?\n\nDoug: Right. This is for the poor customers.\n\nDavid: Right. Also, in whole philosophy of it, it's not a Porsche. Even more concerning is the 928. Fuhrmann makes a decision as the new CEO of the company that it's time to replace the 911.\n\nLet's give him some credit. This is the 70s. The oil crisis is going on. There's the safety regulation. This is postâRalph Nader and Unsafe at Any Speeds. It's maybe reasonable to think that a rear engine sports car isn't a great strategy to be pursuing here.\n\nBen: Unsafe at Any Speed, that was a federal report that came out that said, basically, all cars on the market are unbelievably unsafe, and people or citizens should not be driving around in them, so all cars need to change.\n\nDoug: And regulation started to really show up in this time period. In the car world, the 60s are viewed as the last bastion of just, anything goes. Some very special cars came out of that era, and the 70s, everything started to getâ¦ The oil crisis was a big factor because that started to screw with emissions, and then you had all these regulations about bumpers, safety, and seatbelts, that were very important and beneficial, but at the time, it was like youâre killing our fun.\n\nBen: It is astonishing how much safer cars have gotten. You look at these cute old Porsches that are so much smaller. You look at the big ones today, and you can lament, oh, cars have gotten so big, but cars have also gotten so much safer far.\n\nDoug: And they're faster than they were back then, so it's the best of all worlds. In most cases, they're more efficient also.\n\nDavid: Totally. In 1978, Fuhrmann introduces the Porsche 928 with the stated intention that this is going to eventually replace the 911. They keep selling the 911. He says, we'll keep selling the 911 as long as we get demand for, I think it was at least 10,000 units a year or something like that. Once the 928 is on the market, and demand dips for the 911, we'll stop making them.\n\nDoug: Now I want to defend the 928 a little bit here. This is an important moment in Porscheâs history. When we look back on it now, it seems insane that the 911 would go away. How could that be? But it's important to keep in mind that the 356 went away, and that was the Porsche. Now you say like, oh, I have a Jeep, and you're referring to the Wrangler. The Porsche was the 356. That went away, and for the 911, it only made sense, at some point, that 911 would also go away.\n\nThe crazy thing about the 928 in the Porsche world is that it was a front engine V8 car, which Porsche had never pursued before, and was more an American thing. But in the context of the time, it's not that insane that they went after this. All sports cars were starting to get bigger and more powerful. Because of the oil crisis, and because of tightening emissions laws, it was getting very difficult to make any power from anything other than a big engine.\n\nEven big engine cars at that time didn't really make a lot of power. Cadillac had eight liter V8s that made like 150 horsepower. It was embarrassing stuff, because they had to put so many emissions controls on that by the time you actually got the power out, it was a disaster. It didn't seem that insane. And the Jaguar E type had just been replaced. That was the big competitor. It was another sports car. That had been replaced by the XJS, which was now a V8 comfortable automatic transmission car.\n\nMercedes Benz did the same thing with the SL class. It went from a little fun sports car like the 911 to a big V8 relaxed, leather, luxury cruiser, that sort of thing. It made sense that Porsche would maybe want to head in that direction also and start thinking about moving past the 911, just as they had moved past the 356, 20 years before. There was some sense to it.\n\nDavid: The 928 comes out in 1978. As we reach the end of the 70s and into the 80s, as we also have talked about a lot on this show, everything that the 70s was in terms of austerityâoil crisis, 17% interest rates, and massive inflationâthe 80s was not that, shall we say. It was a rising tide that lifts all boats.\n\nBen: Yes, lots of disposable income, Wall Street is ripping.\n\nDavid: A lot of pinstripes.\n\nBen: Yeah. It seems like actually a really good time for fast cars.\n\nDavid: It seems like a good time for fast cars, and indeed it was, including for the 928 and the 924, succeeded by the 944, and the 911 people still wanted them, I think, largely because of that, although I'm sure there were other reasons too. The Porsche and Piech families, when they exit operationally from the business, they still own the business. They're still the supervisory board.\n\nThey get fed up with Fuhrmann. They oust him, and they bring on a new CEO, an American, as CEO of Porsche, one Peter Schutz. Famously, he comes in, and he redraws the 911 production line. Doug, I know you have some first hand experience of the legendariness.\n\nDoug: It's one of the great stories in the auto industry. The 928, though I just provided an impassioned defense for it, never felt like the right car to Porsche. It never felt like the right car to especially the employees who had fallen in love with this 911. It had been in production now at this point for probably 20 years, 25 years maybe.\n\nThe 911 was Porsche to a lot of these people. The fact that it was going to get replaced by the 928 was the sad thing. It had really hurt morale in Stuttgart, at the factory all the way up to some of the people at the top.\n\nThe great story is that the 911, everybody knows the impending cancellation is coming. It's still going but it's coming, this beloved car. Peter Schutz, the American CEO is sitting in the office of Helmuth Bott, who's the Chief of Engineering for Porsche. There's a line on the wall that shows where all the products stop and start in the timeline.\n\nDavid: This is on a whiteboard or a piece of paper tacked to the wall.\n\nDoug: Yeah, on a whiteboard or something. Right. They're sitting there talking about it. They know that morale is low. They know that the company wants to keep the 911, even though it should be replaced because it's old. That's the thinking of the people.\n\nBen: And that's what was said. There's a thing in German culture, where when something has been decided, it's been decided.\n\nDoug: An edict has been given and the car's out. The 928 is on sale. It has shown up to replace the 911 in the spirit of these other cars of the time. The V8 front engine, it made sense, that was what they were going to do. But the morale was low, and they knew this, so Schutz stands up. He's got a marker in his hand, he stands up, he walks up to the timeline on the wall, and he draws a line on the timeline all the way onto the wall and extends the 911's timeline indefinitely, including on to the literal wall.\n\nThis story, of course, is like the stuff of legend in Porsche. Peter Schutz, the American CEO, saving the 911 in this moment. A lot of talk about whether this actually happened. Did he actually just draw the line and make the complete 180?\n\nDavid: This would be a good story to invent if you needed a morale boosting.\n\nDoug: Right, especially if you're trying to boost for the reputation of the CEO among the workers. He drew the line.\n\nBen: There's a perfect line, which is Schutz just looks over at the Chief of Engineering and goes, do we understand each other? And then he walks out.\n\nDoug: I always wondered if the story was true. I worked at Porsche 10 years ago and had become friends with Porsche's general counsel in North America. When Peter Schutz retired, he moved to Naples, Florida, and the general council of Porsche and Peter Schutz were neighbors in their homes in Naples.\n\nI, one day, went over to his house and asked him, is the story real? Did it happen? Apparently, Schutz said, not only did it happen, but Helmuth Bott was grinning like the Cheshire Cat when I drew that line. It was this moment like, we're going to do this. Apparently, in his words, it really actually was a true story.\n\nBen: Wow.\n\nDavid: It's so great.\n\nBen: That's awesome to get that validation because there are so many of these stories that we tell on the show, where we're like, this is probably apocryphal, and there's really no way to verify it.\n\nDoug: Of course, if you're Schutz, you'd want to tell the story because it becomes so famous. But from his mouth, at least the story is real.\n\nDavid: It's a great story. Literally, he extended the life of the production line on to the wall.\n\nBen: Did they keep making both cars?\n\nDavid: Yeah. I think they made the 928 until 1995. It was Wiedeking who comes in in a minute, who finally kills the damn thing.\n\nDoug: The problem with this decision, you'll get into more economic realities of this situation as the 80s draw to a close, whatever. But the problem with this decision was the company was planning on ending the 911. By drawing that line, symbolic that was, we're going to keep doing this, it also committed a lot of the company's resources to now refreshing something that they hadn't planned on refreshing.\n\nDavid: Yup. In the go-go years of the early- through mid-80s, no problem, more. We'll do an ICO. Let's use some NFTs.\n\nBen: The tech of 2021.\n\nDavid: Exactly.\n\nBen: In fact, I think Schutz was like, let's make airplane engines.\n\nDavid: Yes, I think he was. Yes, oh, my gosh. On the back of these go-go years and success, they're selling the 911, they're selling the 920. They're selling a lot of 944s. They sold a ton of those things. The families take the company public.\n\nJust like we talked about on the LVMH episode, a lot of these European luxury brands, craftsman brands, did an IPO. They thought they were being smart. They sold, I think, a 30% stake in the company, but all non voting shares.\n\nThey're like, no corporate raiders here. Nobody will have any voting control except the family's. It is impossible that somebody could attack us because the families and all of them. It would have to be somebody inside the families who would attack us. Why would that ever happen?\n\nEverything goes great. The stock doubles within the first year that it's on the market, but then in 1987, Long Term Capital Management blows it. The end of the go-go years, the 80s, not good for Porsche, and not good in a lot of senses. (a) Just pure economic climate not good for anybody. (b) You're making luxury sports cars.\n\nAs we talked about in the 70s, the oil crisis in the 70s was bad for Porsche, it was really bad for the 914. The 911 was pretty robust. It was very resilient. I think the same is, again, true here at the end of the 80s, but they've still got the 928 and the 944 on the market. Those things started sucking wind big time.\n\nDoug: It's not a good situation because now you have three aged products. The economy is slowing, and your cars are not really competitive.\n\nDavid: Yes. Schutz, though, continues production of all three lines. Not only does he continue production, he reinvests, especially in the 924, 944 line. They even refreshed it a third time to the 968, same basic car. They're investing resources in this car.\n\nYou probably have a better sense than me. Another aspect of the recession at the end of the 80s was the exchange rates with European currencies got hit really hard. Relative to the Asian currencies in the US, it became call it $10,000â$20,000 cheaper to buy an equivalent entry level sports car from a Japanese manufacturer.\n\nDoug: It just so happened that at this time, Japan was having an economic boom. As a result of that, they started making these sports cars, these sports cars you're describing. The Nissan 300ZX, the Toyota Supra, all these cars are showing up. By the way, they don't have four-cylinder engines, and they're not 20-year-old platforms like the 968 was, and there was very little reason to buy a 968.\n\nDavid: In my history, probably all of us barely starting to enter consciousness here. This is preâFast and the Furious, but not that preâFast and the Furious. All those Japanese cars that got tuned up, the Supras especially, this is that era.\n\nDoug: They were all starting to come in then and starting to blow up, and they offered just as they do today, this great, great value proposition of big power for not as much money.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Again, the 911 isn't threatened by this, but the 944 and 968, hell yeah, is threatened by this. Nobody's buying those anymore.\n\nDoug: The 928 by then was so old that sales were a trickle by 90. There were three products, which was the entry level, which was the 944 that became the 968. Then there was the 911, which was actually the 964/911 by that point. It only makes things even more confusing. And then there was the 928, which was the front engine V8 flagship car.\n\nDavid: That nobody wanted.\n\nDoug: That nobody wanted.\n\nBen: They literally only made three cars, and they were all three number nine cars?\n\nDoug: It was a complete disaster. Porsches never named cars well, even now. But at the time, again, you had to speak the language. By the way, the 911s all said Carrera on the back, so everybody's like, what? Is this 911? Why does it say Carrera? It never made any sense.\n\nBen: All Carreras are 911s, but all 911s are not Carreras today?\n\nDoug: That has changed over the years. Then there was a trim level of the 924 called the Carrera. There was actually called the Carrera GT, which they later named this car. It was all confusing. You had to be a German who was into this stuff to figure out the precision level with which it made sense.\n\nDavid: As all this happens, Porsche's now a public company. The stock price starts to decline precipitously.\n\nBen: And they floated 30% of it.\n\nDavid: No voting control, but the company are really cresting the tree tops here as they're beginning their descent. At one point, Porsche's market cap was less than â¬400 million.\n\nDoug: Crazy to imagine.\n\nDavid: Almost zero. I believe, also at that time, they didn't have any debt. Truly, the markets believed that Porsche was worth nothing. It wasn't like, oh, there's value here, but there's a big debt burden on the company.\n\nDoug: It was an unbelievably difficult time. It's funny to think about because now, people think of Porsche as Porsche, like this crazy company. It's one of the hottest brands. Like you said, probably one of the most valuable brands.\n\nBen: And it's only 30 years later.\n\nDoug: Only 30 years later. It was dire straits. I pulled up the US sales figures for Porsche from this era. It's so insane to me. They dipped in 1991 and 1992 to 4100 units. That was worse than 1965 sales. They had routinely sold between 13 and 30,000 cars a year throughout the 60s, 70s, 80s. In the US, at 1992, they dipped to 4100 cars. That was the level that we were talking about. It was complete dire straits.\n\nDavid: Even though the public doesn't have any voting control, everybody starts to think. The only thing that can happen here is this company's going to get bought out. One equity research analyst, actually in a research note, said that he thought there was a 98% chance that the families would have to sell, and that they would accept some amount of value for their stake rather than just have it go to zero.\n\nSchutz gets fired, but it's not like that fixes anything. I think it was 1987 when he gets fired. Over the next six years, they cycle through, I think, three or four more CEOs. None of which really figure it out. There is one bright spot, though, however, which if this were a normal Acquired episode, we would just skip, but we've got Doug. The 959.\n\nDoug: Yeah. Actually, the 959 and another interesting component offshooting that. The 959 comes out at that time, which is their first supercar. It's the predecessor to this car. It actually wasn't commercially successful in keeping with Porsche's world at the time. It was a testbed for some new technology, including four wheel drive and a supercar, which has now pretty much become standard fare. The 959 was really the first car that had that.\n\nAfter the 959, Porsche was so desperate that they started taking on projects for other manufacturers. It's known in the car world, but not as much in the general world, Porsche built a Mercedes-Benz, which was called the 500 E. It was a midsize sedan. Mercedes didn't have the capacity or didn't really want to do it.\n\nDavid: He built a sedan for Mercedes.\n\nDoug: In the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen in Stuttgart.\n\nBen: Who designed it?\n\nDoug: It was a Mercedes car, so it was a Mercedes E class. A regular Mercedes sedan, but with a larger engine. Mercedes felt that having Porsche involved would give it some sportscar credibility, Porsche literally produced the car, and then Audi did the exact same thing. Audi needed more credibility because they were still a fledgling luxury car brand. They wanted to get into the sports realm because that's where a lot of money was being made.\n\nAudi came to Porsche and said, can you help us develop a car? And it was called the RS2. I actually had one, I just sold it last year. It was the station wagon. That was the conditions under which Porsche agreed to build the car. They said, we will do it, but we don't want to compete with our cars as a coupe, a sports car, so they built the station wagon, which essentially touched off the high performance station wagon thing, which Audi is still known for to this day more than almost any other thing.\n\nPorsche was so desperate, they even allowed Audi to license their name and put it on those cars. The RS2 had Porsche brakes that branded Porsche. The Porsche logo appears in the badge, like the literal emblem on the side of the car. Porsche was just like, yeah, fine, because it literally kept the lights on at Stuttgart, at Zuffenhausen.\n\nDavid: They're just mortgaging the brand.\n\nDoug: They were desperate. They were completely desperate. When you mentioned the Porsche and Mercedes-Benz relationship. That 500 E was an interesting thing because around Porsche at the time, there were a lot of ways that it could have gone totally wrong.\n\nI went there, and I did a factory tour a couple years ago, and the guy who gave the tour worked there for like 25â30 years through this time period. He said that in his mind and in the mind of a lot of Porsche employees at the time, Mercedes-Benz helped save Porsche. Mercedes could have built that car, but their brothers in Stuttgart down the street were having really tough times. Here's a project that you can work on to keep the factory workers going.\n\nDavid: Wow.\n\nBen: It was literally like you have empty production lines. Even though you're not going to make a lot of margin on this, let's at least...\n\nDavid: You can be our contract manufacturer.\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nDoug: Maybe this was part of the circumstance. You have union contractors, you can pay these people, whatever. You're not going to make money, but we're doing it, and it's something. It's a project for you, it's something.\n\nDavid: We'll keep your lines go instead of losing money on having to pay.\n\nDoug: Right.\n\nDavid: Wow.\n\nDoug: It was a tough era. It was indescribably tough. I think this is lost on a lot of younger people who have only seen Porsche in the world of crazy expensive cars, all the money they charge for colors now, and all that. There was a period where it almost all came to an end.\n\nDavid: Not that long ago.\n\nDoug: Not that long ago. It wasn't like this was in the 50s like, we're alive. This was great stuff.\n\nBen: All right, listeners. Our next sponsor is one of our favorite companies, Vanta. On the last couple of episodes of the season here, we have something very new from them to share. Of course, you know Vanta enables companies to generate more revenue by getting their compliance certifications, that SOC 2, ISO 27001. But the thing that we want to share now is, Vanta has grown to become the best security compliance platform as you hit hypergrowth and scale into a larger enterprise.\n\nDavid: When we first started working with Vanta and met Christina, my gosh, they had a couple of hundred customers, maybe. Now they've got 5000 some of the largest companies out there. It's awesome.\n\nBen: Yeah. They offer a tremendous amount of customization now for more complex security needs. If you're a larger company, and in the past, you showed Vanta to your compliance department, you might have heard something like, oh, well, we've already got a compliance process in place, and we can't integrate this new thing. But now, even if you already have a SOC 2, Vanta makes maintaining your compliance even more efficient and robust.\n\nDavid: They launched vendor risk management. This allows your company to quickly understand the security posture of the vendors that you're choosing in a standardized way that cuts down on security review times. This is great. You can now understand the risk profile of vendors that you are using in your own software stack.\n\nBen: Like the automotive industry that has thousands and thousands of vendors to create a car, wouldn't it be nice to have visibility into the security and compliance posture of all of those companies th"
