        "text": "Working at Daimler (Daimler Benz by 1926) in the 1920's, Ferdinand Porsche designed, and presented, a revolutionary vehicle design. Germany of the 20's and 30's had only one car for every 25 people, having fallen behind in automotive production, though not quality, in the destruction left by World War one and the punitive treaty of Versailles. It was Porsche's dream to produce a vehicle for Germany comparable to the Model T of America, an idea to which Henry Ford responded that, if someone could do the idea of a mass produced car better than he could, it served Ford right.\n\nFerdinand Porsche had been a respected engineer in German for years, beginning at the end of the previous century with the hubcap mounted electric motor combustion engine car, or \"Mixt.\". Moving to purely combustion engines by World War One and beyond, he designed popular racing cars, eventually forming his own Porsche Buro, working with 10 associates on freelance design for the likes of Audi, Horsch and Wanderer.\n\nBy 1932 his idea would come to form in the shape of the VW, seen here in an early sketch. Conceived as a car for every man, Porsche first approached motorcycle makers, since auto makers were reluctant in the fear that mass produced vehicles in Germany would lower prices. Zundapp and NSU backed out of the project, though only after prototypes made for both of the companies allowed for important design improvements, such as the switch to an air cooled engine, based on an earlier Porsche airplane design.\n\nOn January 17, 1934, less than a year after Hitler took power, Porsche presented his plan for a people's car to the Reich, believing that the new road system being constructed to employ Germans after the depression was a sign of the increasing car readiness of the country The regime. Porsche was given 10 months to create a prototype, working with the RDA (Reichsverband der Automobilindustrie), which would have to meet 5 basic criteria.\n\n1. Carry 2 adults and 3 children comfortably\n\n2. Be able to cruise at 100 Kph (60 mph) on the Autobahn (Highway)\n\n3. Have a reliable, air-cooled motor that could achieve 33 mpg\n\n4. Be able to carry 3 soldiers and a machine gun\n\n5. Cost under 1000 RM ($360)"
