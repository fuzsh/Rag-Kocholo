        "text": "The Porsche logo has the Weimar Republic coat of arms of the state of Wurttemberg with the coat of arms of the city of Stuttgart placed as an inescutcheon. Yet, the company’s founder was born in today’s Czech Republic, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The man responsible for creating the iconic first-generation Volkswagen Beetle, among several other things, came a very long way from the town of Vratislavice.\n\nToday, the average senior automotive engineer in most companies likely has a doctorate in engineering. Ferdinand Porsche had no higher studies in his résumé (he had received a couple of an honorary doctorates from the Vienna University of Technology and the University of Stuttgart), yet at the age of 23 developed the electric hub motor that he made his first ever car with.\n\nAnd even more incredibly, the car was a hybrid. Today, the Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid would be described as having independent drive on the front wheels from electric motors charged by a range-extending petrol engine, and likely be considered state-of-the-art. Ferdinand Porsche made this car in 1898. Let that sink in for a second.\n\nQuite weird then that the company bearing Ferdinand Porsche’s name is about to start selling its first hybrid supercar, the Porsche 918, only now, 116 years after the Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid.\n\nNot to forget, he also drove Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria around for a living in the 1900s. It was his one-time passenger’s assassination in Sarajevo that set off World War I.\n\nThis man was the Nicola Tesla of the automotive world. He built his son, also named Ferdinand (but called Ferry to make things a bit easier for the rest of us), a miniature car powered by a scaled-down two-cylinder petrol engine producing 10 horsepower for his ninth birthday. He developed, on Adolf Hitler’s orders, the first Volkswagen, what we know as the Beetle, a car so immensely successful that 20 million units of it were built and continued to be produced until the 1990s in Mexico.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to separate the achievements of Ferdinand Porsche from the rise of the German National Socialist movement. Indeed, Porsche renounced his Czechoslovakian citizenship in 1934 (becoming German) and became a willing member of the Nazi party and a member of the SS, where he attained the rank of oberführer (equivalent to a colonel).\n\nPorsche played a vital role in the German automotive industry too, working with Gottlieb Daimler’s company in Stuttgart, although he was to lose his job after the company merged with Karl Benz’s company to form Daimler-Benz due to creative differences. In the aftermath of that, Porsche worked with Auto Union, the company that was to go on to become Audi.\n\nThat said, a strange legacy of Porsche’s involvement with Daimler-Benz was to be the adoption of the horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine in the iconic 911, known as a “Boxer” engine as the opposed cylinders almost hammer the crankshaft like two pugilists.\n\nIt was Ferry Porsche who carried the family legacy after World War II, first developing the Porsche 356 from leftover parts from the Volkswagen Beetle. This eventually evolved into the Porsche 911, which actually began life as the Porsche 901, but had to change its name due to a trademark dispute with French car maker Peugeot.\n\nSeveral other Porsche cars followed over the years, almost every single one enjoying immense success on the racetrack with some company-backed cars and several private ones winning race after race. Cars wearing Porsche badges have won more than 30,000 races to date. Yet, it took a grandson to not just make Porsche into one of the greatest racing car makers with the 917, but to also make the German car industry the monolith that it is today. And that story starts with the successor to Auto Union, the company whose race cars Ferdinand Porsche developed in the 1930s.\n\nAudi was to be made into one of the world’s leading luxury brands by Ferdinand Porsche’s grandson Ferdinand Piëch. And while Ferdinand Porsche is considered as one of the greatest automotive engineering minds of the 20th century, it is his grandson Piëch, who actually trained as an engineer, who is considered the greatest management minds of the global automotive industry.\n\nOf course, that would be quite unfair to Piëch, who also developed the great Le Mans-winning Porsche 917, and as chief engineer of Audi developed the revolutionary Quattro system (in 1972, it was decided that no direct Porsche-Piëch family member would be involved in the day-to-day operations of Porsche, leading Ferdinand Piëch to go to Audi). A master tactician as chairman of Volkswagen’s supervisory board, he eventually won the Porsche-Volkswagen takeover battle in 2011, leading to the unification of both companies.\n\nThe irony is that Ferdinand Porsche really never lived to see the company that he founded in 1931, mainly as a design consultancy, become the global car maker that it is today. And while it took his Austrian grandson, who was 14 when Porsche died in 1951, to achieve the eventual promise of the family, there is no doubt that Porcshe’s legacy will live on, in such amazing cars such as the Porsche Cayman S."
