        "text": "Few names in the history of the world conjure up the image of speed more potently than that of Ferdinand Porsche, an Austrian-Hungarian engineer who developed the Volkswagen Beetle, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, the first hybrid vehicle, and founded Porsche AG, one of the most legendary automobile companies in world history. His contributions to the automotive world help overshadow his contributions to the Nazi war machine during World War II, but both tales of his life demand to be told. Born in 1875 in Austria-Hungary, land that is now the Czech Republic, Porsche was passionate about technology and electricity from a very young age. He attended classes at the Imperial Polytechnical College a good 3 miles from his home and helped his father work in a mechanical shop when he was not in school. When he was 18, he moved to Vienna to take a job with an electrical company and enrolled as a part-time student at the Vienna University of Technology. While the classes taught him some formal education, his real learning was being done at the company, where he had begun experimenting in his spare time and ultimately built an electric wheel-hub motor which could be applied to the hub of a bicycle and power it directly. He went on to race on this vehicle in 1897. In 1898, he moved to work for Jakob Lohner & Company, which made high-end coaches for royalty through Europe. He started working with Loghner himself on the possibilities of an automobile, but wanted to push beyond the lead-acid batteries that were currently being used. In 1901, the Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid was unveiled, which replaced the batteries with an internal combustion engine that powered a generator that cranked electric wheel hub motors. It was the first-ever electric-petroleum powered vehicle in the history of the world. By 1906, more than 300 of them were sold, and the vehicle clocked in at a top speed of 35 miles per hour, a world record at the time. In 1902, his brilliant career was interrupted when Porsche was drafted into his country’s military service. He was a chauffeur at one point for Archduke Franz Ferndinand, whose assassination more than a decade later would light the blaze that started World War I. After completing his service, Porsche became a hot commodity for burgeoning automotive companies, moving to work for Austro-Daimler as its chief designer, then moving up to managing director in 1916, and earning a honorary doctorate from his old school in Vienna. Porsche was more frequently building racing cards, and successful ones at that. His vehicles won 43 out of 53 races in 1922. He moved to Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft in 1923, which then merged with Benz & Cie to become Mercedes-Benz in 1926. He only worked there a few years before setting off on his own, founding a consulting firm in 1931. He struggled to find customers for any sort of vehicle due to the economic depression gripping the entire world. In 1933, his fortunes seemed to change when he was part of an auto union that was formed at the request of German Chancellor Adolf Hitler, who planned to have every German driving a car of their own. Porsche was put in charge of two projects - a car for the people as well as a high-speed German automotive industry; both sponsored by the government. The people’s car was the Volkswagen Beetle , which he began work on in 1934. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and when Germany invaded Poland in 1939, triggering the start of World War II, Porsche was conscripted into military duty as an engineer. He designed the VK4501 “Tiger” heavy tank, but it was deemed too complicated for the average soldier to drive. When the war ended, Porsche was initially allowed to continue work on the Beetle in France, but was later arrested as a war criminal. The French government ostensibly held him for a ransom of 1 million francs to be released, which the family eventually raised enough money to pay. Sometime later, Porsche and his sons began work on the Porsche 356, the first car with the family name. He initially struggled after World War II to find financial backing or loans from banks given his friendship with Hitler. However, he was able to sell the 356 to several dealers and was later contracted by Volkswagen for consulting work. He received a royalty for every VW sold and eventually gained his fortune several times over. In 1951, he suffered a stroke and died at the age of 75 in Stuttgart, Germany."
