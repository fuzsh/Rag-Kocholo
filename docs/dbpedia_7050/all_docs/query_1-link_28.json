        "text": "Ferdinand A. Porsche, who designed the original Porsche 911, the snazzy, powerful sports car that became the lasting signature of the German automobile company founded by his grandfather and later run by his father, died on Thursday in Salzburg, Austria. He was 76.\n\nPorsche A.G., whose headquarters are in Zuffenhausen, near Stuttgart, Germany, announced the death in a statement. No cause was given.\n\nMr. Porsche, who was known as F. A. and also by the childhood nickname Butzi, was the scion of a family whose roots are entwined with the history of German automaking.\n\nBefore founding the company that still bears his name, Mr. Porsche’s grandfather, Ferdinand, worked as an engineer and designer for, among other companies, Daimler-Benz, the makers of Mercedes. And during the early years of the Porsche company in the 1930s, Ferdinand and his son, known as Ferry, created the prototype of the Volkswagen at the direction of Adolf Hitler.\n\nF. A. Porsche joined the family business in 1958, working in the technical design department essentially as an apprentice, immersing himself in the details of engine construction, aerodynamics and body styling. By that time the company, under his father’s direction, had started along the path that would make it famous by turning out exquisitely engineered, elegantly designed roadsters suitable for the highway or the racetrack.\n\nIt was Ferry Porsche who had turned his own father’s business from strictly an engineering and design company into a manufacturer as well, and he designed its first product, a lightweight rear-engine roadster, the Porsche 356, which was introduced in 1948 and put into wide production in 1950.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
