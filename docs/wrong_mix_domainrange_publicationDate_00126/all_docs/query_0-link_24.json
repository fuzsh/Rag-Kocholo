For me, the one that comes to mind right away is Fifteen Dogs by Andre Alexis. It’s such a fun but thoughtful book written from the perspective of the dogs. I really enjoyed it.\n\nHere is Reddit’s pick:\n- Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions by Edwin Abbott Abbott\n- Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut\n- Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt\n- The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie\n- Life after Life by Kate Aitkinson\n- The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle\n\nHave you read any of these? If yes, which one and what are your thoughts? Is there a book you’d want to suggest?!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#bookstagram #books #bookworm #bookporn #booklover #booknerd #bookcommunity #bookaddict #bookrecommendations #bookblogger #bookobsessed #reddit #redditmemes #redditthread #suggestmeabook  #trending #reel #dailypost #instadaily #instagram #instalike #viral #viralreels #viralpost\".",
