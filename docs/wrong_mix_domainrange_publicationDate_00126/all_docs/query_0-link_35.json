Now that I have done the hoarding for you, you can focus on the latter.\n\nI always enjoy reading others’ lists and browsing their bookshelves, but I’ve always found it odd when people see my collection and say “What a lot of books! Have you read all of them?” Behold my (non-exhaustive) antilibrary that would make Umberto Eco proud. All of them are worth reading, though as always it’s kinda hard to recommend books in the abstract.\n\nDrop me an email if you’ve got recommendations!
