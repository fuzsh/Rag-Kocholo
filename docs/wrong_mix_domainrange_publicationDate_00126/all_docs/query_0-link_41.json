Our own city is such a bounding type of life that some good people even in the United States, who are stiff-jointed, tire of the buzz, the bustle and the rush, and call the atmosphere simply wind.\n\nNow, what the Government proposes to do, and what Chicago has set out to accomplish, is to warm the world up to the blood-heat of youth — to prove that there is bottom to American speed, that we are grateful to those who gave us birth and strength, and that we are not ashamed of our record, but expose it and invite honest criticism. The Western Hemisphere is to be weighed by the Eastern. Particularly are our elders to say whether those lives have been worth the living, which had their second birth when they cut clear of all entangling European alliances. The Great Republic and Republican America are on trial.\n\nAlthough the national act creating the Columbian Exposition provides for an exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mine and sea, the event looms into vaster proportions the nearer we approach it. World's congresses of art, of science, of politics, of philosophy, and of religion, will meet in the throbbing heart of this young nation, and — we will warm them. America shall stretch forth her hand in such a way that the world must grasp it. What is best in the West is to be allied with what is noblest in the East. That is the kind of entangling alliance which is to cap the nineteenth century.\n\n10\n\nEUROPEAN VISITORS.\n\nIt may be, then, that the unofficial, but homely title — the World's Fair — best expresses this idea of national heartiness and warmth. Despite every form of legislation which may tend to separate nation from nation; despite wars and rumors of wars, despite famine and pestilence, the European fathers of the Columbian era shall be drawn to the city which the Government has chosen as their host. They shall be overcome by a storm of kindnesses. As they are, therefore, destined to visit us, it is a pleasure to pave the way to a sociable and profitable season by throwing out some information about the characters, the connections and the homes of our coming guests. In the twinkling of an eye, after April 30, 1893, they will be in Chicago. The world will be here. No time then to pick up convenient information about our visitors from Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, Holland, or Russia. So that now — or rather in this book — the past and present of these people will be pictured. When we meet them at the Exposition they will not then be a mass of strangers to be hurriedly assorted, but so many select companies of friends.\n\nAs the prime object of the Columbian Exposition, also, is to celebrate the four hundredth anniversary of the Discovery of America, we have organized our tiny World's Fair upon the historic basis. Spain was the father of the New World; Italy its mother. Italy gave birth to Columbus, Vespucius, John Cabot and other discoverers of minor fame; Spain sent forth Columbus and Vespucius, and also Sebastian Cabot, after England had withdrawn from the field of Western discoveries. Portugal shares with Spain the honor of revealing to the world the southern portion of the Western Hemisphere. The discoverer of Brazil was a Portuguese, and Vespucius made two voyages in the employ of the Portuguese, during one of which he planted the first colony of America, on the southeastern coast of that country. There were French fishermen in the Gulf of St. Lawrence before the Cabots sighted any portion of her shores; and four years after the Cabots announced their discoveries of northern lands, a ship loaded with Portuguese adventurers went down in the icy waters of Hudson Bay. After the early Spanish and Portuguese discoveries, the next great advance was made by France, who, through an Italian navigator, gave us the Atlantic coast line of the United States. England was still in the background as a discoverer, and so she continued for many years. Take note, therefore, that we\n\n11\n\nintroduce the European nations in the general order of their introduction to us, viz.: (1) the great discoverers — the Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese and Frenchmen; (2) the great colonizers — the Englishmen, Scandinavians, Germans and Dutch, with the Russians thrown in as representatives of an empire which stretches from Germany almost to our own, and which claims those savages of Siberia who are so closely connected with the natives of Northwestern America. Furthermore, the Russians first showed us Alaska, and then sold it to us. We surely do not need to strain a point in order to pass the Russian into the European department of the World's Fair. WHAT OF OUR NORTHMEN?\n\n\"But what of the Vikings, or Scandinavian sea-kings? Did they not sight the shores of Northeastern America, plant their feet there, and even establish a colony, five centuries before Columbus saw land?\"\n\nThe above queries are indignantly put by scholars and lovers of justice throughout the country.\n\nGranted that they did, and that Columbus during his visit to Iceland, in 1477, carefully examined the documents relating to those discoveries stored in the monastery of Helgafell. For a century and a half before he came, no Norse ship had sailed between Iceland and America, but since his coming, communication between the Old World and the New has never ceased; the Columbian era, which we celebrate, has been one of uninterrupted discovery and growth.\n\nFrom the Icelandic port which Columbus visited had gone forth, to Greenland and stranger lands, some of the most famous of Scandinavian explorers. The social, pleasure-loving Icelanders still repeated the old sagas, which detailed these voyages and told of the exile to Greenland of the murderous leader, Erik the Red; the going with him of his Norwegian companion, Herjulf; and the search of Bjarni for his father Herjulf. Bjarni was in Norway at the time his father left his home in Iceland and cast his fortunes with Erik the Red. In the days of Columbus, the people still told of the wild lands of ice and wood, the beautiful shores and pitiless seas which Bjarni had seen to the South, to which he had been driven and over which he had scudded before the contrary winds. Their blue eyes lighted with national pride and their gigantic forms grew firmer as they heard from the story singers how Leif, the son of Erik, was most scornful when Bjarni returned to his father without having had the hardihood to set foot upon the soil of\n\n12\n\nthese unknown lands; and how the fearless Leif sailed where Bjarni had been driven, and placed his foot and his men upon shores which he called Helluland (flat-land), Markland (wood-land) and Vinland (vine-land).\n\nThere is nothing in any of Columbus' biographies to prove that he knew of the Scandinavian discoveries, or of previous voyages, alleged to have been made by Irishmen and Welshmen, to a country further south, which was called Great Ireland. But it is most natural that he should have heard of tales which formed so large a part of the national literature of Iceland. It is probable, however, that they made little impression upon his mind. Columbus was looking for the golden East, the land of spices — not a land of mingled ice and wood. In all likelihood, he reasoned that in order to reach the western passage he would have to sail to the south of Great Ireland. It is evident, when, through his brother, he applied to Henry VII. of England for assistance, that he contemplated sailing in a westerly direction from Great Britain, and possibly coasting down the shores of Vinland and Great Ireland in his search for the passage to the Indies. The man who had made the discovery of new lands the study of his life, and had read widely, corresponded widely, and traveled widely, undoubtedly knew of these western\n\n13\n\ndiscoveries; for the romances relating to many of them had been in native manuscript since the twelfth century, and even before then Adam of Bremen the German priest and historian, in his account of the spread of the Catholic religion over the countries of the North, had mentioned Vinland as a country to the west which (upon the authority of a Danish king) the Icelanders had discovered. It is also in evidence that during the first portion of the twelfth century a Roman Catholic bishop was appointed to preside over the western country. The information that something had been discovered to the west of Europe had been the common property of the well informed for several centuries before Columbus' time, but whatever it was, no one believed that it could cut any figure in the world, and during the latter part of the fifteenth century neither Italian nor German geographers dreamed that the Scandinavian discoveries were to be connected in any way with the Indian problem.\n\nEven after the oldest Sagas, or national songs of Iceland, have been translated and studied for two centuries by some of the keenest scholars in the world, there are comparatively few who are bold enough to locate the place where Leif Erikson landed (1000 A.D.), where Thorfinn and his three ship loads of emigrants planted a colony of lumbermen, hunters and farmers, in 1007, and which for two hundred and forty years was the seaport of these Northmen, from which they shipped lumber, fish and furs. The region around Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, was for years specially favored by earnest Scandinavian scholars; but consternation was carried into their ranks when a well-known professor, E.N. Horsford, set out to prove from the ancient Sagas that the site of the city of Norumbega, where all these industries\n\n14\n\nwere located, with their dams, and docks, and wharves, could be no other than the city of Watertown, at the head of tide water, on the Charles river, Massachusetts.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Northmen of Iceland visited the shores of America, but their romantic Sagas are dangerous geographical guides. Even should no other regions than those around Narragansett, or Boston Bay, answer the descriptions of Thorfinn's settlement, the ravages of the Black Plague placed an embargo upon the ships of the Vikings, which was never broken. Denmark also absorbed Norway, and Iceland with it. Plagues raged, volcanoes spouted, and the royal masters forbade the Norsemen of Iceland to have commerce with any foreign country. Had it not been for pestilence, volcano and royal command, by which a misty bond of union between Iceland and America was snapped, we might now be celebrating the Eriksonian instead of the Columbian era.\n\nSome, however, who are not satisfied with commencing the era of our civilization with poor, abused, deluded, brave Columbus, point to the very name Norumbega, which so long adorned the maps, as a proof that we should consider ourselves the children of Norway and of Iceland. Various localities in Rhode Island indicate a Norse origin — so they say. Norbega is the ancient name of Norway; but the Algonquin Indians, owing to a radical defect in their speech, were obliged to pronounce the country of the Norsemen, Nor'mbega, or Norumbega. But the advocates of a previous Celtic discovery of both Iceland and America find traces of the old British tongue and of the old British blood among the Indians of North America, Mexico and Central America. Our friends sometimes do allow that when they run down a Celtic word, or a blue eye, in an Indian wigwam, that it may be accounted for by the voyages of Prince Madoc and his followers, of Wales, who, according to the native bards, did not reach the far West until the twelfth century. As to the simple priority of discovering something, somewhere on the eastern coasts of North America, previous to the Columbian era, the fight seems to be between the Norse and the Irish champions.\n\nANCIENT AMERICAN FATHERS.\n\nBut was America first approached from the east? It is the most improbable theory that could be advanced; for, during the earliest historic ages of the world, the wealth and commerce of the universe were Asiatic and African. The geographical, the commercial and the enterprising families were the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, the Indians and the\n\n15\n\nChinese. For centuries the Phoenicians were the carriers of the ancient world, bringing gold and spices from Eastern Africa and Asia.\n\nThe Egyptians were the mathematicians, the astronomers, the geographers who recorded all the discoveries and, like other journalists, they were subject to fits of romancing, when, in spite of all their travels and their pains, they could not obtain reliable information. Like the Chinese and the Japanese, they knew they were very ancient and were so proud of it that they sometimes invented history in order to put flesh upon their vast genealogical skeleton. When compared to the Egyptians, the Greeks were the veriest infants. This truth was forcibly impressed in the tales told by the solemn old priests of Egypt to such striplings as Solon and Herodotus, who came to the hoary land filled with the importance of their own country. When Egypt told of one of her dynasties which covered a period of more than 10,000 years, the Greeks doubtless paused for breath. When she coolly set out to prove that her first great ruler commenced his sway fully 249,000 years before their time, the Greek representatives doubtless had some of the conceit taken out of them. And before that calm, wise, solemn, bushy-browed old Egyptian priest narrated the story of Atlantis to Solon, the Athenian law-giver, he exclaimed: \"Solon, Solon, you Greeks are but children, and an aged Greek there is none!\" The tale was that 9,000 years previous there was a pathway of islands between Gibraltar and a vast Western Continent. One of these islands was held by so powerful a nation of warriors that they were about to invade Western Europe, when their land was plunged beneath the sea. The great Atlantis was lost, but it dissolved into such a body of mud as to forever make the ocean impassable and prevent one from reaching the Western Continent.\n\nThus the story of Atlantis got into circulation and a Western Continent came first to be mentioned to Europeans; and the tale had much to do with keeping before their eyes the picture of a vast, dark, haunted impassable Western Sea, which was their nightmare until Columbus opened their eyes. But the Eastern Seas had been sailed by Phoenicians and Egyptians centuries before the tale of Atlantis was ever breathed into the startled ear of a European; and there are leaders of cliques who find in the antiquities of Mexico, Central and South America, Phoenician letters, Egyptian hieroglyphics and Indian elephant heads; who are convinced, especially that the Montezumas whom Cortes conquered had Egyptian faces, as well as the Incas, whom Pizarro subdued. They find evidences, also, on monuments and elsewhere, that these mysterious Americans held Ethiopians as slaves. Very well, for the sake of peace\n\n16\n\nat the Columbian Exposition, let it be granted that the ruling classes in the empires of Mexico and Peru were descendants of Phoenician and Egyptian colonists. Those who refuse to believe in such a possibility, who even reject Atlantis and yet are lovers of old age, may fall in with that other class, who turn upon all these special pleaders and shout: \"You know nothing about your Indians, your mound builders, your Mexicans or your Peruvians. They are products of American soil and have nothing to do with Africa, Asia or Atlantis. Like Topsy, they just grew. America is the Old World. Geology proves it. Asia was peopled by America.\"\n\nThe Malays, too, have their patrons. In the early times, the brown-skinned sailors were bolder than they are now. Their boats were vessels in size and general appearance, venturing hundreds of miles from land. It is said \"they used to construct decked vessels capable of carrying one or two hundred persons, with water and stores sufficient for a voyage of some weeks' duration. These vessels were made of planks well fitted and sewn together, the joints being calked and pitched. It is only in recent times that the construction of such vessels has ceased. The people had a knowledge of the stars, of the rising and setting of the constellations at different seasons of the year. By this means they determined the favorable season for making a voyage and directed their course.\" These facts and many others relating to the forefathers of the Malays are derived from a mass of historic legends which are still current among the people.\n\nThe remains of massive structures of uncemented stone, found in the islands of the Pacific archipelagos, even Malayan tradition does not attempt to explain. From near Japan to the Easter Island — to within two thousand miles of the western shores of America, some mighty people has placed its monuments, colossal stone platforms, and gigantic statues, as marks of its advance eastward. These may be evidences that the modern natives are the degenerate race of these ancient builders. At all events it is natural that the nautical Malays, after they had reached the easternmost islands, should have ventured beyond them, or been driven to the shores of America. For centuries, Japanese barks have been thrown upon the Northern American coasts, and the geographical conditions are all favorable for a constant interchange of people between Northeastern Siberia and Northwestern America.\n\nAll of which is sufficient excuse, if there were no other, for the introduction of the Egyptians, the Syrians (who occupy ancient Phoenicia), the Malays, the Japanese and the Siberians. Further, of all\n\n17\n\nthe empires of the far East, Japan is the most worthy of being closely bound to America. She is of to-day as well as of yesterday. She will be seen at the Fair in all her wealth of decorative art. Egypt and China shall stand forth as an impressive contrast to modern civilization. In Australia an Anglo-Saxon state is crowding the remnants of barbarism into the desert and out of existence. India, on the other hand, is being breathed upon by the Anglo-Saxon, and is giving back to Europe and America various philosophies which were musty to her before he was born. And that is not all the excuse we have for acquainting the friends of the Exposition with the natives of India. Buddhism was born in India, and after being killed there by Brahmanism spread to Ceylon, Farther India, China, Central Asia, Northern Asia and America.\n\nStill preserved in the imperial archives of China is an account of a Buddhist priest, Hwui Shan, who, upon returning to China from the distant eastern country of Fusang, in 499 A.D., related to the emperor what he had seen on the way to that strange land and in the country itself, as well as the distance and the route thither. Other historians take up the matter, becoming more and more definite as the centuries pass, a certain writer of the seventh century being so precise as to put all the Scandinavian romances to the blush. The Chinese distances are computed in li, which widely vary during different dynasties, but patient investigators have taken the trouble to ascertain the equivalent of the measurement at the time the various accounts were written, and unhesitatingly say that about the middle of the fifth century a party of Buddhist monks, of which Hwui Shan was one, sailed from China along its eastern coast, rounded Corea, took a northeasterly direction toward the southern point of Kamtchatka and the lower waters of Behring Sea to Alaska, and skirted the western shores of North America to Mexico.\n\nENTER THE AMERICAS.\n\nHaving introduced in the World's Fair those people who are connected by tradition, by historic evidence, or by both, with the discovery of America, or who will be with us, as friends and co-workers, in 1893, we next present (in the printed page) the native races of the Western Hemisphere. The engrafted European civilization is here kept in the background. The glorious Columbian era is brought out in the picture of the Exposition; now, also, the United States, the grandest product of the Discovery, comes from its chrysalis. In the superb features of the Columbian Exposition, may be read the history of the great republic, and a simple hint be gained of its unutterable possibilities.\n\n18\n\nTHE CHANCE OF FOUR CENTURIES.\n\nNever before since Columbus was in chains and died in misery has the world been provided with such an occasion to right his wrongs. Every intelligent person sees that there must have been many — very many — pre-Columbian discoveries. Hwui Shan and Leif Erikson may have wrongs which should be righted. But we do not celebrate their discoveries, because nothing came of them. America was born the moment Columbus set foot upon an isle in the West Indies. The child did not die an infant, but the world has seen it continuously grow to gigantic youthhood.\n\nAll honor and glory to the Columbian Exposition. Show to the world what Americans think of Columbus and his work. Vindicate him before the universe. Let everything for the moment revolve around that care-worn central figure. Crown him! Shout his praises! Let us warm the world, not only toward America, but toward the father of America.\n\n19\n\nThe Spaniards.\n\nTHE BASQUES.\n\nTHERE are many speculations afloat regarding the Basques, who principally inhabit the three provinces which form a triangle in Northwestern Spain, its base being the Bay of Biscay on the north. At least several groups of scholars have settled upon a common theory that the gypsies originally came from Northern India, but although the Basques have never been really dislodged from their mountain homes and have seen the barbarians of Europe moulded into such peoples as the German, English and French, and have withstood tides of conquest which have swept over their country from the three continents, the knotty point as to their origin is so far from being settled that scarcely half a dozen philologists and historians have reached the same conclusion. The provinces which they now occupy in Spain constitute the ancient Cantabria, which native historians claim had as its pioneers Tubal, the son of Japhet, and his family. From this point spread the aboriginal population of Europe. They furthermore claim that they speak the very language which Noah received from Adam. Certain it is that their language is peculiarly their own. They call themselves \"Euscaldunac,\" their country \"Euscaleria\" and their language \"Euscara.\"\n\nThe Basques have been named as remnants of the people of the Lost Atlantis, as Tartars, Huns, Finns, Phoenicians, Berbers, Latins, and Iberians, who occupied the peninsula of France and Spain when the Celts invaded the country. From the subsequent fusion of Iberians (whoever they were) with the Celts arose the Celtiberians, who often were the enemies and sometimes the friends of ancient Rome. With them the mountaineers, or Basques, found it convenient to league themselves. Augustus Caesar directed his troops against the Cantabrians. One of his armies was nearly starved, and a second narrowly escaped an ambuscade among the mountains. He was harassed on all sides by the hardy aborigines, and at one time retired in disgust. But Rome\n\n20\n\nwas stubborn as well as great. The towns of the Basques were burned and they retreated to the mountains to watch the conflagrations and wait for the Romans to attack them there. They fought like wild cats in the mountains, those who were captured submitting with grim determination to the most fearful tortures. The Romans built their forts among the mountains and the Basques attacked them from their natural fortifications. No Roman force could sally forth without being surprised by its unconquerable enemies. New confederations of the native warriors were formed. A whole Roman army was destroyed. The confederation was crushed for the time being, and thousands of prisoners marched in chains to Rome. Many of them escaped, returned to the Pyrenees and formed a new league. This was dispersed by Agrippa. At length the Celtiberians became subjects of Rome, leaving the Cantabrians still intrenched in the Western Pyrenees. They assisted the Romans against the Gallic tribes and were defeated by the Goths on the plains of Navarre. But neither Goth, Vandal nor Moor dare pursue them to the mountains as did the Roman. They cut the Saracens to pieces and when Charlemagne's victorious army retired from the Ebro, his rear guard was attacked in a rocky valley and many of his bravest noblemen killed by the Basques. This brought upon them a series of conflicts, but the great King of the Franks could not crush them.\n\nThe Basque provinces became allies of Castile and Aragon, and were incorporated into the kingdom, but they formed a confederation of small republics and with Navarre insisted for eight centuries upon retaining their fueros, or charters, from the imperial government, by which they were guaranteed home rule and exempted from duties on imported merchandise and all royal monopolies. They were not subject to conscription for the royal army and no royal troops entered their land without the permission of the home authorities. Even during the reigns of Charles V. and Philip II. these provinces, in spite of imperial encroachments upon popular government in other provinces, stood forth as a brave democracy within a kingdom. Until they organized the Don Carlos rebellion against the reigning house, the Basques continued to enjoy their bill of rights, but this act resulted, by the war which closed in 1876, in its final abolition.\n\nWhen these distinguished sons of the Pyrenees (for each Basque is a noble) are not proudly and unflinchingly defending their homes and their rights, a variety of occupations are open to them. They are said to be the first of the Europeans who went fishing for whales, and even now their fisheries upon the coast employ many people. It was from this coast that\n\n21\n\nthe fishermen and explorers went forth (so claim their descendants) to discover Newfoundland. The assumption of the Venetian Cabots, father and son, whom history has credited with the discovery, is boldly scouted by the proud Cantabrians.\n\nMetals and marbles of various kinds vein their hills, and they are miners. A simple spade or fork is about the only agricultural implement with which they cultivate their small farms of four or five acres. Wheat, barley and maize are harvested. Although the soil of the valleys even is not very rich, the Basque peasant is industrious and his lands will compare favorably with those in other portions of the kingdom. His hills are covered with oak, beech and chestnut, generally to the very summit. The climate is mild and salubrious, and the country is picturesque.\n\nBesides being unlike any of the dialects of Southern Europe, the Basque language is so difficult to learn that there is a popular legend to the effect that Satan spent seven years in studying it and thoroughly mastered but three words. One might believe the story and admire his ability after being confronted with such native monstrosities as these: Izarysaroyarenlurrearenbarena, or \"the center of the mountain road,\" and Azpilcuetagaraycosaroyarenberecolarrea, or \"the lower ground of the high hill of Azpilcueta.\" The Basques are of a poetic turn. Their bards attend the huskings and salute the washerwomen on the banks of the streams and the peasants at their plows, improvising pastorals and telling stories and legends. Their theatres are built out from the mountains, and native tragedies and comedies are acted, which are pronounced remarkably vigorous and fresh. The poets also are honored with festivals, in which they are escorted by a procession of horsemen in rich uniforms and great bear-skin caps, by musicians and dancers, to a platform or theatre, where they are happy to show their powers. Their amusements, such as their pastoral dramas, are of a national character, the subjects being taken from the Bible, from Grecian mythology and even from Ottoman sources. Their dances, also, are institutions of the country such as the Olympian games in Greece. Formerly the priests took Part in the excitements of the dance and the women were excluded; now their positions are reversed.\n\nSuch gatherings as these draw the Basques from plain, valley and mountain — the women with their superb masses of brown hair, their small hands and feet, and the men with their massive features, firm mouths, black eyes and dignified bearing. The peasant appears in his gala dress — a blue cap, dark velvet breeches, a red scarf around his loins and a gorgeous vest, while his pear tree-stick, pointed with iron, is slung by a cord to his wrist.\n\n22\n\nThe most favorite manly sport is hunting the wild pigeon. \"High up in the tallest trees of the forest, huts of branches are constructed. These huts, around which are arranged decoys, which are made to flutter whenever a flock of pigeons is signaled, accommodate from four to six huntsmen, each one stationed in front of a loop-hole made so as to afford an enfilading shot, which will kill a number of birds at once. At the sound of the chief's whistle, there is a simultaneous fire and great is the carnage. In some quarters great nets are stretched among the trees, and the birds, scared by the rattles and by the decoy hawks of wood and feathers which are thrown at them, quicken their flight and rush helplessly into the snares.\"\n\nIGNATIUS LOYOLA.\n\nIt is in the land of the Basques that Ignatius Loyola, the ardent, brave and worldly soldier, first saw this strange world so filled with transforming influences; for the young soldier, fighting against the French, was wounded in both legs and was borne to his ancestral castle near the modern town of Azpeitia. Having exhausted his large supply of romances, the incapacitated soldier, in sheer desperation, fell back upon the \"Lives of the Saints.\" But his active soul was fired, and from that time on, by a thorough course of study, by a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, traveling generally on foot as a mendicant monk, by every possible course of thought, self-denial and industry he prepared himself to become the founder of that military order of Jesuits whose motto, P. A. C., indicates the complete submersion of the individual into the body; for P. A. C. (Perinde ac Cadaver) is \"just like a corpse\" and every Jesuit is sworn to obey the orders of his superior, as though he were clay in the potter's hands.\n\nThe scene of Loyola's conversion is now a vast monastery, whose great dome is brought out with severe distinctness against a rocky mount, a short distance beyond. The unfinished wings of the mass of buildings give the imaginative, from a distance, the impression of a huge, imperfect eagle. Entering the vestibule from the peristyle, which has a semi-circular front of black marble, plaster statues of Loyola, Xavier and other prominent Jesuits are observed. Passing into the church beneath figures of the Virgin and cherubs, one finds himself in a square, cold marble hall. \"From the vestibule a door on one side opens into an arched passage, one side of which is formed by the house of Loyola, built of rough brick, and bearing over the door the inscription in gold letters on a black marble slab: ‘Family house of Loyola.’ Here St. Ignacio was born in 1491. Here, having been visited by St. Peter and by the most Holy Virgin,\n\n23\n\nhe gave himself to God in 1521.\" The apartment in which they are said to have appeared to Loyola forms an inner chapel of the church and is a shrine to which thousands of the devout repair. Besides the inscription which has been noticed, the escutcheon of the Loyola family appears upon another marble slab, it being two wolves disputing over a cauldron suspended by a chain. The unfinished portion of the left wing of the monastery consists of a simple wall, which is built in front of the castle or house of the Saint. SPANISH GYPSIES.\n\nFrom the Pyrenees to Granada the Spanish gypsy is on his travels camping by Phoenician, Carthaginian, Iberian, Roman, Gothic and Moorish fortresses; penetrating to Madrid with smugglers and horse-thieves, but not of them; wandering from Madrid to pick up the great mules of Western Spain and selling and trading them over again, curing men and horses of various distempers; dancing, singing in Seville; camping in the rocky caves within a stone's throw of historic Granada; tinkering, pilfering, fortune-telling — the Spanish gypsy is the gypsy of the world, the professional tramp who is not a vagrant, for he always has some ostensible means of support.\n\nSeville, the birthplace of Murillo, the greatest of Spanish painters, whose masterpieces adorn the walls of its grand churches, is also the headquarters of the gypsy musicians and dancers. Here will be found many settled people of their race, as in other towns of Spain. But the gypsy dancing girl is the interesting member of their community — she who exhibits to the eyes of Spain the harmony of the Hindu maiden and the Egyptian guitar, and glides about to the strains of old Grecian and Phoenician melodies. Little children are brought up to the same\n\n24\n\nperfection by ambitious elders, sometimes venerable grandmothers, who encourage their tiny bare feet with the guitar or castanets.\n\nIt is not always for show and gain that the gypsies exhibit their accomplishments. Their marriage festivals are particularly boisterous and devoted to merry-making — music, song and dance. They have, also, their rude poets, whose themes are not always such as would commend themselves to classical tastes. Cattle-stealings, prison adventures and other incidents of wandering gypsy life, with tender bits of love ditties and pastoral scenes, quaint scraps and catches, are various themes and elements of their verse-making.\n\nOn account of the disorganized condition of society in Spain, much of the time, her gypsies, when they permanently take to travel, are among the most reckless and unprincipled of their race. They frequently encamp near remote villages, and when they have consumed and stolen everything they can, pass on to the next. Frequently they are driven away by the authorities. Then the women and children mount the lean asses of the band, ragged and long-haired men goading and beating the poor animals to increase their speed, the rear of the uncouth cavalcade being guarded by a small party on strong horses, armed with guns and sabres, and now and then defiantly blowing a hoarse blast upon their horns.\n\nCADIZ.\n\nFrom the Basque provinces to Cadiz, on the Southwestern Spanish coast, is from ancient land to ancient city; but as Cadiz is the great starting point of foreign colonization and foreign conquest, and as here was taken the next chronological step in the settlement of Spain, it is well to rest awhile at the little city by the ocean, standing there square, trim and clean. It is surrounded by a wall, its houses are built of white stone, and from the water sides, for it is upon a long narrow isthmus of an island, nothing can be more fresh in the shape of a city. Cadiz has strong sea and land fortifications, and its fine harbor has been the scene of conflicts between the Spaniards, English and French, between the Spaniards, Moors, Goths, Romans, Carthaginians and Phoenicians. The Phoenicians founded it over three centuries before the founding of Rome and the ruins of one of their temples is there. From Phoenician to Carthaginian, from Carthaginian to Roman, from Roman to Vandal, from Vandal to Goth, from Goth to Moor, before they all were merged into the Spaniard, is the usual order of ownership for the sea-ports of Spain and for most of the country, varied somewhat by the position of the district.\n\n25\n\nCARTHAGE IN SPAIN.\n\nAcross Southern Spain, on the Mediterranean is another fortified town built on a plain surrounded by hills, the city stretching down to the sea. The entrance to its spacious harbor is narrow and is commanded by the fortifications on an island to the south. Its old streets, its old cathedral and its ruined castle on the hill are Moorish in the extreme, but the Moors only restored that city to something of its former magnificence, which was the stronghold of the Carthaginians on the northern coast of the Mediterranean, and which was stormed and captured by the Romans 210 B.C. Thirty years previous it had been named New Carthage, and was designed as the Carthaginians' base of operations in Europe against the Romans. Before that time Phoenicians had planted a fortress and a lighthouse upon a rock overhanging the city, in whose sides these bold colonists had found numerous caves in which lived the savage aborigines. Under Rome it was a city of wealth and importance, 40,000 men being employed in the neighboring mines of Tharsis, which formed the attraction of the Phoenicians. The Goths sacked the city, and even under Spanish rule it was the largest naval arsenal in Europe. But now the place is dilapidated, its dockyards and arsenal are deserted, and only a few walls remain of the Carthaginian fortress held by the family of Hannibal, or of the lighthouse which guided the ships to the Tarshish of Scripture, lying at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River.\n\n\"Local tradition declares that a superb piece of tapestry in the old dismantled cathedral was brought back from the Indies by Christopher Columbus on his first voyage, and was suspended there by him as a grateful recognition of God's mercy, in the presence of Ferdinand and Isabella. This is not quite exact. The truth seems to be that the tapestry was paid for by the gold which Columbus brought back with him, and that it represents the birds and beasts, the fruits and flowers of the New World, as far as he could describe them. That it was suspended by Columbus seems certain, attested as it is by the familiar escutcheon and legend which are placed over it. It will scarcely be credited that the cathedral is rapidly falling into ruins, and that the tapestry is rotting from the walls.\"\n\nSPANISH MOROCCO.\n\nThe territory lying between these ancient towns and between the Guadalquivir River and the Mediterranean Sea is what may be called the Morocco of Spain. In Granada (which was the last of the Moslem\n\n26\n\nkingdoms to fall) and Castile are, in fact, to be found about 60,000 people who have kept their Moorish blood singularly pure, being known as Modejars. Despite the Inquisition, the banishments and burnings, the Moors not only remain, but they have impressed many of their customs upon the country.\n\n\"In Toledo, in Cordova, in Granada, or in the older parts of Seville, it would be easy to believe oneself in a Moorish or Egyptian town. The narrow streets are inclosed by high walls, almost windowless, and perforated by only a single low door. Everything looks gloomy and sombre. But peep through the iron grating which protects the doorway, and you will see a patio bright with flowers and fountains and greenery. The windows of the chambers open into this quadrangle, and the inmates can enjoy light and air, bright sunshine and cool shade, without leaving the seclusion of their houses or being exposed to the gaze of any not belonging to the family. This style of architecture has been handed down directly from the Moors. And in numberless details of dress and daily life the same influence may be traced. The mantilla which forms the head-dress of almost every woman in Spain, is simply a relic of the veil universally worn by the wives and daughters of the Moslem. Wander into the outskirts of any town in Spain, and you will hardly fail to stumble upon groups of ragged, picturesque varlets, lying at full length upon some sunny bank, sunning themselves just as a group of Bedouins would do. Go out into the country, and you will hear the creaking of the waterwheel and see the patient oxen treading their ceaseless round, turning the ponderous machine, which has come down unchanged from the days of the Moors. The peasants of Andalusia, Murcia and Granada are seldom to be seen without a long staff, which they grasp and carry exactly as an Arab does his spear. The velvet hat of the Spanish majo is clearly a reminiscence of the turban. In private houses, hotels and cafιs servants are summoned by clapping the hands as in the Arabian Nights.\"\n\nIn the mettle, grace and docility of the horses of Andalusia, also, are seen the strong points of the Arabian steeds. Since the country was stocked by the Moors with their finest breeds they have somewhat degenerated; still enough specimens of the famous stock remain to remind one of the Moorish rule. Since the decline in wealth and magnificence of the Spanish nobility, the demand for blooded horses has decreased. The celebrated breed of the sovereigns of Spain at Cordova is nearly extinct, and the wealthiest Andalusian nobles have only a few saddle horses. The noble Arabian steed, the pride of the Moor and the native sheik, is disappearing before the mules and asses which are used for\n\n27\n\ndomestic, agricultural and transportation purposes. Immense droves of these animals are continually passing from Old Castile, where they are bred, to the rich pastures of Estremadura, where they are reared, and supplied to the rest of Spain, principally for transportation purposes. The asses even rival those of Egypt, being sure-footed, strong and docile, and nearly equal in size to the mules. SEVILLE.\n\nIn fact, from Seville and the banks of the Guadalquivir to the Mediterranean Sea, the Arabs of Morocco have buried Phoenician, Roman and Gothic civilizations. Although the native place of the Roman Emperors Trajan, Adrian and Theodosius, called by Caesar Little Rome, and adorned by great edifices worthy of a favorite child of the empire, Seville is a purely Moorish city. The capital of Southern Spain during the ascendency of the Vandals and the Goths, it is still distinctively Moorish. A few miles away are the ruins of a magnificent Roman amphitheatre — all that remains of the palaces and ambitious structures of half a dozen Roman emperors and conquerors.\n\nTime has not buried Rome completely out of sight, here in Moorland. Massive stones of the amphitheatre now confine the waters of the Guadalquivir and appear in the walls of a neighboring convent, while during the five centuries that the Moors held Seville the city was rebuilt from the materials of former Roman edifices. Certain quarters of the city have not been changed, and one may there find cool shadows cast across the narrow, crooked streets, from spacious mansions, with ample courts and gardens. Attached to the mighty Spanish cathedral of Seville is a remarkable Moorish tower, to which a lofty pinnacle has been added since the city came under the Spanish rule. The tower formerly was part of a great Mohammedan mosque. It is now a portion of the Catholic church, within which are paintings by Murillo, whose house may be seen from it. Surmounting the pinnacle, 350 feet from the ground, is a female figure in bronze, fourteen feet high, which serves as a weather-vane and which is so nicely poised that it is swerved by the slightest breeze.\n\nThe Alcazar, originally a Moorish palace, has been remodeled until it is a rival of the Alhambra in delicate ornamentation. It is the royal residence, and a royal one, truly. At a little distance from the palace is an octagonal tower, partly Moorish and partly Roman in its architecture; it is called the Tower of Gold. One story is that Columbus stored therein the first American gold; on the other hand, it is alleged that the name was given to it long before Columbus ever set sail from Palos.\n\n28\n\nBut the Seville of to-day is not the capital of a Moorish kingdom with half a million people. Although when Ferdinand of Castile passed in as a conqueror, 300,000 Moors passed out, bound for Granada and Africa, it continued a great city until the discovery of America, when it almost reached its former plane of prosperity. Cadiz afterwards seized its trade, and with the decline of Spain as a commercial power Seville fell with it. It is still a beautiful city, surrounded by Moorish walls and Moorish towers.\n\nSeville was, furthermore, the headquarters of the Inquisition in Spain, but it was not until the Reformation, from Germany, commenced to send its New Testaments into Spain and make converts that it was brought to bear with such shocking cruelty upon the people. Single executions were thought inadequate to suppress the heresy, and the autos da fι, or public burnings, were inaugurated at Valladolid and Seville, and spread over the land. Barcelona, Cordova, and others had, also, their gloomy prisons of the Inquisition filled with heretics until emptied by the autos da fι. Ten years of such vigorous war stamped out Protestantism.\n\nCORDOVA.\n\nAscending the river from Seville, a mass of sad-looking buildings is occasionally seen through the intervening groves of palm and olive trees. The road to the city is through gardens of roses, oranges, oleanders, with all the foliage of the Orient to give them a rich shading. As Cordova is approached — so long the capital and center of the great Moorish empire — its wall even has a patched and dejected air, traces of Roman, Gothic and Moorish workmanship being found in it. Cordova was for three centuries one of the grandest centers of commerce and of a civilization far in advance of the rest of Europe; a sublime city of mosques, hospitals, schools and palaces, the banks of the Guadalquivir being lined with extensive gardens in which were innumerable fountains, palm trees, and Oriental pavilions. Cordova was the metropolis of the industrious race which made Southern Spain bloom like a garden; which laid out her rich plains into sugar, rice and cotton plantations; which brought in chemistry, paper, elegant manufactures, and the numerical system which we use to-day. Each garden whose orange and citron groves were reflected in the clear waters of the Guadalquivir was the haunt of the botanist Like the Jews, the Moors were famous physicians. They taught medicine, astronomy, mathematics and philosophy when the rest of Europe was just emerging from primitive ignorance, so that the schools of Cordova educated the Christians of all nations, who sought the\n\n29\n\nlearning of the East which the Arabs had brought from Egypt, India, Persia and Asia Minor, via Morocco. The expulsion of the Moors and the Jews was a blow to Spain whose effects can never be entirely counteracted.\n\nThe only striking architectural monument of this great empire which remains in its now lifeless capital is a superb mosque, which was built by the first caliph of the Spanish Moors after they rebelled against the rule of the Damascus princes. This able and amiable monarch, sheltered by the Bedouins of Arabia and Africa from his Damascus enemies, was chosen by the sheiks as the leader of the Moors in Spain. It was in the middle of the eighth century that he landed on the coast of Andalusia, and commenced his triumphal march to Seville and Cordova. In his person were united the performances of the future. He it was who transplanted the palm into Spain. His mosque absorbed the talent and skill of the most expert architects, masons and workmen among the Arabs and Jews — in fact, the genius of the age was lavished upon its interior. To inspire enthusiasm, as well as to instill a spirit of humility and piety into the work, its princely founder is said to have daily labored with hod and trowel. Marbles came to form its beauties from the ancient temples of Europe, Asia and Africa, and when all was ready the Islam monarch looked upon what might be a stately grove of palm trees, their trunks taking every hue of the rainbow and their branches and leaves lost in the profusion of the Arabesque decorations and vaulted roofs. From the center of the building naves run in all directions. The Holy of Holies, where the Koran was deposited, was a recess roofed with a carved block of marble, lined with rich mosaics, and the cornices inscribed with Moslem texts in letters of gold. This indescribable sanctuary has not suffered at the hands of later architects, and is all the more impressive standing out in its ancient perfection from the\n\n30\n\nCatholic cathedral whose founders have generally covered the ornamentations and inscriptions of Islam with thick paint and whitewash. Other appropriate alterations have been made, which, however, greatly mar this grandest of the monuments of Moorish Mohammedanism. THE GARDENS OF SPAIN.\n\nNot only did the Moors bring the palm tree into Spain; but soon rice and sugarcane were products of the country; groves of mulberry and banana trees were waving; and the almond, fig, orange, citron, pomegranate and pineapple were flourishing like native growths. The cactus also was given root, and not only run riot in the south, but became a striking garden ornament. It is in the gardens of Spain, in fact, as much as in the architecture, that the Moors have left their impress. Even without the flat-roofed buildings, the fountains and the arabesque work, when one wanders in these gardens which are in and around nearly every old town of Central and Southern Spain, and which are profusions of tropical foliage and fruit, the air laden with fragrance, dates overhead, oranges and lemons within reach, he can scarcely believe himself in Europe.\n\nIn some cities which are but ghosts of their former greatness, broad tracts which have been deserted and which once supported palaces, mosques or manufactories, are now planted, not only to tropical fruits, but to the apple, peach, plum and pear. But they flourish equally well as do wheat, maize and barley, with the grains of the tropics.\n\nIn fact, nature has made Spain one of the most productive of countries, but the Spaniard, since the exit of the Moor, has not improved his opportunities. His neglect is partly owing to the fact that the Spanish nobility own immense tracts of land, which they are unable to cultivate, but hold from generation to generation. The farmers themselves are generally so poor that even the smaller holdings are covered with mortgages. As an instance of the disregard in which their rights are held by the government, it is said that the proprietors of large flocks of Merino sheep, passing through the country, are privileged to drive their animals not only over village pastures but over private lands. The farmers are obliged to provide a broad passage way for these lordly sheep owners, \"and no new enclosure can be made in the line of their migrations; nor can any land which has once been in pasture be again cultivated until it has been offered to them at a certain rate.\" Improved methods of agriculture, however, are being introduced by foreign capital, and the fertile plains of Granada, Murcia and Valencia, in some\n\n31\n\nplaces still irrigated through the old Moorish water works, are being carefully and intelligently cultivated.\n\nAnother branch of husbandry in which the Spaniards engage, but with their usual carelessness, is the cultivation of the vine. Yet, to great extent, the natural advantages of the regions adjacent to the ocean and sea coasts of Southern and Southeastern Spain have counteracted Spanish laxity. The most famous wine is the sherry, which comes from the district around Cadiz. Nearly all the brands which leave that port for Great Britain and this country are light, dry, table wines, containing naturally considerable alcohol and made more spirituous by additions from other fermented vintages, pure spirits, and decoctions and preparations drawn from over-ripe grapes. The choicest wines of the Cadiz district never reach the palates of foreign consumers, but are generally mixed with poorer sorts, which are thus mellowed and colored into all the outward appearance of the finest grades. There is a \"mother of wine\" as there is \"a mother of vinegar,\" which is used to impart bouquet and color to cheap liquors, and although when it has been years in preparation, the stock being always kept up, it is absolutely disgusting to the taste, it becomes so potent in imparting the best qualities of \"the true sherry\" that a butt of it commands from £800 to £1,000.\n\nThe country between Malaga and Granada, in Andalusia, is the home of the Malaga raisins and the Malaga wines. Three crops of grapes come annually from the vineyards of the Sierra Nevada mountains, the first being worked up into raisins and the other two into dry and sweet wines. Strong, dark wines are made from the grapes of Murcia and Valencia, the latter province having the best reputation. Of the Valencia wines, the Alicante stand at the head, being sometimes almost as thick and rich as syrup. Northern Spain is a wine-raising territory, but has no more than a local reputation.\n\nNo, the wines of Spain can not be attributed to the Arabs; for the Koran prohibits wine. The Goths, however, were drinkers of wine, and into the land of the Goths we now go.\n\nTHE GOTHIC-ROMAN PRINCES.\n\nThe Moors drove the Goths far beyond Cordova, far beyond the great chain of Sierra Morena mountains, which stretch a mighty barrier across the whole of Southern Spain. This they surmounted, and through the rocky passes of the Sierra Toledo they also swept, besieging mighty Toledo itself, the capital of the kingdom of the Goths. Their victorious course lay from the battle-fields northeast of Cadiz over half a dozen\n\n32\n\nstupendous mountain chains to the plain of Tours, where the Franks turned them back into Spain. For three centuries the Moors flourished, except in extreme Northern Spain, the Guadalquivir River, however, marking the center of their greatest glory; but the rival Mohammedan factions in Morocco continually carried their wars into Spain, and by the early part of the eleventh century they broke the caliphate of Cordova into pieces, the fragments reappearing as small kingdoms. Although driven north the Christian princes were left to fight among themselves, the Moslems giving their strength to the country of the Franks and the islands of the Mediterranean to the east of Spain; it was, without doubt, the dream of the Mohammedans of the West to join hands with the Mohammedans of the East and establish a mighty kingdom around the shores of the Mediterranean. But while the Mohammedans of Spain were a prey to internal dissensions the Gothic-Roman princes of the North buried their differences under the cover of a common cause. In the latter half of the eleventh century the King of Castile (now known as Old Castile) recovered Toledo, making it his residence and naming his territory New Castile. The capital of New Castile then became the base of operations for the Christian princes of the North against the Mohammedan states of the South, and afterward was the capital of Spain. TOLEDO.\n\nBetween high and rocky banks the Tagus rushes around the rugged hills upon which the city stands, leaving only one approach by land. When Alfonso took the city he found this closed by a sturdy wall repaired four centuries before his time by the Gothic King, Wamba, the original structure being Roman. Beyond this he placed another wall, both of which stand with the ruined fortress of Alcazar — haunted by the ghosts of Roman, Moorish and Spanish architects — to tell of the rise and fall, the retreat and advance, of the races of men. From the center of the silent, gloomy city, rises the massive cathedral, surrounded by churches and convents, nearly all of which occupy the sites of old Mosques or Jewish synagogues. Many historians, in short, claim that Toledo was founded by Jewish colonists six centuries B.C., and at the time of the invasion of Spain by the Moslems, it is said that in the neighborhood of the city an Arab general found the original table of shewbread, adorned with hyacinths and emeralds, made by Solomon and secreted by the Jews when the treasures of the temple were carried by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon. The oldest of the synagogues now standing was built in the ninth century under the tolerant rule of the Moors;\n\n33\n\nother synagogues have been transformed into churches, but this one, whose ceiling is believed to have been constructed of the cedars of Lebanon, was used as a cavalry stable during the French occupancy and is now quite deserted.\n\nTwo miles from the city walls, with their remarkable towers and gates, stands a great building, the royal sword manufactory, a remembrance only of the days when the Toledo blades were so famous as to be thought worthy of the pen of Livy.\n\nAbout a century after Toledo became the capital of Castile, another Alfonso, joined by the Kings of Aragon, Navarre, Leon and Portugal, inarched southward across La Mancha, which Cervantes was to make famous, and met on the plains of Tolosa, in the Sierra Morena, one of the greatest armies which the Moslems had ever sent against the Christians. The Mohammedan dynasty which had built its power upon the dismembered caliphate of Cordova was crushed, and from its death sprung into life the last of the noted Moorish kingdoms — that of Granada.\n\nGRANADA AND THE ALHAMBRA.\n\nThe succeeding history, before the country was united, consists of a gradual absorption by Castile and Aragon of the Moorish and Christian states, a healing of their jealousies by the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella and the final conquest of Granada, which had sustained the assaults of Christian foes for two hundred years. The gateway into the fertile kingdom is from the west across the broad plain of Vega, bordered on the south by the snow-capped Sierra Nevadas, which cool the hot breezes from the south into delightful freshness. One of the mountain spurs stretches out into the plain, at the foot of which, upon two hills, rests the last stronghold of the Moors, the center of that last grand civilization from which even the opulent cities of Italy drew much of their prosperity. Upon one of the hills which formed the city's site rose the royal palace and fortress of the Alhambra, surrounded by gardens,\n\n34\n\nand containing everything which might enable the monarchs of Granada to enjoy themselves in fancied security. Although since the year's siege by the King and Queen of Spain, which resulted in the fall of Granada, the Alhambra has been disfigured and pillaged, remodelled, many of its ancient towers blown up, etc., etc., in ruins it has aroused the enthusiasm of the lovers of the beautiful from every land. Without, a city of towers and massive walls; within, still a succession of marble, alabaster and cedar halls, ornamented with arabesques and stucco-work of mother-of-pearl, ivory and silver, beautiful fountains within playing musically to the soft breezes without — the Alhambra is all that the fair pens of a score of Washington Irving's could picture it.\n\nThe Alhambra is divided by a narrow glen from the Generalife, another Moorish palace surrounded with gardens and fountains. Its towers are taller and lighter than those of the Alhambra and it stands upon a loftier height; for it was the summer palace of the Granada Kings.\n\nFrom the Alhambra and the Generalife the grand panorama of Granada is spread in all its variety; the broad plain formerly teeming with the riches of the temperate zone and the tropics; the mountains with the ruins of fortified towns and solitary castles stretching toward the west; the Xenil winding through orchard, garden and grove, and from the south bright streams coming down the Sierra Nevada. It is the Granada of old with the life of man gone out of it.\n\nSOUTHERN AND EASTERN COASTS.\n\nSkirting the coast of Spain from Cadiz, the first port of interest going east is Palos, a sleepy enough little town, but in 1491, when Columbus stopped at the convent of La Rabida, near that port, it boasted the most enterprising mariners in all Spain. The great discoverer had determined to start for Cordova, on his way to France, being weary of the delays with which he met in Spain, but stopping at the gate of the convent to ask for some bread and water for his boy, the prior became interested in him and his dazzling enterprise, obtained for him a personal interview with Ferdinand and Isabella, and the Spaniards, instead of the French, were enabled to claim the discovery of America as their honor. Columbus sailed from Palos. The dilapidated town is still there, and between it and the sea shore is the old convent whose prior played so important a part in the discovery of America.\n\nWith its galleries tunneled through the rock on the north front, through which hundreds of huge guns frown at the bay and command the\n\n35\n\nsandy isthmus which connects English with Spanish soil, looms the huge promontory of Gibraltar. Barracks, fortresses and batteries on the summit and west side, on which are the bay and town, the descent being precipitous on the remaining sides, is a matter-of-fact, dry description of a very matter-of-fact sort of an institution. It would be useless to describe more fully that great fortress which stands as an index of the English character, and upon which thousands of English writers have cast their artillery of adjectives.\n\nDuring the prevalence of the southwest winds vessels compelled to leave Gibraltar often sail to the fine port of Malaga, a dazzling city of white houses, commanded by one of those massive Moorish castles which become tiresome in the mere telling but are ever fascinating in the seeing. Some say Malaga was founded by the Iberians. Others suppose the name to be the Phoenician for salt fish, which was one of its most famous exports. Malaga is now best known as the city from which go out the muscatel raisins, as fine as any the world knows about. Olive oil and sugar are also largely exported. Malaga, in fact, despite her Moorish air and ancient castle, is in the active current of to-day.\n\nCoasting along the shores of Granada, with the Sierra Nevadas in the distance, and passing numbers of villages which formerly saw the vessels of many nations bound for their prosperous capital, Cartagena is reached, and, if the traveler desires, on this former borderland of Moorish territory he may take a trip inland by railway to Murcia, the capital of the province. \"Lying out of the route of travelers it is almost unvisited, and having little commerce except with the peasantry of its fertile huerta, it retains its old costumes, manners and customs with even more than Spanish tenacity. The men wear a tartan plaid, like that of a Scotch shepherd, only more brilliant in color. The women greatly affect bright yellow and scarlet, and even the poorest contrive to interweave a few flowers into their hair. The costumes through the whole of the eastern\n\n37\n\nprovinces are very strange and very Moorish. Hempen sandals take the place of shoes; the legs are either bare or covered by a footless cotton stocking. In many districts the peasantry wear very wide calico drawers, reaching down to the knees and looking like a short petticoat, and a close-fitting jacket covered with spangles and embroidery. The plaid is commonly substituted along this coast for the mantle patronized by the Castilians.\" THE CID.\n\nNorthward from Murcia to the river Ebro and clear across Spain to Portugal is the broad scene of action of Spain's greatest national hero, the Cid Campeador, or Lord Champion. The title \"Cid\" came from the Moors and the \"Campeador\" from his own countrymen; for in the course of his romantic life he fought with and against the Moorish kings. But with whomsoever he cast the weight of his mighty arms that monarch triumphed. At length, banished by a Christian king, he joined the Moorish kings of Saragossa, in whose service he fought against both Moslems and Christians. Though his fame spread over Europe and the brilliancy of his exploits was such that he became in imagination a modern Hercules with an invincible sword, in order to maintain his family and his followers he was forced to turn against his former allies, and, after a stubbornly contested siege of ten months, he wrested Valencia from the Moors. The Cid was promptly besieged, in turn, by a great army of Moors. As they lay encamped beneath the walls of Valencia, tradition represents him as coolly leading his terrified wife and daughters to one of the towers, where they could see the Moslem host below, and all around them a mighty grove or garden of citrons, oranges, and palms. Assuring his family of victory he collected his handful of followers and giving battle to the Moorish troops defeated them and drove them from the city. The tower of Miguelete is pointed out as the point from which he looked over his fair and newly-acquired province, covered with grain and rice fields and thick with palm and mulberry trees, and so confidently predicted his usual victory.\n\nThe city is still the center of a fertile region, ingeniously watered by a system of pipes and rivulets, perfected by the Moors eight centuries ago. It is a pleasant walled city with macadamized streets, with old gloomy houses and new bright ones painted blue, rose and cream color, with picture galleries illustrative of the famous Valencian school, and, all in all, one of the several Spanish cities which is wide awake. Both the Cid and his wife ruled over ancient Valencia, which was an old city before Pompey took and destroyed it and it was rebuilt by the\n\n38\n\nRomans. Alicante, although an important and picturesque port of the province of Valencia, is not of interest, historically.\n\nFor some distance above Valencia, along the coast, Roman settlements are constantly obtruding themselves. A short ride from the city is a modest enough looking town, standing upon a hill near the mouth of a small river. Its site was the ancient, opulent Saguntum, whose heroic citizens, having beaten off, for many long months, Hannibal's great army of 150,000 men, at length in despair placed the women and children around a vast heap of valuables. When, from their elevated post the wives, sisters and daughters saw their famished protectors being cut to pieces by the fierce, well-fed Carthaginians they set fire to the pile, and, with their children, cast themselves into the welcome embrace of the flames. The siege and destruction of Saguntum brought upon the Carthaginians the Second Punic war. Few traces of its former greatness remain, the Temple of Diana (relic of its Grecian founders) and the Roman amphitheatre having been used for fortifications during the Peninsula war.\n\nBARCELONA.\n\nAll along to Barcelona are scattered fragments of Roman works, indicating where were once imperial cities, overrun by Vandals, Goths and Moors, and used by Spaniards for the building material of modern towns and farm houses. Next to Cadiz, Barcelona is the most important sea port in Spain, and during the middle ages, except by Genoa, it stood unrivaled on the Mediterranean. Barcelona has also been called the \"Athens of the Troubadours,\" as an evidence that it was a favorite resort of the courtly poets and scholars of the middle ages, as well as the princely mercantile classes. It was a favorite resort of Ferdinand and Isabella, and here they received Columbus after his discovery of America. The most important manufacturing city in Spain, Barcelona is also a beautiful place, the old and new districts being separated by the Rambla, a dry river bed, which has been planted with flowering shrubs and made into an attractive promenade.\n\nTHE ROMANS AND THE CELTS.\n\nFrom Barcelona west, through Northern Spain, is traversed the stronghold of the old Gothic power, which, at last, became the basis of the Spanish state. We are now within sight of the Pyrenees, spurs from the main body running down into the provinces of Catalonia and Aragon to form green, pleasant valleys. In the western part of Catalonia is a military stronghold, Lerida, which guards the approach from\n\n39\n\nthe north to the districts of Eastern Spain, and from the south to some of the most convenient passes into France. It is a gloomy-looking town, with the usual accompaniments of a fortified place, but even before the time that Scipio Africanus defeated Caesar in the neighboring plain, it was considered by the Romans an important strategic point in the possession of their Spanish conquests. Before the Romans came the Celtiberians had discovered the advantages of the position, and it was undoubtedly the site of one of their primitive towns.\n\nLerida is on a branch of the Ebro, and further west, in the center of old Aragon, and upon the muddy river itself, is Saragossa, the Celtiberian Salduba and the Roman Caesarea Augusta. The Moors took it from the Goths, and although they held it for three centuries they retained it during a continuous siege of five more years, during which famine nearly depopulated the city. Seven centuries afterwards Saragossa, defended by the heroic Duke Palafox, sustained for eight months one of the most bravely and brilliantly contested sieges of modern times, the French being the investing parties. It has been a city of sieges, and seems to have exhausted its strength in sustaining them so stubbornly. Its palaces are ever crumbling away, having been partially destroyed or weakened by the heavy ordnance of modern guns, and those which show evidences that they are substantial have been deserted by the nobility. \"These buildings, rich in finely carved decorations and magnificent cornices, are now mostly inhabited by agriculturists of a rude class, their spacious courts converted into farm yards and filled with manure.\" Massive and elegant churches and convents are yet standing, however, to give the city an imposing appearance from the distance, which impression is not borne out by a nearer inspection.\n\nOne of its cathedrals — the Church of Our Lady of the Pillar — commemorates the pretended miracle by which the Virgin Mary was brought from Heaven upon a pillar of jasper that she might encourage St. James, whom she had sent to Spain to preach the Gospel. The pillar and her heavenly image are still shown to the crowds of pilgrims who press from all parts of Spain toward the jeweled church and the sacred relics which it incloses.\n\nWhen we cross the bounds of Aragon into Old Castile we enter a district made memorable by the stubborn stand which the Celtiberians made against the armies of Rome sent to subdue the troublesome aborigines. Near the site of the present town of Soria the Roman legions under Scipio assaulted and besieged their chief town. This was but the last scene in a series of bloody conflicts which its citizens had sustained for twenty years. For fifteen months 60,000 disciplined\n\n40\n\nsoldiers stormed, besieged and starved these ancient heroes, who from 8,000 slowly melted into a pitiful band, before the town was taken and destroyed.\n\nThe traveler has also set foot upon the native land of the Cid and begins to enter the territory wherein, after Napoleon's disastrous campaign in Russia, were enacted the closing scenes of the Peninsula War between his lieutenants and the Duke of Wellington. The birthplace of the Spanish hero was Burgos, the capital of Old Castile, where his remains, with those of his heroic wife, are laid. Their sculptured figures lie together upon a square sarcophagus at San Pedro de Cardena, while, for a small fee a wooden box and a bottle will be exhibited at Burgos, in which are kept the bones of the Cid and the ashes of his wife. This city, which was so long the center of the shifting league against the Moors, which, with the Cantabrians to the north, held Northwestern Spain against their Moslem foes, is now a dull and gloomy city, with a noble Gothic cathedral, picturesque and stately beggars, and various chapels rich in fine sculpture and tombs.\n\nAcross Old Castile and Galicia to the northwest of Spain is a long run, and only to reach a bustling, fortified seaport on the Atlantic coast; but it has a monument to Sir John Moore, who fell while fighting the French on the heights behind the town, being buried on the ramparts in his military cloak. First Philip sailed from Coruna, this seaport town, on his way to marry Mary of England, and over thirty years thereafter he embarked with the great Armada to conquer the country which he could not obtain by marriage.\n\nTHE MECCA OF SPAIN.\n\nA short distance from Coruna was a cathedral which was, for centuries, an even greater shrine than the Church of Our Lady of the Pillar at Saragossa. It is declared that after St. James was beheaded he set sail from Joppa, the seaport of Jerusalem, either in a boat or his stone coffin, and landing on this coast his body was mysteriously deposited in a cave, where, after remaining for half a dozen centuries or more, it was drawn to the city of Santiago, where the cathedral was built and pilgrimages were instituted. He therefore often came to the assistance of the Spaniards in their wars against the infidels, and to the battle-cry of St. James was added \"Santiago.\" The archbishop's palace, cloister and cathedral form the most imposing of Santiago's structures. They cover nearly four acres of ground, and into the foundations of the cathedral are believed to be built the bones of St. James. Besides those occupied the town contains numbers of convents and nunneries in ruins.\n\n41\n\nVALLADOLID.\n\nHad it not been for this side trip to the Mecca of Spain, after leaving Coruna our way would have laid toward Valladolid, Philip's birth place, and, strangely enough, the scene of the first auto da fι, which the cruel monarch witnessed from a balcony overlooking the Plaza de Campo. This famous square was devoted to tournaments, bull fights and such other exhibitions as the Inquisition brought forth. Here also Napoleon reviewed his 35,000 troops who had succeeded in seriously damaging the interior of the Convent San Pablo and the Colegio de San Uregorio, which stood near the royal palace, and whose ruins are among the grandest of Gothic ecclesiastical edifices in the world. But greater than her ruins, her galleries of statues and pictures, her deserted palaces of royalty and the Inquisition, and even her extensive university, are the houses of Columbus and Cervantes — the scenes of death and of the final revision of \"Don Quixote.\" The house where Columbus died was, at last accounts, a small shop for the sale of woolen goods.\n\nSALAMANCA.\n\nSalamanca is the next famous town as we near Madrid, as being for so many centuries the university center of the Catholic faith, having from an early period contained a college for the special education of Irish students. It is still in existence. It is said that \"one of the most highly-prized works in Roman Catholic divinity is the great collection of Controversia and moral theology by the members of the college of Carmelite friars.\" The Plaza Mayor is the largest square in Spain, and will, upon occasion, accommodate the 16,000 or 20,000 who pour toward it from a radius of a score of miles when a great bull fight is announced; for such are the contrasts of Spanish life! Salamanca was almost destroyed by the French in 1812, and most of its splendid ancient edifices are in ruins or worked\n\n42\n\ninto the fortifications which the invaders, when they possessed the city, threw up against the British. Twenty colleges and as many convents thus fell victims to the stern necessities of war.\n\nAvila, another step nearer Madrid, is a small town about fifty miles northwest of the capital, and although one of the many places which the wonder-loving Spaniards ascribe to Hercules, it is now chiefly noted as being the birthplace of the country's lady patroness, \"Our Seraphic Mother, the Holy Theresa, Spouse of Jesus,\" born March 28, 1515. It was at one time one of the richest cities of Spain.\n\nAbout the same distance from Madrid is Segovia, frequently the residence of the kings of Castile and Leon, where they laid their schemes to lower the pride of the Moorish monarchs. It is perched upon a rocky knoll, high above the sea level, surrounded by picturesque walls and round towers. Segovia's importance as a Roman city is indicated by the most stupendous Roman structure left standing in Spain — an aqueduct half a mile long and one hundred and two feet high. Under the Moors it was the seat of immense cloth manufactures, and the modern town reflects its old prosperity in the shape of a few small establishments which scour wool and manufacture woolen cloths. On a rocky promontory is one of those fortress palaces — the Alcazar — which the Moors seem to have planted upon every bold height of the districts in which they lived. The Alcazar of Segovia, long after the Moslems were driven out of Castile, was used by the kings of Spain as a prison, both for state offenders and the pirates of the Barbary states, who retained few of those qualities of intelligent industry which made the Moorish dominion in Spain one which was not devoid of great blessings.\n\nTHE ESCURIAL.\n\nLooking toward Madrid from the barren and elevated sand plateau which surrounds it, it is seen that the capital lies in a basin, encircled by plantations, gardens and boulevards. Within this band of green, almost startling from its contrast with the arid plains of Castile, rises the city of palaces, spires and domes. If you come up from the south, this picture, set in a frame-work of green, has a background of snow-capped mountains; if you come down from the north by way of Segovia, you can not miss that gigantic gridiron, the Escurial, which lays with upturned feet upon the southeastern slope of the Sierra Guadarama. St. Lawrence was broiled on a gridiron, and in accordance with a vow that he would build a monastery to his memory if he gained the battle of St. Quentin, Philip built the Escurial in its present form. Many ranges of buildings represent its body, crossing each other at right angles, forming\n\n43\n\nnumerous courts with a tower 200 feet in height at each corner of the immense parallelogram. The towers are the upturned feet, and the handle is a wing nearly 500 feet long, containing the royal apartments, picture galleries and a library. The mausoleum of the kings of Spain fronts one side of a court, in the form of a massive church built like St. Peter's, its grand dome rising above the mighty altar over 300 feet. Under the altar is the tomb of the kings of Spain, built of jasper and black marble, in which their precious remains are packed away like so much treasure. Two-score marble chapels, marble and porphyry pillars on all sides — red, green, white and black — the walls incrusted with marble, the floors paved with it, give a rich and solemn effect to the interior; while without are the massive dome and towers, the six granite and marble statues, called the kings of Judea, sitting in royal state upon the broad staircase, and the sculptured portal through which the bodies of the kings of Spain are borne for baptism, and never again except as corpses. MADRID.\n\nThere is nothing now to prevent our passing through the triumphal gate of the Puerta de Alcala, seventy-two feet in height, into the city of which the Spaniard says \"See Madrid and live,\" but whose three months of winter and nine months of blasting heat have prompted foreigners to hold out no inducement but speedy death to a resident. Four streets traverse Madrid from northeast to southwest, and one of them, Alcala, is pronounced the handsomest in Spain and one of the widest and finest in the world. The principal commercial thoroughfares radiate from one street, and they are more European than Spanish. But in the southwest district, particularly in the streets south of the Plaza Mayor, the wide and regular thoroughfares of modern Madrid give place to the crooked, dirty lanes of the ancient city. Open shops or bazaars, like those of Morocco, Egypt, or Turkey, line them and they are crowded with beggars, smugglers and gypsies. Within the square were many fine buildings which were repeatedly destroyed by the flames of the autos da fι, although the victims were led to the stake outside the gate. But the danger in which the surrounding buildings stood could not have been small, for the water supply of the city was formerly almost confined to drinking purposes, and the portentous flames were continually ascending to heaven. In opening new streets from the Plaza Mayor, especially one in 1869, terrible evidences of the magnitude of these human bonfires were discovered. A number of strata of charcoal and cinders were upturned, mingled with bones and entire portions of the human\n\n44\n\nbody, and, for a time, while the excitement of the large foreign element of Madrid ran high over the disclosure, the beggars and gypsies and street arabs of the district south of the square reaped a welcome harvest of small coins by delving in the refuse and selling the relics of martyrdom to curiosity seekers. There are other smaller squares in which criminals and heretics were executed and in the center of one of the most diminutive is a cross which marks the spot where the last heretic was burned in Madrid.\n\nThe center of the modern capital is the Puerta del Sol, as we have intimated. Not only do the principal business streets run from this square, but magnificent hotels and cafιs, cosy club and reading rooms, are centered around it, so that it is the natural point toward which resort the French, English and German business men and the Spanish pleasure seekers. Newsboys, water-carriers, honey-sellers, musicians with their bagpipes and guitars, and at night the private watchmen who lustily cry out the time and the state of the weather, make this vicinity a second Naples for din and good-natured bustle. Of the great palaces of Madrid the residence of the royal family is the most imposing. It is 470 feet square, 100 feet high, built of granite and white marble, incloses\n\n45\n\na great square, is between beautiful gardens and a magnificent plaza decorated with statues of kings and queens, and contains extensive libraries, and a royal armory wherein are the armors of Cortes, Columbus and Don John of Austria, with the crowns of Gothic kings brought from Toledo.\n\nThe whole of this magnificent pile was occupied during the reign of the Bourbons. Queen Isabella, the mother of a subsequent king, lived there in especial state. She flaunted rich robes of state on which were the arms of Castile, her jewels were royal and her entertainments. The princess had palatial apartments and her husband and sister's family also quartered themselves in this splendid home. Their retinues, receptions and all, despite the family jars, were on a par with the munificence of the ancient sovereigns. Her successor, King Amadeus, and his modest wife followed after Carlist insurrections and scandalous events. He seemed worthy of the position. The palatial pile was almost deserted. The royal pair lived in three rooms, with the children, like a sensible, simple couple — Queen Isabella had occupied those very apartments alone. The king went out like a private gentlemen, sometimes accompanied by his wife or a servant. Having dined with his wife, smoked a cigar and tended to his affairs of state, he went into the Alcala to see the sights and talk to his subjects. \"The ministers cried out against it; the Bourbon party who were accustomed to the imposing cortege of Isabella said that he dragged the majesty of the throne of San Fernando through the streets.\" At the court dinner on Sunday, to which government officials and scientists were invited, the queen appeared with the king, simply dressed, having spent much of the week at hospitals and at such institutions as the one she established where children were sent for safe-keeping whose mothers were out at work. She spoke Spanish well, although it was not her native tongue. She was a kind-hearted, sensible woman, and her husband was like his father, Victor Emanuel. But though as approachable as the most democratic might desire, they were not Spanish, and so they gave place to Isabella's son, the mother having fled in disgrace, and the young prince of Asturias, Alfonso, became the master of the royal palace. He died in 1885, and during the next year his queen, Christina, gave birth to a son, who, if he lives, may be lord of this palace.\n\nSouth from the magnificent Alcala is the first of Madrid's numerous promenades, the Prado. For several miles it stretches along, between stately houses from whose balconies, protected by screens or curtains, the famous Spanish beauties smile upon the gay throng of carriages, horsemen and pedestrians. Here are seen the graceful Spanish cloak and the\n\n46\n\nnational veil and mantilla, although French styles are getting to be prevalent among the higher classes. The northern limits of the Prado proper are fixed by the fountain of Cybele, the proud mother of the gods being seated in a triumphal car drawn by two great marble lions. In the center of the boulevard is another beautiful fountain dedicated to Apollo, and Neptune is honored in the south. Minor fountains, gardens and pieces of statuary are scattered along the way, and the beauties of this enticing drive and walk are prolonged, both north and south, into the charming suburbs of the city.\n\nIt is in the way of this constant stream of beauty, fashion and culture that the royal museum lays, in which is treasured, according to artistic authorities, a collection of paintings \"not only the greatest in the world, but the greatest that can ever be made until this is broken up.\"\n\nThe gallery comprises works of Murillo, Velasquez, Raphael, Rubens, Teniers and Titian. Murillo's \"Martyrdom of St. Andrew,\" the instrument of whose death shaped the great Escurial, is here, and the most wonderful works of Velasquez enable the artist to study the master here as nowhere else. Madrid was the scene of his greatest triumphs. Here the king himself so appreciated his genius as to become his intimate and to confer upon him the Cross of Santiago, an honor never before accorded to any but the highest of the nobility.\n\nAMUSEMENTS OF THE NATIVE.\n\nJust outside the Alcala is the bull ring, built upon the site of an ancient one. No great Spanish town would be complete without it. The bull ring is a great open amphitheatre, which was inherited from the Romans. The huge animals which furnish the blood and the sport of the occasion, mostly come from the Sierra Morena mountains of Andalusia; the very name, \"Andalusian bull,\" sounds like a great body propelling itself forward with mighty force. The participants in the fight at first are usually unmounted, and show proverbial agility in avoiding the rushes of the infuriated monster. But this sport is merely to whet the appetite of the gay crowd for the more exciting contest, in which the mounted picadors also participate. Having partially exhausted his strength in vain charges at his glittering, nimble foes, the bull is now confronted with mounted spearmen as well. As his strength fails, more and more, if he has not yet maimed a man or disemboweled a horse, it is needful to import a new company of tormenters to thrust him with darts. When the beast refuses the contest the matador gives him the death-blow with his short sword. Trumpets sound, flowers are showered\n\n47\n\ninto the arena by excited ladies, and the matter-of-fact, unromantic mules are driven in to drag away the dead bodies of bull and horses.\n\nThe king had his private box, as of old. Even Amadeus, his predecessor, of the simple, homely manners, patronized the exhibition, although his tender-hearted queen, not hardened yet to the sights, stayed away. If the \"torero\" is fortunate enough to have given the bull his death wound in a skillful manner, the thousands of spectators, as he makes the round of the arena, almost bury him beneath piles of cigars, purses, hats, canes — anything which comes to hand — while the ladies shower him with praises, not to say loving words. The king himself rewards the bloody hero with a purse of money, and the same performance is repeated as long as the festival of the bull fights lasts.\n\nCock-fights are less popular, because fewer grades of society patronize them; but there are regular theatres where the cruel sport may be witnessed, and the excitement there evinced, if not so grand in its quality and quantity as shown at the bull amphitheatre, is fully as intense. The conflict of the birds usually takes place in the daytime, so that among the various spectators the principal actors in the bull arena often appear dressed in their red sashes and gaudy clothes. The theatre itself is bright with color — the circular tiers of chairs are often red and flowers are painted on the walls. The pit is a circular box in the centre of the hall, surrounded by a high wire screen. But why describe a cock-fight! It is more brutal, if anything, though not so destructive of life as the other\n\n48\n\nsport; for a true Spanish fight must end in the death of one or the other of the combatants, and if the birds are game the conclusion of the conflict sees one or both of them simply bunches of feathers, blood and bones, with the flesh stripped from the skeleton and the eyes out. Ladies and the higher classes, who would eagerly grace a bull fight, do not attend such small exhibitions of bloodshed. It is only where horses, bulls and men shed their blood that they care to go.\n\nMadrid contains nearly a hundred public squares, large and small, and a vast number of churches, but having no cathedral, strictly speaking, it ranks in Spain merely as a town within the bishopric of Toledo. Under the Moors it was a mere fortified outpost of Toledo, and the Royal Palace stands upon the site of the ancient Alcazar, or fortress. When it was stormed and captured by Alfonso of Castile, the castle and town were called Majerit. As we have stated he made Toledo his capital and Madrid did not come into real prominence until Philip II. declared it to be \"the only court,\" the royal residence having been shifting around from place to place ever since Ferdinand's time. So that the founding of Madrid dates from about the middle of the sixteenth century. It has been a city of memorable treaties and insurrections, the most serious uprising being that against Murat and the French in 1808. An imposing group of edifices now occupies the site of an old church, which stood east of the great square of Puerta del Sol, the scene of the bloodiest conflict between the French and the citizens, while in a park of the Prado called \"the field of loyalty\" is a memorial shaft, surrounded by mourning cypresses.\n\nCUBA AND COLUMBUS' TOMB.\n\nSpain still retains the Cuba that Columbus discovered, and it is the most important of her colonial possessions. The population which the Spaniards found has disappeared, with the exception of a few families around Santiago, and the people are now a conglomeration of blacks, Creoles and \"peninsulares,\" or natives of Spain. Most of the latter class, or Cuban Spaniards, originally came from Aragon, Catalonia, Navarre, Castile and other districts of Northern and Northeastern Spain, being traders and mechanics, and so sturdy and energetic that they not only obtained control of the wealth, but the government of the island. \"For a time after the conquest in 1511 none but Castilians were allowed to settle in Cuba; but after the prohibition was removed, colonists from all the provinces, and even from the Canary Islands, came thither. The Biscayans hire out as mechanics; the Catalans, who are numerous,\n\n49\n\ndevote themselves to hard labor; the Asturians, Castilians and Andalusians occupy clerkships and the learned professions.\" The aborigines of the West Indies have disappeared, or been driven along the pathway of the Antilles to South America, leaving many strange relics behind them which will be properly placed at the Columbian Exposition.\n\nThe metropolitan center of Cuba's best life is Havana, through which flows so large a revenue to needy Spain. The city is almost as well known as New York, having about half the population of Madrid, and presenting, besides its immense commercial activity, one of the finest opera houses in existence.\n\nThe most noteworthy church is the large Jesuit Cathedral, plain without but richly frescoed within, its floor and portions of its altars being constructed of beautiful variegated marble. In the wall of the chancel an inscribed medallion indicates that below is the tomb of Columbus.\n\nUntil 1877 it was supposed that the remains of Columbus undoubtedly rested beneath the rich marble floor of the Havana Cathedral. From Spain they were carried to San Domingo, and when, in 1795, Hispaniola was transferred to France, the supposed dust of the illustrious man was borne to Havana. Washington Irving thus describes the impressive ceremonies attending the historic event:\n\n\"On the 20th of December, 1795, the most distinguished persons of the place (San Domingo), the dignitaries of the church, the civil and military of"
