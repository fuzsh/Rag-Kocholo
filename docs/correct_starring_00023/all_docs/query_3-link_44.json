        "text": "WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FILMING THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL BACK IN 2006 AND THIS NEW ONE?\n\n\"Last time, we had to play getting to know you and everything was different and new. But this time, it's so exciting because we all know each other already—it's really just like a family. And it feels like we know what we're doing, so we're able to have a little bit more fun this time around.\"\n\nHOW HAS YOUR CHARACTER, TAYLOR MCKESSIE, GROWN UP?\n\n\"Taylor is absolutely still brainy —and proud of it! —but this go-round she's got a bit more heart and soul. And instead of knowing everything about science, she knows everything about boys. It shows that you don't have to choose between being smart, girly, pretty, or talented. We're capable of doing and being whatever we want to be!\"\n\nTAYLOR'S GOT ALL THESE RULES FOR GUYS. WHAT'S THE BEST ONE?\n\n\"The cutest one is Rule #10: In case of emergency, do whatever your best friends tell you to do! It just means that sometimes we're wrong, and you just have to [trust] your best friend. I think that's pretty sweet.\"\n\nWHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM COMPETING ON DANCING WITH THE STARS?\n\n\"I play so young because of my looks. I look like a child—and I love it! But I am an adult, and at some point the rest of the world is going to have to see me that way, so Dancing with the Stars was a very important transition for me. It allowed me to be a little bit sexier and older and to realize there's nothing wrong with that!\"\n\nHOW WAS IT LEARNING TO SWIM FOR HSM2?\n\n\"I've been in the shallow end of a pool, just kind of walking around, but this was my first time really swimming—and I was horrified! I actually lost it whenever I saw the edge of the pool. But I took baby steps and rewarded myself every step of the way. I would give myself gummy worms and fruit snacks, just little things that acknowledged that I was accomplishing something.\""
