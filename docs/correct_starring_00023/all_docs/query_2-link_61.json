        "text": "High School Musical alum Monique Coleman is opening up about pregnancy loss.\n\nIn a new interview with People, the actor revealed that she experienced a miscarriage right before production began on her new movie, A Christmas Dance Reunion, which is bringing her back to the camera with former HSM costar, Corbin Bleu.\n\nMonique explained that she had been preparing to film while pregnant, knowing that she could lean on Corbin and his wife Sasha Clements for support. But when she unexpectedly miscarried, the actor added that the two were able to provide a different kind of emotional assistance. “If I was pregnant, I was excited to be with Corbin and Sasha because I knew that they would be able to carry me and hold me through that experience,” she told People. “And when I wasn't, they were also able to be there for me in a way that I can't even really describe.”\n\nShe added that Corbin and Sasha lit a candle in memory of her loss on October 15, which is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. “We were in quarantine in our respective rooms, but to be able to talk to them about that and to bond with them in this really difficult time where I'm alone in a room by myself, but not to feel alone, was just so special,” Monique recalled.\n\nMonique and Corbin’s friendship is clearly a meaningful one, and it’s lasted far beyond the final takes in the halls of East High. Which is why reuniting for their upcoming Lifetime film was endlessly exciting, as the actors recounted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight earlier this month. “I obviously knew that I would love hanging out with you, in the work sense of just, 'Oh yay, we're going to be on set together,” Monique said while speaking to Corbin. “But I didn't process what it would be like to get to work with you again, actually as an artist, and that was really invigorating to me.”\n\nThe two actors also spoke of the importance for viewers to see “a continuing onscreen couple of color,” citing several pairs of white actors who have played love interests more than once, like Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. “This is very unique...and a beautiful opportunity to dismantle that stereotype or dismantle this idea that we are just one thing,” Monique remarked. “And I'm excited for…the fans to really get to experience us in this iteration….. I know that they see Chad and Taylor. But my hope is that Lucy and Barrett win their hearts.”\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email."
