        "text": "Monique Coleman is revealing the reason behind her \"High School Musical\" character Taylor McKessie's signature headbands.\n\nAccording to Coleman, Taylor wore a variety of colorful headbands because the crew didn't know how to work with Black hair.\n\n\"We've grown a lot in this industry and we've grown a lot in representation and we've grown a lot in terms of understanding the needs of an African American actress,\" the 40-year-old told Insider in an interview for the movie's 15th anniversary.\n\n\"But the truth is, is that they had done my hair, and they had done it very poorly in the front.\"\n\nMore: Keke Palmer, Gabrielle Union, more celebs share Black hair discrimination stories in PSA\n\nThe former Disney actress explained that the crew members were short on time to fix her hair, which inspired her to suggest incorporating headbands into her character and \"just make that part of who she is.\"\n\nDisney and the film's wardrobe department were \"very open to our feedback,\" says Coleman, who added that she and her castmates were \"lucky\" for their responsiveness.\n\nColeman went on to discuss the legacy of the \"High School Musical\" franchise, explaining that she still felt \"grateful to have been someone who was able to bring representation at a time where there wasn't very much.\"\n\n\"I'm so happy when I see this next generation of young artists and there just being so much more room for people of color,\" she reflected.\n\n\"It means the world to me, particularly because Taylor is such a dynamic character and the smartest person at school and all of that at a time where, often, Black girl characters tended to be the ones who had an attitude or to be sassy,\" she said.\n\nStudy: Two in three Black Americans don't see themselves represented in movies and TV\n\n\"I appreciated that that wasn't why people loved Taylor. They loved her because she was smart and supportive. And it definitely means a lot to me for people to see her. There was Taylor before the Obamas were a thing. So we didn't have people to look up to.\"\n\nColeman's character Taylor was the captain of East High's Scholastic Decathlon team in the franchise's first film, and goes on to study Political Science at Yale University in 2008's \"High School Musical 3.\"\n\n\"So knowing that this generation got to look up to her really is special for me.\"\n\n'High School Musical': 'High School Musical' director didn't think Disney would have allowed an openly gay character in 2006\n\nInsider also interviewed Lucas Grabeel, who played Sharpay's brother, Ryan Evans. Grabeel revealed that he and director Kenny Ortega made sure to include nods that his character was gay, though Disney \"was not on board\" with the idea at the time.\n\n\"The first conversation we had, I went up to him and I was like, 'OK, so Ryan, is he gay or what?'\" Grabeel said. \"And [Kenny's] like, 'Look, it would be the easy choice just to make him this flamboyant character who's an archetype or a caricature of these theater kids, but let's do this even smarter. Let's add layers.\""
