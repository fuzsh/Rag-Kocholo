        "text": "High School Musical will literally never be the same.\n\nIf you're here it's probably because you're also a stan of the Oscar snubbed movie franchise, High School Musical.\n\nSo there I was, doing some ~important~ research on the movies when I stumbled across a lil' fact that had me, frankly, shook.\n\nYou remember Tiara Gold, right? The discount Sharpay Evans who was a complete snake and tried to steal Sharpay's role in the musical.\n\nWell Jemma McKenzie-Brown, who played Tiara, was actually 14 YEARS OLD when High School Musical 3 was released.\n\nNot just that, but according to a very reliable source that rhymes with schmikipedia, shooting for HSM3 began on 3 May 2008, meaning Jemma was only 13!!!!\n\nAdamant that I was being lied to, I hunted down Jemma's Instagram and scrolled back to 2 June where I found THIS.\n\nSo if Tiara Gold was actually only 13, how old was everybody else? What other lies have I been living? Time to investigate...\n\nOur leading man, Zac Efron, is 30 years old now, and when HSM3 was released on 24 October 2008, he would've just turned 21.\n\nVanessa Hudgens is now 29, and would've been 19 years old.\n\nSharpay Evans – or Ashley Tisdale if you want to be technical – was a little older at 23 when the third movie was released.\n\nHer on-screen brother Ryan – aka Lucas Grabeel – was also 23 which is cute considering they're twins in the movie.\n\nCorbin Bleu and his fantastic hair, which should've won its own Oscar, would've been 19 years old.\n\nBut his on-screen girlfriend Monique Coleman – aka our future president Taylor McKessie – was actually 27 by the third movie, and almost 28!\n\nKelsi Nielsen, played by Olesya Rulin, was 22.\n\nAnd Martha Cox – aka Kaycee Stroh – was 24 years old.\n\nOh, and Tiara Gold's counterpart, also known as Discount Troy Bolton (or Jimmie \"Rocket Man\" Zara, whatever) was 18 when the final movie came out.\n\nColour me shook by all of this. I'm going to sit in a dark room for a minute and question everything else I thought I knew.\n\nShare This Article"
