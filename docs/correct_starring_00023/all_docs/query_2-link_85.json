        "text": "You know you’re getting old when you realise High School Musical came out almost 16 years ago. What a time that was, at least for the fans, considering how the musical/comedy was a major part of their teenage years. But it looks like certain actors might not have had such a gala time as the audience did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonique Coleman, the actress who played the iconic character of Taylor McKessie in the famous film series, recently opened up about what it was actually like behind the scenes of the classic movie, and it’s not the most picture-perfect scenario because during High School Musical 3, Disney might have played a part in triggering the actress’ depression by ostracising her completely.\n\nSee also: ‘Girls were running after him. I was giving them death stares’: Vanessa Hudgens Reveals Super Toxic relationship With High School Musical Co-Star Zac Efron\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney Didn’t Invite Monique Coleman for the High School Musical 3 Promo Tour\n\nMonique Coleman might have risen to stardom in her career, in part, due to her role in High School Musical, but while Disney garnered her a substantial amount of fame and recognition, it also ended up being the very reason she suffered from a depressive episode.\n\nOn the podcast Vulnerable with Christy Carlson Romano, Coleman revealed the stark reality behind playing a teenage character at the age of 24 alongside co-stars who were almost half her age."
