        "text": "LOS ANGELES — The stars of “High School Musical” are reuniting for a 10th-anniversary tribute to the TV movie.\n\nActors Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman share memories of the movie when it airs again at 6 p.m. MST Wednesday on the Disney Channel.\n\nZac Efron, who played Troy opposite Hudgens’ Gabriella, couldn’t attend the pre-taped group reunion because it conflicted with promotion of his movie “Dirty Grandpa,” a channel spokeswoman said. Efron recorded separate remarks that will be included in the broadcast.\n\nThe “High School Musical” reprise comes during a wave of TV musical popularity. NBC has aired a series of live musicals and is aiming to put “Hairspray” on in December, while Fox is showing a live production of “Grease” on Jan. 31 and ABC has plans for a “Dirty Dancing” TV movie.\n\nThe Disney movie and its sequel, “High School Musical 2,” will be repeated on Thursday and on Sunday, Jan. 24, on Disney Channel. The Freeform cable channel will show “High School Musical” on Saturday and Sunday, Jan. 23 and 24."
