        "text": "#10: Kaycee Stroh\n\nKaycee Stroh was working as a dance instructor when she took her students to the “High School Musical” auditions. She was subsequently noticed by the casting director and cast in the role of Martha Cox (sorry students!), who she played throughout all three films. After the conclusion of the series, Stroh made a cameo appearance in Lady Gaga’s Telephone video and appeared on “Celebrity Fit Club” in 2010. She also acted in one episode of “The League” and performed in an episode of Disney’s “Andi Mack” in 2018. She also married her husband, Ben Higginson, in 2009 and had two daughters, Zetta and Lettie.\n\n#9: Ryne Sanborn\n\nRyne Sanborn has been in front of cameras since he was two years old when he began modeling as a toddler. He also appeared in numerous shows as a child, including “Touched by an Angel” and “Everwood,” before landing the role of Jason Cross in “High School Musical.” However, it appears as if Sanborn grew tired of performing after all those years, as he retired from acting in 2008 and became an architect with a degree from the University of Utah. He has also played hockey for the Salt Lake's Outliers.\n\n#8: Olesya Rulin\n\nOlesya Rulin emigrated from Russia when she was eight years old and quickly became a ballet dancer and model. She also worked as a nursing assistant and at various retail stores, including Victoria’s Secret and Nordstrom, before eventually landing the role of Kelsi Nielsen. She is now acting full time and has appeared in many films and TV shows since the conclusion of “High School Musical.” She has starred opposite Kristin Chenoweth in “Family Weekend,” provided the voice for the Russian Meg clone in an episode of “Family Guy,” and starred as Calista Secor in “Powers,” a PlayStation Network original series.\n\n#7: Chris Warren Jr.\n\nChris Warren Jr. had some acting experience prior to starring as Zeke Baylor in “High School Musical.” He appeared in a few minor films in the early 2000s and appeared in four episodes of the soap opera “The Bold and the Beautiful.” He also appeared in “Zoey 101” and “The Bernie Mac Show” before being cast as Zeke. Like Olesya Rulin, Chris Warren Jr. has continued to act full time since the conclusion of “High School Musical.” He appeared as Xander in “Alvin and the Chipmunks 2,” Patterson in MTV’s “The Hard Times of RJ Berger,” and Ty Hensdale in eight episodes of “The Fosters.”\n\n#6: Monique Coleman\n\nBefore being cast as Taylor McKessie, Monique Coleman appeared in numerous TV shows, including “Gilmore Girls,” “Veronica Mars,” and “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.” She was also a contestant on the third season of “Dancing with the Stars,” where she finished fourth with Louis van Amstel. She has continued to appear primarily on television, with her most substantial role being that of Katina Howard on the web series “Guidance.” She also launched an online talk show titled “Gimme Mo’” in 2010 and went on a world tour raising awareness for today’s youth as the UN Youth Champion.\n\n#5: Corbin Bleu\n\nCorbin Bleu has certainly remained active since the conclusion of “High School Musical.” He has dabbled in film, appearing in “Nurse 3D,” “Sugar,” and “The Monkey’s Paw.” He has also remained active on television, with roles in “Castle,” “The Fosters,” and “The Middle,” among others. But it seems as if his true love is theatre. Bleu has appeared in the Broadway productions “In the Heights” and “Godspell” and has performed in both “Hairspray” and “Mamma Mia!” at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2018 he apeared as Don Lockwood in a production of “Singin’ in the Rain” at the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre.\n\n#4: Lucas Grabeel\n\nLucas Grabeel is the type of actor who seems to be in everything. Grabeel has enjoyed steady work in the television circuit since the conclusion of “High School Musical.” He has lent his voice to numerous animated shows, including “Robot Chicken,” “Phineas and Ferb,” “The Cleveland Show,” and “Family Guy.” However, his most well-known role is easily that of Toby Kennish in “Switched at Birth,” a role that has earned him three separate Teen Choice Award nominations, including two for Choice TV Actor Drama.\n\n#3: Ashley Tisdale\n\nAshley Tisdale has been in front of the camera her whole life. As a child, she appeared in over 100 ads and continuously performed in both television and theatre. And while she found success with “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody,” she became a household name by playing Sharpay Evans. Since that time, she has remained incredibly busy. Along with continued work in TV and film (including the starring role in “Scary Movie 5”), Tisdale has released two albums and started a production company called Blondie Girl Productions which has produced shows like “Miss Advised” and “Young & Hungry.”\n\n#2: Vanessa Hudgens\n\nVanessa Hudgens found mainstream success by playing Gabriella Montez in “High School Musical” and she hasn’t looked back. After the success of the first movie, Hudgens signed a record deal with Hollywood Records and released two albums in 2006 and 2008. However, she has since focused primarily on TV and film, with appearances in “Spring Breakers” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,” among others. She has also enjoyed success in live theatre, including the role of Rizzo in the Fox production “Grease: Live” and the lead, titular role in the 2015 Broadway revival of “Gigi.”\n\n#1: Zac Efron\n\nYeah, there was an actor in “High School Musical” named Zac Efron. You may have heard of him. After landing the role of Troy, Efron shot off to superstardom. He has since become one of the biggest names in Hollywood, appearing in blockbusters like “Neighbors,” “The Disaster Artist,” “Baywatch,” and “The Greatest Showman.” He has two movies coming in 2018, including a role as the infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. Efron is easily the biggest name to come from “High School Musical,” and it seems as if his career is just getting started. We can’t wait to see what he does next!"
