And I think for where it was, I think that it did a great job of representing different people.”\n\nThe actress and UN youth activist also gave advice to young stars who seem to have had trouble adjusting to fame and said it’s essential to have a strong sense of self and “that you say ‘no’ a lot.” She said, “When I started out, I really wanted to be picked…every role I got felt like it validated my existence. And now, I don’t feel that way.”"
