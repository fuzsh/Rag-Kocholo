And I said, 'Guys, you know this is not at all what I want to do?'\" he shared. \"And they were like, 'Really?'\"\n\nThe actor has since gone on to take on more serious portrayals including Ted Bundy in Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.\n\nAlongside his upcoming role as pro wrestler Kevin Von Erich in The Iron Claw, Efron also received a Daytime Emmy Award for his Netflix travel docuseries Down to Earth with Zac Efron.\n\nGabriella Montez - Vanessa Hudgens\n\nAfter gaining stardom as the academically inclined newbie at East High, Hudgens continued her venture into Hollywood and starred in more Disney Channel shows.\n\nShe then embarked on a music career and released two albums with the 2008’s Identified peaking at 28 on the Billboard 200 charts.\n\nHudgens then made her Broadway debut in the titular role of the 2015 musical production of Gigi.\n\nThe actress has since made several business ventures as the co-founder of Cali-Water, KNOW Beauty and the Thomas Ashbourne Craft Spirits.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nOnly Murders in the Building season 3 welcomes Meryl Streep and Paul Rudd [LATEST]\n\nHollywood execs push AI Robot future with $900k positions despite actors strike [INSIGHT]\n\nHaunted Mansion review - Rosario Dawson has been robbed [REVIEW]\n\nSharpay Evans - Ashley Tisdale\n\nTisdale was used to the limelight as she had already been acting on Disney’s The Suite Life of Zac and Cody as Maddie Fitzpatrick.\n\nWhile High School Musical propelled her career further, she stayed behind the screens and instead lent her voice to the animated series, Phineas and Ferb as their irritable older sister Candace.\n\nAs well as other shows including Sabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch, American Dad!, and Ginger Snaps.\n\nTisdale then featured as a judge on The Masked Singer after releasing three albums.\n\nHowever, after getting married to musician Christian French and giving birth to daughter Jupiter Iris, she turned her attention to interior design with her business Frenshe Interiors.\n\nMonique Coleman - Taylor McKessie\n\nThroughout High School Musical, Coleman starred as Gabriella’s best friend Taylor and captain of the scholastic decathlon team.\n\nPrior to the film, she had appeared in several small roles on shows such as Gilmore Girls, Boston Public, Veronica Mars, and as Mary Margaret on The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\n\nIn 2006, Coleman went on to star in Dancing with the Stars and finished in fourth place in the competition.\n\nAs well as her acting career, she is also credited for her behind-the-scenes work as the producer of her own documentary series called Gimme MO.\n\nThe 42-year-old reprised her role as Taylor for the final season of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series is available to stream on Disney Plus in the USA."
