        "text": "We now know what happens after the original characters of \"High School Musical\" left the hallowed halls of East High.\n\nIn the fourth season of the Disney+ show \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series,\" several fates or the original characters are revealed.\n\nThe \"super-meta\" series — as the series creator calls it — is a TV show set in the present about kids who attend the physical high school where the original Disney Channel movies were filmed. This season, released on Aug. 9, viewers see both the old and new characters band together to film a fictional \"High School Musical 4.\"\n\nRead on to see what we know about each original character and how their story ended:\n\nTaylor McKessie (played by Monique Coleman)\n\nFans first got a sneak peek of the latest and final season of \"HSMTMTS\" on July 25, when Disney+ and series creator and executive producer Tim Federle posted a teaser clip of the opening scene from the season to social media.\n\nIn the clip, it's revealed that original cast members Corbin Bleu, Monique Coleman, Lucas Grabeel and Kaycee Stroh all have returned to film the fake \"HSM 4.\" They are seen taking the stage to sing about a 15-year class reunion, and introducing Coleman's character, Taylor McKessie, as the current principal of East High.\n\nIt's not clear how she ended up back at East High as McKessie went to Yale University to study political science in the final \"HSM\" film.\n\nThe clip also features Alyson Reed’s character, the quirky Mrs. Darbus, who is retiring, as well as Bart Johnson’s Coach Jack Bolton, who seemingly rolls his eyes at Darbus’ retirement announcement.\n\nThe teaser clip shows Corbin Bleu's character, Chad Danforth, and McKessie and sharing a sweet moment.\n\n\"If you would've told me 15 years ago at our graduation that I would some day be the principal of East High School...\" she says in the clip.\n\n\"I would've said that sounds about right,\" Danforth says.\n\nChad Danforth (played by Corbin Bleu)\n\nBleu was actually in the previous season of the show, playing himself and directing a documentary about the current cast starring in a theater camp musical production of \"Frozen.\"\n\nIn an early scene from Season Four, Bleu reveals details about what happened to their classic “High School Musical” characters.\n\nHe says that Danforth and McKessie are happily married. We had previously seen McKessie go college in New Haven, Connecticut, and Danforth stayed local, attending the fictional University of Albuquerque to play basketball.\n\nThe real University of Albuquerque closed in 1986 but the franchise’s second film portrays it in the “HSM” universe as a large, seemingly Division I school.\n\nBleu goes on to reveal that Martha Cox (played by Stroh) is a successful choreographer.\n\nRyan Evans (played by Lucas Grabeel)\n\nIn the opening scene of Season Four it is revealed that Ryan Evans is happily partnered with Pentatonix singer Scott Hoying. The two share a kiss and Hoying declares his love for the performer.\n\nLater, in a scene with Bleu and Coleman, Grabeel says his character and his partner are expecting twins. In the season’s fourth episode, two of the younger high school students perform a duet Ryan Evans and his partner Hoying, who \"never really got a name\" in the fictional film, supposedly sang. The duet's lyrics imply the two have some sort of fight in the film and then get back together.\n\n\"I know this isn't perfect but I know you make me better / so let's live inside this moment and forget about forever / and no matter what you say or do / I'll be running back to you / over and over again.\"\n\nTroy Bolton and Gabriella Montez\n\nBleu says in the same scene that Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) are in couples therapy.\n\nThe opening scene also features an explanation for their absence from the fictional film.\n\nAt one point, the senior Bolton asks if Sharpay Evans (played by Ashley Tisdale), Montez and his son have arrived there yet.\n\n“Not yet coach, they have been silent in the group chat,” Stroh, in character as Martha Cox, tells the elder Bolton.\n\nThe final “High School Musical 3: Senior Year” film showed the two leads, Montez and the younger Bolton, going to Stanford and University of California, Berkeley to stay together.\n\nPreviously, series creator Federle said that the invitation to appear in the fourth and final season of the spin-off show had been extended to all of the original stars.\n\n\"It’s a matter of juggling and holding my breath and praying and lighting candles and seeing who wants to come play with us,\" he told People in 2022.\n\nIn Episode Six of \"HSMTMTS\" Season Four, it's revealed that though Hudgens has not appeared on the Disney+ show, her character, Montez, has a solo song titled \"Dreams Don't Die.\"\n\nThe song, which is performed by freshman character Emmy (Liamani Segura) in the show seems to address the aforementioned marital issues the leading couple was facing.\n\n\"Who says the curtain is closing on the time of lives? / How could I sleep at night, pretending I'm fine / leaving it all behind when dreams don't die.\"\n\n\"Wherever I go / you'll follow me home / and I'd always know that dreams don't die / So I take them for granted / but you could be off taking chances.\"\n\nShe concludes she will \"give it all\" she's got, though it's never revealed exactly what she is giving her all at.\n\nSharpay Evans (played by Ashley Tisdale)\n\nSo far, it doesn't appear Sharpay Evans will return to East High, despite the third film ending with her agreeing to return to help Darbus run the drama department.\n\nIn 2011, Tisdale returned to the bedazzled role in \"Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure,\" where she went to New York City to pursue a broadway career, but her dog lands an acting gig first. She eventually schemes her way to a lead role on Broadway in the fictional show \"A Girl's Best Friend.\"\n\nWhat happens in (fictional) 'High School Musical 4'?\n\nThe cast of the fictional \"High School Musical 4\" offers some explanation of the film's plot in the premiere episode of Season Four.\n\nEvidently the \"future of the East High drama department is on the line,\" according to Bleu. The \"hook\" of the film is that Darbus is retiring, and Reed returns to the role.\n\nMuch of the season is dedicated to the current students of East High starring in the fictional movie being filmed on their campus. Gina Porter, played by actor Sofia Wylie, is cast in the teen female lead of the film, playing a Mensa-level cheerleader named Bailey.\n\nIn Episode Six, Johnson reveals in a social media video that at the end of the film, Porter's character convinces Darbus not to retire.\n\nCaitlin Reilly plays Quinn Robbins, the director of the fictional “HSM 4.”\n\nThe original \"High School Musical\" film debuted in the United States in January 2006 and the final film in the original series hit theaters in October 2008.\n\nThe Disney+ show is in its final season, Federle said in his July 25 post.\n\n\"After four years at East High, it’s time to graduate. This will be our final, endgame season.\" Federle wrote, in part. \"This show brought the most extraordinary cast — and crew and collaborators — to my life.\"\n\n\"We can’t wait to share this epic 4th act with you all.”\n\nThe show — abbreviated \"HSMTMTS\" by fans — launched the careers of several musicians, including pop star Olivia Rodrigo, who played Nini Salazar-Roberts.\n\nThe \"Driver's License\" singer did not return to the series for the final season, a representative from Disney+ previously confirmed to TODAY.com on July 26.\n\nThe Season Three finale showed her character moving to the West Coast to finish her senior year and continue pursuing her dreams of becoming a singer-songwriter."
