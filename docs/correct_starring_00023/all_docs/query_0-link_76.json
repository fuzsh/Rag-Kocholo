        "text": "Monique Coleman faced depression after being excluded from the “High School Musical 3” promotion tour.\n\nMonique Coleman, who played Taylor McKessie in the film franchise, was heartbroken when she wasn’t invited to tour with her co-stars. While guest starring on the “Vulnerable” podcast hosted by another former Disney star Christy Carlson Romano, Monique Coleman said:\n\n“Disney really broke my heart.”\n\nThe actress explained:\n\n“When I got to the third movie I, in so many ways, I really championed the film. I really always spoke to positively and I was a Black girl playing the smartest girl in school, which was a very big deal at that time.”\n\nThe 42-year-old continued:\n\n“When it came to promoting the third movie I wasn’t invited on the tour. They said something about there not being enough room on the plane. They only invited Zac [Efron], Vanessa [Hudgens], Ashley [Tisdale], and Corbin [Bleu], and Lucas [Grabeel] and I weren’t included.”\n\nElaborating on her heartbreak, she shared:\n\n“That heartbreak really hit me very deeply and did cause a bit depression because it helped me to recognize that I was overly identifying with what I was doing and not who I was. That was what led me to take that step and say ‘maybe this is my five minutes of fame, maybe this is it in someway and if that is the case then what am I going to do with it?’”\n\n@christycarlsonromano\n\n@Monique Coleman is one of the strongest women I know. ?? @Vulnerable Podcast #hsm #hsmtmts #disneychannel #podcast #moniquecoleman\n\n? original sound – ChristyCarlsonRomano\n\n“High School Musical” first premiered on the Disney Channel in 2006. The film centers around basketball captain Troy Bolton (portrayed by Zac Efron) and shy math student Gabriella Montez (portrayed by Vanessa Hudgens) as they form a romantic bond after signing up to be in their high school’s musical.\n\nThe sequel premiered in 2007. The third film in the series, “High School Musical 3: Senior Year,” was released in theaters the following year and grossed over $250 million at the box office.\n\nDespite getting her heart broken by the franchise, Coleman said she wouldn’t mind working with Disney again. The South Carolina native added:\n\n“I would be so open to working with Disney again, especially with Disney+ there’s so much more opportunity.”\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Disney excluding Monique Coleman from touring with the High School Musical cast? Tell us below."
