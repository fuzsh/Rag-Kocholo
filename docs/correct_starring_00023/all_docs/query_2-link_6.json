And I was a Black girl playing the smartest girl in school, which was a very big deal.”\n\nIn turn, she admitted that the “heartbreak” hit her deeply and took a serious toll on her mental health.\n\n“It did cause a bit of depression, because it helped me to recognize that I was overly identifying with what I was doing, and not who I was,” she explained. “And that was what led me to take that step and say, ‘Maybe this is my five minutes of fame? Maybe this is it?’”\n\nIn hindsight, Monique said that the exclusion ended up being the setback she needed to move on with her career and start thinking about her next steps.\n\n“I always saw myself as more than just someone who was able to book a job. I knew that there were other things that I wanted to contribute in this world,” she said.\n\nBut of course, she made it clear that there are no hard feelings and that she’s grateful for her costars, to whom she felt like a “big sister.”\n\nIn fact, she’ll soon be making a triumphant turn to East High, reuniting with a few of her OG costars for a cameo on Season 4 of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series later next year.\n\n“It will be as nostalgic as everyone expects it to be,” she told E! News of the highly anticipated comeback, where she’s set to be joined by Corbin and Lucas, along with Alyson Reed, who played Ms. Darbus, Kaycee Stroh, who played Martha, and Coach Bolton himself, Bart Johnson.\n\n“It was so special going back into the gym for the first time because it's not only been 15 fictitious years, but it's also been 15 years in our real lives,” she went on. “We've been married, and divorced, and had kids, and it was just so special to be back with everybody.”\n\nSince the cameos were announced, fans have speculated that Zac, Vanessa, and Ashely might also be set to make surprise appearances, particularly after both Zac and Vanessa mysteriously visited the original East High school within a few weeks of each other back in July.\n\nBut, before you get your hopes up, Vanessa seemed to deny that her nostalgic trip had anything to do with a future cameo, clarifying instead that she’d simply paid a visit to the original set because she happened to be in the area with her boyfriend.\n\nWell, I guess we’ll have to wait and see!"
