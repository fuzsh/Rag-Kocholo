And in the years since, it has only grown in popularity, with subsequent movies and musicals being released after the success of the first movie.\n\nThe first movie follows the unlikely relationship of basketball star Troy and the bookish Gabriella as they audition for the high school musical. Troy, Gabriella, and the rest of the main cast are juniors at East High School in the first \"HSM\" film.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nUnlike some movies like \"Grease,\" where the cast was much older than their on-screen characters, many of the cast members of \"HSM\" were relatively close to being high school-aged during the film. But some were still far too old to still be in high school.\n\nKeep reading to see the real ages of the cast of the first \"HSM\" movie compared to their characters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEast High School basketball star Troy Bolton is 16 or 17 years old.\n\nThe junior is the captain of the varsity basketball team and the most popular male student at East High. With the help of Gabriella Montez, Troy also embraces his artistic side.\n\nZac Efron was 18 while filming \"High School Musical.\"\n\nAt 18, Bolton would have either been wrapping up senior year or he'd be playing college hoops already. Still, since Efron is only one or two years older than his character, it makes the performance pretty believable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTroy's love interest and musical partner, Gabriella Montez, is also 16 or 17.\n\nGabriella met Troy at a New Year's Eve party. When the two are called upon to sing a karaoke duet, it's immediately apparent they have chemistry.\n\nWhen Troy and Gabriella return to school from winter break, they audition for the school musical and find themselves struggling to attend callbacks for the lead roles while Troy juggles basketball and Gabriella juggles East High's Scholastic Decathlon Team.\n\nShe's played by Vanessa Hudgens, who turned 18 while filming the movie.\n\nHudgens was still of high school age while filming the movie, but a year or two older than her character would be as a junior. She's one of the cast members with the closest age to their character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEast High Drama Club co-president Sharpay Evans is also a junior.\n\nLike most of the junior class, Sharpay is also 16 or 17 years old. Throughout the first film, Sharpay and her brother, Ryan, attempt to sabotage Troy and Gabriella's chance to attend callbacks. The twins have worked their entire lives to star as leads in a musical and feel the roles are being stolen from them.\n\nAshley Tisdale was 20 at the time.\n\nTisdale was a few years older than Sharpay would have been but still pulled off the theater diva well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan Evans is the same age as his twin sister, Sharpay.\n\nLike his twin sister (and fellow East High Drama Club co-president) Ryan is 16 or 17.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucas Grabeel was actually 22 at the time.\n\nIn January, Grabeel spoke with Insider's Olivia Singh and weighed in on whether Sharpay was the villain or victim of the movie.\n\n\"I don't think she's a victim at all,\" Grabeel told Insider. \"Look at the reasons. You can say that she's a victim by saying, 'Oh, poor her because she didn't get this or she didn't get that.' But why is she going for it in the first place? She's conniving in undermining Gabriella. She's usurping her at every corner.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChad Danforth is Troy's best friend and co-captain of the basketball team. He's also 16 or 17.\n\nChad was known for wearing T-shirts with wacky phrases like \"I majored in vacation\" and carrying a basketball everywhere he went.\n\nCorbin Bleu was 16 years old when filming \"HSM.\"\n\nBleu's real age is a spot-on match for his \"HSM\" character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScholastic Decathlon Team captain Taylor McKessie, who was also 16 or 17, had some pretty ambitious goals for a junior.\n\nDuring the \"High School Musical\" series, Taylor dreamed of becoming president of the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 25, Monique Coleman was the oldest cast member of the core characters.\n\nColeman was nearly a decade older than her on-screen character. The actress recently told Insider's Olivia Singh that her character wore a headband throughout the series because the crew didn't know how to style Black hair.\n\n\"The truth is, is that they had done my hair, and they had done it very poorly in the front,\" she told Insider. She added that because there wasn't a lot of time to fix her hair before filming, crewmembers suggested she \"incorporate headbands into her character\" and \"just make that a part of who she is.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelsi Nielsen, the theater student who composed the musical Twinkle Towne, was also 16 or 17.\n\nIn addition to the pretty important role of composing the musical that's at the center of the movie, Kelsi also played the piano during the auditions.\n\nShe was played by Olesya Rulin, who was 19 at the time.\n\nIf Kelsi was 19 like Rulin, she'd already be at college, probably studying something to do with music.\n\nRead next\n\nCelebrity Disney\n\nAdvertisement"
