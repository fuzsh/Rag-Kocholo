        "text": "Oh it so old movie now.. I remember when it was hot news..\n\nI didn’t care much of this movie and all that sequels at first, but then I saw on youtube first time damn.. I liked it 😀 Even though I didn’t understand everything but then it came on TV and we recorded it.\n\nI like almost all song and whole movie. But I still like that movie, they all are so young and cute here. 😀 But typical thing is (it’s Disney what can I say) bad turns good at the end.. .and in next movie they are bad again..\n\nSharpay:”We need to save our show from people who don’t know the difference between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk.”\n\nMrs.Bolton:” Did we really fly all this way just to play more basketball?”\n\nJack ja Troy:”Yeah.”\n\nDarbus:” Was that a cell phone?”\n\nKelsi:”No ma’am, that was the warning bell.”\n\nTroy:” Uh-oh. I better…”\n\nChad:”No. You do NOT want to get into that man. Too much drama.”\n\nDarbus:”Mr. Danforth! This is a place of learning, not a hockey arena.”\n\nChad:” Look, you’re a hoops dude. Not a musical singer person. Have you ever seen Michael Crawford on a cereal box?”\n\nTroy:”Who’s Michael Crawford?”\n\nChad:”Exactly my point.”\n\nChad:” How can you expect the rest of us to be focused on a game when you’re off somewhere in leotards singing ‘Twinkle Town’…”\n\nTroy:”No one said ANYTHING about leotards.”\n\nChad:”Not yet my friend, but just you wait.”\n\nSharpay:”We have to do something.”\n\nTroy:” Whoa, don’t tell me you’re good at hoops too.”\n\nGabriella:”You know, I once scored 41 points on a league game.”\n\nTroy:”No way.”\n\nGabriella:”Mmhmm. Yeah, and on the same day I invented the space shuttle and microwaved popcorn.”\n\nTroy:”Ah, microwave popcorn. Haha, very funny.”\n\nSkatedude 1:”If Troy can tell his secret, then I’m coming clean. I play the cello! ”\n\nSkatedude 2: ” Awesome! What is it? A saw?”\n\nSkaterdude 1:”No dude, it’s like a giant violin!”\n\nSharpay:”Someone’s gotta tell her the rules.”\n\nTroy:”Excatly….And what’re the rules?”\n\nChad:”So, you’re coming with me to the after-party, right?”\n\nTaylor:”As in, like, a date?”\n\nChad:”Must be your lucky day.”\n\nDarbus:”That’ll be 15 minutes for you as well, Mr. Danforth. Count ’em! ”\n\nTaylor:” That might be difficult for Chad, since he probably can’t count that high. ”\n\nJack Bolton:”Where’s my team, Darbus… What the heck are those two doing in a tree?”\n\nDarbus:”It’s called crime and punishment, Bolton. Beside, proximity to the arts is cleansing for the soul.”\n\nJack:”Can we have a talk? Please? And you two, in the gym… now.”\n\nDarbus:” This school is about more than just young men in baggy shorts flinging balls for touchdowns.”\n\nJack:”Baskets. Uh, they shoot baskets.”\n\nChad:”Hey, the whole team’s htting the gym for free period, what do you want us to run?”\n\nTroy:”I can’t – I, uh, have to catch up on, uh, homework.”\n\nChad:”What? It’s only the second day back, even I’m not even behind on homework yet. And I’ve been behind on homework since preschool.”\n\nGabriella:”You’re a cool guy, Troy. But not for the reasons your friends think.”\n\nChad:” What spell has this elevated IQ temptress girl cast that suddenly makes you wanna be in a musical?”\n\nChad:” People are starting to do other stuff. Okay, stuff that’s not their stuff.”\n\nTroy:” Now that’s impossible.”\n\nSharpay:”What’s impossible,Troy? I wouldn’t think “impossible” was in your vocabulary.”\n\nGuy:”Hey, you know what? Someday you guys might thank me for this. Or Not.”\n\nJack:” You’re the playmaker… not a singer… right?”\n\nTroy:”Did you ever think that maybe I could be both?”\n\nTroy:”That’s travelling. No, that’s really bad travelling.”\n\n10/8)"
