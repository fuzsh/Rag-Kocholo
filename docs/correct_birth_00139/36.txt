Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul has brought his underdog campaign to Philadelphia.

Paul spoke to poncho-wearing and umbrella-holding supporters about limited government and the cost of America's foreign policy on Sunday as a steady rain fell at the site near the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed.

Paul, who was born and raised in Pittsburgh, also spoke at the University of Pittsburgh on Friday ahead of Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary.

The Texas congressman trails far behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the race to capture the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination at the Republican National Convention in August. The campaign, however, says it raised more than $10 million in the first quarter of the year and has zero debt.
