        "meta_description": "Ron Paul is the Social Studies and English Teacher at SBWIB YouthBuild.  He spent his teenage years on the Central Coast of California, running track and graduating from Arroyo Grande High School.  After two years at Allan Hancock College, Ron transferred to California State University, Northridge.  Midway through his junior year, he decided to change majors from Business Administration to History.  A career in teaching would prove to be more fulfilling than becoming a banker.\nMr. Paul’s teaching career began at a small private school in the San Fernando Valley, teaching the 3rd grade.  Over the last three decades, he has taught all grades except for kindergarten and 1st grade.  For about the last ten years, he has taught at the middle and high school levels, teaching Social Studies and some math and English.  Since 2019, he has worked for YouthBuild, first at the Antelope Valley campus and now at the Lennox site.  These years have been the most enjoyable and fulfilling of his career. \nMr. Paul and his wife have been married since 1992 and have two adult children.",
