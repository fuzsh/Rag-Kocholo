        "text": "Ronald Ernest “Ron” Paul is a physician turned politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives for Texas multiple times. His political ideologies are a combination of Libertarian and Republican views and he is an outspoken critic of the federal government’s fiscal policies, especially the Federal Reserve and the War on Drugs. A physician by profession, he worked as an obstetrician-gynecologist and helped to deliver more than 4,000 babies. He served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force and later with the U.S. Air National Guard. The son of a dairy farmer, he earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from Duke University's School of Medicine and specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. He was also deeply interested in economics. Acquainted with the economists Hans Sennholz and Murray Rothbard, the doctor also developed his own economic theories. He entered politics and served in the U.S. House of Representatives for Texas’s 14th and 22nd congressional districts. He was made the first chairman of the conservative PAC Citizens for a Sound Economy and hailed as the “intellectual godfather” of the Tea Party Movement. He is a prolific writer and has authored several works on political and economic theory."
