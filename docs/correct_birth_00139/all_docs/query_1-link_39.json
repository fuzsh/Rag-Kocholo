        "text": "Ron Paul: Republican platform ignores real causes of inflation\n\nIt remains up to those of us who know the truth to keep spreading the message that the real key to making America great again is to make money real...\n\nRon Paul: The presidential debate should be a wake-up call for Americans\n\nNeither candidate seems to realize that the world has changed.\n\nRon Paul: Stop taxing tips\n\nIf the government stopped trying to run our lives and run the world, there would be no need to punish hard-working Americans by taxing their tips.\n\nRon Paul: We spent a billion dollars fighting the Houthis…and lost\n\nWe have the most expensive military on earth, they say. That may be true, but it is also irrelevant.\n\nRon Paul: Anti-liberty conservatives want more theft\n\nGovernment deficits are a symptom of the abandonment of the moral truths of individual rights and limited government for the immoral lies of the welfare-warfare state and the fiat money...\n\nRon Paul: The Trump trial and our injustice system\n\nThe repeated attempts at using “lawfare” to remove Trump from the political scene have all backfired and actually have served to make the former president even more popular among voters.\n\nBiden’s tariffs are another nail in the dollar’s coffin\n\nPresident Biden recently raised taxes on American consumers and businesses and may have hastened the end of the dollar’s world reserve currency status.\n\nRon Paul: The Vietnamization of Ukraine\n\nAs Ukraine’s defeat in the war moves closer, the neocons are desperate to draw the US further into the fight.\n\nRon Paul: Will the Fed lose control?\n\nThe government’s excessive spending and debt is leading to what some economists call “fiscal dominance.”"
