        "text": "Ron Paul, born August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a long time U.S. Representative from Texas with a strong constitutionalist and libertarian voting record. Paul has been nicknamed \"Dr. No\" for his opposition to tax increases and spending bills. He has chastened his fellow Republicans for abandoning the party's ideals, and for helping to create an unsustainable national debt now in the trillions of dollars. Paul seeks to \"reinstate the Constitution and restore the Republic.\"\n\nOn 11 January 2007, Paul filed papers to form an exploratory committee for the 2008 presidential race. He formally declared his candidacy 12 March 2007 as a guest on Washington Journal on C-SPAN. He is not running as a Libertarian as he did nearly two decades ago. Paul has the distinction of being opposed to the Iraq War and interventionist US foreign policy.\n\nHe is one of 7 Republican congressman who voted against Iraq War authorization in October 2002. He has also opposed George W. Bush and the majority of Republican congressmen on many other issues, including the PATRIOT Act. His record on these issues means he may draw support from some surprising circles, including anti-war activists and paleoconservatives.\n\nOn 20 February 2007, Paul's exploratory committee posted a formal video of him explaining his reason for running on YouTube.\n\nLatest News - Courtesy of Representative Paul's Website\n\n[rss::20::bullet-nolead] -->\n\n[include:politics_and_elections/includes/disclaimer.inc]"
