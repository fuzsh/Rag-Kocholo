        "text": "IOWA CITY, Iowa — On the eve of the first-in-the-nation vote, former Texas congressman Ron Paul made a final push for liberty, saying it’s the only thing that “can bring people together.”\n\nThe three-time presidential candidate appeared in front of one of his son’s larger crowds in Iowa. He encouraged voters to ignore the polls and “send a message” on Monday that an “irate minority” can make a difference. Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul, Ron’s third child, sits at 5% in Iowa, according to the latest poll.\n\n“Once the ideas of liberty become weak in our hearts, that’s the only time tyrants can become successful,” the elder Paul said. “But the good news is, the love of liberty is growing by leaps and bounds.”\n\nOther Republican candidates argue for bigger government, but Rand Paul will “work toward a freer society” that gives Americans back their basic rights and “the fruits of their labor,” Ron Paul said. Rand Paul's message of free market economics, criminal justice reform and a “sensible” foreign policy will work to bring the country together, he said.\n\nRon Paul spoke for about 20 minutes at the University of Iowa before introducing his son to the campaign-estimated crowd of about 1,500. Rand Paul spoke in front of two teleprompters, an unusual move for the Kentucky senator, who typically stays unscripted on the trail.\n\nPaul tailored his message to those students he calls “the leave-me-alone generation.” His liberty-themed speech focused on the ideas of a small government that does not collect phone records, reduces the number of laws and regulations and honors the entire Bill of Rights.\n\nPaul said Democrats and Republicans “infringe on civil liberties” and “assault” the Bill of Rights: the left on the right to bear arms and the right on the right to privacy. He pledged to end bulk collection of cell\n\nHe elicited the help of Pink Floyd’s infamous “Shine on You Crazy Diamond” to drive home his point that free ideas are the most powerful weapon.\n\n“For the crazy diamonds to shine, government must get out of the way,\" he said. \"The leave-me-alone generation is a generation that believes they can conquer the world and solve any problems if left free to follow their dreams. You are the leave-me-alone-generation, and I want you to shine, shine on.”"
