        "text": "Ronald A. Paul, 65, of Quakertown passed peacefully at his home on June 24, 2023. He was born in Lansdale, PA on August 2, 1957 to Mary (Murphy) Paul and the late George Paul Jr. He was the loving husband of Barbara (Kintner) Paul for 44 years. Ronald was a generous and giving man who always offered to help others, even if he was in pain himself. He always gave 100% and he always made sure everyone else was taken care of. While Ronald was in high school he played baseball and soccer. He was an avid Phillies, Flyers, and Eagles fan. He was a Scout Leader for several years and was a regular part of their archery program. He loved the outdoors and regularly hunted, fished, and camped. He and Barbara loved to travel, with St. Lucia a particularly ideal destination. Ronald was a hard worker who started at around 13 years old delivering newspapers. He went on to be a machinist for 25+ years, then worked security for several years before working at Wawa for 10 years. Ronald was a certified mason who helped build the Nor-Gwyn pool.\n\nRonald is survived by his wife; children Melissa Gelatt and Timothy Paul; 2 grandchildren; siblings Roseanne (Bob) Schmidt, Mary Kalogeras, Robert (Debbie) Paul, Margaret (Larry) Hange, and George (Patricia) Paul; 12 nieces and nephews; many great nieces and nephews; and many other loving family and friends.\n\nAll are invited on Thursday, June 29 to Naugle Funeral & Cremation Service, 135 W. Pumping Station Rd., Quakertown, PA 18951 to a viewing from 6-8pm. An additional viewing will be held on Friday, June 30 at St. Agnes Catholic Church, 445 N. Main St., Sellersville, PA 18960 from 10-10:45am. A mass will follow at 11am. Interment at Holy Cross Cemetery, Pennsburg, will follow mass."
