        "text": "The perennial White House hopeful and libertarian folk hero this week launched his new online show â€“ a place 'where I can finally express my opinion, unfiltered and uninterrupted'. Adam Gabbatt reports\n\nSarah Posner: Do supporters of the small-government libertarian realise how wedded Paul is to a rigidly dogmatic religious conservatism?\n\nDean Baker: Washington policy-makers say the deficit is the greatest threat to the US economy. In reality, it's the failure of banking reform\n\nPaul Harris: As GOP debates moderation, the Tea Party have found their champion in the rising star. Will he carry them to the presidency?\n\nColin Horgan: Republicans face two likely paths for their party's future: Ron Paul's libertarianism or a more moderate base\n\nJames Antle: In the wake of Romney's defeat, some GOP soul-searching is inevitable. But don't mistake a flawed candidate for a failed party\n\nSecond day of walkouts by Maine delegates at Republican national convention after delegate plan stymied by GOP officials"
