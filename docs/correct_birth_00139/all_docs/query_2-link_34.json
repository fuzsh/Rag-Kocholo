        "text": "(born 1935). American politician Ron Paul served as a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives over a course of four decades (1976–77, 1979–85, 1997–2013). In 1988 he unsuccessfully ran as the Libertarian presidential candidate. He later sought the Republican nomination for president in 2008 and 2012.\n\nRonald Ernest Paul was born on August 20, 1935, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania in 1957 with a degree in biology, and in 1961 he received a medical degree from Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina. In the 1960s he served as a flight surgeon first for the U.S. Air Force and then for the Air National Guard. In 1968 Paul established a successful obstetrics and gynecological practice in Texas.\n\nPaul became interested in politics in the early 1970s, running unsuccessfully for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974. His opponent, however, resigned before completing his term, and Paul won a special election to take his place. Paul lost the seat in the subsequent general election, only to regain it two years later. He did not run in 1984 but instead campaigned for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, which he lost. He ran as a Libertarian candidate in the 1988 presidential election, ultimately winning more than 430,000 votes. In 1997 he returned to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican, although he did not always vote in accordance with the majority of his party. For example, in the early 21st century he voted against authorizing the Iraq War and the USA Patriot Act.\n\nPaul’s presidential campaign platform in 2008 remained libertarian in spirit. It focused on free-market economics, a radical decrease in the size of government, increased privacy protections for individuals, and a reduction of U.S. participation in international organizations. Having claimed only a handful of delegates, he ended his bid for the White House in June 2008. In April 2011 Paul, who was popular within the Tea Party movement, formed an exploratory committee to assess the viability of a third presidential run. The following month he formally announced his candidacy. In January 2012 he garnered a second-place finish in the New Hampshire presidential primary, but by May he had announced that he would not actively campaign in the remaining states. Paul retired from the House of Representatives in January 2013."
