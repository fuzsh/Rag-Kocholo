        "text": "Rand Paul is an American politician who presently serves as the junior U.S. Senator from Kentucky. Letâs explore Rand Paul net worth, career, etc below;\n\nRand Paul Biography\n\nRand was born in Pittsburgh but grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas, where he attended Brazoswood High School. In 1981, he enrolled at Baylor University.\n\nHe was a regular contributor to the student newspaper âThe Baylor Lariatâ while studying there.\n\nHe was also a member of the NoZe Brotherhood, a collegiate society at the university. He dropped out of college to pursue his education at Duke University School of Medicine.\n\nAlthough Paul was born in Pennsylvania, he would grow up chiefly in Texas. While growing up, Rand Paul was raised in a church-going family; they are Episcopalian by faith.\n\nIn 1988, he received his medical degree, and in 1993, he finished his residency. He went on to work for John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers. He subsequently went to work for the Graves Gilbert Clinic in Bowling Green, where he stayed for 10 years before opening his clinic.\n\nPaul is a leader who promotes freedom and liberty, and he has even described himself as a libertarian Republican. Although Paul is one of the âcooler headsâ in the Senate, he is unafraid to confront his political opponents with facts and data to back his stance.\n\nRand Paulâs first ophthalmologist job was with the Downing McPeak Vision Centers. He also worked at the Graves Gilbert Clinic, then he established his own private practice.\n\nPaul still has an interest in this practice; however, once he was elected to the Senate, he merged his practice with his former employer at Downing. Currently, Paul has medical privileges at two hospitals in Bowling Green.\n\nIn 1991, Rand founded the North Carolina Taxpayers Union. This was in response to President George H.W. Bushâs promise not to raise taxes. He would later establish the Kentucky Taxpayers United.\n\nIn both 2013 and 2014, Rand Paul was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the worldâs â100 Most Influential People.â\n\nRand has been around politics most of his life. He interned at his fatherâs Congressional office as a young teenager. He was present when his father headed the Texas delegation during Ronald Reaganâs presidential campaign in 1976.\n\nRand Paul was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Carol and Ron Paul. Ron, his father, is a politician and a doctor.\n\nHis father is a former U.S. Representative from Texas who ran for President three times. Rand was the third child born to his parents, who had five children in total.\n\nRand Paul grew up around both medicine and politics, as his father, former presidential candidate and physician Ron Paul was no stranger to either of those areas.\n\nIn 1990, Paul married Kelley Paul. Kelley is a self-employed writer.\n\nOne of Paulâs ears is deaf. He is now a resident of Bowling Green, Kentucky.\n\nPaulâs wife is also an author and published the book True and Constant Friends: Love and Inspiration from Our Grandmothers, Mothers, and Friends, in 2015.\n\nIn April 2021, Kelley made headlines after she bought stock in Gilead, a company that makes the Covid-19 treatment remdesivir.\n\nThroughout the course of their 30-year-marriage, the couple have welcomed three children together including Duncan, William and Robert.\n\nWhile Duncan and Robert have managed to stay out of the spotlight over the years, Paulâs oldest son William made headlines in 2015 after he was cited for a DUI, according to USA Today.\n\nRand Paul Net Worth: How much is Rand Paul worth?\n\nPaulâs most recent financial disclosures estimate he has a net worth of $1.5 million.\n\nRand Paul has worked as an ophthalmologist prior to his political career. He worked in the offices of other ophthalmologists for just over ten years before he opened his own practice.\n\nPaul has been a part of the U.S. Senate since 2011. His annual salary as a Senator is $174,000 per year. However, Rand is also a published author, and this is likely where the bulk of his wealth is derived.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jquYp5xdpa62uIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMoaawZZ2qsKl5yKxkq5memXqxrdSlZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D"
