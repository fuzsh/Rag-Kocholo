        "text": "This book is a quick read that covers the whole history of monetary destruction, providing information that most people have never heard or thought about. In that sense, it is the perfect conversation starter, and it could inspire more reading and activism for sound money.\n\nWe produced this beautiful edition for the broadest distribution — an effort to popularize and universalize the cause of sound money.\n\nAuthor Ron Paul has been the leading champion of sound money in the Congress. He explains why sound money has meant the gold standard. The monograph is written in the clearest possible terms with the goal of explaining the basics of paper money and its effects of inflation, business cycles, and government growth.\n\nHe maps out a plan to bring about a dollar that is as good as gold, one that would be protected against manipulation by government and central bankers. Part of that strategy is the minting of a new gold one but the more far-reaching plan involves a redefinition of the dollar and complete monetary competition. This monograph first appeared in 1981, and it has been in wide distribution ever since. But we’ve never had an edition this beautiful, this affordable, and this handy.\n\nThis Second Edition includes a Foreword by Henry Hazlitt and Preface by Murray Rothbard."
