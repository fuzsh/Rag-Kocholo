        "text": "Ron Paul, a former Portland political operative with dreams of opening of a downtown food market, has died.\n\nDetails of his death weren't immediately available. But Paul, 65, had been fighting cancer and was readmitted to a local hospital Friday with pneumonia.\n\nFor the past decade, Paul had been driving efforts to create the James Beard Public Market to showcase Portland's thriving food industry. A former restaurateur himself, Paul's shop on Northeast Broadway hosted President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in 1993.\n\nIn 1999, Paul went to work for then-Commissioner Charlie Hales as his chief of staff. Paul stayed with the city after Hales' resignation in 2002, taking a position promoting and planning for arts, culture and food policy until 2006.\n\nHales, now Portland's mayor, considered Paul a \"dear friend,\" spokeswoman Sara Hottman said. Hales left City Hall abruptly Monday after hearing of Paul's passing and may be out of the office the remainder of the week.\n\nPaul spent the past decade promoting his vision for a public market, which had yet to move forward despite fundraising efforts. City and county officials worked with Paul and Melvin Mark Development Company to build the market downtown, at the foot of the Morrison Bridge.\n\nRecognizing his health was failing, Paul this fall stepped down as executive director of the public market effort and was replaced by Fred Granum.\n\nRichard Harris, the market's board president, said Paul was one of \"the most generous, optimistic, persevering\" people he'd met.\n\n\"We'll go forward,\" Harris said of building the market. \"It gives us another reason to double up our efforts.\"\n\n-- Brad Schmidt\n\n503-294-7628\n\n@cityhallwatch"
