        "text": "WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 -- Ron Paul, M.D., a likable Texas ob-gyn aiming at the GOP nomination for president, has won startling support for a candidate who would discard most of the government he wants to run.\n\nDr. Paul, a long-time member of Congress, has Libertarian views that have not fundamentally changed a whit since he was first elected to Congress in 1976. He is a one-of-a-kind political gadfly who believes government is the main culprit for the nation's health care woes -- and for much of the rest of the domestic troubles the nation faces.\n\nHe'd like to phase out Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP, enact tort reform, and end the employment-based health insurance system. The National Institutes of Health? It just gets in the way of productive research. He'd retain the Department of Defense but not the CIA.\n\nIt might be tempting to ignore this \"fringe\" candidate who has never reached above the single digits in any poll of the early presidential primary states and who has little to no chance of winning the Republican presidential nomination -- at least according to the conventional wisdom.\n\nBut Dr. Paul's views have won a following. He has attracted far more campaign donations and support than many of his better known rivals. Indeed, on Nov. 5, Dr. Paul raised $4.2 million in 24 hours. The one-day total set a record for GOP candidates. Even before that, his campaign had more money on hand than Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.), Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), and Republican former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nDr. Paul is one of 12 physician members of Congress -- two in the Senate, 10 in the House of Representatives. If his campaign succeeds, he'd be America's first physician president.\n\nPhysician influence in politics has ebbed and waned over the years. Physicians comprised 10% of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. In recent years, cardiac surgeon Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) was Senate majority leader and an early dropout in the 2008 presidential campaign. Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, M.D., a flash-in-the pan wannabe nominee four years ago, is chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nWhat's more, long-shot candidacies often don't receive much coverage in the media, most of which focuses on the horserace -- who's ahead, who's behind -- than substantive issues. Yet long shots and third-party candidates have exerted powerful influence on the political debate, often seeing at least parts of their ideas enacted into law and policy.\n\nSo who is Ron Paul? Born in Pittsburgh, the 72-year-old has represented the Texas Gulf Coast in Congress, off and on, since 1976. Initially planning to follow two of his brothers into the ministry, he graduated from Duke medical school and specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. He claims to have delivered more than 4,000 babies over his medical career.\n\nDr. Paul is a libertarian purist, taking pride in his \"Dr. No\" votes against many popular programs. He also practices what he preaches. He's never accepted taxpayer-funded Medicare or Medicaid payments in his practice and refused to allow his children to accept federal student loans. He refuses a Congressional pension because he considers it an abuse of power. Paul was the Libertarian Party candidate for president in 1988, winning 431,750 votes nationwide. He's said he isn't interested in a third-party run for 2008.\n\nHealth care isn't the main reason Paul has sparked so much attention, though. He's the only GOP candidate to favor an immediate pullout of U.S. troops from Iraq and has enraged his rivals by suggesting that U.S. foreign policy has fueled terrorism and had contributed to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. His views on dismantling or abolishing government agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service, Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Reserve Board, Department of Education, and others, plus reinstituting the gold standard, are provocative to most but intriguing to some.\n\nHealth care positions\n\nDr. Paul's views on health care resonate with many physicians angered at declining Medicare reimbursements, and threats of more, and what they perceive as increasing meddling into their practices by government and insurers.\n\nHe blames most health care woes on government intervention, particularly the HMO Act of 1973 that required employers to offer their workers HMO coverage, and the tax code that allows business, but not individuals, to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums.\n\n\"The root of the problem with health care is that government polices encourage excessive reliance on third-party payers,\" he said. \"That removes all incentive from individual patients to concern themselves with health care costs. As long as somebody else is paying the bill, the bill will be too high.\"\n\nSimilar to the plan proposed by President Bush and endorsed by most other GOP candidates, Dr. Paul favors a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for every cent patients spend on health care premiums. All medical expenses would be tax deductible and Dr. Paul favors expansion of health savings accounts that individuals could use to pay for expenses.\n\nDr. Paul introduced a bill to provide a tax credit for patients to purchase \"negative outcomes\" insurance prior to surgery or other serious medical treatments. \"This novel approach guarantees that those harmed receive fair compensation, while reducing the burden of costly malpractice litigation.\"\n\nRecently, he also introduced the \"Treat Physicians Fairly Act,\" legislation providing tax credits to physicians and hospitals to pay for the costs of providing uncompensated care imposed on them by the federal government.\n\nHe opposes any legislation that increases the Food and Drug Administration's legal powers. \"The FDA has consistently failed to protect the public from dangerous drugs, genetically modified foods, dangerous pesticides, and other chemicals in the food supply. Meanwhile, they waste public funds attacking safe, healthy foods and dietary supplements.\"\n\nDr. Paul opposed the Homeland Security Bill, which authorizes the forced vaccination of American citizens against smallpox. \"The government should never have the power to require immunizations or vaccinations,\" he said."
