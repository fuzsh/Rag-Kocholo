        "text": "Ronald Paul Spalding, who graced this world for 92 robust years, passed away on August 23, 2023. He was a cherished father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather. His life journey alongside his high-school sweetheart and wife of nearly 67 years, Joyce (Moore) Spalding, was a testament to their enduring love and their desire to nurture strong family ties.\n\nRonald and Joyce raised five children, whose spouses and significant others they loved and embraced as their own. In later life, they relished the beauty of their empty-nest years and took the opportunity to go on rambling road trips to explore various regional destinations. Ronald’s heart beat in tandem with his bicycle pedals, as he embraced both the thrill and quietude of long-distance cycling. A member of the Central Indiana Bicycling Association (CIBA), he embarked on countless weekend group rides, conquered the challenging Hilly Hundred two-day bicycle trek each fall, and traversed the state of Iowa three times as part of the annual RAGBRAI tour.\n\nHe found joy in simple pleasures like black coffee, straight vodka, old country melodies, and the storytelling of National Public Radio. A lover of books, talk radio, and crossword puzzles, he had a smart and stealthy sense of humor.\n\nBorn in Indianapolis, his boyhood unfolded in Bloomington and Newbern, Indiana. Columbus High School witnessed his acapella harmonies in school choir as well as his prowess on the football field, which earned him the nickname of “The Singing Quarterback.” Ronald’s anecdotes of youthful escapades included peddling ice cream sandwiches to WPA workers on the streets of Bloomington and summers spent detassling corn. He attended Purdue University, where he pursued engineering, and he served in the National Guard. For more than 50 years, Ronald worked as a machine tool designer at Link Belt (later FMC and Rexnord). His affinity for those long bicycle rides eventually drew him to his cherished home in Brownsburg, Indiana, where the country roads beckoned.\n\nRonald’s legacy lives on through his surviving children, Richard Spalding, Susan DeHaven, and Julia Spalding. He has joined his beloved wife and two children, Robert Spalding and Anthony Spalding, in a heavenly embrace.\n\nAs we bid farewell to Ronald, his memory endures in the stories he told, often with a quiet chuckle. Leaving behind these cherished memories, his spirit finds eternal rest."
