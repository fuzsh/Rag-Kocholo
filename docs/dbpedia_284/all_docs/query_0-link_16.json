He arrived in Iran from Tbilisi, Georgia in the mid 1870s to set up shop in Ala al-Dawla street in Tehran. From the early days, Sevruguin's studio was trusted both by the Qajar court and by foreign visitors to Iran. Highly regarded for their artistic ingenuity outside Iran, Sevruguin's photographs of 'ethnic types,' architecture and landscape, and depictions of daily life of Tehran found their way into foreign travelogues, magazines and books. As such, he stands alone in a relatively large group of early Iranian photographers for being recognized and celebrated outside the boundaries of the country. Antoin Sevruguin passed away in 1933, leaving behind only a fraction of his large collection of glass negatives, which is currently in the Archives of the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery.\n\nExtent\n\n1 Glass negative (b&w, 17.8 cm. x 12.8 cm.)\n\nArchival Repository\n\nFreer Gallery of Art and Arthur M.

Smith handwritten document (Myron Bement Smith Collection, Subseries 2.1: Islamic Archives History, Collection Information; Box 60; Folder 44: 47 P Antoine Sevruguin, glass negatives, Iran), Antoin Sevruguin's 696 glass negatives, at the time of their acquisition, were arranged into 61 boxes without any apparent organization. Today they are housed in archival document boxes, essentially duplicating the original arrangement, and stored on shelves. This glass negative was included into \"Box 19.\"\n\nCollection Rights\n\nPermission to publish, quote, or reproduce must be secured from the repository.\n\nGenre/Form\n\nGlass negatives\n\nScope and Contents\n\n\"The image is most probably part of a series of photos from the port and its new constructions. The photos depict the official buildins of Bandar-I Anzali (also called Bandar-I Pahlavi) or Anzali port. One of the images in the series shows one of the buildings with a sing on top that reads: \"[...] Nazmiyya - Bandar-i Pahlavi\". the port of Anzali on the south edge of the Caspian sea and to the north of Tehran was renamed to Pahlavi in 1934. As such the photo mush have been taken after the death of Antione Sevruguin and by someone associated with his studio.\" [Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M.
