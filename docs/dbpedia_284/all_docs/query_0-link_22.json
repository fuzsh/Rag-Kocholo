The kingdom was taken over by the neighboring nation of Lusitania after King Andragoras III fell victim to a treacherous plot led by one of his most trusted retainers.[1]\n\nRoyalty[]\n\nMain article: Kings of Pars\n\nIn Pars Era 320\n\nKing: Andragoras III\n\nQueen: Tahamine\n\nPrince: Arslan\n\nGeography[]\n\nEcbatana[]\n\nMain article: Ecbatana\n\nThe royal city Ecbatana is at the center of the continental roads.[2] Goods came from the roads to the east and west. Much of Ecbatana's population are slaves, who outnumbered both Nobles and Priest.\n\nGilan[]\n\nMain article: Gilan\n\nGilan is a port town in the southern part of Pars[3].\n\nPeshawar[]\n\nMain article: Peshawar\n\nPeshawar Fortress is the most stalwart fortress guarding Pars's eastern border against Sindhura. The fortress is mostly surrounded by mountains that make it unassailable.\n\nZabul[]\n\nMain article: Zabul\n\nZabul Fortress is a fortress west of the Royal Capital of Ecbatana, near the border with Maryam.\n\nKashan[]\n\nMain article: Kashan\n\nKashan Fortress is a fortress located in the fictional kingdom of Pars. Its ruler was Lord Hodir but he has been killed by Daryun.\n\nHistory[]\n\nReign of Jamshid[]\n\nIn ancient time, Pars was ruled by Sage King Jamshid, Jahangir. However, he was slain by the Serpent King Zahhāk.\n\nRule of Zahhāk[]\n\nZahhāk’s rule over Pars had covered the land with terror. Every day, he would kill two men to gain their brain and fed the serpents that protruded from his shoulders. This lasted for a millenium.\n\nNo one had dared to rebel against Serpent King until Kaykhusraw stood against him. First, he drew a cook who serves Zahhāk to his side. Then he began to save one of the men to be sacrificed and substituted his brain with that of sheep each day. This way, he gained his allies. A year later, the number of soldiers on his side grew to 365. With them, he attacked Zahhāk and succeeded in sealing him deep under Mount Damavand; Kaykhusraw bounded him with chains and sealed him with 20 bedrocks. Thus, Serpent King was defeated, leaving the word that he would break the seal in 300 years.\n\nReign of Kaykhusraw[]\n\nKaykhusraw became the first King of Pars at the age of 18, and unified Pars at the age of 25. Though he was wise and upright, his son betrayed him, and his life wasn’t very prosperous. When he was 45, he passed away and as he wished, he was buried in Mount Damavand with his sword, Rukhnabad.\n\nSince then, descendants of Kaykhusraw have ruled Pars for about 300 years, until Lusitania invades the land in the reign of Andragoras III.\n\nCulture[]\n\nThe literacy rate is quite high. Even bandits like Zott can read (However, they learn how to read only because they need to understand wanted posters).\n\nParsians think it disgusting to eat lamb brain as there is no habit of eating it in the country. It is because Kaykhusraw banned it to respect the soul of sheep which was sacrificed in defeating Zahhāk.\n\nSocial Class[]\n\nWāspuhrān (wāsupuhurān) = royalty (Arslan, Hilmes etc.)\n\nWuzurgan (wazurugān) = nobles\n\nShahrdārān (shahurudārān) = nobles who possess land and private army (Narsus (former), Lucian, Zarāvant, etc.)\n\nĀzātān = knight (Daryun, Kishward, Kubard, Esfan, etc.)\n\nĀzāt (āzāto)= common citizen (Elam etc.)\n\nGhulām (gorāmu) = slave (Elam (former) etc.)\n\n*presumable spelling (Romanized Japanese) = meaning\n\nGovernment[]\n\nShah = King (Andragoras III, etc.)\n\nMilitary[]\n\nEran (Vahriz, etc.)\n\nMarzban = commander of 10000 cavalry (Daryun, Kishward, Kubard, etc.)\n\nCommander of 1000 cavalry\n\nCommander of 100 cavalry\n\nCavalry (knights)\n\nFoot soldiers (citizens and slaves)\n\nCivil Official[]\n\nFramatar = Prime Minister (Husrab, etc.)\n\nFramartal = Deputy of the Prime Minister\n\nDibir = Secretary (Narsus (former), Pelagius (former), etc.)\n\nIn Emergency[]\n\nPrince = Deputy of King\n\nSatruyp = Deputy of Prime Minister (Narsus (former), Lucian)\n\nFossāto = Person in charge of military affairs and tactics (Narsus)\n\nUnit[]\n\nLength[]\n\nFarsang = 5km\n\nAmaj = 250m\n\nGaz = 1m\n\nCurrency[]\n\nDēnār = gold coin\n\nDrahm = silver coin\n\nMisukāru = copper coin\n\nInspiration[]\n\nPars, whose name is exactly the same as the native name for Persia proper (Pārs) is based off the Persian Empire, and the pre-Islamic native Iranian dynasties in particular. A capital at Ecbatana, an army with, reputedly, the greatest cavalry in the world, and a markedly different religious tradition to the staunchly monotheistic and dogmatic Lusitanians, are aspects common the Achaemenian dynasty (550-330 BCE); and even more markedly so in the case of the Arsacid (247 BCE – 224 CE) and Sasanian (224-651 CE) dynasties of the Persian Empire. The soldiers' equipment is mainly based off Achaemenid forces such as the famed Persian Immortals, the heavy cavalry is more akin in both function and reputation to Arsacid/Sasanian Asvārān, the architecture is medieval Persian, the King's crown is Achaemenid in style, the Parsian battle standard takes much from the design of Sasanian coins, The title of Marzban, as well as most of the Parsian names, most commonly mirror Middle Persian names from both the Arsacid and Sasanian periods, mentions of Mithra, condemnation as \"pagans\" by the Lusitanians, reflect the invading Muslim forces since the mid 7th century CE; and numerous other examples.\n\nEcbatana is probably based off several royal capitals, though most notably by name and terrain, based off the real city of the same name: Ecbatana (near modern Hamadān, in Western Iran), a large city in the hilly and fertile land of Media, was the capital of the Mede Empire from the late 8th century BCE, and after Persian Emperor, Cyrus the Great, defeated the Medes and took the city in 549 BCE, it became the summer capital and one of the main cities of his Achaemenid Empire, and of several Iranian Empires for centuries to come.\n\nKashan is a city in the province of Isfahan, Iran.\n\nNotes"
