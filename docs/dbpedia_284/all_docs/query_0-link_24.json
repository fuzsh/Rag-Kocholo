This ancient site holds deep spiritual significance for adherents of one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions, drawing visitors from far and wide to pay homage to its sacred flame and explore its mystical surroundings. A Sacred Sanctuary: Chak Chak, meaning \"drip-drip\" in Persian, derives its name from a legendary tale of Princess Nikbanou, who sought refuge in these mountains during a time of persecution. According to legend, as she fled, pursued by enemies, she prayed to Ahura Mazda, the supreme deity of Zoroastrianism, for protection. In response to her prayers, a spring miraculously gushed forth from the rocks, providing her with water and sanctuary. The droplets of water that continue to drip from the mountain are believed to symbolize tears shed by the mountain in remembrance of this event.

Iran now has 27 UNESCO-listed historical sites, including 54 Iranian Caravanserais located all over the country. Iran belongs on the list of the top 10 countries which have the most world heritage sites. Persian Caravanserai history The earliest caravanserais in Iran were built during the Achaemenid era (550 - 330 BC). Centuries later, when Shah Abbas I assumed power from 1588 to 1629, he ordered the construction of a network of caravanserais across the country. Such roadside inns were once constructed along ancient caravan routes in the Muslim world to shelter people, their goods, and animals. The former Silk Road may well have the most famous examples of caravanserais dotted along the route. Persian Caravanserai usages The Persian Caravanserai, where a lot of historical monuments were discovered in Iran, represent the way of travelling in desert regions before modern roads and railways existed. Caravanserais were roadside inns, providing shelter, food and water for caravans, pilgrims and other travellers. The routes and the locations of the caravanserais were determined by the presence of water, geographical conditions and security concerns. Connection of Caravanserai with the Silk Road The Caravanserai were built as road stations along trade routes, (such as the Silk Road), and pilgrimage routes. Their design evolved over the centuries, from the Sassanian to the Qajar period, which also varied due to the geographic setting. Meaning of the caravanserai and the architecture Caravanserai or caravansary is a compound word combining “caravan” with “sara”; CARAVAN stands for a group of travellers and SARA means the building and place to rest.
