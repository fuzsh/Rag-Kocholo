        "text": "Bandar Anzali stands as one of the picturesque cities in Gilan Province, situated in the northern part of Iran. Approximately 40 kilometers from Rasht, the provincial capital, Anzali ranks as the second-largest and most populous city in Gilan. Recognized as a critical hub for tourism, economy, industry, and sports within Iran, Anzali offers a variety of attractions, including the famous Anzali Lagoon and the Sorkhankal Wildlife area.\n\nContents\n\nAnzali Lagoon\n\nAnzali Lagoon, known locally as Anzali Mordab, is one of Iran’s most beautiful and valuable freshwater lagoons. Dating back around 15,000 years, the lagoon showcases a breathtaking scene of water lilies, reeds, and sea lotuses. Visitors can enjoy activities such as boating and fishing, and delight in the sight of diverse bird species. Designated as a Ramsar site in 1975, Anzali Lagoon is unparalleled in its high humidity levels, unique geographical position, and biodiversity, housing over 100 bird species and 150 aquatic species.\n\nSorkhankal Wildlife\n\nPositioned in the middle of Anzali Lagoon, the Sorkhankal area serves as a prime viewing spot. Home to numerous migratory birds such as swans, geese, and ducks, it also boasts native and migratory fishes, enhancing its ecological value.\n\nAnzali Coastal Boulevard\n\nConstructed by order of Reza Shah in 1928, the Anzali Coastal Boulevard features European-style architecture. Spanning approximately 35,000 square meters, the northern part includes Anzali’s breakwaters, while the southern part offers recreational facilities like cafés and tea houses.\n\nVisiting Bandar Anzali\n\nVisiting Anzali is pleasant throughout the year. However, for beach lovers, the summer provides ideal conditions for swimming, though humidity might be slightly high. Spring and autumn promise more delightful weather.\n\nHafezieh of Anzali\n\nHafezieh in Bandar Anzali, not to be confused with Shiraz’s Hafezieh, is a cultural symbol of Anzali. Previously a venue for local musicians, it now serves primarily as a tourist attraction.\n\nBridges of Anzali\n\nThe Ghazian Bridge and Anzali Bridge, constructed in 1935, are among the city’s oldest structures. These bridges are engineered to avoid any ecological impact on the area and include movable sections to accommodate passing ships.\n\nAnzali Military Museum Palace\n\nLocated between the Ghazian and Anzali bridges, Anzali’s Military Museum Palace was established during the Qajar era and later renovated in the Pahlavi period. This two-story building houses an impressive collection of weapons and naval equipment and features extraordinary plasterwork.\n\nAnzali Clock Tower\n\nBuilt in 1915, Anzali’s Clock Tower initially served as a lighthouse and later as a lookout point during conflicts. Standing at 28 meters tall, the tower offers a panoramic view of the city from its 20-meter high balcony.\n\nAnzali Breakwaters\n\nConstructed in 1895, the Anzali Breakwaters were designed to protect against the fierce waves of the Caspian Sea. Today, they serve as a scenic spot for visitors and a testament to 19th-century engineering.\n\nMirza Koochak Khan Tourist Ship\n\nIn 1971, the Mirza Koochak Khan tourist ship arrived in Anzali from Japan, providing premier tourism services. This five-deck ship accommodates up to 250 passengers and offers cabins with varied amenities.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAnnually, thousands of tourists and travelers explore the scenic and recreational sites of Bandar Anzali. Notable attractions include the Anzali Lagoon, Sorkhankal Wildlife, Anzali Coastal Boulevard, Hafezieh, Anzali Bridges, Military Museum Palace, Clock Tower, and the tourist ship. Plan your trip to Anzali and book your accommodations at the best prices through OrientTrips for a memorable journey."
