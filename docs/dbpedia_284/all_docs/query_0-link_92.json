        "text": "The SW part of south Caspian offshore studied very poorly. Data studied from numerous offshore shallow engineering and deep exploration wells have provided useful information on the geology of the Tertiary- Quaternary sediments. The log, seismic data, and biostratigraphy confirmed that the Tertiary sediments consist of fluvial- deltaic–lacustrine sediments deposited in the isolated South Caspian Basin, particularly in the study area by several river systems. A Quarternary period is characterized by brackish water sediments. The \"short\" series of marine sediments of the deep and shallow facies of open sea bays, delta, and marine shallow waters are typical for the SW part of the Caspian. Pliocene and Quaternary sediments unconformably overlie more ancient formations, until the Mesozoic sediments are located at a relatively shallow depth. In the Lankaran-Talysh Deniz, the Miocene sequences below the middle part of Pliocene Pereryva formation are pinching out against the basin margin. The thickness of these series increases stepwise across the main structures giving evidence of a rift-system developing at the beginning of major subsidence in the South Caspian during the early Tertiary. No hydrocarbon discovery except little oil and gas shows are found in SW of the Caspian due to several geological reasons such as a reservoir, vertical and lateral migration problem.\n\nAs the world&#39;s largest closed body of water, considerable changes in the Caspian Sea water level make it an unique laboratory to study all aspects of coastal zones. This research was aimed at evaluating the linkage between sea level changes and sediment characteristics of the south Caspian Sea coast. Initially, three field surveys were made along 700 km of the southern Caspian Sea coast. In addition to nearshore sampling, land forms were mapped. On the basis of the field reconnaissance, eight principal sampling stations were chosen. Sediments were sampled by divers along profiles at right angles to the coast at 5 depths (2, 4, 6, 8,10 meters). Hydrographic profiles also were surveyed. Laboratory tests on the sediment samples were made, and the sediment characteristics and morphological features were divided into distinct zones based on their response to sea level changes.\n\nCaspian Sea level has undergone significant changes through time with major impacts not only on the surrounding coasts but also on offshore. This study reports a brackish water invasion on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea constructed from a multi-proxy analysis of sediment retrieved from the Langarud wetland. The ground surface level of wetland is &gt;6 m higher than the current Caspian Sea level (at −27.41 m in 2014) and located &gt;11 km far from the coast. A sequence covering the last millennium was dated by three radiocarbon dates. The results from this new study suggest that Caspian Sea level rose up to at least −21.44 m (i.e. &gt;6 m above the present water level) during the early ‘Little Ice Age’. Although previous studies in the southern coast of the Caspian Sea have detected a high-stand during the Little Ice Age period, this study presents the first evidence that this high-stand reached so far inland and at such a high altitude. Moreover, it confirms one of the very f..."
