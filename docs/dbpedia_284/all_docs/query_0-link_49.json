The village is 1,050 meters above sea level in the Alborz (or Elburz) mountain range, near the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The village itself has a difference in elevation of 100 meters.\n\nFog is the predominate weather feature of Masouleh.\n\nMasouleh architecture is unique. The buildings have been built into the mountain and are interconnected. Courtyards and roofs both serve as pedestrian areas similar to streets. Masouleh does not allow any motor vehicles to enter, due to its unique layout. It is the only village in Iran with such a prohibition. However, the small streets and many stairs simply also wouldn't make it possible for vehicles to enter.\n\nYellow clay coats the exterior of most buildings in Masouleh. This allows for better visibility in the fog.\n\nLocal woman in traditional dress\n\nShapoor Discussion starter\n\n2721 posts ·\n\n#24 ·\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nRudkhan castle (also Rood-khan castle), is a brick and stone medieval castle in Iran.\n\nLocated 25 km southwest of Foman city north of Iran in Gilan province, it is a military complex which had been constructed during the Seljuk Dynasty by the followers of Ismā'īlī sect. The Castle is built on two tips of a mount, with an area of 50,000 square metres. Its architects have benefited from natural mountainous features in the construction of the fort.\n\nA river known as `Rudkhan Castle River' also exists near the castle, which originates from the surrounding heights and flows from south to north. After crossing a mountainous winding route with dense forests, the first thing that one notices about the castle is its big entrance gate.\n\nRudkhan Castle sits at the two peaks of a mountain at elevations of 715 and 670 meters and contains strong fortifications and battlements at a length of 1,550 meters. The castle's 42 towers still stand intact.\n\nAll pictures from flickr\n\n325940 posts ·\n\n#25 ·\n\nRudkhan castle looks very nice @Shapoor actually the terrain around the castle is just great\n\n861 posts ·\n\n#26 ·\n\nI missed that Rudkhan Castle. Did they unearth that place recently?"
