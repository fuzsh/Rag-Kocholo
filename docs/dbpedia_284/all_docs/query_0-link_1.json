        "text": "In this study, temperature changes and its concentration distribution in the period of 1984-2015 and 2015-2100 were investigated under CanESM5 climate model and SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. By confirming the correlation (more than 0.96) and the efficiency coefficient of the model (more than 0.82), the trend of temperature values using modified Mann-Kendall test and temperature concentration index (TCI) values in the sub-basins of Zayanderood Dam, Iran was estimated. The results indicated a non-significant upward trend in the base period (1984-2015) and a significant increasing trend at the level of 5% in the future period (2015-2100) produced by the mentioned scenarios. According to the slope of the trend line, an increase of 1.45, 4 and 9.8 degrees Celsius is predicted during the period of 2015-2100 according to the SSP126, SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. The evaluation of changes in TCI values in the studied area showed that in the future period, the distribution of rainfall patterns will be regular and the uniformity of temperature distribution in the SSP585 scenario is more than in the other two scenarios. The results of the temperature pattern distribution in the study area showed that according to the upcoming climate changes and under the studied scenarios, it is expected that while the study area is warming in the future, the uniformity of the temperature distribution will also appear in the months of the year. This shows the reduction of temperature fluctuations and the uniformity of the average temperature in the months of the year. The reduction of TCI values shows the equalization of average temperature changes in the seasons. The results of the investigations showed that the combination of climate change scenarios with the TCI can well show the concentration and distribution of the temperature in different periods.\n\nUnderstanding how precipitation fluctuates geographically and temporally over a specific place due to climate change is critical. Generally, simulations of general circulation models (GCM) under different scenarios are downscaled to the local scale to study the impact of climate change on precipitation. However, selecting suitable GCMs for the given study area is one of the most hectic tasks, as the performance of GCMs may vary with respect to space and timescale. Therefore, the current study ranks twenty-seven CMIP 6 (Coupled Modelled Intercomparison Project Phase 6) GCMs in simulating precipitation over India for nine times series, including daily, monthly, yearly, and six extreme series extracted with annual maximum and peak over threshold methods. The gridded daily rainfall data provided by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) are used as the observed data. The GCMs' outputs are corrected for the systematic bias using the linear scaling method. The performance of a GCM is assessed with three statistical performance metrics, namely NSE, RMSE, and R2. The GCMs' ranks are determined using a multi-criterion decision-making technique named the modified technique of order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (mTOPSIS) for every grid point and nine timescales (i.e., daily, monthly, yearly, and six extreme series). From the results, for the entire India, the top ten recommended CMIP 6 GCMs are FGOALS-g3, HadGEM3-GC31-MM, EC-Earth3, BCC-CSM2-MR, CNRM-CM6-1-HR, CanESM5, AWI-ESM-1-1-LR, MPI-ESM-1-2-HR, IITM-ESM, and INM-CM5-0. The identified best-performing models provide insightful information for better regional climate projections and underscore the necessity of considering multiple model outputs for reliable climate change impact assessments and adaptation strategies in the region."
