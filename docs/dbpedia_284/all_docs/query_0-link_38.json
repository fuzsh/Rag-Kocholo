        "meta_description": "Rudkhan Castle (Gilaki: رودخان دژ‎; also Rood-khan Castle) is a brick and stone medieval fortress in Iran that was built by the Gilaks to defend against the Arab invaders during the Arab/Islamic invasion of Sassanian Iran. With the fall of the Sassanid Empire, this area became a defensive position against the Arabs in the then-newly established Tabarestan.\r\n\r\nLocated 25 km southwest of Fuman city north of Iran in Gilan province, it is a military complex which had been constructed during the Sasanian era (224-651), and later rebuilt during the Seljuq era by the Nizari Ismailis. The castle is built on two tips of a mount, with an area of 2.6 hectares (6.4 acres). Its architects have benefited from natural mountainous features in the construction of the fort.\r\n\r\nThe Rudkhan Castle River originates in the surrounding heights and flows from south to north.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing a mountainous winding route with dense forests, the first thing that one notices about the castle is its big entrance gate.\r\n\r\nRudkhan Castle sits at the two peaks of a mountain at elevations of 715 and 670 metres and contains strong fortifications and battlements at a length of 1,550 metres. The castle's 42 towers still stand intact.( wikipedia )",
