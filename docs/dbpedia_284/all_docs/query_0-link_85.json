        "text": "Sometime between the mythical age — the creation of the world, the first man (and King) Keyumars and the discovery of fire — and the historical age, — after the conquest of Alexander the Great (Eskandar) — we had the Age of the Heroes.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI'm not a historian, or a good writer and this is my first time writing a recipe.\n\nYes, there is a recipe if you scroll down a bit.\n\nOne of these heroes, Esfandiyār, was Crowned Prince and a Divine Warrior of ancient Aryānā (Iran — or Persia to the Greeks). He supported Zarathustra, enabling him to spread the prophets message in the land. In return, he was given armour and a chain from Heaven, this gave him the power to blind any demon making them unable to escape.\n\n(Hey, here’s a non-2001: Space Odyssey related moment to link to “Thus Spoke Zarathustra”, consider it a backing track to this blogpost)\n\nEsfandiyar to him: “Thou luckless one!\n\nI will advance thee to the crown and throne,\n\nWill give thee all the kingdom of the Turkmans,\n\nAnd will exalt thee to the shining sun,\n\nAs soon as I return victorious,\n\nIf thou wilt tell me truly what I ask,\n\nNor will I harm thy children, kith or kin;\n\nBut if thou go about to utter lies\n\nIn any way they will not pass with me,\n\nMy sword shall cleave thee, and the hearts of all\n\nShall tremble at thy fate.”\n\nGurgsar replied:-\n\n“O famous, glorious Esfandiyar!\n\nThat’s according to the long epic poem, Shahnameh, or Book of Kings. It’s what you would get if you put the Iliad and all of Shakespeare’s work into a blender. I've even heard it described as like Game of Thrones but with some of the stories actually being true. A monument of poetry and historiography, its 50,000 couplets tell a more or less connected story, in metrical and rhymed verse, of the Iranian empire, from the creation of the world down to the conquest of the Muslim Arabs. The Book of Kings is considered by experts as one of the main reasons the Persian language and cultural identity resisted the Arabisation that swept much of the rest of the Middle East.\n\nSo why is this relevant? Well, in one verse, Esfandiyār is said to have gained invincibility after eating pomegranates or pomegranate juice. Since this is one of the main ingredients in the ancient dish Fesenjoon, I kinda wanted to add some contextual epic-ness to the dish. To add to that, in the Greco-Persian Wars, Herodotus mentions golden pomegranates adorning the spears of the warriors in the phalanx. And we all know Herodotus never exaggerated and that he is the authoritative, unbiased source of the era, right? *wink*\n\nAnother reason why this is timely is that December 21st was the ancient Zoroastrian festival of Yalda.\n\nIt’s celebrated on the longest and darkest night of the year, i.e. the Northern Hemisphere’s winter solstice.\n\n(Most Iranian/Zoroastrian holidays are astronomical, for example the New Year or Nowruz is on the exact moment of the Vernal Equinox).\n\nYalda is a time for friends and families to get together to eat, drink, tell stories and jokes, smoke “Ghelyoon” and read poetry until well after midnight, but also red fruits are eaten especially pomegranates and watermelon.\n\nAnyway, time get back to the reason you probably even clicked on this link in the first place. Traditionally, Fesenjoon (or in formal Persian Fesenjan) is made with duck since it’s supposedly originally from Gilan province in the north of Iran, or just generally the area surrounding the Caspian Sea (also known for Caviar, oil, geo-politics since Russia lives on the other side and for being near my mum’s hometown).\n\nHowever, nowadays, it’s mostly made with chicken since that’s obviously more readily available, easier to prepare, cheaper etc. That could be chopped up breast and/or thigh fillets or you can just throw a whole chicken into the pot. I've had it both ways.\n\nAlso commonly made with meatballs and, apparently, even with lamb in some villages. Alternatively, for vegetarians, no meat at all since it’s pretty rich and filling by itself.\n\nHowever, since it’s Christmas and I’ve had it with Turkey a few times before and it turns out pretty well, for this occasion I made it with Turkey. Also, Woolies had this pre-prepared whole boneless Turkey and that made the meat preparation step incredibly easy (otherwise, I just would have gone with chicken, to be honest).\n\n19. Now you basically just have to let it sit and simmer for a while. However, you need to keep an eye on it and control the amount of water in it since it’s going to thicken. If it gets too dry and thick it could burn. A general guide is you want to start off a bit more watery than how you want it to turn out at the end, keeping in mind that it’s going to simmer for another hour or two. Give it a good stir every now and then."
