        "text": "Founded in 1974, as a partnership between Iran and West Germany, the University of Guilan began by offering engineering and literature courses. It is now the largest university in Northern Iran, with nine faculties and three research centres.\n\nOffering bachelors, masters and PhD degrees, faculties include science, engineering, agriculture, humanities, physical education, natural resources and art and architecture.\n\nSpread over four campuses with a total area of more than 2.5km² , the university accommodation can host almost 60 per cent of students and staff. There is also a range of facilities available on campus: restaurants, a medical clinic, a bank, shopping centre and sports centre, which includes a swimming pool.\n\nIt also has a department in Caspian Sea studies, due to its 30km distance from the Caspian Sea, the largest landlocked body of water in the world. Twice a year, it publishes the Caspian Journal of Environmental Sciences, an official publication of AUCRS (Association of Universities of Caspian Region States).\n\nRasht, the city in which the university is situated (and the capital of the Guilan province) is known as the “City of Rain” in Iran. Large swathes of the Guilan province are mountainous and forested, but there is also rice paddies, silk plains, mountain ranges and of course, Caspian Sea. The province’s coasts are idyllic and offer the ideal opportunity for students to swim, boat and play water sports."
