        "text": "The Caspian Sea, the world’s largest inland body of water, the largest landlocked watershed, is one of the wonders of the Middle East. This self-sufficient lake has no access to open waters and is just connected to the Black Sea via a man-made canal. It lies to the east of the Caucasus Mountains and to the west of the vast steppe of Central Asia. The sea’s name derives from the ancient Kaspi peoples, who once lived in Transcaucasia to the west.\n\nAll about the Caspian Sea\n\nThe Caspian Sea is located in northern Iran and is bounded on the north by Russia, on the west by Russia and the Republic of Azerbaijan, on the east by the Republic of Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. Locally called Khazar in Iran, Caspian is confined to land and is not directly connected to any of the world’s open waters. In recent years, the Caspian Sea has been connected to the Black Sea via the Volga-Don Canal.\n\nThe Caspian Sea covers an area of 600,384 square Km (one-fourth of Iran’s area) and its length is about 1280 Km. The largest lake in the world is 202 to 554 km wide and its widest area is located near the southern coast. The deepest point of the Caspian Sea is 980 meters deep and its water volume is 790 thousand cubic Km.\n\nFishery in the Caspian Sea\n\nThe Caspian Sea has 740 km of coastline in Iran and 1894 km in Azerbaijan, 815 Km in Russia, 800 Km in Kazakhstan and 1789 Km in Turkmenistan. Undoubtedly, the Caspian Sea plays a very important role in the region and the arid climate of Iran and serves as a very important platform for energy transfer. Annually, 600,000 metric tons of fish is harvested from the Caspian Sea, which plays a significant role in the region’s financial turnover and economy.\n\nThe Caspian Caviar\n\nThe Caspian long has been famous for its sturgeon, a fish prized for its caviar, and the sea accounts for the great bulk of the world catch. If you know anything about caviar, you’ve probably heard the name of the Caspian Sea. The finest Caspian Caviar is Beluga . Beluga caviar comes from the Beluga sturgeon (hence the name) and most of these fish live in the Caspian Sea. In fact, the Caspian Sea provides 90 percent of all world’s caviar. Beluga sturgeon are the third most massive living species of bony fish in the world and the biggest freshwater fish. They can live for 120 years and weigh over 1,000 pounds. These are huge fish.\n\nBeluga caviar is caviar consisting of the roe of the beluga sturgeon Huso huso. The fish can be found primarily in the Caspian Sea and also in the Black Sea basin and occasionally in the Adriatic Sea. The Caspian Sea is about a third less salty than regular seas, and this level of salinity seems to suit the beluga sturgeon. Unfortunately, over-fishing and poaching has endangered beluga endangered Beluga sturgeon which helps explain the high price of the caviar. Beluga caviar is the most expensive type of caviar with market prices ranging from $7,000 to $10,000 per Kg.\n\nNames of the Caspian Sea\n\nIn 1982, the Iranian government announced the name of Mazandaran Sea as an official name, but in the government circular of 2002, the official name of the North Iran Sea was announced in the Persian correspondences as Khazar Sea and still Caspian Sea in international correspondences. However, the official and international name of the North Sea of Iran in all languages is still the Caspian Sea and its equivalents. As is the case with many other geographical features of the world, different names have been used for this sea at different historical periods but the “Hyrcanian Sea” and the “Caspian Sea” have been more significant historically.\n\nRivers of the Caspian region\n\nWith their combined annual flow, Volga, Ural, and Terek, The major rivers that empty into the northern Caspian, account for about 88 percent of all river water entering the sea. The Sulak, Samur, Kura, and a number of smaller rivers flow in on the western shore of the middle and southern Caspian, contributing about 7 percent of the total flow into the sea. The remainder comes in from the rivers of the southern, Iranian shore such as Atrak (Atrek), Aras, Sefid rood, Haraz Rivers. The sea’s arid eastern shore is notable for a complete lack of permanent streams.\n\nClimate of the Caspian Sea\n\nThe northern Caspian enjoys a moderately continental climate zone, while the middle and south part of the sea, with Iran, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan is mountainous and much warmer. The southwest is touched by subtropical influences, and that remarkable variety is completed by the desert climate prevailing on the eastern shore. The most precipitation is in the eastern parts, primarily in the southeast. The average rainfall on most shores of the Caspian Sea is about 300 mm per year and only in the coasts of Iran and parts of southern Azerbaijan has an exceptionally humid climate with rainfall of about 700 to 1700 mm.\n\nCaspian Sea Oil industry history\n\nThe first documented report on Caspian hydrocarbon resources dates back to the thirteenth century. Oil was officially extracted from Caspian region lands in 1869 and from Baku water in 1949, and so far 21,000 wells have been drilled in exploration areas (land and sea). Apart from the North Caspian and Central Caspian oil fields, the southern part of Caspian Sea is also one of the main sources of exploration and production of oil and gas.\n\nDevelopment and exploitation of oil and gas fields in the Caspian Sea dates back to 1949, and according to the official sources of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the oil industry of this country extracted oil and gas at this sea for the first time in the world, of course Azerbaijan was a part of USSR at that time.\n\nDevelopment and exploitation of oil and gas fields in the Caspian Sea dates back to 1949, and according to the official sources of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijanian oil industry started to extract oil and gas at Caspian Sea for the first time in the world. In 1949, with the discovery of the largest energy field “Neft Dashlari” located 90 km east of Baku in the Caspian Sea, the foundation was laid for the development and exploitation of the oil and gas resources of this region. Following this action, the development and operation of other fields such as “Gorgan Deniz”, “Pirollahi” and “Jilvo Adasi” began in the Caspian Sea and some other actions were also taken in order to create the necessary infrastructure for the development of other energy sources in the sea.\n\nOnly in the 1980s, the Republic of Azerbaijan, using relatively advanced drilling equipment, including floating platforms, succeeded in conducting geological explorations at a depth of 200 to 350 meters, as a result of which several energy fields with significant oil reserves, including” “Azari”, “Cheragh” and “Gunshli” were discovered and these fields are currently being developed in cooperation with transnational oil companies.\n\nAccording to 2013 statistics, the Republic of Azerbaijan extracts 873,260 barrels of oil per day from the Caspian Sea, while Iran’s extraction from this huge and valuable resource is zero.\n\nCaspian Sea Legal Status\n\nNearly three decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the discovery of three new littoral states for the Caspian, the Convention on the New Legal Status of the Caspian Sea was finally signed by the presidents of Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The signed text is a result of 26 years of negotiations on the legal status of the Caspian Sea, which is the basis of subsequent decisions and can be referred to as the Constitution of the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe new Caspian Sea Legal Status Convention has not entered into any delimitation of water borders and boundaries, and has left this issue to bilateral dialogue between countries. All Caspian states have defined their national parts and share of Caspian waters by bilateral agreements. Iran has always rejected this method and has not yet finalized its maritime border with its two neighbors in the Caspian Sea, the Republic of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan.\n\nCaspian Sea Map\n\nMap is showing the Caspian Sea, an inland sea at the crossroads of Europe and Asia that is situated about 500 km east of the Black Sea, between southeastern Europe and Western Asia, east of the Caucasus Mountains, south of the vast Eurasian Steppe, and west of the Karakum and Kyzylkum Deserts of Central Asia. Five countries have a shoreline at the sea, Iran and four former Soviet republics (until 1991), Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan.\n\n20 Facts about the Caspian Sea\n\n1In the past, the Caspian Sea was part of the Tethys Sea that connected the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. From 60 million years ago, the connection between the Caspian Sea and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans gradually disappeared. 2Caspian is a term used in Western and Hebrew to name the North Sea of Iran. The Caspis were a white skinned tribe that lived from the second millennium BCE to the Sassanid era in the Caspian Sea region. 3The missing book “Khotai Namag” is the oldest written source in which the name of the Caspian Sea is mentioned for the first time. In this source, the name “Sea of Gilan” has been used to name this sea. 4Some written sources state that the “Khazar” tribes were an ethnic group that repeatedly intended to invade Iran’s borders, but the Sassanid kings cut off their hand. Some believe that the choice of the name Khazar for the North Sea of Iran is wrong, and in fact the Khazar Tribes intended to usurp this land. 5The Caspian Sea is home to more than 400 species of fish most of which are unique and can not be found anywhere in the world except the Caspian Sea. 6The Caspian Sea has seals.\n\nCaspian Seal\n\nA skilled aquatic and swimming animal with a length of about 1.5 meters and a weight of about 80 kg is one of the smallest species of seals. With 10 pairs of teeth in the upper jaw and 8 pairs of teeth in the lower jaw, this animal lives on Kilka fish goby fish. In warm seasons such as spring, summer and even autumn, Caspian seals can be seen in the south shores of the Caspian Sea, including Iran. But in the last months of autumn and in order to give birth to their offspring, they migrate towards the northeast, which freezing shallow water in winter.\n\n7Today, the Caspian seal is under threat. Hunting, pollution, coastal development, and winter icebreakers all contribute to its decline. 8More than 90% of sturgeon fishing takes place in the Caspian Sea and most of it is harvested in Iran. 9There is no shark in the waters of the Caspian Sea, the water of this sea is ranked among the semi-saline waters and sharks live only in saline waters. 10After the Persian Gulf and Siberia, the Caspian Sea ranks third in terms of oil and gas reserves on the coast and under the bed. 11The Caspian Sea is below sea level.The altitude of the Caspian Sea is 26 to 28 meters below the sea level. 12About 130 rivers flow into this sea, most of which join the Caspian Sea from the northwest. The largest of these rivers is the Volga River 13Caspian coastline of Iran is the most touristic area of Iran. 14About 4% of the world’s oil and gas reserves exist in the Caspian Sea. 15In 1994, Azerbaijan signed an agreement with Russian companies, Norway, Britain, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United States to extract Caspian oil. In November 1994, they asked Iran to join the agreement, but the United States rescinded the agreement on the pretext that they could not have any common business with Iran. 16The Caspian Sea is a huge source of hydrocarbon fuels, most of which are in the Republic of Azerbaijan. 17 Annually, 122,000 tons of pollution from oil extraction enters Caspian waters. 18From 6380 km of Caspian coast, about 922 km from Astara to Atrak river belongs to Iran. 19The Caspian Sea is very important in terms of fishing and its sturgeon is world famous. About 300 tons of caviar are caught annually from these fish. About 90% of the world’s caviar is obtained from this sea. 20According to the Treaty of Turkmenchay, the right to have a navy in the Caspian Sea was taken away from the Iranians, but again in the Treaty of Friendship between Iran and Russia in 1921, this right was equated between Iran and the former Soviet Union.\n\nCaspian attractions in Iran\n\nThe coastal area of the Caspian Sea is not limited to the sea and some famous forests such as Sisangan.
