        "meta_description": "In the Gasht-Masuleh area in the Alborz Mountains, gabbroic magma intruded Palaeozoic metasediments and Mesozoic sediments and crystallised as isotropic and cumulate gabbros. LREE enrichment points to relatively low degrees of mantle melting and depletion of Ti, Nb and Ta relative to primitive mantle points to an arc related component in the magma. Clinopyroxene compositions indicate MORB to arc signatures. U–Pb zircon crystallisation ages of 99.5 ± 0.6 Ma and 99.4 ± 0.6 Ma and phlogopite 40Ar/39Ar ages of 97.1 ± 0.4 Ma, 97.5 ± 0.4 Ma, 97.1 ± 0.1 Ma, within 2σ error, indicate that gabbro intrusion occurred in the (Albian-)Cenomanian (mid-Cretaceous). As active subduction did not take place in the Cretaceous in North Iran, the small volume mafic magmatism in the Gasht-Masuleh area must be due to local, extension-related mantle melting. Melting was most likely caused by far field effects triggered by roll-back of the Neo-Tethys subducting slab. As subduction took place at a distance of ~ 400&nbsp;km (present distance) from the Alborz Mountains, the observed arc geochemical signatures must be inherited from a previous subduction event and concomitant mantle metasomatism, possibly in combination with contamination of the magma by crustal material.",

        "text": "6.1 Whole rock geochemistry\n\nSince the whole rock chemistry of cumulates is controlled by modal proportions of cumulate minerals and not by melt, we only focus on the chemistry of isotropic gabbros, considering these to be the closest representative of magma compositions. These we compared with the chemistry of other mid-Cretaceous basic magmatic rocks in the west Alborz Mountains, especially the basalts from Abrud village in the Gasht-Masuleh area (Rezaei et al., 2020) and the Talesh-Lahijan basaltic lavas (Monsef et al., 2022).\n\nWhole rock major oxides and selected trace elements for the isotropic gabbros (including rare earth element, REE) concentrations are given in Additional file 2: Table S2. SiO2 contents are 42.2–47.8 wt% and MgO (3.9–12.6 wt%), TiO2 (0.5–2.8 wt%), FeOt (6.0–16.1 wt%), Al2O3 (10.5–18.0 wt%), CaO (10.4–19.2 wt%), Na2O (0.2–2.7 wt%) and K2O (0.7–1.5 wt%) show variable ranges. Whole rock Mg# show a considerable range from 38.7 to 76.6 and LOI values vary between 1.2 to 3.4 wt%.\n\nFigure 4A–I shows the variation diagrams for whole rock SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, FeOt, TiO2, Na2O, Sr, Ni and Zr concentrations against MgO as fractionation index. They show that SiO2 concentrations stay within the narrow range of 41–48 wt% whereas CaO increases and Al2O3, TiO2 and Na2O decrease with increasing MgO. FeOt shows no recognizable correlation and, except two samples (16FMN48B and 16FMN70A). Sr, Zr contents decrease and Ni increases with increasing MgO. The Gasht-Masuleh gabbros do not show distinct compositional differences from the basalts from Abrud and Talesh-Lahijan areas.\n\nChondrite normalised rare earth elements (REE) patterns show moderate LREE enrichment (Fig. 5A). Apart from Eu, patterns for all samples are sub-parallel, showing similar trends to bulk continental crust of Rudnick and Gao (2003) and plot below the oceanic island basalt (OIB) values of Sun and McDonough (1989). Compared to N-MORB (Sun & McDonough, 1989) the gabbros are enriched in LREE and depleted in HREE. (La/Yb)N vary from 3.9 to 7.9, overlapping those of the Abrud and Talesh-Lahijan basalts. (La/Sm)N vary from 1.2 to 2.6 and (Dy/Yb)N vary from 1.4 to 1.8 in the samples. Europium anomalies (EuN/Eu*) are absent to weakly negative in most samples (0.8–1.0), and slightly more negative in sample 16FMN22C-2 (0.8).\n\nTotal REE concentrations are 30–123 ppm with total LREE (La–Nd) concentrations of 13–69 and total HREE (Sm-Lu) concentrations of 6–22 times chondrite (Additional file 2). LaN = 16–89 and YbN = 4–12.\n\nThe primitive mantle normalised multi-element patterns (Fig. 5B) are sub-parallel and resemble that of OIB, except that some samples have higher Rb, Ba and K concentrations. Nb, Ta, P and Ti are generally depleted causing negative anomalies to varying degrees.\n\n6.2 Mineral chemistry\n\nSelected analyses of olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and phlogopite are listed in Additional file 3, Additional file 4, Additional file 5, Additional file 6 and Additional file 7, respectively.\n\n6.2.1 Olivine\n\nIndividual crystals lack compositional variations from rim to core and are mainly homogenous. Olivine in cumulate samples is relatively magnesium-rich with Mg# between 69.1 and 75.3, compared to olivine in isotropic gabbros (65.7–69.5). NiO contents are very low and range from below detection limit to 0.16 wt% in both cumulates and isotropic gabbros, and do not correlate with forsterite (Fo) content. Cr2O3 abundances are below 0.03 wt% in all olivine-bearing samples. MnO ranges between 0.28 and 0.61 wt% and shows a slight inverse correlation with Fo contents. Olivine in cumulate samples has Fo68.7–75, whereas Fo65-69.1 in isotropic gabbros. Furthermore, Fo component in all samples is lower than those in mantle peridotites (Fo > 83%, Takahashi, 1986). Olivine in Chapul cumulate samples is richer in Fo71.9–75 compared to those in the Gilvanderud and Zudel cumulates (71.1–73.4% resp. 68.7–72.2%).\n\n6.2.2 Orthopyroxene\n\nOrthopyroxene is rare and appears at the rims of olivine and rarely as individual grains. Orthopyroxenes in cumulate gabbros is slightly richer in Mg (Mg# 73.2–76.9) and Al (0.2–1.5 wt% Al2O3) than those in isotropic samples (Mg# 64.7–74.8; 0.1–1.2 wt% Al2O3), but CaO contents in both cumulate and isotropic samples are similar (0.2–1.3 wt%). Orthopyroxene end-member (wollastonite, enstatite and ferrosilite) compositions are Wo0.4–2.5En73.8–78.9Fs19.7–24.7 in cumulate samples, and Wo0.5–2.6En63.3–76.4Fs22.6–34.1 in isotropic samples (calculated following Howie et al., 1992). They are enstatite according to the classification of Morimoto, (1988) (Additional file 4).\n\n6.2.3 Clinopyroxene\n\nMg# of clinopyroxene in cumulate samples varies between 67.4 and 92.3, and in isotropic gabbros between 69.3 and 91.5 (Additional file 5: Table S5). Clinopyroxene in cumulate samples comprises Wo41.2–51.6En41.1-51Fs0.9–12.7 end member component, whereas clinopyroxene in isotropic gabbros contains Wo42.5–50.5En37.5–49.9Fs2.4–16.5. Clinopyroxene in plagioclase-bearing cumulate samples has higher amounts of Fs compared to those in olivine-bearing cumulates. Clinopyroxene in all three intrusions lacks significant compositional major and trace element zoning. They are diopside to augite according to the classification of Morimoto (1988).\n\n6.2.4 Plagioclase\n\nPlagioclase in most samples is altered to various degrees, and only unaltered parts were analysed. Plagioclase in both cumulate and isotropic samples has similar compositions and is zoned. Anorthite (An) end-member contents range widely from very low 7.1 (probably secondary plagioclase) to 89.2 mol% for cumulate and 11.8 to 92.4 mol% for isotropic samples, with cores having high and rims low An contents. Selected trace element concentrations for plagioclases in three cumulate and two isotropic samples are at or just above detection limits: < 0.02–0.1 wt% Rb2O, < 0.04–0.1 wt% BaO, 0.1–0.3 wt% SrO and < 0.03–0.3 wt% Eu2O3. Sr and Ba concentrations for low-An rims and high-An cores in both cumulate and isotropic samples overlap and do not correlate with the respective anorthite end-member compositions, but Rb concentrations in rims are at or below the detection limit, and Eu concentrations at the rims are lower on average than in cores.\n\n6.2.5 Phlogopite\n\nPhlogopites generally have high TiO2 contents of up to 7.6 wt% and high MgO contents of up to 23.9 wt%. CaO contents reach 0.2 wt% (K2O contents vary from 6.8 to 9.9 wt%. Mg# for phlogopite in cumulates are 53.0–85.0, and 60.7–83.3 in isotropic gabbros. Many phlogopites are enriched in Cl (0.1–0.4 wt% in cumulates and 0.2–0.5 wt% in isotropic gabbros) and F (up to 0.3 wt% in cumulates and up to 0.2 wt% in isotropic gabbros). Phlogopites in samples 16FMN45A and 16FMN20A that were dated by 40Ar/39Ar step-heating show no evidence for Ti, Mg, K and Fe compositional zoning.\n\n6.3 Geochronology\n\n6.3.1 LA-ICP MS U–Pb zircon dating results\n\nTwo samples, a cumulate (15FMN06) and an isotropic gabbro (GH 16–77) were chosen for LA-ICP-MS U–Pb zircon dating. Samples descriptions are given in Additional file 8. The dated zircons are colourless, mainly euhedral long prismatic crystals of up to 100 µm long and ~ 50 µm wide. Some crystals are fragmented due to sample processing. In CL images most crystals show concentric growth zoning typical for magmatic zircons (Fig. 6A, B). U concentrations vary from 174 to 3002 ppm, Th concentrations from 85 and 8764 ppm, and Th/U ratios range from 0.1 to 11.2 ppm. Analysis number (gh1677_13) displays a Th content of 22280 ppm and U content of 3790 ppm, suggesting it is a potential outlier. These concentrations may be analytical artefacts or due to heterogeneity of the zircon grain. However, the Th, U and Pb concentrations of analysis gh1677-13 do not have a significant influence on the calculated age. For the calculation of Concordia ages, only analyses that are 2% or less discordant were used. The analytical data, the ranked and weighted 238U-206Pb age average plots, the Concordia diagrams with all analysed points, and the data reporting sheet are given in Additional file 9.\n\nLeucocratic gabbro 15FMN06 (Zudel) yielded thirteen spot ages, of which one is 14.9% discordant and has a 101 Ma 206Pb/238U age (X15fmn06_5). Of the thirteen analyses, twelve that are < 2% discordant were used to calculate a Concordia age of 99.5 ± 0.6 Ma (Fig. 6A). Isotropic gabbro GH 16–77 (Gilvanderud) yielded fourteen spot ages of which four (grains 1, 3, 10 and 12) were more than 2% discordant. Two further analyses are 8.1 and 8.2% discordant and have 206Pb/238U ages of 104 resp. 101 Ma (gh1677_10 and _3). Ten, < 2% discordant analyses yield a Concordia age of 99.4 ± 0.6 Ma (Fig. 6B). One grain yielded a 119 Ma age that was 66% discordant and not included in the age calculation (analysis gh1677_12, Additional file 9).\n\n6.3.2 40Ar/39Ar phlogopite step-heating dating results\n\nStep-heating dating of magmatic phlogopite of three cumulate gabbro samples yielded plateau ages on 2-sigma level for samples 16FMN20A (Zudel) and 16FMN45A (Gilvanderud), but the age spectrum of sample 15FMN05A (Chapul) only allowed calculation of a forced plateau age. 40Ar/39Ar step-heating data including uncertainties are given in Additional file 10. Phlogopite 16FMN20A (Zudel) yielded a 97.1 ± 0.4 Ma plateau age for five gas fractions 8 to 12 comprising 69% of the total 39Ar released (Fig. 7A), similar to the 97.2 ± 0.4 Ma total gas age. Phlogopite 16FMN45A (Gilvanderud) yielded a 97.5 ± 0.4 Ma plateau age for six gas fractions 4 to 9 comprising 94% of the 39Ar released (Fig. 7B), which is indistinguishable from the 97.7 ± 0.4 Ma total gas age. In contrast, apparent ages for 15FMN05A (Chapul) did not yield a plateau age, but noting that gas fractions 4 to 10 have apparent ages that are similar (between 94.7 Ma and 98.9 Ma) and almost within 4 Ma of each other, comprising 95% of the 39Ar released. However, the longest continuous steps which agree within 2-sigma error by their internal errors (excluding common J value errors) were only obtained for steps 5 to 6 (comprising 34% of the 39Ar released). These steps are here named a forced plateau, which does not satisfy the typical criteria of the plateau that should comprise more than 50% of the 39Ar released. The weighted mean age calculated from these forced plateau steps is 97.1 ± 0.1 Ma. This forced plateau age is indistinguishable from the 97.2 ± 0.4 Ma total gas age (Fig. 7C) and both ages also overlap the plateau ages of samples 16FMN20A and 16FMN45A within 1-sigma.\n\n7.1 Petrography and crystallisation sequence\n\nThe crystallisation sequence of the gabbros is olivine, present as isolated individual crystals or as inclusions in clinopyroxene, followed by clinopyroxene, and clinopyroxene and plagioclase. Fe-Ti oxides occur both as inclusions in phlogopite and clinopyroxene, and as individual grains. Phlogopite appears as the latest phase as both subhedral to anhedral crystals, overgrows Fe-Ti oxides and locally replaces clinopyroxene.\n\nThe textural varieties of the Fe-Ti oxides (Fig. 3B) indicate a cooling history under oxidizing conditions of an originally homogeneous magmatic Fe-Ti phase, such as ulvöspinel-rich magnetite. Trellis, sandwich and composite textures are super-solvus exsolution textures that formed at temperatures above the magnetite-ulvöspinel solvus, whereas cloth-like to graphic and vermicular textures formed at sub-solvus conditions (Buddington & Lindsley, 1964). Furthermore, crystallisation of an OH-bearing magmatic mineral such as phlogopite points to elevated water contents of the magma during the final stages of crystallisation. We suggest that, following crystallisation and (in cumulate samples) gravitational settling of a homogenous Fe-Ti oxide phase, the trellis, sandwich and composite type textures developed upon cooling of the rocks to temperatures of 800–850 °C (e.g. Buddington & Lindsley, 1964) in the presence of small amounts of H2O-rich fluids. The fine-grained character of the minerals involved in the cloth-like ilmenite-magnetite exsolutions indicate formation during increased cooling rates at lower temperatures.\n\n7.2 Whole rock compositions\n\nThe MgO contents of the isotropic gabbros are between 3.9 and 12.6 wt%. This also explains the dominantly linear trends in the variation diagrams that lack inflections (Fig. 4A–I). The variation diagrams show that Al2O3 and Na2O decrease and CaO increases with increasing MgO concentrations, overall indicating fractional crystallisation of clinopyroxene before plagioclase. Samples with low MgO have an elevated TiO2 concentrations caused by the presence of large phlogopite crystals and (especially for the Zudel intrusion) magnetite-ilmenite exsolutions. Ni concentrations increase with increasing MgO due to the presence olivine. Like Al2O3, Sr concentrations decrease with increasing MgO in gabbros reflecting fractionation of plagioclase. The major oxides and trace element compositions of the isotropic gabbros overlap with the compositions of basalts from Abrud and Talesh-Lahijan areas.\n\nThe multi-element patterns for the Gasht-Masuleh isotropic gabbros overlap that of bulk continental crust of Rudnick and Gao (2003) (Fig. 5A). Compared to primitive mantle, the samples are enriched in LILE (Ba, Rb, K) and depleted in HFSE (Nb, Ta, Zr, Ti and P in Fig. 5B) which points to a subduction-related component, the influence of slab derived fluids in their mantle source, and possibly to contamination of magma by continental crust and/or low degree of mantle melting. Generally, the patterns gently slope from Rb to Yb, and show positive and negative anomalies. Nb and Ta depletions seen in many of the samples point to magma generation in an arc-related setting, or their contamination by continental crust (White & Patchett, 1984), or may be a feature inherited from the mantle source (see Discussion below). Ti depletion may be a primary feature of the mantle source, but can also be due to removal of Fe-Ti oxides during fractionation.\n\nREE and trace elements are considered to describe the character of the of Gasht-Masuleh gabbro magma. In the Nb/Y vs. Ti/Y diagram of Pearce, (1982) the samples trend from the low Ti and low Nb mid-ocean ridge fields to the volcanic arc field together with the basalts from Abrud and Talesh-Lahijan areas, having sub-alkaline Nb/Y ratios < 1 (Fig. 8A).\n\nNb/La ratios of the isotropic gabbros are lower than those for MORB and OIB (0.2–0.7) suggesting a lithospheric mantle source, and/or contributions by lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle to the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros (Fig. 8B; Smith et al., 1999).\n\nIsotropic gabbros and the basalts from the West Alborz (here compared samples from Abrud and Talesh-Lahijan areas) show a transitional magma character between tholeiitic and calc-alkaline to calc-alkaline magmas on the Zr/Y vs. Th/Yb magmatic affinity diagram of Ross and Bédard, (2009) (Fig. 9A). Zr, Nb, and Y contents are useful in identifying the source components of the magma (Condie, 2003, 2005; Fitton et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1999). Zr/Nb values range from 9 to 19 the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros (except for sample 16FMN48B with Zr/Nb = 58). This ratio indicates slight Zr enrichment of the mantle source compared to N-MORB (Zr/Nb = 32, Sun & McDonough, 1989), although variations in Zr/Nb may also reflect the heterogeneity of the magma source (White & Duncan, 1996) (Fig. 9B). Continental crust is characterised by enrichment in La rather than Nb (Rudnick & Gao, 2003) and, apart from contributions by lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle, low Nb/La suggest contributions by a crustal contaminant during evolution of the magma. The LREE/HREE (La/Yb) ratios (5 to 13) are within the range of the lower crust to upper crust compositions (5 and 16) of Rudnick and Gao, (2003), implying crustal contamination of the magma (Fig. 9B) or contributions by slab-derived fluids (see below, Fig. 12). The gabbros plot above the MORB-OIB array of Pearce, (2008) (Fig. 9C), indicating some degree of crustal contamination as well as Th/Nb ratios (> 0.15) indicate contributions of continental crust to the magma (Shervais, 2022). Compared to primitive mantle, the samples are enriched in Th and Nb and in this respect, have compositions between the lower and upper crust of Rudnick and Gao, (2003). Enrichment of their mantle source is shown in the Zr/Y vs. Nb/Y diagram of Condie, (2005), the samples scatter in the Oceanic Plateau Basalts and OIB fields (Fig. 9D), and have higher Nb/Y ratios than arc-related magmatic rocks. They, thereby, plot above the ∆Nb line of Fitton et al., (1997) which points an enriched component contribution (EN) to the magma. The enriched component may either be continental crust, or subcontinental lithospheric mantle that may have inherited a geochemical signature of older subduction processes (Condie, 2005).\n\nTaking La/Yb as a proxy for the degree of melting, the high La/Yb indicate low degrees of melting. Non-modal melting curves calculated for garnet-bearing and spinel lherzolite mantle sources of depleted and primitive composition are shown on the primitive mantle normalised (La/Yb)N vs. (Dy/Yb)N plot (Fig. 10). This diagram utilises the fractionation of the middle (Dy) from the heavy (Yb) REE during melting in the garnet peridotite stability field, whereas melting in the spinel-facies produces little change in Dy/Yb ratios (Thirlwall et al., 1994). The Gasht-Masuleh gabbros, Abrud and Talesh-Lahijan basalts plot close to the spinel lherzolite melting curves indicating that mid-Cretaceous gabbros and the basalts in the western Alborz Mountains originate from relatively shallow mantle. This is supported by the relatively flat HREE patterns of the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros that do not indicate the presence of garnet in their source ((Dy/Yb)N = 1.4–1.8; Fig. 10).\n\nComparing published data for basic rocks from the western, central and eastern Alborz (Fig. 9A–E, references for the published data are given in the figure caption), basic rocks in the west and central Alborz and the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros have very similar compositions, whereas those of basic rocks in the east Alborz (Sabzevar area) differ (Additional file 11 shows the location of compared basic rocks). Those in the West Alborz were generated from a mantle source that was more enriched compared to those in the Sabzevar region. Figure 9 shows that basic rocks in the West-Central Alborz were formed in an OIB-like/arc-like tectonic setting, while those in the East Alborz were mostly formed in a MORB setting. As mentioned above, the evolution of the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros magma involved contamination the crustal material. In almost all comparative diagrams, the compositions of the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros and the West-Central Alborz basic rocks overlap with calc-alkaline rocks in the Basin and Range (USA) area (Hawkesworth et al., 1995; Hooper et al., 1995) and in the Eastern Pontides (Turkey) and the Lesser Caucasus (Armenia; Monsef et al., 2022 and references therein) that formed in an extensional tectonic setting.\n\n7.3 Mineral compositions\n\nIn the Mg# vs. Al2O3 diagram (DeBari & Coleman, 1989) the orthopyroxene does not plot on the Al2O3 enrichment trend but along a low pressure differentiation trend due to their relatively low Al2O3 contents. This points to crystallisation of the magma under low pressure conditions in a shallow magma chamber at upper crustal levels (Fig. 11A). We have found no petrographic evidence, such as plagioclase crystallisation before olivine, which might have supported shallow levels of crystallisation. Orthopyroxene Al2O3 contents range from 0.1 to 1.2 wt.%. The low Al2O3 contents of the orthopyroxenes (< 0.6 apfu) are an indicator for low pressures of crystallization. Using Emslie et al. (1994), we calculate very low pressures (ca. 0.23 kbar) that should probably not be taken literally as medium-grained, doleritic textures should be expected, but as an indication for crystallization at shallow crustal levels. Rezaei et al., (2019) point out that the Al2O3, Na2O and Cr2O3 contents of orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene are low, indicating crystallisation at low pressure at upper crustal levels. They obtained temperatures in the range 800–900 °C, using pyroxene thermometry (Köhler & Brey, 1990; Nimis & Taylor, 2000), that are unusually low for mafic melts and do not reflect crystallisation temperatures.\n\nClinopyroxene Mg# and Cr2O3 show a positive correlation for both isotropic and cumulate samples. Clinopyroxene from isotropic gabbros plot mainly in the field of low pressure clinopyroxenes derived from 1 atm experimental studies of N-MOR basalts (Elthon, 1987) (Fig. 11B). Al2O3 content of clinopyroxenes in both cumulate and isotropic samples are low (≤ 5.2 wt%) and do not correlate with Mg #. In the Mg# vs. Al2O3 diagram (DeBari & Coleman, 1989) (Fig. 11C) most plot below the low pressure Skaergaard trend. TiO2 contents of clinopyroxenes of cumulate samples are lower (≤ 1.04 wt%) than those of isotropic samples (≤ 1.63 wt%). Clinopyroxenes of the Zudel intrusion have moderately high TiO2 contents (≤ 1.04 wt%), which reflects the higher TiO2 whole rock abundances of the Zudel samples. The, on average, low Ti contents of clinopyroxenes from both cumulate and isotropic samples from all three intrusions (≤ 0.05 p.f.u) point to Ti depletion of the magma source(s) (Pearce & Norry, 1979).\n\nThe TiO2 and Al2O3 contents of the clinopyroxenes plot in the overlapping fields for arc and mid-ocean ridge gabbros (Beccaluva et al., 1989) (Fig. 11D). In the TiO2 vs. Al2O3 diagram for clinopyroxenes from isotropic and cumulate gabbros (Parlak et al., 2020), the clinopyroxenes mainly cluster in the low pressure field with some analyses plotting in the moderate pressure field and beyond (Fig. 11E). The relatively low TiO2 and Al2O3 and high SiO2 of the analysed clinopyroxenes tend to indicate a calc-alkaline nature for the magma, as clinopyroxene in mid-ocean ridge basalts generally are higher, and those in arc-related basalts lower Ti contents (LeBas, 1962).\n\n7.4 Zircon and phlogopite ages\n\nThe 99.5 ± 0.6 Ma and 99.4 ± 0.6 Ma U–Pb zircon Concordia ages for the Zudel leucogabbro and Gilvanderud isotropic gabbro overlap within 2σ error and are interpreted as crystallisation ages of the magmas that must have intruded in the mid-Cretaceous around the (Albian-)Cenomanian boundary. The 40Ar/39Ar phlogopite step-heating ages for the three intrusions fall in the narrow range ca. 97–98 Ma and are 1 to 2 Ma younger than the U–Pb zircon ages. The younger phlogopite ages agree with the petrographic observations that it is the last phase to crystallise. We consider that the three intrusions crystallised and cooled coevally.\n\n7.5 Comparison with other Cretaceous mafic magmatic rock in the Alborz Mountains\n\nAnnells, (1975) reported a 1.5 km thick sequence of Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian) intermediate to mafic lavas in the Qazvin area NW of Tehran (Additional file 11) but presented no geochemical data. Furthermore, basic and plagiogranite dykes in the Sabzevar–Torbat-e-Heidariye area indicate the opening of back-arc basins in NE Iran as a response to an extensional tectonic regime in the Late Cretaceous (ca. 100–110 Ma K–Ar whole rock ages, Delaloye et al., 1981; 91–99 Ma U–Pb zircon age, Shafaii Moghadam et al., 2020). The Chalus Formation exposed in the Marzanabad, Abbasabad and Kojur areas north of Tehran (Additional file 11) comprises several phases of mafic volcanic rocks, such as Barremian alkaline olivine basalts and Turonian high-alumina basalts (Cartier, 1971; Wensink & Varekamp, 1980). These erupted in a shallow marine basin mainly filled with limestones (Allen et al., 2003) that overlie the Jurassic Shemshak Group with an angular unconformity and are overlain by Aptian-Cenomanian limestones of the Tizkuh Formation (Ansari, 2013; Ansari et al., 2011; Cartier, 1971). Whole rock geochemistry of the olivine basaltic andesites to olivine andesitic basalts of the Kojur and basanites of the Abbasabad volcanic fields indicate that the mantle-derived primary magma were alkaline and originated from a garnet bearing lherzolite source (Ansari, 2013; Ansari et al., 2011). This, and the fact that they erupted onto continental crust points to an intra-continental setting of the Chalus Formation magmatism, e.g. the central Alborz crust (Ansari, 2013; Ansari et al., 2011). Guest et al., (2006 and references therein), reported a 97.4 ± 1.8 Ma ion-probe 206Pb/238U zircon age for the diorite phase and a 96.9 ± 2.4 Ma age for the (rapakivi) granite phase of the composite Nusha Pluton 150 km to the ESE of the Gasht-Masuleh area. These zircon ages overlap with ca. 97–100 Ma 40Ar/39Ar phlogopite and U–Pb zircon ages for the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros (this study). This indicates that (Albian-)Cenomanian plutonic activity was not local but occurred over large areas, possibly constituting a long-lasting and widespread mafic volcano-plutonic stage in the Alborz Mountains.\n\n120 km to the east of the Gasht-Masuleh area on the Caspian Sea coast, basic volcanic rocks, small gabbro intrusions and ultramafic cumulates of suspected Cretaceous age occur south of Amlash (Annells, 1975). The gabbros and cumulates have a mantle source that was modified by subduction (Salavati et al., 2013). In contrast, the basalts are alkaline and have an OIB-like mantle source (Salavati, 2008). In the Javaherdasht area 20 km SE of Amlash, isotropic and layered gabbros intrude Jurassic clastic sediments and limestone of the Javaherdeh Formation. The isotropic gabbros have high Na2O, K2O, TiO2 and FeOt contents compared to the layered gabbros and were probably derived from MORB-like spinel-bearing mantle source(s) and show trace element evidence for contamination with crustal material (Haghnazar et al., 2011). The layered gabbros have high Mg# and high Ni, Cr and Co abundances, both types may have formed in a continental rift setting (Haghnazar et al., 2011). Basalts and gabbros in the Javaherdasht, the Gasht-Masuleh and the Talesh Mountains areas formed in an extensional setting but show an arc geochemical signature that is the result of contamination by crustal components (Haghnazar et al., 2011; Monsef et al., 2022; Rezaei et al., 2019, 2020). Cretaceous magmatic rocks in the Deylaman area (Additional file 11) comprise pillow and sheet lavas, trachytes, alkali rhyolites and olivine gabbro and monzodiorite intrusions with sub-alkaline to alkaline signatures (Akmali et al., 2019).\n\nComparison of the gabbros in the Gasht-Masuleh area with published data of other Cretaceous mafic magmatic rocks in the Alborz Mountains shows that more than half have elevated Ba/La (i.e. higher than MORB) at relatively low Th/Yb ratios (Fig. 12; Woodhead et al., 2001). This may be attributed to the effects of fluids derived from a previously subducted oceanic slab (Arculus & Powell, 1986; Woodhead et al., 2001), possibly of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean because most magmatic activities related to Neo-Tethys subduction are concentrated in the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone far to the south of the Alborz Mountains (Hassanzadeh & Wernicke, 2016). The volcanic rocks in the Chalus area form an exception, trending to high Th/Yb at low Ba/La ratios reflecting mixing of mantle source material with magma derived from subducted sediments (Ansari, 2013; Ansari et al., 2011).\n\n7.6 Tectonic setting\n\nNeo-Tethys oceanic crust subduction beneath the Central Iranian Platform initiated in the Late Triassic and intensified during the Jurassic until the formation of the Cretaceous Sanandaj-Sirjan Arc (Hassanzadeh & Wernicke, 2016 and references therein). Arc-related gabbros near Chaldoran (Rezaei Bargoshadi et al., 2020), acidic to intermediate magmatic rocks near Khoy (112–96 Ma U–Pb zircon ages; Lechmann et al., 2018), diorites and gabbros near Naqadeh (~ 97 Ma U–Pb zircon age; Mazhari et al., 2011) and near Urmia (99–100 Ma biotite K–Ar, Ghalamghash et al., 2009) argue for arc-related magmatism.\n\nCretaceous magmatism related to Neo-Tethys subduction is widespread in the Zagros Belt in NE Iraq, where arc related acidic to basic magmatic rocks occur at Kata-Rash (~ 108 Ma zircon age), basic to intermediate volcanic rocks at Hasanbagh (~ 106–92 Ma magmatic hornblende 40Ar/39Ar step-heating ages; Ali et al., 2013, 2016), and oceanic arc-related volcanic and plutonic rocks at Pushtashan (~ 96 Ma U–Pb zircon age; Ismail et al., 2017). In central Turkey, arc related magmatic rocks formed during Neo-Tethys subduction have Late Cretaceous ages (~ 92 Ma, U–Pb zircon ages for gabbros and granites; e.g. Temizel et al., 2022; Monsef et al., 2022 and references therein). Middle Jurassic to Late Cretaceous alkaline and calc-alkaline volcanic rocks in the Pontides and Lesser Caucasus have been interpreted as arc related magmatic rocks that formed above the north dipping Neo-Tethys subduction zone (~ 170–83 Ma; summarised in Hässig et al., 2015 and references therein).\n\nIn the Alborz Mountains, tectonic activity was limited in the Cretaceous. Sedimentation was of a quiet nature with low sedimentation rates of predominant shallow marine reef carbonates and marls (Clark et al., 1975; Saidi et al., 1997) and subduction was cetrainly not taking place in this area. Guest et al. (2006) tentatively suggested that the Cretaceous magmatic activity might be related to subduction of the Neo-Tethys Ocean and arc formation in the Zagros Belt at least 380 km to the SW, implying that a very wide area was affected by this subduction system. Thus, the mantle derived magmatism in the Alborz Mountains may be due to extension causing mantle melting, both triggered by far-field effects of the Neo-Tethys subduction zone. A similar setting was proposed for the Permo-Carboniferous mafic magmatism in the foreland of the Variscan Orogen in Europe (e.g. Timmerman, 2004).\n\nGeochemical data for the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros such as Ti, Nb and Ta negative anomalies, low Nb/Th and elevated and variable Ba/La ratios, indicate that their magma was derived from a mantle source marked an arc signature. In general, mantle metasomatism appears to be mainly the result of slab-derived fluids, except for the alkaline basalts of the Chalus Formation that show evidence for contributions from subducted sediments (Fig. 12). The Cenomanian plate tectonic reconstruction of Barrier et al., (2018) (Fig. 13) illustrates that north-dipping Neo-Tethys subduction occurred in the future Zagros Belt and that in the northeastern, overriding plate, extension-related magmatism took place in the Alborz Mountains. Here, magmatism occurred in a shallow marine environment and was associated with faulting that probably facilitated the magma ascent such as that of the Gasht-Masuleh gabbros. As there is no evidence for Jurassic-Cretaceous subduction in the Alborz Mountains, these signatures must have been inherited from an older event, probably subduction of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean in the Carboniferous and its closure in the Triassic (Stampfli & Borel, 2002). The Palaeo-Tethys suture is assumed to lie to the north of the Alborz Mountains (e.g. Omrani et al., 2013; Stampfli & Kozur, 2006). Local normal faulting and the generation of small volumes of magmatic rocks in the Alborz Mountains in the Cretaceous were probably the response to extension and the far field tectonic effects of slab roll-back and back-arc opening due to the north dipping Neo-Tethys subduction zone in central Iran (Agard et al., 2011). The short-lived, local, relatively small volume and often mafic mid-Cretaceous magmatism in the Gasht-Masuleh area may be linked to such short-lived extension stages that caused passive mantle upwelling and low degree mantle decompression melting (Fig. 14). Relatively rapid ascent of the mantle-derived magma probably took place along deep-seated fault zones. These may have been newly formed normal faults or reactivated old faults (including thrusts and strike-slip faults) inherited from closure of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean in the Late Triassic."
