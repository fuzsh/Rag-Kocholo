Koote] is a canal called the Hye, which runs into the Euphrates to the north of Soogishiookh: its banks are a noted haunt for lions and other ferocious animals. At this time [ie. Oct. 1826] its bed is perfectly dry, though it is navigable for eight months in the year.\" [p.27]\n\nRiver Deaala: Diyala [or Diala] River\n\nRiver in central Iraq; rises in the mountains of northern Iraq and flows SW into the Tigris River at Baghdad.

The full extent of the front, or eastern face, is three hundred feet. It is divided by a high semicircular arch, supported by walls sixteen feet thick; the arch itself making a span of eighty-six feet, and rising to the height of one hundred and three feet. The front of the building is ornamented and surmounted by four rows of small arched recesses, resembling in form the large one. The style and execution of these are most delicate, evincing a fertile invention and great experience in the architectural art.\" [Mignan pp. 71-72]. However, in 1908, half of the remaining vault and façade of the Taq-I Kisra collapsed following flooding by the Tigris. In 1915 there was heavy fighting on the site between Turkish and British armies.\n\nPERSIA (Iran)\n\nAlwand Mountains: Alvand, Alwand, or Alvand Kuh\n\nMountain chain in western Iran, located near Hamadan, with several peaks over 3,500 m and a summit of 3,580 m. Part of the Zagros mountains, approx. 50 km long, with a maximum north-south breadth is 30 km. The range bears a trilingual ancient inscription (Neo Elamite, Neo Babylonian and Old Persian) of King Darius the great and king Xerxes I, called Gan&eacute-nama, 10km south of Hamadan.\n\nAnseley: Bandar-e Anzali\n\nIran's foremost Caspian Sea port city.\n\nBeesatoon: Bisitun, Bisotun or Behistun\n\nStrategically located, scenically dramatic site in western Iran, 20 miles (32 km) east of Kermanshah (Bactaran) (34° 35' N, 47°25' E). Bisitun is noted principally for the rock-cut relief and inscriptions on the precipitous southeast face of the Bisitun mountain; erected by the Achaemenid ruler Darius the Great (522-486 BCE). The relief is approximately 3 m high and 5.5 m wide. It is bordered on three sides by trilingual inscriptions in Elamite, Babylonian, and Old Persian commemorating Darius' military victory over five rebel chiefs and asserting his claims to the Achaemenid throne. The whole composition has a height of approx. 7 m. and an overall width of 18 m. The monument stands 70 m above the ancient Silk Road. For many centuries the meaning and significance of the Bisitun monument was wholly lost; then in the C19th Henry Rawlinson (1810-1895) re-established the identity of the monument as being the handiwork of Darius. Rawlinson examined and copied the inscriptions in the period 1835-1847. He shares with the Irish cleric Edward Hincks and the Frenchman Jules Oppert the credit for the decipherment of cuneiform writing and establishing that Babylonian was a Semitic, polyphonic language. The later erected statue of Hercules has been vandalized in recent times and is now missing its head and one arm.\n\nCasbeen: Qazvin or Kazvin\n\nCity located approx. 90 miles (145 miles) NW of Tehran.

The city lies on the Volga river, close to where it empties into the Caspian Sea. In the middle of the 17th century Astrakhan became one of the border fortresses of Russia, protecting the mouth of the Volga. In the 18th century a strong naval fleet, dockyards and port were created in Astrakhan, and in C16th-C19th centuries it became the main center of trade within the Caucasus and Trans-Caucasus, with Central Asia, Iran and India. A cholera epidemic ravaged this region in early 19th century. Plague had appeared at Constantinople in 1802-1803, about the same time in Armenia (Kars), and in 1801 in Bagdad. It had prevailed since 1798 in Georgia and the Caucasus, and in 1803-1806 began to spread from the north of the Caucasus into Russia, till in 1806 it was established at or near Astrakhan, and in 1807 reached Zareff, 200 m. higher up the Volga. To control the situation, quarantine posts had to be established, and this task was partly entrusted to Astrakhan cossacks in addition to their responsibilities in cordoning and military operations against the tribes, and protection of post houses and mail deliveries.

It was first held by Russia from 1728 to 1735, but only fell definitively to Russia in 1813, status confirmed by the Treaty of Gulistan (1813), signed by Russia and Iran (Persia) at Gulistan, a village in what is now N.W.

Tsitsianov (1754-1806) and Khan Huseingulu, the then ruler of Baku, the General was shot and his soldiers had to make a hasty retreat to Sara Island. Seven months later, on September 18, 1806, the Russians returned and this time captured Baku and the surrounding region.
