The village was established more than a thousand years ago. Forever covered in fog, which barely leaves the village, Masouleh is an incredible spectacle: a series of cottages built on a slope, such that each house's courtyard is another house's rooftop. Because of this the houses are constructed in stepped terraces and are interconnected. The terrace of each house functions as the courtyard of the house above. In some cases, public streets are laid out along interconnected roofs.",
