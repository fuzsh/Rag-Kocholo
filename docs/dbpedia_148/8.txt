Located in the Loiret, between Beauce and Gâtinais Loire Valley, at only 1h30 from Paris, is a common Bellegarde rich history. Its architecture dates back to the city center from the 12th to the 18th century.

In 1124, the Canons Regular of Sens began building the oldest monument in the city: the church. The portal is currently classified historical monument and is considered one of the finest examples of Romanesque art in the region after the Basilica of Saint-Benoit-sur-Loire.

Later, Nicolas Braque, first lord of Bellegarde, rebuilt the stone keep. It will be inaugurated by King Charles the fifth in 1376.

In the late 15th century, one of his descendants, the Jacques Hospital, will begin building the yard of the castle (barns and farms) and Tower Captain (old pigeon).

In 1646, after buying the domain to the family of the Hospital, the Duke of Bellegarde give his name to the city.

In 1692, Louis Antoine de Pardaillan of Gondrin - legitimate son of the Marquise de Montespan, mistress of Louis the 14th second - became Marquis of Bellegarde. He later became superintendent of buildings called the King and the Duke d'Antin. This status will enable it to redesign the castle Bellegarde including beautification of stables and construction of several buildings around the tower.

In 1972, the city is designated Bellegarde First Village of the Roses of France. This award caps a strong tradition of growing roses dating back to the late 19th century. Today, a dozen rose growers / nurseries are present in the canton of Bellegarde, heirs of a knowledge passed from generation to generation.
