The chateau, rebuilt 1722, belonged to Monsieur, brother of Louis XVI. The title of Marquis de Brunoy was conferred upon the Duke of Wellington by Louis XVIII. after the Battle of Waterloo. 45 k.

N.E. is the noble chateau of Vaux-Praslin, built by Fouquet, the ‘ surintendant de finances ’ under Mazarin, famous for the fete which he gave here to Louis XIV. Louis VII. was buried, 1180, at the abbey of Barbeaitx , near Melun, which he had founded. 1 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. 59 k. Fontainebleau. [The town is 3k. from the station. Omnibus, 30c. Hotels: dc France ci d'Anglelerre — very good, but dear; de Londres ; dc l Europe. Carriages: 2 horses- 1st h„ 4 fr. ; 2nd h., 3 fr. ; 1 horse— 1st h., 3 fr. ; 2nd h., 2 fr. : by the day— 2 horses, 20 fr. ; 1 horse, 10 fr.] The first king of France who made a residence here CHATEAU DE VAUX-PKASLIN. was Louis le Jeune, who dated his acts of 1137 and 1141, ‘ apud fontem Bleaudi.’ But the golden age of Fontaine- bleau began with the Renaissance, and with Francois I., who wished to make its palace the most glorious in the world. His buildings, decorated by the best Italian workmen of the time, were magnificently continued under Henri IV., and the succeeding kings. The facilities which FONTAINE /ILEA U. 3 Fontainebleau afforded for hunting, made it a favourite resort of royalty, and Louis XIII. was born in the chateau. Early in the reign of Louis XIV., the palace was lent to Christina, ex-Queen of Sweden, and became the scene of the murder of her secretary, Monaldeschi. Napoleon I. made Fontainebleau the residence of Pius VII., when CHATEAU DE FONTAINEBLEAU. he came for the emperor’s coronation ; and it was here that, Jan. 25, 1810, the Pope was induced to sign the famous Concordat, by which he abjured his temporal sovereignty. Here also Napoleon I. made his false abdication, and, in the courtyard in front of the palace, took his touching farewell of the soldiers of the Vieille Garde. 4 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. The interior of the chateau is shown daily from 1 1 to 4. It is entered from the Cour du Cheval Blanc. The most interesting portions are the Chapelle de la Sainte Trinite (Francois I.), where Louis XV. was married to Marie Leczinska; the Appartements de Napoleon I., including the ‘Cabinet de 1’Abdication the Boudoir de Marie Antoinette, with metal-work wrought by Louis XVI. ; the Chambre a Coucher de la Reine, inhabited in turn by five queens named Marie ; the Galerie de Diane (Napoleon I.) ; the Salon de Francois /., with a chimney-piece of his date; the glorious Galerie d' Henri II., built by Francois I., but decorated by Henri II. ; the Chapelle S. Saturnin (Francois I.) ; and the Galerie de Francois /., with paintings by II Rosso and Primaticcio. The Gardens, laid out by Le Notre, have much of stately old-world magnificence. The Etang remains near which Louis XIV. used to dance with ‘ Madame ’ (Henrietta, daughter of Charles I. of England), filled with carp of great age. The drives in the Forest are full of beauty and variety, especially where great moss-grown rocks are mingled with the old oaks ; perhaps the finest points are the Gorges d' Apremont and the Gorge aux Loups. 67k. Morct (Hotel: du Commerce), a very pretty and curious old town, where the kings of France had a chateau, of which the chief tower remains, dating from Louis le Gros (1128). Henri IV. gave it to one of his mistresses, Jacqueline de Bueil, with the title of Comtesse de Moret. At either end of the principal street is a fine old gothic gateway, relic of the fortifications of Charles VII. (1420), and one of these rises most picturesquely at the extremity of the bridge of fourteen arches over the MO RET. 3 Loing. The Church , built by Louis le Jeune, and con- secrated by Thomas & Becket in 1166, only retains a choir of that date. The triple nave and the transepts, with mullioned windows taking all the surface of the gabled wall, are xm. c. : the graceful little tower, xv. c. ; the principal portal, xvi. c. ‘ Les parties paralleles du choeur de cette eglise possedaient MORET. une galcrie de premier etage ou triforium voiite au-dessus des ailes ; mais l’abside, semi-circulaire, sans collateraux, possede, au-dessus d’un rang de fenetres basses, un triforium dont la composition originale nous montre une suite de lunettes ou roses sans meneaux, entre lesquelles est menage un passage- Les details de cette partie de leglise sont du meilleur style des premieres amities du xiii. siecle.’ — Viollct le Due. S. of the church is a timbered House of xv. c., and a 6 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. little Hospice , where the nuns make excellent barley-sugar. In the main street a renaissance House is inscribed ‘Concordia res parvae crescunt, 1618.’ [The Chemin de Fer du Bourbonnais branches off at Moret to Nevers, etc. See ch. ii.] 79 k. Montereau-Fault- Yonne (omnibus, 20 c. ; Hotel : du Grand-Monarque). The old French name of this place marks its position at the point where the Yonne falls {fault = finit) into the Seine. On the site of the Roman Condatum, a monastery was founded here in the first years of Christianity, and a fortified town rose around it. In 1419 the old bridge over the Yonne (rebuilt), which was fortified by gateways and defended by a drawbridge, was the scene of the murder of Jean sans Peur, Due de Bourgogne, by the advice of Tannegui Duchatel and other followers of the Dauphin (afterwards Charles Y1I.), who had a personal dread of the results of a reconciliation between him and their master. ‘ Vers les trois heures de l’apres-midi, le due descendit au chateau de Montereau, et, laissant ses gens d’armes a la porte qni regardait la ville, il s’avansa, suivi de neuf seigneurs et d'un secretaire, sur le pont oil l'attendait le dauphin. Le due et ses compagnons, suivant les conventions arretdes, ne portaient que la cotte et l’epec. Jean sans Peur cn fit l’observation a Tannegui Duchatel et a un autre Dauphinois, qui le vinrent recevoir aux barrieres avec des haches a leur ceinture; ndanmoins il passa outre, en frappant sur l’epaule de Tannegui et disant a sa suite: “ Veez-ci en qui je me fie!” — “ Vous avez bien tarde!” repondirent les Dauphinois ; et ils l’introduisirent preripitainment dans la loge, lui et le seigneur de Noailles, un des freres du comte de Foix. Les autres seigneurs boqrguignons dtaient un peu en arriere. ' Les barrieres furent renfermees derriere eux. Ce qui se passa ensuite a etO rapportd tres diversement par les deux partis. Monte re A u-fa ui. t- yonne. 7 Suivant les Bourguignons, le due aborda le dauphin en otant son aumusse (chaperon a longues bandes) de velours noir et en flechissant le genou : “ Monseigneur,” lui dit-il, “je suis venu a votre mandement. Vous savez la desolation de ce royaume, votre domaine *t venir ; entendez h la reparation d’icclui. Quant a moi, je suis pret d’y exposer le corps et les biens de moi et de mes vassaux, sujets et allies.” — “ Beau cousin,” repliqua le dauphin, “vous dites si bien que Ton ne pourrait mieux ; levez- vous et vous couvrez.” ‘ Un signe fut alors, dit-on, echange entre le dauphin et Tannegui, qui s’ecria : “ II est temps ! ” Et, a l'instant oil le due se releva, Tannegui “ le ferit si roidement d’une hache parmi le visage que le due chut a genoux.” Le due mit la main a son epee et fit un effort pour se relever ; mais le vicomte de Narbonne et les autres chevaliers du dauphin, qui etaient tons “ armes a blanc” sous leurs robes, se ruerent sur Jean et l’abattirent a terre comme mort. Un nomine Olivier Layet l'acheva en lui “ boutant une epee par-dessous son haubergeon tout dedans le ventre.” Le sire de Noailles tomba au meme instant, la tete fendue par derriere d’un coup de hache. Les autres Bourguignons accoururent trop tard: les soldats dauphinois, embarques pres de l’extremite du pont donnant sur la ville, s’etaient elances en foule par la barriere demeuree ouverte de ce cote, tandis que l’autre barriere, du cote du chateau, avait ete fermee, suivant les conventions, pour empecher les gens d’armes bourguignons d'avancer. Un seul des dix compagnons du due Jean sechappa ; tous les autres furent tues ou pris. Quant au dauphin, il avait ete emmene par le president Louvet des le commencement du tumulte. 1 Ainsi finit Jean sans Peur, par une trahison aussi noire que celle dont il avait lui-meme donn6 l’exemple, douze ans aupa- ravant, envers le due d’Orleans. Les consequences en devaient etre plus terribles encore ; chacun des grands forfaits qui se succedaient periodiquement depuis l’avenement de Charles VI. enfon^ait la France plus avant dans l’abime: la France venait d’etre assassinee, pour ainsi dire, avec le due de Bourgogne ! ’ — Martin , ‘ Hist, de France.' The Church , formerly collegiate, has five naves without 8 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. transepts, and a circular E. end with three radiating chapels : the facade and tower are renaissance. Between the xvm. c. bridges over the Seine and Yonne is an equestrian statue of Napoleon I., with two reliefs on the pedestal represent- ing the victory which he gained at Montereau over the Wiirtemberg troops. [There is an omnibus (i fr. 25 c.) to the old walled town of Voulx, 12 k. distant.] [A branch line of 30 k. connects Montereau with Flamboin, on the line from Paris to Troyes.] 90 k. Villeneuve-la-Guyard, has a xvi. c. church con- taining good wood-carving. At 9 k. distant is Villethierry , where the church, much altered, dates from xii. c. 95 k. Chavipigny , has a church of xii. c. and xvi. c. In the neighbouring village of Chaumont are remains of a priory of xii. c. 102 k . Pont-sur- Yonne (Hotel: de la Marine ), has a beautiful xm. c. church of three naves, with an admirable xiii. c. statue of the Virgin at the portal. It contains pictures by Parocel , ob. 1715. A house in the Rue du Chateau, flanked by tourelles, was once part of a fortress. Near this, at a spot called Hauts-Bords, is a fine dolmen. 1 k. distant are the remains of La Cour Notre Dame, a priory of the order of Citeaux, xm. c., with a noble rose-window at the chevet, and a beautiful xvi. c. portal : in the garden of the priory is a tall menhir. 14 k. in this direction is Bray-sur-Seine. The road thither passes the farm of Sixte, formed from an ancient priory of xvi. c. ; and runs a little to the r. of Scrbonnes, with a xvi. c. church (whence, from a house on the 1. of the Place, came Jacques Clement, the assassin of Henri III.), and by (5 k.) Sergines, which has a xvi. c. church with fine xvm.c SENS. 9 screens and two benitiers of xn. c. Here, remains of a Roman road — Chemin Perre- — are to be seen. / 113k. Sens (Hotel: de VEcu — excellent, close to the Cathedral ; de Paris). The ancient city of Sens was, before the Roman dominion, the capital of the Senones, and was called Agendicum. Its walls were rebuilt by the Romans, who adorned it with many fine buildings. The inhabitants were early converted to Christianity by SS. Savinien and Potentien, who suffered martyrdom here. In 615 S. Loup is said to have miraculously put to flight the troops of Thierry, who were besieging the town. The remembrance of these especial mercies is supposed to have made the population ultra-Catholic in 1562, when they massacred all the Protestants within the walls ; and Sens was one of the first towns in France to espouse the cause of the Ligue. Natives of Sens are called Senonais. The archiepiscopal Cathedral of S. Atienne is said to have its origin in a little sanctuary which S. Savinien founded on the ruins of a pagan temple in the hi. c. The actual build- ing is due to Archbishops Henri de France (1122-43) and Hugues de Toucy (1143-68), and is consequently very interesting from its date : the choir much resembles that of Canterbury, rebuilt by William of Sens in 1175. The most ancient part of the church is the little N. apse chapel. The facade and vaulting were much altered in the xm. c. ; the chapels round the choir were built in xiv. c. ; and transepts in xv. c. or xvi. c. In its main building, except the Cathedral of S. Denis, that of Sens may be looked upon as the earliest gothic monument in France.1 1 Felix de Verneilh, Annales A rchcologiques xxiii., 128. IO SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. The vast central portal of the facade is richly adorned with statues : on the central pillar is a striking figure of S. Etienne, holding a book, and in the tympanum his story. The three colossal statues near the summit of the facade are modern ; a little above the smaller portal on r. are faint remains of an equestrian statue of Philippe-Auguste. The tower, which fell in 1267, was only rebuilt in xvi. c. : of its once famous ancient bells, only two remain — Savinienne and Potentienne , of 1560. On the basement of the 1. portal are much-injured reliefs of Liberality and Avarice ; the latter represented as a woman, with disordered hair, seated on a coffer. The cathedral is so hemmed in by- houses that very little of the exterior can be well seen. A picturesque renaissance porch leads through the court of the archiepiscopal palace to the beautiful portal of the S. transept. The front of the N. transept is covered with flamboyant tracery. The interior is magnificent, entirely pointed, except the wall-arcading of the nave. The central nave is of great width. The windows contain a great deal of fine stained glass of xii. c. to xvi. c. That (in the choir aisle) representing the Sibyl consulted by Augustus, is said to have been designed by 1 ,uca Penni, brother of Francesco. The legend of S. Eutrope is by Jean Cousin. In the windows of the S. transept the story of Thomas a Becket is told,1 and there is a picture of the murder opposite the entrance to the sacristy. The high altar and its bal- dacchino are by Servandoni, 1742. Between the nave and its 1. aisle is a beautiful gothic altar, with statues of the Virgin and S. Stephen. The chapel of the Virgin (r. of choir, xv. c.) contains a good statue of the Virgin of 1334 ; 1 As at Chartres and S. Ouen. SEJVS. i r the E. chapel has a representation of the martyrdom of the first bishop, S. Savinien. In the adjoining chapel of S. Colombe (late xvi. c.) is the tomb of the Dauphin, son of Louis XV., and his wife the austere Marie Josephe de Saxe, considered to be a masterpiece of Guillaume Coustou. The same chapel contains two reliefs, which are the only remains of the tomb of Cardinal Archbishop Duprat, Chancellor of France, destroyed at the Revolution. The kneeling figures on either side of this are those of Cardinal Jacques Duperron and his brother Jean Duperron, both Archbishops of Sens. On the r. of the choir is a very picturesque staircase, and a door with curious ironwork. This forms the entrance to the Treasury , a vaulted hall with a barrel roof, containing the interesting episcopal robes of Thomas & Becket, and his very low mitre ; the episcopal robe of S. Ebbon (vm. c.) ; the head of S. Savigny, first Bishop of Sens ; the ring of S. Loup, Bishop of Sens (there was another of Troyes), and the curious ivory comb which he used in holding back the hair of candidates for ordina- tion, when it was cut off ; the ring of Gregory XI., pre- viously Bishop of Sens ; the very curious reliquary with the body of S. Colombe ; a splendid ivory reliquary of the hi. c., brought from the East in the Crusades; magnificent old tapestries which belonged to the Cardinal de Bourbon ; a beautiful ivory Christ, by Girardon ; and the coronation robe of Charles X., brought hither to be placed on the tomb of his father the Dauphin, during his commemoration service. In this cathedral S. Louis was married to Marguerite de Provence in 1234 ; and, five years later, the king and 12 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. his brother, Robert d’Artois, brought hither the crown of thorns, afterwards taken to the Sainte Chapelle at Paris. The Archiepiscopal Palace , built by Cardinal Louis de Bourbon, in 1557, is a very striking building; all its details are classical, but most harmonious. ‘ The upper pilasters cannot be dispensed with, if the lower range is to be employed, which seems an indispensable part of the arcaded forms below ; and the way in which their lines are carried through a console, gives them all the continuity of a buttress, with more than its usual grace.’ — Fergusson. To the r. of the Cathedral and Palace is the Salle Sy nodale, called L' Official ite, built 1240; much injured by the fall of the cathedral tower in 1267, and recently restored to its primitive state by Viollet le Due. ‘ Le rez-de-chaussee, bati sur caves, est voute sur une epine de colonnes et contient les salles de l’officialite et les prisons. Une entree carrossable passe sous l’extremitd septeutrionale de cette salle, et un large escalier partant de ce passage conduit a la salle du premier etage ou salle synodale, un magnificent vaisseau on l'on peut reunir facilement huit a neuf cents per- sonnes. Du cotd de la place, des contre-forts sont couronnds par des pinnacles tres-riches, varies, surmontant des statues, parmi lesquelles on distingue celle du roi Saint-Louis, la settle peut-etre qu’il y ait encore en France de son temps. La sculp- ture de la salle synodale de Sens peut etre comptee parmi les meillcurcs de cette epoque. Les profiles, les details, sont traites evidemment par un maitre, et aucun edifice ne presente un fenestrage mieux C0119U et d’un aspect plus grandiose.”’ — Viollet le Due. In the Hotel de Ville is a precious picture, one of the only two authentic known works of Jean Cousin, repre- senting ‘ Eve, la premibre Bandore.’ SENS. 13 The Church of S. Pierre le Rond , in the centre of the town, dates from xm. c., but has been altered xv. c. and xvi. c. ; it has some good stained glass. The chapel of the hospital, or Church of S. Jean, is xm. c., altered in xvu. c. : the choir, of the earlier period, is surrounded by an open gallery, passing behind the piers of the vaulting and in front of the triple windows. The entrance to the Halle is xm. c. S. Maurice, a quaint half-timbered church, on the island in the Yonne, dates from xn. c. to xvi. c., and contains the relics of SS. Fort, Guinefort, and Aveline. AA. Savinien and Potentien, at the end of the faubourg of that name, is a fine church, said to have been founded by the saints in in. c., rebuilt v. c., and restored xi. c. : the crypt is of 1001 : the altar is affirmed to be that upon which S. Savinien was celebrating at the moment of his martyrdom. Amid tufted trees, on a vine-covered hill, r. of the railway station, is a chapel whither S. Bond is said to have retired in the vii. c. ; it was formerly a great point of pilgrimage. On the r. bank of the Yonne, a little N. of the town, is the abbey of A. Colombe (a Gaulish virgin martyred by command of Aurelian), founded by Clotaire II. in 620, and originally embracing a monastery, palace, and castle, surrounded by walls and towers. Of the ancient buildings only some outer wall^, the xm. c. refectory, and a crypt remain. A church has been rebuilt here for the Soeurs de la Sainte Enfance. Thomas k Becket resided for several months at S. Colombe, where a plain stone, inscribed ‘ Rodolphus Rex,’ used to mark the grave of King Raoul, 936. The banks of the Yonne, near Sens, are very pretty, and the landscape artist will find good subjects towards evening 14 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. in the grey cathedral and old houses rising beyond the trees on the still reaches of the river. ‘ The Yonne, bending gracefully, link after link, through a never-ending rustle of poplar trees, beneath lovely vine-clad hills, with relics of delicate woodland here and there, sometimes close at hand, sometimes leaving an interval of broad meadow, has all the lightsome character of French riverside scenery on a smaller scale than usual, and might pass for the child’s fancy of a river, SENS. like the rivers of die old miniature painters, blue, and full to a fair green margin.' — Walter Pater. Sens may well be made headquarters for several excur- sions by rail and road — to Moret, Villeneuve-sur-Yonne, Fleurigny, etc. The last is a pleasant afternoon drive. [A road of 43 k. leads from Sens to Nogcnt-sur-Seine, passing — 2 k. S'. Clement. The church is xm. c. On 1. of road Popelin has an ancient lazar house, restored xvi. c., and now a farm- house.

A staircase ascends to the N. portal of the Church , which is partly xv. c. gothic, partly xvi. c. renaissance. Four windows, dated 1528, have rich glass and sculptures. There is a very fine renaissance jubi , and behind the high-altar a remarkable S. Sepulcre, with delicate bas-reliefs of the Passion, surrounding a relief of the Resurrection. The stained glass window, to r. of this, represents the life of S. Florentin. Opposite the staircase leading to the church is the Hotel-Dieu. fit is a drive of 28 k. from S. Florentin to Auxerre, by (8 k.) the famous Cistercian Abbey of Pontigny (carriages to Pontigny, 5 fr., opposite S. Florentin station), founded by Hugues de Macon in 1 1 14, being one of the four daughters of Citeaux and itself the mother of forty-five other abbeys of the order in France, Italy, Poland, and England. Thomas & Becket took refuge here in 1164-66, and here, whilst kneeling in the church before one of the altars, had a vision of the Saviour, Who said to him, ‘ Thomas, Thomas, my Church shall be glorified by thy blood.’ The recollection of the hospitality shown at Pontigny to 24 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. S. Thomas made later archbishops of Canterbury turn to its abbey as a refuge in time of trouble. Archbishop Stephen Langton and several English bishops took refuge here in 1208, when banished by John. Lastly S. Edme — Flos Angliae, decus Galliae — came hither in 1240, and remained for two years ; and though his death, in 1242, occurred at the Priory of Soisy-en-Brie, near Provins, his body was brought back to Pontigny in 1247, having been canonised (as one who had spent his life in a contest for the spiritual against the temporal power) by Innocent IV. in 1245, only three years after his death. It would be difficult to say why, but there has always been an especial veneration for S. Edme amongst the people of Burgundy. After his exhumation at Soisy-en-Brie, at which S. Louis assisted in person, his body was enclosed in a shrine, which stood at Pontigny between the pillars of the sanctuary, and drew a ceaseless concourse of pilgrims to the abbey. Louis XI. came here in 1477 to pray by the shrine, and two years after, being unable to come himself, made the pilgrimage again by deputy, and at the same time pre- sented the abbey of Pontigny with a vineyard near Dijon — ‘ Afin que les religieux priassent Dieu, Notre Dame et S. Edme pour lui le roi, le dauphin et la reine, et meme pour la bonne disposition de notre estoniac, que ni vin ni viande ne nous puissent nuire, et que nous l’ayons toujours bien dispose.’ 1 The shrine of S. Edme was renewed in the xvn. c., and the devotion of the people has preserved it uninjured through many revolutions. The drive from S. Florentin to Auxerre is for the most part through forest, but Pontigny itself is in a bare, ugly situation. The huge Church of S. Ed?ne is surrounded by walls, except at the W. end, and has no external beauty. It was entirely built after 1 150 by Thibaut le Grand, Comte de Champagne, Blois, et Chartres. In 1568 and 1569 it was burnt, with the monastery, by the Huguenots, but it was restored 1615 and 1630, and exists almost entire. It is 108 met. long by 22 wide, and 21 high. ‘ Cet edifice est d’nne homogeneity parfaite, et semble Otre d’un seul jet. Les transsepts sont tres-devcloppes. La nef n'a pas de chapelles laterales, comme toutes les eglises de l’epoque, mais on cn trouve une sdrie complete bordant les bas cotes qui font le tour du choeur.’ — De Caumont. ' Lcboeuf. PONTIGNY. 25 The porch (xn. c.) is of the kind characteristic of Cistercian abbeys, three bays wide and two deep, occupying the width of the principal nave, and with two side halls for the service of the abbey. ‘ Des voutes d’arete sans nervures couvrent ce porche et viennent reposer sur deux colonnes. Une porte extyrieure correspond a la porte principale de la nef, et des deux cot6s s’ouvrent, sur un large et haut bahut, deux arcades divis6es par des colonnettes accoupl6es. Tout cet ensemble, y compris les deux salles, est couvert par un comble en appends avec demi- croupes aux deux extr6mit£s. Au-dessus du comble du porche est perc6e une 6norme fenetre dans le grand pignon ; elle ydaire la nef. A l’exterieur, la construction de ce porche est d’un aspect froid et triste. A l'intyrieur, les chapiteaux des colonnes sont orn6s de sculptures d’une simplicity toute puritaine, et le tympan de la porte de l’Cglise n’est d6core que d’une croix en relief.’ — Viollet le Due. The choir has the peculiarity of the radiating chapels being polygonal within and yet presenting a flat square face externally, with only the base of the flying buttresses projecting beyond the line of roof. The hundred stalls are xvn. c. The shrine of S. Edme, sustained by angels, rises behind the choir. A simple table tomb, with an abbatial cross engraved upon the lid, is that of the founder Hugues de Macon, friend and disciple of S. Bernard. Part of the cloisters exists on the N. of the church, and was restored xvm. c. A large vaulted building of two storeys remains from the monastic buildings. In the garden is a fountain with a great stone swan.] [There is a diligence (2 fr. 50c.) from S. Florentin to (25 k.) Chablis, passing (13 k.)

The church of Notre Dame, now disused, has a renaissance facade, three naves of xv. c. and xvi. c., and an apse of xm. c. The Hospital, founded by Marguerite de Bourgogne in 1293, has been rebuilt, except the Salle des Malades, which has been con- verted into a parish church, and contains the tomb of the famous Louvois (Seigneur of Tonnerre during the last years of his life) by Girardon and Desjardins, and that by Bridan, erected in 1826 to Marguerite de Bourgogne, Queen of Sicily, daughter of Duke Hugues, wife of Charles de Valois, brother of Philippe le Bel, and mother of Philippe VI. A the end of the nave, on the 1., a black marble slab covers the grave of Anne, Comtesse de Tonnerre, 1636. The vaulted timber roof is very curious, and its timbers of the most extraordinary size : it has long been a subject of dispute whether they are oak or chestnut. In the xiv. c. vaulted hall, called La Revest ilre, is a curious S. Sepulcre, of eight stone statues. At the foot of the hill rises the spring called La Fontaine de la Fosse Deonne. In the Hotel TONNERRE. 27 de Ville is a portrait of Marshal Davoust. The Hotel d'Uzts (Rue des Fontenilles) is one of the best of many old houses in Tonnerre. No. 21, Rue du Faubourg du Pont was, in 1728, the birthplace of the celebrated Chevalier d’Eon. It was at Tonnerre (in returning from Vichy) that the Duchesse d’Angouleme first heard of the revolution TONNERRE. which dethroned Charles X., and from the bridge of S. Nicolas she escaped in a carriage. Two nights should certainly be spent either at Tonnerre or Montbard to make the (exceedingly worth while) double excursion by rail to Tanlay and Ancy-Ie-Franc, which may be seen on the same day.

Tanlay , on the Arman^on, celebrated for its magnificent Chateau (i|k. 1. from the station), bought in 1 535 by the family of Coligny, and rebuilt in 1559 by Francois de Coligny d’Andelot. It was purchased under Louis XIV. by Michele Particelli, Sieur d’Emeri, Ministre des Finances, who partly rebuilt it, carefully preserving all its ancient Burgundian characteristics, and it afterwards came to his son-in-law, Louis Phdlippeaux, Due de la Vrilliere. In the latter part of the last century, it was purchased by the family of Thenuen, whose representa- tive at the time of the Great Revolution was saved from the guillotine by his cook, then secretary to Robespierre. CHATEAU DE TANLAY. 29 The present Marquis de Tanlay is his grandson. The chateau is approached from the station by a noble lime avenue, which leads directly to Le Petit Chateau , an exquisite little building erected in 1610 by Jacques Chabot, Comte de Charny, but never quite finished. Its admirable design and rich frieze are amongst the best works of the time, and the orange colour of the stone of which it is built TANLAY. LE PETIT CHATEAU. adds to its effect. The Petit Chateau serves as a gatehouse to the green lawns in front of the great chateau, which stands at right angles to it, and is approached by a bridge across a moat, flanked by two obelisks, and leading to the lofty Portail-Neuf behind which is the Cour d’Honneur, decorated with fine orange-trees, and surrounded on three sides by the main buildings, of which the r. wing ends in the tower of the chapel (1648), and the 1. wing in the Tour des Archives. These lowers rise directly from 30 SOUTH-EASTERN ERANCE. the moat. The facade towards the gardens is of the time of Francois de Coligny. The tower on the r. is called the Tour de la I.igue, because there Coligny and the Prince de Conde used to hold counsel during the wars of religion : the curious circular upper room in which they met is covered with mythological frescoes in the style of Pri- maticcio. Beyond this, the interior does not contain anything of special interest, but is one of the noblest specimens in France of a well-kept country house, in the TANLAY.

The rooms contain some old tapestry, and several of them have stately stone chimney-pieces, the handsomest, adorned with statuettes and caryatides, being in the Chambre de l’Archeveque. English visitors will always be struck with the small number of servants considered quite sufficient, and found quite efficient, in these grand French country-palaces. 21 1 k.

Ancy-le-Franc (Hotel : de la Poste). iik. 1., on the opposite bank of the Armangon, is the magnificent chateau of the Due de Clermont-Tonnerre. It was begun by Primaticcio in 1546, and continued by Serlio, the two great Italians imported for Fontainebleau by Frangois I., and employed here by the Comte de Clermont, Grand Master of the Woods and Forests of France and afterwards Constable ANCY-LE-FRAN’C. ofDauphin£. The walls were not finished till 1622. In 1683 the Comte Frangois-Joseph de Clermont sold the chateau to the Marquis de I.ouvois ; but since the Revolution, in which the precious contents of the building were greatly injured, it has been re-purchased by the family of its ancient possessors, and it is gradually being restored with the utmost taste and care The interior of Ancy-le-Franc is shown in the absence of the family. The enormous square mass and regular 32 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. forms of the building, enclosing a great courtyard, are those of a palace. The Galerie des Sacrifices, and the Galerie des Batailles de Cesar et Pompee , are covered with frescoes in grisaille, the latter admirable. The chapel is surrounded by frescoes representing the life of the Hermits in the Desert, beneath which are apostles and prophets. The Salle des Gardes, used as a theatre by the Louvois, retains its ancient wall-paintings of fleurs-de-lis, and the broken chimney-piece, whose heraldic decorations excited the fury of the Revolu- tionists. The Chambre des Fleurs is covered with beautiful paintings of flowers. The Chambre des Arts has repre- sentative frescoes : under the Louvois this was called the Chambre de Richelieu, but his portrait has been removed to show the earlier allegorical picture beneath : ‘ Urit, nequidem non consumitl The Galleries of Judith and Jason are named from their frescoes. The duke’s private room has admirable early decorations. But perhaps the best chamber of all is that covered with frescoes of the story of Pyramis and Thisbe, attributed to Niccolo Abbate. The Salon des Rois, used by Louis XIV., is in the style of Fontainebleau. All these rooms are on the first floor. On the ground floor are the Salle des Empereurs, and another room with admirable mythological frescoes, by Primaticcio or his pupils. 225 k. Nuits-sous-Ravieres, has an old gateway defended by a barbican and drawbridge.

Vassy, with a chateau of xvn. c., two towers of xvn. c. ; and (25 k.) Montreal , on a hill which once bore a castle used as a residence by Queen Brunehaut, who has left her name to a causeway connecting the bridge of Montreal with the ruined castle of Monte Ion (xvi. c.). Only some outer walls and two gates (xm. c.) remain of the chateau of Montreal. The small but important early gothic xii. c. and xm. c. church has a very peculiar rose window, one of the two earliest in France, and a W. front which is only decorated by a wide portal of very great beauty, with the rich corbels which are a characteristic of Burgundian churches. In the interior is the very rare incident of a stone tribune above the entrance, with its altar still in place. It is reached by two stone staircases from the side aisles, and rests on a monolith column, and a bracket composed in four tiers of great stones. It is supposed that this tribune was intended for the lord of the manor, whose chateau is to be seen in ruins close to the church. The tribune adds to the size of the church, which is very small and ends in a square apse, with a transept and two little chapels. Some of the windows are decorated with rich designs in the lead work, figures in colour or sculpture not being admitted in Cistercian churches. The stalls and pulpit are good xvi. c. work. In the churchyard are flat tombstones with a flat cross and a little benitier attached to the gable at the foot. The village contains several xv. c. houses. In the courtyard of one of them is an interesting Well, circular internally, octagonal externally, with two pillars supporting a stone bar, inscribed, ‘Johan de Brie m'a fait faire en l’an 1526.’ 3 34 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. 9 k. from Vassy, in the direction of Semur, is Chdtcl-Gerard with a fortified xvi. c. house. 2 k. hence is the menhir called La Femme Blanche , and 3 k. the old priory of Val-des-Choux (xv. c.) with tombs of the Anserics de Montreal.] The country becomes very hilly before reaching — 243 k. Montbard (Hotel : de rAcu — good and clean, though primitive), a pretty little town, below and on the side of a wooded hill crowned by an old tower, which is all that remains of the castle, pulled down by the naturalist Buffon (Georges-Louis Lecierc), a native of Montbard, when he purchased the property in 1742.

On the side of Mont-Auxois , about half-an-hour’s walk from the station, is the village of Alise- Sainte-Reine, which owes its first name to the Gaulish Alesia, and its second to a Roman girl martyred 252 by the governor Olibrius, in his fury at her refusal to marry him. A procession in her honour still annually ascends the hill on her festival of Sept. 7. The village is divided into two parts — A. Reine, which contains a hospital, founded xvii. c. at instigation of S. Vincent de Paul, and rich in the right arm of the saint and in la Fontaine Miraculeuse , said to have risen where she was beheaded. The second half of the village is on the height once occupied by Alesia, the fortress which the Gauls considered impregnable, and where Vercingetorix, besieged by Caesar, made his last resistance, and was forced to surrender. The plateau of the hill is covered with cultivated fields, but surrounded on all sides by rocky buttresses interspersed with natural wood. 1 Le mont d'Alesia presente un immense bastion naturel dominant un large horizon. La montagne est entour£e de trois cotes par dcs vallees profondes, qui la separent des hauteurs voisines ; du quatrieme cote, line plaine d’une lieue de long setend entre les racines du mont ct la riviere de Brenne ; deux autres petites rivieres, la Loye et l’Ozerain, coulent a droitc et a gauche de la montagne et vont se jeter a la Brenne. L’antique cite des Gaels couvrait tout le plateau calcaire qui forme le ALESIA. 37 couronnement de la montagne. Le camp de Vercingetorix, fortifie d’un fosse et d’un mur en pierres seches de six pieds de haut, occupait le versant oriental au-dessous de la ville et au-dessus du vallon de la Loye. Cesar assit son camp du cote oppose, sur une hauteur en pente douce, s£paree du mont d’AIesia par le vallon d’ou sort l'Ozerain. ‘ Cesar se garda bien d’attaquer a force ouverte : il con?ut le gigantesque projet d’enfermcr a la fois la ville et l’armee gauloise dans une circonvallation de onze milles, protegee par vingt-trois forts. Vercingetorix tente de rompre la chaine dont son rival voulait l’enserrer. II insinue au coeur de ses chevaliers le desir de venger leur honneur, et les jeta dans la plaine. On combattit, dit Cesar, “avec une souveraine vigueur.” Les escadrons romains ployerent comine de coutume : les Germains arriv6rent a l’aide, suivis des legions. Le fatal ascendant des barbares du nord l’emporta de nouveau! . . .La cavalerie gauloise fut rejet6e en deroute jusqu’a son camp, avec une grande perte d’hommes et de chevaux. 1 Vercingetorix ne vit plus d’esperance que dans tin effort immense, universel, qui arracherait la Gaule h ses fondements pour la precipiter sur l'envahisseur. “ Partez,” dit-il aux chefs de sa cavalerie, “ tandis que les passages ne sont pas encore fermes ; retournez chacun dans votre nation ; levez tout ce qui peut tenir une arme, et revenez nous delivrer, mes freres et moi. J’ai des vivres pour trente jours, pour un peu plus, avec une epargne rigoureuse. Nous vous attendons.” ‘ La cavalerie passa, de nuit, entre les lignes inachevees de l’ennemi. Vercingetorix fit rentrer l’infanterie dans la ville. 1 Ce cri de detresse, cette grande voix de la patrie expirantc fut entendue. L’assemblee generale de la Gaule, a la hate reunie, recula devant l’idee colossale d’une levee en masse universelle, qu’elle se sentit impuissante & diriger et a nourrir ; mais elle fixa des contingents a tous les peuples gaulois. Tons repondirent d’un seul elan, d'un seul coeur. . . . ‘ La lutte supreme s’engagea par un combat de cavalerie dans la plaine, arene oil plongeaient, comme des degres d’un prodigieux amphitheatre, les regards des deux camps et de la ville. Les charges se succedent sans interruption et sans avantage decisif, depuis midi jusqu’au coucher du soleil. . . . 3« SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. Les Gaulois resterent immobiles toute la journtie du lendemain. Les g6n£raux de la grande armee changerent leur plan de l'at- taque. II y ’avait, au nord-est, entre la Loye et la Brienne, une colline que son vaste circuit n’avait pas permis d'enfermer dans les lignes roinaines. Cesar avait assis sur la pente douce de cette hauteur un petit camp de deux legions. Les chefs gaulois jugerent que, s’ils nhississaient a enlever cette position, les Remains ne pourraient plus tenir dans l’etroit vallon de la Loye, entre cette colline et le mur d’Alesia. Vergasillaun, parent de Vercingetorix, se mit a la tete de quarante-cinq mille homines, l’elite de l'arm6e, tourna la hauteur par une longue marche de nuit, s’embusqua sur le versant oppose, et tout a coup, vers midi, debouche au dessus du petit camp romain. En mcme temps, la cavalerie gauloise reparut dans la plaine, et le gros de l infanterie se deploya en avant du camp gaulois. ' Vercing6torix sort de la ville, et un double assaut, furieux, desespere commence. Des deux cotes, on sent que e’est l'heure supreme. L’attaque & ete mieux combinee cette fois. Cesar, planant d'un poste eleve sur tout le champ de bataille, voit de moment en moment ses formidables defenses entameesou eludees. Les pieges et les fosses qui protegent les abords du petit camp disparaissent sous les monceaux de terre que jettent devant eux les bataillons de Vergasillaun. Les Gaulois touchent au rem- part. Les deux legions s’gpuisent ; un renfort envoye par Cesar ne prolonge qua grand’ peine la resistance. Pendant ce temps, Vercing6torix, au lieu d’assaillir les gigantesques fortifications de la plaine, se porte contre la partie des lignes ou la nature es- carp6e du terrain n’a pas permis de si grands ouvrages. Son armee accable de traits les garrisons des tours romaines, se fraye un chemin a force de terre et de fascines, entame avec d’enormes faux le rempart et le revetement. Deux corps de troupes fraiches, depC-ches a l’aide, sont impuissants contre l’elan des assaillants. La journ6e semble aux Gaulois. • Cesar accourt avec la reserve. Le combat se retablit . VercingC-torix est repouss6. Cesar sort des lignes avec quel- que infanterie et toute sa cavalerie, et marche au secours du petit camp. II arrive sur la hauteur au moment ou, le fosse etant franchi et le rempart force, les deux legions du petit camp viennent de se masser en un seul corps avec les garrisons des ALESIA. 39 forts voisins pour se frayer une retraite lepee a la main. Les Romains se reportent en avant. Les Gaulois chargent : on s’aborde k l’arme blanclte. Tout-a-coup, les Gaulois aper^oivent derriere eux une partie de la cavalerie ennemie qui k tourn6 la eolline. La panique les saisit; assaillis en tete et en queue, ils se rompent. Vergasillaun est pris avec soixante-quatorze en- seignes. Le combat n’est plus qu’un massacre. A l'aspect des fuyards 6chapp6s au carnage, la masse de l’arm^e, d6ployee au loin sur les hauteurs, se d6bande dans toutes les directions et se dissout pour ne plus se r6unir. Toute cette grande arm6e s'6vanouit comme un rfive. ‘ Les d6fenseurs d’Alesia, delaisstis sans retour, rentrerent, aux approches de la nuit, dans 1’antique cit6 qui avait 6t& le berceau de la Gaule et qui allait en 6tre le tombeau. ‘ Le h6ros, le patriote n’avait plus rien k faire ici-bas ; la patrie 6tait perdue. L’homme pouvait encore quelque chose pour ses freres. II pouvait peut-etre encore les sauver de la mort et de la servitude personnelle. Cette pens6e fut la derniere consola- tion de cette grande ame. Le lendemain, Vercing6torix convoqua ses compagnons, et s’offrit a eux pour qu’ils satisfissent aux Romains par sa mort, ou qu’ils le livrassent vivant. II poussait le d^vouement jusqu’it renoncer it mourir. On envoya savoir la volont6 de Cesar. Le proconsul ordonna qu’on livrat les chefs et les armes, et vint sieger sur un tribunal 6lev6 entre les retranchements. 1 Tout-a-coup, un cavalier de haute taille, couvert d’armes splen- dides,mont6 sur un cheval magnifiquemcnt capara^onn^, arrive au galop droit au si6ge de Cesar. Vercing6torix s’^tait pare comme un victime pour le sacrifice. Sa brusque apparition, son imposant aspect, excite un mouvement de surprise et presque d’effroi. 11 fait tourner son cheval au cercle autour du tribunal de C6sar, saute a terre, jette ses armes aux pieds du vainqueur, “ et se tait.” ‘ Devant la majeste d’une telle infortune, les durs soldats de Rome se sentaient 6mus ; Cesar se montra au-dessous de sa prosp£rit6; il fut implacable envers l’homme qui Ini avait fait perdre un seul jour, le nom d'invinciblc.

CHATEAU OF BUSSY-RABUTIN. An excursion should be made, either from Les Laumes or Darcey (about 6 k.) to the Ckdteau of Bussy-Rabutin. The road follows the railway for some distance, and then turns up a pretty wooded valley to the village of Bussy-le- Grand, the native place of Junot, Due d’Abrantes. Beyond the village is a gateway on r., which seems to lead to some farm buildings. It does, in fact, form the entrance to a farm-yard, but is the only approach to the famous chateau, which lies very low, surrounded by a moat, and perfectly embosomed in verdure, especially grand old lime trees, which form an avenue opposite the principal front. So completely is it hidden, till you reach it, that it has the effect of a fairy -palace in the midst of the woods. BUSSY-RABUTIK 4i The original chateau was probably founded by Renaudin de Bussy in xn. c. It was rebuilt in xvii. c. on the plan of a vast parallelogram with towers at the angles. Those on the E. are connected with the principal buildings by wings with open arcades, of the time of Henri II. One of them contains the chapel. The main building is covered with rich arabesques sculptured in the yellow stone. The owner (Comte de Sarcus) seldom inhabits Bussy except in the height of summer ; the damp of the moat drives him away ; there is no sound but the song of the nightingales. A terrible sense of damp pervades the interior of tiie chateau ; it is like Mariana’s moated grange. The rooms shown are very curious, and little altered from the time when they were built. One of those on the ground floor is decorated with paintings of famous chateaux — the old Versailles, Sceaux, etc. The Salle des Devises is an interesting chamber, covered with paintings allegorical of the infidelity of Mme. de Monglat, the treacherous mistress for whom Roger de Rabutin, the famous Comte de Bussy, composed the Histoire amoureuse des Gattles, for which he was imprisoned for a year in the Bastile, and banished to his own property for seventeen years. He employed this period chiefly in the decoration of the chateau, in collecting the sixty-five portraits of famous warriors in the Salon des Homines de Guerre, and in the adornment of La Tour Dorec, a room containing a number of portraits representing Louis XIV., his family and court, many of them by Mignard and Lebrun. The shutters of this tower are painted with cupids and the poetical devices which served to amuse the solitude of Rabutin. ' Des qu’il est arrive en Bourgogne, au sortir de la Bastille, il a fait venir de Dijon, et meme de Paris, des artistes de tout genre, surtout des architectes et des peintres, et il s’est mis h embellir ses salons. Les salons, voila ce qu’on aimait le mieux au xvii”' siecle, ce qui rappellait ces moments les plus heureux de la vie, ceux qu’on avait passes dans des reunions eharmantes ; an milieu de personnes aimables et de gens d’esprit ; en sorte que Le Notre, pour plaire a cette soctete mondaine, fit du pare de Versailles comme une reproduction du chateau lui-meme. La maniere dont Bussy a d£core sa maison nous fait bien voir 42 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. en quel etat d’esprit il Ctait alors et ce qui occupait toutes ses pensiies ; il se nourrissait de souvenirs et de regrets, il ne songeait qua ce monde s6duisant dont il 6tait banni, il voulait a tout prix en avoir une image devant les yeux. Plusieurs pieces sont ornees d’emblemes et d’allegories qui se rapportent presque toutes a sa maitresse, la belle marquise de Montglas ; Bussy, qui l'accusait de l’avoir abandonne dans son malheur, qui la faisait representer plus I6gere que le vent, plus changeantc que la lime, plus fugitive que l’hirondelle, montre bien, par l’acharne- ment meme qu'il met k la poursuivre, qu'il l'aimait toujours. Dans un de ses salons, il a r6uni les portraits des grands capitaines de son temps etjs’est mis sans fa^on en leur compagnie. Ailleurs il a fait peindre toutes les femmes qu’il a fr6quent6es, avec des inscriptions qui sont souvent des 6pigrammes. Il lui semblait sans doute qu'il n'avait pas tout it fait quitte Paris et Versailles, quand il retrouvait autour de lui toutes ces figures de connais- sance qui lui rappelaient ses plus heureuses ann<5es. Il se faisait illusion en les regardant, et il oubliait un moment son exil.' — Gaston Boissier, ‘ Mme. de Sevigne.' The charming chambers inhabited by Madame de Sevigne during her visits to Rabutin, who was her cousin, and to whom many of her published letters are addressed, are full of contem- porary portraits, amongst them those of Mesdames de Sevigne and de Grignan, and of the wife of Roger de Rabutin. Amongst the pictures is that of ‘ Isabelle C6cile, Marquise de Monglas, qui par la conjoncture de son inconstance a remis en honneur la matrone d’£phese.’ In the Chapel are two pictures by Poussin. The gardens are attributed to Le Notre. [For the branch line from Les Laumes to Avallon and Auxerre see ch. iii.

Flavigny (13 k.) is a town perched on a rock almost precipitous on three sides, and which has stood many sieges. It has two gates of xiv. c., one of them (close to the Dominican convent) of considerable interest. ‘ Cette porte est flanqu^e de tours cylindriques percees de meurtrieres & la base, a mi-hauteur et au sommet. Ces meurtrieres, faites pour de tres-petites bouches a feu, sont circulaires. La porte elle-m6me, ainsi que sa potence, est sur- mont€e d’un machicoulis avec parapet, perc6 6galement de meurtrieres circulaires. Cet ouvrage precede une porte de xivc siecle, en partie demolie aujourd’hui, et qui 6tait fermde par une herse et des vantaux.’ — Viollct Ic Due. Many houses are of xm. c., xv. c., and xvi. c. On the first floor of one of the former is an interesting example of a stone window bench, separated into two stalls by an arm projecting from the mullion. Others have curious examples of old corbelled water pipes under their roofs. In the centre of the town stands the parish church, portions of which date from the xm. c. At the cross of the transept is a square tower of xvi. e., with a low spire. Above the aisles is a stone gallery, forming almost a second church, and continued across the first and last bays ol the nave. At the latter it forms a jube, with a lovely interlaced parapet and projecting stone pulpit, used as an ambon for the gospel.1 From the gallery, fringed arches and pierced parapets open above the chapels of the nave. There are some ruins of another church of xm. c., and of an abbey of vni.c.

Dijon (Omnibus, 30c. Hotels: de la Cloche — quite first-rate ; de Bourgogne Goisset ; du Jura — near the DIJON. 45 station), the old capital of Burgundy, now chief town of the Departement de la Cote d’Or. The town takes its name from the Castrum Divionense, which Caesar established after the conquest of Gaul. The inhabitants were converted to Christianity by S. Benigne, who suffered martyrdom here in 178. Constan- tine gave the city to S. Urbain, Bishop of Tours. In the xi. c. King Robert bought it, and made it the capital of the Duchy of Burgundy, which passed to his second son, Robert, first duke of the first royal race, of which there were twelve dukes, under whom the city was in constant peace and prosperity. On the death of the last of these, Burgundy was reunited to the crown under King Jean. Then it became the appanage of his fourth son, Philippe le Hardi, first duke of the second royal race, which only numbered four — Philippe le Hardi, Jean sans Peur, Philippe le Bon, and Charles le Temeraire, who was killed, in 1476, before the walls of Nancy. Louis XI., who now took possession of Burgundy, transported to Dijon the parliament, which had previously sat at Beaune and S. Laurent-lbs-Chalon. He fortified the town, which was soon after besieged by a Swiss and German army. Later, Francois I., a prisoner at Madrid, ceded Burgundy to Charles V. as his ransom, but the States refused to accept a master who was not of their own choice, and the convention was never executed. The most prosperous time of Dijon was the xvm. c., when, as capital of Burgundy, the States-General of the province met there every three years, and it was the seat of a parliament, of a bishopric created in 1731, and of a military governor; but the follies of the great Revolution destroyed many of the towers and churches, and mutilated 46 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. the other monuments of Uijon ; it has never since been of any importance ; it also suffered severely during the German invasion of 1870-71. The following is the best course to be followed in a cursory visit to Dijon. Passing the corner of the Public Gardens, laid out by Le Notre, the Rue Docteur Maret leads r. to the Cathedral (formerly the abbey church) of S. Benigne, which, having its origin in a shrine over the tomb of the martyred apostle of Burgundy, was rebuilt in vi. c., in ix. c., in 1016, in 1280, and has been much altered since. Of the church built in vi. c. by Gregoire, Bishop of Langres, we may still discover in the lower stage of the circular chapel, behind the apse, a building which was of three storeys, including the crypt.1 In the xi. c. a much larger circular chapel was built by Abbot Guillaume for the benefit of pilgrims, and surrounded by two stages of galleries. It was united on the first floor to the church, which itself terminated in a chapel flanked by massive round towers, containing staircases leading up to the galleries above the shrine and down to the crypt. This precious architectural monument is now destroyed with the excep- tion of the Crypt, which was the martyrium, or burial-place of S. Benigne. In the crypt are preserved some fragments of the earlier chapel of vi. c., including a capital of interlaced monsters of Indian quaintness, and the crypt of xi. c. is itself a monument unique in France. The tomb of the saint was in a chapel at the entrance of the rotonda, and beyond the rotonda was a chapel of S. John Baptist, dating from the vi. c. All the crypt, the chapel, and rotonda were vaulted in ashlar work, except the centre of the rotonda, 1 Don Plancher, Hist, dc Bourgogne. DIJON. 47 which was open, so that the processions of pilgrims, wind- ing round the two storeys of galleries above, might look down into the shrine. 1 On peut considerer la erypte de S. Benigne comme la plus vaste de cryptes connues. Ce monument si remarquable fut vendu pour le prix des materiaux, a la fin du dernier siecle, par la commune de Dijon. Les entrepreneurs jugerent que les pierres de la erypte ne valaient pas les peines qu’il faudrait prendre pour les enlever, et cette erypte nous est restee a pen pres entiere.’ — Viollet le Due. The only other relic of the church of xi. c. is the portal, altered, and adorned with a martyrdom of S. Etienne by Bouchardon : it is surmounted by an open gallery of gothic arches, and flanked by octangular towers. The low spire is of 1742. The balustrade of the transept chapels has the peculiarity of being decorated upon the flat surface, as is frequently the case in Burgundy, where the hardness of the stone made open- work difficult. In the interior is good stall work of xvm. c. from the abbey of La Eerte'- sur-Grosne. Near the W. end are tombs, with kneeling figures of the Sieur de la Benchere and his wife, 1631. Black marble slabs mark the spot to which the bodies of Philippe le Kardi and Jean sans Peur were removed from the Chartreuse in 1841. Against the wall of the S. aisle is, amongst others, the fine incised gravestone of Ladislas le Blanc, who was long a monk here, but was released from his vows by the anti-Pope Clement VII. of Avignon, that he might become king of Poland. Before he could take possession of the throne, however, Hedwige, daughter of Louis of Hungary, was preferred as queen by the electors, and Ladislas, dying miserably at Strasbourg in 1388, im- 48 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. plored to be buried in his old abbey, where an anniversary, called that of ‘ Le roi Lancelot ’ (corruption of Ladislas) was long celebrated. The poet Tabourot des Accords, 1590, is also buried here. The Eveche , formerly the abbot’s palace, was rebuilt xvm. c. Close to the S. side of the cathedral is the church of .S. Philibert , now used as a barn, but a remarkable building of xii. c. It has a beautiful many-sided tower, with a crocketed stone spire. The Rue S. Etienne leads E. to the Place S. Jean. The gothic church of S. Jean , which was consecrated in 1468, and where Bossuet was baptized, has a vaulted wooden roof. It is spoilt internally by polychrome, but contains the shrines of S. Urbain and S. Gr^goire. At No. 10, Place S. Jean, the great Jacques Benigne Bossuet was born, 1627. No. 4 was the hotel of the President, Charles de Brosses. To the S.E. is the classical domed church of 5. Anne , attached to an hospital of the name, built 1690 — 1708, and containing sculptures by Dubois and (in a side chapel) a good picture of the Communion of S. Catherine by Quantin. The Rue de la Liberte leads to the Hotel de Ville (xvm. c.), in the centre of the town, occupying the site of the palace of the dukes of Burgundy, of which nothing remains except the Tour de la Terrasse, 1419; the Tour de Brancion (called Tour de Bar, after Rene d’Anjou, Due de Lorraine, was imprisoned there upon his defeat at Bulgneville) ; the Salle des Gardes ; and the square kitchen of 1445, with a vault supported by eight columns, and a great well of xv. c. with a lion issuing from the wall as the support of its pulley. Fourteen halls of the DIJON. 49 hotel are now occupied by the Musk, open to the public on Sundays and holidays from 12 to 4, and on Thursdays from 12 to 3; daily to strangers. It contains a collection of far more interest than is usually found in provincial towns, arranged with great care and taste. The Salle des Gardes, which was the banqueting hall of the dukes, retains its magnificent chimney-piece. In any other country but France, where it is necessary to protect everything of national importance from the fickle populace, one would regret to find here, and not over their resting-places at S. Be'nigne, the splendid tombs of the dukes of Burgundy, formerly in the Chartreuse, an abbey founded by Philippe le Hardi, who employed all the best artists of the day in its decoration, and intended it for the burial-place of his family. He first made use of Jean de Menneville, a French sculptor, and when he died his work was continued under the Fleming Claus Sluter, who had hitherto worked under him. In 1393 Philippe gave this sculptor the title and position of ‘ valet de chambre,’ and, in 1404, he received from the monastery, where a room was awarded him, a large sum for a Crucifixion. In the same year he obtained the contract for his greatest work, the tomb of his deceased lord, in which he was assisted by his nephew, Claux de Werne, who continued the work after his death. 1 Raised above a socle and a base of black marble, is a mighty sarcophagus, the four sides of which are ornamented with delicate pointed arches, supported by slender columns. Executed in white marble, the architecture stands out magnificently upon the black marble background. A train of forty mourners, eccle- siastics, and courtiers, in small statuettes of white alabaster, are passing along the arcades. The clever artist has, with special 4 5° SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. pleasure, expended his masterly skill on these figures. For, with the utmost variety of movement, he depicts the sorrow of each ; some are covering themselves with their monkish cowls, which, with intentional simplicity, are arranged in broad parallel folds ; others, as if in passionate excitement, are throwing back their drapery in rich folds ; others, again, are expressing their grief by the wringing of their hands, or, as if overwhelmed by it, are allowing their heads to fall low on their breasts. The master seems to delight in solving the greatest difficulties, and is in- exhaustible in ever new variations. The effect was originally still more heightened by tasteful gilding. In grand repose on the sarcophagus, with hands folded as if in prayer, lies the statue of Philip the Bold, in full state robes, wrapped in the ducal mantle, with its full folds.1 The head and hands possess a truthfulness to nature, an individual expression, and a delicacy of workmanship, such as we meet with a decade later in the pictures of Hubert van Eyck.’ — Liibkc. In 1442 the first preparations were made for the other great tomb of Jean sans Peur and Marguerite de Bourgogne. The contract was concluded in 1444, but the work was not finished till 1461. The sculptor was a Spaniard — Jehan de la Verta d’Aroca (i.e. of Arragon). Here, also, we see a train of mourners, angels kneeling at the heads with helmet and shield, and the statues are most noble and portrait-like, the hands almost painfully true to nature. Between the tombs is placed a copy of the statue of Anne de Bourgogne, Duchess of Bedford, 1452 (now at the Louvre), daughter of Jean sans Peur. Amongst the other works in the museum are several by Sluter’s scholars, including the monument of Jacques Germain ‘ bourgoys de Clugny, jadiz pbre du reverend pere en 1 The list of the gardcrobc of Philippe le Hardi includes ‘ sachaine a porter reliques, sa gibeciere pour donner h Dieu (aumoniere) et la bonne ceinture de S.

The beautiful and graceful church of Notre Dame was almost entirely built xm c., though it was not consecrated till 1334. Few churches are more deserving of study and admiration. The facade has two ranges of arches above the portals, supported on slender columns, and surmounted by broad friezes, being an evident imitation of the xi. c. and xii. c. churches of Pisa and Lucca. The clock, which surmounts these, is the work of the Fleming Jaquemart, and was carried off from Courtrai by Philippe le Hardi in 1383. The church is entered by a triple porch and three doorways (the central romanesque) leading to the three aisles of the nave. The triforium of the transepts is interrupted at the gable wall to give place to the great rose windows, which are very curious, having no stone compartments, but the whole of the tracery made out in lead. A second lower gallery runs between the columns which support the upper passage and in front of the windows on the first storey. The glass is xm. c., xiv. c., and xv. c. : in the 1. transept are remains of frescoes. A pretty detail of this church may be observed in the crest of the buttresses of the nave, decorated with animals and foliage. In the Rue des Forges (close to Notre Dame) we should notice No. 38 — la Maison Milsand, with a rich renaissance facade, and No. 35, the beautiful gothic Maison Richard. No one should fail to penetrate the narrow passage through this house to a tiny inner court DIJON. 53 to see a renaissance front decorated by the most delicate reliefs and columns and a tourelle with winding staircase. The Chateau , begun in 1478 by Louis XI., finished 1512 by Louis XII., is now a barrack. Glancing at a bronze statue of S. Bernard by Jouffroy, 1847, we should next go to visit the old Chartreuse, now l' A si le des alihies, ten minutes’ walk beyond the railway station. Begun by Philippe le Hardi, 1383, consecrated 1388, it was ravaged at the Revolution, and little now remains. We may, however, find the entrance gate of xiv. c., and the portal of the church where Philippe and his wife, Marguerite de Flandre — evidently portraits — are seen kneeling, commended by the patron saints behind them to the Virgin on the central pillar. The octagonal tower of xiv. c. contains the staircase by which the dukes ascended to their oratory. But the most important relic is the well-head, formerly in the centre of the great cloister, called Puits de Moise or Pints des Prophctes, the masterpiece of Claux Sluter. ‘ It is a work of large dimensions, formed of stone, and richly ornamented with gold and colouring. Six life-size figures of the prophets are introduced round it in strong relief, evidencing a power of characterization far beyond anything that the art of the time had yet attained. David turns energetically to Isaiah, and points out a passage in his scroll ; the one addressed, old, and perhaps rather deaf, laboriously endeavours to understand him. In the aged Zacharias the feebleness of old age is admirably expressed. Jeremiah has an especially portrait-like and wise character of head. David appears regal, and with rich luxuriance of hair ; Moses, grand and commanding, with his long beard, a genuine commander of the Lord’s host. The statues are all rather short and confined, and their fulness is increased by the drapery, which falls in thick folds ; yet they have a peculiar 54 SO UTII-E ASTERN FRANCE. power and majesty, producing all the more effect from their significant characterization. The heads, on the whole, are grandly treated, yet rendered true to nature by touches of the smallest detail. The hands especially are executed with most masterly power, their veins, muscles, and even the finest wrinkles in the skin being visible. Though the quaint tendency of the period has frequently led the artist into a genre style ; though Jeremiah with his spectacles and cap, Isaiah with his girdle and pockets, Zachariah with his ink-bottle, fur-trimmed coat, and high cap, are thorough portrait-figures of the time, we cannot be surprised. Most peculiar is the expression of the angels, who, placed with outspread wings, in the wide upper concave, express their joy and sorrow in the most varied manner. One wipes the tears from his eyes ; another, full of resignation, crosses his hands on his breast ; a third raises both his arms in deprecation p whilst the fourth wrings his hands in despair, — their expression of pain referring to the figure of Christ on the cross, which formerly stood on the fountain.’ — Lilbke. On a vine-clad hill about 3 k. N. of Dijon is the picturesque village of Fontaine-les-Dijon , with a venerable-looking xiv. c. church. Close by are the remains of the chateau of Tesselin- lc-Roux, where his son, S. Bernard, was born, the chamber where the event occurred having been turned into a chapel by Louis XIII. and Anne of Austria. Fontaine is a lovely spot, well worth visiting. ‘ Tesselin, the father of Bernard, was a man of great bravery and unimpeachable honour and justice ; his mother, Alith, like- wise of high birth, a model of devotion and charity. Bernard was the third of six brothers ; he had one sister. The mother, who had secretly vowed all her children to God, took the chief part in their early education, especially in that of Bernard, a simple and studious, a thoughtful and gentle youth, yet even in childhood of strong will and visionary imagination. The mother’s death confirmed the influence of her life. Having long practised secretly the severest monastic discipline, she breathed out her spirit amid the psalms of the clergy around her bed ; the last movement of her lips was praise to God. 55 FONTAINE-LES-DIJON. « The world was open to the/ youth of high birth, beautiful person, graceful manners, and irresistible influence. The Court would at once have welcomed a young knight, so endowed, with her highest honours ; the Church would have trained a noble disciple so richly gifted for her most powerful bishoprics or her wealthiest abbeys. He closed his eyes upon the world, on the worldly Church, with stern determination. He became at once FONTAINE-LES-DIJON. the master of his passions. His eyes had dwelt too long and too curiously on a beautiful female ; he plunged to the neck in a pool of cold water. His chastity underwent, but untainted, severe trials. Yet he resolved to abandon this incorrigible world altogether. He inquired for the poorest, the most austere of monasteries. It was that of Citeaux. He arrived at the gates, but not alone. Already his irresistible influence had drawn around him thirty followers, all equally resolute in the renuncia- tion of secular life, in submission to the most vigorous discipline. 56 SOUTH-EASTERN FRANCE. But this was not all ; his mother's vow must be fulfilled. One after the other the strange and irresistible force of his character enthralled his brothers, and at length his sister. Two of the brothers with an uncle followed his steps at once ; the elder, Guido, was married ; his wife refused to yield up her claims on her husband’s love. A seasonable illness enforced her sub- mission ; she, too, retired to a convent. A wound in the side, prophesied, it was said, by Bernard, brought another, a gallant warrior, as a heart-stricken penitent into his company. When they all left the castle of their father, where they had already formed a complete monastic brotherhood, Guido, the elder, addressed Nivard, the youngest son, “ To you remains the whole patrimony of our house.” “ Earth to me, and heaven to you, that is no fair portion,” said the boy. He lingered a short time with his aged father, and then joined the rest. Even the father died a monk of Clairvaux in the arms of Bernard.' — Milman, ‘Hist, of Latin Christianity.’ The excellent Hotel de la Cloche at Dijon is a capital centre for excursions. Antiquarians will visit Flavigny ; historians, Bussy-Rabutin ; archeologists', Alesia ; architects, Issomes ; but no one should fail to see Beaune, which infinitely repays a visit, not only as a charming example of a picturesque provincial town, but from the deep architectural interest of its unique hospital, and the beauty of its glorious Van Eyck. Philip Thicknesse, who wrote his travels in France in 1775, saw a family of nine, who had lived by highway plunder, hanging near Dijon — a man, his wife, and seven children. [A post road (there is a railway) of 85 k. leads from Dijon to Chatillon-sur-Seine, passing (28 k .) S. Seine T Abbayc, named from a famous Benedictine abbey, founded 531 by S.

The abbots’ palace, where Louis XIV. twice slept, is now a hydropathic establishment. The church, rebuilt after afire in 1255, was finished in xv. c. There is a singularity in the way in which the triforium is blended with the upper tier of windows. The choir preserves its curious cloture of heavy masonry and is covered, externally, with paintings of the beginning of xvi. c. relating to the history of S. Seine. ‘ Le grand-autel est sans ratable. Ilya seulement un gradin et six chandeliers dessus. Au-dessus est un crucifix haut de plus de huit pieds, nu-dessous duquel est la suspension du saint sacrement dans le ciboire : et aux deux cotes de l’autel il y a quatre colonnes de cuivre et quatre anges de cuivre avec des chandeliers et des cierges et des grands rideaux.’ — 1 Voyages liturgiques de France .’ There are beautiful remains of a gothic rood-loft and nine gravestones of abbots of xm. c., xiv. c., and xv. c. 3A k. before reaching Chanccaux (37 k. from Dijon) on the 1. is the farm of Vergerots. Here, in a little wooded valley, is the Source of the Seine, where the remains of a Gallo-Roman temple were discovered in 1836. A grotto with the statue of a nymph by Jouffroy was erected here by the city of Paris in 1867. Another route to Chatillon goes by ( 10 k.) Messigny, with a xiv. c. church containing tombs of the family of Saulx de Vantoux ; and (50 k.) S. Broingt-les-Roches, 12 k. to the 1. of which is Aignay-le-Duc, a favourite residence of the dukes of Burgundy of the first race.] [A railway leads from Dijon to (88 k.)

The principal facade has a portal of three romanesque arches, sup- ported on low columns with sculptured capitals, and surrounded by a triple window. There are no transepts. At the meeting of nave and choir rises the very curious tower, crowned by an octagonal spire, at the base of which rise four gables, and at the angles four triangular erections, supported by little pillars, ( CHATEAU D'URCY. 59 and forming platforms at the top intended for the reception of four statuettes of angels, now lost.
