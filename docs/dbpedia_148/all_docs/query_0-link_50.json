Ever!\n\n☯ We do not data mine, share or sell any information in our database.\n\n☯ We do not use tracker scripts, LSO's, analytics or widgets.\n\n☯ We do not use embedded scripts to track your site overall website usage. We do have specific website features such as contests, profile views, profile photo views and event listings that we must track in order for those features to function properly.\n\n☯ We do not maintain your private data indefinitely.

Cookies are not used for any other purpose.\n\n☯ We only use web beacons for external emails. Web beacons are only used to detect if an external email has actually been opened or replied to. This is done so we can synchronize our internal email mailbox to show the sender and receiver the same emails that have been opened and/or replied to. Web beacons are not used anywhere else on LL.\n\n☯ We do take your privacy concerns seriously.\n\nSummit Group USA, LLC, (\"Summit\") respects the privacy of its users and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our website or services or transacting business with us. By using our website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nIf you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.\n\nInformation we collect about you\n\nPersonal Information. We may collect information that can identify you such as your name and email address and other information that does not identify you. We may collect this information through the www.Lifestylelounge.com website or a mobile application mobile.lifestylelounge.com. We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or on a mobile application, or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your name, photographs you may submit, and email address. We do not, however, collect or store any financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). That information is collected by our third-party payment processors. You may also provide us information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information such as your hometown or your username.\n\n☯ Information collected automatically. We may automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our website or application. This information could include your IP address, device ID, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us (see \"Cookies\" below), and the referring website address.\n\n☯ Information you provide. For certain LL optional features to function properly, you will be required to provide your phone number. These features are the LL Anonymous Text Messaging Service, and the LL Geo-Location Notification Service. Your phone number is never shared with other members, or any other 3rd party. You can remove your phone number from these services at anytime, and we do not keep a permanent record of your phone number, or data that was transmitted over these services. As in all data practices within LL, once you remove your data, it is permanently removed from our service.\n\n☯ Cookies and Use of Cookie Data. When you visit our website or application, we may assign your device one or more \"cookies\" facilitate access to our site and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your visits, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our site.\n\nHow we use the information we collect\n\nWe may use information that we collect about you to:\n\n☯ deliver our products and services, and manage our business;\n\n☯ manage your account and provide you with customer support;\n\n☯ perform event ad tracking and website or mobile application analytics;\n\n☯ verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with contests and sweepstakes;\n\n☯ enforce or exercise any rights in our terms and conditions;\n\n☯ perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection; and\n\nIn all circumstances, we may perform these functions directly or use a third party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf who will be obligated to use your personal information only to perform services for us.\n\nWith whom we share your information\n\nPersonal Information. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share information, including personal information, with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests offered through our site. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.\n\nOther Situations. We also may disclose your information, including personal information:\n\n☯ In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.\n\n☯ When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.\n\n☯ In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.\n\nDo Not Track Disclosure\n\nDo Not Track (\"DNT\") is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.\n\nLocation Data\n\nWe only request access to or otherwise receive information about your device location when you specifically access the geo-location service. You will always be prompted with a popup confirmation window asking for your permission to access your location. You are given the option to show your exact location, or an approximate location randomly selected within a mile radius of your location. The choice of accuracy is under your control.\n\nWe do not permanently store your location history. Once you remove your profile from the geo-locator, your geo-location data is completely deleted.\n\nUsage of IP Addresses\n\nWe use IP addresses to help us detect and prevent fraudulent activity. Unique IP addresses are associated in our database with the corresponding member profile. IP addresses remain confidential and are never shared with members or third parties. We may also obtain IP addresses through our subscription payment service, but this IP address is not stored in our database.\n\nThird-party websites\n\nThere are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the \"privacy\" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.\n\nHow you can access your information\n\nIf you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging into your account and clicking on your account settings. More information about how to contact us is provided below. If you have an online account with us, you also may close your account at any time by visiting the \"Account Settings\" page for your account. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.\n\nYour choices about collection and use of your information\n\n☯ You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our site because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.\n\n☯ When you register on our site, you consent to receive email messages from us. You may modify this consent later by visiting the \"Account Settings\" page associated with your account. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by visiting the \"Account Settings\" page associated with your account. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you transactional and relationship emails, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them (except by closing your account). Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications, will only affect future activities or communications from us. Our applications may also deliver notifications to your phone or mobile device. You can disable these notifications in your device's settings in your account under \"Account Settings\" or by deleting the relevant application.\n\n☯ You can also control information collected by cookies.\n\nHow we protect your personal information\n\nWe take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.\n\nInformation you provide about yourself while using our service\n\nWe provide areas on our site where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our Terms and Conditions of Use. Please keep in mind whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.\n\nChildren's privacy\n\nAlthough our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18.\n\nVisiting our websites from outside the United States\n\nIf you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.\n\nChanges to this Privacy Policy\n\nWe will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the \"last updated\" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you check our site from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.\n\nHow to contact us\n\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email or postal mail as set forth in the Terms and Conditions of Use.\n\nSummit Group USA, LLC\n\nAttn: General Counsel\n\n1161 E. Wayzata Blvd\n\nSuite #2\n\nWayzata, MN 55391\n\nLIFESTYLELOUNGE.COM TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy using the Lifestylelounge.com web site (\"Site\"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (this \"Agreement\"), whether or not you register as a paying member (\"Member\"). This Agreement spells out the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the Site and your membership on the Site may be modified by Lifestylelounge.com from time to time.\n\nELIGIBILITY, TERMS OF SERVICE, CONTENTS AND USER SUBMISSIONS\n\n1.1 Eligibility. You must be eighteen or over to register as a Member of or use this Site. Membership in the Site is void where prohibited. By using and/or viewing this site, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement and will abide by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, that you are at least 18-years old (21-years old in AL, MS, NE, WY, and any other location where 18 is not the age of majority) and are interested in and wish to have access to visual images, verbal and written descriptions and audio sounds of a sexually oriented nature. The materials, which are available within this Site may include graphic visual depictions and descriptions of nudity and sexual activity and should not be accessed by anyone who is younger than 18-years old (21-years old in AL, MS, NE, WY, and any other location where 18 is not the age of majority) or who is offended by such materials or who does not wish to be exposed to such materials.\n\nBy using and/or viewing this Site you represent and warrant the following:\n\nA) That you are an adult, at least 18-years of age (21-years old in AL, MS, NE, WY, and any other location where 18 is not the age of majority).\n\nB) That you will not permit any person(s) under 18-years of age (21-years old in AL, MS, NE, WY, and any other location where 18 is not the age of majority) to have access to any of the materials contained within this Site.\n\nC) That you understand that when you gain access to this site, you will be exposed to visual images, verbal descriptions and audio sounds of a sexually oriented nature, which may include graphic visual depictions and descriptions of nudity and sexual activity. You are voluntarily choosing to do so because you want to view, read and/or hear the various materials which are available for your own personal enjoyment, information and/or education. Your choice is a manifestation of your interest in sexual matters which, you believe, is both healthy and normal and which, in your experience, is generally shared by average adults in your community. You further represent and warrant that you are familiar with the standards in your community regarding the acceptance of such sexually oriented materials, and the materials you expect to encounter are within those standards. In your judgment, the average adult in your community accepts the consumption of such materials by willing adults in circumstances such as this which offer reasonable insulation from the materials for minors and unwilling adults, and will not find such materials to appeal to a prurient interest or to be patently offensive.\n\nD) That you further represent and warrant that you have not notified any governmental agency, including the U.S. postal service, that you do not wish to receive sexually oriented material.\n\nE) That you represent and warrant that you have not and will not use and/or view the Site in a restricted location - namely a place, country, or location in which doing so would, or could be deemed a violation of any law, regulation, rule, ordinance, edict or custom.\n\nF) You warrant that, if you are a police officer, government investigator or agent of any kind, you are registering as a Member, using the Site, and are present at any Lifestylelounge.com event only in your private, individual capacity. You warrant that if the foregoing statement should prove to be false, you are investigating any of the Members or management of the Site without disclosing your official capacity or purpose, and that your presence at any Lifestylelounge.com event, is an entry into private premises without consent, in violation of the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; you further warrant that you are attending at the direction of your employers and are acting within the scope of your employment. You stipulate that an appropriate amount of liquidated damages for the illegal taking of evidence or invasion of privacy which embarrasses the Member or which results in legal process, civil or criminal, against any of the Members is $100,000 per intrusion, which reflects a reasonable estimate of probable compensatory damages for loss of privacy, including humiliation, emotional distress, necessity to pay legal fees, loss of employment or advancement, and other injuries, the amount of which is uncertain. This amount shall be awarded to each Member or management against whom the investigation is targeted or against whom civil or criminal process is brought, including execution of a search warrant. A final award under this subparagraph shall not prevent a subsequent proceeding if charges are thereafter filed against a Member, but the first award shall be an offset against the later award.\n\nG) You represent that, if you are a member of the press (including television & radio), you are registering as a Member, using the Site, and are present at any Lifestylelounge.com event only in your private, individual capacity. You warrant that, if the foregoing statement proves to be false, you are here at the direction of your employers and are acting within the scope of your employment; that you are violating the rights of the Members to privacy under common law and the U.S. Constitution, and that an appropriate amount of liquidated damages for any published report made which portrays or describes the activities of any Member is ten dollars ($10) times the number of readers or viewers of any medium which publishes the report, which reflects a reasonable estimate of probable compensatory damages for loss of privacy, including humiliation, emotional distress, necessity to pay legal fees, loss of employment or advancement, and other injuries, the amount of which is uncertain. This amount shall be awarded to each Member named in the report or described in such a way as to permit identification of the Member by application of the description to publicly available information.\n\nH) You represent that you have not been convicted of, nor are charged with or presently under indictment or investigation for, a sexual offense or felony involving bodily harm or threats of bodily harm, or an offense involving child pornography. You further represent that you are not a registered sex offender.\n\n1.2 Terms of Service. This Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Site and/or are a Member (the \"Service\"). You may terminate your membership at any time, for any reason by written or email notice of termination. Summit may terminate your membership for any reason or no reason, effective upon sending notice to you at the email address you provide in your application for membership, or such other email address as you may later provide to Summit. If Summit terminates your membership because you have breached the Agreement, you will not be entitled to any refund of unused subscription fees. Even after this Agreement is terminated, certain provisions will remain in effect, including sections 1.1, 2.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement.\n\n1.3 Content.

In this regard, this website is much like a national \"Personals\" website, and the same care that one would exercise when giving information to strangers, or setting up meetings with strangers, must be used here. Summit will never give information about one Member to another Member. Further, you are cautioned that giving any information to another Member on this website carries with it significant risks. If you give any information to anyone, you are taking a significant risk, which are greatly increased if you plan to meet other Members face-to-face. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease should the parties engaging in sexual activities. Summit waives all liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of meeting a Member from the Site. Please use caution and common-sense when using this service, meeting people or engaging in sexual activities.\n\n7.2 Summit is the exclusive home of the \"100% Real Seal.\" The Real Seal indicates that the Member in question is who they say they are - a man, a woman, or a couple. Members are awarded a 100% Real Seal only upon either of the following: (1) submitting to management evidence sufficient to prove to management that they are who they portray themselves in their profile. Management has the sole discretion to determine what constitutes sufficient evidence; or (2) meeting in person a Member who has already been awarded the 100% Real Seal and having that Member certify that they are who they portray themselves in their profile. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Real Seal isn't 100% guaranteed. Therefore, use caution even when a Member has been awarded a Real Seal. Furthermore, the Real Seal only affirms that the Member is a member of the demographic group they claim to belong to (male, female, or couple). The Real Seal does not indicate that this Member is safe to contact, meet, or give information to. Use the same caution when dealing with a Real Seal Member that you would use when dealing with any other Member.\n\n7.3 You agree that you will award a Member the \"100% Real Seal\" only if you meet that Member in person. If you violate this Section 7.3, Summit may, in its sole discretion, terminate your membership and you will not be entitled to any refund of any subscription monies paid.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\n8.1 Summit takes every precaution to protect your privacy.
