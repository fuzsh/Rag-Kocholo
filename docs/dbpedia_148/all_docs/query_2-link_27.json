Macon, Curator of Chantilly, and guardian of its priceless archives, I cannot be too grateful. To M. Omont, of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, I owe a like acknow- ledgment for his unfailing and ready help during my study of the manuscripts under his charge. In the parts of the work relating to military matters, I have had invaluable assistance from Major-General Sir Alexander Godley, K.C.M.G. ; while the passages dealing with con- temporary history have been kindly read and criticised by Mr. Geoffrey Headlam, of Eton College. Among many who have given me the benefit of advice and sympathy, I must first mention my father, Lord Kilbracken. I am also deeply indebted to Lady Burghclere, whose studies on the history of the seven- teenth century are well known ; to The Hon. Mrs. Walter James ; to Miss Katharine Mathew ; to my aunt, Miss Godley ; and to my brother-in-law, Mr. John Coleridge. With regard to information from manuscript sources, I have done my best to ascertain which of the many extracts in this book are now published for the first time, and to distinguish them accordingly ; but if, in any case, it is shown that I have made the claim unjustly, I hereby apologise beforehand.

THE GREAT CONDE PART I CHAPTER I CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION 1621-1637 \" LA Magnifique et Superbe entree de Monseigneur le due d'Anguien en la ville de Bourges, en attendant le jour heureux de son baptesme \". Thus is recorded the first public appearance of Louis de Bourbon, Due d'Enghien ; x called, by succeeding ages, * the Great Conde '. The impressive titles of his later years are thus given in full by an early biographer : \" Louis de Bourbon ; Second du Nom ; Prince de Conde ; Premier Prince du Sang ; Surnomme le Grand \". The Princes of the branch of Bourbon-Conde traced their descent in direct line from St. Louis.2 The coveted distinction, ' First Prince of the Blood ', had come to them with the accession of their kinsman Henri iv ; it was bestowed, at that time, upon Henri de Bourbon, third Prince of Conde, who, until the birth of a son to the King, stood next in succession to the throne. At Court, or elsewhere, the head of their family was known pre- eminently as ' the Prince ', ' Monsieur le Prince '.3 His eldest son, the Due d'Enghien, was recognised as ' Monsieur le Due ' ; by which undisputed title the Great Conde was known for the first twenty-five years of his life. 1 The name was formerly written Anguien, or Anguyen. 2 Sse Appendix A. 3 Saint-Simon (cd. Cheruel, vii. 160) ascribes the origin of this title to the custom of the Huguenots, who invariably applied it to their leader, the first Prince of Conde. 2 CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION [CHAP, i May the 5th, 1626, was the happy day of M. le Due's baptism. It had been deferred for no less than four years and eight months ; the date of his birth was September 7th, 1621. Such delay was not un- common in the case of state Christenings ; perhaps on account of the extreme length and trying nature of the ceremony. Louis xiv himself, like his cousin of Enghien, was not formally baptized till he was nearly five years old ; at which ripe age a Prince of the Blood was expected to be capable of playing his part on any public occasion. Henri n de Bourbon, Prince of Conde, and father of Monseigneur le Due, had lately been appointed Governor of the provinces of Berry and Burgundy ; an office which gave him the oppor- tunity of having his little son received into the Church with royal honours. King Louis xm, as god-father, gave his own name to the child. The service was to be held at Bourges, the capital of Berry, in the splendid Cathedral of St. Etienne ; and the inhabitants, de- lighted at this compliment paid them by their Governor, spared no pains to prepare appropriate rejoicings. On the morning of May 2nd, M. le Due, magnifi- cently dressed in blue velvet and silver, arrived at the open space outside the town, known as the l grand Credo ' ; where he dined with the chief nobles of the province, and also received ' harangues ', or addresses, from various deputations. The Prince, his father, was present, but, with commendable tact, kept him- self in the background (' se tenoit un peu a 1'escart J) ; and the Duke, unsupported, bore himself with that complete assurance which seldom deserted him in after life. One charming feature of the proceedings was the entrance of a regiment of small children \" all dressed alike, armed with little pikes and swords, wearing ribbons of their Prince's colours, and led by captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, all of the same age \". After the ' harangues ' had been delivered, a procession was formed, to escort the Duke, who was carried in a litter. First went the ' Pr£vot Provincial ', covered with gold tinsel, and his lieutenants, ' vestus a 1'avantage ' ; the ' archers ', who were in reality a corps of cavalry, in crimson velvet, carrying pistols and carbines. Then followed a great array of religious orders ; Capuchins, Cordeliers, Carmelites, Minims, Jacobins, and Aug- ustines ; and the clergy of the different chapters con- 1 62 1-6] BAPTISMAL CEREMONIES nected with the town. Every few yards they were met by fresh detachments, who came out with greetings for M. le Due ; always beginning with the same solemn rhetoric : \" Monseigneur, les anciens \", or \"les Romains \", etc. etc., and never including a single sentence which it seemed possible a child of four could understand. At the gates of the town two silver keys were given him ; farther on, under a great triumphal arch, ' a beautiful child, clothed in white satin ', presented solid silver figures of a shepherd, three sheep, and a dog, in al- lusion to the arms of Bourges, and the chief industry of Berry. The Jesuit fathers had erected an open- air stage in front of their College, where a short inter- lude was performed, ' pour le contentement de ce jeune prince '. After so many serious discourses, it is a relief to hear that the piece was of a cheerful nature, ' pleine de rejouissance et d'allegresse '. At length the Cathedral was reached, and here the Archbishop, in his Ponti- fical vestments, with all the Canons, came out to meet the Duke, and led him into the Choir, while a Te Deum was sung, * with the music of voices and instruments '. Three days later, the actual Christening took place. M. le Due spared his god-parents all responsibility by making the responses audibly for himself, and repeat- ing the Creed, in Latin, from beginning to end.1 Henri de Bourbon was not an affectionate father ; but he held most decided and practical views on the subject of education, and he was thoroughly deter- mined that the most should be made of his son's mental gifts. Like all the heads of great princely houses at that date, he looked upon the younger members of his family simply as his tools ; the more intelligent and capable they were, the more influence he could obtain through them. Not that he had any vast ambition to gratify ; his chief anxiety was to be rich, — his avarice was a byword, — and to be preferred, for lucrative posts, before the Princes of Lorraine and Vendome, or the Soissons branch of the Bourbons. Among this insatiable crowd of minor royalty, Henri de Bourbon might be singled out as representing, in his own person, nearly all the worst faults of his kind. He was servile as well as grasping ; without dignity and without principle. Even superficial gifts were denied him. 1 The details of M. le Due's christening ceremony are taken from a contemporary pamphlet in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris. 4 CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION [CHAP, i He had not the frankly commanding aspect of his forefathers ; that ' air releve ' which the Great Conde seems to have inherited from his more distant ancestors ; and which, in former years, had caused the English King, Henry vm, to say of Charles de Bourbon : 'I would not be master to that subject of my brother of France\". Still less could he claim the genial qualities of his grandfather, Louis i of Conde* : \" Ce petit homme tant joli Qui tou jours cause et tou jours rit, Et tou jours baise sa mignonne, Dieu gard' de mal le petit homme ! \" Yet this singularly unattractive prince was the husband of one of the most beautiful women in Europe. The story of his marriage, as told by Tallemant des Reaux, is an excellent example of the use which the Kings of France made of their more or less dependent relations. Marie de Medicis, Queen-Consort of Henri iv, had devised a ballet, in which all the most beautiful ladies of the Court were to take part ; among them, Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency, a girl of fifteen, daughter of Henri, Due de Montmorency, and grand- daughter of the renowned Constable Anne. Her beauty, it was said, had been celebrated from the time she was four years old. When the moment arrived for choosing the performers, the King and Queen were soon at variance ; in the end, the Queen had her way, but the King, to mark his displeasure, refused to take any further interest in the preparations. \" All this time \", says the chronicler, \" the practising for the ballet went on without hindrance. Every time the ladies attended a rehearsal, they passed down the gallery in front of the King's apartments ; but he, being angry, no sooner heard them coming than he ordered the doors to be shut \". One day, this order was not strictly carried out, and he caught a glimpse of Mademoiselle de Mont- morency as she went by with her companions. Im- mediately he left his room and followed them, to watch the performance. \" Now, the ladies were dressed as nymphs, and at one moment of the dance they lifted their javelins, as if in the act to throw them. Mademoiselle de Montmorency was standing opposite to the King when she raised her dart, and she seemed to pierce him with it \". \" From that day forward the 1 62 1-6] THE QUEEN'S BALLET 5 porter had no orders to shut the door, and the King allowed the Queen to do whatever she pleased \". His first step was to arrange a marriage which should keep the nymph at Court ; and Henri de Bourbon was desired to come forward. Charlotte de Montmorency had many suitors. She was actually betrothed to Francois de Bassompierre,1 a young man who seemed to possess all the necessary qualifications for a hero of romance ; but, at the King's command, sentiment was thrown to the winds. Bassompierre relinquished his claim, Henri de Bourbon assured himself that the marriage portion was satisfactory, and Mademoiselle de Montmorency became Princess of Conde. Many years later it was said by one who had known them intimately, that \" M. le Prince had only given Madame la Princesse two happy days in her life ; namely, the day when he married her, and gave her his great rank ; and the day of his death, when she regained her liberty and inherited his large fortune \".2 It soon proved to be only in public life that the Prince was submissive. As a husband, he showed himself unexpectedly tyrannical ; and the Princess, who was timid by nature, became, before long, an obedient wife. When, soon after the accession of Louis xin, her husband fell into disgrace and was im- prisoned at Vincennes, she followed him dutifully. There, in captivity, their four eldest children were born ; three sons, who died in infancy, and a daughter, Anne-Gene vieve de Bourbon, afterwards Duchesse de Longueville. Their fifth child, born in Paris after his father's release, was the Great Conde. \" Now that you have a boy, I do not doubt that you are pleased \", wrote Louis xin, who, at that time, was still childless ; \" and so you have reason to be ; these are the favours of Heaven \".3 Madame la Princesse was not allowed much voice in the bringing-up of her son. The child was so delicate that for some time he was scarcely expected to live. He was sent from Paris to the Castle of Montrond, in Berry ; and, whereas children of his rank were usually entrusted to ladies of quality, he was placed under the charge of two or three ' bourgeoises ', ' full of experi- 1 Afterwards Marshal of France; born 1579 ; died 1646. 2 Madame de Motteville, Memoires. 3 Archives of Chantilly, September, 1621. 6 CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION [CHAP, i ence, care, and wisdom ' ; a measure which, in all probability, saved his life. It would seem, from the accounts of his early childhood, that there never was a more insubordinate little boy ; \" he resisted, as far as the weakness of his age allowed, the rules for going to bed, for getting up, for meals, and for recreation \"-1 Like a true Bourbon, he owned no authority but that of the head of his House. His father was the only person who could be relied on to bring him to reason ; and it was by the Prince's order that M. le Due was soundly punished as often as he deserved it. But if he was troublesome, he was very far from stupid ; those in charge of him soon discovered that the more his mind was occupied, the more easily he could be managed. No truer word was ever spoken of him than that of the Jesuit Father Pelletier, when he said of his pupil, \" C'est un esprit auquel il faut de Vemploi \". Therefore, at eight years old, little more than three years after the famous Christening, the Duke was regularly installed as a student at the College of Ste. Marie of Bourges ; an arrangement which commended itself greatly to Henri de Bourbon's careful mind. He was able to secure excellent teaching for his son ; while his position as Governor freed him from many of the ordinary expenses. To encourage family affection was no part of the educational scheme. Enghien's intercourse with his relations was limited to an occasional holiday at Mont- rond, — often in the absence of his parents, — and visits from his father. Visits from Madame la Princesse were rare, and subject to restrictions. Henri de Bourbon came often to the capital of his province, and never failed to inquire after his son's progress. He used to question him, and look through his compositions ; he also made him dance before him ; \"in which \", says Lenet the secretary, who was often an eye- witness, \" he took particular pleasure \", as the young prince \" ex- celled in this agreeable exercise \".2 One short and memorable interval the three children, Enghien, his sister, and his little brother Armand,3 Prince of Conti, spent together at Bourges. This was in the autumn .of 1632, while their mother made a desperate journey to beg mercy of Richelieu for her only brother, Henri de Mont- morency, famed for ' his valour, his good looks, and his 1 Desormeaux, Histoire de la Vie et des Actions de Louis de Bourbon. 2 Lenet, Memoires. 3 Born 1629 ; died 1666. 1 630] THE COLLEGE OF SAINTE MARIE 7 magnificence ', who was lying under sentence of death for insurrection. Her errand was in vain ; Montmorency was beheaded, and most of his friends disgraced. It was M. le Due's first experience of contemporary politics ; he never forgot it, and never forgave Richelieu the part which he had played. All this while, the idea that the ' First Prince of the Blood ' should be educating his son at a public institu- tion, was arousing comment of every kind. Such a decision had never been heard of before. It was looked on, in some quarters, as scarcely less than sacrilege. On the whole, however, popular opinion approved of the innovation. Father Denis Petau, a distinguished Jesuit scholar, dedicated to the Duke his Livre de Raison du Temps or Rationarium Temporum, congratulating him openly on being educated so differently from other princes ; and received in return an admirably polite letter, thanking him for the compliment, and begging in conclusion \" the assistance of your holy prayers for me, so that, by the grace of God, I may imitate the virtues and the innocence of my patron St. Louis \"-1 This much-discussed system does not strike the modern mind as dangerously democratic. Instead of living in the College, M. le Due was established in the most beauti- ful house in Bourges ; the famous Palais Jacques-Cceur, built in the fifteenth century by the treasurer of Charles vii. ' A cuers vaillans, rien impossible/ was the device — sometimes quoted as prophetic, — which the first owner had carved in stone on the facade. The household of M. le Due was placed under the direction of a ' faithful and well-intentioned ' tutor or ' gouver- neur ', M. de la Buffetiere. It included a doctor, an apothecary, and fifteen or twenty servants ; besides horses and carriages, and a magnificent state coach painted blue, and lined with crimson velvet, which was presented by the inhabitants of the town on New Year's Day, 1630. Two Jesuit Fathers, Pelletier and Le Maitre-Gonthier, were especially chosen to superintend the Duke's studies ; \" the former \", we are told, \" of a firmer character and a more austere virtue ; the latter, more gentle, more insinuating, better fitted for dealing with the great \".2 In class, the seat occupied by M. le Due was surrounded by a small gilt balustrade, within whose protecting circle he worked wonders. u No 1 A .C. 2 Desormeaux. 8 CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION [CHAP, i pupil\", says the school report for the year 1630, \" has shone more brightly than Louis de Bourbon, Due d'Enghien \". His example, it was added, ' inflamed all his companions '. Enghien also appeared with great distinction in the dramatic representations given from time to time by the pupils. His first appearance was in the title role of a Latin drama, Hyacinthus Liber atus, performed at the prize-giving ceremony of 1630. These representa- tions generally took place in the ' salle des Actes ' of the College ; but the report that the little Prince was to take a part drew an audience of such overwhelming numbers that the hall of the Palais Jacques-Cceur had to be substituted. The nine-year-old Hyacinthus gave every satisfaction, and, judging by what records we possess, it is not hard to believe that he made an attractive figure. In these early portraits the face is childish and delicate, and the marked features of the Great Conde are still undeveloped ; but he has already the lively expression which always distinguished him ; besides the thick crop of curly hair which, in after-life, he so rarely attempted to keep as tidy as custom re- quired. Another character, appropriately played by the Duke, was that of ' L'Homme epris de la Gloire ' in the interlude Philotimus et Misotimus. His crowning performance, however, was in the tragedy of Astion, Martyr ; an edifying but gloomy piece, given during the Carnival of 1632, and wholly unsuited to that cheer- ful season. Astion is a young Christian noble, who suffers martyrdom under Diocletian ; his persecutor is Latronianus, a tyrant, subsequently ' dragged by furies to the infernal regions '. One copy of the work x still in existence gives a complete list of the dramatis personce on this occasion ; where the name which, to some loya minds, was ' sacred and holy ' appears in all simplicity : ASTION ..... Louis de Bourbon, Due d'Eng- hien. EPIC^TE (companion of Astion) . Rene de Mailly. LATRONIANUS (Prefect of Scythia) . Claude Deschamps. An Angel Blaise du Boisbreil. and a host of other characters, ending with 'Louis Pinson, Jean Magistry, and Pierre Quillon ', who figure collec- tively as ' Furies '.

THE GREAT CONDE AS A CHILD, 1633 (From a print in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris) [To face p. 8 1635] STUDY AT BOURGES 9 was staying in Bourges to be present at the festivities, and who had the pleasure of hearing his son's per- formance loudly acclaimed. Some allowance must perhaps be made for ' dealing with the great ' ; but, even so, it seems likely that Enghien was in truth a promising scholar. His worst enemies never denied him intelligence ; and all his life he was known to be a lover of books. From the moment when he sets to work on serious studies there are few complaints of his conduct. Certainly those who were charged to occupy his mind did not spare themselves or their pupil. Special teachers were engaged, to supplement the ordinary course. Father Pelletier 's correspondence refers to a most formidable list of subjects : rhetoric, philosophy, logic, physics, mathematics, and other sciences. In April, 1635, the Duke is \" preparing himself in the whole study of philosophy, which is not a light task \" ; \" he is well, thanks be to God \", the letter continues, \" and gives great hope of his piety and his capacities in the future \".1 Examinations were held once a month in class, and once a year in public. Each pupil was required to * soutenir des theses ' ; that is, he was given one or more arguments, on fixed subjects, to support in discussion with the professors, who were called ' les assaillants '. M. le Due, by his father's express wish,2 submitted regularly to these inflictions. One of his prizes, gained in 1633, is still preserved, a copy of St. Francois de Sales' Traicte de I1 Amour de Dieu, bound with the arms of Bourbon-Conde on the cover, and an inscription to ' the illustrious prince, Louis de Bourbon ', on the fly-leaf.3 Even his letters to his father are written in Latin during these early years ; again by the command of that unrelenting Prince, who was never tired of spurring on his son's teachers, till they themselves sometimes begged for mercy. In the summer of 1635 a terrific final examination was held, in which all the successive courses of study were summed up. Among the various theses Enghien was required to support, were twenty-seven * on Ethics ', fifteen ' on Meteors ', fifteen ( on the transformation of Substances ', and 1 Father Pelletier to Henri, Prince of Conde, A.C. 2 ' Je veux que mon fils soutienne les theses du mois comme les autres' (Henri, Prince of Conde, to Father Pelletier, A.C.). 3 Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris. io CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION [CHAP, i fifteen ' on Metaphysics '. The discussions were held in public, and the circle of assailants consisted of pre- lates, and scholars of distinction. But the Duke was nothing if not courageous, and his triumph surpassed all expectations. No wonder that La Fontaine wrote, fifty years later, of ' M. le Prince ' : u He has a great love of argument, and never shows so much ingenuity as when he is in the wrong.\" Whatever aptitude Enghien may have shown, there can be no doubt that the strain of such a system was very severe for a delicate child ; or that his brain power was developed at the expense of his health and nerves. After this final effort, he was so much exhausted that he had to be sent to Montrond for a comparative holiday ; but even from here Father Pelletier writes that one of the supplementary professors had been astonished that the Duke was not allowed more leisure, \" for recreation and the good of his health \". \" He told me \", he adds, \" that I ought to see to it, as no one else concerned themselves about it \".2 Following this suggestion are vigorous recriminations between Father Pelletier and La Buffetiere, the ' gouverneur ', whose duty it was to escort the Duke out hunting, on the rare occasions when he was allowed a day's sport. Father Pelletier encouraged this pupil in the idea that this in- dulgence might be granted rather oftener ; and Enghien, nothing loth, persisted, until La Buffetiere, exasperated, told him that \" he only stayed with him to expiate his own past sins \". M. le Due, just fourteen, and needing no encouragement to assert himself, declared, in return, that his tutor treated him like a lacquey (' comme un faquin ') and that his age and rank deserved some- thing better. This heated interview is described by Father Pelletier in an indignant letter to the Prince. It was not without result. Henri de Bourbon seems to have realised that a hired authority was not likely to be effective much longer. Moreover, he did not intend that his son should be too much trained to submission, — except towards parental commands. He would be all the more useful for knowing how to hold his own, on occasion. The course at Bourges had been completed, and it was time for the work of emancipation to begin. xLa Fontaine, Comparaison d' Alexandra, de Cesar, et de M. le Prince. 2 Father Pelletier to Henri, Prince of Conde, A .C. 1636] RELIGIOUS IMPRESSIONS n Enghien took his last leave of Bourges and the College in January, 1636. Six years of subjection, of hard study in a strict religious atmosphere, could hardly fail to leave their mark. Yet in spite of the school report, which speaks of him as ' formed in mind and character ' — he was not fifteen ! — their influence was less moral than intellectual. Certain hereditary defects of the Bourbon race might be repressed for the moment, but the very strictness and narrowness of the system made a reaction all the more inevitable. The Prince, who 11 gave great hopes of his piety for the future \", and who is named among the members of the ' Congregation of Our Lady V — \" Louis, Prince de Conde, eleve sous la protection de la Mere de Dieu, a Bourges \", — seems a long way from the ' Conde, ce diable ' of the Fronde. Nevertheless, the effect of this early training does re- appear, now and again, generally to the unconcealed amazement of the spectators. \" I have reason to think \", writes, naively enough, one who was no partisan of ' M. le Prince ', \" that there was some foundation of goodness in his soul, which on supreme occasions turned him towards God ; Whose power he worshipped, though he did not obey His commandments as he ought. I have heard his followers say that he sometimes showed great signs of being susceptible to religion, although he had no reputation for piety M.2 Further, it may be said that, professed atheist as he appeared for many years, the Great Conde was never indifferent to religion as a subject. He would talk, and argue, on theological matters, even at the time when he was least given to practising the Christian virtues. And let it not be forgotten that it was to an old school-fellow of Bourges, Father Etienne Agard des Champs, that he applied for help in his final conversion. The fame of the Due d 'Enghien 's achievements in learning had been spread abroad before he left the College of Ste Marie. The second, and more worldly, stage in his education was to be a course at the Academic Royale in Paris ; but there was an interval between the two, during which he was allowed to visit the chief towns of Berry and Burgundy, and represent his father at various official ceremonies.

Among other mem- bers were Bossuet, Fenelon, and Marshal de Villars. 2 Motteville, Memoires, iv. 103. 12 CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION [CHAP, i received him with public rejoicings, and the customary 1 ballets ' or masques in his honour are full of allusions to his scholarship. The Ballet des Sciences et des Arts Liber aux, at Dijon, was a most ponderous affair. Only a prince who had been inured to addresses since the age of four could have endured it patiently at fourteen, and, without flinching, heard himself addressed as : £< Jeune merveille de nos ans Prince qui dementez votre age, Et dont la conduite trop sage N'est sujette a 1'ordre du temps. Prodige du siecle ou nous sommes, Esprit d'ange, qui triomphant Des sciences que font les hommes, En avez fait un jeu d'enfant \". But the true bent of this ' young marvel ' was already acknowledged. Presently there enters a figure repre- senting ' L'Art Militaire ', following the Sciences, of whom she says : \" Mais elles ne se peuvent taire, Jalouses que vous les quittiez ; Et genereux vous yous portez A courtiser 1'Art Militaire \". While in conclusion appears ' M. de Mongey, represen- tant la Mathematique ' ; which in those days included the study of fortification and engineering : \" Louis, c'est a moi seule que tu te dois rendre, Les autres ne font rien que brouiller les esprits, Si tu te donnes a moi je te ferai comprendre Des secrets inconnus, dont tu seras epris \". \" Ne t'amuse done plus qu'aux Sciences utiles ; Ton age le permet, viens apprendre de moi, Comme il faut conquerir et conserver les villes, Quand il faudra servir, et la France, et ton Roi \". To serve France and their King was the avowed object of nearly all the pupils at the Academic Roy ale. Incidentally, they were taught to cultivate social gifts, and polite accomplishments. Fencing and horse- manship were two important items ; taught by a certain ' M. Benjamin ', who had been the professor of Louis xiii. M. le Due was naturally a centre of interest ; his rank and his unique upbringing at first attracted attention ; his personality held it. Before long he was surrounded by a circle of friends, some of 1636] THE ACAD£MIE ROYALE 13 whose names are conspicuous in his later career. Nemours,1 Luynes,2 Fiesque,3 Tavannes,4 and the brothers of Gramont 5 and Senecey ; 6 many who fought by Enghien's side in his early campaigns, facing life, death, and every other possibility, with the same light- hearted, irresponsible courage. The severity of Bourges was soon little more than a memory. Instead of the redoubtable examinations, there were tournaments, once a month, in feats of skill. The Duke writes to his father that he has won a horse, ' un asses joli bidet ' as the prize for tilting. For his studies he devotes himself chiefly to \" the example of those who have been great and wise captains \" ; \" that I may learn by their conduct \", he adds, \" to make myself what you would wish me to be \". The programme of instruction at the Academy shows that physical exercises did not occupy the pupils' whole time. They were required to master \" universal history ; the establishment, decline, and change of the Empires of the world ; the transmigration of races ; the foundation and fall of great cities ; and the state of modern principalities, especially those of Europe \" ; this last an eminently practical study. Among the countless influences which closed round Enghien in his new life, special mention must be given to that of his sister, Anne-Gene vie ve, ' Mademoiselle de Bourbon ' ; she was known by this title until her marriage, five years later, to Henri d'Orleans, Due de Longueville. This marriage is tersely described by one of her relations as \" a cruel fate. He was old ; she was very young, and as beautiful as an angel \"J \" It was impossible to see her \", writes another contemporary, \" without loving her, and wishing to please her \".8 Anne de Bourbon was two years older than her brother. Like him, she had strong intellectual sympathies ; her education with the Carmelites of St Denis had 1 Louis de Savoie, Due de Nemours ; born 1621 ; died of typhus fever, 1641. 2 Louis-Charles d' Albert, Due de Luynes ; born 1620 ; distinguished in action at Arras and elsewhere. 3 Fran9ois de Fiesque, Knight of Malta; killed at Mardyck, 1646. 4 Jacques de Saulx, Comte de Tavannes. 5 Henri de Gramont, Comte de Toulongeon, and Philibert, Chevalier de Gramont, who fought at Fribourg, Nordlingen, and Lens. 6 Henri and Louis de Bauffremont-Senecey ; both killed at La Marfee, near Sedan, 1641. 7 Mademoiselle de Montpensier, Mtmoires. 8 Motteville, Memoires. 14 CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION [CHAP, i been scarcely less serious than his with the Jesuits of Bourges. She was now living with her mother at the Hotel de Conde in Paris, and already the poets were singing her praises. •' L'on jugerait par la beaute De Bourbon, et par sa fraicheur, Qu'elle a pris naissance des lis \"^ Madame la Princesse particularly affected the society of Madame de Sable, Madame de Rambouillet, and others of the inner circle of the ' precieuses ' ; :( the most gifted and witty of the Court, and all those who were most exalted both by birth and by merit \".2 During his schooldays the Duke had seen little or nothing of his mother and sister, whose visits to Bourges had not been encouraged. The Princess was afraid of her husband, but she was none the less fond of her son, and as soon as he was within her reach, she lost no time in establishing intercourse with him. Her advances were vigorously resisted by Father Pelletier, who, instructed by the Prince, was still mounting guard over his pupil. Henri de Bourbon was a jealous parent, with a profound experience of Court manners and customs. He mistrusted all influences not directed by himself ; less on moral grounds than because he was resolved that his son should be no one's tool but his own. In the struggle which followed, M. le Due must have learnt much that was at least as useful to him as the universal history, and transmigration of races, included in the school curriculum. Sometimes Father Pelletier records a victory for himself, giving a lively idea of the methods he used, and the example he set before his pupil. Writing from Paris, in 1637, he said, \" Yesterday M. le Due had a disappointment which he showed \"a good deal. Madame (la Princesse) had sent to ask after him, and had told him secretly that she would send to fetch him, and that he should be amused by a little comedy which was to be played by Mademoiselle his sister, and some others \". The comedy in itself was likely to be harmless, for Mademoiselle de Bourbon, and her friends of the Hotel de Rambouillet, prided themselves extremely on the refined elevation of their sentiments. Father Pelletier, however, agreed with the Principal of the 1 Voiture. 2 Lenet, Memoires. i637] ENGHIEN AND RICHELIEU 15 Academy that the Duke would be better without this amusement. They therefore told him, quite untruly, that the gentleman who was to have escorted him had been taken suddenly ill. To go unattended was out of the question, and the whole scheme had to be given up. This may seem a very trivial incident ; but the moral principles of Bourges were not likely to survive among such surroundings. It was idle to suppose that a prince of Enghien 's age and disposition could be controlled and imposed upon like a child. Dissimulation, he soon found, was a game any number of people could play at ; he wrote submissive letters, promising absolute obedi- ence— and went his own way whenever he could. ' We princes are all cheats ', was the cheerful statement of his contemporary, Duke Charles of Lorraine ; and the Great Conde was not trained to be an exception to the rule. All that the tutor gained, in the end, by his interference, was the undying dislike of Mademoiselle de Bourbon. Father Rapin of Port Royal, writing of her long afterwards, says : \" Her aversion to these (Jesuit) Fathers was caused by the incivility of Father Pelletier, to whom the Prince of Conde, her father, had given the charge of the Due d Enghien \", and who \" had no consideration for the Princess of Conde, her mother, or for herself, when they wished to see the little Duke \". While Enghien was busied in outwitting his teachers and guardians, his future was receiving consideration from the most powerful man in Europe. An influence, directly exercised over him for barely five years, yet second to none in lasting effect, laid hold upon his life on the day when he first found himself face to face with Richelieu. The supremacy of the Cardinal had reached its highest point during these years of Enghien 's early youth. He ruled France and the Court with a rod of iron ; the King was submissive before him, and the Princes abject. Henri de Bourbon was among the most slavish of his followers ; so that when M. le Due took up his abode in Paris, it was a matter of course that, immediately after being presented to the King, he should be sent to pay his respects at the Palais- Cardinal ; \" which he did'*, — so it was said — \" rather more proudly than his father 1.1 The impressions of his childhood and the memory of his uncle's death, were still very distinct. Richelieu, a past master in 1 Lenet, Memoires. i6 CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION [CHAP, i the study of men, observed this new young prince with some attention. What career or position was he likely to create for himself in the future ? What use could be made of him as a political pawn ? Moreover, the Cardinal was considering an arrangement, suggested some years earlier, for the marriage of the Due d'Enghien to a near relation of his own : Claire-Clemence de Maille-Breze,1 his sister's child. Henri de Bourbon had begun his overtures as far back as 1633, when the contracting parties were aged, respectively, twelve and four. He was urged on by the report that Mademoiselle de Breze already had other suitors, and that the Due de la Tremoille was asking her hand for his eldest son. \" Your Highness should be paying court for the marriage of M. le Due to the daughter of the Marechal de Breze \", wrote one of his confidential agents. Richelieu was flattered by the prospect of this almost Royal alliance ; but he sanctioned no formal negotiations till he had taken the measure of his intended nephew-in-law. This done, he made no further objections ; M. le Due satisfied him. The Cardinal was too acute not to see that here was a young man of exceptional character ; one who, at sixteen, was already a person to be reckoned with, and whom it would be well to attach to his own interests as soon as possible. For the moment, he con- tented himself with superintending the choice of the Duke's confessor ; it was his custom to appoint con- fessors for all the principal persons at Court, and to dismiss any spiritual adviser of whom he disapproved. A few months later, the official demand was made by Henri, Prince of Conde, on behalf of his son, to the Marechal-Duc de Breze, for the honour of his daughter's hand. That Enghien, precocious though he was, would offer any serious resistance to their scheme, was an idea which probably never entered the head of either Prince or Cardinal. Nevertheless, it was reported that Richelieu, on his death-bed, declared that M. le Due had given him more trouble than illness or conspirators; u qu'il avoit plus souffert par lui que par ses plaies ou par Cinq-Mars \".2 1 Daughter of Urbain de Maille, Marechal-Duc de Breze, and his wife, Nicole du Plessis de Richelieu. 2 Henri Coiffier, Marquis de Cinq-Mars ; beheaded, as a conspirator against Richelieu, 1642. CHAPTER I I THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU 1638-1642 PIERRE LENET, secretary and confidential agent to the House of Conde, says of M. le Due, that the first years after he left Bourges would have been the happiest of his life, but for the prospect of his marriage to Made- moiselle de Breze. It is not quite clear at what point in the transaction Henri de Bourbon first thought fit to broach the matter to his son. What appears certain is that at no time did he show the smallest sign of consulting his views, or of being guided by his inclina- tions. Enghien, so all good evidence agrees, was violently opposed to the idea, from the moment it was suggested to him. He was barely seventeen ; he did not wish to be married at all ; still less to acquiesce in a scheme for identifying his family interests with those of Richelieu. The Prince, on the other hand, shows himself to have been bent on this profitable con- nection, at all costs. In his letters to the Cardinal are to be found the most unblushing assertions, not only of his own joy and gratitude, but of that of his son and his whole family ; he writes of \" my son, who has the same burn- ing wish that I have, to be allied to you \". Richelieu, secretly no less anxious for the said alliance, gives his consent with dignity, not forgetting to keep up a fiction of the supposed lovers' happiness and devotion ; at the same time setting a lynx-like watch upon M. le Due, of whose real feelings he was soon made perfectly aware . When his course at the Academic Royale was over, in 1638, Enghien was sent from Paris to spend some time as Deputy-Governor for his father at Dijon ; where Lenet, as a councillor in the Parliament of Burgundy, saw him often, and intimately. He reports that \" the 18 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n repeated suggestions of his marriage to Mademoiselle de Breze were causing the Duke mortal anxiety \" ; and that \" the more he was urged, the more he set him- self against the project \". One day, when they were out hunting together, he sounded Lenet as to whether open revolt would be possible, and put forward a desperate design, namely, to take refuge from the persecution of his father and the Cardinal in some small fortified place, such as the neighbouring town of Dole, and from there to appeal to the King. He drew no encouragement from his companion ; a shrewd man of business, described by Madame de vSevigne as having wits enough for four~ Yet Lenet himself allows that he would not have discouraged even this forlorn hope, if he had realised ' what just cause for sorrow ' was to come of the marriage. Enghien's position at this time was one of complete dependence on his father ; apart from whom he had absolutely no means of subsistence. He was summarily ordered to pay his court to Mademoiselle de Breze, and had practically no choice but to obey. His letters are patterns of formal affection and dutifulness, since there was nothing to be gained by committing himself to a refusal in writing ; but he contrived, by other methods, to make his reluctance so obvious as to cause Richelieu serious uneasiness. The Cardinal's private letters show clearly enough that he felt the strictest supervision to be necessary. M. le Due had been directed to correspond with his future bride during his absence at Dijon ; and Richelieu writes to Madame Bouthillier, the lady in charge of Mademoiselle de Breze, that he has intercepted one of these letters. \" I had the curiosity to open it \", he says, \" that I might judge of the style. I now send it to you, to fulfil my promise to the bearer, and to satisfy his master, who would be sorry that it should only travel half-way. You will give it, if you please, to my niece \" > The writer of the letter in question was by this time too experienced not to suspect that he was being watched ; he said, no doubt, whatever he can have felt himself expected to say to a child of ten years old, whom he scarcely knew, even by sight. He utterly refused, however, to make any advances, or to show the slightest interest in the poor little bride-elect, except on com- 1 Correspondence de Richelieu, 1638, 1 640] PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS 19 pulsion. At times, when his neglect became so apparent as to excite comment, Richelieu would complain to the Prince, who could always be relied on to call his son to order, and exact some further tributes of consideration. Enghien never failed, in answer, to represent that he was doing all that could possibly be required of him. Nothing could exceed the simplicity or the caution with which he expresses himself ; clear-sighted from his earliest years, he was fast learning to play a part for himself. One of his letters, written in 1640, de- scribes how \" we visited M. le Cardinal, who did us much honour, and told me that he was satisfied with me, and that he thought you would be, too ; he spoke to me a great deal of the siege,1 and asked me ques- tions, which I answered as well as I could. After that he asked me if you were coming here, and what I was ?oing to do. I told him I thought that both you and would always do as he wished. Then I asked him for news of Mademoiselle de Breze ; he told me that she was well, and that I did her honour by remembering her. After that I went away \",2 — leaving behind him, no doubt, a very clear impression of outward civility and inward dislike. Strange as it may seem, Richelieu's ardour for the marriage was in no way lessened by this almost open antagonism. On the contrary, the more he realised the Duke's force of character, the more he resolved to secure him to himself. He made opportunities for cultivating his acquaintance, and spoke in high praise of his brilliant qualities, seeing in him a social as well as a political power of the future. His military renown can hardly at that time have been foreseen, even by Richelieu. As regards social gifts, M. le Due was cer- tainly not endowed with beauty like that of his sister ; his thin face, fierce large eyes, and immense aquiline nose, were almost grotesque, in certain aspects. \" The face of an eagle \", was the unanimous verdict of his contemporaries. Moreover, he himself cared nothing for his looks ; he was notoriously untidy, and sub- mitted reluctantly to the elaborate Court fashions of his time ; though it was acknowledged that he had 1 la mine haute ' and ' 1'air d'un grand prince ', and knew how to appear in them to great advantage. In figure he was very slight, but perfectly proportioned, 1 The siege of Arras, June-August, 1640. a A.C., 1640. 20 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n and conspicuously active and graceful ; his skill in dancing, not less than in riding, and other exercises, was a theme of constant admiration. His mental powers were beyond dispute ; friends and enemies alike testify to them. One of his officers,1 in a strictly impartial portrait, declares that the Duke's clearness of mind, force of judgment, and ease in expressing himself, were unsurpassed. No one could be a more thoroughly entertaining companion than he, when it suited his purpose ; and a lively sense of humour, coupled with an unsparing tongue, caused him to be feared in certain circles where he was by no means loved. Already he had found a congenial atmosphere in the society of the Hotel de Rambouillet ; and throughout his stay at Dijon he kept up a correspond- ence, in verse, with several members of that celebrated clique : \" Or, sachez, Monseigneur, que chacun vous renonce, Si, ce paquet rec.u vous ne faites reponce, Et si vous n'exprimez avec de beaux vers Des dames de Dijon les entretiens divers \" ; — the quotation is from a joint letter, signed ' Servi- teurs et Servantes ', and dated. \" Ecrite trois mois avant Juillet, Dedans 1'hotel de Rambouillet \". Popular, in a wider and more general sense, Enghien was not, and never would be ; he lacked sympathy with the crowd, and had none of the ready good-nature which could act as a substitute. His power over others lay in certain vivid characteristics ; in his energy, mental and physical ; above all in the personal courage, touched with inspiration, which made his presence exhilarating, though it was not often genial. When he appeared for a time in Paris, in 1640, all the younger nobles at Court accepted le Due as their leader ; they followed him, admired him, and imitated him, till it seemed, naturally enough, to Richelieu as to others, that here indeed would be a valuable partisan. But the Duke had other qualities, less easy to reckon with. Nature and circumstances, between them, had launched 1 Roger de Rabutin, Comte de Bussy-Rabutin, member of the Aca- demic Fran9aise, well known as a writer of memoirs, and of the ' chroniques scandaleuses ' of the time. 1 640] MADEMOISELLE DE BREZE 21 him on the world with few ideals, little or no belief in his fellow-creatures, and a very highly-strung nervous system, which his education had done nothing to im- prove. Throughout his life he was unaccountable and headstrong as an ally ; while as an instrument he was already almost beyond control, as Richelieu was perhaps the first to discover. Henri de Bourbon lost no opportunity of atoning for his son's deficiencies as a suitor. He visited Mademoiselle de Breze, who was a shy and rather backward little girl ; and told her, with many compli- ments, that she should be ' dame et maitresse ' in his house. When all the preliminary negotiations had been concluded, he insisted on Enghien's paying her a visit of ceremony, and did his utmost to display him in the part of the devoted lover. On their arrival, the attendants would have brought forward a chair of state for M. le Due, but the Prince waved it away ; 1 That is not the place for a servant \", he said ; \" go and sit on a little stool beside your mistress \". To make Enghien ridiculous — Enghien who never failed to detect the smallest absurdity in those around him — was to put the final touch to the situation. He could not disobey ; his rage and humiliation were forced to concentrate themselves into a steady dislike of the unoffending bride, whose only wish and object was to obey her orders. Claire-Clemence de Maille-Breze had none of the attributes likely to appeal to a cultivated and ambitious young prince of eighteen ; one whose domestic qualities, if they existed at all, had certainly never been developed in any direction. She was small and childish, even for her age, and gave no striking promise of beauty or brilliancy for the future. Mis- fortune seems to have pursued her through life, in small things as in great. She was not without sterling gifts of character ; but nothing could redeem the fact of her insignificance, especially in a circle where self- assertion was the rule. Her many sorrows did not command much sympathy from the world she lived in. The privilege of marrying a Prince of the Blood was held to compensate for almost any degree of adversity ; she had at least, as was said in all good faith, \" the honour of sharing the misfortunes of M. le Prince \".1 At this early stage of her promotion she was innocently 1 Motteville, M6moires, iii. 230. 22 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n pleased and flattered by her unexpected importance, and much impressed by her fiance, in spite of his ungracious- ness. Her obedience was a matter of course, since the Due de Breze readily gave his consent. The only dissentient voice among the relations, on either side, seems to have been that of Madame la Princesse. One of the Prince's confidential messengers, who had been dispatched to tell her of the final decision, reported that she was a good deal concerned over Mademoiselle de Breze's very small stature. But she was too well trained to submission not to \" desire nothing so much as the fulfilment of the Prince's wish \", and only ventured to express a hope \" that M. le Due might find satisfaction in the marriage, since it was a matter that would affect his whole life \".1 The agreement as to the marriage, ratified by the King's consent, was no sooner made public than Richelieu emphasised it by taking his future nephew ostentatiously under his protection. He was entirely of Father Pelletier's opinion as to a mind that required occupation, and his first step was clearly to Enghien's advantage. He persuaded the Prince to send him on active service. The Thirty Years' War, just entering on its later stages, was a school of arms in which many of ' Benjamin's ' pupils completed their education. Since France had been drawn into hostilities, in 1635, the Spanish forces on the northern and southern frontiers, and the Austrian Imperialist army towards the east, had provided an outlet for the superfluous energy of the kingdom almost as effectively as the early Crusades. Richelieu's attention, at this moment, was chiefly engaged by the Spaniards in the north. \" I think \", he writes, \" that you will not wish this campaign, now opening, to pass without M. le Due taking some part in it, and that you should allow him to see it, in the company of the oldest Marshal of France ; who will know best how to teach him what a Prince of his rank ought to know \". To make matters more urgent, he even told the King, in Enghien's presence, that M. le Due was too old to be left idle, and that he ought to be with the army. There can be no doubt that the Duke asked nothing better. He was at once enrolled among the ' yolontaires ', — a volunteer corps of a strictly exclusive kind, in which most young men of good family made 1 A.C., 1640. 1 640] ENGHIEN'S FIRST CAMPAIGN 23 their early campaigns, and placed under the charge of the Marechal-Duc de la Meilleraye, a commander whose merits, as a cousin of the House of Richelieu, out- weighed the fact that he was by no means the oldest Marshal of France. Serving in the same company were many of Enghien's closest friends ; Gesvres,1 a young man of high character and exceptional promise ; Nemours, \" a handsome prince, full of intelligence and courage \", but one whose influence was greatly mis- trusted by M. le Due's confessor ; and Gaspard de Coligny,2 already renowned for his daring and his accomplishments. Among the senior officers, the Duke's chosen companion was that distinguished soldier and courtier, Antoine de Gramont, Comte de Guiche,3 who afterwards served him faithfully in the severe campaigns of Fribourg and Nordlingen, and whose disposition ' for wit and cheerful humour ' he found peculiarly accept- able. As for the moral principles of the Comte de Guiche, they were emphatically those of his time and condition. M. le Due took no exception to them; the society of the burghers of Dijon having only heightened his appre- ciation of the company in which he now found himself. The principal achievement of the campaign of 1640, on the northern frontier, was the taking of Arras by the French, after a seven weeks' siege ; in the course of which, Enghien accomplished his first exploits or ' premieres armes '. A young Gascon gentleman, the Comte de Chavagnac, who was present in the camp, tells of the Duke's arrival, on the staff of La Meilleraye, and of the honours done him ; how the ' maitre de camp ' appointed him (Chavagnac) and three others to act as an informal body-guard to M. de Due ; and what a lively occupation they found it. \"It must be owned \", he says, \" that the young prince taught us, from the first, to expect nothing short of master- strokes \". As the weeks passed, the besieging army suffered almost as much from want as the inhabitants within the walls. Their supplies were constantly cut off by an outer ring of the enemy's force ; till pro- visions became so scarce that, according to Chavagnac, the infantry officers used to sleep at night under the 1 Louis-Fran9ois-Potier, Marquis de Gesvres, killed at Thionville, 1643. 2 Afterwards Due de Chatillon ; born 1620 ; killed at Charenton, 1649. 3 Born 1604 ; Marshal of France, 1642 ; Due de Gramont, 1644 ; died 1678. 24 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n General's table, to make sure of rinding a place there in the morning. La Meilleraye kept the Duke, for the most part, in his own company. \" M. le Marechal obliges me on every possible occasion, and takes very particular care of me\", is Enghien's account to the Prince ; but he was not anxious to be treated differently from his fellow- volunteers, and refused the guard of honour which the authorities would have placed before his lodging. The Marshal, on his side, was not less satisfied with his charge. Personal courage he would probably take more or less for granted, in a Bourbon ; but quickness, and capacity for hard work, he had not looked for. He was lost in astonishment before a Prince who surveyed fortifications for pleasure, and who would scarcely leave the trenches to eat or sleep. His reports prompted a gracious message from Richelieu to Madame la Princesse. \" M. d'Enghien behaves in the army with all the intelligence, judgment, and courage that she could wish \". The same letter describes further how, a few days before, an officer had been wounded, and his horse killed, so near the Duke that he was covered with blood ; and how nothing would induce him to leave M. de la Meilleraye at any dangerous post, however earnestly the Marshal himself might persuade him ; all of which information may have gratified the Princess as much as was intended, and certainly caused her agonies of anxiety. The message concludes with a complacent reference to Mademoiselle de Breze. \" You will also tell Madame la Princesse that war does not prevent his thinking of love ; he is constant to his mistress, and had sent a gentleman with a message to her ; whom I stopped here, though I sent the letter on \". Enghien's own statement regard- ing this sentimental correspondence, in a letter to his father, is as follows : \" I have also written to Mademoi- selle de Breze ; I had not intended that M. de la Roussiere should go as far as Paris ; but M. de Maigrin told me that I should oblige M. le Cardinal extremely by sending him to Mademoiselle de Breze ; which I have done, believing that you would think it best \".l M. de Maigrin, whose name often appears in this connection, was a creature of the Cardinal's, whom he had attached to the Duke for the express purpose of observing him, and prompting the necessary civilities. 1A.C., 1640. 1 640] SIEGE OF ARRAS 25 Throughout the siege it was the especial joy and pride of the ' volontaires ' to be sent out to meet and protect the convoys of provisions. On these occasions there was always a chance that some sharp fighting would be met with. Enghien himself relates his first experience of the kind ; when La Meilleraye, with 3000 horse, encountered the same number of the enemy, \" whom he charged to so much purpose that we routed them utterly after being engaged with them for more than half an hour \". \" I am greatly obliged to M. d'Estaing\", he continues, \" for he never left me; and to Messieurs de Maigrin and Francine 1 also \". \" Messieurs de Nemours, Luynes, Gesvres, Grancey, and several other volunteers distinguished themselves \". \" We lost fifty men, besides some officers and volun- teers \"* Gesvres was noted in this encounter for leading a charge after he had been severely wounded. Wit- nesses were not wanting who said that M. le Due deserved at least as much credit as some of the friends whose names he mentions. <( He was as much dis- tinguished by his courage as by his rank \", was the opinion of those who could imagine no higher compli- ment. Of another skirmish, which occurred a few days later, the Duke again sends an account to his father ; this time, however, not written with his own hand, \" because \" — he says in apology — \" I am very tired, from having slept five nights on the ground, behind the lines, waiting for an attack, and from going to meet the convoy, and from wearing armour for five hours while the fight lasted ; but I have dictated it to Duru just as I saw it \".3 These hardships notwith- standing, it was evident that M. le Due thoroughly enjoyed his surroundings. He was captivated, not only by the actual excitement of battle, but also by the science of war ; here were indeed for him ' Des secrets inconnus, dont tu seras epris '. His letters are full of maps, and plans of fortifications, which he has drawn up. After the surrender of the town he writes that they haye sung a Te Deum ; and in the same breath, \" I will send you the plan (of Arras) as soon as possible ; but I want it to be very exact \". Mademoiselle de Breze was thankfully forgotten ; except when M. de Maigrin insisted on bringing her to mind. 1 Esquire to the Due d'Enghien ; died at Thionville, 1643. 2A.C., July 19, 1640. 3A,C., 1640. 26 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n The capitulation of Arras had one great disadvantage in the eyes of M. le Due. It put an end to campaigning so far as he was concerned, and left him face to face with the prospect of his approaching marriage. All arrangements were being made for the wedding to take place early in the following year. Enghien's feelings on the subject had been well known from the first; so much so, that the Prince's attitude seems to have caused some remark, even in that age of political marriages. Mademoiselle de Montpensier, his cousin, voices the general opinion when she writes of \" M. le Due, who only consented to the affair with great reluctance, and because he was afraid of displeasing his father. He (the Prince) had always kept him at Dijon, giving him nothing, and allowing him no liberty \"-1 It had been decreed that Enghien should not make any stay in Paris till the last moment before the cere- mony ; Richelieu did not feel assured enough of his submission to leave him at the Hotel de Conde, exposed to an atmosphere of culture, romance, and intrigue. But it was not long before the Duke was finally con- vinced that, for the moment, nothing was left to him but acquiescence. He knew that he had, as yet, no friends of his own powerful enough to offer him support in resistance ; even in his household he was surrounded by spies, creatures of his father and of the Cardinal. His personal ambition, and the worldly wisdom of Lenet, worked together till he resigned himself to his fate. Lenet pointed out forcibly that rebellion at this juncture would ruin his hopes of advancement for ever ; that Richelieu could effect- ively prevent his being given any chance of distin- guishing himself in the future. Another Bourbon Prince, the Comte de Soissons, had never prospered since he refused an alliance designed for him in the same quarter. Enghien's objections to the marriage had not been primarily on sentimental grounds ; and he was unwilling to sacrifice his career, — that career of which Arras had given him an enchanting foretaste, — merely for the sake of an aversion to Richelieu and his designs. Nevertheless, as the days went on he became so visibly depressed that a warning was brought to the Cardinal, who immediately sent one of his most intimate agents, the Comte de Chavigny, to make 1 Montpensier, Mlmoives. 1641] MARRIAGE FESTIVITIES 27 observations. Enghien gives his own version of the interview : \"I think I ought to tell you \", he writes to the Prince, \" that M. de Chavigny came to see me yesterday, and sent word that he had something important to say to me ; which was that a gentleman had told him of a rumour that I was opposed to this marriage, and had no liking for Mademoiselle de Breze ; and that it was observed I wore a melancholy face \".x Pride and expediency alike forbade the Duke from admitting as much, now that his mind was made up. \" I told him I had never been more cheerful *\\ The delight of the Prince and the Cardinal in their joint scheme found vent in magnificent preparations for the wedding. One slight and characteristic difficulty occurred when it was discovered that Richelieu, on giving his niece her dowry, had cut her out of his will ; but the Prince, while appearing to yield to this arrangement, secretly prepared a pro- testing document, which he intended to be brought forward at the Cardinal's death. Thus, as a French historian has pointed out, \" each party was convinced that he had deceived the other \", and the harmony was complete.2 The festivities, designed by Richelieu, opened on January i4th, 1641, when the ( fiancailles ' or betrothal ceremony took place in the King's apart- ments, as was the custom for Princes of the Blood. On the same day, at the Palais-Cardinal, before the King and Queen and their whole Court, a dramatic representation was given, followed by a ball. The play was Mirame, written, in part, by no less a person than Richelieu himself ; and the great statesman is reported to have been so well satisfied with his own work as to lead the applause. At the fall of the curtain the stage was cleared, and transformed into a ball- room ; while, by some triumph of ingenuity, a gilded bridge unrolled itself, leading to the box in which the Queen sat, that she might walk down it, to open the ball. M. le Due, the central figure of the day, was her partner ; he bore himself as cheerfully as anyone present, but it was noticed that he looked very white. As for the twelve-year-old bride, her usual ill-luck did not desert her. She had been dressed for the occasion in all the splendour possible, with many jewels, a long 1 A.C., 1640. 2 Homberg et Jousselin, La Femme du Grande Cond6. 28 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, u gown, and a pair of abnormally high heels, which it was hoped would give her dignity. The natural result was that, in dancing a ' courante ', she tripped and fell headlong, while the whole company laughed, — not excepting the bridegroom, who was little disposed to consider her feelings, and felt himself still further aggrieved by her awkwardness. None of the guests were inclined to make much allowance for a child, her uncle's niece, who had been brought straight from the country to make a marriage which a Princess would not have despised. The Prince, her father-in-law, alone felt bound to take up a more encouraging line ; he went from one to another extolling her, and ex- claiming dutifully, ' Est-elle assez jolie ! ' Another entertainment, not less impressive, was given to cele- brate the signing of the marriage contract, on February 9th. Here a most elaborate allegorical ballet was arranged, having for its subject l La Prosperite des Armes de la France '. All the youth of the Court took part in this performance, which was also adorned by \" the finest mechanical contrivances that had ever been seen in France\".1 M. le Due appeared in two of the figures. In the first he represented Jupiter descending from the heavens, by means of one of these marvellous ' machines '. In the second, he took the part of a demon. This latter role was particularly successful ; he played it \" with an air, an enjoyment, and a grace, which gave him the advantage over all the others \". The Cardinal's gratification knew no bounds. \" His Eminence was never seen in better humour \", — so Henri Arnauld, Bishop of Angers, writes to his friend Barillon ; \" he made everyone dance, even Madame d'Elbeuf the Dowager, the good lady of Ventadour, and Madame la Chancelliere \".2 Of Henri de Bourbon, Arnauld adds, \" Monseigneur le Prince fit merveille \". Among such rejoicings the marriage contract was signed of the \" Treshault et puissant Prince, Mon- seigneur Louis de Bourbon, Due d'Anguien, Pair de France\", and \" Mademoiselle Claire Clemence de Maille de Breze, fille d'Urbain de Maille de Breze, Marechal de France \". The document gives an imposing list of those \" present in their persons \" ; headed by the \" treshault tres-puissant et tres excellent Prince, Louis, par la grace de Dieu, Roy de France et de Navarre \" ; who, 1 Lenet, Mtmoires. 2 * MS., Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris. 1 64 1] MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS 29 ' better to make known his pleasure in the said marriage, and the honour of the said Seigneur Due d'Anguien in being of his own Blood and lineage \", gives to the bridegroom a sum of 150,000 ' livres'. The \" tres- illustre et Eminentissime Monseigneur Jean-Armand, Cardinal-Due de Richelieu et de Fronsac \", gives to \" the said lady, his niece \", 300,000 ' livres ', and several estates ; the money, it is carefully stipulated, may be employed for paying off ancient debts in the Houses of Conde and Montmorency. The Prince and Princess of Conde give their son 80,000 ' livres/ and the yearly revenue of certain lands ; besides solemnly declaring him the heir of their remaining possessions. Other witnesses whose names find a place in the contract, were the \" Treshault et puissant Prince, Gaston, fils de France, Due d'Orleans, de Chartres, et de Valois \", the King's brother, and the ' Monsieur ' l of the Fronde ; and with him, a deeply-interested spectator, the ' excellent Princess ' his daughter, Anne-Marie-Louise de Bourbon, heiress of Montpensier. ' La Grande Mademoiselle ' was then a lively, high-spirited child of thirteen, who, as some thought, might with advantage have taken the place of the bride. She would certainly not have suffered from any lack of self-confidence. Two days later the same Royal guests attended the blessing of the marriage in the private Chapel of the Palais-Cardinal. Compared with the signing of the contract this ceremony was passed over very quietly ; scarcely anything is recorded of it, beyond the fact of its having taken place. Viewing the circumstances, it was perhaps appropriate that the religious element should not be made too prominent. ! This was M. le Due's last appearance in public for many weeks. It appeared that he had caught cold during one of the rehearsals for the ballet ; and the result, joined, as it was freely said, to the vexation caused him by his marriage, was an illness so serious as to endanger his life. For a time it seemed as though he might never be the subject of any further political 1 Saint-Simon (ed. Cheruel, vii. 160-170) makes an exhaustive digression on the Court titles of ' Monsieur ' (brother of the King), ' Madame ' (wife of Monsieur), ' Mademoiselle ' (eldest unmarried daughter of Monsieur), and others of the same kind, which came into use during the seventeenth century. He attributes them to no historic origin, and affirms that, \" distinguished though they seem, they have neither foundation nor ad- vantages, and arose only by chance \". 30 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n designs. Richelieu, who had been building on their relationship, and to whom the Duke's death, at that moment, would have been a heavy blow, showed great anxiety about him. Arnauld writes that \" His Emin- ence arrived (in Paris) this evening, and went instantly to see Monseigneur d'Enghien, who is very ill ; the doctors do not despair of him\".1 Such haste was evidently looked on as a mark of almost awe-inspiring consideration. Enghien, however, was in too prostrate a condition to be much impressed, even by a visit from the Cardinal in person. His illness seems to have been not unlike a severe form of the modern influenza, and was complicated by such acute depression of spirits that his doctors, — who belonged to an age when nervous cases were not recognised, — began to fear that his brain was permanently injured. A month from the date of Arnauld 's letter, Bourdelot, one of these doctors, writes to the Prince that \" M. le Due can now go into another room for two or three hours every afternoon \".2 A few days later, he is able \" to go and watch the horses in the riding school\"; and writes himself protesting that he is perfectly well, but for ' une foiblesse aux jambes '. At the same time the medical report complains that he would still speak to no one, and steadily resisted all attempts to amuse him. Above all, he was made miserable by the news that a fresh campaign was opening on the frontier, and \" by listening to the pre- parations for war, when he himself had no hope of taking part in it\".3 His only distraction was to hear the ponderous romances and histories of the time read aloud, from morning till night. A list of the volumes supplied to M. le Due during his illness and con- valescence, gives some idea of the hours that must have been thus occupied ; it includes Romant de VAriane (in twelve books), Romant d'Albanie, Romant de I'lndamire, Romant de Melusine ; besides eight books of Histoire Africaine, Stratonice, and Bacon's History of Henry VII. Bourdelot states further that he cannot say whether the continual reading really occupied his patient's mind, or whether he only made it serve as an excuse for not speaking. Towards the end of April, Enghien 's energetic 1 * MS., Bibliotheque Nationale. 2 A.C., Bourdelot to Henri, Prince of Conde, 1641. 8 Lenet, Memoires. 1641] ENGHIEN AT MERLOU 31 temperament at last asserted itself, and he grew sud- denly better ; his friends were made welcome again ; he \" talked and laughed with as good a grace as before he fell ill \", and showed that \" his powers of reasoning were stronger than ever \".1 Questioned by his doctors, he admitted that only the first ten days of his illness were quite distinct in his mind. Of the days that followed, he assured them that he had nothing but a confused memory ; and although, for the greater part of the time he had had no fever, yet he could not so much as recall some of the delusions from which he was told he had suffered. Bourdelot records all these impressions in a letter to the Prince ; showing that, however unimpaired the Duke's intellect might be, his nervous organisation was at no time one to be trifled with. On Ascension Day (May, 1641) M. le Due was suffi- ciently recovered to assist at the full length of the ceremonies in Notre-Dame ; where he was seen by the whole congregation, \" while everyone blessed God for his health \". The yearly campaign on the northern frontier was not too far advanced for him to join La Meilleraye at the siege of Aire ; and the Cardinal, as a sign of goodwill and joy at his recovery, presented him with two horses and a suit of armour before he set out. But, as it proved, the Duke's second campaign offered small chance of distinction to anyone engaged in it ; and in a few weeks it became evident that his health was still unequal to much strain. Soon after the capitulation of the town, Richelieu writes to the Prince that \" the fear lest M. d'Anguien might fall ill obliged me to ask him to go and drink the waters of Forges\". The Cardinal undertakes entire direction of his nephew's movements, and orders him from Forges to Paris and finally to join his wife at Merlou, a country estate of the Montmorency family. Here they were detained for some time, as the little Duchess fell ill of small-pox. M. le Due writes to his father, announcing that \" la petite yerole est venue a ma fame \" ; but that the attack is very slight, and the doctor assures them that Madame la Duchesse will not be marked. Merlou, and his wife's society, did not offer an enlivening prospect to the Duke. Later in the autumn he urges a request for fresh instructions, adding suggestively 1 A.C., Montreuil to Henri, Prince of Conde, April 23, 1641. Montreuil was the second doctor in attendance on the Duke. 32 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n that the Duchess has been quite recovered for more than a month ; and \" now that the weather is cold the country begins to be very disagreeable for ladies 'V Henri de Bourbon did not regret an excuse for keeping his son away from the society and influence of the Court. He feared nothing so much as that Enghien, once given the opportunity, might use his undoubted gifts to create an independent position for himself. \" Believe me, a life in Paris, in the absence of M. le Cardinal and myself, is most harmful to him \", he writes to Richelieu's secretary ; and he was warmly seconded, on moral grounds, by the Duke's confessor, Father Mugnier, who pronounced uncompromisingly, \" Le sejour a Paris, et a 1'hostel de Conde, ne vaut rien du tout a Monseigneur le Due \". Enghien, to judge by his letters, was still all submission in words ; but it did not take him long to discover that he might now be able to raise a few difficulties for his uncle-in-law. The correspondence between Richelieu and the Prince begins to show some slight misgivings as to how far their authority might extend. Already the Cardinal had found the system of spies failing him. Maigrin, his chief agent in the Duke's household, was not only a man of low character but an unskilful tactician. He had not the intelligence necessary for deceiving M. le Due ; who, having once found him out, made a practice of misleading him by fictitious confidences. Strife was inevitable, in such an establishment, between Enghien's own retainers and the hired informers who were thrust in amongst them ; and a climax was reached when Maigrin fell in a duel by the hand of one Damours, a former servant of the Prince, and now the Duke's ' maitre-d 'hotel '. No one accused Enghien of con- nivance ; but, while expressing polite concern over the incident, he took no measures for delivering up Damours to justice. Richelieu wrote indignant letters, com- plaining of the \" great disorder, and want of dignity, in the household of M. le Due \". He was, however, sufficiently warned by experience to appoint a new gentleman-in- waiting of a wholly different stamp, as successor to Maigrin. Cesar de Cotentin, Comte de Tourville, seems to have been one of the very few upright men chosen to associate with Enghien in his youth ; he won the Duke's confidence, and tried 1A.C., November, 1641. 1641] THE DUKE'S HOUSEHOLD 33 honestly to keep him from offending the Cardinal past all forgiveness. Possibly Richelieu might have taken the fate of Maigrin less to heart if he had had reason to be satis- fied with his nephew on other grounds. But a more serious and deeply-seated grievance than any dispute concerning the household, was M. le Due's persistent and open neglect of his wife. On this point the Car- dinal found himself, for a time, quite powerless. Enghien had so far prevailed with his relations that the Hotel de Rocheguyon was now granted to him for a residence in Paris. The Prince, unwillingly persuaded into this further expense, had fitted his son's house with \" the meanest possible decorations \" ; which Richelieu supplemented by lending furniture of his own. Here the Duke and Duchess were no sooner established, in a style ' plus propre que magnifique ', than Enghien began to take the place for which he was well qualified, at Court and in society. As a sign of growing independence, he now attended the more im- portant debates in Parliament ; he sent messages of condolence or congratulation on his own account to other princes whenever etiquette demanded it ; also he made a point of receiving men of letters, ' very agree- ably ', in his own house.1 The Duchess, on the other hand, was scarcely seen in public at all ; her husband ignored her, and his family, for the most part, followed his example. Henri de Bourbon, who might otherwise have protected her interests, was conducting a cam- paign in Roussillon ; and it was evident that the Duke would take commands from no one else. Madame la Princesse, in spite of her husband's example, showed no inclination to take up the cause of her daughter-in-law ; being, indeed, not a little bored by her company, and inclined to sympathise with her son. Her own circle, where she delighted to welcome him, included all the most celebrated figures from the * salons ' of the time ; men and women whose accomplishments and adventures have filled volumes. Not the least conspicuous of her intimate friends was Marie de Gonzagne, Duchesse de Nevers, afterwards Queen of Poland, the heroine of Cinq-Mars' romance. Foremost among the orthodox ' precieuses ' who adorned the Princess's coterie were Madame de Ram- 1 Lenet, Memoires, 34 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n bouillet 1 and her daughter Julie ; 2 of the latter, Talle- mant des Reaux asserts that \" no woman's beauty had been so much praised by poets since the days of Helen of Troy\". Next to these, Madame de Sable3 was perhaps, more than any other, the presiding genius. She was the promoter of all the most exalted ideas of Jove, chivalry, and friendship, in the high-flown style known as the ' genre Espagnole ' ; and as, in the words of one who knew her, \" she was able to give weight to her sentiments by her intelligence, as well as by her beauty, she gained great authority \".* It must be owned that this authority did not reach beyond matters of conversation ; her theories were more discussed than practised, by the majority of her listeners. Cor- neille was the great writer of this coterie ; Voiture, Benserade, and Sarrazin, the minor poets. Mademoiselle de Scudery has drawn most of its members in her once famous romance of Le Grand Cyrus. The original of the Great Cyrus himself is none other than the Great Conde, as he appeared in early life ; and his companions- in-arms at Rocroy, Fribourg, and Nordlingen, may be recognised under such disabling titles as ' Tigrane ', ' Art abase ', ' Adusius ', and ' Artibie '. There, too, were the beauties of a younger generation than Madame de Sable* ; Mademoiselle de Bourbon and her friends ; her two cousins, Marie-Louise and Isabelle de Mont- morency-Boutteville,5 and the sisters Anne and Marthe Poussart de Fors du Vigean. Isabelle de Montmorency and Marthe du Vigean rivalled, or it was even said surpassed, Anne de Bourbon in loveliness and charm. Madame la Duchesse was not likely to shine in their society ; she who — so Mademoiselle de Montpensier asserts — \" was so childish that, two years after her marriage, she still played with dolls and was despised and ill-treated by the whole family of Monsieur son mari \". The young men, surnamed, collectively, ' les damoiseaux ', who were privileged to flirt, and play intellectual games, within this exclusive circle, were 1 Catherine de Vivonne, daughter of the Marquis de Pisani ; married Charles d'Angennes, Marquis de Rambouillet. 2 Julie d'Angennes ; born 1607 ; married 1645, Charles de Sainte- Maure, Due de Montausier. 3 Madeleine de Souvre ; born 1602 ; married Philippe de Laval-Mont- mo rency, Marquis de Sable. 4 Motteville, Memoires. 5 Daughters of Fra^ois de Montmorency, Comte de Boutteville, the famous swordsman who was beheaded for duelling, 1627. 4 i64i] \" LES DAMOISEAUX \" 35 not unworthy of the honour. Two of their number, — Enghien himself, and the young cousin who was after- wards known as the Due de Luxembourg,1 ' le tapissier de Notre-Dame ', — lived to take rank among the greatest soldiers of their time. Beside them were many who are extolled by their contemporaries for their courage, no less than for their good looks, but whose promise of youth was not to be fulfilled ; Coligny, Laval,2 Pisani,3 Chabot,4 La Moussaye,5 and others \" who died in their glory, and never were old \". Of the two brothers Coligny, Maurice,6 the elder, was the devoted admirer of Mademoiselle de Bourbon ; Gaspard, of Isabelle de Montmorency. Enghien himself, in spite of a reputa- tion for heartlessness, had developed a romantic passion for Marthe du Vigean, a girl of eighteen, surpassingly beautiful, and who, almost alone among Madame de Sable's disciples, had actually made the principles of the ' genre Espagnole ' a rule of life. Richelieu, hearing of this most definite peril, immediately decided that Enghien must stay in Paris no longer. For the moment it was useless to expect any consideration from him towards Madame la Duchesse. The Hotel de Roche- guyon was closed. The Duchess was sent to school, to the Carmelites of St. Denis ; and the Duke to pass some months under the personal supervision of the Cardinal at Narbonne and at Bourbon, where it was not long before a fresh cause of disturbance arose. This last, and most obstinate, encounter between the prince of twenty and the statesman of fifty-eight, was brought about by a matter, apparently trivial, but capable, at that date, of arousing the strongest feelings of all concerned. The point at issue was whether a Cardinal, — a Prince of the Church, — was justified, as such, in taking precedence of a Prince of the Blood. Richelieu's own position was independent ; by virtue 1 Frai^ois de Montmorency-Boutteville, son of the Comte de Boutteville.

But when it appeared that an order had been issued, by which he was required to give way to the ' Eminences ', all and sundry, who congregated under Richelieu's roof at Narbonne, he refused to submit. It was here that his future enemy, Mazarin, then the newest of Cardinals, first crossed his path. \" Cardinal Mazarin has obtained an order from the King to pass before Princes of the Blood \", so Enghien writes. \" I spoke to M. le Cardinal (Richelieu) about it, but he did not give me a very favourable reply\".1 Richelieu threw all the weight of his influence into the scale in support of the new order ; but M. le Due was firm. To all remonstrances he answered, in terms of polite defiance, \" I will do all that M. le Cardinal tells me to do ; I have no other fervent wish than to obey him in everything ; but I do not believe that he would lay this command on me, against my honour'1. To his father he wrote, less elaborately, — \" I will not give place to him (Mazarin) for an}' orders I have from them, until I have yours \".2 At this crisis even Henri de Bourbon wavered in his allegiance to the Cardinal. The thought that a question which might affect his own rank was at stake, actually forced him into some show of resistance. He succeeded, at length, in arranging a compromise ; but, unfortunately, without consulting M. le Due as to the conditions. Mazarin, at least, was vanquished ; Richelieu undertook that the claim should be waived, and the new order suppressed. In return he demanded that Enghien should recognise his duty as a nephew, by yielding precedence not only to himself, but also to his brother, Cardinal Alphonse du Plessis de Riche- lieu, known as the Cardinal of Lyons ; a man who, apart from his sacred office, had no claim to distinction whatever. As a punishment, this condition was most ingeniously contrived, and quite worthy of its originator. To make certain of its prompt fulfilment, Richelieu pointed out that the Duke, who had been allowed to take part for a few weeks in a somewhat uneventful campaign in Roussillon, would pass by the residence *A.C., 1641 ; the Due d'Enghien to Henri, Prince of Conde. 2 Ibid. 1 642] THE CARDINAL OF LYONS 37 of Cardinal Alphonse on his return ; and would thus have an opportunity of paying him his respects. Word was sent to the Cardinal of Lyons ; who, in his elation at the prospect of being visited by M. le Due, and taking precedence of him in the eyes of all the world, re- furnished his state apartments and prepared a splendid reception. Enghien, when he found what had been undertaken for him, was so thoroughly enraged that he resolved on a deliberate affront. He passed through Lyons, as it had been arranged ; but, to the mingled dismay and amusement of his suite, he absolutely declined to meet Cardinal Alphonse or to set foot inside his house. On this point he was so determined that none of those present dared to argue with him. He lodged with the Archbishop, a member of the Villeroy family, who entertained him very much to his satisfaction ; and an hour or two before his de- parture, the Duke's compliments were sent to his Eminence of Lyons through a gentleman-in-waiting, who, it was reported, delivered the message without much show of reverence. There could be no mis- taking the studied nature of the insult ; and Richelieu, as soon as it came to his ears, was proportionately furious. In vain his attendants tried to calm him by urging excuses for Enghien 's conduct, such as his youth, and the possibility of his having been led away by his companions. Richelieu answered, truly enough, that \" when youth was as enlightened (aussi^esclairee) as in the case of M. le Due, whatever harm he did was done by malice and design \" ; and that as for his companions, none of them had enough power over him to persuade him into such a step against his will. It was not long before he decided on an appropriate revenge. He realised that he could not control the Duke by direct influence ; but he could still control the Prince, his father, whose parental rights had never been disputed. Enghien had made it a principle to recognise no authority but that of a Bourbon greater than himself; either that of the King or of the head of his own House. Richelieu therefore addressed a letter to Henri de Bourbon — whom he knew to be innocent on this occasion — accusing him of having instigated M. le Due's offence. \" I have great reason to complain of you, since you instructed your son to insult me in my own family, and in my present state \", 38 THE INFLUENCE OF RICHELIEU [CHAP, n he says, referring to the illness from which he never recovered ; \"I hope that God will restore me to such health as will allow me to protect myself against your good- will \". He made it clear that no forgiveness was to be looked for until Enghien had publicly humiliated himself by travelling back to Lyons, and there visiting Cardinal Alphonse, and allowing him to display his right of precedence. Lenet gives a detailed account of the agitation that followed ; how Richelieu, while meditating this vengeance, let the Duke suppose that he was pacified ; how he (Lenet) and Tourville felt convinced that this was not the end of the matter, and did their utmost to induce Enghien to make some amends of his own accord, telling him plainly, \" Monseigneur, on vous trompe \". They suggested, among other expedients, that he might go to hunt a stag at Rimi, in Bresse ; and once there, as they said, he could easily \" go some fine morning to visit the Cardinal of Lyons, and swallow the pill with a good grace \". Enghien, though under no illusions as to Richelieu's pretended friendship, maintained that he had no intention of going to Lyons at all ; but that if he were to choose, he would rather be driven to it by force than appear to do it of his own free will. Driven to it by force he was, in the end, though not without a last struggle. The Prince, terrified by open signs of displeasure, came himself to Bourbon to fetch his son; he conducted him per- sonally as far as Chalons, and saw him embarked, ' in the worst possible weather,' on the river Saone, en route for Provence, where the Cardinal of Lyons had now withdrawn himself. \" Those who knew the Duke, and his high spirit \", says Lenet, \" will have no difficulty in believing that all the authority, all the prayers, and all the threats of the Prince, were necessary to persuade him \". He sought out Cardinal Alphonse and gave him the coveted precedence ; dined with him, | very sorrowfully ', and returned to join his father at Dijon. Henri de Bourbon may well have felt that his parental authority would not often be equal to so severe a strain. He was said to have regretted the humiliation he had forced upon his son when, on the very night of Enghien 's return, the news was brought to them that Richelieu's life was despaired of. Yet he was still so far in the dying minister's power as to 1642] DEATH OF RICHELIEU 39 carry out one more of his wishes. Enghien was sent back to Paris, and there was so far wrought on, by his father's orders, as to arrive at a temporary reconcilia- tion with his wife. Close on two years had passed since their marriage, and Madame la Duchesse could no longer be treated as a child . She had benefited, both in mind and person, by her education at St. Denis; and the Duke, though by no means an affectionate husband, ceased, for a time, to behave towards her with studied neglect. Richelieu lingered for some weeks, and died on December 4th, 1 642 . His death gave unquestioned relief to Henri de Bourbon, and to many others who had lived under his yoke for the last twenty years. Even Louis xin, who was already far advanced in his last illness, and had only a few months to live, declared that now at last he felt himself a King. His subjects, from the Queen downwards, showed frankly that they too felt themselves delivered from an oppressor. The people of Paris gave vent to their satisfaction in ballads and songs, describing the Cardinal's triumphant re- ception in the infernal regions : \"A la moiti6 du chemin, Caron lui donna la main : ' Passez, le plus grand monarque, Qui fut jamais dans ma barque '. Arrive dedans ce lieu, Croyant etre a Richelieu, Les diablotins, tous en garde, Mirent bas leurs hallebardes \". l ' II est passe ', they sang joyfully. But his influence remained ; not less over Enghien 's future than over the destinies of France. He had done much, in a short space, to ruin the Duke's character in private life ; the enforced marriage, together with the example of per- petual spying, self-seeking, and deceit, could not but have the most disastrous results, from a moral point of view. On the other hand, there can be little doubt that it was Richelieu who prepared a way for the truly magnificent opening of Enghien 's public career. Almost with his last breath he advised the King to appoint M. le Due as Commander-in-Chief of the army on the northern frontier ; an instruction which was punctually fulfilled, although the decision was not made known until after the Cardinal's death, 1 * \" Receuil de Chansons \", MS., A.C. CHAPTER I I I ROCROY 1643 ENGHIEN'S appointment to command the ' army of the North ' was proclaimed by Louis xm in February, 1643. The announcement, it must be owned, was received at first with doubtful approval. The new General was twenty-one years old ; he had served as a volunteer in three campaigns, not one of which was of first-rate importance. In the last of these, at the siege of Perpignan, he had been the leader of a corps of ' gentilshommes volontaires ' ; but this was, literally, the only responsible military post which had, so far, fallen to his share. He had never seen a pitched battle ; all his practical experience of warfare had been gained in skirmishing and in besieging frontier towns. Such sudden promotion was hardly usual, even at that date, except in the case of a Royal Prince ; and Enghien, Bourbon though he was, could not claim the privileges of the reigning House. The drawbacks of the situation were so obvious, that not even the King's sanction could remove them altogether ; it was urged by more than one member of the Council that the Duke was too young, and also that his advancement would throw more power than could be tolerated into the hands of the Prince, his father. Mazarin, who had succeeded Richelieu in the Ministry, made a point of supporting the King's choice ; he was anxious to conciliate the House of Conde, and it was partly owing to his repre- sentations that the original scheme held good. He agreed, however, as a concession to prudence, that a cautious veteran, the Marshal de THopital,1 should be nominated as Enghien 's Lieutenant-General ; with a stipulation that \" M. le Due was to be guided by him 1 Frangois de 1'Hopital, Sieur du Hallier ; born 1583 ; died 1660. 40 1643] THE ARMY OF THE NORTH 41 in all matters \". L'Hopital's baton had been a reward for the length rather than the brilliancy of his services ; he was deliberate in his methods, and possessed of no great force of character. If Mazarin seriously expected him to exercise a controlling power over the Duke, it can only be supposed that he knew little of either of them. Next to L'Hopital in rank among Enghien's officers, and far more likely to inspire him with confidence, was the ' Maitre de camp general ', Jean de Gassion, Huguenot and Gascon ; now in his thirty-fourth year, and with eighteen years of military experience behind him. A true soldier of fortune, he had served Gustavus Adolphus and Duke Bernard of Weimar, not less than his own sovereign ; and was renowned as the greatest plunderer, or ' degatier ', in the whole French army. Gassion was not often seen at Court ; he had scarcely an idea apart from his profession. It was told of him that Louis xin had one day commanded him to be present at High Mass in the Royal Chapel ; and had asked him afterwards what he thought of the music. \" Sire \", answered Gassion in all good faith, \" six drummers and six trumpeters would have made far more noise \". But if he failed in polite accomplish- ments, in his own sphere he was invaluable ; his promptness, audacity, and resource had been proved at every point of an adventurous career. He was already known to Enghien ; their first meeting had been at Arras. Gassion 's rank in the army was that of ' marechal de camp ' ; but his present post of ' maitre de camp general ' was allowed to carry with it a certain degree of supremacy over any other such ( marshals ' with whom he might serve. This office of ' marechal de camp ' ranked immediately below that of a Lieutenant- General ; but a modern authority, the Due d'Aumale, has explained the vagueness with which the term was sometimes applied. \" These General officers\", he says, \" had no fixed duties, and not even a clearly-defined grade. They were given such temporary employment as the command of a detachment or of some point of attack during a siege, or of a certain number of troops in action\". They had also the right to a voice in the council of war. Their title must not be confused with that of a ' Marshal of France ', which exalted station 42 ROCROY [CHAP, in was occupied in the ' army of the North ' by L'Hopital alone. Claude de Leto"
