A perspective on the progression of peoples and cultures that contributed to the formation of the country throughout most of its long history can only be obtained through artifacts and monuments unearthed at archaeological sites. The purpose of this book is to assist the traveller, the visitor to France, or the non-travelling but curious individual, with the location and condition of archaeological sites, and to place these in a meaningful historical context. Many sites, a Roman city, for example, may have a number of specific sights such as an aqueduct, theatre, forum and baths. These are listed so that the reader may determine exactly what is to be seen. Some site plans are included here, but they are nearly always available at the locations in question or from the S.I. (Syndicat d’Initiative, or Office of Tourism) in the nearest town. Most tourist books on France devote some space to the ancient monuments such as the megalithic alignments at Carnac or the Roman ruins at Nîmes. This guide also directs the traveler to hundreds of other lesser known, or “underdiscovered” sites, not found in the usual guidebooks. Part I: “Historical Background” briefly describes the various epochs of human development that shared in the shaping of France from the earliest traces down to the Carolingian period in the tenth century A.D. when the formative years had nearly run their course. Part II: “Sites and Sights” introduces the regions of the country and describes places of interest. The appropriate department is shown beside the name of the town or village where the site is situated, and locations are determined by reference to the region, the capital city, the department and the nearest town.\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nxi\n\nLooting and wanton destruction of ancient, irreplaceable sites has gone on for centuries and continues today in some unprotected quarters, but in recent years France has generally preserved its historical monuments rather well. Many are fenced and a small admission fee may be charged for upkeep. There are also archaeological parks where historical remains have been left in place and can be viewed along well marked trails. In some ways, the entire country can be thought of as one great museum as one travels through its history physically by road, or vicariously by the pages of this book. New sites are constantly discovered while ongoing excavations continually bring to light new sights. At times, an excavation has been re-covered to protect it from the ravages of weather or from treasure seekers. Under such circumstances, no book on the subject can ever be a definitive statement of all the ancient treasures that France has to offer. Nevertheless, there is a great deal to see, enjoy, and contemplate while travelling the highways and byways of this prodigious land. Preliterate and extinct societies can be defined only by physical remains. This necessarily leads to an incomplete picture, leaving other things such as spiritual values and social relationships in the realm of speculation. From the Romans onward, however, written documentation plays a large role in defining and explaining cultural features of the country.\n\nGEOGRAPHY The 547,026 sq. km of mainland France is roughly hexagonal in shape. It is bounded by Belgium and Luxembourg in the north, Germany across the Rhine River, Switzerland and Italy in the east, the Mediterranean and Spain in the south, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the English Channel in the northwest. Only in the north is there no appreciable natural frontier. The northern and central regions of the country are in the temperate zone while the south––at least the lower-lying land––enjoys a semitropical Mediterranean climate. Further variations of climate and vegetation correspond to the differences in elevation of mountain ranges.\n\nMountains In the east stand the Alps with some of the loftiest peaks in Europe (including Mont Blanc), that form the frontier with Italy and Switzerland. In the southwest, the Pyrenees define the border with Spain. The central Seine basin is surrounded by old mountain ranges: the Vosges to the east rising above the valley of the Rhine River, the Ardennes to the north (mainly in Belgium), the Armorican hills of Brittany to the west and the Massif Central, a mountainous plateau, that dominates the south-central region west of the Rhône River. These are much eroded hills of medium height. Younger mountains, the Jura, the Alps, and the Pyrenees are considerably higher. The remainder of the country is a patchwork of spacious river basins, fertile plains, ridges, hills, marshes and flat land.\n\nBasins and Rivers There are three primary river basins that have attracted people from the earliest times although settlements were separated by great tracts of forests and\n\nxii\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nmarsh. The basin of the Seine, with Paris in its centre, extends throughout the regions of Ile de France, Champagne, Lorraine, Bourgogne, Picardie, and eastern Normandie. To the southwest is the Aquitanian or Garonne Basin of limestone plateaux and fertile valleys, with Bordeaux and Toulouse the major cities. The third great basin is the Rhône-Saône depression opening into the Mediterranean in the south with Lyon and Marseille the principal centres. Of the principal rivers, the Rhône flows southward into the Mediterranean while the Seine, Garonne, and Loire, all of which are fed by numerous tributaries, terminate in the Atlantic Ocean. The Loire is the longest, and enters the sea near Nantes. The Adour joins the Atlantic near Bayonne, the Somme and the Meuse flow into the North Sea and the Moselle into the Rhine.\n\nRegions Within its boundaries, the country contains twenty-one distinct regions, each with its own physical features, separate traditions and history. In three cases— Provence, Bretagne and southern Aquitaine—non-French languages are spoken side-by-side with French, that is, Provençal, Celtic and Basque. Many regions reflect earlier times when they were independent kingdoms, principalities or dukedoms, often at war with one another. They now contain departments formed for administrative purposes that are numbered, and often named after natural features such as mountains or rivers.\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nxiii\n\nxiv\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nPART I\n\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\n1. Appearance of Humans in France Homo habilis, an adroit tool user, emerged from the evolutionary hominid currents of East Africa some two million years ago and appears to have developed into man’s true ancestor, Homo erectus. The latter expanded into the temperate zones of Asia and Europe, and human cultural traces that are evident in France recede through the ages to this common ancestor of Lower Paleolithic times. Remains take the form of primitive stone tools for chopping and scraping, hand-axes, and remnants of animal bones, that is, the leftovers of primitive human meals.\n\nLower Paleolithic Period Paleolithic peoples were nomadic hunter-gatherers in constant search of a food supply and sought out caves and grottos for shelter from the elements. Vallonnet cave near Menton, Alpes-Maritime, discovered in 1958, has yielded human-crafted flakes and pebble tools of the Lower Paleolithic dating back about 900,000 years. The Escale cave (Saint-Estève-Janson) in the Durance valley in southern France, discovered in 1960, contains evidence of the charcoal remains of fires that date perhaps as far back as 750,000 years. Recently, caves and grottos in the Massif Central have yielded further evidence of early humans. The Acheulian is a Lower Paleolithic tool industry first identified at Saint Acheul along the Somme River. Earlier occurrences of Acheulian industry were in Africa some 1.7 million years ago. It eventually spread throughout Europe and was a predominant industry until about 200,000 years ago. This era is characterized by numerous varieties of oval, pointed, and cleaver-edged hand axes. Other sites in France have also yielded artifacts of the Acheulian industries, such as Terra Amata at Nice. This controversial site is reputed to be the oldest constructed shelter known in Europe in which timber poles embedded in the sandy beach were tilted inward to form an oval-shaped hut and perhaps covered with hides and leaves. Stones placed around the base of the poles helped support the structure. The interpretation of the site, placed at around 380,000 years ago, has been challenged by scholars who think too much has been read into the remains of floors surrounded by postholes and stones. Hominids of the time may not have been capable of such sophisticated dwellings. The earliest physical remains include a human tooth found at Vergranne (Doubs), about half a million years old, and the human skull fragments of Tautavel found in the cave of the Caune de l’Arago in the eastern Pyrenees mountains. This prehistoric hunter roved the plains of Roussillon about 450,000 years ago. The cranium appears to forge an evolutionary but controversial link between Homo erectus, Neanderthals and modern humans. The Massif Central is a rich area for early Paleolithic finds. The region was covered with lakes and lush vegetation, and animal life abounded. Volcanic activity promoted the preservation of perishable remains. The area of the Dordogne in southwestern France also had a particular attraction for prehistoric people even during the bitter cold times of severe glaciation. Millions of years ago, this area was covered by a warm sea that left a thick deposit of limestone from the tiny lime-containing marine organisms that lived in it. When the PALEOLITHIC\n\n3\n\nbottom was lifted and the sea disappeared, the exposed limestone plateau was eroded into a maze of bluffs, canyons, caves, and grottos. Shelter for primitive humans was easily accessible, as witnessed by the countless stone tools of early hunters found here. During the period of the early Paleolithic, the north of the country was much less densely populated than the South. Sites there are rare, and human settlements do not appear in any number before the end of the Middle Paleolithic period.\n\nMiddle Paleolithic Period The Middle Paleolithic is associated with Neanderthals, who appeared in Europe as short, stocky, large-headed individuals with a receding chin and pronounced brow ridges. Their habitats demonstrate striking differences from earlier periods, the remains of human skeletons, deliberate burials, more refined tools, and even a few stone and bone engravings being examples. In addition, a kind of bear-cult seems to have been practised, as shown by the careful layout of bear skulls in some of the caves. The subject, however, is controversial, as is the relationship of Homo Neanderthalensis to modern humans. The culture associated with Neanderthals is known as the Mousterian, named after Le Moustier in the Dordogne, where quantities of stone implements have been excavated along with the skeleton of a Neanderthal man. Cave dwelling Neanderthals made regular use of fire and stone flake tools. Fossilized remains dating from over 100,000-30,000 years ago have been found in France at La Chapelle-aux-Saints, near which the remains of an old Neanderthal man were discovered in a cave. A rock shelter at La Ferrassie yielded an adult male and the remains of several children, while a rock shelter at La Quina contained parts of several Neanderthal skeletons. From one site near Fontéchevade in southwestern France came skull fragments about 110,000 years old. Sites associated with the Middle Paleolithic period are also found in the south of France, and at the cave of Hortus, where broken and charred human bones of some twenty individuals, mixed with other animal bones and foodrefuse, suggest that some Neanderthals may have served as a meal for others. If Neanderthals living in the area of present-day France had any inclination toward the symbolic or artistic, the evidence is sparse. In the cave of Pech de l’Azé in the South, a bone with a hole drilled through it may have been a sort of amulet. An ox rib from the same site bears scratches in groups of two on one side: these do not appear to be marks left from cutting away the flesh.\n\nUpper Paleolithic Period The Upper Paleolithic witnessed the advent of Homo sapiens (technically Homo sapiens sapiens), and the sophisticated development of cave and mobile art along with more precise tools. Sometimes, the term Cro-Magnon is used to designate the people of this period. These modern people became installed in Europe some 40,000 years ago and evidence in France—four adults and three children—was first found in the grotto Cro-Magnon near Les Eyzies-de-Tayac in 1868. Since then finds have multiplied. The controversy as to whether or not Homo sapiens was a direct ancestor of the preceding\n\n4\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nNeanderthal type or a separate migratory people out of Africa, is still debated. Cave dwellers of the Upper Paleolithic were different from all those who had gone before. Besides skill in painting, their craftsmanship in working stone, bone, antler, ivory and wood was superior to that of earlier peoples. Useful tools in the 100-plus tool-kit of Cro-Magnon included axes, scrapers, knives, perforators, spear points, stone saws, pounding slabs, needles, barbed harpoon tips, lances, and most importantly the burin or stone chisel, useful in the manufacture of other tools. For a firmer grasp, antler or bone handles were attached to stone tools. Similarly, objects were produced that appear to have had only symbolic and ceremonial value, such as the laurel leaf blade, too delicate for practical use, or the puzzling “bâton de commandement,” a sometimes decorated reindeer antler perforated at one end. People of this period appear to have been the first to discover that flint struck against iron pyrites yielded sparks hot enough to set tinder afire. The Périgord region of the Southwest, much of which falls within the Dordogne, contains numerous Paleolithic sites. The climate at the time was harsh, as the continent of Europe was in the grip of the last ice age, but limestone cave shelters offered protection from the cold, and seasonal migrations of animals provided food. Animal bones from the cave floor of Lascaux indicate that reindeer were the most heavily consumed of the various local quarry. The greatest concentration of upper Paleolithic sites is found in the valley of the Vézère near the village of Les Eyzies. The region is famous for the caves and rock shelters, many of which contain rupestrian (or cave) art.\n\nCave Art Cave art is the most spectacular achievement of the Upper Paleolithic cultures, the most prolific and magnificent examples of which occur in the Franco-Cantabrian region of Europe. More than one hundred decorated caves are known from this area, the majority located in France. The early art in France portrayed on the walls of caves and grottos was painted with vegetable and mineral dyes, such as ochre, and charcoal, sometimes mixed with blood. Others were incised or engraved in the stone. The earliest art forms date back over 30,000 years, to the Aurignacian period and continue through the Solutrean, depicting various kinds of animals. The climax of this artistic activity came in the Magdalenian period about 16,000 to 10,000 years ago, and many of the most important decorated caves are from this era, such as those at Les Combarelles, Niaux, and Font de Gaume. There are several Magdalenian bas-reliefs of animals such as those at Cap Blanc. The magnificent cave paintings at Lascaux in the Dordogne may be a little earlier, but the evidence is still unclear. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal recovered from the cave floor shows occupation of about 17,000 years ago. Homo sapiens of this epoch also sculpted realistic animal figures in horn and bone. The name “mobiliary” or portable art has been given to small figures ranging from a few centimetres to twenty or so, in length. A recent, spectacular discovery was made in the region of Rhône-Alpes among the cliffs of the Ardèche near Vallon-Pont-d’Arc. Paintings of animals (some of which long ago disappeared from the area) portray bison, mammoths, panthers, lions, rhinoceros, hyenas, bear, an owl, horses, aurochs and deer, as CAVE ART\n\n5\n\nwell as symbolic signs and hands in positive and negative. They cover the walls of a 900 meter-long gallery and some are over 30,000 years old. There are more than 300 paintings and many engravings. In spite of the closure of Lascaux, the most famous of all these sites, due to deterioration of the paintings, it is still possible to see many works of prehistoric art in other caves in the Pyrenees and in the valley of the Vézère. A good place to begin is the village of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac\n\n2. Mesolithic Period The Mesolithic Age (10,000-5000 B.C.) is characterized by the transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic period. People were food-gatherers like their ancestors but relatively few remains have yet been found in France other than in Languedoc and Provence. The period took place while the European continent was undergoing climatic changes as the ice sheets (Würm glaciation) covering large portions of the land disappeared. This warming period began about 15,000 years ago and the low levels of the sea gradually rose, separating England from the continent by 6000 B.C. Animals that thrived on the cold weather of the late Paleolithic (reindeer, mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, giant elk and musk ox) are absent in the Mesolithic period in France, though some survived further north. A change in environment seems to correspond to a shift from cave sites to open-air locations. The loss of cave art was replaced by artwork on bone and pebbles engraved or painted with simple geometric motifs, the earliest phase of which has been identified as Azilian (named after the cave site Mas d’Azil), and sometimes considered the last phase of the Paleolithic. The Azilian culture was replaced by the Sauveterrian and then the Tardenoisian cultures. These people also polished their stone tools, and outcroppings of rock may be seen in various places with pronounced grooves, called in French polissoirs, in which the tools were rubbed to a smooth, polished surface. The efficiency of the flint industry increased dramatically over that of the Paleolithic, while the most important innovation was the advent of the bow and arrow. Mesolithic people learned new methods of travel on skis, sleds and boats, and with the latter came new techniques in harvesting seafood, such as fishhooks made from bone or shell, fish spears, and fish traps. As seafood became a major component in people’s diet, riverine, lake edge and seacoast habitation sites became more frequent. By the end of the period, settled communities were established and the dog became the first domesticated animal. The period came to a close with the appearance of new cultural elements of the Neolithic\n\n3. Neolithic Period While hunting, fishing, and collecting sustained humankind through the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, a change occurred in which societies learned to collect naturally growing grains such as wheat and barley and to domesticate\n\n6\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nthem, planting seeds, reaping the grain, and storing it for later use. Wild animals were still hunted and continued to form much of the diet, but some of these too were domesticated – beginning with sheep and goats. This practice of food production became fairly well established and represents the advent of a new period: the Neolithic (New Stone) Age. According to one view, Neolithic currents reached France from the Middle East apparently by two routes: the first along the Mediterranean shores penetrating the south of France early in the sixth millennium B.C. The new society was characterized by pottery decorated by the use of the serrated edge of the cockle shell and known as Impressed Ware. Toward the end of the sixth millennium B.C., the coast of the western Mediterranean was dominated by this type of pottery, and remains have been found in rock shelters and caves on the Mediterranean coast such as at Cap Ragnon in the south of France and a cave on the Bay of Marseille displaying cockle-shell pottery, dated to about 6000 B.C. In the fifth millennium B.C., other Neolithic peoples appeared in northeastern France, having arrived by a continental route up the Danube River and eventually penetrating into Alsace and Lorraine and then spreading out into the Paris Basin. Similarities in pottery and dwellings in the Danube Basin with those of northeastern France suggest this migratory route. By the fourth millennium, local characteristics are in evidence among Neolithic peoples. Vases were decorated with meanders, chevrons or spirals, and they have been discovered in northeastern France and along the Seine and its tributaries. Neolithic agricultural villages were established in the Paris Basin by about 4600 B.C. and along the Rhône Valley about the same time. Another view of developments in this period prefers a model in which domesticated plants and animals were introduced into France with minimal movement of people. The earliest farmers were simply the descendants of the Mesolithic population, importing new ideas and methods to sustain themselves. From the fifth millennium B.C. onwards, Neolithic farmers developed a type of village in France and elsewhere consisting of an enclosure surrounded by one or several moats and sometimes palisades. Such sites vary from area to area. The moats are generally around 2 metres deep and about 6 metres wide. The oldest of these sites, so far discovered in France, is that of Menneville in the Aisne from the first half of the fifth millennium B.C., but most date back to the second half of the fifth or the beginnings of the fourth millennium B.C. Developing perhaps in the Late Neolithic period and continuing into the Bronze Age are the Palafitte villages in which the dwellings were constructed on piles set in lakes. Such pile dwelling sites are found in the Alps. An important site in France is that of Lake Chalain in the Jura mountains. Another, Charavines, is still older, belonging to the Neolithic culture of the Saône-Rhône regions. Neolithic peoples eventually settled in all four major river systems. One of the oldest known villages from this period is at Courthezon in the valley of the Rhône between Orange and Avignon. Huts discovered here each measure about 15 square metres and date back to about 4650 B.C. An important Neolithic site is at Saint-Michel-du-Touch near Toulouse where some 300 buildings with baked clay floors have been identified. The site was occupied from about 4300 to 3300 B.C. There were both circular and rectangular structures. The base of the economy was mixed farming including a NEOLITHIC\n\n7\n\nrange of grains and domestic animals. Other sites include Carnac in Bretagne where the presence of numerous stone alignments, tombs and stone circles suggest a thriving population in Bretagne by the fourth millennium B.C. Just as the valley of the Vézère is the site par excellence for rupestrian art of the Old Stone Age, the fields around Carnac are the showcase of Neolithic stone monuments.\n\n4. Megalithic Monuments The stone structures referred to as megaliths (from Greek mega ‘great,’ and lithos ‘stone’) found throughout Western Europe and used as burial chambers, for sacred rites or for astrological observations are still preserved in great numbers and may constitute the oldest man-made monuments. Sometimes a single stone employed in their construction weighed several hundred tons and was quarried many kilometres from the building site. One method of moving the stones appears to have consisted of placing logs underneath and pulling them along with ropes, removing the logs from the back as the stone moved on and placing them again in the front. Hundreds of men were probably required to move the larger stones.\n\nMenhirs Megaliths often take the form of menhirs (from a single upright stone to alignments of great stones in rows or concentric configurations). The first megalithic monuments were probably the single, solitary menhirs, standing stones embedded in the soil to mark territorial boundaries or sacred ground. Some are clearly phallic symbols. They are generally undatable in any specific terms, but appear to go back to the early Neolithic period. Some of them were engraved with symbols such as stone axes which are representative of the early Neolithic. The general age of the decorated menhir of Kermarquer, for example, has been dated by this means. A few others have been uprooted and reused in the construction of dolmens whose artifacts and burials also date back to the Neolithic. Among menhirs, such as those pertaining to the alignments of Carnac in southern Bretagne, the enormous stone alignments, some stretching nearly a mile across the terrain, represent a colossal effort of Neolithic megalith builders. Here have been found a certain kind of crude ceramic which, along with the symbols engraved on some stones, places their origin near the end of the Neolithic period. The tallest stone still standing (10 metres) is at Kerloas. In some cases, monuments have been converted to meet the demands of changing times: the 8.10 metre-tall menhir at Saint-Duzec in Bretagne, unadorned when it was erected in the third millennium B.C., was topped with a cross in the seventeenth century, and further Christian symbols, including a figure of the Virgin, were later added. Others in Bretagne have undergone similar remodeling.\n\nDolmens It may be supposed that once the Neolithic farmers of Europe had settled into their new environment, cleared the land, and planted crops, they had time for ceremonial activities that earlier hunting and gathering peoples could ill afford.\n\n8\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nOne of these was tomb-building and paying more attention to the dead. While the villages themselves appear to have been constructed of perishable materials such as wood, mud and reeds, the megaliths were built to withstand eternity. There was once thousands more megaliths than there are today but many were destroyed to clear the land for farming or, obliterated by the church for religious purposes––to exorcise evil spirits. Others have naturally tumbled down from earth movement, wind and erosion. Stones have sometimes been broken up for use elsewhere. The simplest dolmens consisted of a single chamber of standing stones roofed over by a large slab of stone or by corbeling. Here the bodies were interred. A more complex type was a passage grave or dolmen à couloir in which a narrow, low passage led to a generally circular chamber which itself may have had several smaller chambers leading off the main one. Another type is called a gallery grave or allée couverte, a long tomb with no entrance corridor but where the entire structure constitutes the burial chamber. It may or may not have interior partitions. In all cases the entire structure was then covered over with earth to form a mound, some of which still remain to be excavated. There are about 4500 dolmens spread out over some sixty French departments. Some of these, in Bretagne, appear to be the oldest. They range over a period of about 2500 years beginning with the earliest known passage graves at Barnenez of about 4500 B.C. One of the most majestic is that at Bagneux, near Saumur in the Pays de la Loire. Normally they were used for collective burials over generations and have on occasion yielded remains of more than one hundred bodies but the acidic soil of Bretagne has in most places generally destroyed all traces of bone. In many others that have not been looted, artifacts have been found such as knives or tools of flint and fragments of pottery, but generally there is little else in the way of funeral accoutrements. In some cases the stones of the graves have been inscribed, most often with signs of the ax, but also by triangles, meanders, zigzags and other patterns whose significance is unknown. The tombs may vary in size from small box-like structures to enormous gallery graves 20 metres long, such as the one at Bagneux. Other types of burial chambers also existed, including caves and chambers hewn from the living rock. Of the latter some of the finest examples are found about four kilometres northeast of Arles on private property. The cluster of rock-cut tombs dates to about 3500 B.C.\n\n5. Age of Metals: Copper and Bronze The first known objects in copper found in France are from the end of the fourth millennium B.C. and consist of small dagger blades and hammer-wrought jewelry found in the South. The earliest use of gold objects appeared about the same time. Such items may have been produced locally and independently of metallurgy already developed in the Near East where it was known long before, although the view is often expressed that, like the introduction of farming in the Neolithic, metallurgy reached Europe by way of migratory peoples via the Mediterranean and by the Danubian continental route. By the third millennium B.C., metal objects such as axes and blades, imitating those made earlier of stone, became common. Some villages are COPPER & BRONZE\n\n9\n\nknown from the period such as La Conquette and Cambous in the Hérault where there are about forty oval houses, 12 metres long and 3 to 5 metres wide, built of drystone and clustered together. A turning point in the history of metallurgy occurred when copper alloyed with arsenic and later tin produced bronze, a harder and more durable metal than copper. This new technology arose in the Near East about 3000 B.C., and its origins in Europe are dated around 2000 B.C. In the search for tin, merchants and traders sailed as far as the western Mediterranean and through trade, personal contacts and indigenous skills, bronze metal-working came to France. Industries in the first half of the second millennium B.C. flourished in only two regions in ancient France: in the Rhône Valley and in Bretagne where bronze artifacts have been found in long barrows. Elsewhere bronze objects first appeared in graves in the Middle Bronze period, about 1500 B.C. to 1200 B.C., for example those of the Haguenau forest. From this period hoards of bronze tools, especially axes, are known from all over France. A particular sword current among Late Bronze Age societies of western Europe was characterized by a broad slashing blade molded into a narrow tip for thrusting. It appears to have developed on the west coast from Bretagne to the Gironde after 1000 B.C.\n\n6. Iron Age Peoples (Celts) The Celts arrived in Europe from the East as part of a larger Indo-European period of expansion before 1000 B.C., and those that came to reside in presentday France were called Gauls by the Romans. They settled between the Rhine River and the Loire. A few dwelt between the Garonne and the Pyrenees but settlements here among the Aquitanians were sparse. In southern France the Ligurians, east of the Rhône and the later Iberians, west of the Rhône occupied much of the region.\n\nGauls Mostly composed of Celtic peoples, the Gauls formed a loose confederation of tribes that lived in villages of thatch-roofed round huts amidst great dark forests prevalent at the time. They cleared some land for agriculture, worshipped natural divinities such as mountains, trees, springs and hollows, were skilled in producing iron weapons and celebrated the Festival of the Mistletoe under the guidance of their priests, the Druids. The major city of each tribe was often situated along, or at the confluence of rivers, for example, Lutèce (Paris) and Lugdunum (Lyon). From the Paris Basin stretching well eastward the land was occupied by numerous communities, a patchwork of local tribes who were ethnically homogeneous with a common heritage known as the Western Hallstatt culture named after this primarily Iron Age site in Austria. The early period, from about 800 to 600 B.C., appears to exhibit a substantial degree of economic and social stability. While the ashes of a few individuals were interred with elaborate grave goods representing leadership and rank, the majority were interred with simple personal belongings consisting of pots with food offerings, horse-gear, and weapons. The Hallstatt culture comprised the earliest group that can be securely associated with the first Celtic-speaking peoples. It was based upon a mixed\n\n10\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nfarming economy made more efficient by the use of iron implements. From 600 to 450 B.C. after the founding of Massalia (Marseille), a transformation occurred. Contact with the Mediterranean world gave rise to the second great Celtic culture of La Tène, named after the Iron Age votive deposit found in the shallow water at the east end of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland. It was characterized by several Mediterranean features comprising weaponry, wine-drinking and personal ornamentation. New Celtic art styles grew out of this mixture of indigenous and imported elements. Massaliot, Greek and Etruscan luxury goods begin to appear in quantity and the society reflects this accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few by a hierarchy of rich graves and a number of fortified hilltop towns, both of which display the rise of powerful aristocracies. It would seem that the Greek trading port created a demand for commodities from the North (furs, skins, honey, minerals, slaves, amber) in exchange for various luxury items (wine, bowls, jugs, small items of gold, ivory and other finished products). Primary features of La Tène culture were decorated bronze jugs for the new fashion of wine drinking, fantastic animal designs, and blurring of the distinctions between naturalistic and abstract art continuing the Hallstatt tradition of geometric and abstract art but with new Mediterranean elements in the hands of Celtic craftsmen. The oppida, or fortified settlements of the second and first centuries B.C., were true towns with stratified societies of wealthy chieftains, specialist craftsmen, workers in metal, glass and pottery, peasant farmers and no doubt slaves. This was the culture the Romans encountered when they moved the legions northward.\n\nGreeks, Phoenicians and Carthaginians Greeks first penetrated the western Mediterranean in the eighth century B.C. in search of raw materials, primarily metals, and established Massalia, presentday Marseille, in about 600 B.C. The site was wisely chosen as the main port of trade on the Gaulish Mediterranean coast providing easy access up the valley of the Rhône to the barbarian hinterland and to the headwaters of the Loire and the Atlantic seaboard. This was soon followed by the development of daughter colonies along the Mediterranean such as Nicaea (Nice). From Massalia, Greek and Etruscan goods from Italy traveled up the Rhône into native settlements such as Nages or Entremont which grew into fortified towns, and much trade continued onward into the valleys of the Seine and Rhine. Indicative of this trade is the grave site at Vix, where a local princess from the native oppidum on Mont Lassois was buried in the sixth century B.C. with a wealth of material of Massaliot, Etruscan, and Greek origins, a gold diadem probably from Spain, and an unusual bronze crater, that is, a large vessel from Taranto, 1.64 metres high and capable of containing some 1,100 litres.\n\nIberians The earliest writing in ancient Gaul was introduced by the Greek colonists who founded Massalia. About the same time Iberian people crossed the Pyrenees and appeared in southern France. Their towns were not situated directly on the coasts, but were near enough to participate in the IBERIANS\n\n11\n\nactive coastal trade, and situated astride the land trade routes between Italy and Spain. The Greek colony at ancient Agathe (Agde) at the mouth of the Hérault river is thought to have been the major trading centre for the Iberian towns in southern France. The Iberians acquired the skill of writing derived from the Graeco-Phoenician script used throughout the Mediterranean. Iberian sites in southern France lie west of the Rhône River and can be identified by the inscriptional material in the Iberian language found among the ruins. Ensérune, is the best excavated and the type-site for Iberian presence in southwestern France during the Iron Age. The town was abandoned in the first half of the first century A.D.\n\nAquitanians and Basques To the north of the present-day Basque region lies Aquitania in southwest France. The Aquitanians appear to have been descendants of stone age populations of the area. They lived in fortified villages and seem to have spoken a language akin to Basque. Aquitanian inscriptions written with the Latin alphabet are brief and consist of about 400 personal and 70 divine names with much similarity to Basque. There are about 100,000 speakers of Basque in France who were once much more widespread than today. As the Basque language has no proven affiliations with other language groups, and as positive migratory evidence of the people is lacking, an ethnic in situ development from Cro-Magnon is acceptable to many Basque scholars.\n\n7. Roman and Gallo-Roman Period Roman legions entered Gaul in 153 B.C. on behalf of their Greek allies in Marseille. They came in defense of coastal towns such as Nice from Celtic and Ligurian marauders and the incursions of Germanic tribes. In 125 B.C. the Romans conquered Provincia Gallia Narbonensis (Provence) and extended their control into Languedoc. By about 121 B.C. they controlled the Rhône River valley up to Vienne and along the Garonne River to Toulouse. Trading posts and military camps such as Narbonne, Nîmes, Arles and Aix soon developed into towns. In 58 B.C. Julius Caesar undertook campaigns that were to bring all of Gaul under Roman hegemony. The rivalry of the Gallic tribes greatly facilitated the conquest but not until the decisive defeat of Vercingetorix in 52 B.C. was Caesar’s triumph complete.\n\nVercingetorix Roman massacres and enslavement of Celtic people created much resentment and eventually revolt. Elected by the representatives of the Gallic tribes, Vercingetorix, from the Auvergne and Chief of the Auvergni, led a large-scale revolt against the legions of Caesar in 52 B.C. After suffering defeat, Vercingetorix withdrew to the earthwork stronghold or oppidum of Alesia. Caesar surrounded the area, building two contravallations, defensive lines against sorties by the besieged, and a circumvallation to protect his rear flank. The blockade forced Vercingetorix into surrender and he was later murdered in Rome after six years of captivity. The Gallic oppidum became a Gallo-Roman city which was abandoned by the inhabitants during the\n\n12\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nMerovingian period and disappeared under a layer of earth. Excavations have revealed its true nature. Traces of Caesar’s earthworks are obscure but the plan of the Gallo-Roman city is clearly visible.\n\nRomanization Gaul underwent cultural and linguistic Romanization and during Roman times the population is generally referred to as Gallo-Roman. The Pax Romana, the Roman Peace, spread over Gaul replacing intertribal wars and conflicts and the Celts thoroughly adopted Roman customs. The acquisition of Gaul opened up new commercial enterprises to the Roman Empire, supplied men for the Roman armies to protect the northern frontiers, and provided men of distinction who served in the Roman senate. Towns were founded and stone construction replaced the previous wooden buildings and dwellings, solidly built roads replaced the older dirt tracks, triumphal arches, circuses (only two known from the literature at Arles and Vienne), temples, and public buildings were erected along with theaters and amphitheatres, and public baths were established with their various hot, cold and temperate pools. Forests were cleared and villas constructed, and towns and necropoli laid out for the veterans of the wars and immigrants from Italy. From the first to the third centuries A.D. the country experienced an economic and cultural upsurge in agriculture, metal-working, textile production, and pottery-making. Industry and agriculture prospered, and the Latin language and law of the Romans unified the country. Gaul remained a Roman province for over 500 years from the time of Caesar’s conquest until the collapse of the empire in the late fifth century. At the confluence of the Rhône and Saône rivers Lyon became a great hub of commerce for the Western world connected by well-built roads and bridges.\n\nTowns Roman towns in France were sometimes constructed on the sites of existing Celtic towns and villages or built from scratch in new places where economic opportunities justified their existence. Some of the best sites available to the modern visitor are found at Glanum and Alesia, the latter where the Gauls made their last stand against the legions of Julius Caesar. There are also fine remains at Vaison-La-Romaine in the Vaucluse. The most important section of the Roman town was the forum around which urban life centred with its administration building, merchants’ shops, temples and sometimes the market. The Roman towns were laid out in rectangular patterns and later surrounded by walls. As early as the last few decades before Christ, indigenous towns were beginning to construct or rebuild their towns on the Roman model. In the reign of the emperor Augustus the major massive building took place, however. Most of the oppida from earlier times were abandoned but some remained to become country towns. The first two centuries of the first millenium were generally prosperous times but the third degenerated into economic instability and civil war, with barbarian incursions leaving towns and villages abandoned and in smoking ruins. Throughout the fourth century Marseille and Narbonne remained important cities while Vienne became a leading city, and Arles even more prominent since it was selected as the imperial residence. TOWNS\n\n13\n\nVillas The great Roman estates or villas were the backbone of the agricultural enterprises producing cereals, wine, olive oil, wool, or livestock. They were also centres of fishing industries on the coast. Today they are sites of great interest with their various styles, drainage conduits, heating systems, baths, ponds and gardens and give an idea of the artistic inclination, cultural level and wealth of the owner. Those who could afford it decorated their villas with beautiful mosaic floors, the extent and richness of which indicates the prosperity of the owner. Some of the best villas may be seen at Andilly, Montcaret, Montmaurin and the large site with many mosaics near Montréal at Séviac.\n\nRoads, Bridges and Aqueducts The Roman engineers skillfully constructed roads of great durability in all parts of the empire. Rome laid down roads wherever its authority extended, initially in order to enhance troop movements. Each mile along the road was marked by a 2-metre circular pillar, a milestone. Measured from the gates of Rome, they were usually inscribed to the reigning emperor. Engineers tried to build the roads straight, flat, and level, digging tunnels and bridging valleys where required. There were often cisterns, resting stations, and garrisons at intervals along the route. The somewhat preserved Via Domitia ran from the Rhône River at Beaucaire through Languedoc-Roussillon to Le Perthus in the Pyrenees. Some of the many milestones along the route are still extant. Some well-preserved bridges, further marvels of Roman engineering, may be seen throughout the country, for example Pont St.-Julien, near Apt. Aqueducts are among the most impressive remains of Roman engineering extant today, for instance the Pont du Gard a little northeast of Nîmes, spans the river Gardon in splendid grandeur.\n\nPublic Baths and Temples Places for business undertakings, and social interchange as well as for hygiene, Roman baths were popular establishments throughout the empire and were often equipped with hot, tepid and cold water pools and changing rooms. They were frequently instituted in the vicinity of thermal hot springs. The baths fell into disuse and disrepair during the period of Germanic invasions. Good examples that survived the ravages of time many be seen at Metz, Peyrehorade and Sanxay. One of the largest of the bath complexes, and perhaps the last to be constructed in the south of the country, is situated at Arles. To carry out the sacred duties required by the gods, the Romans built temples (unlike the Gauls whose animistic religious practices generally required only a clearing in the woods, a hilltop, or perhaps a stream or pond). The finest of these structures still extant, La Maison Carrée, is found at Nîmes. Another, the temple of Augustus and Livia at Vienne is well-preserved due to continuous usage as a church, a market place, and finally a museum (along with some restoration).\n\nThe Roman Heritage Confirmation of the Roman presence can be seen everywhere in France. Besides palpable remains of buildings, engineering works and monuments,\n\n14\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nRoman culture continues today not only in stone and concrete but in less tangible features such as language, Roman law and religion. The French language, albeit in highly changed form, is but a continuation of popular Latin, the lingua franca of the Roman Empire. Latin gradually replaced all the Gallic languages and dialects with the exception of Basque and Breton. The social, economic and political cohesion of the Roman Empire also promoted the spread of Christianity throughout Gaul.\n\n8. Early Christian Monuments Christianity, introduced into Southern Gaul near the end of the first century, spread slowly. In the third century the first saints and martyrs appeared. SaintDenis (d. about 258), patron saint of France and first bishop of Paris, was one of these. The hilltop where his death took place, once sacred to the pagan god Mercury, became known as the Mount of the Martyrs, or Montmartre. In the fourth century Saint-Hilary (d. 367?), born in Poitiers of pagan parentage, was elected Bishop of Poitiers and immediately began a rigorous suppression of the Arian heresy widespread at the time. Saint-Martin (d. 397), Bishop of Tours, waged a holy war against paganism and established monasticism in Gaul. A defining moment for the Roman Catholic church occurred in about 497 when Clovis, leader of the Franks, chose Catholicism over Arianism, thus establishing the Franks as protectors of the Church of Rome. Throughout the period about the only important monumental construction was of churches and baptistries. Landowners frequently had a chapel built for those peasants who worked their land and for the artisans living on the estates. The chapel often became the parish church and the origin of the villages. These communities sometimes retained the name of the land owners, e.g., Flavigny “residence of Flavian.” Early and Medieval Christian monuments may be seen in many locations. The Merovingian church of Saint-Léger in the village of Alesia, dates back to 678-720. In the cathedral of Saint-Sauveur, Aix-en-Provence, is a fourth century Merovingian baptistry. In front of Notre Dame in Paris, excavations have revealed amidst a third-century Gallo-Roman complex the foundations of the sixth century Merovingian church of St.-Etienne. The St.-Oyand crypt of the sixth-to-eighth century in Grenoble was built on the site of a pagan burial ground. There are also Merovingian dwellings and a necropolis at Séviac as well as a Paleo-Christian chapel and baptistry. A Merovingian necropolis was installed at the villa of Andilly in the fifth century.\n\n9. Germanic Invasions and the Early Middle Ages Fertile and prosperous Gaul under Roman authority greatly attracted people from the dark forests east of the Rhine and Danube rivers, that then served as the frontier. The first clash between Romans and Germanic peoples in Gaul occurred in the second century B.C., when the Cimbri and Teutons were defeated in present-day Provence. In the first century B.C., further Germanic tribes on the move had attempted to settle in Gaul, only to be repelled by Julius Caesar. For the next hundred years, raids GERMANIC\n\n15\n\nacross the frontier resulted in the rise of strong-walled Gallo-Roman towns. By the mid-second century A.D., Germanic pressures on the Roman frontiers intensified and by this time German mercenaries were beginning to be used by the Roman authorities to help stem the tide of their countrymen. Throughout the fourth century small groups of Germans began settling in Gaul with the permission of the Roman authorities. About 412 the Visigoths freely entered southern Gaul and formed the most important barbarian group in the south. Granted permissioin to settle Aquitaine, they occupied Toulouse and Carcassonne, and took Narbonne in 462. The Burgundians, meanwhile moving westward, occupied Vienne and the lower Rhône. This was the period of the main Germanic migrations and the demise of the Roman world. For the so-called barbarians it was no doubt a time of great adventure and bloody battles in which some tribes achieved glory and others disappeared, but for the settled peoples of the Roman Empire, it was a time of profound stress and uncertainty.\n\nBrittany (Bretagne) and Burgundy (Bourgogne) The two regions of Brittany and Burgundy reflect the deep ethnic and cultural divisions that were still in the process of formation in post-Roman France. Beginning in A.D. 449, the Celts were driven out of Britain by invading Germanic tribes, and many crossed the sea to the Roman province of Armorica in northwestern France and settled there, giving it its present name Bretagne (Brittany). They subsequently became known as Bretons. Their Celtic language, akin to that of Cornish and Welsh, persists today. In 443 the Germanic Burgundians, after their defeat by the Huns on the Middle Rhine, invaded Gaul and established the first kingdom of Burgundy, which expanded until it included most of what is now southeastern France and part of present-day Switzerland. Lyon was occupied in 470. The Burgundians suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Franks at Autun in 432, and lost their independence to the Franks shortly thereafter.\n\n10. Franks, Merovingians and Visigoths The Franks, Germanic peoples, were established in Belgium as Roman allies since the middle of the fourth century. They advanced into Gaul from a solid base through a series of small steps. In this way, unlike most other tribes, they did not incur the wrath of the Romans and possible obliteration in pitched battles. Due to their long exposure as neighbours of the Romans, they were more civilized or perhaps Romanized than, say the Anglo-Saxon tribes who had little contact with Roman culture. Meanwhile, the Huns under Attila invaded Gaul in 451 and destroyed Metz but a combination of Roman, Frankish, Visigothic and Burgundian forces attacked and subsequently defeated them near Troyes. In the last quarter of the fifth century, as imperial authority collapsed in the West, the Franks, under Clovis I, began the conquest of northern Gaul. He routed Syagrius, the last Roman governor of Gaul in 486. The Visigoths were Arians in religion after their conversion by Ulfilas in the fourth century, and hence a threat to Roman Catholicism. In 507 they extended\n\n16\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\ntheir territory across southern Gaul as far east as the Rhône River (they had taken Arles in the 470’s) and as far north as the Loire. To stem this Arian threat Clovis, in cooperation with the church, invaded the Visigothic kingdom. The opposing armies met near Poitiers and the Visigoths were defeated and driven into Spain. Those who wished to remain had to accept baptism and convert to Catholicism. The Frankish military and the church became masters of the western European heartland. Clovis celebrated his success by establishing his capital at Paris. When he died in 511, the Frankish kingdom was divided between his four sons. About 600, territorial expansion of the Franks under Merovingian kings came to an end. The noblemen, no longer having challenging wars to look forward to, began terrorizing the peasants. Anarchy and lawlessness prevailed through much of the realm. The clergy too became willing participants in debauchery, immorality and venality, their ranks swollen by semi-literate, greedy, and nepotistic aristocrats in search of power and prestige. In 639 Dagobert I, the last strong Merovingian monarch, died and was succeeded by a series of weak and incompetent kings. According to Germanic custom, all the king’s possessions, including the royal title, were divided among sons. Because of this practice, Merovingian France was beset by continual disunity and civil war. By dividing the land, the kings contributed to the disintegration of Gaul. Due to the fact that the Franks occupied Roman territory, towns, villages, and institutions, and took up Roman ways, they constructed no monuments or architectural styles that were uniquely their own. Apart from items consisting of jewelry and weapons, their legacy is mostly one of spirit and genes infused into a Gallo-Roman substratum––one from which the Franks took their language, much of their culture, and their ideals.\n\n11. Carolingians The Merovingian dynasty was replaced by another, the Carolingian, whose greatest sovereign was Charlemagne (r. 768-814). In conjunction with the pope, he expanded his territory through conquest and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in the year 800. Charlemagne established his seat of government at Aixla-Chapelle (Aachen) and came to preside over a large territory that included France and much of Italy and Germany. The practice of dividing territories between sons upon the death of the monarch, however, caused the disintegration of the Carolingian Empire and France became a collection of independent feudal states under the control of dukes and counts and would not again be united for many centuries.\n\n12. Norsemen and the Foundation of Normandy (Normandie) Pagan Vikings from Scandinavia made their first appearance among the Franks about 840, sacking and burning towns and churches in search of anything valuable. They came in ships, and seaports, river towns, and nearby monasteries fell victim to these seafaring marauders. Rouen and Paris on the NORSEMEN\n\n17\n\nSeine River, Nantes, Tours, Blois, and Orléans on the Loire, Bordeaux on the Garonne, and many other towns were pillaged and burned. Aided by the disunity and internal strife among the Frankish kings and nobility, the Vikings were able to attack and loot with little interference until a large company of Vikings was bought off and their leader, Rollo, made count of Rouen in 911. From the West Frankish king Charles III (the Simple), Rollo accepted the territory in the lower Seine Valley that became known as Normandy. In time the Vikings became less aggressive, were Christianized, and were integrated among the Franks, adopting the French language.\n\n13. The Rise of France Beneath the disorder and turbulence wrought by the barbarian hordes, a new set of social and economic patterns formed. Hybrid societies took shape as the Germanic peoples intermingled with and ruled over the Romanized populations. Germanic kings became the successors of the once mighty Roman Empire, and barbarian warriors of yesterday became great landowners and farmers. Functionaries trained in the Roman tradition maintained the machinery of state while the vast substrata of slaves and peasants generally remained unchanged. Not until end of the fifteenth century, long after the great Carolingian barons fought among themselves for land, prestige and wealth, did France emerge from the divisions of its feudal past to become a national monarchy incorporating the territory stretching from the Pyrenees to the English Channel.\n\n14. Conclusion The land which was to make up France underwent great diversity in language, culture, customs and ethnic composition throughout its early history. United by the Romans after a drawn-out conquest (121-58 B.C.), Gallic towns often continued as Roman cities, later to become Medieval regional centres and capitals. After the expansion of the Franks or Merovingians over much of Gaul (conquering and displacing other Germanic tribes), the triumphant Carolingian kings, who succeeded them, expanded Francia (land of the Franks) to its maximum extent. Continuity of settlement was facilitated by the adoption of regional centres as bishoprics by the Christian Church. While some disappeared and others arose, the ecclesiastical provinces had emerged by the tenth century to remain unchanged until the French Revolution.\n\n18\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\n15.

Such cities as the modern Strasbourg began as Roman frontier forts in a no-man’s land guarding the Rhine (whose banks have been occupied throughout the centuries by Celts, Germanic invaders who were expelled back across the Rhine by Julius Caesar and, in the fourth and fifth centuries Alamans, Vandals and Huns who successively devastated the region). The Merovingians became the dominant power in the sixth century, to be followed by the Carolingians. After the breakup of Charlemagne’s empire in the ninth century, the region became the object of disputes between French and Germanic rulers, passing from the control of one to the other.\n\nALSACE\n\n23\n\nAvolsheim Bas-Rhin Sights: The village preserves a pre-Romanesque ninth-century baptistry in the form of a cloverleaf. 500 m SE is a church reputed to be the oldest in Alsace.\n\nLocation: W of Strasbourg some 24 km on D 45.\n\nKembs Haut-Rhin Sight: Vestiges of a cement Roman bridge are found where the Grand Canal merges with the Rhine River, demolishing the theory that along the Rhine, Romans always constructed their bridges of wood, so that they could be burned in case of invasion.\n\nLocation: S of Strasbourg.

The Aquitainians, a people perhaps akin to the Basque, occupied the southern part of the area in pre-Roman times. The name from Latin Aquitania for SW France, was first used by Julius Caesar. Under the Romans, the province of Aquitania was created by Caesar, and extended almost as far north as the Loire River. After 500 years of Roman rule, Aquitaine fell to the Visigoths in the fifth century and then to the Franks when they defeated the Visigoths in 507. In the seventh century Gascony, the area south of the Garonne, was separated from Aquitaine and was ruled by semiindependent dukes, but about 725 the region was raided by the Muslim conquerors of Spain, and the dukes were forced to seek the protection of the Frankish ruler Charles Martel, who defeated the Muslims. The last duke of Aquitaine was William X (1099-1137). His daughter, Eleanor of Aquitaine, married the heir to the English throne in 1152. The area became an English possession and remained so until the fifteenth century when it was annexed by France at the end of the Hundred Years’ War. The capital of the region is Bordeaux situated on the Garonne River. Once called Burdigala, it was founded in the third century by a Celtic tribe. In 56 B.C. it was seized by the Romans who occupied the town and carried out further development building aqueducts, temples and an amphitheatre. After the barbarian invasions in 276 the town was fortified with walls.\n\nAQUITAINE\n\n27\n\nBarsac Gironde Sight: Well preserved section of Gallo-Roman road nearby.\n\nLocation: SE of Bordeaux approx. 35 km on N 113.

Beside the Musée de Borda and with entry via the museum, is an archaeological crypt containing foundations of a second-century Roman temple. Inside the church of St.-Vincent-de-Xaintes there is a tenth-century monogram above the door; in the chancel is a Gallo-Roman mosaic, said to have been discovered under the foundations of an earlier church here.\n\nLocation: S of Bordeaux and NE of Bayonne 49 km on N 10.\n\nLes Eyzies-de-Tayac Dordogne Sights: The Valley of the Vézère comprises numerous limestone bluffs where prehistoric humans inhabited grottos and caves and left many wall paintings. To visit the large number of sites in this valley it is wise to go first to Les Eyzies (or to Montignac) where the S.I. will provide maps and information. The paleolithic shelters of Vignaud and Pataud are in town by the museum, but only Pataud (with its own museum) has visible remains of occupation. An ibex from the Solutrean period is engraved in bas relief. W of Les Eyzies and situated in the vale of Gorge d’Enfer on the right\n\nAquitaine: Les Eyzies. Roque St.-Christophe AQUITAINE\n\n29\n\nbank of the Vézère River is the Abri du Poisson with a metre-long engraved salmon or trout, the first known representation of a fish. St.-Cirq, Grotte du Sorcier, contains many fine engravings, especially a male figure with a face. It is about 5 km SW of Les Eyzies on the N side of the river. The Grotte de Font-de-Gaume, about 20 m above the valley floor, consists of a passage with a series of chambers, and numerous depictions of animals in black and ochre include bison, goats, mammoth, and reindeer, all from the Magdalenian period. Steep climb up pathway. The narrow tunnel in the Grotte des Combarelles is decorated with more than 300 animal drawings from the Magdalenian period (the final Paleolithic culture of France). In the Grotte de Bernifal are hands in negative, engravings and paintings of mammoth, bison, and horses, among others from the Magdalenian. It is located a few km beyond Combarelles. The Abri du Cap-Blanc is a rock shelter containing animals in high relief including deer-heads and bison and a frieze of sculptured horses and other animals. Just before Abri du Cap-Blanc, in a side valley on the left, the cave of La Grèze contains incised bisons. At Roque-St.-Christophe, 9 km NE, the cliffs and hollows have been extensively excavated revealing occupation by troglodytes especially in the Middle Ages when it was used as a fortress. Across the river is an important site, Le Moustier, which lent its name to the Mousterian period. Within easy reach of Les Eyzies are the Grotte du Grand Roc, Cro-Magnon (where the remains of a 30,000-year old Cro-Magnon skeleton was found), and several other prehistoric sites, but check with the S.I. to see which ones may be visited. Gisement de la Madeleine has a troglodyte village which may have been first occupied in the tenth century. Near Castel-Merle there are several shelters including l’Abri Reverdit which\n\nMap 4. Prehistoric Sites of the Vézère Valley from Montignac to Les Eyzies-de-Tayac\n\n30\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nhas sculptures from the Magdalenian, and some strange symbols of an earlier period. See also entries for Le Bugue, Montignac, Rouffignac. There are many other cave and shelter sites in the region and it is advisable to check with the S.I. to see which ones are open to the public.\n\nLocation: Les Eyzies is E of Bordeaux and S of Périgueux 37 km on D 710, then E 11 km on D 703/D 706. Good maps are available from the S.I.\n\nIsturitz Pyrénées-Atlantiques Sights: Three prehistoric caves––Isturitz, Oxocelhaya and Erberua (the first two connected by a recent man-made passageway and the latter not open to the public at present). Here are some engravings and paintings but mostly they are caves of natural beauty. Guided visit of 45 minutes (14 degrees inside).\n\nLocation: S of Bordeaux and SE of Bayonne. Go 14 km on D 932 to Cambo-les-Bains, then take the D 10 through Hasparren and ca. 11 km from here to St.-Esteban. Turn left at sign: Grottes 3 km. Well signposted.\n\nLimeuil Dordogne Sights: Located here are two caves from Magdalenian times with about 100 engravings of reindeer and horses.\n\nLocation: E of Bordeaux and S of Périgueux. SW of Les Eyzies 11 km on D 706/D 703 to Le Bugue, then S about 5 km on D 31.\n\nMontcaret Gironde Sights: The Romanesque church stands in the midst of excavated foundations of a Gallo-Roman villa. In its choir are two Corinthian capitals from the sixth and seventh centuries. It is thought that there was originally a pre-Romanesque church here which suffered damage from Saracen attacks in the eighth century and from the Vikings in the ninth century. The peristyle villa is of GraecoRoman design. In the trefoil-shaped dining room are mosaics and frescos of the third and fourth centuries with designs of flowers, animals and geometric forms. There are several graves around the floor of this room\n\nAquitaine: Montcaret AQUITAINE\n\n31\n\nwith skeletal remains, and many others of both Merovingian and Carolingian type in the excavation as the site was used as a church and burial ground after the sixth century. There is also a large fourth-century Roman bath and hypocausts with sculptural and architectural remains. In the courtyard by the church, the Christian mosaics were made by monks in the eighth century but they are considered a poor imitation of the Roman original. Museum in situ.\n\nLocation: Montcaret is E of Bordeaux some 50 km. It is W of Bergerac approx. 35 km on D 936. Church and excavation are signposted in the village.\n\nMontignac Dordogne Sights: Located at the head of the prehistoric valley of the Vézère. The famous site of the Grotte de Lascaux, discovered in 1940, is 2 km from the town. The cave itself is closed to the public since its paintings were showing signs of deterioration, but there is a replica, Lascaux II, containing faithful reproductions of the paintings, located 200 m from the original site.\n\nLocation: NW of Bordeaux and E of Périgueux. Go W of Brive N 89-E 70, 27 km, then S, 9 km on D 704.\n\nPays Basque Pyrénées Atlantiques Sights and Locations: The Pays Basque encompasses the western Pyrenees both in Spain and France, and is replete with ancient human vestiges. A few examples are given here but precise directions should be obtained locally since most monuments, like pin pricks in a vast mountainous terrain, require a hike, and are difficult to find. Most are in poor condition. Near the commune of Itxassou is situated the Col de Méatse with numerous prehistoric stone monuments, including several cromlechs. Itxassou is S of Bordeaux and SE of Bayonne and is reached by taking the D 932 to Espellette, then the D 918, 3.5 km SE. Near the commune of Bidarray may be seen the Monolith of Artzamendi, 4.2 m long and weighing about four tons. It appears to be a fallen menhir or one that was never erected. Another, the Monolith of Baigura, is of similar size and also appears as if it was never set up vertically in the manner of a menhir. Bidarray is about 12 km S of Itxassou on the D 918. In the commune of Lecumberri S of Bordeaux and SE of St.-Jean-Pied-de-Port on D 18, is the Necropolis of Apatesaro consisting of a number of cromlechs of about four to five metres in diameter and containing crematorial burial sites. The Dolmen de Gaxteenia with three standing stones and triangular capstone (on private property but visible) is located in the commune of Mendive SE of St.Jean-Pied-de-Port 6.5 km on D 18. Dolmen de Buluntza, about 15 m in diameter, in the commune of Ahaxe, stands in a field to the W of the Col de Buluntza at an altitude of 672 m. It has three large stones and an enormous fractured capstone. A little SE of St.-JeanPied-de-Port off the D 18/D 20.\n\n32\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nIn the commune of Ascain in the shadow of the La Rhune (Larrun) mountain are the Cromlechs of Gorostiarra (nine circles fairly well preserved). The Menhir de Gaztenbakarre 2.3 m high and triangular in shape is in the commune of Sare about 6 km south of Ascain on the D 4. Walk up to Trois Fontaines and the menhir can be seen in the valley to the W, 150 m lower down. To reach Ascain take the D 918, 6 km S of St.-Jean-de-Luz. For the cromlechs, walk on E to the edge of the woods, cross the river at the old dam, and ascend straight up toward the rocks on the left. (21/2-3 hours). Not a difficult walk. Near Olhette 4.5 km W of Ascain on the D 4 is a fairly well-preserved stretch of Medieval road along the gorge of the river Insola. The Roman trophy of Urkulu dates from the end of the first century B.C. There were only four built: one in Romania (now destroyed), and two more in France – at Le Perthus and La Turbie (see entries). Built of calcite, it originally had a conical roof of stone covered with earth and grass. The trophy was mounted on top and consisted of bronze arms (lances) of the defeated. (The Romans were already using iron weapons by this time.) While the tower is actually situated in Spain, access is only possible through France. It is some 120 m in diameter at the base and nearly 4 m high (originally probably 4.50 m). Located S of St.-Jean-Pied-de-Port approx. 48 km SE on the Spanish border. Take the D 301, then D 428, 31 km and the tower can be seen on the left on top of the mountain. Walk up. It can also be reached via Arnéguy, 16.5 km from here, on a very winding road.\n\nPérigueux Dordogne Sights: Gallo-Roman Vesone still displays substantial remains today, even though it was used as a quarry by Medieval builders. In the city park is an enceinte which contains a few fragments of the first-century elliptical amphitheatre which reputedly had a capacity for 20,000 spectators. The Tour de Vesone, a round tower some 24 m high with an internal diameter of 17 m, was the cella of a second-century Gallo-Roman temple dedicated to Vessuna, tutelary god of the Roman city. It had a colonnade and stairway with pillars on each side. Located at the end of rue Romaine (S). The twelfth-century Château Barrière, a fortified house with a keep, together with the Maison Romane, is built over the foundations of the fourth-century Roman wall. The wall was constructed\n\nAquitaine: Périgueux. Tour de Vésone AQUITAINE\n\n33\n\nduring the earliest barbarian invasions with materials taken from Roman monuments. The Porte Normande, which lies at the N end of the Château Barrière, is part of the protective wall made from very large stones taken in desperate times from temples, public buildings and tombs. Its name comes from the role it played during an attack by Vikings. Under cover are excavations of the first-century Gallo-Roman Villa Pompeia. Part of a wall from the third century is visible but the Porte de Mars, in a private garden, cannot be seen. The cathedral of St.-Front contains a number of Merovingian sarcophagi.\n\nLocation: Périgueux is E of Bordeaux about 190 km on N 89-E 70. The S.I. will give out a map showing where the Gallo-Roman enceinte is located.\n\nPeyrehorade Landes Sights: Sorde-l’Abbaye. The former Benedictine abbey church is built over a fourthcentury Gallo-Roman villa. An excavation outside shows the well, atrium and foundations, and also substantial remains of the baths inside including caldarium, tepidarium and frigidarium. The latter had a mosaic floor, part of which is still visible. The mosaics exhibited came from the outside excavations. There are also three Visigothic graves, still containing skeletal remains, along with a roof section with tiles and an apoditarium for massages beside the pool. Nearby, at Cagnotte, the Romanesque church contains a marble fifth-century sarcophagus and another seventh-ninth century tomb hollowed out of the trunk of a beech tree.\n\nLocation: Peyrehorade is S of Bordeaux and E of Bayonne. Sorde l’Abbaye is SE of the town 4 km on D 29. Cagnotte is 7 km NE on D 29 on a winding road.\n\nPlassac Gironde Sight: Near the church excavations have revealed three successive Gallo-Roman villas built between the first and fifth centuries. Whereas the first two were built in Roman style, the third was decorated with polychrome mosaics in Aquitanian style. Museum in situ.\n\nLocation: N of Bordeaux and 3.5 km S of Blaye on D 669. Site is under the church in town.\n\nRocamadour Dordogne Sight: Grotte des Merveilles. Apart from its natural beauty, this small cave has paintings dating back to the Solutrean period. Represented are horses, a cat, the outline of a deer and outlines of hands.\n\nLocation: E of Bordeaux and S of Brive. Take the N 20-E 09 out of Brive to Cressensac,\n\n34\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\n17 km, then the N 140 for 29 km to where the D 673 crosses it. Turn W on this road for 4 km.\n\nRouffignac Dordogne Sight: Grotte de Rouffignac, also known as La Grotte aux Cent Mammouths, with some 250 paintings or engravings of prehistoric animals dating from the mid or late Magdalenian period. Included are mammoth, rhinoceros, horses, ibex and bison. The galleries are several km underground and reached by a small train. Expect about an hour for the visit.\n\nLocation: E of Bordeaux and NW of Les Eyzies. Take the D 47 NW to Manaurie and continue another 7 km to where the D 32 forks, right, toward Rouffignac. Signposted.\n\nSt.-Emilion Gironde Sights: In the Place du Marché stands the Eglise Monolithe, hewn out of a single, solid block of rock by Benedictine monks in the eighth century. Later it was used as an ancient burial ground with tombs chiselled in the rock. In nearby St.-Sulpice de Faleyrens, standing in a vineyard, is a large 5 m-high menhir, Pierrefitte, said to mark the old river harbour of St.-Emilion. Signposted in town. Near Lussac, slightly N of St.-Emilion on the D 122, then N on CD 21 toward Petit Palais, is the Megalithe de Picampeau, a large stone with hollowed-out bowl, a trough leading from it, perhaps sacrificial. It is attributed to the Druids.\n\nLocation: E of Bordeaux 25 km to Libourne on N 89-D 70, then SE 8 km on D 670 and St.Emilion lies just to the N, 3 km. For the menhir, leave town in the direction of Libourne. After 1.7 km on D 19, the menhir is on the left beside the sign. At Lussac, from the sign megalithe in the village, go 300 m following road, and at fork go right, up a path, 500 m to the woods. The stone is in a clearing to the left with an explanatory sign.

Pierrefitte AQUITAINE\n\n35\n\nVal d’Ossau Pyrénées Atlantiques Sights: There are several sights along this valley which lies between Pau and the Spanish frontier. Arudy advertises a Roman bridge but in fact there are only some foundations underneath a modern bridge, crossed as you leave the town on the way to Buzy and Oléron. Bilheres has several cromlechs nearby but they are mostly overgrown and only one is in fair condition. Excellent hike up there, however, and magnificent views over the Val d’Ossau. Buzy has a dolmen with eight standing stones situated on the edge of town. The capstone is in the shape of a turtle shell but the entrance passage is filled in. Coming from Arudy on D 90, the dolmen is in a picnic area on the right, immediately after the turn-off toward Bescat. Signposted.\n\nLocation: S of Bordeaux. Leave Pau on D 934 going S. Arudy is ca. 23 km. Buzy is NW of Arudy on D 920, and Bilheres is approx. 30 km S of Pau on D 934. To find the cromlechs, go to Bielle, then take the road to Bilheres, 3 km W. Go through town, pass church and follow signs for Le Bénou. Continue past a small chapel on the right. 300 m after this turn right up road marked with no entry sign (from the church in the village to turnoff past chapel is ca. 2.2 km). Walk up path, through gate taking the left fork up the hill when it divides. As the road swings to the right, there is a wide grass swathe to the left going uphill between the bushes and trees. The cromlechs are on top of this hill, on the left, the best one being the last in the group. About a twentyminute walk from the gate.\n\nVilleneuve-sur-Lot Lot-et-Garonne Sight: In Villeneuve, next to the fire station and across from the prison, is an excavation of a Gallo-Roman site. The Archaeological Society building is opposite, next to the church, where foundations of buildings and an extensive water channel system are to be seen. There is an exposition in the afternoons of July and August.\n\nLocation: SE of Bordeaux on A 62-E 72 to Agen, then N, about 29 km on N 21. Site can be found by turning off the N 21 at sign: EYSSES.

It forms the core of the Massif Central, a rugged and geologically diverse area. The most well-known peak is the Puy de Dôme, west and a little north of Clermont-Ferrand. Celtic tribes associated the summit with the residence of the god Lug, and in the Middle Ages it was thought to be the home of witches. Here are some of the oldest human settlements in France, dating back to the lower Paleolithic. Some fifty dolmens and twenty or more menhirs attest to Neolithic communities in the region. During the Bronze Age, the adjacent Rhône Valley became the major tin and amber trade route. Of the Celts who then came to the area, the Averni, who gave their name to it, produced the famous leader Vercingetorix (victim of Roman expansion). With the fall of the Roman Empire the Visigoths came to control the region on the right bank of the Rhône while the Burgundians ruled the left bank. After the battle of Vouillé and the defeat of the Visigoths, the province passed into the hands of the Franks, and the Auvergne later became subject to the Carolingian kingdom of Aquitaine. In 1095 Pope Urban II preached the first crusade from Clermont-Ferrand, which is today the major city of the region.\n\n38\n\nFRANCE: 1001 SIGHTS\n\nClermont-Ferrand Puy-de-Dôme Sights: The cathedral of Notre Dame de l’Assomption incorporates an altar made up from a sixth-century sarcophagus.
