It is a country eminently suited to the new method of road travel, for with the spaces between the towns traversed by wide national ways going to their objectives as straight as the contours of the country will permit, no one feels that the presence of a rapid car is destroying the peace or beauty of the neighbourhood. And yet in the tour described in this book there is a huge diversity of scenery, from the wheat plains of the North to the mountains and sea of the South.\n\nGreat pains have been taken to embody in the small compass of a book that will easily slip into an overcoat pocket all that is essential for the motorist to know both before and during the tour. At the same time, the large clear type of the first volume of this series has been retained in order that there may be no difficulty in reading while the car is in motion.\n\nDr. Kirkâs practical notes are the result of much experience, and they need only be supplemented by a word as to hotel charges. In every case the wise{vi} tourist discusses prices with the manager or proprietor before he takes his car into the courtyard or garage. By doing so he knows exactly what his bill will amount to in the morning, and he is quite sure of no overcharge. If no arrangement is made on arrival, one must be prepared for any charge, notwithstanding the prices given in guides or the hotel books published by the Touring Club de France.\n\nFor those who either do not possess cars or do not wish to take their own abroad, the simplest method is to hire a car in England. The authorâs experience of hiring from the Daimler Company has been so satisfactory that he is glad of this opportunity of recommending their cars. To Mr. A. H. Hallam Murray the author is greatly indebted for permission to reproduce four of his delightful pictures from âOn the Old Road through France to Florence.â\n\nAs in the previous volume of this series, a list of dates of prominent events in French history and of the Kings of France is given in the Appendix.\n\nThe author would greatly appreciate any suggestions for improving the book, and would much like to hear of any inaccuracies which may have crept in.\n\nGORDON HOME.\n\n43, Gloucester Street,\n\nLondon, S.

By Marquise3622\n\nNOTES FOR DRIVERS\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST ON THE ROUTE\n\nIn spite of the fact that Havre is a port of such magnitude, and that its tonnage approximates to{4} a quarter of that possessed by France, one is dependent on the state of the tide for disembarking a car when, after the night crossing, one finds the ship tied up to the Grand Quai.\n\nInstead of the ranges of dock-sheds and the giant cranes of Southampton, the ship seems to be lying along the side of a second-rate French street, and one looks in vain for the great steel arm that should silently let down a hook to lift the car like a toy from the shipâs lower deck. So if the tide should be low, one must wait until the deck is level with the quay—a delay more often than otherwise a boon to a party adjusting itself and its luggage for a long tour.\n\nAlthough Havre is an infant port when compared to Marseilles, with its founding by the Greeks, there are things worth remembering about the place. When Rollo with his Norsemen in their black-sailed ships hovered at the mouth of the Seine in preparation for their attack upon Rouen, there was no Havre, and it was not until six centuries had passed that FranÃ§ois I. gave the order to Guillon le Roy, the Commandant of Harfleur, on the opposite shore of the estuary of the Seine, to construct a port for great ships, owing to the necessity for an ocean seaport after the dis{5}covery of America. In 1514 the making of the port began, and its growth has been continued up to the present day.\n\nOf the original town and its defences nothing is left, for even the old tower of the chÃ¢teau in which Cardinal Mazarin imprisoned the Princes of CondÃ© and of Conti, and the Duke of Longueville, has gone, and the only relic of the century that saw the birth of the city is the Church of Notre Dame. It stands in the Rue de Paris, near the Grand Quai, and is a mixture of the last flicker of Gothic and of Renaissance architecture. The building{6} would appear to be the successor of the original Church of Notre Dame de GrÃ¢ce, founded for the sailors of the port, which then bore the title of Le Havre-de-GrÃ¢ce. In 1562 the Huguenots invited the English to enter the town, and the church tower was used as a gun platform, so that an effective fire on the royal camp could be maintained. But the townsmen paid for this by having the spire and walls of their church taken down. The rebuilding began in 1574, and the completion of the aisles and chapels took place in the following century.\n\nHenri IV., Richelieu, and Colbert, who employed Vauban, not only improved the harbours, but added to the defences of the town, which in 1694 and 1759 resisted English bombardments. In 1856 the walls were removed, and the town now relies on three forts.\n\nLEAVING HAVRE FOR ROUEN\n\nThe road to Rouen is through the Rue de Normandie, and this rapidly brings one to the suburb of Graville, where, on the left side of the road, on a hill above the Town Hall, stands the church of the Abbey of Ste. Honorine. It is an interesting building of the eleventh century, with{7} curiously carved corbels outside, and within capitals as grotesque, and the sarcophagus which contained the remains of St. Honoria. Pilgrims, it is said, were just as numerous at Graville after the relics of the saint had been removed to Conflans for safety at the time of the Norman invasion!\n\nThe view over the Seine from the abbey church is exceedingly fine, and on sunny mornings the broad river shimmers in a silvery light.\n\nHARFLEUR,\n\nto which the tramway comes, is a quaint town, with narrow streets and a flamboyant church, whose highly enriched spire and curiously tall north porch, recessed in the wall and full of elaborate carving, give one a foretaste of that wealth of detail and medieval charm which a tour through Normandy offers to the stranger.\n\nEither the walls of Harfleur must in 1415 have been exceedingly strong or their defenders of exceptional resource and courage, for in that year Henry V., with 30,000 English, besieged the town when the garrison numbered only 400, and yet for no less than forty days did they maintain the defence. It was 75 Englishmen to 1 Frenchman; but it generally took a few weeks to get through{8} medieval walls, unless treachery or hunger came to the help of the attackers. Harfleur languished as a port owing to the shifting sand of the river-mouth, and the growth of Havre put an end to its commercial importance.\n\nBending to the left after passing the church, and going to the right almost immediately at a fork, Harfleur is soon left behind, as the road ascends the side of a green valley containing one or two large country houses.\n\nThe farms stand compactly inside a hedge of trees, which almost hides the buildings, and suggests{9} the tun, or hedge, of the villages of our Saxon ancestors. A straight poplar-bordered road leads past pretty thatched farmyards, with timber-framed barns, to St. Romain de Colbosc. Besides the sixteenth-century cross in the cemetery there is a twelfth-century lepersâ chapel, with paintings inside, but it has for long been reduced to a mere farm-building.\n\nIn St. Romain one turns to the right for Lillebonne, and soon afterwards the road bears nearly due east, and runs straight for Lillebonne, descending into the picturesque wooded valley of the Bolbec River with several turns.\n\nLILLEBONNE\n\nIf there was reason to complain of the juvenility of Havre, there is sufficient antiquity at Lillebonne to satisfy the most exacting, for the presence of a Roman theatre indicates the former existence of an important Roman city, and there is some reason for believing that this Julia Bona of the Romans was built where the chief town of the tribe of the Caletes stood. The heavy squared stones that formed the seats were to a great extent carried away to the other side of Caudebec to build the Abbey of St. Wandrille, and one can only get{10} a small idea of the perfect building from the rough inner stonework of the two lowest tiers. Even these were only revealed through the excavations which took place between 1812 and 1840. Many of the discoveries made in the excavations are to be seen in the museum at Rouen.\n\nOf exceptional interest to Englishmen is the castle of Lillebonne, for in the great Norman hall—now also demolished—William the Conqueror gathered together a great assemblage of his viscounts, his warrior bishops, and men of lesser potency, and before them all announced his intention of invading England. The reception of this portentous declaration was mixed, many of the barons being unwilling to consent to so hazardous an enterprise, in spite of the enthusiasm of the Dukeâs particular friends. Notwithstanding this lukewarmness, Williamâs determination eventually carried away all opposition, and the invasion âscareâ became an accomplished fact. That the historic hall should have survived until a wealthy cotton-spinner, who had purchased the castle, destroyed it in cold blood is distressing to the visitor who longs to feast his eyes on the building that once held that stirring council. What he sees to-day is the ruins of the thirteenth-century castle built{11} on the site of the Conquerorâs stronghold, and the great round donjon did not come into existence until long after William had been gathered to his fathers. The church has a beautiful crocketed spire of the fifteenth century, similar to the one seen at Harfleur.\n\nAs one climbs out of the valley the road winds in different directions, and gives charming views over the Seine, with its passing steamers, and the distant green country beyond.\n\nTwo pretty villages, La Frenaye and St. Arnoult, are passed, each with its mossy thatched roofs and quaint little church, its particularly attractive half-timbered houses, and here and there an outside wooded staircase; then follows a winding descent into that most romantic of towns—\n\nCAUDEBEC-EN-CAUX\n\nAlthough artists have painted the church, the river, and the old streets and waterway for years, there are still many of the most appealing aspects of the place that seem to remain outside the attainments of the painters and sketchers who reveal the results of their work there. There is one particular old street of houses, with romantic frontages on one side rising from the green water{12} of a narrow canal, which is not easy to forget. Not only are the greens and greys and reds and ochres a delight to the eye, and the detail of the windows, overhanging eaves, and timber framing of the walls and gables particularly attractive, but one also gets peeps into interiors, where one can see old folk seated by windows with faces and curious black headgears such as Holbein and Rembrandt painted.\n\nEven Lisieux cannot eclipse Caudebec in the completeness of its antique streets, for here there have been few attempts to hide the picturesque timber fronts with stucco, and there are half a dozen narrow streets by the church where the buildings, with the passage of the centuries, have let their time-worn gables nod towards one another until the strip of sky that the builders left has been appreciably narrowed. Then, in wandering through these ancient ways one is suddenly confronted with a wealth of the most delicately carved stone, and looking up, one sees the exquisitely graceful tower of the church, with its profusion of ornament and its crocketed and coroneted spire rising above. The western entrance is often open, so that the passer-by may see the lacelike ornament of the doorway thrown out against the velvet blackness\n\n{13}\n\nof the interior, a darkness relieved by the brilliant fifteenth and sixteenth century stained glass of the Flamboyant windows.\n\nHenri IV., when he stayed at Caudebec, said that the town had la plus jolie chapelle que jâai jamais vue, but added that the jewel was badly set. The building was commenced in 1426, and in 1484 Guillaume Le Tellier, the master mason, died, and was buried in the Lady-chapel of the glorious building he had created.\n\nThere existed in the sixteenth century an island in the Seine opposite Caudebec, and it is stated by Mrs. Macquoid that there were âthree beautiful churchesâ on it until the mascaret, a tidal bore, which at certain full moons in the spring and autumn equinoxes comes up the river with tremendous force, swept the whole island away. By 1641 the island had appeared again, but the mascaret again demolished it. The wall of water that rushes up the narrowing river-mouth varies from 6 to 12 feet in height, and its force is sufficient to dislodge and carry away great stones.\n\nCaudebec began its existence as a fishing village under the control of the Abbey of St. Wandrille, and, with its convenient quay, soon grew prosperous.{14} When Henry V. besieged the town, it held out for six months.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War the Germans occupied the old town, but fortunately did no damage to it.\n\nIt is with keen reluctance that one leaves the sunny quay of Caudebec, with its busy market scenes, its steam ferry-boat, and the lovely views up and down the curving river. However, the road follows the Seine, and one enjoys for mile after mile lovely views across the wide belt of silvery water, backed by sweeping green forests.\n\nST. WANDRILLE\n\nAbout two kilometres from Caudebec a turning to the left leads up in a few minutes to St. Wandrille, where the ruins of the Norman abbey stand in a pretty valley. The conventual buildings are now the residence of M. Maurice Maeterlinck, the dramatist and author, who recently performed an historical play in the refectory and cloisters of the abbey, the audience moving from one part of the buildings to another for each successive scene.\n\nThe abbey was originally called Fontenelle, after the stream that flows through the valley. It was founded in the middle of the seventh century by{15} a pupil of St. Columba, and the early buildings fell a prey to the harrying Norsemen, who left the place in ruins. In 1033, having been rebuilt, the abbey was dedicated to St. Wandrille, but a fire did much destruction in the thirteenth century, and in 1631 the tower and spire of the church fell, and smashed down the nave and aisles, the Lady-chapel, and the choir-stalls. What remains of the church is not so remarkable as the ornate cloisters of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the imposing Norman refectory, with its vaulted roof of the fifteenth century and its fine Flamboyant windows.\n\nReturning to the main road, and continuing towards Rouen, one soon catches sight of the two towers of the abbey of JumiÃ¨ges rising above trees beyond a bend of the winding river. At the small village of Yainville, with a Norman church, the road to JumiÃ¨ges goes to the right, and the singular beauty of this stately ruin justifies the dÃ©tour.\n\nJUMIÃGES\n\nThe entrance to the abbey is at a lodge gate on the left side of the road in the pleasant village, and the concierge—a quite charming type of country-woman—accompanies one through the admirably-{16}kept ruins, and afterwards to the museum adjoining, where is preserved, among other carved stones from the ruined buildings, the slab of black marble under which was buried the heart of Agnes Sorel, the beautiful mistress of Charles VII. She died near JumiÃ¨ges in 1449, after the birth of her fourth daughter, and her body was buried at Loches, which is passed through on the way southwards from Tours (see Section VI.).\n\nThe impressiveness of the twin towers of the west end of the great church is due in part to the extreme simplicity of the Norman work—for the buildings were completed just before the Norman Conquest—and also to their great height of 328 feet. On entering it is hard to believe that until 1790 the abbey and its great church were in a perfect state of preservation, for the roofs have gone except in the aisles, where the stones of the vault have been in some places so disturbed by roots and frosts that collapses are imminent. There are traces of orange-coloured painting on the arches, and the stone is of a warm cream, which looks singularly beautiful when afternoon shadows are falling from arches and pillars. There are only the foundations of the semicircular apse, with its nine chapels, and the gaps in the east end of the church are beautified by{17} the presence of tall larches that droop their graceful branches over the broken moss-grown walls. The fourteenth-century chapel on the south side, dedicated to St. Pierre, is also in a state of ruin.\n\nSt. Philibert founded JumiÃ¨ges in 654, about the same time as St. Wandrille was begun, and it also suffered terribly at the hands of the Northmen, who tortured and massacred without mercy, and left the once prosperous abbey a shattered ruin.\n\nThe rebuilding was encouraged by William Longsword, the son of Rollo; but the builder of the Norman church which stands to-day was Abbot Robert of JumiÃ¨ges, who was afterwards appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Edward the Confessor, who had been educated at JumiÃ¨ges under his care. The buildings, completed and consecrated in 1067, remained in use until 1793, the date of the Suppression, so that, with an interval of about a century in its early history, JumiÃ¨ges existed as a monastery for 1,139 years, and in that period was ruled by eighty-two abbots.\n\nIt is interesting to know that, although the Benedictines of JumiÃ¨ges contributed a very large sum towards the ransom of Richard I. after his capture on the way home from the Holy Land, the monastery was twice plundered by English armies,{18} and the first occasion was in Edward III.âs reign, when the generosity of the monks seems to have been quite forgotten!\n\nA portion of the buildings belonging to William Longswordâs church is to be seen in the Chapel of St. Pierre already mentioned.\n\nAn interesting legend of the founder of the abbey explains the presence of a wolf at the feet of the saint on a carved stone boss. St. Philibert had given to a convent four leagues from JumiÃ¨ges the laundry work of his abbey, and the Abbess and her nuns washed the linen which was sent to them. One day a wolf ate the ass that carried the washing, but the holy Abbess induced the wicked wolf to carry the baskets, which he did, we read, until the end of his life.\n\nThe greatness and power of the abbey declined very much after the Reformation, and at the time of the Revolution the religious who were dispersed were not numerous.\n\nThe short distance from Yainville has to be retraced, and then, going to the right through a belt of forest, one reaches the banks of the Seine once more, and passes through the little town of Duclair, with its sunny quay and its ferry-boat. There are beautiful views over the river, and as the{19} car runs along the level road one may overtake a steamer that is sliding along with a little pile of water pushed up in front of its bow, and note the contrast of its stained red funnel with the soft green landscape beyond. On the left curious little chambers are cut out of the cliff of chalk, and several form complete cottages. So even and horizontal are the layers of chalk, with bands of flint at different heights, that the cliff has often an exceedingly artificial appearance.\n\nSoon afterwards the road cuts across the neck of another peninsula formed by one of the deep windings of the Seine, and on reaching the foot of the rising ground a turning to the right leads to the hamlet of St. Martin Boscherville, whose noble Church of St. Georges rears its great bulk on the hillside. The hurried tourist might be inclined to pass this by, thinking that of ecclesiastic architecture he has seen enough in this neighbourhood; but throughout the whole of France he will not find another Norman church so perfect as that of St. Georges de Boscherville. The abbey was founded and built in the eleventh century by the Grand Chamberlain of William the Conqueror, Raoul de Tancarville, a fact proclaimed in an inscription above the chief portal; and the great{20} church, built at the time when England was newly subjected to the Norman, stands to-day, with the exception of the western turrets, exactly as the original builders left it.\n\nThe transepts are remarkable for their galleries, similar to those in Winchester Cathedral; and the chapter-house, which is later than the church, being Transitional in style, should also be seen. The sixteenth-century tomb of Le Roulx, the last Abbot, is in front of the altar.\n\nOn resuming the journey, the hill just mentioned is negotiated with some considerable winding, which enables one to get especially fine views over the wooded country to the west, with the big church in the middle distance, and the gleaming river showing its snaky windings on either side.\n\nAfter passing through a belt of typical French forest, composed of thin trees without beauty or individuality, one begins the long curving descent to Rouen, the historic capital of Normandy. The city appeals so much to the student of history that this first view of the place as a whole, threaded by its broad river, and dominated by the fretted spire and beautiful towers of cathedral and churches, is one that stands out vividly in the memory when other impressions have faded.{21}\n\nDIEPPE TO ROUEN (36 miles—58 kilometres)\n\nThis is a direct road, with a few hills, the ascent from the river at Sanqueville and the winding descent at Malaunay being the only ones worth mentioning.\n\nBOULOGNE TO ROUEN (109Â½ miles—176 kilometres)\n\nThis road is through the little town of Samer, where there is an interesting fifteenth-century church and the ruins of the Abbey of St. Wulmer. Soon afterwards there is a steep hill.\n\nMontreuil-sur-Mer has a Palais de Justice, which was formerly part of a Carmelite convent, and the college and Ãcole dâInfanterie occupy the buildings of the Abbey of Ste. Austreberthe. The chapel of the Gothic HÃ´tel Dieu has a curious altar-screen, and the very interesting Church{22} of St. Saulve dates from the twelfth century. The view seawards down the Canche from the citadel, which is surrounded by towers and walls of the Middle Ages, is remarkably fine.\n\nOn the road to Abbeville there is a steep ascent at Nampont St. Martin, and a steep descent to Bernay-en-Ponthieu. The forest of CrÃ©cy lies to the left of the road, and on the farther side of it is the medieval battlefield, where the English army, under Edward III., crushingly defeated the French in 1346.\n\nAbbeville is an interesting old town, still possessing some very good specimens of its domestic architecture of the thirteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. The best are the Maison FranÃ§ois I., with richly carved woodwork, at 29, Rue de la Tannerie; No. 2 in the same street (sixteenth century); 7, Rue du Pont de Boulogne; 3 and 5, Rue de lâHÃ´tel de Ville; 41, Rue de la Boucherie; and, besides these, several others will be noticed in a walk through the town. There are also some good town houses, or hÃ´tels, in the Rue St. Gilles. The Church of St. Vulfran belongs to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and is remarkable for its fine restored faÃ§ade, with beautifully sculptured doorways. The interior is{23} not remarkable, except for two curved altar-screens.\n\nThe HÃ´tel de Ville has a bell-tower dating from the beginning of the thirteenth century, and the library in the Jardin Public dâEmonville contains a Gospel which belonged to Charlemagne.\n\nNeufchÃ¢tel-en-Bray is famous for its cheeses, and is the chief town of the district, which has been called âthe dairy of Paris.â It was at one time called Driencourt, the name having been altered when a new castle was built by Henri Beauclerc. The Church of Notre Dame, of various periods from the twelfth century, has a sixteenth-century tower. A passage from the Grand Rue leads to the Maison des Templiers, a most picturesque timber-framed building, with much carved woodwork.\n\nFrom NeufchÃ¢tel to above the River Arques the road climbs, dropping steeply down to that river at St. Martin Omonville. After leaving the valley the road is comparatively level to Rouen.\n\nCALAIS TO BOULOGNE\n\nAlong the coast, 22 miles—35 kilometres By Marquise, 20 miles—32 kilometres\n\nThe coast route is the most interesting, as it gives splendid views of the Straits of Dover and{24} the white cliffs of England. Sangatte (7Â½ kilometres from Calais) is famous in connection with M. BlÃ©riotâs cross-Channel flight, and for the abandoned workings of the Channel tunnel.\n\n{25}\n\nFour miles before passing over Cape Grisnez one passes the little town of Wissant, associated with the Roman Portus Itius, from which Julius CÃ¦sar sailed when he made his first reconnaissance of the coast of Britain. Beyond the great headland is Ambleteuse, the landing-place of the fugitive James II. at 3 a.m. on Christmas Day, 1688. The King had left Rochester on the night of the 23rd, and had passed by a back-door on to the Medway, where he boarded the smack which brought him to the French coast.\n\nAt the next river-mouth is Wimereux Harbour,{26} the landing-place of Prince Louis Napoleon in August, 1840. Having received no support, the Prince and his followers were easily captured, and in Boulogne one can see the thirteenth-century chÃ¢teau, now converted into barracks, where he was imprisoned.\n\nBoulogne Cathedral was erected in 1869 on the site of the original Norman church, built in 1104 by Ida, the mother of Geoffrey de Bouillon.{27}\n\nSECTION II\n\nROUEN TO EVREUX, 32Â½ MILES (52 KILOMETRES)\n\nDISTANCES ALONG THE ROUTE\n\nKil.Miles. Rouen to Pont de lâArche1811Â¼ Pont de lâArche to Louviers106Â¼ Louviers to Evreux2415\n\nNOTES FOR DRIVERS\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST ON THE ROUTE\n\nROUEN\n\nOn the sunlit slopes that went down to the swamps by the Seine, where stands the Rouen of to-day, there were Celtic inhabitants in remote times; and when the advancing sway of Rome brought civilization to the north of France, the light of history illuminates the spot, and reveals the presence of a town called Ratuma, the chief centre of the tribe of the Veliocassians. The Romans modified the name to Rotomagus, and in the second century it is believed to have received the first seeds of Christianity. From South Wales, the home of so much evangelizing enthusiasm, there arrived, about the year 260, a missionary called St. Mellon, who became in time the first Bishop of Rouen. This may, perhaps, sound a far-away piece of information, belonging too much to what is legendary{29} to be of much service as a guide to the antiquities of Rouen; but it is not so, for beneath the Church of St. Gervais, a building in the modern Norman style, there can still be seen, in a crypt of the fourth or fifth century, the tomb in which was laid the body of that early missionary. The crypt was probably built soon after the year 404 by St. Victrice, the sixth to succeed St. Mellon, and the body must, therefore, have been placed there more than a century after his death. It remained there until 1562, when the Huguenots opened the tomb and removed the remains.\n\nThe Cathedral.—Building Dates\n\nSt. Victrice was the first to put up any church on the site of the present cathedral, and the numerous Bishops who succeeded him rebuilt and enlarged the Early Christian structure until it must have been something far removed from the simple rudeness of the first building. Rouen, however, was destined to frequent disaster. A fire in 556 was followed by a plague, and the city suffered much in the disorder which followed the death of Charles the Great. Therefore, in the year 841, when the Northmen began their raids upon the north of France, they found only a lean city to plunder; and when Rollo became first Duke of Normandy, and was converted to Christianity, he had almost to refound the capital of his new dominion. It is{31} therefore in no way surprising that the crypt of St. Gervais is the sole survival yet discovered of the buildings of the earlier city.\n\nAfter the paralysis of fear which gripped Christendom at the approach of the year 1000 had passed off, with the unchanged procession of normal days and nights brought in by the new century, there came so great an enthusiasm for church building that the cathedral of Rouen was reconstructed on a larger and finer scale. The new structure was consecrated on October 1, 1063, by Archbishop Maurilius, in the presence of William the Norman.\n\nIt is quite possible that this church was of greater magnificence than those of JumiÃ¨ges or St. Georges de Boscherville, and perhaps even more perfect than St. Ãtienne at Caen; but whatever theories one may care to form must be built upon the style of the lower portion of the north-west tower—the Tour St. Romain—for in the year 1200 a disastrous fire destroyed the great building, and all that now exists of the Norman church is this portion of a tower and some indications of Romanesque work that can be discovered in a few other places. The havoc a fire can work in a Norman church even at the present time, in spite of modern fire extinguishing appliances, has been very forcibly illustrated by{32} the recent burning of the abbey church of Selby, in Yorkshire, in which the terrific heat burnt halfway through stone piers of enormous thickness.\n\nThe reconstruction of the cathedral appears to have been undertaken soon after the disaster, and was commenced at the east end, where one finds that the chapels of the apse and transepts were built first and the choir soon afterwards, for it was finished in the Early French style. Between 1202 and 1220 the nave, choir, transepts, and central tower would appear to have been built, and before St. Louis (IX.) visited the cathedral in 1255, the magnificent church, as it is to be seen to-day, had assumed an appearance of completeness.\n\nThe embellishment of the great pile continued right through the centuries that followed, until the influence of the Renaissance shows itself in the central porch of the west front. In the fourteenth century the Lady-chapel was built, and in the fifteenth the Tour de Beurre climbed upwards, while the money provided by the indulgences sold, giving permission to eat butter in Lent, was helping to provide the funds. This tower, therefore, together with the uppermost portion of the Tour St. Romain, the western rose-window, and a good deal of decoration on each of the porches,{33} belong to the Flamboyant period, corresponding to the Perpendicular of English architecture.\n\nAt the base of the Tour St. Romain there still stands the lodge of the porter, whose duties from very early times right up to 1700 included the care of the fierce watch-dogs who were at night let loose in the cathedral to guard its many precious treasures from robbers. How much would we give for a glimpse of one of those porters walking through the cavernous gloom of the echoing aisles, with his lamp throwing strange shadows from the great slouching dogs!\n\nThe misereres of the choir-stalls were carved between 1457 and 1469, and should be seen for the vivid details they reveal of nearly every trade and employment, as well as the costumes of the period when the Flamboyant style was in vogue.\n\nThe tombs in the cathedral bring one into close touch with the Dukes of Normandy and their successors on the throne of England. In the easternmost chapels on either side of the nave are the tombs of Rollo, the first Duke of Normandy, and his son, William Longsword, who was murdered in 943. The statues were made in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and have been restored. The inscription on Rolloâs tomb says:{34}\n\nâHere lies Rollo, the first Duke, founder and father of Normandy, of which he was at first the terror and the scourge, but afterwards the restorer. Baptized in 912 by FranÃ§on, Archbishop of Rouen; died in 917. His remains were at first deposited in the ancient sanctuary, at present the upper end of the nave. The altar having been removed, the remains of the Prince were placed here by the blessed Maurille, Archbishop of Rouen, in the year 1063.â\n\nA thirteenth-century effigy of Richard CÅur de Lion, discovered in 1838, lies outside the southern railing of the choir. The heart was found in a triple casket of lead, wood, and silver. Some of the dust can be seen in the Museum of Antiquities, whither the original effigy of Henry II.âs eldest son, Henry Plantagenet, has also been taken, the one in the cathedral being modern. On the left side of the high altar is the tomb of John, Duke of Bedford, Regent under Henry VI., and on the north side of the choir is the mutilated effigy of Archbishop Maurice, who died in 1235.\n\nThe two grandest monuments are facing one another in the Lady-chapel. The finer is that of Louis de BrÃ©zÃ©, who was Grand Seneschal of Normandy. It is an extremely good example of early Renaissance work, carried out in black marble and{35} alabaster. The splendid equestrian figure in the upper part gives the monument a most imposing character. At the head of the recumbent effigy is the figure of Diane de Poitiers, who raised the memorial to her husband after his death in 1531. She subsequently left her name written prominently on the page of history by becoming the mistress of the Dauphin, afterwards Henri II. At the castle of Chenonceaux and at Fontainebleau we shall see the homes of this famous widow (see Section V.).\n\nOn the west side of the great monument is the beautiful canopied recess of the Flamboyant period, where the effigies of Pierre de BrÃ©zÃ© and his wife lay until they were removed in 1769. Pierre was the first Grand Seneschal of Normandy when the province was restored to France, as a result of the work of Jeanne dâArc. He was the favourite of Charles VII., and was prominent in the reconquest of Normandy, finally losing his life in the Battle of MontlhÃ©ry in 1465.\n\nOpposite is the tomb of the famous Cardinal Georges dâAmboise, whose lifelike figure is shown kneeling under a beautiful canopy. He was made Bishop of Montauban when he was only fourteen, and was elected Archbishop of Rouen at the early age of thirty-three. The story of his{36} election is interesting. On the death of Archbishop Robert de Croixmare, Charles VIII. hinted that he would like the canons to choose the Duke of Orleans, and by so doing gave some annoyance. However, on August 21, 1493, when the crowds in Rouen were wondering what was going to happen, the canons retired to the chapter-house, as was their custom, and each took the oath to vote according to conscience. Then, all kneeling down, they sang the Veni Creator Spiritus, and prayed that they might make the right choice, after which all rose to their feet as one man, saying, âGeorges dâAmboise shall be Archbishop.â This remarkable unanimity was based on the wonderful promise the Cardinal showed even at that age, and to Rouen he became a benefactor, for whose wisdom and equity in administration and for the splendour of whose gifts the city has still reason for gratitude. If he had lived earlier in the century, it is conceivable that his influence would have prevented the tragedy of the death of Jeanne dâArc. He was the builder of the splendid Tour de Beurre and the Flamboyant work of the west front of the cathedral, and he improved the cityâs supply of water, as well as its sanitation. Further than that, he became, as Prime Minister under the easy-going Louis XII.,{37} the virtual ruler of France; for the King was always ready to let the wise Cardinal act for him, usually saying, âLeave it to George.â He died in 1510.\n\nThe other figure on the tomb is that of the second Cardinal of the same name, who was a nephew of the statesman.\n\nThe great bell which was given by the Archbishop to be hung in the Tour de Beurre, and was named Georges dâAmboise, was in 1793 melted down to make cannon for the Republicans. The thirteenth-century glass in the sacristy and the two adjoining windows is a foretaste of the glories of Chartres.\n\nThe erection of the great spire of open ironwork on the central tower began in 1827, replacing the wooden spire finished in 1550, and destroyed by lightning in 1822. It is one of the tallest spires in the world, and is considered by many writers to be a hideous excrescence on the great Gothic pile; but although it cannot have the romance or charm of stone, its effect at a distance, in spite of its curious finial, is quite the reverse of unpleasing, and when one is near at hand it has a way of hiding itself, or, if it shows at all, it appears so vast and tremendous that its dimensions suppress the{38} criticisms that would flow readily if the spire were half its height.\n\nThe Church of St. Ouen.—To the north-east of the cathedral (see plan) stands the great abbey church of St. Ouen, in the wide open space of the Place de lâHÃ´tel de Ville—as great a contrast to the narrow streets that crowd up to the cathedral as could be imagined. It is for this reason that St. Ouen from without does not call up with any vividness the romance of a medieval church packed into the small space which was all that the encircling defensive walls could afford. But the church of St. Ouen is the most perfect and the most beautiful of the abbey churches of France, and there might be legitimate cause for grumbling if it were impossible to get a clear view of it. There is only space to tell the story of the building in the following list of dates:\n\nSt. Ouen.—Building Dates\n\nThe Church of St. Maclou stands back a few paces from the east side of the Rue de la{40} RÃ©publique, and one comes upon its wondrous display of delicately carved stone all of a sudden. It is an exquisite example of the Flamboyant style, having been commenced in 1436 and completed about 1480. The present spire was only finished in 1868, the previous one, covered with lead, having suffered much through a storm, and later during the Revolution.\n\nThe wonderful doors, with their remarkable carving, and the splendid tympanum above the central one, date between the years 1527 and 1560. In that period it is possible that some of the carving was executed by Jean Goujon, who was afterwards killed in the massacre of St. Bartholomew. St. Maclou was a Scotsman who went to Brittany, was made Bishop of Aleth, and died in 561. The first church dedicated to him was built in the tenth century outside the walls of Rouen. A passage on the north side of the Rue Martainville (which runs from the north side of St. Maclou) leads into the AÃ®tre St. Maclou, a picturesque little cloister built in 1526, surrounding a paved courtyard, which was a burial-ground at the time of the plague of 1348—the Black Death that claimed 100,000 victims in the city.\n\nJeanne dâArc.—The tragedy of the\n\n{41}\n\nmartyrdom,—or, more properly, the murder—of the Maid of Orleans, who saved her country from the English, cannot be forgotten by the visitor to Rouen. There are still houses standing near the cathedral which were there in her day, and were the lodgings of some of her heartless judges; there is still the great pile of Notre Dame, standing much as it stood in her day, although the later Flamboyant work, including the Tour de Beurre, had not then appeared; and there still remains one solitary tower of the castle of Rouen in which Jeanne was confined. The tower was never her prison, but in the ground floor she was intimidated by being shown instruments of torture. The visitor can enter this chamber, which was the scene of that callous brutality to a most innocent maiden, who, encouraged by her implicit belief in the vision of her saints, bore herself throughout with a fortitude and heroism which baffled and enraged her inquisitors.\n\nIt is a pity that the tower has been over-restored, and that the walls are hung with wreaths of artificial flowers. There is also a statue of the maid and many prints hung on the walls, but their interest is not commensurate with the subtraction from the grimness of the tower which they cause.\n\nWhen Jeanne dâArc was finally condemned to{42} be burnt, the stake was set up in the Vieux-MarchÃ©, and the exact spot is now marked by a large stone, bearing the inscription, âJeanne dâArc, 30 Mai, 1431.â The heroic girl was taken to the spot in a car with a confessor and others, and escorted by English soldiers. With the awful piles of faggots ready for kindling, the girlâs agony was dragged out with a sermon, and after her sentence was read there is no wonder that she wept bitterly. To Bishop Cauchon, whose heart must have been of flint, she said, while they set the wood on fire: âIt is you who have brought me to this death.â A Dominican priest who stood near gives the following account of her death:\n\nâAs I was near her at the end, the poor woman besought and humbly begged me to go into the church near by and bring her the cross, to hold it upright on high before her eyes until the moment of death, so that the cross on which God was hanging might be in life continually before her eyes. Being in the flames, she ceased not to call in a loud voice the Holy Name of Jesus, imploring and invoking without ceasing the aid of the Saints in Paradise; again, what is more, in giving up the ghost and bending her head, she uttered the name of Jesus as a sign that she was fervent in the faith of God, just as we read of St. Ignatius and of many other Martyrs.â\n\nAnother witness—MaÃ®tre Jean Massieu, a priest—says:{43}\n\nâWith great devotion she asked to have a cross; and, hearing this, an Englishman who was there present made a little cross of wood with the ends of a stick, which he gave her, and devoutly she received and kissed it.... With her last word in dying, she cried with a loud voice âJesus!ââ\n\nThe Palais de Justice (small gratuity to the concierge) is in the Rue Jeanne dâArc, with the main front facing the Rue aux Juifs. The central portion dates from 1499 to 1515, and was designed by Le Roux, who was also the brilliant architect of the western portal of the cathedral and the tomb of the Cardinals dâAmboise. The interior is rather disappointing. The great hall, formerly used for the Parliament or Ãchiquier of Normandy, is now a criminal court, and its panelled and gilded oak ceiling is flat and ineffective in spite of its pendent bosses. The fine Salle des Pas-Perdus in the west wing has a gallery at each end and the marble table of the tribunal.\n\nThe Rue de la Grosse Horloge contains a picturesque sixteenth-century archway, bearing a great blue and gold clock, and alongside it is the belfry, commenced in 1389. The visitor who cares for vivid impressions of the past should stroll through this street at 9 p.m., and hear the great bell La Rouvel ring the curfew, raising as it does{44} so the same mellowed tones that have vibrated the air since the Middle Ages.\n\nLEAVING ROUEN\n\nThe memory of those sounds is a precious one, and on the next morning, when the car carries one away, it remains among the many things in the mind that are not left behind.\n\nKeeping to the north bank of the Seine, and going to the right at the fork which almost immediately presents itself, one shakes off the cobble-stones in a mile or so, and, after the modern river-side village of Amfreville, the open country is freed from the suburban growth of Rouen. Across the level green fields appear the cotton and cloth mills which are the chief industry of the neighbour{45}hood, and in the distance on the right across the riverâs windings can be seen the manufacturing town of Elbeuf. The freedom from smoke of this and the average French industrial town is most striking to the Englishman.\n\nTwo kilometres beyond the hamlet of St. Crespin one turns sharply to the left, and, climbing an easy gradient among low woods, comes to the village of Igoville, where one turns to the left again; and, a kilometre farther on, goes to the right, crossing the railway and a long modern bridge over the Seine, which brings one to the old town of\n\nPONT DE LâARCHE\n\nIt is picturesquely situated above the river, which is studded with islands in this portion of its course, and the remains of the ramparts are visible on the river-side, with the towerless Church of Notre Dame des Arts rising above old roofs. There are some old timber-fronted houses, and one of them has a thirteenth-century wooden-pillared porch.\n\nCharles the Bald (died 877), a grandson of Charlemagne, had a palace at Pont de lâArche, and the little town was one of the first to open its gates to Henry of Navarre when he became Henri IV. in 1589, after the murder of the Duke of Guise. Being{46} one of the gates of Normandy, it suffered several sieges; the old bridge, however, survived up to 1850.\n\nThe church was chiefly built in the fifteenth century, and, though unfinished, justifies its unique dedication in the wealth of beautiful carving that adorns the exterior. The chapels ranged along the sides of the nave have curious little conical roofs, which, in the absence of any tower, form the main outline of the building. The interior is very light, in spite of the fifteenth and sixteenth century glass that fills several of the windows. One of them in the north aisle is noticeable for the curious little portraits inserted at a later date. Henri IV., it is said, gave the church its organ, and Jean Gougon is associated with the carving of the font. The choir-stalls come from the neighbouring abbey of Bon-port.\n\nAt a fork on leaving the town the road to Louviers goes to the left, and rises straight uphill through the forest of Pont de lâArche. Succeeding this comes a curious stretch of switchback road, with a blue horizon beyond, and soon afterwards one is bumping on the cobble-stones of\n\nLOUVIERS\n\nStanding at a fork in the middle of the town is the Church of Notre Dame, whose outline is marred{47} by an uncompleted tower, but whose profusion of the most elaborate fifteenth-century carving leaves the wondering spectator almost breathless. The writer once, several years ago, commenced a drawing of the south aisle and porch, but it remains to-day as unfinished as the tower just mentioned! All the lacework carving is on the most obvious side of the church, and is an addition of the Flamboyant period. Its extraordinary wealth of detail repays the closest scrutiny, for among canopied niches and flame-patterned parapets are the grotesque heads of gargoyles and representations of such creatures as the monkey and the bat. The north side of the church shows the greatest contrast imaginable to all this delicate beauty. It is plain and bare thirteenth-century work, with the fortified tower built about the year 1366, a few years after the town had been half destroyed by the English, when the citizens set to work to fortify their town, which hitherto had relied for protection solely on the fact that Louviers was a possession of the Archbishop of Rouen. The thirteenth-century interior, with its double aisles, giving wonderful perspectives of pillars, is one of the most remarkable in Normandy. Gisors (see Section XXVII.) also has double aisles, but their loftiness gives an entirely different effect{48} to those at Louviers. The dark brown pulpit has its sounding-board supported by a couple of carved wooden palm-trees. Some picturesque old houses remain in the old part of the town near the church, and although the town is given up to a considerable extent to woolen factories, it is still a pleasant place, surrounded by the beautiful pastoral scenery of the River Eure.\n\nA terrible incident of the Hundred Yearsâ War took place in 1418, when Louviers fell into the hands of the English, in spite of its newly built wall, and 120 of its most wealthy merchants were condemned to death. In 1431, in spite of an heroic defence, the English again entered the town, and burnt and destroyed so heartlessly that it is a wonder that the town ever recovered, and yet in the last years of the same century the amazing mass of ornament was added to the south side of the church.\n\nTHE ROAD TO EVREUX\n\nContinuing through the main street of Louviers in a straight line past the church, the road runs by the side of the River Eure, with wooded hills on the right. A picturesque half-timbered chÃ¢teau, with pepper-box turrets, is passed on the left, and\n\n{49}\n\nold church lying a little way from the road on the same side.\n\nThe Iton, a tributary of the Eure, is then crossed, and with a beautiful view of steep hills dropping down to the strip of water-meadows by the Eure, the road to Evreux climbs up steadily, making a big bend as it passes through a strip of woodland. The road swings to the right to make a zigzag down into the valley of the Iton, where in descending one has beautiful views of the curving, delicately tinted hills, and a distant glimpse of Evreux, which is entered through a fine avenue.{50}\n\nSECTION III\n\nEVREUX TO CHARTRES, 47Â¾ MILES\n\n(77 KILOMETRES)\n\nDISTANCES ALONG THE ROUTE\n\nKil.Miles. Evreux to Thomer138 Thomer to Nonancourt1610 Nonancourt to Dreux148Â¾ Dreux to Chartres3421\n\nNOTES FOR DRIVERS\n\nThis portion of the route goes across the great flat plain of St. AndrÃ© and the two little hills, one on leaving Dreux, and another halfway to Chartres, are not worth mentioning. Squalls of wind and rain sometimes assail one with tremendous force.\n\nPLACES OF INTEREST ON THE ROUTE\n\nEvreux is a cathedral town, with comparatively wide, but very unassuming, streets of old houses, having their original charm generally hidden under a covering of plaster. Cavalrymen, with horsehair falling from their helmets, and the numerous clergy seem to make up a considerable proportion of the population. In walking through the town one frequently comes to little canals, which take the water of the River Iton in several directions, in a similar fashion to the Stour at Canterbury.\n\nThe spacious square in front of the HÃ´tel de Ville is overlooked by public buildings, whose new appearance might give one a wrong impression of the antiquity of the town, if it were not for the beautiful belfry tower, with a pinnacled spire, standing in one corner. It was built in the latter part of the fifteenth century, and the bell, whose notes are frequently heard, was cast in 1406, and is nearly a century older than the tower, which was built in place of an earlier one. The Museum, in the same square, is interesting, on account of the{52} Roman remains it contains, found at the village of Vieil-Evreux, a Roman site about four and a half miles to the west.\n\nFrom the museum a short street, the Rue de lâHorloge, leads to the Cathedral, whose lately restored spire appears above the roofs from nearly every point of view. From the eleventh right down to the nineteenth century rebuilding or{53} alterations have been taking place on the great church, and now, to the architect, as well as those who are interested in the history of France, there are the records in stone of the changes which those eight centuries have witnessed.\n\nThe first Norman cathedral was burnt, in 1119, by Henry I. of England, who rebuilt the nave about twenty-six years later. During the fighting in Normandy in the time of Philippe Auguste the church again suffered, and the triforium of the nave was rebuilt about the middle of the thirteenth century. The present choir followed at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The following summary covers the chief periods of the cathedral:\n\nThe west front is unique in being the only completely classic faÃ§ade among all the cathedrals of France. It almost gives the feeling of the FranÃ§ois I. chÃ¢teaux by the Loire. The interior is a most inspiring example of pure French Gothic. In the chapels are several windows containing beautiful stained glass of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; that in the south transept is sixteenth century.\n\nThe Bishopâs Palace, on the south side of the cathedral, can only be seen from the Boulevard Chambaudouin, where its fortified exterior is washed by one of the canals of the Iton. It is an interesting building of the fifteenth century, and in 1603 was, for a time, the residence of Henri IV., whose famous victory at Ivry, a few miles south of Evreux, is described at the end of this chapter.{55}\n\nAt the end of the Rue JosÃ©phine is the Church of the Benedictine Abbey of St. Taurin. The life-story of that otherwise obscure worthy of the Church is told in the windows of the choir, and one of them shows his successful attack on the devil, who had entered the temple of Diana in Evreux. The sacristan will show the casket containing relics of the saint (small gratuity) to those who ask permission. It is worth while to do so, as this silver-gilt reliquary is one of the most sumptuous examples in existence of goldsmithsâ work of the thirteenth century.\n\nThe choir, the tower, and part of the nave of St. Taurin belong to the fifteenth century, and the other portions are Romanesque work of the eleventh century. Evreux suffered the most terrible buffets in the unsettled period when Normandy was the battle-ground of England and France. Henry I. burnt the town and John sold it to Philippe Auguste, regaining it treacherously after the release of Richard I. Philippe, however, having captured it, massacred a large proportion of the miserable townsfolk.\n\nIt is generally believed that the Devereux family obtained their name from this Norman town.\n\nThe road to Chartres goes southwards from{56} Evreux over the hedgeless plain of St. AndrÃ© in a perfectly straight line. The hamlet of Thomer, with its little church with a spiky spire on the left, is passed through, and here and there another village is seen across the fields; but otherwise, for some eighteen miles the great plain stretches away to a flat horizon, with so few features that one marvels how a peasant can find his way to the particular field he was working in on the previous day. There are no hedges, no roadside cottages, and scarcely a tree to serve as a guide to any particular square of the great patchwork of green and brown!\n\nNONANCOURT\n\nOn reaching this old town one goes over a level-crossing, and, turning to the left, goes through the street, getting a passing glimpse of the market-house standing on wooden posts. Henry I. chose this place to build a castle for the defence of Normandy, and in it an agreement was signed between Richard I. and Philippe Auguste, by which those two kingly warriors promised not to molest one anotherâs dominions while absent on the Crusades. Here also they arranged their respective shares in the Third Crusade.\n\nOn leaving Nonancourt the River Avre is\n\n{57}\n\ncrossed, and about nine miles farther one reaches the interesting town of\n\nDREUX\n\nThe most conspicuous feature is the HÃ´tel de Ville, a large square tower-like building, with slightly projecting circular turrets at each corner. It was built between 1512 and 1537, and is a most interesting example of the transition from Flamboyant Gothic to Classic forms. The tall{58} conical roof is broken with dormers, and ends in a bell-turret. Inside there is a beautiful staircase, a Renaissance fireplace, several fine rooms, a library, and old armour.\n\nBuilt on the steep hill that dominates the town on the north side, where the ruins of the keep and towers of the Castle dismantled in 1593 still stand, is the Chapelle Royale, erected in 1816 by the Duchesse dâOrlÃ©ans. After suffering imprisonment and banishment during the Revolution, she returned to France in 1814, and resided at Ivry, a few miles to the north of Dreux. The tombs of her father and the Princes of her family in the vaults of the old collegiate church at Dreux had been broken open during the Revolution, but certain pious folk having hidden the bones, the Duchess decided to build a chapel in which they could be preserved. It was completed in 1820, and her son Louis Philippe afterwards built a larger structure. Lenotre describes how Louis refused to have any assistance in the work of sorting up the confused heap of the bones of his ancestors. âThese poor dead people,â he said, âhave already been sufficiently tormented. Leave me alone with themâ; and, shut up by himself for a great part of a night, he laid out the bones on cloths,{59} measuring, examining, and sorting them by the light of a lamp.\n\nThe tombs include those of the Duchesse dâOrlÃ©ans, the foundress of the chapel, of Louis Philippe and his queen and their young children, and the Duchesse de Bourbon CondÃ©, mother of the unfortunate Duc dâEnghien.\n\nThe Church of St. Pierre, with its odd-looking unfinished towers, has a somewhat severe interior, relieved by the beauty of its sixteenth-century glass. The nave is fifteenth century and the choir and transepts twelfth or thirteenth. A holy-water basin, or bÃ©nitier, of the twelfth century is of great interest, and so is the chapel on the south side of the nave, containing wall-paintings of the inhabitants of the town who made the pilgrimage of St. James of Compostella (Santiago in Spain) during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n\nThe beautiful ambulatory has graceful pillars without capitals, and the sounding-board of the pulpit rests on palm-tree supports, as at Louviers.\n\nDuring the Huguenot war Dreux and its neighbourhood was involved in heavy fighting. In 1562 the first pitched battle was fought near the town, the Catholic Leaguers being led by Montmorency and FranÃ§ois, Duc de Guise, and the{60} Protestants by Coligny and CondÃ©. Although the Catholics were successful, it was a closely fought battle, in which 4,000 perished, and both Montmorency and CondÃ© were taken prisoners.\n\nWhen Henry of Navarre had become Henri IV., although still only recognized as King by a few of the provinces of France, he laid siege to Dreux in 1590, but retired a few miles northwards to Ivry, in the plain of St. AndrÃ©, on the approach of the Catholic army under Mayenne, numbering about 16,000. âMy friends,â said Henri, as he fastened on his helmet, âyonder is the enemy; here is your King; and God is on our side. If you should lose your standards, rally round my white plume: you will always find it in the path of honour and of victory!â The fight began at ten in the morning, and in two hours the army of Mayenne was in full flight.\n\nTHE ROAD TO CHARTRES\n\nOutside the town the journey across the great agricultural plain is continued. There are still no hedges between the strips of green and brown, sometimes broken by distant belts of woodland, going away to the soft blue horizons in heaving undulations. The first village passed is Marville-Moutier-BrÃ»lÃ©. One can see the high-pitched{61} green roof and small spire of its eleventh-century church on the left.\n\nLe Boullay Mivoye, the next village, which also has a little twelfth to fifteenth century church, consists of a very compact collection of uniformly low thatched or green-tiled cottages and barns, practically surrounded by a wall, beyond which there is no sign of any habitation until the next village is in sight.\n\nSpeeding southwards there appears right ahead on the horizon, at the end of a very straight perspective of road, an enormous building with two spires. There is nothing else in sight beyond a few low trees, and the stranger at once realizes that he is approaching a building of the greatest consequence. It is the vast Gothic cathedral of Chartres.\n\nOn entering the town, by going to the right along the Rue de la Couronne, one reaches the Place des Epars, where the hotels are situated. (See town plan of Chartres on p. 67.){62}\n\nSECTION IV\n\nCHARTRES TO ORLEANS, 45Â¼ MILES\n\n(73 KILOMETRES)\n\nDISTANCES ALONG THE ROUTE\n\nKil.Miles.

In its fabric is the story of Chartres, and apart from the cathedral there is little to tell of the townâs genesis.\n\nThe Cathedral began as a little church built over a grotto where the early missionaries from Rome had discovered a statue of the Virgin. It was venerated under the name Notre Dame-de-Sous-Terre. Quirinus, the Roman Governor of the town, then called Autricum, in the time of the Emperor Claudius put a number of the Early{64} Christians to the sword, and had their bodies thrown into a well called the Puits de Saints Forts. This interesting link with Gallo-Roman Chartres was lost in the seventeenth century, and was only rediscovered in 1901. It can be seen in the crypt behind the altar of the Virgin.\n\nThis Crypt is the largest in France, and, next to St. Peterâs at Rome and Canterbury Cathedral, it is the largest in the world.\n\nâThe crypt,â says Mr. Cecil Headlam (in his âStory of Chartres,â which everyone who goes there should procure and read), âwas not in origin a crypt, or a martyrium, or a meeting-house of prayer dug beneath the level of the soil, but a tiny church set on the crest of the hill and raised above the surface of the earth. It only became a crypt, properly so called, when it had been covered up and the surrounding soil raised by the dÃ©bris and deposits of succeeding years, so that when the new church was built it was erected naturally upon the top of the old.... The crypt consists of two lateral galleries, which run from the western towers under the aisles of the upper church, and form a horseshoe curve beneath the choir and sanctuary 366 feet long and 17 to 18 feet broad; of two transepts, seven apsidal chapels, and the martyrium, which is under the choir of the upper church.â\n\n{65}\n\nSecond Church. Burnt by Normans in the ninth century.\n\nThird or Fourth Church:\n\nThe Interior is memorable for its immensity and for the strange and almost crude crimsons and blues of the twelfth and thirteenth century glass. The three twelfth-century windows are below the rose of the western end of the nave, where they survived the fire of 1194 almost by a miracle. Several of the windows were given by the trades of Chartres, from the armourers to the pastry-cooks.\n\nBy many Chartres is considered the finest cathedral in France, and although there will occur to the mind the glories of the choir of Beauvais and of the nave of Amiens, the interior of Chartres, in its reposeful vastness and strength as a complete structure built in one period, leaves all rivals far behind.\n\nThe Ambulatory Screen is the most sumptuous piece of Renaissance carving in France. It was begun in 1514 by Jean de Beauce, and completed{67}\n\n{68}\n\nin the eighteenth century. The lives of Christ and of the Virgin are illustrated in the series of pictures in stone.\n\nThe Assumption of the Virgin, of Carrara marble, carefully selected by Bridan the sculptor, was finished in 1773. At the Revolution it was saved by an architect, who put a red cap of liberty on the head of the Virgin and a lance in her hand.\n\nThe Vierge-du-Pilier is a figure of wood, painted and gilded, with an almost black face. It stands on a short pillar, and is especially venerated by women, being a link with very early and primitive forms of worship.\n\nThe Chapelle St. Piat was built in 1349 at the east end and separate from the cathedral. A staircase and passage lead to it.\n\nThe Labyrinth of blue-and-white stone in the floor of the nave is a rare and interesting feature, and one of the best in existence. It is not properly known in what way these mazes were used, nor the rites connected with them, although it has been stated that instead of a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, a penitent could perform the 600-feet journey of the maze on his knees.\n\nThe Treasury contains, in a modern reliquary, two pieces of white silk, regarded as part of the{69} tunic or veil of the Virgin, which had been given to Charlemagne by the Empress Irene, and was afterwards presented to Chartres by Charles the Bald.\n\nTHE LESSER CHURCHES OF CHARTRES\n\nSt. Pierre or St. PÃ¨re-en-VallÃ©e. The abbey church of St. PÃ¨re-en-VallÃ©e, founded by Clovis, is a fine building dating from the twelfth to the fourteenth century. It was commenced in 1150, under the direction of the monk Hilduard, and almost entirely rebuilt in the thirteenth century. Of the earlier construction there remains the lower part of the choir, with its heavy pillars, the aisles which surround the choir, and the chapels. The great square tower has been placed as early as 940, but may have been built a century later. The stained glass belongs to the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, the earliest being in the choir excluding the apse. In the south aisle of the nave is the tombstone (1037) of Robert, Archbishop of Rouen, son of Richard I., Duke of Normandy. Unique enamels of the twelve Apostles can be seen in the apsidal chapel.\n\nSt. Aignan is mainly a Renaissance church, with the chief entrance built in the fourteenth century. The windows are the most interesting feature.{70}\n\nSt. Martin-au-Val is the church of the ancient priory of the abbey of Marmontier, and to-day the chapel of the HÃ´pital St. Brice—a curious building of the twelfth century, incorporating some remains of a great basilica previous to the tenth century. The crypt contains some Roman capitals of marble, stone sarcophagi, and the tomb of a Bishop of Chartres.\n\nSt. AndrÃ©, an interesting ruined collegiate church, now a shop, built, about 1108, over two square crypts belonging to Early Christian times. There is a beautiful Romanesque door.\n\nSt. Foi is chiefly a Flamboyant church. It was desecrated with great profanity in the Revolution, and remained secular until it was reconsecrated in 1862.\n\nThe HÃ´tel de Ville is a Renaissance building, formerly the HÃ´tel Montescot (1614). It contains the Museum of pictures, objects of art, ancient armour and tapestry, and also the Library.\n\nThe Bishopâs Palace is a seventeenth-century building.\n\nMaison de LoÃ«ns, built over a thirteenth-century crypt.\n\nMaison du MÃ©decin, at No 8, Rue du Grand Cerf, is a beautiful specimen of Renaissance, with{71} an inscription above the door, showing that it was built by Claude HuvÃ©, who was a doctor (1501-1559).\n\nMaison du Saumon, at No. 10, Place de la Poissonnerie, was built in the fifteenth century, and is the most curious construction of wood in Chartres. A big salmon is carved on one of its beams.\n\nThe House of the Old Consuls, in the Rue des Ãcuyers, is interesting as the cradle of the cityâs municipal power, and in possessing a most picturesque outside staircase turret (sixteenth century), now called the âEscalier de la Reine-Berthe.â\n\nMany other houses belonging to the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods refresh the eye in walking through the streets of Chartres.\n\nThe Porte Guillaume is the only survivor of the seven gates that formerly existed. It is flanked by two cylindrical towers of the fourteenth century, with restored machicolated battlements.\n\nIn going round the tree-shaded boulevards which mark the limits of the medieval city several sections of the ramparts can be seen, as well as a most attractive view of the cathedral over the river.{72}\n\nON LEAVING CHARTRES,\n\non the road to Orleans, almost immediately after passing a direction board, there is a fork, where one goes to the right, with the railway parallel with the road for a few kilometres.\n\nThe huge wheat-growing plain of La Beauce{73}—the granary of France—stretches away to a perfectly level horizon in all directions.\n\nWindmills are passed now and then, and distant villages can be seen, but more memorable than anything else is the great dome of sky, and as the car slips rapidly and smoothly along the white ribbon that cuts the scenery in two, one seems to be in the strangest of solitudes and on the very outermost surface of the globe, where every mood of the heavens is felt to its fullest without any mitigating influences. When it rains every drop falls without hindrance, and smites the face with a sting when driven by the untempered wind, and when the sun shines every ray reaches the soil.\n\nAllonnes is a roadside village roofed with thatch, coated with green velvet moss, and having blind stone gables towards the road.\n\nTwo level-crossings succeed, and then Ymonville, another stone village with great farmyards and a megalithic stone, is passed.\n\nAt Allaines there is a church belonging in part to the eleventh century, and strips of low plantations begin to appear.\n\nIt is noticeable that French advertisers use the corners of houses in the wayside villages for announcing their productions in blue and white, just{74} where one looks for the blue-and-white direction-boards, so that the eye never fails to catch them, and the various makes of cocoa or pneumatic tyres are engraved on the memory!\n\nSoon after passing a grey-green boarded windmill close to the road, which makes a very pretty picture against the emerald of the growing corn beyond, the road goes to the left, and immediately afterwards to the right in the village of Artenay.\n\nSoon afterwards a railway appears on the left, and with thin, rickety telegraph-poles as companions, the rest of the way to Orleans begins to lose interest, until a long, dull street shuts out the views.\n\nORLEANS\n\nLike many cities boasting a history that goes back to a remote period, Orleans has rebuilt itself so often that it is now a modern town, with only a very few buildings to connect it with the past. All the atmosphere of antiquity pervading such cities as Rouen and Chartres has gone to such an extent that it is with a mental effort equal to that of replacing the hippopotamus in the primeval marshes of the Thames, where London now stands, that one remembers that the Gallic town of Cenabum which stood on the site of Orleans was taken by Julius{75}\n\nCÃ¦sar from the Carnutes in 52 B.C. By the third century the town was known as Aurelianus, from{76} which it is an easy step to the present name. In 451 the devastating Huns under Attila were forced back. By 613 Orleans had become one of the most important cities in France, second only to Paris; it was frequently the residence of French kings, and money was minted there.\n\nIn 1344 Philippe de Valois separated Orleans from the crown, and it became a duchy, and in the next century (1429) came that historic siege by the English, raised by the âMaid,â who, clad in white armour, rode fearlessly at the head of the French army, and sent a cold terror into the hearts of the English.\n\nAfter having been occupied by Leaguers and Huguenots in turn, Henri IV. took the city in 1594. The year of Waterloo saw the Prussians in Orleans, and in 1870 they again occupied the city. They were driven out for a time, but after returning they did not evacuate until March, 1871.\n\nThe Cathedral has its eighteenth-century âGothicâ west front facing the wide Rue Jeanne dâArc. It is a most abominable conception of narrow pointed doorways of a Moorish character, with ogee arches and the oddest pair of towers. The thirteenth-century east end, with its great display of flying{77} buttresses, is the chief portion of the earlier cathedral burnt by the Calvinists in 1567.\n\nBuilding Dates\n\n362. Founded by St. Euverte and St. Aignan.\n\n999. Burnt.\n\n1206. Second church (Romanesque) destroyed.\n\n1287. Gothic reconstruction commenced by Bishop Gilles de Patay.\n\n1567. Burnt by Calvinists before Gothic church was quite finished. Saved from the fire: eleven chapels of the apse, side walls of choir, and two Romanesque towers.\n\n1601. Henri IV. placed the first stone of the present building, in fulfilment of an obligation imposed upon him by Pope Clement VIII. before absolution.\n\n18th cent. The bastard Gothic western faÃ§ade erected in the reign of Louis XV. by Gabriel. Romanesque towers demolished and rebuilt.\n\n1829. Reconstruction finished.\n\nThe interior is very impressive, with tall pillars without capitals, the great star windows in the transepts, and the very pictorial modern glass.{78}\n\nOther Churches:\n\nSt. Pierre-le-Puellier is the oldest church in Orleans. It is of unprepossessing appearance, but is interesting on account of the remains of the ninth and twelfth centuries.\n\nSt. Aignan was mutilated by Protestants in 1562. It is built over a crypt of the eleventh century, and consists now of transepts and choir only.\n\nSt. Euverte is a Flamboyant church, first built in the twelfth but rebuilt in the fifteenth century. It has a tower of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\nNotre Dame de Recouvrance is an eleventh-century church, rebuilt in 1515-1519, and restored in 1862.\n\nThe HÃ´tel de Ville is a Renaissance structure of modern aspect, built in 1530 for Jacques Groslot, Seigneur de lâIsle. Many French monarchs have stayed there: FranÃ§ois II., Charles IX., Henri III., and Henri IV.; also Catherine de Medici and Mary Stuart. FranÃ§ois II. died there in 1560. In 1790 it became the HÃ´tel de Ville.\n\nThe Bishopâs Palace dates from 1631.\n\nThe Old Houses are mainly to be found in the Rue du Tabour, a side street of great interest.{79}\n\nThe MusÃ©e Jeanne dâArc occupies a charming fifteenth-century house in the Rue du Tabour, known, without reason, as the Maison dâAgnÃ¨s Sorel.\n\nThe Maison de Jeanne dâArc, in the same street, is the house in which Jacques Bouchier, treasurer to the Duc dâOrlÃ©ans, received Jeanne during the siege of 1429. The room she occupied was unfortunately pulled down and rebuilt in 1580.\n\nThe HÃ´tel Cabut, not far from the Rue du Tabour, wrongly called Maison de Diane de Poitiers, is a Renaissance house, built in 1540, and now contains the MusÃ©e Historique.\n\nThe City Walls. There are still a tower and a few fragments of the city ramparts.\n\nThe FÃªte de Jeanne dâArc is held on May 8, in honour of the raising of the siege of Orleans by Jeanne dâArc. It is one of the most brilliant in France, and has only been interrupted during the religious wars of the sixteenth century and from 1792 to 1804.{80}\n\nSECTION V\n\nAMONG THE CHÃTEAUX OF TOURAINE\n\nORLEANS TO TOURS, 103Â½ MILES\n\n(166 KILOMETRES)\n\nORLEANS TO TOURS, DIRECT, 71Â¾ MILES\n\n(115 KILOMETRES)\n\nDISTANCES ALONG THE ROUTE\n\nKil.Miles.

In wet seasons the flat, sandy shores are often covered by the river, which spreads out into broad lagoons and engulfs the grassy islands.{83}\n\nAt Meung, where the road bends to the right, there is an interesting abbey church, founded in the sixth century by St. Liphard. It was burnt by Louis le Gros in the early part of the eleventh century, but before its close the church had been rebuilt with the exception of the tower. This western tower, with a pyramidal spire, is connected with a curtain wall to a thirteenth-century fortified tower, the oldest part of the castle of the Bishops of Orleans, which was chiefly built in the classic period of some 400 years later. The village has some old houses, and the Porte Amont, rebuilt in the seventeenth century.\n\nBEAUGENCY\n\nThe first glimpse of this compact little town is very suggestive of antiquity. It is overshadowed by a huge Norman keep, about whose lichened parapets jackdaws circle and flutter, and across the river stands the oldest bridge on the Loire—some of its twenty-six arches going back to the thirteenth century.\n\nThe keep is called the Tour de CÃ©sar, and it is all that now remains of the first Castle, built at the end of the eleventh century. The other portions were constructed in 1440 by Dunois, the Bastard of Orleans, who maintained the defence of Orleans{84} against the English until relieved by Jeanne dâArc. There is a most picturesque courtyard with open arcading and a tower, and the great hall, known as the Salle de Jeanne dâArc, has a huge fireplace. The buildings are now a DepÃ´t de MendicitÃ©.\n\nClose to the castle is the Transitional Church of the Benedictine Abbey of Notre Dame, finished at the end of the twelfth century, and lately restored. It was burnt by the Protestants in 1567, when they committed terrible excesses in the town. Besides the church, there is nothing left of the abbey buildings, except an old circular tower called the Tour du Diable and the Abbotâs house.\n\nAdjoining the HÃ´tel St. Ãtienne[A] there is a picturesque wooden house with moulded beams and much carving, and along one side of the hotel courtyard is the disused Church of St. Ãtienne, a very interesting and perfect little cruciform building of the eleventh century or earlier. It has a central tower, and the windows are small and very deeply splayed. Being kept locked, the plain barrel vaulting of the interior can only be dimly seen through the unglazed windows.{85}\n\nThe HÃ´tel de Ville might, at first sight, owing to restoration, be thought a modern building. It has a Renaissance faÃ§ade built between 1520 and 1525, and the bas-reliefs with which it is covered show the arms of Dunois and Longueville, the Salamander of FranÃ§ois I., and the fleur-de-lis. The seventeenth-century tapestries to be seen inside came from the choir of the abbey church.\n\nOther features of the town are the Tour de lâHorloge, used as a prison before the sixteenth century; the Tour St. Firmin of the church destroyed during the Revolution; and the portions of the twelfth-century ramparts with the ruined Porte Travers.\n\nIn 1428 the English captured Beaugency, but Jeanne dâArc recovered it in the following year.\n\nCrossing the bridge, with its massive old buttresses, and turning at once to the right, one keeps near the river through the village of St. Laurent-des-Eaux, with a statue of Jeanne dâArc, and houses with the mossiest of roofs and quaint little dormers. There is a quality in the air of this part of the Loire conducive to the growth of parasitic vegetation, for every roof and wall, and every tree, is enriched with luxuriant moss or splashes of silvery and orange lichen.{86}\n\nThe road continues through the same flat country, with low, scrubby forest to the left, and touches the river again at Nouan-sur-Loire, another old village rich in soft greens and greys. A house on the left is conspicuous for its quaintness, and several of the cottages have heart-shaped holes cut in the shutters of the windows.\n\nJust beyond Nouan the road to the ChÃ¢teau de Chambord goes to the left at a fork, and in a few minutes one passes through a gate in the{87} seven-league stone wall that surrounds the park, and a straight avenue through the low trees leads to the great castle.\n\nCHÃTEAU DE CHAMBORD\n\nThere is no appearance of age in the immense pile of white stone that gleams in the sunshine under its astonishingly overweighted roofs, and by many who have come expecting something altogether different, the bitterest disappointment has been expressed.{88}\n\nBefore the year 1519 there had been only the grim and gloomy feudal castle of Chambourg on the site, and the excellent hunting in the scrub and swamps of the Sologne (the name given to this marshy district) was the only reason for the visits of the Court. But in that year FranÃ§ois I. began the construction of the existing chÃ¢teau in place of the old one; and belonging to that era of magnificence when the Renaissance influence was being felt throughout Europe, he built the largest and most splendid hunting-box the world has ever seen. Although 1,800 workmen were employed year after year to carry out Pierre Nepveuâs designs, when the King died, in 1547, only the central portion and the east wing, which contained his own apartments, were completed. His successor, Henri II., added a wing, but liked Anet better, and Charles IX. and Catherine de Medici preferred Chenonceaux, Blois, and Chaumont.\n\nLouis XIII. and Louis XIV. regarded it as a hunting-box, but the latter came to the amazing conclusion, after his first visit to the place with his Court, that it was too small, and plans were prepared for two additional wings, which, however, were never built, although the foundations of one were laid; on them were built, in the eighteenth{89} century, the barracks still to be seen. They were for the accommodation of the regiment of Uhlan horse, with which the famous Marshal Maurice de Saxe, of Fontenoy fame, amused himself when in retirement at Chambord.\n\nIt is, however, the figure of the magnificent FranÃ§ois I., the King who, at the death of his English neighbour, spoke of Henry VIII. as his old friend, to whom oneâs thoughts turn in walking through the great Renaissance courtyard and the innumerable and vast apartments ornamented on every side with his fiery salamander. In spite of their rich coffered ceilings the apartments are cold and bare, and need the sumptuous furnishings of the sixteenth century and the King himself apparelled in his favourite pink or blue Italian velvet.\n\nIn the middle of the central pile of buildings is a remarkable double staircase, so arranged that those ascending by one spiral cannot be seen by those coming down the other. This no doubt had its uses and advantages in the sixteenth century, when Court intrigue added a zest to life.\n\nThe custodian takes visitors on to the roofs, where the extraordinary detail of the chimneys, balustrades, turrets, and dormers can be seen closely. The uncarved surfaces of stone are{90} generally adorned with slate cut into various patterns and fixed up with nails.\n\nNearly all the hundreds of rooms are vast, bare, and lifeless, and one feels in the echoing spaces that the tide of social progress has left such colossal buildings—the greatest that the final phase of feudalism produced—far away on a half-forgotten beach of history.\n\nThe moat was filled up and the terraces taken away when Stanislas Leczinska, the exiled King of Poland, received the castle from his father-in-law Louis XV., and lived there contentedly for eight years.\n\nMadame Berthier, the widow of Napoleonâs Chief of Staff, cut down all the old trees in the twenty square miles of forest belonging to Chambord, thus robbing its surroundings of the dignity given by great trees, while perhaps giving the park the aspect which it bore in the days of FranÃ§ois I.\n\nThe long straight roads bordered with Austrian pines go straight through the park southwards to the little town of Bracieux on the Beuvron. It has a quaint market-house on posts and a good deal of half-timber work with herring-bone brickwork, but otherwise the place is uninteresting, and need not delay one on the road to Cheverny.{91}\n\nThe Sologne, through which the route goes, is a very peculiar strip of sandy marsh-land dotted over with innumerable lakelets and covered with a network of rivers. It was until recent times considered a hopelessly unprofitable waste, suitable for nothing at all but sport. Drainage and careful cultivation have shown, however, that the vine will produce good harvests, and strawberries and vegetables are also cultivated with such success that the peasant of the Sologne is now prosperous and contented.\n\nThat the sporting qualities of the district have not yet been destroyed is proved by the frequency with which one hears the sound of the horn across the watery levels, and sees the very excited hunting folk clattering through the village streets and along the highways and byways.\n\nTurning to the left in the village of Cour Cheverny, and to the right at a fork just afterwards, one reaches the village of\n\nCHEVERNY\n\nOpposite the curious little church, with its Norman door and wide wooden verandah sheltering a few mendicants, is the entrance to the ChÃ¢teau. It is open to visitors from April 1 to October, and not{92} during the other months of the year, as it is the home of the present owner, the Marquis Henri Hurault de Vibraye, who is a descendant of that Philippe Hurault de Cheverny whose son built the present chÃ¢teau in 1634. This Philippe Hurault had been Chancellor under Henri III. and Henri IV., and died in 1599 in the house destroyed when the existing one was built.\n\nThe corridor and dining-room are decorated with paintings on Cordova leather illustrating the life of Don Quixote. Jean Mosnier, of Blois, born in 1600, was the artist who painted all the pictures in the chÃ¢teau. A beautifully carved stone staircase leads to the upper floor, where one can see the Salle des Gardes—a splendid room in perfect condition—decorated with armour, paintings, and rich tapestries, and the Chambre du Roi, with its old bed and more tapestry.\n\nThe tomb of Chancellor Hurault is in the chapel in the chÃ¢teau, and others of the family are buried in the church (already mentioned) outside the gates of the park.\n\nReturning to Cour Cheverny, where the church has a tall and slender spire, and an early Pointed doorway with a toothed moulding, one goes straight on through the village and the forest of Russy{93} (passing on the left the ChÃ¢teau Beauregard) to the picturesque and historic town of\n\nBLOIS\n\nOn crossing the bridge over the Loire one looks upward at the great castle on its inaccessible rock, the centre of a vast feudal power in the Middle Ages, and the scene of callous intrigue and murder in the latter part of the sixteenth century.\n\nIt is not difficult to find the way up to the ChÃ¢teau, which is a national monument, and is open to the public at all reasonable hours.\n\nThe east wing and entrance-front of the chÃ¢teau, of red brick and stone, was built by Louis XII., probably while he was Duke of Orleans, and finished before his death in 1501. His emblem—the porcupine—can be seen above the little door on the right of the archway, above which is an equestrian statue of Louis XII.—a modern work, taking the place of the old one destroyed in the Revolution. This wing now contains the Museum and Picture Gallery.\n\nThe north wing was built by FranÃ§ois I. between 1516-1525. FranÃ§ois I., while transforming the exterior, kept one of the towers of the old fortress,{94}\n\nwhose dungeons served as prisons; the west wing, later demolished by Gaston dâOrlÃ©ans; and also the Grande Salle de Justice, known later as the Salle des Ãtats, from the Ãtats gÃ©nÃ©raux held there in 1576 and 1588. This hall united the new wing to the old one of Louis XII. It is a thirteenth-century building, with its roof supported by eight{95}\n\n{96}\n\ncolumns. The beautiful outside stone staircase is the most remarkable feature of this wing.\n\nOn the first floor are the rooms of Catherine de Medici, containing the bedroom where she died in 1589 and the Tour des Oubliettes—the ruined tower where the Cardinal de Guise (brother of Henri, Duc de Guise) and the Archbishop of Lyons were imprisoned. The Cardinal was assassinated the day after his brother just in the entry. The Archbishop was sent into exile.\n\nOn the second floor are the rooms of Henri III., including the Kingâs bedroom, where the Duke died; the oratory, where monks were praying for the success of the enterprise, not knowing what it was; and the Salle du Conseil, where Guise stood and warmed himself by the fire on the morning when he was assassinated—December 23, 1588. The Cabinet Vieux, where Henri waited during the murder, has been pulled down.\n\nHenri III., owing to his vacillating policy, found himself in 1588 completely dominated by his powerful subject, Henri, Duc de Guise, who had founded the league to re-establish the Catholic religion and to extirpate all heresy. The King had been forced to proclaim Guise Lieutenant-General of the kingdom, and to pledge himself to suppress heresy,{97} but, though outwardly reconciled, Henri was determined on vengeance. Miss Edith Sichel gives the following account of the murder in her brilliant work on Catherine de Medici.\n\nThe west wing, dating from 1635, was built for Gaston dâOrlÃ©ans by FranÃ§ois Mansard. It contains the public library.\n\nThe south wing contains some rooms built by Louis XII. or his father, Charles dâOrlÃ©ans, and also the ornate Chapelle Saint Calais, in which Henri IV. married Marguerite de Valois. It has been restored so much that it has lost somewhat in interest, in spite of its profuse gilding on walls and ceiling.\n\nTHE CHURCHES OF BLOIS\n\nCathedral of St. Louis, sixteenth century, rebuilt in seventeenth century in the time of Louis XIV. in a debased ogee style. The upper parts of the tower and main entrance are Renaissance, while the base of the tower belongs to the twelfth century, when an earlier church was standing.\n\nSt. Nicholas, a cruciform church situated at the foot of the chÃ¢teau, is the oldest in Blois, and is quite the most interesting. It formerly belonged to the Benedictine Abbey of St. Laumur, and was built between 1138 and 1210 in Transitional and{101} Gothic periods. The upper parts of the two western towers are modern. The interior is very impressive, the style being strong and simple, with a beautiful vaulted ambulatory. Some of the capitals are very finely carved. The altar-screen dates from 1460, and there are epitaphs and inscriptions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\nSt. Vincent-de-Paul, a church of the Jesuits, built 1626-1671, contains a monument to Gaston dâOrlÃ©ans (to the right of the chief altar) erected by Mademoiselle de Montpensier, his daughter (known as La Grande Mademoiselle).\n\nSt. Saturnin, in the Faubourg de Vienne, south of the river, belongs to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It has a statue of Notre-Dame des Aides, the object of a pilgrimage for which Anne de Bretagne (wife of Louis XII.) had a great devotion.\n\nOld Houses.—There are many Renaissance houses of stone, and also numerous wooden ones of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, with curious carvings on brackets and corbels and moulded beams. Nos. 1 and 2, in the narrow old Rue St. Lubin, west of the market below the chÃ¢teau, are particularly good.\n\nTour dâArgent (Rue des Trois Clefs) is the fifteenth-century octagonal tower of the HÃ´tel des{102} Monnaies, or Mint, under Charles dâOrlÃ©ans and Louis XII.\n\nHÃ´tel dâAlluye (8, Rue St. HonorÃ©) is a masterly example of Renaissance, built for Florimond Robertet, Baron dâAlluye, and Secretary of Finances under Louis XII. and FranÃ§ois I. He also built the ChÃ¢teau de Bury.\n\nHÃ´tel Sardini (17, Rue du Puits-ChÃ¢tel) is of the time of Louis XII.\n\nHÃ´tel Denis-Dupont (Rue St. HonorÃ©) is the sixteenth-century dwelling of Denis-Dupont, the celebrated lawyer of Blois.\n\nThe College (Place Louis XII.) is installed in the ancient Abbaye de Bourg-Moyen, rebuilt in the eighteenth century, with the exception of the fourteenth-century gable.\n\nHÃ´tel Dieu (between the castle and the river) occupies buildings of the Abbey of St. Laumur; rebuilt under Louis XIV., and recently enlarged.\n\nFontaine Louis XII., in the Place Louis XII., where markets are held, is a picturesque fifteenth-century work.\n\nThe Bridge was built between 1717-1724, from plans of Gabriel, father of the celebrated architect, the obelisk in the middle showing the arms of France.{103}\n\nHistory.—The name Blois is derived from the Celtic word bleiz, meaning wolf, possibly because the Celtic fort on the site of the chÃ¢teau was in a wolf-infested country, and perhaps the name may have some totem significance. The Counts of Blois ruled over a vast district during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, including Chartres, Dunois, VendÃ´mois, and even Champagne. Thibaut le Tricheur (or the Cheat) was the most celebrated of the first Counts. He built a keep on the site of the present chÃ¢teau before his death in 978.\n\nAfter these tragic events the Kings of France disliked the chÃ¢teau, and only one Duc dâOrlÃ©ans, Gaston, brother of Louis XIII., resided there. He formed a sort of provincial court round him, and employed Mansard to build the west wing. After Gastonâs death in 1660 only two Princesses used it—Marie Casimire, widow of Sobieski, King of Poland, and the mother of Stanislas, King of Poland, who died at Blois in 1722. After this the chÃ¢teau was abandoned, and even partly mutilated, and the Revolution continued the destruction.\n\n1841. The chÃ¢teau was classed as an historical monument, and its restoration has been carried out since that year.\n\nTHE ROAD TO AMBOISE\n\nThere is a peculiar charm in the riparian scenery of the Loire when seen from the raised road that follows the broad river closely all the way to Tours. In the late afternoon the soft colours of the sunset sky reflected in the oily and swirling surface of the river are singularly beautiful, and looking backwards, as one leaves the town of Blois, the buildings beneath the chÃ¢teau, the towers, and the bridge, are all transformed with a soft gold, which subdues all that is crude, and heightens every charm, in just the fashion that memory gilds the past. To the south, beyond the river, is the forest of Blois, a remnant of the medieval forests that surrounded the town, and near at hand all the trees are tufted with mistletoe, which shows up against the burnished gold of the sky as the sun drops lower and lower in the west.\n\nA suspension bridge of six spans crosses the river opposite.\n\nCHAUMONT-SUR-LOIRE\n\nThe little brown-roofed village nestles by the water-side under an orange-red cliff crowned with the picturesque castle built in 1473 by Charles de Chaumont. He was a brother of the great Cardinal{106} Georges dâAmboise, Archbishop of Rouen, who was born in the castle in 1460, and whose Cardinalâs hat can be seen in the chapel.\n\nVisitors are allowed to see the castle every day in the absence of the owner (the Princesse de Broglie), and on Thursdays when the family is in residence. When first built, in the tenth century, the fortress belonged to the Counts of Blois, and came afterwards to the family of Amboise. It was burnt by Louis XI. because Pierre dâAmboise (his tomb in Rouen Cathedral has been mentioned) had rebelled against him, and rebuilt in quadrangular form by his son Charles. The side towards the river was pulled down in 1739 to open up the beautiful view.\n\nCatherine de Medici appears not to have lived at Chaumont, but she obliged Diane de Poitiers to accept it in exchange for Chenonceaux.\n\nThe entrance gateway between machicolated towers shows the initials of Louis XII. and Anne de Bretagne, and the arms of Charles and Georges dâAmboise. Certain apartments are called those of Catherine de Medici and of her astrologer Ruggieri. The Salles des Gardes are hung with Beauvais tapestry. A big cedar holds out beneficent arms in the courtyard, and the steep ravine on the west side of the castle eminence is clothed with trees.{107}\n\nReturning to the north side of the river, one passes the mossy-roofed hamlet of Veuves, built close up to the-raised road, and in a short time the strikingly picturesque town of Amboise appears on the south bank of the river.\n\nAMBOISE.\n\nThe first bridg"
