        "text": "This note uses the United states Census Bureau database of the 1,000 most frequent surnames from the Us census of 2000. It discusses briefly the meaning and origin of the notion of surname. It provides a table of the 25 most frequent surnames in the Us from the 2000 census data, including number of people with the surname, and its meaning. This article provides the reader with three useful onomastic research tools for surnames: (1) The Us Census Bureau's list of the 1,000 most frequently occurring surnames for 2000; (2) Patrick Hanks' Dictionary of American Surnames; and (3) the National Geographic interactive surname list.\n\nThe 2010 Census Surname Table is the third in the U.S. Census Bureau’s series of data products listing the most common surnames (last names) reported in the decennial U.S. census. The Census 2000 product was based on very different methods from the 1990 Census product, while the 2010 product is based on the methodology and programming used in 2000 with some revisions. This document first summarizes the methodological changes between 2000 and 2010, then describes the 2010 results and compares them with the 2000 surname list. This report documents both the overall frequency of surnames (last names), as well as some of the basic demographic characteristics that are associated with surnames. The presentation of data in this report focuses on summarized aggregates of counts and characteristics associated with surnames, and the data do not in any way identify any specific individuals.\n\nInformation presented on this website is considered public information (unless otherwise noted) and may be distributed or copied.

The study members are men with the same or different surnames who are related on the paternal line. The different surnames mostly originate in England in the North Mercia district – Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. The common ancestor of most of the men lived in the period just before surnames formed, in the Warm Mediaeval Period of the 12th and 13th centuries when the English population was increasing rapidly, but common people had as yet no hereditary surnames. The paternal-line descendants of this progenitor took many different surnames - including HYDE, BLOOD, COKER, HIGHFIELD, CHEATHAM, ASHMORE and JACKSON. It is an extended surname study because they would all have had the same surname if born a few centuries later. There is an earlier branch of the family, dating back to Roman times, which has become common in Greater Poland.\n\nI was ten when my mother changed our name from Greenberg to Greene. I had no idea why she did this, nor, presumably, did she. It had to do with the breakup of her marriage, that was clear-she no longer wanted his name. But why, I asked later, when I was old enough to wonder about such things, didn\\u27t she go back to her maiden name"
