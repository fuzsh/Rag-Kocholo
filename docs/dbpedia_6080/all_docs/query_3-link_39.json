        "text": "Firm\n\nAvenue Capital Group is a global investment firm that was founded in 1995 by its Senior Principals, Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner. The firm is primarily focused on specialty lending, opportunistic credit and other special situations investments in the United States, Europe and Asia. The Senior Principals and the Senior Portfolio Managers have spent virtually their entire careers investing in the private and public debt markets.\n\nHeadquartered in New York, with three offices across Europe, four offices throughout Asia, an office in Silicon Valley and an office in Abu Dhabi, the firm manages assets estimated to be approximately $12.2 billion. Avenue draws on the skills and experience of over 185 employees worldwide and maintains a well-developed infrastructure with experienced accounting, tax, compliance, risk management, legal, investors relations and information technology professionals.\n\nAvenue’s team of over 70 investment professionals has deployed approximately $100 billion in investments across a variety of industries, regions and market cycles with an eye toward value creation and capital conservation. Through rigorous due diligence and a robust network of relationships, the Firm proactively identifies public and private opportunities in fragmented, capital-constrained markets where excess premium can be extracted.\n\nHistory\n\nAvenue Capital Group was founded in 1995 by Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner. Pioneers in the distressed debt market, Mr. Lasry and Ms. Gardner have successfully invested in the public and private debt and equity securities of companies across a variety of industries for nearly three decades.\n\nPrior to founding Avenue, Mr. Lasry and Ms. Gardner founded Amroc Investments, LLC. Amroc began in 1989 as a $100 million distressed debt investment partnership organized by Mr. Lasry and Ms. Gardner in association with the Robert M. Bass Group, Inc.\n\nAlthough Avenue’s investment focus has evolved from distressed debt towards the increasingly attractive private credit markets, Avenue’s disciplined investment approach has remained consistent over time.\n\nInvestment Approach\n\nAvenue Capital Group believes it has the unique ability to look at an outwardly difficult situation and see value for the future. The firm seeks to perform rigorous analysis of both the industry and the individual company before making an investment. Industries in transition, whether through secular or cyclical forces, often represent opportunities. The firm follows well-developed investment themes and continually reevaluates its macro views and strategies.\n\nAvenue Capital Group recognizes the importance of ESG issues and is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\nPlease see our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Principles for additional information.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Principles"
