        "meta_description": "Soul Clap by Bella Brown &amp; The Jealous Lovers, released 02 February 2024\n\n1. Soul Clap [FULL ALBUM VERSION]\n2. Lady Time\n3. What Will You Leave Behind\n4. Coming For You\n5. Bang Bang Bang\n6. Living Proof\n7. I Found You\n8. Fast As Lightning\n9. There Is Love\n\nBella Brown &amp; the Jealous Lovers Unveil &quot;Soul Clap&quot; LP:\r\n\r\nA Fusion of Retro Soul/Funk and Modern Grooves Los Angeles-based retro soul/funk sensation Bella Brown &amp; the Jealous Lovers are set to ignite the music scene with their highly anticipated LP, &quot;Soul Clap.&quot; Born from the creative genius of Grammy Award-winning vocalist/songwriter Carol Hatchett, Bella Brown emerges as a diva with a fiery stage presence, drawing inspiration from the likes of Tina Turner and Sharon Jones, and channeling the empowered female leads of 70s Blaxploitation films. Led by producer/bassist/songwriter Daniel Pearson, The Jealous Lovers assemble an impressive ensemble of A-list musicians, boasting pedigrees that include names like Mick Jagger, Elton John, Whitney Houston, Prince, and Stevie Wonder. This musical collective is on a relentless quest to redefine the boundaries of music, infusing soul and funk with elements of jazz, rock, and Afro-Caribbean influences.\r\n\r\nThe essence of &quot;Soul Clap&quot; is derived from the cultural phenomena it is named after—a shared and improvised rhythm-making by a collective. The LP, spanning 40 minutes of pure musical bliss, invites the audience to immerse themselves in the groove and discover their individual truths in the music.\r\n\r\nThe title track, &quot;Soul Clap,&quot; and the infectious &quot;Living Proof&quot; serve as funky dance bangers, echoing the spirit of Bohannan and The Tramps. These tracks, punctuated with jazzy improvisations and soulful horn arrangements, are simple yet joyful expressions of shared humanity and self-love.\r\n\r\n&quot;Coming For You&quot; is Bella&#39;s audacious response to the soul/funk classic Apache, boldly announcing her and The Jealous Lovers&#39; arrival on the modern soul landscape. &quot;I Found You&quot; takes a northern soul love song approach, reminiscent of Gloria Jones with a touch of modern influence, giving it a distinct Amy Winehouse feel.\r\n\r\nBella Brown seamlessly weaves social commentary into her art. &quot;Bang Bang Bang,&quot; an uptempo, funky Motown groove, cleverly uses Curtis Mayfield&#39;s sense of sarcasm to reflect on American gun culture. &quot;Lady Time&quot; takes a driving afrobeat groove, employing brassy horns and reggae-like echoes to address the issue of homelessness.\r\n\r\nHowever, the album is not without its lighthearted moments. &quot;Fast As Lightning&quot; celebrates a cleaner future by imagining Jimi Hendrix joining Ike and Tina Turner’s band to create a classic Chuck Berry car song. &quot;There Is Love&quot; blends horns, strings, and vocals reminiscent of The Stylistics over a Chi-Lites style rhythm section, to create a lush message of support to those among us with mental health issues.\r\n\r\nFinally, &quot;What Will You Leave Behind,&quot; is a revamped version of the group&#39;s sold-out vinyl 45 release. This track serves as a powerful call to action for a better future, delivered over a straight-up Motown groove with a funky Sly Stone finish.\r\n\r\nBella Brown &amp; the Jealous Lovers have crafted an album that transcends genres, embracing the roots of soul and funk while pushing musical boundaries.\r\n\r\n&quot;Soul Clap&quot; is a celebration of individual truths, shared experiences, and the timeless power of music.\r\nSoul Clap is set for release on Feb. 2nd 2024 on LRK Records(UK) and will be available on all major streaming platforms.",
