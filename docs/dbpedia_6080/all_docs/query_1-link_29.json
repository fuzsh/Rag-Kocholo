        "text": "The Governor’s Energy Office (GEO) conducts a weekly survey of heating fuel prices, obtained from fuel retailers statewide. This survey provides the current Maine cash prices, in dollars, rounded to the nearest penny. Prices are typically updated by Friday every other week.\n\nMaine Retail Heating Fuel Prices as of August 12, 2024\n\nHeating Fuel Statewide Southwest/\n\nWest- Central Southeast/\n\nGreater Portland Central East/ Downeast Northern Heating Oil - Average $3.46 $3.46 $3.53 $3.37 $3.42 $3.54 Heating Oil - High $5.09 $4.90 $5.09 $4.90 $4.90 $3.80 Heating Oil - Low $2.89 $2.89 $2.89 $2.99 $2.95 $3.20\n\nKerosene\n\n$4.41 $4.31 $4.68 $4.35 $4.32 $4.42\n\nPropane\n\n$3.05 $3.24 $3.56 $2.88 $2.94 $2.62\n\n*Please Note: The price for the various heating fuels are statewide averages, and prices in a given geographic region of the state may be considerably higher or lower than this average. These statewide averages are spot cash prices, and not ‘pre-buy’, introductory, or otherwise discounted prices. Average propane prices are 30-day cash/credit prices, based on consumption of at least 900 gallons a year. Households using propane just for cooking or hot water generally pay a higher per gallon price.\n\nThe Governor’s Energy Office has developed a guide to assist consumers in obtaining the best propane price for their household and location. The guide can be accessed here - Propane 101 Consumer Guide (PDF).\n\nHeating Fuel Prices per Million Btu\n\nBelow is a table that compares various heating fuels, on a dollar per million Btu (heating unit). Consumers will then need to consider the efficiency of their heating system(s) to estimate their overall heating costs.\n\nPrices per Million Btu as of July 29, 2024\n\nHeating Type Unit Fuel Price Per Unit Fuel Price\n\n($ per million Btu) Firewood Cord $350 $15.91 Wood Pellets Ton $380 $23.03 Natural Gas Therm $1.11 to $2.208 $11.10 - $22.08 Electricity - Air Source Heat Pump kWh $0.082 to $0.099 $24.03-$28.99 Electricity - Baseboard kWh $0.24 to $0.29 $70.34-$84.99 Heating Oil Gallon $3.46 $24.95 Kerosene Gallon $4.41 $32.67 Propane Gallon $3.05 $33.39\n\nNotes"
