You’re able to view your rental options and explore rental alternatives that fit your style and work within your budget. By clicking on the items that interest you, you can create a Wish List and view item-by-item pricing.\n\nWhat you can’t do at PremiereEventsOnline.com is place a rental order. Any day, any time, you can view our rental products and services on this site, but placing an order and working directly with us takes a phone call, an email, a virtual interaction, or a visit to a Premiere Events showroom.\n\nOur phones are answered and our online chat feature is live during store hours: Monday-Friday 9:00 am to 5:00 pm and Saturday, by appointment only, from 9:00 am to noon.. We’ll generally respond to emailed “Contact Us” forms on the same or the very next business day. In peak demand seasons, you’ll receive a delay notice when needed. Members of the Premiere Events team are happy to prepare a quote for your rental selections. If you’d like to schedule a showroom appointment, we’ll gladly set aside a time to chat with you. Making special advance arrangements to visit during showroom hours ensures you’ll have our undivided attention. You’re welcome to browse with no preset appointment time, but please be prepared to wait patiently while we conduct business with our scheduled guests. We’ll get to you as soon as we can!\n\nThe Rental process begins with a quote (when you’re not quite sure what you’ll be needing or aren’t ready to make a commitment) or an order (when you’re ready to reserve your rental selections to ensure their availability for your use). Reservations require a 50% deposit, but you will be able to make changes to your order, including cancellation without penalty, subject to the terms and conditions of our easy-to-read, simple to understand Rental Reservation Agreement.\n\nAt Premiere, we’re here to help. When you’re in a hurry, know exactly what you want, and are familiar with the rental process . . . no problem. Our friendly team members will be quick and efficient.

You’ll be glad you did.\n\nPremiere is one of the largest, most experienced, and best equipped event rental companies in our markets. Our service is second to none! Over the years, Premiere Events has evolved into a recognized and award-winning event rental products and services provider. Premiere’s original 12,000 square foot South Austin location has morphed into more than 100,000 square feet of showroom and warehouse space throughout our service area. Premiere’s planned 40,000 square foot South Austin expansion plan is slated to commence before our 25th birthday in 2025. We enjoy the distinction of being the only Austin rental provider with two Austin showrooms. Our clients and customers can choose between Bryan/College Station (South CS), North Austin (Domain area), and South Austin (Menchaca) – a big plus when considering Austin’s infamous traffic woes.\n\nIn 2016, Premiere acquired Party Time Rentals, headquartered in the Bryan-College Station community. An integral part of Brazos Valley’s event scene for 5 decades, in July of 2022, Party Time was rebranded and took on the Premiere Events name. Premiere’s Bryan-College station operation honors the Party Time legacy while incorporating Premiere Events signature service and impressive inventory collection.\n\nOur newest venture, Premiere Events Woodlands-Montgomery County (W-MC), is building relationships with The Woodlands, Conroe, Willis, Huntsville, Magnolia, and Montgomery, as well as with Sam Houston State’s Huntsville campus. We’ll soon have a showroom in W-MC too!! We look forward to the next growth opportunity, be that a new product line to carry, a new service to offer, or a new area to serve in this great state.\n\nFrom a family business with 3 front of house and 8 back of house employees. Premiere’s workforce is now over 100 team members strong. While many similarly sized and situated event rental providers have become part of the institutional investor scene, Premiere is proud to remain family owned and family operated. Whether or not we’re related by blood or by marriage, we’re all family here at Premiere – all building a legacy for Premiere’s bright future.\n\nPremiere Events can provide the rental items you need to celebrate any event or occasion.
