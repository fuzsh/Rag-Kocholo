Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.\n\nWe do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our clients or former clients to third parties other than as described below.\n\nPersonal information we collect.\n\nWe collect personal information about you in connection with our providing advisory services to you.

For example, when you give us your contact information, enter into an investment advisory contract with us, buy securities (i.e., interests in a fund) from us, tell us where to send money, or make a wire transfer. We also may collect your personal information from other sources, such as our affiliates1 or other non-affiliated companies.\n\nHow we use this information.\n\nAll financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday business and we use the personal information we collect from you for our everyday business purposes. These purposes may include, for example:\n\nTo provide advisory services to you.\n\nTo open an account for you.\n\nTo process a transaction for your account.\n\nTo market products and services to you.\n\nTo respond to court orders, regulatory inquiries and legal investigations.\n\nDisclosure to others.\n\nWe may provide your personal information to our affiliates and to firms that assist us in servicing your account and have a need for such information, such as a broker or fund administrator. We may also disclose such information to service providers and financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing arrangements (i.e., a formal agreement between nonaffiliated financial companies that together market financial products or services to you, such as placement agents). We require third-party service providers and financial institutions with which we have joint marketing arrangements to protect the confidentiality of your information and to use the information only for the purposes for which we disclose the information to them. These sharing practices are consistent with Federal privacy and related laws, and in general, you may not limit our use of your personal information for these purposes under such laws. We note that the Federal privacy laws only give you the right to limit the certain types of information sharing that we do not engage in (e.g., sharing with our affiliates certain information relating to your transaction history or creditworthiness for their use in marketing to you, or sharing any personal information with nonaffiliates for them to market to you).\n\nHow we protect your personal information.\n\nTo protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with Federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.\n\nGDPR AND DPA PRIVACY NOTICE\n\n(APPLICABLE TO EU DATA SUBJECTS, UK DATA SUBJECTS AND CAYMAN ISLANDS DATA SUBJECTS AND / OR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BY BRIGADE IN THE UK)\n\nThis GDPR and DPA Privacy Notice explains how Brigade, collects, uses, shares and otherwise processes your Personal Data (defined below) in connection with your relationship with us as a Brigade client, an investor (or prospective investor) in a Brigade fund/account, acting for an investor (or prospective investor) in a Brigade fund/account, a person being generally interested in Brigade and our services in accordance with:\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing directive 95/46/EC and any regulations or orders promulgated pursuant thereto, with respect to EU data subjects (the “EU GDPR”) and the EU GDPR as it forms part of the law of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “UK GDPR”), (“together referred to as the “GDPR”); and\n\nthe Cayman Islands Data Protection Act (2021 Revision), as amended from time to time and any regulations or orders promulgated pursuant thereto (the \"DPA\"), with respect to Cayman Islands data subjects,\n\n(together, the \"Data Protection Laws\").\n\nThis GDPR and DPA Privacy Notice is issued on behalf of all Brigade controlled or affiliated entities and any accounts managed by such entities, provided that to the extent a Brigade entity is a data controller in respect of your Personal Data, other Brigade entities may not be a data controller or data processor or may not have access to your Personal Data.\n\nThe term “Personal Data” shall bear the meaning given to it in the GDPR (with respect to EU data subjects) and the DPA (with respect to Cayman Islands data subjects), and, as used in this GDPR and DPA Privacy Notice, includes any information relating to you such as your name, contact details, bank account details etc. Personal Data does not include data from which you cannot be identified such as anonymized aggregate data.\n\nPersonal Data.\n\nWe may collect the following Personal Data about you:\n\nInformation that you provide to us such as your contact details (e.g. name, address, email address and telephone number) and information such as your job title.

If we need to process Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.\n\nSharing and transfer Personal Data out of the EEA, the UK and the Cayman Islands.\n\nWhen using your Personal Data for the purposes and on the legal basis described above, we may share your Personal Data with other Brigade entities, as well as to professional advisers and service providers we work with such as fund service providers (which includes any replacement / successor-in-title fund service provider) acting on a fund's behalf including, but not limited to, the administrator, transfer agent, registrar, depositary and paying agent, investment advisor, distributor and auditor (where applicable) (\"Processors\").

It may also be processed by personnel operating outside of the EEA or the UK or the Cayman Islands (as applicable).

The retention period will be determined by various criteria including: (i) the purpose for which we are using it – we will need to keep the data for as long as is necessary for that purpose; and (ii) our legal obligations – laws or regulation may set a minimum period for which we have to keep your Personal Data.\n\nYour rights.\n\nYou have a number of legal rights in relation to the Personal Data that we hold about you, which you can exercise in certain circumstances. These rights are to:\n\nrequest access to your Personal Data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”) and request certain information in relation to its processing;\n\nrequest rectification of your Personal Data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;\n\nrequest the erasure of your Personal Data under certain circumstances, as further described in the Data Protection Laws;\n\nrequest the restriction of processing of your Personal Data under certain circumstances, as further described in the Data Protection Laws;\n\nobject to the processing of your Personal Data where it is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (unless for example we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests) or for direct marketing purposes/profiling; and\n\nask for Personal Data portability under certain circumstances, as further described in the Data Protection Laws.\n\nCayman Islands data subjects have a number of additional legal rights in relation to the Personal Data that we hold about you, which you can exercise in certain circumstances. These rights are to:\n\nbe informed as to how we collect and use your Personal Data;\n\nrequire us to stop direct marketing; and\n\nbe notified of a data breach (unless the breach is unlikely to be prejudicial).\n\nWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
