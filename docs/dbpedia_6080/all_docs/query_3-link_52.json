        "text": "Records Management Challenges Facing Government Leaders\n\nPreserving, digitizing, and providing transparent access to public records is an essential responsibility for elected and appointed government leaders. But taking on the role of guardian and champion of records is increasingly difficult.\n\nToday’s world is undeniably digital. And many guardians struggle to keep up with legal mandates and constituent expectations for 24/7/365 secure records access. There are challenges across multiple fronts: aging documents, increasing natural disasters and destructive events, limited storage, outdated technology, and siloed records solutions.\n\nGovernment officials need a comprehensive plan to safeguard their records, ensure business continuity, and provide public access to meet their legal and moral obligations.\n\nCritical Records Management Solutions\n\nKofile empowers government leaders to confidently navigate the complexities of records management with a proven, comprehensive approach and tailored solutions that address every craft and stage of the document lifecycle. We treat every record like our own and equip leaders to be guardians and champions of history, fulfill their oath of office, and modernize government services for constituents.\n\n“Kofile’s product is outstanding. We’ve taken Kofile’s images and compared them to some of the digitization projects done previously, and they are remarkably improved. I have some staff members who’ve been here for 15-20 years, and they’ve been through the digitization process numerous times, and they comment that Kofile’s images are a significant improvement over what we’ve had in the past.”"
