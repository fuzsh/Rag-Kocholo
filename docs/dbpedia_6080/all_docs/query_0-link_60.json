        "text": "First re-release of the fifth full-length album by the legendary German Thrash/Speed Metal band.\n\nPure Gritty Violent German Thrash! Recorded at a time when Thrash was beginning to disappear, the release of \"Stone Cold Sober\" offered the genre something to look forward to. Filled with fast deafening riffs and the classic Thrash Metal vocals, Tankard does so well, it's an improvement from \"Zombie Attack\" and \"Chemical Invasion\", not too discredit these two great albums. The controversial fifth release from Germany’s hardest drinkers in Tankard, “Stone Cold Sober,” is perhaps the bands’ most overall Thrash-intensive effort and really shows the band has plenty to offer when they put the drinks down and really get down to business!\n\nThis is a prime example of true German Thrash Metal! A musthave for any Thrash fan!! F**k The Law!!!\n\nLimited Gatefold 180g Black Vinyl + A2 Poster. Remastered re-edition features five live bonus tracks taken from the \"Open All Night\" VHS recording.\n\nNoise Records/Nuclear Blast Records, 1992/2013 (NB 3128-1). Made in Germany. First re-release.\n\nTracklist:\n\nLP 1\n\nSide A:\n\n1. Jurisdiction\n\n2. Broken Image\n\n3. Mindwild\n\n4. Ugly Beauty\n\nSide B:\n\n5. Centerfold\n\n6. Behind The Back\n\n7. Stone Cold Sober\n\n8. Blood, Guts & Rock 'n' Roll\n\nLP 2\n\nSide C:\n\n1. Lost And Found (Tantrum Part 2)\n\n2. Sleeping With The Past\n\n3. Freibier\n\n4. Of Strange People Talking Under Arabian Skies\n\n5. Outro\n\nSide D (Live Bonus Tracks):\n\n6. Don’T Panic\n\n7. 666 Packs\n\n8. Shit Faced\n\n9. Alcohol\n\n10. The Morning After\n\nFirst re-release of the sixth full-length album by the legendary German Thrash Metal band.\n\nTankard created a record that was really \"Two-Faced\". After \"Stone Cold Sober\" Tankard concentrated on their strengths. That meant that they had to move away a bit from the Thrash formula and focus on the other styles, which had always been a part of their sound anyway, or to put it simply. This band had to find the right balance again, and they finally did. This album includes a few of the best songs that Tankard has recorded in years! While \"Two-Faced\" initially seems to possess many of Tankard's trademark characteristics, it also differs from the previous releases to a small degree. Lyrics are generally more serious than before, and there is a bit more variety in tempos than you might expect from a typical Tankard album. It is still easy to recognize the sharp guitar sound almost instantly, and most tracks remain similar to the band's past works. Some lack of the usual happy spirit can make this release sound somewhat more average and not so uplifting though by no means bad. Also, while certain more varied tracks have their moments, too, this album clearly proves that constantly fast thrashers are the band's strongest area, formulaic or not. Some deviation from traditions put aside, “Two-Faced\" is a fair pick for anyone who enjoys Tankard's style!\n\nLimited Gatefold 180g Black Vinyl + A2 Poster. Remastered re-edition contains five live bonus tracks taken from the \"Open All Night\" VHS recording.\n\nNoise Records/Nuclear Blast Records, 1994/2013 (NB 3127-1). Made in Germany.

Zombie Attack\n\n7. Alcohol\n\n8. Chemical Invasion\n\n9. (Empty) Tankard\n\nThe fourteenth full-length studio album by legendary German Thrash Metal band.\n\nTankard is living proof of what could possibly be better paired than beer and German Thrash Metal. With close to 30 years of guzzling and fiery Thrashing under their belts, Frankfurt’s kings of Metal unleash \"Vol(l)ume 14\" upon the thirsting masses.\n\nFeaturing 10 new hymns extolling the virtues of alcohol and other more serious subject matter, \"Vol(l)ume 14\" will yet again delight every fan of first class Thrash Metal and show that Tankard are one of the most unique bands on Earth!\n\nAbsolutely Musthave for those who like Beer and Thrash Metal!!\n\nAFM/Pacheco Records, 2010/2011.

Weekend Warriors 07:25\n\nTotal playing time: 50:14 min.\n\nLimited Edition release of the fifteenth full-length album by legendary German Thrash Metal band.\n\nIn the 30th year of its existence, the quartet still proves to be an alcoholized tower of strength and beats us round the head with high-proof Thrash salvos on its 15th studio record.\n\nFast crushers, brilliant guitar riffs and grooving mosh attacks in combination with great melodies result in one of the best Tankard albums of all time. Songs like the title track “A Girl Called Cerveza” for which a music video will be shot, “Running On Fumes”, “Rapid Fire” or “The Metal Ladyboy” are catchy as hell and offer a huge hit potential. For the last-mentioned, Tankard could even win Metal queen Doro Pesch over as a guest vocalist!\n\nThe album was produced in the legendary Studio 23 in Frankfurt, Germany by Michael Mainx, who’s responsible for the album’s fresh and earthy sound. The fans are being served with highly entertaining hits non-stop. So get your canned beer out, crank up the volume and party hard!!\n\nWith “A Girl Called Cerveza”, the four beer fetishists will release one of the best albums of their entire career!!!\n\nLimited Edition digibook features bonus DVD with video clip, interview and full concert from 70.000 Tons Of Metal Cruise!\n\n16:9 | PCM Stereo | 0 | Approx. 50 min.

This is a much more improved Tankard than what was shown on the debut, as they stretch themselves out a lot more and offers some lengthier, more technically-involved songs that are still in perfect keeping with the energy and feel of the debut. Gone is the Punk influence and replaced with more Thrash, and the Progressive feel of some of their riffing is far more accomplished than most would ever dare to write in conjunction with the band, yet the same party vibe and cheesy lyrics remain in the sound, effectively giving the band a true classic in their discography and overall one of the finer thrash records to come from the prolific German scene of the 80s!\n\nA true musthave for any fan of the genre!! Fight for your right to drink pure beer!!!\n\nLimited Edition 180g Green/Violent Swirl Vinyl.\n\nNoise International, 1990/2018 (NOISELP042). Made in Germany.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide A:\n\n1.

Always Them 4:02\n\n9. Wheel of Rebirth 6:15\n\n10. Barfly 4:15\n\nTotal playing time: 49:48 min.\n\nThe first re-release of the seventh full-length studio album by legendary German Thrash Metal band, and, for the first time on vinyl, the debut full-length studio album by Tankard’s Punk/Metal side project, Tankwart.\n\n\"The Tankard\" (1995) was the final album released on Noise by Tankard. Where Tankard touched some serious grounds with \"Two-Faced\", the follow-up album, \"The Tankard\" strives towards notably more familiar and lightsome directions. In fact, this release may be one of Tankard’s lightest productions – by all means, heavy this is not. With a couple of exceptions, the music has a particularly happy sound despite some serious lyrics still occasionally appearing, and it seems as if the band had slowed down a bit for this record. As a whole, it’s pretty harmless stuff, not exactly a collection of classic material, although many tracks here are perhaps more memorable than on an average Tankard album. Some good, uplifting hollers like \"Minds On The Moon\" and \"Fuck Christmas\" sound particularly relaxed and play in an enjoyable manner. Perpetuating the more serious side shown on its predecessor \"Two-Faced\", its sound was a melting pot of their signature thrash with elements of speed, power, hardcore, and a dash of melody entwined with some of their catchiest choruses to date. So, it is somewhat inconsistent here and there, but some variation at times is only a good thing for this band.\n\nThe same year, Tankard redressed the humorous balance with their Tankwart side project of German language covers done in a Punk/Metal style, much to their fans' amusement.\n\n\"Aufgetankt\" (1994) is the debut album by Tankwart, the side project of Tankard. The project covered a number of German hits from the notorious ‘Neue Deutsche Welle’ era of Pop music from the early 80s. It includes \"Liebesspieler\" of Die Toten Hosen, \"Elke\" of Die Artze, \"Sternenhimmel\" of Hubertkah, \"Hurra, Hurra Die Schule Bennt\" of Extrabeit and \"Skandal Im Sperrbezirk\" of the Spider Murphy Gang. Tankwart means gas station attendants.\n\nLimited Edition Double Orange/Blue Splatter Vinyl.\n\nSanctuary Records Group Ltd./Noise Records, 1995/2018 (NOISE2LP045). Made in the EU.
