Subsequently, the FRC published the new UK Stewardship Code 2020 (“2020 Code”), which took effect from 1 January 2020, and consists of 12 Principles for asset managers and asset owners, and six Principles for service providers.\n\nThe Code applies on a ‘comply or explain’ basis and is voluntary, aiming at enhancing the quality of engagement between institutional investors and companies, to help improve long-term returns to shareholders and provide for the efficient exercise of governance responsibilities by setting out good practice on engagement with investee companies that institutional investors should aspire to.\n\nThe FRC defines ‘stewardship’ as ‘the responsible allocation, management and oversight of capital to create long-term value for clients and beneficiaries leading to sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society.’\n\nThe 2020 Code Principles are:\n\n1. Signatories’ purpose, investment beliefs, strategy, and culture enable stewardship that creates long-term value for clients and beneficiaries leading to sustainable benefits for the economy, the environment and society.\n\n2. Signatories’ governance, resources and incentives support stewardship.\n\n3. Signatories manage conflicts of interest to put the best interests of clients and beneficiaries first\n\n4. Signatories identify and respond to market-wide and systemic risks to promote a well-functioning financial system.\n\n5. Signatories review their policies, assure their processes and assess the effectiveness of their activities.\n\n6. Signatories take account of client and beneficiary needs and communicate the activities and outcomes of their stewardship and investment to them.\n\n7. Signatories systematically integrate stewardship and investment, including material environmental, social and governance issues, and climate change, to fulfil their responsibilities.\n\n8. Signatories monitor and hold to account managers and/or service providers.\n\n9. Signatories engage with issuers to maintain or enhance the value of assets.\n\n10. Signatories, where necessary, participate in collaborative engagement to influence issuers.\n\n11. Signatories, where necessary, escalate stewardship activities to influence issuers.\n\n12. Signatories actively exercise their rights and responsibilities.\n\nGoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP is an absolute return investor focusing on multiple investment strategies with an emphasis on high yield credit. While the Firm may invest in global equities, including UK equities, it is not a significant element in its investment strategies. While the 2020 Code is relevant to some aspects of the Firm's trading, and the Firm generally supports the objectives that underlie the 2020 Code, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP has chosen not to commit to the 2020 Code. The Firm invests in a variety of asset classes and in a variety of jurisdictions across Europe. The approach of the Firm in relation to engagement with issuers and their management are determined globally, on a group wide basis. The Firm, along with its U.S. affiliate, takes a global approach to engagement with issuers and their management in all of the jurisdictions in which it invests and, consequently, does not consider it appropriate to commit to any particular voluntary code of practice relating to any individual jurisdiction.\n\nIf the Firm’s approach should change in the future, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP will review its commitment to the 2020 Code and update this disclosure accordingly.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (General Data Protection Regulation) (“GDPR”)\n\nEffective 25 May 2018, GDPR has replaced previous EU data privacy laws.
