        "text": "A 3PL is a fulfillment and logistics partner that helps ecommerce and other companies store and move products for sale.Â\n\nThis article provides pretty much everything you need to know about 3PLs, so you can find the one that fits best with your business. Youâll learn what a 3PL does, how they support your supply chain operations, how a fulfillment center works, and more.\n\n3PL meaning\n\nA 3PL, or third-party logistics provider, is a partner that helps companies optimize their supply chain and logistics operations. They specialize in services such as inventory management, warehouse storage, order fulfillment, returns processing, and transportation.Â\n\nYou may also hear 3PL companies called by other names:\n\nFulfillment company\n\nOrder fulfillment companies\n\nFulfillment warehouse\n\nFulfillment center\n\nNot all 3PLs offer the same services, but their main goals are to serve your fulfillment and warehousing needs so you can streamline your supply chain management.\n\nWhat does a 3PL do?Â\n\nA few key roles of 3PLs are to store and manage inventory and fulfill orders. This lets you leverage the cost-efficiencies of a centralized inventory and strategic distribution model.Â\n\n3PLs also provide transportation services, managing the movement of inventory between various points in the supply chain. This includes coordinating shipments from vendors and customers, optimizing delivery routes, and providing real-time updates.Â\n\nSome 3PLs can also help you with global supply chain matters, such as import, export, and customs procedures.\n\nWhy do you need a 3PL?\n\nÂ A 3PL for ecommerce companies can reduce the operational burdens of running supply chains.Â\n\nBy letting a 3PL handle inventory and logistics, you can focus your resources on growth activities, like identifying new customer bases or developing new product lines.\n\nSome ecommerce companies may also work with 4PLs or fourth-party logistics providers. These providers act as consultants and managers, helping to design, run, and optimize your supply chain and logistics. They may help you source and manage 3PLs, too.Â Â\n\nWhat is 3PL logistics?\n\nThird-party logistics refers to the services described above. But thereâs some interplay between terminology here, and itâs helpful to understand it so you can speak confidently about the role of 3PL services at your company.Â\n\nWhat is 3PL terminology?\n\nThird-party logistics is a field of operations. Itâs the inventory management, order fulfillment, and transportation mentioned above. The term is often abbreviated to 3PL when speaking and writing and mentioned when referring to operations providers.Â\n\nIf your 3PL helps coordinate transportation, you may also hear the term freight forwarders. Freight forwarders manage the movement of inventory and may help provide cost savings.Â\n\n3PL services\n\nAs a service, a third-party logistics company provides ecommerce fulfillment services, taking logistics operations off your hands.Â\n\nMost third-party logistics services focus on warehouse operations. Your 3PL warehouses probably serve multiple ecommerce companies, reserving or allocating warehouse space for storage of each clientâs inventory. Then, as you receive orders, warehouse staff pick and pack products from the warehouse to ship to your customers.Â\n\nThird-party logistics may also encompass a variety of additional services. Depending on which ecommerce 3PL providers you choose, you may have access to the following:\n\nWarehousing\n\nInventory management\n\nPicking and packing\n\nShipping and receiving\n\nFTL and LTL freight shipping\n\nFreight forwarding\n\nKitting\n\nReverse logistics (returns)\n\nSpecialized 3PL services\n\nSome 3PLs specialize in specific types of warehousing and fulfillment. Thatâs because certain products have their own storage and shipping requirements to satisfy compliance regulations or preserve product integrity.Â Â\n\nFor example, some products have to be kept at exact temperatures. Supply chains that deal in these products are known as cold chains. They require refrigerated warehouse space and transportation equipment, sometimes called âreefersâ in common conversation.\n\nOther 3PL companies are set up to store and ship products that qualify as hazardous materials. Products in this category may include everyday items, like perfume or batteries, but their supply chains are highly regulated. In some instances, 3PL staff may need specific certifications to handle these materials for you and your customers.Â\n\nAnother example is large or bulky products. Only a limited number of 3PLs are able to handle and ship these products safely and accurately. If you sell products like furniture, appliances, outdoor equipment, and other large items, you need an experienced 3PL partner that can help ship large or heavy items without excessive costs.Â\n\nHow do 3PL warehouses work?\n\nYour 3PL provider owns or rents the warehouse where your products are stored, along with a variety of specialized equipment, like shelving, forklifts, and robotics.Â\n\n3PLs also hire, train, and manage their own warehouse and staff. If your products require specialized handling, the 3PLs make sure the warehouse team knows and follows the proper protocols.\n\nWarehouse management software lets your 3PL warehouse teams know where to put inventory or pick it from. That software may also keep your ecommerce website up to date so customers see available inventory in real time when they shop with you.Â\n\nSecurity measures, both physical and digital, help protect your inventory and maintain the integrity of the inventory management system. Physical security may include in-person and camera surveillance and controls like passwords or biometric data to access warehouse space. Digital security may include data encryption, access restrictions, and other measures.Â Â\n\nWhen a fulfillment center receives your products for storage, 3PL warehouse staff verify receipts against shipping documentation. Documents may include packing lists or bills of lading, which help determine the chain of custody for items. This verification ensures deliveries include the right quantities of the right products. Theyâll also inspect for damages.Â\n\nThen, when itâs time to fulfill an order, staff pick items from shelves and pack them for delivery. They make sure packages are ready for pickup by carriers that complete the shipping process.\n\nMore on how 3PL services work\n\nFulfillment can be more complex than some people realize. When youâre looking for 3PLs, consider how outsourcing fulfillment may benefit your business.Â\n\n3PL ecommerce platform integration\n\nFor seamless multichannel or omnichannel selling, a robust IT infrastructure is crucial.Â\n\nFulfillment warehouses typically use warehouse management system (WMS) software that seamlessly integrates with popular ecommerce platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, or Bigcommerce. Custom APIs may also link to your shopping carts.\n\nAn experienced third-party logistics company lets you support all sales channels and see real-time order tracking through a dashboard.Â\n\nFTL and LTL freight shipping and receiving\n\nFull truckload (FTL) and less than truckload (LTL) freight services refer to how you ship inventory based on volume. Knowing how to optimize these options may help you save money on freight.Â\n\nIf you work with large orders in predictable cycles, FTL services can help you build volume-based cost-efficiencies. When you have urgent orders to meet demand spikes or have to split orders due to supplier timing, you may benefit more from LTL.Â\n\nResidential LTL freight is also an option with some 3PLs, especially when you need to secure delivery of oversized items to customers.\n\nA 3PL may include these services in your agreements or be able to act as a freight broker, helping you find the best deals and the correct service level for your needs.Â\n\nPicking, packing, and shipping\n\nPick, pack, and ship services are the core of order fulfillment. When your customer orders through one of your sales channels, it goes directly to your fulfillment warehouse.Â\n\nThere, a picker finds the items for the order and packages the order, ensuring packing materials maintain cost efficiency. Packers are also responsible for putting the correct shipping label on each parcel and handing it off for pick up by a final-mile carrier who delivers the package to your customer.\n\nKitting\n\nKitting is when components or items are assembled into a single package before shipment. If you have a subscription-model business or require some other kitting service, itâs vital to find an experienced 3PL.Â\n\nBy outsourcing fulfillment to the right 3PL partner, you can streamline the packing and shipping of multiple items sold together or as part of a promotional bundle. This practice is common in ecommerce, where bundling complementary items simplifies the customer experience and adds value to the overall product offering.Â\n\nSame-day shipping\n\nSome third-party logistics providers offer same-day shipping services. With this shipping strategy, your customer orders are picked, packed, and shipped on the same day they purchase.Â\n\nSame-day shipping gets your orders to your customers faster, which may lead to higher satisfaction rates. At Red Stag Fulfillment, we offer same-day shipping service, with a cutoff time as late as 5 p.m.\n\nInventory management\n\nWith a 3PL partner, you can gain valuable support in inventory management. Account representatives often provide insights on restocking levels, supply chain management, and optimal seasonal inventory levels. This collaborative approach ensures efficient stock management without the burden of doing it on your own.\n\nReverse logistics\n\nItâs crucial that reverse logistics (the handling of returns) is done as efficiently as possible. Returns already represent a loss, but you can mitigate it by working with an experienced 3PL.Â\n\nYour provider examines returned items to assess damage and determine suitability for return to stock so you can resell undamaged items to someone else or take other steps as needed.Â\n\nAdditionally, your return rate depends on several factorsâincluding the type of merchandise you sellâbut a solid 3PL partner may be able to help reduce your rate by minimizing fulfillment errors and damage in the first place.Â\n\n3PL services vs. drop shipping\n\nSome ecommerce businesses use a drop shipping model instead of a 3PL. With drop shipping, you maintain an online store, but you donât invest in inventory. Instead, you integrate your store and your supplierâs order fulfillment system, and the supplier ships directly to your customer.Â\n\nThis can lead to other differences, like how long it takes to fulfill orders and how much you can profit. Letâs take a closer look at each model so you can decide which works for you.Â\n\nWhat is drop shipping?\n\nDrop shipping is an ecommerce business model where you list SKUs for sale on your online store but only purchase inventory after a customer makes a purchase. The drop ship business model requires little or no upfront capital investment, so it can be a great way to jump-start a new venture on a shoestring.\n\nDrop ship order fulfillment\n\nOnce a customer places an order, a manufacturer or distributor produces and ships items directly to them. This eliminates the need to forecast demand, purchase inventory upfront, and manage inventory carrying costs.\n\nPros and cons of drop shipping\n\nDrop shipping has advantages for some ecommerce businesses:\n\nLow capital outlay You can start a new business and offer a large range of products with a small investment using drop shipping. Your costs may be limited to the startup of your online store and your marketing.\n\nLow risk You only pay for the products customers want, so you donât end up holding stock you canât sell or have to take a hit on markdowns. Drop shipping can also be a way to do market research and refine your product line. If something doesnât sell, you can take it off your website without losing your capital investment.\n\nLow overhead You donât have to pay carrying costs, which are the ongoing costs for warehouse space to store your inventory. With drop shipping, your supplier holds the inventory in their own warehouse until itâs sold.\n\nThere can also be some downsides with this model.\n\nNarrower profit margins With drop shipping, you typically pay a higher wholesale price for products, so your profit margins are narrower.Â\n\nLonger lead times Since products are only produced or prepared on demand, lead times may be longer. Customers like fast shipping, so longer lead times may result in lower customer satisfaction, negative reviews, or a lower rate of repeat customers.\n\nSummary of third-party logistics benefits\n\nOutsourced fulfillment services help ecommerce businesses grow and thrive. Here is a quick list of some of the benefits of using a 3rd-party logistics provider.\n\nYou donât have to lease warehouse space. When using third-party logistics, you can scale warehouse space, saving money on storage and making expansion easier.\n\nYou can place your products closer to customers by choosing a 3PL based on their warehouse locations. That means faster delivery and lower shipping costs.\n\nYour 3PL partner may be able to save you money on shipping. Fulfillment warehouses are volume shippers, so they may have reduced shipping prices with major carriers. This may be especially true if you ship oversized, bulky, or heavy products.Â\n\nYou gain access to value-added services that can enhance your business, including kitting, package consolidation, and freight shipping.\n\nYou gain an expert partner. Your third-party logistics provider can help you choose the best packaging, shipping, inventory management, and reverse logistics options for your company.\n\nFulfillment professionals provide top-notch picking, packing, and shipping for your customer orders. This can help drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nYou free your team to focus on your businessâs core competencies, allowing you to focus on product development, marketing, and sales.\n\nPoor fulfillment risks customer satisfaction and profitability, but an experienced 3PL can help you scale your business for predictable growth.\n\n3PL service and ecommerce growth\n\nThe efficiency and scalability provided by 3PLs enable businesses to handle increased order volumes, adapt to market dynamics, and enhance overall operational agility.Â\n\nAdditionally, 3PLs often provide advanced technology solutions, including inventory management systems and real-time tracking. These can contribute to streamlined processes and improved customer experiences.Â\n\nWith ongoing logistical support, 3PLs reduce operational burdens for ecommerce companies and contribute to the scalability, flexibility, and growth potential of online businesses in a competitive market landscape.\n\nHow to find the best third-party logistics providers\n\nFinding the best third-party logistics provider for you involves matching your needs with a 3PLâs capabilities. Start by assessing the 3PL’s experience and expertise in your industry, ensuring they understand any unique challenges and requirements.Â\n\nConsider the geographical distribution the 3PL can achieve within one to three days with a focus on your target markets. Many customers prefer deliveries as fast as possible, so this may be crucial to customer satisfaction.\n\nInquire about operational capabilities like scalability, responsiveness, and ability to adapt to change. This can help create the foundation for a long-lasting relationship, even as your business grows.Â\n\nUltimately, the best 3PL company for your business will be the one that can communicate how its value propositions align with your needs while backing up its promises with proof points and guarantees. Letâs go into more detail about some of the considerations.Â\n\n3PL services expertise\n\nNot all 3PLs can fulfill every type of order. Depending on the products you sell, you might need to prioritize specific expertise. Look for a proven track record in areas such as warehousing, order fulfillment, transportation management, and inventory optimization.Â\n\nChoose a 3PL with industry-specific experience and advanced technological capabilities. This helps ensure a tailored and efficient logistics solution that supports your growth and adapts to evolving industry dynamics.\n\n3PL warehouse locations\n\nFocus on warehouse locations to ensure optimal distribution. Having a small number of your fulfillment centers and warehouses in the right locations positions your products close to all your customers for faster national fulfillment.\n\nAssess their network coverage and proximity to key transportation hubs to enhance the speed and reliability of order fulfillment. Choosing a 3PL with warehouses where you need them supports geographic alignment with your customer base, contributing to streamlined logistics and improved service levels.\n\n3rd-party logistics customer support\n\nLook for a 3PL company that offers responsive and transparent communication and provides a dedicated account representative or customer support team. Assess their ability to address queries, resolve issues, and provide real-time updates on your logistics operations. Effective customer support is crucial for maintaining a seamless supply chain, especially during unexpected challenges.Â\n\nSpecialty 3rd-party logistics services\n\nA 3PL with specialized experience may be especially important for regulated products that require temperature control or hazardous material certifications. Itâs also important for large, heavy, or bulky products, like furniture, appliances, outdoor equipment, and others. If you require kitting, you may need a 3PL with experience in putting kits together and returning items to inventory.\n\nResources to help evaluate 3PLs\n\nOnce youâve found 3PLs that look like a good fit for your ecommerce fulfillment, compile a list of questions to ask them.
