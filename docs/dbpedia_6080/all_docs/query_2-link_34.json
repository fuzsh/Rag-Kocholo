        "text": "The Most Stable and Rigid HVAC Ductwork created by HFC Enterprises, one of the Best Southern California Based Manufactures.\n\nHFC Enterprises is one of the best duct manufacturers who developed DuraFlange Duct Connection System to the HVAC ductwork market place in 2004. Based in Southern California, we have 20+ years of industry experience creating and manufacturing high quality innovative products. HFC Enterprises started off by supporting the mechanical contractors and duct manufacturers in Southern California and Las Vegas. Shortly after, we expanded across the nation and to Canada. Our minimalist approach to product design and vast manufacturing and engineering knowledge has led us to create the most rigid spiral pipe connector on the market—DuraFlange.\n\nThe patented DuraFlange design incorporates a rod into the outside perimeter of the flange for additional rigidity, making it ideal for oval and large size round ductwork. The flange can be constructed using a variety of 18 and 20-gauge materials including stainless steel, aluminum and paint lock. The DC ring, when used in combination with round DuraFlange rings, eliminates the need for a gasket in between the connecting flanges and creates a leak free seal. The DuraFlange System not only provides contractors with a quick and easy way to connect and install ductwork, but it provides energy conscious engineers and developers a leak free HVAC system. Air Balance Company, Inc. has tested the DuraFLange and their results conclusively show that, from 6” negative W.G. up to 10” positive W.G., the DuraFlange connection is leak-free and structurally sound."
