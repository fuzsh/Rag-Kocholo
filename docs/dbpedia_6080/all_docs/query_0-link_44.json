        "text": "Show Overview\n\nIn WordWorld, words come alive, words save the day, and words become a child's best friend.\n\nWelcome to WordWorld, the first preschool series where words are truly the stars of the show! Come along for an adventurous romp into a colorful, vibrant world of words with Duck and his lovable, legible WordFriendsâanimals whose bodies are made up of the letters that spell the word they are.\n\nMeet the WordFriends â\n\nDuck is still learning his letters and letter soundsâ¦and, often, his social skills, which can get him into some pretty silly situations. Luckily he has his WordFriends to help him out of trouble.\n\nFirst in line is usually Frog, the cautious brainiac and word âexpert,â whose crazy inventions sometimes donât work exactly as planned. Frog can get frustrated by Duck but cares for him like a brother.\n\nThere is also Sheep, who loves to pretend. She will take on the role of detective, princess, super heroâanything to help her friends!\n\nPig, a marvelous chef and a bit of a âham,â lives life moment by glorious moment.\n\nHis best buddy, Ant, is a hard-working bundle of energy who manages to keep Pig in check, run a radio station out of his anthill, and lead a family of hundreds of ant cousins.\n\nDog is a WordFriendâs best friend and is always ready to play, play, play (and build a word)!\n\nDuck and his WordFriends go on comic adventures and face challenges that can only be resolved with the right word. That word is built letter by letter, or sound by sound, during the funky âBuild a Wordâ song at the end of every episode. Once the word is built, it âmorphsâ âcomes aliveâinto the thing it is!\n\nLearn more about each episode â\n\nWord building reinforces the pre-reading concept that letters (and their sounds) make words, and that words have real meaningâ¦and power. WordWorld also introduces essential emergent literacy conceptsâsuch as sounding out letters, âchunkingâ words, and rhymingâthat all children encounter as they learn to read.\n\nEducational Approach\n\nWelcome to WordWorld, an exciting place where words come alive and the journey into reading is fun!\n\nThrough its innovative approach of immersing viewers in a word-rich place where things spell out the objects they represent, WordWorld aims to fascinate children with words and to inspire a love of words and reading.\n\nFeaturing lovable, silly characters called WordFriends who embark on adventures in a world of words, WordWorld encourages preschoolers to see words as their friends, too.\n\nProviding constant opportunity for wordplay, WordWorld empowers children as early readers by making the important connections between letters, sounds, words and meaning that are necessary for reading.\n\nWordWorldâs Research and Curriculum\n\nWordWorld is Informed by Research\n\nWordWorld is grounded in scientifically based reading research and incorporates the recommendations of the landmark report Teaching Children to Read by the National Reading Panel (2000). Additionally, as recommended by researchers, WordWorld immerses children in a language-rich environment.\n\nLiteracy experts and advisors in the fields of child development, psychology and education are an integral part of the WordWorld team and review content throughout the development process.\n\nWordWorld is also continually informed by formative research with preschool children, teachers and parents, conducted by the Michael Cohen Group. Results from these ongoing studies guide the development and production of WordWorld.\n\nâ\n\nThe Curriculum of WordWorld\n\nThe curriculum of WordWorld is designed to introduce, support and foster emergent literacy skills in children ages three to five.\n\nThe curriculum draws from four skill sets critical for young childrenâs emergent literacy: print awareness, phonological sensitivity and letter knowledge, comprehension (including vocabulary development), and socio-emotional skills.\n\nHere are some details about each skill set and the specific skills/knowledge that WordWorld addresses:\n\nPrint Awareness\n\nThe understanding of the characteristics of print what it looks like, how it is organized and how it works.\n\nThrough regular exposure to WordWorld, children will develop an emerging sensitivity to and recognition of the following:\n\nWords, both spoken and written, carry meaningful messages.\n\nPrint moves from left to right.\n\nSpeech and print are characterized by individual words.\n\nThere is a relationship between speech and print.\n\nMany words represent real-life objects.\n\nCommon terms of print such as: word, read, spell, letter.\n\nPrint has multiple functons, that is, that print is used in a variety of different contexts such as: playing games, making product labels, getting directions, making lists for shopping, making notes for remembering information.\n\nPhonological Sensitivity and Letter Knowledge\n\nThe ability to recognize, identify and manipulate the sequence of sounds represented in words.\n\nThrough regular exposure to WordWorld, children will develop:\n\nAn increasingly clear understanding that letters represent sounds, sounds make up words, and words stand for real things in the world.\n\nA growing awareness of letters and the sounds they represent.\n\nAn emerging sensitivity to and recognition of the following:\n\nRhyming words.\n\nThe visual and auditory segments in words.\n\nThe blending of word parts into words.\n\nThe names of a sample of letters.\n\nA sample of letter-sound relationships.\n\nThe concepts (though not the terminology) underlying such structures as compound words, plurals, comparatives and superlatives.\n\nAspects of phonological awareness such as discrimination, segmentation and blending.\n\nAural syllabication.\n\nComprehension\n\nThe process of making sense of spoken and written language.\n\nThrough regular exposure to WordWorld, children will develop an increasingly clear understanding of the vocabulary, grammatical structures, thinking strategies and concept/content knowledge that will contribute to comprehension. WordWorld aims to help children demonstrate increasing awareness and/or understanding of:\n\nNew vocabulary items.\n\nLiteral question and answer relationships.\n\nPredictions.\n\nCause and effect relationships.\n\nConcepts (though not necessarily the terminology) underlying such structures as compound words, plurals, comparatives and superlatives.\n\nProblem-solving contexts.\n\nInferences from statements or actions.\n\nStory elements such as characters, setting, problem and solution.\n\nNew concept and content background knowledge.\n\nSocio-Emotional Skills\n\nThe skills that allow individuals to work cooperatively, learn effectively, and interact successfully in social contexts. In WordWorld, socio-emotional skills are presented in two broad categories: self awareness and social awareness.\n\nSelf-Awareness Skills\n\nPerception of oneself as a successful learner.\n\nThrough regular exposure to WordWorld, children will develop an increasing ability to see themselves as learners and readers, as well as an emerging sensitivity to and understanding of the following:\n\nSeeing themselves as readers.\n\nExperiencing success in recognizing words.\n\nViewing reading as an enjoyable, pleasurable and attainable activity.\n\nRecognizing words they can read.\n\nSocial Awareness Skills\n\nThe ability to imagine how others feel, to recognize and understand ways that others may be different, to solve problems, and to make sensible decisions.\n\nThrough regular exposure to WordWorld, children will develop an awareness of skills that foster positive interpersonal relationships. Children will develop an emerging sensitivity to and recognition of the following skills in personal interactions:\n\nIdentifying and considering the feelings of others.\n\nShowing concern for others.\n\nSharing with others.\n\nRecognizing and appreciating differences.\n\nApplying appropriate decision making in the solution or resolution of problems.\n\nActing fairly.\n\nIdentifying positive qualities in others.\n\nDiscovering ways to work and play effectively with others.\n\nIdentifying common problems and resolutions/solutions.\n\nSeeking help when necessary.\n\nGuided Learning resources â"
