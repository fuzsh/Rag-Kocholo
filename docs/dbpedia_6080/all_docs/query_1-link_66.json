Any costs excluded under Subsection (e) may not be subtracted under this subsection.\n\n(g) A taxable entity that is allowed a subtraction by this section for a cost of goods sold and that is subject to Section 263A, 460, or 471, Internal Revenue Code, may capitalize that cost in the same manner and to the same extent that the taxable entity capitalized that cost on its federal income tax return or may expense those costs, except for costs excluded under Subsection (e), or in accordance with Subsections (c), (d), and (f). If the taxable entity elects to capitalize costs, it must capitalize each cost allowed under this section that it capitalized on its federal income tax return. If the taxable entity later elects to begin expensing a cost that may be allowed under this section as a cost of goods sold, the entity may not deduct any cost in ending inventory from a previous report. If the taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold that may be allowed under this section, a cost incurred before the first day of the period on which the report is based may not be subtracted as a cost of goods sold. If the taxable entity elects to expense a cost of goods sold and later elects to capitalize that cost of goods sold, a cost expensed on a previous report may not be capitalized.\n\n(h) A taxable entity shall determine its cost of goods sold, except as otherwise provided by this section, in accordance with the methods used on the federal income tax return on which the report under this chapter is based.

Section 3.357) of real property is considered to be an owner of that labor or materials and may include the costs, as allowed by this section, in the computation of cost of goods sold. Solely for purposes of this section, a taxable entity shall be treated as the owner of goods being manufactured or produced by the entity under a contract with the federal government, including any subcontracts that support a contract with the federal government, notwithstanding that the Federal Acquisition Regulation may require that title or risk of loss with respect to those goods be transferred to the federal government before the manufacture or production of those goods is complete.\n\n(j) A taxable entity may not make a subtraction under this section for cost of goods sold to the extent the cost of goods sold was funded by partner contributions and deducted under Subsection (c)(13).\n\n(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the taxable entity is a lending institution that offers loans to the public and elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the entity, other than an entity primarily engaged in an activity described by category 5932 of the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the federal Office of Management and Budget, may subtract as a cost of goods sold an amount equal to interest expense. For purposes of this subsection, an entity engaged in lending to unrelated parties solely for agricultural production offers loans to the public.\n\n(k-1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following taxable entities may subtract as a cost of goods sold the costs otherwise allowed by this section in relation to tangible personal property that the entity rents or leases in the ordinary course of business of the entity:\n\n(1) a motor vehicle rental or leasing company that remits a tax on gross receipts imposed under Section 152.026;\n\n(2) a heavy construction equipment rental or leasing company; and\n\n(3) a railcar rolling stock rental or leasing company.\n\n(k-2) This subsection applies only to a pipeline entity: (1) that owns or leases and operates the pipeline by which the product is transported for others and only to that portion of the product to which the entity does not own title; and (2) that is primarily engaged in gathering, storing, transporting, or processing crude oil, including finished petroleum products, natural gas, condensate, and natural gas liquids, except for a refinery installation that manufactures finished petroleum products from crude oil. Notwithstanding Subsection (e)(3) or (i), a pipeline entity providing services for others related to the product that the pipeline does not own and to which this subsection applies may subtract as a cost of goods sold its depreciation, operations, and maintenance costs allowed by this section related to the services provided.\n\n(k-3) For purposes of Subsection (k-2), \"processing\" means the physical or mechanical removal, separation, or treatment of crude oil, including finished petroleum products, natural gas, condensate, and natural gas liquids after those materials are produced from the earth. The term does not include the chemical or biological transformation of those materials.\n\n(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a payment made by one member of an affiliated group to another member of that affiliated group not included in the combined group may be subtracted as a cost of goods sold only if it is a transaction made at arm's length.\n\n(m) In this section, \"arm's length\" means the standard of conduct under which entities that are not related parties and that have substantially equal bargaining power, each acting in its own interest, would negotiate or carry out a particular transaction.\n\n(n) In this section, \"related party\" means a person, corporation, or other entity, including an entity that is treated as a pass-through or disregarded entity for purposes of federal taxation, whether the person, corporation, or entity is subject to the tax under this chapter or not, in which one person, corporation, or entity, or set of related persons, corporations, or entities, directly or indirectly owns or controls a controlling interest in another entity.\n\n(o) If a taxable entity, including a taxable entity with respect to which cost of goods sold is determined pursuant to Section 171.1014(e)(1), whose principal business activity is film or television production or broadcasting or the distribution of tangible personal property described by Subsection (a)(3)(A)(ii), or any combination of these activities, elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the cost of goods sold for the taxable entity shall be the costs described in this section in relation to the property and include depreciation, amortization, and other expenses directly related to the acquisition, production, or use of the property, including expenses for the right to broadcast or use the property.\n\n(t) If a taxable entity that is a movie theater elects to subtract cost of goods sold, the cost of goods sold for the taxable entity shall be the costs described by this section in relation to the acquisition, production, exhibition, or use of a film or motion picture, including expenses for the right to use the film or motion picture.\n\nAmended by:\n\nActs 2006, 79th Leg., 3rd C.S., Ch. 1 (H.B. 3), Sec. 5, eff.

Subject to Section 171.1014, a taxable entity to which this subsection applies that elects to subtract compensation for the purpose of computing its taxable margin under Section 171.101 may subtract health care benefits as provided under Subsection (b) and may also subtract:\n\n(1) for the first 12-month period on which margin is based and in which the taxable entity provides health care benefits to all of its employees, an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the cost of health care benefits provided to its employees for that period; and\n\n(2) for the second 12-month period on which margin is based and in which the taxable entity provides health care benefits to all of its employees, an additional amount equal to 25 percent of the cost of health care benefits provided to its employees for that period.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding the actual amount of wages and cash compensation paid by a taxable entity to its officers, directors, owners, partners, and employees, a taxable entity may not include more than $300,000, or the amount determined under Section 171.006, per 12-month period on which margin is based, for any person in the amount of wages and cash compensation it determines under this section.
