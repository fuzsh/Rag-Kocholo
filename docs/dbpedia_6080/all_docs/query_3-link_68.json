        "text": "Trade Logistics improving in developing countries, but more needs to be done\n\nThe 2023 edition of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) report comes at a time when disruptions of global value chains have revealed the crucial importance of logistics systems. Because of these disruptions, supply chain resilience and its national security implications have emerged as top concerns. These concerns are often linked with supply chain security â€“ a key consideration in a highly digitalized and globally connected service industry.\n\nThe capacity of developing countries to efficiently move goods and connect manufacturers and consumers with international markets is improving, albeit slowly. But much more is needed to close the existing \"performance gap\" between high and low performers. Supply chains are only as good as their weakest link, and sustainable improvements require complex changes in a range of policy dimensions in areas including infrastructure, trade facilitation and logistics services."
