        "text": "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\n\nThe below statement is based on requirements related to Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on Sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (the “SFDR”). The purpose of the Disclosure Regulation is to achieve more transparency on how financial market participants consider any environmental, social, or governance event or condition that, if it occurs, could have a negative material impact on the value of an investment (“Sustainability Risks”).\n\n“Crow Holdings Capital believes Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) considerations may impact investment outcomes. As a result, Crow Holdings Capital strives to focus on ESG throughout the investment lifecycle in order to invest with a sense of purpose and responsibility, to positively impact communities and to add social and economic value. Crow Holdings Capital considers a variety of sustainability factors in connection with the investment strategies of their funds, which centre around acquisition, development and ownership of real estate properties. Such factors may include, where reasonably practicable but are not limited to, improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the implementation of energy saving methods such as lighting retrofits, cool roofs, installing smart thermostats, energy-efficient appliances, and electric vehicle charging stations; improving water conservation through the installation of high-efficiency plumbing fixtures, water detention systems, improving landscape irrigation practices and incorporating native plants; reducing waste, recycling and restoring soil and disturbed habitats during the construction phase; evaluating green building certifications; and facilitating tenant well-being through convenient fitness facilities and improving indoor air quality. Such factors will generally attempt to be identified at the due diligence stage of the investment process and, where appropriate, are monitored throughout the duration of the investment. As part of Crow Holdings Capital’s commitment to sustainability, its parent company, Crow Holdings, sponsors and participates in EarthX, a non-profit environmental organization dedicated to education and awareness of sustainable initiatives. Crow Holdings Capital will continue to monitor industry standards and best practices towards ESG integration.”"
