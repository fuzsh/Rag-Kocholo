        "text": "Break clauses are typically included in commercial leases to allow the tenant or landlord (and occasionally both) to terminate the lease prior to the natural end of its contractual term. Senior Associate Rhodri Preece explains why adherence to any conditions and notice requirements for the break is paramount, as the Courts of England and Wales take a strict interpretation against failure to comply.\n\nKatten Insolvency and Restructuring Partner Marc Roitman was selected for The M&A Advisor's 15th Annual Emerging Leaders Awards, which honor professionals under the age of 40 who have made significant contributions to the fields of restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate finance, while demonstrating unwavering dedication to their profession and to charitable causes.\n\nKatten's 2024 Diversity Equity and Inclusion Report, aptly themed \"Interwoven,\" is a testament to the rich tapestry of diverse identities that enrich our community. The stories in these pages show the many ways Katten is deeply committed to DEI and how we are actively striving to create an inclusive work environment where everyone's identity is welcomed and celebrated.\n\nIf you're seeking to join a firm where you can enjoy exceptional career opportunities, as well as the resources to help you take your personal and professional goals to the next level, take a closer look at Katten.\n\nSports and Sports Facilities Partner Daniel H. Render led a Katten team in representing the new majority owners of the Charlotte Hornets in their acquisition of a controlling interest in the team from basketball superstar Michael Jordan. The complex, high-value, high-stakes transaction meant the end of Jordan's 13-year majority ownership of the team.\n\nThe buyer group was led by Gabe Plotkin, a hedge fund founder and manager, and Rick Schnall, a private equity firm president, and included rapper J. Cole and country music artist Eric Church, as well as Dan Sundheim, Chris Shumway, Ian Loring, Dyal HomeCourt Partners, Andrew Schwartzberg and local Charlotte-based investors Amy Dawson and Damian Mills.\n\nIn June of 2023, Northbrook, Illinois-based Pinstripes Inc., which at the time had 13 locations in eight states and Washington, DC, announced plans to go public with a large-scale expansion of its experiential dining and entertainment brand combining bistro, bowling, bocce and private event space. As part of its growth strategy, Pinstripes is filling holes left by disappearing big-box shopping mall anchors, revitalizing retail spaces with its brand of dining and entertainment and hosting events that range from company outings and birthday parties to weddings.\n\nTapped by Partner Christopher Atkinson, Co-Chair of Katten's Mergers & Acquisitions and Private Equity Practice, Capital Markets Partner Mark Wood led the legal team that helped Pinstripes go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Banyan Acquisition Corporation (Banyan). The deal, which closed at the end of 2023, valued Pinstripes at approximately $380 million, based upon a value of $10 ascribed to each SPAC share. The transaction included an equity investment of over $20 million directly in Pinstripes by Middleton Partners, a Chicago-based investment firm, and a debt investment of $50 million in the combined company by Oaktree Capital Management. The deal closed on schedule, with Pinstripes' common stock commencing trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on January 2, 2024."
