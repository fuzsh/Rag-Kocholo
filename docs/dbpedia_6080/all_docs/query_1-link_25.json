        "text": "The amount of technical jargon in the world of journalism—often even for very simple concepts—is notorious, and even if you’ve spent a few years at broadcast journalism school there will still be terms that’ll inevitably mystify you when starting your career.\n\nBut fret not! Below you’ll find a glossary of the most common broadcast journalism terms, as well as definitions for the most confusing and ambiguous lingo still used today:\n\nCommon Broadcast Journalism Terms & Slang\n\nAdvocacy Journalism – In which the reporter or journalist openly declares their stance on an issue while attempting to espouse it with factual reporting.\n\nActive Proceedings – Any ongoing judicial case in which the activities of journalists may impede or subvert the proceedings, typically spanning between the arrest of a suspect and sentencing. Those who contravene reporting restrictions on active proceedings may be held in contempt of court.\n\nActuality – Sometimes shortened to “act.” Any audio recording taken outside of the studio on location (typically referred to as a sound bite in radio; see below.)\n\nAnchor – News anchors are responsible for presenting stories on-camera, usually from a studio location though work can take place in the field. See our broadcast journalism jobs page for more info on the different professions within the field.\n\nAP Stylebook – The Associated Press Stylebook, commonly adhered to as the industry standard on formatting and word usage in news writing.\n\nA-Roll – The main portion of audio video footage in a news story.\n\nAston – An increasingly uncommon term for the strap line, more popularly known in broadcast journalism as the lower third (see below)\n\nAttribution – The written phrase that identifies the source of a fact, opinion, or quote in a story.\n\nBack Timing – The practice of rehearsing the final segment of a news broadcast and timing it; during the live broadcast, the director may then speed up or slow down this segment to coincide with the scheduled finishing time of the program.\n\nBackgrounder – A story used to provide history and context to a current news story.\n\nBeats – The areas of expertise in which a journalist or reporter covers on a regular basis and on an in-depth level, such as politics, health, or law enforcement.\n\nBeat Checks – A list of established contacts that a beat reporter will frequently touch base to find or develop a story. These could include the local law enforcement agency, city council, hospital, or other sources.\n\nBlind Interview – More common in print than in broadcast journalism, a blind or off-the-record interview is one in which the interviewee is intentionally left unaccredited (also known as a non-attributable.)\n\nBridge – An audio track linking between two news items.\n\nBreakbumper – A short (2-10 second) indent used as filler leading into and out of commercial breaks. Often shortened to “bump,” but not to be confused with the verb of the same name (to bump a story is to place it higher or lower on the scale of priority.)\n\nB-Roll – Supplementary material to complement the A-Roll, such as establishing shots or graphical overlays.\n\nChroma Key – Also known as green screening. See this post for further information.\n\nChyron – The words on the screen that identify speakers, locations, or story subjects.
