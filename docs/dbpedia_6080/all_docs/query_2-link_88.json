The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) identified Oxy in November 2021 as one of only three oil and gas companies that \"have set emissions reduction targets which are ambitious enough to reach Net Zero by 2050 and to align with TPI’s 1.5°C benchmark.” We have provided more details on our net-zero strategy, including interim 2024 and 2032 goals. We also have endorsed the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 and published our Climate Policy Positions and Climate Advocacy and Engagement. We were the first U.S. upstream oil and gas company to enter into sustainability-linked credit facilities, under which the fees we pay are tied to GHG emission reductions."
