Most of her singles made the Top 5 in many countries around the world.\n\nNelly Furtado is one of the few Canadian artists to win a Juno, BRIT, and Grammy award, the three most prestigious music awards in the English-speaking world. It has proved very difficult for Canadians to win a BRIT award, as the British have normally given the awards in their international categories to Irish and American artists.\n\nFurtado’s parents immigrated to Canada from Portuguese islands the Azores in the 1960s. She was born and raised in the capital of British Columbia and was named after Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim. She began singing in Portuguese from age four. At nine, she began learning to play musical instruments including the trombone, ukulele, guitar, and keyboards. She began writing songs when she was 12. In her teens she joined a Portuguese marching band. She also taught herself Spanish, which is relatively close to Portuguese. Her first job was working as a chambermaid.\n\nAfter high school, Nelly moved to Toronto to live with her sister. She performed at the Honey Jam talent show attracting the attention of The Philosopher Kings’ Gerald Eaton and Brian West. They helped her put together a demo tape of her songs which was well-received by Los Angeles-based DreamWorks Records. Her first (promotional) single “Party’s Just Begun” appeared in the soundtrack of the film Brokedown Palace.\n\nHer debut album, Whoa, Nelly!, co-written and co-produced by Eaton and West, came out in Y2K. “I’m Like a Bird” was an international Top 5 hit, winning for her a slew of awards, including a Grammy and the Juno for song of the year. The song, along with “Turn off the Light”, were the only two songs by a Canadian artist to appear in the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart for 2001. The album was certified quadruple-platinum in Canada and sold 7 million copies worldwide. It was also praised by music critics for incorporating an innovative blending of various musical styles.\n\nShe embarked on an exhaustive tour to support the album, after which she visited her parents’ old stamping grounds—their home village in the Azores. By this time she was pregnant with her daughter, Nevis, the father being Jasper Gahunia. The connection with her roots from the trip influenced her crafting of Folklore, her sophomore album. Furtado opted for a less poppy, more artistic sound, inviting several skilled musicians to contribute: Brazilian folk legend Caetano Veloso, American banjo virtuoso Béla Fleck, strings group the Kronos Quartet, and Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger.\n\n“Powerless (Say What You Want)” won her second Juno for song of the year. “Força” became the official anthem of the 2004 European Football Championship. She performed the song at the final in Lisbon. Although the lower sales were attributed to the album’s less poppy sound, DreamWorks did not promote the album as well as her first, caught up in the disarray of being sold to Universal Music. Later it was taken over by Geffen.\n\nAmerican producer Timbaland (Timothy Zachery Mosley) agreed to produce Nelly’s third album, Loose, a mishmash of pop, R&B, hip hop, and 80s new wave. She had, in the three years since Folklore, written 40 songs and chose the 13 best to appear on the album. It became her most successful work, selling 10 million copies worldwide and winning for her Junos for album of the year and artist of the year. She also won her third Juno for song of the year (“Promiscuous”). Moreover, Furtado won the coveted BRIT Award in the United Kingdom for Best International Female Solo Artist. She was the only Canadian artist to do so through the entire decade (2000-2009). Loose spawned four number one singles around the world. Although “Promiscuous” finished as the 3rd biggest song of the year in the U.S., the song “Say It Right” ultimately became Nelly Furtado’s biggest hit internationally, topping the charts in France, New Zealand, the United States, Sweden, and Switzerland. It peaked at #2 in Australia, Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. It was #5 in Canada and #10 in the U.K.\n\nIn 2008, Furtado married Cuban sound engineer Demacio Castellón, who had worked on her Loose album.\n\nNelly released, not a Portuguese, but a Spanish-language album, Mi Plan in 2009. She had included the odd Portuguese song in previous albums and probably felt that Spanish was a more lucrative market. She justified the choice by saying that she loved Spanish pop music and most Portuguese music embraced more traditional styles. The album peaked at #6 on the European albums chart. Unfortunately, we do not have access to the charts in Spain and Latin America to see how well the singles did.\n\nNelly Furtado performed a duet with Bryan Adams at the start of the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver. That year, she received a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame in Toronto. She released a greatest hits album with three new songs including “Night Is Young” as well as a Mi Plan remix album, a dancier version of her Spanish release.\n\nIn 2012, Furtado released The Spirit Indestructible, the biggest hit from the album being “Big Hoops” which made the Top 30. She also collaborated with K’Naan in the Top 15 single “Is Anybody Out There”."
