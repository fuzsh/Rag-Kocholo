        "text": "Nelly Kim Furtado is a singing sensation who rose to fame with her debut album ‘Whoa, Nelly!’ which spawned two award-winning hits. She is a highly successful artist with a worldwide sale of over 40 million records and is the proud recipient of several prestigious awards including the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. She was born into a family of music lovers and her mother used to sing in the church choir. Her own love for music was evident from childhood and she began singing duets with her mother at the church. By the age of nine, she had learned to play musical instruments like ukulele and trombone and began to write songs when she was 12. She started performing with a marching band as a teenager. She comes from a working-class family and had known the virtue of hard work from an early age. She also believes that she got her strong work ethic from her family background. Her performance at a Honey Jam Talent Show got her noticed by the singer Gerald Eaton who invited her to write songs with him. He also helped release her debut album which went on to become an international success. Since then she has produced several highly successful singles and albums."
