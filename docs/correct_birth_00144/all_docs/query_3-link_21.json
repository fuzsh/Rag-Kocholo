        "text": "Nelly Furtadoâs 2000 debut single, âIâm Like a Bird,â positioned her as the next post-Lilith Fair star. But the Canadian singer/songwriter had a much different flight path in mind: In under a decade, she would transform into a pop powerhouse, slipping elements of folk, dance, R&B, hip-hop, Latin pop, and worldbeat into the charts. Born in Victoria, Canada, in 1978 to Portuguese immigrants, Furtado grew up singing, first in her parentsâ native language. She eventually learned trombone, guitar, and keyboards, and began soaking up â90s hip-hop, trip-hop, and R&B. All those influences fused together on her 2000 debut album, Whoa, Nelly!, a playful pastiche of acoustic riffs, brash raps, woozy beats, and even a little fado. While she embraced more of her heritage on 2003âs Folklore with banjo-powered anthems âForcaâ and âPowerless (Say What You Want),â she found full liberation on 2006âs Loose. Producer Timbaland brought out Furtadoâs provocateur potential, as proven on the slinky hip-pop hit âPromiscuousâ and Hall & Oates-nodding âManeater.â A chart-topping superstar at this point, sheâd only keep pushing her boundaries, releasing the Spanish-language album Mi Plan in 2009, followed by the dark electronic and hip-hop experimentations of 2012âs The Spirit Indestructive and the carnivalesque indie-pop of 2017âs The Ride. If anything, Furtadoâs greatest allure remains her fascinating unpredictability."
