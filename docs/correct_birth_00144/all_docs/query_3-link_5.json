        "text": "It's been 23 years since Nelly Furtado catapulted to stardom with her breakout single I'm Like A Bird.\n\nThe pop star performed some of the biggest songs of the early '00s that still show up on our nostalgia playlists – like Promiscuous and Maneater – and some of her hits have been given a new lease on life on TikTok.\n\nBut after spending more than five years at the top of the charts, breaking records and winning awards, she practically vanished overnight.\n\nThat is, until, she made her big return to the spotlight with a surprise appearance at a US music festival.\n\nWatch the video above.\n\nFurtado wowed fans by joining Aussie musician Dom Dolla at Lollapalooza festival in Chicago, performing their recently-released collaboration Eat Your Man.\n\nThe Canadian singer also did a rendition of her smash hit Maneater, slyly asking the audience if they knew the song.\n\n\"I'd like to bring out a very special guest,\" said Dolla midway through his set. \"Who knows Nelly Furtado?\", as shocked fans ran closer to the stage for a better view.\n\nDolla told Forbes she was the one who orchestrated their collab earlier this year.\n\n\"She reached out to me out of the blue,\" he said. \"She said she was a fan of my music and wanted some help with her original records.\n\nThis wasn't the first time the Canadian singer shared the stage with the Aussie DJ – she joined him for a performance at a music festival in Australia over New Years. After that, they began working together and Eat Your Man was born.\n\nFurtado also recently celebrated another big milestone, posing for Fault magazine, marking her first official photoshoot in six years.\n\n\"I ripped another Band-Aid off! First photoshoot in 6 years?! Thanks @FAULTMagazine, Happy to be your cover woman,\" Furtado, 44, tweeted, sharing her cover with fans.\n\nThe mum-of-three looked positively glamorous in the series of images, where she posed in several stylish outfits.\n\nIt marks Furtado's tentative return to mainstream media after her last album release, The Ride, in 2017.\n\nSo what happened to Nelly Furtado over the past six years? Here's everything you should know about the former pop icon.\n\nWhy did Nelly Furtado disappear?\n\nNelly Furtado took a step back from music and the public spotlight after a nervous breakdown in 2006.\n\n\"I had a nervous breakdown on stage,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2017.\n\n\"I was on the Loose tour [2007] and my daughter was with me – I was being a mum and a singer on the road. I was exhausted.\"\n\n\"Then one night I went on stage and I suddenly realised how stressed out I was. I actually cried my way through the first two songs. I took a break from music and went home. And I realised that being at home and having the whole family experience was what I was seeking.\"\n\nShe said she shot to such heights of fame so quickly that she couldn't handle it.\n\n\"It was too much too soon,\" she added.\n\n\"After two years of intense touring and partying, I'd spend hours alone in my LA home, just staring at the floor. I felt like a fraud, believing that people liked me for my image and not my music.\"\n\nShe released a Spanish language album in 2009 called Mi Plan, and another album in 2012, The Spirit Indestructible – after which she took a five-year break.\n\nFurtado spent those five years travelling and doing a lot of charity work with Save The Children.\n\nIn 2017, she released an independent album, The Ride, under her own record label. It only sold 1,814 copies in its first week in the US.\n\nAfter releasing her independent album in 2017, it's unlikely that Furtado will ever return to mainstream music.\n\nShe decided to start her own record label because she feels very passionately about artists owning the master recordings of their own songs –– an issue Taylor Swift has spoken about at length.\n\nShe told Forbes: \"Becoming independent and owning this new record has been very pivotal for me because I'm able to own everything that I sing.\"\n\nHowever, the singer did delight fans when she made a surprise appearance at Drake's concert at OVO Fest in Toronto on July 30. The rapper invited his fellow Canadian on stage, in what appears to be her first public gig in years.\n\n\"This right here took a lot … this next person's music changed my life so much. I love her with all my heart so when she comes out here you better show her some f---ing love too,\" Drake told the crowd to hype them up as he introduced Furtado.\n\nREAD MORE: What happened toHome Alonestar Macaulay Culkin?\n\nThe pop star was met with cheers and applause as she engaged with fans before performing her hit song Promiscuous Girl.\n\nDrake and Furtado later sing a duet of her other hit, I'm Like a Bird.\n\nWhere is Nelly Furtado today?\n\nAfter releasing her independent album in 2017, it's unlikely that Furtado will ever return to mainstream music.\n\nShe decided to start her own record label because she feels very passionately about artists owning the master recordings of their own songs –– an issue Taylor Swift has spoken about at length.\n\nShe told Forbes: \"Becoming independent and owning this new record has been very pivotal for me because I'm able to own everything that I sing.\"\n\nWhat is Nelly Furtado's net worth?\n\nBecause Furtado holds song-writing and producer credits on her songs – some of which were the biggest of their decade – she continues to make a lot of money off her first few albums.\n\nEstimates put her net worth at around $US20 million ($26.6 million).\n\nWhat happened to Nelly Furtado and Timbaland?\n\nEver since Timbaland and Furtado worked on her 2006 album Loose together, they've been close friends – and that friendship still remains today.\n\nIn 2017 Timbaland surprised contestants on the TV show The Pop Game with a mentoring session from the pop star.\n\nWhat is Nelly Furtado's nationality?\n\nFurtado was born in Canada to Brazilian parents who migrated to North America in the 1960s.\n\nShe first began singing in Portuguese as a child and performed in a Portuguese marching band as a teen.\n\nNelly Furtado's relationship history\n\nThe Promiscuous singer married sound engineer Demacio Castellon in 2008, though the pair divorced in 2016. She has one daughter, Nevis Chetan, born in 2003 from a previous relationship.\n\nWhat does Nelly Furtado look like now?\n\nNelly Furtado does have an Instagram, but she doesn't use it for much other than to promote her re-release of the album Woah, Nelly.\n\nShe does have a few stories archived, including this photo from February 2021.\n\nWhen was 'I'm Like A Bird' released?\n\nArguably her best-known single, I'm Like A Bird was Furtado's first single, released in 2000, on her debut album Woah Nelly.\n\nThat album also included bangers like Turn Off The Light and Hey, Man.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
