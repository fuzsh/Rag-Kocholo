        "text": "In a statement on her website, Furtado explained that after touring in support of 2009’s Mi Plan she wasn’t so sure about singing in English again.\n\n“I was seriously considering retiring from my career as a pop musician and pursuing other music-related and creative endeavors.\n\n“Slowly, but surely, I began to record again and eventually found a new freedom within my voice and an overwhelming sense of excitement about making pop music. That is the excitement you hear on The Spirit Indestructible. … All of these songs have incredible meaning to me and were written in moments of intense personal growth. Overall, I would describe this album as raw and honest – a friendly punch in the face.\n\n“These tracks combine hard beats with strong, dynamic, sometimes pretty vocals. It’s overall, quite a simple, at times juvenile album that was very liberating to create and gave me immense joy.”\n\nThe Spirit Indestructible Tour begins Jan. 8 in Furtado’s hometown of Victoria, British Columbia. The last stop is Jan. 30 in Montreal. All dates feature special guests Dylan Murray and Jessica Tyler.\n\nCheck out the routing below:\n\nJan. 8 – Victoria, British Columbia, Save On Foods Memorial Centre\n\nJan. 9 – Vancouver, British Columbia, Orpheum\n\nJan. 12 – Calgary, Alberta, Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium\n\nJan. 14 – Medicine Hat, Alberta, The Esplanade\n\nJan. 15 – Edmonton, Alberta, Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium\n\nJan. 18 – Winnipeg, Manitoba, MTS Centre\n\nJan. 19 – Thunder Bay, Ontario, Thunder Bay Community Auditorium\n\nJan. 21 – Ottawa, Ontario, National Arts Centre\n\nJan. 24 – Toronto, Ontario, Sony Centre For The Performing Arts\n\nJan. 26 – Windsor, Ontario, Caesars Windsor “The Colosseum”\n\nJan. 28 – Hamilton, Ontario, Hamilton Place Theatre\n\nJan. 29 – Kitchener, Ontario, Centre In The Square\n\nJan. 30 – Montreal, Quebec, St. Denis Theatre 1\n\nTickets go on sale to the public Friday, Nov. 16 at 10 a.m. local time."
