        "text": "One of Victoria’s most famous citizens, singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado travels the world performing her hit songs. Despite spending time in international destinations, she says there’s no place like home at this time of year.\n\nWherever Vancouver Islanders are taking in holiday activities, they can feel the satisfaction of knowing they are contributing to B.C.’s economy by spending their vacation dollars nearby. By visiting regional events and venues, they’re not only supporting local businesses but also helping to sustain jobs in the tourism sector.\n\nThe province’s tourism sector is strong and growing and a key sector in the BC Jobs Plan. The solid growth in the tourism sector can be linked to a number of factors including provincial tourism marketing efforts, lower fuel prices and direct flights to B.C. Compared to the rest of Canada, in 2014 B.C. was number one in absolute visitor volume growth and had the highest growth rate in total international visitation.\n\nTo find out why visitors are making B.C. their destination of choice, experience tourism offerings in your backyard. Here are some activities for your Vancouver Island staycation:\n\nSanta Swim, Campbell River, Strathcona Gardens Recreation, Dec. 12\n\nJingle into Christmas, Tofino, downtown Tofino, Dec. 4-6\n\nCoombs Country Christmas Craft Fair, Coombs, Dec. 5\n\nNew Year’s Eve Family Celebration, Parksville, Oceanside Arena, Dec. 31\n\n7th Annual Christmas Market, Nanaimo, Green Thumb Garden Centre, Dec. 5\n\nSaltspring Island Wintercraft, Saltspring Island, Mahon Hall, Nov. 28 – Dec. 22\n\nIEOA Truck Light Convoy, Victoria, begins at Ogden Point and runs throughout Victoria, Dec. 5 starting at 5:45 p.m. and Lighted Ship Parade, Victoria, Inner Harbour Dec. 5 at 4 p.m.\n\n17th Annual Sing along Messiah, Victoria, Alix Goolden Hall, Dec. 16\n\nBritish Columbians are urged to spread the news about their fun holiday activities by tweeting about them using hashtags: #StaycationBC #ExploreBC or #SnowBetterPlace.\n\nQuotes:\n\nNelly Furtado, singer-songwriter –\n\n“There's nothing like Christmas in Victoria. Grab a Christmas Lights Map and hit the streets, head to Butchart Gardens for the Christmas light show, check out the local production of The Nutcracker, or throw on a pair of skates and skate the afternoon away at your local rec centre. Cap it off with a visit to your neighbourhood coffee shop for some hot chocolate, or head downtown for some specialized gift shopping, and you'll be in the holiday spirit in no time!”\n\nShirley Bond, Minister of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training and Minister Responsible for Labour –\n\n“Nelly Furtado is right. Victoria and the rest of Vancouver Island are special places to celebrate the Christmas and holiday season. It’s been an amazing year for tourism in British Columbia. We’ve seen growth in visitor numbers from around the world. However, success also includes British Columbians enjoying a staycation and experiencing the world class tourism offerings in their own province. I encourage everyone to take in a holiday activity coming up. Make some memories with loved ones at this time of year.”\n\nQuick Facts:\n\nThe Province invests more than $90 million annually in the tourism sector in every region of our province.\n\nTourism builds communities, promotes culture and creates year-round jobs in every region or our province.\n\nStaycations help boost domestic tourism revenues and local economies and support over 19,000 businesses and 132,000 jobs in the tourism sector in B.C.\n\nThe BC Jobs Plan builds on the strengths of our key sectors and our educated and skilled workforce, keeping our province diverse, strong and growing.\n\nLearn More:\n\nFor trip planning ideas on Vancouver Island and around B.C.: http://www.hellobc.com/british-columbia/trip-ideas.aspx\n\nFor more info on Vancouver Island Tourism: http://www.hellobc.com/vancouver-island.aspx\n\nDestination BC: www.DestinationBC.ca\n\nNelly Furtado’s Official website: http://www.nellyfurtado.com/\n\nVancouver Island Tourism Association: http://www.tourismvi.ca/"
