        "text": "The debut season of “Canada’s Drag Race” has officially come to an end, and while a second season hangs in question, “Drag Race” fans await the debut season of “Drag Race Holland” airing in the Netherlands this September 18, 2020, on Videoland. Even during a global pandemic, there’s anything but a shortage of “Drag Race” this year, and although the world was thrilled by the ‘lewks’ and lip-syncs of our Canadian Queens over the summer, the Canadian judge’s panel, on the other hand, was given with the most (and worst) critiques of anyone.\n\nAllow us to be very clear, we’re not here to throw any shade or accommodate any hate! Please also be respectful in the comments because we definitely see all three permanent judges (“RuPaul’s Drag Race” Season 11 runner-up Brooke Lynn Hytes, heart-throb Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman aka “JBC,” and fashion icon Stacey Mackenzie) returning to their respective seats at the judge’s table, should there be another season…\n\nEven still, “fans” stand divided on what the Canadian triad of judges had to say, and having judged Drag competitions in the past with MoJo Toronto, specifically “Absolut Empire’s Ball” founded by Scarlett Bobo herself, we can attest that judging any sort of Drag competition is anything but easy. We can’t even imagine what editing, scripts and a global fanbase would do to the experience.\n\nNow, putting the permanent judges and everyone’s opinions of them aside, I think we can all agree that we want to see the roster of guest judges step it up next season (should Covid-19 allow it). Fingers crossed, Sissy!\n\nSo which Canadian superstars would fit the mould? We need diversity, allyship, leadership and a keen eye! They need to know what it takes to be a superstar! Not to say Tom Green isn’t a hoot, we just need some more eleganza from our Canadian celebs! Give us that Deborah Cox-level of superstardom at all times!\n\nHere’s our shortlist of Canadians we think would slay as guest judges on a metaphorical Season 2 of “Canada’s Drag Race” (in alphabetical order):\n\nALESSIA CARA\n\nBorn and raised in Brampton, Ontario, Alessia Cara is an Italian-Canadian singer/songwriter with the originality and drive of a true artist. Her songs have become empowering Pride anthems in which our community relates to and celebrates. One of her songs “Scars” was featured on this current season of “Canada’s Drag Race” during the Lip Sync For Your Life (LSFYL) between BOA and Ilona Verley, and she even performed “Wild Things” at Capital Pride in Washington, D.C., in the summer of 2018. With a young fan base, a strong song catalogue and distinctive allyship, we think Alessia Cara would make for a perfect guest judge.\n\nKESHIA CHANTÉ\n\nThe younger generation may not know who Keshia Chanté is but that’s exactly why “Canada’s Drag Race” is the perfect platform to educate the children! Keshia Chanté is a Canadian singer, songwriter, actor, television personality, dancer and philanthropist. She’s also the current host of BET’s “106 & Park” and “Entertainment Tonight Canada.” A proven powerhouse, she’s been in the entertainment industry for nearly twenty years! Her first single “Shook” literally shook the music industry and she continued to release hit after hit throughout the 2000s, even performing at Pride Toronto for an iconic BLOCKOROMA event (programmed by Blackness Yes!) in 2012. This is the perfect gig for Keshia!\n\nSIMONE DENNY\n\nThis Canadian superstar is no stranger to the spotlight! Born and raised in Toronto, Simone Denny was the lead vocalist of the famed 90s supergroup Love Inc. One of their most popular songs entitled “You’re A Superstar” was featured as the final LSFYL song on the “Canada’s Drag Race” finale between Scarlett Bobo, Rita Baga and Priyanka! Simone is also a long time LGBTQ+ ally, attending and even performing at various LGBTQ+ charity events and galas, including the “INSPIRE Awards,” where you can see Simone perform on their exclusive live-streaming event this coming Friday, September 18th at 7:00 PM EST. Simone Denny not only helped shape what it means to be a true Canadian Diva, but she’d be the perfect guest judge to find the country’s next!\n\nCELINE DION\n\nNeed I say more? The “Queen of Canada” is one of our country’s most praised celebrities, and Celine herself continues to prove why. After the airing of “A Night of 1000 Celines,” in which each “Canada’s Drag Race” contestant recreated a famous Celine Dion fashion moment, Celine’s team shared the show’s Instagram post about the episode to her official social media accounts! That’s some major visibility and praise from the one and only Celine! Not only would that entire exchange come full circle should Celine agree to guest judge an episode next season, but Celine’s proven just how much appreciation she has for Queens and over-the-top fashion. This gig is perfect for her! How does that one song go again…?\n\nIf you asked me to…?! We’re asking, Celine!\n\nNELLY FURTADO\n\nNelly Furtado is a beloved Portuguese-Canadian artist, born and raised in Victoria, British Columbia, and while she hasn’t been in the limelight lately, Nelly will always be the Grammy-winning Canadian songbird we know and love. “Canada’s Drag Race” superstar Tynomi Banks has been one of her back-up dancers for years, and Nelly is a loud and proud ally to the LGBTQ+ community, even headlining the first-ever “Canada Pride” in Montréal back in 2017. Nelly was quoted the year before at Chicago Pride saying “My gay and lesbian fans have been with me from the beginning, and my songs are about being true to yourself and not listening to what other people have to say about the choices in your life.” Here, here, Nelly!\n\nWINNIE HARLOW\n\nThis Canadian modelling mogul is an international fashion model and public spokesperson on the skin condition vitiligo. Winnie Harlow was born and raised in Mississauga, Ontario, and gained prominence in 2014 as a contestant on the twenty-first cycle of the U.S. television series “America’s Next Top Model” (hosted by the one and only Tyra Banks). Winnie has always been an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, guest judging on this summer’s smash ballroom hit “Legendary” and popping up at Pride events across the globe, including BLOCKORAMA at Pride Toronto in 2019, where R&B superstar Mya headlined. We’d love to hear what fashion model Winnie has to say about the contestants and their ensembles!\n\nAVRIL LAVIGNE\n\nHey, Hey! You, You! Who doesn’t love some Avril? The Napanee, Ontario “Sk8r Girl” who caught the world’s attention with her pop/punk princess style and bubblegum rockstar riffs has been an idol for the misunderstood for decades now, and there’s certainly no denying her songs have a special place in nearly every queer kid’s hearts. “Girlfriend” was featured on this current season of “Canada’s Drag Race” during the LSFYL between Ilona Verley and Tynomi Banks, and during quarantine, Avril shared a special Pride message for the show’s viewers. We’d love to see Avril meet (and judge) her fellow Queens of the North!\n\nDAN LEVY\n\nBorn and raised in Toronto, Ontario, the openly gay Dan Levy is no stranger to Canadian fame. His father, Eugene Levy, is one of the nation’s most celebrated comedians, and together, this father-son duo has made Canadian television history with the international success of “Schitt’s Creek.” When you think about it, both Dan and Eugene would be great guest judges! Plus, with a TV mom like Moira Rose (played by the iconic Catharine O’Hara), he’s bound to have a keen eye for over-the-top fashion! Maybe Catharine O’Hara herself would be a better guest judge?. Oh hell, we’re all a little bit Alexis, we’d love to see the whole Rose family guest judge an episode!\n\nSIMU LIU\n\nIf you haven’t seen the popular Canadian television show “Kim’s Convenience” and you’re not up to date on the roster of new movies coming from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), then you may not know who Chinese-Canadian actor, writer, model and stuntman Simu Liu is… But you really should. The insanely handsome star of the upcoming MCU film “Shang-Chi” was born and raised in Toronto and has to be one of the most humble, intelligent and impressionable Canadian actors out there right now! With all this new-found fame, not only does Simu take time to reach out to fans on social media, but he uses his platform to speak out against injustices, as well! He’s a great role model, and if he were to make a hypothetical appearance on “Drag Race,” can we assume he’d be into joining the pit crew, too?!\n\nRACHEL MCADAMS\n\nEverybody’s favourite American mean girl is actually a really sweet Canadian! Rachel McAdams was born and raised in London, Ontario, and graduated with a theatre degree from York University in 2001. Shortly thereafter, Rachel starred opposite Lindsay Lohan in the iconic teen movie “Mean Girls” as the infamous Regina George, and it’s safe to say the world has worn pink on Wednesdays ever since! Rachel lives a quiet life in Toronto but she’s as big of a movie star as any, most recently starring in the popular Netflix original film “Eurovision” opposite Will Ferrell and in 2017, she made headlines for a playing a Lesbian in the film “Disobedience” opposite Rachel Weisz, a film about the struggles of growing up as a gay woman in the orthodox community…. Get in, Rachel! You’re judging “Drag Race!”\n\nBIF NAKED\n\nBefore there was Avril, there was Bif Naked. Don’t get me wrong, both artists exude that similar type of Canadian badassery… The kind we just can’t get enough of! Bif Naked is from Vancouver, British Columbia, and between the years of 1996 and 2016, she was among the top 150 best-selling Canadian artists in Canada. You may recognize her popular hit “Spaceman” or the loud and proud anthem “I Love Myself Today,” but even if you don’t, Bif Naked is one of those talents you don’t need to try and sell – she’s the real deal. Plus, she’s an avid supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, playing shows at Pride festivals around the world throughout her career. We love Bif Naked anyday!\n\nMICHELLE ROSS\n\nThe living legend that is Michelle Ross is a Toronto-based Drag Queen who first stepped on stage in 1974 performing Dionne Warwick’s “Anybody Who Ever Had A Heart.” It’s said Michelle Ross has performed in Drag over 15,000 times and boasts some of the city’s most recognizable Drag daughters, like Devine Darlin, one of Toronto’s most exciting and well-known Drag performers. Michelle Ross herself embodies everything we love about Drag, and she remains humble both on and off stage. Not to mention, she’s helped pave the way for every Queen that competes on “Canada’s Drag Race.” Her participation as a guest judge shouldn’t even be up for debate – this is a no-brainer. Canada loves you, Michelle!\n\nJAGMEET SINGH\n\nFor a guest judge, many might not suggest a politician. But if we were, which we are, we think Jagmeet Singh (Ontario’s impressionable Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the leader of the New Democratic Party [NDP] since 2017) would be the perfect fit. Earlier this summer, Singh was expelled from the House of Commons for calling a Bloc Québécois MP “racist.” Singh tried to get all parties in the House of Commons to agree to a motion recognizing the existence of systemic racism in the RCMP, pointing out that “several Indigenous people have died at the hands of the RCMP in recent months.” While Singh may have been expelled from the House of Commons, we’d love to see him invited to be a guest judge on “Canada’s Drag Race” as an ally, activist and leader. His appearance alone would make such a huge impact! Come through, Jagmeet Singh!\n\nSHANIA TWAIN\n\nShania is a bonafide Canadian Country superstar. Period. And if that’s not enough, she’s already been a guest judge on “RuPaul’s Drag Race” Season 10! Plus, her songs have graced Drag bars across the globe since their very incarnation; “Man, I Feel Like A Woman” is a queer anthem in its own right and Shania herself is a proud ally to our community. Very recently, Shania shared an Instagram post by local Toronto Drag Queen Lucy Flawless adorning her famous leopard-print catsuit! Seeing Shania appear as a guest judge on “Canada’s Drag Race” would definitely impress us much!\n\nSo there’s our list of Canadian celebrities we’d like to see guest judge an episode on the next season of “Canada’s Drag Race!” There truly are so many amazing people to choose from; who would you like to see?\n\nIt’s a tough gig, we know, but someone has to do it!\n\nPlease note that this list is purely for entertainment purposes only and is no way affiliated with “Canada’s Drag Race,” World of Wonder, RuPaul or Bell Media.\n\nJoey Viola is the co-founder of MoJo Toronto and a published freelance writer."
