It is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) long and 10 miles (16 kilometers) wide. The city of Bellingham is located on the north shore of the bay.\n\nThe bay is a popular destination for recreation, including boating, fishing, and swimming. It is also home to a number of marine mammals, including seals, sea lions, and whales.\n\nCaptain George Vancouver was a British naval officer and explorer who is best known for his exploration of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America in the late 18th century.
