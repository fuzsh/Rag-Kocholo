        "text": "Yeah. I got a laugh out of that, too.\n\nBut she is certainly a babe. Anyone know any links to find more photos of her?\n\nIn continental Portugal, most of the times when a azorean speaks in television they put subtitles so we can understand...\n\nI got to see her for 5 Euros in Terceira the summer before last. She was walking around the city of Praia during the big festa their. I almost walked up to her but then I noticed my bottle of Super Bock was empty....... you know how it is priorities!\n\nI don't know man when I saw her in the Azores her portuguese was pretty bad.\n\nI think they should have Mariza sing the National anthem. I saw her perform in San Francisco last summer and her voice was amazing. I haven't heard a voice that good since the late great Amalia.\n\nI know Nelly Furtado, Linking Park, and Korn will be in Portugal on the 10 of June aon the Super Bock Super Rock in the Tejo Park a ex Park of the Expo 98,\n\nLincoln Park, Korn were the first to be invited, for the Rock show between the 9 and 11 of June\n\nEx-Beatle McCartney to open Portugal's 'Rock in Rio' festival\n\nFri Feb 27, 3:57 PM ET Add Entertainment - AFP to My Yahoo!\n\nLISBON (AFP) - British pop legend Paul McCartney (news) will open this year's \"Rock in Rio\" music festival in Portugal, being held for the first time outside of Brazil, and will join more than 70 performers for the six-day event.\n\nAFP/File Photo\n\nThe former Beatle added Lisbon to his European tour, and will kick off \"Rock in Rio\" in the Portuguese capital on May 28, festival organizers said Friday.\n\nBritish pop singer Sting, teen heartthrob Britney Spears (news), homegrown fado performer Mariza, US heavy metal rockers Metallica (news - web sites) and Brazilian singer Gilberto Gil are all on the schedule at the rock, pop and world music extravaganza.\n\nAround 600,000 people are expected to descend on Lisbon from May 28 to 30 and again the first weekend in June for \"Rock in Rio,\" modeled on the three-time festival in the Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWhat does her dialect sound like??\n\nNelly Furtado is a beautiful girl in real life, not just on TV. She is a wonderful person and is 100% Canadian and she was born and raised here. I beleive her parents were born in Portugal (Sao Miguel, Azores) and I dont know what her dialect sounds like as I am not Portuguese myself. All I know is that she can speak Portuguese as I heard her speak in Portuguese personally to some other friends.\n\nFurtado gets her kicks in Lisbon\n\nLISBON, Portugalâ€”Nelly Furtado is going back to her roots.\n\nFurtado, the daughter of immigrant parents from Portugal's mid-Atlantic Azores Islands, has written the official song for the European soccer championship being held in Portugal this summer.\n\nShe'll perform at a ceremony before the tournament's final match in Lisbon on July 4.\n\nFurtado, 25, grew up in Victoria, B.C. Her song, announced by Euro 2004 organizers yesterday, is called \"Forca,\" a Portuguese word that means \"strength\" or \"let's do it.\"\n\n\"It's about love of the game, love of life, love of sport,\" Furtado said in pre-recorded remarks shown at a Lisbon news scrum.\n\n\"It's inspired by watching my cousins cry when their football team loses.\"\n\nEuro 2004 officials said the song, in English, will be released as a single. Furtado also plans to produce a version in Portuguese, they said.\n\nThe Toronto-based singer has a new album out, Folklore, and collected a Juno on Sunday for the single \"Powerless\" after pausing her career for the birth of her daughter, Nevis, now six months. The father is Furtado's boyfriend, deejay Lil Jaz.\n\nShe won a Grammy for the song \"I'm Like A Bird\" from her 2000 debut album Whoa, Nelly!\n\nAssociated Press"
