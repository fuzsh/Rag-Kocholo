        "text": "Nelly Furtado is a world-class singer who was able to achieve recognition and popularity, despite the fact that she was raised in a very poor family.\n\nThe diligent and talented Nelly Furtado collected stadiums of \"fans\". Her stage image is always a note of restraint, conciseness and seasoned style. It is always interesting to watch a star, but it is even more interesting to listen to her magical voice.\n\nHow was Nelly Furtado's childhood and youth?\n\nThe future star was born in the small, provincial town of Victoria. It was in this city that the girl was born, studied and took the first step into the wonderful world of music.\n\nShe had an ordinary family. The girl's father worked at a construction site for a long time, and her mother was a cleaner. It is also known that, in addition to Nelly, the family had two more children.\n\nNelly spent her childhood in a not very prosperous area of ​​her city. The area where her house was located was inhabited by emigrants from Europe, Asia, India and Africa.\n\nSuch a \"national mix\" allowed the little girl to get acquainted with the music of different cultures.\n\nDespite the fact that Nelly Furtado's family lived in poverty, this did not stop the girl from playing music from an early age. All the children of the Furtado family sang in the church choir. The future star gave her first performance at the age of 4.\n\n“I didn’t have the sweetest childhood. Singing saved me from melancholy. Often I sang at home for my mother, who adored my voice. This was the best motivation to develop to the top of popularity,” recalls Nelly Furtado.\n\nMusical career of Nelly Furtado\n\nNelly began to get involved in professional playing musical instruments while still at school. As a teenager, she mastered the piano and guitar.\n\nThe girl was very active and often participated in various music competitions. At the age of 12, Nelly was accepted into a local jazz band. From that moment on, she actively developed her abilities, even started writing poems.\n\nNelly admits that as a teenager she was fond of rap, even mastered the musical genre. Hip-hop has become a favorite direction in music.\n\n“Reciting rap, an invisible connection was created between me and the listeners, which supported my inner state.”\n\nWhen Nellie was barely 18 years old, she decided to move to Toronto. At the beginning of her musical career, she became the leader of the Nelstar group. The girl wrote compositions in the style of trip-hop.\n\nThen a little-known group did not arouse interest. However, Furtado continued to develop further, despite the fact that the public perceived the new work very coldly.\n\nIn the same period, the girl met musician Tallis Newcreek. And they managed to record several tracks.\n\nOnce in Toronto there was a major music competition in which Nelly decided to take part. The girl was again disappointed - she did not take the prize. But fortune smiled on her.\n\nShe was noticed by famous producers Gerald Ethan and Brian West, who worked at the Dream Works Records studio. They invited a young girl to the studio, organized an audition for her and offered to sign a contract to create a debut album.\n\nNelly Furtado's first international single\n\nOn the eve of the release of the first disc, the singer released her debut single I'm Like a Bird, which gained international popularity. It was thanks to this composition that Nellie received her first Grammy Award in her life.\n\nWhoa's debut album, Nelly! well received by music lovers and music critics. It went platinum twice and sold over 1 million copies.\n\nMusic critics noted that the debut album is a kind of mix in which you can find tracks from various musical genres. When creating tracks, Nelly uses elements of rock, rap, electronica and rhythm and blues.\n\nThanks to the first album, the singer enjoyed immense popularity, which Nelly could only dream of. On the wings of popularity, Nelly rushes to the first Burn in the Spotlight tour.\n\nThe tour was very bright and profitable (from a commercial point of view). The producers who relied on an unknown performer made the right choice.\n\nAfter returning from a world tour, the singer began writing her second album. Very soon the world heard Nelly's second record, which received a very colorful name Folklore.\n\nThe main \"feature\" of the second album was that the singer \"gathered\" intonations of the national cultures of all the people of the world in this disc. The musical composition Forca was included in the musical accompaniment of the European Football World Cup.\n\nIt was a success. The singer created the second album, being in position. The album's top tracks were Childood Dreams and Try.\n\nNelly wrote the third disc under the guidance of the famous Timbaland. The album Loose, which was released in 2006, took pride of place in the top list of the Billboard 100.\n\nA year later, music critics summed up. Loose became the most popular record Nelly released. Tracks Promiscuous, Maneater and All Good Things played on all music channels.\n\nNelly Furtado collaboration with Timberlake and James Morrison\n\nIn the same period of time, Nelly began experiments. The singer recorded several songs with Timberlake and James Morrison. The track Give It to Me became the top musical composition. He has been at the top of the music charts for a long time.\n\nA little later, this track received a Grammy Award. It was nominated for an award for Best Pop Vocal Collaboration.\n\nFor her 30th birthday, Nelly released the compilation Mi Plan, which included songs in Spanish. The tracks from the new collection turned out to be lyrical. The collection of hits Mi Plan was very warmly received by the \"fans\" of the singer. This motivated me to start writing a new album.\n\nThe Spirit Indestructible is the singer's fifth studio album. She made a big bet on him, but, unfortunately, he was a \"failure\" in Nelly's homeland.\n\nBut in the countries of Eastern Europe, the album was warmly received by listeners. The track Waiting for the Night even received an award in Poland.\n\nNelly Furtado now\n\nIn 2017, Nelly pleased her fans with the release of her new album The Ride. A significant creative break benefited the singer. She recorded an album, which included musical compositions in indie style.\n\nBy the way, there are no other artists on this album. This is the first album that the singer decided to record solo.\n\nIn 2019, Nelly decided to take a creative break. She participated in various music shows and was engaged in raising children. However, the singer did not speak openly about the release of the new album.\n\nNelly has an official Instagram page. But, surprisingly, it is completely empty. Information about the performer and her musical work can be found on the official website."
