        "text": "Early Life\n\nThe son of Cuban guitarist and musician Valentin Puentes, Alex spent his formative years in Artemisa, a suburb of Havana. His first musical memory is playing the claves (a Cuban rhythm instrument) on TV with his father. Valentin taught his son to play guitar and traditional Cuban son and guajiro music in his jazz-fusion ensembles.\n\nIn 1995, while on tour with his father’s band, Alex met a girl during soundcheck at a gig on Vancouver Island. The pair married within the year and Cuba later immigrated to Canada.\n\nAlex Cuba expressed his pride in his adopted country and its influence on his music in an interview with the Georgia Straight in 2018: “I’ve seen a lot of interviews with immigrants that focus only on loss, you know, omitting the Canadian side. But my story is a little bit different, and I hope people will get that, because I am incredibly proud to talk about my Canadian side, what I’ve done here.… Because my music was made in Canada. No Latin artist in the Latin world can sound like me, because they don’t have this Canadian side that I have. They don’t have the situations, the inspirations, et cetera, that I have found in this country.”\n\nEarly Career\n\nIn 1999, Cuba settled in Victoria, British Columbia, along with his wife and his twin brother, Adonis. The siblings performed as a duo called The Puentes Brothers. Their first album, Morumba Cubana (2000), was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Global Album.\n\nHumo De Tobaco — Alex Cuba Band (2004)\n\nIn 2003, Cuba and his wife, Sarah, moved to her hometown of Smithers, BC. Not long after settling there, he recorded and released his solo debut, Humo De Tobaco (2004), which won a Juno Award for World Music Album of the Year. Humo De Tobaco was recorded in Cuba with UK-based Swedish producer Martin Terefe. The album’s top single, “Lo Mismo Que Yo,” features Ron Sexsmith and made it onto the BBC Radio 2 charts. In 2023, Cuba released a deluxe remastered gold-vinyl 20th anniversary edition of this debut.\n\nAgua Del Pozo (2007)\n\nCuba garnered another Juno Award for World Music Album of the Year for his sophomore solo record, Agua Del Pozo (2007). In its review, Exclaim! wrote: “Cuba has mastered the art of wrapping jazz, rawer pop sounds and son influences around simple yet clever meanderings about love and life’s musings.”\n\nAlex Cuba (2009)\n\nThis self-titled record features Cuba’s first-ever song English: “If You Give Me Love.” Released in the United States in 2010, the record was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in the Best Male Pop Vocal category. Said NPR of this self-titled release: “Cuba has cited Michael Jackson, funk and soul as major influences, and it shows here.”\n\nIn 2011, Cuba won a BMI Latin Award for co-writing Nelly Furtado’s No. 1 Spanish hit “Manos Al Aire.”\n\nRuido En El Sistema (2012)\n\nNOW Toronto’s review said: “The mostly Spanish-language album, whose title means ‘static in the system,’ captivates throughout.” The song “Nadie Como Tu” features Nelly Furtado. The video for “Eres Tu,” which was filmed in Smithers, won a Latin Grammy Award. In a promotional performance for CBC Radio 2, Cuba played a Spanish cover of Blue Rodeo’s “Bad Timing,” with backing vocals by Jim Cuddy.\n\nHealer (2015)\n\nReleased in March 2015, Cuba’s fifth studio record features five duets with a handful of singer-songwriters he admires, including four Canadians: Ron Sexsmith, David Myles, Alejandra Ribera and Kuba Oms. Healer was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Latin Pop category and won the Latin Grammy for Best Singer-Songwriter Album.\n\nLo Único Constante (2017)\n\nThe dozen songs on Cuba’s sixth solo record explore more of his Cuban roots. Its style includes a nod to the island nation’s filin movement from the 1940s, which fused jazz and trova. Lo Único Constante was nominated for a Latin Grammy (Best Singer-Songwriter Album) and a Grammy (Best Latin Pop Album).\n\nSublime (2019)\n\nReleased on his independent Caracol Records, Sublime was self-produced and features collaborations with five Latin American singer-songwriters. The record was nominated for a Latin Grammy. Cuba performed on the televised award show in Miami in November 2020.\n\nMendó (2022)\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, isolated at home, Cuba built a home studio. Mendó was self-produced and recorded in his living room in Smithers. After three previous nominations, this record won Cuba his first Grammy Award. In an interview following word of winning his inaugural golden gramophone, Cuba reflected on what he was most proud of: “It says Alex Cuba — Artist, Producer, Engineer, so it feels like three Grammys in one.”\n\nEl Swing Que Yo Tengo (2023)\n\nAlex Cuba’s ninth album was recorded at his home studio. The seven-song album saw him experiment more sonically. As he said: “Creating in a way that truly felt limitless, album number nine is another collection of songs for the soul from my musical universe.”\n\nOther Projects\n\nIn 2023, Alex Cuba worked on a mini-documentary and album, Voces De Mi Familia. He also produced a record by flamenco singer-songwriter Aarón Miguel (Sé). In December, he released the holiday single “Para Amarnos Es La Navidad” in three versions: Spanish, English, and a duet with Roberta Campos in Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nCuba lives in Smithers, British Columbia, with his wife, Sarah, and their three children: Daniel, Rose and Owen. After he won his first Grammy Award in 2022, his adopted hometown unveiled a two-storey mural in his honour.\n\nAwards\n\nJuno Awards\n\nWorld Music Album of the Year (Humo De Tobaco) (2006)\n\nWorld Music Album of the Year (Agua Del Pozo) (2008)\n\nLatin Grammy Awards\n\nBest New Artist (2010)\n\nBest Tropical Song (“Toma Mi Vida,” featuring Juan Luis Guerra)\n\nBest Short Form Music Video (“Eres Tu”) (2013)\n\nBest Singer-Songwriter Album (Healer) (2015)\n\nGrammy Awards\n\nBest Latin Pop Album (Mendó) (2022)\n\nSOCAN Awards\n\nHagood Hardy Award for Jazz, Instrumental and World Music (2012)\n\nHagood Hardy Award (2022)\n\nOthers"
