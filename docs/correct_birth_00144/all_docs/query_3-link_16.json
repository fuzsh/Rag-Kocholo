        "text": "Nelly Furtado is a Portuguese-Canadian singer and songwriter. Furtado is known for her musical versatility and reinvention, commonly associated with world music. She first gained fame with her trip hop inspired debut album, \"Whoa, Nelly!\", which was a critical and commercial success that spawned two top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, \"I'm Like a Bird\" and \"Turn Off the Light\". The first of the two singles won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Furtado's introspective folk-heavy 2003 second album, \"Folklore\" explored her Portuguese roots.\n\nFurtado's third album, \"Loose\", was a smash hit and became her best selling album with more than 12 million copies sold worldwide, also making it one of the best selling albums of the 2000s. The album spawned four successful number one singles worldwide; \"Promiscuous\", \"Maneater\", \"Say It Right\", and \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\".\n\nShe released her first Spanish language album, Mi Plan, in 2009, which won her a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album. In 2012, Furtado released her nostalgia inspired fifth album, The Spirit Indestructible. Furtado split with her management and went independent thereafter, releasing her indie-pop sixth album, The Ride in 2017.\n\nFurtado has sold over 40 million records worldwide, making her one of the most successful Canadian artists. She has won several awards throughout her career, including one Grammy Award from seven nominations, one Latin Grammy Award, ten Juno Awards, one BRIT Award, one Billboard Music Award, one MTV Europe Music Award, one World Music Award, and three Much Music Video Awards. Furtado has a star on Canada's Walk of Fame and was awarded Commander of the Order of Prince Henry on February 28, 2014, in Toronto by An√≠bal Cavaco Silva, the former President of Portugal.\n\nFurtado hosted a program about AIDS on MTV, which also featured guests Justin Timberlake and Alicia Keys. On September 27, 2011, Furtado announced during Free the Children's We Day Toronto, that she was giving $1,000,000 to Free the Children's effort to build girls' schools in the Maasai region of Kenya."
