        "text": "Nelly Kim Furtado is a Canadian singer-songwriter, record producer and actress. She has sold 20 million albums worldwide and 18 million Singles, bringing her total sales to nearly 40 million records. Furtado grew up in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nFurtado was born on December 2, 1978, in Victoria, British Columbia to Portuguese parents, Maria Manuela and António José Furtado, both immigrants from the Azores. Her parents were born on São Miguel Island and emigrated to Canada in the late 1960s. Her siblings are Michael Anthony and Lisa Anne. She was raised in a Roman Catholic home.\n\nAt age four she began performing and singing in Portuguese. Furtado’s first public performance was when she sang a duet with her mother at a church on Portugal Day. She began playing musical instruments at the age of nine, learning the trombone, ukulele and — in later years — the guitar and keyboards. At the age of 12, she began writing songs, and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese marching band.\n\nNelly continues to be an inspiration for Portuguese-Canadians through her philanthropic work."
