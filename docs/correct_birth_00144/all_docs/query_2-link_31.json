        "text": "Nelly's career began during a trip to Toronto. During the trip in the mid-1990s, she contributed to a track by the hip hop group Plains of Fascination. After she returned home to British Columbia and finished high school, Nelly immediately returned to Toronto in order to continue her music career. She participated in “The Honey Jam,” a talent show for urban ladies, in 1997. The Philosopher Kings’ singer Gerald Eaton and his bandmate Brain West also recognized her.\n\nEaton and West collaborated with the young singer to co-produce her debut album, “Whoa, Nelly!” in 2000. The album received four Grammy nominations and had three international singles, including ‘I’m Like a Bird.’ In 2001, she embarked on the ‘Burn in the Spotlight Tour’ to promote her record. She toured the United States, Canada, and Europe, performing in various venues. Her second album, “Folklore,” was published in 2003.\n\nShe released “Mi Plan,” a Spanish album she recorded in 2009. The album was a tremendous smash in the United States, where it was certified Platinum and reached number one on the Latin Billboard list. In 2010, she embarked on a concert tour to promote her album “Mi Plan,” stopping in Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, the United States, and Europe. She and musicians Alicia Keys and Justin Timberlake once co-hosted an M.T.V. show about AIDS.\n\nFurtado is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and actress with a net worth of $40 million. Furtado is one of the most successful Canadian singers of all time, and she arrived on the scene with a bang after releasing her debut album at the turn of the 21st century. Nelly has sold tens of millions of records throughout her career, and she has also won several awards, including a Grammy Award, a Latin Grammy Award, a BRIT Award, a Billboard Music Award, ten Junos, and many others. Her musical style is quite varied; she has experimented with Latin folk, trip-hop, pop, and hip-hop.\n\nNelly Furtado was born on December 2, 1978, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, as one of three children to Portuguese parents Maria Manuela and Antonio Jose Furtado, who originally hailed from the Azores. At 9, she started learning to play the trombone and ukulele, and two years later, she picked up the keyboard. By age 13, she was already composing songs. Subsequently, she formed a trip-hop group called Nelstar, which performed eight times at the Lilith Fair, a late 1990s touring festival featuring female artists.\n\nShe dated Jasper Gahunia from 2001 to 2005. The couple had a daughter together. Nelly was married to Demacio \"Demo\" Castellon from 2008 to 2016."
