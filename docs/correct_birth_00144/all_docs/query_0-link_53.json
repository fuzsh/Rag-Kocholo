        "text": "Nelly Kim Furtado (born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on December 2, 1978) is a singer, songwriter, record producer, and instrumentalist. Daughter of Portuguese parents, she also holds Portuguese citizenship.\n\nFurtado came to fame in 2000 with the release of her debut album Whoa, Nelly!, which featured her breakthrough Grammy Award-winning single I'm Like a Bird. After becoming a mother and releasing the less commercially successful Folklore in 2003, she returned to prominence in 2006 with the release of Loose and its hit singles Promiscuous, Maneater, Say It Right, All Good Things (Come to an End) and No Hay Igual.\n\nFurtado is known for experimenting with different instruments, sounds, genres, languages, and vocal styles. This diversity has been influenced by her wide-ranging musical taste and her interest in different cultures.\n\nAlso, in 2009 Furtado launched her own music label Nelstar Music and will introduce Toronto-based electro-dance band Fritz Helder & The Phantoms as the first act signed to the company.Furtado also says she wants to go on a new tour in the UK, and bringing out a new album.\n\nUser-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License and may also be available under the GNU FDL."
