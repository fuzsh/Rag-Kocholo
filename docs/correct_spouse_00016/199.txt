Imran's first marriage was to Jemima Goldsmith, a British heiress, journalist, and film producer. The couple married in 1995 in a two-minute ceremony conducted in Urdu in Paris. A month later, a civil ceremony was held at the Richmond registry office in England, followed by a lavish reception in the ballroom of the Goldsmiths' Surrey estate.

Jemima was born into a wealthy British family and was the eldest child of Lady Annabel Goldsmith and Sir James Goldsmith. She converted to Islam before marrying Imran Khan and moved to Pakistan to live with him.

The couple had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim, and despite their efforts to bridge cultural and geographical divides, they divorced in 2004. Jemima cited the difficulty of settling in Pakistan and the impact of political life on their family as reasons for the separation.
