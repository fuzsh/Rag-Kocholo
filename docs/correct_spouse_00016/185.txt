Cricket legend Imran Khan says he was hurt by rumours that his former wife began a relationship with actor Hugh Grant while the couple were still married.

Khan divorced his wife Jemima, the daughter of billionaire James Goldsmith, in June after nine years, saying his wife had found it difficult to adjust to living in his homeland of Pakistan, where he is pursuing a political career. The couple have two young sons.

Soon after the divorce, Jemima and Grant were seen attending parties and dinners together, and they have since confirmed they are in a relationship.

In his first interview since the divorce, Khan told Hello! magazine that he had been distressed by rumours about the timing of his wife's relationship with Grant.

"Let me categorically state that there was no infidelity in our marriage of nine years," Khan was quoted as saying.

"It hurts when you hear these insinuations.

"No marriage could have ended in such an amicable way if a third party had been involved."

Khan said he had given his blessing to the relationship between Jemima, 30, and Grant, 43.

"Jemima is obviously a very attractive woman and I knew she would meet someone new and find a new life," he said.
