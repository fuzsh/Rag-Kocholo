Cricket legend Imran Khan says he was hurt by rumours that his former wife Jemima began a relationship with actor Hugh Grant while the couple were still married.

Khan divorced his wife Jemima, the daughter of late billionaire James Goldsmith, in June after nine years.

He explained it by saying his British wife had found it difficult to adjust to living in his homeland of Pakistan, where he has been pursuing a political career.

The couple have two young sons.

Soon after the divorce, Jemima and the Four Weddings And A Funeral star Grant were seen attending parties and dinners together, and they have since confirmed they are in a relationship.

In his first interview since the divorce, Khan told Hello! magazine that he had been distressed by rumours about the timing of his wife's relationship with Grant.

"Let me categorically state that there was no infidelity in our marriage of nine years," Khan was quoted as saying.

"It hurts when you hear these insinuations. "No marriage could have ended in such an amicable way if a third party had been involved."

Khan said he had given his blessing to the relationship between Jemima, 30, and Grant, 43.

"Jemima is obviously a very attractive woman and I knew she would meet someone new and find a new life," he said.

"If it had been a sudden divorce, maybe I would have been affected by her meeting someone so quickly, but we knew where we were heading for almost one and a half years.

"I wish her all the happiness in her new relationship and her new life, but at this stage I want to cut myself off and insulate myself from that."

Khan and his former wife share custody of their sons, Sulaiman, 7, and Qasim, 5.
