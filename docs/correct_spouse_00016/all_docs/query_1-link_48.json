        "text": "Published in the Daily Express May 16th 1995\n\nOnce upon a time, I actually played cricket against Imran Khan. He was possibly the\n\nwisest bowler ever to demolish my middle stump. I swear he could make balls swing\n\nin three separate directions at the same time. But not even Imran Khan can defy the\n\nlaws of matrimonial gravity.\n\nI fear his proposal to marry Jemima Goldsmith is the silliest since Prince Charles\n\nwooed Diana. It can’t work; it won’t work and if his best friend hasn’t told him, I will.\n\nStrictly speaking, the comparison with Charles and Diana is not accurate because at\n\nleast the Wales’s came from the same broad background. Their insurmountable\n\ndifferences did NOT include race, first language, country and creed.\n\nBut the same cancer agents that dashed the Charles and Diana marriage are ready\n\nto undermine prospects for the Khans. I’m sorry to say it but research shows that\n\npeople like Jemima and Diana who settle down young are unlikely to stay happily\n\nmarried for much more than five years.\n\nMoreover, just as with our royals, the difference in age and outlook can prove utterly\n\nfatal once the honeymoon enthusiasm is over.\n\nALL research into love and attraction, literally hundreds of studies, is agreed on one\n\npoint. The myth that “opposites attract” and give a lasting platform to a relationship is total\n\nbunk! If you want a recipe for enduring happiness summed up in a single word it is –\n\n“similarity”.\n\nOver 99 per cent of successfully married couples are of the same race and mostly of\n\nthe same religion, same education, sociological class, intelligence, and even physical\n\ncharacteristics like body shape. Even couples who date regularly are found to share\n\nthe same political values, views on sex and sexual roles.\n\nCouples who are the most similar at the outset of their relationship are in fact the\n\nmost likely to stay together in the long run. Married couples who experience the least\n\nmarital conflict are also those who have similar personalities and enjoy doing the\n\nsame things and watching the same tv programmes.\n\nI defy anyone to suggest that the future Mr and Mrs K have the natural ingredients for\n\nthis sort of companionable, compatible relationship.\n\nIf I’m stating things brutally this is because I’d rather cause offence now than see two\n\nlives condemned to misery, not to mention the difficulties facing any future children.\n\nIt’s not of course remotely surprising that Jemima has fallen for her Prince of the\n\nCricket Pitch, this swan among ducks. My own partner has languished over him for years.\n\nBut studies in America suggest Jemima’s probably suffering from what’s called the “Distorting\n\nMirror Effect”.\n\nTests show that when we first fall in love – that crazy state of half-mad obsession, we\n\ncannot appreciate any of the faults of the object of our passion. I believe Ms\n\nGoldsmith is suffering from a bad case of “rose-coloured spectacles”.\n\nHand-in-hand with this inability to use our judgement goes something called “best\n\nbehaviour syndrome”.\n\nWhat the future Mrs Haiqa Khan is seeing from her Imran now is the most loving and\n\nkindly treatment she can ever reasonably expect to get.\n\nI’m not suggesting that the former Captain of Pakistan is some sort of Ferdinand\n\nLopez figure who in the novel by Anthony Trollope marries for cash, using honeyed\n\nwords and fond glances before the ceremony only to present his wife with a bunch of\n\ninvoices soon afterwards.\n\nBut I AM saying that a Moslem male of 42 whose driving ambitions are fund-raising\n\nand politics is not going to spend much time seeking his young wife’s opinion on the\n\ndisposal of the family fortune, nor sit around wasting precious hours pondering the\n\nmeaning of her life.\n\nHe already knows! Middle-aged men, especially bachelors, are also set in their\n\nways. Increasingly, they come to resemble their fathers. Without noticing it, they\n\ntend to revert to the orthodoxies of childhood.\n\nWhat Jemima Goldsmith is proposing to marry, I believe, is the Imran Khan who\n\nthinks men should make decisions while women broadly make cakes and babies.\n\nWhat’s in this proposed transaction for him? He gets a nubile and beautiful young\n\nwoman, the prospect of children and perhaps access to considerable wealth.\n\nAnd for her? She “pulls” the media’s Number One bachelor, gets world-wide fuss\n\nand attention and perhaps lets her parents know she really can move and shake on\n\nthe big stage.\n\nWho knows how difficult it’s been growing up in the shadow of Sir James Goldsmith\n\nhimself? Has a younger daughter ever found it easy to get his attention and respect?\n\nWould it make short-term sense for her to seek qualities in a future mate identical to\n\nthose of her famous father?\n\nOminously, both Sir James and the Pathan Prince have a reputation as international\n\nplayboys with an awesome appetite for competition fed by individual arrogance.\n\nI’d be so much happier if Jemima simply did what people in love should always do –\n\nhave a corking good affair but take absolutely no major life decisions on the basis of\n\nsuch temporary feelings.\n\nResearch even indicates she’d probably be better off plumping for an ARRANGED\n\nmarriage bBut only with someone from her own background!\n\nFor these reasons I hope and pray the parties will think again."
