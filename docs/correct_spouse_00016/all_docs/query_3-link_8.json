        "text": "While Imran Khan's former wife, Jemima Goldsmith, did not speak up about the initial arrest, her pro-Imran tweet, after the Supreme Court declared the manner of his arrest illegal, is now doing the rounds. Pakistanis have always \"rooted for\" the producer and the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, with little effort placed on hiding the fact that they continue to mourn the separation.\n\nThus, when Jemima tweeted, \"Finally sense has prevailed,\" attaching a screenshot of the news, Pakistanis who are ever-ready to ship Imran and Jemima, saw this as an opportunity to appreciate the filmmaker and reminisce the days when she was the entire nation's sister-in-law.\n\nOne Twitter user drew a comparison between Jemima and Imran and Lily and Snape from Harry Potter. \"She's the 'always' to his 'after all this time,'\" they wrote.\n\n\"Imran Khan is a born winner,\" penned another user of the microblogging site. \"He's bound to win, God-willing. The only greatest loss of his life is her.\"\n\nAnother user called the former premier's ex the \"queen of our hearts.\"\n\n\"Jemima, the only true sister-in-law of the country,\" penned another user adamantly.\n\nOne user romanticised the two. \"Be my Imran, I’ll be your Jemima,\" they wrote.\n\nSome even questioned their leader's decision to end his first marriage. \"Why [did] Imran Khan [leave] this faithful lady? they asked.\n\n\"The only woman who loves Khan unconditionally,\" penned another Twitter user.\n\nOne user posted a rather extreme statement. \"It’s better to leave this world than to leave a wife like this, Imran Khan left the love of his life for us. For Pakistan,\" they penned.\n\nOne user made light of the entire arrest situation. \"Imran Khan gets in trouble every time just to check if Jemima still cares,\" they joked.\n\nJemima's popularity among Pakistanis can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, her marriage to Imran, who is widely admired in Pakistan as a cricket legend and a prominent political figure, contributed to her visibility and acceptance within the country. Jemima's association with her former husband helped foster positive sentiments towards her.\n\nSecondly, Jemima actively engaged with various charitable and philanthropic initiatives in Pakistan. She demonstrated a genuine interest in the welfare of the Pakistani people and worked on projects related to education, healthcare, and social development. Her dedication to these causes resonated with many Pakistanis, who appreciated her efforts to improve the lives of underprivileged communities.\n\nAdditionally, Jemima's respectful approach towards Pakistani culture and traditions endeared her to the local population. Despite being from a different cultural background, she embraced the Pakistani way of life and immersed herself in the country's customs. This earned her the respect and admiration of Pakistanis who appreciated her willingness to embrace their culture."
