        "text": "Jemima Goldsmith net worth is\n\n$100 Million\n\nJemima Goldsmith Wiki Biography\n\nJemima Khan was born as Jemima Marcelle Goldsmith on 30 January 1974, in Westminster, London, England, to Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart of Anglo-Irish descent, and billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith, of German-Jewish descent. She is a British journalist and campaigner, but perhaps best known through her marriage to Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, and for her work for New Statesman and Vanity Fair magazines.\n\nSo just how wealthy is Jemima Khan? Sources state that Khan has acquired a wealth over $100 million, as of mid-2017, accumulated through inheritance from her father, as well as through her journalist career.\n\nJemima Khan Net Worth $100 million\n\nKhan grew up at Ormeley Lodge, along with her two siblings. She also has five paternal and three maternal half-siblings, as her parents were married to different people before she was born, but eventually married each other. She attended Londonâs Francis Holland School, and later enrolled at the University of Bristol to study English. However, she left school, although eventually obtaining her BA degree with upper second-class honors. She also attended the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, graduating with an MA in Middle Eastern Studies.\n\nIn her early 20s, she married Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan, settling in Lahore, Pakistan. While her husband pursued a career in politics, becoming the leader of the Pakistani Movement for Justice party (PTI) and later a member of parliament, Jemima focused on starting a fashion business by setting up a fashion label, the profits from which went to her husbandâs Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer hospital. However, due to an economic downturn, she closed the business in 2001. She later began writing articles for various newspapers, and earning a decent income.\n\nIn 1999, Khan was charged in Pakistan with illegally exporting hundreds of antique tiles of paramount archaeological interest. She denied the smuggling, stating that it was just a malicious campaign to damage her husbandâs political career. Still, she was forced to leave Pakistan and stay in London. When it was later proved that the tiles were not antiques, the charges were dropped and Khan returned to the country.\n\nHowever, in 2004 the couple divorced and Khan moved back to London. She began writing op-eds for various magazines, such as The Sunday Times, Observer, The Evening Standard and The Independent, including getting an exclusive interview with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in 2008 for the latter magazine. All contributed to her net worth.\n\nShe served as a columnist for Sunday Telegraph too, which added to her wealth, before in 2008 becoming a feature writer and a contributing editor for British Vogue magazine, holding the position until 2011. Her fortune grew larger. That year, she became the new European editor-at-large for Vanity Fair, while also serving as The Independentâs associate editor, further enhancing her wealth.\n\nIn 2011 she became as guest editor for the New Statesmanâs issue on freedom of speech, receiving high praise for her contribution, and later that year the magazine hired her as an associate editor. Her net worth was boosted again.\n\nKhan has also been involved in producing. She was trhe executive producer of the 2013 documentaries âWe Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaksâ and âUnmanned: Americaâs Drone Warsâ, as well as of the 2016 âUnmanned: Americaâs Drone Wars & Making A Killing: Guns, Greed and the NRAâ. She has also been a co-producer of the play âDrones, Baby, Dronesâ. In 2016 she founded the company called Instinct Productions, located in London. Khanâs involvement in the production business has been another source of her fortune.\n\nMeanwhile, she became involved in fashion again, modeling the relaunched Azzaro Couture fragrance, and serving as a guest co-designer of a Spring 2009 collection for Azzaro.\n\nIn her personal life, Khan was married to Imran Khan from 1995 to 2004; they have two children together. Following her divorce, she began dating actor Hugh Grant, their relationship lasting until 2007. She later dated activist and actor Russell Brand, but sources believe that she is currently single.\n\nKhan has been a devoted philanthropist, serving as an Ambassador for UNICEF UK. She has launched the Jemima Khan Afghan Refugee Appeal, providing help for Afghan refugees in Peshawar, and has visited Palestinian refugee camps in several countries in the Middle East. She has supported many charities through her Jemima Khan Foundation, and has also campaigned for a variety of social and political causes.\n\nï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿\n\nFull NameJemima GoldsmithNet Worth$100 MillionDate Of BirthJanuary 30, 1974Place Of BirthWestminster, London, EnglandHeight1.57 mProfessionJournalistEducationSOAS, University of London, Francis Holland School, University of Bristol, University of LondonNationalityEnglishSpouseImran Khan (m. 1995â2004)ChildrenSulaiman Isa Khan, Qasim KhanParentsJames Goldsmith, Lady Annabel GoldsmithSiblingsZac Goldsmith, Ben Goldsmith, India Jane Birley, Robin Birley, Alix Goldsmith, Isabel Goldsmith, Rupert Birley, Manes Goldsmith, Jethro Goldsmith, Charlotte GoldsmithTwitterhttps://twitter.com/jemima_khanIMDBhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm2083894/\n\nProducer\n\nTitleYearStatusCharacterUnmanned: America's Drone Wars2013Documentary co-executive producerWe Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks2013Documentary executive producer\n\nSelf\n\nTitleYearStatusCharacterUnmanned: America's Drone Wars2013DocumentaryHerself - Associate Editor, New StatesmanITV Morning News2006TV SeriesHerselfBreakfast2005TV SeriesHerself\n\nArchive Footage\n\nKnown for movies\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqOcpqGdlnqstMCnZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D"
