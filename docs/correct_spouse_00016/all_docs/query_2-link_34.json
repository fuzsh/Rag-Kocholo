        "text": "ANNA Eberstein welcomed her third child with Hugh Grant in March 2018 – just a couple of months before the pair tied the knot.\n\nBut where is she from and what does she do for a job? Here's all you need to know...\n\nWho is Anna Eberstein and what does she do?\n\nAnna Eberstein is a 41-year-old television producer and retail director from Sweden.\n\nShe has gained media attention due to her relationship with British actor Hugh Grant.\n\nAnna is the co-founder of Ace Slippers, a London-based Scandinavian sock company that specialises in traditional Swedish slipper socks.\n\nIt is not known how Hugh and Anna first crossed paths and found love.\n\nWhen did Hugh Grant marry Anna Eberstein?\n\nOn May 25, The Sun exclusively revealed that Anna and Hugh had tied the knot.\n\nThey swapped vows in a low-key ceremony at Chelsea register office near their £10million West London home.\n\nThe couple then posed for photos with family and friends — wearing their wedding rings for the first time.\n\nClad in a navy lounge suit and tie, dad-of-five Hugh chose an unusual gold ring set with three red gemstones.\n\nIt bore a striking resemblance to a comedy ring used in his 1994 screen hit Four Weddings.\n\nAnna shunned a traditional wedding dress in favour of a miniskirt and fitted blouse, but wore a classic gold band on her finger.\n\nAn onlooker said: \"It looked like a small affair, just a few friends and family.\"\n\nHow many children do Anna and Hugh Grant have?\n\nThe loved-up couple have three children together.\n\nAnna and Hugh welcomed their first child John Mungo Grant in September 2012.\n\nAnna then gave birth to a daughter - whose name remains unknown - in December 2015.\n\nIn March 2018, Hugh's ex-girlfriend Liz Hurley revealed that the couple had welcomed their third child.\n\nAppearing on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Liz was asked if she was surprised by the number of kids Hugh has had.\n\nShe replied: \"He had another one last week. He has five.\"\n\nThe television producer had debuted her pregnancy bump during a rare public appearance at the 2018 Golden Globe Awards.\n\nHer mother had reportedly told a Swedish publication: \"I'm very happy to be getting another grandchild. She's due rather soon.\"\n\nHugh also has two other children - Tabitha and Felix - with receptionist Tinglan Hong.\n\nHow old is Hugh Grant and what are his biggest movies?\n\nHugh Grant is a 60-year-old award-winning actor and film producer.\n\nHe was born in Hammersmith, London and, in 1979, he won the Galsworthy scholarship to New College, Oxford - where he starred in his first film, Privileged, produced by the Oxford University Film Foundation.\n\nHe is well-known for playing lead roles in comedies - especially British romcoms.\n\nSome of Hugh's most-loved movies include:"
