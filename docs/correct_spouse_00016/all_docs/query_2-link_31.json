        "text": "Hugh Grant was known as one of Hollywoodâs hottest bachelors for years, so many fans were surprised when he settled down with his wife, Anna Eberstein. Even the Notting Hill star himself was shocked when he fell in love with the Swedish film producer.\n\nâWell, I was wrong, I was just plain wrong,â he said of his bachelor days during an interview with Virgin Radio in February 2020. âAnd children, you know. I used to roll my eyes. People would say, âOh Hugh you donât understand it,â but they were right.â\n\nThe star sweetly revealed in a June 18, 2021 Twitter post that he married Anna for âlove.â It came about when a friend sent him a screenshot showing a Google search for âHugh Grantâs wife,â and the first story that popped up claimed âHugh Grant married Anna Eberstein for passport reasons.â He shared the screengrab on Twitter and simply wrote, âNo I didnât, @Internet. I married her because I love her.â\n\nThe Love Actually actor first met Anna around 2012, according to reports. In September of that year, Hugh and the retail director welcomed their first child together, son John.\n\nThroughout the next few years, Hugh and Anna expanded their family. The proud parents welcomed their second child when Anna gave birth to a daughter in March 2015, followed by another little one three years later in December 2018. However, both of their names have yet to be revealed as the couple are quite private.\n\nJust months before welcoming their third kiddo together, the Four Weddings and a Funeral actor â who also shares daughter Tabitha and son Felix with ex Tinglan Hong â and the brunette beauty tied the knot in May 2018. The twosome made their love official by registering their nuptials at an office near their home in London.\n\nNow that Hugh is a married man and loving father, he couldnât feel more grateful to have Anna by his side. âI should have done it before,â he told Today in 2018. âIâm just lucky. Iâve got a great wife. I love her.â\n\nEven though the Bridget Jonesâs Diary alum once thought the idea of marriage was ânonsense,â he finally came to his senses when he gave love with Anna a shot. âIt just seemed like a nice, cozy thing to do,â he explained.\n\nThe Golden Globe winner also told People TV that experiencing fatherhood has been the âthe nicest thing thatâs ever happenedâ to him. âItâs just lovely to have all that love around. Suddenly you love someone more than yourself,â he gushed in 2018. âItâs unheard of in my case and they love you and itâs all enchanting.â\n\nScroll through the gallery below to learn about Hughâs wife, Anna!\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6qcHGoWSgqpGjwbR51qKdnmWRo7uiecSbnKurpJq2r3nMnpytZaSdsm680aibrpuVp3w%3D"
