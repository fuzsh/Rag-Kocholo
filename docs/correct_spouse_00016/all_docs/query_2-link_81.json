        "text": "Hugh Grant and his wife Anna Eberstein enjoyed a rare date night together as they visited Loulou's in Mayfair on Thursday night.\n\nThe Love Actually star, 58, showed packed on the PDA with gorgeous Anna, as he gently patted her bottom as they made their way home after their night out.\n\nSwedish Anna put on a leggy display as she wore a black chequered mini dress and matching black and white wedges showing off her model figure.\n\nThe couple have been together for seven years and married last May in a small ceremony in Chelsea.\n\nAnna is a 40-year-old television producer and fashion retail director from Sweden. It is not known how they first found love but they have been going strong since they met in 2012.\n\nThey share three children together, along with two from Hugh's previous relationship with Tinglan Hong.\n\nHugh Grant was reluctant to marry after his split in 2000 from Elizabeth Hurley, who he still remains close friends with.\n\nHe told People Magazine back in 2015: \"I'm not really a believer in marriage. I've seen very few good examples, maybe five, in my life, but I think otherwise it's a recipe for mutual misery.\"\n\nHowever, Anna seems to have changed his mind."
