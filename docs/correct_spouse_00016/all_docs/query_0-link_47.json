        "text": "Documentary-maker Tim Samuels is famous for helping a group of pensioners have a hit single, but now he has managed to attract the attentions of someone a little more glamorous than The Zimmers.\n\nThe 32-year-old presenter of the BBCâ€™s Power to the People series has been spotted on two occasions recently enjoying an intimate lunch with Jemima Khan, ex-wife of Imran Khan, and ex-girlfriend of Hugh Grant.\n\nKhan, daughter of the late tycoon Sir James Goldsmith, converted to Islam before marrying Pakistan cricketer Khan. It looks like she is still Jewish enough for Tim, though."
