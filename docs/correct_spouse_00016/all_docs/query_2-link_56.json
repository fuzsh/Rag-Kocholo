        "text": "21 May 2018\n\nHe's been referred to as one of the UK's most eligible bachelors but Hollywood star Hugh Grant is finally tying the knot.\n\nThe Four Weddings and a Funeral and Paddington star is set to wed the mother of three of his children, Swedish TV producer, Anna Eberstein.\n\nA photograph of the wedding banns has been posted in several newspapers.\n\nGrant, 57, has five children in total, including two - Tabitha and Felix - with former partner Tinglan Hong.\n\nEberstein, 39, gave birth to her first child with Grant, a son, in 2012.\n\nThe couple then had a daughter, whose name has not been revealed, in December 2015.\n\nIn March this year, Grant's ex-girlfriend Liz Hurley revealed that Grant and Eberstein had recently welcomed a third child but the sex is unknown.\n\nGrant's previous girlfriends include Jemima Khan.\n\nHe was famously arrested in Los Angeles in June 1995 for lewd conduct with prostitute Divine Brown, and fined Â£800 after pleading no contest to the charge.\n\nPolice officers in an unmarked vehicle trailed the actor's car after spotting him picking up Brown in an area notorious for prostitutes.\n\nGrant later apologised for his \"insane\" act.\n\nThe actor has starred in films including Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Paddington 2.\n\nHe is also starring in the new BBC drama A Very English Scandal, playing disgraced MP Jeremy Thorpe.\n\nEarlier this year, Grant settled a phone-hacking damages claim against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) at the High Court.\n\nIt is understood the star will be paid a six-figure sum, which he will donate to the campaign group Hacked Off.\n\nThe actor said the newspaper group had been guilty of phone hacking on an \"industrial scale\" and called for another public inquiry to \"get to the truth\".\n\nMGN said it \"deeply regretted\" the acts and described them as \"morally wrong\"."
