        "text": "It looks like British heiress Jemima Khan is not dating Guy Ritchie. Khan was spotted out with her former (and current?) lover Hugh Grant. They went to dinner, and Hugh apparently tried to get her loaded. Yep, sounds right. I totally buy that Hugh Grant is the kind of date to try to get the girl drunk. That being said, I would still want to go on at least one date with him… weird, I know. The Telegraph has details about the latest in the Hugh Grant-Jemima Khan are-they or are-they-not together already saga:\n\nWhen Hugh Grant announced that he was separating from Jemima Khan in 2007 after a three-year relationship, his spokesman was keen to stress that the break-up was “amicable”. Since Mandrake disclosed last month that the pair had enjoyed a cosy meal at Bentley’s restaurant in Mayfair, their friendship seems to be regaining its old spark.\n\n…Last week, Grant, 48, took the daughter of the late tycoon Sir James Goldsmith out to celebrate her 35th birthday, which had been a few days earlier. The pair indulged in another intimate lunch Ã deux, this time at Olivomare, a fashionable Italian restaurant in Belgravia.\n\n“You would never guess that they had ever split up,” says a fellow diner. “Jemima looked radiant and very relaxed in his company. He seemed his usual diffident self, but kept pouring her wine and she kept laughing at his jokes.”\n\nDemurely, Jemima, who has two sons from her nine-year marriage to Imran Khan, the former Pakistan cricket captain, declines to comment. She and Grant have always avoided talking about their relationship, which once appeared to be going so well that there was speculation they would marry.\n\nThe actor, who remains best known for his role as a reluctant groom in Four Weddings and a Funeral, has never married.\n\n“I’d like to get married but I’m horrified by the lack of passion that can result from the passing of time,” he once remarked. “Nine out of 10 of my friends’ marriages are a f—— mess.” He has, however, also remained close to Elizabeth Hurley, with whom he had a 13-year relationship.\n\nFrom The Sunday Telegraph\n\nHugh gets a bad rap – most of it totally deserved. But I give him a lot of credit for maintaining a seemingly solid relationship with Liz Hurley, and even being one of many surrogate fathers for her son Damien. It wouldnât surprise me if he and Jemima Khan are back together, but theyâll probably split up again, and do the whole thing all over.\n\nI sometimes wonder if such âestablished bachelorsâ like Hugh Grant and George Clooney will ever marry. Maybe theyâre doing the honorable thing, not getting hitched – theyâre both pretty screwed up about women and commitment in general, maybe itâs best they just leave it to other people."
