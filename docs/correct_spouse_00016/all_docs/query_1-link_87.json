        "text": "A Pakistani court has jailed Imran Khan and his wife for seven years after voiding their marriage, in the latest sentence against the ex-prime minister.\n\nThe court ruled that Khan's 2018 marriage with Bushra Bibi, a faith healer, was un-Islamic and illegal.\n\nHe is already in jail for corruption. Last Wednesday, a week before a general election, the pair were convicted of profiting from state gifts.\n\nKhan, 71, has said the numerous cases against him are politically motivated.\n\nPakistan's former cricket captain-turned-politician was ousted as prime minister in 2022.\n\nA court was set up inside the Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan is serving his previous sentences, for the latest case.\n\nThe complaint was filed by Bibi's ex-husband, who said her marriage with Khan had been fraudulent.\n\nUnder Muslim family law, women are prohibited from remarrying for a few months after their husband dies or they are divorced. The court found that Bibi had remarried before the completion of the stipulated time following her divorce.\n\nAs well as the seven-year jail sentence, the court imposed a fine of 500,000 rupees ($1,800; Â£1,420) on Khan and Bibi.\n\nThe couple married in 2018, months before Khan was elected prime minister. Bibi, a spiritual healer believed to be in her 40s and who always wears a veil in public, is Khan's third wife.\n\nKhan had a playboy reputation in his cricketing years before he settled down to a society marriage with Jemima Goldsmith in 1995. The marriage lasted nine years and produced two sons.\n\nA second marriage in 2015, to journalist and former BBC weather presenter Reham Khan, lasted less than a year."
