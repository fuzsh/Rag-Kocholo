        "text": "Madonna and her husband, Guy Ritchie, renewed their wedding vows and are planning a second honeymoon this summer, Life & Style Weekly reported. Apparently the adoption of son David Banda of Africa has ignited their six-year-plus marriage. A source told the magazine: “David has brought a new joy to their lives and given them a spark. David has made Madonna realize how much she wants her family to stay a strong unit.”\n\nHugh Grant admitted he has not been invited to former girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley’s upcoming wedding. But Grant is not bummed out that Hurley, who will marry Indian businessman Arun Nayar in March, snubbed him and his girlfriend Jemima Khan. Grant told Hello! magazine, “It’s not surprising. I don’t think many people invite their ex when they get married so I’m not bitter at all.” Grant, 46, and Hurley split in 2000 after dating for more than a decade.\n\nHillary Clinton has an unusual backer – Marla Maples. The New York Post reports the former Mrs. Donald Trump sent a mass e-mail, urging friends to aid Clinton’s presidential run. Part of the e-mail: “(Clinton) is very clear, very focused, and I feel we will at last have a voice and be received with a welcoming and open ear.” The support might help Clinton with the Kabbalah crowd – Maples is a follower.\n\nMiss USA Tara Conner admits she used cocaine before she was admitted in a 31-day rehab treatment program. “Cocaine was one of the drugs that I did use,” said Conner, 21, who completed her treatment Jan. 21. “I was an equal-opportunity (user) – I would try anything once.” The Kentucky native, citing a family history, said alcohol was her greatest demon.\n\nCourtney Love told Us Magazine she was contacted by “American Idol” executive producer Nigel Lythgoe to appear on the show as a judge. “He was wondering if I was interested. I thought it was kind of weird but brilliant,” said Love, who didn’t elaborate if it was a one-time gig or a permanent replacement. “Idol” judge Paula Abdul has been involved in several strange incidents in the past few weeks. Then again, could it be any more bizarre than Courtney Love? Lythgoe is out of the country and unavailable for comment, his rep told the New York Post.\n\nThe Police plan a splashy reunion when they open the Grammy Awards on Feb. 11. Sting, guitarist Andy Summers and drummer Stewart Copeland will open the live CBS broadcast at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, a Grammys news release noted. The Police plan a world tour later this year to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the release of the band’s first single, “Roxanne.”\n\nSpeaking of music comebacks, Billy Joel is releasing his first pop single in 14 years. “All My Life” will be available on People magazine’s website Wednesday and can be downloaded from iTunes starting Feb. 20. The song is an anniversary present for his wife, Katie Lee Joel.\n\nKevin Nealon, below, had a good reason to miss that Boulder Theater gig last week. Nealon’s wife, actress Susan Yeagley, also shown, gave birth to their first child, son Gable Ness Nealon, on Monday, People magazine reported. The former “Saturday Night Live” regular, 53, married Yeagley, 35, in 2005. Nealon’s postponed Jan. 26 performance has been rescheduled for March 2."
