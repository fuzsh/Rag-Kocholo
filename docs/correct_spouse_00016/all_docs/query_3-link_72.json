        "text": "I first interviewed Imran a couple of years before he had even met Jemima, at his Chelsea bachelor pad. He told me how much he loved and missed his mother, whose jasmine bushes in Pakistan were such a vivid memory for him.\n\nHis favourite scent, he confided, was Fracas, an extremely expensive jasmine-based perfume which reminded him of home. He was devastated when his mother died of cancer after a difficult period of illness, and his first major political masterstroke was building a cancer hospital in Lahore in her name.\n\nWhen I met him there, I would marvel at the way he was mobbed like a rock star by everyone from nurses to patients and their families. He handled it all with grace and good manners – a style he developed over the years and has never lost.\n\nHe got together with Jemima, the daughter of one of the richest men in Europe and one of the most beautiful women the London scene. Like a tigress, as wily as she was ferociously bright, she was 22 to his 40 when they married.\n\nThe depth of their relationship then was clear, as was his political ambition. He was beginning to travel the country, to rally supporters, but back then victory seemed a long way off.\n\nBenazir Bhutto, his friend from Oxford, where he studied PPE, was still all-powerful. His own power was always going to come from the personal magnetism which had been so on show in those heady London days.\n\nAs he honed and developed his political muscle it was this charisma that has got him through the pain barrier of Pakistani politics. Today, he rides an armoured car through a land blighted by corruption.\n\n“I want to make sure the poor and the dispossessed, the widows and the vulnerable are taken care of”, he told me on that snowy day in Richmond. He was saying this decades ago and if he did not mean it, the people would know by now.\n\nI remember when I was in Pakistan, sitting and listening to him in the quiet of dusk on the balcony of their Islamabad home. He wanted to talk philosophy as much as politics, and liked this time when the day was turning into night.\n\nBy the time he was preparing for this last attempt to take power he recognised his time was coming.\n\n“People feel the other parties are bankrupt. The country has changed course, it is a failed state, there is alarm in Pakistan which is why my party has grown the way it has.”\n\nHis opponents may quibble about the broken down voting systems and who did what appalling thing to whom, but, for Imran Khan, going from cricketer-prince of the western world to prime minister of an Eastern empire has been a heroic journey.\n\nIt was a prediction he made a long time ago, when I first met the charming playboy, and I never would have believed it. But he put that charm to such good use and it has finally brought him the power he has wanted and awaited for so long."
