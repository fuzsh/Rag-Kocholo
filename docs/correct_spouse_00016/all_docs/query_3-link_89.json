        "text": "LONDON (Web Desk) - Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan's ex-wife and film producer, Jemima Goldsmith, has expressed her bliss over the Supreme Court's order to release the chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Imran Khan.\n\nThe PTI leader was arrested by Rangers personnel on the premises of the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday on the National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) warrant in the Al-Qadir Trust case.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court deemed Mr Khan's arrest legal, prompting the PTI to move the Supreme Court for his release. On Thursday, the top court declared Mr Khan's arrest \"illegal\" and ordered his immediate release.\n\nGoldsmith, who resides in the United Kingdom with her sons, tweeted her reaction to the SC order, saying, \"Finally sense has prevailed,\" along with a high-five emoji and the Pakistani flag.\n\nMr Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi and other PTI leaders are currently under investigation by the NAB in connection with a settlement between the PTI government and a property tycoon that allegedly caused a loss of 190 million pounds to the national exchequer.\n\nThey are also charged with adjusting Rs50 billion sent by Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the government and getting undue benefit in the form of over 458 kanal to establish Al-Qadir University. Mr Khan was arrested when he appeared for hearings on his bail petitions in other cases at the IHC."
