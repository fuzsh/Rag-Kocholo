        "text": "KARACHI: British rom-com ‘What’s Love Got To Do With It’ opens in Pakistani cinemas today, Friday, with the writer and co-producer of the film, Jemima Goldsmith, calling it a “rare achievement” for a film to bring together Pakistani, Indian and British musical and acting talent.\n\nStarring Lily James, Shazad Latif, Shabana Azmi, Emma Thompson and Sajal Aly, among others, the film is directed by award-winning Indian director Shekhar Kapur and focuses on an arranged marriage plotline. It released in the UK on Feb. 24. Before that, the film opened at the Red Sea Film Festival in Jeddah in December, with Aly, Azmi, and director Kapur in attendance.\n\nIn an interview to Arab News on Thursday night, Goldsmith, when asked about the “rare achievement” of making a film that mixed Pakistani and Indian actors and musicians, said the movie was “definitely a South Asian mix of talent, and British talent.”\n\n“Even the music is a collaboration,” she said during the Zoom interview, naming British DJ Naughty Boy, British-Indian composer Nitin Sawhney and Pakistani singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, who are all part of the film.\n\nSpeaking about the actors in the film, Goldsmith called it “an amazing treat” to work with Aly, one of the most popular soap stars in Pakistan.\n\n“I think she is a really talented actress. I think that she is a brilliant match for Lily James, who is the British female lead in the film who plays opposite her,” the film’s writer said. “And I wanted a Pakistani actress who’d be really easy for the British audience to see why a lead man falls in love with her, why he wants to marry her.”\n\nAly plays the role of the Pakistani girl the family of the male lead, played by Pakistan-British actor Latit, chooses for him to marry.\n\n“I asked around and she [Sajal Aly] was the person that was recommended and she was the only person we auditioned,” Goldsmith said. “And Shekhar [Kapur] fell in love with her and thought she was brilliant. And we all did, we all fell in love with her.”\n\n“When we cast Emma Thompson, we were thinking, who has the gravitas and the acting skills and the talent and the beauty to play opposite Emma Thompson, and it was just so obvious that it was Shabana Azmi,” Goldsmith added, referring to a veteran Indian actress known for both her work in Bollywood and independent and neorealist parallel productions.\n\nSpeaking about the plot of the film, Goldsmith said she chose the rom-com genre to speak about a serious topic like arranged marriage as a way to convey a “meaningful message … in a light-hearted way.”\n\n“Sometimes, it can be more impactful that way,” Goldsmith said.\n\nArranged marriages — where a couple is matched by family members — are common in South Asia. While it is different from forced marriage, many young people face intense pressure to wed and start a family shortly after reaching adulthood.\n\nBut Goldsmith said she wanted to use the film to redress Western judgments about Pakistan, and the practice of arranged marriages itself.\n\n“The message that I was trying to convey with this film was that Pakistan isn’t only the scary place you see on the news, it’s also colorful, and fun, and has beautiful music and beautiful food, and architecture and people,” she said.\n\n“And it is a vibrant, techni-color place. Not this kind of frightening black and white place we’re really used to seeing on our screens in the West.”\n\nIndeed, Goldsmith has had an insider’s view on Pakistan, where she lived between 1995 and 2004 when she was married to retired cricketer Imran Khan, who later went on to become the prime minister of Pakistan in 2018. The couple have two sons and remain on good terms.\n\nSo, would she ever use her “insider status” to make a film about Pakistan’s many political dramas and intrigues?\n\nGoldsmith laughed:\n\n“Definitely, not!”\n\nISLAMABAD: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party announced on Saturday its senior media manager had been “abducted,” adding the development was part of an ongoing crackdown against the party which had deteriorated the human rights situation in the country.\n\nPTI has been facing a crackdown for over a year after people carrying its flag indulged in violent protests and vandalized government buildings and military properties following Khan’s brief detention on corruption charges.\n\nSince then, several of its top leaders, including the ex-premier himself, have been incarcerated in different parts of the country and tried in a number of legal cases against them.\n\nThe recent development took place when the party’s international media coordinator was taken away from his residence, making his wife file an application in a court for his recovery.\n\n“My International Media Coordinator Ahmed Janjua and 3 other SM [social media] activists have been abducted early morning,” said Zulfi Bukhari, a senior PTI leader and close aide to the former prime minister, in a social media post. “In the past 2 weeks there has been a serious crackdown on PTI social media [team].”\n\nBukhari attributed it to the team’s international reporting of “all the atrocities” taking place in Pakistan.\n\n“This continuous deterioration of basic human rights won’t be allowed to continue for long,” he added.\n\nJanjua’s wife, Farhana Barlas, filed an application in the Islamabad High Court, requesting an immediate hearing. However, the court is likely to take up the case on Monday since the incident took place over the weekend.\n\nAccording to her application, 20 people in plain clothes forcibly entered the house at 4 AM on Saturday after breaking the door.\n\nThey took away Janjua’s laptop and cellphones before dragging him away.\n\nThe family tried to file a First Information Report (FIR) with the police, but it was not registered by the relevant officials.\n\nJanjua’s wife said her husband had been taken away due to his affiliation with Khan’s political party.\n\nShe nominated the federal secretaries of the defense and interior ministries as the respondents, along with the inspector general of police and the station house officer of the local police precinct.\n\nISLAMABAD: A key coalition ally of the Pakistan government on Saturday distanced itself from the decision to ban jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party for its alleged involvement in anti-state activities, saying it would not become part of such an “undemocratic move.”\n\nFederal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar announced the government’s plan earlier this week to ban Khan’s party, just days after the Supreme Court handed PTI a major legal victory by declaring it eligible for reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial assemblies.\n\nTarar justified the decision on the basis of “available evidence,” saying the ex-PM’s party was guilty of inciting violent protests last year, which made its followers set government buildings on fire, along with publicizing state secrets.\n\nShortly after his announcement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition partners, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said they had not been taken into confidence.\n\nSubsequently, government representatives, including Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, held a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari, the PPP co-chairman, on Friday and told him about the decision to file treason charges against Khan and two senior PTI leaders, former President Arif Alvi and ex-Deputy National Assembly Speaker Qasim Suri.\n\n“We have clearly told Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s representatives our party would not become part of any undemocratic move like banning the PTI,” Sehar Kamran, a PPP lawmaker, told Arab News. “We are the government’s key coalition partners but we were not consulted on its decision to slap a ban on Imran Khan’s party.”\n\nKamran said the PPP would take the matter to its Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting for a final decision, though “one thing is for sure that we are not going to be part of any undemocratic, unconstitutional and illegal action of the government.”\n\nShe said it was not clear yet as to when her party’s CEC meeting would be called as the party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was out of the country.\n\n“The government should try to find out democratic and constitutional solutions to its problems,” she added.\n\nSharif’s another key coalition partner, MQM-P, also said they were not taken on board before the announcement of the government’s decision to ban PTI and file treason charges against Khan and other leaders.\n\n“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s party has not contacted us yet for consultation on their decision to ban PTI and file treason charges against the party’s leadership,” an MQM-P media cell official told Arab News on condition of anonymity.\n\n“We will discuss the matter in our party before making the final decision whether we should stand by the government or not,” he continued. “It is too early to say anything about it. Let’s wait for the government to share its plans with us first.”\n\nArab News reached out to the information minister for comment but did not receive a response.\n\nKHAPLU, Gilgit-Baltistan: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday appreciated Pakistani women for providing valuable services in every field while holding a meeting with the globally acclaimed high-altitude climber Naila Kiani, who highlighted a lack of training facilities for mountaineers in the country.\n\nKiani, who garnered attention for being one of the few Pakistani women to scale some of the world’s highest peaks, met the prime minister at his official residence in Islamabad.\n\nAmong her notable accomplishments, she has successfully summited Mount Everest and K2, the world’s highest and second-highest mountains, respectively. Her accomplishments have made her a significant figure in the mountaineering community, inspiring many with her determination and resilience.\n\n“The prime minister said providing facilities to the women in various sectors including information technology, education, professional training, sports and other sectors was part of the government’s top priorities,” said an official statement released by the PM Office after the meeting.\n\n“The prime minister congratulated Naila on becoming the first Pakistani woman to conquer 11 peaks, above 8,000 meters, calling it a proud moment for Pakistan,” it added.\n\nSpeaking to Arab News after the meeting, Kiani said she had presented proposals for specialized training and vocational education in the mountaineering sector.\n\n“I spoke to the PM about lack of any training facilities for mountaineers,” she said. “Pakistan doesn’t have a single internationally qualified mountaineer due to a lack of state-of-the-art mountaineering training institute.”\n\n“The PM instructed his team to set up a committee immediately and start working on the establishment of a mountaineering school,” she continued. “I am also chairing a sub-committee, and the team will visit Skardu next week for official meetings and to visit the potential site for the school.”\n\nKiani said the proposed training facility would also help facilitate high-altitude climbers from abroad.\n\n“The lack of training leads to so many issues for western climbers who take Pakistani high porters,” she informed. “They prefer Sherpas [from Nepal] instead. Establishing this school will not only enhance skills of all high-altitude workers and climbers but also help flourish the region economically. We can attract a lot more foreign adventure tourists if we are more skilled.”\n\nHome to some of the tallest peaks and stunning landscapes, Pakistan attracts foreign climbers and tourists from around the world in every mountaineering season, making it a premier destination for adventure enthusiasts.\n\nQUETTA: Shan Raza, 58, was devastated last month upon learning that a separatist group had abducted his three sons, Rehan, Farhan and Hassan, along with two other relatives, in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province.\n\nSince then, Raza has been trying hard to bring a smile on the faces of his grandchildren, whom he finds wearing a dismal look since their fathers were taken away from Shaban, a tourist spot some 35 kilometers away from the provincial capital of Quetta.\n\nPakistan’s most impoverished Balochistan province shares its border with Iran and Afghanistan and has been the scene of a low-level insurgency for the last two decades. The separatists demand independence from Pakistan and seek control over provincial resources like gold and copper.\n\nThese groups have often targeted Pakistani forces and people from the Punjab province, the heartland of Pakistani military and political elite, in the restive southwestern region over what they say are enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings of Baloch men. Pakistan denies it.\n\nRaza’s sons, his nephew and a relative had gone to Shaban for picnic on June 19. They were among seven people abducted from the spot by the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).\n\n“My entire house is empty now, my family keeps asking me about the release of my abducted sons, but now we are in very gloomy conditions for the last thirty days,” Raza told Arab News this week.\n\n“The tears in the eyes of my wife and daughters-in-law are dried, they want nothing from me but the safe return of my sons.”\n\nRecalling the day when his sons left home for Shaban, the 58-year-old said they had initially planned to go to Peer Ghaib, another picnic spot in Balochistan’s mountainous Bolan district, but he didn’t allow them due to security concerns.\n\n“Then they told me that they were going to Shaban, but I didn’t know this place was not safe either,” Raza added.\n\nShortly after their abduction, the BLA offered the government to negotiate their release in exchange for BLA fighters incarcerated in Pakistani jails.\n\nThe group this month announced it would “implement punishments of the arrested suspects” after the government refused to negotiate their release, but there has since been no news of the hostages. The separatists accuse ethnic Punjabi settlers in Balochistan of spying for state agencies, though they have rarely offered any evidence to support their claim.\n\nBut Raza was hopeful that the government might be making efforts to secure the release of his sons and others. “I want nothing from them [Pakistani officials], but a safe recovery of my sons,” he said.\n\nShahid Rind, a spokesman for the Balochistan government, said the government and Pakistani security forces were making joint efforts to recover the abductees.\n\n“The chief minister met with the despondent families and apprised them of government efforts,” Rind told Arab News. “[But] the demand to release detained terrorists for a swap of Shaban abductees is unacceptable for the government of Balochistan.”\n\nRihan, the son of Raza’s abducted nephew Muhammad Raza, said his family was praying day and night for the release of his father. “My mother, sister and grandmother are very much depressed since my father was kidnapped,” the 13-year-old said.\n\nRaza said the wait for his sons and other abductees has been “excruciating.”\n\n“We run toward the door on every single knock and get alerted on every single call on our cell phones with hopes that my sons will return home,” the dejected father said, with teary eyes."
