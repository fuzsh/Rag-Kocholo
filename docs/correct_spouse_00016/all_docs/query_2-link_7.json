        "text": "The perfect match. Hugh Grant has offered rare glimpses at his marriage to Anna Eberstein over the years.\n\nBefore meeting Eberstein, Grant’s personal life made headlines when he dated Elizabeth Hurley from 1987 to 2000. He went on to welcome two kids with ex Tinglan Hong ahead of his romance with the Sweden native.\n\nThe Love Actually star previously discussed his lack of interest in marriage. “Do I think human beings are meant to be in 40-year-long monogamous, faithful relationships? No, no, no,” Grant told Howard Stern in 2016. “Whoever said they were? Only the Bible or something. No one ever said that was a good idea. I think there’s something unromantic about marriage. You’re closing yourself off.”\n\nAt the time, the London native admitted he could change his mind on the topic for the right person, saying, “I can see the lovely aspect if you marry exactly the right person — your best friend and it’s cozy and it’s lovely. But people make so many mistakes.”\n\nGrant went on to tie the knot with Eberstein in 2018 after they welcomed three kids together. “I still think it’s nonsense, really, and so does my wife, by the way,” the actor told Reuters in response to a question about marriage shortly after their nuptials. “But it just seemed like a nice, cozy thing to do.”\n\nThat same month, the Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves star revealed he had regrets about not getting married sooner.\n\n“You don’t think I’m too young?” Grant quipped during an appearance on the Today show. “No, it’s really nice. I can’t pretend it isn’t. I should have done it before! But I’m just lucky, I’m lucky. I’ve got a great wife. I love her, yeah.”\n\nGrant offered another look into their low-key relationship when he shared his wife’s thoughts on his past work.\n\n“I did drunkenly watch a bit of Love Actually a few months ago with my wife, and she was the one who said, ‘It’s all about pain. It’s all about suffering,’” he shared with Diane Sawyer during The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later special in November 2022.\n\nEberstein has continued to show support for her husband by often being by his side on red carpets and at industry events.\n\nScroll down to relive Grant and Eberstein’s relationship timeline over the years:"
