        "text": "As a Hollywood leading man, Hugh Grant had his share of romances before settling down. But the Bridget Jones’ Diary actor met his match in Swedish producer Anna Eberstein. The British star married Eberstein in 2018, and they have welcomed three children together.\n\nHere’s everything to know about Anna Eberstein, the woman who won Hugh Grant’s heart.\n\nWho is Anna Eberstein?\n\nEberstein lives in London, but she was born and raised in Sweden. She went on to study economics at Sweden’s Uppsala University, graduating with a master’s degree. She also spent time studying at Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee, making her education international.\n\nAfter school, Eberstein went on to have a career in television, working as a promotions producer for ESPN. She then expanded into business, co-founding a slipper-sock brand for kids called Ace & Me in 2014 with her cousin Pia Tamm Hagno.\n\nShe’s apparently not a fan of Grant’s best-known genre, romantic comedies. During an interview with Seth Meyers, Grant said, “My wife is the man in our house, really. She likes violent films, gangster films while I’m sitting there watching Roman Holiday or The Sound of Music or something. So, she’s never liked those films I did in the past, which are all romance and stuff. But now she’s starting to get a taste for [my work].”\n\nHow long have Eberstein and Grant been together?\n\nThe couple met at a party in London but seemed to be in an on-again-off-again relationship in the early 2010s. They had a child together in 2012, John Mungo. They then seemed to split. Grant had another child in 2013 with his ex-girlfriend Tinglan Hong, a son named Felix. This was his second child with Hong. They also share a daughter named Tabitha, who was born a year before John.\n\nGrant and Eberstein began to be seen together again in a seemingly romantic context in 2015, attending the French Open at Stade Roland Garros in Paris.\n\nIn 2016, Grant seemed to still be uninterested in marriage, telling Howard Stern in an interview, “Do I think human beings are meant to be in 40-year-long monogamous, faithful relationships? No, no, no. Whoever said they were? Only the Bible or something. No one ever said that was a good idea. I think there’s something unromantic about marriage. You’re closing yourself off.”\n\nBut he must have changed his mind, because they were wed in 2018 during a private ceremony at the Chelsea Register Office in London.\n\n“It’s really nice, I can’t pretend it isn’t,\" he told Savannah Guthrie on the Today show of his marriage. “I should have done it before. I’m just lucky. I’m lucky. I’ve got a great wife. I love her.”\n\nHe also told Reuters of his views of marriage, “I still think it’s nonsense, really, and so does my wife, by the way. But it just seemed like a nice, cozy thing to do.”\n\nHe has also responded to jokes and rumors about marrying his wife for passport reasons.\n\n“I married her because I love her,” he clarified.\n\nDo they have more children?\n\nIn addition to Grant's two children with Hong and their son John, the married couple welcomed a daughter in 2015 and a third baby in 2018. Those babies’ names have not been revealed.\n\nGrant told People in 2018 of fatherhood, “It was the nicest thing that’s ever happened to me... It’s just lovely to have all that love around. Suddenly you love someone more than yourself. It’s unheard of in my case. And they love you, and it’s all enchanting.”\n\nIn 2020, Grant was talking about his role in HBO’s The Undoing with co-star Nicole Kidman for Marie Claire and admitted how much he missed the kids while on set.\n\n“You had your family with you, which was, I think, very sensible,” Grant said. “I thought, ‘Oh, fantastic opportunity to get away from my screaming children.’ I left everyone in London. And then as soon as I got to New York each time I came out to film, I missed so much. It was, it was awful.”\n\nYou Might Also Like"
