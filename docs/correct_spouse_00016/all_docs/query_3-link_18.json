        "text": "To the west she is mad for giving up her rich lifestyle to become a Pakistani wife, meanwhile the Pakistanis say such a spoiled rich girl will never really cope as the serious and committed partner of a politician. She has struggled to prove everyone wrong.\n\nThis week her situation literally reached a knife-edge when it was feared she had become a ''soft western target'' for Islamic extremists. An intruder with a weapon broke into the London apartment she was sharing with her two\n\nchildren and only the presence of a bodyguard frightened the masked man off. The fact the stranger entered her Fulham flat with a key and seemed to know his way around has raised suspicions that Jemima was the target of a well-planned political raid.\n\nHer husband is currently in Pakistan on the campaign trail with the Movement for Justice Party that he founded in 1996. Although he believes he has a good chance of becoming Pakistan's prime minister, he is little respected by strict Islamists with puritan expectations. His playboy past and glamorous western wife only inflame the situation.\n\nMrs Khan, still recovering after the break-in, has told friends she thinks the intruder was either an Islamic extremist intending to intimidate her husband, or he was someone who'd planned to rape her. None the less, she remains in London, where she regularly holidays to escape the fierce heat of the Pakistani summers, with children Sulaiman, five, and Kasim, three.\n\nSince she, the stunning daughter of late billionaire businessman Sir James Goldsmith, married Imran Khan seven years ago commentators on both sides of the world predicted it would never last. Even when she changed her name to Jamila Haiq, became a Muslim, and learned to speak fluent Urdu, the union was viewed with scepticism.\n\nThe life of London parties and lunch with glamorous friends like Liz Hurley and Elle Macpherson seemed too good to give up, according to the press. And her husband's perceived coolness towards her in public and his penchant for leaving her for weeks on end while pursuing his political career was\n\nanother negative factor.\n\nHowever, seven years have passed and the couple they said would never stay together, have. But there is an obvious duality in her lifestyle. Where does the beautiful social butterfly begin and the serious political thinker end?\n\nCertainly, when she is with her husband at their Islamabad home she plunges into her social causes and takes on the daunting role of marshalling the women's vote and pushing for better education for young girls in remote rural areas. She is also a special representative for Unicef, campaigning hard to end neonatal tetanus in Bangladesh - an illness which kills thousands of mothers and babies annually.\n\nHer life in Pakistan is middle, not upper class, and certainly spartan compared with the luxurious existence she was born to. She has no cook or domestic staff, apart from a nanny and a bodyguard. There is no air conditioning, just a series of fans dotted through the four-bedroom home. Most days the rooms are crammed with political party\n\nworkers and her Pakistani in-laws whose respect she has worked hard to earn. Meanwhile, Imran believes it is vital they do not live or behave as VIPs and she abides by that. She remains vocal in the support of her husband and his\n\npolitical allies. In April she helped campaign for the ''yes'' vote for President Musharraf in his referendum over the extension of his rule for five more years.\n\nMore than 3000 supporters of her husband's political party applauded her as she addressed the rally at Peshawar in fluent Urdu. ''No change can be brought about without the participation of women,'' she said, as the crowd chanted deliriously ''Long Live Jemima.'' She is currently learning the language Pushtu which she says will aid her in her charity work with Afghan refugees in Peshawar.\n\nIf in her approach as nurse, fund-raiser, and mother figure of the poor there are echoes of Evita, Argentina's first lady who spoke for the descamisados, or shirtless ones, some analysts say it is not unintentional. And it is regularly pointed out that she still spends a lot of time in England, so where is her true commitment?\n\n''Am I supposed to feel guilty because I have a nice time with friends in London? she asked earlier this year. I find it amusing when I am called a party girl, because a lot of my life is grown-up and serious. I love discussing global politics, but I also like gossip and frivolity, too.''\n\nShe still braves the long journeys back to the UK despite being left with a fear of flying after an aircraft she was travelling on in 2000 almost crashed when a mentally-ill patient forced his way into the cockpit. ''Getting on a plane now is torture, she said. ''Most of all I fear the feeling of resignation to, and acceptance of, imminent death.''\n\nShe was born into a wealthy Jewish family in 1974, the oldest child of James and Lady Annabel Goldsmith, although not the first of her thrice-married father. Brought up in billionaire style at the best addresses in London, she attended the Francis\n\nHolland School, which was much more demanding than West Heath or Lillesden where her contemporaries were sent to learn domestic science.\n\nA headstrong teenager, staff at her household called her ''aggressive and difficult'' in contrast to her two gentler younger brothers. It was while studying at Bristol University that she met Imran Khan, a legendary cricketer who was twice her age and, after converting to Islam, married him in 1995. The Tamaras and Taras of her circle were slightly horrified that she would actually consider moving to Pakistan.\n\nHer flamboyant father, James, an unscrupulous bully to some and to\n\nothers a buccaneer who fought for what he wanted, died aged 63, leaving her bereft, but with a huge inheritance.\n\nJemima has said that her proud husband ''would rather die'' than touch any of her money, however, and they work hard to keep his political ambitions afloat. Friends say Jemima has matured into a thoughtful, kinder person since meeting Khan, but she still owns her father's determination to change the world. Luckily, she also seems to have taken on his thick skin.\n\nSince her controversial marriage she has encountered many setbacks. She was accused by a former Pakistani government led by Nawaz Sharif - who she says was hostile towards her husband - of smuggling precious antique tiles out of the country. Forensic evidence proved the tiles were modern and the case was dropped. Then an ill-judged article in Vanity Fair magazine hinted that her life in Pakistan was poverty-stricken and had Jemima bemoaning the lost luxuries of the west. But Mrs Khan has denied complaining to the journalist about her life or her home.\n\nHer own fashion venture, which she set up in Pakistan, was initially a success and aimed to highlight the embroidery skills of Punjabi women, but after September 11 and amid tensions between India and Pakistan the business was closed. Having inherited millions, she said the move did not affect her personally but that she minded deeply for the 800 poor Pakistani women who embroidered her line of clothes.\n\nLike the late Diana, Princess of Wales, to whom she has been compared, when she turns her mind to good causes her presence attracts huge support. On the Afghani refugee crisis, she wrote: ''I put my hand down to comfort a crying child sitting alone whose legs have been horribly deformed by polio. Her clothes are still wet from last night's rain. I am filled with shame.'' Her subsequent plea for donations raised $120,000 in a fortnight.\n\nShe is due to return to Pakistan, and her double life, with her children in September. However, like Diana, she cannot help but provoke a suspicion that behind her mask of breeding there is loneliness and vulnerability - something she vehemently denies.\n\nThose close to her have described her as ''frighteningly thin'' since the traumatic raid on her London flat. After years of skilfully walking a tightrope between two very different cultures this current tension could force her hand into deciding who she wants to be."
