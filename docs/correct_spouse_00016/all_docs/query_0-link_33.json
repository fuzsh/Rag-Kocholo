        "text": "Hugh Grant and his girlfriend Jemima Khan have parted. The couple, who began dating around three years ago, have \"decided to split amicably\", the actor's publicist, Robert Garlock, said last night.\n\nGrant, who has never married, is best known for playing foppish romantic leads in films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral. He had been seeing Khan, 33, since the break-up of her marriage to the former Pakistan cricket captain Imran Khan.\n\nNews of their split comes after they were reportedly seen arguing in public at Mrs Khan's 33rd birthday party at the George Restaurant in Mayfair.\n\nKhan was reportedly overheard joking about Grant's \"commitment phobia\". In response he said she was behaving like \"a dictator\".\n\nA friend of Khan's said: \"Both sides felt it was the natural end of the long relationship. Nobody else was involved on either side. As far as Jemima was concerned she never really felt the relationship would lead to marriage, although she was extremely fond of Hugh.\"\n\nHe said the relationship had been \"fairly rocky\" in recent weeks.\n\nA spokesman for the couple said: \"It is an entirely amicable split, but both regard it as a private matter and will not be making any further statements.\"\n\nKhan is the daughter of the late millionaire James Goldsmith.\n\nShe and Grant recently attended the premiere of Grant's new romantic comedy, Music and Lyrics, in which he plays a has-been 1980s pop star with a phobia of commitment. Grant looked morose in interviews to promote the film."
