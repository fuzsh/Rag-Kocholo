        "text": "Grant, 63, plays an Oompa-Loompa in the new film starring Timothée Chalamet, which hit cinemas on December 7.\n\nSo, who’s the woman who’s been supporting Grant at many of his recent events? Here’s everything we know:\n\nAnna Elisabet Eberstein is a TV producer from Sweden\n\nBorn and raised in Sweden, Anna Eberstein now lives with Grant in London, per People. The same source states that she has a master’s degree in economics from Sweden’s Uppsala University and studied at Lincoln Memorial University in Tennessee. Eberstein reportedly went on to work as a promotions producer for ESPN, before going freelance as a TV producer.\n\nShe co-founded a sock brand\n\nIn 2014, the entrepreneurial Swede also co-founded a children’s slipper sock brand called Ace & Me with her cousin, according to People, now better known as Ace Slippers.\n\nRetailing at about US$16 per pair, the eco friendly brand describes its designs as “traditional Swedish moccasin slipper-socks” with “an edgier design” that are handmade and home-grown.\n\nShe’s not into his films at all\n\nEberstein doesn’t seem to be into romcoms as much as her husband is, according to one of Grant’s previous interviews.\n\n“My wife is the man in our house, really. She likes violent films, gangster films while I’m sitting there watching Roman Holiday or The Sound of Music or something,” he said per ET. “So she’s never liked those films I did in the past, which are all romance and stuff. But now she’s starting to get a taste for [my work].”\n\nHow did Hugh Grant and Anna Elisabet Eberstein meet?\n\nAs reported by Parade, the Love Actually actor met his future wife at a party in London. Eberstein is Grant’s first and only wife.\n\nBack in 2016, Grant gave his opinion about marriage on The Howard Stern Show, saying, “Do I think human beings are meant to be in 40-year-long monogamous, faithful relationships? No, no. Whoever said they were? Only the Bible or something. No one ever said that was a good idea.” He added, “I think there’s something unromantic about marriage. You’re closing yourself off.”\n\nHowever, he did continue, “I can see the lovely aspect if you marry exactly the right person – your best friend – and it’s cosy and it’s lovely, but people make so many mistakes.” It seems like he found “exactly the right person” in Eberstein then!\n\nThe pair have since attended numerous high-profile events together, from the Formula One Grand Prix in Italy last year, to King Charles and Queen Camilla’s state dinner in September.\n\nWhat is the age difference between Hugh Grant and his wife?\n\nThe couple appears to have a 23-year age gap. Per British media, Hugh Grant is currently 63 and Eberstein is thought to be around 40-years-old.\n\nHow many children does Hugh Grant have with his wife Anna Eberstein?\n\nThe Bridget Jones alum shares three kids with Anna Eberstein. Per People, they welcomed a son named John Mungo in 2012; had a daughter in 2015; and their third baby was born in 2018.\n\nGrant has another child, Tabitha Xiao Xi Grant, born in 2011, with his ex, a Chinese waitress named Tinglan Hong.\n\nBack in the 80s and 90s, the Notting Hill star was in a widely publicised relationship with Elizabeth Hurley. The former “It” couple dated from 1987 to 2000, but have remained close despite Grant’s controversial cheating scandal with LA sex worker Divine Brown at the time."
