        "text": "WATCH out ladies - because heart-throb Hugh Grant is single again.\n\nYes, love has actually crumbled once more for the stuttering one - leaving the rest of the world wondering exactly why Hugh cannot hang on to his women.\n\nThe 46-year-old star and mum-of-two Jemima, 33, gave no reason for the break-up after three turbulent years together.\n\nBut it follows public rows over Hugh's roving eye and close relationship with his ex Liz Hurley. Ironically, Hugh never felt able to settle down with Liz, despite a 13-year relationship\n\nThe actor's publicist Robert Garlock last night confirmed his relationship with Jemima was over. He said: \"Hugh and Jemima have decided to split amicably.\"\n\nThe couple have also been plagued by arguments about Hugh's reluctance to commit himself to a long-term relationship.\n\nJemima was keen to establish a settled family life for her and her two young sons from her marriage to cricket legend Imran Khan.\n\nShe and Hugh bought an #18million home in Chelsea, West London, but marriage proposals never came. This month, the couple had a spat over his flirting at the premiere party of his film Music and Lyrics.\n\nJemima told a friend: \"He's ignoring me. He's got lots of other women on his arm tonight.\n\n\"I knew this would happen. I'm used to it now.\"\n\nHugh was overheard saying: \"I can't kiss any more women, I've already had a row with Jemima.\"\n\nMind you, that didn't stop him wandering up to several women at Floridita, in London's Soho, and saying: \"You're simply gorgeous, aren't you?\" At her birthday party in January, Jemima joked with a guest about Hugh's reluctance to commit.\n\nHe responded by branding her \"a nag\" and \"a dictator\".\n\nWeeks earlier, the couple were seen having a slanging match on Sunset Boulevard - the Los Angeles street where Hugh was infamously caught in a car with hooker Divine Brown.\n\nHugh began dating Jemima four years after splitting from Liz.\n\nRelations between the two women have always been frosty.\n\nBut they reached an all-time low two years ago after Liz seductively sucked Hugh's finger at a ball thrown by Elton John.\n\nJemima and Hugh did not receive an invite to Hurley's forthcoming wedding to businessman Arun Nayer.\n\nHugh recently confessed that his screen image as romantic comedy hero was a long way from real life. He said: \"I am really not the romantic sort.\n\n\"Maybe deep inside there is a little romance lingering but I cannot think of a single thing I have ever done which could be construed as romantic.\n\n\"Even if I could, however, I wouldn't divulge it as the whole thing makes me cringe.\""
