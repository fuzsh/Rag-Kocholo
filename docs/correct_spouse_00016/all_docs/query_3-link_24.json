It’s almost like I’m back in 90s Lahore.”\n\nMs Goldsmith also tweeted that she has been dealing with a stalker who was “arrested at my work place last week and another who breached his restraining order and is being tried in a few weeks”.\n\nThe mother-of-three has not made any statements regarding her former husband was ousted from Pakistan’s government, but her brothers Zac Goldsmith, a UK government minister, and Ben Goldsmith have expressed support for Mr Khan.\n\nSurrey Police confirmed oficers were stationed outside Ms Goldsmith’s mother’s home during the protest but no arrests were made.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said it attended Ms Goldsmith’s house in Richmond, southwest London, but made no arrests."
