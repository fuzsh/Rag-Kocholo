        "text": "IT TOOK A marriage to Pakistan cricket royalty Imran Khan to inspire her new romantic comedy What’s Love Got to Do With It? — yet film producer and screen writer Jemima Khan says arranged marriages aren’t all doom and gloom.\n\nKhan’s marriage to Imran at the age of 21 in 1995 wasn’t an arranged one, but living in Pakistan for close to 10 years while married to the now former Prime Minister — with whom she has two sons — opened her eyes to a world of arranged settings and helped plant the seed for this script.\n\nSince her marriage to Khan ended, she has dated everyone from Hugh Grant (who she was engaged to in 2004 to 2007) to comedian Russell Brand, and says if she knew then what she knew now, she’d be less hesitant to shun the arranged world of finding a love match.\n\n“Majority of the arranged marriages I saw in Pakistan were long lasting and genuinely developed into what I saw as genuine love,” says Jemima Khan.\n\n“I became interested in this reverse concept of simmer then boil, walking into love and not falling into love,” she says of her script inspiration.\n\n“When I came back to the UK, after being in Pakistan, I was 30 and some of my friends in their mid 30s were looking for someone to have children with and wanted to either get married and have kids or both. When they struggled to find suitable candidates for the role, it started as a joke between us, that I would help them find someone because in Pakistan I helped arrange a few marriages there,” Khan says.\n\nLiving with her ex-husband’s family meant Khan had to observe their segregated ways of life. Men in one area of the home and women in the other.\n\n“Iman and I were the only love marriage in the family’s history – there may have been one other, but ours was the only divorce,” Khan says.\n\n“During my time in Lahore, I lived with Imran’s niece Hadra and an entire extended family for the first five years. I lived with his sisters and their husbands and his father. Hadra was 13 when I first went to Pakistan and I saw her enter an arranged marriage aged 20,” she says.\n\n“One of the lines in my film comes directly from her. It’s where her mother says to her ‘I want you to choose’ — referring to a future husband. Hadra said to me; ‘I don’t want to choose between two. Why don’t you choose for me, so I have someone to blame if it doesn’t work out,” Khan says.\n\nThe 49-year-old also hopes the new film will show a softer side to Pakistan, tugging at heart strings over a stereotype the West often portray.\n\n“I think that is one of the big laments for me when I was living in Pakistan is why do we always have to be seen as terrorists,” she questions.\n\n“Why is Muslim representation on screen in the West always about violence. Why can’t it be about normal loving families with their own issues which all families have. I was clear there were no terrorists in our film.”\n\nMost of the stories I tell have RESONATED with me personally and to a LESSER or GREATER EXTEND are TRUE\n\nThe film took 10 years to write, produce and get film ready. Khan is also working on other documentaries and films including one about her good friend Monica Lewinsky.\n\n“From Impeachment, the Monica Lewinsky story and the Clinton Affair, to the documentary series The Case Against Adnan Syed, about a Pakistani Muslim kid who was the same age as one of my sons when he was sentenced and I started working on it. Most of the stories I tell have resonated with me personally and to a lesser or greater extent are true,” Khan says.\n\n“The Monica Lewinsky story had been told from a totally different perspective for so long and telling it from the point of view of the women, was interesting to me,” she says. “I saw to what extent the impact of that era had on one individual and Monica was ready to reframe that reclaim her version of that narrative,” Khan says.\n\nRunning Instinct Productions has become a full-time gig since 2015; prior to that Khan worked as a political and culture reporter for various publications including Vanity Fair. She also worked as the associate editor of the New Statesman and held a contributing editor role with British Vogue until 2011.\n\nWith her sons now in their 20s, she has more time to focus on her business.\n\n“My children always saw me working,” says Khan who finished her degree at the University of Bristol in 2002 and acquired a Masters in Middle Eastern Studies at the University of London thereafter.\n\n“When we lived in Pakistan, they were nine and seven years old, and when we came back to England I wrote from home, I am not I am the kind of person who is good with nothing to do,” she says.\n\n“They don’t need me day to day anymore and have both been to university. I don’t find that balance difficult as much now as a mother. If anything, I use work to distract me from the loss of my children from living with them all the time and being fully in my life.”"
