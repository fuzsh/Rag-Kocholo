Since Mandrake disclosed last month that the pair had enjoyed a cosy meal at Bentley's restaurant in Mayfair, their friendship seems to be regaining its old spark.",

        "text": "I hear that last week, Grant, 48, took the daughter of the late tycoon Sir James Goldsmith out to celebrate her 35th birthday, which had been a few days earlier. The pair indulged in another intimate lunch Ã  deux, this time at Olivomare, a fashionable Italian restaurant in Belgravia.\n\n\"You would never guess that they had ever split up,\" says a fellow diner. \"Jemima looked radiant and very relaxed in his company. He seemed his usual diffident self, but kept pouring her wine and she kept laughing at his jokes.\"\n\nDemurely, Jemima, who has two sons from her nine-year marriage to Imran Khan, the former Pakistan cricket captain, declines to comment. She and Grant have always avoided talking about their relationship, which once appeared to be going so well that there was speculation they would marry.\n\nThe actor, who remains best known for his role as a reluctant groom in Four Weddings and a Funeral, has never married."
