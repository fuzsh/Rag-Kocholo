        "text": "Hugh Grant's wife, Anna Eberstein, is the first and only woman he has married. The English actor used to be skeptical about tying the knot, but he is enthusiastic about their relationship and children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHugh Grant, born on September 9, 1960, in Hammersmith, London, England, U.K., is a seasoned actor with acclaim for his charming personality and sharp wit. His ability to keep his cool in the face of intense media attention has won him widespread praise.\n\nThe roles he played in romantic-comedy films in the 1990s and early 2000s, such as \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" \"Notting Hill,\" and \"Music and Lyrics,\" brought him the most fame. Along with his career, his marriage to Anna Eberstien is flourishing.\n\nHugh Grant and his wife Anna Eberstein at the 25th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on January 27, 2019, in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nWho Is Anna Eberstein?\n\nIn 2014, Anna and her cousin Pia Tamm Hagnö established the Swedish slipper sock company Ace&Me, where Anna serves as the company's director. Before she and her cousin founded their company, she once worked in the show business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Anna worked as a freelance creative producer specializing in marketing and corporate campaigns, as well as on-air commercials and promotions.\n\nShe also worked for ESPN, rising through the ranks from on-air promotions coordinator to promotions producer. In her line of work, she produced and developed content for the cable sports company.\n\nAnna Eberstein and her husband Hugh Grant at the 70th EE British Academy Film Awards on February 12, 2017, in London, England. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAnna's extensive educational background has been impressive. She earned a master's degree in economics in 2003 from Uppsala University in Sweden, where she studied for four years.\n\nShe received a tennis scholarship and competed in the sport from 2001 to 2002 at Lincoln Memorial University. From 1988 to 1999, she studied English literature and political science at Oxford Brookes University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHugh Grant and Anna Elisabet Eberstein at the 70th EE British Academy Film Awards in 2017, in London, England | Source: Getty Images\n\nWhere Did Hugh Grant and Anna Eberstein First Meet?\n\nAccording to Mirror, Hugh first met Anna at a party in London. Reportedly, the handsome actor \"bowled over\" the Swedish TV executive and even escorted her off on numerous dates after winning her over with his charm.\n\nHugh once mentioned he had no interest in settling down with only one partner; it seems that he has already found Anna, who would become his longtime partner. They have kept their romance under the radar.\n\nDespite keeping their relationship hidden, the couple became parents for the first time in September 2012, when the former ESPN producer gave birth to their son, John Mungo Grant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHugh became a parent again not long after John was born, but this time, the child was from a different woman. He welcomed his son Felix Chang Hong Grant in December 2012 from a Chinese woman, Tinglan Hong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFelix, apparently, is Hugh and Tinglan's second child. The duo welcomed their first child, daughter Tabitha Xaoi Xi Hong Grant, in December 2011. Hugh's relationship status with both women was unclear at that time.\n\nAnna Eberstein and her husband Hugh Grant at the 23rd Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on January 29, 2017, in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nHugh and Anna separated in 2013. Despite their split, they continued to live close to each other in London, with the actor claiming that they are still good friends and that she is a good mother.\n\nAfter some time had passed, Hugh finally came to terms with his new role as a parent. In 2018, actress Elizabeth Hurley inadvertently revealed in a TV interview that Hugh, her ex-boyfriend, is now a \"father of five.\"\n\nAnna Eberstein and Hugh Grant at the EE British Academy Film Awards 2020 on February 2, 2020, in London, England. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Did Hugh Grant and Anna Eberstein Get Married?\n\nHugh was critical of the idea of marriage. In 2016, he shared his marriage views to SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern that individuals were not meant to be in a \"monogamous, faithful relationship.\"\n\nThe acclaimed actor, who had a history of high-profile romances, told Stern that casual affairs are the \"key to a lasting relationship.\" But circumstances soon changed for Hugh.\n\nHugh no longer appears to be a skeptic about marriage.\n\nAnna Eberstein and her husband Hugh Grant attend London Film Critics' Circle Awards 2018 on January 28, 2018, in London, England. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the English bachelor, at 57, married Anna in a low-key ceremony in Chelsea, London, in May 2018. The event was simple, and only a few people were present to witness it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough most of Hugh's fans supported his unexpected wedding to his longtime partner, some claimed that the Golden Globe Award nominee only married Anna for \"passport reasons.\"\n\nThis claim came after USA Today reported in June 2018 that the dashing actor disliked going through immigration lines in foreign countries because it meant being separated from his Swedish wife.\n\nFollowing the issue, Hugh responded on Twitter in June 2021 about the real reason why he married Anna. He uploaded a photo of a top Google search where he encircled its result along with his tweet:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"No I didn't, @Internet. I married her because I love her.\"\n\nHugh no longer appears to be a skeptic about marriage. Just a month after marrying Anna, Hugh told TV host Samantha Guthrie that married life has been nice.\n\nHow Many Kids Do Hugh Grant and Anna Eberstein Have?\n\nHugh and Anna have three children; their eldest child, John, and their two kids, reportedly born in December 2015 and in March 2018. The couple never revealed the names of their two kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with his three children with Anna, Hugh is overjoyed to be the father of Francis and Tabitha Xaoi Xi, Tinglan's children. Having five kids, Hugh said in a January 2018 interview with Jesse Cagle on People TV that it was the \"nicest thing\" that happened to him.\n\nHugh Grant also gushed about the overwhelming love he felt after becoming a father. He said he has good relationships with the mothers of his children. Hugh shared to host Ellen Degeneres in 2012 that having kids changes one's perspective.\n\nHe said: \"Everyone was right all these years, saying, 'Hugh, why don't you have some children? It changes your life.' Now that I have a child, it is life-changing. I recommend it. Get some!\""
