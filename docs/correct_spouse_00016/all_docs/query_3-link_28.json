        "text": "Job: celebrity tweeter; associate editor, the Independent\n\nAge: 37\n\nIndustry: activist\n\nSalary: unknown – reportedly inherited about £300m from her late father's £1.2bn fortune after his death in 1997\n\nNew entry\n\nNew Statesman readers were divided when the socialite, heiress and daughter of the late rightwing financier Sir James Goldsmith guest edited the staunchly leftwing title last April. Goodness knows what they make of her becoming an associate editor of the Independent in June.\n\nThere were no years on the locals or trade papers for this Bristol University alumna, but this was a year in which the judges thought she had become an influential figure on the media scene. Part of that was due to her success in rescuing the newly launched i – the television advertising campaign in which she featured helped lift sales of the 20p title. Subsequently her reward was a role at the Independent – as associate editor.\n\nShe followed the TV spots with a stint editing the New Statesman in April, interviewing deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and enlisting the writing skills of Russell Brand and Hugh Grant, who bugged the News of the World bugger.\n\nHer role as one of the earliest supporters of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, when she unexpectedly turned up at court to post part of his bail money, also merits her a place on the MediaGuardian 100.\n\nWhether her decision proves that she belongs, according to journalist Henry Porter, to a \"great tradition of grand lady radicals going back to the Whigs of the 18th century\", her influence is undoubted, as her (still rising) figure of 75,000 Twitter followers testifies.\n\nIn May she used the site to deny rumours suggesting she had taken out a gagging order preventing \"intimate photos\" of herself and Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson being published.\n\nJemima Marcelle Goldsmith first hit the headlines in 1995 when she was just 20 and married the 42-year-old Imran Khan a few weeks after meeting him on a night out with friends. They are now divorced but Khan, who lives in Fulham and in Oxfordshire with her sons, remains on friendly terms with her ex-husband.\n\nShe is a patron of the moderate Islamic thinktank the Quilliam Foundation."
