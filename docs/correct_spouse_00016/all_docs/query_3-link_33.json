        "text": "Bushra Khan, more commonly known as Bushra Bibi — a title that denotes respect in Urdu — may at a glance seem an odd match for Imran Khan; the former Pakistani prime minister, cricket captain and renowned playboy.\n\nMs Khan, in her late 40s, hails from Punjab, where her family are landowners. There, she married her first husband, Khawar Farid Maneka, a customs officer and the son of an influential Punjab family.\n\nThey remained married for nearly 30 years, but divorced in 2018. Speaking to local media following their divorce, her former husband said:\n\nThe mother of five, who is always seen in public wearing a veil and a burqa that shows only her eyes, has lived a life of spiritual devotion to Fariduddin Masud Ganjshakar, or Baba Farid, a revered Muslim mystic in the Sufi tradition.\n\nThose who admire her call her a spiritual leader; those who oppose her have accused her of sorcery.\n\nWhile she has denied these allegations, in a rare 2018 interview she told local media that \"people would come to see me to get closer to God and the Prophet\".\n\nThese are the alleged circumstances under which she met her second husband, Imran Khan.\n\nIt is unclear when or how the pair met, but one popular rumour places them meeting at a 13th-Century Sufi shrine, after Mr Khan turned to her for advice.\n\nIn the same 2018 interview Ms Khan dismissed the story, but said: \"Every moment of [Imran Khan's] life is now dedicated to God, the Prophet and the love for Baba Farid.\"\n\nThe two married in 2018, seven months before Mr Khan was elected prime minister, in a secret ceremony.\n\n\"I proposed to her without seeing her because she had never met me without her face being covered with a full veil.\"\n\nThe marriage was Mr Khan's third, after Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of business tycoon James Goldsmith, and TV journalist Reham Nayyar Khan, both of which ended in divorce.\n\nBushra Bibi did not accompany her husband on any official overseas trips during his time in office, except for visits to Saudi Arabia, where they were filmed at the holy Muslim cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nLoading...\n\nAccused of marrying too soon\n\nNow, a Pakistan court has sentenced both Imran and Bushra Khan to serve seven years, and pay a fine, after a ruling that their 2018 marriage violated the law.\n\nBushra Bibi was accused of not completing the three-month waiting period mandated by Islam, called \"Iddat\", after divorcing her previous husband before marrying Mr Khan.\n\nThe Khans signed their marriage contract, called a Nikkah, in January 2018, though there was controversy over whether they had wed before the period was complete.\n\nIt was Ms Khan's ex-husband, Khawar Maneka, to whom she was married for about 30 years, who brought a criminal complaint against the Khans, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe Khans both denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSamina Yasmeen, director of the University of WA's Centre for Muslim States and Societies, said Iddat was intended to be a three-month period during which couples could reconcile.\n\nThere was some confusion around the dates of Ms Khan's divorce and her wedding to Mr Khan, she said.\n\n\"What's also confusing, at least from my point of view, is that her former husband didn't raise the issue when she got married [again],\" she said.\n\n\"It was only early last year that he filed a case.\"\n\nProfessor Yasmeen said the case being prosecuted so soon before the election on February 8 indicated the authorities were attempting to trash Mr Khan's reputation for honesty.\n\n\"So I would say, whatever the merits of the case the timing actually suggests that there's a political intent behind it. And that intent in my view is undermining Imran Khan's claimed authentic self as a good Muslim.\"\n\nLawyers and human rights activists have condemned the case, but Professor Yasmeen said the reaction in Pakistan had largely been resignation — even among Mr Khan's supporters.\n\nWith Mr Khan already facing more than 20 years in jail \"no-one is even reacting to this one\".\n\nThe embattled former prime minister is in prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, while his wife has been allowed to serve her sentence at their hilltop mansion in Islamabad.\n\nHe already faces a 10-year disqualification from holding public office.\n\nMr Khan also been sentenced to 10 years for leaking state secrets and 14 years along with this wife for illegally selling state gifts.\n\nHis representatives say he will launch appeals in all three cases."
