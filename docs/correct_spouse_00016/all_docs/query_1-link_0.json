This is her first visit to Australia, accompanied by her best Aussie pal and a restaurant list from another friend, Nigella Lawson: “She said the food in Sydney is insanely good.”\n\nKhan is in town to promote her new romantic comedy What’s Love Got to Do With It?, and discussion quickly turns to matters of the heart. She believes there is a lot to learn from the idea of “walking into love” rather than falling into it heart first."
