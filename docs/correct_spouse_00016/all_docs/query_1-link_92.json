        "text": "In his first personal account of how he failed to mix politics and married life, Mr Khan writes that the six months leading up to his divorce and the six months after it were the “hardest year of my life.”\n\nReferring to his two sons, then aged eight and five, he adds: “The children’s obvious distress exacerbated the misery....Sulaiman, being older, felt it more and seeing his pain doubled my pain. I missed them terribly. Nothing filled the void.\n\n“I loved fatherhood more than anything I had ever experienced in life...Now not having them around was the hardest thing to come to terms with.\n\n“For the first time I began to understand how people could lose the will to live.”\n\nIn a new book that charts his rise from political no-hoper, he says that when he married Miss Goldsmith in 1995 - she was 21 and he 43 - he had no intention of setting up his own political party.\n\nHe said he “discussed the issue endlessly” with her and adds: “There was simply no way left but for decent Pakistanis to get involved in politics.”\n\nThe party was established the following year but in his first election in 1997 his party won no seats and he describes it as “the Charge of the Light Brigade but without the horses and without the arms.”\n\n“Poor Jemima, as well as putting up with the whole Zionist plot story, had to see endless articles criticising, mocking and ridiculing her husband,” he says.\n\nHis wife “wished I had never gone into politics,” he adds. “I had become a figure of ridicule and the butt of jokes, my private life raked over in the media.”\n\nHe says she “used to ask me how long I would keep pursuing politics without succeeding, at what point I would decide it was futile,” but adds: “I couldn’t answer, simply because a dream has no time frame.”\n\nBut he admits: “My greatest sacrifice for being in politics was not always being able to spend as much time as I wanted to with my family.”\n\nMr Khan said the second election in 2002 – in which his party took one seat, his own - was even tougher on his marriage adding: “Instead of being able to be the asset she should have been, my political opponents had turned her into a liability. Because they couldn’t hurl accusations of sleaze at me, they attacked me through her.\n\n“Hard for anyone, this kind of treatment was particularly distressing for somebody like Jemima, who was naturally shy and sensitive.”\n\n“When I returned home to Islamabad, I found Jemima demoralised and for the first time realised she was losing the battle and giving up.”\n\nShe returned to Britain to study for a one year master’s course in Modern Trends in Islam at London University’s School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) taking their two boys with her.\n\n“As always, I believed that somehow circumstance might change. I hoped that if the political climate improved I could lure her back or that she would come to realise that the life we created together in Pakistan was worth staying for but in my heart, I knew it was the beginning of the end.”\n\nNevertheless he says there was no acrimony in the divorce in 2004 and his children visit him in Pakistan during their school holidays and he stays with his mother-in-law Lady Annabel Goldsmith, when he visits them in London.\n\n“Moreover the burden of Jemima’s unhappiness was lifted from me and if there’s one thing worse than seeing a loved one leave, it’s seeing a loved one unhappy.”\n\nDespite his “batchelor” past, Mr Khan says his wife knew “she did not marry a lounge lizard” and adds: “It is hard to say that with hindsight I would have done things differently.”\n\n“If anything could have prevented me from marrying Jemima, it was the realisation that she was maybe too young and inexperienced to be presented with such a challenge."
