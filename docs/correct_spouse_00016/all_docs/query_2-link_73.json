        "text": "For many years, Hugh Grant was seen as an eternal bachelor.\n\nWith interesting thoughts on monogamy, highly publicised relationships (and affairs), and a complicated family situation, even Grant himself had dismissed the idea of 'settling down'.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, he did just that. Now married to the mother of three of his five children, Anna Eberstein, he's admitted he was \"plain wrong\" about his perceptions of marriage and children.\n\nThis week, after misinformation was spread about Grant's marriage, the actor set the record straight, tweeting that he married his Swedish wife for love, not for \"passport reasons\".\n\nYears earlier, marriage was the last thing on Grant's mind.\n\nWatch: Hugh Grant talks to Ellen about becoming a father. Post continues below video.\n\nVideo via The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\nIn 1987, Grant, now 60, met Elizabeth Hurley, 56, on the set of Spanish film Remando al Viento (Rowing with the Wind). It was Hurley's first major acting role, and one of his earlier movie roles.\n\nWhat resulted was one of the tabloids favourite couples. Certified A-listers, both together and apart, the interest in their relationship was intense and from the outside looking in, it appeared perfect.\n\nWhich is why what happened in 1995, eight years into their relationship, was so shocking to the public.\n\nGrant was caught engaging in a \"lewd act\" with sex worker, Divine Brown, on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.\n\n\"I felt like I'd been shot,\" Hurley told Barbara Walters in an interview later that year.\n\nGrant took responsibility for the hurt he caused. In a public statement, he admitted, \"Last night I did something completely insane.\n\nAfter their breakup, Grant was linked to several women. He was rumoured to have had a fling with his Two Weeks Notice co-star Sandra Bullock in 2001.\n\nIn 2004 Grant began dating Jemima Khan - the ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer (and current Prime Minister of Pakistan) Imran Khan. They broke up in 2007.\n\nIn 2003, Grant told the Daily Mail he felt he had \"too much career and too much home life\".\n\n\"I need to get married and have children. I definitely keep my thoughts open to the idea of settling down and breeding,\" he said.\n\nBut he never really took that seriously.\n\nThe same article featured quotes and anecdotes from Grant's friends and associates about his bachelor lifestyle, and how much he enjoyed the single life.\n\n\"He's never had a kiss-and-tell, because that's for stupid soap stars who go to Stringfellows and pick up awful lap dancers,\" a friend said.\n\n\"He goes for well-brought-up women who wouldn't dream of telling all, and he does very well. He's a single man, so why not?\"\n\nIn 2012, Grant himself said he was \"not a massive believer in marriage,\" and in 2015 he told People he thought it was \"a recipe for mutual misery\".\n\nThen in August 2016, Grant claimed the secret to a happy marriage was an open marriage.\n\n\"Do I think human beings are meant to be in 40-year-long monogamous, faithful relationships ... No,\" Grant told Howard Stern on his radio show.\n\n\"Whoever said they were? Only the Bible or something. No one's ever said that that's a good idea.\"\n\nBy this point, his personal life had gotten much more complicated.\n\nIn September 2011, he welcomed his daughter Tabitha, the product of what his publicist called a “fleeting affair” with Chinese restaurant receptionist Tinglan Hong.\n\nWhen the actor met his first baby, he was 51.\n\nGrant's second and third children – two boys – were actually in utero at the same time, to different mothers.\n\nThe first to arrive, named John Mungo, was born in September 2012 to Swedish television producer Anna Eberstein, 41. The other, Felix, was born three months later in December 2012; Grant's second child with Hong.\n\nGrant had gone from philanderer to father-of-three in the space of 15 months.\n\nGrant and Eberstein welcomed another child – who has never been publicly named – in December 2015.\n\nIn 2018 they made a very rare appearance together at the Golden Globes, and it was clear Eberstein was pregnant again. A month later, their third child together was born.\n\nFunnily enough, it was Hurley who confirmed this news during an interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live.\n\n\"He had another one last week,\" she said at the time. \"He has five. He was over 50 when he spawned them all.\"\n\nGrant has been very private about his family life, but has spoken about parenthood a couple of times.\n\nOn becoming a father, he told People TV: \"It was the nicest thing that's ever happened to me - he said sounding clichéd - but it happens to be true.\"\n\n\"It's just lovely to have all that love around. Suddenly you love someone more than yourself. It's unheard of in my case and they love you and it's all enchanting.\"\n\nAfter the birth of Tabitha, he told Ellen Degeneres everyone who told him to have kids was right.\n\n\"Now that I have a child, it is life-changing. I recommend it. Get some!\" he said.\n\nWhile his attitude on children changed, his opinions on marriage took a little longer to come around.\n\nGrant married Eberstein in May 2018, but the commitment really only came about for practical reasons.\n\n\"My wife agrees with me that marriage is a pretty preposterous social construct,\" he told USA Today.\n\n\"But when you've got three children, it's a nice thing to do.\"\n\nIn November 2020, Grant said in an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert he and Eberstein had contracted COVID-19 in February.\n\nHe experienced a number of common coronavirus symptoms including a tightness in the chest and a loss of smell.\n\nBut there were also a few more unusual symptoms.\n\n\"I kept breaking into a terrible sweat. It was like a poncho of sweat, embarrassing really. And then my eye balls felt about three sizes too big,\" he explained.\n\nNoticing he'd also lost his sense of smell, Grant began to panic.\n\n\"I was walking down the street one day and I thought, I can't smell a damn thing. And you start to panic. Because by then people had just started to talk about this as a sort of symptom,\" he said.\n\n\"I started sniffing flowers – nothing. And you get more and more desperate. I started sniffing in garbage cans and then you know, you want to sniff strangers' armpits, because you just can't smell anything.\n\n\"I eventually went home and sprayed my wife’s Chanel No. 5 directly into my face, couldn’t smell a thing, but I did go blind,\" he joked.\n\nAn antibody test a month ago confirmed they'd had the virus fairly early in the pandemic.\n\n\"We have antibodies, I'm rather proud of them. I got it in February, I had an antibody test only a month ago and I still have those antibodies, so I know that's what it was,\" he explained to Colbert."
