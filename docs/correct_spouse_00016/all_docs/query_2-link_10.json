I used to roll my eyes. People would say, 'Oh Hugh you don’t understand it', but they were right.\"\n\nHugh with his wife Anna Eberstein\n\nDoes Hugh Grant have children?\n\nHugh Grant has five children in total. Anna and Hugh welcomed their first child John Mungo Grant in September 2012 and welcomed their second child - whose name remains unknown - in December 2015. In March 2018, Hugh's ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley revealed that the couple had welcomed their third child.\n\nMORE: Hugh Grant is now friends with people who once burgled his flat\n\nMORE: What is Hugh Grant's net worth?\n\nMORE: Hugh Grant reveals why he should have married years ago\n\nElizabeth appeared on Watch What Happens Live and casually announced that her former flame had welcomed his fifth child with partner Anna. \"He had another one last week,” she told Andy Cohen at the time. “He has five.
