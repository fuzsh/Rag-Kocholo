        "text": "In Pakistan the constitution has been suspended, lawyers are imprisoned, news channels are off air, militants have gained ground ... and these points have been made so often in recent weeks that it has become necessary to find new ways to say them so that people's eyes don't glaze over. No wonder the media has seized on Jemima Khan - ex-wife of Imran, ex-partner of Hugh Grant, sister of Zach Goldsmith and head of the Free Pakistan Movement.\n\nCynicism is the easy response. But the point to be made about Jemima's vocal criticism of General Musharraf is that her opinions on the emergency are well informed and politically astute. If this isn't enough to give her credibility, then consider the woman seen standing beside her at the rallies outside the Pakistan High Commission in London. She is Hina Jilani, one of Pakistan's leading human rights activists and co-founder of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission. That Jemima Khan receives more attention in the press for her anti-emergency stance than does one of the stalwarts of democracy and human rights in Pakistan since the Zia years is enormously irritating, but it's hardly Jemima's fault. And it's probably safe to say that we wouldn't see so many pictures of Hina Jilani if she wasn't often standing beside Jemima Khan.\n\nJemima's objective seems to be simply to use her public profile in the UK to keep attention focused on a very serious crisis - and while there are always pitfalls in such situations, I haven't heard too many protests about this in Pakistan. Largely, Jemima has always been a popular figure there - from the start, her attempts to learn Urdu and her swift rejoinders to any suggestions that she had entered an \"inferior\" world were welcomed by people unaccustomed to outsiders seeing the positive aspects of their nation. And in a world where divorce is usually an excuse for mud-slinging, Jemima and Imran's continued respect for each other is a welcome change. When he was \"in hiding\" from the police a week or so ago he sent her a video message addressing both the nation and the wider world, which she released on his behalf.\n\nIn Pakistan there is much else to focus on, so Jemima is hardly front-page news. Even so, one of Pakistan's leading newspapers covered Saturday's rally with the headline: JEMIMA AND HINA LEAD LONDON PROTEST. There is no reason why celebrities and activists can't share a headline, each giving the other a particular gloss."
