        "text": "Hugh Grant’s wife was by his side at Tuesday’s Wonka world premiere in London.\n\nHugh, 63, has been married to Anna Elisabet Eberstein since 2018 but the loved-up couple aren’t seen at public events together that often.\n\nHugh and Anna put on an affectionate display at the bash and posed for photographers arm in arm.\n\nLooking as dapper as ever, Hugh rocked up wearing a black suit while Anna – with whom the actor shares three kids – cut a chic figure in a textured white mini-dress.\n\nThe happily-married duo appeared to have a blast at the Royal Albert hall bash, which isn’t too far from their multi-million-pound home in Chelsea.\n\nHugh plays an Oompa Loompa in Wonka – starring Timothée Chalamet as the titular chocolate maker – a gig that was met with controversy, with an actor with dwarfism criticising the casting.\n\nGeorge Coppen, 26, claimed that a ‘door is being closed’ on him and other actors with the condition by giving the role to a high-profile star like Hugh, who does not have dwarfism.\n\nOompa Loompas in two previous film adaptations of Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory – 1971’s musical version starring Gene Wilder and Tim Burton’s 2005 film with Johnny Depp – were played by a variety of actors, including Rudy Borgstaller, George Claydon, Malcolm Dixon, Rusty Goffe and Deep Roy.\n\nAll of these actors have dwarfism.\n\n‘A lot of actors [with dwarfism] feel like we are being pushed out of the industry we love,’ George explained.\n\n‘A lot of people, myself included, argue that dwarfs should be offered everyday roles in dramas and soaps, but we aren’t getting offered those roles,’ he told the BBC.\n\nHe described the issue as one door ‘being closed but they have forgotten to open the next one’.\n\nGeorge is a second-generation actor, with his father, Willie Coppen, also a star of the screen.\n\nWillie kicked off his career portraying one of the Ewoks in 1983’s Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi, before also appearing in The NeverEnding Story and Willow.\n\nBoth father and son got the opportunity to act alongside one another in the 2022 Disney Plus TV series reboot of the beloved film.\n\nGeorge has also appeared in Artemis Fowl and as Sweet Cupid in last year’s The School for Good and Evil.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Shannen Doherty reveals breast cancer has spread to her bones in devastating update"
