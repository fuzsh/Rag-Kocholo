        "text": "Despite being divorced, she wrote on the social media platform: “22 years later, after humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices, my sons’ father is Pakistan’s next PM.\n\n“It’s an incredible lesson in tenacity, belief & refusal to accept defeat.\n\n“The challenge now is to remember why he entered politics in the 1st place. Congratulations @ImranKhanPTI.”\n\nJemima Khan was born on January 30, 1974 at Westminster Hospital in London, and is a British television, film and documentary producer, journalist and campaigner.\n\nShe is the eldest child of Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart and financier Sir James Goldsmith.\n\nHer mother is from an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family, the daughter of the Marquess of Londonderry, while her father was the son of former Conservative MP Frank Goldsmith.\n\nMs Khan has two younger brothers, Zac Goldsmith and Ben Goldsmith, and five parental and three maternal half-siblings.\n\nShe enrolled at the University of Bristol in 1993 and studied English, but dropped out when she married Imran Khan in 1995, before completing her bachelor’s degree in March 2002 with upper second-class honours.\n\nMs Khan married the former World Cup winning Pakistan cricket captain on May 16, 1995 in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris, followed by a civil ceremony on June 21, 1995 at the Richmond Register Office.\n\nShortly before her wedding to Mr Khan, she converted to Islam and after the marriage, relocated to her new husband’s hometown of Lahore in Pakistan, where she learned to speak Urdu and also wore traditional Pakistani clothes.\n\nShe began to increase her support for her husband as he became more involved in the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, and he became a member of the country’s Parliament in 2002.\n\nBut on June 22, 2004, it was announced they were divorcing on amicable terms, with the marriage ending because it was “difficult for Jemima to adapt to the political life of Imran Khan in Pakistan”.\n\nMs Khan returned to Britain with the couple’s two sons and according to the divorce settlement, the children visit their father in Pakistan during their school holidays.\n\nAs part of her heavy charity influence, she established the Jemima Khan Afghan Refugee Appeal to provide tents, clothing, food and healthcare for refugees in the country at the Jalozai camp in Peshawar.\n\nShe became a UNICEF UK ambassador in 2001, making trips to Kenya, Romania, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the last of which saw her help raise emergency funds for the victims of the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
