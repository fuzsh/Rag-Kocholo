        "text": "Before tying the knot with the Swedish producer, however, the Wonka actor welcomed two children with another woman: his ex-girlfriend, Tinglan Hong, who hails from China.\n\nAccording to British media, in 2011, Grant romanced Hong at a Chinese restaurant in London where she worked as a receptionist, often entertaining guests by singing karaoke. The then-32-year-old Hong was reportedly dating the restaurant’s owner, then-60-year-old Marco Yu, before meeting the Love Actually star.\n\n“Tin Tin worked here for seven years and we were good friends. She’s a nice girl and a good worker. Everybody liked her. She comes from a good family and has a master's degree in travel and ­tourism so is very bright,” Yu said in an interview. “I haven’t seen her since she went on ­maternity leave but I wish her the best of luck. I have no idea if she will come back to work. The ­company is still paying her maternity pay but there’s a job for her if she wants it.”\n\nAlthough the couple kept their relationship under wraps – and even to this day, Hong is rarely photographed, let alone their kids – the media ran wild with whatever they could surrounding Grant’s new romance.\n\nGrant would reportedly pick his then-girlfriend up in Ferraris as she dazzled in outfits that included Christian Louboutin pumps, Chanel handbags and Halston Heritage dresses, per British media. Another report stated that Grant’s cousin Flora Hood, wife of Henry, the eighth Viscount Hood and personal lord in waiting to the queen, had bought a US$1.5 million home in Fulham for Hong three months before she gave birth.\n\nMedia attention became so intense that Hong ended up telling the high court how her life had become “unbearable” due the constant pursuit of photographers – including one in a black Audi car who allegedly caused her to crash her vehicle, per The Guardian.\n\nThey share two kids, Tabitha Xiao Xi Grant, 12, and son Felix Chang Hong Grant, 11. Felix was born just three months after Grant and Eberstein’s first kid, John Mungo Grant, per People. “Am thrilled my daughter now has a brother,” Grant wrote on X (formerly Twitter) after Felix’s birth at the time. “Adore them both to an uncool degree. They have a fab mum.”\n\nIt’s unclear where Hong is today, but Grant remains a busy father of five, and he jokingly shared in a recent interview with The Metro, after wrapping filming Wonka where he plays an Oompa Loompa: “I slightly hate making films, but I have lots of children and need money.”"
