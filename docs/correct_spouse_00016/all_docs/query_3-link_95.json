        "text": "At UNICEF's annual Halloween Ball, journalist and campaigner, Jemima Khan, wore a controversial costume that took aim at Donald Trump. Dressed and made-up to look like his wife, Melania (and looking scarily like her) she attached a mannequin of DT so it appeared that he was groping her (\"grabbing her by the pussy\").\n\nSo was it a fair jab at Donald's expense? A subversive way of drawing light to the sexual assault claims against him? Or was it simply in bad taste, rather like the appalling Kim-Kardashian-getting-robbed 'costume'?\n\nJemima's costume also made a dig at Melania herself, with Jemima holding a mocked up pamphlet with 'Michelle Obama's Convention Speech' printed on it in large writing, a reference to the plagiarism claims Melania faced earlier this year.\n\nFor one costume, it's got a hell of a lot of topical news references packed in it."
