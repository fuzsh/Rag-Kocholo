        "text": "I recently read a short story that I love: The Farmer and the Horse. It has two deep lessons everyone needs to hear... There was a farmer in a small village with a single horse who helped him earn a living for his family. The other villagers constantly told the farmer how lucky he was to have such a great horse. \"Maybe,\" he would reply. One day, the horse ran away. The villagers came to the farmer to express their sympathies. \"Your horse ran away. How unfortunate!\" the villagers exclaimed. \"Maybe,\" the farmer replied. A few days later, the horse returned home, with ten strong wild horses in tow. \"What good fortune. What incredible luck,\" the villagers crowed. \"Maybe,\" the farmer again replied. The following week, the farmer’s son was riding one of the wild horses in the fields, when it kicked him off and broke his leg. The villagers arrived to express their dismay. \"What dismal luck,\" they said. \"Maybe,\" the farmer replied. The next month, a military officer marched into the village, recruiting able-bodied young men for the war. The farmer’s son, with his broken leg, was left behind. The villagers were joyful, \"Your son has been spared. What beautiful luck!\" The farmer simply smiled. \"Maybe.\" Two Lessons from the Short Story 1. Everything is Cyclical Seeds of destruction are sown during creation. Seeds of creation are sown during destruction. When times are bright, enjoy, but know the dark will come. When times are dark, adjust your eyes, and remember the seeds of light are being sown. 2. Dispel the Narratives The farmer separates story from reality. He allows space for the events to just exist, to be neither good nor bad—to just be. Events of your life needn't be judged. The wisest among us allow events to exist without applying a narrative layer. Remember these two lessons as you navigate uncharted waters in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
