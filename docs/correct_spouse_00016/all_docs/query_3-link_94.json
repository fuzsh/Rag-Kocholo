        "text": "KARACHI:\n\nThe moment Jemima Goldsmith announced her debut in film production, Pakistanis knew they got to have something to do with it. Well, they did and so did love.\n\nAnd while we were trying to figure out whether it is their love for her ex-husband or the hate, that made Pakistanis such hyped for this project, the film promotions kicked off in full swing. What's Love Got To Do With It? is inspired by the rather short-lived romance between Jemima and PTI chairman and former premier Imran Khan. The film was released in Pakistan on March 3.\n\nJemima's latest offering revolves around Kazim (Shehzad Latif) and his British neighbour/best friend, documentary filmmaker Zoe (Lily James), who embarks upon a quest to find a perfect life partner for Kazim, in his home country.Fascinated by Kaz's decision to agree to marry a girl of his parents' liking, Zoe decides to document his journey. Love contractually is approved and she gets to work.\n\nIt takes 10 minutes for Jemima to capture and nail the essence of a quintessential diaspora family. Kaz is ready to tie the knot and after taking inspiration from his parents' blissful marriage, opts for an arranged setting. The parents, of course, bring in a matchmaker, hoping to find a perfect fit for their successful doctor-son. What follows is a rather progressive take on desi rishta culture.\n\nBut his choice of finding his better half poses some real questions. What made me scratch my head was how come someone as 'ideal' as Kaz had not managed to find a bride on his own. He's essayed as a perfect fit and doesn’t look like someone who’d have any trouble finding a partner on his own terms. Kaz is handsome, and successful with a few secrets of his own (similar to many desi men, he happens to smoke and drink behind his parents’ backs). The answer, however, was rather simple: he's just been unlucky in love.\n\nHow, you may ask? It is here that it's revealed that Kaz had been infatuated with Zoe. However, their cultural and religious differences turn out to be the glaring factors in the former's decision to not pursue the said attraction. Once understanding the hurdles Zoe might face while adjusting to a traditional, Muslim household, Kaz gives up on his desires and goes on to find a partner the 'preferred' way.\n\nSajal Aly as Maymouna is touted to be a perfect match and a video call session later, the couple's engagement is announced with the wedding date set after a month! While this 'chatt mangni, patt biyah' sequence didn't surprise many in the cinema, Zoe finds it difficult to comprehend the urgency. Khans alongside their British neighbours, Zoe and her mother, Cath (Emma Thompson), fly down to Pakistan for the wedding.\n\nAmidst Kaz's ongoing wedding preparations, Cath is also trying her best to settle her daughter with a well-to-do man. Emma Thompson, like the star that she is, manages to own the screen every time she takes the space. The Oscar-winning actor's comic timing, coupled with the command over her character, makes her a winner in the film.\n\nThe brilliance of Shekhar Kapur becomes more evident as the film moves toward the second half. Kaz, Zoe and their families touch down in Lahore for the nuptials and are greeted by a myriad of Maymouna's cousins. The big-fat wedding is set in motion with dance sequences to match. However, not once did I feel Maymouna and Kaz were a match made in heaven and that's exactly what Kapur had hoped for the audience to gather.\n\nAfter a much-expected heart-to-heart and a confession that follows, Kaz marries Maymouna surrounded by their near and dear ones. Once back in London, Zoe invites the Khans to the premiere of her documentary which results in a falling out between the once-close friends. It's here when Jemima sneakily adds a King Charles III and Princess Diana's infamous 'Whatever Love Means' reference.\n\nBut her film doesn't do justice to Sajal's brilliance. Jemima, in an interview with The Express Tribune previously, said that she chose Sajal to star as Maymouna as she could be touted as an equal for Lily. In What's Love Got To Do With It?, however, Sajal's screen time was hardly 15 minutes, something I had hoped was way longer. Sajal, as gifted a star as she is, fails to deliver any meaningful performance in the film.\n\nHaving said that, Jemima did manage to pull off the Muslim-arranged marriage narrative quite smoothly. However, if you are going into the film hoping for some very obvious telling of Jemima's former marriage with Imran, well, be prepared to be sorely disappointed. Oh, and you MUST wait for the post-credit scene!\n\nVerdict: What's Love Got To Do With It? is predictable and has its heart in the right place.\n\nRating: 3/5 stars.\n\nHave something to add to the story?
