        "text": "When an 18-year-old Imran Khan — who would one day become a beloved cricket player for Pakistan and, years after that, the controversial prime minister of that same country — was leaving home for England for the first time, his mother delivered a stern warning: “Don’t bring back an English wife.”\n\nShe was onto something. The year was 1995. After spending the better part of the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s gallivanting and grinding through the London club scene with a bevy of socialites, Khan did indeed find his wife. She came in the form of a very English woman, just as his mother had feared: 21-year-old Jemima Goldsmith. She was half Khan’s age, blonde, beautiful, and wealthy."
