        "text": "Hugh Grant has a big brood — and he needs a break.\n\nThe actor joked that he’s “too old” for his five kids in an interview with People published Tuesday.\n\n“I have no fun at all,” the “Wonka” actor, 63, quipped when asked about his free time. “I’m swamped in children.”\n\nNot only does Grant share daughter Tabitha, 12, and son Felix, 9, with Tinglan Hong, but he has welcomed three more little ones with wife Anna Eberstein.\n\nThe couple’s eldest child is an 11-year-old named John, but they have kept the names of his younger two siblings under wraps since their 2015 and 2018 arrivals.\n\nGrant and Eberstein, 40, tied the knot the same year the producer gave birth to baby No. 3.\n\nThe pair keep their kids out of the public eye as does Hong.\n\nPrior to becoming a father, the Golden Globe winner was in a 13-year relationship with model Elizabeth Hurley and the exes have remained amicable since their 2000 split.\n\nThe actress, 58, even poked fun at his age while describing his “enchanting” and “sweet” parenting tactics on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” in March 2018.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“He was over 50 when he spawned them all,” she said at the time. “Having these kids has transformed him from a very miserable person into a fairly miserable person. It’s improved him. He’s gone up the scale.”\n\nThe “Gossip Girl” alum has one child of her own, a 21-year-old son named Damian, and Grant is one of the actor’s six godfathers.\n\nWhen it comes to raising his own kids, Grant told the Los Angeles Times in November 2020 that he survives “from hour to hour.”\n\nAfter calling himself “an old man with very young children and a very exhausted wife,” the Emmy nominee said fatherhood has improved his acting since he went from a “half-atrophied, middle-aged golfer [to] … a man with a life full of love.”"
