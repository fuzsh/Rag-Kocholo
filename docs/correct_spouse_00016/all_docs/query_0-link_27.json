        "text": "I know a lot of people find them boring but I oddly care for them (Jemima mostly) so I'm rather sad for her.\n\nHugh Grant and girlfriend Jemima Khan have ended their relationship, Grant's publicist, Robert Garlock, confirms to PEOPLE exclusively.\n\n\"Hugh and Jemima have decided to split amicably,\" says Garlock.\n\nGrant, 46, whose relationship with Elizabeth Hurley ended in 2000, began dating Khan, 33, who has two sons with her ex-husband, cricket-champ-turned-politician Imran Khan, about three years ago.\n\nGrant and Khan were recently together at the London and Los Angeles premieres of his new film, Music and Lyrics.\n\nLast summer, he couple refused to comment on engagement rumors, but a friend of Khan's told PEOPLE, \"He's very clever, and she really is funny, witty and quick. They spark off each other perfectly.\"\n\nIn an appearance on ABC's The View that aired Friday morning, Grant brought up Khan when talking about how he's become increasingly \"fussy\" about fashion: \"I used to be a man who played rugby and was relatively butch, and now I watch my girlfriend about to go out for the evening and I'll say, 'The brown shoes, I think.' \"\n\nWhen Barbara Walters noted that he'd been \"domesticated\" by Khan, whom she described as \"pretty attractive and pretty intelligent,\" Grant said, \"I agree with you, I think she's a cracker. She doesn't need my help anyway.\"\n\nJoy Behar asked, \"She's a what?\" Replied Grant, \"She's a cracker â€“ but that's something different in America.\"\n\nSource\n\nDoesn't sound like he's that upset:\n\nFrom Yahoo! news\n\nHugh Grant is glad his romance with socialite Jemima Khan is over - because he is happier living the single life.\n\nGrant, 46, and Khan, 33, announced their split last week after nearly three years together, shortly after he declared he had no plans to marry the mother-of-two.\n\nHowever, the Notting Hill star isn't too upset by the relationship failure, because he loves being a bachelor.\n\nHe says, \"I'm not saying that men are immune to (the fear of being single), and I think you can occasionally, after a particularly boozy night, sometimes think, 'Bloody hell, I could be 70 and alone and be eaten by my Alsatians!' But you soon get over it.\""
