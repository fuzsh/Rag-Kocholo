        "text": "RUSSELL Brand, whos been in a bit of strife over comments over fashion label Hugo Bosss Nazi-uniform-designing past, has a new girlfriend.\n\nAnd it’s famous Pakistani cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan’s ex-wife (and Hugh Grant’s ex girlfriend) Jemima Khan.\n\nThe pair seemed to confirm their union over the weekend by strolling around New York, arms entwined.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, Brand and Khan met two years ago when she asked him to write an article for her magazine, The New Statesman.\n\nKhan, the daughter of late billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith, whose marriage to Imran Khan ended in 2004, was with Hugh Grant from 2004 until 2007.\n\nBrand, writing in The Guardian defending his Nazi gaffe, hinted that he was seeing someone, but declined to say who.\n\n\"I’m not typically immune to the allure of objectified women, but I am presently beleaguered by a nerdish, whirling dervish, and am eschewing all others,\" he said. (Whatever that means.)\n\nBrand, of course, was married to Katy Perry for a hot minute. We think Khan might be better placed to get his jokes."
