In the year 1996, Khan successfully defended himself in a libel action brought forth by a former English captain and all-rounder Ian Botham and batsman Allan Lamb. They claimed that Khan had called the two cricketers \"racist, ill-educated and lacking in class\" and was involved in ball-tampering. Khan protested that he had been misquoted, saying that he was defending himself after having admitted that he tampered the ball in a county match 18 years ago. Imran Khan won the libel case, which the judge labelled a \"complete exercise in futility\", with a 10–2 majority decision by the jury.\n\nPost-retirement, Imran Khan wrote several opinion pieces for various newspapers-- Guardian, The Independent, Telegraph, etc. He has also appeared several times as a cricket commentator on several Asian and British sports networks-- BBC Urdu, TEN sports, etc. He has also provided the match summaries for every Cricket World Cup since 1992.\n\nOn November 23, 2005, he was appointed as the chancellor of the University of Bradford. On February 26, 2014, the University floated a motion to remove Imran Khan as a chancellor due to his absence from every graduation ceremony since 2010. Later on, in November 2014, Khan stepped down as the chancellor citing his increasing political commitments.\n\nImran Khan: Political Career\n\nImran Khan was offered the political positions during his cricket career-- the then President of Pakistan Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq offered him a political position in Pakistan Muslim League (PML), former Prime Miniter of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif also invited him to join his political party, which he declined.\n\nIn 1994, Khan joined a group led by the former ISI ( Inter-Services Intelligence) chief Hamid Gul and Muhammad Ali Durrani who was head of Pasban, a breakaway youth wing of Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan.\n\nOn April 25, 1996, Imran Khan founded his party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and contested elections for the seat of National Assembly of Pakistan in the 1997 Pakistani general election as a candidate of PTI. He contested over two constituencies but lost the election.\n\nImran Khan supported General Pervez Musharraf's military coup in 1999 and believed that he will end corruption.

He accused the US when they killed Hakimullah Mehsud (Talibani Leader) which led to the disturbance in Pakistan and demanded the government to block the NATO supply line in retaliation.\n\nOn November 14, 2013, Khan ordered the dismissal of Ministers of Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) and ordered Chief Minister Pervez Khan Khattak to end the alliance with QWP.

Naqvi termed Khan as a \"sort of a Ron Paul figure\", adding that \"there is no taint of corruption and there is his anti-establishment message.\"\n\n7- Declan Walsh described Imran Khan as a \"miserable politician,\" observing that, \"Khan's ideas and affiliations since entering politics in 1996 have swerved and skidded like a rickshaw in a rainshower...
