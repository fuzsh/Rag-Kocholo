        "text": "When it comes to celebrities, one thing which catches maximum attention is their love affairs. For instance, Hugh Grant is famous for his extramarital affairs. Also, Tinglan Hong is one of the names that pops up every time there is a discussion of Hugh Grant's numerous love affairs. She was romantically linked to the actor in 2011.\n\nThe name Hugh Grant does not sound new in the entertainment industry. He has become a household name in the industry thanks to his appearances in movies and TV shows. Hugh is famous for his role in Notting Hill.\n\nHowever, the story is different about her ex-girlfriend, Tinglan Hong. Tinglan is only famous as Hugh Grants' girlfriend. Together, they are proud parents to two kids.\n\nWho is Tinglan Hong?\n\nTinglan was born in 1979 in China. She is 42 years old as of 2021. Allegedly, she was born into a family of entrepreneurs in Lishui, Zhejiang province of Eastern China. Her mother is a successful businesswoman. Hong spent most of her childhood years in China, and she relocated to Britain in 2003 in search of greener pastures.\n\nShe has kept details about her early life and education away from the limelight. Tinglan pursued a degree in hotel and management at the University of Surrey in the UK. After graduating from the university, she was hired to work as a receptionist in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nHugh Grant and Tinglan Hong's relationship\n\nHow did Tinglan Hong and Hugh Grant meet? The duo met in a Chinese restaurant where she was working as a receptionist. After their first meeting, Hugh made frequent visits to the restaurant. They started dating in 2011, but their relationship was considered a fleeting affair given that Grant had been labelled a playboy.\n\nThey did not shy away from displaying their affection in public. At one time, they were spotted kissing in a pub. They even went on vacation together. When Tinglan met Hugh, she knew of his numerous affairs, but this was never a concern for her.\n\nAfter dating for several months, they went their separate ways. The reason for their split has not yet been revealed to the public. At this time, Tinglan was pregnant with her first child. Even though they had separated, Hugh did everything possible to support the soon-to-be mother of his child.\n\nHugh Grant moved the mother of his baby daughter into a Â£1.2million house. The house was located more than a mile from his home. She moved into the house as she prepared to give birth to their daughter. Grant, who has been filming in Berlin, even took a 24-hour break and paid a surprise visit to her ex-girlfriend.\n\nThey reunited briefly after a year, but things did not work out. She caused a huge buzz in the media in 2012 when she and Hugh's wife, Anna Eberstein, became pregnant for the Notting Hill actor at the same time. Three months after Anna gave birth to her child, Tinglan welcomed Felix.\n\nTinglan Hong's kids\n\nHugh was portrayed as irresponsible because of his numerous affairs but emerged as a responsible father. You will be surprised to know that he became a first-time dad at the age of 51 years. The actor went from being childless to a father of three in the space of just 15 months.\n\nDoes Hugh Grant have a daughter? Tinglan and Hugh were blessed with a daughter, Tabitha. Tabitha was born in September 2011, and she is ten years old as of 2021. They also have a son, Felix, who was born in December 2012. Hugh is also a proud father of three other kids from his current relationship with Anna.\n\nTinglan Hong came to the limelight because of her affair with a famous movie star. Even though their romance faced so much criticisms, they have managed to weather the storm. At the peak of it all, they became proud parents to two kids. This affair has also propelled Tinglan into one of the most exclusive social sets in London.\n\nTuko.co.ke published an article about Sofia Bevarly. The first time people heard of Sofia Bevarly was around 2014 when she began uploading lingerie and swimsuit photos on her Instagram account. But her popularity soared even further and brought her to the public spotlight when she started dating Dan Bilzerian.\n\nDan is an Armenian-American actor, businessman, and social media influencer. Since then, Sofia has enjoyed a lot of publicity, and people consider her an elite bikini model. Although people know her as the ex-girlfriend of Dan Bilzerian, some other facts about her remain unknown. Get to know five facts about Sofia Bevarly here.\n\nSource: TUKO.co.ke"
