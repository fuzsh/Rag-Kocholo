        "text": "Imran Khan with his third wife Bushra Bibi (Twitter)\n\nFormer Pakistan cricketer-turned-politician, Imran Khan was born in Lahore in 1952. His journey from a cricketing hero leading Pakistan to its first-ever World Cup victory in 1992, to becoming the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2018, has been nothing short of spectacular.\n\nHowever, he has had a notable journey not just in his professional life but also in his personal life, especially concerning his marriages. Khan's marriages have been as diverse and intriguing as his public persona and have brought their own unique set of challenges and experiences and played a significant role in shaping different aspects of his life.\n\nEach of his marriages has attracted considerable attention due to his high profile and the diverse backgrounds of his spouses. Here’s a detailed look at Imran Khan’s Wives.\n\nImran Khan First Wife: Jemima Goldsmith (1995-2004)\n\nImran Khan First Wife, Jemima Goldsmith [x.com]\n\nImran's first marriage was to Jemima Goldsmith, a British heiress, journalist, and film producer. The couple married in 1995 in a two-minute ceremony conducted in Urdu in Paris. A month later, a civil ceremony was held at the Richmond registry office in England, followed by a lavish reception in the ballroom of the Goldsmiths' Surrey estate.\n\nJemima was born into a wealthy British family and was the eldest child of Lady Annabel Goldsmith and Sir James Goldsmith. She converted to Islam before marrying Imran Khan and moved to Pakistan to live with him. The marriage between Imran Khan, a Muslim Pakistani, and Jemima Goldsmith, a Jewish British was seen as a union of contrasting cultures and religions, drawing significant media attention.\n\nDuring their marriage, Jemima played a crucial role in Imran's life, both personally and politically. She actively supported his philanthropic ventures, including the fundraising and establishment of the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, named after Imran's mother. Jemima also became a prominent figure in Pakistan, adjusting to life in a different cultural and religious environment.\n\nHowever, the marriage faced challenges, primarily due to the intense media scrutiny in Pakistan and the political pressures faced by Imran, who was then developing his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). The couple had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim, and despite their efforts to bridge cultural and geographical divides, they divorced in 2004. Jemima cited the difficulty of settling in Pakistan and the impact of political life on their family as reasons for the separation.\n\nImran Khan Second Wife: Reham Khan (2015)\n\nImran Khan's second wife Reham Khan [x.com]\n\naImran Khan's second marriage was to Reham Khan, a British-Pakistani journalist. The couple got married in a simple ceremony at Imran Khan's residence in Islamabad in January 2015. This marriage, too, was subject to immense public interest, both within Pakistan and internationally.\n\nReham was born in Libya to Pakistani parents and grew up in Britain. She started her career as a journalist and broadcaster, working with BBC and then with Pakistani news channels. Her marriage to Imran Khan came as a surprise to many, as it was kept away from the media glare until the official announcement.\n\nThe marriage with Reham Khan, however, was short-lived. The couple faced public scrutiny, and there were differences in their lifestyles and political views. Additionally, Reham's involvement in politics, particularly in PTI, became a subject of controversy. The marriage ended in a divorce in October 2015, after just ten months. The divorce was surrounded by media speculation and rumours, with both parties choosing to keep the reasons private.\n\nImran Khan Third & Current Wife: Bushra Bibi (2018-Present)\n\nBushra Bibi, born into a conservative, politically influential family from central Punjab, Pakistan has made a significant impact in the life of Imran Khan. Hailing from the Wattoo clan, a landowning Jat group, and specifically from the Manekas, a sub-clan of this group, her roots are deeply entrenched in the region's socio-political landscape.\n\nHer hometown, Pakpattan, located approximately 250 km southwest of Lahore, is famous for the Shrine of Baba Farid, a revered Sufi saint. It is this spiritual milieu that played a big role in her life and eventually led her to cross paths with Imran Khan, a mutual devotee of Baba Farid.\n\nBushra Bibi First Marriage\n\nImran Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi’s first marriage in 1989 was to Khawar Maneka, a senior Customs official and son of Ghulam Muhammad Maneka, a former federal minister in Benazir Bhutto's cabinet. This union connected her to a network of political figures, with her brother-in-law Ahmad Raza Maneka being a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan affiliated with the PML-N.\n\nThe couple, however, divorced in 2017. From this marriage, Bushra Bibi has three daughters and two sons. Her children have pursued their education and personal lives within and beyond Pakistan.\n\nHow did Imran Khan Meet Bushra Bibi?\n\nImran Khan and Bushra Bibi’s first meeting reportedly in 2015, was a result of shared spiritual interests. Khan, known for his increasing inclination towards Sufism, frequently visited Baba Farid’s shrine in Pakpattan. His visits often extended to the Maneka family’s residence.\n\nBushra Bibi, at that time married to Khawar Maneka, was a respected Sufi scholar, mentor, and faith healer. Khan’s admiration for her spiritual standing and guidance in difficult situations sowed the seeds of a deep, respectful relationship.\n\nImran Khan Marriage To Bushra Bibi\n\nTheir relationship took a significant turn towards matrimony when Imran learned of Bushra's divorce. Imran married Bushra in 2018 in a private Nikah ceremony in Lahore, which was attended by close family and friends. Imran Khan Bushra Bibi's marriage was a decision marked by spiritual and intellectual resonance rather than physical attributes, as stated by Imran in various interviews.\n\nImran Khan Marriage To Bushra Bibi\n\nHe has often expressed his admiration for her intellect and character, attributing a change in his own perspectives on life and relationships to her influence. The couple, after their marriage, undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nThe marriage has marked a significant change in Imran Khan's life, with Bushra taking an active role in his spiritual and personal life. She is known to be a private person, avoiding public appearances and media interactions. However, her influence on Imran's lifestyle and political decisions has been a subject of discussion in the Pakistani media.\n\nImran Khan Wife Bushra Bibi as First Lady\n\nBushra Bibi's role as the First Lady of Pakistan is marked by her personal choice to wear the Niqab. Her approach to this role is characterized by a focus on spiritual and moral responsibilities, rather than political. Her views on Imran's leadership and the potential for change in Pakistan highlight her belief in his vision and commitment to the nation's welfare.\n\nImran Khan Wedding Controversy and Allegations\n\nThe Imran Khan Bushra Bibi marriage, however, has not been without controversy. Allegations surfaced regarding an extramarital affair between Bibi and Imran during her marriage to Maneka. These claims, made by her former husband, Khawar Maneka, also included accusations that the marriage to Inrab occurred before the completion of the Islamic Iddah period post-divorce.\n\nImran Khan Wedding Controversy and Allegations\n\nImran Khan and Bushra Bibi's Sentencing\n\nImran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi were sentenced to 14 years in prison by an anti-graft court in Islamabad in January 2023 following a series of trials and investigations.\n\nToshakhana Case: The sentence is related to the Toshakhana case, which involves the illegal sale of state gifts. The rules state that government officials can keep gifts under certain conditions, but Imran and his wife were found to have violated these rules by either not depositing the gifts or keeping them at a lower price.\n\nCipher Case Conviction: On January 30, 2023, Imran was convicted in the cipher case, which involved leaking state documents. This case led to Imran and his party's deputy, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, receiving 10-year prison sentences for disclosing official secrets.\n\nConcurrent or Consecutive Sentences: It wasn’t cleared whether Imran's sentences for the Toshakhana and cipher cases would run concurrently or consecutively, as both trials were conducted while he was already in detention since his arrest in August.\n\nImplications and Controversy\n\nDisqualification from Public Office: The verdict also included a 10-year disqualification from holding public office for both Imran and his wife. Additionally, they were fined PKR 787 million each.\n\nInitial Findings and Later Developments: Initially, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) found that Khan's sale of items wasn't illegal, as he had paid for them. However, they barred him for five years from holding public office, accusing him of unethical behaviour and making false assertions.\n\nDetails of Gifts: The controversy involved expensive items such as cufflinks, Rolex watches, a ring, and a valuable pen. Among these, a \"Master Graff limited edition\" watch, estimated at $300,000, was notably mentioned by Pakistan's information minister.\n\nFAQs on Imran Khan Wife, Bushra Bibi\n\nQ.1.
