        "text": "Imran Khan’s ex-wife and film producer Jemima Goldsmith has expressed her happiness on the release of the former Pakistan prime minister from the custody of the country’s anti-corruption watchdog, winning the hearts of many Pakistanis.\n\nJemima’s pro-Imran tweet has also led to some Pakistanis even questioning Khan’s decision to divorce her, reported The Express Tribune newspaper.\n\nAlthough Jemima had not spoken about the initial arrest, her pro-Imran tweet, after the Supreme Court declared the manner of his arrest illegal, is now doing the rounds as Pakistanis have always ”rooted for” the 49-year-old UK-based producer, the report said.\n\nJemima tweeted, ”Finally sense has prevailed,” attaching a screenshot of the news of Khan’s release.\n\nKhan, 70, was arrested from the premises of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday by paramilitary Rangers personnel on the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) warrant.\n\nThe IHC on Friday granted Khan protective bail for two weeks in a corruption case and barred the authorities from arresting him in any case registered anywhere in the country until Monday.\n\nPakistanis who are ever-ready to ship Imran and Jemima saw this as an opportunity to appreciate the filmmaker and reminisce the days when she was the entire nation’s sister-in-law.\n\nOne Twitter user drew a comparison between Jemima and Imran and Lily and Snape from Harry Potter. ”She’s the ’always’ to his ’after all this time,” a Twitter user wrote.\n\n”Imran Khan is a born winner. He’s bound to win, God-willing. The only greatest loss of his life is her,” penned another user of the microblogging site.\n\nAccording to The Express Tribune, Jemima’s popularity among Pakistanis can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirstly, her marriage to Imran, who is widely admired in Pakistan as a cricket legend and a prominent political figure, contributed to her visibility and acceptance within the country.\n\nJemima’s association with her former husband helped foster positive sentiments towards her.\n\nSecondly, Jemima actively engaged with various charitable and philanthropic initiatives in Pakistan.\n\nShe demonstrated a genuine interest in the welfare of the Pakistani people and worked on projects related to education, healthcare, and social development.\n\nHer dedication to these causes resonated with many Pakistanis, who appreciated her efforts to improve the lives of underprivileged communities.\n\nAdditionally, Jemima’s respectful approach towards Pakistani culture and traditions endeared her to the local population, the report said.\n\nDespite being from a different cultural background, she embraced the Pakistani way of life and immersed herself in the country’s customs.\n\nThis earned her the respect and admiration of Pakistanis who appreciated her willingness to embrace their culture, wrote the paper."
