        "text": "“I sadly announce that Jemima and I are divorced,” Khan said in a statement released by his political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf.\n\n“Whilst Jemima tried her best to settle here, my political life made it difficult for her to adapt to life in Pakistan.”\n\nThe statement, issued in the Pakistan capital Islamabad, did not elaborate.\n\nAkba Babar, an official in Khan’s party said the divorce took place a few days ago in England. He said all issues between the two were resolved amicably.\n\nIt was not clear who would get custody of their two sons, who are in England.\n\nKhan, elected to parliament in 2002, has become a strong voice in opposition to President General Pervez Musharraf’s government.\n\nHis name is often brought up on a short list of up-and-coming future Pakistani leaders.\n\nJemima Khan campaigned for her husband, speaking to crowds of thousands in the Urdu language.\n\nBut in recent months, she has spent more and more of her time in England, sparking rumours that the couple’s relationship was on the rocks.\n\nJemima Khan is the daughter of the late British billionaire James Goldsmith. She was only 21 when she married Imran in 1995, a dashing man who was then twice her age.\n\nJemima was a prominent socialite in London and a close friend of Princess Diana and other international figures.\n\nKhan admitted to dating society women and frequenting night clubs during his days as a world class cricket player and, before that, as a student at Oxford University.\n\nBut since retiring from sports in 1992, he says he has become a more devout Muslim.\n\nThe marriage caused a stir in both Britain and Pakistan. Jemima, whose family is Jewish, converted to Islam in order to marry Khan and changed her name to Haiqa.\n\nNonetheless, in a country where newspapers and politicians often blame disasters, bombings or misfortune on Israel, India or the United States, his wife’s Jewish link captured headlines.\n\nSome accused Khan of having links to Israeli agents, a charge he dismissed as absurd.\n\nKhan always insisted the criticism of his wife did not damage his political standing.\n\nKhan was the Pakistan cricket captain when it won the 1992 World Cup and is considered the best player ever produced in the cricket-crazed nation of 150 million people."
