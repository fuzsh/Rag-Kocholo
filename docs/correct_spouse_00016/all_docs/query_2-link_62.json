        "text": "Hugh Grant once said he was \"not a massive believer in marriage,\" an institution he felt was \"unromantic\" because humans were not meant to be in long, faithful relationships.\n\nBut the 57-year-old actor, who was propelled to stardom playing a character who famously left his bride at the altar in Four Weddings and a Funeral, finally bit the bullet on Friday when he wed his Swedish girlfriend, Anna Eberstein, 39.\n\nThe couple, who have three young children together, married before close family members at Chelsea registry office, just a short distance from their West London home.\n\nThey were pictured hand in hand and beaming as they made their way down the confetti-strewn steps of the Old Town Hall on the Kings Road following the short ceremony shortly after 4pm. One or two guests took photographs on their mobile phones but the occasion was low-key and discreet.\n\nThe bride, who was holding their daughter, dressed down for the occasion in a short white skirt she was spotted wearing at the 2017 French Open, a smart, fitted blue shirt and espadrilles. She was also wearing a simple, gold wedding band.\n\nHer new husband was dressed in a navy suit, sporting a rather unusual, large silver wedding ring featuring three stones.\n\n“Everybody looked very happy and relaxed, it was obviously an informal occasion with only very close family members present,” they said.\n\n“The group congregated on the steps and Grant stepped in right at the last minute, seemingly in a bid to attract attention.”\n\nAfter leaving the town hall, the group, including Ms Eberstein’s parents and two brothers, Grant’s father and brother, and the couple’s two elder children, got into chauffeur driven cars and went to an undisclosed location.\n\nBoth families had earlier enjoyed lunch with their relatives at Colbert, a French bistro on nearby Sloane Square.\n\nGrant, one of the country’s most well-known bachelors, had a string of high profile relationships before meeting Ms Eberstein, a retail director, in a bar.\n\nBest known was his 13-year romance with Liz Hurley, who remains one of his closest friends.\n\nHe has had five children in the last seven years, two of them with Chinese receptionist Tinglan Hong.\n\nFour months after the birth of his eldest daughter Tabitha, in September 2011, Grant was expecting another baby with Ms Eberstein. Three months later, it emerged that Miss Hong was pregnant by the actor again, this time with their son, Felix.\n\nIn 2012, Grant said he was \"not a massive believer in marriage.\"\n\nIn August 2016, Grant claimed the secret to a happy marriage was having affairs.\n\n\"Do I think human beings are meant to be in 40-year-long monogamous, faithful relationships? … No,\" Grant told US radio host Howard Stern.\n\n\"Whoever said they were? Only the Bible or something. No one's ever said that that's a good idea.\"\n\nHe argued that marriage brings out \"possessiveness, ownership and jealousy\" in a spouse, adding: “I think there's something unromantic about marriage. You’re closing yourself off.\""
