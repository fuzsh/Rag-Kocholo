        "text": "Gary Lineker was spotted enjoying a cosy dinner night with journalist Jemima Goldsmith in Notting Hill, London.\n\nThe 63-year-old Match of the Day presenter is one of the most recognisable faces on television thanks to his hugely successful football career and role as a pundit. When he's not busy appearing on television, he's usually at home in London with his four children - who he shares with his first wife, Michelle Cockayne.\n\nAfter splitting from his first wife, the star began Danielle Bux but they announced their divorce in 2016. Since then, the sports pundit has been keeping his love life out of the limelight but recent pictures have rumours swirling of the possibility of a brand new relationship.\n\nGary and journalist Jemima, who was previously married to Imran Khan, looked like they were having a blast as they were pictured laughing and joking at a restaurant in Notting Hill. They were spotted outside the restaurant holding onto takeout boxes. The duo were with a female friend for the night out.\n\nHe walked towards a parked car while rocking a pair of casual jeans and a white shirt while Jemima, 50, was close to him as she kept a low profile. Jemima looked stunning in a white T-shirt and a pair of black wide-legged trousers. She completed the look with a blazer.\n\nAccording to a source close to the journalist, Jemima and Gary have been in the 'same circle' for some time now. The source claimed to MailOnline: \"Jemima has known him for years and never known him to date anyone. They aren’t a couple but they’ve been good friends for a long time now. He’s not interested in dating and hasn’t been for years.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted their representative for comment. The ex-England goalscorer has been married twice and shares all of his children with his first wife, Michelle Cockayne. The couple tied the knot back in 1986 and separated 20 years later after Michelle filed for divorce, citing \"unreasonable behaviour\" and saying he caused her \"stress and anxiety\" during their relationship.\n\nIn 2007, the star began dating Danielle Bux, who was 20 years his junior, and they later married in Italy. But their marriage only lasted six years before the pair announced they were splitting in early 2016, reportedly due to their differing opinions on starting a family.\n\nIn 2019, Gary opened up about their relationship and said: \"Danielle and I are best mates, we still speak three times a day, we text all the time. When she comes to London she stays with me, and when I go to LA I see her.\" Following his split, he opened up about relationships and said he wasn't bothered about intimacy anymore.\n\nHe said he was at an age where his testosterone levels had dropped. More recently, he even insisted he didn't miss being married and was content that his working life and sons occupy the bulk of his time."
