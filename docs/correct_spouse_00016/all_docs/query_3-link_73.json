        "text": "Imran Khan, Prime Minister of Pakistan, is a kind of personality that is studded with contrasts and contradictions. The sordid story from his cricket days to his being in the saddle of Prime Minister of Pakistan is no less stupefying.\n\n‘Playboy image’\n\nIn his young age, while pursuing his education abroad, Imran Khan developed a reputation as something of an aristocratic playboy who chased supermodels around London nightclub circuit and posed lounging on a bed in nothing but a pair of satin shorts.\n\nKhan was a bachelor for the first 42 years of his life. In the next 23 years, he married thrice. Imran, then 42, first married in 1995 the British socialist Jemima Goldsmith (who converted to Islam), then 21, that ended in divorce after nine years in 2004. Jemima hated the shallowness of western life and longed for a more meaningful existence. She married Imran and felt that in him she had met her ‘soulmate’ but ultimately got disillusioned, and the relationship ended in divorce. The marriage with his second wife, Reham, a British TV presenter, ended in 2015, just after 10 months. It thus lasted as long as a commercial break. Reham has written about Imran’s sexual encounters with many women and his cocaine addiction. Imran wedded his spiritual guide, then known as Bushra Wattoo, in a traditional Islamic ceremony during which the bride was shrouded head-to-toe in veils. There were many reports by various media houses that Bushra Bibi married Imran Khan after she had a dream. The rumours said that the Prophet Muhammad had asked her to marry Imran for the betterment of his life and the country’s condition. Khan, who is believed to be superstitious, married Bushra Bibi — the mother of five who is known as Pirni (a title used in Sunni/Brelvi Islam for a woman spiritual guide; men are called Pirs). Imran has been quoted by reports as saying that the marriage was more about spiritual connection than physical attraction. People in Pakistan talk of mysterious supernatural activities in Imran’s residential complex, something that Khan’s wife is known to believe in and take part in. In his first address in 2018 after counting started after the elections and results started pouring in, Imran Khan, seemingly spellbound by his spiritual wife became more traditionalist and spoke about making Pakistan like 7th century Medina.\n\nIronically, with each marriage, while the women successively turned out to be more conservative than the previous one (or previous ones), Imran Khan turned out to be more orthodox. While his first wife Jemima Goldsmith used to keep her head and hair open, his second wife Reham Khan partially covered them with a ‘dupatta’, while his present wife Bushra Bibi generally maintains ‘purdah’ (or remains in hijab or ‘burka’) and does not reveal even her face. Some journalists allege that as Imran’s spouses became more conservative than the previous one (s), Imran Khan’s political and ideological views also become more retrogressive.\n\nIn his youth, he is said to have dated several women around the world, including Bollywood stars and at least one from Hollywood (Goldie Hawn, reportedly). Of his carefree days, he once said “The playboy image is exaggerated, but I’m not a saint either,” The one serious relationship he had in this phase was with Emma Sergeant, an English painter. But it did not culminate in marriage.\n\nImran Khan, as people who know him well say, had the tendency in his persona for polygamy or perhaps what can be called ‘polyamory’ (i.e., a tendency to marry many women, one after the other). Largely viewed as a flamboyant and a Casanova (one who is passionate about women and has many lovers), Imran has been stated to have several illegitimate children (at least five of whom are reportedly known). Some of his illegitimate children are Indian, one of whom is said to be of 34 years of age and is married. Only Jemima, his first wife, is said to know all about his children. Imran is stated to have courted Indian actress Zeenat Aman who was one of his favourites. What is, however, more disparaging is the scathing criticism Reham, his second wife, has made about her ex-husband’s personal and private life. She claims to have a ringside view of the enigmatic leader’s widely talked about private romantic life.\n\nPresenting Himself as a Pious Populist and Anti-poverty Reformer\n\nOxford-educated Mr Khan had an illustrious career in international cricket spanning over two decades from the 1970s. In his heydays as a charismatic Captain of Pakistan Cricket Team, Imran Khan was known as a person who had injected consistency in the 11-men team he headed for over a decade. His cricketing career was legendary in its own right but it was his historic triumph in the 1992 World Cup that lent him the charismatic halo. But the charismatic captain who led Pakistan to a World Cup victory in 1992 has long shed his celebrity playboy image and now styles himself as a pious, populist, anti-poverty reformer.\n\nVague and Shifty Ideas\n\nAs a politician, Imran Khan’s views have been vague as they have often shifted from one end to the other. Many people, including in Pakistan, accuse him of U-turns, like those of Trump of USA. What he will actually do as PM or as a politician is not easy to predict. He upholds liberalism but at the same time appeals to Islamic values and anti-West sentiment, especially when it comes to perceived interference by the West in Pakistan’s internal affairs. He campaigned vocally against US drone strikes against militants in Pakistan’s tribal areas as part of the “war on terror”. But it is his campaign against corruption and dynastic politics in Pakistan, and a promise to raise a whole new class of “clean” politicians that seemed to have clicked with his supporters. But now there is disillusionment all around with his leadership, although he sought to ride a wave of disillusionment at Pakistan’s old political order, particularly among the urban middle class and young voters, who became tired of living in a country whose economy and currency have been on the rapid slide, and water and power supplies in constant crisis. In the real world, Khan’s rhetoric died a slow death.\n\nKhan is charged with tanking the country’s financial system. His obsession with media optics has become more important than delivery in office. To be fair, Khan has tried everything in his playbook to revive Pakistan’s economy. He waited for a miracle discovery of gas and oil treasures in Pakistan, but that did not happen. He relied on sheep, buffaloes and goats for an economic revolution in the country. Just some time back, Khan rolled out a new scheme under which every woman will be given one cow, one buffalo and three goats. But before announcing this move, he did not do his homework by asking himself whether there were enough cows, buffaloes and goats in Pakistan for every family? As for his latest plan of relying on honeybees, berry plants and now olive gardens, Imran Khan thinks these measures can make him provide 10 million jobs that his government once promised.\n\nThe ‘Taliban Khan’ and Compromise with Corruption\n\nHe criticised some of the Taliban’s violence but his party’s government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province gave $3m (£2.3m) to the notorious Haqqania madrassa. Its head, Maulana Sami-ul Haq, is known as the “father of the Taliban”. Since then Imran Khan has been called the “Taliban Khan”.\n\nPakistan’s opposition parties regard PM Imran Khan as an advocate of terrorists. They contend that he should be given ‘Goebbels Award’ for the lies he tells with confidence. Reacting to Imran Khan’s address to the US think tanks, the Secretary-General of PPP said in a statement that Khan is “Taliban Khan without a beard” for the victims of terror activities. After the election victory, Khan defended the Taliban’s justice system and increasingly portrayed himself as a pious Muslim. The opposition parties have asserted that he tried his best to mislead the international community during his visit to the US.\n\nImran has defended Pakistan’s notorious blasphemy laws under which members of the minority faiths have been imprisoned, and his party denounced Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl shot by the Taliban, as a CIA agent. PTI’s flirtation with the Taliban is part of an overall strategy of using the Taliban as a fulcrum to balance itself against other powerful parties, viz., PMLN and the PPP, while maintaining relevance with the establishment.\n\nAs for his election victory, it is well known, as experts observe, that it was a soft coup engineered by Pakistan’s powerful military. Its penetration into politics, society and economy has seen the military establishment securing an important position in the state apparatus over the years. Imran is the Army’s man. He is expected to do “what the Pakistani Army tells him to do,” said former diplomat G Parthasarathy, who had served as India’s high commissioner in Islamabad. With Khan as the popular face of the regime, it is widely believed that the generals can quietly pull the strings – without taking any responsibility if the things went wrong.\n\nReham Khan, his second wife and a former BBC journalist said in her recently published Book that she married Imran because she mistakenly bought the rhetoric that the latter wanted to bring about positive change in Pakistan. But that was her illusion, she writes. She further says that the facts she knows about him are in stark contradiction with his public image which, she contends, is mere hyperbole, and his religiosity is a mere front. She has exposed Imran’s hypocrisy and that of the entire political elite that surrounds him. Praising PM Modi, Reham Khan has questioned her ex-husband about the economic condition of Pakistan. She says that she was utterly disgusted and disappointed with what she found in reality about him. She says that he is no different from the general rut of other corrupt politicians in Pakistan. She claims to have insights into the inner working of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) – the political party of which Imran Khan is the Chairman. Contrary to general belief, Imran is a person who blatantly compromises with corruption.\n\nKhan’s Stewardship: Better Relations with India were Expected\n\nA graduate from Oxford and very much a man-about-town in London in the late 1970s, he became one of the world’s most admired cricketers. He was captain of Pakistan’s team of talented but wayward stars and, with many whispers of autocracy, led them to win cricket’s World Cup for the first and only time in 1992.\n\nIt took Imran Khan almost 20 years to come to power as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Imran came from an affluent but liberal background and it was expected that he would not have the pre-set agenda against India as most Prime Ministers did before him. How wrong he proved everyone once again. With his ascension to PM ship, it was expected that he will bring about a qualitative change in Pakistan’s political relationship with India.\n\nThere was a time when Imran Khan was regarded as an embodiment of ‘sportsman spirit’. In a match between India and Pakistan, K. Srikanth was adjudged ‘LBW’ by the umpire off a Waqar Younis’s delivery, but Srikanth insisted he had edged the ball. Imran Khan showed immense maturity, composure, and, above all ‘decency’ and called Srikanth back. One really tends to wonder as to where has the true spirit of sportsmanship disappeared.\n\nToday his contemporaries and the later players like Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Mohd. Shami, Harbhajan Singh have all criticised Imran Khan and used the choicest of language to remind that the Pakistani Prime Minister had forgotten the legacy that once he so eloquently had built. Once a respected cricketer, Imran has failed to portray the sports spirit that won him admiration all around. The Indian cricketing fraternity is naturally furious at the way Imran has been instigating India to consider a possible conventional war between the two nations. It is a reminder of how warped and dubious Imran’s spirit has become since coming to power.\n\nSlowly and insidiously, the way Imran has presented himself as a politician, his image as a world-class player and role model for young cricketers has withered away. The decadence of Pakistan has caught up with the expected once lone light in this squalor of a space that is called Pakistan. But the biggest tragedy of this has been the death of a world-class sportsman at the hands of a degenerate group of theocrats who peddle agendas to keep their coffers full. Imran has strayed in the crowd and no amount of cricket can give him what he has lost.\n\nDuring his cricketing days, when he captained Pakistan’s win in the 1992 ICC Cricket World Cup, he was not known for his religious beliefs. He, in fact, admitted to having very little interest in religion and that too because of his mother, who died of cancer. The passing away of his mother brought Imran Khan into public contact as he toured to raise funds for a cancer hospital in the memory of his mother. His penchant for religion is something that came much later in life. As he rose to the political mainstream, he built his messaging around support to religious fundamentalist groups. The support went to the extent that he was dubbed ‘Taliban Khan’. But the same political constituency brought him to power in 2018. Upon winning, he gave a call for building a ‘Naya Pakistan’ that will have a new Islamic identity.\n\nSlanderous Approach on Kashmir\n\nKashmir, unfortunately, is a legacy or extension of the two-nation theory that led to partition. The successive Pakistani governments have tried to formant trouble in J&K, especially in the Valley. However, successive elections in Jammu and Kashmir ensured increased integration of the state and people with the rest of India. This saw desperate attempts from Pakistan to keep the Kashmir Valley on the edge through terrorism. When the Narendra Modi government scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir which was believed o be the reason why Pakistan succeeded in helping separatists and arming terrorists in the state, the Imran Khan government launched a diplomatic offensive calling for a show of unity by the Islamic world. Imran Khan has repeatedly tried to project Pakistan as the leader of the Muslims around the world, exhorting them to put up a united fight against India. This narrative suits Imran Khan’s political constituency in Pakistan, which is in the grip of fundamentalist leaders, who invariably extend patronage to terror outfits in the country. Imran Khan has continued to use religion to make a place for himself in Pakistan’s politics.\n\nNow, at a time when his Muslim bogey over Kashmir has failed to find favour in the Islamic world and dented his image as a strong Muslim leader, Imran Khan is trying to re-establish his credentials at least to his own supporters in Pakistan. Interestingly, Imran was seen counting prayer beads called Misbaha (which he poked out of a pocket and wrapped loosely around his right hand), while US President discussed India-Pak relations and Kashmir situation in a Press Conference. This incident caught everyone’s attention in September 2019. He is said to be using a mini Misbaha with 33 beads (a standard Misbaha contains 99 beads corresponding to 99 names of Allah). His bead counting during the press conference with Donald Trump might well be a part of the strategy to regain the lost ground back home. He presents himself as a populist, religiously devout, anti-corruption reformist.\n\nAs is well known the Prime Ministership in Pakistan is not an easy job as one has to contend with the ISI, the army and the terrorist organisations in that country. It is actually the Army, in cahoots with the terrorists, which rules the country. The Prime Minister is just in namesake; the reality is that he plays into the hands of the Army. Notwithstanding this reality, one would assume that a former captain or ‘Kaptaan’, as he was popularly known, would have a better sense of using his acumen when it comes to dealing with India. His recent rants at the United Nations and his rhetoric against the abrogation of Article 370 have been a big dampener for India in general and to the sports community in particular.\n\nEver since he addressed UNGA of the UN where he raised the issue of Islamophobia – the persecution of Muslims in non-Muslim majority nations – he has been attempting to create a bulwark of support against India. Earlier he had attempted the formation of a block comprising Pakistan, Malaysia and Turkey. But, due to the intervention of Saudi Arabia, the block was a non-starter. More recently, he again made similar attempts to create an informal group of OIC at the United Nations. However, the attempt again seems to have failed. The Maldives and the UAE have thwarted his move to create an informal group of OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) at the United Nations on Islamophobia. The envoys of these countries felt that singling out India for Islamophobia would not only be not just and factually incorrect but also detrimental to the religious harmony in South Asia. The countries refused to support any action against India. The Maldives permanent representative further stated that targeting a specific country would be like side-stepping the real issue and said that “isolated statements by motivational people and disinformation campaigns on social media should not be interpreted as representative of the feelings of 1.3 billion Muslims around the world.\n\nTo the chagrin of India, Imran Khan, in a series of tweets, recently alleged that the Indian government “with its arrogant expansionist policies, akin to Nazi’s Lebensraum (Living Space), was becoming a threat to India’s neighbours, Bangladesh through Citizenship Act, border disputes with Nepal and China, and threatening Pak with false flag operation.” Obviously, he was trying to curry favour with Islamabad’s all-weather ally, China. In other words, Khan in his tweet even went to the extent of saying that the Indian Government was not only a threat to the country’s minorities but also a threat to regional peace.\n\nPakistan has thus been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing J&K special status on August 5, 2019, and bifurcating the state into two Union territories. India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. India has rightly advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop anti-national."
