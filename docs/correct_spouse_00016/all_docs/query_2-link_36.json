        "text": "Hugh Grant is known for being notoriously private about his life away from the cameras.\n\nThe Love Actually actor, 63, who was famously known as a serial playboy in the early noughties, is now married and the father of five children – who he welcomed in his 50s.\n\nREAD MORE: Top Secret Santa gifts under $50\n\nIn a recent interview with People, the actor has explained fathering at his age has been taxing. \"I'm too old,\" he told the publication.\n\nWhen asked about his free time at the Wonka premiere, he joked: \"I have no fun at all,\" adding, \"I'm swamped in children.\"\n\nWatch the video above.\n\nREAD MORE: The biggest and best deals perfect for Christmas gifts\n\n\"Well, I was wrong, I was just plain wrong,\" he also said of his bachelor days during an interview on Virgin Radio in February 2020.\n\n\"And children, you know. I used to roll my eyes. People would say, 'Oh Hugh you don't understand it', but they were right.\"\n\nSo who are the five kids that made Grant finally become a family man? Read on to find out.\n\nHow many kids does Hugh Grant have?\n\nGrant has five children.\n\nThe actor welcomed his first child, a daughter named Tabitha, in September 2011 with his ex Tinglan Hong. Tabitha is now nine.\n\n\"I like my daughter very much,\" he told The Daily Telegraph in 2012. \"[She's] fantastic.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Optical illusion in Wales family Christmas portrait has royal fans divided\n\nThe following year, he welcomed his second child. He and Anna Elisabet Eberstein became parents to John Mungo, now eleven, in September 2012.\n\nBut this where it gets a little confusing. Grant reunited with Hong and welcomed a third child – his second with Hong. Felix, also eight, was born in December 2012.\n\nFelix arrived only three months after John Mungo with a five-month overlap where the two babies were in utero. It's not entirely clear who Grant was dating at the time of Felix and John Mungo's arrival.\n\nThe Undoing actor completed his family after getting back together with Eberstein, his future wife. They welcomed two daughters: One in March 2015 and another in December 2018. Their names are unknown.\n\nREAD MORE: Hugh Grant reveals 'slightly embarrassing' reason he stepped away from rom-coms\n\nIt was actually his ex-girlfriend, the actress and model Elizabeth Hurley, who confirmed he'd had a third child with Eberstein.\n\n\"He had another one last week,\" she told Andy Cohen at the time. \"He has five. He was over 50 when he spawned them all. He's an enchanting dad — really, really sweet.\"\n\nWhen asked if his children would act, Grant told 9Honey, \"I'm against it,\" the father-of-five says about his kids becoming actors.\n\n\"Luckily I've seen all my kids now in school plays and they're all hopeless, completely talentless. It's a huge relief.\"\n\nIs Hugh Grant married?\n\nHe sure is! Grant and Eberstein, 41, got married at the Chelsea Register Office on May 25, 2018.\n\n\"I should have done it before. I'm just lucky. I've got a great wife. I love her,\" he told US Today in June 2018. \"We've got three kids together, we live together.\"\n\nOn June 17, Grant felt compelled to set the record straight about misinformation he saw on the internet. In a Twitter post, the actor shared a Google search result which claimed he married Eberstein for \"passport reasons\".\n\nHis response? \"No I didn't @Internet. I married her because I love her,\" he tweeted.\n\nREAD MORE: Hitmaker confirms split amid infidelity allegations\n\nWhen another user asked if he had Googled his wife's name himself, Grant replied \"No. A friend sent it to me.\"\n\nHow did Hugh Grant meet Anna Eberstein?\n\nThe couple were believed to have met at the beginning of 2012. The couple welcomed John Mungo in September that year.\n\nEberstein was a TV producer from Sweden and the co-founder of Ace Slipper, a London-based sock company.\n\nIt's not known how they crossed paths and struck up a romance, but they are going strong now!\n\nREAD MORE: Home Alone star's daughter shares cancer update\n\nHow did Hugh Grant meet Tinglan Hong?\n\nGrant reportedly met Hong in a Chinese restaurant where she working as a receptionist.\n\nIn 2011, they started to date but their relationship was mostly kept private.\n\nThe couple split after a year for reasons that aren't known. It's believed he met Eberstein at that time but seemingly reunited with Hong briefly.\n\nREAD MORE: The only socks and jocks you should be gifting this Christmas\n\nHow old was Hugh Grant when he had kids?\n\nGrant was 51 years of age when he welcomed his first child with Hong. He was 57 when Eberstein gave birth to his fifth.\n\nWho has Hugh Grant previously dated?\n\nHe most famously dated actress Elizabeth Hurley, who he met in 1987 while playing Lord Byron in the Spanish production Remando Al Viento.\n\nEight years into their relationship, Grant was caught cheating on Hurley with a sex worker in Hollywood.\n\n\"I felt like I'd been shot,\" Hurley later told Barbara Walters in an interview of the moment she found out.\n\nMeanwhile, Grant apologised for the incident in a public statement saying, \"Last night I did something completely insane. I have hurt people I love and embarrassed people I work with. For both things, I am more sorry than I can ever possibly say.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Louis' moment of joy while volunteering\n\nBut the couple proceeded to date and only separated in May 2000. The exes have remained on friendly terms, and he's now the godfather to her son Damian. In a selfie Damian posted in 2017, he called the actor \"Uncle Hugh\".\n\nIn 2004, a few years after calling things off with Hurley, Grant dated socialite Jemima Khan. They split in 2007.\n\nWhat is Hugh Grant net worth?\n\nGrant is reportedly worth a whopping $192.8 million.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here."
