His career finally took an upswing in 1994, with Four Weddings and a Funeral. Then, during a visit to Los Angeles the next summer, he gave a hooker named Divine Brown a wad of cash for a blowjob in his rented BMW. According to Brown, Grant's opening line was, \"I've always wanted to sleep with a black woman. That's my fantasy.\" As she bent over and went to work, however, Grant's foot brushed against the brake pedal, causing the car's brake lights to flicker on and off, attracting the attention of a nearby beat cop. Both Brown and Grant were arrested. His mugshot appeared in newspapers and on television worldwide. His fiancé Elizabeth Hurley stood by him for a while, but eventually called off their wedding.\n\nInstead of ruining his career, his videos began renting and selling faster than before. He appeared on The Tonight Show and apologized with a ghostwritten joke, \"I'm not one to go around blowing my own trumpet.\" And for the next decade, Grant became one of Britain's leading exports, playing his patented stammering semi-tongue-tied character in romantic comedies like Notting Hill with Julia Roberts, Two Weeks Notice with Sandra Bullock, and Music and Lyrics with Drew Barrymore.\n\nFather: James Grant (carpet salesman)\n\nMother: Fynvola Grant (teacher)\n\nBrother: James Grant, Jr. (bank executive)\n\nGirlfriend: Elizabeth Hurley (actress, together 1986-2000, broken engagement)\n\nSlept with: Divine Brown (prostitute, 27-Jun-1995)\n\nGirlfriend: Dana Verbytska (personal trainer, together 2004)\n\nGirlfriend: Jemima Goldsmith (\"Jemima Khan\", ex-wife of Pakistani cricket star Imran Khan, together 2004-07)\n\nHigh School: Latymer Upper School, London, England\n\nUniversity: BA Literature, New College, Oxford University (1982)\n\nGolden Globe 1995 for Four Weddings and a Funeral\n\nSolicitation Hollywood, CA (27-Jun-1995)\n\nSex in Public Hollywood, CA (27-Jun-1995)\n\nFILMOGRAPHY AS ACTOR\n\nPaddington 2 (5-Nov-2017)\n\nFlorence Foster Jenkins (23-Apr-2016)\n\nThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.
