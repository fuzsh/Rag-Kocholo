The Load Wedding star expressed how Meghan's troubles with the British press breaks her heart. \"If only the world were more accepting and let people just be,\" Mehwish wrote.\n\nJemima is said to have enjoyed a close friendship with the late Princess Diana, who first came to Pakistan in 1996 and met the Khan family.\n\nAlthough Imran an and Jemima split in 2004, citing that it was becoming \"difficult for her to adapt to the political life of Imran Khan in Pakistan,\" she remains supportive friend to her former husband.\n\nAfter PM Khan became leader of the country, she also took to Twitter to congratulate him. She wrote, \"22 years later, after humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices, my sons’ father is Pakistan’s next PM.
