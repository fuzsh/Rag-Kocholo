(femalefirst.co.uk) - Hugh Grant has reportedly got engaged to on/off girlfriend Jemima Khan. Despite the pair claiming they are no longer an item, friends insist they have rekindled their romance, with Hugh allegedly popping the question.

Jemima - who has two sons with her first husband, Pakistan cricketing legend Imran Khan - is believed to have said "yes" but has doubts about walking down the aisle again.

A friend told Britain's Mail on Sunday newspaper: "They started seeing each other again in April. It was on the understanding that they would give it a proper shot and that if they could make it work, they would marry."

Sources claim they are reluctant to announce the engagement as Jemima's mother, Lady Annabel, has warned her 33-year-old daughter not to rush into anything. One said: "Hugh has instructed Jemima not to say anything until they make an official announcement. Jemima knows she needs to be 100 per cent certain that this is the right thing for her, which is why they have been so cagey about going public."

Last month, the couple - who split in February after three years together - were spotted enjoying dinner at the Ritz hotel in Paris and last weekend they were snapped sharing lunch at a London restaurant.

Hugh, 46, recently revealed he's in a hurry to get married now he's getting older - but admitted he's still scared of commitment.

He said: I told myself that being single in your thirties is fine. But at 46 it's a bit worrying!

"I would like to get married but at the same time I'm horrified by those couples that I see around me and the lack of affection and passion that can result from the passing of time."
