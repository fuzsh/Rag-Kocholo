        "text": "Our Wing consists of three squadrons and a Wing staff that employs over 1,300 active-duty sailors and 100 contractors to provide maintenance, security, operations, administration, training and logistic support for the E-6 Mercury aircraft fleet.\n\nOur primary mission is to receive, verify and retransmit Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to US strategic forces. Additionally, OC-ALC airframe artisans perform depot work on the Navy's E-6 Mercury aircraft, which are based on the Boeing 707 airframe. The Wing also operates alert facilities for E-6B aircraft at Travis AFB, California and Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland."
