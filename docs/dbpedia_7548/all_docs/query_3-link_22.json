        "text": "What is the difference between U.S. Space Force and U.S. Space Command?\n\nU.S. Space Force organizes, trains and equips space professionals and then presents those forces to U.S. Space Command and other Combatant Commands.\n\nU.S. Space Command actively employs joint forces from the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Space Force to accomplish the command’s mission.\n\nWhy does\n\nAmerica need\n\nU.S. Space Command?\n\nFrom commerce to meteorology to global communications, society not only relies on space capabilities, it expects the services they provide to always be present. Space enables our national security to preserve our way of life. From protecting the homeland and fighting our nation’s wars alongside allies and partners, to providing humanitarian assistance, space makes the achievements of America’s military possible.\n\nThe establishment of U.S. Space Command as the 11th combatant command demonstrates the critical importance America places of space.\n\nWhat is\n\nU.S. Space Command\n\nresponsible for?\n\nU.S. Space Command’s astrographic area of responsibility begins at the Kármán Line, 62 miles, or 100 km, above mean sea-level to the moon and beyond.\n\nU.S. Space Command is responsible for delivering space capabilities to joint and combined forces and protecting and defending the space domain.\n\nWhere is\n\nU.S. Space Command\n\nlocated and\n\nhow big is it?\n\nU.S. Space Command is temporarily headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It has personnel and functions at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado; Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado; Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska; and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\nIt is comprised of military members, civilian employees and contractor personnel. The final size of the command is being determined through a detailed manpower analysis."
