        "text": "About USNORTHCOM\n\nUSNORTHCOM plans, organizes and executes homeland defense and civil support missions, but has few permanently assigned forces. The command is assigned forces whenever necessary to execute missions, as ordered by the president or secretary of defense. Civil service employees and uniformed members representing all service branches work at USNORTHCOM’s headquarters located at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo.\n\nThe commander of USNORTHCOM also commands the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a bi-national command responsible for aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning for Canada, Alaska and the continental United States.\n\nUSNORTHCOM’s civil support mission includes domestic disaster relief operations that occur during fires, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes. Support also includes counter-drug operations and managing the consequences of a terrorist event employing a weapon of mass destruction. The command provides assistance to a Primary Agency when tasked by DOD. Per the Posse Comitatus Act, military forces can provide civil support, but cannot become directly involved in law enforcement.\n\nIn providing civil support, USNORTHCOM generally operates through established Joint Task Forces subordinate to the command. An emergency must exceed the capabilities of local, state and federal agencies before USNORTHCOM becomes involved. In most cases, support will be limited, localized and specific. When the scope of the disaster is reduced to the point that the Primary Agency can again assume full control and management without military assistance, USNORTHCOM will exit, leaving the on-scene experts to finish the job.\n\nCommand Heraldry\n\nIn the forefront is the Eagle, symbolizing our great Nation and our alertness; ready to defend our homeland. Its right claw holds an olive branch and its left clutches a group of 13 arrows, the symbols for peace and war representing the first 13 states. The Eagle’s head is turned toward the olive branch, indicating our desire for peace.\n\nOn the Eagle’s chest is a shield, a warrior’s primary piece of defensive equipment. The 13 alternating red (courage and fortitude) and white (peace and sincerity) bars on the shield represent the 13 original colonies. The chief, in blue, represents their strength, vigilance and perseverance. The chief holds thirteen six-pointed stars, a reference to the six-pointed design from General George Washington’s personal flag. This flag was flown during his winter encampment at Valley Forge. General Washington had a personal protection guard, which consisted of a few handpicked men from each of the colonies. This special guard carried these colors. The symbols from the Washington Flag are a reminder of the efforts of the Continental Army, which served as our Nation’s first military organization to free and protect the homeland, and relate their great undertaking to the task set before us in the defense of North America.\n\nA depiction of the United States Northern Command’s Area of Responsibility (AOR) is in the background, shielded by the Eagle. On the AOR are three stars, a remembrance of each of the sites of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001. These attacks gave impetus to the formation of U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM). The stars are gold, a symbol of those who lost their lives. During the early years of World War I, a service banner was hung in the window of homes where there was a family member in the war. A Blue Star on the banner represented each family member. As the war progressed and men were killed or wounded in combat, and/or died of their wounds or disease, there came to be accepted usage of the Gold Star. This Gold Star was substituted and superimposed upon the Blue Star in such a manner as to entirely cover it. The Gold Star accorded the rightful honor and glory to the person for giving the supreme sacrifice to his country.\n\nThe five stars at the top of the crest represent the five services: United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. The stars are eight-pointed, representing the eight points on a compass and symbolizing our mission to counter the global threat of terrorism. The stars are lined up over the AOR, depicting the umbrella of protection that USNORTHCOM provides to North America."
