        "text": "Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)| Veterans Health Administration (VHA) |\n\nNational Cemetery Administration (NCA) |\n\nVA's Administrations\n\nThe United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is an agency of the federal government that provides benefits, health care, and cemetery services to military Veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, a cabinet-level official, is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. VA is the federal government’s second largest department after the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nVA employs nearly 371,000 health care professionals and support staff at VA medical facilities across the country. It is also responsible for administering benefits programs for Veterans, their families, and survivors.\n\nreturn to top\n\nVeterans Benefits Administration (VBA)\n\nThe Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is responsible for initial Veteran registration, eligibility determination, and administration of VA's five key lines of non-medical benefits. Major benefits to Servicemembers, Veterans, and their families include:\n\nHome Loan Guarantee\n\nInsurance\n\nVocational Rehabilitation and Employment\n\nEducation\n\nCompensation and Pension\n\nVBA is undergoing a major transformation that is a people-centric, results-oriented and forward-looking integration of solutions that will ensure total lifelong engagement with Servicemembers, Veterans, and their families.\n\nreturn to top\n\nVeterans Health Administration (VHA)\n\nThe Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is home to one of the United States’ largest integrated health care systems, consisting of 172 medical centers and 1,138 sites of care. Together these health care facilities—and the more than 53,000 independent licensed health care practitioners who work within them—provide comprehensive care to more than 8.3 million Veterans each year.\n\nVA medical centers provide a wide range of offerings, including traditional hospital-based services such as surgery, critical care, mental health care, orthopedics, pharmacy services, radiology, and physical therapy. Most VA medical centers offer additional medical and surgical specialty services as well, including audiology and speech pathology, dermatology, dental, geriatrics, neurology, oncology, podiatry, prosthetics, urology, and vision care. Some medical centers also offer advanced services, such as organ transplants and plastic surgery.\n\nIn addition, VHA is responsible for biomedical research (under the Office of Research and Development), community based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), and regional medical centers.\n\nreturn to top\n\nNational Cemetery Administration (NCA)\n\nThe National Cemetery Administration (NCA) honors Veterans and their families with final resting places in national shrines and with lasting tributes that commemorate their service and sacrifice to our Nation."
