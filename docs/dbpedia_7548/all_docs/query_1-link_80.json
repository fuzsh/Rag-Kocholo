        "text": "The Military Child Care in Your Neighborhood (MCCYN) program partners with quality child care providers to offer DoD connected families greater access to care. Providers participating in the MCCYN fee assistance program must have a state child care license and either be accredited by a national accreditation organization or also participate in the MCCYN-PLUS program.\n\nMCCYN requires community providers to meet these standards to ensure children receive a similar level of quality care through MCCYN as they would at a military-operated program.\n\nWhat is child care licensing?\n\nAlthough it does not guarantee quality, child care licensing is the main way states regulate child care to ensure the health and safety of children in child care. All providers participating in the MCCYN program must have a valid state child care license that covers all ages served at the center or home. While child care licensing standards vary by state, all are federally required to set baseline health and safety requirements that providers must meet to operate legally. To learn more about child care licensing and how your state licenses child care, visit ChildCare.gov to see your state’s resources page.\n\nWhat is national accreditation?\n\nChild care programs that earn national accreditation demonstrate that they meet standards for higher quality child care that go beyond a state’s minimum licensing standards. This process includes self-study, continued program development, and assessment by an independent professional accrediting agency. Providers participating in a DoD-funded MCCYN program must obtain accreditation from one of the following recognized national accrediting organizations:\n\nNational Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)\n\nNational Accreditation Commission (NAC)\n\nNational Early Childhood Program Accreditation (NECPA)\n\nCouncil on Accreditation (COA)\n\nCognia – NCA/SACS/NWAC (formerly AdvancED)*\n\nMiddle States Association (MSA)\n\nMaryland State Dept. of Education (MSDE) Accreditation (Maryland ONLY)\n\nAssociation of Christian Schools International (ACSI)*\n\nAccredited Professional Preschool Learning Environment (APPLE)\n\nAmerican Montessori Society (AMS)\n\nAssociation Montessori International/USA (AMI/USA)\n\nInternational Council Advancing Independent School Accreditation (ICAISA)\n\nWestern Catholic Educational Association (WCEA)\n\n*Note: Accreditation must include the early learning component to meet the MCCYN requirement.\n\nFamily Child Care providers must also have achieved one of the following credentials:\n\nChild Development Associate (CDA) credential awarded by the Council for Professional Recognition\n\nAssociate degree or higher in Early Childhood Education or Child Development\n\nAccreditation by the National Association for Family Child Care (NAFCC) or one of the accrediting bodies listed above.\n\nWhat is MCCYN-PLUS?\n\nDoD created the MCCYN-PLUS program to ensure DoD connected families have access to quality child care in locations where accredited child care is limited. Through the program, providers have the opportunity to participate in MCCYN if they meet the required quality rating level for that state.\n\nWhat are state quality ratings?\n\nMany states use a child care quality rating system to help families to easily identify high-quality child care programs when searching for care. These ratings help measure additional program features that go beyond minimum child care licensing requirements to support higher quality care. Like rating systems for public schools or hotels, states award child care quality ratings to child care and school age programs when they meet a set of defined program quality standards. Most states use symbols, such as stars, to easily indicate levels of quality. Programs earn higher ratings when the state determines they have met more quality standards.\n\nTo learn more and quality ratings, visit ChildCare.gov.\n\nWhere is MCCYN-PLUS available?\n\nDoD continues to work with states to expand participation in MCCYN-PLUS. The program is currently available in Arkansas, Colorado, Florida: Miami-Dade County, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.\n\nWhich Community Providers Can Participate in MCCYN-PLUS?\n\nTo qualify for participation in MCCYN-PLUS, providers must meet the following minimum standards:\n\nBe state licensed\n\nParticipate in the state’s quality rating system and have achieved the minimum rating as determined by the DoD\n\nDemonstrate continuous quality improvement until the provider can achieve the highest rating or accreditation."
