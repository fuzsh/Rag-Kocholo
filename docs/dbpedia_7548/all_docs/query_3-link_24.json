        "text": "The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Coalition at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB) in Tampa, Florida, is one of the largest military coalitions in U.S. history.\n\nFollowing the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, the coalition began to form with a common purpose – to fight terrorism. “Beginning on Sept. 12, having worked our way to a plan, which we executed or started to execute on Oct. 7, by the time we reached the end of September, we had a coalition here in Tampa of senior national representatives of some 15 or so nations,” said Army Gen. Tommy Franks, CENTCOM Commander in 2001.\n\nSince those early days the number of Coalition nations has grown to its present number of 46 nations, who are represented at CENTCOM. Members have contributed to many named campaigns to include: Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIR), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Resolute Support and Operation Inherent Resolve, to name a few.\n\nThe strength and importance of the CENTCOM Coalition has continued for more than a decade. Having coalition members in Tampa has proved invaluable and helped ensure focused coordination and synchronization.\n\nCoalition forces have made important contributions to fight terrorism across the spectrum of operations. Particular contributions include, but are not limited to, providing vital intelligence, personnel, equipment and assets for use on the ground, air and sea. Coalition members also have provided liaison teams, participated in planning, provided bases and granted over-flight permissions – as well as sizable contributions of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe CENTCOM Coalition nations are working to promote peace and stability in CENTCOM’s area of responsibility and beyond. Their contributions are an example of how the international community is working together to enhance capabilities, share information, and address destabilizing issues in the region."
