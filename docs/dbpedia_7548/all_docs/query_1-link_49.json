        "text": "Our Mission\n\nTo strengthen the well-being of the people serving in America’s military and their families.\n\nSince 1941, the USO has been the nation’s leading organization to serve the men and women in the U.S. military, and their families, throughout their time in uniform. From the moment they join, through their assignments and deployments, and as they transition back to their communities, the USO is always by their side.\n\nToday’s USO continuously adapts to the needs of our men and women in uniform and their families, so they can focus on their very important mission. We operate USO centers at or near military installations across the United States and throughout the world, including in combat zones, and even un-staffed USO service sites in places too dangerous for anyone but combat troops to occupy.\n\nUSO airport centers throughout the country offer around-the clock hospitality for traveling service members and their families. Our trademark USO tours bring America and its celebrities to service members who are assigned far from home, to entertain them and convey the support of the nation. And our many specialized programs offer a continuum of support to service members throughout their journey of service, from the first time they don the uniform until the last time they take it off.\n\nThe USO is not part of the federal government. A congressionally chartered, private organization, the USO relies on the generosity of individuals, organizations and corporations to support its activities, and is powered by a family of volunteers to accomplish our mission of connection.\n\nHistory\n\nJust prior to the onset of America’s involvement in World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to unite several service associations into one organization to lift the morale of our military and nourish support on the home front. Those entities – the Salvation Army, Young Men’s Christian Association, Young Women’s Christian Association, National Catholic Community Services, National Travelers Aid Association and the National Jewish Welfare Board - became the United Service Organizations or, the USO.\n\nToday, the USO has continued to support our nation’s military and their families for over seven decades as they defend our country and its freedoms. By providing support to our servicemen and women as they perform their most challenging duties around the world, our credo is to be always by their side.\n\nThe reach of the USO’s more than 250 centers extends to countries on every continent, operated by thousands of staff and volunteers whose goals are to match our service members’ vigilance and provide best-in-class service to those who sacrifice so much for America.\n\nLearn more about Bob Hope’s lasting impact\n\nUSO Congressional Caucus\n\nThe USO Congressional Caucus was formed in 2003 to enhance the outreach efforts of the American people to members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families, providing a critical link between military service members and their elected representatives. The bipartisan caucus brings together members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives who share an interest in supporting and improving the lives of our nation’s military service members and their families. Traditionally, the leadership of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have served as the four Co-Chairs of the USO Congressional Caucus. The caucus unites Congressional leaders toward the common goal of connecting Americans to service members around the world to strengthen their well-being, no matter where the mission takes them.\n\nThe USO Congressional Caucus is led by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House Armed Services Committees. Co-Chairs include Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), Representative Mike D. Rogers (R-AL), and Representative Adam Smith (D-WA).\n\nFinancials"
