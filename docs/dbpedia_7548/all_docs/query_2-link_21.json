        "text": "CONUS COLA rates are updated every calendar year. Non-housing costs are calculated for MHAs and CCGs and compared to average CONUS in order to generate CONUS COLA indexes.\n\nThe CONUS COLA computation takes into account several data sources including:\n\nLocal market price data provided by a private contractor;\n\nInformation pertaining to the availability of commissaries and exchanges provided by parent organizations;\n\nAverage savings generated by commissaries and exchanges provided by the parent organizations;\n\nCONUS Living Pattern Surveys, conducted every three years, to determines the utilization rate of commissaries and exchanges; and\n\nBasic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) rates, deducted from the cost of living, as required by law.\n\nPayment of CONUS COLA is based on spendable income by grade, years of service and dependency status.\n\nSpendable income is the amount of income spent on COLA-type goods and services, based on a memberâ€™s regular military compensation minus housing, taxes, savings, gifts, contributions, and life insurance. This amount is adjusted for the taxes paid on CONUS COLA.\n\nSpendable income is based on non-housing expenses, adjusted for the taxes paid on CONUS COLA.\n\nFor calendar year 2023, at a location with 1% CONUS COLA, an E-6 with dependents and 10 years of service would receive $41/month; an O-3 with dependents and 10 years of service would receive $50/month. The amount of CONUS COLA that will be paid for a specific location by rank and number of years of service can found using the CONUS COLA payout table lookup tool."
