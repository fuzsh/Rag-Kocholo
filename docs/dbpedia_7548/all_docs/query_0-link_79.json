        "text": "People are creatures of habit, so it is not unusual for people who remember when some Defense Logistics Agency sites were known as the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office or “DRMO” as the place to go when a unit had something that didn’t work anymore or was no longer needed.\n\nMany of these people still use the name when they send someone to turn in property, but that can be confusing since the name went away in 2010. Today, people with excess property need to look for the signs that feature the current name, “DLA Disposition Services.”\n\nThe name came from the “We Are DLA” campaign to ensure all agency’s titles reminded customers they were being served by DLA. Communications from the agency’s leadership to the field also talked of building esprit by building a greater sense of community and ownership for our employees. It also discussed the need to create a “single agency” environment, internally and externally.\n\nThe name change was not the first for sites, which used to be known as Defense Property Disposal Service locations. They were established after the individual efforts by the military services was made a joint effort in 1972. The DRMO name, which stood for Defense Reutilization Marketing Office, came along in 1985 when the parent organization was renamed the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service to reflect the other parts of its mission besides disposal.\n\n“Names may change, but we’re always focused on supporting the warfighter and making sure the taxpayers get the most out of every dollar spent buying Defense Department property,” said DLA Disposition Services Director Mike Cannon.\n\nAs part of the agency, DLA Disposition Services disposes of excess property that includes thousands of items from air conditioners to vehicles, clothing to computers, and much more. That property is first offered for reuse within the Defense Department, transfer to other federal agencies, or donation to state and local governments and other qualified organizations. Such reuse means big savings. During fiscal 2019, materiel with an estimated acquisition value of more than $27.5 billion was turned in to the sites formally known as DRMO. Every dollar's worth of property reutilized is a tax dollar saved. DLA Disposition Services also supports disaster relief at home, and humanitarian assistance and foreign military sales programs.\n\nPeople looking to turn-in or find needed items can find a lot of information on the Digital DSR page. The page offers a one-stop resource to find details about:\n\nHow to search online for reusable items\n\nHow to complete the forms for item turn-ins\n\nHow to schedule the turn in at the site\n\nHow to get transportation support\n\nWhere sites are located\n\nSite information includes contacts like an actual disposal services representative who can answers question.
