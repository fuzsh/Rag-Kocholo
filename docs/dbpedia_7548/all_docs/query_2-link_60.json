        "text": "How to Claim a Retiree’s Arrears of Pay Using the SF 1174\n\nArrears of Pay (AOP) is a one-time payment, usually less than one month’s pay, made to the AOP beneficiary after the death of a retiree. Arrears of Pay (AOP) is not a death benefit.\n\nThe Arrears of Pay payment to the beneficiary is:\n\nThe pro-rated amount of the retiree’s final month’s pay. And, if applicable, any other money owed to the retiree at the time of their death.\n\nTo make a claim for money due to a retiree after their death, complete and submit an SF 1174 with a copy of the death certificate listing the cause of death. Please send a COPY of the death certificate, not the original. We are unable to return original documents. You can download the SF 1174 form from our Forms Library webpage. We also have a Form Wizard to help you complete the form correctly. Get the Form Wizard on our Forms Library webpage.\n\nThe SF 1174 should be used by those who either (1) are the designated beneficiary on file with our agency, or (2) are entitled under the Order of Precedence.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nHelpful tools for surviving spouses and children\n\nIf you are the spouse (widow/widower) or child(ren) of the deceased retiree, we have new, helpful tools to help you fill out the SF 1174 correctly and easily.\n\nUp to two claimants can use one SF 1174. If there are two claimants on one form, both must sign on the same date in front of the witnesses. If there are more than two claimants, or the claimants are not signing together, please submit separate forms.\n\nDirect deposit for Arrears of Pay payments\n\nWe can now deposit an Arrears of Pay (AOP) payment directly to an eligible claimant’s bank account instead of mailing a check. Direct deposit can reduce the time it takes to receive the payment. To have an AOP payment direct deposited to your bank account, send a completed Direct Deposit Authorization (DFAS-CL Form 1059) with your SF 1174.\n\nUse the SF 1174 Form Wizard to fill in your form\n\nThe SF 1174 Form Wizard will help you fill out the SF 1174 Arrears of Pay form. The form wizard will ask you a series of questions and fill in your answers in the appropriate areas of the form. When you have finished answering the questions, you can click a button to generate a ready-to-print PDF with your answers. Get the Form Wizard on our Forms webpage\n\nPlease remember you will need to sign and date this form in front of two witnesses, and then submit it to DFAS, along with a copy of the death certificate that lists the cause of death.\n\nHow to use the Form Wizard\n\nYou can download the entire SF 1174 Form Wizard to your Windows or MAC computer. You will need compatible PDF software, such as the free Adobe Acrobat DC software, available at adobe.com. We do not recommend saving the Form Wizard to a shared computer, because it contains personally-identifiable information. Get the Form Wizard on our Forms webpage\n\nUse the Form 1174 Retiree AOP Checklist to fill out your form\n\nThe Form 1174 Retiree AOP Checklist provides quick tips and a walk-through of the form to help you fill out the SF 1174 correctly and easily.
