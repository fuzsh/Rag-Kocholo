Each LOE has one or more underlying objectives with specific initiatives, milestones, and metrics that will support the execution of this transformation and have the greatest impact on our ability to serve the warfighter and the nation.​\n\nLOE 1: Warfighter Always\n\nLOE 2: Support to the Nation\n\nLOE 3: Trusted Mission Partner\n\nLOE 4: Modernized Acquisition and Supply Chain Management\n\nLOE 5: Future of Work"
