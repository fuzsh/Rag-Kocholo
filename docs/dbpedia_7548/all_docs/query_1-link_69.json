        "text": "There are many reasons you might not be receiving the full ordered amount of child support/alimony from the income withholding, but the most common reason is the payor does not have sufficient disposable earnings to allow the deduction of the full amount. The Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. Â§ 1673) limits the amount that can be deducted as child support/alimony from earnings. The limit ranges from 50 percent to 65 percent of disposable earnings. The full ordered amount of child support/alimony will be deducted as long as that amount does not exceed the maximum percentage allowable. The following is an explanation of when the different maximum percentages apply:\n\nÂ\n\nREMEMBER: THE PERCENTAGE AMOUNTS WILL ONLY BE DEDUCTED IF THE PAYOR DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT DISPOSABLE EARNINGS TO ALLOW FOR THE FULL ORDERED AMOUNT TO BE DEDUCTED."
