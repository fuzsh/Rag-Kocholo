        "text": "As of September 2023, the US military consisted of 2.86 million people worldwide. The CIA reports that the US has the world’s third-largest active military by size, surpassed only by China and India in 2023.\n\nThese forces are spread across six main service branches: the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and, as of 2019, the Space Force – all tasked to protect and service the US.\n\nThe makeup of the US military has changed over time due to external circumstances, like war and geopolitical tension, and internal change, such as the end of racial segregation and the inclusion of women into the armed forces.\n\nHow many people are in the military?\n\nThe military includes 2,079,142 military personnel and 778,539 civilians as of September 2023. The US military's strength of 2.86 million troops is slightly greater than the population of Chicago, Illinois, the country's third-largest city.\n\nOf those military members, the Department of Defense (DoD) listed nearly 1.29 million people as active-duty troops, and 767,238 as national guard/reserves.\n\nMilitary forces not in the total include retired or standby reserves, along with the 38,825 members of the Coast Guard, which are operated by the Department of Homeland Security and not the DoD.\n\nThe US has recently had issues meeting recruitment requirements. In 2023, the military was 41,000 people shy of its recruiting goal, partially due to the strength of the US economy, low trust in institutions among the Gen Z demographic, and a smaller population of applicants compared to other generations.\n\nWhat are the military’s demographics?\n\nIn 2022, Military OneSource — a DoD website providing resources on active-duty, National Guard, and Reserve service members — released an annual report on the US military outlining the demographics of each service branch by race, ethnicity, gender, and age, among other factors.\n\nEvery branch of the military, apart from the Marine Corps, had a higher overall representation of racial minorities than the US population. However, representation varies depending on the service branch.\n\nIn the Army, 21% of the soldiers are Black or African American, totaling 97,482 troops. This percentage is 50% higher than their 14% representation in the US population, showing they have a more substantial presence in the Army.\n\nThe Space Force was the only branch with a higher proportion of Asian Americans than the US population."
