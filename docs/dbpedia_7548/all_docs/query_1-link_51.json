Read advisory for mitigations.\n\nThis guidance is for connected communities to understand the risks associated with interconnected systems and how zero trust principles can be an effective mitigation approach to better protect their networks.\n\nWe have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns.\n\nThis PSA informs the public that while ransomware attacks against state or local government networks or election infrastructure could cause localized delays, they will not compromise the security or accuracy of vote casting or counting processes.\n\nAugust marks JCDC's 3rd anniversary. Since its creation, JCDC has shaped a legacy of partnership between government and private sector and united the global cyber community in the collective defense of cyberspace.\n\nIn this guidance, we lay out questions and resources that organizations buying software can use to better understand a software manufacturer’s approach to cybersecurity and ensure that the manufacturer makes secure by design a core consideration.\n\nCISA’s Federal Cyber Defense Skilling Academy provides full-time federal employees an opportunity to focus on professional growth through an intense, full-time, three-month accelerated training program.\n\nCISA hosts and participates in events throughout the year to engage stakeholders, seek research partners, and communicate with the public to help protect the homeland.\n\nA single resource that provides you with access to information on services across CISA’s mission areas."
