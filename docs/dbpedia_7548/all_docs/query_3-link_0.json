        "text": "SECTION\n\nFormed of two or more airmen, this is also referred to as an “element” in basic training.\n\nSQUADRON\n\nCommanded By:\n\nfield-grade officer\n\nMajor\n\nor\n\nLieutenant Colonel\n\nSquadrons consist of two or more flights. They are the lowest level of command with a headquarters element, usually identified by number and function. The 1st Reconnaissance Squadron is an example.\n\nGROUP\n\nCommanded By:\n\nColonel\n\nA group consists of two or more squadrons whose functions are similar to what the group is named, such as two or more squadrons supporting medical functions being part a medical group. Groups mostly take on the number of the wing to which they’re assigned. For instance, the 9th Medical Group is part of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing.\n\nWING\n\nCommanded By:\n\nColonel\n\nor\n\nBrigadier General\n\nWings comprise two or more groups. There are two types of wings: composite and objective. Composite wings operate more than one kind of aircraft, and may be configured as self-contained units designated for quick air intervention anywhere in the world. Others are based on objective: operational, air base or specialized mission. Wings typically contain an operations group, a maintenance group, a support group and a medical group. The 165th Airlift Wing is an example.\n\nNUMBERED AIR FORCE\n\nCommanded By:\n\nMajor General\n\nor\n\nLieutenant General\n\nWings, squadrons and groups can all be assigned to a numbered air force, which usually has a geographical assignment. First Air Force, for example, ensures the air sovereignty and air defense of the continental United States, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico."
