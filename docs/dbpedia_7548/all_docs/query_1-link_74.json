While the military family and the CCYH provider will agree to their own rate, for fee assistance calculation purposes, the provider’s monthly fee will not exceed the program’s established community provider rate cap of $1,800 per child in care full-time. The fee assistance amount is calculated cumulatively for all children participating. You can view the School Year 2023-2024 Total Family Income Categories, DoD Parent Fees, High Cost Installations, and Provider Caps that will be used to determine fee assistance.\n\nThe fee assistance payment must be paid directly to the CCYH provider. The service member and family will pay the CCYH provider their portion as determined by the fee assistance calculation. The amount of fee assistance provided per child is based on:\n\nThe cumulative fee a family would pay if receiving care on the installation (based on total family income)\n\nThe monthly rate charged by the CCYH provider for all participating children\n\nThe cumulative provider rate cap up to $1,800 per child in care full-time and up to $900 per eligible school-age child"
