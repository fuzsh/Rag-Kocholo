Check out JFQ 114, and provide NDU Press with your feedback!\n\nOne of the driving factors in the publishing world since the widespread use of the Internet is digital content delivery. Joint Force Quarterly readers will note that JFQ—the journal of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff—has been available digitally since summer 1997, with JFQ 16.\n\nAnd as you work through some of the pressing issues facing the joint force, we are here to help your ideas get a complete and full airing out. The only way we can change is to help each other to see the need to do so and then suggest a proper path to that new future. We need you to help be a good wingman and show us how to succeed."
