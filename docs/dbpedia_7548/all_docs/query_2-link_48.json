        "text": "TSA PreCheck®\n\nFree to DoD civilians and Service members, TSA PreCheck is a voluntary, expedited security screening process offered at select domestic airports. With TSA PreCheck, travelers do not need to remove shoes, belts, or light jackets, and can leave laptops and 3-1-1 compliant liquids in carry-on bags.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe program is offered to DoD civilians and Service members (including Reservists, National Guardsmen, the U.S. Coast Guard, Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) employees, and students at the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and the U.S. Air Force Academy).\n\nAt this time, DoD retirees, veterans, NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps, and U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps are not eligible to participate in the free program.\n\nFamily members ages 17 and under, traveling on the same reservation as an enrolled parent or guardian with TSA PreCheck on their boarding pass, can join them in the TSA PreCheck lanes. Children 17 and under who will be traveling alone or without a TSA PreCheck-eligible parent or guardian must apply for TSA PreCheck or a Trusted Traveler Program to have access to expedited screening.\n\nDoD Service members are enrolled in the program automatically; Just add your DoD ID number to your defense travel system profile [PDF, 2 pages] and any leisure travel reservations or personal frequent flyer program profiles. Service members do not need to be in uniform to take advantage of TSA PreCheck.\n\nDoD civilian participation in the program is voluntary. Enrollment requires a one-time opt-in.\n\nOne-time Civilian Opt-in Process\n\nCivilians may opt in to the program by visiting the DoD ID Card Office Online and following these steps:\n\nIn the “My Profile” box (right side of screen), click CONTINUE.\n\nOn the next screen, click the tab for CAC and login using your CAC certificate.\n\nOn the Self-service Consent to Monitor page, click OK.\n\nOn the next screen, click the CIV tab.\n\nLook for the Personnel section, and check the box for TSA PreCheck Program.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page and click SUBMIT to save your changes.\n\nEnsure Reservation Status\n\nOnce you have enrolled in TSA PreCheck, you'll still need to add your DoD ID Number to your upcoming reservations, if the reservations were booked prior to your enrollment.\n\nLocate your 10-digit DoD ID Number.\n\nThis number can usually be found on the back of your Common Access Card. If it's not listed there, log into DoD ID Card Office Online [osd.mil] and locate it under the “My Profile” section.\n\nSave your DoD ID Number to your profiles.\n\nTo ensure your DoD ID Number is automatically applied to future reservations, save it as your Known Traveler Number in your profile in DTS. To use TSA PreCheck on leisure travel, add the DoD ID Number/KTN to personal reservations and frequent flyer program profiles.\n\nCheck that your DoD ID Number appears in the Known Traveler Number field of your reservations.\n\nIf you've saved your DoD ID Number to your travel system profile, it should automatically populate. If it doesn't, you'll need to add it manually or provide it to your Travel Management Company.\n\nCheck your boarding pass for the TSA PreCheck logo.\n\nYour boarding pass should show a TSA PreCheck approved indicator. Your DoD ID Number will not display."
