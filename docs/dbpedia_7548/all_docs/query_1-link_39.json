        "text": "Firearms, ammunition, and firearm parts are prohibited in carry-on baggage and may be transported in checked baggage only. If you have just returned from overseas duty or any assignment where you carried a firearm or ammunition, check your carry-on bag and other belongings to ensure firearms, parts, and ammunition are not present. Contact AskTSA or TSA Contact Center with questions you have regarding TSA firearm regulations and for clarification on what you may or may not transport in your carry-on or checked baggage.\n\nRules for individually transporting firearms and ammunition.\n\nRules for transporting sharp objects and tool.\n\nList of prohibited hazardous materials.\n\nInjured, wounded service members, veterans and wounded warriors may contact TSA Cares to request assistance with the security screening process. TSA Cares is a helpline to assist travelers with disabilities and medical conditions. Call TSA Cares 72 hours prior to traveling with questions about screening policies, procedures and what to expect at the security checkpoint at (855) 787-2227.\n\nWounded Warriors\n\nTSA verifies the status of individuals identifying themselves as a wounded warrior through the appropriate military branch. Following verification, the travel information is provided to the departing/arriving U.S. airports where wounded warriors may experience expedited screening procedures.\n\nVeterans\n\nInjured service members/veterans requesting assistance will have their travel information and type of assistance required provided to the departing/arriving U.S. airports to ensure they receive proper assistance at the security checkpoint. Veterans who are not enrolled in TSA PreCheck™ will be screened in standard screening lanes.\n\nLearn about the security screening procedures for travelers with disabilities and medical conditions.\n\nYes. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces and DoD Federal civilians can use TSA PreCheck® benefits for both official and personal travel. Be sure to update all travel reservations with your DoD ID number listed as the Known Traveler Number (KTN) to enjoy benefits. The KTN also can be added when booking reservations online via a participating airline website, by phone with an airline reservation agent or with the travel management company making reservations. Save your KTN to any frequent flyer profiles, employer booking systems or online travel websites that you use.\n\nNo. All members of the U.S. Armed Forces must include their DoD ID number in the Known Traveler Number field when making flight reservations and a TSA PreCheck® indicator must be visible on your boarding pass. The airlines will print a TSA PreCheck® indicator (such as TSAPRECHK, TSA PRE, or TSA PreCheck®) on boarding passes to help you recognize when you are eligible for TSA PreCheck® on your flight.\n\nYou cannot access the TSA PreCheck® lane by presenting your CAC or other documentation.\n\nYes, U.S. citizens and/or lawful permanent resident cadets and students of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and six State Maritime Academies are eligible to receive free TSA PreCheck benefits through the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. Students enrolled at these academies are eligible to enroll for TWIC, and most U.S. Merchant Mariners are required to maintain a valid TWIC to obtain their Merchant Mariner Credential. When making an airline reservation, enter the Credential Identification Number (CIN) which is the eight-digit number printed under the bottom left of the barcode on the back of the TWIC® card in the Known Traveler Number (KTN) field. For cardholders with the newest version of the TWIC card, the CIN is also embossed on the front of the card."
