        "text": "Before its reputation as the greatest film of all time was cemented, and even before it was released, “Citizen Kane” (1941) was a lightning rod. Its first-time director, Orson Welles, already known for his innovations in theater and radio, had gone to Hollywood in his mid-20s riding a wave of anticipation. By making his debut feature a thinly veiled portrait of the newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, he had chosen a target who could guarantee that the film would be shunned in the press. “Kane” hadn’t even opened when Louis B. Mayer, the production chief of M.G.M., hatched a plan to pay off R.K.O., the film’s studio, and have the negative destroyed.\n\nThat didn’t happen, and today “Kane” lives on as a near-universally recognized masterpiece. It’s still an active subject of discussion: The new Netflix film “Mank,” about Herman J. Mankiewicz, who shared writing credit with Welles, deals at least partly with the making of “Kane.” But controversy alone doesn’t sustain a movie’s reputation for nearly 80 years. If you’ve watched “Mank” but have never seen “Kane” (which is available to stream or rent on major platforms), here are three examples of what made it revolutionary.\n\nStructure\n\nIn the simplest terms, “Kane” is told in flashback beginning with the death of its Hearst stand-in, Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles), who in the first scene is shown uttering a mysterious dying word: “Rosebud.” Then, a sophisticated facsimile of a newsreel provides an overview of Kane’s life, touching on milestones (his sudden wealth in boyhood after his mother acquired a supposedly worthless mine shaft; his first marriage to a president’s niece; the scandal that derailed his gubernatorial ambitions) that cue viewers about what to watch for later, since what follows won’t be strictly linear.\n\nWhen the newsreel ends, its producer complains it needs an angle. Thompson (William Alland) is assigned to interview people who knew Kane to find out what Rosebud means.\n\nEach new Kane associate prompts a set of flashbacks, and it’s always interesting to look for where the narrating character is positioned within those scenes, which at times emphasize the subjective perspective. The flashbacks are broadly but not strictly chronological, so that the written memories of Thatcher (George Coulouris), the banker who became young Kane’s guardian, can end in 1929, when Kane’s newspaper empire suffers a crash-related setback, and the movie can double back, in a flashback related by Bernstein (Everett Sloane), Kane’s general manager, to his boss’s first day running his first paper. The story of Kane’s second wife, Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), and her disastrous debut as an opera singer is related first by Kane’s friend Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten), and then revisited from Susan’s point of view. Few films have so fluidly intermingled the demands of character and story or shifted perspectives so deftly and economically. Nothing is ever unclear.\n\nVisuals\n\nWelles’s use of shadows and low angles have led some observers to categorize “Citizen Kane” as a film noir. But its most celebrated photographic device is deep focus, a technique that allows the foreground and background to be seen clearly at the same time, and that became closely associated with Gregg Toland, the film’s cinematographer.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
