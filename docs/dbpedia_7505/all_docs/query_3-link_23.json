        "text": "I know it's a bit blasphemous - but last week I watched \"Citizen Kane\" all the way through for the first time. This 1941 film is considered by many to be the greatest motion picture ever made. Now, 79 years after it was released, I can safely safe I've enjoyed its pleasures. The film introduces Charles Foster Kane, portrayed over the course of decades by an outstanding Orson Welles, who inherits fabulous wealth and the New York Inquirer newspaper. Under his guidance, or misguidance, it becomes a tabloid success - straying from respectable journalism to gossip, innuendo and scandal (now we know where the National Inquirer got its name). Watching Kane acquire nearly every available piece of art and sculpture in the known world and build his Xanadu castle is one aspect of the story, the other concerns the investigation into his life and the mystery behind his last uttered phrase, \"Rosebud.\" There were classic films produced before \"Citizen Kane,\" and many after, but no film I believe established new standards for filmmaking (no wonder it's studied frame-by-frame in film schools). It features one of the great collaborations between co-writer and director Welles and his ace cinematographer Gregg Toland. Virtually every shot in this film is a work of art in black and white - film noir before there was film noir. Deep focus, moving camera, unusual angles and framing - was this the first true art film? The story also eschews traditional storytelling rules, moving back and forth in time - from Kane's childhood to his death, to the investigation. All scored beautifully by the maestro Bernard Herrmann. The cast, many of whom were newcomers to the movies - fresh from work as Welles' Mercury Players - is uniformly excellent with standout performances by Everett Sloane, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, and many others. No surprise here, \"Citizen Kane\" was a thinly disguised fictional portrait of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, with Xanadu substituting for San Simeon. Because Hearst wielded such power in Hollywood because of his newspaper interests, efforts were made to prevent it from winning the Oscar for Best Picture that year - and he was successful - CK was beaten by John Ford's \"How Green Was My Family.\" If you haven't seen it, place it firmly on your list. A classic of classics - that unfortunately Welles never topped again. Stay safe."
