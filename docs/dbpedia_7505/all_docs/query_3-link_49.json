        "text": "Film: Citizen Kane\n\n1941, dir. Orson Welles\n\nOrson Welles’ directorial debut, the legendary Citizen Kane has routinely topped lists of the greatest films ever made – and with good reason! A trailblazer in many respects, from Welles’ performance as the ruthless newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, to Gregg Toland’s complex camerawork, to Bernard Herrmann’s score, to one of the finest ensemble casts (including Joseph Cotten, Everett Sloane and Agnes Moorehead) ever assembled.\n\nThis film appears as part of our GAME CHANGERS Series, featuring twelve films that revolutionized cinema. Each film in the series represents a bold step forward; using new and adventurous techniques, courageous directorial visions, or telling stories from new points-of-view.\n\nIn addition to the screenings being free of charge, all twelve films are preceded by a Happy Hour starting at 6:30pm, featuring half price beer and wine as well as free snacks and soda. Join us and experience a piece of cinematic history!\n\nMini concerts with Juan Cardona, Jr. on the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ take place 30 minutes before each film and are made possible by the New York Theatre Organ Society (NYTOS).\n\nThe Bardavon/UPAC film series is sponsored by Marshall & Sterling and Herzog’s."
