        "text": "My colleague, who has been reviewing films in my absence, has harsh things to say about people who stay in hospital while I Thank You is shown, and come out in time to see Citizen Kane. I can see his point. For Citizen Kane (Gaumont), written, produced, directed and played by Orson Welles, is probably the most exciting film that has come out of Hollywood for twenty-five years. I am not at all sure that it isn't the most exciting film that ever came out of anywhere.\n\nThe surprise starts with the opening shot. The opening shot, for once, is really an opening shot. Without any of the long list of credits, the who's who in the studio, that customarily marshals in a film Citizen Kane simply announces itself and then gets on with the tale. You see a high-wire fence, a locked iron gate. You pass through, as easily as if you were in a dream. You travel up an artificial hill, past hideous and rococo works of art, to the fabulous castle on the top. This is Xanadu, Kane's Castle, Khubla Kane's castle, where the great man dies, just as the questing camera reaches him.\n\nThe film retraces Kane's life, from boyhood to lonely end, first from a newsreel obituary, then through the eyes of his guardian, his manager, his friend, and the pretty, mediocre wife whom he tries to turn into an opera star. In less than two hours, we learn as much about Charles Kane, millionaire publisher, egotist, politician, showman, as if we had known him all our lives.\n\nThe different stories are joined by the questions of a reporter, a dim Mr Thompson, who is sent to find out why the great man muttered 'Rosebud' as he died. He never finds out. But the audience does, at the very end of the film, in what amounts to the photographic equivalent of a stage whisper.\n\nCitizen Kane is like no other film that you have ever seen. It uses camera and microphone as though their functions had been discovered for the first time. Perhaps they have. It is so vast in content, so economic in style that watching it, you can never afford to relax. It has so much to say, that frequently several people talk at once. Every room has a ceiling, which may seem a small thing, but is not, because it changes the whole technique of lighting and sound. Yet there is nothing tricksy or obscure. It has the directness and the direct speech of life happening in front of your eyes. It is impossible not to believe that this man was a public figure whose face and voice you knew well. Orson Welles, his cameraman Gregg Toland, and the Mercury Theatre players show what can be done when keen, unfettered minds are turned to the study of the cinema."
