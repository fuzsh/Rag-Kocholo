        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThe famous William Shakespeare quote, \"All the world's a stage, all the men and women merely players\", in many ways has a certain degree of reflection in the nature of film. It is essentially a compilation of imitations of life, be it literal, symbolic, idealistic or realistic. Every action we see committed, every line of dialogue spoken, every setting used, contributes towards an intended effect. Numerous factors determine this effect, but the ordering and presentation of the visual and auditory sequences is one of the most essential. In film this is known as editing. We shall take a detailed look at the various tools of editing and evaluate their effects on a film in relation to one of the best known films there is, Citizen Kane. Editing is now a fairly broad term for the industry, encompassing various processes and stages. In this essay we are concerned with the manner in which sequences are joined together to form a continuous and unified whole. This is the fundamental aim of editing; to manipulate the audience's minds in a particular way in order to fulfill the director's vision. In traditional filming sense, editing can be correlated to the work of a building contractor. The filming process provides a series of building blocks (shots) and the editor must take these blocks and construct a stable building (film) that will endure and leave a lasting impression on its viewers. This was truly the case with Citizen Kane. Editor Robert Wise and Director Orson Welles had given a virtually free reign with the film and took the opportunity to push the editing envelope at the time, introducing several elements which are now accepted convention.\n\n1.1. Definition of editing techniques\n\nA general definition of editing would be manipulating a reel of film to enable the producer to change or present a particular idea. Before any editing can be done, there must be footage to edit. In the case of Citizen Kane, the footage is kept very traditional - one scene follows another in straight cuts. At times, the footage used uses dissolves as a technique of editing to show a passage of time. The montage is also used as an editing technique - a series of shots put together to compress time and convey a lot of information in a short space of time. A good example of the montage in Citizen Kane is when his first marriage is ending. We see a series of breakfasts in the Kane household while Kane and his wife get less and less happy. This then leads into the parallel editing, where we cut between Kane's domestic life and his political campaign. Throughout the film, there are good uses of both the cutaway and the cross-cut. The former is a shot that is spliced into the main shot, which is already in the editing process. The latter actually cuts between two different shots, but at the same time, we are trying to convey the idea that the shots are happening at the same time. An excellent example of the cut is when Kane finishes the bad review of his wife's operatic performance. He then begins to speak with Leland. The shot cuts straight to the scene of his wife, and we can hear Leland's voiceover. The different shot being spliced is the scene where Kane and Leland make a toast to the bad review. The scene then goes back to the wife and Kane finishing breakfast, leaving a very bitter taste in the audience's mouth, culminating in Kane's discovery that Leland has written his own bad review of the bad review. A good example of the cross-cutting occurs in the election campaign scene and Thatcher's boardroom.\n\n1.2. Importance of editing in film\n\nWith the importance of its role in film, editing has raised a crucial issue in film theory. Editing in terms of creating structure and story has been considered of primary importance in the process of film making. \"Many film theorists, in fact, have given to editing the highest evaluative compliments of cinema: that is the supreme, if not unique, cinematic tool\" (Bordwell, p. 368). What is being said here is that the highest form of complement that can be paid to a medium is that it uses all the characteristics specific to itself to make an artwork, and that it could not be done in any other medium. This is true of film editing. Editing controls the positioning and transitions between shots, which when done well allows the film to take full advantage of its medium. This area of editing carries the greatest evaluative weight in film theory. By controlling the duration of shots and pace of a scene/sequence, editing can also \"contribute directly to the emotional impact, and it is then that it makes its greatest aesthetic impact\" (Bordwell, p.368). A method that Orson Wells used throughout Kane. There are two conflicting, influential theories on the states of cinematic sound and image. One is that the sound and image are of equal importance and that the best effects of cinema come through their combination. The other considers a state in which sound and image are in juxtaposition, it is held that because film is a time-based medium, the juxtaposed shot to shot montage forms the purest and truest form of cinema (Nichols, p.76). It is the latter theory that has been given the most weight in film editing. This is evident as the development of digital audio and video technologies has made it possible to create and edit the sound and image of a film independently, something that was not possible in film's infancy. In support for the significance and role of editing in film, it can be proposed that a cinema is made by its bad film editing. Although this statement seems to carry a negative connotation and be at odds with our knowledge of what makes a good film, it can be argued to be true. High-quality film editing is often unnoticed by the viewer because the events of the film seem to unfold naturally and with good reason. But when a film is difficult to follow, badly paced or just plain difficult to watch, these are the problems of bad editing and it reflects on the overall caliber of the film.\n\n2. Editing Techniques in Citizen Kane\n\nOne of the greatest uses of editing in Citizen Kane, montage is delightfully used to show the progress of time. As Thatcher speaks to Mrs. Kane, the film cross-cuts between their conversation and the ever-changing surroundings as they travel. The sequence of events is somewhat confusing at first, although the narrative leads us to an eventual understanding of what exactly is happening. Still, the montage effectively shows exactly how many things Mrs. Kane has gone through since the days of Thatcher's presidency. Cross-cutting is used several times throughout the film, most effectively to show the similarities in the early lives of Charles Kane and Jedediah Leland, and the differences in their later lives. Beginning with the simple job of printing a declaration of principles in a small, rundown office, both characters are very hopeful about the future. The first episode ends with a simple cut from Leland's refusal to run for office to the headline \"Candidate Kane,\" in which the stark contrast speaks for itself. The second episode shows the more dramatic contrast between the downfall of Charles' marriage to Emily Norton and the termination of Leland's lifelong friendship with Charles. Each episode effectively ends with the dissolution of a friendship, yet their near the end of the film is effectively tied together by a dissolve between Leland's tears and Thatcher's discovery of his old friend's belongings at an auction. A classic technique in old film, and effectively used in Citizen Kane, dissolves are often a lazy approach to tying two scenes together as it can generally be assumed something happened during the passage of time. Although not strictly true, the lazy usage of dissolves is often misleading. Not so with Citizen Kane. Necessary for storytelling purposes, the best example of a dissolve in the film would be in the scene where Susan, by now Mrs. Kane, is practicing her singing whilst her husband finishes the dreadful opera he has written in a nearby room. As the camera focuses on Charles and we hear Susan's terrible warbling in the background, Kane becomes increasingly agitated as he realizes the full extent of his miserable failure at providing his wife with a joyful life. At this moment, he tears up the opera and the screen dissolves to the rubble left from Charles' most recent attempt at finding happiness. As a side note, it should be said that the opera scene is definitely worth a mention for its pure emotional and comic value coming from the contrast between Susan's off-key noise and the terrible screeching sound of the changing Thatcher.\n\n2.1. Montage editing\n\nIn a reply to a request for a reaction on the book and his choice to light up the citizen for Rosebud, developing, Citizen Kane, Orson Welles expressed: \"No, there isn't anything mystical about the decision of Rosebud. Rosebud will simply have been a piece of junk,\" Citizen Kane is loaded with such references. An altogether essential method in the film is that of montage modifying. Montage altering is a development of snappy altering, structure a development of short shots, every single one of which portrays a book or moving encounter. This game plan makes an undeniable contemplation. Now and then, to some degree, a stunning portrayal of a whiz's life in a paparazzi or paper may show a development of fast shots from different conditions in the individual's life to pass on what his character is as for the writer. This is relatively to William Randolph Hearst, the storyline for Citizen Kane. Hearst was an open figure, a hit and miss character penciled in various encounters by different people. To socio-particular assemble these portrayals is a living pillared way, in any case obviously is wasteful. Montage finally ends up being savvier, \"more is passed on in less.\" Evidently, this is a need to media driven world with TV headways who'd be intrigued to portray a social affair with a comparably temporary clarification. Throughout Citizen Kane significant usage of montage is made to show Charlie's changing slants. His rage at Susan's surrender, his trust in her return, and his strong need to think about what his foe had as a basic concern for him. This last montage is particularly dubious of all Hearst insinuated in Thomspon's assessment of him: \"Regardless, recalling the fulfilled man behind the portals, he turns away from the allurement to take his offer in fights.\" The dedication to character and character progress in the film makes for unending montage potential. There are mix and match examinations between Kane and Susan, both inside Susan's going mud thumping story and outside it. The memory of Kane's childhood, slim as it may be, has a montage drawing in clarification of his mother creation the need to pass on her child to Thatcher. Unfortunately, the chance of the montage framework concerning the viewer is to some degree chopping. In a clarification of Kuleshov's hypothesis, Welles says: \"No doubt individuals don't get more cautious of it. They're seeing something, feeling is being sent, yet they don't in any case see THAT we're doing it with photos.\" The emotions passed on in Kane will typically be interpreted adequately, however only once in a particular perspective on the film. At last, the film's firm joining life contemplations about it makes for a shocking flashback montage which Thatcher seeing Kane's should be a social champion, something no instability will match his takeoff from the Inquirer to go into administrative issues. This montage is an abridgment of one half of the movies reality, it is a slight contemplate of the finishing montage portrayal of the fall of Kane's Political dreams.\n\n2.2. Cross-cutting\n\nThe technique of cross-cutting, or what Eisenstein referred to as intellectual montage, can be illustrated in the scene in which Kane and his first wife, Emily Norton, are shown at the breakfast table. The developing marital rift is reflected in a series of breakfast table scenes in which the actions at the table become amplified, while Kane becomes more involved with a rival political candidate. The scene begins with the couple sitting in silence; it is still and calm as Emily prepares her husband's breakfast. The scene cuts to a similar scene a few years later, though it is now taking place in a much larger and far more lavish surroundings, suggesting that Kane's rise in status is in part responsible for the breakdown of the marriage. A soft focus and increased noise and movement behind the camera give a more frantic atmosphere to the second breakfast scene. This gradually progresses as Kane notices the Inquirer want ads in the Chronicle in the background, and it becomes yet more frantic and amplified until one day when the couple's bickering is disrupted by the composure of the 'political picnic' sequence. The breakfast scene epitomizes the couple's fading relationship and directly contrasts their initial happiness and unity with the discord that now exists in the present. Cross-cutting was also used in this instance to align a series of different times and places and to portray a particular amount of causality. It can be compared with a similar series of scenes with Susan in the Inquirer office.\n\n2.3. Dissolves and fades\n\nA dissolve is a basic technique of merging two scenes with the help of a fading effect, succeeded by a brief overlapping shot. A fade-out includes a change from a regular image to a black screen, whereas a fade-in involves a change from a black screen to an image. Both of these techniques are common in today's films and television shows, but due to the rigid conventions of continuity editing in the 1930s, they were usually deemed unconventional. Kane contains a number of scenes that utilized dissolves and fades between a number of different time periods in the film. One of the dissolves involves Walter Thatcher talking to the parents of Charles Kane. As they talk, the scene moves from Thatcher (in the present) to the parents discussing giving up their son to Mr. Thatcher (in the past). At the end of the conversation, Mr. and Mrs. Kane sign a document that will ensure their son's future. It dissolves to a scene of a celebrating Charles Kane. This series of dissolves serves to effectively illustrate the change in Charles Kane's future as a result of the agreement to move away from his parents. Dissolves and fades had a particular emotional or psychological implication of the scenes they represent. This is often reflective of the darkness of the Kane character himself and the lack of a concrete answer to the questions posed by the film. A dissolve to Xanadu, with Susan Alexander attempting suicide, has Kane making a futile attempt to console her. This fades to a shot of the two Kanes in the Inquirer office consoling each other, as the voices of the scene in Xanadu ask the same question: \"Don't you think you ought to know what it is?\" These non-committal shots are an example of both the nature of dissolves and fades in Kane and the message of the film as a whole.\n\n3. Impact of Editing Techniques\n\nEditing is clearly a central part of the film, and one that has an enormous impact on the way that the story is told. The nature and construction of the story are very complex. Many ideas and themes are repeated through visual images and dialogue. The story is full of self-reference. The story is circular rather than linear. These are all key features of the film that are reflected in the editing. One interesting side note is that this style of narrative, with many parts and perspectives coming together to reveal a larger truth, was very innovative and has actually become more conventional in the years since the film was released. Film editing is designed to manipulate the visual relationship between shots so that the resultant sequence of images is perceived as a unified whole, that is more than the sum of its parts. It is this that allows a film to more dynamically tell a story. Film editing has evolved a great deal in the years since Citizen Kane was released. The film made very innovative use of what is known as continuity editing. This is designed to make the film in question more lifelike and give it a sense of real time and place by linking various shots together. This is usually done through the use of some piece of dialogue or action in a particular setting. The camera will then cut to an establishing shot that shows the time and place that the action is occurring. This is done to make a cut less noticeable. However, the great irony is that while this was the most common form of editing of the time, Citizen Kane scorned it and any other form of 'conventional' filmmaking, in favor of a far more abstract approach to editing which has been a lot more influential in the long run. This will be addressed later.\n\n3.1. Enhancing storytelling\n\nThe sequencing of the film is not only a creative way to tell the story from multiple characters' viewpoints or to show the growth and change of a character, but it also contributes a great deal of information and feeling to the story itself. A specific form of non-linear storytelling offers an alternative way to deliver the story through the use of newsreels. This series of montages allows the audience to piece fact from fiction and captures Leland's quote of Kane: \"You talk about the people as though you owned them. So they will lose the demon that has been on their backs.\" Another creative form of sequencing and providing information along with suspense is the scene that reveals the meaning of the word \"Rosebud.\" In fear of not presenting a story and a detailed summation of the life and times of Charles Foster Kane, the creators of the newsreel are given the task of finding out the meaning of the final word spoken by Mr. Kane. This leads Thompson, the news reporter, into a wild goose chase to find out more about Kane. This series of montages is constructed through a series of interviews with people who knew Kane, overlapped with narration, and each one provides a piece to the puzzle of the meaning of Rosebud, along with giving great detail of the life, times, and impression Charles Foster Kane left on the person being interviewed. It offers an alternative viewpoint on how a story may be viewed differently from one person to the next. The most interesting scene includes some dialogue shared by Kane and Leland. However, it's the action before and after the dialogue that speaks on a different note of storytelling. The scene starts with the two men talking about the bad state Kane's newspaper is in and quickly shifts with Leland chirping a piece of music on Kane's rocky and tuneless sled. The conversation is interrupted as Kane looks over Leland's shoulder at the misspelling of too many notes, which strikes a nerve at Kane. He is told that he will only learn from his own mistakes. The dialogue briefly stops as the camera captures Leland's silent realization of the true state of his friend, and the quick change of subject by Kane indicates that he is not quite hearing what Leland means to say.\n\n3.2. Creating emotional impact\n\nAlthough it could be considered that all editing techniques are designed to create an emotional impact, most of those mentioned in relation to Citizen Kane to this point have been to do with character revelation, scene mood, or other more specific kinds. However, the emotional impact referred to in this section is the impact on the viewer's feelings towards a particular character or situation within the film. The technique described, which effectively links a change of film pace or style to a particular emotional response, is the technique of Tempo Ramping. This technique enables a change of tempo within the film. For example, in Citizen Kane, it is being used at the point where the reporter is searching for information on Kane's love, the failed opera singer. This technique allows the interviewer to find out, in the space of 25 seconds of screen time, a large amount of information from many different characters. Tempo Ramping is an editing technique that is not always noticeable on first viewing of a film; however, its effect on the viewer's reaction to a scene is clear. This is because by raising or lowering the amount of time a particular scene takes place in comparison to others, it can effectively change the emphasis of the scene in the context of the whole film. By using this technique to emphasize a more emotional or significant scene, the audience will subliminally be affected in the way they perceive the character or situation being shown. This can be related to an interview with Robert L. Davis, where he comments on an editing decision while re-releasing Citizen Kane, in which a great amount of footage of Kane's sled 'Rosebud' was cut from the film. He stated that \"If we re-cut it again today, and I hope we never do, we would never dream of dropping a single scene.\" This is based on the effect of tempo-ramping the Rosebud scene to create an emphasis on the viewer's need for the discovery of its meaning.\n\n3.3. Influencing audience perception\n\nIn a film, sight and sound are pieced together in the editing room, which is where the pieces of the film come together. Film editing involves the selection and combination of shots into scenes and the assembly of scenes into the final film. Editing is the part of the process where the final narrative is created. Many of the film's meanings and messages are constructed in the editing room by the editor, who puts their own interpretation of the film into the works. The editor is responsible for linking the film's images to the soundtrack, which can affect a film's narrative. The sound can either reinforce the narrative or put the viewer's perception at odds with the narrative. In Citizen Kane, the scene in which Kane meets Susan Alexander for the first time at his boarding house is a step-by-step destruction of Kane's public image. The scene starts with a fade-in to Kane's \"No Trespassing\" sign that is quickly ruined by the young couple. This is symbolic of Kane's relationship with Susan that goes against the advice of many and eventually his two failed marriages. During the couple's loud, playful, and awkward romp through the boarding house, they are asked twice by the landlord to keep quiet. The two continue up the stairs past Kane's room to the beat of their own drum, symbolizing Kane's relation to Susan being something he knows he should not do. This all shows Kane's lack of consideration for others, the reason he wants Susan, and how his relationship with her will affect his reputation. Throughout this scene, there are many shots of Kane watching the couple ascend the stairs that show his disapproval. This builds up to the moment when Kane knocks over a table trying to shut a window to quiet the couple. He walks the hallway to his room in a long take that uses an in-camera zoom. This long take is set up to give the viewer a chance to see Kane's last moment of silence and peace before he is continually bothered by the loud Susan. This scene is a major turning point in the film and deciding what Kane really wants. Through the use of both sound and visual editing, the decline of Kane's public figure is constructed."
