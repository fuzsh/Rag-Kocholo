Beginning with Orson Welles’ early career as a dazzling yet hard-nosed young genius, the film charts his rise and tumultuous collision with the Hollywood studio system, and the toll it would eventually take, leaving him forced to do television commercials in his final years. Welles’ infamous struggles with money, women, and authority are all part of his story, as are his charm, immense talent, and astonishing work. Magician, not due out in South Florida theaters until next spring, features interviews with Steven Spielberg, Richard Linklater, Martin Scorsese and Welles’ close friends and family, and provides a strong visual sense of the world in which the enormously complex figure lived and worked.\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=”1_1″ background_position=”left top” background_color=”” border_size=”” border_color=”” border_style=”solid” spacing=”yes” background_image=”” background_repeat=”no-repeat” padding=”” margin_top=”0px” margin_bottom=”0px” class=”” id=”” animation_type=”” animation_speed=”0.3″ animation_direction=”left” hide_on_mobile=”no” center_content=”no” min_height=”none”]\n\nAfter more than four decades, more material regarding Welles is coming to light. The New York Times recently reported that Hollywood insiders, financiers and dreamers have been obsessed by the quest to recover The Other Side of the Wind, the unfinished last film of Orson Welles—a movie within a movie about the comeback attempt of an aging, maverick director played by John Huston. Endless legal battles among the rights holders, including Welles’ daughter, kept the 1,083 reels of negatives inside a warehouse in a gritty suburb of Paris despite numerous efforts to complete the film."
