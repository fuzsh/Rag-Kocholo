        "text": "The Criterion Collection is a distribution company that specializes in “important” classic and contemporary films. Through Hulu, many of these films are made available to stream. Once a week, I like to illuminate a Criterion movie — to deepen one’s understanding of filmmaking and film history. This week’s movie: “F For Fake” (1975)\n\n“Challenge yourself” is a sentiment usually heard in school or in athletics. Its a rallying cry by and for many people, restating that before you succeed you must endure some challenge along the way.\n\nIn analyzing and, more importantly, enjoying film, challenging yourself to see weird, tough and strange films is incredibly important. They help you understand the craft more and experience point of view’s outside of your normal film taste. Thankfully, with the Criterion Collection’s help, these films exist and can be seen.\n\nMany strange and experimental films call Criterion home. To explore new techniques of filmmaking, I was curious to seek some of these weird and wacky films. Boy, was I in for a treat.\n\nF For Fake was not enjoyable. I would not consider it a good film. However, the context of which the film was made — and the person behind the film — makes F For Fake and incredibly interesting look at filmmaking. (I’m going to do my best to break this down).\n\nF For Fake is the from the man who brought us one of the biggest live events in history and, arguably, the greatest technical film ever made: Orson Welles. (The film, of course, is Citizen Kane). Welles starred, co-wrote and directed the film, which is his last. It was made in 1974 — released in 1975.\n\nAlthough intended to be a documentary, F For Fake is considered a “film essay”. The film attempts to delve into the word of fakes and forgery — specifically art forgery. At the heart of this film is the story of Elmyr de Hory’s history as an art forger. Sadly, as a viewer, the film deviates from that premise on multiple occasions. There is a lot of Welles monologue and speedy cuts to different scenes.\n\nThe best way to describe this film: empty. Welles is being too smart for his own good. He, and the rest of the people behind this film, try for clever, unique storytelling. What they end up with is confusing and information that means little with, just about, no context. The film goes between “real” scenes of various European cities and scenes concocted as a dramatization. Having both is not the biggest filmmaking sin, but, with the film setting up its premise and executing it in a poor fashion, the scenes do not mesh and have little meaning. The information goes in one ear and right out the other.\n\nThere are interviews with people in the know with Elmyr de Hory’s work that are standard documentary scenes. However, Welles cuts between the interviewer and himself — in a separate room addressing the camera — with “witty” responses to the information. One can see the roots of Michael Moore’s documentary style in F For Fake. Perhaps Moore was a fan?\n\nAs much as Welles’ is revered in the film and entertainment world, he comes off unlikeable in F For Fake. He is the all-knowing, pedestal sitting man who has come to “tell” this story. Except, he does not really tell anything at all. I feel he is trying to trick us, to help solidify his point: What is made-up and what is not? His point hits right on the nose. F For Fake has you guessing what is real and made up — from Hory’s world and beyond. Welles does not hide that fact, which makes the film incredibly frustrating to watch. Basically, Welles wants us to think: Yeah, I’m going to watch and enjoy your movie, even though I know you are going to lie to me.\n\nWith Welles, however, he is a master showman and presenter. Damn you, Orson Welles! His voice is glue to the words he is speaking. You listen and pay attention when his voice is head — even with the fast paced imagery and annoying music. The cinematic quality of the film is impressive, as well. The scenes are well shot and visually captivating. There are snippets of de Hory’s work and life that incredibly fascinating. The short — I mean lightning paced — cuts make you beg to pay attention. There is no time to sit and ponder the information.\n\nWelles released a 9-minute trailer for the film, which consists of all original content. Huh.\n\nI do not like this movie. Though, understanding what Welles was trying to do and the film being his last hurrah, elevates the film to a level it does not deserve. It is incredibly experimental. F For Fake will leave you empty and wanting a whole lot more. Thankfully, it is only 88 minutes. Sometimes you have to put up with a challenge to enjoy the beautiful things in life.\n\nI think I will go watch The Seventh Seal.\n\nWant more from CineNation?"
