        "text": "Once upon a time, in 2019, I saw Citizen Kane for the first time. In my review of the film, and even in my list of ten classic movies I watched because of my blog, I stated how, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not the flawless masterpiece almost everyone has made it out to be. As you’re reading this introduction, you’re probably wondering, “What does Citizen Kane have to do with July’s theme of Genre Grandeur? That movie isn’t about making movies”. No, it’s not. But the 1999 HBO movie, RKO 281, is. While looking for a title to review for the aforementioned blogathon, I stumbled upon RKO 281, a film I had never heard of prior to the event. When I learned the movie was about the creation of Citizen Kane, I knew I’d appreciate the 1999 project, especially since I saw and wrote about the 1941 film. It also gave me a reason to check out one of HBO’s made-for-tv titles. So, without any delay, let’s start this show of my RKO 281 review!\n\nThings I liked about the film:\n\nThe acting: When we think about a name like Orson Welles, it can sometimes be easy to think of him as more than just a man with a dream. As Orson’s name became a staple of cinematic history, it also became what legends are made of. But Liev Schreiber, the actor portraying Orson, brought humanity back to that name, finding the heart of the “genius” and putting some genuine emotion behind it. While apologizing to Herman Mankiewicz after a falling-out between them, Orson shares a personal recollection about his father. After sharing a part of his soul with his friend, a smile appears on Orson’s face, relieved Herman has agreed to work on Citizen Kane. At the same time, you can see a tear has escaped Orson’s eye. This gives another meaning to Orson’s relief; the burdens of guilt and regret have lifted off his shoulders.\n\nLiev Schreiber is not the only actor to use facial expressions and emotion to their advantage. Portraying William Randolph Hearst, James Cromwell was able to use these tools of acting to present William as more than just the story’s antagonist. When he finds out Citizen Kane is based on him, William is upset by this news. While talking about the situation with a woman named Louella, there is a sharpness to his voice, clearly indicating his bitterness toward the film. But the look in his eyes is that of defeat, questioning how someone was able to successfully build a bridge across the moat of his castle. In this scene, William’s face told more than dialogue could share; a man who gave everyone the impression he was in control, but was really unsure of what the future held.\n\nMarion Davies was the mistress of William Randolph Hearst. Introduced to the audience in a party scene, Marion carried herself with a bubbly personality, almost being mistaken for “ditzy”. But Melanie Griffith prevented Marion from becoming a stereotype or caricature. With a variety of emotions, body language, and facial expressions, Melanie showed Marion as, simply, a woman in a complicated situation. One of my favorite scenes in RKO 281 was when Marion confronted William about his spending habits. Though in a drunken state, Marion addresses some excellent points. As she faces William, her voice is pleading. The desperation in Marion’s voice contains brutal honesty, giving her tone of voice some depth. She never breaks eye contact with William, showing how she isn’t afraid of standing up to “Pops”. Even though she does raise her voice, she only does this to emphasis her points. This scene elaborates how easily someone like Marion could be underestimated. While William saw Marion’s part of their conversation as “excessively theatrical”, I saw it as a woman who knew more about the situation than others were led to believe.\n\nThe set design: I’ve heard Hollywood referred to as the “Land of Dreams”. If that’s true, then the set design in RKO 281 was meant to visually represent a fairy tale! William Randolph Hearst’s castle is one of the most divine sets I’ve ever seen! So many details went into this location, it makes every space of the castle feel larger than life. From the marble fireplace held up by carved marble statues, to the large stained-glass windows boasting intricate colorful designs, to even a bath room with blue and green hued walls, William’s castle is a place beyond imagination. While the castle certainly stole the show, there were other sets that looked great on camera. During RKO 281, Orson travels to New York. In a scene showcasing Orson’s hotel room, his large, wooden bed was smartly paired with a red and beige blanket. The bed isn’t the only wooden piece of furniture in the room, as the desk, matching bedside tables, and even the walls display a warm shade of wood. Because of the tall window, the illusion of the room having a high ceiling is given to the audience. Filling the room with warm light from the lamps and the wall sconces, this high-end hotel room gave off a cozy atmosphere!\n\nThe film-making process: One of my favorite episodes of Murder, She Wrote is ‘Film Flam’. Watching the process of premiering a film is what made that episode fascinating to me. RKO 281 showed a similar process in their story. But this time, the entire film-making process was revealed. Glimpses of how Citizen Kane was made were woven into RKO 281. I learned some things about Citizen Kane because the film-making process was shown. For instance, I didn’t know Orson dug a hole into the floor just to get the shot he wanted. I also didn’t know that filming of Citizen Kane started two days ahead of schedule. It was interesting to see the various components that go into creating a film, especially during a time when technology wasn’t at a film-maker’s disposal. This peek behind Hollywood’s curtain can make one appreciate the work that goes into making a movie.\n\nThe dialogue: There is a lot of work that goes into writing a script. One important area of any script is the creation and delivery of dialogue. As I’ve said in past reviews, dialogue can be hit or miss, especially in a made-for-tv movie. In RKO 281, you can tell there was thought put into the dialogue of the script. In fact, I would go so far as to say the dialogue was, at times, profound. Remember when I said one of my favorite scenes was when Marion confronted William about his spending habits? One of the reasons why I like that scene is because of how well the dialogue was written and delivered. During the confrontation between Marion and William, Marion reminds him of the difference between wanting and needing something. She elaborates on this point by questioning how much a nearby statue cost, not caring about details such as where it was made or the style of the statue, details only William would bring up. Even at the very beginning of this scene, when Marion says, “Millions of dollars a year on art and statues, and there is nothing to explain” illustrates how Marion recognizes the severity of the situation. Meanwhile, as William responds to Marion by stating, “We are in no pickle, as you so euphemistically put it”, the script emphasizes William’s choice to use big words to not only belittle Marion’s intelligence, but also brush his problems under the rug.\n\nWhat I didn’t like about the film:\n\nThe omission of the Breen Code: If you’ve read my movie reviews, you’d sometimes see the term ‘Breen Code’ mentioned in the text. For those unfamiliar with this concept, the Breen Code is a set of moral guidelines that had to be applied to film-making. Movies released between 1934 and 1954 formed the Breen Code era. Because Citizen Kane was released in 1941, I was hoping the Breen Code would play a role in the process of Citizen Kane’s creation. Unfortunately, the Breen Code wasn’t even mentioned. To me, the Breen Code is an underrated component in cinematic history. It would have been nice to hear it referenced in RKO 281’s dialogue.\n\nSome parts of the story not receiving closure: Louella Parsons works for William Randolph Hearst as his “eyes and ears of Hollywood”. After she sees a rough cut of Citizen Kane, she informs William about the film resembling his life. Louella vows to get revenge against Orson for creating the movie, even going so far as to use blackmail in an attempt to cancel the film. But when William’s financial troubles come to light, her role in William’s life seems to have diminished. What happened to Louella after William’s financial situation was made public? Did she still work for him or did she end up working for someone else? This is just one part of RKO 281 that didn’t receive closure.\n\nKeeping track of who’s who: As I mentioned in this review’s introduction, RKO 281 chronicles the creation of Citizen Kane. Therefore, the story follows those individuals connected to the project itself. Throughout the movie, though, members of the film industry from the late 1930s to the early 1940s were brought up in the dialogue. While I was familiar with some of these people, other names I did not recognize. It almost felt like RKO 281’s creative team expected the audience to know the film industry scene of that time. When I watch a film, I want to be told a story. If I end up learning something valuable by watching a movie, I feel that is time well spent. However, I don’t want to feel like I need to do homework prior to watching the film.\n\nMy overall impression:\n\nNot all made-for-tv movies are created equal. Sometimes, a low amount of effort will be given to a made-for-tv production, making a presentation look and feel cheap. But there are made-for-tv projects that are solid, despite the limited resources and finances. RKO 281 is so well-made, it is easy to forget this is an HBO film, as this movie looked and felt theatrical! The creative team behind RKO 281 went above and beyond to make their project the best it could be! From the actors and the screenwriters to the set designers, every person involved with the 1999 movie stepped up their A game and it shows. The style and substance of RKO 281 go hand in hand. While I still don’t believe Citizen Kane is a flawless masterpiece, I’ve gained an appreciation for the efforts it took to make this film exist at all. Toward the end of RKO 281, Orson says “Pretty speeches make history”. If that’s true, then good films leave a lasting impression.\n\nOverall score: 8 out of 10\n\nHave you seen RKO 281 or Citizen Kane? Are there any HBO movies you’d like to see me review? Tell me in the comment section below!\n\nHave fun at the movies!\n\nSally Silverscreen"
