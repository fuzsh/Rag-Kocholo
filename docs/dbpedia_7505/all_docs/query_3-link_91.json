        "text": "Hi Class,\n\nAre you ready to dive into the fascinating world of “Citizen Kane”! This iconic film has left an enduring mark on the history of cinema, and I’m excited to share my thoughts with you all.\n\nFor context, I was excited to take this class because I could finally watch one of the most iconic films of all time “Citizen Kane,” and be able to analyze it and view it in a much deeper way. I went in without context or spoilers, knowing it was a wonderful film and one of my father’s favorites.\n\nOne aspect of “Citizen Kane” that truly struck me was the innovative use of deep-focus cinematography. Deep-focus cinematography is a kind of camera angle that allows the Cinematographer to keep everything in perspective without favoring foreground, mid-ground, or background. Everything is lit and visible.\n\nI highly recommend watching this captivating video above ⬆️⬆️⬆️ that delves into the groundbreaking cinematography of “Citizen Kane.” The video analyzes how Orson Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland revolutionized visual storytelling, making “Citizen Kane” a standout in film history. The video provides engaging insights into how the film elevated ordinary scenes through ingenious cinematography, emphasizing expansive spaces and depth of shots. It particularly focuses on the use of deep-focus photography and wide-angle lenses, offering a visual experience that was unprecedented for its time. The video showcases how deep focus adds depth and complexity to the narrative through specific scene breakdowns. Furthermore, it contrasts “Citizen Kane” with contemporary Hollywood films, illustrating how it defied conventions and opened up new possibilities for future filmmakers. Don’t miss out on this enlightening exploration of cinematic mastery!\n\n—–\n\nThroughout the film, I noted how Welles employed this technique, allowing multiple planes of action to remain in sharp focus within the same frame. This not only gave the film a distinctive visual style but also allowed for a richer storytelling experience.\n\nFor instance, in the scene where young Charles Kane is seen playing in the background while his parents discuss his future, we can clearly see the expressions on their faces while still observing young Kane in the background. This technique cleverly reinforces the complex relationship dynamics at play and sets the stage for the narrative that follows.\n\nMoreover, deep-focus cinematography is pivotal in conveying Kane’s life’s sprawling nature and ever-evolving relationships. The mise-en-scène effectively highlights the grandeur of Xanadu, Kane’s ostentatious mansion, as well as the intimate moments of solitude he experiences within its cavernous halls.\n\nWhat struck me the most is that at the end of the movie, I realized that the house, Xanadu, served as a powerful symbol in the film, representing both retreat and isolation. Welles’ vision of Kane’s journey, retreating from a democracy he can’t control, is starkly captured in the architecture and design of this mansion.\n\nI’m curious to know how this technique resonated with you all. Did you find it effective in enhancing the storytelling, or did it sometimes feel overwhelming? Also, did you notice any specific scenes where deep-focus cinematography stood out?"
