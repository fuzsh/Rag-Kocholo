        "text": "(1915–85). Orson Welles, the maverick “boy wonder” of American theater, experienced fame at a young age. At 23, he was featured on the cover of Time magazine. At 25, he made his debut film, Citizen Kane (1941), which was eventually hailed as a masterpiece and rated one of the greatest films ever made. As a filmmaker, Welles introduced many innovative techniques in cinematic narrative such as layered narrative, deep-focus photography, and the use of sound as a transition device. His baroque style tended to create a cinematic universe in which every human action had severe and usually tragic repercussions. Although his films revolutionized filmmaking and thus film viewing, they were commercial failures, and Welles’s contribution to American cinema was not fully appreciated until the end of his career. Of his disappointing film career, Welles remarked, “I started at the top and worked down.”\n\nGeorge Orson Welles was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on May 6, 1915. A child prodigy gifted in the arts, his talents were encouraged by his mother, a concert pianist. He developed an early interest in theater, and the precocious child staged productions of William Shakespeare’s plays in his home. Young Welles was devastated by his mother’s death in 1925. Shortly after, he was enrolled in a private school in Illinois. When his father died in 1927, Welles became the ward of Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who became a second father to him.\n\nAt school, Welles pursued his interest in theater and directed many of the school’s plays. Upon graduation in 1931, Welles decided not to attend college. Instead, he set off on a sketching tour of Ireland and ended up acting at Dublin’s famous Gate Theatre. Several years later, he returned to the United States and made his Broadway debut as Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet in 1934, the year he also gave his first radio performance. Welles soon became a legend in New York City’s theater crowd for his experimental and offbeat productions of classic plays. He staged an African American production of Shakespeare’s Macbeth for the Negro People’s Theatre in 1936. He collaborated with John Houseman on several controversial productions for the Federal Theater Project, including a modern-dress version of Julius Caesar and a leftist, pro-labor play. In 1937, Welles and Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, and the company became famous for its original, bold productions and cunning use of sound effects.\n\nIn addition to directing plays, Welles was directing the Mercury players in weekly hour-long radio dramas. Once again he stretched the boundaries of the medium, exploiting radio’s intimacy to heighten narrative immediacy, most notoriously in the Oct. 30, 1938, radio dramatization of H.G. Wells’s story “The War of the Worlds.” The broadcast of a simulated Martian invasion was so realistic that it terrorized listeners and led to actual panic throughout the Eastern seaboard. The notoriety of this broadcast brought Welles national attention. Hollywood became interested in his talents, and in 1939 he was hired by RKO Radio Pictures studio.\n\nWelles was given complete artistic control over his first film project, a freedom unheard of at the time. After several false starts, he drew upon his experience in theater and radio to co-write, direct, produce, and star in his extraordinary debut film, Citizen Kane. The film was an American saga of a powerful newspaper tycoon named Charles Foster Kane who brought ruin to all, including himself. Based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, the film supposedly upset Hearst so much that he attempted to stop the postproduction, and then the distribution and exhibition of the film. Hearst was partially responsible—through the influence of his newspaper syndicate and his influence in Hollywood—for the film’s box-office failure despite its success with most movie critics. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, the film won only the award for best original screenplay. After this public failure, RKO quietly retired the film to its vaults. Only in the 1960s was the film revived and Welles recognized for developing an exciting new model for narrative film.\n\nAfter Citizen Kane, Welles never enjoyed a comparable degree of artistic freedom in another Hollywood production. His second film for RKO, The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), was a dark, compelling look at the nature of wealth, class, and progress in early 20th-century America, an era richly evoked by many of the same techniques used in Citizen Kane. The film, radically shortened and edited by the studio, was a commercial and critical failure; Welles and his Mercury staff were dismissed from RKO.\n\nFor the remainder of his film career, Welles spent more time seeking financing for his projects than making them. Welles acted in several films while waiting to make The Lady from Shanghai (1948), which co-starred his then-wife Rita Hayworth. This twisting tale of double-crosses and corrupted innocence was heavily edited by Columbia Studios and finally released two years after its completion. Another commercial and critical failure, it was later recognized as a brilliant variation of the film noir. After the failure of his film version of Macbeth (1948), Welles was branded an erratic filmmaker who could not produce films within budgets or schedules. He made only one more film in the United States, Touch of Evil (1958), which reiterated his overarching vision of the world as an exacting moral network.\n\nIn 1949, Welles left Hollywood for Europe, where he continued to act in other directors’ movies to finance his own. As an actor, Welles was adept at creating villainous antagonists who were often more interesting, complex, or exciting than the protagonists of the films. Some of his most memorable roles were in The Third Man (1949), The Long Hot Summer (1958), and A Man for All Seasons (1966). Between acting engagements, Welles made Othello (1952), which won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival; Mr. Arkadin (1955), a story thematically similar to Citizen Kane; and Chimes at Midnight (1966), a portrait of Falstaff fashioned from five Shakespearean plays. In 1973 Welles made his last film, F for Fake, an exposé of the illusive nature of all art forms."
