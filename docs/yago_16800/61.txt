Manish Gupta, writer of Sarkar and director to The Stoneman Murders is back yet again with a hard-hitting film all about hostel life in India. Ragging, which is a well-known problem in India, has recently caught the eye of many social activists as the number of students who commit suicide after extreme ragging or bullying, simply find themselves helpless. Gupta takes on this serious issue with his upcoming film Hostel. While the cast is relatively unknown, the plot seems relative to current times. Check out a teaser from the film.
