So the court proceedings involve more brain work, thus lending a more cerebral premise for a film.&quot;\n\nManish himself took the onus of the film&#39;s research as he says, &quot;There was no research team. I carried out the research personally and singlehandedly by attending numerous court hearings and interviewing lawyers, court staff members, policemen, etc. I&#39;d already done a heavy amount of research for &#39;Section 375&#39;, so I had a lot of basic research material already with me.&quot;\n\nCommenting on the value that his lead actors Vinay and Ranvir add to the film, he mentions, &quot;Vinay and Ranvir infuse a lot of believability into the narrative. Both are brilliant actors which goes without saying but at the same time, both have the ability to absorb their characters so well that the viewer sees a real person, rather than an actor.&quot; &nbsp;\n\nProbe him if there were a lot of improvisations on the sets, he quips, &quot;Not really, because my scripts are usually written with great clarity. In &#39;420 IPC&#39;, as in all my films, since I was the director as well as the screenplay and dialogue writer, so while writing, I&#39;d already directed the film on paper.&quot;\n\nLooking at his filmography, one can easily say that the filmmaker-writer has a knack for grey stories and characters. Explaining his fascination with grey shades, he furnishes the closing answer, &quot;In reality, no person is completely good or bad. All human beings possess good and bad qualities, although to varying degrees. That&#39;s exactly what I depict in my films.&quot;\n&nbsp;",
