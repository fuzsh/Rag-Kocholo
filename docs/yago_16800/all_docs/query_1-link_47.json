        "text": "One Friday Night has been a quickie for me as a writer-director. I shot the film in 25 days, shooting at a stretch, in one schedule. Unlike all my previous films -- The Stoneman Murders, Rahasya, Section 375 and 420 IPC, the scripting of One Friday Night did not require research because the script was not based on a true criminal case. It was based on an original and fictitious story written by Ramesh Rabindranath and Kamal Chopra.\n\nThe plot is one stormy night, in an isolated villa atop a hill. After an unfortunate mishap, a mistress is forced to call the only person who can save her dying lover - her lover’s own wife - who till now had no idea about her husband’s affair with his mistress. This story holds a mirror to today’s society where extra-marital affairs and infidelity are on the rise at an alarming rate, leading to breaking of homes and ruining of multiple lives. It also shows how materialistic and selfish the younger generation has become that they think nothing of breaking up a home and a well-settled marriage. This message comes across through Vidhi Chitalia’s character who plays the 22-year-old love interest of a 50-plus married man played by Milind Soman. Vidhi’s character is that of a ‘home-breaker’ who has no qualms about being one. But then, her reasoning and justification is that if a man is not happy in his marriage, then he should not continue it.\n\nShooting in the rain. I shot in the months of July and August in the heart of monsoon at Pawna Lake. I shot many scenes in natural rain in order to capture scenic beauty. This was a challenge because rain does not stop or start when you want it to (like a rain machine does – which is what most Indian film-makers use).\n\nI was looking for a female actor in the age group of 47-49 who’s a good actor and has beauty, poise and grace. Raveena Tandon was the obvious choice. For Raveena’s husband’s role, I needed a 50-plus actor but one who is suave, sophisticated, sexy and desirable. Around this time, I saw a video where Milind Soman was talking about his current wife, Anita Konwar, being 25 years younger to him. There! I thought that this gentleman Mr Milind Soman is in real life what my character is on paper! And I cast him quite promptly. Yes, screen tests are a must while casting for a film. I screen-tested Vidhi Chitalia extensively. Since Raveena and Milind have a huge body of work, no screen-test was necessary for them.\n\nIt took me and Raveena Tandon some time to come on the same page on the sets because I’m from a background of realistic and low-budget cinema where every penny and therefore every second on set counts. I work under the pressure of completing the film in a stipulated number of days. Most importantly, I am very strict on the realism portrayed in my films. Whereas Raveena comes from a very strong background of mainstream and high-budget films where budgets are not an issue and where glamour and style take precedence over realism. So, it took Raveena and me a little while to understand and attune to each other’s sensibilities. But once we understood each other, she gave a fantastic performance. She’ll be remembered for her performance in this film for years to come, and award juries will also acknowledge her performance.\n\nAbsolutely, cinema is a very powerful medium. The youth of our country is heavily influenced by screen-culture and they often emulate what they see on screen. That’s why, in all the films directed by me so far, I’ve never used cuss words in the dialogues, nor have I ever used unnecessary blood and gore. My movies always have a direct or indirect social message.\n\nI have finished shooting my next film, which is a very small budget film of which I am both the producer and the director. That film is currently in post-production. Hence, right now, it is too early to reveal any details about it."
