        "text": "It's rightly quoted by Mercy Otis Warren ,\"It may be a mistake, that man, in a state of nature is more disposed to cruelty than courtsey.\"\n\nThe man with a stone heart or The Stone Man is a story of an unidentified serial killer from India who took almost 13-26 lives. This span of killings took place from 1985 - 1987.\n\nThe series of killing started from Mumbai where there were cases of cruel murders mostly taking place at night. The common thing in all the twelve murders were smashed head most probably with a sharp and heavy object assumed to be a stone. The killer would target beggars or homeless ragpickers. Shortly afterwards in 1987 the killer was caught and when asked about the reason he said that he was infertile and so he approached a occultist and he asked him to make sacrifices using a pious object and so he used a stone to kill people in the hope of getting his fertility back.\n\nAnother such series of The Stoneman murder case took place in kolkata. Though it was not the same killer but the killing technique , time of attacks were similar to that of Mumbai case.The people were fear stricken that twelve more deaths will take place. This case of Kolkata remained unsolved.\n\nThe story of cruelty was all because of idiotic superstitious beliefs leading to loss of lives of innocent people. A movie is too based on this story directed by Manish Gupta, starring Arbaz Khan and Kay Kay menon.\n\nWatch the most hilarious video !Why should hot girls have all the fun?"
