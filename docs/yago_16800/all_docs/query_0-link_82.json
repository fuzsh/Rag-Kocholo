        "text": "Writer-Director Manish Gupta's directorial feature film 'One Friday Night' starring Raveena Tandon, Milind Soman and Vidhi Chitalia is all set to release on July 28th on Jio Cinema.\n\nThe trailer of the film has finally released which narrates the story about three characters on one stormy night, stranded inside an isolated villa that’s atop a secluded hill surrounded by a huge lake.\n\nDirector Manish Gupta reveals, \"Narrated through this haunting setting, the story of the film is about ‘Home-breaking’ caused by single young females targeting older and rich married men – that has become a common phenomenon today. Sadly, these young and single women who unabashedly seduce married men have no consideration whatsoever for the families whose lives they are destroying forever. Strangely, such ‘home breakers’ inside their minds do not think that they are doing anything unethical. They feel that if the man is willingly leaving his wife and coming to live with his lover, that means he’s not happy in his marriage.\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/CvEs7p5IbQh/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\n\nDelving deep into the subject of the film he further adds, \"In the film, I have explored in great detail how a ‘home-breaker’ behaves, and how she justifies her own actions. I achieved this through actress Vidhi Chitalia’s character’s behaviour and her manoeuvres throughout the film. Vidhi Chitalia’s character who plays the 22-year old love interest of the 50-plus married man played by Milind Soman has no qualms about being a ‘home-breaker’. Her reasoning and justification are that if her man desires her more than his wife, then he should not continue his marriage, because such a marriage will obviously be unsatisfying and is bound to fail.\"\n\nTalking about a scene from the film, he shared, \"There’s a scene of Raveena Tandon, who’s playing a gynaecologist in the film and is shown handling a complicated birth, I shot this scene inside an actual operation theatre of a maternity home, I showed the hospital’s actual mid-wife assisting Raveena Tandon in the birth instead of using an actor - in order to bring a sense of realism…”\n\nPreviously, writer-director Manish Gupta has delivered many masterful suspense films such as ‘THE STONEMAN MURDERS’, ‘RAHASYA’, ‘SECTION 375’ and ‘420 IPC’, similarly, he has maintained his by-now trademark realistic treatment in ‘ONE FRIDAY NIGHT’ too."
