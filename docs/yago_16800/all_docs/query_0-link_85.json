        "text": "This beautiful weekend we see two Oscar nominated movies Birdman and Foxcatcher. Aren’t we glad they have been released just after the Oscar nominations got over.\n\nBirdman, directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu, had seven nominations at Golden Globe Awards and nine nominations at the Oscars. The story of a superhero, an ex movie man who has one last chance to revive his dying career. Riggan Thomson played by Michael Keaton is an actor who wants to stage his Broadway production and he starts working towards it, hoping to revive his career. The film features Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Zach Galifianakis.\n\nFoxcatcher, directed by Bennet Miller, is also an Oscar and Golden Globe entry with five to six nominations. This is a true story based on the autobiography of Mark Philip Schultz, the two time Olympic World champion freestyle wrestler. The famous and wealthy John du Pont calls upon the Olympic Wrestler Mark Schultz to make a wrestling team and Mark takes this opportunity to try and move away from his own brother Dave who is well known and has always shadowed his brother.\n\nAll three fight to come up to a certain level not knowing that they are eventually stepping towards a mishap from which they will not be able to save themselves. Foxcatcher features Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo and Vanessa Redgrave in the main lead.\n\nThen, we also have Seventh Son which is an epic fantasy film starring Ben James, Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore in the lead roles. Seventh Son is about dark magic and witches where ages ago a fight was lost and now the time for vengeance has come. The movie is based on the book ‘The Spook’s Apprentice’ and directed by Sergei Bodrov.\n\nIn Hindi we have three films:\n\nHawaaizaida, directed by Vibhu Puri, is an interesting concoction of science and comedy. The film brings us the forgotten story of Indian scholar Shivkar Bapuji Talpade, who built the first unmanned plane. The film features Mithun Chakraborty, Ayushmaan Khurana and Pallavi Sharda in the lead roles.\n\nRahasya, directed by Manish Gupta (The Stoneman Murders fame), is inspired by the 2008 Aarushi-Hemraj murder case. The cast features Ashish Vidyarthi, Kay Kay Menon, Tisca Chopra, Ashwini Kalsekar and Mita Vashisht in the lead roles. Full of twists and turns makes Rahasya a tight suspense film with such great actors in tow.\n\nThe last release is Khamoshiyan, directed by Karan Darra, a supernatural horror film. The story of a man who goes to Kashmir for a break from his dreary life. There he meets a mystery woman who is married to a rich industrialist who is ailing. Later on he gets to know that there is a supernatural force behind all the horrors. The film features Ali Fazal, Sapna Pabbi and Gurmeet Chowdhary.\n\nTill next week … ciao."
