        "text": "THREE new movies are slated to release this weekend, Billu Barber starring Irrfan Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, The Stoneman Murders and Jugaad. But the forecast is pretty dull for the coming week.\n\nDistributors are gloomy about Billu, as they say that it is an Irrfan Khan film with only a few cameo appearances from the King Khan.\n\nJugaad, according to Bollywood sources, appears to be a damp squib. And although the premiere of Stoneman was impressive, the promos have just not been enough.\n\nHowever, industry experts opine that if SRKâ€™s role proves to be meaty enough, collections may pick up. SRK has been underplaying his role in the movie, giving Irfan his due credit, but if audiences find his presence strong enough, the movie could do very well indeed.\n\nHowever, Zoom channel film critic Omar Qureshi thinks otherwise. He predicts that Billu is going to be the surprise package of the weekend. For once, it has been directed by ace director Priayadarshan, and for another, it stars Ir rfan Khan who is a brilliant actor opposite Lara Dutta, which pairing is unique and sure to arouse audience interest. For the first time also, Kareena Kapoor, Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra will appear with SRK in three item numbers.\n\nAlthough films with big stars like SRK are sure to do well, smaller films like Jugaad and Stoneman do exist, and should do good business considering that their investment is low making returns easier."
