        "text": "Manish Gupta is an Indian film director and writer in Bollywood. Manish has directed four movies – Rahasya (2015), The Stoneman Murders (2009), Hostel (2011) and Darna Zaroori Hai (2006). And he has written the Story, Screenplay and Dialogues for the movies Sarkar (2005) and Section 375 (2019) amongst many others.\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nManish started his career as a screenwriter. Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Sarkar was Manish’s first film. He next wrote the gangster flick ‘D’ (2006) starring Randeep Hooda. Manish received multiple award nominations for the story, screenplay and dialogues of Sarkar.\n\nManish debuted as a director with Darna Zaroori Hai (2006) in which there were five different stories and a separate director for each story. Manish directed the main story titled ‘Grandma narrates stories to five children’. Manish’s next film as director was The Stoneman Murders (2009) starring Kay Kay Menon and Arbaaz Khan. After that, he directed Hostel (2011) about students’ deaths due to hazing inside college hostels. Manish won the President’s award for the film from the then Indian President Ms. Pratibha Patil.\n\nManish’s next film as director was Rahasya (2015) based on the Aarushi murder case, starring Kay Kay Menon, Tisca Chopra and Ashish Vidyarthi. Rahasya became a sleeper hit that ran for a whopping 106 days (15 weeks) in theatres across India.[citation needed] Manish wrote the 2019 film Section 375, a courtroom drama about a fake rape case, which took Manish three years to research and script. Section 375 was hailed by critics as the best courtroom drama ever made in India.[citation needed] Manish has been nominated for Star Screen Awards 2020 in the Best Dialogue category & 65th Filmfare Awards 2020 in the Best Screenplay category for the movie Section 375.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nManish Gupta all set to Direct next two films\n\nManish Gupta wrote 'SECTION 375' three years ago - Mumbai Mirror 11th Sept 2019\n\nDirector - Manish Gupta's interview with Bombay Times; 1st Oct 2019\n\nYoutube Interview Mid-day 18th Sept 2019\n\nMistaken Identity\n\nRahasya’s extended run\n\nManish Gupta’s next is Sinhasan\n\nNo one signed for Sinhasan\n\nManish Gupta interview, 3 February 2009\n\nTimes of India Movie Reviews\n\nThe-new-Aarushi\n\nMurder they wrote\n\nMurders continue to fascinate filmmakers\n\nTisca to play Nupur Talwar\n\nSakshi sem as aarushi in Rahasya\n\nmanish gupta finds his aarushi\n\nAarushi\n\nRahasya\n\nA sad ending?\n\nBollywood script matches Aarushi verdict\n\nCan Bollywood handle the Truth\n\nBombay Times 3 Dec Page 1\n\nThe big question: Truth or Fiction\n\nRahasya is not a portrayal of authentic events"
