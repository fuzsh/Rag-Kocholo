Sir!\n\nThat man...\n\n- What?\n\nSir...\n\nwhat?\n\nFor the murder of a\n\nworthless beggar...\n\nyou've marked our unit with\n\nthe stigma of a custodial death.\n\nSir, this is no ordinary murder.\n\nIt's the work of a twisted mind.\n\nAnd as far as the\n\ncustodial death goes...\n\nI lost my temper...\n\nI... I'm sorry.\n\nI can't help you now sanjay.\n\nI can't do anything.\n\nYou're being suspended.\n\nSir?\n\nKedar, you're in charge\n\nof this area now. - Sir!\n\nSir, this killer will\n\nstrike again. That's all.\n\nSanjay! Sanjay! Hurry up!\n\nWe're late for the movie.\n\nI'll get your clothes ready.\n\nI've been suspended from duty.\n\nSuspended?\n\nSir, what should be done\n\nabout that roadside killing?\n\nForget it. It's a random killing.\n\nIt won't happen again.\n\nSir, can't the dept.\n\nGive me another chance?\n\nNo, sanjay. You\n\nare out of the force.\n\nSir, off the record, unofficially,\n\ncan't you give me another chance?\n\nI'm very sure i'll\n\nsolve this case, sir.\n\nSir, at the time of the very\n\nfirst murder, i'd warned you...\n\nthat this is a serial killer.\n\nNow five murders have taken place.\n\nAt least believe me now.\n\nLook sanjay, the dept's investigation is on.\n\nBut you can start a\n\nparallel investigation.\n\nDefinitely sir!\n\nIf you solve the case first...\n\nthen i'll get a reason...\n\na basis...\n\nfor recommending you to\n\nbe reinstated in the force.\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nI guarantee you that...\n\nI won't fail you, sir. Like always.\n\nBut, the dept...\n\nwill not help you in\n\nany manner whatsoever.\n\nYes. I know sir. I am ready.\n\nDid anything work out?\n\nMr. Satam has given\n\nme another chance.\n\nThere is a case. If I\n\nsolve it, then maybe...\n\nwhat case is this?\n\nWhy do you want to\n\nknow about the case?\n\nWhy not?\n\nWhen have I ever\n\ndiscussed a case with you?\n\nSanjay sir, come...\n\nhow are you, kamble?\n\n- Fine, sir.\n\nSir, sit.\n\nYour wife's not at home?\n\nSir...\n\nwhat?\n\nKamble! This is your\n\nsecond wife who's run away.\n\nWhat do you do? Do you beat them?\n\nNo, sir! I...\n\nforget it sir. Tell me,\n\nwhat made you come here?\n\nGive me a beedi.\n\nMr. Satam has given\n\nme another chance.\n\nHe has given me the case\n\nof the serial killings.\n\nThe problem is that I\n\nwon't get any official help...\n\nfrom the police dept.\n\nKamble, will you help me?\n\n- Just order me, sir.\n\nThe fir report,\n\ncoroner's post-mortem report,\n\nthe forensic report, photographs...\n\nI want a copy of all the records\n\nthat the ciu has. Can I get them?\n\nI'll try my best, sir.\n\nBut there's a problem.\n\nWhat?\n\nKedar.\n\nKamble! Where are you going?\n\nWhere are you taking these files?\n\nSir... mr. Satam has\n\nasked me to photocopy...\n\nthem and send\n\nthem to his residence.\n\nHe'll study the case there, sir.\n\nCome! Come!\n\nHow are you, sir?\n\n- Fine.\n\nSir, there's a leak in the roof.\n\nI'll get it fixed in a day or two.\n\nI'll do it myself.\n\nSir, all five murders have\n\ntaken place on the harbor line...\n\nbetween soon and matunga...\n\nwithin a radius of 5 kilometers.\n\nEach murder was committed\n\nbetween 10 p.m. In the night...\n\nand 4 a.m. In the morning.\n\nAnd the most\n\nimportant clue is that...\n\nall the murders were committed\n\non a tuesday or a saturday.\n\nNone of us noted this point.\n\nMaybe it's a coincidence.\n\nOr maybe this man's\n\npsychology is like...\n\nhe's someone\n\nwho wants attention.\n\nMaybe he wants to create an\n\nurban legend like jack the ripper.\n\nWhatever it is, I think\n\nhe's challenging the police.\n\nHe's saying:\n\n\"i've done this.\"\n\n\"Now catch me if you can.\"\n\nIf this pattern is correct,\n\nthen he'll strike again...\n\nthis tuesday,\n\ni'll take your leave now.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou'll go home now?\n\nNo, sir. I've got some other work.\n\nLast night...\n\nthis guy I was with last night...\n\nI tell you... what a man he was...\n\nI got tired you know...\n\nbut he didn't...\n\nhey... check out this guy...\n\nclean shaven sissy boy...\n\nhi handsome!

I know...\n\nwho's he?\n\nStoneman!\n\nWe homeless people\n\ncall him stoneman.\n\nGhanshu, I know that.\n\nBut who is he?\n\nDo you suspect anyone?\n\nYes sir. There is\n\none man who I suspect.\n\nOther pavement-dwellers in\n\nthis area suspect him as well.\n\nWhat's his name?\n\nMohammed.\n\nMohammed?\n\nWhere does he live?\n\n- I don't know, sir.\n\nWhat does mohammed do?\n\nHe drives a cab. But only at night.\n\nHe keeps driving his cab\n\nall through the night.\n\nHe's twisted. Everyone fears him.\n\nYes! He keeps circling this\n\narea in his cab, every night.\n\nLike this...\n\nhow are you so sure\n\nthat he's the murderer?\n\nIf I tell you that...\n\nwhy will you need me?\n\nBut sir, in so many years,\n\nhas my information...\n\never turned out wrong?\n\nEven once?\n\nNo, not once.
