        "text": "Prince Craghas Drahar was a Myrish prince-admiral of the Triarchy. He was known as the Crabfeeder for his habit of feeding his surviving enemies to crabs by staking them to the shores during the low tide.\n\nHis occupation and blockade of the Stepstones caught the attention of Lord Corlys Velaryon and Prince Daemon Targaryen, who launched the War for the Stepstones to defeat him. He was killed by Daemon during the siege of Bloodstone.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nCraghas is from the Free City of Myr.[3] He suffers from greyscale which has spread to his face and brain,[4] causing him to wear a mask. The broken mask, which he found in a shipwreck, is of Ghiscari origin - the same kind that would be used by the Sons of the Harpy almost two centuries later.[5]\n\nHouse of the Dragon: Season 1[]\n\nAt a meeting of the Small Council, Corlys Velaryon reports that three of the Free Cities have formed an alliance named the \"Triarchy\", and that Craghas Drahar has styled himself as its prince-admiral.[2]\n\nAs tensions rise, Drahar's forces begin attacking Westerosi ships passing through the Stepstones, including those of the Velaryon fleet. He executes captured crewmen by staking them on beaches to be devoured by carnivorous crabs or be drowned by the tide. In response, Corlys prepares to go to war, convincing Daemon Targaryen to join him.[3]\n\nOver the next two years, Drahar would slowly lose ground during the war. Until his men discovered a way to gain an advantage over the dragons: by hiding in the caves along the coast of the Stepstones to avoid the dragonfire.[1]\n\nTwo years after the start of the war Drahar was besieged at Bloodstone, where he and his men resisted attacks by Daemon's army during the day and launched their own raids on the Velaryon ships at night. While executing prisoners, Daemon arrived on Caraxes. His men forced him to retreat while Drahar hid in his hideout where Caraxes could not get to him.[1]\n\nNews of his growing Drahar victory reached King's Landing, leading many to wonder if the king should help Corlys and Daemon despite their insubordination.[1]\n\nDuring the siege of Bloodstone, Daemon rows alone to the beach, before waving a white flag and offering Dark Sister in an act of surrender. When Drahar walks out of the caves to see if his foe has truly accepted defeat, he is shocked when the Targaryen feigns submission and begins to cut a path through the Triarchy soldiers; Daemon had caused his forces to exit their caves for a counter-attack, allowing Laenor Velaryon to ambush the Triarchy archers with his dragon Seasmoke and letting the Velaryon forces reach the shores unharmed to attack the remaining soldiers.[1]\n\nSeeing his defeat on the horizon, Drahar retreats into a cave but is pursued by Daemon and killed. The Triarchy leader's bisected corpse is later dragged out by Daemon for everyone to see, signifying Daemon's victory over the Crabfeeder.[1]\n\nAfter the war, Daemon uses Drahar's warhammer to stake Triarchy corsairs on the beaches. He later brings it before Viserys, tossing it and telling him to add it to the Iron Throne.[6] Corlys also makes a souvenir of one of Drahar's possessions: his mask, which he displays in the Hall of Nine in High Tide.[7]\n\nIn the books[]\n\nIn Fire & Blood, Craghas Drahar led the Triarchy's military forces in its conquest of the Stepstones. During this campaign he gained the sobriquet \"Crabfeeder\" for executing hundreds of pirates by staking them to be drowned by the tide. There is no mention he suffered from greyscale, or wore a mask.\n\nDue to extremely high tolls enacted by the Triarchy in the region, Corlys Velaryon started a war for the Stepstones, partnering with Daemon Targaryen. After winning many battles for two years, Daemon personally beheaded Craghas with Dark Sister in 108 AC.\n\nAppearances[]\n\n– \"The Heirs of the Dragon\" (mentioned)\n\n– \"The Rogue Prince\"\n\n– \"Second of His Name\"\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes[]\n\n[]"
