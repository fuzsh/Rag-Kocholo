        "text": "It seems murder mysteries and movies go hand in hand. Don’t believe me?\n\nAs the #SheenaBoraMurderMystery has gripped the nation with new revelations every day, we can’t help but be reminded of some of the creepiest murder mysteries we’ve seen at through movies.\n\nNewsMobile lists down a few flicks based on murder mysteries.\n\nThe Stoneman Murders\n\nBack in 1983, then Bombay was caught in a frenzy of stoneman serial murder case. The roadside dwellers were killed brutally while sleeping with the help of big stone that was smashed onto their skulls. The judiciary body could not come with any relevant conclusions and the gruesome killer was never found.\n\nThe Stoneman Murders, directed by Manish Gupta in 2009, is based on the same real life incident. The movie delivers the story of a disturbed, an unbalanced mind, which believes that committing murders would set it free.\n\nRahasya\n\nEveryone is aware of the high profile murder case of Aarushi Talwar and Hemraj in Noida. The case drew nationwide attention when Dr Rajesh and his wife Nupur were judged as the prime suspects of murdering their teenage daughter Aarushi and their domestic help Hemraj.\n\nWhen the parents were finally convicted in 2013, director Manish Gupta returned with this film in 2015, which was loosely based on Aarushi Talwar murder case.\n\nHowever, the film didn’t do well despite a starcast that comprised the likes of Kay Kay Menon, Tisca Chopra and Ashish Vidyarthi. Now, Meghna Gulzar is also making a film on the same case and the film is named ‘Talvar’.\n\nNo One Killed Jessica\n\nIn 1999, a Delhi-based model was shot dead in a pub and all her fault was that she refused to serve drinks. The killer, who was the son of well-known politician, pulled out his gun just to scare her off. However, he ended up shooting the model – Jessica Lal – right in the head.\n\nDirected by Rajkumar Gupta, ‘No One Killed Jessica’ is based on the actual incident starring Rani Mukherjee. The movie displays the legal procedure in a mocking way, the ambivalence in the judiciary system, the power of politics and corruption overall and the susceptibility of the common man.\n\nNot a Love Story\n\nYou can’t ignore Ram Gopal Varma when it comes to making films on real-life stories. ‘Not a Love Story’ is a 2011 Indian crime-thriller inspired by the gruesome murder of Neeraj Grover in 2008 that led to the arrest of M L Jerome and Maria Susairaj.\n\nThe film stars Mahi Gill, Deepak Dobriyal and Ajay Gehi. The barbaric and blood-stained story of how love becomes an obsession and can lead to a crime, send chills down the spine.\n\nShahid\n\nIn 2008, a renowned Indian lawyer and Muslim rights activist, Shahid Azmi, was pumped with bullets to death at his office and this creation of Hansal Mehta is absolutely thought provoking.\n\nThe movie is based on the life of Azmi, played by Rajkumar Rao, who leads a normal married life in Mumbai and at the same time defends his community people who are tainted with acquisitions of Islamic terrorism.\n\nRao, even went on to win the National Award for his performance in the film.\n\nZodiac\n\nStariing Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr, Zodiac is a 2007 American mystery-thriller film directed by David Fincher and based on Robert Graysmith’s non-fiction book of the same name.\n\nDavid Fincher has never ceased to come out with brilliant thrillers. His film Zodiac is a thorough exhibit of extreme detailed true events. This movie takes us back to the ‘60s and early ‘70s where a serial killer named Zodiac murdered people leaving hints for investigation. However, the mystery still lays unsolved even today.\n\nChallenging\n\nClint Eastwood brought to light a very old thriller plot which is actually based on true events. In the 1920s a crime story riveted Los Angeles where you come across a serial killer, a child disappears and a mother insist on finding out the truth.\n\nThe story involves many outlandish and strange twist and turns. The movie portrays how son of Christine Collins fall victim to the Wineville Chicken Murders.\n\nSnowtown"
