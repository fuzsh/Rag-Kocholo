        "text": "It seems Abhishek Bachchan only wants to work in films made by A-list filmmakers. That’s the reason why he turns down offers made by lesser-known filmmakers.\n\nAnd this has irked director Manish Gupta.\n\nManish had approached Abhishek for Saab Chai Pani, but the actor promptly declined to work in the film, without even reading the script. Manish finally had to settle with Sonu Sood.\n\n“My first choice was Abhishek. But he replied in the negative. So I opted for Sonu. Sometimes you may like one script and not the other. But if Abhishek could do Drona, then I think he could have obliged me too,” said the director.\n\nBut Manish is not the kind to be bogged down by setbacks.\n\nIn fact, he has bigger plans for himself. “I’m now planning to do a film with Amitabh Bachchan. He is my favourite star since childhood. Until and unless I work with Amitabh, I will never be satisfied. Directing him will be a dream come true for me,” he said.\n\nWhether Big B will give the nod, unlike his son, is something only time will tell. For now, Manish is awaiting the verdict on his debut film, The Stoneman Murders, based on the serial killings which took place in Mumbai in 1983.\n\nSaab Chai Pani, his second directorial venture, has been delayed. And the reason, according to Manish, is better known to the producers.\n\nadvertisement"
