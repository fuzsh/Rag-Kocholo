        "text": "There are some films which unintentionally create more plotholes in their pursuit of shocking the audience with more plot twists than required. Such films make one feel very unsatisfied and cheated. The Korean horror film The Wailing was one such film. This is another.\n\nwonderful, economic b movie filmmaking, imagining and reclaiming a lost city space as place for genre, mystery, and the genuinely unsettling. some great sequences (that failed chase at the train station late in the film is my favorite) but what lingers are the streets, the empty sidewalks, the lights, the hangdog way everybody walks through life here, how much the film feels like an exorcism of what might be forgotten.\n\nUnnecessary polic politics was pushed. It had many loopholes.\n\nThough acting was nice and story of a tribe somehow worked. But I was expecting more from this psychological thriller.\n\nKay Kay Menon shines in his role, as always. Otherwise, this film is such a wasted opportunity that could‚Äôve used some really accomplished direction. The final reveal is so obvious that anyone who has seen enough thrillers could see it coming a mile away.\n\nPretty good serial killer movie from India. Based (albeit very loosely) on the real-life \"Stoneman\" killings in the 1980's. Great acting, and a tense, suspenseful atmosphere in those night scenes. Could have been a masterpiece with a more nuanced screenplay and a less hard-rocking soundtrack. Still, well worth a watch for fans of crime films and international cinema.\n\nKK!‚ù§Ô∏è This movie can be better but still this movie is highly underrated! Watch it if you love serial killer movie. It's really good.\n\nAs usual amazing performance from KK Menon. I have become his fan. He is brilliant in cop roles.\n\n3.5/5* üëç\n\nThere's absolutely no way you can guess all the madness and twists in the concluding 40 minutes, simply brilliant\n\nExceptional performance yet again from Kay Kay Menon\n\nShort and Crisp Screenplay makes it a really engaging watch"
