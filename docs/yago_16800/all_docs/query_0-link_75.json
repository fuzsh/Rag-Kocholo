        "text": "Starring Raveena Tandon, Milind Soman and Vidhi Chitalia, JioCinema’s upcoming suspense thriller film One Friday Night - helmed by writer-director Manish Gupta - will start streaming on the OTT platform from July 28.\n\nThe recently released trailer of the film hints at a story about three characters that unfolds on a stormy night, as they are stranded inside an isolated villa atop a secluded hill surrounded by a huge lake.\n\nSpeaking about the plot, Manish said, “Set against an eerie backdrop, the story is about a ‘home-wrecker’ who is accused of targeting a rich married man, much older than her. The narrative focuses on how such relationships impact their families and destroy people’s lives forever.”\n\nAlso read: OTTplay Awards 2022: Raveena Tandon wins the award for Best Actor Female in Series (Popular) for Aranyak\n\nDelving deeper into the plot, the director said, “In the film, we have explored how a ‘home-wrecker’ behaves, and how she justifies her own actions. I achieved this through the character played by Vidhi Chitalia. She plays the 22-year-old love interest of a 50+ married man, played by Milind Soman.”\n\nPreviously, Manish has helmed movies like The Stoneman Murders, Rahasya, Section 375 and 420 IPC.\n\nRaveena narrates the character of a gynaecologist in the film. Sharing a moment from the set, Manish said, “There’s a scene in the movie, in which Raveena is shown handling a complicated birth. I shot it inside an actual operation theatre of a maternity home. To keep it more realistic, I showed the hospital’s actual midwives assisting Raveena.” Other members of the cast include Hemant K Gaur, Ambrish Saxena and Govind Bhai."
