        "text": "Different to the western Catholic Church\n\nThey are both Catholic and must be subject to the Pope. The difference is in their backgrounds. Some things are done differently like the eastern rite say their Mass in Ukrainian or Greek, etc, whereas Western Rite used to always say theirs in Latin. Not only are they both subject to the Pope, but both must follow and profess all of the dogmas and doctrines of the Church. The Eastern Rite Catholics are part of the Roman Catholic Church, not the Orthodox Church. While the majority of Roman Catholics belong to the Latin Rite, the Eastern Rites provide a special length to our Catholic heritage and spirituality.\n\nSources: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080814073249AARNKTu\n\nhttp://catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0246.html\n\nThe rite that the church belongs too\n\nThe Maronite church belongs to syro-antiochene the one holy catholic and apostolic church. source: http://www.maronitejerusalem.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=13&Itemid=17\n\nThe significance of icons in church\n\nThe word \"icon\" is originally Greek and means image, likeness, persona, figure, or portrait.

It opens the door to the Christian belief and to the opportunity to receive other sacraments. Through the sacraments of Baptism a person (usually an infant) is washed clean of sins and becomes part of the priestly community, a child of God, brother of Jesus, temple of the Holy Spirit, and a sharer in the heavenly life. Without baptism, none of the other sacraments of the church could ever be received.\n\nsource: http://ololc.org/baptism.html\n\nhttp://www.catholic.com/tracts/infant-baptism\n\nConfirmation/chrismation\n\nThe celebration of the sacrament of Chrismation closures the call to life for, in and through Christ, and intensifies what Baptism when it is time to make your confirmation 13-15, it is your choice confirming that you yourself wish to be a Catholic.\n\nsource: http://resource.fraynework.com.au/object.cfm?o=205&pid=1475\n\nEucharist\n\nThe Eucharist is the centre of life and source of nourishment for all Christians it brings the Church together and unites us to one another in love of Christ. The usual age is between 6-7, this means that after they were baptised it is confirming that you are still in the Catholic faith.\n\nsource: http://www.adelaide.catholic.org.au/our-faith/sacraments/eucharist-holy-communion-\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nThe maronite church is one of the largest Eastern-rite communities of the Roman Catholic church\n\nThe Maronite Church professes the same faith and beliefs of the One, Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.\n\nThe Maronite Church is one of 22 churches within the one universal Catholic Church.\n\nThe father of the Maronite Church was a holy monk and hermit, Maron, who lived from 350-410 AD.\n\nsource: johnrobertg.global2.vic.edu.au/files/.../Maronite-Church-18r63ys.pptx"
