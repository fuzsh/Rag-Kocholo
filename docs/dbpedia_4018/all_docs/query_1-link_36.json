NPR used this most likely to separate the Maronites from the diversity pool that is Lebanon.\n\n\"Maintain close ties to European Catholics, especially in France.\"\n\n- This is quite accurate. If you listen to the program you do hear about the historical influence of France. French is commonly spoken by Maronites, Lebanese at that, and the ties to the French are still remarkably strong. Nothing wrong with this statement.\n\nLack of use of the word \"Catholic\"\n\n- Maronites do not refer to themselves as \"Maronite Catholics,\" normally it is either \"Maronite Christian\" or simply Maronites. Originally, it was simply stating that you were Beit Maroun, or of the house of Maroun. Really not an issue. The identity of Maronite Catholic is a product of the diaspora, I believe.\n\nLast edited by Beit Maroun; 07:16 PM.\n\nModerator\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 4,331\n\nLikes: 23\n\nA Simple Sinner,\n\nThis is a prime of example of the fallacy of the statement: Catholic first, Eastern second.

Likewise, one can only be Catholic by being Latin, Byzantine, Maronite, etc. Just as there is no generic, non-gendered human there is no generic, non-particular Catholic even though there are beliefs all Catholic traditions share. For the Maronites the name implies both their particular tradition and their union with Rome. To say Maronite Catholic to them is redundant. Maronite says it all.\n\nFr.

I just find it exceedingly odd that the story on NPR makes no mention of the communion that exists as though it is not kind of a big thing.

Remember, this is also a three part series, let's see what else might come forth. In the mean time, however, remember that it is incredibly difficult to cram a tradition full of mystery, history and a lot of controversy into 6 minutes when the focus is the political ramifications in Lebanon of the 20 and 21 century. If NPR suddenly called them \"catholic\" then listeners would no doubt (on no fault of their own) conjure some image of the \"Roman Catholic Church\" for that is all the Catholic church is to mainstream society. Granted, that begs, can't this be the means to change that, yes, but not in 6 minutes when discussing socio-political commentary.\n\nQuote\n\nIf you are introducing Maronites to the world it seems relevant.

However, I certainly agree with your objection regarding, \"This Christian denomination is found only in Lebanon...\" though I know there are no official documents released by the church in Lebanon regarding diasporic numbers.\n\nBANNED\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 186\n\nOriginally Posted by Fr.

Deacon, that is like Saying Russian Orthodox first, Orthodox second. I mean absolutely specify that they are Maronite but leaving out the Catholic part just because they are not Roman is very wrong imo.\n\nMainstream Americans may just think the Maronites are just an independent Church with close ties to Catholicism. It only takes a moment to explain they are Eastern Catholic and what an Eastern Catholic is.\n\nLast edited by Zan; 12:26 PM.\n\nJunior Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 15\n\nZan,\n\nWith all do respect, I will emphasize Abouna's point again: for a Maronite, the \"Catholic\" understanding is implicit in their name. You must also understand that back in Lebanon, what translates as \"Roman Catholic\" is actually the name of the Melkite Greek Catholics.\n\nI disagree with you, it is not saying Oriental first, Catholic second, they are one in the same, completely in line with the 'universal' definition of what 'Catholic' means.\n\nNPR actually represented fairly well how most Maronites back in Lebanon see themselves: Maronite Christians, for the Christian emphasis is more important to separate themselves from their Druze and Moslem brothers and sisters, as the Catholic understanding is implicit in their relations.\n\nPlease do not judge this situation as some sort of denial or lack of pride of their Catholic status, you are simply ignorant of the cultural identity Maronites see themselves in. Within the United States, the Maronite community is a different story, they don't need to distinguish as Christian, they have to distinguish amongst Christians, hence the redundant adaptation of 'Maronite Catholic.'\n\nAs a Maronite spending a lifetime explaining his church and communion, I pray for the day it only takes a minute explaining the Eastern and Oriental Catholic Churches. Add to that, most Eastern and Oriental Catholics struggle with the concept of what an Eastern Catholic is themselves.\n\nJunior Member\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 15\n\nOriginally Posted by Slavipodvizhnik\n\nAs there is no Orthodox equivalent of the Maronite Church, I fail to see where the need to identify them as Catholics is required. I mean, what else could they be? Who could they be confused with? The situation is slightly different than in most of Eastern Europe where Catholic and Orthodox Churches exist side by side, using the same Rite.\n\nYet another good point. Again, at one time, the Maronites where their own line of Christian transmission, and prior to their isolation there was no distinction between \"Orthodox\" and \"Catholic.\" I do find it humorous to think that an entire people missed out on the Great Schism.\n\nI personally believe that there is a new current in the Diaspora to pronounce catholicity in an effort to affirm Catholic identity. To me, it makes more sense to pronounce myself as \"Maronite!\" than \"Maronite Catholic!\" least of all to ensure that people understand my being Catholic as something inseparable from who I am, and not merely an appendage to distinguish \"Oriental\" from the proceeding \"Catholic.\"\n\nLast edited by Beit Maroun; 09:50 PM."
