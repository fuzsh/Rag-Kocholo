        "text": "Lebanese Cardinal Béchara Boutros Raï, the Maronite Catholic Patriarch of Antioch, has endorsed a document put together by an ecumenical team of specialists and Church representatives in theology, social studies and geopolitical issues to better live Christianity in the Middle East.\n\n\"This document offers us a course to follow in all the events of our lives. The subject is the presence of Christ himself in the Middle East. The document also offers a platform to examine the emergencies and problems that affect the family, the Church, the State and society,\" said the Maronite patriarch.\n\nThe document entitled \"Christians in the Middle East: Towards the Renewal of Theological, Societal and Political Choices\" finds full support of the Maronite Patriarchate, which takes it up and offers everyone, as a true companion on the road, a precious tool to promote, he said.\n\nCardinal Raï made those comments March 30 when the document was presented and discussed during a symposium organized in Bkerké, at the headquarters of the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch, located northeast of Beirut, Lebanon, Fides reported.\n\nCardinal Raï, extolling the strengths of the document, described it as a concrete and realistic diagnosis of the current condition of Christian communities of the Middle East, taking into account the past history, the theological and liturgical traditions of the Churches of the Middle East and the current context of the Middle East, with its lights and shadows.\n\nThe document exposes without rejection the factors of crisis which mark the present and the future of the Christian communities of the Middle East, then suggests with courage and prophetic spirit the ways to be followed and the changes to be experienced in order to preserve the vitality of the Christian presence in the Middle East and its fruitful contribution to the good of the peoples of the Middle East, said the Maronite patriarch.\n\n\"We choose life\"\n\nThe document is the work of a group of 11 experts that came together under the name \"Nakhtar al Hayat\" (\"We choose life\") to offer a systematic attempt to consider in depth the present condition of Christian communities in the Arab-Middle Eastern context.\n\nThe authors were men and women, ordained ministers and lay people, who wanted to discuss frankly and freely, even \"on matters which some may consider unsuitable for public debate\".\n\nIt included among others, Professor Souraya Bechaalany, former General Secretary of the Middle East Council of Churches, the Lebanese Greek-Melkite theologian Gabriel Hachem, member of the International Theological Commission, and Maronite priest Rouphael Zgheib, National Director of the Pontifical Mission Societies of Lebanon.\n\nThe document is the result of years of reflection and studies by the ecumenical group. The common reflection was shared by Christians belonging to different countries and various Churches and ecclesial denominations of the Middle East, including Maronites, Anglicans, Greek-Catholics and Greek-Orthodox.\n\nThe team adopted a formula echoing a verse from Deuteronomy (\"We choose life in abundance\").\n\nThe document, divided into 100 paragraphs, presents itself as a systematic attempt to examine in depth the current situation and the future prospects of Christian communities in the Arab and Middle Eastern context.\n\nIt emphasizes that the most insidious risk for the current Middle Eastern Christian communities consists in the \"reductionist approach based exclusively on the logic of the majority and the minority\".\n\nA distorted reading of reality pushes some to seek protection \"through an 'alliance of minorities', seeing in this a guarantee of a continuous Christian presence in the Middle East\".\n\nAuthors of the document argue that this in the long run \"distorts a genuine Christian witness\", which is based \"not on the use of religion as a political tool, nor on claiming specific rights or privileges to maintain a rigid identity, but rather on opening up to the other in dialogue\".\n\nTheologians of Nakhtar al Hayat had addressed the issue of women’s place in local churches.\n\n\"Most of the historical Churches of the Middle East\" the authors of the text noted \"are patriarchal” and that communities of the East need to be recovered today, while \"unfortunately today in our Churches we often see the people of God -- especially women and young people -- marginalized in important decisions.\"\n\n\"We often see the growth of an authoritarian spirit, which cancels shared responsibility, balanced government and the spirit of responsibility between people and their pastors\", they said.\n\nThe document does away with the stereotypes portrayed in the Western media regarding Middle Eastern Christian communities as persecuted minorities and in need of external protection, of a financial or geopolitical nature.\n\nIt highlights some ecclesial realities which \"in order to obtain aid from of certain American and European Christian groups, adopt discourses hostile to “living together”, moreover exaggerating the distress of Christians in the Middle East, whom they portray as being the victims of a persecution targeted and orchestrated by Muslims\".\n\nOther ecclesial subjects rely on the strategy of the \"alliance between minorities\" or on the protection of authoritarian regimes as the only means of ensuring the survival of indigenous Christian communities in the Middle East.\n\nThese are misleading choices and orientations, which risk weighing negatively on the future of Christian presence in the Middle East and denying the very mission to which the Church called in this part of the world has today dedicated her earthly life, the authors said.\n\nA work to be taken seriously\n\nThe authors had hoped for their work to be taken seriously by all heads of the Eastern Churches as well as the Council of Churches of the Middle East.\n\nIt received wide attention and positive comments from authoritative representatives of Catholic communities in the Middle East, including the Chaldean Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako and Archbishop Michel Sabbah, retired Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem.\n\nCardinal Raï’s endorsement carries much weight as the Maronite Church, one of the principal churches in the Middle East, is an Eastern Catholic sui iuris church in full communion with the pope and the worldwide Catholic Church, with self-governance under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches.\n\nMembers of the Maronite Church are the disciples of Saint Maron, a monk and hermit, who died around 423.\n\nThese Christians date back to historical Syria, to the Patriarchate of Antioch, one of the three patriarchates of the early Church, along with Rome and Alexandria.\n\nThey took refuge in the Lebanese mountains at the time of the Muslim invasion in the 7th Century and were constituted as Patriarchates in 685.\n\nThe Maronite Church is an exception among Eastern Churches, marked by separations and reunifications but always remaining united with Rome.\n\nHeir to a line of 76 patriarchs, Patriarch Raï was appointed head of the Maronite Church in March 2011. He was made a cardinal the next year.\n\nTheir West Syriac rite, is one of the oldest Eastern rites. Maronite Christians, who represent one of the largest Christian communities in the East, celebrate mainly in Arabic."
