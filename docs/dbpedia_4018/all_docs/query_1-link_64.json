        "text": "The Maronite Family of faith welcomes you with peace, joy and love. We invite you to join us. Ahla w salah we say in Arabic (You are most welcome, our home is yours.)\n\nMaronite spirituality, liturgy and traditions come from Antioch-Edessa, Syria as they were known in the Roman Empire at the time of Christ. The Aramaic language, used in liturgy, is the same language Jesus spoke during his earthly life and ministry.\n\nThe Maronite Church, one of the oldest churches of Catholicism, was led by Saint Maron, a priest (350-410 AD) who devotedly taught the Catholic faith, and ministered to many people with his gifts of healing and counsel. Today in the U.S.A. there are two eparchies (Dioceses) made up of about 75,000 Maronite Catholics. We are in union with Rome and are part of the one true Catholic Church."
