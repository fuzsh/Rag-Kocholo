        "text": "Lebanese Maronite Christians (Arabic: المسيحية المارونية في لبنان; Classical Syriac: ܡܫܝܚܝ̈ܐ ܡܪ̈ܘܢܝܐ ܕܠܒܢܢ) refers to Lebanese people who are members of the Maronite Church in Lebanon, the largest Christian denomination in the country.[1] The Lebanese Maronite population is concentrated mainly in Mount Lebanon and East Beirut.[2] They are believed to constitute about 30% of the total population of Lebanon.[1]\n\nQuick Facts Languages, Religion ...\n\nClose\n\nThe Maronite Catholics and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century through the ruling and social system known as the \"Maronite–Druze dualism\".[3] The 1860 Druze–Maronite conflict led to the establishment of Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, an autonomous entity within the Ottoman Empire dominated by Maronites and protected by European powers. In the aftermath of the First World War, the Maronites successfully campaigned for Greater Lebanon carved out from Mount Lebanon and neighboring areas. Under the French Mandate, and until the end of the Second World War, the Maronites gained substantial influence. Post-independence, they dominated Lebanese politics until the 1975–1990 civil war, which ended their supremacy. While the Taif Accords weakened Maronite influence, it endures alongside other dominant Lebanese communities, such as the Shiites and Sunnis.[2]"
