        "text": "This volume, intended for general readers, but especially Catholic Americans and for Americans of Syrian descent, covers the history and characteristics of the Maronite Church. Introductory chapters touch on the regions of its birthplace, Syria and Mt. Lebanon, on Aramaic, and on early Syrian liturgies. Subsequent parts of the work trace the Maronitesâ€™ interaction with other Christian denominations and with Muslims. The period of the Crusades and into the 16th century are also discussed in particular, before the last half of the book covers in some detail more recent centuries, with a final chapter on relations with Rome. A number of photographs of personalities are included. There are not a great number of works in English dealing with Maronite history, but this volume, now made easily available, can be added to that number."
