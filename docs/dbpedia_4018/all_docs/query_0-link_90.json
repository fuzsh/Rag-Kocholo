        "text": "For Nancy Farrah, a resident of Alma Al-Chaab, a village near the border in southern Lebanon, burnt olive groves and damaged homes are only a portent of worse things to come if the situation on the Lebanon-Israel border combusts into a full-scale war.\n\n\"I returned to the village on October 25 after leaving for Beirut due to the Israeli bombings and intense fires,\" says Nancy Farrah, the resident from Alma Al-Chaab. Along with the Sunni town of Dhayra, the Christian locality is one of the hardest-hit in recent clashes between the Shia group Hezbollah that exerts control over southern Lebanon and Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The olive groves were completely burned, it's a tragedy… Many houses were damaged\", she testifies. In this village of 800 people, only \"120 people have remained to watch over the area and prevent thefts,\" says Nancy Farrah.\n\nClosure of institutions\n\nVincent Gelot, director of Œuvre d’Orient in Lebanon and Syria, felt this underlying concern during a October 26 tour with Maronite Archbishop Charbel Abdallah of Tyre to Christian villages in Qaouza, Rmeich, Aïn Ebel, and Debel.\n\n\"They feel vulnerable to Israeli bombings, even though their villages haven't been directly hit yet,\" says Gelot, who heads the local Catholic aid organization that assists Eastern Christians. \"It's a real exodus… They've lost about 60% of their residents, as families have left… Schools are closed,\" he says. Given the extremely volatile situation, the Lebanese Ministry of Education has since October 10 ordered the closure of institutions near the border region.\n\nPalestinian militants initiated hostilities from Lebanon shortly after Hamas' October 7 unexpected attack, firing rockets that were intercepted over Israel. In response, Israel conducted artillery fire into Lebanese territory, including targeting Hezbollah positions. Subsequently, Hezbollah launched missiles into Israel's northernmost region. This cycle of violence has since continued.\n\n\"Aïn Ebel is empty, 80% of the residents have left,\" confirms Sister Maya Beaino, who runs the Saints-Coeurs School in Aïn Ebel, a pillar of Francophony in the region. This school, which normally enrolls 1,000 students, equally split between Muslims and Christians from 34 villages, is concerned.\n\n\"The 15% to 20% of families with income in dollars have enrolled their children in schools in the capital. I don't know if they will return to the village and, especially, when,\" worries the nun. Already, the issue of paying salaries to teachers who have been teaching online since the school's closure on October 9 is pressing. \"I need at least US$45,000 for salaries. I can manage for one month, and after that, I don't know,\" warns Sister Maya, as some parents, deprived of income by the war, are already asking her to spread the school fees over the next seven months.\n\nBesides this issue, the urgency is to keep this institution, which was established 150 years ago, open. \"It's an existential issue,\" emphasizes the nun, as Israeli airstrikes resume on the hills near the village. \"The school ensures interfaith dialogue in the region. If we close, at least 500 families will sell their land and leave,\" she says.\n\nLack of Church support\n\nArchbishop Abdallah echoes these concerns. \"Economic life has almost come to a halt, including in schools, and what gives life to our parish is the schools,\" he adds. \"If the children from these villages continue to be educated in Beirut, it could lead to a demographic shift,\" he fears.\n\nIsolated in her village five kilometers from the border, Sister Maya criticizes the Church’s complete absence of support since the start of tensions. \"No one has called, except for the Latin Bishop of Beirut, César Essayan, who sent some food parcels to the needy,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm trying to be there for my parishioners. What matters is everyone's internal security,\" says Bishop Abdallah. \"When there's war, neither the patriarchate nor the archbishopric can perform miracles.\"\n\nAs bombings intensify, villagers feel abandoned. \"There's a genuine anxiety about the future among the residents, who are already weakened by the economic crisis,\" observes Gelot. \"Those who have stayed cannot harvest their crops due to the bombings,\" he says.\n\nHelp from Œuvre d'Orient\n\nOther material problems are compounded by the proximity of the war. \"People are worried because their needs aren't met, for drinking water or healthcare,\" says the Maronite Archbishop of Tyre. \"In the municipalities of Debel, Qaouza, Aïn Ebel, Rmeich, and Alma Al-Chaab, there are no clinics, and if there are, they are not equipped to handle a war,\" says Archbishop Abdallah.\n\n\"We will launch a collection with Œuvre d'Orient to provide them with fuel, medication, food, and support the schools as well,\" announces Gelot, who underscores the importance of sending positive signals to these vulnerable populations, now more than ever."
