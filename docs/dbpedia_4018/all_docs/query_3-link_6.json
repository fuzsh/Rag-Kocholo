Antoine Beshaalany\n\n​​\n\n​The original Arabic article can be read HERE.\n\nIcon of Saint Maron, Father of the Maronite Church.\n\nThe elements of the identity, vocation, and mission of the Maronite Church form, combined, the living heritage that marks her uniqueness within the universal Church in experiencing the Mystery of salvation in Jesus Christ and in witnessing to this Mystery within the Patriarchal territory and the countries of expansion.\n\nAbove all, the Patriarchal Maronite Church is an actualization of the Mystery of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church in the particular milieu in which she is called to witness to her apostolic faith and biblical values.\n\n​\n\nFor the Maronite Church, returning to the common heritage of all Antiochene and Syriac Churches is an ecumenical commitment that contributes to recovering full unity between all these Churches."
