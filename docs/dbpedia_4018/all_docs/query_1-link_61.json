        "text": "About Us\n\nSt. George welcomes all who seek to worship and know Christ, Our Lord and Savior. We are a small community of faith full of love and communal worship and kindness. Our Sunday celebration is in English and Syriac, the original language of Christ!\n\nThe Maronite Church dates back to the early christians of Antioch where “they were called christians for the the first time” (Acts 11:26). The Maronite Church is known for her love and devotion to the See of Peter in Rome.\n\nThis relationship has allowed Maronites to fully express the Catholic Faith held from the beginning and at the same time be part of the balance between East and West.\n\nThe maronite Church is tied to Lebanon, her spiritual homeland and the land of her patriarch and people.\n\nSaith George Catholic Church Maronite Rite was founded by a group of dedicated Lebanese immigrants who came to the United States in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s. These people were of limited financial means and worked diligently and sacrificed a lot to establish this Church.\n\nWe hope you will become a part of our community.\n\nTo learn more about the Maronite Community:"
