        "text": "Prince Gharios of Ghassan Explains Why Situation Facing Region’s Christians Compares to ‘Patient With Cardiac Arrest’ (original article HERE) by Deborah Castellano Lubov\n\nHis Imperial and Royal Highness Prince Gharios of Ghassan says it is urgent to create one voice for the Middle Eastern Christians and there is a concrete way and structure that can achieve this.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ZENIT following his recent visits to the Vatican where he met Pope Francis and cardinals, Prince Gharios, the legitimate head of the house of Ghassan, the only Middle Eastern Christian dynasty still alive, spoke on what is needed to help save Middle Eastern Christianity, which–he believes–currently can be compared to «a patient with cardiac arrest.»\n\nThe royal also shared why he believes a prince needs to be close to the people, «getting his hands dirty,» and says until his last breath, he’ll keep working worldwide to protect the Christians in the Middle East.\n\nBorn in Brazil, the prince moved to Los Angeles mostly for security reasons, saying the violence in the South American nation was unbearable. He established a residence in Jordan to help people from all over the region. His father’s mother’s family was Greek Orthodox and his father’s father, Maronite. When they arrived in southern Brazil, there was no Maronite church in their city, so they started going to a Roman Catholic Church. Raised primarily in an Italian household, Prince Gharios is a proud Roman Catholic.\n\nPrince Gharios has received many formal and informal recognitions from governments and authorities all over the world. In 2014, he received United States Special Congressional Recognition. He also was invested into the Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the very few papal orders of knighthood, and has been recognized by His Holiness Pope Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church, several Middle Eastern Christian and Muslim religious leaders, as well as political leaders.\n\nThe House of Ghassan is the oldest Arab dynasty in Christendom and the one that ruled more territory and during the longest period of time. Current well-known Ghassanids in the Church include the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Patriarch Fouad Twal, and the Patriarchal Vicar for Jordan of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, Archbishop Maroun Lahham.\n\n***\n\nZENIT: In Jordan, you discovered your role to essentially become a spokesman of the persecuted Christians. What inspired you and what entitles you to fulfill this mission?\n\nPrince Gharios: First, the urgency of the matter. With the current rate of persecution and migration we don’t have much time, may be 20 years before there will be no Christians anymore in the Middle East. Please remember that these lands are the cradle of Christianity, these are the oldest Churches, and they are dying in front of our eyes. I fully agree with Pope Francis when he criticizes the «globalization of indifference» and teaches an «ecumenism of the blood». Actually, I see in his words a personal appeal. I can’t ignore them, not only because my roots are there, but because my position, currently the only secular office with historical legitimacy and the duty of protecting not only my people but all the Christians.\n\nZENIT: Could you tell us more about the situation of the persecuted Christians and the threats they face?\n\nPrince Gharios: There’s not only the notorious actual persecution, but also economic reasons that make Christians migrate to other countries. Being able to help the Syrian, Palestinian and Iraqi refugees, also with the Lebanese and Egyptian people, to listen to their tragedies and witness their tears gave me a unique first hand understanding of the situation and its urgency. We have to act now. I compare Middle Eastern Christianity with a patient with cardiac arrest, we need to defibrillate with a powerful shock in order to save the patient.\n\nZENIT: What are your plans to help them? Is there some concrete action that can be done? Have you received support from other Christian denominations, any Bishops or Patriarchs of the East?\n\nPrince Gharios: It’s urgent to create one voice for the Middle Eastern Christians. My plan is the creation of a Council based on UN standards and with UN representation, congregating all of the Christian denominations present in the Middle East as an assembly, which would take care of Christian interests in the region, especially providing immediate relief to the Christian refugees, and pleading as an observer organization to the UN. Unifying the Middle Eastern Christian voices and needs without interfering with the sovereignty of each denomination. This organization will also lead and optimize the interfaith dialogue in the region with Muslims and Jews since will represent the ensemble of Oriental Christians. I also believe that this council will improve a lot the ecumenical dialogue since all the denominations will be working a lot closer. It is important that we, the Christians of the Middle East, speak with one voice to be heard. Every Bishop, every Patriarch can only speak for his own flock, for the Christians of his denomination. And there are dozens of Christian Churches and denominations and a dozen Patriarchs; so now politicians know to whom they should speak first without getting involved in an inter-confessional contest. This is something that has to be changed if we want to be efficient, since we can only solve our problems on a large political scale.\n\nAs far as support, I have a great relationship and support from many leaders, especially from the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, The Maronite Church, and the Coptic Orthodox Church. I have great respect and admiration for His Majesty King Abdullah II and for his late father, King Hussein, and a very good relationship with some princes and princesses of the House. They have a real commitment to service to their people. Actually, Jordan is an example not only for the Middle East but for the whole world. There you find real tolerance, respect, and coexistence.\n\nZENIT: You were in Rome twice this May and June to meet with several Cardinals and even Pope Francis. With whom exactly did you meet and what was their reaction to your proposal?\n\nPrince Gharios: My two encounters with the Holy Father were brief. But I’m looking forward to discussing the situation and my proposals in depth with him. I met with Cardinal [Kurt] Koch [President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity] and Cardinal [Leonardo] Sandri [Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.] Both are holy men. Cardinal Koch was very interested in our ideas.\n\nZENIT: What is the next step? What are your plans? What are you asking from people who want to support you?\n\nPrince Gharios: We’re now gathering more support for the Oriental Christian Council. Until my last breath, I’ll keep working worldwide to protect the Christians in the Middle East and also to promote the legacy of the Ghassanids. We need all the possible help and prayers since the task is colossal. The people interested may contact our Chancellery at info@princegharios.com or visit www.ghassan.org\n\nDeborah Castellano Lubov is Senior Vatican Correspondent for Zenit and its English edition. Author of ‘The Other Francis,’ now published in five languages, she gave a personal, in-depth look at the Holy Father, through interviews with those closest to him and collaborating with him, featuring the preface of Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. Lubov often covers the Pope’s trips abroad, and often from the Papal Flight, where she has also asked him questions on the return-flight press conference on behalf of the English-speaking press present. Deborah Castellano Lubov, who also serves as NBC Vatican Analyst and collaborator, also has done much TV & radio commentary, including for NBC, Sky, EWTN, BBC, Vatican Radio, AP, Reuters and more. She also has written for various Catholic publications.\n\nLearn more about the Royal House of Ghassan by watching the video below\n\nExclusive interview with His Royal Highness Prince Gharios El Chemor Al-Nu’man VIII, Head of the Sovereign Imperial and Royal House of Ghassan (original article HERE)\n\nThe Ghassanids ruled over the largest territory for the longest period in the Middle East, more than any other Arab dynasties could. Nonetheless you were born in Brazil in a different era and far from your family’s former homeland. How do you describe your feelings and relationship about the current Lebanon and its people?\n\nIt’s a very interesting situation. Many people confuse me as “prince of Lebanon” which is not accurate. The closest to the “princes of Lebanon” would be my cousins from the Chehab family who ruled Mount Lebanon on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. The first Ghassanid State was in modern-day Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, parts of Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Lebanon was a country “per se” only in 1946. My direct family left the region in 1914, when the area was still part of the Ottoman Empire. That’s why today in Brazil the Syrian and Lebanese descendants are vulgarly (and inaccurately) known as “Turks”, since they brought a Turk Ottoman passport with them. My family, since the Ottoman’s inception in the area, was always sovereign and independent like, for example, modern-day Monaco and Luxembourg. That being the reason why we were outcasts and persecuted. Back to 1914, due to the persecution, my direct family had to change our surname a century earlier from “El Chemor” to “Gharios” (“Gregory” in Aramaic) which was the first name of the son of the last Christian Ghassanid ruler HRH Sheikh Youssef El Chemor. He swore to “hunt” all of the Ottoman corrupted officials. Well, it was a David and Goliath’s situation which has ended with my ancestor’s deposition and assassination. But even “the great Goliath” fell hard a couple hundred years later when the Ottomans lost the war and their empire. But the Lebanese paid a very painful price since the Ottomans starved to death half of the Lebanese population in addition to the Armenian Genocide. That situation was unbearable for many inhabitants of Mount Lebanon which created a colossal diaspora, especially in Brazil, where today we have almost three times more Lebanese than in Lebanon.\n\nA few weeks ago there was a big explosion in Beirut. What do you think, after this catastrophe how the city and the country can recover? Once Lebanon was called the ‘Switzerland of the East” as a major financial and commercial center. What do you think about the future of the nation? Which would be the best direction for the country?\n\nRegarding my feelings for Lebanon, in addition to my blood, I’ve visited the country several times officially invited by the government and I had the pleasure of living there for eight months. Even with all the problems, there’s no way of not falling in love with the country and the warm and beautiful people. Sadly, the problems in the country have been evolving for decades. Hopefully, after this tragedy, it’ll be time for a new birth in Lebanon. I believe that a complete reform of the whole political and economical establishment is needed. God willing, with the protection and supervision of a well-intentioned foreign country like France.\n\nIf somebody reads your biography easily can think you are a modern polyhistor. You have tried yourself in the film and music industry, studied art, and had a PhD. You have written several books, one of them is a real rarity about dynastic and nobility law. What comes next?\n\nI believe that one of the most important qualities of humanity is our ability to learn. My most precious asset is my mind. Especially since, regarding my body, except for the martial arts, I was never a great sportsman. Right the opposite, I was always the chubby kid bullied in school. I’ve always been terrible in all sports. Even today.\n\nAs you mentioned you are an expert in Eastern martial arts. Even though you are the head of the world’s oldest Christian royal house, Buddhism is really important to you. How do you reconcile them?\n\nI’ve been fascinated by the Asian culture since I was five years old. I’ve started with the Japanese martial arts. My father forced me to start Judo since he was a practitioner. I didn’t like the competition factor and I left after a couple of years. But I got “the bug”. After that, I studied many different martial arts like several styles of karate, Kung fu, Kobudo, kali Silat, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, European fencing, etc. In my early teenage years, I started Aikido, which has opened the doors for all aspects of Japanese culture. I’ve studied religion, language, calligraphy, music, etc. I ended up becoming one of the most influential Aikido masters in Brazil holding high teaching credentials and forming many of the actual masters active today there. I’ve also got karate and Kobudo black belts. With Aikido I’ve discovered the Shinto religion and Zen Buddhism. With that, a couple of years later, I discovered Tibetan Buddhism becoming a student and even a lecturer about it. Buddhism is not a religion “per se” since it doesn’t have dogmas. It doesn’t even have a clear concept of divinity. Buddhism is ultimately how you can train your mind to diminish suffering for yourself and others. Also, how to cultivate compassion. Learning Buddhism has helped me to be a better Christian. Somehow, the philosophical concept of compassion in Christianity is more related to pity and mercy. You should forgive your aggressor, but that implies your superiority. Buddhism teaches you how to understand what has motivated your aggressor to do what he or she has done. Compassion is understanding the other’s sufferings and motivations. It’s easier to forgive when you feel the other person’s pain instead of just accepting the aggression and moving on. Cherenzing, the manifestation of compassion in Tibetan Buddhism has one of many manifestations as a woman with a thousand arms, meaning it should be available to everyone. In each palm of the hand there’s an eye, meaning it’s not just present but aware of the other person’s suffering, being in the person’s shoes, not just having pity. That made it easier to understand and respect other people’s perspectives.\n\nYou are extremely active on the online platforms too. You run a YouTube and Instagram channel, and you have started an online course about monarchy and geopolitics. On the other hand, you are also a member of the Equestrian Order of Michael Archangel which is one of the oldest knighthoods in the world. What’s your opinion about the symbiosis of the modernism and the tradition?\n\nI honestly don’t like social media. I think in the middle of the rare good resources there’s a sea of garbage and misinformation. But social media is a necessary evil today in order to promote one’s work. Regarding the Equestrian Order of Michael Archangel, it doesn’t claim “a legatee Succession” with any historical order of chivalry but with the legacy of some of the oldest Christian knights in history, the Ghassanids. Mainstream historians consider the genesis of Christian chivalry, the first Crusade, and the defense of the holy land. However, it’s documented that my people used to defend the holy land around four centuries before the first Crusade adopting the known ideals of Christian chivalry before any European knights.\n\nIf the previous examples wouldn’t be enough you run several organisations and companies as well. Which are the most important in your life?\n\nWell, the Royal House of Ghassan headquartered in the US is the parent organization to our main branch in Lebanon, to the Prince Gharios Foundation in Düsseldorf, Germany, to the Royal Academy in Bonn, Germany, and to the One Voice Foundation. The royal house is not only my passion but also my duty. As a profession, I’m a corporate consultant with expertise in marketing and PR and an artist. I had classical theater training in Brazil and I started as a theater director in 1993. From that time on I’ve directed, written, and produced a lot of projects. I’ve been a SAG actor since 2010 and recently I’ve released the documentary “The Christian Kings of the Middle East” available on YouTube. I’ve hosted, directed, and produced it. I love the arts so much, I also paint and sing. I think I’ve got that from my mother’s side since my great-grandfather was a maestro in Brazil.\n\nYou have got a lot of awards, for example you are the Goodwill Ambassador of Arkansas, you were elected the Noble Man of the Year in 2014 and awarded by President Trump as well. What do you think how people are thinking about the royals nowadays and particulary in Lebanon?\n\nRegarding the awards, I’m very humbled by the accolades I’ve received in four continents, but my greatest award is to be able to help and inspire, to be relevant. As I always say, a title as a personal honor is absolutely useless in the twenty-first century. It has its historical significance but it dies in itself. The only reason my family and I keep this tradition is because we’re doing our best to be relevant today. Unfortunately, regarding Lebanon, the country is in a terrible situation. And it has been for the last decades. Lebanon is a small country in a very strategic position that has to keep eighteen religious groups in perfect harmony. A country with over a million refugees having four million inhabitants! I sincerely hope that the last tragedy may help to ultimately fix the situation there. There’s no active monarchical movement there but they are used to titles. Many families, like mine, kept them alive.\n\nI saw pictures of you with the crown princes of Albania and Italy. Do you have a close relationship with other royals as well?\n\nI’ve good relationships with ruling and non-ruling royal houses. However, even though we are the oldest Royal house of Christendom and also the oldest Arab dynasty still active, we’re relatively new in foreign relations. Even in Lebanon, although the family’s titles never stop being recognized, we were only recognized as an Imperial and Royal House in 2019, by presidential decree. We’re translating documents and books to English since all the information was in Arabic and classic Arabic until recently. The royal house stayed dormant as a public organization for over three decades, even though some family members actively used the titles, no official activities took place. After the passing of the last sovereign prince in 1971, his son and my cousin HRH Prince Sheikh Selim El Chemor was officially invited by Her Majesty the Queen for the 1996 Royal Ascot and that was it. No further official events or anything. We’re reigniting those contacts now.\n\nAs the legitimate heir of a former country, what are your most important duties as the head of the royal family?\n\nWell, our original territory comprehends today’s Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, part of Iraq, and northern Saudi Arabia. We don’t actively militate any territory because we believe it would just create more confusion to an already troubled region. Also, regarding Jordan, we believe that the Hashemites are doing great work. I’m very fond of His Majesty King Abdullah II and his late father King Hussein. Even Saudi Arabia with its many problems is better than the neighboring republics. I’m really confident in the internal reforms that HRH Prince Mohammad Bin Salman is trying to make modernizing the country. However, we have a duty to the people living in the whole region. So we try to assist them in the best way possible, raising awareness, preserving the culture, bringing relief and education. Royalty is about serving.\n\nAt last, I would like to ask you to tell me what a normal day looks like for you. And how do you as a royal descendent spend an average weekend?\n\nAs I always say even being a prince I still have to pay for Netflix like everybody else. My days are regular. Even with the pandemic, I work a lot from home. The only “princely” activities I’ve are the official events we have and the ones we’re invited to. During my weekends, I really like to hike, play golf, shoot, practice martial arts, paint, and write. I also love to watch films and listen to music. Every day I do meditation and contemplation trying to fix my numerous flaws and to grasp what I can do to better serve my people and make the world a better place.\n\nPhotos: www.princegharios.org\n\nLearn more about the Royal House of Ghassan by watching the video below\n\nThe Al Arab (Arabic: العرب, romanized: The Arabs) newspaper was the first Arabic daily following the independence of Qatar. It was founded in 1972. The following interview was given by HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor during his visit to the Middle East. The following is an automatic translation. For the original in Arabic, click HERE\n\nThe appearance of the ISIS caliph al-Baghdadi awakens the king of the Ghassanids\n\nThe name of the Ghassanids comes from the Ghassan water spring in Tihama, they migrated from it and settled in the south of the Levant, the Hauran plain, and the south of Lebanon, and with the Byzantine occupation they entered the Byzantine kingdom and with the advent of the Islamic conquest they joined under the banner of the Islamic state after the Battle of Yarmouk.\n\nA long history of the Kingdom, but today Prince Gharios Al-Numan is at the head of the Ghassani royal house as the legitimate heir to the royal family, where he won the recognition of Brazilian and American courts of his right to the throne, and it is known that the Kingdom of Ghassanids traces its roots to the Arabic region, and yet we see that the activity of the heir to the throne is concentrated towards the outside when you ask him what is the reason for this and are there any activities related to the Kingdom within the region Arabic? Is there a future project to return to the roots? “My family had to flee because of the Ottoman persecution in Mount Lebanon and had to settle in South America. As a result, I was born and raised in Brazil. Being born in the diaspora, this gave me an exceptional perspective on historical developments and conflicts in the Middle East. I was free from any non-neutral ideological interferences. When I became president of the Ghassani Royal House, the last thing I could think of was creating another political movement to add to the exhaustion of the scenario in the Middle East at the present time.”\n\nGhassanids in the Americas\n\n80 percent of Ghassanids live in the Americas, and 90 percent do not even speak the Arabic language. But this does not mean that their relationship with the Middle East is over, according to Gharios, “One of the biggest causes of problems in the Middle East is the result of Western interventions. Therefore, almost all of the strategies used so far have been disastrous, even if some are essentially well-intentioned.”\n\nThe heir to the Ghassani throne adds: “Since the beginning of the Ghassanid rule, we have always acted as a bridge between East and West. Therefore, my main goal is to raise Western awareness about the Middle East. I think this is the best way I can help my Arab sisters and brothers, not only those who live in the Arab world but also those who live in the West. The other major problem is sectarianism, so we seek to create a peaceful dialogue to support civilized civil coexistence. As for our activities in the Middle East, we recently opened an office in Dubai and will intensify our activities in the Arab world. “If we aim to build bridges between West and East, we need to work in both regions.”\n\n“Rulers and politicians in the Middle East must recognize that the “old model” discourse that ignorant people are easy to rule is completely dead. In today’s world, if children and young people do not receive their education from a reliable source, they will receive it elsewhere.”\n\nMiddle East and Kingdoms\n\nThere are several kingdoms and sultanates in the Arabic region, and the question is are there channels of communication for the Ghassanids with those kingdoms, and is there some kind of recognition of them, whether officially or informally? “We have legal recognition, and it’s official, of course. The legal decisions it obtained in Brazil, the largest Arab colony outside the Middle East with a population of 15 million people and home to at least 70 percent of the world’s Ghassanids, and another recognition in the United States, which is legal and binding under international conventions such as the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, which have been ratified by 148 countries in the world, including 90 percent of Arabic countries.“\n\nGharios asserts that Ghassanids living in Brazil and the United States, many of them in the Middle East, have ratified this official and legal recognition as well. “This year, we began to engage with governments in the region to offer our cooperation, and what we seek is not only recognition but also being a helpful and relevant agent. There is no point in the Ghassani house if it is not linked to our modern world.”\n\nA Christian Kingdom in the Middle East\n\nIt is known that the Islamic religion is the most widespread in the region and is condemned by the kingdoms and emirates Arabic, and here the fear of a Christian kingdom project among those Islamic countries appears, Gharios is quick to deny this and says: “We do not seek to establish a Christian kingdom in Islamic countries. We don’t even try to be part of political activities but we defend peaceful dialogue and human rights. The Royal House of Ghassan operates as a non-governmental and not-for-profit cultural organization. We preserve the heritage of the Ghassanids, but in a way that is neither political nor religious. We are working to stop the ongoing persecution of Christians in the Middle East, however, I have great respect for Islam and that is why one of my most important activities is to protect Muslims in Christian countries. There are many Ghassanids who have converted to Islam. I am absolutely positive that we will all live together in peace if the West understands the principles and message of peace in Islam.”\n\nThe heir to the throne of the Ghassanid kingdom believes that the constitutional monarchy is the most successful in Arabic countries, but the voice of the people must be heard\n\nGhassanids and the Arab Spring\n\nThe heir to the Ghassanid throne believes that the voice of the people should be heard, but believes that “Western democracy does not suit the East and that there is another form of government that suits the people of the East. This is due to two reasons: first, because Arabic peoples are accustomed to this system, and second because recent history has shown us that monarchies have served their people better than republics. I have great respect for His Majesty King Abdullah II of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. In my opinion, he is one of the greatest leaders of our time and understands his people and the requirements of system development. It invests in education, women’s empowerment, and religious dialogue. These may be the most important needs of the Middle East. King Mohamed VI of Morocco is implementing similar effective measures. I also have great respect for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid Al Maktoum from U.A.E. their vision for the UAE Arabic is exceptional.”\n\nAgainst the Republics\n\nAfter that, Gharios does not insist on the need to change republics into monarchies but believes that democracy is a process that can only be implemented “if the voter is politicized (educated) and this will require a lot of time, a lot of trials and mistakes. This process constitutes almost an act of violence. I believe the solution is education. Rulers and politicians around the world, not just in the Middle East, must realize that the “old paradigm” discourse that ignorant people are easy to rule is completely dead. In today’s world, if children and young people don’t receive their education from a reliable source, they will receive it elsewhere.”\n\nSectarianism\n\nSectarianism is a widespread disease that permeates Arabic societies, especially in Syria and Lebanon, so how does the heir to the Ghassani throne see the sectarian wars taking place in the Arabic region? “Usually, such conflicts do not end in victors, and both sides lose dramatically. I coined a concept called “Newton’s pendulum behavior.” Newton’s pendulum, also known as the “ball pendulum,” is a tool that demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy through a series of swinging balls. When a ball rises, it creates a continuous counterattack forward and backward. In this way, our mind acts in response to aggressive behaviors. We attack against each other as soon as we are attacked, and so does the other side, and this is an endless process unless someone stops the movement. In the Middle East, this is turning into a deadly circle that spreads throughout the region. This prevents the whole region from prospering.”\n\n“In Brazil, Christians and Muslims, Sunnis, Shiites, Druze, and Jews live side by side in remarkable harmony. A good example of this is 25 March Street in São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil. There, Arabs of all faiths and Jews live and their shops are located side by side. They have certain differences, but whenever something happens in the Middle East, they all take to the streets and march together while holding hands. So, my philosophy is that if it’s possible there, it’s possible everywhere else. The problems in the Middle East are man-made and therefore can be solved by man.”\n\nThe Struggle for Syria\n\nGarrios believes there is a lot of misinformation about what is going on in Syria now, adding: “I was clear in my rhetoric against Western intervention in the battle, and thank God the United States reconsidered the idea of bombing Syria. I prefer the government to be secular and democratic so that all minorities are equally protected. It is my intention to spend time with Syrian refugees in Jordan in the near future to assess their needs and how to provide assistance. With that information, I will get support in the West from governments and private foundations.”\n\nSecret history and possible solutions\n\nThe heir to the Ghassanid throne is preparing to release his new book “The Middle East: Secret History and Possible Solutions” in an attempt to reveal documents and information about the history of the region, with a package of ideas and solutions to the crises the region is going through. “For example, everyone asks me why I’m the head of a royal dynasty that is more than 1,400 years old. People do not know that the Ghassanids actually ruled until the eighteenth century AD. We have had an important role in the history of the Middle East and people usually don’t know anything about us. Therefore, all the information came from prestigious researchers based on conclusive historical and archaeological evidence, not from unknown theories or sources. Based on a study by Professor Eric Cheney of Harvard University, we explore in the book the relationship between the first Ghassanid era and the current absence of democracy in the region. In the book, we also addressed some of the main problems in the Middle East and presented possible strategies to solve these problems.”\n\nWith the climate of the caliphate and waiting for the Mahdi, old concepts that lived in bygone eras reappeared again, and those who claim the throne of Persia, the throne of Petra, Palmyra, and others may appear.\n\nAmmar Al-Mamoun – Syrian writer\n\nLearn more about the Royal House of Ghassan by watching the video below\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: DNA alone cannot be used to validate anyone’s claim to royalty or nobility. It only serves as an empirical corroborating evidence to history, documents, bibliography, etc.\n\nAlthough we are genealogically related to billions of people, we only carry the DNA of 120 (one hundred and twenty) ancestors. To get to 3 billion people we only have to go to around 1200 CE. It’s easy to get to this number, multiplying exponentially: two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen great-great-grandparents, and so on…\n\nThese 120 people are totally random. Obviously, we have a higher probability of caring the DNA from our parents and closest relatives. But even siblings from the same parents have different percentages of DNA from each parent and it goes even further, each sibling might have a different combination of those 120 ancestors. Regarding distant cousins, even the ones genealogically related to a person, the chances of showing a match are more and more difficult as the distance increases due to the number of possible combinations building up exponentially dropping the odds of having any of the 120 common ancestors. Therefore, it’s absolutely possible, and even normal, to be genuinely related to someone genealogically and not be related through DNA due to the limitations and randomity of the 120 ancestors per individual. Keeping in mind that this number is cut in half since usually the individual is only related through one parent.\n\nWatch this video to better understand the why.\n\nHowever, when using historical sources as support tools for research, it’s easier to reach elementary corroborating conclusions.\n\nThis article uses DNA matches from HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor of Ghassan Al-Numan VIII vis-a-vis the genealogy and historical records of the Royal Ghassanid Family. It uses matches from 3 (three) DNA laboratories: Ancestry, MyHeritage, and FamilyTreeDNA\n\nDNA connection with the El Chemor and Gharios family of Beirut/Chiya, Lebanon\n\nMore details HERE:\n\nIt’s known that after the deposition in the 18th century by the Ottomans, some of the descendants of the last ruler, HRH Sheikh Youssef El Chemor went to a small town known as Beit Habbak near Byblos (Jbeil)\n\n“Four brothers moved from the Chemor family to Beit Habbak and from there they spread: The first went to Baskinta and was known by the name Habika (Hobeika, Habbaki), a pet name for the household name Habbak. The second settled in the Habbak house and the family Farjan was made because of him. The last two, Farahat and Gharios, went to the Suburbs of Beirut, Farahat Chemor resided in Al Hadas, and his family name became Farahat, and Gharios’ family name became Gharios after his own first name.” p. 2236, Encyclopedia of the Maronite Families, v.4, Notre Dame University https://royalblog.org/2018/08/08/encyclopedia-of-maronite-families-confirms-the-sheikhs-el-chemors-chronicles-and-makes-a-surprising-statement/\n\nThat’s also corroborated by the 1948’s book about the family https://royalblog.org/2016/11/28/royal-house-of-ghassan-provides-english-legal-translations-of-1948s-historical-scientific-research-about-the-family/ And the writings of the Blessed Maronite Patriarch Istifan al-Duwayhi https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istifan_al-Duwayhi\n\nPrince Gharios’ DNA matches Mr. Karim Zakhour, grandson of Victoria Gharios of Chiyah. She was the aunt of former Lebanese deputy Naji Camille Gharios from Chiyah (see encyclopedia quote above)\n\nThe results prove, without a single solitary doubt, the blood link between the Guerios Family of Brazil and the Gharios family of Chiyah.

And so, the news became my concern and drove me to write after I had not seen her for a long time, and for these reasons:\n\n1. Violeta is Lebanese and from our region.\n\n2. She is a relative of Sheikh Nassif, the number one friend of the writers.\n\n3.

They originated in the Yemen region of ancient Arabia, then migrated to what is now modern Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and nearby areas.\n\nThey became rulers and chiefs of the lands they settled. Over time, the Romans, Greeks, and others conquered the area. The Ghassans’ were held in high esteem. For their loyalty as guardians and overseers of the region, and their ability as conquerors, the royal Ghassani household and its lords were given the name Ma’yoof, which meant “exempt” (from paying taxes on wealth, property, tribute, or flocks). They ruled the areas from circa 37AD to 637AD and became among the first Christian kings in the region. It is interesting to note that in 244AD, Amyres Qays, son of a Ghassani chief, ascended to the Roman throne. He was known as Emperor Marqus Julius Feyrus Philippus, or Philip the Arab, for short.” https://maloofsinternational.org/who-we-are/\n\nPrince Gharios El Chemor shows DNA relations with several members of the El Malouf Family.

Source: https://forebears.io/\n\nBy combining the DNA obvious evidence, the vast verified bibliographical and official documentation, with the contemporary recognitions and scholars, it’s easy to reach an irrefutable conclusion of unassailable and indisputable corroboration of all Royal Ghassanid Claims by HIRH Prince Gharios and the El Chemor Family.\n\nPhoto: letter from prophet Mohammad to Ghassanid King Al-Harith VI Abu Chemor * Shamir, also Shamar, Shamour or Chemor is one of the many transliterations of the same Arabic word الشمر\n\nOne may argue the reason why the El Chemor Family uses the Royal Ghassanid titles in addition to the “Sheikh” titles. Here are the legal reasons and the historical precedents:\n\n1. The proven legatee succession from the Ghassanid Kings – The mere use of the last name “El Chemor” meant the ones from “Bani Chemor” or “the children of King Chemor” the famous Ghassanid King of the Levant.\n\n“It is a reputed deep-rooted allegation that the heads of Al-Chemor tribe are rooted from Bani Chemor, who are the Christian Kings of Ghassan which belong to Al Jafna.” (Father Ignatios Tannos El-Khoury, Historical Scientific Research: “Sheikh El Chemor Rulers of Al-Aqoura (1211-1633) and Rulers of Al-Zawiye (1641-1747)”Beirut, Lebanon, 1948, p.38)\n\n“This is the history of the Chemor family Sheikhs who are feudal rulers, a genuine progeny of the sons of Ghassan kings of the Levant… one of the most decent, oldest and noblest families in Lebanon.” (ibid p.125)\n\nAnd the El Chemor family isn’t the only one with these characteristics. There are also two families in Iraq, Oman and UAE that descend directly from the Lakhmid Kings Mundher and Al-Numan:\n\n“The “Mandhari [children of king Mundher] and Na’amani [children of king Al-Numan] tribes” are the main descendants of the Lakhmids in the Persian Gulf. They are, for the most part, the same family with superficial, simple differences. The main difference is that the Na’amani family traces its lineage back to al-Nu’man III ibn al-Mundhir while the Mandhari family traces it back to his grandfather: king al-Mundhir ibn Imr’u al-Qais, but a significant number of members of the Al Mandhari tribe are descendants of king al-Nu’man III ibn al-Mundhir. Both families are mainly situated in the Iraq, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and the Sultanate of Oman. “\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakhmids#Al_Mandhari_/_Al_Na’amani_families\n\nIn Lebanon, there’s another very important and prestigious family who claim descent from the Lakhmid Kings, the House of Arslan. They have the title of princes just for this link with the Lakhmid dynasty which ended in 602 CE. The Arslan family had a huge role in Lebanese history, especially in the Lebanese independence, however, differently than the El Chemor family, they didn’t rule any territory since the 7th century but still are recognized lawful princes.\n\n* Sworn Legal Statement from the world’s leading Expert in Arab Royal Succession CLICK HERE\n\n* More about the endowment of the Royal titles to the El Chemor family, please CLICK HERE\n\n* See historical family documents by CLICKING HERE\n\n2. Arab tradition – a sovereign sheikh is a royal prince by the Arab tradition since pre-Islamic times. The title “sheikh” (in the secular sense) is even more related to hereditary ruler than “Amir” which was originally a military title (coming from the Arabic verb “amr” or “to command”), only associated as being analogous to the western title of “prince” since a few centuries ago. That can be corroborated not only by history but also by the existing Arab States ruled by sheikhs: Kuwait, Bahrain, Bahrain, Qatar, Dubai, Abu-Dhabi, Sharja, etc.\n\nAlso important to point that the origin of many of the aforementioned ruling royal families is from Al Azd tribe exactly the same of the El Chemor family, being natural that the traditions are similar, regardless of religion since the Arab laws of succession come mostly from pre-Islamic tribal customs.\n\nThe founder of the Ghassanid Dynasty was King Jafna Ibn Amr (ruled 220-265 CE). He was the son of the Azd ruler Amr Ibn Muzaikiya. The other sons of Amr gave origin of other important Arab ruling families like the Al-Said Sultans of Oman, the Al-Nahyam rulers of Abu-Dhabi, the Al-Maktoums rulers of Dubai and the Al-Nasrids rulers of Al-Andaluz (Spain). Originally as part of the Azd tribe, the Sheikhs El Chemor have blood ties with many major Arab ruling houses.\n\n3. Dynastic custom adopting past titles of the family patrimony – it’s perfectly accepted by the European jurisprudence the use of past titles that historically belonged to the family.\n\nFor example, Prince Henri, the head of the French Orleans family, uses the title “Count of Paris”, an old title belonging to the family but not used by other ruling head of the family. Count of Paris (French: Comte de Paris) was a title for the local magnate of the district around Paris in Carolingian times. After Hugh Capet was elected King of France in 987, the title merged into the crown and fell into disuse. However, it was later revived by the Orléanist pretenders to the French throne in an attempt to evoke the legacy of Capet and his dynasty.\n\n4. Principle of “de jure” sovereignty – according to this principle, a deposed ruler and his descendants in perpetuity (following the respective laws of succession) keep two of the four powers of sovereignty: “jus majestatis” the right of being respected and recognized by his title and “jus honorum” the right of conferring titles, honors and awards. The two other powers “jus imperium” the right of rule a territory and a people and “jus gladii” the right of command an army and apply the capital penalty, remain dormant until the “de facto” sovereignty is restored. Being a “de jure” sovereign, the decision of the use of titles is a personal prerogative as stated by one of the forefathers of international law, Emmerich de Vattel:\n\nThe Law of Nations or the Principles of Natural Law, 1758 CE:\n\n“BOOK 2, CHAPTER 3\n\nOf the Dignity and Equality of Nations: of Titles and Other Marks of Honor\n\n§ 42. Whether a sovereign may assume what title and honors he pleases.\n\nIf the conductor of the state is sovereign, he has in his hands the rights and authority of the political society; and consequently he may himself determine what title he will assume, and what honors shall be paid to him, unless these have been already determined by the fundamental laws, or that the limits which have been set to his power manifestly oppose such as he wishes to assume. His subjects are equally obliged to obey him in this as in whatever he commands by virtue of a lawful authority. Thus, the Czar Peter I., grounding his pretensions on the vast extent of his dominions, took upon himself the title of emperor.” https://lonang.com/library/reference/vattel-law-of-nations/vatt-203/\n\nIf we accept that a deposed sovereign and his descendants remain being sovereign (just “de jure” or by right, not “de facto” or in fact), the above mentioned by Vattel refers to the power of “jus majestatis”, fully active during the interregnum. Naturally, being the “jus imperii” dormant, in theory, his former “subjects” don’t have an obligation to acknowledge the prince pretender by his title.\n\n“The refugees of Al Ghassani and bani Chemor who seeked refuge to Al ‘Aqoura turned into Maronites because the town now only has Maronites Christians and because Al Chemor tribe are the princes and children of kings, the Maronites reigned them over the land where the document states that: “… and Al ‘Aqoura is their own village from a long time, they can do as they wish…” and Al Chemori family could have taken over the throne due to their relentless efforts, money or battles, no one knows.” (Father Ignatios Tannos El-Khoury, Historical Scientific Research: “Sheikh El Chemor Rulers of Al-Aqoura (1211-1633) and Rulers of Al-Zawiye (1641-1747)”Beirut, Lebanon, 1948, p.42)\n\nThe above reference clearly shows sovereignty over the Al-Aqoura region.\n\nThe examples in the Middle East are also extensive where many sovereign Sheikhs have decided to use Royal titles like His Majesty King Abdullah I of Jordan who was originally the Emir of Transjordan and his ancestors were Sheriffs of Meca; or His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, was the 12th Hakim of Bahrain. His son, His Highness Sheikh Isa II bin Salman II Al Khalifa, changed the title to “Emir of Bahrain” in 1971 and his son, His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa has changed the title again in 2002 from Emir (prince) to Malik (king).\n\nAccording to several encyclopedias, “Amir”, means “lord” or “commander-in-chief”, being derived from the Arabic root ‘a-m-r’ or “command“. Originally, simply meaning “commander-in-chief” or “leader”, usually in reference to a group of people, it came to be used as a title for governors or rulers, usually in smaller states. Therefore, the title had a military – not necessarily royal/noble – connotation.\n\n“The title Emir or Amir was equivalent of that of Commander.” The Black Book of the Admiralty, 1873, V.2, p.xiii (Cambridge University Press, 2012 edition, edited by Travers Twiss)\n\n“In the past, amir was usually a military title, now used to mean prince or as a title for various rulers or chiefs.” The New Encyclopedia of Islam, By Cyril Glassé, Huston Smith, Rowman Altamira, 2003, p.48\n\nIn comparison to the western titles, by its origin and meaning, the title “Amir” would be equivalent to the title “Duke”, not “Prince”, since both “Amir” and “Duke” have a military root and meaning.\n\nAbout the title “Duke”:\n\n“The title comes from French duc, itself from the dux, ‘leader’, a term used in Latinrepublican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province.” https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke\n\nA sovereign ruler using the title “Sheikh” or even “Hakim” is an “Emir” ‘per se‘ (intrinsically). In other words, even if the title is not openly used, it’s definitely implied. That tradition is what makes so natural for the aforementioned rulers to “update” their titles.\n\n* More about the difference of the Arab titles, please CLICK HERE\n\n* More about the sovereign rights of the El Chemor family according to international law, please CLICK HERE\n\n5. The heirs of a sovereign house (observed the laws of succession) are princes regardless of the fact that they use the title or not – Examples: the archdukes of Austria, the Tsareviches and grand-dukes of the Russian empire were/are princes even thought they didn’t use the title officially.\n\n6. To avoid the confusion – there are several categories of “sheikh” titles in Lebanon bestowed by princes after the Ottoman invasion. Those titles are “noble” not “Royal”. Differently from the El Chemor Sheikhs, the “post-Ottoman sheikhs” were not natural “sovereign or semi-sovereign” tribal leaders but wealthy notable commoners elevated to nobility.\n\n“… [the tribal Sheikh] was a hereditary feudal chief whose authority over a particular district was vested within a patrilineal kinship group. He lived in his own village and maintained ties of patronage with his atba’ [following]. In contrast, the multazim [Sheikh] was not indigenous to the tax farm he controlled. He was more akin to a government official than a feudal sheikh.” “Lebanon’s Predicament“, Columbia, 1987, Samir Khalaf\n\n* More about the different categories of “sheikh” titles in Lebanon, please CLICK HERE"
