        "text": "Maronites\n\nPRONUNCIATION: MA-ruh-nites\n\nLOCATION: Lebanon\n\nPOPULATION: 1.2 million\n\nLANGUAGE: Arabic; French; English\n\nRELIGION: Maronite (Uniate Catholicism)\n\n2 • LOCATION\n\nAfter surviving in the high mountains of northern Lebanon for many centuries, the Maronites spread southward during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By the mid-nineteenth century, the Maronite Church owned one-fourth to one-third of all the land in Mount Lebanon. During the twentieth century, some Maronites began to move out of the mountains to the cities and coastal plains, especially to Beirut.\n\nDuring the recent Lebanese civil war, more than 600,000 Maronites were driven out of their homes and off their lands. The Maronite population is about 1.2 million people. Maronites are concentrated in East Beirut, while Muslim Shi'ites live primarily in West Beirut.\n\n3 • LANGUAGE\n\nAlthough Arabic is the official language of Lebanon, many Maronites also speak French. Syriac is used for the church liturgy, but Maronites have used Arabic for church records since their beginnings.\n\n4 • FOLKLORE\n\nThe door of the Maronite church in the town of Bayt Meri near Beirut is never locked because it is believed that the hand of any thief there would be miraculously paralyzed.\n\n5 • RELIGION\n\nThe Maronites are Uniate Catholics. They recognize the authority of the Roman Catholic pope, but they have their own form of worship. Their priests can marry, and monks and nuns are housed in the same building. The Maronites have continued to use the Syriac language for their liturgy instead of Latin. The Maronites hold the orthodox view that Christ has two natures, one human and one divine, that are inseparable yet distinct. Christ is at one with God in his divine nature, and at one with humanity in his human nature. The Qadisha (Holy) Valley is the Maronites' spiritual center.\n\n7 • RITES OF PASSAGE\n\nThe Maronites mark major life events, such as birth, marriage, and death, within the traditions of Christianity.\n\n8 • RELATIONSHIPS\n\nLiving for centuries in isolated mountain communities has led the Maronites to develop both clan loyalties and fierce feuding.\n\n9 • LIVING CONDITIONS\n\nMaronite homes are small and simple, yet elegant, often with a balcony overlooking the mountains or the Mediterranean Sea. During the recent Lebanese civil war, many Maronites fled from the cities (especially Beirut) back to their ancestral homes in Mount Lebanon. As a result, business there boomed, housing construction soared, and the area became quite prosperous.\n\n10 • FAMILY LIFE\n\nThe Maronites, like other Arabs in Lebanon, still have a strong sense of extended family. Men spend quite a bit of time at home with the women and children. There is some intermarriage between Maronites and members of other religious groups. Divorce is forbidden by Maronite law.\n\n11 • CLOTHING\n\nMaronites wear Western-style clothing, as do other cultural groups in Lebanon. The more-devout Maronites tend to wear conservative clothing.\n\n13 • EDUCATION\n\nMost Maronites today still receive their primary and secondary schooling in French-language schools. Then they generally go to the University of St. Joseph in Beirut, founded by French Jesuits in 1875.\n\nToday all Lebanese students must know Arabic in order to graduate from secondary school. Many older Maronites, however, speak only French.\n\n14 • CULTURAL HERITAGE\n\nThe Maronites have strong cultural ties to the West. In 1585 a religious school for Maronite men was established in Rome. A short time later, European Catholic missionaries settled in Lebanon and began schools there.\n\n15 • EMPLOYMENT\n\nMaronites have long held powerful positions in Lebanese government, business, and education. Many are wealthy. With the aid of the French, the Maronites developed Mount Lebanon's greatest moneymaking venture of the past—the silk industry. The mountainsides are dotted with old silk-reeling factories.\n\n16 • SPORTS\n\nSoccer, basketball, and volleyball are popular. Cross-country running, particularly in the mountains, and the martial arts are widely practiced. Skiing, rock climbing, and cave exploration are also enjoyed in the mountains. Maronites enjoy swimming and fishing in the lakes, rivers, or Mediterranean Sea."
