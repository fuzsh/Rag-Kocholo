        "text": "The residents of Rmeish, a Christian town in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border, on Tuesday physically prevented Hezbollah terrorists from firing rockets at Israel from inside their town, Arabic media outlets reported.\n\nThe town mayor told the American Arabic news website al-Hurra that a resident of Rmeish spotted Hezbollah operatives as they attempted to set up a rocket launcher in the area, close to civilian homes.\n\nWhen the terrorists shot at the locals, a crowd of residents gathered, with some ringing the church bells to alert their neighbors and protest against the act.\n\nIn the end, the Hezbollah operatives moved the missile launcher into a wooded area in the village and fired rockets from there, the mayor said.\n\nFootage captured near the church showing the gathering and the ringing of the bells circulated widely on Lebanese social media and gathered statements in support of the residents by many commenters, as well as several politicians.\n\nThe town mayor told al-Hurra that the people of Rmeish are “against Israel more than anyone, and we do not object to the principle of confronting it. Even the fact that the people remain in the village and not move from it despite the imminent dangers, is in itself an act of confrontation and a symbol of the steadfastness of the South.”\n\nIn the aftermath of the heavy exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israel Defense Forces since the terror group initiated its attacks on October 8th in support of Hamas, thousands of residents evacuated their homes in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe mayor noted that the town’s people’s only demand was “the safety of our people and not exposing them to danger, especially since the town is still crowded with the presence of about 7,000 people who have not been displaced from it, who go about their normal lives … there is no political background to the problem.”\n\nThe al-Hurra report noted that Rmeish hasn’t been directly impacted by Israeli strikes so far, unlike many of its neighboring towns and villages which are devastated by numerous strikes on Hezbollah targets.\n\nHezbollah officially responded to the incident on Wednesday, denying that it had attempted to fire rockets from Rmeish, and warned the Lebanese people against “parties that have been insisting on launching these false rumors and taking positions based on them,” accusing them of stirring up strife inside Lebanon and serving Israel’s goals.\n\nThe Maronite (Catholic) Christian inhabitants of Rmeish have repeatedly clashed with the radical Shiite terror group Hezbollah in the past over the terrorists’ use of the village for its activities.\n\nRmeish and another neighboring village are isolated outposts in southern Lebanon, which is mainly populated by Shiite Muslims who largely support Hezbollah.\n\nLocal residents wrote a letter of complaint against Hezbollah last October, the Jerusalem Post reported, and there is an active dispute ongoing since 2016 over the installation of containers by the organization “Green without Borders,” which is affiliated with Hezbollah, according to L’Orient Today.\n\nSome Lebanese Christians are working to prevent war between Israel and Hezbollah, which holds the fractured country in an iron grip. The Patriarch of the Maronite Catholic Church recently made a public call to prevent the outbreak of war with Israel.\n\nThe latest incident followed soon after a controversy over Palm Sunday, as the residents of Rmeish gathered in the town center for a procession commemorating Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem, according to the Bible.\n\nHezbollah supporters on social media claimed the joyous procession was disrespectful towards the Lebanese killed in the skirmishes with Israel and lacked empathy with the displaced residents of south Lebanon."
