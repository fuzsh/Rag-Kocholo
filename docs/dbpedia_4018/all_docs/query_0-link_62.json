Most of the schismatics returned to the Roman Catholic church in 1661, but a small body of dissenters continued as the Syrian Orthodox Church. These Jacobites made several unsuccessful attempts to reunite with Rome in the 18th century. In 1930, through the efforts of Bishop Ivanios, reunion was achieved. The Malankarese Catholics retain the Antiochene liturgy that they adopted as Jacobites, with the characteristic translation of the Syriac into the vernacular Malayalam language."
