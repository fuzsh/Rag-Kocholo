2009 Hyundai Genesis

The quality of Hyundai’s vehicles has made leaps and bounds over the past decade, the culmination of which is represented by the automaker’s current Genesis Sedan flagship. The vehicle, after all, managed to take out the prestigious 2009 North American Car of the Year Award at the start of this year despite going on sale just months prior.

It appears the Genesis was not only a favorite at the Detroit Auto Show award event as the handsome four-door has earned more awards than any other vehicle this year. At last count, the Genesis tallied more than 20 top honors from the most prominent media outlets and automotive organizations in North America.

Some of the other titles include awards from the likes of J.D. Power and Associates, Motor Trend, AutoPacific and Cars.com, just to name a few. With success like that, we wonder what the car’s bigger brother, the upcoming Equus luxury sedan, will be able to accomplish when it arrives late next year.
