        "text": "How the 4R’s of wRestling Work!\n\nHere is a quick explanation of the 4R’s. The column will run TWO times a week. On Tuesdays I will discuss TNA Impact and any PPV’s, while my partner in crime Jeremy Thomas discusses WWE Smackdown. The column will run again on Friday’s, covering WWE Raw, with Jeremy Thomas as well as ECW on Sci-Fi by myself. If there is a PPV that weekend, I will also run the RETRO R’s of the show from the year before as well as address some comments when time permits. I will group my feelings on the shows in various categories: The Right, the wRong and the Ridiculous. The Right is stuff that worked very well: a great promo, a great match and so on. PuRgatoRy is a section between the right and wrong. It shows equal traits from both sides that cannot be ignored and need discussed. It is not a bad place per say, as things can get remedied or go the wrong way the very next week. The wRong is what it sounds like: bad matches, bad or boring promos and so on. The Ridiculous is stuff that had no right on TV: Stupid angles, Diva searches and so on. And there is always a possibility of a 5th R, which is as bad as they come, unless you are TNA. They have a special R all of their own, the 6th R; the Russo-FN-Riffic~! This column is supposed to be analytical, and at the right time very critical of the shows, it was the whole reason it was created. This is not a “mark” column, nor a “smark” column, my goal is to analyze the show from many different fronts, reward the good and call out the bad. I will not apologize for my opinions, they are as they are, whether positive or negative.\n\nIn HD where available…\n\nBy: Larry Csonka\n\niMpact! 02.05.09:\n\nTHE RIGHT:\n\nROUGH CUTS: KIYOSHI: Now THIS is exactly how the Rough Cuts should be used. A guy that most of the audience knows nothing about, that they are looking to push and needs the crowd to have a reason to get behind him. I really enjoyed how they did this as well. They detailed his travels to America, and his work at D’Amore’s school and promotion. Shelley and Sabin, who wrestle in Japan and have the relationship with D’Amore, also had great things to say. They did a good job of explaining Kiyoshi’s respect for Muta, and we even had MUTA and his TEDDY BEAR SHIRT ON TNA TV! Tremendous. Also, I loved that they had Sting in the video package. Sting is known for his battles with and against Muta, and having him state that if Muta has taken an interest in the guy that he has a bright future is a great seal of approval comment. This is how they need to do the Rough Cuts deal. Stuff like this one and the Creed one, even the LAX one all had a purpose, and I dug it. Unfortunately since they debuted him with no hype and haven’t done much with him it MIGHT be too late to salvage him, BUT, this will go a long way to making people care and to make him seem important.\n\nMEM Kick off the Show/3D Answers: The show kicked off with the MEM coming to the ring, and basically hyping the PPV main event, which is what they needed to do to get interest for the event. Nash discussed Joe’s coming return, and what he had done for the business. He stated that backstage he could get rid of anyone he wanted too, but Joe was the one man for some reason he could never get rid of. He then said that he would take out Joe, because Joe had been cast as the part of his bitch in the MEM movie. Angle then got on the mic, and furthered the angle with Sting, stating that, “the TNA World Heavyweight Title will stay in the Main Event Mafia, regardless of what I have to do to make it that way.” STAREDOWN~! We then shot backstage to 3D, who added to the main event build, and closing with saying that one half of the greatest tag team in wrestling history will win the title. Overall a strong opening to the show, all focused on selling the main event of the PPV.\n\nThe Guns vs. Lethal and Creed Young: The opening match was set to be the Guns vs. Lethal Consequences, but Beer Money had other ideas. Since they were set to face Lethal Consequences at the PPV, they decided to attack early and beat them down. They took out Creed’s arm with a chair, and left him down and out, all the while, the Guns watched on and never helped their “Frontline” partners. This was perfect as it played into their “all about them” attitude that they had been portraying. Continuity. Lethal then went 2-1 against the Guns, and did his best but it wasn’t enough. Thankfully for him Eric Young made his way to the ring, and he eventually got the hot tag and cleaned house and got the win. Some complained, but he was the fresh man, and while it was a bit Superman, it worked well. This led to Shelley challenging Young for the PPV, putting his X-Title on the line. Not much build, but it gave us another title match for the show, which I liked. The show started off very strong and I was digging it.\n\n3D vs. Angle and Sting: The main event of the evening turned out to be a good little bit of business as far as PPV hype goes. There are times when the non-finish works, and this was it. The story of course was the tease that Angle and Sting couldn’t work together, part of the slow build to where Sting will eventually be ousted from the group. Angle kept trying to prove he could do it all himself, which allowed 3D to control and help the story. In the end Booker T ran in with Steiner, but 3D would clear the ring, and the closing scene was that of Angle and Sting arguing. I felt that this was a good angle for the PPV build, and had no problems with it.\n\nPURGATORY:\n\nBrutus Magnus Debuts: Brutus Magus finally debuted this week on Impact and overall, it was fine. I don’t think Magus is as big as many thought he would be, but he has a good look, a good presence in the ring, and what he did was fine, if basic. It was a debut squash match, which we all expected, and it worked well enough. I personally would have held off until after the PPV for the debut. They didn’t need to add a match with no hype to the PPV in my opinion. I would have debuted him after the PPV, had him run through some guys and then did the PPV challenge so that their was some build to it. Also, not to bi too picky, but his finish sucks. It has a cool ass name, but is essentially a Samoan Drop. How disappointing. I am not going to write him off on day one, but I hope that they actually have a plan for the guy set in stone.\n\nThe Beautiful People vs. Roxxi and Wilde: We got a very good video package, showcasing the feud of The Beautiful People vs. Roxxi, Wilde and “The Governor”. This led to The Beautiful People w/Cute Kip vs. Roxxi and Taylor Wilde, and a match I enjoyed. They did the old take out one half of the face team to isolate the other member. They had a solid match with the vicious streak of the Beautiful People coming out. Roxxi eventually made it back in, but was too out of it to do anything, which allowed the Beautiful People to get the win. A good post match beat down followed, and “The Governor” made the save, to get some revenge of her own. While the video package was great, the match worked and the run in to make the save solid, I have some issues. First of all, for the love of God, PLEASE stop calling her “The Governor”. We know she is a fake, you told us she is a fake, give her a new fucking name, or just call her DAFNEY~! This “The Governor” shit is played and annoying. Secondly, this is a pretty hot angle, why did they do this on TV? Why couldn’t we have a brawl or something and then get the match on PPV? With the TV time they are dedicating to the angle, this really should get PPV time. I would have gone with this instead of the Magnus Challenge. Bottom line is that if you are going to give SO MUCH TV time to an angle, you really should play it off on PPV, especially since this PPV didn’t have a lot of “important ” stuff on it.\n\nMorgan vs. Rhino/Abyss Speaks: Matt Morgan and Rhino had what you could classify as a match on Impact this week, and I didn’t dig this. Morgan was headed towards an announced PPV match, while Rhino had nothing. They also made it a point to mention that Rhino was banged up due to the MEM. So why not have Morgan get a clean win heading into the PPV to gain some momentum? To me that makes more sense, especially considering what we got, a bullshit 3-minute match that ended in DQ. This is TNA even booking for the loss right here. But I will say that the Abyss run in and promo afterwards was good stuff and really added some sizzle to the PPV match with Morgan. He went back to crazy old Abyss, with a solid promo and the punching of the tacks. While I have been critical of Abyss being too over the top in his effort to try and cement a legacy like Abdullah the Butcher or Mick Foley, it did work here. Hopefully the match delivers.\n\nTHE WRONG:\n\nCornette Bans the Kongtourage/Booker Wants to Ref/Bashir vs. Sewell: This was one of those segments that all ran together, and in the end I didn’t like them. We began in Cornette’s office, in one of those segments that tend to make Cornette look like a fool. He banned the Kongtourage from the ring at Against All Odds, and Bolt stood up to him and threatened him. He stood up to her, but it made her look better than him. Booker would them come into the office. He wanted to referee the “Shane Stool” match later in the night. Good work there Booker, you’d think being in wrestling for so long he would know not to make his opponent look like shit, but he doesn’t, lazy fuck wad. I hated that as well. Finally we moved onto Sewell vs. Bashir, which was an ok match, until the ref bump and Booker’s involvement, which led to the TNA TRADEMARK PULL APART BRAWL, which is way over done. Bashir isn’t doing jack or shit right now, and Sewell was heading into a big PPV match, we can’t give the guy a clean win here? UGH, this span of segments was the only thing I fully disliked on the show, but man did I hate it.\n\nTHE RIGHT:\n\nTHE HURRICANE GETS STORMY: T-Grish was back in the interview area with Hurricane Helms. We saw a recap of Matt’s turn on Jeff before Grish asked for Helm’s reaction. Hurricane was all serious and pissed, delivering a fairly good promo that basically set the point that Matt didn’t change, and he’s always been an egomaniacal asshole who simply revealed his true colors at No Way Out. Now, Helms has never been a guy who’s sold himself on being serious—Hurrapops, anyone? But when all was said and done, this was actually a fairly intense and solid promo from the guy that had one purpose—put Matt further over as a heel by highlighting his past. In that, Helms succeeded.\n\nEDGE AND SHOW, WACKY TAG TEAM PARTNERS: PART TWO: Edge was shown backstage with Vickie, freaking out about his upcoming match at No Way Out. He called the Elimination Chamber the most dangerous match of all time and listed off his opponents, then got all-sarcastic. “Let’s have a clambake” was an early contender for Line of the Night. Vick tried to build him up, telling him that she believed in him just as the Big Show came in. I’ve got to say, I love Show’s smarmy, dickish joking-around attitude toward Edge that he’s been running with lately; it provides a nice and much-needed counterbalance to all the seriousness from the majority of the main eventers. It’s funny that Show and ‘H basically have the same attitudes, but the Game gets to be a face with it when it fits a heel persona more. Edge brought up how Show walked out on Edge and threatened to have Vickie kick him out of the Elimination Chamber. Vick tried desperately to play peacekeeper, and Show mocked Edge a little more before taking off. This was a fun segment by Show and Edge to play up the tension that’s been building between them, and I quite enjoyed it.\n\nMATT > FORCES OF NATURE: Matt was in the ring, already pulling the “We Want Jeff!” chants down. He called out Hurricane since he was here and Jeff wasn’t, telling Helms to come down and do something about it. Well, Helms didn’t want to disappoint. He came out sans music to a nice little pop, and we got an all-out brawl between them. This wasn’t anything pretty, it didn’t have any “Wow” moments in it; it just sold Matt as a guy who was willing to destroy anyone, which is exactly what he did to Helms. In fact, my one minor quibble is that Helms got more offense than I was expecting and more than I think he should have. Not that I have anything against the Hurricane, mind, but if they’re trying to push Matt into the main event the best way would be to have him utterly destroy sympathetic midcarders like Helms. They didn’t give Hurricane too much offense, but there was enough there that it made me wonder for a bit. Now, the crowd definitely got into it a bit and it did help get Matt over a little more, so it’s certainly a Right; that’s just a minor nitpick that I would have liked to see done a little differently. Maybe the way it was done can get Helms over a little more too though, so I’m okay with it overall.\n\nLater in the show, Matt showed up on the ‘Tron to respond to the announcement that Jeff was coming back next week. Matt played it off beautifully, reminding us that he no longer had a brother and implying that another “accident” might be coming the Day-Glo Warrior’s way before he made it to SmackDown, but if he did make it Matt would welcome him with open arms. This was more than enough to push Matt’s work on Friday (okay, Tuesday but you know what I mean) into the Right column; Matt’s promo skills have made a drastic improvement in the last couple of weeks and if he keeps this up and the crowd stays into the Hardy vs. Hardy feud then Matt could legitimately become a main eventer. I know it won’t happen, but how awesome would it be if they could bring Lita back and have Matt and Edge reconcile (on-screen at least) so they could be the ultimate heel trio?\n\nSHELTON BENJAMIN vs. MVP: This is a feud I can definitely get into, and I hope it gets extended out for a bit. Shelton got on the mic before the match, obviously still smarting by his elimination at MVP’s hands from the opening battle royal, and delivered a competent promo that got some cheap heat from the crowd by tearing down Peyton Manning and sold his cocky arrogant persona quite nicely and surely helped MVP’s face reaction as well. MVP got a pretty decent pop on the way to the ring, and we quickly got into a very good match that had a little bit of time allotted to it so they could make the best of things. Shelton targeted the midsection of MVP and we had some good psychology around that; we had some suplex trading, which is something we haven’t seen much in matches lately and seemed pretty impressive as a result. Things picked up nicely from there and both guys came out looking good, with MVP picking up the win to seem like a threat in this burgeoning feud. These two guys work really well off each other and this match built my excitement for the upcoming title match, which was exactly what it needed to do. Excellent work by both men.\n\nEVE vs. MICHELLE McCOOL: Eve was making her SmackDown in-ring debut following the attack from Michelle a few weeks ago…and dayum, that top! Seriously folks, just wow. Michelle got her share of heat on the way out, which is good to see that her heel turn is working; she played it up fairly well by jawing with some fans as she posed on the apron and turnbuckle. Now, this is how a Butterfly division squash should go, for the record. Michelle played the dominant heel, beating Eve around and kicking her while she was down. What shocked me was what happened when Eve took control. Who the hell taught her how to work? I ask because they need a bonus; Eve doesn’t have a Valde-noit level work rate or anything, but she did remarkably well in this losing effort and provided Michelle with exactly what she needed in the squash win. Michelle played it up perfectly too, mocking Eve in the ring and at one point saying “This is way too easy!” while she had Eve in her modified single-leg crab. Was this a better match then the six-man tag? I won’t go that far. However, expectations play a factor and this certainly exceeded mine. Having Maria show up to save Eve was nice as well, though frankly I’d rather see an Eve/Michelle feud based on in-ring work then Maria/Michelle. All in all, good stuff from the Butterfly ladies here.\n\nPURGATORY:\n\nELIMINATION CHAMBER QUALIFYING BATTLE ROYALE: SmackDown started off with Vladimir Kozlov making his way down to an already-crowded ring. God damn it, they’re still promoting him as “undefeated.” Do they think we’ve already forgotten that Kozlov DID NOT WIN his triple threat match last week to qualify for the Elimination Chamber, or do they think we don’t know the difference between “undefeated” and “has not been pinned or made to submit, but has lost even singles matches by DQ”? Either way, it’s really damned irritating. The Great Khali came out next and last before Vickie came out to draw some heat with her tag line. She announced that Jeff was getting his rematch if he could show up in time for No Way Out. So let me see if I understand this…he gets run off the road by a speeding car and has pyro blow up in his face and he’s fine, but he takes a chair shot from his brother and he’s out for the count? Matt must have the sickest chair shot in existence. Anyway, the point was that the twelve guys in the ring were fighting for the last Elimination Chamber spot. Hey, a Scotty Goldman sighting? Sure, he didn’t last long, but it’s nice to see him. We even had a Kizarney appearance, which was almost as short. Basically, this was the usual chaos for most of the match with a few meaningless eliminations before Shelton and MVP went out to send us to commercial. Khali then did some quick eliminating before Kozlov gave him a surprise elimination out of nowhere. From that point it was Kozlov, Primo, Carlito and Truth, and we all knew how this was going to go. Honestly, this wasn’t terrible at all, even if there were really only two or three people who very obviously had a chance. My real issue here is that a battle royale seemed too soon after the Royal Rumble and it just kind of had a “been there, done that recently” feel. Kozlov won to no one’s surprise and then got on the mic to say the same thing he always says…he’ll win matches and win the title. Okay, Koz, sure. This was fine for what it was, but didn’t really do it for me.\n\nTHE BRIAN KENDRICK, MIZ & MORRISON vs. R-TRUTH & THE COLONS: The heels came out first for this, with MnM 2.0 giving us the usual greatest entrance in professional wrestling today—I love that they’re still being announced as Slammy Award winners—before TBK came down with Big Zeke. Truth came down with his partners instead of the usual “through the crowd” rap, but still got about the same pop from the crowd. These are six guys who can really go in the ring given the proper amount of time; I don’t know that this was that particular duration, and the match seemed a little bit rushed as a result. It wasn’t bad by any stretch and everyone involved worked hard, but at the end this boiled down to a eight-minute standard six-man tag formula squished down into five and a half, with mostly the ending being the rushed part. TBK got the pinfall, which may or may not mean he’s out of the doghouse for now, and it kept the feuds going; I just wish the match had been given a little more time.\n\n‘H & TAKER vs. SHOW & EDGE: Once again, the Blue Brand puts all their eggs in one Main Event basket. It works, I’m sure, so I can’t fault them for that but really, what about the rest of the show? The brand champion came out first, which irked me just a bit but I can absolutely go with it as it made more dramatic sense to have Edge staring a hole in the Showster as he came down, and of course ‘H and Taker have to have their big entrances. It was pretty cool watching Edge stare warily at the big guy once they’d gotten into the ring, I’ll admit. Edge has, bar none, the best facial expressions in the ‘E right now—just look at his reaction to the Undertaker, which was absolutely priceless. It started off with a fairly good slugfest between the two that Shane-O could probably take lessons from before settling into a more traditional match. Edge played an awesome chickenshit heel in there against Taker, and Show shouting at Edge to pick it up was nice as well. As for actual in-ring work, it wasn’t their best stuff. The spear being countered into a near-Pedigree looked very awkward and the Game’s Tornado DDT was iffy; they were more or less just going through the motions outside of that. Luckily for them, the more important thing about this match was the drama between the men involved and they sold that well. Had this been a PPV match this would have earned a wRong; instead, it stays as a strong puRgatoRy.\n\nTHE WRONG:\n\nUMAGA vs. KUNG FU NAKI: Week two, squash to for the Samoan Bulldozer; this week the victim was poor Kung Fu Naki, which makes me suspect that the ‘E is still hoping he’ll be a heel, but the fans aren’t quite behind that yet, still cheering him some. It’s not a lost cause yet, but they’re quickly running out of babyface scrubs for Umaga to flatten. As for the match itself…well, short? Absolutely. Sweet? Not hardly. Umaga just flattened the former SmackDown #1 Announcer, but didn’t seem to have the proper intensity. He just kind of showed up, did his shouts, killed the Kung and then walked away. There was nothing much to this and while it served its purpose it wasn’t worth much.\n\nTHE RIDICULOUS:\n\nDID YOU KNOW?: Nope. And, as always, I don’t care.\n\nThe 411\n\nThis was a very tolerable SmackDown. They cut down on the number of videos and recaps which helped the show somewhat and advances a lot of storylines and angles; Matt’s heel work was impressive, MVP vs. Shelton was great and Eve was surprisingly good against Michelle McCool. There were a few problems but I can forgive most of them in terms of the overall show and we got a good program all in all.\n\nSHOW RATING: ***\n\nComment Time with Jeremy!\n\nFrom m8:\n\nI don’t know about everyone, but I’m fairly sure a large portion of us are complaining about it because of the fact that Jericho had Cena in the Walls for about a minute and he didn’t submit, but Jericho was in the STF for about 5 seconds before tapping out. It ended this exact same way in one of their other matches, I think the one at Armageddon, with Cena resisting the Walls forever before reversing it and getting a horrendously quick tap-out.\n\nThis is the EXACT reason people don’t like Cena, because it’s like Creative looked for video game cheats and discovered two that they decided to use for wrestlers. The Contra Code for Batista (^ ^ v v B A Start: Get 30 Title Shots) and Invincibility/God Mode for Cena. It’s ridiculous. Jericho is the only real threat to Cena in the chamber, and having him tap out like a bitch so quickly is fucking stupid and leaves no doubt in my mind that he’s not losing the belt.\n\nAdding in freaking Kane at the last minute didn’t help matters. I assumed Knox was going to take Kane’s place as the obligatory monster but so far there’s the Champ, a (no longer) formidable opponent, two midcarders, and two former champs who only serve as filler material.\n\nSeveral people brought this argument up in the comments section, and I can concede the point that Jericho did tap too quickly. However, I still don’t think it hurts Y2J’s perceived threat at No Way Out because he’s not wrestling Cena one-on-one, he’s doing it in a big steel cage with four other guys in there. Do any of those four guys look like real credible threats? No, not really. I think it’s safe for even the most casual fan to say we’re not looking at “Mike Knox, World Heavyweight Champion” any time soon, nor the same with Kofi. Kane and Rey Rey don’t have much of a shot either, they’re just in there to be the veterans. However Jericho has proven before that he can be a great opportunist and win a big match and the belt out of nowhere, with a lot more going against him. Championship Scrabble, anyone? I agree that in terms of Cena beating Jericho so quickly it wasn’t a smart idea, and I know that Cena’s Superman image turns a lot of people off to him, but he is the marquee name of the company so it makes sense that he’s pushed like a monster. I would have loved to see Jericho hold on a bit and wish he hadn’t had to tap so quickly, but I can forgive it in context of No Way Out.\n\nFrom Guest#0548\n\nCandice and Beth have good chemistry with each other.\n\nIn November when Beth was champion during the European tour, WWE gave them 10 minutes or so of ring time on a few of the non-televised events. I watched one of them shot on camcorder via YouTube, and it was really good.\n\nNo argument, of all the Divas Beth is the most likely to put on a good match with Candice. I won’t say they have great chemistry because they’ve done terrible work against each other two on rare occasions and I think Beth works better with Mickie and Melina then Candice, but they certainly have good chemistry. Hopefully they can improve on their work because Candice has some skills, she just needs to refind her groove she’s lost since her injury-prone periods.\n\nFrom Brad:\n\nOrton’s no selling of the chant was brilliant, the crowd didnt know if to keep it going thn though “oh well, F you”.\n\nNow I said last week in this column could we see the heat ration between Orton/Cena change – The double turn Ive been calling for a few months now. In one of the news items this week apparently Orton is eventually going to be a face, what do you think?\n\nAlso I really hope Steph isn’t part of the Legacy.\n\nI loved Orton’s no-selling too, Brad. As to the double-turn on Orton and Cena, I think that would be a bad idea. Orton is a much better natural heel then Cena, and Cena moves far too much merchandise to have a heel turn make financial sense. The ‘E’s gonna do what makes them money, especially in the current economic climate, and that’s pushing Cena to the moon as a fan fave for the kiddies to buy wristbands and T-Shirts. Could they do a double-turn and have it work? I don’t know…Orton’s last face run was disastrous and he seems far more comfortable as a heel. As for your last comment, Steph joining the Legacy is the direction that makes the most from where I’m sitting; I wouldn’t be surprised to be wrong, though. Thanks for reading!\n\nFrom Sam:\n\nugh god Why is it Beth was the one working her ass off? Everytime I see a good/great match with a former model in it against a woman of the indies, it’s always the latter busted her ass to carry the model. Get over it >_> models can become good wrestlers without being carried. Maybe if Candice shaves her head and starts cursing around the place she’ll get credit\n\nLook at that match. Candice was clearly the one being carried, and has nothing to do with her looks, it has to do with how she did during the match. Many workers look damn good and wrestle great matches…Melina is the hottest Diva in the ‘E in my book and she’s great in the ring. So your straw man argument against me is invalid; good effort, though.\n\nFrom Ryushinku:\n\nThe winner of the EC match sure seems set in stone, but it’s going to be facinating to see where the others fall into place. We’ll be able to see just where they stand on the ‘totem pole’ at the moment.\n\nYep. That’s the joy in these matches for me; frankly, no one expects a title switch just before WrestleMania and I think the ‘E knows that. That’s why they put people like Kofi & Knox in the match, to see how they can handle a main event situation and to pique the fan’s interest in them. It’s not a bad route to go and while some people may not be happy with their inclusion, I’m interested to see how seriously behind these two they are.\n\nFrom Guest#7104:\n\nI think you should give up with the criticising of did you know\n\nIt’s obviously not going away\n\nWell, all joking about my self-importance aside I never expect them to take them away based on my ramblings. But as long as they’re there I’m going to gripe about them, because I think they’re ridiculous. Thanks though!\n\nFrom ScottieD:\n\nThe thing that bugs me about what Cena said to Jericho about being fired and keeps coming back, is that he was fired, not retired. When your fired you aren’t leaving on your own terms, as oppsosed to when you retire well past your prime trying to grasp on to that last little bit.\n\nActually, if you remember Ric didn’t really voluntarily retire either; he was “put out to pasture” by Vince in a kayfabe manner. It’s only because we all knew he was retiring that it’s referred to as a “Retirement Match”; in actuality, the ‘E called it a “Career-Threatening Match.” So in that respect, the terminology correlation between Jericho and Flair was accurate.\n\nBy: Larry Csonka\n\nTNA AGAINST ALL ODDS:\n\nTHE MATCHES:\n\nX-DIVISION TITLE MATCH: Alex Shelley defeated Eric Young @ 14:00 via pin [***½]\n\nScott Steiner defeated Petey Williams @ 11:00 via pin [**]\n\nBrutus Magnus defeated Chris Sabin @ 8:00 via pin [*]\n\nTNA KNOCKOUTS TITLE MATCH: Awesome Kong defeated ODB @ 6:00 via pin [*]\n\nTNA LEGEND’S TITLE MATCH: Booker T defeated Shane Sewell @ 6:00 via pin [*]\n\nAbyss defeated Matt Morgan @ 16:00 via pin [*¾]\n\nTNA TAG TEAM TITLE MATCH: Beer Money defeated Lethal Consequences @ 15:00 via pin [***]\n\nTNA WORLD TITLE MATCH: Sting defeated Brother Ray, Brother Devon and Kurt Angle @ 14:00 via pin [**¼]\n\nTHE RIGHT:\n\nX-DIVISION TITLE MATCH: The best part of the show was unfortunately the opening match. I say unfortunately because when the best match is first, well, it is pretty much all down hill from there. Last month the goal was to re-establish the X-Division, and that title match as a good way of doing so. They followed up this month with another good match, and while not as good as last month, this delivered. Thankfully they have turned Young back to Showtime Eric Young, and with that the man delivered his best single match is some time as he battled Alex Shelley for the title. There were a ton of good near falls, with the good back and forth action that made the X-Division the thing to watch back in the day. The only thing I disliked was the finish. While it makes Shelley a smart and opportunistic champion winning how he did, Young looked like an idiot as he argued with the ref for no real reason. I wish that they would have finished with the frog splash, as that was a hot finish and it would have gotten Shelley over a bit better. But this was a great way to kick off the show. I just wish the rest could have at least hit this level.\n\nTNA TAG TEAM TITLE MATCH: While not quite up to the level of some of the other Beer Money PPV matches, this was definitely the other bright spot on the card. After the hot opener, we had a strand of five matches that were either bad or just passable, and it was taking its toll on me. The good news is that they got a lot of time, and they all worked very hard. It was really what you’d expect. Great team work from Beer Money, along with good heel work and the showing your ass comedy spots (not literally) that pop the crowd. Oh, and I must mention the BOOZER CRUIZER and the ROODE BEER FLOAT, TREMENDOUS! Creed sold the injury well, and Lethal made up for that with some great spots, basically doing all of the big shit to try and get the win. It was a good match, and the only thing I didn’t like was the finish. I really feel that Creed’s injury should have led to the win for Beer Money, it would have made sense and protected lethal Consequences, because the face that battles through injury only to finally be defeated gets sympathy. Instead Lethal took the chain shot in the cliché Beer Money finish. Stop overbooking TNA, take what you BOOKED and use it.\n\nPURGATORY:\n\nTNA WORLD TITLE MATCH: And so we come to the TNA World Title Match, a match that many weren’t looking forward too, but also a match that had a chance to be pretty good. While Sting is hurting, 3D tends to step it upon PPV and Angle is awesome. Unfortunately we never got to good, we got to passable, which for a PPV main event is NOT what you want to say. It was ok, a really good TV main event, but not a good PPV main event. They did their trademark spots and all of that good stuff, but they never got out of second gear. The big swerve for the show was that there was no swerve. While the match wasn’t great, and honestly not acceptable as a PPV main event, the angle stuff was very good. Sting retains, which adds more drama between he and Angle, heading to the eventual split of him from the MEM. Also, what added to that was Foley saying that he wanted Sting to keep the title over Angle. Plus there was Foley’s presentation to Sting at the end as he promised, playing off of their respect, which Sting mentioned earlier in the show that he appreciated. Angle wide they did very good work here, unfortunately the match couldn’t get into gear to make it all worth it.\n\nScott Steiner defeated Petey Williams: Kind of funny that last year these guys faced, back when Petey was becoming Maple Leaf Muscle. They had a decent match back then, and I felt that they had a solid match here. This is one of those matches where the style difference works. I think what helps is that Steiner, while a big guy, used to bump around a good bit back in the day, so he knows what to do and how Petey will sell it. Petey also picks up the pace, and busted his ass to sell for Scotty. I really feel that the match was to one sided, as Steiner controlled so much of it. It looked to be one of those matches where the heel dominates, and the face survives enough to the point that the heel eventually slips on the banana peel, allowing the face to finally comeback and win. But that didn’t happen, and it felt like an extended squash, which is not good at all for Petey. But hell, I marked for the STEINER SCREWDRIVER 2k9~! While I hated the booking of Petey, I did dig the after match where Steiner was beginning the beat down until SAMOA JOE’S MUSIC MADE THE SAVE! Joe promised that he would bring a nation of pain or some shit to the MEM, and that Steiner was one of the five men responsible for the sins he was going to commit. Awesome. I pray that ass kicking Joe is back, because that short promo was great.\n\nTHE WRONG:\n\nAbyss defeated Matt Morgan: After the turn and good hype on Impact, I was looking forward to the Matt Morgan vs. Abyss match on this PPV. But then word came out that Morgan had surgery for an infection in his shoulder, and that he was going to “gut out” the match, and any excitement I had left. They ended up having an average version of the usual Abyss weapons filled brawl. They tried, but it went too long, and by the end, Morgan was noticeably hurting and trying to protect his shoulder, which had to be in a ton of pain. The last few minutes took a pretty good match and drug it down a bit, which is unfortunate. The good news is that in the end Abyss came out of the match with a solid victory, no run ins of bullshit. This was an amped up TV weapons match, which was a theme for the evening.\n\nBrutus Magnus defeated Chris Sabin: Tome this was the definition of a match where they went out there and “did stuff.” Magnus, while he has a good look and a good presence in the ring, is just so green, and that was on display here. They would have been much better served to have a squash match for him, because he was exposed here. Sabin sold well and did a lot of stuff to make it look as if they were having a match, but it was all smoke and mirrors. While I dislike squashed on PPV, the challenge gimmick allowed for that to happen, but they didn’t take that door. Having a regular match for Magnus, where he sold way too much too soon did him no favors. Also, having Sabin go out there and pinball around for this guy did HIM no favors. It was not the worst match ever, far from it, but it also wasn’t very good, and felt more like a TV match.\n\nTNA KNOCKOUTS TITLE MATCH: This was a match that I expected Kong to lose, due to her nagging injuries. It all made sense. The KONGTOURAGE was banned, ODB is still over, and it just seemed too simple. But they went ahead and had a short, but full match. They tried, ODB sold well, but it was obvious that Kong was still very bothered by her injuries. In all honestly, they either should have scrapped the bout or had ODB get the win, so that Kong could take the proper time off. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case, and as mentioned, they tried, but this was not good. Much like Morgan, Kong shouldn’t have been competing tonight.\n\nTNA LEGEND’S TITLE MATCH: After this match I am saying the, unfortunately, the Shane Sewell experiment is over. He had done well and been over big in the Impact Zone, but no one cared about this match. It was lethargic, sloppy, and overall a squash match for Booker. Shane got his hope spot to about no heat, and then what was even worse was after Booker owned him, he needed help to defeat him. Now, I appreciate them not wanting to BERRY Sewell, but the fact is, in this case, Booker should have won clean, especially since he looks to be going into a program with AJ Styles. Which brings me to the next point. AJ makes his return to save Sewell, which is fine, but WHY is AJ’s first motivation to go after Booker T and his fake title? I get that a victory is a knock against the MEM, but really, this bothered me a bit. Also, I hope to God that Booker has his working boots on, because he has been lazier than a pile of shit for most of his TNA run. We all know that AJ will bring his A GAME, hopefully Booker brings a strong B- to the table for once.\n\n2009 PPV Rankings:\n\n–ROH RISING ABOVE {8.0}\n\n–WWE ROYAL RUMBLE {7.25}\n\n–TNA GENESIS {7.0}\n\n–TNA AGAINST ALL ODDS {5.5}\n\n2009 TOP PPV Match Rankings:\n\n–[ROH RISING ABOVE] – ROH WORLD TITLE MATCH: Nigel McGuinness © vs. Bryan Danielson (****½)\n\n–[ROH RISING ABOVE] – I QUIT MATCH: Jimmy Jacobs vs. Austin Aries (****¼)\n\n–[TNA GENESIS] – Kurt Angle defeated Jeff Jarrett (****¼)\n\n–[TNA GENESIS] – X-Division Title Match: Alex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin (****¼)\n\n–[WWE ROYAL RUMBLE] – THE ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH (***¾)\n\n–[WWE ROYAL RUMBLE] – WWE TITLE MATCH: Edge defeated Jeff Hardy (***¾)\n\n2009 PPV MVP AWARDS:\n\nNot every PPV will have one, it just depends on who I think steps up and deserves some extra recognition.\n\n–[TNA GENESIS] Sabin, Shelley, Angle and Jarrett – Rocking The House\n\n–[ROH RISING ABOVE] – Danielson and McGuinness – Defining the ROH World Title\n\n–[WWE ROYAL RUMBLE] – RVD – The Joke Pays Off\n\nAnd I’m out of here!\n\nNULL"
