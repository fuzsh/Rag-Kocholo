        "text": "Essentris®, the military’s inpatient electronic health record, was first launched at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany in 2007 as a counterpart to the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application. Essentris provides worldwide documentation of inpatient care for all beneficiaries and a secure, bidirectional data system link for real-time, viewable electronic health information between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe services added their own input to Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application improvements. The Army created the MEDCOM AHLTA Provider Satisfaction program, or MAPS, which made it possible for providers to reduce time required to record notes. The Navy piloted voice recognition and spell check software applications. The Air Force launched the Clinical Optimization Military Provider AHLTA Satisfaction Strategy, or COMPASS, which focused on streamlining the workflow process.\n\nTo expedite Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs interoperability efforts, Congress mandated in the FY2008 NDAA that the DOD and VA establish a joint interagency program office to act as a single point of accountability in the development of the electronic health record. As work progressed, it became increasingly clear that the architecture of the Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application wouldn't provide a suitable platform for a joint EHR. Plans begin for a new EHR. In March 2011, the DOD and VA recommitted to the joint common EHR platform known as the integrated EHR (iEHR).\n\nOn Feb. 5, 2013, the Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, and Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Eric Shinseki, announced changes in their approach to increasing interoperability between the Departments. Joint actions were identified to accelerate seamless transfer of information across the Departments and replace systems by using a \"core\" set of applications from existing electronic health record technology. The DOD announces that it is reviewing available commercial and governmental options and the VA decided to use VistA as its core.\n\nIn 2017, the Click to closeInitial Operating CapabilityMadigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA; Naval Hospital Bremerton at Naval Station Bremerton, WA; Naval Health Clinic Oak Harbor, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, WA; and the 92nd Medical Group, Fairchild Air Force Base, WA.Initial Operating Capability sites go live in the Pacific Northwest with MHS GENESIS. The new, modern electronic health record for patients and health care professionals is designed to transfer a beneficiary's medical information within the Military Health System and with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Lessons learned are recorded from the IOC sites for future deployments.\n\nOn Sept. 7, 2019, MHS GENESIS went live at military treatment facilities in California at Travis Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Lemoore, and the Presidio of Monterey, and at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, as part of Click to closeWave TRAVISDavis Grant USAF Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, CA; 366th Medical Group at Mountain Home Air Force Base, ID; Naval Health Clinic Lemoore at Naval Air Station Lemoore, CA; and the Presidio of Monterey Army Health Clinic, Presidio of Monterey, CA.Wave TRAVIS, named for the largest wave participant site.

The transition included intensive training for staff, internal infrastructure changes, communicating to beneficiaries, and equipment upgrades, all completed while continuing to serve those who serve.\n\nOn Feb. 26, 2021, MHS GENESIS deployed at Click to closeWave SAN DIEGO Naval Medical Center in San Diego, CA and the 1st Dental Battalion at NMC San Diego, CA.Wave SAN DIEGO. This wave consists of Naval Medical Center San Diego and its ancillary clinics across Southern California; and 1st Dental Battalion. NMCSD is the largest military medical treatment facility to deploy the new electronic health record to date. The transition included intensive training for staff, internal infrastructure changes, communicating to beneficiaries, and equipment upgrades, all completed while continuing to serve those who serve.\n\nOn April 24, 2021, the Military Health System deployed the MHS GENESIS electronic health record to 25 military hospitals and clinics across 12 states, bringing the MHS GENESIS deployment to nearly 30% complete. MHS GENESIS offers a single system to provide improved access to health care information, and enables a more efficient and timely delivery of care.
