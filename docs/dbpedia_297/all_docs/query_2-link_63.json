        "text": "2024 Edition\n\nDr. Thomas L. Constable\n\nIntroduction\n\nTitle\n\nEach book of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament, called \"The Pentateuch\" since about A.D. 160, and called \"The Torah\" [\"instruction\"] by the Jews), originally received its title in the Hebrew Bible from the first word or words in the book. There are three divisions in the Hebrew Bible: The Law (Torah), The Prophets, and The Writings (cf. Luke 24:44). The Torah was originally one book, but the translators of the Septuagint (Greek) version (ca. 250 B.C.) divided it into the five books that we have. The Jews regarded the stories in the Torah as divine instruction for them, as well as the commandments and sermons, since they too teach theology and ethics. The word \"Pentateuch\" comes from the Greek words penta, meaning \"five,\" and teuchos, which was a case for carrying papyrus scrolls, and in later usage, the scrolls themselves.\n\nThe English title \"Genesis\" has come to us from the Latin Vulgate translation (Liber Genesis) made by the early church father Jerome (ca. A.D. 390). The Latin title came from the Septuagint translation. \"Genesis\" is a transliteration of the Greek word geneseos, the Greek word that translates the Hebrew toledot. This Hebrew word is the key word in identifying the structure of Genesis, and the English translators have usually rendered it \"account\" or \"generations\" or \"history\" or \"records\" (2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2).\n\nDate\n\nThe events recorded date back to the creation of the world.\n\nMany Christians believe that the earth is millions of years old. They usually base this belief on the statements of scientists and they understand Scripture in the light of these statements. Likewise many Christians believe that the human race began hundreds of thousands of years ago for the same reason.\n\nMany evangelical Christians believe that the earth is not much older than 10,000 years. They base this on the genealogies in Scripture (Gen. 5; 10; 11; et al.), which they understand to be \"open\" (i.e., not complete). Evangelicals usually hold to a more recent date for man's creationâmore recent than the millions of years that evolutionists postulateâfor the same reason.\n\n\"The history of man on the earth may easily be more than the supposed six thousand years and with no violence to the testimony of the Sacred Text.\"\n\nAnother group of evangelicals believes that these genealogies are either \"closed\" (i.e., complete) or very close to complete. This leads them to date the creation of the world and man about 6,000 years ago. I shall discuss the question of how we should interpret the genealogies in the exposition of the chapters where they occur.\n\nMany interpreters have placed the date of composition of Genesis much later than Moses' lifetime. Some of them do this because Genesis contains some names that became common designations of people and places after Moses' time (e.g., the Philistines, Dan, et al.). I shall discuss these peculiarities in the exposition to follow as we come to them. See also the section below: \"Writer.\" If one accepts Mosaic authorship, as most conservative evangelicals do, the date of composition of Genesis must be within Moses' lifetime (ca. 1525-1405 B.C.).\n\nIn Old Testament studies, some writers describe the \"before Christ\" (B.C.) period as \"B.C.E.\" This stands for \"before the common era.\" These writers also refer to the A.D. (Lat. ano domini, \"year of our Lord\") period as \"C.E.,\" the \"common era.\"\n\nGenesis was perhaps originally intended to encourage the Israelites to trust in their faithful, omnipotent God as they anticipated entrance into the Promised Land from Kadesh Barnea or from the Plains of Moab. Moses may have written it earlier to prepare them for the Exodus. But this seems less likely to me. Another guess is that Moses wrote it during the 38 years of the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. No one knows for sure.\n\nWriter\n\nThe authorship of the Pentateuch has been the subject of great controversy among professing Christians since Spinoza promoted \"higher criticism\" of the Bible in the 17th century. The \"documentary hypothesis,\" which grew out of his work, is that Moses did not write the Pentateuch, as most scholars in Judaism and the church until that day believed. Instead, it was the product of several writers who lived much later than Moses. A redactor (editor) or redactors combined these several documents into the books that we have now. These documents (J, E, D, P, and others) represent: a Yahwistic (Jehovistic) tradition (supposedly dating from the ninth century B.C.), an Elohistic tradition (eighth century B.C.), a Deuteronomic tradition (seventh century B.C.), a Priestly tradition (fifth century B.C.), etc. The subject of Old Testament Introduction deals with these matters. One reliable scholar summed up the present state of this controversy as follows:\n\n\"â¦ the documentary hypothesis is shaky at best and before long may have to be given up entirely by the scholarly world.\"\n\nThe evidence that Moses wrote the Pentateuch seems conclusive if one believes that Jesus Christ spoke the truth when He attributed the authorship to Moses (Matt. 19:8; Mark 7:10; Luke 16:29-31; 20:37; 24:27; John 7:19, 22; cf. Acts 15:1). Jesus Christ did not specifically say that Moses wrote Genesis, but in His day the Jews regarded the Pentateuch (Torah) as a whole unit. They recognized Moses as the author of all five books. Consequently they would have understood what Jesus said about any of the five books of Moses as an endorsement of the Mosaic authorship of them all.\n\n\"Just west of Abydos in southern Egypt, the Wadi el-Hol site yielded an alphabetic inscription carved on the underface of a ledge. Palaeographically it resembled a text found at Serabit al-Khadem in the Sinai Peninsula from 1600 B.C., which until 1993 was the earliest alphabet ever found. But the Wadi Hol example is at least two hundred years older, dating from the time Jacob and his sons lived in Egypt. The argument that Moses could not have written the Torah in alphabetic form that early (ca. 1400 B.C.) thus has no basis.\"\n\nHow did Moses receive the information that He wrote about in Genesis? He may have done so in either of two ways: Perhaps Adam and Eve told the creation story to their descendants and they passed it on to succeeding generations orally and/or in written form (i.e., tradition). Moses' mother may have told him these stories as a child. If so, God guarded the true account of what happened before Moses' lifetime and kept it from error. The other ancient Near Eastern accounts were perversions of what really happened. Another possibility is that God revealed this information directly to Moses.\n\nThe New Testament writers quoted or alluded to Genesis over 60 times in 17 books. They believed that it contained an accurate account of humankind's early experiences.\n\nScope\n\nThe events recorded in Genesis stretch historically from Creation to Joseph's death, a period of at least 2,300 years. The first part of the book (ch. 1â11) is not as easy to date precisely as the second part (ch. 12â50). The history of the patriarchs recorded in this second main division of the text covers a period of about 300 years.\n\nThe scope of the book progressively and consistently narrows. That is, only a few selected events are recorded in the first 11 chapters with intervening gaps of unspecified time. But with chapter 12 many more events are recorded in much more detail with much shorter gaps in time. Genesis begins with the creation of the cosmos and ends with the death of one man: Joseph.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe selection of content included in Genesis points to the purpose of the divine author: to reveal the history of and basic principles involved in God's relationship with people.\n\nGenesis provides the historical basis for the rest of the Pentateuch and the Bible. Chapters 1 through 11 give historical background essential to understanding God's covenant relationship with humankind, and chapters 12 through 50 record the Abrahamic Covenant and its initial outworking. The Abrahamic Covenant continues to be the basic arrangement by which God brings blessing to humanity throughout the Pentateuch and the rest of the Bible.\n\n\"The real theme of the Pentateuch is the selection of Israel from the nations and its consecration to the service of God and His Laws in a divinely appointed land. The central event in the development of this theme is the divine covenant with Abraham and its â¦ promise to make his offspring into the people of God and to give them the land of Canaan as an everlasting inheritance.\"\n\n\"â¦ the book may also be said to be the story of God's free grace in establishing Israel for Himself as His people.\"\n\nGenesis provides an indispensable prologue to the drama that unfolds in Exodus and the rest of the Pentateuch. The first 11 chapters constitute a prologue to this prologue.\n\n\"Two opposite progressions appear in this prologue [chs. 1â11]: (a) God's orderly Creation with its climax in His blessing of man, and (b) the totally disintegrating work of sin with its two greatest curses being the Flood and the dispersion at Babel. The first progression demonstrates God's plan to bring about perfect order from the beginning in spite of what the reader may know of man's experience. The second progression demonstrates the great need of God's intervention to provide the solution for the corrupt human race.\"\n\nThe practical purpose of Genesis is to encourage the reader to trust and obey God. Originally the purpose was to encourage the Israelites to trust and obey God. Regardless of when Moses may have written Genesis, this was his obvious purpose, as is clear from what he wrote. He wanted to prepare the Israelites for the future by reminding them of the pastâto learn from their history. This is its function for us today as well. As we read the text we should continually ask ourselves: What did this mean to the original readers? That is what God intended it to mean to us today, not whatever else we may think it means. This is one of the cardinal rules of interpreting any piece of literature, including the Bible. Once we have learned what the writer intended the original readers to understand, by what he wrote and by how he wrote itâthis is interpretationâthen we can go on to apply what he wrote to ourselvesâthis is application.\n\nOne of Moses' main points in Genesis was that the same God who created Israel had created the universe. His word was the key instrument in creating both entities. As He had brought order, fullness, and rest to the material world, so He would do the same for His chosen people. He is the sovereign of the universe, its ultimate authority. Therefore people should trust and obey Him.\n\nTheology\n\nThe real hero of Genesis is the LORD God, and its stories deal with the origin and life of the believing community that He created under His sovereign authority.\n\n\"What gives the Old Testament its force and unity is the affirmation of the sovereignty of God. God is the basis of all things and all that exists only exists by his will.\"\n\n\"The subject matter of the theology in Genesis is certainly God's work in establishing Israel as the means of blessing the families of the earth. This book forms the introduction to the Pentateuch's main theme of the founding of the theocracy, that is, the rule of God over all Creation. It presents the origins behind the founding of the theocracy: the promised blessing that Abraham's descendants would be in the land.\n\n\"Exodus presents the redemption of the seed out of bondage and the granting of a covenant to them. Leviticus is the manual of ordinances enabling the holy God to dwell among His people by making them holy. Numbers records the military arrangement and census of the tribes in the wilderness, and shows how God preserves His promised blessings from internal and external threats. Deuteronomy presents the renewal of the covenant.\n\n\"In the unfolding of this grand program of God, Genesis introduces the reader to the nature of God as the sovereign Lord over the universe who will move heaven and earth to establish His will. He seeks to bless mankind, but does not tolerate disobedience and unbelief. Throughout this revelation the reader learns that 'without faith it is impossible to please God' (Heb. 11:6).\"\n\n\"What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.\"\n\nstructure\n\nThe structure of Genesis is very clear. The phrase \"the generations of\" (AV, ESV, toledot in Hebrew, from yalad meaning \"to bear, to generate\") occurs ten times (really eleven times since 36:9 repeats 36:1), and in each case it introduces a new section of the book. The Jews regarded \"ten\" as the symbolical number of completeness.\n\n\"The person named is not necessarily the main character but is the beginning point of the section that also closes with his death.\"\n\nThe first part of Genesis is introductory, or a prologue, and sets the scene for what follows in the book. An outline of Genesis based on this structure is as follows:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Introduction 1:1â2:3\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The generations of heaven and earth 2:4â4:26\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The generations of Adam 5:1â6:8\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â The generations of Noah 6:9â9:29\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Â The generations of the sons of Noah 10:1â11:9\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Â The generations of Shem 11:10-26\n\n7.Â Â Â Â Â The generations of Terah 11:27â25:11\n\n8.Â Â Â Â Â The generations of Ishmael 25:12-18\n\n9.Â Â Â Â Â The generations of Isaac 25:19â35:29\n\n10.Â Â Â The generations of Esau 36:1-43\n\n11.Â Â Â The generations of Jacob 37:1â50:26\n\nAs noted above, Moses' movement was from the general to the specific throughout the book:\n\nPart I (chs. 1-11): at least 2,000 years\n\nPart II (chs. 12-50): about 300 years\n\nTotal: at least 2,300 years\n\nOutline\n\nA full expository (explanatory) outline designed to highlight the relative emphases of the book follows.

I would state the answer to that question as follows: God desires to glorify Himself by blessing humankind.\n\nA young boy burst into the living room and announced to his father, \"I know what the Bible means!\" His father smiled and replied, \"What do you mean, you 'know' what the Bible means?\" His son replied, \"I do know!\" \"Okay,\" said the father, \"Tell me what the Bible means.\" \"It's easy, Daddy. It stands for 'Basic Information Before Leaving Earth.'\" That is exactly what the Bible is.\n\nG. Campbell Morgan summarized the whole Bible by saying that the Old Testament is a revelation of human need, and the New Testament is a revelation of the divine supply that meets that need. He also believed that within the Pentateuch we hear the sigh for a priest, in the historical books we hear a cry for a king, and in the poetical and prophetical books we find the quest for a prophet.\n\nThe message of the Pentateuch can be stated this way: People can experience God's blessing by trusting Him (believing His Word) and by obeying Him (following His initiative).\n\nI believe Genesis is in the Bible primarily to teach us the following lesson: People can enjoy a personal relationship with God, and thereby realize their own fulfillment as human beings, only through trust in God and obedience to God. This is what I would call the message statement of the book. Genesis reveals that God is faithful to His promises and powerful enough to bring them to fulfillment.\n\nGenesis reveals that God originally intended people to have an immediate (nothing between) relationship with their Creator. Evidences for this are, first, that God made man in His own image (1:26-27). Second, He regarded man as His son (1:28-30). Third, He made man as a special creation (2:7). Fourth, He made man with special care (2:7). And fifth, He consistently demonstrated concern for man's welfare (3:9). (Here \"man\" refers specifically to Adam, but Adam as the head of humanity.)\n\nGod's immediate relationship with Adam was broken by the Fall (ch. 3). In the Fall, man did two things: First, he failed to trust God's goodness with his mind. And, second, he rebelled against God's authority with his will (3:6).\n\nGod then took the initiative to re-establish the relationship with man that He had created man to enjoy. He provided atonement for man's sin until He would finally remove it. This temporary covering came through the sacrificial system. Animal sacrifices covered peoplesâ sins adequately, but not completely. A final sacrifice had to be made that would remove people's sins permanently. God accepted sacrifices for sin before Calvary like a merchant accepts a credit card in payment for goods or services. A final payment still had to be made, and Christ's death was that final payment.\n\nThroughout Genesis we see that people in general consistently failed to trust and obey God (e.g., in Noah's day, at Babel, and throughout the patriarchal period).\n\nGenesis also records what God has done to encourage people to trust and obey Him. It is only by living by these two principles, trust and obedience, that people can enjoy a relationship with God and realize all that God created them to experience.\n\nOn the one hand, Genesis reveals much about the person and work of God. This revelation helps us to trust and obey Him. It is through His personal revelations to the main characters in Genesis that God revealed Himself initially (e.g., Adam and Eve, Noah, and the patriarchs).\n\nOn the other hand, Genesis reveals much about the nature of man. Not only did God reveal the perversity and depravity of fallen man, but He also identified many positive examples of faith and obedience in the lives of the godly.\n\nIn Genesis we learn that faith in God is absolutely essential if we are to have fellowship with Him and realize our potential as human beings.\n\nFaith is the law of life. If one lives by faith, he flourishes, but if he does not, he fails. The four patriarchs are primarily examples of what faith is and how it manifests itself. In each of their lives we learn something new about faith.\n\nAbraham's faith demonstrates unquestioning obedience. When God told him to do something, he almost always did it. This is the most basic characteristic of faith. That is one reason Abraham has been called \"the father of the faithful.\" God revealed Himself nine times to Abraham (12:1-3, 7; 13:14-17; 15; 17:1-21; 18; 21:12-13; 22:1-2; 22:15-18), and each time Abraham's response was unquestioning obedience.\n\nIsaac's faith helps us see the quality of passive acceptance that characterizes true faith in God. This was his response to God's two revelations to him (26:2-5, 24). Sometimes Isaac was too passive.\n\nJacob's story is one of conflict with God until he came to realize his own limitations. Then he trusted God. We can see his faith in his acknowledged dependence on God. God's seven revelations to him eventually led him to this place (28:12-15; 31:3, 11-13; 32:24-29; 35:1, 9-12; 46:2-4). Most believers today can identify with Jacob most easily because we too struggle with wanting to live independent of God.\n\nJoseph's life teaches us what God can do with a person who trusts Him consistently in the face of adversity. The outstanding characteristic of Joseph's life was his faithful loyalty to God. He believed God's two revelations to him in dreams (37:5-7, 9), even though God's will did not seem to be working out as he thought it would. Patient faith and its reward shine through the story of Joseph. The Lord Jesus supremely illustrates this quality of faith, though He also illustrates the others perfectly as well.\n\nFaith, the key concept in Genesis, means trusting that what God has prescribed is indeed best for me, and demonstrating that trust by waiting for God to provide what He has promised. A \"person of faith\" is one who commits to acting on this basisâeven though he or she may not see how God's way is best.\n\nThe Pentateuch is all about God, man, and our mutual relationship. The key concept in Genesis is faith.\n\nMorgan introduced his comments on Genesis with the following admission:\n\n\"How many people have read the Book of Genesis? I do not mean study it. I have been studying it for sixty years and I do not know it yet. Its heights and depths are beyond me and that is the glory of the Bible. It may exhaust you, but you can never exhaust it.\"\n\nMay all the readers of these notes follow Morgan's admirable example of repeatedly studying and learning from this great book.\n\nExposition\n\nI.Â Â Â Â Â PRIMEVAL EVENTS 1:1â11:26\n\nChapters 1 through 11 provide an introduction to the Book of Genesis, to the Pentateuch, and to the whole Bible.\n\n\"Although the story of the Bible begins in Genesis 12, that is not where the Bible begins. It begins with what we now recognize as a prologue, a preparatory statement, so that we may be informed and equipped to understand the story that follows.\"\n\n\"What we find in chaps. 1â11 is the divine initiation of blessing, which is compromised by human sin followed by gracious preservation of the promise: blessing â sin - grace.\"\n\n\"His [Moses'] theological perspective can be summarized in two points. First, the author intends to draw a line connecting the God of the Fathers and the God of the Sinai covenant [the Mosaic Covenant] with the God who created the world. Second, the author intends to show that the call of the patriarchs and the Sinai covenant have as their ultimate goal the reestablishment of God's original purpose in Creation.\"\n\n\"Evidently an interest in the way in which the world and humankind came into existence and in the history of the earliest times was characteristic of the ancient civilized world. At any rate, various 'origin stories' or 'creation myths' about the activities of a variety of creator-gods are still extant in what remains of the literatures of ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. But the combination of such accounts with narratives about more recent times testifies to an additional motivation. The aim of such works was to give their readersâor to strengthenâa sense of national or ethnic identity, particularly at a time when there was for some reason a degree of uncertainty or hesitation about this.\"\n\n\"The placing of Gen. 1â11 as a prologue to the main body of the work also afforded the opportunity to express certain distinctively Israelite articles of faith which it would have been more difficult to introduce into the later narratives, particularly with regard to the doctrine of God.\"\n\n\"Gen 1â11 as we read it is a commentary, often highly critical, on ideas current in the ancient world about the natural and supernatural world. Both individual stories as well as the final completed work seem to be a polemic [attack] against many of the commonly received notions about the gods and man. But the clear polemical thrust of Gen 1â11 must not obscure the fact that at certain points biblical and extrabiblical thought are in clear agreement. Indeed Genesis and the ancient Near East probably have more in common with each other than either has with modern secular thought.\"\n\nW. H. Griffith Thomas summed up the contents of the first 11 chapters of Genesis memorably as: creation, corruption, deluge, deliverance, and dispersal.\n\nSome scholars understand the stories in Genesis 1 through 11 to be parables, as the following quotation explains:\n\n\"For reasons of clarity and simplicity, the present writer prefers the word parable [when describing the stories in Genesis 1â11]. We are already familiar with this word from Jesus' frequent use of parables as a method of teaching his disciples and the people of his time. Surely no one would accuse Jesus of being false because he told the story of the Good Samaritan or the parable of the Prodigal Son.\"\n\nI do not believe the stories in Genesis 1 through 11 are parables. Parables are invented stories that picture something that could or might have happened but probably did not really happen (e.g., the Good Samaritan, the Prodigal Son). There seems to be too much evidence that the Creation, Fall, and Flood actually happened to conclude that the record that Moses wrote about them, in these chapters, describe things that did not really occur as described. If this is so, then probably the other incidents in these chapters are not parables either. Clearly the genealogies in chapters 5, 10, and 11 record the names of real people; they have not been made up simply to teach a lesson. I believe that the material in chapters 1 through 11 was revealed by God to Moses, directly and/or indirectly (from other sources), and that Moses recorded it as historical narrative as the Holy Spirit guided him (cf. Exod. 20:9-11; 31:17; Ps. 8; 104; Matt. 19:4-6; 2 Pet. 3:5; Heb. 4:4).\n\nA.Â Â Â Â The story of creation 1:1â2:3\n\nGod created the entire universe, and then formed and filled it, in six \"days.\" He brought order and fullness for humankind to enjoy and to rule over. He then blessed and set apart the seventh day as a memorial of His creative work. The God of Israel, the deliverer of His chosen people, is the Creator of all that exists.\n\n\"The creation account [in Genesis 1â2] is theocentric, not creature centered. Its purpose is to glorify the Creator by magnifying him through the majesty of the created order. The passage is doxological [in praise of God] as well as didactic [instructive], hymnic [worshipful] as well as history. 'God' is the grammatical subject of the first sentence (1:1) and continues as the thematic subject throughout the account.\"\n\n\"â¦ Gen 1:1â2:4a is clearly recognizable as a unit of historical narrative. It has an introduction (1:1), a body (1:2â2:3) and a conclusion (2:4a).\"\n\nHistorical narrative is one of several types or kinds (French genre) of biblical literature. Other genres include genealogy, poetry, law, epistolary, and apocalyptic.\n\n\"Genre is of crucial importance, since the reader's identification of a text's genre directs his or her reading strategy â¦\"\n\n\"For the most part, its [the Old Testament's] contents may be described under two rubrics: stories and poems.\"\n\n\"It has frequently been recognized that the final shaping of the canonical Pentateuch [the Pentateuch as we now have it in our Bibles] involves the sorting and placement of material consisting of at least four literary types: narrative, poetry, law, and genealogy.\"\n\n\"The prose narratives of the Old Testament are multifunctional. Most intend to impart historically accurate information while leading the reader to a deeper theological understanding of the nature of God and his relationship with his people.\"\n\n1.Â Â Â Â An initial statement of creation 1:1\n\n\"The purpose of the statement is threefold: to identify the Creator, to explain the origin of the world, and to tie the work of God in the past to the work of God in the future.\"\n\nThis \"beginning\" (v. 1) is the beginning of the creation of the cosmos (physical universe), not the beginning of all things. This appears to be clear from the context. Genesis has been called \"the book of beginnings\" because it records the beginning of so many things. Perhaps it would be more accurate to describe it as \"the book of foundations.\"\n\n\"Contrary to ancient Near Eastern mythologies, in which the earth had no beginning, and in contrast to Greek philosophical thought, in which the existence of the world from eternity is a basic presupposition, the Genesis cosmology fixes by the use of the phrase 'in the beginning' (bere'sit) an absolute beginning for creation.\"\n\nThe Hebrew word translated \"God\" ('elohim) is a plural noun. The plurality simply adds intensification to the name \"El,\" as does the personal pronoun \"us\" in verse 26. Hebrew is the only ancient Semitic language that intensifies nouns and pronouns by making them plurals. The writers of Scripture used 'elohim as a title of honor. Though it is a plural in form, it is singular in meaning when referring to the true God. This name represents the Creator's transcendent relationship to His creation; He is completely separate from and independent of nature. Some have called this the plural of majesty or \"excellency.\" Others call it a potential plural. It emphasizes the fact that the God referred to is the fullness of deity, the only true God.\n\n\"The Hebrew word translated 'God' ('elohim) may be used as a plural noun and be translated 'gods.' But when this word is used of true God, then it is not a plural but is an intensified noun, exhausting the meaning of the underlying root ('alah) which means 'to be powerful.' He 'us' [is majestic and great in plurality]. When used of God, this is not really a plural (despite the common translation); it is a similar intensification of the pronoun which describes God.\"\n\n\"He goes too far who sees in this plural a direct and explicit reference to the Holy Trinity. â¦ he who would claim that the term can have no connection with the truth of the Holy Trinity goes too far.\"\n\nTheologian A. H. Strong defined God as \"the infinitely perfect Spirit in whom all things have their source, support, and end.\"\n\nThe Hebrew verb bara' (\"create\") refers only to the living God as its subject in the Bible. God alone is the Creator; no one else shares in the activity of truly creating (bara'ing). Other Hebrew words are used to describe the creative activities of human beings.\n\n\"The heavens and the earth\" refer to the universe as we know it (i.e., the sky above with all that is in it, and the earth below). There is no single word in Hebrew for \"universe.\" \"Heavens and earth\" is a figure of speech (a merism) for totality; God created everything. (A merism uses two extremes to represent the whole.) The English translators often rendered the Hebrew word 'eres (\"earth\") as \"land.\" By translating it this way here, we can see that Moses wanted his readers to realize that God createdâand therefore ownedâall land (cf. 12:7 and all subsequent references to the Promised Land; Ps. 24:1).\n\n\"The sublime ideas expressed in this first verse of the Bible set the tone for the entire Genesis cosmology.\"\n\nThis verse is important because it contradicts six popular philosophies:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Atheism: God does exist.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Pantheism: God is distinct from His creation.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Polytheism: \"Created\" is singular in the text. An obvious difference between the biblical account of creation and those of other ancient Near Eastern cultures is that the biblical account is monotheistic.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Radical materialism (matter is eternal): Matter had a supernatural origin (emphasis on origin).\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Â Naturalism (evolutionism): Creation took place when Someone outside nature intervened (emphasis on process).\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Â Fatalism: A personal God freely chose to create.\n\nGod created the universe from nothing (Latin ex nihilo). While the text does not state this fact per se, the reader can deduce it from the following evidence: The phrase \"in the beginning\" implies it, as do the Hebrew word for \"create\" (bara') and the expression \"formless and desolate\" (v. 2). New Testament passages also support this conclusion (e.g., John 1:3; Rom. 4:17; Heb. 11:3).\n\nThe emphasis in verse 1 is on the origin of the universe. God created it. He alone is eternal, and everything else owes its origin and existence to Him.\n\nThere are three major views concerning the relationship of 1:1 to the rest of the creation account.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Verse 1 describes God's original creation of the universe. Then God began fashioning the earth, and it became fully formed, as we now know it, in verse 2 or verse 3. This \"double-creation\" view may or may not involve a gap in time between verses 1 and 2. Some advocates of this view believe that the original creation became chaotic as a result of divine judgment. More information on this theory follows in my comments on 1:2.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Verse 1 describes part of what God did on the first day of creation (1:1-5). It is a general statement followed by specific details.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Verse 1 describes, in very general, introductory terms, the same creation activity that God did on all six days of creation (1:2-31). It is a topic sentence that introduces the whole creation account that follows. I prefer this view for reasons to be explained.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Conditions at the time of creation 1:2\n\nVerse 2 probably describes what we now call \"the earth\" in its pre-formedâlike a lump of clayâexistence, before God gave it form and filled it. Here \"earth\" refers to the whole planet, though the same English word also refers to the earth and the heavens (when combined with \"heavens,\" v. 1), and to dry land (v. 10).\n\nIn this verse we learn that the earth was \"a formless and desolate emptiness\" (a hendiadys meaning unorganized, unproductive, and uninhabited), before God graciously prepared it for human habitation (cf. Isa. 45:18; Jer. 4:23-27). (A hendiadys is a figure of speech in which the writer expresses a single complex idea by joining two substantives with \"and,\" rather than by using an adjective and a substantive.) Various English translations have rendered this expression \"formless and void,\" \"formless and empty,\" and \"without shape and empty.\"\n\n\"â¦ no clear biblical text testifies to the origins of chaos [the formless and desolate condition] or of the Serpent [3:1], nor to the reason for their existence.\"\n\n\"The Hebrew word [for \"darkness\"] simply means âdarkness,â but in the Bible it has come to symbolize what opposes God, such as judgment (Exod 10:21), death (Ps 88:13), oppression (Isa 9:1), the wicked (1 Sam 2:9) and in general, sin. In Isa 45:7 it parallels âevil.â It is a fitting cover for the primeval waste, but it prepares the reader for the fact that God is about to reveal himself through his works.\"\n\n\"Deep\" (Heb. tehom) describes the water-covered planet. In the Old Testament, tehom refers to the ocean(s), which the ancient world regarded as symbolic of chaos and evil, which needed overcoming and which Yahweh overcame. However its use in the Pentateuch helps us understand the writer's intent in using this term here.\n\n\"The thirty-five usages of tehom and its derivative forms in the Old Testament reveal that it is generally 'a poetic term for a large body of water'.\"\n\n\"â¦ he [Moses] calls the global ocean (the 'deep') in 1:2 a 'desert.' This is not apparent in the English translation 'formless,' but the NASB notes it in the margin as a 'wasteland.' Moses uses this term (Deut 32:10) to describe the desert wasteland where Israel wandered for forty years. Why call an ocean a desert? What better way to teach the people that the God who will lead them out of the wilderness and give them the promised land is the same God who once prepared the land for them by dividing the waters and producing the 'dry land'? The God of the Pentateuch is One who leads his people from the wasteland to the promised land.\"\n\nSome scholars believe that references to \"the Spirit\" of God in the Old Testament indicate the power or influence of God, not the Third Person of the Trinity. Some conservative scholars believe that, even though the Spirit has always been the Third Person of the Trinity, people living during the Old Testament period did not associate the Spirit with God Himself. They supposedly thought of the Spirit as a power or influence of God. But there are several indications in the Old Testament that some informed Israelites identified \"the Spirit\" as God (cf. Gen. 1:2; 2 Kings 2:9; Ps. 104:30; Ezek. 3:12-14; 11:1; Zech. 4:6). Alexander Hislop has shown that many of the ancient religions believed in a three-in-one god.\n\nOn the basis of comparison with Deuteronomy 32:11 and the Aqhat Epic [a Canaanite myth], W. F. Albright believed that \"hovering over\" would better read \"soaring,\" like an eagle. Moses pictured the Holy Spirit as a windâthe words are identical in Hebrewâmoving over the unorganized creation. As God did His work of creating by means of His Spirit, so also we believers in Jesus Christ are to do our work by His Spirit (Zech. 4:6; Rom. 8; Eph. 5:18).\n\n\"Waters\" is also capable of being interpreted the same way as \"deep.\" It probably refers to what covered the earth, but it also implies chaos.\n\n\"Hitherto all is static, lifeless, immobile. Motion, which is the essential element in change, originates with God's dynamic presence.\"\n\n\"We should not be averse [opposed] to holding that the foundation for all physical laws operative in the world now was held by this preparatory activity.\"\n\nVerse 2 seems to me to describe conditions that existed before God created the earth. Whereas verse 1 summarizes the entire creation of the universe, verse 2 pictures its pre-creation condition. Verses 3 through 31 explain the process of creation by which God formed what was formless and filled what was void.\n\nThere are two basic theories of the creation process that have grown out of interpretations of verse 2:\n\nThe gap theory\n\nStatement: The classic statement of this theoryâthere have been variations of itâcontains the following elements:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â There is an indefinite time gapâhence the name of the theoryâbetween 1:1 and 1:2.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Verse 1 reveals the creation of a perfect heaven and earth very different from what we see around us now.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â A pre-adamic race of humans inhabited this original creation.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Lucifer (unfallen Satan), whose \"headquarters\" was in the Garden of Eden, ruled over this race of people.\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Â When Lucifer rebelledâmany advocates see this in Isaiah 14 and/or Ezekiel 28âsin entered the world.\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Â Part of God's judgment of this rebellion was the destruction of the earth with a flood (in Noah's day) followed by a global ice age, which accounts for the fossils.\n\nHistory: This is a very old theory that certain early Jewish writers and some church fathers held. Thomas Chalmers promoted it in 1814. Chalmers' purpose was to harmonize Scripture with science. Charles Darwin's Origin of Species first appeared in 1859, but Chalmers published his theory earlier, in 1814. Franz Delitzsch supported it in 1899. G. H. Pember's book Earth's Ancient Ages, published in 1884, Â gave further impetus to this view. Many Christian geologists favored the view because they saw in it \"an easy explanation for the fossil strata.\" Harry Rimmer supported it, as did J. N. Darby, Arno Gaebelein, and Arthur W. Pink. Lewis Sperry Chafer held it, but he did not emphasize it. Arthur Custance is one writer who has defended it fairly recently.\n\nArguments for and responses to this view:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The first word in verse 2 (Heb. waw, \"and\") is a conjunction that indicates consecutive occurrences. (This verbal form, by the way, is the basic characteristic of narrative in the Hebrew Bible. ) Waw introduces something that happened after what precedes. Response. The verb tense and word order in this sentence do not permit this use of this conjunction (vv. 1-2). Rather here, as is normal, the conjunction indicates a break in the consecutive order of events and introduces a circumstantial (independent) clause (v. 2) that describes something in a preceding clause (v. 1). This is a waw disjunctive, not a waw consecutive. A better translation of the waw would be \"now,\" as some English translations have it (e.g., the NIV, the TNIV, and the HCSB) . In short, the Hebrew grammar does not support a chronological gap between verses 1 and 2.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The verb (hayata, \"was\") can and should read \"became.\" The translators have rendered it this way in many other places in the Old Testament. Response. This is a legitimate translation, but \"became\" is not always the best translation (cf. Jonah 3:3; Zech. 3:3). Here the translation should be \"was.\"\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â The chaos (tohu wa bohu, \"a formless and desolate emptiness\") describes an evil condition (cf. Isa. 24:1; 45:18; Jer. 4:23). Response. This is usually the case, but not always (cf. Deut. 32:10; Job 6:18; 12:24; 26:7; Ps. 107:40). It is not so here.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â \"Darkness\" is a symbol of evil in Scripture (cf. 1 John 1:5; et al.). This supports the badness of the condition that resulted from Satan's rebellion. Response. This is true in some cases but not always (cf. Ps. 104:19-24). Furthermore, \"evening,\" with its darkness, was part of the days that God declared \"good.\"\n\n5.Â Â Â Â Â The two primary words for \"create\" (bara' and asah, used respectively in 1:1 and 1:25) refer to two different kinds of creativity. Bara' usually refers to primary creative activity. Since Moses used bara' in 1:1, this was the original creationâand not just a general description of the process that follows (in 1:3-5 or 1:3-31). If 1:1 were a general description, he would have used asah, since some of what God created in the six days He formed out of previously existing material (e.g., man and woman). Response. These two words are not so distinct. For example, Moses used bara' of the creation of man out of previously existing material (1:27), and he used asah of the whole creation as the primary creative activity of God (Exod. 20:11). Furthermore, he used bara' of the creation of some animals (1:21) and asah of the creation of other animals (1:25). The real difference between these two words is that Moses used bara' only of divine activity, and he used asah of both divine and human activities. Thus bara' and asah are very close together in meaning. We should not distinguish them on the basis of bara' describing primary creative activity and asah referring to the reforming of previously existing material.\n\n6.Â Â Â Â Â Adam was to \"replenish\" the earth (1:28, AV), implying a previous race. Response. The Hebrew word used means \"fill,\" not \"refill.\" Many modern English translations so render it.\n\nSummary: Though many evangelicals still hold the gap theory, few Hebrew scholars do, because the Hebrew grammar does not favor a chronologically sequential reading of verses 1 and 2. Rather, verse 2 in some way clarifies verse 1.\n\nThe no-gap theory\n\nThe crux of the verse 2 interpretive problem lies in the identification of the chaos (tohu wa bohu, \"a formless and desolate emptiness\") mentioned in this verse. There have been three primary views concerning this condition:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â The chaos was a condition that resulted after God judged the earth that He had originally created good.\n\nExplanation: Verse 1 refers to God's original creation of the universe. Verse 2 is a reference to the form that He gave it thereafter. Verse 3 refers to the beginning of the process of reforming the judged earth into the form in which we know it.\n\nVocabulary: We should translate the first word in the verse (waw) \"and\" or \"then\" (not preferable grammatically) and the verb (hayeta) \"became\" (possible but not preferable). We should interpret the chaos (tohu wa bohu) as an evil condition (not necessarily so).\n\nSequence: This interpretation permits, but does not require, a gap in time between verses 1 and 2.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â The chaos was the condition that characterized the earth when God created it good.\n\nExplanation: Verse 1 states the creation of the universe as we know it, and it is a general statement of creation. Verse 2 describes the earth at the time of its creation. Verse 3 describes God bringing order out of chaos, which continued through the six creative days.\n\nVocabulary: We should translate waw \"now\" (better) and hayeta \"was\" (also better). We should also take tohu wa bohu to mean either unformed or evil.\n\nSequence: This interpretation involves no gap in time between verses 1 and 2.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â The chaos existed before God began creating the earth good.\n\nExplanation: We should take verse 1 the same as in view 2. Verse 2 describes conditions as they existed before creation. We should also take verse 3 the same as in view 2.\n\nVocabulary: Advocates translate and interpret the key Hebrew words the same as in view 2.\n\nSequence: This interpretation involves no gap in time between verses 1 and 2.\n\n\"â¦ the disjuncture at v 2 is employed by the author to focus his creation account upon the land.\"\n\nThe more popular theory among evangelicals now is the no-gap theory in either one of the last two forms described above. Let me restate these last two views:\n\n1.Â Â Â Â View 2 above: God created the earth in a formless and void state. He then proceeded to give it form and to fill it.\n\n\"We would affirm that the first verse serves as a broad comprehensive statement of the fact of creation. Verse two describes the earth as it came from the hands of the Creator and as it existed at the time when God commanded the light to shine forth. The first recorded step in the process of fashioning the earth into the form in which it now appears was God's remarkable utterance, 'Let there be light' [verse 3].\"\n\nProblem: It seems unusual that God would create the earth formless and then form it. It seems more likely and consistent with His activity in verses 3 through 31 that He would create it fully formed.\n\nAnswer: The whole process of creation in verses 3 through 31 is a movement from a more primitive to a more advanced stage of existence. I prefer this view.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â View 3 above: Before God created the earth there was nothing where it now exists, and verse 2 describes that nothingness.\n\nProblem: Some terms in verse 2 (\"darkness,\" \"surface,\" \"deep,\" \"waters\") imply that something existed at this time, suggesting some creative activity before verse 3.\n\nAnswers: Verse 1 may be part of the first day of creation. Moses may have used these terms to describeâin terms that we can begin to understand (i.e., figurative terms)âa condition that is entirely foreign and incomprehensible to us.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â The six days of creation 1:3-31\n\nExplaining the bringing of cosmic order out of chaos involved clearly separating the various elements of the universe. God divided light and darkness, waters and dry land, the world above from the world below. Likewise people should observe and maintain other divisions in the universe, such as things that God has separated in the moral realm.\n\nIn the first three \"days\" God made the uninhabitable earth productive, and in the last three \"days\" He filled the uninhabited earth with life. The process of creation, as Moses described it, typically follows this pattern for each day of creation: announcement, commandment, separation, report, naming, evaluation, and chronological framework.\n\nOne writer believed in six literal 24-hour days of creation and sought to harmonize them with an old age earth model, allowing a long period of time (possibly billions of years) between verses 2 and 3. But this explanation does violence to the Hebrew text.\n\nThe first day 1:3-5\n\n1:3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This verse begins with an astounding revelation. The world came into being by God's spoken word (cf. Ps. 33:9; Heb. 11:3). Each of the six creative days began with God speaking.\n\n\"The phrases 'the Lord said', 'the Lord spake', 'the word of the Lord came', are actually used 3,808 times in the Old Testament.\"\n\nThis is a powerful testimony to the authority of the spoken word of God and the written Word of God: Scripture.\n\n\"The goal of divine action is to maintain and to create life; to achieve this aim Yahweh chiefly avails himself of two means which we encounter in varying intensities in all the realms of his manifestation: the Spirit [v. 2] and the Word.\"\n\n\"The creation of light on the first day by word of mouth (Gen. 1:3-5) is without parallel in Mesopotamian and Egyptian mythology.\"\n\nGod's ten pronouncements in this chapter anticipate His ten commandments at Mt. Sinai (Exod. 20:2-17). All but one of Jesus Christ's miracles occurred immediately after He spoke. (The exception occurs in Mark 8:25 when He laid His hands on a blind man.) Jesus Christ, the Word of God, was God's agent in creation; He was the Creator (John 1:3). The theme of God's word (spoken, written, or incarnate) continues throughout the Bible. His word is consistently powerful, as here. Fiat (the Latin word for \"Let there be\") creation means creation that came into being by God's word.\n\n\"The idea of creation by the word preserves first of all the most radical essential distinction between Creator and creature. Creation cannot be even remotely considered an emanation from God; it is not somehow an overflow or reflection of his being, i.e., of his divine nature, but is rather a product of his personal will.\"\n\n\"This creative word is different from any human word; it is not 'empty' (Gen. 32:47 [sic 37:24]; Isa. 55:11), but powerful and of the highest creative potency. In the second place, therefore, this conception contains the knowledge that the world wholly belongs to God; it is the creation of his will, and he is its Lord.\"\n\nThe \"light\" might not have been sunlight (cf. v. 14). One view is that perhaps this light came from a source fixed at a distance from the earth, such as the shekinah, the light that manifests and represents God's glory (cf. Rev. 22:5).\n\n\"The eternal city will enjoy endless light without the help of the sun or moon (Rev. 22:5), so why couldn't there be light at the beginning of time before the luminaries were made?\"\n\nA second view is that perhaps God created the sun on the first day, but it's light became visible on the fourth day.\n\n\"The week thus begins with the sunrise in v. 3, 'and there was light.'\"\n\nA third view is that God created the sun, moon, and stars on the first day and assigned them their specific functions on the fourth day (cf. vv. 14-18).\n\n\"The Oriental â¦ did not think of light and darkness exclusively in connection with the heavenly bodies (Job 38:19-20).\"\n\nAnother principle theme of the Bible appears in this verse: God is the One who brings light into darkness. Here He produced physical light, but later He sent His Son to be the Light of the World (John 8:12). In the future there will be no darkness at all (Rev. 21:23).\n\n1:4Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"Darkness\" was not a creation, like light, but rather the absence of light (cf. v. 2). As previously noted, \"darkness\" (Heb. hosek) in Scripture often connotes evil (cf. Exod. 10:21-23; 1 Sam. 2:9; Job 3:4, 5; Ps. 35:6; Joel 2:2).\n\nThe Hebrew word translated \"good\" (tob) refers more to purpose and harmony (i.e., in keeping with God's will) than to aesthetic beauty. Moses presented God as wise, knowing what was good for man, and as loving, providing good things for him. This not only reveals aspects of the Creator's character, but it also prepares the reader for the tragedy of the Fall (ch. 3).\n\n1:5Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â God named thingsâ\"called\" them such and suchâin addition to creating them. Having a name equals having existence, as people in biblical times thought, and the act of giving a name meant the exercise of a sovereign right (cf. 41:45; 2 Kings 24:17; Dan. 1:7). In this chapter, naming or blessing follows some act of creation seven times. The Israelites regarded the number \"seven\" as connoting a complete, divine act, as will become clearer later in the Pentateuch.\n\nThe terms \"day,\" \"night,\" \"evening,\" and \"morning\" imply the beginning of the earth's rotation on the first day. The use of the Hebrew word 'ehad (\"one\" [first] day; cf. \"second day,\" \"third day,\" etc.) as an ordinal number also supports this view. The Jews reckoned the beginning of a day with the evening (the setting of the sun) rather than the morning (the rising of the sun). It is probable, therefore, that by \"evening\" Moses meant \"beginning,\" and that by \"morning\" he meant \"ending.\"\n\n\"A few years ago in England some Christians became excited about the Big Bang theory, thinking that it favored Christianity. But they really missed the pointâeither the point of Scripture or the Big Bang theory or both. The simple fact is that what is given in Genesis 1:1 has no relationship to the Big Bang theoryâbecause from the scriptural viewpoint, the primal creation goes back beyond the basic material or energy. We have a new thing created by God out of nothing [Lat. ex nihilo] by fiat [formal decree], and this is the distinction.\"\n\nNevertheless, though it is not the same, \"The Big Bang theory sounds very much like the story that the Old Testament has been telling a long time.\"\n\nFrom the beginning God made divisions. He later divided the clean from the unclean, the holy from the unholy, the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies, and Israel from the nations. This shows His sovereignty (ultimate authority). And it shows that He intended that some things should remain separate and distinct from other things. This is important to note since some radicals advocate that we should do away with all distinctions under the banner of \"equality.\"\n\nThe second day 1:6-8\n\n1:6Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The \"expanse\" (Heb. raqia') refers to the heavens above the earth (lit. \"something stretched out\"; i.e., the sky, comprising the atmosphere, the solar system, and the universe beyond). Some English translators have rendered this Hebrew word \"firmament\" (AV, from the Latin firmamentum), or \"vault\" (TNIV). God placed the sun, moon, and stars in it (vv. 16-17). The ancients grouped the stars and planets together, referring to the former as fixed stars and the latter as wandering stars (cf. Jude 13).\n\n1:7Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â God \"separated the waters\" so that some of them remained on the earth in a liquid state, and some remained above the earth as moisture in the atmosphere, probably as cloudsâbut not as a celestial ocean of solid water above the earth. Before God made this division there may have been a dense fog over the whole surface of the earth.\n\n1:8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"Heaven\" is the same as the \"expanse.\" Moses used \"heaven\" here as a general term to describe everything above the earth from man's viewpoint (v. 8).\n\nThe third day 1:9-13\n\n1:9Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"The waters below the heavens\" (Heb. yammim) probably refers broadly to all bodies of water, not just oceans. Gathering them into one place does not mean that all the bodies of water were one huge ocean necessarily, but that God separated the bodies of water on the earth from the dry land on the earth.\n\n\"â¦ what we call geologic formations took place in titanic and gigantic measure at a vastly accelerated pace in a truly miraculous creative work as astounding as the rest.\"\n\n1:10Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The separation of water from the land, so that man could enjoy the land, prepares us for the stories of the Flood (chs. 6â9) and the Red Sea crossing (Exod. 14â15). God later used the waters as His instrument to judge those who opposed His will. The \"waters\" were an obstacle to man's enjoying the land, so God removed them from the land. Even though the Hebrew word 'eres (\"earth\") appears in both this verse and verse 1, it does not refer to the same thing in both cases. In verse 1 it refers to the entire planet, but in this verse it refers to dry land in contrast to oceans.\n\n\"Good\" (Heb. tob) indicates beauty as well as purpose and order. Here it is not good as opposed to evil, since evil was then unknown, but good in the sense of pleasing to God. It was only when the land was ready for man that God called it good. This shows God's loving concern for human beings. The land was good for people. A good God provided a good land for good people.\n\n1:11Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Moses described the \"plants yielding seed, and fruit trees â¦ bearing fruit according to their kind with seed in them.\" Perhaps he did so because these are the plants that provide food and shelter for man. He created others, of course, but Moses may have been stressing God's care for humans. Another possibility is that \"plants\" and \"trees\" encompass all \"vegetation.\"\n\nSince God created \"plants yielding seed\" the original creation evidently had the appearance of age. He created trees with rings and Adam as an adult. The presence of \"seed\" also shows that God intended the vegetation to reproduce.\n\n1:12-13Â Â Â Â Â \"Kind\" (Heb. min) is not a biologically exact term. It indicates that God created several different families of plants as separate acts of creation (cf. vv. 21, 24-25; 6:20; 7:14; Lev. 11:14-29; Deut. 14:13-18). All plants, therefore, did not evolve from one. Creationists generally affirm microevolution (the development of different varieties of plants and animals through crossbreeding), but deny macroevolution (the development of all plants from one plant, animals from plants, and humans from animals).\n\n\"With the conclusion of the third day yet another color is added to God's cosmos. To the basic white and black of day and night has been added the blue of sky and sea. Now the canvas is adorned with green. The golden-yellow sun and the reddish human being will complete this rainbow of colors.\"\n\nNote that on the first and second days God did one creative work each day: He created light and the firmament. On the third day He did two works: He created the land and vegetation. Similarly, on the fourth and fifth days, God did one work each day: He created the lights and their functions on the fourth day, and the birds and fish on the fifth day. Then on the sixth day He again did two works: He created the land animals and man. On the first three days He gave form to what was formless, and on the last three days He filled what was empty (cf. v. 1). On the first three days He created motionless objects, and on the last three days He created objects that move or appear to move.\n\n\"Both vegetation and humanity, symbolizing the fertility of life, were considered pinnacles of creation in the ancient Near East. The first triad [of days] ends climactically with the creation of vegetation; the second, the creation of humanity.\"\n\nThe fourth day 1:14-19\n\n1:14-15Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"â¦ the Hebrew text reads, 'And God said, \"Let the lights in the expanse of the sky be for separating.â¦\"' In other words, in v. 14 God's command assumes that the lights are already in the expanse, and in response to his command the lights are given a purpose, namely, 'to separate the day from the night' and 'to mark the seasons and days and years.'\"\n\n\"The term 'signs' has been given special attention by the author elsewhere in the Pentateuch. For example, the so-called 'plagues' of Egypt are, in fact, called 'signs' by the author of the Pentateuch (e.g., Deut 29:2-3). The meaning given this term in the Exod account â¦ is that the acts of God in the bringing of disorder upon the Egyptians were 'signs' that God was more powerful and majestic than the Egyptians' gods. This sense of the term 'signs' fits well in Gen 1:14. The author says that not only are the sun and moon to give light upon the land but they are to be visual reminders of the power and majesty of God. They are 'signs' of who the God of the covenant is. The [sic They] are 'telling of the glory of God,' as the psalmist puts it (Ps 19:1). Not only does the term 'signs' serve as a reminder of the greatness and glory of God for the author of the Pentateuch, 'signs' are also a frequent reminder in the Pentateuch of his grace and mercy (Gen 4, 9, 17).\"\n\nMoses did not mean that these signs were the signs of the zodiac or astrological signs.\n\n\"The narrative stresses their function as servants, subordinate to the interests of the earth â¦ This differs significantly from the superstitious belief within pagan religion that the earth's destiny is dictated by the course of the stars.\"\n\n\"Here is a stern warning for our times for any who would seek the stars in charting their lives.\"\n\nThe Hebrew word translated \"seasons\" appears elsewhere in the Pentateuch. It means \"appointments,\" but the translators have also rendered it \"feasts\" in Leviticus.\n\n\"They [the sun and moon] were not mere lights or reminders of God's glory, they were, as well, calendars for the celebration of the covenant. The world is made for the [Mosaic] covenant. Already at creation, the land was being prepared for the covenant.\"\n\n1:16Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Why did Moses use the terms \"greater\" and \"lesser light(s)\" to describe the sun and moon? He probably did so, not just because of their relative size, but because these Hebrew words, which are very similar in other Semitic languages, are also the names of pagan gods. He wanted the Israelites to appreciate the fact that their God had created the entities their pagan neighbors worshipped as gods.\n\n\"â¦ the biblical creation story gives the stars only the barest mention, as though the writer shrugged and said, 'And, oh, yes. He also made the stars.'\"\n\n1:17Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The writer's perspective throughout is earth-oriented. He used phenomenological language (of appearance) that is very common in the Old Testament. Even modern scientific textbooks use such language without fear of being criticized as unscientificâwhen they refer to \"sunrise,\" \"sunset,\" etc. Moses and the other biblical writers did not believe that the earth was at the center of the universe and that the sun revolved around the earth.\n\n\"Where has the interpretation arisen that the Bible presents [such] a geocentric picture? This arose in the post-New Testament times when leading theologians adopted the Ptolemaic cosmology of the second century AD and interpreted the Bible on the basis of this nonbiblical cosmology.\"\n\n1:18-19Â Â Â Â Â Probably God created light on the first day (v. 3), but then on the fourth day the sun, moon, and stars appeared distinctly for the first time. Another view is that, since God did not create the sun and moon until the fourth day, we should understand the \"days\" of creation as longer than 24-hour days. Still another view is that God created the sun, moon, and stars on the first day, but they did not become bearers of light (luminaries) until the fourth day.\n\n\"This, the fourth day, is the only day on which no divine word subsequent to the fulfillment is added. On days 1-3 this divine word names the created objects (vv 5, 8, 10); on days 5-6 the creatures are blessed (vv 22, 28). The omission may be just elegant stylistic variation, or it may be a deliberate attempt to avoid naming 'sun' and 'moon' with their connotations of deity.\"\n\nTo summarize, the luminaries (lights, objects that shine) served four purposes.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â They distinguished day from night.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â They provided signs.\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â They distinguished the seasons.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â Â They illuminated the earth.\n\nCreationists have proposed several solutions to the problem of how light from stars, that are millions of light-years away, could get to Adam if the universe was only days old. These explanations are too involved to discuss here, but I have included some sources for further study in the following footnote. I think the best explanation is the appearance of age. As God created humans, plants, and animals fully formed, so He created the light from distant stars already visible on the earth.\n\nThe fifth day 1:20-23\n\n1:20Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â On the fifth day God created living creature to live in the water and birds to fly above the earth.\n\n1:21Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The \"great sea creatures\" (Heb. tauninim) were large fish, whales, squid, and all large creatures living in the water (cf. Ps. 104:25-26). The pagans worshipped these, but they are under God's authority. The Old Testament writers adopted pagan imagery, but not pagan theology. The selectionÂ of these large creatures for mention may also have been for the purpose of balance: to show that God made all creatures, great and small. Again, He created various \"kinds\" of these creatures (cf. vv. 11-12). These creatures too He evaluated as \"good\" (cf. vv. 10, 12, 18).\n\n1:22-23Â Â Â Â Â Interestingly this first mention of God's blessing (\"God blessed them\") refers to fish and birds! These creatures also had the capability to reproduce themselves (cf. v. 12). Birds and fish rule their respective realms by multiplying.\n\n\"The blessing of God is one of the great unifying themes of Genesis. God blesses animals (1:22), mankind (1:28), the Sabbath (2:3), Adam (5:2), Noah (9:1), and frequently the patriarchs (12:2-3; 17:16, 20, etc.). God's blessing is most obviously visible in the gift of children, as this is often coupled with 'being fruitful and multiplying.' But all aspects of life can express this blessing: crops, family, and nation (Deut 28:1-14). Where modern man talks of success, OT man talked of blessing.\"\n\nNote that Moses wrote that God created both marine animals and birds on the same \"day.\" Evolution claims that birds evolved from reptiles, and that this process took millions of years.\n\nThe sixth day 1:24-31\n\n1:24-25Â Â Â Â Â \"Creature[s]\" translates the Hebrew word nephesh, which is usually translated \"soul\" (e.g., 2:7). This Hebrew word, and the English \"soul,\" imply conscious life, in contrast to plants that have unconscious life. So in the sense of having conscious life, animals as well as people have souls. \"Livestock\" refers to domesticated animals (that man could tame), and \"animals\" refers to wild animals.\n\nWhat happened to the dinosaurs? Conservative Bible interpreters generally believe they existed, having been created along with the other animals, but that they became extinct, either before the Flood or after it. One opinion is as follows:\n\n\"Before the Flood, dinosaurs and man lived together on our planet. Extinction of the great marine reptiles, along with the majority of all other types of sea creature, would have been caused by the violent upheavals of the Flood, many being buried and preserved as fossils.\"\n\n1:26Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"Us\" is probably a plural of intensification (or potentiality or majesty; see my comment on verse 1 above), though some regard it as a plural of self-deliberation (cf. 11:7; Ps. 2:3). Others believe that God was addressing His heavenly court (cf. Isa. 6:8). However \"us\" does not include the angels, since God made man in His image alone, not also in the image of angels. \"Us\" gives us another hintâand it is only a hint at this pointâthat God is a triune being (cf. v. 1, \"Elohim\"). As Scripture unfolds it becomes clear that God is indeed a triune being. God the Father may have been addressing the other two members of the Trinity. (This is an anthropomorphism: a description of God in human terms, in this case doing something that humans do. ) However we should not use this verse as a formal proof of the Trinity, since this reference by itself does not prove that one God exists in three persons.\n\n\"Although the Christian Trinity cannot be derived solely from the use of the plural, a plurality within the unity of the Godhead may be derived from the passage.\"\n\nThe theological controversy in Moses' day was not between trinitarianism and unitarianism but between one self-existent, sovereign, good Godâand many limited, capricious, often wicked gods.\n\nSome feminists have restricted the use of \"man\" (v. 26; AV and some other translations) to males, but this is not the primary meaning of the English word. Its primary meaning is \"human being\" or \"human race,\" according to the standard Oxford dictionaries. Likewise \"mankind\" normally means \"the human race\" or \"humanity,\" unless it is in contrast to \"womankind.\" The Hebrew word adam also has a broad range of meanings, from \"the human race\" to \"Adam.\" Consequently I have used these English words, trusting that the reader will interpret them in harmony with their customary meanings.\n\nWhat does being made in the image of God involve? We can learn this from the context. God created all the plants and animals with the capacity to reproduce \"after their (or its) kind\" (vv. 11, 12 [twice], 21, 24 [twice], 25 [twice]). Oak trees bring forth little oak trees, dogs reproduce little dogs, etc. Likewise, a personal God created persons.\n\nBut man was also made to rule \"over all the earth\" (the plants and animals, v. 28). So God not only created mankind (male and female, v. 27) with the ability to \"be fruitful and multiply\" (v. 28), but He created human beings so that they could also carry out His desires. Thus the image of God involves the capacity to interact with God in order to serve as His representative ruler on earth.\n\n\"Morally responsible personality is what is meant by 'the image of God.' â¦ Personality involves three things: self-consciousness, reasoning power, and moral sense. In other words, any being that can say to himself: 'I am, I ought, I will,' is made in the image of God.\"\n\nParents not only produce a child physically, but they normally desire that their child will carry out their desires. The child bears the image or likeness of the parent both in how he or she looks and in how he or she behaves, that is, in his or her obedience to the will of the parent. Children who follow in their parents' footsteps by their obedience really reflect the image of their parents. Just so, Adam and Eve were created to represent God by carrying out His desires and will and so reveal His image.\n\n\"Image and likeness, means an image which is like. The simple declaration of the Scripture is that man at his creation was like God.\"\n\n\"Image\" and \"likeness\" are essentially synonymous terms. Both indicate personality, moral, and spiritual qualities that God and man share (i.e., self-consciousness, God-consciousness, freedom, responsibility, speech, moral discernment, etc.) These distinguish humans from the animals, which have no God-consciousness even though they have conscious life. Some writers have called the image of God man's \"spiritual personality.\" In another sense man is the image of God (e.g., he rules and creates as God does, under God's authority, thus reflecting God). The Fall obscured but did not obliterate the image of God in man (cf. 9:6).\n\n\"What is the image of God in man? The traditional view is that God's image is certain moral, ethical, and intellectual abilities. A more recent view, based on Hebrew grammar and the knowledge of the ancient Middle East, interprets the phrase as meaning 'Let us make man as our image' (the Hebrew preposition in this phrase can be translated as). In ancient times an emperor might command statues of himself to be placed in remote parts of his empire. These symbols would declare that these areas were under his power and reign. So God placed humankind as living symbols of Himself on earth to represent His reign. This interpretation fits well with the command that followsâto reign over all that God has made.\"\n\nDoes the image of God in man include man's body?\n\n\"Most theologians have recognized that that [sic] we cannot interpret it [i.e., the phrase 'the image of God'] literallyâthat is, that man's physical being is in the image of God. Such an interpretation should be rejected for at least four reasons. In the first place, we are told elsewhere that God is a spirit (John 4:24; Isa. 31:3) and that he is ubiquitous [present everywhere] (1 Kgs. 8:27). In the second place, a literal interpretation would leave us with all sorts of bizarre questions. If man's physical being is in the image of God we would immediately wonder what, if any organs, God possesses. Does he have sexual organs, and if so, which? Does he have the form of a man, or of a woman, or both? The very absurdity that God is a sexual being renders this interpretation highly unlikely. Thirdly, it seems unlikely that man's dignity above the rest of the animals (Gen. 9:5 f.; Jas. 3:7-9) is due to his slight physiological differences from them. Is it credible that animals may be killed but that man may not be killed because his stature is slightly different? Finally, a literal interpretation seems not only contradictory to the rest of Scripture, and unlikely, but also inappropriate, Gardener aptly observed: 'But our anatomy and physiology is demanded by our terrestrial habitat, and quite inappropriate to the one who inhabits eternity.' For these reasons, theologians have concluded that the statement in Genesis 1:26-28 must be metaphorical of man's spiritual or immaterial nature.\"\n\n\"â¦ although God's glory shines forth in the outer man, yet there is no doubt that the proper seat of his image is in the soul.\"\n\n\"People are created as (not in) the image of God so that they can have dominion over all things as God's surrogates (1:26-28; see also Ps. 8).\"\n\n\"First, God's deliberation [in v. 26] shows that he has decided to create man differently from any of the other creaturesâin his image and likeness. God and man share a likeness that is not shared by other creatures. This apparently means that a relationship of close fellowship can exist between God and man that is unlike the relationship of God with the rest of his creation. What more important fact about God and man would be necessary if the covenant at Sinai were, in fact, to be a real relationship? Remove this and the covenant is unthinkable.\n\n\"Secondly, in Gen 1, man, the image bearer, is the object of God's blessing. According to the account of creation in Gen 1, the chief purpose of God in creating man is to bless him. The impact of this point on the remainder of the Pentateuch and the author's view of Sinai is clear: through Abraham, Israel and the covenant this blessing is to be restored to all mankind.\"\n\nPeople (\"them\") are to rule over all that God has made (fish, birds, cattle, etc.) as God would: wisely and prudently.\n\n\"Whatever true scientific endeavor has produced comes under this broad charter which the Creator has given to man.\"\n\n1:27Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"Man\" refers to mankind, not Adam individually. \"Them\" indicates this generic significance. God \"created\" (cf. v. 1) mankind male and female; they did not evolve from a lower form of life (cf. Matt. 19:4; Mark 10:6). Adam and Eve were not androgynous (two individuals joined physically like Siamese twins), or each of them a hermaphrodite (one individual possessing both male and female sexual organs). There is no basis for these bizarre ideas in the text. God formed Eve from Adam's rib (2:21), not from half of his body or from his genitals.\n\n\"The image is found in the type of relationship that was designed to exist between male and female human beings, a relationship where the characteristics of each sex are valued and used to form a oneness in their identity and purpose. When God created human beings as male and female he formed them to exhibit a oneness in their relationship that would resemble the relationship of God and his heavenly court.\"\n\n\"By ruling as one, male and female fulfill the purpose of God for which they were created. United as one humanity, male and female are one with God and his heavenly court. And it is this unity between male and female, and between humanity and God, that is destroyed in the Fall described in Genesis 3.\"\n\nAs a husband and wife demonstrate oneness in their marriage, they reflect the unity of the Godhead. Oneness involves being in agreement with God's will and purposes. Oneness is essential for an orchestra, an athletic team, and a construction crew, as well as a family, to achieve a common purpose. Oneness in marriage is essential if husband and wife are to fulfill God's purposes for humankind. (Generally speaking, women feel a marriage is working if they talk about it, but men feel it is working if they do not talk about it.)\n\nGod created mankind male and female as an expression of His own plurality: \"Let us make mankind\" (v. 26). God's plurality anticipated man's plurality. The human relationship between man and woman thus reflects God's own relationship with Himself.\n\nThis verse may be the first poem in the Bible. If so, the shift from prose to poetry may emphasize human beings as God's image bearers, the shift in genre indicating the importance of what is being said. There is some disagreement among Old Testament scholars regarding what distinguishes biblical poetry from biblical prose, so the genre of this verse is debatable.\n\n1:28Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Note that God's blessing of man finds expression in terms of posterity that connotes the ideas of seed and life, two prominent themes as Genesis and the whole Bible unfold. God's blessing enables humanity to fulfill its twofold destiny: to procreate (in spite of death), and to rule (in spite of enemies). Blessing denotes all that fosters human fertility and assists in achieving dominion.\n\nInterpreters have generally recognized the commands to \"be fruitful and multiply\" as commands to Adam and Eve (and later to Noah, 9:1) as the heads of the human race, not simply as individuals. That is, most interpreters believe that God has not charged every human being with begetting children. This seems clear from the fact that God has made many men and women incapable of reproducing. Consequently one should not appeal to this command as support for the view that God wants all people to bear as many children as they possibly can. This verse is a \"cultural mandate,\" not an individual mandate. It was to Adam and Eve as heads of the human race that God gave this command, not simply to them as individuals.\n\n\"This command, like others in Scripture, carries with it an implicit promise that God will enable man to fulfill it.\"\n\nSexual union is God's ordained method of implementing His command to multiply descendants. Consequently sex is essentially good. When God gave this command Adam and Eve were in an unfallen condition. Therefore the descendants they would produce would have been godly. It is particularly a godly seed that God has charged the human race to raise up. Likewise He commanded Noah and his wife, who were both righteous, to be fruitful (9:1).\n\nGod did not make men or women emotionally, spiritually, or physically capable of raising children without a marriage partner. Consequently single parents struggle. As children observe both godly parents modeling a harmonious marriage, they learn to appreciate their own sexual identity, the roles of husband and wife, and unconditional love. Unconditional love is necessary for a harmonious marriage.\n\n\"Subdue\" and \"rule,\" the second aspect of this mandate, imply a degree of sovereignty and control that God delegated to mankind over nature. This constitutes God's \"Magna Carta\" for all true scientific and material progress (cf. v. 26). God commanded Adam and Eve to acquire knowledge so they could master their environment, to bring all its elements into the service of the human race.\n\n\"The dominion which man enjoyed in the Garden of Eden was a direct consequence of the image of God in him.\"\n\n\"Why this need to subjugate the earth? There are at least four possibilities: (1) Sin would ruin the earth, and people would have to expend great effort to live there (see 3:17-19). (2) Satan would defy the will of God and make all good efforts difficult. (3) The earth left to itself would not remain good. Instead, God planned that people would need to manage and control it. (4) The beauty of the earth was only in the garden that God planted (see 2:8); the rest of the earth would be hostile. Whatever the case, subdue does not mean 'destroy' or 'ruin.' It does mean to 'act as managers who have the authority to run everything as God planned.' This command applies equally to male and female.\"\n\nThis verse explains that God's purpose in creating human beings was that they should rule over the animal world, indeed, over all the rest of His creation. When Adam and Eve fell (3:6), they took themselves out from under God's authority and put themselves under Satan's authority. Today Satan is the authority under whom Adam and Eve's descendants liveâuntil they come under God's authority. Nevertheless, God promised to raise up a descendant of the woman (Eve) who would conquer Satan and thereby enable humankind to fulfill the commission to rule under God's authority (3:15). In time, this Seed proved to be Jesus Christ, who will one day return to earth to subdue His enemies and rule over the creation, thus fulfilling this commission. This is really the story of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.\n\nFor a married couple, oneness in marriage is necessary in order to manage God's creation effectively.\n\n\"Our Christian proclamation of hope has antecedents in the theological soil of three divine programmatic expectations first heard in Genesis: (1) God will bless the human family with procreation and dominion (1:26-28); (2) he will achieve victory over mankind's enemy (3:15); and (3) he will bring about both through the offspring of Abraham (12:1-3)ânamely, the one man Jesus Christ.\"\n\nWe have in this verse the three essential elements of a divine dispensation (stewardship, household management): a divine revelation of God's will for human conduct, consequent human responsibility, and a period of time during which God tests people as to their obedience to this responsibility. A \"dispensation\" is a period of time during which God tests man in relation to his obedience to a specific revelation of God's will. The historical \"dispensations\" constitute a progressive, connected revelation of God's dealings with humankind. God gave some of them to the whole human race, and He gave some to a part of it (e.g., Israel). Dispensations are not separate ways of salvation; in every dispensation, man is saved by God's grace, because of the work of Jesus Christ. Before the Cross, people were saved in prospect of Christ's sacrificeâas on credit so to speakâby believing a revelation given to them by God. After the Cross, people are saved in retrospect of Christ's sacrifice, by believing the revelation that He satisfied God's just demands against sinners (1 John 2:2).\n\n\"The dispensational study of the Bible consists in the identification of certain well-defined time-periods which are divinely indicated, together with the revealed purpose of God relative to each.\"\n\nWhereas specific human responsibilities change as divine revelation unfolds, and dispensation succeeds dispensation, people have a continuing responsibility to live in the light of previous revelation. For example, even though the dispensation of the Mosaic Law has ended (Rom. 10:4), Christians are nevertheless helped to discharge their responsibilities to God by being aware of what God required of the Israelites under the Mosaic Law (cf. Rom. 15:4; 2 Tim. 3:16-17). The purpose of each dispensation has been to place people under a specific rule of conduct, not as a condition for salvation, but to demonstrate that people always fail to live up to God's standards and so need to accept the salvation that God extends to them as a gift. I believe that seven dispensations are distinguishable in Scripture, which are: (1) Innocence (Gen. 1:28); (2) Conscience (Gen. 3:7); (3) Human Government (Gen. 8:15); (4) Promise (Gen. 12:1); (5) Law (Exod. 19:1); (6) Church (Acts 2:1); and (7) Kingdom (Rev. 20:4).\n\nThis verse marks the first dispensation: Innocence. God created man innocent, placed him in a perfect environment, subjected him to a simple test, and warned him of the consequences of disobedience. Adam did not have to sin, but he chose to do so. The serpent deceived Eve (cf. 2 Cor. 11:3), but Adam sinned deliberately (cf. 1 Tim. 2:14). This dispensation ended when God judged Adam and Eve guilty and expelled them from the Garden of Eden (3:24). We do not know how long after their creation our first parents fell.\n\nWhereas many people incorrectly identify John Nelson Darby (1800-1882) as the founder of dispensationalism, historian Ernest Sandeen has shown that \"the term should not be used as a shibboleth with which to distinguish Darbyites from other millenarians.\"\n\n\"The system of dispensations is not primary in Darby's thought; and, furthermore, it is shared by many of Darby's opponents and by literally scores of others, some of whom were not millenarians at all.\"\n\n1:29-30Â Â Â Â Â God gave man authority and responsibility to regulate nature and to advance civilization. Nature was to serve man, not vice versa. This does not give man the right to abuse nature however. Neither does it justify giving animals and plants the \"rights\" of human beings.\n\n\"Man is the climax of creation, and instead of man providing the gods with food [as was common in the ancient world], God provided the plants as food for man (1:29).\"\n\nVerse 29 suggests that man was originally a vegetarian. After the Flood, God told Noah that he could eat animals (9:3). Some believe that the animals may also have been herbivorous at first (v. 30). Alternatively, some animals may have been carnivorous from the beginning. In this case, the death of some animals may have occurred before the Fall. Death was a judgment on humankind after the Fall, but it may have been part of what God called \"good\" before the Fall. It is argued that death is a result of moral evil. But animals are incapable of moral evil. Perhaps nothing God created died before the Fall. The question of whether death existed before the Fall or not is one that the Bible does not give a definitive answer to.\n\n1:31Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This verse records the end of the sixth \"day\" of creation, and it summarizes the account of creation just given in chapter 1. Note that everything that God had made was \"very good.\" This is in harmony with all of God's actions; He always and only does what is very good, because He is a good God.\n\n\"Some people ask, 'How can God be good when there is so much evil and suffering in the world?' The answer is that God made a perfect world and man messed it up!\"\n\nVerses 27 through 31 are a general account of human creation. The more detailed account of the creation of Adam and Eve follows in 2:4 through 25. These two accounts do not necessarily reflect a two-document composition (two separate versions that differ) of the creation story, but they illustrate the writer's purpose. In chapter 1 he wanted to emphasize the creation of humankind in the larger context of the cosmic creation. The name elohim (lit. the strong one, translated \"God\") occurs over 30 times in this chapter, emphasizing that it was the powerful God who created everything. \"Good\" appears seven times in this chapter (vv. 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31), highlighting the goodness of God in blessing His creationâespecially mankind.\n\nThere are three major viewpoints regarding the origin of man as recorded in 1:26Â through 31; 2:7; and 2:21 through 25.\n\n1. Evolution (both Darwinian and neo-Darwinian) asserts that all living organisms developed from a single, simple cell through a process that took millions of years. This first cell resulted from the accumulation of chemical and protein elements that came together because of unknown change factors over a long period of time. This view contradicts Scripture, and it is not scientifically demonstrable.\n\n\"â¦ Mr. Darwin's theory is incapable of proof. From the nature of the case, what concerns the origin of things cannot be known except by a supernatural revelation. â¦ Science as soon as she gets past the actual and the extant, is in the region of speculation, and is merged into philosophy, and is subject to all its hallucinations.\"\n\n\"The assumptions of historical continuity and scientific naturalism are no more susceptible of genuine scientific proof than are Biblical catastrophism and supernaturalism.\"\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Theistic evolution attempts to blend Scripture and scientific theories. It holds that God ordered and directed the evolutionary process. This view fails to explain specific statements in the text of Scripture adequately, and it accommodates the text to scientific theory. The major problem with this view is that it is not completely true to either science or Scripture but is inconsistent.\n\n\"In fact, theistic evolution is a contradiction in terms. It is just as destructive of faith in the Biblical doctrine of creation as naturalistic evolution is; and by calling in the creative activity of God time and again it also nullifies the evolutionary hypothesis.\"\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Special creation asserts that God produced the universe and all life forms through a series of supernatural acts. Some special creationists believe He did this in a relatively brief period of time. Others, such as progressive creationists, believe the creation process took thousands of years. This view gives primacy to the text of Scripture and interprets it more literally, historically, and grammatically.\n\nProgressive creationism is another view, but it is not as common as the three view described above. It teaches that God created the universe in several acts of creation that time periods of indefinite duration separated. The process of evolution was at work within these eras and accounts for the development of phyla, species, etc. The following quotation distinguishes theistic evolution from progressive creationism:\n\n\"I do not believe in theistic evolution. Theistic evolution means simply that God guided the evolutionary process so that it is not to be explained on a purely naturalistic basis. It assumes that all living things, including man, are biologically descended from a common ancestor. By contrast with theistic evolution, Scripture indicates that God made different basic kinds of beings and that all existing plants and animals are not descended from a common ancestor.\"\n\nI do not believe that Scripture supports progressive creationism, as these notes will explain.\n\n4.Â Â Â Â The seventh day 2:1-3\n\n\"2:1-3 echoes 1:1 by introducing the same phrases but in reverse order: 'he created,' 'God,' 'heavens and earth' reappear as 'heavens and earth' (2:1) 'God' (2:2), 'created' (2:3). This chiastic pattern brings the section to a neat close which is reinforced by the inclusion 'God created' linking 1:1 and 2:3.\"\n\nThe mood of the narrative also returns to what it was in 1:1 and 2. Silence and calm prevail again.\n\n2:1Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â This verse is a concluding summary of God's creative work on the six days of creation. One English translation rendered the Hebrew word tsb's \"lights\" (NASB 2020 ed.). Other translations have \"host\" or \"hosts\" (AV, NASB 1971 ed., ESV, NKJV, RSV). Still others have translated it \"array\" (NIV), \"multitude\" (NRSV), \"throng\" (NEB), and \"everything in them\" (HCSB, NET2). This Hebrew word usually refers to the stars in the Old Testament (e.g., Deut. 4:19) more often than to the angels (e.g., 1 Kings 22:19). So \"their heavenly lights\" probably refers to the sun, moon, and stars here.\n\n2:2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \"Seventh\" comes from a Hebrew root meaning \"to be full, completed, entirely made up.\" \"Rested\" (Heb. shabat) means ceased or desisted from activity (cf. Exod. 40:33). There is no implication that God felt fatigued by His creative activity and needed to rest. He simply stopped creating because He had finished His work (cf. Isa. 40:28-29).\n\n\"The eternal God did not rest, as one weary, but as one well-pleased.\"\n\n\"Unquestionably, the number seven marks in Scripture the sacred measurement of time.\"\n\nSome other ancient Near Eastern civilizations regarded the seventh day as especially significant, but not the same as Israel's Sabbath day. The origin of this mutual regard probably traces back to God's resting on the seventh day of creation.\n\n2:3Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â God \"blessed\" the seventh day of inactivity in that He set it apart as different from the other days of creation. It was a memorial of His creative work. God was satisfied with the work that He had done (cf. 1:31). Note the unique threefold repetition of \"seventh day\" in verses 2 and 3, which highlights its special significance.\n\n\"â¦ according to one Babylonian tradition, the seventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-eighth days of each month were regarded as unlucky: Genesis, however, declares the seventh day of every week to be holy, a day of rest consecrated to God (2:1-3).\"\n\nNote that God did not command Adam to abstain from work on the Sabbath. This came later with the Mosaic Law. However Scripture does teach the importance of periodic rest (cf. Exod. 20:8-10; 23:10-12; Lev. 25:2, 4; Deut. 15:1-18; Heb. 4:1-11; et al.). Part of bearing the likeness of God involves resting as He did after completing His work.\n\n\"In the first six days space is subdued; on the seventh, time is sanctified. This day is blessed to refresh the earth. It summons humanity to imitate the pattern of labor and rest of the King and so to confess God's lordship and their [people's] consecration to him. On this day they cease to subdue the earth.\"\n\nThe writers of Scripture used the Sabbath to anticipate the hope of Messianic redemption throughout the Old Testament. In the creation account the Sabbath points forward to the time when God will bring â¦\n\n\"â¦ a perfect and complete cosmos out of chaos. The weekly rest-experience of the Sabbath [under the Mosaic Law] served to epitomize the future peace and rest of the Messianic age.\"\n\n\"The seventh day of the week, the Jewish Sabbath, symbolized the old creation and the covenant of law; first you work, then you rest. The first day of the week, the Lord's day, symbolizes the New Creation and the Covenant of Grace: first you believe in Christ and find rest, and then you work (Eph. 2:8-10).\"\n\nThe sabbatical and jubilee years in ancient Judaism also pointed to the liberation that Messiah would provide for His people.\n\nThe structure of 1:1 through 2:3 bears the marks of literary artistry, as does the structure of the rest of Genesis.\n\n\"The correspondence of the first paragraph, 1:1-2, with 2:1-3 is underlined by the number of Hebrew words in both being multiples of 7. 1:1 consists of 7 words, 1:2 of 14 (7 x 2) words, 2:1-3 of 35 (7 x 5) words. The number seven dominates this opening chapter in a strange way, not only in the number of words in a particular section but in the number of times a specific word or phrase recurs. For example, 'God' is mentioned 35 times, 'earth' 21 times, 'heaven/firmament' 21 times, while the phrases 'and it was so' and 'God saw that it was good' occur 7 times.\"\n\nThese characteristics of repeating important words or phrases in multiples of seven, and using them to bracket sections of the narrative, continue throughout Genesis, though not consistently. They help the reader of the Hebrew text identify distinct sections of the text as such.\n\nHow long were the seven days of creation? This is a problem because the inspired writers used \"day\" (Heb. yom) in various ways in the Old Testament.\n\n\"The simple fact is that day in Hebrew (just as in English) is used in three separate senses: to mean (1) twenty-four hours, (2) the period of light during the twenty-four hours, and (3) an indeterminate period of time. Therefore, we must leave open the exact length of time indicated by day in Genesis.\"\n\nMoses used \"day\" these three ways in Genesis 1 and 2: (1) a 12-hour period of daylight (1:5, 14, 16, 18), (2) a 24-hour day (1:14), and (3) the entire seven-day period of creation (2:4). A few scholars have argued that the sequence of days is not chronologically ordered at all. They believe that Moses numbered the days on the basis of content rather than sequence in time. This view has not enjoyed wide acceptance. Other scholars believe that there are some portions of the text that are not in chronological order. There are four major views as to the length of the days of creation.\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â The literal 24-hour day theory. The normal conclusion one would most likely draw from the terminology in the text (e.g., evening, morning, day, night, etc.) is that God created the world in six 24-hour days. This view is most consistent with the principles of literal, historical, and grammatical interpretation. The fact that the number of days corresponds to the number of weekdays also favors this view. Furthermore, whenever \"day\" (yom) occurs with a numeral in the Old Testament, as here, it refers to a 24-hour period. Some advocates cite Exodus 20:11 as support also. The main problem with this view is that the activity of some days (e.g., the sixth) seems to some to require more than 24 hours.\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â The day-age (or geologic day) theory. This view interprets the terminology less literally. Advocates argue that the events recorded seem to require more than 24-hour days (e.g., v. 12). They also point out that solar days may not have begun until the fourth day. Some advocates of this theory are theistic evolutionists. Others are "
