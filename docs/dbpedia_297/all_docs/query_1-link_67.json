        "text": "Date\n\nVenue\n\nIncident\n\nRecorded?\n\n22 Feb 1971\n\nThe Granary Club, Bristol, England\n\nIn the book 'The Granary Club - The Rock Years 1969 to 1988' by Al Read there is a mention of Genesis playing there on Monday 22 Feb 1971 with the following comments: \"Genesis only appeared at the club once as fame took them beyond our financial limits....Those who were there on the night remember Peter Gabriel wearing either a mask or a carnival type head and telling a story whilst sat on a stool at the side of the stage.\" Al also has a website about the Bristol Granary Club here: http://www.thegranaryclub.co.uk/ [AJ Samuels]\n\nUnknown\n\n09 Apr 1972\n\nLem (2 shows), Verona, Italy\n\nProblems occur and Phil does one handed drum solo\n\nYes\n\n13 Apr 1972\n\nLe Rotonde, Cuorgne Turin, Italy\n\nNursery Cryme Tour: In a dancing pub GENESIS wish perform the show. We was about 200 young between fans and accidental guests. I was just 14 years old. Different from as it is known, Peter has had health problems (stomach?) and so the show was played (just 30/40 minutes) unplugged with Phil as lead vocal. From that day i have become a GENESIS upset fan. [RaelMatrix]\n\nUnknown\n\n14 Apr 1972\n\nPalazzo Delle Esposizioni, Pavia (Early Show), Italy\n\nDuring \"The Return Of The Giant Hogweed\", the electricity goes off. Phil Collins played a drum solo and when power returned, they didn't restart the song but continued it from the point they left it at.[Matteo] The show was one. absolutely NOT 2 (I was there). The Police arrived when, after 20 mins from the show start, people outside tried to get in without paying. But only 2 cars of Police got only a BIG CLAP from the crowd and people got in... A bootleg is been released in Italy from that show. A very poor q .ty bootleg, but is been released (NO CD-R). I had a copy in my hand and i sold it to a friend in Miami, USA to make another Silver-CD (NO- CDR too). I do not remember details (label etc.) but i remember that is been on sale in italy during the early nineties. There are some more things from that show that i remember,; but nothing weird enough to tell here. I hope this will help curious people. I consider GENESIS only as Peter gabriel's until He left. After that, sorry friends, Genesis have been something else (no more music). BTW, i love You all, Romano Manara from Stradella (PAVIA) Italy [Romano]\n\nYes\n\n19 Apr 1972\n\nTeatro Mediterraneo, Naples, Italy\n\nPower failure at the mellotron - a drum solo occours while the technician (or Tony himself) fix the problem [Casimiro Baldanza]\n\nYes\n\n18 Nov 1972\n\nImperial college, London, England\n\nSteve played a wrong note during the guitar solo of Giant Hogweed and had some problems to find again the right way. [Edoardo Cantù]\n\nYes\n\n17 Feb 1973\n\nCity Hall, Sheffield, England\n\nLost power during Musical Box which they had to then restart\n\nYes\n\n03 Mar 1973\n\nGrand Theatre, Quebec, Canada\n\nRemember Peter's microphone fall on the floor in the middle of Supper's Ready in the 'All Change!' section. Problems start in the phrase 'And as you listen to my voice', microphone drop on the floor after 'hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause'...then I remember Peter trying to fix it with a grin on his face for the rest of this section. We could only hear back vocals 'the soil, the soil, the soil...' . Problem was fixed and everything was ok for the Apocalypse 9/8 section. I was happy that my memory was accurate, we could hear it here (hope it's still online), at 48:35. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSpnlcoIKbk Date is not exact on the YT video. Still got my ticket, it really was april 6 1973. [Marc Vallée]\n\nUnknown\n\n23 Oct 1973\n\nEmpire Theatre, Liverpool, England\n\nSteve completely botching up the opening guitar work for \"Cinema Show\". Peter of course quips about it, however, unfortunately, his voice is muffled during this moment, as the person recording was having problems with his equipment. So, you really can't hear what Gabriel related, in response to Steve's very embarrassing miscue. It perhaps was a tuning problem with his guitar, or an outright F**k up, hard to tell really. [Mark Bataitas]\n\nYes\n\n08 Nov 1973\n\nMassey Hall, Toronto, Canada\n\nThe band showed up at the venue, but the truck carrying their light show didn't! At some point in the show an audience member yells, \"Where's the lights\"? [Ted Sapp]\n\nYes\n\n19 Dec 1973\n\n(Late) Roxy Theatre, West Hollywood CA, USA\n\nThere is a stoppage during the first few minutes of 'Watcher' (equipment or a brief power interruption). Peter wishes the crowd a 'Happy Christmas' and the song shortly thereafter resumes. [Mark Bataitis]\n\nYes\n\n06 Feb 1974\n\nTeatro Mediteranneo, Naples, Italy\n\nPower failure at the mellotron - a drum solo occours while the technician (or Tony himself) fix the problem [Casimiro Baldanza]\n\nYes\n\n27 Mar 1974\n\nGarden Auditorium, Vancouver, Canada\n\nIt was Tony's Birthday, A naked man (roadie) came out during the set and gave Tony A birthday cake audience sang happy birthday. Peter had a terrible sore throat but sounded great. Peter moved the flash pans back from the edge of the stage so that no one got hurt during Supper's Ready. [Steve Sale]\n\nUnknown\n\n16 Apr 1974\n\nFord Auditorium, Detroit MI, USA\n\nDuring the story of The musical box, someone in the audience shouts at Peter \"Your mother eats shit !\" and something else after that is not clear. Peter answers \"My mother does not eat shit\". After some audience applause, Phil adds \"There's also a bar \" I guess inviting the offender to leave the venue and drink his strangely-originated anger away. [Eduardo de Udaeta]\n\nYes\n\n06 May 1974\n\nAcademy of Music, New York NY, USA\n\nListen to the bootleg, Live At The Academy Of Music, Peter starts Firth of Fifth with the last verse and ends with the first. [Ian Barrow]\n\nYes\n\n06 Dec 1974\n\nAcademy of Music, New York NY, USA\n\nDuring the middle of the waiting room a fuse blows and the band is left in the dark.Phil instantly starts a drum solo while the roadies look for the fuse box which has and all of the stage area has been painted black. After about a minute or so the band picks up where it left off.\n\nYes\n\n08 Dec 1974\n\nPalace Theatre, Providence RI, USA\n\nRaindrops keep falling on my synthesizer. Tony has some problems with his keyboards. Pete makes light of it. [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n09 Dec 1974\n\nMusic Hall, Boston MA, USA\n\nDuring the begining of the chambers of 32 doors, steve's guitar is inaudible and peter plays the last notes of steve's intro on flute. [Andres Pachon]\n\nYes\n\n17 Dec 1974\n\nAuditorium Theater, Rochester NY, USA\n\nWhen Peter goes around the stage in the Slipperman Outfit to Steve, Steve (left) elbows Pete (hard) Which makes Pete Stumble just a bit..... The next day after the gig , it was reported that Phil had his Headphones Stolen. [Raydar40]\n\nYes\n\n28 Feb 1975\n\nParc des Expositions, Colmar, France\n\nBanks' Mellotron breaks down for a few minutes between tracks and Gabriel renders his all to familiar: \"This is called, what has happened to my f**king Mellotron\". Also, during the vocals of 'The Raven', Gabriel forgets much of the lyrical content.\n\nYes\n\n10 Apr 1975\n\nMartinihal-Centrum, Groningen, The Netherlands\n\nPeter starts singing \"And the lamb lies down \" and falls flat on his face on the stage. [Willem Beens]\n\nYes\n\n14 Apr 1975\n\nEmpire Pool, London, England\n\nAt the end of either \"The Lamb\" or one of the encores (\"Watcher\" / \"Musical Box\") a large lady (Janet Webb) appeared on stage. This lady was part of a standard gag at the end of each Morecambe and Wise Show at the time. She appeared on stage and recited her catchphrase which was: \"Id like to thank you for watching me and my little show here tonight. If youve enjoyed it then it's all been worthwhile. So until we meet again, goodnight, and I love you all! [Keith Hartley]\n\nYes\n\n16 Apr 1975\n\nGaumont Theatre, Southampton, England\n\nDuring Windshield they interrupt due to technical problems, so Phil does his drum solo which then leads back into Windshield [Martijn Van Beek] As stated elsewhere, there was a technical mishap during Windshield. The screens stopped and after a drum solo moved seamlessly back into Windshield . Also, during The Waiting Room, Peter has a radio which he randomly tunes into various stations. He picks up the football commentary of England v Cyprus from Wembley that night. This can be heard approx 4:50 in. [Keith Hartley]\n\nYes\n\n13 Apr 1976\n\nSyria Mosque, Pittsburgh PA, USA\n\nAfter the first song Phil says \"Hello Baltimore!\", which is actually about 300 miles from Pittsburgh! He then tries to dig himself out of the hole he has created! [Ted Sapp]\n\nYes\n\n15 Apr 1976\n\nMusic Hall, Cleveland OH, USA\n\nThe wrong tape is played during Supper's Ready during the \"we will rock you little snake\" section [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n10 Jan 1977\n\nFree Trade Hall, Manchester, England\n\nYour Own Special Way starts with a hideous 'Braaannnggg' because Mike's 12-string is out of tune. Phil chips in with the old \"It was in tune when he bought it\" gag. Mike re-tunes and the song re-starts. [Warren Banks]\n\nYes\n\n17 Mar 1977\n\nSam Houston Coliseum, Houston TX, USA\n\nDuring one of the song changes, where Mike Rutherford was exchanging 'necks' on his custom doubleneck instruments backstage, there was a snafu getting it back together (or apart). After some seconds of activity and cursing things apparently were OK (or not) and the concert continued. The next night's concert (supposed to be in Austin, TX) was cancelled ... ? Wonder if repairs had to be made to the essential instrument(s) in Mike's arsenal ... My friend and I had 'snuck' backstage and sat in unsold seats (in the front row, of course) behind the stage, about 20' from Phil's drumkit. Greatest concert experience ever! [Rick Young]\n\nUnknown\n\n21 Mar 1977\n\nMunicipal Auditorium, Austin TX, USA\n\nDuring Supper's Ready Phil sings \"666\" too soon [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nUnknown\n\n25 Mar 1977\n\nWinterland Arena, San Francisco CA, USA\n\nThe band refuses to start the show until everyone sits down, even though it is festival seating. They send an announcer out on stage to force the audience to sit down. It has no effect on the excited audience, and after about 15 minutes, the band gives up the idea and proceeds, playing to a standing crowd. [Rob Lawrence]\n\nYes\n\n27 Mar 1977\n\nSports Centre, San Diego CA, USA\n\nOne overly enthusiastic fan managed to get on stage [during Carpet Crawlers] and, seeing that Phil's drum kit was vacant, decided to play along. The would-be stickman was forcibly removed from his throne by three roadies. PC said. \"It could only happen in Los Angeles...I wouldn't want to be in his shoes right now..\" [Martijn Van Beek] [Graham Collins]\n\nYes\n\n11 May 1977\n\nGigantinho Stadium, Porto Allegre, Brazil\n\nOn the second night in Brazil, half way through the show, Mike placed his hands over his mouth and ran off-stage due to illness. The band carried on for the rest of the instrumental song and then finished the gig.\n\nI may have another version about the incident on the second Porto Alegre gig. Mike just ran out of the stage for good, but someone seemed to have picked a bass and the show went on a fine bunch of songs. Next day, it was the main topic on all radio and TV progs about music and arts. The official statement from the band staff said that Mike was intoxicated by the town's water. In fact, by that time, there was a huge local discussion about germs in it. I was only 11 yrs old then, never had been to a show before, so my memories may be blurred, but anyway it's kind of clear that some roadie got the instrument and faced the 17.000 astonished souls. Anyway, the sound quality at Gigantinho Gym was so awful then, that even myself could be up there playing... none would bother. The local music journalists of that time may have clearer memories (Pedro Sirotsky, Ricardo Barão, Cascalho, Mary Mezzari).\n\nYes\n\n04 Apr 1978\n\nWings Auditorium, Kalamazooo MI, USA\n\nShow suffers from (keyboard?) technical difficulties. Phil does a brief drum solo to let the technicians do their job. Down and Out [Brief drum solo] One for the Vine. [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n25 Jul 1978\n\nMerriweather Post Pavilion , Columbia MD, USA\n\nMike Rutherford loses his footing and takes a spill onto his back while playing the heavy Shergold doubleneck... it appears nothing serious though, still smiling all the while. During \"Say it's alright Joe\", the little table lamp prop perched on Tony's keyboard tips over headed for the floor. Phil shows off the most amazing lightning fast reflexes as he (somehow) manages to snag the lamp with one hand nonchalantly before it hits the floor and sets it upright again. It really was an amazing feat to witness, probably one only a drummer could do!\n\nYes\n\n31 Jul 1978\n\nSaratoga Perforning Arts Centre, Saratoga Springs, USA\n\nAfterglow is played as a stand-alone w/o Cinema Show. Don't know why. [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n03 Sep 1978\n\nLudwigsparkstadion, Saarbrucken, Germany\n\nShow suffers from (keyboard?) technical difficulties. Phil does a brief drum solo to let the technicians do their job. After Motherlode and before Vine [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n03 Dec 1978\n\nKosei Nenkin Hall, Shinjyuku, Tokyo, Japan\n\nThe synthesiser breaks down before Ripples, they play an improvisation. This synthesiser keeps getting troubles throughout a large part of the show and they keep playing improvisations before the next 4 songs. Phil doesn't know how to explain this in Japanese (embarrassed silences). [Halley Ros]\n\nYes\n\n06 May 1980\n\nLyceum Ballrooms, London, England\n\nFollow You, Follow Me: Tony starts the second half of the final verse four bars early, then fumbles around with the organ chords and stops playing ARP entirely until the next chorus.\n\nYes\n\n07 Jun 1980\n\nMecca Arena, Milwaukee WI, USA\n\nOn squonk phil finish the third verse of the song and then begins the song all over again!So it's about eight mins. Long! [Andres Pachon]\n\nYes\n\n09 Jun 1980\n\nPine Knob, Clarkston MI, USA\n\nDaryl is off ill so the band play a reduced set as a four piece\n\nYes\n\n11 Jun 1980\n\nRichfield Coliseum, Cleveland OH, USA\n\nSomeone decides to light a cherry bomb in the crowd after One For The Vine. [Andres Pachon]\n\nPhil sings a five second version of Supper's Ready\n\nYes\n\n27 Sep 1981\n\nVelodromo Anoeta, San Sebastian, Spain\n\nMike screws up the beginning of Abacab\n\nYes\n\n29 Sep 1981\n\nLes Arenes, Frejus, France\n\nPhil makes mistakes on the start of I Know What I Like, it seems that he forget the words (listen in Me And Virgil or Picture About) [Casimiro Baldanza]\n\nYes\n\n03 Oct 1981\n\nGroenoordhal, Leiden, The Netherlands\n\nThe infamous booing concert. The crowd boo the band and Phil has words.\n\nYes\n\n06 Oct 1981\n\nGrugahalle, Essen, Germany\n\nDaryl has problems with the beginning of Abacab\n\nYes\n\n13 Oct 1981\n\nEilenriedhalle , Hanover, Germany\n\nThe audience demands insistently \"Supper's ready for Peter Gabriel,\" and Phil, who is slightly annoyed, sings a 10second version of that song. Directly in front of the stage are some very drunken spectators, some of them British soldiers in civilian clothes who behave badly. They spit, jostle and fight. One or more persons vomit. Therefore, as I recall, the band doesn't come out for a second encore. After the concert there is a radio interview on NDR 2, in which the band expresses their anger and disgust about these incidents.\n\nYes\n\n16 Oct 1981\n\nSporthalle, Cologne, Germany\n\nPhil starts Sarah Jane story and stops: \"I f**ked up, this is Carpet Crawl !\". [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n28 Nov 1981\n\nSavoy Theatre, New York NY, USA\n\nPhil forgets lines to the ending of Firth Of Fifth and starts with singing 'The Sands of Time..' instead of the usual lyric, realises his mistake and mumbles the rest of the verse until he realises where he is.\n\nYes\n\n12 Sep 1982\n\nJohanneshovs Isstadion, Stockholm, Sweden\n\nDuring the Cage Medley, Tony gets a bit confused and begins the chord sequence into Afterglow too early during the Slippermen sequence. [Will Ingram]\n\nYes\n\n07 Nov 1983\n\nHorton Fieldhouse, Normal IL, USA\n\nPhil does the \"Masturbation will not make me go deaf !\"-quote as in intro to Home by the Sea. Not really an incident but who expected this from Mr. Nice guy.[Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n08 Nov 1983\n\nIowa state University, Ames IA, USA\n\nPhil does the \"Masturbation will not make me go deaf !\"-quote as in intro to Home by the Sea. Not really an incident but who expected this from Mr. Nice guy.[Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n10 Nov 1983\n\nMecca Arena, Milwaukee WI, USA\n\nMike's guitar dies and they start that's all without him. Phil says mike will catch up later.\n\nYes\n\n23 Nov 1983\n\nMaple Leaf Gardens, Toronto, Canada\n\nWhile Phil is telling his tale leading into \"Illegal Alien\", Mike, Tony, Daryl and Phil are putting on their 'prop' sunglasses for the \"clandestine\" effect, and Chester is sitting behind his kit, daydreaming, completely oblivious to what is going on around him, thus missing his cue to don his sunglasses. It was really quite funny, as Phil stopped talking he, Tony, Mike, and Daryl just stood in silence and stared at Chester, with their sunglasses on, until he realised it was time to put on his \"Illegal Alien\" sunglasses. He put them on, to boisterous applause! [Mike Kameka]\n\nYes\n\n27 Nov 1983\n\nSpectrum, Philadelphia PA, USA\n\nTony screws up the cinema show solo. He makes some mistakes (bar counting mostly). It's recorded on the \"No Reply At All\" bootleg. [Santi Jansen]\n\nYes\n\n13 Dec 1983\n\nThe Omni Centre, Atlanta GA, USA\n\nTurn It On medley: during the reprise after the R&B tunes, Tony goes into the sustained chord part way early. Somehow manages to get back on track.\n\nYes\n\n09 Jan 1984\n\nPNE Coliseum, Vancouver, Canada\n\nPhil ends Squonk (part of the 11th earl medley) too early, after he try to sing the missing words [Casimiro Baldanza]\n\nYes\n\n17 Jan 1984\n\nMcNichols Sports Arena, Denver CO, USA\n\nDuring Firth Of Fifth, inside the first medley, at the moment of the solo the Daryl's guitar dies after two notes. The other musicians continue to play the same section of the song until Daryl fixes or changes the guitar. So the FOF solo begins [Casimiro Baldanza]\n\nYes\n\n21 Jan 1984\n\nReunion Arena, Dallas TX, USA\n\nThere's a power-outage during Los Endos (twice !)\n\nYes\n\n25 Jan 1984\n\nLakefront Arena, New Orleans LA, USA\n\nPhil screws up lyrics to Home By The Sea\n\nYes\n\n29 Jan 1984\n\nKemper Arena, Kansas City MO, USA\n\nThe band are affected by a power outage during Illegal Alien.\n\nYes\n\n25 Feb 1984\n\nNational Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, England\n\nHad to restart Eleventh Earl after first couple of bars\n\nYes\n\n20 Sep 1986\n\nJoe Louis Arena, Detroit MI, USA\n\nPrior to beginning his solo on In the Cage, Tony got nothing out of his Synclavier synthesizer. He shook his head in disgust and the band played a few more bars until the synth kicked in. [Scott McGregor]\n\nYes\n\n01 Oct 1986\n\nMadison Square Gardens, New York NY, USA\n\nA woman comes on stage and starts hugging Phil. Phil misses a line from \"Invisible Touch\", and the woman is carried away. This can be seen on vid too ! [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n15 Oct 1986\n\nForum, Los Angeles CA, USA\n\nDuring Domino, at the beginning of The Last Domino, Tony keyboards go completely silent and after a minute or so of trying to figure out in which part of the section they are, Phil starts singing at a seemingly random spot at the same time that Chester does a drum fill to signal that the vocals are coming. Almost the whole segment (the \"blood on windows\" segment) is done without keyboards until the problem is fixed near the end of that part. Needless to say, that part sounds quite dull without the keyboards! [Jose Navarrete]\n\nYes\n\n23 Nov 1986\n\nWeston Springs, Auckland, New Zealand\n\nPhil screws his voice completely during the tough singing of Apocalypse 9/8. Somehow he finishes the song, but he wasn't able to sing the lyrics correctly anymore and is mostly out of key. Not surprisingly, Supper was dropped from the setlist shortly (or immediately ?) after this concert. [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n21 Jan 1987\n\nKemper Arena, Kansas City MO, USA\n\nPhil was cautious with his voice most of the night, and then came \"In the Cage\". He hit a squawker on \"I cry out help...\", cleared his throat, and screamed \"...be-FORE he can be gone\" which caused a big burst of feedback. He pretty much croaked his way through the rest of the night and the second night in Kansas City was cancelled.\n\nYes\n\n11 Jun 1987\n\nStadion Feijenoord, Rotterdam, The Netherlands\n\nBand walk off stage halft way through the Turn It On Again medley due to a rather rowdy audience\n\nYes\n\n20 Jun 1987\n\nMaimarktgelande, Mannheim, Germany\n\nMike has a lapse of guitar playing ability during the last part of thats all,but he saves it just in time. [Paul Bower]\n\nAfter some chanting and pushing up front, Phil tells the American fans to calm down and not cause trouble. Later in the set, the whole stage needs to be moved back, resulting ina few minutes delay.[holden]\n\nYes\n\n09 May 1992\n\nAstrodome, Houston TX, USA\n\nAt the Houston Astrodome show, Phil messes up the lyrics to 4 songs in a row in the second half of the set. I Can't Dance, Tonight Tonight Tonight, Invisible Touch and Throwing it all Away all have vocal mistakes.\n\nAfter the drum-machine-only moment halfway during Mama, Tony misses to come in with the chords in time. [Lemon]\n\nYes\n\n17 May 1992\n\nTampa Stadium, Tampa FL, USA\n\nShow cancelled after two songs due to Phil's throat problems [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n25 May 1992\n\nMunicipal Stadium, Cleveland OH, USA\n\nA guy threw a cup of beer on stage and I think Mike slipped on the slippery steps when getting back onstage after doing the ICD \"walk.\" . All without missing a note! [Tony Lastoria] [Matt Lathrum]\n\nI don't know about the beer on the stage (though it makes sense), but during ICD Phil, Darryl and Mike walk down the stage right steps, turn around and start back up. Mike slipped and fell to his knees. Phil realizing it turns and makes sure he's OK. Mike then gets up and they all keep walking. As Tony and Matt say, Mike never missed a note![Howard Blecher]\n\nYes\n\n05 Jun 1992\n\nCarrier Dome Syracuse University, Syracuse NY, USA\n\nPhil announces a marriage proposal of an audience member and this guy is literally set in the spot lights. Then Genesis play Hold on my heart. This event is also bootlegged on video-camera. [Martijn Van Beek]\n\nYes\n\n28 Jun 1992\n\nFestival Showground, Werchter, Belgium\n\nPhil prepared his TV priest impersonation in French, to please the audience. This wasn't going very well and on top of that he got - amicably I must say - booed by the audience, the majority of the audience being Flemish. He looked irritated for a second, theatrically threw away the rather large sheet, kept a well timed two seconds silence, and then flatly said: Jesus He Knows Me. It was a stunning version, believe me! [PebbleToo]\n\nYes\n\n02 Aug 1992\n\nKnebworth Park, Stevenage, England\n\nTony makes a small mistake during the \"Fading Lights\" instrumental but quickly gets back on track. It can be seen on all the videos of the concert. [Matthew]\n\nYes\n\n06 Nov 1992\n\nEarls Court Arena, London, England\n\nI think it was the Friday of that week's stint at Earls Court. There was an apparent bomb scare, but the venue wasn't evacuated, The band came on stage about 15 minutes late, with Phil apologising. [Gary Myer]\n\nYes\n\n15 Nov 1992\n\nCentre, Brighton, England\n\nA very humourous gig. There were several minor musical f**kups by a couple of members of the band, but they all seem to be having a very good time. There was a lot of laughing going on, and Tony was seen to be laughing and smiling alot!! One of the best Genesis shows that I have attended. [Gary Myer]\n\nUnknown\n\n23 Jan 1998\n\nBray Film Studios, Windsor, England\n\nRay tells the story of the concert in front of the world press when he left the stage during the instrumental part of Domino for getting raised with the lift and from top he saw zhat he had forgotten the microphone. He tells this story on the Ray Wilson live album . But I did not experience the concert myself [Stefan Stoermer]\n\nYes\n\n04 Mar 1998\n\nInternational Arena, Cardiff, Wales\n\nDuring Turn it on Again, when Ray Wilson introduces the band, he calls Tony \"Tony Hatch\" (obviously thinking of Crossroads and Neighbours!) [Andrew Ralph]\n\nYes\n\n14 Jun 2007\n\nMessecenter, Herning, Denmark\n\nPhil messes up the very start of Ripples and the song has to be restarted. [Ulrich Klemt] Phil forgot the intro to \"I know what I like\". Instead of saying; \"ItÂ´s one oÂ´lock and time for lunch....He said: \"When the sun beats down....ItÂ´s one oÂ´clock....IÂ´ll start again...ItÂ´s one aÂ´clock and time for lunch.[FredrikBlomberg]\n\nYes\n\n10 Jul 2007\n\nOlympiastadion, Munich, Germany\n\nIt was raining hard, so instead of 19.00 as it said on the ticket, the concert started an hour later, to which Phil commented after Turn It On Again: \"Scheiss regen, huh?\" [Alec Lewis]\n\nYes\n\n16 Sep 2007\n\nHartford Civic Center, Hartford CT, USA\n\nDuring the song Land Of Confusion Phil saw somebody in the audience holding up a cell phone. Phil happened to see the man holding up his phone waved the guy over and the guy handed to phone to the security guard who then gave it to Phil.
