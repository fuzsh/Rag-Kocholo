        "text": "Taking place in the aftermath of a breakup, “Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)” is a power ballad about asking for another chance.\n\nThe song details the narrator’s feelings of loneliness and his attempts to make his ex reconsider her decision to leave, even though he knows his odds are slim.\n\nWritten by Collins for the 1984 film Against All Odds), the basis for the song was an unreleased session take from his 1981 album Face Value.\n\nThe song became one of Collins' biggest hits, reaching #2 in the UK and spending 3 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984 after displacing Kenny Loggins' “Footloose” from the top spot. It was succeeded at #1 by Lionel Richie’s “Hello”."
