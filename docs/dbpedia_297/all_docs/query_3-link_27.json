        "text": "I have been wondering lately which version of Behind the lines people prefer?\n\nThis is between\n\nThe Classic 80' Genesis Duke opener\n\nOr the jazzy 81' Collins Face Value version.\n\nI’ll vote for Genesis although I love both. The Genesis one gets it as much because it’s the bookends of Duke as for the song itself where Collins version may edge it. So confusing...\n\nNeither I would just hear firth of fifth\n\nOr dancing with the moonlit knight again.\n\nNo but all jokes aside I prefer the Duke version.\n\nThe Genesis version. Kicks off the album in a spectacular fashion, going places before quite quietly fading into Duchess which (along the Guide Vocal) serves as an emotional buildup to the epic Man Of Our Times. Those first four tracks are a great long piece. And Behind The Lines kicks it off the right way in my opinion.\n\nI like Phil's version too, but this song works best the way it was originally recorded for me.\n\nEdit: a poll would really be helpful, I think.\n\nPersonally I think Phil was hitting on something in his early solo career with edgy songs like In the Air Tonight, The Roof is Leaking, Man on the Corner, I Don't Care Anymore. Then Against all Odds signified his permanent shift into MOR schlock. Essentially 1981-1982 Phil was more like Peter Gabriel, but it was too tempting to sell out.\n\nI agree with your sentiment entirely - but wasn't 'Man on the Corner' on 'Abacab' = I think Collins wrote it but it wasn't a solo track.\n\nOn Duke, the song sounds like a Genesis song. On Face Value, it sounds like a Phil Collins song, that is it fits stylistically with the style he was adopting as a solo performer. More funk, more bounce.\n\nTherefore, I prefer the Genesis version.\n\nTrue that was on Abacab, but a Collins' solo write. The point being that in that brief period before the dreaded Against all Odds/Easy Lover year, Phil was writing some very dark music.\n\nPhil just had to get horns in on everything! TBH, the only band I liked horns in was early Chicago because the way they were written was harmonically interesting.\n\ndreaded? I loved those songs.\n\nLOL, I practically grew up listening to those songs as 'aural wallpaper' in supermarkets, dentist offices, malls. Little did I know about 'dark Phil'. The only song from that category that was played with regularity on AM radio was In the Air Tonight."
