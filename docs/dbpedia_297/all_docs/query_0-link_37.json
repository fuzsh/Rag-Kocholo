        "text": "Following Final Resolution, Samoa Joe out with several injuries after a brutal attack by the Main Event Mafia, and their leader, Sting, is still in possession of the TNA World Heavyweight Champion. However, Joe’s friends in the TNA Frontline are still on a mission to put an end to the Mafia’s hold on TNA, and there appears to be some dissent emerging in the mob as well.\n\nBuild to Genesis\n\nFollowing Final Resolution, Sting and the Mafia come out to the ring to gloat about his win over Mick Foley and despite the hardcore legend’s best efforts, he is still the TNA World Champion. The rest of the members of the Mafia take issue with some of what he is saying, and Booker T takes the microphone, saying that they lost their titles back to the Frontline, and that this whole partnership is seeming to feel one sided, as Sting didn’t help any of them with their matches. Angle comments that it's because of his that Sting’s greatest threat, Samoa Joe is out of action. Tensions begin to flare, and Angle says that maybe going forward, he should call the shots, but Sting says that as long as he is Champion, he’s the leader of the Mob, but Angle is welcome to try and take it from him if he wants. The Frontline comes out and AJ says that if Sting is giving out title shots, he and Foley each want another one, and the segment breaks out into a brawl between the 10 men.\n\nFollowing this, the main event of Genesis is announced as a 4 Way Match for the TNA World Championship, with Sting defending his title against Angle, AJ Styles and Mick Foley. No update is given on Samoa Joe, except that no one has heard from him. In the lead up to the PPV, Sting and Angle’s tension with each other grows, but both of them seem to agree that the most important thing is that the TNA World Championship remains in the Main Event Mafia’s control. AJ defends his Legends Championship against Booker T, and he loses the match due to interference from Sting, and Angle defeats Mick Foley in a singles match in the go home show.\n\nTNA Genesis 2009\n\nSting defends the TNA World Championship against Kurt Angle, AJ Styles and Mick Foley in a 4-Way match. Sting and Angle team up against Styles and Foley to start the match, however, their partnership deteriorates as the match progresses, as Sting has a chance to pin Foley, but Kurt breaks it up, and the two Main Event Mafia members get into a fight. AJ comes flying in off the turnbuckle and takes them both out with a cross body. Styles goes after Sting, who costed him his Legends title a few weeks earlier, but Angle makes the save, and the two double team AJ. They lock Styles in a double submission, when suddenly, Samoa Joe’s music hits and the runs down to the ring wielding a steel chair. Joe goes after Sting and Angle, and smacks Kurt over the head with the chair before clotheslining him out of the ring. Joe turns around and gets into a brawl with Sting, and the Icon gets the upper hand, however, AJ hits him with a low blow and takes Sting down. AJ climbs up onto the turnbuckle and hits a 450 splash on him while Joe dives to the outside to keep Angle from breaking up the pin and 1-2-3. AJ STYLES WINS THE TNA WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP.\n\nJoe embraces AJ in the ring, along with Mick Foley, and the two hold up AJ’s hands in victory. AJ’s wife Wendy climbs into the ring and kisses her husband, and the two celebrate his win together. Foley goes to put the belt around Styles’ waist, when out of nowhere, Joe hits Mick in the back with the steel chair. AJ turns around and Joe breaks the chair over his head, and Styles falls to the mat. Wendy kneels down next to AJ to check on him, and turns around to beg Joe not to hurt him. Joe threatens her with the chair, but throws it away, before picking up the TNA World Championship and heading backstage with it.\n\nTNA Impact 1/15/09\n\nFollowing Genesis, Samoa Joe comes down to the ring, still in possession of the physical TNA World Championship belt. Joe cuts a promo explaining where he has been the past month and why he attacked AJ. Joe says that after the Main Event Mafia took him out, he had a lot of time for self reflection, and remembered that the TNA World Championship is the reason he is in the wrestling business, and he had gotten so caught up in his vendetta of the Mafia, that he lost sight of it. He knew that under his old contractual agreement, he couldn’t challenge for the title again as long as Sting was champion, and when he finally had his chance, he did what he had to do to get the belt off Sting. Joe said he liked AJ. He thought he was talented and a hard worker, but he isn’t on Joe’s level and claims that deep down, AJ knows that he wouldn’t have won the title if it weren’t for Joe. He then says that everyone knows that Joe is the rightful Champion and possession is 9/10ths of the law, but says that if AJ Styles or anyone else takes issue with that, they are welcome to come out and take the belt from him.\n\nSting and Kurt Angle come out and say that Joe had no right to interfere with their match, and if it weren’t for him, the Main Event Mafia would still be in possession of the World Title. Sting tells Joe that Sting pinned him clean months ago and will have no problem doing it again tonight to take it back. AJ Styles then comes down to the entrance ramp, along with Roode and Storm from Frontline, and says that despite what Samoa Joe says, he is the Champion. He won the championship after he pinned Sting 1-2-3. But AJ says that he has bigger issues with Samoa Joe than just stealing his belt. AJ says that Joe threatened his wife and made her cry. He thought of Joe as a brother at one point, but now, he just plans on beating the hell out of him. AJ pulls a crow bar out of his jacket and heads down to the ring with it. Storm and Roode go after Sting and Kurt, and AJ goes after Joe with the crow bar. AJ swings with it and misses, and Joe nails AJ with a suplex from behind. Styles flips over and lands on his feet, and takes down Joe with a drop kick. Samoa Joe rolls out of the ring but grabs the TNA Championship belt with him, and AJ throws the crowbar at him as Joe retreats into the crowd.\n\nTNA Impact 1/22/09\n\nAnother 4 Way title match is announced for the next PPV, Against All Odds, with AJ Styles defending his newly won title against Samoa Joe, Kurt Angle and Sting. In the lead up, Joe, who is still in possession of the TNA Championship, begins refusing to show up to Impact or wrestle on TV until he is recognized as the World Champion. TNA Owner Dixie Carter refuses to do so, so Joe says that he’ll be relaxing at home until AAO.\n\nSting and Kurt Angle’s tension in the Main Event Mafia continues to worsen, however, the two put aside their differences and manage to pick up a tag team victory over Beer Money Inc.\n\nTNA Impact 1/29/09\n\nAJ Styles teams up with Mick Foley to take on the Motor City Machine Guns in a tag team match. They have a fun match full of high spots, but the Frontline members pick up the win after AJ hits the Styles Clash on Chris Sabin. After the match, Samoa Joe runs out from the crowd and attacks AJ with a steel chair. Joe takes out Foley with the chair before locking Styles in the Coquina Clutch until he passes out. After his attack, Joe grabs a microphone and tells AJ to say hi to Wendy for him.\n\nTNA Impact 2/5/09\n\nIn the go home show before Against All Odds, Kurt Angles faces off against Mick Foley in the main event. Kurt forces Mick to tap out to the Ankle Lock, but following the match, Joe runs out from the crowd and attacks Angle with a chair. Joe keeps beating down Kurt, until Sting’s music hits and the Icon runs out to save his stable mate and attack one of his opponents on Sunday. Sting hits Joe with a Scorpion Deathdrop, however, he stands up and turns into a drop kick from AJ from the top turnbuckle. AJ finally gets face to face with Samoa Joe and jumps on top of him to start nailing punches on his former friend. Joe rolls out of the ring and AJ stands tall heading into Against All Odds.\n\nTNA Against All Odds\n\nAJ Styles defends the TNA World Championship against Samoa Joe, Sting and Kurt Angle in a 4-Way match, however, Joe comes out to the ring, still in possession of the physical belt. The match gets underway and AJ goes right after Joe, showing much more aggression than normal. Angle and Sting take advantage and clothesline the two men to the outside of the ring. They get out after them and Sting goes after Joe, while Angle takes on Styles. Sting throws Joe up against the ring barricade and starts nailing him with punches, but Joe shoves him off of him and slams Sting down onto the ring steps. Joe then picks Sting up and throws him into the ring to try and pin him, but the Icon kicks out at 2. Joe keeps laying punches into Sting until Kurt runs in to make the save. Angle starts hitting Joe with Suplexes before bridging one into a pinning attempt, but AJ jumps in to break it up. AJ hits Angle with a hurricanrana and sends him to the outside of the ring before turning his attention back to Joe. AJ hits him with a forearm to the head before locking him in a Calf Killer submission. AJ tries to tear his calf and force him to submit, but Sting breaks it up and then goes after AJ while Joe rolls away to recover.\n\nAngle climbs back into the ring and he and Sting double team AJ, hitting him with an Olympic Slam, followed by a Scorpion Deathdrop. Sting covers AJ, but Kurt pulls him off and goes for the cover himself. The two stand up and get into an argument, and the two get into a punching match before Joe runs over and takes them both out with a double clothesline. Joe hits Angle with a Suplex and he rolls out of the ring, allowing him to turn his attention to Sting. Joe suplexes Sting before locking him in the Coquina Clutch, nearly putting the Icon to sleep, but AJ comes flying in and nails Joe with a Phenomenal Forearm to break the submission. AJ and Joe stand up and start trading punches, until AJ hits Joe with a Pele kick, sending him out of the ring. Angle runs up behind AJ and locks him in an Ankle Lock, but AJ twists around and sends Angle flying into the ropes. AJ pulls Kurt up and hits a Styles Clash on him. He goes for the cover to retain his title and 1-2- Joe pulls AJ out of the ring throws him over the barricade and into the crowd. Joe climbs into the ring and hits Kurt with a running knee. Joe covers him and 1-2-3. Samoa Joe has officially reclaimed the TNA World Championship. Joe calls for a microphone in the ring and cuts a promo, saying ”I told all you people. I am the rightful Champion. I am the only champion and there is nobody on this planet that can beat me. Not Angle. Not Sting. Not AJ. And essentially not that bitch ass punk from Massacusetts John Cena.” Joe drops the mic and poses in the ring with his title.\n\nBuild to Destination X\n\nFollowing Joe’s victory at Against All Odds, he is once again officially, the TNA World Champion. Joe says that he never should have lost this title in the first place, but now that it is once again in his possession and he is officially recognized as the World Champion, he doesn’t plan on ever losing it again. However, both Sting and AJ Styles demand a one on one rematch for the title, as neither one of them had their reign end in one on one match. AJ says that Joe blindsided AJ, stole his championship, and Styles thinks he did that because Joe knows that one on one, AJ has always been better than him. However, Sting says that the last time he faced Joe one on one, he beat him to win that Championship, and is dead set on doing it again.\n\nDixie Carter places Sting and AJ in a singles match to determine the next contender for the championship, which is won by Sting, and he is granted a title shot against Joe at Destination X, however, as per Joe’s request, it will be a No DQ match, so Joe can do “whatever the hell he wants to Sting”. Sting is still backed by the Main Event Mafia, however, Joe has distanced himself from the Frontline since his return, claiming that they were just a means to an end for him, and that end was the TNA World Championship. In the build, Joe wins singles matches against both Booker T and Scott Steiner, and warns Sting that he has been dreaming of getting Sting alone in the ring with him since Bound For Glory, and he’s going to enjoy punishing him. In the build, tensions continue to mount in the Main Event Mafia, and Sting and Kurt argue over who should be the leader, and which one of them really deserves to get the title matches.\n\nDestination X\n\nIn the Main Event, the TNA World Champion Samoa Joe defends his championship against Sting, in a rematch from Bound for Glory 6 months earlier, however, this time in a No DQ match. The two have a brutal encounter right from the start, as Joe quickly gets an advantage over Sting and takes him down with a clothesline. Joe rips a turnbuckle pad off the buckle, and starts smashing Sting by the head into the exposed Steel. Sting is quickly busted open and he rolls to the outside of the ring. Joe follows him out and keeps kicking him in the back. However, Sting grabs his baseball bat from under the ring and smacks Joe in the gut with it. Sting throws Joe into the ring steps before wrapping the bat around his neck and choking him with it. Joe falls to the ground and Sting sets up a table outside the ring. He goes to grab Joe to slam him through the table, but Joe reverses Sting at the last moment and powerslams him into the table instead.\n\nBoth men slowly get to their feet and Joe grabs Sting by the hair and throws him into the ring. Joe goes back under the ring and throws several chairs into the ring and then pulls out a barbed wires baseball bat. Joe climbs into the ring and smacks the bat onto Sting’s back. Joe hits him with it several times before picking Sting up and trying to powerslam him onto the pile of chairs. However, Sting fights out of the move, kicks Joe in the gut and DDTs him onto the chairs. Sting covers him, but Joe kicks out at 2.

A king of the mountain match is held on Impact, with the prize for winning being a briefcase containing a title match for the World Title at Lockdown next month. The former Champion AJ Styles, Bobby Roode, Christopher Daniels, Bully Ray, Jeff Jarrett and Abyss all compete in the match for the title shot against Joe, and Styles emerges as the victor. The match is set for Lockdown and will be held in a 6 Sides of Steel match\n\nIn the build to their match, AJ calls out Joe, saying that he always felt a kinship with him as they worked their way up the business together and he is very hurt by how he betrayed him. AJ calls himself a TNA original, and when he and Joe formed the Frontline, it was because they didn’t want the Main Event Mafia to take over the company they helped build up. AJ took the title away from Sting, it was a special moment for him, as his months of work paid off, and for the first time in his career, he held the TNA World Title..and then Joe ripped it from him. AJ claims that Joe turned his back on his friend, he attacked him, stole his title and threatened his wife. AJ stays that this match is going to be as personal as it gets for him, and he tells Joe that he’s glad it’ll be inside a Steel Cage, so now there will be nowhere for him to hide.\n\nJoe says that AJ is a great talent. He is the most athletically gifted Wrestler in TNA, but Joe is something different. There is no man more aggressive than him and no one more dangerous. Joe says that everything he does is for HIS championship. The Frontline. His war with the Main Event Mafia. In the end, it was all about taking back his title. Joe says that while AJ is the better athlete, he is the more intelligent, the more aggressive and is willing to do all the things AJ won’t. He says that AJ’s Christian Morals and his conscience are what will be his downfall. He can talk the talk and do all the flips he wants, but at the end of the day, he can’t tap into the darkness and aggression like Joe says he can. In the go home show before the pay per view, AJ defeats Jay Lethal in a singles match, and Joe goes to attack him after the match. AJ quickly gets away and grabs a planted crowbar he hid under the ring. AJ smacks Joe in the chest with it and the TNA Champion retreats. Styles gestures at him with the crowbar and says that he’s smarter than Joe thinks he is, and that’s gonna be the difference on Sunday.\n\nTNA Lockdown 2009\n\nThe TNA World Champion Samoa Joe defends his title against AJ Styles in 6 Sides of Steel match to main event the show.
