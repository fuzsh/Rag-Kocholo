        "text": "Charlie GSenior Writer I\n\nTNA: Against All Odds Card and Predictions\n\n0 of 9\n\nTNA presents Against All Odds LIVE this Sunday, Feb, 13. Against All Odds will be held in, none other than, The iMPACT! Zone from Universal Studios, Orlando, Florida.\n\nThere are eight matches announced for Against All Odds.\n\nThere's going to be a Knockout title match, as well as a World title match.\n\nMost of the matches are rematches from Genesis, so I plan on sitting this pay-per-view out.\n\nAnyway, here is the card and my predictions.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRob Terry, Gunner and Murphy vs. Scott Steiner and Beer Money Inc.\n\n1 of 9\n\nThis match was added last second and is pretty much a filler.\n\nI don't understand why TNA doesn't make it Beer Money vs. Gunner & Murphy for the Tag Team Titles. Gunner & Murphy should become an official tag team in TNA. They are experienced in the ring and have good chemistry together.\n\nWhy is Rob Terry and Scott Steiner in this match? Okay; Terry is part of Immortal and Steiner helped Fortune. Still, why are they there? TNA could have made this into two matches.\n\nScott Steiner vs. Rob Terry then have Beer Money vs. Gunner & Murphy. Oh, well.\n\nSince this is the in-ring return of \"Big Poppa Pump\" Scott Steiner and an awkward pairing of Rob Terry, Gunner & Murphy, I see Beer Money and Scott Steiner winning this.\n\nWinner: Beer Money and Scott Steiner\n\nMax Buck vs. Jeremy Buck vs Robbie E.\n\n2 of 9\n\nA No. 1 contender triple threat match. All three guys are heel but that's what makes things interesting.\n\nMax and Jeremy, Generation Me, said that they will double team the third man in the match (That being Robbie E.) and after he's taken out; let the best man win.\n\nI believe the Bucks will deliver. They'll double team Robbie majority of the match then fight each other. They will go back and forth. Wrestling an X-Division style match.\n\nOne Buck will knockout the other and then Cookie will distract the referee, allowing Robbie E. to cheat his way to Kazarian's X-Division title.\n\nYou can't forget Cookie in this match. She could be a real game changer for Robbie. I expect Robbie E. to fist pump his way to victory.\n\nWinner: Robbie E.\n\nKnockout Title Match: Mickie James vs. Madison Rayne\n\n3 of 9\n\nThis is one of those rematches from Genesis but with a little stipulation.\n\nIt's a Last Knockout Standing Match! This should be good. When was the last time you saw a Last Woman Standing Match?\n\nMadison Rayne has an obvious advantage in this match. Well, two actually. Madison can use her loaded glove that we have seen in recent weeks, or Madison can get help from Tara.\n\nMickie James brings the experience into this match. If Mickie James were to capture the Knockout Title at Against All Odds, that will make her the only woman ever to have held the WWE Women's Title, WWE Divas Title and Knockout Title.\n\nI think she'll set that record and win the Knockout Title. But she won't set that record come this Sunday.\n\nMadison Rayne will win with help of Tara or her loaded glove. Retaining the Knockout Title.\n\nWinner: Madison Rayne\n\nBully Ray vs. Brother Devon\n\n4 of 9\n\nBully Ray vs. Brother Devon, round two.\n\nAnother rematch from Genesis but with a little change. It's a street fight! Anything goes. No count out, no disqualification, no running and no hiding.\n\nI expect this match to have some blood in it at some point. I also expect a Team 3D classic: Tables.\n\nBlood, tables and no mercy is what'll happen when these two clash in the ring again.\n\nBully Ray is against all odds in this match (pun intended). He is up against three people in a street fight. Devon and his two sons.\n\nI don't expect Devon's sons to do much during the match. Maybe punch or kick Bully Ray while he's down. Besides that, I think they'll just get in the way of this match. Three on one is tough odds to beat, so I see Devon and his son's celebrating in the ring together again.\n\nHopefully this will end the feud between these two and they can both ride off into the sunset.\n\nWinner: Brother Devon w/ his two sons\n\n\"The Pope\" D'Angelo Dinero vs. Samoa Joe\n\n5 of 9\n\nI can not wait for this match! The only thing that would make this better would be if it was in a steel cage!\n\nThe Pope has been making fun of Joe in the past because Joe exposed Pope to be a fraud. Joe has been trying week in and week out to get his hands on Pope. Now he finally has him.\n\nI think this match has the making to be really good. Two top guys in TNA.\n\nI'm on the fence on who I want to win. I want both of them to succeed, but who first?\n\nThe Pope might try to run away from Joe again, but Joe has Okada in his corner (Okada, the Green Hornet guy. Helped Joe follow Pope around).\n\nAs much as I want Joe to win, I feel like he won't.\n\nThe Pope will get the win over Joe. Not a clean win, but a win. Pope will likely cheat for the victory. Use of weapon, low blow, thumb to the eye, anything.\n\nI think this match will set up another one in the future. At Destination X most likely.\n\nPope vs. Joe will be continued after this Sunday!\n\nWinner: \"The Pope\" D'Angelo Dinero\n\nMatt Hardy vs. RVD\n\n6 of 9\n\nThis is yet another rematch from Genesis. Matt Hardy vs. Rob Van Dam.\n\nBischoff keeps blocking RVD's path to Jeff Hardy and/or the TNA World Title. First it was the whole EV2/RVD dilemma, now Matt Hardy is holding Van Dam up.\n\nRVD should go into this match and completely own Matt Hardy. Sorry Matt Hardy fans but it's true. RVD should destroy Matt this Sunday.\n\nWhy? One: RVD is in shape. Two: RVD is World Championship material. Finally Three: It's time to add RVD back to the main event scene.\n\nRVD is going to kick Matt in the face a couple of times then go for a Five-Star Frogsplash.\n\n1-2-3. Done.\n\nWinner: Rob Van Dam\n\nJeff Jarrett vs. Kurt Angle\n\n7 of 9\n\nThese two put on good matches in the past but can they do it again in 2011?\n\nThis is another Genesis rematch but with a twist.\n\nNo more MMA Challenges for old Double J. It's just a one-on-one grudge match here.\n\nA stipulation that Jeff Jarrett added to the match is if Kurt wins he gets custody of the Angle's kids. If Jeff wins, Kurt has to walk Karen Jarrett down the aisle on Mar. 3 when The Jarretts renew their wedding vows.\n\nThis will be a close match from bell-to-bell. But I see Double J getting the better of Kurt. Jarrett will most likely cheat to win to keep this storyline going.\n\nSo expect to see Kurt Angle walk Karen Jarrett down the aisle Mar. 3. Also expect Kurt to avenge his loss on Mar. 3.\n\nWinner: Jeff Jarrett\n\nTNA World Title Ladder Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Mr. Anderson\n\n8 of 9\n\nTNA World Title Ladder Match. Jeff Hardy vs. Ken Anderson.\n\nAnderson might retain since Hardy's court date is a couple days after Against All Odds. After that, who knows.\n\nThis match can end at least three ways:\n\n1.) They beat the hell out of each other and Anderson pulls the belt down.\n\n2.) They beat the hell out of each other and Jeff Hardy pulls the belt down.\n\n3.) Immortal attacks and shortly after Fortune. All hell would break loose and I don't know what'll happen next.\n\nI imagine Immortal attacking and will cost Anderson the match and the World Title. Making a controversial ending.\n\nExpect the ending of this match to be \"controversial\" and expect to see Immortal and/or Fortune. This match will have a controversial ending to further push the Fortune vs. Immortal storyline. Jeff Hardy winning the title will also open an AJ Styles vs. Jeff Hardy World Title feud.\n\nWinner: Jeff Hardy.\n\nBleacher Report\n\n9 of 9\n\nX"
