        "text": "Noah’s Flood: a Historical, Global Catastrophe\n\nExamining the immense biblical data for Noah’s flood as an actual, year-long, worldwide, and catastrophic flood about 4,500 years ago.\n\nWas Noah’s Flood Global?\n\nDid Noah experience a local flood which left only a few sediment layers, as floods do today? God’s record is clear: the water covered the entire globe and killed all the animals on earth. Such unique conditions are the only way to explain worldwide fossil-bearing layers thousands of feet deep.\n\nLocal Floods Help Us Understand Noah’s Flood Geology\n\nGeologists repeatedly discover the catastrophic effects of local flooding on the earth’s surface, resulting in the same conclusion each time: that substantial amounts of water can have the same geological effect in a short period of time (even laying down rock layers) that hypothesized millions of years of slow water flow would have.\n\nNoah Did More than Build an Ark\n\nLike people today, almost certainly the people of Noah’s day were busy enjoying the pleasures of life and did not believe or care that judgment was coming. In 2 Peter 2:5, Noah is described as a “preacher of righteousness.”\n\nPsalm 104 and the Flood"
