        "text": "Romans 4:18-25 | Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead. Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.” The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.\n\nEven when there was no reason for hope, Abraham kept hoping—believing that he would become the father of many nations. – Romans 4:18 (NLT)\n\nAfter nearly five years of study and against the odds—limited finances, being a woman of color in a historically male-oriented, Western academy—I finished my doctorate, at the age of sixty! I was following in the footsteps of my grandfather, who also overcame obstacles to success. Despite having only an eighth-grade education, he believed he could start the first black-owned cab company in his city.\n\nAbraham believed God when all the odds—his age, Sarah’s age, and long years of waiting on God—suggested it was impossible that he could become a father (Genesis 21:1–5). Moreover, Abraham became the father of generations who live by faith, those who hope against the odds (Romans 4:18). Abraham’s story serves as one of many examples of a simple truth that can encourage us all: God does the impossible.\n\nWhether we’re recent graduates, in college, or working toward success in our career, there are odds stacked against us. Racial injustice, economic disruption, pandemics. When you’re saddled with school debt, entering a depressed job market with few entry-level opportunities, it would be natural to lose hope. Why hope against hope when there’s no evidence to support you? Abraham’s hope was not in his circumstances but in a living God who had spoken to him despite circumstances that seemed to defy that very word. A hope that defies the evidence and clings to God’s promises can achieve the impossible!—Melanie Johnson\n\nWhat hope does Scripture offer you despite your circumstances? Which “impossibilities” could you realize by hoping against all the odds?\n\nHelp me to remember that You are the God of the impossible. I’m grateful that there are no obstacles too big for You to overcome."
