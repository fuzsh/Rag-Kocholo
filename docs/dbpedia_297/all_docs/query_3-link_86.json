        "text": "Just two years ago at the Phoenix Open, Scottie Scheffler won his first PGA Tour title. He’s been dominating golf on the PGA Tour since, ranking No. 1 in the world golf rankings for 73 weeks including 39 consecutive weeks between May 22, 2023 and February 12, 2024. This week golf’s biggest star for more than two decades, Tiger Woods, returns to action as the host of the 2024 Genesis Invitational at famed Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palasades, CA. The PGA Tour Signature Event has a prize pool of $20 million and the winner gets the trophy and $4 million.\n\nDespite some of the PGA Tour’s biggest stars leaving for LIV Golf, including the final group pairing of Jon Rahm, Bryson DeChambeau and Dustin Johnson (winner) in last week’s LIV Golf Las Vegas event, we’re seeing that golf at the highest professional level is still most competitive. So many talented players, but this week’s invitational field is limited to 71 including 41 of the top 50 in the world rankings.\n\nStill, all six winners on the PGA Tour this year have won at odds of 70/1 or greater. In fact, Nick Taylor’s win last week (180/1) is the fifth winner this year with odds of 180/1 (+18000) or greater.\n\nWyndham Clark was the 70/1 winner at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, his third PGA Tour victory. But recall Clark was a relative unknown moving up the ranks until winning last year’s U.S. Open. He’s now ranked No. 6 in the world.\n\nThis week, nine of the top 10 players in the Official World Golf Rankings will tee it up at Riviera. That does not include No. 3 Jon Rahm, who is now playing on the LIV Golf Tour and won’t be able to defend his title at The Genesis Invitational Rahm (-17) won by two shots last year ahead of Max Homa (-15), Patrick Cantlay (-14), Will Zalatoris (-13), Keith Mitchell (-12), Collin Morikawa (-11) and Sahith Theegala (-11). Scottie Scheffler finished T12 and Tiger Woods finished T45 at -1 under par.\n\nThis year’s tournament will see 50 players plus ties make the cut and play the weekend at Riviera.\n\nGolf Odds To Win The Genesis Invitational\n\nLeading favorites and contenders golf odds from FanDuel Sportsbook refresh periodically and are subject to change, including on props and live betting.\n\n+650: Scottie Scheffler\n\n+1000: Rory McIlroy\n\n+1400: Viktor Hovland\n\n+1600: Justin Thomas, Xander Schauffele\n\n+1800: Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay\n\n+2000: Max Homa\n\n+2200: Sam Burns, Ludvig Aberg\n\n+2800: Jordan Spieth\n\n+3000: Adam Scott\n\n+3500: Cameron Young, Tommy Fleetwood, Tony Finau\n\n+4000: Sahith Theegala, Matt Fitzpatrick, Wyndham Clark\n\n+5500: Nicolai Højgaard, Si Woo Kim, Jason Day\n\n+5500: J.T. Poston, Tom Kim\n\n+6000: Byeong Hun An, Keegan Bradley, Will Zalatoris\n\n+7000: Eric Cole\n\n+7500: Sungjae Im, Russell Henley, Kurt Kitayama, Cam Davis\n\n+9000: Hideki Matsuyama, Beau Hossler\n\n+15000: Tiger Woods (150/1)\n\n72-hole winning score: Over/Under 268.5\n\nRiviera CC is a par 71 traditional tree-lined course that plays to 7,322 yards. It rewards shot makers and players with well-rounded skill sets from tee-to-green that handle the narrow fairways and tight doglegs, unpredictable Kikuyu fairways and rough, and trickier, firm and fast Poa greens, which average 7,500 sq. ft. (T4 largest on tour).\n\nHow To Watch The Genesis Invitational Pro-Am\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nThursday-Friday: 4-8 p.m. (Golf Channel)\n\nSaturday: 1-3 p.m. (Golf Channel), 3-7 p.m. (CBS)\n\nSunday: 1-3 p.m. (Golf Channel), 3-6:30 p.m. (CBS)\n\nPGA Tour Live on ESPN along with Peacock provide streaming live coverage. Paramount+ will stream CBS’s broadcasts online.\n\nRadio on SiriusXM (92) and free at PGATOUR.com/liveaudio.\n\nThursday (ESPN+, all times Eastern)\n\n12:01 pm - Nick Taylor, Viktor Hovland, Sam Burns (Marquee)\n\n12:13 pm - Tom Kim, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Cantlay (Marquee)\n\n12:25 pm - Tiger Woods, Justin Thomas, Gary Woodland (Main Feed)\n\n12:37 pm - Ludvig Åberg, Nick Hardy, Christiaan Bezuidenhout\n\n1:25 pm - Jason Day, Tony Finau, Brendon Todd\n\nFriday\n\n10:56 am - Jason Day, Tony Finau, Brendon Todd\n\n12:01 pm - Sahith Theegala, Xander Schauffele, Tommy Fleetwood\n\n12:13 pm - Collin Morikawa, Matt Fitzpatrick, Scottie Scheffler (Marquee)\n\n12:25 pm - Rory McIlroy, Wyndham Clark, Max Homa (Marquee)\n\n2:54 pm - Tiger Woods, Justin Thomas, Gary Woodland (Main Feed)\n\nA look at the golf stats past performance charts at Riviera and the Genesis Invitational shows that two years ago Cameron Young (-17) tied for 2nd in his tournament debut and shot a 62 on Friday. He finished T20, and is a sleeper to consider. Little mention of Viktor Hovland this week, and he finished T4 in the 2022 event for his second straight top-5 finish before finishing T20 last year. Collin Morikawa finished T2 in 2022 and T6 last year. Rory McIlroy finished T4 in 2019, T5 in 2022, T10 in 2022 and fell to T29 last year. Scottie Scheffler‘s best two finishes in five starts at Riviera are T7 in 2022 and T12 last year. Justin Thomas finished 2nd in 2019, 6th in 2022 and T20 last year.\n\nXander Schauffele has four top-15 finishes in six starts and his worst was last year, T33. We bet against Max Homa in last week’s Phoenix Open and won the tournament matchup on Jordan Spieth when Homa he missed the cut. He’s not too sharp, but Max has excelled at Riviera, where he won in 2021 when play was suspended with severe winds, and he also finished 2nd last year, T5 in 2022 and T10 in 2022. FanDuel Ambassador Jordan Spieth has 10 starts at Riviera with a best of T4 in 2015 and no top 10’s his last five starts in The Genesis. Californian Patrick Cantlay finished 3rd last year and has two other top-15 finishes plus T4 in 2018. Sam Burns is a popular pick this week playing strong golf with three straight top-10 finishes his last three events. But Burns has missed the cut in 3-of-5 starts at Riviera with a best finish of 3rd in 2021.\n\nThe last two winners of The Genesis Invitational, Jon Rahm and Joaquin Niemann, both led the field that week in strokes gained, Approach. Both those golfers are now playing on the LIV Golf Tour.\n\nLeading favorites and contenders this week who rank highly (top 15 in field) in SG: Approach over their last 24 rounds include: Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, Eric Cole, Tony Finau, Ludvig Aberg, Sahith Theegala, Patrick Cantlay, Justin Thomas and Rory McIlroy. Also, Schauffele and Theegala are the only two players from that group who also rank top-15 in SG: Putting on Poa annua over their last 24 rounds.\n\nPopular Types Of Golf Betting Odds\n\nTypes of bets and how to read the odds\n\nWinner: Bet on who will win this week’s PGA tour event.\n\nFinishing Position Odds: Bet on a golfer to finish in the top 5, top 10, top 20 or top 40 in this week’s golf tournament.\n\nRound Leader Betting: Golf odds on who will win the first round, second round, third round, and fourth round separately.\n\nGolf Matchup Betting: Prop bets on which golfer will finish better in the tournament head to head between the two golfers listed for each matchup.\n\nLive Betting: Bets placed during a sporting event as odds change.\n\nGolf Picks And Key Stats\n\nFanDuel golf picks, stats and win simulations target these players for win bets and top-10 or top-20 finishing position. Click the golf picks link for more insight, analysis and information you can bet on.\n\nCollin Morikawa\n\nAdam Scott\n\nJ.T. Poston\n\nByeong Hun An\n\nCheck out more picks and props including other popular players being bet to win The Genesis Invitational at the leading online sportsbooks - Justin Thomas, Patrick Cantlay and longshot Cam Davis.\n\nGolf Digest betting contributors also support: Sam Burns (3), Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas, Ludvig Aberg and Xander Schauffele. Dark horses and longshots include: Jason Day, Taylor Moore, J.T. Poston, Tom Hoge, Denny McCarthy, Keegan Bradley and Will Zalatoris.\n\nTournament Matchups\n\nBeyond the more difficult to predict outright win betting, weekly golf events provide tournament and daily matchups, top finishing position, hole scores and specials, 2 and 3-ball player odds and other information you can bet on.\n\nThat includes Tiger Woods specials. Woods made five birdies in the opening round last year at The Genesis Invitational, and FanDuel is offering Woods to make 4+ birdies (or better) in Round 1 at +100, even odds.\n\nThis week’s tournament matchup to target is Collin Morikawa (-110) over Xander Schauffele at FanDuel Sportsbook. Also, at Circa Sports, where I watched Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas and posted 5-of-6 player prop winners, take a swing on Morikawa (+180) at big odds against Scottie Scheffler. If you prefer a favorite, fire away on Justin Thomas (-128) over Max Homa.\n\nBetting chaos followed Round 3 at Pebble Beach when Round 4 cancelled and another longshot Wyndham Clark (70/1) prevailed with a tournament record score 60 on Saturday and a 54-hole victory. Then last week, fans at the Phoenix Open caused more chaos with erratic behavior that was more like Animal House than the “Peoples Open.” Canadian Nick Taylor, 35, birdied three of the final four holes Sunday to force a playoff, and then prevailed over fellow longshot Charley Hoffman, 47, on the second playoff hole.\n\nPerhaps that will inspire Tiger Woods, 48, to go well at Riviera, where surprisingly he has never won during his spectacular career.\n\nCheck out more golf stats and coverage of The Genesis Invitational and weekly PGA Tour events as betting on golf continues to be most popular with fans firing for more fairways and greens when wagering.\n\nYou can bet on it.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesGolf Betting Rules: Wyndham Clark Shoots 60 And Leads, But Final Round Rainout Likely At Pebble BeachForbesLIV Golf Las Vegas Final Round Pairing And Odds Features Major Winners DJ, DeChambeau And RahmForbesSuper Bowl LVIII Popular Prop Bets And Results In Chiefs 25-22 OT Win Over 49ersForbesWM Phoenix Open Promises To Change After Chaotic 2024 TournamentForbesPhoenix Open 2024 Golf Odds, Picks And Props"
