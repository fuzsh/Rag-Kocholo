German target printing of it. ive been through the record. ive been through the cassette. ive been through the columbia-house mail-order only 8-track, ive even been through the vhs (although not the dvd) and ive even been through US cds.....\n\nBUT IT COULD'VE BEEN EVEN MORE PERFECT THAN IT ALREADY IS:\n\n#1: side B vinyl or the \"2nd half\" of the cd, should of been TONY BANKS SOUNDTRACK. then it would of been the grand pinacle of 80s solo genesis- a side b of tony instrumentals would of sealed it--- now dont get me wrong i LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE larry carlton....but tony all the way on this\n\npoint 2: i love the stevie nicks song\n\npoint 3: see point 1 again\n\npoint 4: whenever the mike rutherford is fading out, then all of a sudden i need to LEAP to the cd player before that weird song comes on after it: you all know the one im talking about. oh mygod the intros SO annoying: i dont know what it is. im a huge fan of 80s caucasian drum-machine/EVI wind synth driven calypso/regage, but this song kills me\n\n---whats the verdict on the BIG COUNTRY song? am i supposed to like this one? im leaning more twds that i think....of course i would of perfered one GENESIS/PETER GABRIEL COLLABORATION TRACK which brings up my last point. in fact why didnt they let steve hackett do one too instead of that kid creaole oh god it could of been great: the cd tracklist should of been\n\n1. Against All Odds (phil)\n\n2. Stevie Nicks (stevie)\n\n3. Mike Rutherford (a GREAT track...i love this track. i love it i love it i love it. i wish mike had more songs a la: this-- mecanics doesnt come close//))\n\n4. 80s Steve Hackett song\n\n5. Peter Gabriel solo song\n\n6. GENESIS COLLABORATION SONG\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSIDE B: ALL TONY\n\nYeah. The song Against All Odds is too perfect for this movie, and the video is killer, too. Perfect, absolutely perfect for the 80s. Damn, I'm glad I was there. One of my all time favorite movies with Jeff Bridges, along with 8 Million Ways to Die and Tron. One of my favorite movies, period. James Woods is so great in it, too. Playing such a bad guy, but he did an amazing job."
