        "text": "There are certain rock bands that no one admits they like — even though the acts sell countless millions of records and pack stadiums around the world.\n\nGenesis is the prototype. It's never been \"cool\" to enjoy the band's music the same way it's a sign of sophistication to worship Pink Floyd. It's never been a status symbol to stalk the group around the planet as some people follow The Grateful Dead. But Genesis outsold those acts and many others for decades.\n\nConsider the following: Over the last 40 years, Genesis served up everything from ballads like \"Follow You, Follow Me\" and \"No Son of Mine\" to pop hits like \"That's All\" and \"I Can't Dance.\" Subject matter ranged from themes of sci-fi and horror to simple romance on the rocks.\n\nThe band recorded successful concept albums like The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and smashes like Invisible Touch, and spawned the hugely successful solo careers of Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins, while seamlessly reuniting in various forms to produce new material. But Genesis is not in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. Blondie? Yes. Jackson Browne? Sure. Genesis? No love. In fact, few rock bands have been more successful for as long a time in as many genres as Genesis while garnering such little critical respect.\n\nNow, Rhino Records is releasing an 11-disc set (eight CDs, three DVDs) of the group's live performances called Genesis Live 1973-2007 , hitting stores Tuesday, that captures the band's sound throughout its many incarnations.\n\nRhino already collected, remastered and re-presented Genesis' catalogue of studio recordings in a series of three box sets covering the three eras of the band's music. The 1970-1975 set offered the original prog/art rock lineup of Gabriel (lead singer), Tony Banks (keyboards), Mike Rutherford (bass), Steve Hackett (lead guitar) and Collins (drums).\n\nThough heavy on the pretension and a little long-winded on performance, early '70s Genesis clearly showcased the elite musical ability of its musicians and the ambitious reaches of their songwriting styles.\n\nThe 1976-1982 set documented the departure of Gabriel and the eventual loss of Hackett (perhaps a greater pure musical loss than Gabriel's defection, as Rutherford could never match Hackett's experimental guitar virtuosity). Once down to a core three members of Collins, Rutherford and Banks, the stage was set for the group's pop-rock breakout.\n\nNo rock group traveled better from the heady days of prog to the big money era of arena rock than Genesis, and the 1983-1998 set follows the act's most successful period. During this era, Genesis added Chester Thompson on drums to keep the beat while Collins sang up front, and Daryl Stuermer took over lead guitar duties from Rutherford when a Hackett-level solo was in order.\n\nThis new $140 live set from Rhino encompasses live shows from throughout the eras charted by the first three box sets. Like those studio music collections, the thoroughness and attention to detail in the live box is impressive, as soundboard recordings once treated as bootlegs (such as the Gabriel era \"Rainbow Room\" show) are included. And fans of that era should be thrilled to get hold of a rarity — a Gabriel-era Genesis performance enhanced on one of the set's DVDs.\n\nRhino's fourth (and presumably last) Genesis box set rounds out the complete remastered catalog nicely as a final overview of a band's unique evolution from small outdoor shows before crowds of pimply college intellectuals in soggy England to laser-light and JumboTron-laden megaconcerts in sold-out U.S. football stadiums.\n\nHate them, or secretly love them — no band did it like Genesis.\n\nImages courtesy Rhino.com\n\nSee also:\n\nGenesis' 'Illegal Alien': Worst Song Ever?
