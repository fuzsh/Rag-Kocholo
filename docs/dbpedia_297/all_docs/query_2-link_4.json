        "text": "There are, indeed, differences between the first account of creation in Genesis, and the second account in Genesis. The second account commences with chapter 2 verse 4. The points you raise may be due to the arrangement of words in the Septuagint version being followed too slavishly. The correct words are then set in the wrong place, resulting in an unintelligible contradiction. More on that later. First, the real significance of the two accounts:\n\n\"In the opening chapters of Genesis what immediately strikes the eye is the way in which the record of the Creation is repeated. There is not just one account. There are two accounts of Creation. These differ in length, content, and emphasis. This in itself indicates a profound mystery. Yet a mystery rarely noticed, seldom considered, and hardly opened.\n\nThe first account of Creation begins at Genesis 1:1 and ends at 2:3. These verses are characterized by the name ELOHIM - translated GOD in the English Bible - used exclusively in this passage and occurring thirty-three times.\n\nThe remainder of chapter two - that is, verses 4 to 25 - presents the second record of the Creation. This is worded in a completely different manner and considered from an entirely distinct aspect. Throughout this passage the divine name Elohim is marked by the addition of the name JEHOVAH, so as to read Jehovah Elohim, translated LORD God in the English Bible. This name occurs eleven times in these verses.\" Creation, John Metcalfe, pp.64-65, fifth impression 2008, http://www.johnmetcalfepublishingtrust.co.uk/contact_us.htm\n\nNotice needs to be taken of such things as why the first account makes no mention of Adam, or even the ground (Adamah), nor the fact that the man was to be a living soul. Eden is not mentioned, nor the trees of life and of the knowledge of good and evil. But the second account is concerned to introduce the man by name - Adam - and goes on at length about him, his manhood, his history and his posterity. He can then be seen as the head of the fallen race.\n\nAs the covenant name of God is only introduced on the seventh day, so did God only bring his covenant name to his people, Israel, via Moses. They had the first volume of the Torah - Genesis - and could now go back in time behind Jacob, Isaac and Abraham, to find their ultimate origin and root in Adam under the divine name Jehovah Elohim. Genesis 2:4 shows the beginning of the revelation of Jehovah to Israel, made known in Adam.\n\nTherefore, without grasping the two accounts of Creation, and their deliberate use of certain words and avoidance of other words, there will be confusion. A strictly literal translation of Gen. 2:5 gives, \"And every bush of the field not yet was it in the earth; and every green herb of the field not yet was it sprung up.\" (John Metcalfe, Ibid. p. 68) Also, \"And no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb of the field yet sprouteth, for Jehovah God hath not rained upon the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground\" (Young's Literal Translation). And also, \"And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up. (Revised Version)\n\nIf the word 'before' is brought to the front of the clause, and then the word 'it' is dropped, the verse now reads, \"And before any plant of the field was in the earth, and before every herb of the field grew\". This makes sense in view of verse 4:\n\n\"Observe the wording of verse 4 again: 'These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made the earth and the heavens.' Now, that day was the first day, Genesis 1:1. But - again note the translators' comma at the end of 2:4 - Genesis 2:5 continues to speak of the condition of things - described in Genesis 1:2 as being without form and void - on that same day. That is, the first day. three days before any plant was in the earth, and before any herb of the field grew. It was the first day of Creation, Genesis 1:1-5. Of this day, Genesis 2:4-5 speaks. Not until the third day - Genesis 1:9-13 - did vegetation appear on the earth.\n\nTo summarize: the words 'in the day' - Genesis 2:4-5 - correspond with the first day of Genesis 1:1-5.\" (Ibid. pp. 68-69)\n\nMore is explained by the author to show that the earth was clothed with verdure on the third day, whereas man was not created until the sixth day. As to rain, this did not fall until the Flood, so lack of rain and the absence of man could not be the reason for lack of verdure. On this point he concludes:\n\n\"Because of the difference in the viewpoint of the narrative, Chapter 1:1 to 2:3 states the events that took place in seven days, and the view of man on the sixth day uses the narrative of those events so as to point to and foreshadow a Man and a Creation yet to come.\n\nNot so chapter 2:4-5. Creation is briefly mentioned, but here the first man Adam is the subject of the narrative. The Creation awaited his being formed, to reach the fulfilment of its purpose Israel, chosen of Jehovah, should consider his origins, and ponder that purpose.\" (Ibid. p. 70)\n\nAnswer\n\nThis problem can be solved when we read Gen 2:5 onwards right after Gen 1:25 as explained below.\n\nThis is because, in Genesis first chapter, a global (i.e., worldwide) creation of things are described.\n\nIn Genesis second chapter, the creation of the Garden of Eden is described.\n\nHence, the seeming contradiction, which actually is no contradiction at all.\n\nExplanation\n\nIn Genesis 1, the creation is done on “the earth” (Ehrets - H776).\n\nBut in Genesis 2, the creation is done on “the field” (sadeh - H7704).\n\nH776 Ehrets = “From an unused root probably meaning to be firm; the earth (at large, or partitively a land)” – Strong.\n\nH7704 Sadeh = “From an unused root meaning to spread out; a field (as flat)” – Strong.\n\nSo, we can see that “Ehrets” is the earth or a continent or a large geographical area like a country whereas “Sadeh” is a local area like the Garden of Eden and the surroundings.\n\nThe word “sadeh” is not found in the first chapter. It appears first time in the second chapter where the Garden of Eden is mentioned.\n\nBesides, “Sadeh” is found in “Ehrets” (Gen 2:5).\n\nIn the first chapter, “the beasts of the Ehrets” (global) are created whereas in the second chapter “beasts of the Sadeh” (local flora and fauna) are created.\n\nIn the second chapter, the Garden of Eden is created in the Sadeh. Most of the descriptions here are about the Sadeh and the Garden. These are “localized” descriptions.\n\nIt would be impossible for Adam to name all the things created on the earth in a single day. Remember, he was created on the 6th day and by evening would start the Sabbath. So he had to name the creatures before the evening.\n\nBut God made him name only the localized creatures – the creatures of the sadeh/field which were less in number compared to the creatures of the ehrets/earth. (These could be mostly ‘domestic’ creatures?)\n\nThe fact is, the second chapter is a “blow-up” description of Genesis 1:26-27.\n\nThat is, the entire second chapter describes what exactly happened in Gen 1:26-27.\n\nSo the order of reading should be:\n\nStart from Genesis 1:1 to 1:25 (living things are created on the earth and man is created);\n\nNext read from Genesis 2:5 to 2:25: man is created and then the “local” (on the field) flora and fauna in and around the Garden of Eden are created;\n\nThen, come back and continue reading from Genesis 1:28 to Genesis 2:4.\n\nSo, 1:1 – 1:25;\n\nThen, 2:5 – 2:25; and\n\nContinue, 1:28 – 2:4\n\nThis will give a comprehensive picture of the whole creation.\n\nWhy the Confusion\n\nThe Scripture describes itself as a Jigsaw puzzle with details scattered “here a little and there a little” (Isaiah 28:13).\n\nInterestingly, this feature starts from the first chapters themselves!\n\nStrangely, the purpose is to hide the meaning; not to reveal (Mat 13:13)."
