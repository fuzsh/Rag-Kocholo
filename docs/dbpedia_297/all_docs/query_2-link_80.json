        "text": "In our last study, Abram had stepped up to serve as a blessing in Lot's life. God had told him his name would be great, and that he'd be a blessing (Genesis 12:2). And, after Abram rescued Lot from invading kings, Lot would agree.\n\nAfter defeating the four invading kings and returning the goods and peoples of the weaker kings, Abram had a meeting with the King of Salem and the King of Sodom. The King of Salem was named Melchizedek, and he was the priest of God Most High. Melchizedek was Abram's spiritual superior, and he extended a blessing from God onto Abram. In response, Abram tithed to Melchizedek.\n\nThe King of Sodom, on the other hand, was the ruler of a wicked people. When he met with Abram, he tried to give Abram the recovered riches. I'll take my people back, he said, But you keep the money. But Abram had made a vow to God, perhaps even while with Melchizedek, that he would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything from the King of Sodom. He didn't want this man to say, I have made Abram rich (Genesis 14:23).\n\n1 After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: \"Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.\"\n\nAfter These Things\n\nThis movement took place \" after these things,\" which is a reference to the meetings with the kings of Salem and Sodom. As I said, Abram had given a tithe to Melchizedek and had refused the riches of Sodom.\n\nIt seems that episode had stirred something in Abram. God had told him he'd become a great nation with a great name (Genesis 12:2). But, after all these years, and after refusing the wealth of Sodom, Abram seems to fall into a bit of fear. How is this going to work out, God? How am I to become a great nation? You won't let me take the reward of Sodom. I have no real ties to any nation. I am a nomadic journeyman. I can't be expected to defend my household forever.\n\nThis is often the case when God works in your life. After times of victory or spiritual success, we often succumb to fears and difficulties. Temptation rushes in. Even in the life of Christ, after the glorious baptism of John and the Spirit at the Jordan River, Jesus was driven into the wilderness for forty days of temptation. And it seems Abram underwent the temptation to fear after the victory of Genesis 14.\n\nSo God said, \"Fear not, Abram\" (1). God knew Abram's heart. God saw Abram's fear, so he addressed it with his presence in Abram's life. Since Abram had just risked his life by going to war with four city-nations, God said, \"I am your shield\" (1). And, since Abram had just refused the reward of the king of Sodom, God said, \"Your reward shall be very great\" (1). Or, as the NIV puts it, \"I am your shield, your very great reward\" (15:1, NIV). After \"missing out\" on the rewards of Sodom, Abram needed to know God would be his reward.\n\nYou see, Abram was a man living in between the promise and the fulfillment. God had made bold and big promises to him, and Abram had seen enough to know God was at work in his life, but the promises had not yet come to pass. He was in the difficult time of living in between the promise and the fulfillment.\n\nWe also live in an in-between time. As we've seen in the gospel of Mark, Jesus came proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, \"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel\" (Mark 1:15). So the kingdom is at hand. But we also pray, \"Your kingdom come \" (Matthew 6:10).\n\nRevelation 22:17 (ESV) — 17 The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.”\n\nRevelation 22:20 (ESV) — 20 Come, Lord Jesus!\n\nSo here we are, like Abram, living in between many of God's promises and the fulfillment. At times, we feel fear as we reject the way of the world, just as Abram felt fear rejecting the gifts of Sodom. We might even be prone to feelings of helplessness as we consider the odds against us. Will we be preserved by God? Is he worth following? Will he defend us? Will he fulfill his promises? To us, he might say, \"I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward\" (Genesis 15:1, NKJV).\n\n1. Let God Be Enough.\n\nLike Abram, God is our sustainer (shield) and our reward. He is enough. Abram knew this, which is why he'd said to the King of Sodom, \"I have lifted my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth\" (Genesis 14:22).\n\nHebrews tells us, Abram:\n\n\"...was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God.\" (Hebrews 11:10)\n\nHe came to a place where God, and what God provided, was enough. He believed in God's reward. He didn't need the blessings of Sodom because he had the blessings of God.\n\nIt is when we are in between the promise and the fulfillment we are greatly tested. Too often, we slip because we feel we cannot hang on any longer. Satan tempts us, and we come to a place where we think God is no longer enough. We turn back to Sodom, so to speak, when we turn to relationships that hurt us, a compromise which cannot fulfill us, or pride which debases us.\n\nFor example, I have watched far too many Christians, in a moment of loneliness, compromise all the knew to engage in a foolish relationship. Often, it costs them dearly, but while walking through their valley of the shadow of death, panic sets in, and they buckle. God's grace extends to us when we such decisions, but I have never met anyone who hasn't regretted their actions. Instead, they say, I wish I had trusted God. He is enough for me. I didn't know that in the moment.\n\nWe must let God be enough. In this passage, he tells Abram he will be his protector and provider. God's shield would defend Abram. God's presence would provide for Abram. This was an important message for Israel, for they often traded their glory for idols, but God is enough.\n\nToo often, we want more from God than we want God. You can hear this kind of sentiment in phrases like these:\n\nI am leaving my church for another because of the worship. This usually isn't a way to say that the worship in the new church is so God-focused and God-honoring, that the word and giving and service and singing of that new church are all like sweet incense of praise to him, but a way of saying the song time resonates with us personally. So isn't this just self-worship?\n\nI am tired of being single. I know what God's word says, but there are too few believers out there, and surely he wants me to be happy. But this is a great insult to the God of glory. It is a way of saying he is not enough, that he cannot satisfy the longings of your heart, and that he is not worthy of your obedience.\n\nI am going to give in to temptation. It is so attractive. If God didn't want me to enter into it, why did he allow it to be so attractive? But this is a perversion of God's creation. Of course, he made beautiful things and activities. He loves us. He wanted us to enjoy what he made as a way to celebrate him. But this is a way of saying we want life by our design rather than his.\n\nBut he is our shield. He is our reward. He is the one we need.\n\nA Prophet\n\nBefore moving onto Abram's response, I want to draw your attention to another feature of this first verse. It says, \"The word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision\" (4). First, the word of the Lord came. Second, Abram had a vision. Both are used later in Scripture to describe the way prophets interacted with God. God gave his prophets visions. His word came to them. So this language here portrays Abram as a prophet.\n\n2 But Abram said, \"O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\" 3 And Abram said, \"Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.\"\n\nAbram Said\n\nHere we have the first record of Abram's words to God. So far, in Genesis, Abram has spoken to his wife, Pharaoh, Lot, Melchizedek, and the king of Sodom. It's not that he hadn't prayed up to this point, but this is the first time his words are recorded for us.\n\nHe said, \"O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless?\" (2). A member of his household, a servant named Eliezer, was his heir at that point (2, 3). There is even a bit of wordplay here, as Eliezer's city, Damascus, sounds similar to the Hebrew word for heir (2). Without a child, how could God fulfill his promise to make his descendants a great nation?\n\nApparently, Abram and Sarai had taken the steps that were considered normal in their culture and time. Without a biological heir, they named a servant as their household heir. For a childless couple, it was considered a perfectly acceptable step. But it didn't sit right with Abram. What are you doing, God? You've made me this promise, but here's my situation.\n\n4 And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: \"This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.\" 5 And he brought him outside and said, \"Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.\" Then he said to him, \"So shall your offspring be.\"\n\nYour Very Own Son\n\nFor his part, God wouldn't acknowledge Eliezer, referring to him only as this man (4). He would not be Abram's heir. Instead, God promised, your very own son shall be your heir (4).\n\nSo Shall Your Offspring Be\n\nGod had already told Abram he'd become a great nation, and that his descendants would be as the dust of the earth (12:2, 13:16). Now God adds to the imagery by saying they would be innumerable like the stars of heaven (5). Later, God will say they would be like the sand on the seashore (22:17).\n\nThis was, of course, a reference to the people of Israel. But as Scripture unfolds, it becomes obvious God also had in mind the spiritual descendants of Abraham. Christ came from Abraham so:\n\n\"If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise. (Galatians 3:29)\n\nJust as Jesus' kingdom parables seem to make clear, the kingdom of God will grow and grow. Abraham's descendants became great and innumerable people. God's house is really big!\n\n2. See Past Circumstances.\n\nThe life lived in between the promise and the fulfillment, must be able to see past circumstances. All Abram could see what Eliezer. But God could see descendants as numerous as the stars of the sky and the sand on the seashore! God could see way beyond what Abram could see.\n\nYou see, God often works more slowly than we'd like. He was certainly working more slowly than Abram wanted. And all we can see is what we can see. We look around at our circumstances and ask, What are you doing, God? Do you see where things are at? Do you see what's happening here?\n\nBut, for that in-between life, we have a secret weapon: God himself. He spoke to Abram and told him about something beyond what Abram could see. And we have page after page of God's word. It is his way of drawing us into a better reality. He paints the picture there of what he is doing beyond our circumstances.\n\nThe ability to see past your circumstances and into God's reality is powerful. Is it not the skill Paul the Apostle had when he pushed past all his suffering in order to preach the gospel? He knew there was more to life than his circumstances.\n\n6 And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness.\n\nThe Father Of Faith\n\nAbram heard the promise of God and believed the Lord (6). It almost seems like an unnatural place for this belief to occur. God had already given Abram major promises in Genesis 12. Abram had worshipped the Lord at various altars he'd built in Genesis 12-13. The Lord had shown Abram the land he would give to him and his descendants in Genesis 13. And God had infused him with power to fight and given him the Melchizedekian blessing in Genesis 14. Only now do we learn Abram believed the Lord and the Lord counted it to Abram as righteousness (6).\n\nIs this the first time Abram believed God? Is this the moment of his conversion? Is he \"saved\" here at this episode?\n\nIt seems better to think of this as a summary statement of Abram's interactions with God. Generally, he believed God's promises, both here and earlier. God loved this faith and counted it to Abram as righteousness.\n\nImputed Righteousness\n\nModern believers know this is a pivotal moment in Scripture. When writing about righteousness apart from the keeping of the law in Romans, Paul said:\n\n\"What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? \"Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.\" (Romans 4:1–3, ESV).\n\nHe again used Genesis 15:6 in a similar way in Galatians 3:6. It was faith that unlocked the deposit of righteousness into Abraham's account. He believed God, and God made him righteous.\n\nToday, we are also called to believe the promise and revelation God has given. We know more than Abraham. The cross is in our rearview mirror. We know God the Son died in our place on the cross. We know the offer of forgiveness and redemption is held out to those who believe the cross to be the only means of salvation. And our faith in the promise of the cross leads God to deposit righteousness into our accounts. He counts -- or imputes -- righteousness to those who believe.\n\nAnd the righteousness we receive is the righteousness of Jesus. He came and lived a sinless and perfect life. He amassed perfect right-living before the Father. He kept the whole law of God right down to the core of his heart. And when we believe in Christ, the righteousness of Christ is imputed into our account. This is one of the reasons Jesus had to live a full life, rather than merely die as a child for our sins. He needed to fulfill all righteousness. He had to live out a righteous life. And it's his righteousness or record we receive deposited to our account.\n\nIf deposit or count sounds like financial terms, it's because they are. Imagine having a hundred dollars in your bank account. It's all you have. Then imagine a billionaire deposits their wealth into your account. That's the idea behind imputed righteousness; the righteousness of Jesus Christ has been deposited into the account of those who believe in him.\n\nWorks Cannot Save\n\nAbraham's faith annihilates all the other false-religions of the world. Though they've taken wildly varying forms, they share one thing in common. Salvation lies within you. Do specific things, and you can be saved. Be good. Be obedient. Be holy. Do random acts of kindness. However you want to say it -- be a good person, and you'll be saved.\n\nBut there are no good people. We've all been corrupted by sin. It has destroyed us. We cannot be right with God by our works. It cannot happen. There is no code of conduct, no law, you can keep to make yourself righteous.\n\nBut now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. (Romans 3:21–22, ESV).\n\nWorks Are Good\n\nNow all this talk of imputed righteousness might make someone think we don't believe in doing good works. Not at all. People who receive the deposit of Christ's righteousness should demonstrate countless good works. And Abraham is a great example of good works.\n\nJames wrote about this side of things. While Paul pointed to Abraham's faith, James pointed to Abraham's works. He wanted to motivate his audience to live in obedience to God. He specifically mentioned the way Abraham became willing to offer Isaac to God on the altar. It was a major act of devotion, a good work. James said, at that moment,\n\nThe Scripture was fulfilled that says, \"Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness\"—and he was called a friend of God. (James 2:23, ESV).\n\nBut the beautiful thing we learn from James' use of Abraham is that works follow faith. We believe in Jesus. Righteousness is deposited into our account. And then we jut out from our new position of righteousness into a life of good works! We aren't trying to earn a thing. We are merely trying to be who he's made us to be! We are now righteous people!\n\n3. Believe God's Word And Promises.\n\nAs awesome as it is to consider the soteriological ramifications of Abraham's faith, when we consider his belief in the setting of this episode, it speaks to us in an additional way. He was living in between the promise and the fulfillment, and God reassured him of the future he'd planned for Abram. And the man believed God.\n\nWe must believe his word to us as his people. We have great and precious promises in Christ. We must believe in redemption, restoration, cleansing, forgiveness, and the kingdom he has promised.\n\nI think of Joshua. He was the man who replaced Moses. He was called by God to lead the people of Israel into the promised land. He was a man who very much lived in between the promise and the fulfillment. And, rather than run in fear, he courageously led the people into the land. And God met him in the process. He believed God's word and promises. Because he did, they received the land God had in store.\n\nWhat does God have in store for you? Believe him and his promises.\n\nThe Covenant (15:7-21)\n\n7 And he said to him, \"I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.\"\n\nA Covenant With Abraham\n\nWhen God said this, it would've sounded very similar to a later word from God to the people of Israel after he'd brought them out of their slavery in Egypt.\n\n\"I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.\" (Exodus 20:2, ESV).\n\nThose words marked the beginning of Israel's covenant with God on Mount Sinai, and the words here in Genesis mark the beginning of God's covenant with Abraham. God had brought Abram out from Ur in order to give him the land to possess (7).\n\n8 But he said, \"O Lord God, how am I to know that I shall possess it?\" 9 He said to him, \"Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\" 10 And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half. 11 And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.\n\nQuestions\n\nGod's promise of the land brought questions up in Abram's mind: \"O Lord God, how am I to know that I shall possess it?\" (8). He'd heard God's promises before, but now he wanted some assurances. How would this actually happen? Would God promise him?\n\nBeautifully, God was not exasperated with his man or his questioning. Instead, he initiated a time of promise-keeping and covenant-making, telling Abram to bring various animals for sacrifice. God was ready to make a guarantee with his man. God was willing to graciously condescend to his beloved and chosen man.\n\nAbram Drove Them Away\n\nSo Abram did as God told him, bringing a three years old heifer, female goat, and ram, along with a turtledove and young pigeon (9). He cut all the animals except the birds in half, laying them out before God (10).\n\nBut with the sacrifice prepared, birds of prey came down on the carcasses (11). And Abram responded to this evil omen by driving them away (11). He is pictured as striving to keep those who would ruin the covenant away. He had to struggle.\n\nIn a moment, God will foretell of a long period of enslavement for Abram's descendants. Like these predatory birds, Egypt would come against the covenant people. But God would be faithful to Abram, and he would be faithful to Israel.\n\nThe Sacrifice\n\nThe cutting of the animals in half seems to speak of cutting or making a covenant with someone. God and Abram understood the practice, even if we do not.\n\nBut the animals of the covenant offering are interesting. Some see an allusion to Jesus in this sacrifice, a precursor to the worship system Israel later engaged in, a system that pointed to fulfillment in Jesus. That these animals were three years old only highlights the parallel with Christ, for he was crucified after three years of public ministry.\n\n4. Look To The Cross.\n\nWhen you are living in between the promise and the fulfillment, when the world seems dark and ominous, it is important to look to the cross of Christ. There, we are reminded of God's great love for us, and his promise to make all things new.\n\n\"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?\" (Romans 8:31–32, ESV).\n\nSometimes this is all we have, yet it is enough.\n\n12 As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. 13 Then the Lord said to Abram, \"Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years. 14 But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. 15 As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. 16 And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.\"\n\nThe Deep Sleep\n\nThat a deep sleep fell on Abram is wonderful (12). It is reminiscent of God's way of bringing Adam into the covenant of marriage. It also foreshadows the way we would be brought into Christ's covenant of grace. While dead in our trespasses and sins, completely asleep to the ways and thoughts of God, Christ died for us. He made a way for us while we were completely asleep.\n\nAfflicted For Four Hundred Years\n\nBut this deep sleep was also a picture of Abram's descendants. They were going to head into a deep sleep of a four hundred year sojourn in someone else's land, a foreshadowing of the slavery in Egypt (13). God said he would bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and this is precisely what he did in bringing the plagues on the Egyptians (14). And when the Egyptians had been completely overwhelmed by judgment, they finally sent the Israelites out with great possessions (14).\n\nThey Shall Come Back Here\n\nAnd though Abram would die in peace at a good old age, it would be his descendants who would come back to the land of promise (15). It would occur at the fourth generation, which might've been another way to say 400 years, since the patriarchs lived around 100 years each (16).\n\nThe Iniquity Of The Amorites\n\nAnd why would it take so long for the promise to find fulfillment? Why did they have to wait for the promised land? God said the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete (16). He was tolerating their sins, letting it come into full bloom before he brought judgment upon them. This highlights the longsuffering nature of God. They were fallen and depraved, but the next 400 years would lead to their full corruption.\n\nManifold Prophecy\n\nThis passage contains many prophecies that received literal and total fulfillment. First, Abram's descendants would be sojourners in a land that is not theirs (13). Second, they would be servants in that land (13). Third, they would be afflicted there for four hundred years (13). Israel was in Egypt for 430 years but suffered for 400 (Exodus 12:40). Fourth, God would judge the nation that they serve (14). Fifth, Israel would leave that nation with great possessions (14). Sixth, Abram would not take part in this suffering but would die in peace (15). Seventh, his descendants would come back to the land of promise (16). Of course, we know now that each prophecy came to pass just as God had said.\n\n5. Wait Through Darkness.\n\nFour hundred years is a long time. But God was willing to endure it to fulfill his promises. I doubt it was the answer Abram looked for, but it would have to suffice. God's plans are better than ours.\n\nAnd when you are living in between the promise and the fulfillment, you have to learn patience while waiting through darkness. Some low years were going to hit Abram's descendants, but God was going to use those years for his purposes. He would shape a nation through the fires of trial. He does the same in us today.\n\n\"In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.\" (1 Peter 1:6–7, ESV).\n\n17 When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. 18 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, \"To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, 19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites.\"\n\nMade A Covenant\n\nWhile it was dark, God came by the image of an oven (smoking fire pot) and a flaming torch (17). Each element seems to have a connection to ancient sacrificial, or even magical, rituals. God made a covenant with Abram (18). It was a one-sided affair, in that Abram was asleep while God made his promise. It was based on God, not Abram. God would keep his covenant.\n\n\"For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself...\" (Hebrews 6:13, ESV).\n\nThe Boundaries Of The Land\n\nGod detailed the boundaries of the land he would give Abram's descendant (18). Though there is some debate as to whether David's reign expanded to these broad territories or not, it is clear modern-day Israel does not possess all the land God detailed. Though I very much doubt this current iteration of Israel will ever obtain all this territory, I see no reason why Christ's coming wouldn't reestablish God's promise to Israel afresh. During the millennial reign of Christ, the vast promises God made Israel throughout the Old Testament prophets will come to pass. This one will likely be included.\n\nWhen Israel read this during Moses', what would they have discovered? First, they would have discovered minute prophecies God had fulfilled. Second, they would have discovered this additional promise laying out the land they would inherit. This should have emboldened them for the future God had prepared for them.\n\nCovenantal Similarities\n\nWhen Jesus died on the cross, establishing God's covenant with humanity, similarities occurred. There was darkness on the face of the land. As I said earlier, mankind was asleep or dead in trespasses and sins (Ephesians 2:1-3). Like the animals, Jesus suffered and died. The animals were split in two, and so was the veil inside the temple at Jesus' final breath. It was a dark and ominous moment.\n\nBut, through it all, Jesus has promised his people a kingdom. There is a territory he wills to give us. He desires our sanctification. He wants the church to be fruitful. And one day he will come again to establish his reign forever, and eventually a new heaven and earth.\n\n6. Set your mind on the kingdom.\n\nWhen living in between the promise and fulfillment, as we are today, it is good to set our minds on the kingdom of God. He has promised a glorious day will come, and when in the struggle, it is good for us to remember his promises to us. Just as Abram's descendants had the promised land to look forward to, so we have the establishment of Jesus' reign, inwardly and in the world, for which to hope.\n\nThe Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. (2 Peter 3:9, ESV)."
