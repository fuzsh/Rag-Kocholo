        "text": "Standard features on both Genesis models include dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, a proximity entry system, a power sunroof, power heated side mirrors, heated leather seats, and a seven-speaker sound system. The 4.6 model upgrades to premium upholstery, a rear sunshade, a leather-wrapped dash, and rain-sensing wipers. A Technology Package adds ultrasonic front and rear parking sensors, a heated and cooled driver’s seat, and adaptive front lighting, along with a navigation system and DVD changer.\n\nThere’s also a Lexicon surround-sound audio system with 500 watts, 12 channels, and 17 speakers, plus an HD radio tuner. All Genesis sound systems come with XM Satellite Radio and inputs for USB and iPod attachments, and models with the navigation system also bring the XM NavTraffic service, a Bluetooth interface, and a screen-based menu system.\n\nThe Genesis comes with all the expected safety equipment for a high-end luxury sedan, and then some. Side-curtain airbags for front and back occupants, front side airbags, rear side airbags, and active front head restraints are included, along with electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes. The 2009 Hyundai Genesis received five-star crash-test ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), but has not yet been crash-tested by the insurance-affiliated IIHS.\n\nThe prominent, brightly chromed grille, which helps bring a sense of proportion from the front, was the focus of several positive comments. Autoblog didn’t heap as much praise as the rest, saying simply that beyond the grille, the styling isn’t that memorable.\n\nThough the exterior of the 2009 Hyundai Genesis did little to raise the pulse of any reviewers, most were gushing with compliments regarding the stylish interior, which wows with surfaces, materials, and hues unseen on Hyundai’s lesser models. “If the exterior sets modest expectations, the interior exceeds them,” said Car and Driver. Nearly all versions of the Genesis come with a leather-wrapped dash and glossy wood accents. Most said that these rank it alongside vehicles from traditional luxury brands, but Motor Trend took issue with the “unconvincing fake wood appliqués.”\n\nThe dashboard forgoes the pronounced dual-cockpit design of some sport sedans for a more open design. “The soft curves of the sweeping dashboard architecture are complemented by an elegantly adorned center stack,” describes Edmunds, also noting, “The instrument panel’s white-on-black electroluminescent gauges look like they came straight out of a Lexus.”\n\nTheCarConnection.com’s editors share the views of most of our colleagues; if you don’t catch the grille—which looks a bit like those on older Mercedes-Benz models from some angles—the Genesis blends into the crowd. But then again, that probably goes to show that Hyundai has achieved its goal. Its interior, with its rich materials and a design unlike that of Hyundai’s mainstream vehicles, is impressive by any measure.\n\nThe base 2009 Hyundai Genesis comes with a 290-hp, 3.8-liter V-6 engine, but the real star of the lineup is the new V-8 model, featuring an all-new 4.6-liter Tau V-8. Car and Driver noted that the engine’s output of 375 hp on premium fuel “puts the engine in a fairly exclusive crowd,” but several other reviewers noted the lack of direct-injection technology in the V-8 engine, surprised by such an omission on a new engine. But Popular Mechanics commended the V-8’s 17-mpg city and 25-mpg highway fuel economy numbers, declaring them “right in line with the best of the segment.”\n\nBoth engines get a six-speed manual transmission, but several reviewers noticed the omission of steering-wheel paddle-shifters—now almost a requisite feature in sport sedans. Automobile clarified that the Genesis actually gets two different automatic transmissions: an Aisin with the V-6 and a ZF with the V-8.\n\nThere were no complaints about the Genesis’s straight-line quickness or braking. Car and Driver cited the Genesis’s 5.6-second 0-60-mph time, among other impressive performance figures, saying, “That puts the Genesis in with the lofty company it aspires to compare with.” Autoblog couldn’t find a good practical reason to buy the V-8 over the V-6, though, as the latter is nearly as fast, costs less money, and is otherwise almost identical. The V-6 version can reach 130 mph, while the V-8 tops out at 155 mph.\n\nThe way in which the 2009 Hyundai Genesis handles was much more a subject of controversy. The suspension, according to Car and Driver, “is as sophisticated as they come,” with aluminum components and a four-link front arrangement that helps reduce bump steer. “Our brief driving impression revealed well-controlled drive motions, predictable handling, and an excellent powertrain,” said Car and Driver.\n\nAutomobile appealed for more road and steering feel, commenting that “for a sedan that so unabashedly aims for the best from Germany, it still needs a more Teutonic tilt to the chassis tuning.” Road & Track explained that Hyundai has made an effort to firm up the Genesis’s multilink front and rear suspension for the U.S. market, yet it’s tuned to favor comfort. Car and Driver agreed that “the Genesis is tuned more for Lexus-like isolation than BMW-like involvement.” “Push it hard, though, and the front tires scrub into the pavement,” said Motor Trend, reiterating the lack of handling sportiness.\n\nWhile the electrohydraulic steering system in V-8 models brings reasonably communicative steering, the V-6 models have an inferior system with “a disappointing lack of steering feel,” according to Automobile. The steering was also criticized by Motor Trend as somewhat light and numb, and said that it required more small corrections at high speed than the Infiniti M35. Popular Mechanics was more creative, saying that when pushed hard, the Genesis “felt like it was floating through a bucket of marshmallow fluff.”\n\nWith comparison BMW 530i, Infiniti M35, and Lexus ES 350 models on hand in South Korea, Winding Road said otherwise, curiously. Hyundai got the chassis tuning just about right, they said. “The solid chassis is nimble and strikes the right balance between agile and comfy.”\n\nTo TheCarConnection.com's editors, it's difficult to find a reason not to choose either engine. The 290-horsepower V-6 is strong and smooth enough, but the V-8 is truly remarkable. With 375 horsepower, it never seems to run out of energy. The six-speed automatic transmission coupled to both engines has a manual mode, but shift paddles would greatly accentuate the \"sport\" tag that Hyundai wants to be applied to the Genesis. In terms of ride and handling, the Genesis is clearly biased toward the former. It's fairly unflappable cruising over large bumps at freeway speed, and even in some back-to-back handling tests arranged by Hyundai, the Genesis acquits itself well against the Mercedes E-Class and the BMW 7-Series, even. The Genesis, though, is less confident at truly high speeds than the Germans; the cushy ride gets a little nervous at triple-digit speeds, though it never loses composure. Rapid switchbacks bring out the roll and lean designed into the ride quality, but it's controllable stuff--and another sign of Hyundai's growing confidence in tuning its cars to handle well, if on the softer side of the spectrum.\n\nThe Genesis’s cabin is quieter and more refined than most entry-luxury vehicles, according to reviewers. Popular Mechanics mentioned the “thick levels of engine sound damping,” while Winding Road declared, “Wind, road, and engine noise are at or close to segment best.” Popular Mechanics also relished the isolation inside, saying that “there was very little noise intrusion inside the cocoon-like cockpit of this quiet sedan.”\n\nReviewers were at odds about assembly quality and the fine details of the 2009 Hyundai Genesis. “Fit and finish, stitching, touch, materials, and integration are all very good,” raved Autoblog, keeping in mind the under-$40,000 price tag for the V-8.\n\n“The Genesis isn’t just the best-appointed Hyundai, it’s good enough to be judged against established marques,” raved Car and Driver.\n\nAutomobile also lauded fit and finish and the materials used, but pointed to the unconvincing “stitched leather” seats, saying that it would be more convincing “if it were French stitched, with two rows of stitching rather than one.” Popular Mechanics found fault with some of the details on their pre-production test car, including doors that shudder when slammed, and rear shelf speakers that were exposed to the trunk.\n\nTheCarConnection.com's editors could only find a minor flaw or two in the Genesis' upscale cabin. It's heavily reminiscent of the Infiniti M, especially in the center stack, where a wave of silver buttons controls the major functions (there's also an iDrive-like controller that manipulates media and climate controls). The buttons can be hard to pick out from behind the wheel, when you just want to speed up the fan--but the look is sophisticated and rich. Hyundai's entertainment controller made connecting to music in an iPhone a breeze, and its navigation menus seemed far easier to use than some setups. Front seats have ample cushioning, and the back seat has truly adult-sized room; you can cross a leg over knee and still have enough room between it and the front seatback. A minor ripple in a pre-production V-8 sedan with the leather-trimmed dash was the only noticeable flaw on TheCarConnection.com's test vehicles."
