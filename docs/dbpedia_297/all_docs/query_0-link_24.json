        "text": "TNA iMPACT!\n\nOrlando, Florida (iMAPCT! Zone @ Universal Studios)\n\nJanuary 22, 2009\n\nCommentators: Mike Tenay & Don West\n\nReport by: Josh Boutwell of WrestleView.com\n\nIt’s time to cross the line! The show starts with a recap from last week and then Don & Mike hype the rest of the card, but we will start with Alex Shelley’s first X-Division Title defense!\n\nTNA X-Division Championship\n\nFatal Four Way Match\n\nAlex Shelley (c) vs. ?The Guru? Sonjay Dutt w/So Cal Val vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sheik Abdul Bashir\n\nShelley and Sabin actually come out together tonight for this match. One fall to the finish, first man with a pin or submission wins the Title and this week Mike Tenay finally reveals why Shane Sewell is a referee again: he was reinstated by Jim Cornette. Shelley and Sabin start the match off and they pick right up where they left off at Genesis. Shelley with a wristlock but Sabin rolls through and gets one of his own and then Shelley reverses and it’s an armdrag but Sabin reverses it into a rollup for a nearfall. Sabin and Shelley clap at each other but then get attacked from behind by Sonjay and Bashir. They put the boots to the Guns and then take turns hitting chops on Shelley. They double whip Shelley into the ropes and go for a double clothesline but Shelley ducks, put Dutt in a waistlock, and then shoves Dutt into Bashir. The Guns whip Bashir into the ropes and then both hit double leg kicks to take him to his knees and then destroy him with double head kicks! Dutt back in and hits the Guns from behind. Dutt taunts the crowd and then kicks Sabin on the mat. Dutt with an elbow and then charges at Shelly, but Shelley backdrops Sonjay over the top rope onto the apron where Dutt lands on his feet. Shelley then drops down onto all fours and Sabin comes flying with a Dropkick off Shelley’s back onto Sonjay sending him crashing to the floor. Bashir tried to cut Sabin off in midair but he missed him. Shelley then slingshots over the top rope onto the ring apron and then back kicks Dutt in the face and jumps up to the middle rope. Sabin goes for the Suicide Dive through Shelley’s legs but Bashir clotheslines him and Dutt pulls Shelley off the ropes hitting his face on the apron in the process. In the ring Bashir scoop slams Sabin and follows up with an Elbow Drop for a two count. Dutt in now and he snapmares Sabin over and Double Stomps Sabin’s face. Basahir and Dutt whip Sabin into the ropes and then double back elbow him and Shelley tries to get back in the ring but Dutt kicks him in the face. Bashir covers Sabin for a two count and Dutt didn?t like that too much. Dutt chokes Sabin on the ropes and then Bashir does it too. Dutt stands on the back of Shelley’s neck as he is draped over the middle rope throatfirst choking him. Dutt again kicks Shelley as he tries to get back in the ring. Bashir and Dutt take turns punching Sabin but he comes back with shots to both men’s ribs and then forearms and goes for a kick on Bashir, but Bashir catches his leg and spins around where Sabin hits a spinning leg sweep! Dutt with a rollup for a nearfall but Sabin kicks out sending Dutt through the ropes to the floor. In the ring Bashir rolls Sabin up but So Cal Val is distracting Shane Sewell! Finally Sewell turns around and Bashir gets a nearfall. Bashir begins to argue with Sewell again and goes to punch him but Dutt stops him and dropkicks him to the floor. Dutt attempts to whip Sabin into the ropes but he reverses it and Superkick’s Dutt in the gut. Sabin whips Dutt into the ropes and Sabin charges but Dutt escapes it by climbing through the middle rope and then hits the Bombay Boom (seesaw-like Tiger Feint Kick) that causes Sabin to fall throat first onto the middle rope. Dutt then hits his Slingshot Guillotine Leg Drop. Dutt comes off the ropes and charges at Sabin but eats a nasty clothesline that turns Dutt inside out. Bashir comes running in and hits a Running Enziguri on Shelley as Sharmell is shown walking down the ramp. Bashir covers Shelley and gets a nearfall before Sabin breaks it up. Sabin then throws Bashir back to the outside and Sabin goes for a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker on Dutt but he reverses it into a beautiful tilt-a-whirl Tornado DDT for a nearfall. Dutt slaps Sabin in the face and then hits repeated shoulder blocks. Dutt attempts to whip Sabin into the corner but he reverses it and charges it and eats a boot from Dutt. Dutt climbs to the top and goes for a Flying Hurricanrana but Sabin blocks it and Shelley runs in and hits a basement dropkick. Sabin then transitions Dutt into the Cradle Shock, but Bashir pulls him out of the ring allowing Shelley to roll Dutt up in a modified Magistral Cradle for the pin to retain his title!\n\nWinner & STILL X-Division Champ: Alex Shelley via pinfall (rollup)\n\nAfter the match Sharmell tells Shane Sewell that Booker wants to see him in his locker room right now and then we see Kurt Angle, Scott Steiner, and Sting on their way out of their locker room.\n\n—COMMERCIAL BREAK—\n\nBack from commercials Booker T. tells Sewell to have a seat. Booker isn?t playing tonight, no King accent. Booker tells Sewell to relax and he tells Sewell that around here they do things different than they do them in Puerto Rico. Booker says that Sewell did something out of order, he put his hands on the Legends Champion. Booker says that’s grounds for a ass whooping but Sharmell stops him and he says he wants to talk business with Sewell. Booker says he is going to give Sewell a pass but only if Sewel l makes sure that tonight Booker and Steiner have Petey all alone in their Elimination Match. Booker even says that Sewell could be the Mafia’s car washer and asks Sewell if they have an understanding but he just walks out.\n\nMain Event Mafia members Kurt Angle, Scott Steiner, & Sting make their way down to the ring none looking too happy. Kurt says that last week things didn?t work out exactly like they had planned. Angle says that Team 3D is in Japan and Mick Foley is in Europe promoting TNA so they will get theirs next week. Tonight Petey Williams and AJ Styles will get it. Kurt says that they underestimated Petey Williams and they thought he was dead and buried. Kurt says that TNA isn?t Ozz and munchkins don?t run around there and calls TNA the house that Main Event Mafia built. Kurt talks about the Elimination Tag Match between Steiner & Booker against Eric Young and Petey Williams. Kurt says that after that match the only ones left in the ring will be Petey Williams and the Main Event Mafia and then tells Petey to have a nice day and smiles at the camera. Kurt says that AJ was part of the reason he was put through a table last week and the fans cheer which doesn?t make Kurt happy. Kurt tells AJ that payback is a b*tch and he is going to whoop AJ’s ass tonight and put him through a table, but afterward they are going to put AJ out permanently. Kurt asks who died and made 3D bookers because they can?t go around making matches. Kurt says that they can take their challenges for Against All Odds and stick them up their ?fat asses.? Sting calls Angle ?Mr. Godfather? and says that he can speak for himself. Sting says that no one will tell him who can and cannot wrestle and then Sting says something in Kurt’s ear as Jim Cornette walks out to the ring. Jim says that Kurt is right that 3D can?t book matches in TNA, but he does. He says it won?t be Sting vs. Brother Ray or Angle vs. Devon. It will be a Fatal Four Way with Sting defending against Brother Ray, Brother Devon, and Kurt Angle with the first man with the pinfall being the World Champion! Cornette talks about how the best way to win a four way is to team up and take out their opponents and they know that 3D can work together, but the question is can Angle and Sting. Cornette says that at Against All Odds they may be a ?death in the family? and both Sting and Kurt do not look pleased about this.\n\n—COMMERCIAL BREAK—\n\nBack from commercial they show a video package of the history between Petey Williams and Scott Steiner.\n\nIn the back Lauren is with Petey. Petey is serious and he says that the thing between the Main Event Mafia and the Front Line, it’s personal between them. He says that he knows Scotty’s past about how he bullies everybody from the production crew to Ric Flair but he tells Scott to try and bully him around. Petey says that Scott needs to worry about tonight because if he has one foot in yesterday and one foot in tomorrow then he’s pissing all over today. Petey then calls Scott a ?little bitch? and walks away.\n\nMike and Don are talking ?via satellite? from Tokyo, Japan with Team 3D who are flaunting their new IWGP Tag Team Championships. Tenay talks about how there has only been one other American tag team to hold those titles and Devon says that those belts prove that they are the greatest Tag Team in history. Ray says that winning the IWGP Tag Titles in Tokyo is like winning any Tag Titles in Madison Square Garden back in America. West talks about the Fatal Four Way just made but Ray and Devon look surprised. Ray says that if he has to go through Kurt Angle and his brother to get to Sting then he?ll do it. Ray says that it won?t be the first time they?ve fought and Devon says it won?t be the last. Tenay asks Ray who is going to win the Title at AAO but as he starts to answer they ?lose? the audio feed. Tenay apologizes and they go to commercials.\n\n—COMMERCIAL BREAK—\n\nBack from commercial JB is with the Main Event Mafia minus Kurt Angle. JB asks Sting about what happened between he and Kurt tonight. Sting says that they haven?t forgotten what this war is about and tells Booker to tell him and Booker responds with, ?RESPECT!? Sting says that JB is disrespecting them by trying to stir things up and says Kurt is his brother. Sting says that will stay the course because they haven?t forgotten what this about. Sting tells 3D to keep that in mind because there is enough respect to go around for everybody and then leaves. Steiner starts rambling about being unstoppable and then calls Steiner Make Believe Muscle and he says Petey will pay tonight and he won?t be responsible for what he does tonight. Booker then says respect again and walks out.\n\nTNA Rough Cut w/ Sojournor Bolt\n\nSojourner and Terry Taylor talks about her being a part of Kong’s open Challenge back at Slammiversary (then known as Josie I believe) and how that got everyone’s attention. Bolt says that she is 100% the real deal and talks about having blonde hair and fake nails but when she punches you in the face that’s real. JB says that Bolt gained Kong’s respect and she says that if you want it you have to work for it and if you want to be on top you have to meet her in the ring.\n\nSojournor Bolt vs. ODB\n\nTenay says that ODB will challenge Kong for the Knockouts Title at Against All Odds and Sojo attacks ODB before the bell and puts the boots to her. Sojo works on ODB’s knee and goes for a clothesline in the corner but ODB moves and hits chops. Sojo comes back with a leg kick to ODB’s knee again and follows up with a clothesline for a 2 count. ODB is selling the knee and Sojo hits a snapmare followed by a Basement Dropkick. Sojo climbs to the top goes for a Big Splash but ODB moves. ODB with forearms and a clothesline.

Tenay puts over how ODB will have to work against Kong with an injured knee now.\n\nIn the back Lauren is with the fake Sarah Palin aka Daffney. She is still doing the accent but then stops and laughs about how fun it was to make fools out of them when The Beautiful People come up and beat the hell out of her. Angelina throws Daffney into a case and then Velvet Sky hits her with a 2×4. Angelina and Velvet continue to beat the hell out of her and cuss her out. Angelina chokes her until security runs up and then Kip takes out security and gets Angelina to let go.\n\nTag Team Elimination Match\n\n?Big Poppa Pump? Scott Steiner & Booker T. w/Sharmell vs. ?Maple Leaf Muscle? Petey Williams & ?Showtime? Eric Young\n\nBooker and EY will start the match off tonight.

EY comes back with right hands but Steiner hits him from behind to stop that momentum. Booker hits the Axe Kick on EY out of nowhere and gets the pin to eliminate EY. That was mighty quick and now we go to commercials.\n\n—COMMERCIAL BREAK—\n\nBack from commercials Steiner is putting the boots to Petey and they show the beatdown that MEM put on Petey during the break.

Kurt gets on top of the announce table and screams ?Look Ma, I?m on top of the world? James Cagney style to end the show.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI thought tonight was all about setting up everything for Against All Odds and did a decent job in that. The matches were fun for the most part but some were too short. I thought it was an okay show this week.\n\nThe opening X-Division Four Way was decent but way too short (under 5 minutes) but all 4 worked hard. I didn’t like how Sharmell came out during the match taking away from what was going on in the ring, though. Shelley is going to be a good Champion but I want to know where they are going with the Guns. I still think that Bashir and Dutt would make a great tag team as the Middle Eastern Nightmares.\n\nI don’t really care for the Booker T./Shane Sewell angle but I’m loving that Booker has gone back to the ghetto-accent and dropped the stupid King one.\n\nThe Main Event Mafia promo was okay thought I thought the friction between Kurt and Sting was set up nicely and everyone saw that coming eventually. Let’s just see where they go with it. The Fatal Four Way Main Event announced for AAO is so much better than Devon vs. Kurt and Sting vs. Ray singles matches it’s not even funny.\n\nThe 3D “interview from Japan” was a little much. It was kind of corny with the Japanese flag in the background but I did love how they put over them winning the IWGP titles. I didn’t really get the “audio trouble” they had abruptly ending the interview.\n\nSting’s promo in the back was great and he should do all his promos like that.\n\nBolt vs. ODB was nothing special at all and it was obvious they were just doing it as setup for the injury to ODB going into the match against Kong. That should be an interesting match though given Kong’s legit knee and back injuries and now ODB probably selling a knee injury.\n\nThe Beautiful People beat down on Daffney was great and a better payoff of that angle than the stupid stuff they did last week. Angelina looked insane during the whole thing.\n\nThe Tag Team Elimination Match was just not done very well. It was an okay match itself but they really buried Petey and EY in the match, in my opinion. They really buried EY by having him eliminated within minutes. Then, they put over that Petey wouldn’t give up but then had him destroyed by Steiner and Booker. Hopefully Petey gets put over Scotty in the end because that would be big for him in my opinion.\n\nOh, man was that Matt Morgan interview just great. It just felt way too corny to be the end of it and that paid off. The First Blood Match was really good, with action all over the place but the Morgan turn was great. He killed Abyss with that first chair shot and now we finally have the monser back, hopefully to stay. Morgan vs. Abyss should be a bloody feud.\n\nThe Main Event was very solid as AJ and Kurt ALWAYS work well together and this match was completely different than any other match they’ve had. I really hope they dont sell AJ as hurt for several weeks like they did with Ray and Joe. AAO probably wont have Joe already, they can’t have AJ off the show too. Angle’s promo after the match was golden. That guy really looks like he has absolutely lost it at this point and that are putting that over nicely. The on top of the world reference was nice too.\n\n– Match of the Night: AJ Styles vs. Kurt Angle (***)\n\n– Segment/Promo of the Night: Angle’s post match promo\n\n– Overall Grade: B-\n\nScheduled for Next Week:\n\n– Nothing announced so far\n\nAgainst All Odds Lineup so far:\n\n– TNA World Title Fatal Four Way: Sting (c) vs. Kurt Angle vs. Brother Ray vs. Brother Devon\n\n– TNA Knockouts Title: Awesome Kong (c) vs. ODB\n\n– TNA Tag Titles: Beer Money (c) vs. Lethal Consequences"
