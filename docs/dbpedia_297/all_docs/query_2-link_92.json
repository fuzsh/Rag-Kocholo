        "text": "Hope\n\nSmiles from the threshold of the year to come,\n\nWhispering ‘it will be happier’…” -Lord Alfred Tennyson\n\nI’ve long pondered how different life would be if we didn’t allow ourselves to feel the emotions of hope and expectation. Life certainly would have been much simpler without the emotional roller coaster that hope often accompanies.\n\nMy thoughts frequently turn to questions like, “Why do humans persist in this manner?” Why not accept reality as it is, with no hopes for the future? What motivates us to see the bright side of life, even when it is essentially unfair?\n\nThe genesis of this positivity and hope is a profound mystery.\n\nYet, despite this simplicity, there is something undeniably fascinating about the way hope colours our world.\n\nHope is the lens through which we perceive pleasure amidst suffering and pain. It sees light in the darkest of woods. In the face of life’s harshest trials, humans tenaciously cling to hope.\n\nThink about the event that is carried out on December 31st.\n\nPeople around the world wait anxiously for the clock to strike midnight. When the clock strikes twelve, a symbolic revolution begins — a simple shift in a number that still inspires happiness and hope. This moment, which has been anticipated for over a whole year, perfectly captures the human spirit of optimism that endures.\n\nDespite arbitrary change in number, this alteration signals a new beginning and the limitless potential of a new year.\n\nThis global celebration is more than a ritual; it is a tribute to humanity’s unwavering faith in the possibility of better days ahead, even in the smallest and most insignificant of changes.\n\nThe Concept of Hope\n\nThe concept of hope is deeply intertwined with human existence, shaping our perception of the world and our actions within it. At its core, hope represents an optimistic state of mind that is based on the expectation of positive outcomes with respect to events and circumstances in one’s life.\n\nAlthough, things not always turn out as one hopes and expects them to be. However, it does not stop humans from hoping.\n\nThe reasons why humans hold onto hope, even in the face of life’s unfairness and challenges, are varied and complex.\n\nReasons of Hoping\n\nBiological and Evolutionary Aspects: Hoping could be viewed as a survival strategy from an evolutionary perspective. It can inspire people to overcome challenges and work towards improved circumstances, raising their chances of surviving and procreating.\n\nReligious and Cultural Influences: In many cultures, hope is cherished and fostered. Optimism and the hope for a brighter future are highly valued in many religions. Consider Islamic society, which values optimism and hope. In one of the verses from Quran Allah (SWT) tells humans in this profound way that:\n\n‘Verily. With hardship comes ease. ‘ (Quran, 94:5)\n\nHence, emphasizing the aspect of hope.\n\nSimilarly In historic literature of Hinduism, hope is referred to with Pratidhi (Sanskrit: प्रतिधी), or Apêksh (Sanskrit: अपेक्ष). It is discussed with the concepts of desire and wish.\n\nIn Vedic philosophy, karma was linked to ritual sacrifices (yajna), hope and success linked to correct performance of these rituals.\n\nLikewise, in Christianity Hope is regarded as “One of the three main elements of Christian character (1 Cor. 13:13)”.\n\nAt another place it has been mentioned that “Unbelievers are without this hope (Eph. 2:12; 1 Thess. 4:13)”.\n\nPersonal Experiences and Learning: A person’s capacity for hope is also shaped by their individual experiences. Hope can be reinforced by favourable experiences and successful outcomes in the past. In a similar way, optimism can be derived from witnessing others triumph against adversity.\n\nIn essence, hope and optimism are not just responses to the fairness or unfairness of life, but are deeply embedded in human nature, shaped by a myriad of factors including biology, religion, culture and personal experiences.\n\nThese elements combined create a powerful force that drives humans to look forward with anticipation, even in the midst of uncertainty and difficulty. As aptly put by Pablo Neruda that:\n\nYou can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep Spring from coming.\n\nSo, with these lines, I conclude my article in the hope that this year would bring happiness, blessings, peace, and harmony to the globe, especially in these times of conflict in Palestine."
