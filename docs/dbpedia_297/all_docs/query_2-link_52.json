        "text": "Don’t doubt in the shadows what God has revealed in the light. God’s promise is meant to silence doubt.\n\nLuke 1:3 (NLT) Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write an accurate account for you, most honorable Theophilus,\n\nA Whole New World. Luke, the Greek doctor, begins his account of Jesus’ birth and life in a very “Greek” way. So it reads like a journal, a simple account of events. But then, within a paragraph or two, we jump into a very different world.\n\nLuke 1:11 (NET) An angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense, appeared to him.\n\nAngels, Prophecies, Miracles, and Hope. We very much need to remember that Christianity comes from a miraculous back story. The Bible is filled with giants, floods, supernatural armies, and hopeless situations. It only seems fitting that the story of John the Baptizer and Jesus the Christ would begin with a miraculous introduction.\n\nLuke 1:8 (NLT) One day Zechariah was serving God in the Temple, for his order was on duty that wee\n\nGod’s Presence\n\nGod Knew Zechariah’s Schedule. This was a very special day for Zechariah. Many priests never even got a chance to perform this service. For many, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. So, this was a big day for Zechariah.\n\nThe Temple was divided into two rooms, The Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. The Holy Place held a table for bread that was baked daily. There was also a seven-wick oil lamp that gave light to the chamber. And, there was an altar for burning incense that sat in front of a thick curtain.\n\nZechariah’s task was to burn incense on that altar. His job was to fill the Holy Place with a wonderful fragrance that would drift into the Most Holy Place. Everything about the Temple represented something and the incense represented PRAYER.\n\nLuke 1:10 (NLT) While the incense was being burned, a great crowd stood outside, praying.\n\nDo YOU pray? Do WE Pray? I know sometimes it makes us feel awkward. Or It can feel like we are weak when we pray. This is because we think we should always give our all, and only if that isn’t enough, then we should pray. But, of course, this approach leaves us feeling as though we have failed.\n\nMaybe, we’ve been lied to. Maybe, the reality is that we don’t actually pray that much. Maybe, if we were honest, God hasn’t done that much for us because we really haven’t asked Him for that much. And, if we did ask Him, we didn’t ask for very long. Many get angry at God for unanswered prayers, when they gave themselves years to fix the problem. They gave their doctors months to fix the problem. Yet when they FINALLY turn to God, they expect Him to move instantly in return.\n\nSo, know this, there is no Christmas Story without a prayer story. Let us begin working on our prayer story. THEN, God might just interrupt our prayers!\n\nLuke 1:19 (NLT) Then the angel said, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to bring you this good news!\n\nWaiting On God\n\nGod doesn’t do things like you do things. Logic and reason are dependent upon information and the correct interpretation of said information. But the simple reality is that we don’t know what God knows. I know that you know, what you know. But, you also don’t know what you don’t know.\n\nSo, God does things you don’t understand in ways you don’t understand.\n\nYour Mistakes Have Been Taken Into Account. When the Angel revealed himself, Zechariah had something in the neighborhood of a heart attack. Then the Angel speaks ‘prophetically’ over Zechariah. He tells him how God sees him and what God sees him doing. “You’re gonna be the dad of my last Old Covenant Prophet. The one who sets up the ending and the beginning.”\n\nWhat he shoulda said was nothing.\n\nHave confidence in discoveries made in God’s presence. God will figure it out. What God is going to do in your life is His problem, not yours. I struggle with trying to accomplish God’s purposes in my power. That’s frustrating. We are God’s masterpiece in Christ, not our own masterpiece in our own power..\n\nIsaiah 40:31 (ESV) But they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint. ​​\n\nGod’s time table isn’t even in your realm of comprehension. Waiting on God is the secret. God isn’t a microwave that produces piping hot frozen food. God does things right. Learn to wait on God.\n\nPrepare For Destiny\n\nWaiting is NOT doing nothing. New parents waiting for their new baby, are waiting but they are NOT doing nothing. The preparer of a delicious slow-cooked meal is NOT doing nothing.\n\nWaiting changed Zechariah. Consider this…\n\nLuke 1:18 (NLT) Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure this will happen? I’m an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years.”\n\nHere is a man of doubts. Here is a man beaten by his circumstances. This man is not ready to be the father of God’s exclamation point upon the Old Testament!\n\nBut look at this:\n\nLuke 1:68-79 (NLT) “Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and redeemed his people. 69 He has sent us a mighty Savior…\n\nWhat the heck happened to that guy!? Same guy, different guy. The difference? A lifetime of waiting, capped off by nine months of waiting on God. Zechariah had nine months to prepare that “word”. Nine months of silence, of stillness, of remembering an Angel and the prophecy that Angel declared. Nine months of stewing and unable to share the situation, even with Elizabeth.\n\nBe prepared to Testify. Maybe, your season of waiting is really just a good time to work on your victory speech!"
