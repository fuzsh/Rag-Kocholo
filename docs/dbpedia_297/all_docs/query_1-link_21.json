        "text": "From an exceptional round at Riviera that earned him an exemption into the Genesis Scottish Open, 2024 Genesis Invitational Collegiate Showcase champion Cole Rueck is headed to golf country, marking a first in the event’s decade-span history.\n\nIn continuation of programming through its partnership with TGR Foundation, Genesis employees recently volunteered at the TGR Learning Lab in Anaheim, California to advance access to science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education for youth in the community. Partnering with Child Creativity Lab, Genesis hosted workshops at the TGR Learning Lab where members participating in the after-school program learned how to develop their own future mobility vehicles using reclaimed and upcycled materials.\n\nIt has been said that playing well at Riviera can lead to success at Augusta National. While winning at one course doesn’t necessarily mean guaranteed success at the other, putting together a solid four rounds in Los Angeles in February can be a barometer for what’s to come in April. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is just the latest example of this theory.\n\nAs a TGR Learning Lab member, I had the honor of attending the 2024 Genesis Invitational, hosted by Tiger Woods. It was a time of opportunity, and I’m very thankful to represent the programs TGR Foundation has to offer. I first attended in 2019 and was extremely delighted to have been invited back. It felt like a reunion. I went with other TGR Learning Lab members to experience the tournament as spectators, take a glimpse behind the scenes, and explore possible careers."
