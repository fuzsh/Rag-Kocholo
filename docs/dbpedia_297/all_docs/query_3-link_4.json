        "text": "Who wrote 'Against All Odds'?\n\nPhil Collins was approached to write the title song to the film Against All Odds while it was still in a \"rough cut form\".\n\nAt the time the soundtrack was being completed, Phil was still on tour with his band Genesis.\n\nDirector Taylor Hackford flew to Chicago to see one of the band's concerts. Later, Phil watched the movie on a videocassette recorder in his hotel room, and agreed to appear on the soundtrack.\n\nWhat was the film 'Against All Odds'?\n\nAgainst all Odds (1984) ORIGINAL TRAILER [HD 1080p]\n\nAgainst All Odds is a 1984 romantic neo-noir thriller film, and a remake of 1947's Out of the Past (1947).\n\nIt was directed by Taylor Hackford and starred Rachel Ward, Jeff Bridges and James Woods alongside Jane Greer (who had also starred in Out of the Past). The film revolves around an ageing American football star, who is hired by a mobster to find his girlfriend.\n\nThe film's soundtrack also featured songs from Phil's Genesis bandmates Peter Gabriel and Mike Rutherford.\n\n'Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)' appears in the movie during the closing credits.\n\nWhat was the song inspired by?\n\nOriginally titled 'How Can You Just Sit There?', the song was initially from Phil's sessions for his debut solo album Face Value in 1981.\n\nOn episode 339 of the podcast This American Life, Phil said that the song was inspired and written shortly after the split between him and his first wife. He said that the divorce transformed him from being a musician into also being a lyricist.\n\nHow big a hit was it at the time?\n\nPhil Collins \"Against All Odds\"\n\nThe song peaked at number two in the UK in 1984. In the US, it peaked at number one, and stayed there for three weeks. It was also the fifth best-selling single of 1984 in the States.\n\n'Against All Odds' won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male in 1985.\n\nIt was also nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe in the Best Original Song categories. At the Oscars, Phil was not invited to sing his song on stage, and instead sat in the audience as dancer Ann Reinking gave a lip-synced performance alongside a dance routine. Phil wasn't best pleased.\n\nPhil lost to the Stevie Wonder classic 'I Just Called to Say I Love You' at the 1985 Oscars.\n\nWho has covered 'Against All Odds'?\n\nMariah Carey - Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now) (Official HD Video) ft. Westlife\n\nMany artists have covered it, most notably Mariah Carey on her Rainbow album in 2000. She later released a second version as a duet with boyband Westlife in the same year, reaching number one in the UK.\n\nIn 2004, the very first winner of The X Factor, Steve Brookstein scored a number one with a cover version as his winner's single.\n\nOther covers include:\n\n- The Shadows\n\n- The Postal Service\n\n- Bonnie Tyler\n\n- Barry Manilow\n\n- Michael Ball"
