        "text": "The Bible speaks of “the four corners of the earth,” which is clearly not meant to be taken literally. Does this mean that the “days” of creation in Genesis 1 could be non-literal and figuratively representing millions of years?\n\nSometimes, we can only shake our heads and sigh when we see many great Christian scholars and theologians who are so careful and accurate in their handling of Scripture from Genesis 12 to Revelation 22, but are so shallow and less than careful in their thinking about Genesis 1-11.\n\nFor instance, consider Dr. J. P. Moreland. Qualified in philosophy, theology and chemistry, Dr. Moreland has written many books,1 and been published in a wide variety of journals.2 He served with Campus Crusade for 10 years, planted three churches, and has spoken on over 175 college campuses.3\n\nWe have great respect for Dr. Moreland. He is a brilliant scholar, an excellent writer and speaker, and unquestionably a sincere follower of Jesus Christ. He justly deserves the appreciation of the church for his many labors. We have learned much from his writings. But on the subject of the age of the earth, he does not display, in our opinion, the careful reflection that is so characteristic of his writings generally. It grieves us to have to disagree with Dr. Moreland. But we are compelled to write out of our love for the truth of Scripture and for the church, which we believe is being negatively influenced by his teachings regarding the age of the earth.\n\nAn article4 on the “Reasons to Believe”5 website publishes (with his approval) Dr. Moreland’s remarks on the age of the earth, which he made orally before a church in Washington State, USA, in February 2002. Dr. Moreland attempted to defend his belief that the days of creation were long periods of time. Sadly, his comments are very common within Christian circles today, even among scholars. Our purpose in focusing on Dr. Moreland is to show the way in which even well respected Christians use faulty reasoning to justify their rejection of the six literal days of creation only a few thousand years ago. We must remember that we all have feet of clay and all of us (the authors of this review article included) must sit under the judgment of the Word of God.\n\nWe wholeheartedly agree with Dr. Moreland when he states regarding the days of Genesis that “we ought not allow science to dictate to us our exegesis of the Old Testament.”6 But then he proceeds to do exactly that, without realizing that he is! Consider carefully his reasoning as he seeks to justify acceptance of millions of years and thus rejection of literal creation days.\n\nWhy wouldn’t the same reasoning imply that we’ll eventually have to reinterpret the virgin birth and the resurrection of Jesus?\n\nFirst, he says something similar to what we often stress: “The argument is that if you take the days of Genesis as not being six days and take them as maybe longer periods of time, then where do you draw the line ... why wouldn’t the same reasoning imply that we’ll eventually have to reinterpret the virgin birth and the resurrection of Jesus?” That’s a great question.\n\nAiG asks this because the major reason most Christian scholars do not accept six literal days is that they start from outside of Scripture by accepting what the scientific establishment says about millions of years and then proceed to use that “fact” to interpret the Hebrew word yom (translated “day” in Genesis 1) in a way that cannot be justified from the context of Scripture. This is not sound exegesis. Rather, it is using man’s fallible ideas (the supposed millions of years) to impose a meaning upon the text. Applying the same principles, one should also reinterpret the Resurrection and Virgin Birth as myths or allegories, since the same scientific establishment tells us that people do not rise from the dead, nor do virgins conceive. In fact, this is exactly how the evolutionist professor, Jerry Coyne (University of Chicago), thinks. This is how he ends a review of two recent books by theistic evolutionists trying to harmonize evolution and Christianity:\n\n“Why reject the story of creation and Noah's Ark because we know that animals evolved, but nevertheless accept the reality of the virgin birth and resurrection of Christ, which are equally at odds with science? After all, biological research suggests the impossibility of human females reproducing asexually, or of anyone reawakening three days after death. … Now Darwin Year is upon us, and we can expect more books like those by Kenneth Miller and Karl Giberson. Attempts to reconcile God and evolution keep rolling off the intellectual assembly line. It never stops, because the reconciliation never works.”7\n\nWithout mentioning this reasoning behind our claims, Dr. Moreland then proceeds to discuss biblical passages which speak of the “four corners of the earth” and say that the sun “rises” and “sets.”\n\n“I doubt, sir, that you or anybody else in the room takes the biblical passages that say that 'Jesus will call his angels from the four corners of the earth' to teach a flat Earth. I also doubt that anyone in here says that when the sun rises and sets it literally means an earth-centered universe. But you must understand that...there were times when the church interpreted the text that teached [sic] that God—Christ will call his angels from the four corners of the world to teach very obviously that the world has four corners. The text says that. There is absolutely no evidence in that text that it means anything other than four corners. You can read it until you're blue in the face, and it says that the Earth has four corners. Similarly, the Bible says the sun rises and sets. Now, that's what it says. You can dance around it all you want. That's what the text says. But there's nobody in here that believes that. No one in here believes the earth has four corners. And so, what we've done is taken that language and interpreted it metaphorically. Similarly, with the rising and the setting of the sun, we treat that...phenomenologically—we say that's the language of description; it is not meant to be taken literally.”\n\nThe Four Corners\n\nThere are several problems with Dr. Moreland’s line of reasoning about the shape of the earth.\n\nFirst, the phrase, “four corners of the earth,” appears in the New Testament only in Revelation 7:1 and 20:88 in descriptive statements by the Apostle John. Jesus speaks only of the “four winds of the earth” (Matthew 24:31 and Mark 13:27), as does John in Revelation 7:1.9 These are all the New Testament occurrences of these phrases. In the Old Testament “four corners of the earth” appears only in Isaiah 11:12. The same Hebrew words appear in Ezekiel 7:2 but are correctly translated as “four corners of the land” in the KJV, NKJV, NAS and NIV since the preceding words in the verse show that eretz (the Hebrew word that can be translated either as “earth” or “land,” depending on context) is referring to the land of Israel, not the whole planet, as is the case of Isaiah 11:12.\n\nSecond, we should note that all of the above passages are in prophetic, apocalyptic sections of Scripture, where (unlike Genesis) figurative language is frequently used. Therefore, a discerning reader will be careful about interpreting these phrases literally.10\n\nThird, given the biblical allusions to the earth’s sphericity in Job 26:10; Proverbs 8:27; Ecclesiastes 1:6; Psalm 19:6 and Isaiah 40:22 and the fact that the ancients long before the time of Christ had concluded that the earth is a sphere,11 there is no reason to imagine that Christ or his disciples actually thought the earth was flat and that the wind only blew in one of four directions.\n\nThe church never interpreted the “corners of the earth” to mean that the earth is flat.\n\nFourth, the church never interpreted the “corners of the earth” to mean that the earth is flat. It is a myth that the church ever believed in a flat earth. As historian Jeffrey Russell shows, that was the view of only a very few odd individuals scattered throughout the last twenty centuries.12 We use similar figures of speech today. If we say that something is scattered “to the four corners of the earth” we mean “all over the earth.” The convention has always been to talk of four directions, or four compass points—north, south, east and west. Neither we nor the ancients ever took this to mean that there are only four directions in which one can travel. In our modern world we still speak of the “four winds.”13\n\nFifth, these phrases are not worded as statements of literal geographical or atmospheric fact. In other words, neither in these verses nor in any other part of the Bible do we read statements like “the earth has four corners” or “there are only four winds that blow on the earth.”\n\nTherefore, Dr. Moreland is mistaken when he asserts that there is no exegetical reason14 to conclude that these verses are teaching anything other than that the earth has four corners. All careful readers would know instinctively that the phrases “four corners of the earth” and “four winds of the earth” are idioms, meaning “everywhere on the earth” or “from all directions.”15 In fact, Mark 13:27 shows that Jesus is not teaching geography or atmospheric science in that “from the four winds” is used as a parallel synonym for “from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven.” As Creator of heaven and earth, Jesus knew the shape of the earth and the heaven and He always spoke the truth, though He sometimes spoke truth in non-literal language, as we all do.\n\nThus, contrary to what Dr. Moreland has stated, the term “corners” is easily understood to have a non-literal meaning as a result of sound exegesis, without using scientific evidence external to Scripture.\n\nSunrise and sunset\n\nRegarding the issue of the movement of the sun and the earth, Dr. Moreland’s objection (which has been used against young-earth creationist arguments by others before him for almost 200 years) fails. The statements about the movement of the sun and earth are literal in a phenomenological sense, as he points out. In other words, a phenomenon is described from the viewpoint of the observer. We do the same thing today as we (even evolutionists) speak in everyday discourse about the sun rising and setting, even though we know much more about how the solar system works.16\n\nThe Bible’s statement that the sun “rises” is consistent with either a geocentric or heliocentric view of the solar system. Scientific evidence has enabled us to distinguish which of these two is actually a correct understanding of the solar system, but it has not in the slightest changed our understanding of the meaning of the actual words of the Bible. For there to be a true parallel (as claimed by Dr. Moreland and others) with the issue of the creation days, one would have to show that the use of the word “day” in Genesis is intrinsically consistent with either a long age or an ordinary day. But young-earth creationists have demonstrated repeatedly over the last 200 years that the Genesis text simply does not permit the “long-age” option, whereas the “sun rising” texts do not clearly teach geocentricism and therefore permit a heliocentric option.\n\nFurthermore, these statements about the sun and moon moving are very incidental and brief statements. We have very little in the text to go on to know how to interpret these phrases or sentences, and most of the references are in the poetic literature, where we should be on the alert for non-literal language. Finally, as with the phrases like “corners of the earth,” we do not find an explicit statement in the Bible such as “the earth does not move and the sun and stars go around the earth,” which could easily have been said in just such simple language.\n\nContrast these brief statements about the earth-sun relationship with the lengthy accounts of Creation Week and the Flood in Genesis. Here we have whole chapters which in various ways emphasize that God made the initial creation complete in six literal days (about 6,000 years ago, as the genealogies in Genesis 5 and 11 indicate17) and that He judged the world with a global catastrophic Flood at the time of Noah. The only way to deny this is to fail to pay careful attention to the text of Genesis 1–11 and to ignore the passages in the rest of the Bible that show that Jesus and the biblical writers took these chapters as literal history.18 Jesus clearly shows Himself to be a young-earth creationist in Mark 10:6, Luke 11:50–51 and elsewhere. In these passages he states that Adam and Eve and their son Abel were at the beginning of creation, not billions of years after the beginning (as would be the case if the earth is truly billions of years old). There simply is no real comparison between the brief and less than clear verses about the movement of the sun and the lengthy and clear passages about Creation and the Flood.\n\nDr. Moreland continues in his argument as follows:\n\n“So then, suppose that you believe that...those texts do not teach that there are four corners and that the sun rises and sets? Are you now going to deny the virgin birth? Are you going to give up the resurrection? No, of course not. So, the point is...that the general argument from adopting a certain view of one text, there's no way to block the slide to doing that to other texts, is an example in philosophy of what is called hasty generalization; it makes a generalization based upon a slim sampling of evidence. The fact of the matter is that when you interpret biblical texts, you've got to take each one at its own merits and you've got to do the very best you can to handle that text by itself. And so from the fact that one particular text is handled in some way, it does not follow that...other texts will need to be handled in any way whatsoever, unless you can show that there's a clear parallel in the way that the two texts are being handled.”\n\nYoung-earth creationists do not endorse “the general argument” that “from adopting a certain view of one text, there's no way to block the slide to doing that to other texts” Given his expertise in philosophy, it is surprising to see Dr. Moreland using a straw-man argument, attacking a position that misrepresents what we believe. What we say is that the whole Bible gives overwhelming evidence that Genesis 1–11 is historical narrative, even though it describes unusual and miraculous events, just as Matthew 1–2 and 26–28 are historical narrative passages describing unusual and miraculous events. There is a very clear parallel between these passages. It is therefore exegetically inconsistent to interpret the latter passages as literal straightforward history but not the former.\n\nFurthermore, historically speaking, in the church the rejection of the literal truth of Genesis preceded (and hermeneutically laid the groundwork for) the rejection of the literal truth of the Virgin Birth and Resurrection of Christ. By and large, people have abandoned belief in Genesis 1–11, before they abandoned belief in the Gospels. So young-earth creationists are not the ones guilty of a hasty generalization. Dr. Moreland is, too. Young-earth creationists do not take, and never have taken, every word or verse in the Bible literally, contrary to what many of our critics charge. We have always recognized that there are idioms, parables and other figurative, symbolic phrases or sections of Scripture. What we contend is that Genesis 1–11 is not one of those sections. It is sober, true and inerrant history.\n\nDr. Moreland continues:\n\n“Now, when it comes to the...flat earth and the rising and the setting of the sun: it was scientific evidence that caused people to say ‘maybe we'd better re-look at those passages.’ There was nothing exegetically or strictly in the Hebrew grammar and syntax. There was absolutely nothing about the literary genre of the passage or the historical-grammatical method of interpretation that could tell you anything at all about one way or the other—it was scientific evidence. So now the question was raised by the church interpreters: 'Is there anything essential to this passage that's violated if we take the four corners of the earth to be metaphorical?' Now, their answer was, in that particular passage, 'no.' That particular text can allow for that without violating the teachings of the scriptures in that particular text. Now, is this procedure risky in other passages? You bet. But does it follow that it should never be applied? No, you've gotta take texts—each text, on its own. So, the devil's in the details, and you've got to be very, very careful.”\n\nScientific evidence did not lead the church to reject the idea of a flat earth, for the simple fact that, as already mentioned, it never believed this. Scientific evidence at the time of Galileo and later did cause people to re-examine the Scriptures. And they concluded that the relevant texts did not explicitly teach that the sun literally goes around a stationary earth, but only appeared to do so as seen from earth. So they reasoned that the Bible could be legitimately interpreted in such a way as to harmonize it with the Copernican theory (and the later revised version19), without doing violence to the text.\n\nIn contrast, despite the best and most ingenious efforts of Christian scholars over the past 200 years, Christians have not been able to show how Genesis can be reinterpreted to make it harmonize with the evolutionary idea of millions of years. The gap theory, day-age theory, day-gap-day theory, framework hypothesis and many other lesser-known reinterpretations of Genesis have all failed when examined carefully with an open Bible.20 One of the biggest problems that all these interpretations face, but generally ignore, is the contradiction between the Bible’s teaching that death came after the Fall and the evolutionists’ claim that millions of years of death, violence, disease and extinction preceded the appearance of man on the earth by millions of years. Contrary to what Dr. Moreland says, in this case and many others, the devil is not in the details, he is in the superficial analyses of the Word of God. The Lord is in the details, because every word of Scripture is inspired by God. But what about those godly scholars who are not young-earth creationists? More about this follows.\n\nThe Days of Genesis One\n\nDr. Moreland continues:\n\n“Now, when it comes to the days of Genesis...I'm of the view on this that while we ought not allow science to dictate to us our exegesis of the Old Testament, nevertheless, if there is an interpretation of the Old Testament that is exegetically permissible—that is, an old age interpretation; that is to say, if you can find conservative, inerrantist, evangelical Old Testament scholars that say that the interpretation of this text that treats the days of Genesis as unspecified periods of time, and that is completely permissible thing to do on exegetical grounds alone, then my view is that that is a permissible option if it harmonizes the text with science because that option can be justified exegetically, independent of science.”\n\nDr. Moreland is doing precisely what he says we ought not to do—allowing science to dictate to us our exegesis of the Old Testament. But the question is not whether an interpretation is exegetically permissible in the opinion of some conservative, inerrantist, evangelical OT scholars, but whether it is exegetically probable and defensible.\n\nFurthermore, truth is not determined by majority vote, as Dr. Moreland knows. The fact that most contemporary conservative evangelical OT scholars are not young-earth creationists means nothing. They are a minority in church history.21 More important is the fact that these contemporary conservative scholars, who are justly respected for their many helpful contributions to the church, do not hold to their old-earth views because of exegetical considerations but because they have surrendered the authority of Scripture to what they have been led to believe is incontrovertible science evidence for believing in millions of years. Many quotes could be given to support this claim, but we will cite just a few, first by Dr. James Boice and then by Dr. Meredith Kline, both respected Bible scholars.\n\n“We have to admit here that the exegetical basis of the creationists is strong. ... In spite of the careful biblical and scientific research that has accumulated in support of the creationists’ view, there are problems that make the theory wrong to most (including many evangelical) scientists. … Data from various disciplines point to a very old earth and an even older universe ...”22\n\n“In this article I have advocated an interpretation of biblical cosmogony according to which Scripture is open to the current scientific view of a very old universe and, in that respect, does not discountenance the theory of the evolutionary origin of man.”23\n\nAnother distinguished scholar, Dr. Wayne Grudem, is more guarded in his statements and certainly feels the force of the exegetical arguments for the young-earth view. But he clearly indicates that it is the “apparently overwhelming” scientific evidence for millions of years that is the deciding factor in his resistance to the young-earth view.24 Many other examples could be cited.\n\nDr. Moreland says that an old-earth interpretation “is a permissible option if it harmonizes the text with science because that option can be justified exegetically, independent of science.” No such old-earth interpretation exists. They all ignore at least some of the details in Genesis 1 and Exodus 20:8–11 that show overwhelmingly that these were literal days of creation. They all ignore the theological problem of millions of years of death before the Fall and (knowingly or unconsciously) reduce the Curse in Genesis 3 to nothing more than a spiritual consequence affecting man alone. These old-earth views all ignore the clear testimony of Jesus and the apostles that they were young-earth creationists, as already noted. Furthermore, most old-earth proponents deny that Noah’s Flood was global and catastrophic. If they do believe that it was global, they fail to realize that it had to have left a massive amount of geological evidence worldwide (exactly like what we see in the geological/fossil record), The year-long Genesis Flood could not have occurred as the Bible describes it and left no lasting evidence. But evolutionary geologists deny that the global Flood ever occurred and instead attribute those same fossils and rock layers to processes happening over millions of years. In other words, in spite of their godly sincerity, these evangelical scholars fail to realize that it is logically inconsistent to believe in both a global, catastrophic Noachian Flood and millions of years. The geological evidence for one view means that there is no geological evidence for the other view. They are mutually exclusive. The Flood is crucial to the matter of the age of the earth, but it is ignored, underrated, or rejected by old-earth proponents.\n\nNone of these old-earth reinterpretations is “justified exegetically, independent of science” but rather are classic examples of eisegesis (reading into the text what we want it to say), whereby evolutionary, millions-of-years hypotheses and assumptions (not “science”) are used to make the text say what it simply does not say.\n\nHebrew Exegesis\n\nDr. Moreland continues:\n\n“Now...I'm not a Hebrew exegete. But I will tell you that two of the best-known exegetes of the Old Testament in the American evangelical community are Gleason Archer at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and Walter Kaiser at Gordon-Conwell. Walter Kaiser and Gleason Archer are respected in the entire United States as being faithful expositors of the Old Testament. Both of them know eight to ten Old Testament languages, and they both have spent their entire lives in Hebrew exegesis. Both of them believe the days of Genesis are...vast, unspecified periods of time, and are in no way required to be literal twenty-four hour days.”\n\nWe are not Hebrew scholars, either. But in this case it does not matter. There are many evangelical scholars (though admittedly they are now in a minority) who know Hebrew and faithfully expound Scripture every bit as well as any old-earth creationists do but who hold to the young-earth view.25 Additionally, there are non-evangelical scholars who know Hebrew (and other relevant ancient Near Eastern languages) as well or better than evangelicals. These liberal scholars say that the biblical text is indeed teaching young-earth creationism, but because they are thorough-going evolutionists, they do not believe what they say the text plainly teaches. James Barr, Regius Professor of Old Testament at Oxford University (at the time of this statement) and a theological liberal, stated not long ago,\n\n“So far as I know there is no professor of Hebrew or Old Testament at any world-class university who does not believe that the writer(s) of Genesis 1 through 11 intended to convey to their readers the ideas that (a) creation took place in a series of six days which were the same as the days of 24 hours we now experience; (b) the figures contained in the Genesis genealogies provided by simple addition a chronology from the beginning of the world up to later stages in the Biblical story; (c) Noah's flood was understood to be world-wide and extinguished all human and animal life except for those in the ark.”26\n\nThe issue therefore is not beyond the reach of people who only know English. It certainly does not matter how many ancient Near Eastern languages someone knows. The Biblical text of Genesis 1–11 can be rightly understood without these, evidenced by the fact that neither Dr. Archer nor Dr. Kaiser (nor any other evangelical old-earth creationist) uses other languages to defend his old-earth interpretations of Genesis. Like Drs. Boice, Kline and Grudem above, Dr. Archer reveals what is ultimately driving his interpretation of Genesis:\n\n“From a superficial reading of Genesis 1, the impression would seem to be that the entire creative process took place in six twenty-four-hour days. If this was the true intent of the Hebrew author ... this seems to run counter to modern scientific research, which indicates that the planet Earth was created several billion years ago ...”27\n\nThe Sixth Day Too Short?\n\nDr. Kaiser holds to the day-age interpretation of Genesis 1 because he thinks too much happened on the sixth day to fit into 24 hours.28 Presumably, he would defend this view in a way similar to Dr. Archer, his former colleague at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.29 Though not explicitly stated, it is most certain that what is really driving Dr. Kaiser’s interpretation is the same thing influencing Drs. Archer, Grudem, Kline, Boice, etc.: the supposed scientific proof of millions of years.30\n\nDr. Kaiser does not explain why the events of the sixth day could not have happened in 24 hours, so let us briefly consider Dr. Archer’s arguments on this point. They have nothing to do with Hebrew (or any associated ancient Near-Eastern languages he knows). In fact, his arguments do not even pay careful attention to the English biblical text.\n\nLet us first list all the events of the sixth day, according to Genesis 1–2.\n\nGod created every kind of land animal and creeping thing.\n\nGod created Adam.\n\nGod created the Garden of Eden\n\nGod commanded Adam to care for it.\n\nAdam named some land animals and birds.\n\nGod realized that Adam was alone.\n\nGod put Adam to sleep.\n\nGod made Eve.\n\nAdam met Eve and said a short romantic poem.\n\nNow, how long did the above nine events take? The Bible gives us no specific amount of time for any of them. Clearly, events 4, 6, and 9 took less than a minute total. However, there is no biblical or theological reason to think any of the other events took very long either. God’s creative acts were miraculous and therefore, as with all the other miracles in the Bible, we should assume they were instantaneous.\n\nWe should add here that, contrary to what both Drs. Archer and Kaiser say, the Bible does not say that Adam grew lonely or felt that he needed a companion. The Bible says that God saw that Adam was alone (which took no time at all for God to see) and so made a helper for him. This highlights the fact that correct interpretation must be based on careful observation of what the Bible actually says, not on imagining what it says. Sadly, Dr. Archer fails to observe the text carefully at many points in Genesis 1-2, or he reads into the text what is not there.\n\nWhat about Adam’s activities? Dr. Archer says that Eden was a “large park area,” the care of which would have been “arduous” and would have gone on “for a fairly extended period of time.”31 But there is no basis in the text for this statement. The Bible does not tell us how large the garden was or even that it was “large.” It does not tell us how long Adam cared for the garden (or how hard he worked) before he started naming animals or even that it was “a long time.” Dr. Archer only imagines these things. But this is not careful Bible study. From the text there is no basis for thinking that any more than a few moments at most elapsed between God’s command to care for the garden (Genesis 2:16–17) and God’s assignment for Adam to name animals and birds (Genesis 2:18–20).\n\nUnlike Linnaeus, Adam did not name any plants, or any sea creatures...or any creeping things, or any “beasts of the earth.”\n\nDr. Archer then asserts, without any basis in the text, that Adam gave “official and permanent” names in a “major project of taxonomy” akin to Linnaeus taking 30 years to give double Latin names to all the fauna and flora known to 18th-century scholarship.32 The Bible, on the other hand, says no such things. It says that Adam named only cattle, birds and “beasts of the field” (Genesis 2:19–20). Unlike Linnaeus, Adam did not name any plants, or any sea creatures (which make up the majority of living species), or any creeping things, or any “beasts of the earth” (cf. Genesis 1:25 and 2:19–20). The assumption that Adam was naming only animals that would be domesticated is far more reasonable and biblically based than Dr. Archer’s assumptions. The Bible says nothing about “official and permanent” names or “species” names or careful anatomical analysis of each creature before naming, as Dr. Archer assumes. Sadly, he is doing the kind of eisegesis that he would have never tolerated if one of us (Terry) had done it in one of his seminary classes. For all we know from the biblical text, the names Adam gave could have been names like dog, cow, giraffe, elephant, etc., which have nothing to do with the physical appearance of the animals. At the leisurely pace of five creatures per minute, Adam could have named 3,000 kinds of animals and birds in 10 hours of pleasant work, and he could have done so lying down while he nibbled on fruit.33 Furthermore, the Bible does not give a specific number of creatures named; it doesn’t even say something like “a large number.” We need not think, as Dr. Archer suggests, that Adam would have needed to be “spitting out specie’s [sic] names faster than the mind could think” to accomplish the task in less than 24 hours.34\n\nBefore commenting on Eve’s creation we hope our readers see the unacceptability of Dr. Archer’s statement that “it is fair to assume that no more than on hour or two would have been left toward the close of the sixth day for the introduction of Eve upon the scene.”35 It is not fair to assume that at all! He adds that there is no suggestion in the text that Adam’s divinely-induced nap and Eve’s supernatural creation took a short time. On the contrary, God didn’t need a long time to perform these miracles, and there is nothing in the text to lead us to think that these acts took any more that a few seconds or minutes. Archer’s statement on this matter is absolutely incredible (and insulting to God’s creative power and the clear testimony of His Word). He wrote,\n\n“There is no suggestion that this deep sleep was very suddenly induced or very quickly brought to its determination by the removal of the rib within a few seconds. And yet this kind of speed would have been absolutely essential if Adam and God had been working on a very limited time frame while the sun was fast approaching the horizon at the end of the sixth twenty-four hour day.”36\n\nWhen one of the present authors (Terry) was a teenager, his dentist put him to sleep in less than 10 seconds and removed his four wisdom teeth in less than 20 minutes! What is Dr. Archer thinking about here?\n\nAgain, please note that Dr. Archer’s (and Dr. Kaiser’s) arguments for the day-age theory have nothing to do with Hebrew or any other ancient language. It is sad indeed to see the apparent lack of careful attention to even the English Bible that the gifted scholar Dr. Moreland displays in his respect for these shallow, old-earth interpretations of Drs. Archer and Kaiser.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDr. Moreland concludes:\n\n“Now...my view, then, is this: if all of the Old Testament scholars at our seminaries that I trust, that love the Bible and that I respect their credibility were saying that it's required of us to believe these days are twenty-four hour days, I'd have a problem. But if there is enough of these men that I trust—I'm not talking about people that are trying to give up real estate here and are just bellying up; I'm talking about men that the community recognizes to be trustworthy authorities of that Hebrew exegesis are saying that this is an option—then I'm going to say in that case it's permissible. So that would be my basic response.”\n\nHere is the bottom line. Dr. Moreland sees the majority of modern evangelical OT scholars as the final authority. He refers to Archer and Kaiser “two of the best-known exegetes of the Old Testament in the American evangelical community” (which they are), who both believe the Genesis days to be “vast, unspecified periods of time.” They say so. Therefore it must be true. End of discussion. Really?\n\nDr. Moreland’s reliance on human authority is not unique. The Bible itself is not the final authority for most Christians today. Too many Christians are failing to carefully examine the old-earth arguments with an open Bible and to consider the careful analyses of those arguments by young-earth scholars. All scholars are only generally trustworthy at best. None alone or together are beyond question. We all have feet of clay, ourselves included. Whether scholar or uneducated laborer, we must all be like the Berean Jews, whom Luke commended as an example for us, because they examined the Scriptures carefully to see if the teachings of Paul were biblical (Acts 17:11).\n\nFurthermore, neither we nor any other young-earth creationist we know is accusing old-earth scholars of evil motives. People can be sincerely wrong—the present authors have been many times in our lives, which is why we listen carefully to others when they point out errors we have made and then we take steps to change what we can. There are godly evangelical scholars on both sides of the debates about the roles of men and women, spiritual gifts, the proper form of church government, Calvinism vs Arminianism, the millennium and tribulation, etc., etc. In every case, some godly, scholarly people must be wrong in their views and others must be right. We cannot escape this unpleasant conclusion that godly scholars, even the majority at a particular time in history, can be wrong on an important point of biblical teaching. So let us press on to know the Word of God, submitting to its supreme authority in every area of our thinking, speaking and behavior.\n\nGod said through the prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 66:1–2):\n\n“Thus says the Lord, ‘Heaven is My throne and the earth is My footstool. Where then is a house you could build for Me? And where is a place that I may rest? For My hand made all these things, thus all these things came into being,’ declares the Lord. ‘But to this one I will look, to him who is humble and contrite of spirit, and who trembles at My word’.”\n\nThe problem is that over the past 200 years most scholars, pastors, students and lay people in the Church have trembled at the words of men (whether secular evolutionists or sincere but mistaken Christian leaders and scholars) and used those human ideas to reinterpret God’s plain Word. Sadly, Dr. Moreland, like 90% of the 100 conservative evangelical seminary professors and Christian leaders involved in the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy,37 has uncritically accepted what some respected OT scholars have said. And many Christians will in turn uncritically accept what the Dr. Moreland has said in this article, which then will cause them to uncritically accept the many unbiblical ideas propagated on Dr. Ross’s Reasons to Believe website.38 So, human authorities are honored above the clear teaching of Scripture. Most Christians trust the proclamations of brilliant, godly, old-earth scholars instead of reading their Bibles carefully. They also forget the example of the godly and sincere Apostle Peter, who was “condemned” by the Apostle Paul for his “hypocrisy,” “fear” of man and not being “straightforward about the truth of the gospel,” which caused Peter to unintentionally and unconsciously undermine the gospel that he loved and preached (Galatians 2:1–14).39\n\nSummary\n\nGenesis 1–11 is not written using metaphorical nor phenomenological language. It is written as historical narrative, and, as such, each word should be examined carefully in context, according to the rules of Hebrew grammar. The interpretation we derive from such study should then be checked by examining other Scriptural passages that comment on these chapters. When we do this (as young-earth creationists have done for years), it is inescapably clear that the creation days were literal (just like our 24-hour days today), occurred only a few thousand years ago, and were followed by a global geologically catastrophic Flood at the time of Noah.\n\nFar from doing careful exegesis of the relevant Scriptures, Dr. Moreland has attempted to justify his rejection of six ordinary days of creation for one simple reason; because the majority of the scientists of this age, along with the majority of Bible scholars (who uncritically follow the scientific majority) believe the earth is billions of years old.\n\nAnd why does this matter? Well, if we start our thinking outside of Scripture, using man’s fallible (and often mistaken) interpretations of the physical creation (which are erroneously called “science”) to interpret what the clear Word of God means, we have a huge problem. Using this method of interpreting the Bible, there is absolutely no logical reason not to apply this method when studying the accounts of Jesus’ resurrection and virgin birth, and other miracles recorded in Scripture. In fact, on precisely this basis many theologians and lay people and students have made the ultimate slide into unbelief concerning the central doctrines of the Christian faith.\n\nListen to the words of Charles Templeton, who back in the 1940s was considered by many to be a more powerful evangelist than his contemporary and friend, Billy Graham. In the late 40s he went to Princeton Seminary, where his professors taught him that he should accept the scientific claims about evolution and millions of years and treat Genesis 1–11 as mythology. Shortly after leaving seminary with his faith in tatters, he left the ministry and soon became an atheist. Only a few years before his death he penned these words:\n\n“I believe that there is no supreme being with human attributes—no God in the biblical sense—but that life is the result of timeless evolutionary forces, having reached its present transient state over millions of years.”40\n\nNo, creationists are not cornered. But Christian scholars like Drs. Archer, Kaiser and Moreland need to “turn a corner” in their thinking and trust and defend the truths of God’s infallible, authoritative Word instead bowing the knee to secular scientists’ fallible opinions and theories that contradict that Word.41"
