        "text": "Better than: A surprising number of more expensive cars.\n\nBut not as good as: The Genesis Coupe will be (for us, anyway).\n\nGRM Bang For The Buck Index: 85.69\n\nFor many years, Korean manufacturer Hyundai has been offering models that are essentially bargain-bin versions of popular Japanese cars like the Camry, Civic and RAV4. To bolster consumer confidence, they introduced their famous 10-year, 100,000-mile warranty, and with each generation Hyundai has been improving quality while undercutting the big dogs. The new Hyundai Genesis Sedan builds on that momentum by taking a very serious swipe at the likes of Lexus and BMW.\n\nThe Genesis is available with a 290-horsepower V6 or a 375-horsepower V8--we drove the V6 model. Hyundai's Genesis targets the market for cars like the Lexus GS, Inifniti M, Pontiac G8, and BMW 5 Series. For the record, a V8 BMW 550i starts at $60,400; the V8 Genesis, with 15 more horsepower than the V8 BMW, starts at $22,000 less. The V6 Genesis starts at $32,250; compare that to $44,850 for a Lexus GS.\n\nForty-five grand is no paltry sum to spend on a Hyundai, but even the V6 Genesis comes with all the goodies you'd expect in a luxury sedan, like leather seats (heated up front) and a six-speed automatic. The Genesis we drove had an upgrade package with 18-inch wheels, a 14-speaker Lexicon sound system, and a moonroof. The GRM staff was genuinely impressed by the fit, finish, power and composure of this big sedan. While we're much more interested in the upcoming Genesis Coupe--it'll be based on the same basic RWD platform--any of our readers shopping for a luxury sedan should really give the Genesis a try before making a final decision.\n\nOther staff views\n\nDavid S. Wallens\n\nEditorial Director\n\nThat was the V6? Wow, can't wait for the V8. I only drove the Hyundai a little bit, but if first impressions mean much then Hyundai did a swell job. I was mainly a passenger in this one, and I can say that the back seat is very nice. Looks like Hyundai has been studying Toyota.\n\nJoin Free Join our community to easily find more articles.\n\nComments\n\nDisplaying 1-8 of 8 commentsView all comments on the GRM forums"
