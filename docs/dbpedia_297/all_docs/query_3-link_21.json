        "text": "Collins cannibalised an unpublished song to make Against All Odds. Although the main melody had been written (with different lyrics), Collins hadn't included it on any of his albums and it's not really clear whether the song was even in a fit state to be added to anything.\n\nWe're told that he worked with the Arif Mardin to complete the score (including adding entirely new orchestral parts), as well as writing new lyrics to fit in with the events of the film.\n\nOriginally titled \"How Can You Just Sit There?\", the song's music was written by Collins during sessions for his debut solo album Face Value (1981), but it fell by the wayside as it was his least favourite of the several ballads he wrote at the time. Neither was it included on Hello, I Must Be Going!, as many newer songs were written for it. Eventually, Collins presented the demo to Taylor Hackford when approached to write a song for the Against All Odds movie, which he loved. Then Collins penned the lyrics, which were for the film. Due to lack of time available (as he was on tour with Genesis), he had arranger Arif Mardin produce it, and they worked on it over two days. The piano performance is by New York musician Rob Mounsey. Piano, keyboard bass and a string section arranged and conducted by Mardin were recorded at RCA Studios, New York, while Collins recorded vocals and drums in Los Angeles.\n\nPer Wikipedia\n\nThe rules for the 92nd Academy Awards state that a song is eligible if it hasn't been commercially exploited and that it must have been worked on in conjunction with the filmmakers. I think we can reasonably assume that the rules for the 57th Award would be much the same.\n\nA. The work must be created specifically for the eligible feature-length motion picture. - Check\n\nB. The work must be the result of a creative interaction between the filmmaker(s) and the composer(s) and/or songwriter(s) who have been engaged to work directly on the motion picture. - Check\n\nC. The work must be recorded for use in the motion picture prior to any other usage, including public performance or exploitation through any media whatsoever. - Check"
