        "text": "You may know Phil Collins as a solo pop artist, drummer and vocalist of Genesis, Disney soundtrack guru, session drummer, or all of the above.\n\nMaybe his name rings a bell because he created the most air-drummed fill of all time (you know the one).\n\nIf you don’t know Phil Collins, you definitely need to watch this video.\n\nDuring his decades-long career, he developed a signature drumming sound that featured unique approaches to different time signatures, melodic grooves, and a groundbreaking hybrid style with electronic pads.\n\nWhile he’s no longer playing drums these days due to health concerns, he made his mark on the drumming world and set the stage for generations to come.\n\nPhil Collins’ early life\n\nPhil Collins was born in London on January 30, 1951. He was given a toy drum set for a Christmas present, and played along to records starting at age six.\n\nHis first true love was The Beatles, but as he (and his drum set) grew, The Who – and lesser known London mods The Action – became major influences and he’d often watch their shows at London’s famous Marquee Club.\n\nAlthough Collins initially taught himself by ear, as a teenager he studied reading and rudiments with teacher Lloyd Ryan and then later Frank King. In a 1979 Modern Drummer interview, he said he found rudiments “very, very helpful – much more helpful than anything else because they’re used all the time”.\n\nCollins’ first gig wasn’t on the drums, though. As a kid, he’d attended stage school and landed the part of The Artful Dodger in the West End production of Oliver! While starring in the show, he got to know the drummer and bandleader, which turned him onto the idea of becoming a pro drummer.\n\nHow did Phil Collins join Genesis?\n\nIn 1969, Collins landed a gig in British rock band Flaming Youth. They released a concept album, Ark 2, on Fontana Records. A critically well-received record but not much of a success beyond that, the band split up in 1970.\n\nThat same year, Collins replied to an ad in British music magazine Melody Maker, which led to an audition for Genesis.\n\nIt was held at singer Peter Gabriel’s parents’ house, which had a swimming pool. Since Collins arrived early, the band suggested he take a swim while they auditioned the other drummers. While doing so, he listened and learned the songs.\n\n(Remember, this is 1970 before it was easy to make and email a demo!)\n\nAlready comfortable with the parts when he sat at the kit, Collins nailed the audition and got the job.\n\nOver the next five years, Collins established himself as one of the best drummers around, tastefully driving Genesis forward as the band became more successful and pushed musical boundaries.\n\nHe navigated elaborate song structures and complicated time signatures with a technical ability that inspired a generation of great drummers with albums Nursery Crime, Selling England by the Pound and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.\n\nIn 1975, Peter Gabriel left Genesis. After a long, unsuccessful audition process to try and find a replacement, it was decided that Collins would take over lead vocals.\n\nThe following album, A Trick of the Tail, was a critical and commercial hit. Bill Bruford of Yes and King Crimson played drums on tour while Collins sang (Bruford would later be replaced by Chester Thompson of Frank Zappa/Weather Report). This era marked a change from progressive rock to a more mainstream sound, and the band enjoyed the success that came with it.\n\nAround this time, Collins collaborated on various projects, including the solo albums of Peter Banks (Yes), Steve Hackett and Anthony Phillips, two records for Brian Eno, percussion with Thin Lizzy, and joined Brand X, where he recorded more brilliant parts in the jazz fusion band.\n\nPhil Collins’ solo success\n\nCollins launched his solo career with the album Face Value in 1981, featuring the iconic track “In The Air Tonight”. The album was a hit and would set the tone for a hugely successful career.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Collins became a household name with the album Hello, I Must Be Going! and producing records for Philip Bailey (Earth, Wind and Fire) and Eric Clapton. He wrote the movie theme song “Against All Odds”, which became a hit single.\n\nHis third album, No Jacket Required (1984), and the accompanying world tour established Collins as one of the biggest stars in the world. He recorded drums for the Band Aid single “Do They Know It’s Christmas?”, and this period also proved to be Genesis’ most successful, with the album Invisible Touch being the biggest seller of their career.\n\nIn 1985, two star-studded benefit concerts called Live Aid featured Phil Collins. The catch? They were both happening the same day on two different continents.\n\nCollins performed first at Wembley Stadium in London. He played solo piano versions of “In The Air Tonight” and “Against All Odds” and The Police song “Every Breath You Take” with Sting. He then crossed the Atlantic on a Concorde flight to perform with Eric Clapton and Led Zeppelin at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1996, Genesis announced that Collins had left the band via a funny press release: “Genesis end twenty-year experiment, decide to replace Peter Gabriel as vocalist.”\n\nThey reformed for a 40th anniversary tour in 2006.\n\nPhil Collins, Oscar winner\n\nOne of the biggest shows of the ’80s was Miami Vice, which famously used “In The Air Tonight” to kick off an episode. In a later season, Collins would play con artist “Phil the Shill” in a guest spot. He also played the lead role in Buster, a 1988 crime comedy based on The Great Train Robbery, which reached number 1 at the UK box office. The soundtrack included the hit singles “Groovy Kind of Love”, “Two Hearts”, and “Loco in Acapulco”.\n\nDisney recruited Collins to write the music for Tarzan, released in 1999. It was a shift in the traditional Disney storytelling because all of the songs were sung by Collins, not each character in the film. He recorded versions in Spanish, Italian, French, and German.\n\nDespite being initially nervous about the project, it was a box office smash, with the song “You’ll Be In My Heart” winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe and the soundtrack winning a Grammy.\n\nJazz, an autobiography, and touring with his son\n\nThe Phil Collins Big Band formed in the mid-90s, playing jazz standards and swing versions of Phil Collins and Genesis songs, with Collins playing drums in the style of Buddy Rich. They released a live album, and the band performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival with Quincy Jones conducting and Tony Bennett making a guest appearance on vocals. He also won Big Band Drummer of the Year in a 2000 Modern Drummer readers poll.\n\nIn 2016, Collins released his autobiography, Not Dead Yet, with a tour of the same name. Five nights at London’s Royal Albert Hall sold out in 15 seconds, and what was supposed to be a short run of shows in Europe turned into a world tour of 97 concerts! His son, Nic, played drums in his band and also for Genesis, who reconnected once more in 2020 on The Last Domino? Tour.\n\nWhat drums did Phil Collins play?\n\nPhil has played Gretsch drums since 1983, notably using concert toms – and lots of them! The iconic kit we’d all like to do “that fill” on is this black one:\n\nGretsch actually sells a signature kit with the same sizes, which are:\n\n8″ x 5.5″ concert tom\n\n10″ x 6.5″ concert tom\n\n12″ x 8″ concert tom\n\n15″ x 12″ concert tom\n\n16″ x 16″ concert tom\n\n18″ x 18″ concert tom\n\n20″ x 14″ bass drum\n\nHe also played a 14” x 4” Noble and Cooley snare and a variety of Sabian cymbals.\n\n5 reasons why Phil Collins was a drumming genius\n\nCollins has had a remarkable life. He’s done it all, from playing a toy kit to becoming a pioneering rock drummer, from being a child actor to writing Oscar-winning Disney soundtracks, 10-minute prog epics, and radio-friendly love songs. He has an incredible body of work that spans genres, industries, and generations.\n\nHere are five reasons why Phil Collins was a drumming genius:\n\n1. He wrote legendary drum fills\n\nPretty much everyone knows how to air drum along to his iconic drum break in “In The Air Tonight”. Could you imagine that song without it? This part also features his classic gated sound – a sound that was actually developed on Peter Gabriel’s song “Intruder” which Phil tracked on drums.\n\nFor another example of his legendary fills, listen to the intro of “Easy Lover” – a duet with Philip Bailey of Earth, Wind & Fire.\n\n2. He created a signature style\n\nPhil loved to keep a groove going on the ride or crash while moving around the kit with the other hand. Listen to “Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)” where he has triplets descending on the toms with one hand while the other keeps the beat going.\n\nYou’ll hear even more evidence of his signature style in “Dance On A Volcano” by Genesis and “Woman In Chains” by Tears For Fears.\n\n3. Complex time signatures were a breeze\n\nWatch the video above to appreciate Phil’s writing and artful touch on these parts. But if you want a list of key songs to check out, we’ll deliver:\n\n“Firth Of Fifth” by Genesis\n\n“The Cinema Show” by Genesis\n\n“Supper’s Ready” by Genesis\n\n“Turn It On Again” by Genesis\n\n“Robbery, Assault and Battery” by Genesis\n\n“Nuclear Burn” by Brand X\n\n“Watcher Of The Skies” by Genesis\n\n“Behind The Lines” by Genesis\n\n“I Don’t Care Anymore” by Phil Collins\n\n4. His technical ability was second to none\n\nHave you heard “Dancing With The Moonlit Knight” or “Los Endos” by Genesis, or “Kugelblitz” by Brand X?\n\nDo yourself a favor and listen to them right now.\n\nYou can also hear Phil’s amazing hand technique in Genesis songs like “The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway” and “Supper’s Ready” (listen for the press rolls) or “The Battle Of Epping Forest” (listen for his articulate rudimental rolls).\n\nOn top of that, “Supper’s Ready” and “The Musical Box” are full of precise bass drum playing and challenging syncopated patterns. Check them out!\n\n5. He played electronic drums before it was cool\n\nYou could argue that Phil Collins helped make electronic drums cool.\n\nCompared to Genesis’ earlier records, the drums sound pretty different on Invisible Touch and their 1983 self-titled album. By this time, Phil had integrated a Simmons electronic drum kit into his acoustic setup. When soloing, he’d sometimes reach over to play the electronic pads in between ripping it up on the traditional kit.\n\nListen to “Second Home By The Sea” for a good example. Or “Tonight, Tonight, Tonight”, where the second half of the song is stock sounds from the Simmons SDS7 module.\n\nThe double drumming on “The Brazilian” is another fun example. Phil would be on the electronic kit while fellow drummer Chester Thompson would play the acoustic.\n\nIf you weren’t already a fan of Phil Collins – or you only know him for his vocal talents – we hope you’ve gained new respect for him as a drummer. He’s truly one of a kind.\n\nWant to learn more about why legendary drummers are so legendary?
