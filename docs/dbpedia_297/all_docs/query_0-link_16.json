The present study uses the concept of “resilience” as a theoretical framework that can help us to answer it. It investigates various characteristics common to the students, families, and schools of Chile, and places emphasis on understanding resilience as it relates to the academic achievement of students with low SES.

        "text": "Background\n\nCurrent academic literature demonstrates that students of high socioeconomic status (SES) perform better academically than those of lower socioeconomic status (Dupriez and Dumay 2006; Schutz et al. 2007; Duarte et al. 2010). For Chile and the rest of Latin America, this is a particularly consistent trend and one that has been verified by numerous studies and international organizations.1 In fact, in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries, the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reveals that the SES of students’ families is the most important factor explaining reading level variances among 15-year-olds, with Chile, Belgium, Hungary, and Turkey as the four countries where this association is the strongest (OECD 2010).\n\nStudying the relationship between SES and learning is, in and of itself, a highly relevant subject that is widely addressed in research both in Chile and on an international level. However, the relationship is seldom decomposed or further analyzed to reveal deep-seeded theoretical elements that may drive the apparent effects. A more careful analysis of the relevant characteristics of students and families from fragile socioeconomic groups could thus lead to a better understanding of the SES-learning connection, and it can be enriched by incorporating the notion of “resilience,” or the ability to succeed under frankly negative circumstances, as a framework. Studies of socioeconomic vulnerability show that no group is homogeneous with regard to learning. Individuals who demonstrate outstanding academic achievement despite their low SES stand out. This phenomenon, which goes against the typically negative correlation between low SES and academic achievement, can be interpreted as a process of resilience.2 Therefore, identifying the driving factors behind the resilience found in high-achieving yet vulnerable students could serve as a key to breaking the negative trend caused by poverty and to better defining the policies that reduce the negative effects of socioeconomic vulnerability on educational achievement.\n\nWhat Is Resilience?\n\nResilience can be defined as a positive or constructive/dynamic reaction to a stressful, threatening, or catastrophic situation (Fluxá and Acosta 2009; Hanewald 2011; Cicchetti 2012). In psychological terms, resilience is indicated by relatively positive results despite a combination of negative experiences (Rutter 2006). Two major trends concerning resilience can be found in the literature. The first, which was common in the 1970s and 1980s, corresponds to the emerging stages of research on resilience. Definitions of resilience from this period tend to emphasize the idiosyncrasies and personalities of resilient people, thus identifying resilience as an innate trait of certain people (Werner 1996; Cyrulnick 2002). More recent or “second stage” literature stresses instead the fact that resilience can be developed in the course of life, whether or not it is inherited as an innate trait, and can therefore be considered a dynamic process.3\n\nFrom this perspective, interactions between opposing risk and protective factors are involved in the genesis and development of resilient reactions (Cappella and Weinstein 2001), and individual, family, and social determinants of both types of factors exist (Dyer and McGuinness 1996). On the one hand, risk factors increase the likelihood of negative responses to adverse situations. As the risk factors increase so too does the chance for negative responses. For example, living in poverty is a risk condition, and if this condition is compounded by other risk factors, such as the absence of a protective environment, violence at school, or health problems, then the chances for resilience will deteriorate (Catterall 1998). Moreover, belonging to a minority group or coming from a single-parent household are also considered risk factors given the suffering associated with racism and discrimination (Cappella and Weinstein 2001; Grotberg 2006).\n\nConversely, protective factors are those characteristics that strengthen resilience, promote it, or are necessary for it. Individual personalities and other psychological attributes might be protective factors (Fluxá and Acosta 2009), as well as the degree to which individuals interact with and respond to their human environment (Gordon Rouse 2001). Dyer and McGuinness (1996) also discuss a sense of self-determination and pro-social attitudes as critical attributes of resilient people, while Martin and Marsh (2006) propose a model called 5-C, which asserts that resilience depends on the following five factors: confidence (self-efficacy), coordination (planning), control, composure (low anxiety), and commitment (persistence). Positive factors related to the family environment include a warm atmosphere, parents who support and provide educational and social stimulation, and families who are positive role models and who have good relationships with peers. The literature also emphasizes that for resilience to develop, it is important for the student to have an influential adult who provides emotional support (Dyer and McGuinness 1996; Baruch and Stutman 2006). Protective factors at schools might include a positive and regulated environment as well as positive attitudes toward studying and discipline from other classmates (Cappella and Weinstein 2001). Tisseron (2009) emphasizes that a favorable, nonviolent environment together with high expectations and a sense of usefulness are key components that facilitate the development of resilience in educational centers. As part of their study of resilient communities, Suárez-Ojeda and Autler (2006) identify five pillars for overcoming trauma: collective self-esteem, cultural identity, humor, adequate governance, and spirituality.\n\nAs Kolar (2011) suggests, to explain a given phenomenon using the concept of resilience, it is first necessary to accurately define three elements—the risk condition, the resilience indicator (outcome), and the factors involved in the process. With regard to the resilience indicator, Masten and Obradovic (2008) distinguish the following three levels of resilience: (a) achievement levels above those expected for a particular at-risk group, (b) the ability to maintain normal performance despite adversity, and (c) the recovery of normal achievement levels after a traumatic event. The concept of resilience has been used to describe different educational phenomena, such as the adaptation of students who belong to ethnic or racial minorities, are victims of abuse, or have experienced traumatic situations in the school environment.\n\nAcademic resilience is a particular variety of educational resilience, for which a student’s academic performance in a particular subject is used as the relevant outcome indicator (Gordon Rouse 2001). From this perspective, one may find resilient students across different areas of knowledge, such as reading comprehension, math, the sciences, and so forth. In such cases, student resilience is defined as the interaction between normal, outstanding, or recovered academic performance and personal or environmental risk conditions (Masten and Obradovic 2008). In turn, risk is defined by the level of probability that any student has for academically underperforming in the presence of stress or trauma.\n\nReading Comprehension and Resilience\n\nJust as analyzing the relation between poverty and academic performance can be enriched by the concept of resilience and its contributing factors, so too can research on the topic be developed by better specifying the relationship between academic content and resilience. Reading comprehension—one of the specific areas of academic skill concerned—is assessed in the 2009 PISA test. The concept of “engaged reading” can help to bridge the gap between this content area and the topic of resilience, because it unites cognitive dimensions of the ability to noncognitive ones like student attitudes toward reading, the quantity and quality of the chosen books, the reading strategies employed, and metalinguistic skills (Baker et al. 1996). The concept of engaged reading highlights sometimes hidden factors in the process underlying the development of reading comprehension—a process that is complex and multidimensional (Guthrie and Wigfield 2000; Wigfield et al. 2008). As a consequence, in this study we will use categories of noncognitive psychological analysis to help probe the question of how academic resilience is generated in contexts of vulnerability.\n\nIt is important to note that the concept of reading engagement involves dimensions other than those represented in the PISA test (Taboada et al. 2009; Wolters et al. 2014). Nevertheless, enough elements are represented in PISA data to allow us to analyze key determinants of performance and resilience. These elements include attitudes toward reading, such as self-concept and motivation (Wigfield and Guthrie 1997),4 the variety of books read, and the capacity to talk about them. The first two components coincide with protective factors of resilience and, in this framework, are considered important determinants of success. The difference is that from the point of view of reading engagement, these factors and other aspects are conceived as connected and interdependent (Guthrie et al. 2007). As previously noted, protective factors are important in developing resilience and are also associated with attitudes, self-esteem, and motivation. As a consequence, examining the exact role that these factors play in reading comprehension, within the context of a risk environment such as poverty, becomes especially important.\n\nQuestions, Hypotheses, and Research Objectives\n\nThe literature on resilience and the literature on reading engagement lead to a common hypothesis: students with better reading performance in groups of low SES are likely to be characterized by more protective factors and a higher level of reading engagement. To this end, the present research denotes resilience by associating it with a specific academic scenario—normal performance in reading comprehension despite adversity. In this study we do not aim to reduce resilience to the singular context of poverty but apply it to a broader span of stresses. Indeed, resilience extends much further than poverty. By itself, poverty is simply a risk factor that implies lower academic performance, an assumption that gains at least face validity from the weaker 2009 PISA test results of students with low SES. PISA data provide a good basis for the study of poverty as a risk condition and resilience as a potential antidote, because they are nationally representative and incorporate rich background information concerning individual characteristics, schooling conditions, and reading engagement.\n\nThe current study tests how reading achievement is affected by the risk and protective factors related to academic resilience as well as the degree of reading engagement achieved. Our general objective is to determine which factors are associated with outstanding results obtained on the 2009 PISA Reading Test by students from low SES backgrounds. Specifically, this study seeks to identify, describe, and quantify resilient Chilean students and then determine the individual and institutional risk or protective factors most associated with resilience in reading comprehension. It is hoped that our attempt to understand this phenomenon in Chile will encourage further studies of the complex reality of those who live and are educated in highly vulnerable conditions and inherently risky developing country contexts.\n\nAdditionally, Chile constitutes a particularly interesting case for studies of academic resilience because it is one of the countries with the highest association between social conditions and academic performance, and the Chilean school system is one of the most socially segregated ones in the world (OECD 2010, 2013). This means that students normally attend schools where the majority of their classmates come from very similar socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds, a characteristic that is present from the first years of schooling and that lasts throughout the entire educational process for children and adolescents (Valenzuela et al. 2013). This situation produces a high level of inequality in educational services, where social origin acts as a prejudice and creates—for poor students in particular—significant barriers to quality education (OECD 2010).\n\nMethodology\n\nData and Subjects\n\nThe 2009 PISA results for Chile are used as a reference for the socioeconomic level of students by applying the PISA index for economic, social, and cultural status. This index is composed of variables that describe each student in regard to their home possessions (well-being, cultural possessions, and educational resources), the number of books at home, and the educational level of parents (OECD 2012). Applying this index, the sample group is divided into the following four socioeconomic levels: <25% (Q1), between 25% and 50% (Q2), between 50% and 75% (Q3), and >75% (Q4). From these groups, comparative models are developed.\n\nTwo suppositions form the basis for further analyses. The first of these is that the first quartile (Q1) represents the group with the lowest SES, as represented by the available information, and the second of these is that within this group, those students with scores equal or equivalent to the national average are resilient. While taking the average score as a reference point for defining resilient students is arbitrary in nature, it makes sense given that students from the lowest SES on average scored 40 points fewer than the national average (table 1). Using the national average as the reference point is both desirable and achievable; using more demanding criteria would limit the sample group to only those students with a higher reading capacity.

Thus, vulnerable students whose performances are equal to or greater than the national average (SCORE ≥ mean, ESCS ≤ 25%) are considered resilient. Possible determinants for factors of interest are identified and include three indexes from the assessment—occupational level of the parents, cultural possessions, and family wealth (OECD 2012; see the appendix). Moreover, three additional indexes, created specifically for this research are: reading enjoyment, classroom environment, and student-teacher relationship. Principal components analysis (PCA) is used for this purpose by taking the values of the first component (Cronbach alpha >.80 across the three indexes). In regard to school factors, variables are taken from the PISA database, and information from the Chilean Ministry of Education is used to define variables considered relevant but contained much missing data.\n\nAnalytical Strategy\n\nFirst, multilevel linear regression is used to estimate the relationship between students’ academic performance and its possible determinants across the socioeconomic distribution, and to identify the variables that are related to performance in the context of specific socioeconomic quartiles. A second level, “schools,” is added to the analytical model to examine the hierarchical structure of the educational system (Snijders and Bosker 1999; Rumberger and Palardy 2004; Bressoux 2008). The following three types of explanatory variables are included in the model: factors associated with resilience (protective and risk factors), factors linked to reading comprehension (individual engagement), and factors that characterize the educational system. The equality of the estimated coefficients across the socioeconomic quartiles is tested in each multilevel model; this is expected to validate the model of keeping the four groups separate. This is done by fitting a model for the whole sample including variables representing each quartile and their interactions with the explanatory factors. The statistical significance of the interaction terms are tested and reported in table A4.\n\nSecond, the analysis is focused on the bottom socioeconomic quartile, but this part examines whether resilient students are, on average, different from the other students. To do this, the difference between the mean of each variable for students in the first quartile (resilient and nonresilient) is compared with the means for students in the other quartiles, that is, Q2, Q3, and Q4. The Šídák post-test is employed to test the statistical significance of the mean differences across the quartiles.\n\nIn the third and final stage of the analysis, a logistic multilevel regression (Steele 2008) is implemented in order to explain the propensity of vulnerable students to be resilient, that is, the likelihood that they will obtain a score equal to or above the average on the PISA test. The resilience measure is as a categorical variable (with values of 1 or 0) in the statistical model; nonetheless, this approach is consistent with the idea that resilience/nonresilience is itself a continuous latent variable that is determined by a set of characteristics pertaining to the student, the family and the school (Long 1997). Throughout the stages of the analysis, the stratified sample design, sampling weights, and plausible values indicated in the PISA technical reports (OECD 2009, 2012) are taken into account. Missing values are omitted, however, which is why, starting with table 2, the number of observations and calculations differ from those reported by PISA.\n\nQ1Q2Q3Q41.

As shown in table 1, the average gain between the two years was 41 points, with students in the lowest two quartiles improving their scores the most, gaining about 48 points each as compared with gains of 36 and 31 points for Q3 and Q4, respectively.\n\nThe gains in test scores across the SES quartiles could be due to differences in the variables that determine performance. Estimating the multilevel linear regression model for each of the quartiles identifies the risk and protective factors that may explain reading comprehension. The results are presented in table 2.\n\nGlobally, the four models explained the variance in performance between schools but there was some difference among them. According to the null models in table A3, the model for Q1 has the smallest intraclass correlation (ICC; 32%), while Q4 has the largest ICC (39%). This finding suggests that the students in Q4 could have attended more segregated schools than the lower SES students or had a wider set of schools to choose from. Adding explanatory factors reduces the ICC by about the same degree across the quartiles, by close to 12%. The results indicate also that the proportion of the variance explained at the school level tends to increase somewhat with the student’s SES; for example, there is a difference of 3% between Q1 and Q4. On the other hand, the variance explained at the student level is not clearly related to the student’s SES: the smallest level 1 variance explained is for Q3 (10%), followed by Q1 (13%), Q4 (16%), and Q2 (20%). In turn, the intercept is smaller for Q3 and Q4, leaving less room for adding new determinants. These differences across the estimates for the four quartiles implies that the differentiation by quartiles is valid at least in aggregate terms. However, the Chi-square tests presented in table A4 show that only three of the estimated coefficients are significantly different. Nonetheless, these three coefficients correspond to key factors that support our theoretical model: parent education, reading enjoyment, and peer effect. Moreover, reading enjoyment and peer effect are significant determinants of test performance.\n\nThree determinants are statistically significant across all the quartiles, as shown in table 2: the presence of the mother at home, academic selection of students by schools, and peer effect (measured through the level of education obtained by classmates’ families). Reading enjoyment is statistically significant in three of the four sets of estimates, while the gender of the student, family size, whether the student lives in a single-parent household, class size, and the presence of school violence are significant in two out of four.\n\nThe results for academic selection range from 16.5 to 23.3 across the quartiles, but these estimates are not statistically different as revealed by the Chi-square test. The estimates for presence of the mother at home range from 29.8 to 44.5, while the coefficients for peer-effect range from 5.2 to 18.9. These estimates tend to be larger for Q3 and Q4. In addition, reading enjoyment also shows an increasing trend in relation to increased SES. The greater homogeneity of SES within the quartiles explains why the variables representing socioeconomic factors are not significant (i.e., socioeconomic status, cultural possessions, and parent education).\n\nThe other factors that are statistically significant tend to be significant mostly for the lowest quartile. When analyzing the model specific to Q1, there are six additional variables whose parameters are statistically significant. The first of these is gender, which indicates that in the lower SES groups girls tend to have an edge over boys when it comes to reading comprehension; we note that gender is also significant for Q2 but not for the higher quartiles. Mandatory reading has a negative effect on reading comprehension across all quartiles, but it is statistically significant only for Q1 and Q3. It is interesting to note that the proportion of students who reported only reading when required to do so is similar across the quartiles (Q1 = 0.335, Q2 = 0.365, Q3 = 0.338, and Q4 = 0.312). In contrast, a student’s preference for nonfiction increases with SES (Q1 = 0.394, Q2 = 0.416, Q3 = 0.457, and Q4 = 0.514), and this variable, which has a positive coefficient, is statistically significant for the lower two quartiles.\n\nOf the variables associated with the school, there are two that notably affect the low-SES students. The first of these is class size, which shows a positive correlation with higher reading comprehension. It is interesting that this variable specifically affects the Q1 group given that the average class size is similar in all groups (37 students per class). Finally, the perception of school violence is a particularly worrisome problem that is more specific to students of a lower SES who tend to be more exposed to and more aware of it (Q1 = 0.204, Q2 = 0.166, Q3 = 0.086, and Q4 = 0.049).\n\nThese comparisons across the quartiles indicate that the reading performance of low-SES students is affected by determinants specific to their socioeconomic group, both in the home and in the school. Their performance is affected by a total of 10 variables, as compared to seven for the highest quartile. This examination justifies focusing the posterior analyses on the Q1 students and validates the use of a resilience framework for understanding the relationship between SES and academic performance.\n\nCharacterizing Vulnerable Students in Chile Using PISA 2009\n\nAlthough the sample average hypothetically represents typical performance, table 3 shows that only one in three students who participated in the 2009 PISA had both a low SES and a score equal to or above the national average. According to the functional definition of resilience discussed above, these students can be classified as resilient.\n\nN%Mean (SE)All students in Q11,096100417.4 (3.47)Nonresilient students in Q171266.25378.6 (2.50)Resilient students in Q138433.75493.4 (2.38)\n\nThis proportion in Chile is similar to those reported by other studies about the prevalence of resilience elsewhere. For example, Grotberg (1995, 2006) concludes that one-third of victims of traumatic events develop resilient behaviors. Werner (1996) who undertook one of the first studies on this subject also finds that of a group of at-risk children, a third became adults who were no longer considered at-risk. These results allow for two inferences. First, they confirm a previous application of the criterion used in the present study for defining resilient students. Second, low SES is clearly established as an important risk factor that adversely affects academic performance.\n\nInformed by the estimations discussed above, it is possible to identify the determinants of test performance for the Q1 students. The analysis groups the Q1 students into the two categories “resilient” and “nonresilient” based on their PISA scores, with Resilient students having higher scores than nonresilient students. However, it is not obvious how different the scores should be among resilient, nonresilient students, and average students (defined as those within one-half standard deviation of the sample mean) in regard to the set of the variables that represent resilience and reading comprehension. Table 4 shows the average for each variable by group and the results of testing the significance of the mean differences across groups.\n\nVariablesResilient Students (A)\n\nMean (SE)Nonresilient Students (B)\n\nMean (SE)Students within .5 Standard Deviation from Sample Mean (C)\n\nMean (SE)Multiple Comparisons*1.

With respect to student characteristics, gender is different, with significantly more girls falling in the resilient group. Resilient students tend to have more educated parents and have a higher index of cultural possessions than nonresilient students but less than the average group. Both Q1 groups have the same family size and a similar number of books at home, which is smaller than for the average student. There are also two factors that differentiate resilient students from nonresilient students but not from the average group: resilient students are more likely to have a mother at home and less likely to live in a single-parent household. These two factors are incorporated to describe family structure, due to the importance that the literature places on the family environment for developing resilience.\n\nRegarding reading engagement, the three groups have the same percentage of preference for fiction; in addition, the estimations in table 2 show that this factor only determines the results of the Q4 students. In relation to preference for nonfiction reading, resilient students’ rate of preference equals that of average students, and is higher than that of nonresilient students. There are three factors related to reading engagement that differentiate resilient students from the other two groups: they have a much higher index of reading enjoyment (half a standard deviation above the average), a larger number claim that reading is a favorite hobby, and a smaller number claim to read only as an obligation. Finally, the three groups do not differ with respect to their perception of the school and their teachers, variables that represent the community component of resilience, that is, a positive environment and teachers as possible positive role models.\n\nIn sum, the three groups of students are different in more than just performance and the link between personal traits of resilience and reading comprehension. Much of the current literature assumes that resilience primarily depends on individuals and their attitudes toward adversity, and that reading engagement determines reading comprehension (Guthrie and Wigfield 2000; Wigfield et al. 2008). The results in table 2 regarding students’ reading engagement support both of these assumptions.\n\nSchools Attended by Resilient Students\n\nChile’s educational system is characterized by a large number of private schools that receive state subsidies. The public system is in the hands of local municipal districts where mayors manage the educational resources of their respective municipalities. The National Ministry of Education acts as a regulatory entity for the proper functioning of both public and privatized schools. Under this system, the curriculum is the same for all schools, but the directive board of a private-subsidized school has complete autonomy with regard to school management and organization. This autonomy pertains to providing the institution with a religious orientation, selectively admitting students, appointing teachers and principals, and managing the resources received from the state and from tuitions charged to the families (Arellano 2001; Mizala and Torche 2012). In addition, some of these private schools are not subsidized by government and are attended primarily by students from the high socioeconomic groups. Indeed, the present study found that virtually no student from the Q1 group attended these schools. However, by comparing the distributions of Q1 students between public and private-subsidized schools in 2001 and 2009, we are able to examine whether resilience has changed over time and whether resilience is to the type of school attended (table 5).\n\n20012009Type of SchoolResilient Students\n\nMean (SE)Nonresilient Students\n\nMean (SE)t-TestResilient Students\n\nMean (SE)Nonresilient Students\n\nMean (SE)t-TestPublic.71 (.04).72 (.04)−.25.43 (.03).64 (.03)−4.85***Private-subsidized.26 (.04).27 (.04)−.13.57 (.03).36 (.03)4.85***\n\nTable 5 shows a significant migration from the public to the private-subsidized system between 2001 and 2009. In 2001, there was no difference in the type of school attended by resilient and nonresilient students; seven out of ten students from Q1 attended public schools without differences in academic performance. However, in 2009 both groups had migrated to the private-subsidized sector, with a higher proportion of resilient students making the transfer. As a result, the percentage of resilient students who attended subsidized institutions in 2001 had more than doubled in 2009 and exceeded the percentage who were attending public schools.5 Clearly, the higher performing students from the low-SES group were those who took the chance to transfer to the private-subsidized sector.6 In the same vein, the number of Q1 students who attend public schools is larger among the nonresilient students (table 6). This stands in stark contrast with average students in Chile; only three out of 10 of average students attend public schools, while six out of 10 of nonresilient students do.\n\nStructural FeaturesResilient Students (A)\n\nMean (SE)Nonresilient Students (B)\n\nMean (SE)Students within One-Half SD from the Sample Mean (C)\n\nMean (SE)Multiple Comparisons*Public school.43 (.03).64 (.03).31 (.03)B > A > CWith academic selection.69 (.05).48 (.05).78 (.03)(A = C) > BPeer effect11.41 (.11)10.74 (.13)12.70 (.09)C > A > BNumber of 15-year-old students198.66 (12.26)156.02 (11.09)182.15 (11.57)A > B, A = C, C = BClass size37.39 (.53)35.43 (.52)37.17 (.45)(A = C) > BViolence at the school.12 (.04).25 (.05).09 (.02)B > (A = C)Index of classroom environment−.35 (.11).12 (.08)−.04 (.06)(B = C) > A\n\nFurthermore, resilient students and average students have four factors in common: they attend more selective schools. Seven out of 10 resilient students and nearly eight out of 10 average students attend schools that use academic criteria in their admission process. Both groups attend larger schools with larger class sizes. They attend schools with lower rates of violence. The peer effect, which is measured as the average level of education in classmates’ families, is higher among average and resilient students and lower among nonresilient students; this is the only factor that differentiates the three groups and is more significant than parents’ education. Finally, the only factor that differentiates resilient students from both nonresilient and average students is classroom environment, which is reported to be better in the classes attended by resilient students.\n\nFactors Related to the Probability of Being Resilient\n\nThe above discussion describes the students with respect to their results in the PISA test. Below we present results that are related to the determinants of the propensity to be resilient, using a multilevel logit model. Table 7 presents three models that include interactions between determinants related to individuals and determinants related to schools. From this point of view, the number of variables related to resilience is smaller but coherent with the previous analyses.\n\nModel 1Model 2Model 3CoefficientOdds RatioCoefficientOdds RatioCoefficientOdds Ratio1.

This finding matches other studies that show that girls are more capable of responding well to risk-associated situations (Cappella and Weinstein 2001). Mothers have a significant protective presence for students; their presence in the home favors typical schooling and is the most significant determinant of the probability of being resilient. A larger family size can be related to a lower probability of resilience (although the description in table 4 shows no significant differences in family size between resilient and nonresilient students). The level of cultural possessions in the home increases the probability of being resilient. Lastly, the results for the index of reading enjoyment imply that low-SES students with positive attitudes toward reading are 1.3 times more likely to overcome their disadvantage and perform well. This factor is not a major determinant of the test score, but it is significantly different between resilient and nonresilient.\n\nIn the final model that incorporates all the determinants, student-level factors remain fairly stable. Compared with model 2, a minor change is the gain in significance of attending a public school that, in accordance with the observed migration from public to private institutions, is related to a decrease in the probability of being resilient. According to the final model, the two school-level factors that most increase the probability of being resilient are academic selection and peer effect. School size has a small but positive effect, while violence in school has a negative effect. Confidence intervals have been calculated for each odds ratio of the significant variables in model 3 (see Hosmer and Lemeshow [2000] for this method); table A5 presents these results.\n\nAs a final point, we note that the methodology used in this study estimate empirical associations but do not establishing causality between resilience and student- and school-level variables. To establish causality empirically, we would have had to test for simultaneity and other statistical issues. For example, while we had stated that a student’s enjoyment of reading affects resilience, it is also possible that resilience itself affects a student’s enjoyment of reading. Likewise, with respect to the type of school attended by the student, while it is certain that this factor can influence student achievement, it is also true that the type of school attended (public or private) is a matter of choice in Chile. As previously discussed, it would seem that a higher percentage of resilient students had transferred from public schools to private-subsidized schools than nonresilient students. The same statement applies for other school-level variables in our analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nApplying the theoretical framework of resilience provides a new perspective for examining the characteristics and test results of low-SES students in Chile. The present study shows that one in three 15-year-old students who belong to the lowest SES quartile have achieved average academic performance despite the risks implied by their low SES. The analysis examined the conditions under which this group lives and the family and school traits which support their learning. Based on the findings about the effect of student and school factors, it is possible to initiate a discussion about how to alleviate the adverse effects of poverty and disadvantage on student achievement.\n\nThe analysis confirms the finding in recent literature that students are not randomly allocated to schools in Chile. Consequently, the quality of schools is relevant to learning outcomes and explains the variance in test performance among students. The estimates from our multilevel models indicate that two students from similar conditions will have dissimilar results depending on the school they attend. The schools with low-SES students are indeed different from the schools attended by students in the higher SES groups. Two changes in Chile relate to this point. First, there has been a trend for students to migrate from public to private-subsidized schools, leaving behind students from the lower SES groups in public schools. While more resilient students have migrated to private school, on the margin our results show that attending a public or private school is not a significant determinant of resilience. Perhaps this is because the probability of attending a private school is often mediated by academic selection (Contreras et al. 2010). Thus, the greater share of resilient students in academically selective institutions could be the result of their choice of school and not a direct result of the school (Elacqua and Martinez 2011). As previously noted, our data and methodology are not suitable for determining causality. The effects of selectivity in admissions and the peer effect can be modulated through public policy that promotes social cohesion and academic and economic integration in the school system.7 On the other hand, school-based strategies that promote a positive environment and manage issues of violence would be effective protective factors and thus improve the academic performance of low-SES students.\n\nOf the different student-level factors examined in the study, we highlight the importance of personal enjoyment of and motivation for reading, regardless of the time allocated for mandatory reading tasks, for better reading comprehension. Recent studies in Chile have highlighted this importance (Rivera and Riveri 2011; Valenzuela et al. 2015), and numerous studies elsewhere have confirmed the same relationship (Baker et al. 1996; Guthrie and Wigfield 2000). Thus, policies that promote a better attitude toward books and reading could have a positive impact on reading comprehension and in developing resilience (Chi-Hung et al. 2013).\n\nIn conclusion, this study found that it is the lowest-SES group of students that most improved their scores between 2001 and 2009 in the PISA assessments in Chile. Although a student’s SES strongly affects learning opportunities, the relationship between SES and academic performance is not a simple one. Student, family, and school factors contribute to a student’s ability to overcome disadvantage. With this in mind, educational policies can focus on improving the factors that increase resilience among at-risk students."
