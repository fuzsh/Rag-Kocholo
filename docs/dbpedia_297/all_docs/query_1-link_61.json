        "text": "The back and forth battle between the Frontline and the Main Event Mafia continued through TNA’s first PPV of 2009, Genesis. After several Mafia vs. Frontline clashes, the end of the PPV saw yet another stalemate between the two factions.\n\nAfter both Kurt Angle and Sting were successful in their match-ups against Frontline members, Mafia members, Scott Steiner and Booker T teamed up with Cute Kip (subbing for an injured Kevin Nash), to take on their Frontline counterparts, AJ Styles, Brother Devon and Mick Foley.\n\nThe Mafia came out first and Cute Kip was named the replacement for Kevin Nash. Kip said that he was worthy of being a member of the Main Event Mafia for one night. The Frontline then entered and went right to work, brawling on both the inside and outside of the ring.\n\nWhen things got under control, the battle went back and forth, with both sides exchanging the momentum. The match eventually broke down again and the referee called for the bell, declaring the bout a no contest.\n\nJim Cornette came out and said that main event wasn’t going to end that way and the match had to be restarted. Booker T complained and said that Cornette had no authority to do that. Mick Foley agreed, but said that he did have the authority to restart the match, and he was doing it under hardcore rules.\n\nSteel chairs, trash can lids and a table were brought into the mix, with AJ Styles hitting an amazing Frog Splash off the top rope onto Cute Kip through the table on the outside. Steiner and Devon went back and forth, with Devon taking Steiner down and hitting the top rope headbutt.\n\nBooker T got involved and laid out Devon, before executing a spinaroonie. As Booker got up, Foley caught him with Mr. Socko. Steiner got back to his feet and hit Foley with a trash can. The duo then used the chair on Foley and attempted to hit the axe kick on Foley into the chair.\n\nFoley fought back and grabbed the chair to use for himself. He eventually cleaned house and was able to hit a DDT on Steiner onto the chair to pick up the big win for the Frontline.\n\nTNA Genesis 2009 PPV Report\n\nThe show began with a package the highlighted all the carnage caused by the Main Event Mafia.\n\nMike Tenay and Don West did their usual rundown and talked about Christy Hemme’s injury and the Six Knockout Tag Team match that will replace her vs. Awesome Kong.

They continued to fight and Sabin attempted another Cradle Shock, but was reversed. Shelley attempted another Sliced Bread, but was reversed and looked to have hurt his foot.
