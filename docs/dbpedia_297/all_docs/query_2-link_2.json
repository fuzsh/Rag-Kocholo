The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.\n\n-430 years ago from today\n\n-william shakespeare wrote his first play\n\nExodus 1:6–8 NIV\n\nNow Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them. Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.\n\n-as an insult\n\n-we’re gonna erase you from history\n\n​\n\nThutmose II\n\n​\n\n​\n\n-But in Egyptian history\n\n-And thutmose’s Dad and grandfather\n\n-Thutmose,\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n-there’s two reasons.\n\n-the reason there’s no written record\n\nExodus 1:9–10 NIV\n\n“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”\n\n​\n\n-Egypt was the world super-power\n\n-And pyramids\n\n-Abrahams decendents were nomadic tribes\n\n-it’s well protected, centrally located\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n-It’s not hard to imagine\n\n-Don’t miss that\n\n-it’s the midwives\n\n​\n\n-This is important\n\n-and that’s gutwrenching\n\n​\n\nExodus 2:1-10\n\n​\n\n​\n\nExodus 2:1–4 NIV\n\nNow a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months. But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.\n\n-one boy is saved\n\nExodus 2:5–10 NIV\n\nThen Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it. She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said. Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?” “Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother. Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the baby and nursed him. When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, “I drew him out of the water.”\n\n-or this presidential candidate\n\n​"
