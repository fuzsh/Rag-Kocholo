        "text": "Phil Collins has sort of gone off my music radar but in his Genesis days and his music in the 80s he was on my playlist a lot. This was one of my favourite post Genesis tracks and I found it the other day. It fits exactly where we are as we go into the last few weeks of the session. As always, we don’t know how we are going to get it all done, and as usual, we will. The Education minister is quoted in the papers to say that he is listening to teachers regarding concerns over workload, especially paperwork. And this would be addressed. Now, as a school, and especially as the HT and DHT, we have worked to streamline our planning formats. We firmly believe that planning, delivery and assessment are all crucial corner stones of an effective learning community. However, we need to be free to teach and to spend time with the young people and actually engage in learning. I believe that we have a fairly sound balance in long and short term planning, tracking and assessment data but it is always something that we revisit and discuss throughout each session. The awfully clever DHT is focussed on meaningful assessment and tracking that really influences the teaching and learning for all in our school community. None of us has time to waste. Staff support each other on a daily basis both formally and informally and, against all odds, we get it done. The biggest challenge is managing our development and progress with external demands. Therefore when a new reporting format was introduced we got to work as early as possible. The new software usage, technical hitches and just getting used to a different approach caused great angst and many late nights for everyone. We have changed our reporting timetable to free time and ensure that we don’t have duplication but it has been a challenge. It has taken away my family time at the weekend over the last couple of weeks. I fear I may have missed our Scottish summer and I hope that before next session we, as a larger group, have the opportunity to reflect with colleagues on how we develop this further. Paperwork to one side, the challenges of budgeting come to the fore at this time of the session and, as everyone knows; times are hard! Maybe a bit harder than I had actually taken on-board. In fact I got such a shock that I did send off an email asking if that was really the final figure! Once I had started breathing again I knew that of course it was, and actually I knew that and I have planned for it all. It doesn’t make it any easier. The core of effective teaching is squarely with an effective teacher but resources do play their part. The awfully clever DHT and I have worked with people to ensure that we are getting best value for our money. Our resources have to be the very best and absolutely what we need to enhance the learning and teaching for everyone in our school community. What we mustn’t forget is our biggest and most important resource is our people. Our staff, who I know as throughout every school, are beginning to wane, are the glue that keeps our school improving and delivering effective learning opportunities. We are saying goodbye to our probationer teacher and welcoming two new colleagues who will join us next year along with our newly appointed nursery teacher so it is exciting to get ready to welcome new people into our community. The awfully clever DHT is putting together our Standards and Quality report, looking back at this session and I have collated all our information to finish our School Improvement Plan giving us our template for next session. Already I am excited about the focus areas we have agreed on and on-going developments and new projects that are planned for next session. My box of “school stuff” is beginning to fill up for some holiday work but I won’t be looking in it until after I have relaxed in some summer sun in France, and as many books are lined up for school work, so are those filling up the Kindle (and several paperbacks just in case of a technical hitch). We are on the final count down, we doubt that we will get it all done, we all need our holidays; children and adults, it is the final of the French Open, Queens starts off the grass court season next week and Wimbledon is round the corner. We have had a couple of BBQs, there has been some sunshine and so it is every year, and every year we get there – against all odds, and come back ready to do it all again in August – even better."
