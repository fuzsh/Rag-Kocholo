        "text": "I. Academic degrees, personal titles, and class years\n\nAcademic Degrees\n\nFormal Use\n\nBachelor of Science\n\nBachelor of Arts\n\nMaster of Arts\n\nDoctor of Philosophy\n\nGeneral Use\n\nbachelor’s degree\n\nbachelor’s degree\n\nmaster’s degree\n\ndoctoral degree\n\nAbbreviated Use\n\nB.S.\n\nB.A.\n\nM.A.\n\nPh.D.\n\nAcademic majors, unless a proper noun, should not capitalized (e.g., John has a bachelor of economics degree, or John has a bachelor’s degree in French literature.).\n\nWhen used after a name, an academic abbreviation is set off by commas (e.g., Mary Doe, Ph.D., spoke.).\n\nThe word “degree” should not follow an abbreviation (e.g., She has a B.A. in English literature, not She has a B.A. degree in English literature.).\n\nThe first time a name is mentioned in narrative text, use the suffix (e.g., John Smith, Ph.D., spoke at the event.) For subsequent referrals to the name, you need not repeat the suffix (e.g., Dr. Smith spoke about religion in South America, or Smith was pleased to speak to so many of our students.).\n\nAvoid redundancies.\n\nDo not precede a name with a courtesy title for an academic degree and follow it with the abbreviation for the degree in the same reference (e.g., Jane Doe, Ph.D., not Dr. Jane Doe, Ph.D.).\n\nUse abbreviations after full names, but refrain from using abbreviations after last names alone (e.g., Jane Doe, Ph.D., not Doe, Ph.D.).\n\nWhen listed, names should be in alpha order by last name.\n\nTitles\n\nOnly capitalize formal titles when used directly before a name (e.g., Vice President for Advancement and External Affairs, Leah Leto M.Ed. ’05).\n\nIn general, do not capitalize titles that follow a name (e.g., Leah Leto M.Ed. ’05, vice president for advancement and external affairs, is in today.).\n\nCourtesy titles such as Miss, Mr., Mrs. or Ms. should not be used with the first and last names of the person. Use last name only unless otherwise indicated (e.g., Mr. Smith, or Joe Smith, not Mr. Joe Smith).\n\nAcademic Titles\n\nCapitalize and spell out formal titles such as president, professor, dean, chairman, etc., when they precede a name (e.g.,Professor Smith). It is preferred that these titles appear in lowercase when the title follows a name or stands alone (e.g., Bob Smith is a professor at Saint Peter’s University.).\n\nTry to avoid abbreviating the word “Professor.” In case of space restrictions, use “Dr.” in place of Professor.\n\nIn general, lowercase modifiers (e.g., We spoke with history professor Bob Smith about his work.).\n\nIn some cases, appointed academic titles may be capitalized following a name (e.g., if given a title by the Peabody Fund, a person could be called Bob Smith, Peabody Professor of Languages).\n\nDo not hyphenate “vice president.”\n\nWhen referring to a retired male professor, use the word emeritus after the title (e.g., Joe Smith, dean emeritus of the graduate school, visited.).\n\nEmerita – singular female\n\nEmeriti – plural male or mixed-gender professors\n\nEmeritae – plural female\n\nAlumni\n\nAlumnus\n\nAlumnus – singular male\n\nAlumni – plural male\n\nAlumna – singular female\n\nAlumnae – plural female\n\nAlumni names are expressed with an apostrophe and the last two digits of the graduation year (e.g., Jane Doe ’96).\n\nNote the direction of the apostrophe.\n\nJane Doe ’96 is correct; Jane Doe ‘96 is not.\n\nWhen listing the recipients of honorary degrees, place a capital “H” between the recipient’s last name and the year of reception (e.g., Edward Jones H ’04). All references should specify that the degree was honorary. Do not use the name Dr. before the name of an individual whose only doctorate is honorary.\n\nWhen listing the recipients of honorary alumni awards, place a capital “HA” between the recipient’s last name and the year of reception (e.g., Sarah O’Malley HA ’76).\n\nAlumni who are faculty, staff and administrators at Saint Peter’s University should place their graduation years after their names on business cards, name tags and signature lines.\n\nFor two-degree graduates, use comma/space: “Jane Doe ’07, ’09”\n\nDepartments of Study\n\nCapitalize the names of formal programs of study, but lowercase informal and generic references to programs and courses of study (e.g., He was enrolled in the theology program; or The lecture was presented by the Department of Theology.).\n\nCapitalize official names of courses and lecture series, but do not use quotation marks. (e.g., He is registered for Introduction to Sociology, or Robert Smith gave a talk for the Guarini Lecture Series.)\n\nDesignations\n\nCommas are used to set off academic, professional and religious designations (e.g., Robert G. Lahita, M.D.; Rev. Michael Braden, S.J.; Kristina Chew, Ph.D. etc.).\n\nCommas are not used to set off Jr., Sr., and I, II, and III after a name, because these are considered part of a person’s name (e.g.,Martin Luther King Jr., Michael J. Kabot II).\n\nReligious designations\n\nThe first reference to a clergyman or clergywoman normally should include a capitalized title before the individual’s name with the initials S.J. after it (e.g., Rev. Rocco Danzi, S.J.).\n\nWhen the designation “S.J.” is used, it should always be capitalized, have periods after each letter, and appear following the person’s name set off by commas (e.g., John Smith, S.J.).\n\nOn second reference, it is common to omit the first name (e.g., Rev. John Smith, S.J., followed by Fr. Smith).\n\nAbbreviations for Catholic religious orders can be found online at: https://www.catholicdoors.com/misc/abbrev.htm."
