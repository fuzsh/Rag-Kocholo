        "text": "Let’s say that your favorite movie is The Godfather. If you held a copy of it in your hand, would you use the word titled or entitled to say what the name of the movie is? Which word is correct? Are they both correct?\n\nIn this article, we will break down the difference between titled and entitled, explain how they are typically used, and give example sentences that show how we use both words.\n\nWhen to use titled or entitled\n\nThe word titled is almost always used as the past tense and past participle form of the verb title, which means “to give a distinguishing name (title) to.” If someone says that a movie is titled Jurassic Park, for example, they are saying that the name of the movie is Jurassic Park. While titled can also be used as an adjective to mean “having a distinctive or honorary name (title),” this usage is uncommon.\n\nThe word entitled has several meanings. As an adjective, it’s most often used to mean “assuming one has the right to do something or has a claim to a special privilege.” As an adjective, entitled can also mean “called by the given distinguishing name (title)” or “having a legitimate right to something.”\n\nHere are examples of these senses:\n\nThe older generations often accuse millennials of acting entitled.\n\nMy favorite Star Wars movie is entitled Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\n\nAccording to the will, the billionaire’s daughter, not his son, is legally entitled to the family fortune.\n\nEntitled is also the past tense and past participle form of the verb entitle. In this sense it means “to call by a particular title or name,” making it a synonym for the past tense verb titled.\n\nFor example:\n\nThere is a lot of speculation as to why the song is entitled “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.”"
