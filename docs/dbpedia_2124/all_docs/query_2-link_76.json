        "text": "Rhode Islandâ€™s Title Law Has Changed\n\nEffective January 1, 2024\n\nALL VEHICLES coming into Rhode Island from out of state, regardless of model year, require a VIN Inspection from a local municipal police department.\n\nIf an out of state vehicle is being registered in Rhode Island, and the state from which the vehicle is coming is a state that required a title for that vehicle, that title MUST be in the name of the seller, properly assigned to the buyer, and be presented, along with VIN Inspection at the time of sales tax payment or registration at the RI DMV.\n\nIf an out of state vehicle is being registered in Rhode Island, and the state from which the vehicle is coming is a state that did not require a title for that vehicle, a valid proof of ownership (e.g. old registration, or paid sales tax form) in the name of the seller must be presented, along with a VIN Inspection, at the time of sales tax payment or registration at the RI DMV.\n\nRhode Island vehicles model year 2000 and older first registered to the seller prior to 1/1/2024 require the seller to provide the buyer with a bill of sale and valid proof of ownership (e.g. old registration, or paid sales tax form) in the name of the seller.\n\nSince Rhode Island is titling all vehicles beginning 1/1/2024, Rhode Island vehicles model year 2000 and older first registered to the seller on or after 1/1/2024 require the seller to provide the buyer with a title in their name, properly assigned to the buyer along with a bill of sale.\n\nALL VEHICLES, regardless of model year will now be issued a Rhode Island Certificate of Title upon payment of Sales Tax and/or Registration.\n\n*Attention* Important information Regarding Sales Tax Payments*\n\nSales tax must be paid at the DMV at the time of registration and/or titling of the vehicle. Sales tax can also be paid prior to registration and/or titling at the Rhode Island Division of Taxation.\n\nCustomers are required to remit sales tax payments to the State in a timely manner. If sales tax is not paid by the 20th of the month following the month in which the sale took place, you may incur additional cost becuase of interest and penalty charges added to your base sales tax bill. For example, if your bill of sale is dated July 26, 2020 your sales tax would be due on August 20,2020. If it is not paid on or before that date, interest and penalty charges would accrue.\n\nSales tax can also be paid prior to registration and/or titling at the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. If you are not able to visit the DMV in a timely manner to get your vehicle registered and remit sales tax to DMV prior to the tax due date, you may contact Division of Taxation to pay your sales tax directly before the tax due date to avoid interest and penalty charges. Excise tax section can be reached at 401 - 574 -8955 or via email tax.excise@tax.ri.gov"
