        "text": "Have you ever wondered how to stand out at work or how to make yourself noticeable to get a promotion?\n\nThis came from a conversation I was having with a professional whose company was overtaken by another company. They were bought out. They went from a company with around 50 employees to now in the 1000s.\n\nShe had some valid questions:\n\nWhen you’re bought out by the big guy, how do you really prove that you should be there?\n\nHow do you continue to move up the ladder when now the ladder seems very big with a lot more competition?\n\n(Or for my entrepreneurs, These ideas can still apply to you. Ask yourself, “How can I be chosen out of all of my competitors?” Stay tuned for my next blog where I will specifically cover this for you.)\n\nHere are five specific steps that you can do right now no matter where you are in your company and no matter what level you’re at.\n\nEven if you’re not in a company, you can still think about:\n\nHow you can apply these to make a name for your industry because you have your own business\n\nHow you can make a name for yourself on the board that you’re on\n\nHow you can make a name for yourself in your circle of friends\n\nAnd with every topic I cover, you can always think about how you can apply these to other areas of life.\n\nFirst: Align Yourself with the Company’s Values, Mission, and Culture\n\nIf you are about to be bought out by another company or even if you are working for the same company, you have to think about:\n\nWhat are the company's values?\n\nWhat's their mission?\n\nWhat's their culture?\n\nWhat is most important to them? Is it efficiency, productivity, sales, customer service, humanitarian efforts?\n\nWhat is it that they really regard highly?\n\nIf you can align yourself with that, it’s going to help you to stand out. When you have your next meeting, performance review and even in an interview, plan how you’ll share this alignment. Have examples or stories of your ideas, experiences, and actions to prove that you're in alignment with them, especially in casual conversations that happen, it's going to help you to make a name for yourself.\n\nSecond: Connect with Others\n\nWhether you know every person in your company or not, this is an opportunity to reach out and get to know them or maintain and nurture that relationship. How do you do that?\n\nThere are so many different platforms that companies are on like Slack or you have another in-house messenger system. Shoot them a short voicemail or a short video or even just reach out and just say, “Hey, how's it going?\n\nIf you don't know each other well, why not do a virtual coffee? Especially with Zoom and people being in their own homes, you get to learn a little bit more about them than you maybe normally would if you were talking in the office, workspace, or staff room.\n\nGet to know them. Ask questions like:\n\nWhat do they do on the weekend?\n\nDo they have family?\n\nDo they have a pet?\n\nWhat do they like to do?\n\nWhat are their hobbies?\n\nI know these are basic questions, but when you get to know these things about them, then you can easily refer back to it the following week. You could say:\n\n“Hey, did you go skiing again this weekend?”\n\n“Have you seen any other great movies?”\n\n“Did you finish that book you were reading?”\n\nThere are so many things you can talk about just based on you asking one question the week before or the last time you saw them. It might help to even write it down especially if you're going to be meeting a lot of new people. Write down one interesting fact about them. Then when you see them next time, follow up with that.\n\nThe cool thing is, in them sharing something about themselves, you can then acknowledge them. If you get to know them on a personal basis, acknowledge them for who they're being like:\n\n“Wow, you sound like a really great chef.”\n\n“Oh, I hear that you're a really loving sister.”\n\nWhatever it may be, you can do a very simple acknowledgment. You can use this formula:\n\n“You are a” + “an adjective” + title\n\nFor example: You are a wonderful mother.\n\nYou can also compliment them. It can be simple or on a more professional basis:\n\n“That's a great colour you’re wearing.”\n\n“I love your Zoom background.”\n\nWhatever it may be, you can compliment them on how they were doing in the job or how they were performing:\n\n“That was a really great email you wrote.”\n\n“I really loved the presentation you made. Congrats on such great slides!”\n\nYou can compliment them on who they were being like:\n\n“Wow you're really organized.”\n\n“You were really patient with that customer.”\n\nYou can give people an acknowledgment or a compliment. There are so many different ways and versions of it and it can be personal or professional. You have two choices.\n\nThird: Speak Up\n\nYou don't need to be the boss. You don't need to be the one that is going to dominate the conversation, but you should at least say something in meetings. Come up with ideas and share them.\n\nWhen you have that opportunity to present something or even ask a question, do it. You need to have a voice to the name and the email. You need to have people see you when they normally just see your name up on a board somewhere.\n\nIf you're feeling like there's not really an opportunity for you to add ideas you can just add in one of these:\n\nYou can agree with someone, “Yeah, I agree with Ronnie's idea to do that at the next event we're hosting.”\n\nYou can give someone kudos, “I appreciate the work Helen has put into this project.”\n\nYou can ask a clarifying question, “So if you’re saying X, does that mean Y?” or “So am I understanding that XYZ? Is that what you're saying?”\n\nThat shows interest. That shows that you care to know that what you’ve heard is right. If you don't have anything else to say, you can at least ask a question or provide a statement.\n\nFourth: Be Yourself\n\nThere can be many employees in a company and many people in your industry, so that everyone can start to blend into one another, especially for anyone that has a specific uniform that you have to wear. But:\n\nCan you be yourself in other ways?\n\nCan you have a snazzy email signature?\n\nCan you have a certain way that you close off or open up in your email writing?\n\nCan you have some other way to show that you're fun, creative, or smart?\n\nCan you change your Zoom name or put something besides the Zoom name?\n\nIf you wear glasses, could your glasses be a bit more fun or a bit more unique?\n\nCould you wear a statement necklace or a brighter colored shirt?\n\nJust be yourself so that you stand out in your uniqueness.\n\nFifth: Make Yourself More Recognizable\n\nI don't know how many times I finally got to meet in-person someone I had only emailed with or spoken to on the phone and I was thinking, “Oh, I thought they’d look like this or thought they’d look like that.” People can be more connected to you when they know what you look like. In your emails, can you put an image of yourself so that you're recognizable when they see you?\n\nWhen you jump on the meetings, get on video. I don't know how many times I've been on calls and people are not on video. They don't even have a photo when they're not on video, so it just says their name on a black screen. That’s not very memorable.\n\nGet on video. Have people see you. Even if you're not the one speaking, be on video, to be smiling, nodding, looking thoughtful as if you're really listening, that goes a long way for someone who's presenting as a speaker.\n\nI know I notice that. I was at a little meet and greet event the other week and one of the other women, as everyone was introducing themselves, was smiling and nodding and showing that she was really listening. That prompted me to reach out to her in a private message through the chat function of Zoom.\n\nI told her something like, “Hey, who are you? You are doing such a good job smiling and nodding at people. I love it. Congratulations.” What started up as our own little conversation ended up having a virtual coffee date. She was making herself not just recognizable, but she was standing out as a good person.\n\nWhen you go to a meeting or an event and you have a question or comment to make, start by saying your name. Don't assume that people know your name or know your department. You could say:\n\n“I'm Janie Smith from accounting.”\n\n“I am Tony Lee, and I've been working on XYZ project.”\n\nLet people know who you are. Say your name and say what you're working on or something just to connect people if they don't already know.\n\nThose are the five ways that you can make a name for yourself in your company or industry. Most of them are focusing on great ideas for being an employee. However, if you are a business owner, you work for yourself, or in a different capacity and you want to make yourself known in the industry that you work in, then stay tuned in next week. This is exactly what I am going to cover. I'm going to share some of the tactics that I use as well.\n\nRead more of my blogs here:\n\n1.
