        "text": "Naming your artwork can be very difficult for most artists. Since I love making up words so much, it hasn‚Äôt been a major problem for me. However, in the beginning, I struggled with knowing whether I was naming my pieces the right way or whether I was doing something wrong by naming them ‚Äúmy way‚Äù. In other words, are there standard conventions for giving artwork titles?\n\nVery often, I come upon this question or a variation of it in the different art groups to which I belong. How do you title your artwork? Interestingly, recently I was faced with this same question.\n\nAs an artist, I‚Äôve got to answer this question every time I create a new piece. Usually, by the time I finish the piece, I‚Äôve got a name for it. and as part of my finishing touches, I add the title to the back of each piece I make before I call it done. Interestingly, when I completed my last piece, I didn‚Äôt have a name for it by the time I was done.\n\nHow to Title an Artpiece\n\nThat was the first time in a long time I‚Äôve been faced with this question again. How should I title an art piece? This is my method for coming up with all the titles of my works.\n\nThe titles I give my work will come to me during the process of making the piece. They generally have to do with one of these things:\n\nthe color scheme I used (for example Yellow Oranges)\n\nthe design (for example Rhythm #1)\n\nthe subject (for example Bread & Butter or Skyline Under the Bridge)\n\nthe venue (for example (Cappadocia Caves)\n\nthe inspiration (for example my Mobiles #1 is based on Alexander Calder‚Äôs mobiles)\n\nmy thoughts and emotions during the creative process ( For example ‚ÄúWhirlwind Thoughts‚Äù or ‚ÄúTowering Above‚Äù)\n\nAs you can see there are several ways you can come up with a title for your work. There are still various things you need to think about when naming your artwork. One of them is what makes a good title. Jason Horejs from ReDotBlog.com has the following suggestions.\n\nWhat Makes a Good Title?\n\nA good title :\n\nwill provide insight into your inspiration for the artwork\n\nmay help the artwork tell its story.\n\nleaves room for the viewer to bring his or her own meaning and interpretation of the artwork.\n\nwill be memorable and catchy\n\nwill be original\n\nwill not be too cheesy\n\nWhy You Shouldn‚Äôt Name Your Work ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù\n\nSo what about naming your work ‚Äúuntitled‚Äù. If you can‚Äôt come up with a suitable name is it okay to name it ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù?\n\nJason Horejs says\n\nA buyer wants to feel like that artwork they are about to purchase from you is one of your best ever ‚Äì that it truly is one of your masterworks. They‚Äôre going to have a hard time believing that if you‚Äôve called the piece ‚ÄúUntitled No. 427‚Äù.\n\nAnd artist Lisa Bernard says\n\nThis can be a real deal stopper and a complete turn off to a potential customer. Viewers and potential buyers will have a hard time believing your work has value if your piece is simply called ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù. Titles do matter to an art buyer!\n\nObviously, names matter to buyers. If you don‚Äôt intend to sell your work any time in the future, you may be able to get away with not taking the time to name them properly. Although naming your work also helps you to easily organize, sort through, and find a particular piece when you need it.\n\nI must say though, after a while of naming your work, it becomes second nature to you. Well, except the occasional piece that doesn‚Äôt tell you what it wants to be called üôÇ like, my latest piece. In that case, you can resort to this method.\n\nThe Last Resort Method for Naming Your Work\n\nJust ask people!!!\n\nAnd that‚Äôs exactly what I did with the piece I couldn‚Äôt name. I told my Instagram followers what the piece represents to me and the thoughts I had about it. Then, I asked them to help me name it. And Instagram artist Julia Walten suggested the name ‚ÄúMy Cup Runs Over‚Äù which I loved. Because it truly conveys what I wanted to say with this piece. So that became its name.\n\nHow do you name your work? Do you have a system? Does the work tell you what it wants to be called? Or do you struggle with naming your work? I want to hear your views.\n\nWarmest Regards,"
