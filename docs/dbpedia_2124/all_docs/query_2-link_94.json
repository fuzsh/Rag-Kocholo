        "text": "The following information will assist you with the proper procedures when buying a vehicle in Pennsylvania. The buyer and seller should meet at the office of a notary public, tag service, or motor vehicle dealer to ensure the title application is completed correctly. If the car is financed, the certificate of title in your name will be mailed to the lienholder. If the vehicle is not financed, the certificate of title in your name will be sent directly to you.\n\nAcceptable Proof of Ownership\n\nBuying New\n\nSelling New\n\nBuying Used (PA)\n\nBuying Used (Out-of-State)\n\nMotor Vehicle Understated Value Program\n\nAcceptable Proof of Ownership Documents\n\nVehicle ownership documents issued by vehicle manufacturers and titling jurisdictions that provide specific vehicle information and used as the legal document to transfer ownership of the vehicle are known as “proof of ownership” documents. The following are the acceptable proof of ownership documents:\n\nManufacturer Certificate/Statement of Origin (MCO or MSO)\n\nPennsylvania Certificate of Title\n\nOut of State Certificate of Title\n\nCertificate of Salvage\n\nCourt Order (PDF)\n\nBuying a New Vehicle\n\nIf you are titling and registering a 2008 or newer vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 8,500 pounds or less, and it has less than 7,500 miles on the odometer, your vehicle must be certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). For more information about this program, visit the Pennsylvania Clean Vehicles Program page.\n\nMCO and MSO documents are used in conjunction with Form MV-1, “Application for Certificate of Title.” This form is only available from authorized agents of PennDOT.\n\nYou will need to provide several items to the agent to complete your application. Please take a copy of your current Pennsylvania Drivers License or Pennsylvania Photo Identification (PDF). If you are a business or non-profit organization buying a car, please make sure you bring the acceptable identification requirements (PDF) with you as well.\n\nA copy of your current insurance identification card (PDF) is required if registration is to be issued.\n\nThe dealer where you purchased your new vehicle is responsible for sending the title application to PennDOT. More information can be found in the Buying or Selling Your Car in Pennsylvania (PDF) fact sheet.\n\nSelling a New Vehicle\n\nWhen selling a vehicle, the seller must sign and handprint their name on the proof of ownership document. The seller’s signature is required to be notarized or verified on the Pennsylvania title. The seller’s signature may be required to be notarized on some out-of-state titles. The seller will need to provide the authorized PennDOT agent with proper proof of identification (PDF). If the vehicle is owned by a business, the person acting on behalf of the business must be an authorized individual or provide proper proof of authorization to act on behalf of the business. Additional information on this authorization may be viewed in our Identification Requirements for Completion of Motor Vehicle Applications by Business Organizations or Non-Profit Corporations (PDF) fact sheet.\n\nThe seller must indicate the mileage of the vehicle in the appropriate spaces provided on the ownership document. After the title is transferred, the seller must remove the license plate from the vehicle. The license plate should be returned to PennDOT at Bureau of Motor Vehicles, Return Tag Unit, P.O. Box 68597, Harrisburg, PA 17106-8597, unless the seller is planning to transfer the plate to another vehicle. More information may be viewed in our Buying or Selling Your Car in Pennsylvania (PDF) fact sheet.\n\nBuying a Used Vehicle with a PA Certificate of Title\n\nPennsylvania Certificate of Titles (PDF) are used in conjunction with Form MV-4ST, “Vehicle Sales and Use Tax Return/Application for Registration.” This form is only available from authorized agents of PennDOT.\n\nIn addition to the Pennsylvania title you will need to provide several items to the agent to complete your title application.

More information can be found on our How to Title and Register Your Out of State Vehicle fact sheet (PDF).\n\nWhen buying a car (PDF) which has been titled in another state, the purchaser should check the back of the title carefully.
