        "text": "Name Badges for Work Put Your Brand on Display\n\nThe name badges you use for work have space to display your company’s distinct logo. One option is printing name tags with a full-color logo to help them stand out. This helps keep your brand in the mind of customers and clientele. A logo can set the tone and draw attention to the name tag.\n\nDesigning Name Badges for Work with Intention\n\nYour logo is an important element of name tag design. Your name tag’s background can also make a great impression. You can use a gold or silver design to give it a more professional look. Or you can use colorful backgrounds for a more relaxed feel. Basic black and white backgrounds can make your font and logo pop. You can also design name badges for work to the type of business you operate. Custom-shaped name tags can be made into any shape from houses for real estate agents, a dog bone for groomers, or any other business or industry-related shape.\n\nWork Name Tags Can Offer Insight into Your Company’s Culture\n\nWorkplace name tags can provide visitors and customers with more information about your company culture. Name badges communicate different messages. You can choose to include inspirational slogans, brand promises, an accolade, moto, or another message to distinguish your company. Using custom text on the name badge provides visual reminders that you want to deliver to consumers.\n\nThe Best Name Badges for Work Showcase Expertise\n\nThe best name badges for work introduce your specialists to your clients. Workplace name tags should contain the job titles of your staff. This lets you designate your teams like marketing, sales personnel, or technical workers. Special fonts can be used to showcase job titles, customer service specialists, or supervisory positions. Design workplace work tags to demonstrate your comprehensive services.\n\nDesign Name Tags for Work to Be Practical\n\nThink about the practical side when designing name badges for work. You can choose metal, plastic, or wood materials to make name badges. Choose a basic design or one with a lot of bling based on what best represents your industry or business. Attachments should also take into consideration what type of clothing the name tags will be worn with. For instance, if name tags are worn with suits or more formal clothing, a magnetic attachment is ideal. For aprons or t-shirts, you might get by with a simple pin attachment. It’s all about choosing what works best in your business setting.\n\nNeed Help with a Name Badge for the Workplace?\n\nContact us at Name Tag Pros for help designing the best name badge to use at work.
