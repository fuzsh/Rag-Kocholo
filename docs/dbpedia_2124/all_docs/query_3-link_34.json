Shopify’s free naming brand generator lets you jump from naming your brand to securing the domain name, to starting your small business - all in a few clicks.\n\nComing up with a business name for your brand\n\nNow that you have the perfect business idea, the next decision you’ll have to make is choosing a business name reflective of your brand or products. We know that coming up with a name for your business isn’t an easy task, especially with the pressure of making it unique, while also developing the rest of your business from scratch. However, in order to keep your finger on the pulse, you’ll want to take all necessary steps in finding the perfect name to match your business idea.\n\nTo get you started and moving in the right direction, consider these three important factors before creating a name for your small business:\n\nYour brand: It’s important for your business name to reflect the type of brand, products, or services you’re developing. This will influence how you market and interact with your target audience, and eventually build brand recognition over time.\n\nYour market: Analyze similar products, services, or marketing material within your industry, and think about what makes other brands memorable. Then, use that same lens to think about what will make your brand unique and stand out from the others.\n\nSearchability: A good business name is memorable and easy to find. As a result, you’ll want to set your sights on naming options that are available, through our domain name generator, social media handles, and SEO opportunities to make your business searchable.\n\nIf you’re looking for an easy-to-use business name creator, Shopify’s brand naming generator will help you name your business or ecommerce store in 10-seconds, or less. All you have to do is describe your business in one word, enter that keyword into the search bar, and the naming generator will do the rest! There are hundreds of unique business name ideas for you to choose from, so you can compare your favorites and land on a name that resonates most with your business idea.\n\nHow to choose a business name\n\nShopify’s online store name generator is designed with simplicity and creativity in-mind. When using the shop name generator, you’ll be provided with a ton of potential brandable business names and domains, but finding the name that works for your brand is up to you. Knowing what makes the best name isn’t always easy, but as you go down your list of creative business name ideas, here is how to choose the best one for your brand:\n\nMake your name memorable: A customer’s ability to recall your business name has a huge impact on how they view your business. From every inch of the marketing funnel, to attracting new customers, and bringing back loyal ones - it’s all linked to how quickly a potential customer remembers your name.\n\nBranding: Your name will be a blueprint for all the decisions you make when developing your brand down the road. Over time your logo, slogan, and value proposition can be changed, but it’s exceedingly hard to change your name without losing some of the strength of your online brand. Choose a name that can evolve with the long term vision for your brand.\n\nClarity: A simple, clear, and direct name will be far more catchy and easier for customers to recall. If customers don’t understand your brand initially, they’re less likely to remember it later on. Good brand names don’t require too much explanation. While it should be clear, it should also be adaptable to change. Names that are too topical, or directly reference a specific product could box you in later on. Make sure to evaluate your business name idea for company growth potential and entry into adjacent industries.\n\nUniqueness: Customers won’t remember a brand name if it isn’t distinct. Catchy branding is all about setting yourself apart from your competition and that starts with a cool, unique business name. A unique brand name that grabs a customer’s attention will be remembered later on.\n\nAvailability: Last but not least, you need to make sure your brand name isn’t already taken. Setting aside the legal risks, another brand with your name (or something similar) can be confusing for customers and damaging to your online reputation. This is true of your domain name as well. Your domain name should be as memorable as your business name and easy to associate with your brand. When you’ve selected a name, make sure to check for domain availability and claim a workable domain as soon as possible, with the help of our domain name generator.\n\nFinding the best name for your business doesn’t have to be complicated. With Shopify’s brand name generator, we make it easy to know your creative options, while keeping in mind everything else you need to grow your business. Once you’ve discovered how to choose a business name, you’re one step closer to launching your dream brand online."
