        "text": "If youâve been in the workforce for more than five minutes you probably have heard a lot of meeting advice, such as âset a clear agendaâ or âdetermine if the meeting can be an email instead.â But people who give advice on better meetings often overlook the lowly meeting name. This is a huge miss! A great meeting name can dramatically improve the chances that your invitees will arrive prepared and ready to engage.\n\nThis post will walk you through why you should pay attention to meeting names, how to determine the purpose of each meeting, and how to replace the default meeting name with one that conveys the purpose of the meeting. Weâll also briefly cover how to write an excellent meeting description.\n\nLetâs get started!\n\nThe underrated power of great meeting namesÂ\n\nYou want your meeting to stand out as obviously worth your inviteesâ precious time. In a competition for limited time, âMarketing syncâ isnât super compelling.\n\nSo before you whip up a meeting invite or send out your scheduling link, take a beat and consider your meeting title carefully.\n\nHere are five key benefits to naming your meeting well:\n\n1. Less guessing\n\nNo one likes seeing a meeting invite and having to guess what the meeting is about. It can provoke anxiety and irritation. A great meeting name makes it clear what the purpose of the meeting is.\n\n2. Better attendees\n\nA well-named meeting lets invitees quickly ascertain whether they should be at your meeting. Not only does this save time for those who donât need to be there (benefitting the organization as a whole), but it also can lead to smaller meetings, which research shows are generally more effective.\n\n3. More preparedness\n\nInvitees who choose to attend your well-named meeting have an easier time preparing for the meeting, and are thus more likely to show up prepared.\n\n4. Shorter meetings\n\nWhen everyone shows up prepared and informed about the meetingâs objective, you can get straight to business, resulting in a shorter meeting.\n\n5. More interesting calendars\n\nWell-named meetings make for much more interesting calendars! It gives attendees the chance to look forward to interesting discussions and a greater sense of accomplishment.\n\nSounds pretty good, right? Now letâs talk about the first step to better meeting names: figuring out your meetingâs purpose.Â\n\nAligning on the purpose of your meeting\n\nIf nothing else, a great meeting name answers the question \"Why are we meeting?\" It should be actionable and contain a verb.\n\nEveryone reading the meeting name should know why the meeting is happening, why they were invited, and why they should attend. Not only does that help you come up with a better title, but it also helps you ensure that you really need to have the meeting. Not every meeting should be an email, but not every email should be a meeting.\n\nIf you want to share project updates, sitting around a table or on a Zoom call may not be the best use of everyoneâs time. There are other ways to update a team. Dedicated Slack or Microsoft Teams channels can serve as the catchall for status updates on a predetermined cadence â daily, weekly, monthly, etc. You can also make better use of project management apps to house all the information anyone on the team needs â and refer teammates to it regularly to help encourage a routine of seeking information first and asking questions second.\n\nHereâs one way to nail down your next meetingâs purpose. Just fill in the blank.\n\nWe must meet in order to _________.\n\nExamples:\n\nDecide whether to move forward with a particular candidate\n\nDecide whether to adjust a deadline\n\nBrainstorm marketing ideas\n\nFinalize the sprint plan\n\nNaming the different types of meetingsÂ\n\nThere are many types of meetings, but here are five types of meetings that are actually worth having:\n\n1. Weekly team syncs\n\nWell-run weekly team meetings offer at least three vital benefits. They can:\n\nClarify every team memberâs roles and top priorities\n\nOffer a place to communicate complicated or controversial ideas ill-suited for email or Slack\n\nProvide a place to offer public praise to team members, in real-time\n\nHowever, âWeekly team syncâ is a pretty terrible name for a meeting. Remember, the purpose isnât to share status updates. Thatâs better suited to project management software or Slack. Instead, these should be team-building meetings. Your agenda should include things like clarifying roles and priorities, talking through questions that arenât suited to asynchronous communication channels, and/or boosting morale and team cohesion.\n\nTo give this meeting a better name, tie it to the purpose of the meeting. Maybe you could call it âWeekly team-building,â âWeekly priority aligning,â âWeekly issue clarification,â or âWeekly team shout-outs.â Or âWeekly team priority setting and shout-outs.â\n\n2. Manager one-on-ones\n\nOne-on-one meetings offer many important benefits. In fact, CEO and investor Ben Horowitz thinks one-on-ones are so important that he once threatened to fire a senior leader unless he started holding them. When managers and direct reports meet regularly workers feel confident that theyâre on the right track. It boosts employee engagement and offers you both a place to give each other feedback. A performance review should never come as a surprise. Regular one-on-ones, utilized correctly, help ensure that never happens.\n\nAs such, you could call your one-on-one â[Manager name]/[report name] priority setting and feedback.âÂ\n\n3. Decision-making and problem-solving meetings\n\nDecision-making meetings help everyone feel heard and included in the decision-making process rather than feeling like theyâre just taking orders. Tons of research links a feeling of autonomy with job satisfaction, and job satisfaction with higher performance. A well-run decision-making meeting can be a huge win for both morale and productivity.\n\nName this meeting with the word âDecisionâ and a few words to refer to the decision that needs to be made.Â Â\n\n4. Brainstorming sessions\n\nAccording to professional development thought leader Brian Tracy, âBrainstorming builds involvement, commitment, loyalty, and enthusiasm.â He writes that brainstorming meetings unlock peopleâs creative talents, build self-esteem, and help create a better climate for cooperation and teamwork. âThe most important payoff is that you will come up with lots of good ideas and sometimes ideas that change the direction of the business.â\n\nInstead of just calling a meeting a âBrainstorming sessionâ or something equally vague, get your inviteesâ creative juices flowing by including what kind of ideas youâre looking for. For example, if youâre looking for ideas for a big marketing project to tackle in Q2, consider naming the meeting something like, âQ2 big marketing project brainstorm.â\n\n5. Project kickoffs\n\nA great project kickoff can improve the working relationship between stakeholders while increasing the likelihood that a project will stay under-budget and on-time. This kind of planning meeting is a great way to decrease the likelihood of missed deadlines, issues, scope creep, and change orders.\n\nAgain, the goal of the meeting is to understand and align on the following about a project as much as possible before getting started:\n\nGoals\n\nLikely effort\n\nTechnology requirements\n\nKey dates and deliverables\n\nAssumptions\n\nUse the name of the project in the meeting name, and include a verb. Example, âQ2 marketing project needs alignment.â\n\nFinding the ideal title for your meeting\n\nLetâs take another look at the examples of meeting goals from the meeting purpose section.\n\nDecide whether to move forward with a particular candidate\n\nDecide whether to adjust a deadline\n\nBrainstorm marketing ideas\n\nFinalize the sprint plan\n\nHow are they named now, and how we might be able to improve their names?\n\nLetâs say the purpose of the âInterview Debriefâ is to decide whether to move forward with a particular candidate. âDebriefâ isnât really the goal or purpose of the meeting, but rather something that will happen during the meeting. To make the name refer to the purpose, you could instead call that meeting âCandidate decisionâ or âHiring decision.â Similarly, if youâre holding a meeting to decide whether to adjust a deadline, you could call that meeting âDeadline shift decision.âÂ\n\nIf youâre meeting to brainstorm marketing ideas, a good name might be âMarketing ideas brainstorm.â If youâre looking to finalize a sprint plan, you might call that meeting âSprint finalization.âÂ\n\nAnother idea from Lucid Meetings: Design your meeting names to convey your cultural values. They offer examples like âThe Huddle, the Adrenaline call, the Council, the Braintrust, the Conclave, the Tsunami, the Tiger, the Bullpen, the Dory.â Itâs true that they donât reveal the purpose of the meeting to outsiders. But once you're on the inside, you feel like part of the team because you know what these words mean in this context.Â\n\nPro-tip: Go through and rename all your existing meetings as practice and to get the benefits mentioned above. While youâre doing this, audit your meetings to be sure every meeting on your calendar really is necessary. Another tool that can help you is Clockwiseâs 1:1 dashboard where you can see, evaluate, and move all your 1:1 meetings at a glance.Â\n\nWriting an excellent meeting descriptionÂ\n\nWhen describing your meeting, the goals are similar to naming. You want to get, and keep, the inviteeâs attention. You want to let them know why they were invited and why they should attend. You want them to know how to prepare for the meeting and whatâs going to be expected of them during the meeting. And you want them to know what the group needs to accomplish before the meeting can end. Keep it concise to help them feel reassured that youâre being judicious with their time.Â\n\nGoing forward\n\nFirst step to an effective meeting? Giving it an effective name. A meetingâs title might seem inconsequential, but when done right, it actually offers tons of benefits."
