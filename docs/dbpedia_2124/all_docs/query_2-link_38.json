        "text": "EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is the text of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA)(Pub. L. 88-38), as amended, as it appears in 29 U.S.C. 206(d). The EPA is part of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. Cross references to the codified EPA appear in italics. The EPA prohibits sex-based wage discrimination between men and women in the same establishment who perform jobs that require substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility under similar working conditions.\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\nSEC. 206. [Section 6]\n\n(d) Prohibition of sex discrimination\n\n(1) No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex: Provided, That an employer who is paying a wage rate differential in violation of this subsection shall not, in order to comply with the provisions of this subsection, reduce the wage rate of any employee.\n\n(2) No labor organization, or its agents, representing employees of an employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall cause or attempt to cause such an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of paragraph (1) of this subsection.\n\n(3) For purposes of administration and enforcement, any amounts owing to any employee which have been withheld in violation of this subsection shall be deemed to be unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under this chapter.\n\n(4) As used in this subsection, the term \"labor organization\" means any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.\n\nADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF EQUAL PAY ACT OF 1963\n\nAn Act\n\nTo prohibit discrimination on account of sex in the payment of wages by employers engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.\n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act may be cited as the \"Equal Pay Act of 1963.\"\n\n***\n\nDECLARATION OF PURPOSE\n\nNot Reprinted in U.S. Code [Section 2]\n\n(a) The Congress hereby finds that the existence in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce of wage differentials based on sex-\n\n(1) depresses wages and living standards for employees necessary for their health and efficiency;\n\n(2) prevents the maximum utilization of the available labor\n\nresources;\n\n(3) tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting, and obstructing commerce;\n\n(4) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and\n\n(5) constitutes an unfair method of competition.\n\n(b) It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act, through exercise by Congress of its power to regulate commerce among the several States and with foreign nations, to correct the conditions above referred to in such industries.\n\n[Section 3 of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 amends section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act by adding a new subsection (d). The amendment is incorporated in the revised text of the Fair Labor Standards Act.]\n\nEFFECTIVE DATE\n\nNot Reprinted in U.S. Code [Section 4]\n\nThe amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon the expiration of one year from the date of its enactment: Provided, That in the case of employees covered by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement in effect at least thirty days prior to the date of enactment of this Act entered into by a labor organization (as defined in section 6(d)(4) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended) [subsection (d)(4) of this section], the amendments made by this Act shall take effect upon the termination of such collective bargaining agreement or upon the expiration of two years from the date of enactment of this Act, whichever shall first occur.\n\nApproved June 10, 1963, 12 m.\n\n[In the following excerpts from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, authority given to the Secretary of Labor is exercised by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for purposes of enforcing the Equal Pay Act of 1963.]\n\nATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES\n\nSEC. 209 [Section 9]\n\nFor the purpose of any hearing or investigation provided for in this chapter, the provisions of sections 49 and 50 of title 15 [Federal Trade Commission Act of September 16, 1914, as amended (U.S.C., 1934 edition)] (relating to the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents), are made applicable to the jurisdiction, powers, and duties of the Administrator, the Secretary of Labor, and the industry committees.\n\nCOLLECTION OF DATA\n\nSEC. 211 [Section 11]\n\n(a) Investigations and inspections\n\nThe Administrator or his designated representatives may investigate and gather data regarding the wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment in any industry subject to this chapter, and may enter and inspect such places and such records (and make such transcriptions thereof), question such employees, and investigate such facts, conditions, practices, or matters as he may deem necessary or appropriate to determine whether any person has violated any provision of this chapter, or which may aid in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

The Secretary may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of the unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation and an equal amount as liquidated damages. The right provided by subsection (b) of this section to bring an action by or on behalf of any employee to recover the liability specified in the first sentence of such subsection and of any employee to become a party plaintiff to any such action shall terminate upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary in an action under this subsection in which a recovery is sought of unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under sections 206 and 207 [sections 6 and 7] of this title or liquidated or other damages provided by this subsection owing to such employee by an employer liable under the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, unless such action is dismissed without prejudice on motion of the Secretary.
