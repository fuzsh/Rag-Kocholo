        "text": "By name title on a contract’s signature block is represented as followed:\n\n“By” — the place where a person (often the representative of a company) signs.\n\n“Name” — the name of the entity or person signing the contract.\n\n“Title” — applies to the person and the position that person holds that’s acting on behalf of a company and/or as a representative of another person.\n\nExample:\n\nWhat is “its” in a signature line?\n\n“Its” designates what position the signing person holds at the company in order to give evidence that the signer is authorized to sign on behalf of the company — it carries the same weight as the word “Title” used in the example above.\n\n“Its” and “By” differences on a contract’s signature line\n\n“Its” line is where the person’s title — such as “President” — is inserted.\n\n“By” line is where the person who is signing — in our example Dora Smith — places their signature.\n\n3 scenarios under which a person signs a contract\n\nThere are three scenarios under which a person can sign a contract:\n\nA person signs on their own behalf (personal signature)\n\nA person signs after being granted power of attorney (POA) to act on behalf of someone else or a designated entity (power of attorney signature)\n\nA person with the legal authority to sign on behalf of a business entity (business signature)\n\nPersonal signature\n\nCarrying over our hypothetical example, for a personal signature the “Name” field will be the signer’s name (in our example, Dora Smith) and the “By” field will be the signer’s signature.\n\nBy: (signature)\n\nName: Dora Smith\n\nPower of attorney signature\n\nIn this scenario, if Dora Smithhas authorized David Brook to sign as power of attorney, then David Brook will place a signature in the “By” field and one of these options in the “Name” field:\n\n“David Brook, POA for Dora Smith” or\n\n“David Brook, acting Power of Attorney for Dora Smith“\n\nBusiness signature\n\nWhen Dora Smith represents Company A as President, then:\n\nThe “Name” field will be Company A;\n\nThe “By” field will be Dora Smith and “Title” will be President.\n\nFor example:\n\nCOMPANY A, Inc.\n\nBy: (signature)\n\nName: Dora Smith\n\nTitle: President\n\nHow are signature blocks used to sign a contract’s by name title?\n\nA signature block is a personalized block of text that allows a recipient to get more information about the author or is used to verify the overall legality of contracts.\n\nThese blocks are automatically appended at the bottom of a contract.\n\nExample:\n\nA signature block in contract usually contains the following information:\n\nThe name of the signing person;\n\nCompany name;\n\nThe position held by the signer;\n\nThe function of the signer;\n\nThe date on which the contract was signed;\n\nOther data that the party wants to share (contact info, email address, etc.);\n\nA final line with the signature of the signing person.\n\nCustomize, manage, and eSign contracts with PandaDoc\n\nSigning and managing contracts is often a complex process that requires attention to minor details.\n\nSignature blocks are crucial for most contracts as they work as digital stamps and let the recipient learn more about the author.\n\nError-free and professional-looking contracts require a signer to know where to put their name, their title and to accurately e-sign."
