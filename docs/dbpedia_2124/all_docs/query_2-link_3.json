        "text": "Simply put: no.\n\nAPA's Publication Manual (2020) indicates that, in the body of your paper, you should use italics for the titles of:\n\n\"books, reports, webpages, and other stand-alone works\" (p. 170)\n\nperiodicals (journals, magazines, newspapers)\n\nBeyond APA's specific examples, know that certain types of titles are almost always written in italics.\n\nA general rule of thumb is that within the text of a paper, italicize the title of complete works but put quotation marks around titles of parts within a complete work.\n\nThe table below isn't comprehensive, but it's a good starting point\n\nTitles in Italics Titles Placed in \"Quotation Marks\" Title of a periodical (magazine, journal, newspaper) Title of article in a periodical Title of a book Title of a chapter in a book Title of a movie or play Name of an act or scene in a movie or a play Title of a television or radio series Title of an episode within a tv or radio series Title of a musical album or CD Title of a song Title of a long poem Title of a short poem Names of operas or long musical composition Names of paintings and sculptures\n\nTitle of a short story\n\nOn an APA-style reference page, the rules for titles are a little different. In short, a title you would italicize within the body of a paper will also be italicized on a reference page. However, a title you'd place in quotation marks within the body of the paper (such as the title of an article within a journal) will be written without italics and quotation marks on the references page.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nSmith's (2001) research is fully described in the Journal of Higher Education.\n\nSmith's (2001) article \"College Admissions See Increase\" was published in the Journal of Higher Education after his pivotal study on the admissions process."
