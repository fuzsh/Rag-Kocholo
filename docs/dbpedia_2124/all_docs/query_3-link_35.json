        "text": "If I had a thousand dollar every time someone dropped a name in my meetings, I would be at least half as rich as Adani (minus the shadows of Hindenburgs and SEBIs of the world). Okay, maybe not, but you get the point. Throughout my career, I’ve encountered several situations where, despite honestly communicating my limited bandwidth and inability to take on additional tasks due to existing priorities, individuals have casually dropped influential names to test if my response changes. This phenomenon isn’t exclusive to my role as a product manager; even during my time as a developer, I’ve found myself in such scenarios. Whether viewed as a subtle threat, a calculated strategy, or simply a shot in the dark, ‘Name Dropping’ persists as an age-old tradition that refuses to go out of fashion, regardless of how fragile your organisation’s ‘Agile’ ego is. A small disclaimer: This article doesn’t aim to provide a silver bullet to address this issue. Whether you’re a developer or a manager of any kind, chances are you’ve experienced this, and my goal is to initiate a conversation with those who consider it acceptable to use ‘name dropping’ as a strategic tool to achieve their objectives, and on the sides, also share what I’ve experienced with my fellow survivors.\n\nIt’s not a refusal to help. On the contrary, I’ve tried to extend support often. The more contentious part is the timeline. As product managers, depending on your context, you have your own commitments for the foreseeable future. Another PM in some other part of the world wakes up one fine day and wants something to be taken care of on priority. You of course, try to understand the situation, estimate work involved, and consider your options. In case, it is something you will need to take up eventually, you try to sensitise the requestor about your existing priorities and how you will try to support them when you have some more bandwidth available (say in the next quarter). This is precisely when a name gets dropped to sway you more than you would like to.\n\nThere are severe repercussions of this act. Firstly, it creates a contempt for the requestor because it comes across as an attempt to bulldoze their way devoid of any regard for the established process or the person on the other side. Secondly, and perhaps more dangerously, the seriousness of the matter instantaneously evaporates into thin air. A call for help becomes a matter unworthy of any consideration for the level it’s being discussed at. It is double the shame when a fellow product manager who understands what you are trying to communicate, does this to you.\n\nIt goes like this , “I was hoping to manage it locally. If not, I can reach out to your ‘Big Brother’ to see if we can prioritize this”. Most of the time, I’ve responded to such behaviour by sharing my appreciation for this ‘novel’ idea. If it’s just being used as a strategic tool to disturb your gait, it’s more likely to happen over a call instead of email. Almost in 100% of such situations, I have with all sincerity, suggested they go ahead and use the option if they wanted to. Almost every time, they have neither reached out to my Big Brother, nor have they come back to me. However, I have met individuals who have sheepishly tried to strike a camaraderie after noticing their missile failing to hit the target. A palpable shift in the tone and tenor of the conversation is almost always immediate. It may be that the requestor is being sincere, and the request indeed needs immediate attention. In such cases, it’s still a good idea to send them to Big Brother for a round of negotiation so that you can get the opportunity to socialise the impact this new scope would have on the existing priorities.\n\nAs a requestor, if your requirement is too important to get sacrificed at the altar of ‘name dropping’, perhaps forging a healthy working relationship is the only approach that works. Mutual respect, getting the perspective of the other side, and being patient with your request will work better than the strongarming method. If you’re under tremendous pressure, please consider letting your Big Brother know about the situation and draw a line before you find yourself wanting to name drop. If it’s important enough, you won’t have to break your head alone and your request will find its way to my backlog in some other, more humane ways."
