        "text": "Welcome to the Purdue OWL\n\nThis page is brought to you by the OWL at Purdue University. When printing this page, you must include the entire legal notice.\n\nCopyright ©1995-2018 by The Writing Lab & The OWL at Purdue and Purdue University. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, reproduced, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed without permission. Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our terms and conditions of fair use.\n\nAccording to MLA style, you must have a Works Cited page at the end of your research paper. All entries in the Works Cited page must correspond to the works cited in your main text.\n\nBasic rules\n\nBegin your Works Cited page on a separate page at the end of your research paper. It should have the same one-inch margins and last name, page number header as the rest of your paper.\n\nLabel the page Works Cited (do not italicize the words Works Cited or put them in quotation marks) and center the words Works Cited at the top of the page.\n\nOnly the title should be centered. The citation entries themselves should be aligned with the left margin.\n\nDouble space all citations, but do not skip spaces between entries.\n\nIndent the second and subsequent lines of citations by 0.5 inches to create a hanging indent.\n\nList page numbers of sources efficiently, when needed. If you refer to a journal article that appeared on pages 225 through 250, list the page numbers on your Works Cited page as pp. 225-50 (Note: MLA style dictates that you should omit the first sets of repeated digits. In our example, the digit in the hundreds place is repeated between 225 and 250, so you omit the 2 from 250 in the citation: pp. 225-50). If the excerpt spans multiple pages, use “pp.” Note that MLA style uses a hyphen in a span of pages.\n\nIf only one page of a print source is used, mark it with the abbreviation “p.” before the page number (e.g., p. 157). If a span of pages is used, mark it with the abbreviation “pp.” before the page number (e.g., pp. 157-68).\n\nIf you're citing an article or a publication that was originally issued in print form but that you retrieved from an online database, you should type the online database name in italics. You do not need to provide subscription information in addition to the database name.\n\nFor online sources, you should include a location to show readers where you found the source. Many scholarly databases use a DOI (digital object identifier). Use a DOI in your citation if you can; otherwise use a URL. Delete “http://” from URLs. The DOI or URL is usually the last element in a citation and should be followed by a period.\n\nAll works cited entries end with a period.\n\nAdditional basic rules new to MLA 2021\n\nNew to MLA 2021:\n\nApps and databases should be cited only when they are containers of the particular works you are citing, such as when they are the platforms of publication of the works in their entirety, and not an intermediary that redirects your access to a source published somewhere else, such as another platform. For example, the Philosophy Books app should be cited as a container when you use one of its many works, since the app contains them in their entirety. However, a PDF article saved to the Dropbox app is published somewhere else, and so the app should not be cited as a container.\n\nIf it is important that your readers know an author’s/person’s pseudonym, stage-name, or various other names, then you should generally cite the better-known form of author’s/person’s name. For example, since the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is better-known by his pseudonym, cite Lewis Carroll opposed to Charles Dodgson (real name).\n\nFor annotated bibliographies, annotations should be appended at the end of a source/entry with one-inch indentations from where the entry begins. Annotations may be written as concise phrases or complete sentences, generally not exceeding one paragraph in length.\n\nCapitalization and punctuation\n\nCapitalize each word in the titles of articles, books, etc, but do not capitalize articles (the, an), prepositions, or conjunctions unless one is the first word of the title or subtitle: Gone with the Wind, The Art of War, There Is Nothing Left to Lose.\n\nUse italics (instead of underlining) for titles of larger works (books, magazines) and quotation marks for titles of shorter works (poems, articles)\n\nListing author names\n\nEntries are listed alphabetically by the author's last name (or, for entire edited collections, editor names). Author names are written with the last name first, then the first name, and then the middle name or middle initial when needed:\n\nBurke, Kenneth\n\nLevy, David M.\n\nWallace, David Foster\n\nDo not list titles (Dr., Sir, Saint, etc.) or degrees (PhD, MA, DDS, etc.) with names. A book listing an author named \"John Bigbrain, PhD\" appears simply as \"Bigbrain, John.\" Do, however, include suffixes like \"Jr.\" or \"II.\" Putting it all together, a work by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would be cited as \"King, Martin Luther, Jr.\" Here the suffix following the first or middle name and a comma.\n\nMore than one work by an author\n\nIf you have cited more than one work by a particular author, order the entries alphabetically by title, and use three hyphens in place of the author's name for every entry after the first:\n\nBurke, Kenneth. A Grammar of Motives. [...]\n\n---. A Rhetoric of Motives. [...]\n\nWhen an author or collection editor appears both as the sole author of a text and as the first author of a group, list solo-author entries first:\n\nHeller, Steven, ed. The Education of an E-Designer.\n\nHeller, Steven, and Karen Pomeroy. Design Literacy: Understanding Graphic Design.\n\nWork with no known author\n\nAlphabetize works with no known author by their title; use a shortened version of the title in the parenthetical citations in your paper. In this case, Boring Postcards USA has no known author:\n\nBaudrillard, Jean. Simulacra and Simulations. [...]\n\nBoring Postcards USA [...]\n\nBurke, Kenneth. A Rhetoric of Motives. [...]\n\nWork by an author using a pseudonym or stage-name\n\nNew to MLA 9th edition, there are now steps to take for citing works by an author or authors using a pseudonym, stage-name, or different name.\n\nIf the person you wish to cite is well-known, cite the better-known form of the name of the author. For example, since Lewis Carroll is not only a pseudonym of Charles Dodgson, but also the better-known form of the author’s name, cite the former name opposed to the latter.\n\nIf the real name of the author is less well-known than their pseudonym, cite the author’s pseudonym in square brackets following the citation of their real name: “Christie, Agatha [Mary Westmacott].”\n\nAuthors who published various works under many names may be cited under a single form of the author’s name. When the form of the name you wish to cite differs from that which appears on the author’s work, include the latter in square brackets following an italicized published as: “Irving, Washington [published as Knickerbocker, Diedrich].”.\n\nAnother acceptable option, in cases where there are only two forms of the author’s name, is to cite both forms of the author’s names as separate entries along with cross-references in square brackets: “Eliot, George [see also Evans, Mary Anne].”."
