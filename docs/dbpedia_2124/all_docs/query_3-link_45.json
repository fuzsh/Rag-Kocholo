        "text": "A man has shared his heartache after having to use a 'fake' name for years because strangers mock his real name. He shared how he has been going by Patrick for years - but is now considering asking his boss to refer to him by his 'real name' - Sascha.\n\nSpeaking on Reddit, he said: \"I decided to go by my birth name at work which I am anxious about. The first two days I went by my middle name, but I'm dreading having to correct everyone now at work which I'm going to be embarrassed about. Does anyone have any advice? I'm dreading Monday because of this. I'm also worried I'll get laughed at and fired.\"\n\nIn a heartbreaking update, he shared how everyone started \"mocking\" him for his name - making him regret his initial decision to use it. He added: \"I started going by Sascha, but people have started to mock me again. I think I might quit the job.\n\n\"In the past, I have said that Sascha is my nickname or I usually just say I have a double-barrelled first name. When I think I've decided what to do I wake up the next day and start thinking about it again. I think what would be easier for me is probably just going by my middle and most of the time and first name some of the other rare times for family occasions and such.\"\n\nCommenting on his post, one user said: \"In the UK, Sascha is known to be unisex, especially with a 'c' in it and you seem to be really overthinking this and overblowing it. People won't laugh at you because they're grown-ups and I literally can't imagine how you could get fired over this.\" In agreement, another user added: \"Yes, my first thought is Sacha Baron Cohen and he is very manly.\"\n\nA third user said: \"My roommate in college introduced herself to me as Diane (her middle name). I later found out that literally everyone else called her Margaret (her first name)! She changed her mind about what she wanted to go by after meeting me the first day. It was such a non-issue. She just said 'can you actually call me Margaret instead? I decided I wanted to start going by my first name.' I was totally happy to oblige.\""
