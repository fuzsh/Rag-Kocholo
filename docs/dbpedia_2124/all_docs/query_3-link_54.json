        "text": "It's always worth bearing in mind Jakob's Law of the Internet User Experience:\n\nUsers spend most of their time on other sites.\n\nThis is where your competitor analysis comes in. You should already have a reasonable understanding of the main competitors to your client. What are they using? If half-a-dozen competitors are all using 'Jobs' and you then recommend to your client to break with this established route and go with 'Careers' instead then you're going to have a harder time convincing the client that you are correct and everyone else is wrong.\n\nHowever, if the competitors are all currently using 'Careers' then you can use that as supporting evidence to take to the client to show them \"Careers is what the target-market is expecting this area to be called based on {these competitors} sites\"\n\nFinally, it's also worth remembering that the client is paying you to put this together. There is only so much advice you can part before you just have to suck it up and go along with what they request.\n\n(This is coming from someone who is constantly fighting a losing battle against new clients adding in a 'Our Solutions' menu option to their websites.)\n\nI can't give you data to back up which one is easier perceived by users, but my gut tells me that your third option 'working-with-client-name' is not the way to go based on what we learn about simplicity in design - as well as the awesome example posted from Steve Krug's book.\n\nNow the tricky part: Careers vs Jobs. Have you asked your client why they want to do that?\n\nThere may be an underlying reason why they have chosen to go this route - like a stategy, branding decision or maybe just the way they want communicate through the touch points in which they interact with people on their site.\n\nMaybe it will help to give direction if you look at the meaning of the two words: Career vs Job.\n\nJob\n\nA job is a regular activity performed in exchange for payment. - Wikipedia\n\nAdjective noun: a piece of work, especially a specific task done as part of the routine of one's occupation or for an agreed price: She gave him the job of mowing the lawn. - Dictionary.com\n\nCareer\n\nCareer is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as a person's \"course or progress through life (or a distinct portion of life)\". - Wikipedia\n\nNoun: an occupation or profession, especially one requiring special training, followed as one's lifework: He sought a career as a lawyer. - Dictionary.com\n\nBased on this there is a clear distinction in the message the two words that it sends where a career feels like a long term path.\n\nIt also depends very much on the context of where this link will be placed where the word jobs can mean 1. Jobs - as in career opportunities or 2. Jobs - availble as in contracts for freelancers or 3. Jobs - as in portfolio of work that has been done by the company. You get the idea of what I am trying to illustrate around the context of the words.\n\nThe best way to get to a solution is to conduct a small A/B usability test around the information architecture where you can ask the relevant users to tell you what they expect happens when they would click on a link called 'Careers' and the second group 'Jobs' and then measure the outcome.\n\nYou can also during this test ask the user afterwards through a labeling test exercise which word they prefer.\n\nAll this of course is not based on actual data, but more on the principals of design and heuristics of simplicity which all point to speaking the user's language so that they understand what you mean. In that itself there is another problem which was mentioned earlier, that this means the user's language is different to their context of where they live (UK, USA, France).\n\nIn the end the best data you will get is from testing it with some of the users that will be on the site.\n\nHope that helps to give you some direction.\n\nRelevant Links:\n\nWikipedia's Definition of Job: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job\n\nDictionary.com's Definition of Job: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/job\n\nWikipedia's Definition of Career: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career\n\nDictionary.com's Definition of Career: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/career\n\nTen Usability Heuristics by Jakob Nielsen: http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html\n\nI actually agree with your clients here, because \"Jobs\" - at least in my areas and country - is what I am looking for if I want to work with them. However people-focused, career-orientated and mission-driven the company is, at the end of the day, most people have a job and just get on with it. It may turn into a long-term relationship, with career progression, but that is not the focus at the start.\n\n\"Career\" sounds to me like you are wanting to take on new graduates and help them in starting their career. That is not me, so maybe I am not interested.\n\n\"Work for/with us\" is OK depending on the size of company. If it is a small, friendly company, then this can work. If it is a large impersonal place, then there is a disconnect, and it puts me off.\n\nAs Krug quoted by @User12999 states, make it simple, make it obvious. It may not fit in with the companys image of itself, but that is not who it is designed for. It needs to fit with the visitors expectations."
