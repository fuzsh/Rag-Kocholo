        "text": "When you buy a vehicle, you need to transfer the vehicle’s title to establish yourself as the new legal owner.\n\nYou may need to enable third-party cookies in your browser settings for this application.\n\nAny change of the current registered owner or lienholder (legal owner) of a vehicle or vessel/boat requires transferring the title to the new owner. Transfer of ownership between the seller and the buyer must be started with DMV within 10 days of the sale of the vehicle or boat. You will need:\n\nThe California Certificate of Title.\n\nSignature(s) of the seller(s), buyer(s), and lienholder (if applicable).\n\nTransfer fees. All transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer.\n\nOnce you start the online Title Transfer process, a DMV Virtual Assistant will let you know if you also need:\n\nSmog certification\n\nUse tax and/or various other fees.\n\nApplication for Replacement or Transfer of Title (REG 227) form.\n\nA Vehicle/Vessel Transfer and Reassignment (REG 262) form.\n\nA Statement of Facts (REG 256) form.\n\nA Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability (REG 138) form.\n\nOther less commonly used forms.\n\nThe example below indicates where to complete the current California Certificate of Title.\n\nFRONT OF TITLE: Current registered owner or legal owner (Lienholder) signs and dates here to release ownership. If you are changing legal ownership by removing or deleting a Lienholder, the current registered owner(s) does not sign line 1A/1B and does not complete lines 3A-13.\n\nBACK OF TITLE: New lienholder’s name (such as a bank or other financial institution), if any, is printed here.\n\nHTVR 32 (REV. 6/2022)\n\nA vehicle can be registered in the name of a trust as registered owners. The purchasers would enter the name of the trust as the new registered owner on the back of the title with one of the trustees signing for the trust. When the transfer of ownership is processed, it would be processed just like a vehicle being registered in a company’s name vs. an individual as owner.\n\nA vehicle or vessel may be owned by two or more co-owners. Co-owner names may be joined by “and”, “and/or”, or “or”. Certificates issued for applications not indicating “and” or “or” between the names will show “and” as represented by a slash (/) between the names.\n\nAll owners must endorse the title or registration application to register the vehicle or boat, but the requirements for releasing ownership vary.\n\nThe signature of only one owner is required to transfer ownership when the co-owner names are joined by “and/or” or “or”.\n\nThe signatures of all owners are required to transfer ownership when the co-owner names are joined by “and”. Ownership passes to the surviving co-owner upon the death of a co-owner or, with the surviving co-owner’s release, to a new owner. A deceased co-owner’s interest may only be released by one of the following:\n\nHeir of the deceased with an Affidavit for Transfer Without Probate California Titled Vehicle or Vessels Only (REG 5) form.\n\nAdministrator with Letters of Administration.\n\nExecutor with Letters Testamentary.\n\nSubmit the following to DMV:\n\nA California Certificate of Title or, if lost, an Application for Replacement or Transfer of Title (REG 227) form, signed for the decedent and countersigned by the heir. Example: John Jones by Mary S. Jones, sole heir, successor, administrator, executor, conservator, guardian, or trustee.\n\nDocument authorizing transfer of the decedent’s vehicle/vessel:\n\nAffidavit for Transfer Without Probate California Titled Vehicle or Vessels Only (REG 5) form completed by the heir. A power of attorney (POA) cannot be used to sign a REG 5.\n\nCourt order, Letters Testamentary, Letters of Administration, Letters of Administration with Will Annexed, or Letters of Special Administration.\n\nA REG 256 with the applicable sections completed.\n\nAn odometer disclosure statement for vehicles less than 10 years old completed on the California Certificate of Title or Vehicle/Vessel Transfer and Reassignment Form (REG 262) (not available online).\n\nFees for transfer of ownership and, if due, registration renewal and use tax.\n\nTransfer Without Probate\n\nIn certain situations, the decedent’s heir may transfer title of a vehicle/vessel without going through probate. Requirements are:\n\nA REG 5 completed by one of the following:\n\nPerson(s) who succeeded to the property of the decedent.\n\nConservator or guardian of the property of the person(s) who succeeded to the property of the decedent.\n\nBeneficiary under the decedent’s last will and testament.\n\nTrustee(s), under a trust agreement by the deceased, in which the primary beneficiaries are the next of kin.\n\nThe value of the decedent’s property in California does not exceed $150,000.\n\nDoes not include vehicles, vessels, commercial coaches, or manufactured, mobile, or floating homes. To calculate the property value, see California Probate Code §13050.\n\nThe vehicle/vessel is titled in California. Vehicles/vessels titled in another state must be transferred in that state (requirements may differ from California).\n\n40 days have lapsed since the registered or legal owner’s date of death.\n\nAn original or certified copy of each owner’s death certificate and, if owned jointly by two or more decedent’s, a REG 5 for the most recent decedent\n\nIf owned jointly by two or more persons and one is deceased, a REG 5 cannot be used to circumvent the surviving owner’s interest. However, the surviving owner (if an heir) may complete a REG 5 to release the decedent’s interest. The title must be signed twice, once by the surviving owner and once on behalf of the decedent.\n\nTrust Transfers\n\nEstablishment of a trust commits the property or assets of an individual(s) to a trustee for use or safekeeping.\n\nA releasing signature for a trust cannot be made by power of attorney, unless the power of attorney document is restricted to a specific transaction.\n\nIf more than one trustee is shown without “or,” or a slash (/) between the names, each trustee must sign the title.\n\nIf the trustee signing is not shown on the title, a REG 256 (Section G) is required attesting to his/her appointment as successor trustee by the trustor or retiring trustee.\n\nIf a trustee releases interest of a vehicle/vessel not registered to a trust, ownership is determined by the decedent’s will as contained in the trust document. The trust document and REG 262 copies may be required.\n\nIf no trustee name is shown on the title, a REG 256 (Section G) is required attesting to his/her appointment as trustee or successor trustee by the trustor.\n\nTransfer With Court Documents\n\nThe Certificate of Title must be signed for the decedent and countersigned by the executor or administrator.\n\nOnce the buyer has all the required documentation and DMV receives the completed Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability from the seller, the seller’s part of the sale is complete. Once the buyer provides DMV with all the proper documents and fees, and all the requirements are met (for example, smog certification), the vehicle record is updated to reflect the change of ownership (the seller’s name is removed) and a registration card is issued to the new owner. A new title is issued within 10-15 calendar days."
