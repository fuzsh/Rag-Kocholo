        "text": "Do you know when to use quotation marks for titles? Knowing whether to use italics or quotation marks for titles is one of the most common problems students have, especially when it comes to academic writing where you discuss your sources. Luckily, there are consistent themes that can help you pick the right format for each title, no matter what style guide you’re following.\n\nBelow, we explain exactly when to use quotation marks in titles (and when to use italics instead). We’ll cover the title rules for the three main style guides—APA, MLA, and Chicago—and give you some guidelines for figuring out which kinds of titles use which format.\n\nHow to properly quote a title with quotation marks\n\nQuotation marks (“ ”) are mostly for showing speech or copying passages verbatim from other works, but sometimes they’re used for more than just punctuation. For certain types of works, they’re used to set apart titles.\n\nThe general rule is to use quotation marks for titles of short works such as articles, poems, songs, essays, or short stories. By contrast, use italics for larger works such as books, movies, and the names of periodicals. We provide a complete list below.\n\nWhen to use italics or quotation marks for titles\n\nSome types of work italicize titles, and some use quotation marks, but how do you know which is which? Here’s a quick list of what kinds of works use each.\n\nWorks that use quotation marks in titles\n\njournal articles\n\nnewspaper and magazine articles\n\nblog and online news articles\n\nessay titles\n\npoems (except epic poems)\n\nshort stories\n\nsongs\n\nchapters\n\nlectures\n\nepisode titles of TV shows, podcasts, and other serial works\n\npage titles for websites\n\nsection or part titles within a larger work\n\nshort-form videos, such as those on YouTube\n\nExamples of titles with quotation marks\n\nJournal:\n\n“A Policy Framework for the Growing Influence of Private Equity on Health Care Deliver”\n\n(Journal of the American Medical Association)\n\nNewspaper:\n\n“Sonoma County Board of Supervisors to consider sewer rate increase”\n\n(The Press Democrat)\n\n“E.U.

Here’s a quick rundown of when to use quotation marks in titles for the APA, MLA, and Chicago styles.\n\nQuotations marks in titles for APA\n\nThe APA format follows the list above: It uses quotation marks for all types of work mentioned. The only particular rule they have about quotation marks in titles is that they are not used in the reference list for articles and chapters.\n\nIn APA, the reference list is the name of the bibliography, like a works cited page. When writing a full citation that mentions an article or book chapter, simply write the title with neither quotation marks nor italics. However, if the same title is written within the text (or in a copyright attribution), use quotation marks.\n\nQuotations marks in titles for Chicago\n\nIn general, Chicago style follows the list above. It does, nevertheless, list a few extra types of works that the other style guides do not.\n\nQuotation marks for titles:\n\nfairy tales and nursery rhymes\n\nItalics for titles:\n\npamphlets\n\nmaps\n\nserialized cartoons and comic strips\n\nQuotations marks in titles for MLA\n\nThe use of quotation marks in titles for MLA format is very straightforward. Simply use the appropriate format for the type of work, as indicated in the large list above.\n\nWhen to use single or double quotation marks for titles\n\nThere are two types of quotation marks: single quotation marks (‘ ’) and double quotation marks (“ ”).\n\nIn general, American English uses double quotation marks. The only time we use single quotation marks for titles is to replace quotation marks within another pair of quotation marks.\n\nFor example, if you were writing an article about Langston Hughes’s poems—highlighting “Harlem” in particular—the title of your article might be something like this:\n\n“Reflections on ‘Harlem’ and Other Poems”\n\nNotice how, when we talk about the poem “Harlem” on its own, we use the standard double quotation marks. However, when we mention it within another pair of quotation marks, we use single quotation marks instead.\n\nThis is done simply for the sake of clarity. It would be confusing to use double quotation marks within double quotation marks, so this makes reading a bit easier. Let’s look at another example:\n\nEPISODE TITLE: “The Winds of Winter” (episode of Game of Thrones)\n\nESSAY TITLE: “Why ‘The Winds of Winter’ Is the Best Episode of Game of Thrones”\n\nKeep in mind that if a title in quotation marks is used within an italicized title, double quotation marks are used. For example, look at how we write the title of a full book that collects Roald Dahl’s short stories:\n\n“The Landlady” and Other Short Stories\n\nIt’s also worth noting that this is only the convention in American English. In British English, single quotes and double quotes are switched! That means titles and speech quotes use single quotation marks most of the time and double quotation marks are used only within single quotes. Keep that in mind if you’re ever reading a British piece of writing.\n\nQuotation marks for titles FAQs\n\nWhy use quotation marks for titles?\n\nQuotation marks set apart the titles of short works like articles, poems, songs, essays, or short stories. Longer works like books or movies use italics instead.\n\nWhen do you use quotation marks for titles?\n\nUse quotation marks for the titles of articles, essays, poems, short stories, songs, chapters, lectures, pages for websites, episodes of serial works (such as TV shows or podcasts), names of sections or parts in larger works, and short-form videos such as those on YouTube.\n\nWhen do you use italics?\n\nUse italics for the titles of books, movies, plays, TV shows, podcasts, video games, apps, classic art (like paintings and sculptures), music albums, legal cases, dissertations, anthologies, reports, periodicals (like magazines or newspapers), operas and long musical compositions, and large vehicles (like ships or aircraft)."
