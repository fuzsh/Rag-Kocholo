However, if you have purchased a vehicle from an individual, the documents must be submitted to the tax office in person or by mail. Submit to the county of the buyer or lien holder. The buyer, seller, or lienholder may submit the appropriate documents for the title transfer. If the seller (other than the dealer) or lienholder are submitting the paperwork, they must also provide a Permission Letter from the buyer and an acceptable form of ID for the buyer.\n\nTo transfer a Texas titled vehicle, bring in or mail the following to our offices:\n\n1. Texas title, signed and dated by the seller(s) and buyer(s). If the vehicle is less than 20 years old, the odometer reading must be completed\n\nfor most vehicles.

VTR-130U (Application for Texas title), signed and dated by the seller(s) and buyer(s). The form can be found under the Forms tab on the\n\nTexas Department of Motor Vehicles (TxDMV) website.

Determine if there is a Texas title or an Out of State title and follow the corresponding list above. A certified copy of the Divorce Decree may be used in lieu of a Texas title (not out of state titles) if there was no lien showing on the face of the title. You may sell the vehicle without transferring the vehicle to your name if the vehicle is specified and awarded to you by the court. Title and registration fees will apply. Motor vehicle sales tax is not due for community property transfers.\n\nA properly assigned title is required if the Divorce Decree does not award the vehicle to you. You are required to transfer the vehicle to your name before selling the vehicle. Title and registration fees will apply. Motor vehicle sales tax may be due unless the vehicle was community property.\n\nContact us by email or a TxDMV Regional Service Center for additional assistance. You may also visit any one of our eight locations.\n\nHow do I sell a vehicle that is titled in my late spouse's name?\n\nDetermine whether there is a will, trust, etc.\n\n1. If there is no will, or the will is not and will not be probated, we can accept one of the following in lieu of a Texas title:\n\nCertified copy of the Muniment of Title issued by the Probate Court and certified copy of the will filed with the Muniment of Title, OR\n\nVTR-262 Heirship Affidavit (Find this form under the Forms tab on the TxDMV website)\n\nIf there is a lien on the record, a lien release is also required. However, if a lien is to be carried forward to the buyer (or family member taking\n\nownership of the vehicle), then one of the documents listed above (Muniment of Title or Heirship Affidavit) is required in addition to the\n\noriginal title. The title is not required to be signed by anyone as seller. Please note: The original title is required if there is more than\n\none owner listed on the title that is still living, and that person must sign the title as seller.\n\n2. If there is a will, and it was probated, we can accept the following in lieu of a title:\n\nLetters of Testamentary issued by the Probate Court and a Bill of Sale to the buyer.\n\nIf there is a lien on the record, a lien release is also required. However, if a lien is to be carried forward to the buyer (or family member taking\n\nownership of the vehicle), then the original title is required and must be signed by the Executor or Executrix as seller. Please note: The original\n\ntitle is required if there is more than one owner listed on the title that is still living, and that person must sign the title as seller along with the\n\nExecutor/Executrix.\n\n3. If there is a trust document, a copy of the trust is required, or an Affidavit of Trust signed by the Trustee. If there is a lien on the record, a lien release is required. The trust document is not used in lieu of the title, but it gives authority to someone signing on behalf of the deceased owner."
