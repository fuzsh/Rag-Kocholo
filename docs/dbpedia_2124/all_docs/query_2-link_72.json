        "text": "A reference list entry generally has four elements: the author, date, title, and source. Each element answers a question:\n\nauthor: Who is responsible for this work?\n\ndate: When was this work published?\n\ntitle: What is this work called?\n\nsource: Where can I retrieve this work?\n\nAnswering these four questions will help you create a reference entry for any type of work, even if you do not see a specific example in the Publication Manual that matches it. Consistency in reference formatting allows readers to understand the types of works you consulted and the important reference elements with ease.\n\nTo learn more about content and format of the author, date, title, and source, visit the page on reference elements.\n\nThis figure shows the first page of a journal article. The locations of the reference elements are highlighted with different colors and callouts, and the same colors are used in the reference list entry to show how the entry corresponds to the source.\n\nAdditionally, the in-text citation for a work corresponds to the reference list entry. For example, the in-text citation for the work in the example is Botto and Rochat (2018) or (Botto & Rochat, 2018).\n\nView the reference examples to see the basic principles of references in action.\n\nSome works contain suggested citations. These citations often contain the information necessary to write an APA Style reference but need editing for style. For example, you may need to change the capitalization of the title or the punctuation between elements. You may also need to put elements in the proper order of author, date, title, and source."
