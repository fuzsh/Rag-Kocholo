        "text": "In iTunes now where the song title box is, there is now something called work name that you label your song titles as well. This appears new. My songs are labelled correctly in iTunes under song title but when I import into my iPhone, the song title is wrong and default to the artists name unless I manually change it in the work name field on my phone. How can I fix my songs as they displayed right for years in all my previous iPhones and now it looks like a mess. I don't have time to re-label 10,000 songs especially since they appear correct in iTunes.\n\nHi Soctheo,\n\nThis new \"work\" field is meant mostly for classical music collectors, to provide some extra tagging options. It sounds like in your case it has really messed things up, somehow.\n\nHere's something to test. In iTunes, select a track (or a batch of tracks) so that they're highlighted. Try to find tracks that are giving you problems, if you can. Then open the Get Info window (from the Edit menu or by tying Command-I). Near the top, there's a check box labeled \"Use work and movement.\" If that's checked, then definitely un-check it. If it's not checked, that's more of a puzzle. You might try checking it ON, closing the window, then opening it again and checking the box OFF â€” this is meant to force iTunes to recognize the change.\n\nTheoretically, you could process your entire library in one batch this way, if the process seems to fix anything.\n\nMaybe somebody else will have a more expert solution."
