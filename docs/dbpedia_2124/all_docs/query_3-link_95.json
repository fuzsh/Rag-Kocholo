Or if there is any other application that serves the purpose, please let me know.\n\n\"shwm\" is the id3tag written for m4a.\n\nI am sure same field is used in mp3 also. I updated two mp3s, one with movement and one with song info in mac and copied the files to windows. iTunes in windows showed the song info on one file and movement on another file.\n\nThis is clearly shows, \"shwm\" field is also written in mp3.\n\nPlease verify the mediainfo output in my previous post, it clearly shows, \"shwm\" is written to m4a.\n\nOne check. In iTunes, you have to write some info to movement and work, and most importantly leave the song at movement toggle and close the song. then review the file.\n\nIf you write in the movement and work fields and set the song back to song. iTunes will not write \"shwm\" field. It either writes \"shwm\"=1 for movement or nothing for song display.\n\nIf you need I can upload 2 m4a's and 2 mp3's, one each in different condition.\n\nAs soon as it is out, I verify the work and grouping fields are independent. I will report it here.\n\nThank you for updating the mp3tag with new fields and also keeping it free. It deserves donation for sure."
