        "text": "Hi Khusro,\n\nIn order to comply with Upwork Terms of Service, you will need to use only truthful and real information about yourself including your name and your profile picture. That said, you can choose to display only your first name and your last name initial or even make your profile private in your Profile Settings. If your profile is private, only clients whose jobs you applied for would be able to see it.\n\n~ Valeria\n\nHi Sultan,\n\nThe comment you're responding to was published several years ago. There have been some changes since then and now all freelancer profiles will only show first name and second initial publicly by default. It is not possible to show full name publicly anymore. The clients you're interviewing or working with will be able to see your full name.\n\n~ Valeria\n\nHi,\n\nPlease help me about this case.\n\nMy name is Md Sohanur Rahman Sajib.\n\nI'm using Md Sajib on Upwork.\n\nThis is not that my name is fake, I'm just using my short name.\n\nCan I continue using my short name?\n\nIf yes, then how can I transfer my funds to the local bank.\n\nWaiting for the answer.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nhi mam,\n\nhow are you doing ? i hope so your are doing well.\n\nPlease help me about in this case.\n\nMy name is md yousuf ali. .\n\nI was using morris a. lomali ( morris ali lomali which is my nickname )on Upwork.\n\nrecently i have changed it by my main name which is md yousuf ali.\n\nThis is not that my name is fake, I'm just using my nickname.\n\nam i did any kind of violations against upwork?\n\nCan you check my whole account am i did anything wrong or enything else? i am almost new on upwork. i need your help.plzzzz\n\ni dont want to kick off from upwork .\n\nWaiting for the answer.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nHi Valeria,\n\nI love most upwork's values in all freelancer sites because it is reliable, fast and friendly. Escrow time perfect unlike others!\n\nI sent too much proposals within two months but I could get two jobs and I finished them very successfully. , A client from the USA and the other from England but they just living there. I work in many different areas from illustration to animation. But \"nickname subject\" is very serious.\n\nMy real name is Ibrahim. I see people come to name, not only to the skill.\n\nI have a hourly account with a nickname on another populer freelancer site. Everyday I'm taking job offering from USA, UK, Canada and Australia even my price is expensive. Yes they like my illustrations and animations but they trust more to my nickname not real name. OMG! This may be touchy!\n\nYou should review this topic as soon as possible. No doubt, this is a very sensitive matter:)\n\nKind Regards,\n\nibrahim **Edited for Community Guidelines**\n\nHello!\n\nRegarding the withdrawing funds from PayPal, is it possible, as an exception, to create a paypal account and link it to a family member`s debit card to use it for upwork? Would it be enough to just set the family member`s email address (which will be used for upwork) that will match the paypal`s account in this case?\n\nIt won`t be possible in my current situation to create a paypal account linked to my debit card and that`s why I`m hoping there to be some exceptions to it.\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nJaclin M wrote:\n\nHello!\n\nRegarding the withdrawing funds from PayPal, is it possible, as an exception, to create a paypal account and link it to a family member`s debit card to use it for upwork?

If you want to work on Upwork, you will need a certain amount of visibility to begin with and all your accounts need to be in your real name.\n\nYou can have any nickname you like for your user name, but you have to have your own and verifiable name for everything else. Sooner or later Upwork will ask for identity verification.\n\nHello!\n\nBy choosing to set my profile on priviate, would that mean that people who are not Upwork members (client or freelancer) can`t find me?\n\nAlso, there has been mentioned that clients on upwork can`t find you unless you`ve applied for their jobs. Recently, I have been \"found\" by a prospective client, who is interested in collaborating with me. In this case, what would be the guarantee that I cannot be found by non-upwork members?\n\nThank you!\n\nJust an additional point. I suggest that you read up on the forum and on the Upwork blog. Generally, it's not too difficult to recognize and avoid scammers here. It might be good to find out some of the warning signs and common giveaways so that you can protect yourself and ease your mind a bit too\n\nAs a general principle, I don't think there is anything wrong with using a fake name or nickname or pseudonym on a website, or with using an avatar photo or no photo at all.\n\nThese are not acceptable options on Upwork, but there are other websites that allow you to do this.\n\nIf you don't want to us your real name or photo, then it makes sense to find and use websites where these \"more private\" and \"less transparent\" options are available.\n\nNo harm comes to Upwork freelancers because scammers can see their real names or see their photos.\n\nI would suggest that the original poster's real name and photo are already online in many places, on various social media sites, websites, public information site, etc. I don't want to belittle his concerns, but I think he actualy has nothing to fear from having his real name and photo on Upwork.\n\nHarm comes to Upwork freelancers when they make bad decisions and do things scammers ask them to do which violate either:\n\na) common sense\n\nb) Upwork rules\n\nor\n\nc) both\n\nYou are right Preston, it's probably easy to find me elsewhere, however common sense is not always obvious sometimes. I guess I should do more of what Nia said and go read up on the tell tale signs, etc and what to look out for.\n\nThat's not necessarily true.\n\nMy last name is rather unique, and because of this I've not used it on most social sites.\n\nYou can't find me on FB, nor my picture.\n\nEven in my Full time job most people call be my a nickname, because there are like 5 guys named Dave.\n\nYears ago I registered for a website with a fake name. I still get calls for investing in gold or buying solar pannels, with that name.\n\nMore over, sometimes someone might want to start freelancing while working full time, and they might not want their boss to find out they're on upwork.\n\n“Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.” – Austin Freeman\n\nre: \"I've looked through quite a few of the jobs posts and some of them really don't present themselves very well. I guess I should just avoid such posts as a general rule?\"\n\nDifferent freelancers have different preferences regarding job postings that they apply to.\n\nSome freelancers have become practiced in applying to and earning money from job postings which are vague or poorly written. But that's not for everybody.\n\nFeel free to ignore any postings that don't meet your own personal preferences. Leave those jobs for others. There are plenty of freelancers on Upwork to handle the diversity of job postings that are available here."
