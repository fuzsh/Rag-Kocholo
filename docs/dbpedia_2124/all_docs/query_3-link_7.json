Just a group of hands put together with a chant “Go, us!”.\n\nSafe to say that team names are super important — in team sports, but also in the workplace.\n\nNothing will give your team a sense of belonging and inspire them to work together as a team name. It’s something personal to them that they can take pride in with every accomplishment they achieve.\n\nThinking of one though — that’s a different story. It can be painstaking, frustrating, and sometimes, it feels downright impossible.\n\nWe’re here to inspire you, by sharing some of the most unique team names we could compile.\n\nTry out our team name generator to quickly find a suitable name.\n\nAnd read our list below.\n\n10 Ultimate team names for work\n\nBefore we show you the full list of the work team names we’ve gathered, we’d like to introduce you to our personal top 10.

However, there are some things to be wary of when naming your work team:\n\nMind what’s work-appropriate — your team name isn’t for your team’s eyes only. It’ll likely be seen by other members of the company as well. So, even if your team is okay with blurring the line of work-appropriate names, you should tread carefully on this territory. Even subtly alluding to something that’s not work-appropriate is still inappropriate.\n\nDon’t exclude your team from the naming process — you want your team to be attached to their name, to like it, and to stand by it by doing upstanding work. If you exclude your team from the name-making process and give them a name they don’t like, they won’t feel as motivated to work in that team.\n\nTips for naming your team at work\n\nMaking up so many team names can be exhausting, and after a team-naming brainstorming session, your team will probably feel that way too.\n\nBut, after coming up with so many names ourselves, we’re able to give you some great tips for naming your team.\n\nTip #1: Use inside jokes\n\nTeam names are unique to every team — that’s what makes them special. So, start with what it is about your team that stands out.\n\nInside jokes are a great start. Using an inside joke or a reference to a previous situation is endearing to everyone and shows that your team has shared some kind of bonding experience.\n\nIn your team’s first (or first few) meetings, see if there was anything of note that your team found super funny or interesting, or even found out they have in common. For example, a movie everyone likes or a hobby everyone enjoys. That’ll become the backbone of your team name.\n\nOr, if your team has frequent Agile meetings, for example, you can use a name that has links to Agile, like “Backlog Sweepers”.\n\nLikewise, if your team likes saying no in German as a funny bit (“nein”, pronounced as nine), you could call yourself — “Team 9”.\n\nOr, if your team likes The X Files, you could call yourself “Team X”, “Call Moulder”, or something similar.\n\nTip #2: Use wordplay\n\nEveryone loves to hate puns. Your team will groan and complain jokingly but still love their name if wordplay is involved.\n\nFor example, if everyone in your team likes to paint as a hobby, a team name like “Brush It Off” would be perfect.\n\nOr, if your team uses the Scrum framework, you could use our name “Seasoned Scrummers”.\n\nIf you find it difficult to think of puns, don’t worry — wordplay doesn’t rely solely on them. You can just find a word that rhymes with another and slap them together.\n\nFor example, if your team joked around using healing flasks from video games in order to keep up productive work, you could name them “Tasks From a Flask”.\n\nAs you can see, the first tip still applies — combine these two for the perfect effect.\n\nTip #3: Use a voting system or a hat-pull\n\nMore often than not, your team will not be able to agree on a team name. So, you’ll have to find a way to decide.\n\nThere are 2 great methods to use here — a hat pull and a voting system.\n\nA voting system feels the most just, as it’s literally a majority rule. It’s most likely that no one in your team will complain if a team name is voted for.\n\nHowever, voting can result in a tie. If you choose one from a tie, it might feel biased or unfair, so the solution — fairness in unfairness — is to choose randomly.\n\nPut all suggestions in a hat (or any object that can hold tiny pieces of paper) and randomly pull one from it. This way, the name is chosen purely by luck, and there are no hard feelings.\n\nYou can even turn this into a game at your first team-building activity.\n\nTip #4: Use a name generator\n\nIf push comes to shove, and you can’t think of any name for your team, you can always use a random name generator for your team.\n\nWe like to use a D&D party name generator, as it often comes up with some fun and adventurous names.\n\nFor example, with just one click, we got the names “Helping Hand”, “New Myths”, and “Blue Moons”. You can just scroll through enough clicks, and you’re sure to find a name you’ll like.\n\nHow Plaky can help your renamed team boost project collaboration\n\nUnique team names can improve project collaboration and boost team satisfaction. You can even incorporate them in your project management software.\n\nAs a project and team management tool, Plaky allows you to track your projects with ease, assign tasks to people and teams, and have all the relevant information and resources neatly organized in a single place.\n\nPlaky allows you to group people into teams and give them unique names.\n\nWhen you create a team, you can add specific team members to it. From there, any time a team is mentioned, subscribed to an item or board, or assigned to a task, every team member will be notified.\n\nAny time you create a task, you can add an assignee field — and instead of adding every member of your team individually, you can assign it to the entire team.\n\nFurthermore, instead of tagging 15 individual people in a task comment, you can tag the whole team, speeding up the communication process.\n\nThis way, Plaky improves your project collaboration, and it gives your team an excuse to use their name in their daily work — whether they wear it with pride or with laughter."
