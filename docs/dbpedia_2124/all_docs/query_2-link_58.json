Most NY State automobile dealers send the application for a vehicle registration and title certificate to the DMV. The dealer can charge a fee of $175 for this service.\n\nThe proof of ownership for a new vehicle is either\n\nthe Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin (MCO)\n\nthe Manufacturer's Statement of Origin (MSO) and form MV-50 (Retail Certificate of Sale)\n\nThe proof of ownership for a used vehicle is both\n\nthe title certificate that the previous owner signed to transfer the ownership to the dealer\n\n'Retail Certificate of Sale' (MV-50) that the dealer signs to transfer ownership to you (out-of-state dealers use a different bill of sale form)\n\nIf you cannot get acceptable proof of ownership from a NY State dealer, learn how to file a complaint.\n\nVehicles purchased or received as a gift from another person\n\nIf you buy a vehicle, a boat, an ATV, or a snowmobile from another person who is not a DMV-licensed automobile dealer or receive it as a gift, make sure that you receive acceptable proof of ownership.\n\nProof of ownership normally includes a bill of sale. The seller and the buyer both complete the bill of sale. If the vehicle is transferred as a gift, indicate this on the bill of sale and indicate that the purchase price is $0. You must also complete a Statement of Transaction- Sale or Gift of Motor Vehicle, Trailer, All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), Vessel (Boat), or Snowmobile (PDF) (at NY State Department of Tax and Finance) (DTF-802) and indicate on the form that the vehicle is a gift.\n\nA bill of sale can come in three forms:\n\nyou may write your own bill of sale\n\nyou use form MV-912\n\nyou may have the gifter fill out section 6 of the DTF-802\n\nAn acceptable bill of sale includes all of this information\n\nthe year and make of the vehicle, boat or ATV\n\nthe vehicle identification number (VIN) or the hull identification number (HIN)\n\nthe date of the sale\n\nthe purchase price of the vehicle or the boat\n\nthe names and signatures of the buyer and the seller\n\nThe buyer and seller can make photocopies of the bill of sale to keep for their records. The new owner must go to the DMV with the acceptable proof of ownership and a bill of sale. A bill of sale alone is not acceptable as proof of ownership without a title or transferable registration\n\nDeceased owner (motor vehicles only)\n\nUse this checklist to help you transfer the ownership when the vehicle owner is deceased (PDF) (MV-843).\n\nFor transfers made by the surviving spouse 'According to the Estates, Powers & Trust Law of New York State,' the owner of one vehicle that has a value of $25,000 or less automatically transfers to the surviving spouse. If the surviving spouse wishes to transfer ownership, they must print the decedent’s name in the “Seller’s Name (Print in Full)” section on the back of the Title and sign their name in the “Seller’s Signature” Section followed by the words “as surviving Spouse”.\n\nThe ownership of one vehicle that has a value of $25,000 or less transfers to the surviving children under the age of 21 if there is no surviving spouse or the spouse is disqualified. The spouse or the legal guardian of one of the children must sign the title certificate. When the spouse or the guardian signs the title certificate, they must indicate the relationship to the deceased owner. A spouse writes the word \"spouse\" under the signature. A guardian writes \"guardian of\", and the name and the relationship of the child to the deceased owner (for example, \"Charles Edwards, guardian of John Smith, son\").\n\nTo transfer ownership of the vehicle to another person, the spouse or guardian must complete an Affidavit for Transfer of Motor Vehicle (PDF) (MV 349.1). The form must be notarized. The spouse or guardian also gives the new owner a photocopy of the death certificate or certification of death. The DMV accepts a photocopy of the death certificate or certification of death. When the new owner applies for a vehicle registration or a title certificate, they must provide form MV-349.1 and the copy of the death certificate or certification of death.\n\nFor transfers made by the Executor or Administrator of the Estate: If there is more than one vehicle or there is one vehicle that has a value of more than $25,000, the vehicle or vehicles become part of the estate. You cannot use the Transfer of Vehicle Registered in Name of Deceased Person (PDF) (MV-349) or an Affidavit for Transfer of Motor Vehicle (PDF) (MV-349.1) to transfer the ownership\n\nA copy of Letters of Testamentary, Letters of Administration, or Voluntary Administrator’s affidavit from the Surrogate Court MUST be submitted together with the decedent’s title transferred by the person given legal authority in the documents to sign. The Executor or Administrator of the estate must transfer the ownership by signing the title certificate. Under the signature of the Executor or Administrator, write: Executor (or Administrator) of the Estate of, and then enter the name of the deceased owner. For example: \"Executor of the Estate of Mary Ann Smith\".\n\nTo transfer ownership of an out of state title: An out of state title in the name of a deceased owner can only be accepted in New York State if the title has been transferred by an executor or an administrator. A copy of the Letters of Testamentary, Letters of Administration or Voluntary Administrator’s affidavit must be presented. You cannot use the Transfer of Vehicle Registered in Name of Deceased Person (PDF) (MV-349) or an Affidavit for Transfer of Motor Vehicle (PDF) (MV-349.1) with a death certificate or certification of death to transfer the ownership.\n\nDeceased owner (Manufactured Homes, Snowmobiles, Boats, Trailers and All Terrain Vehicles)\n\nIf the owner is deceased, the Estates, Powers & Trust Law of New York State provides for the transfer of the Manufactured Home, Snowmobile, Boat, Trailer or All Terrain Vehicle only through the property distributions of an estate set up by order of a Surrogate Court. A Surviving Spouse, minor child(ren) or next of kin CANNOT automatically assume ownership. Therefore, a Transfer of Vehicle Registered in Name of Deceased Person (PDF) (MV-349) or an Affidavit for Transfer of Motor Vehicle (PDF) (MV-349.1) cannot be used to transfer a manufactured home, snowmobile, boat, trailer, or all-terrain vehicle (ATV).\n\nA copy of Letters of Testamentary, Letters of Administration, or Voluntary Administrator’s affidavit from the Surrogate Court MUST be submitted together with the decedent’s title transferred by the person given legal authority in the documents to sign. The Executor or Administrator of the estate must transfer the ownership by signing the title certificate. Under the signature of the Executor or Administrator, write: Executor (or Administrator) of the Estate of, and then enter the name of the deceased owner. For example: \"Executor of the Estate of Mary Ann Smith\".\n\nVehicles to a revocable living trust\n\nThe person who creates a trust is the settlor. The owner of the vehicle and the settlor of the trust can be the same person. The person or the persons who manage the property of the trust are the trustee or the trustees. The settlor can be a trustee, but the settlor cannot be the only trustee.\n\nThe document that creates the trust is the trust document.\n\nWhen a person transfers a vehicle to a revocable living trust, the settlor becomes the new owner of the vehicle.\n\nHow to Transfer the Vehicle to the Settlor (the Trust)\n\nThe owner and the settlor must complete Statement of Transaction- Sale or Gift of Motor Vehicle, Trailer, All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), Vessel (Boat), or Snowmobile (PDF) (at NY State Department of Tax and Finance) (DTF-802). If the owner and the settlor are the same person, complete Part II of form DTF-802 for a gift. Complete the donor section and the recipient section.\n\nThe person who is the owner of the vehicle must complete the seller sections on the back of the certificate. The owner must sign the title certificate as the seller.\n\nThe settlor must complete the odometer and damage disclosure statement on the back of the title certificate. The settlor must sign their full name in the buyer section of the title certificate and print the word \"settlor\" after their name.\n\nThe settlor must get new insurance identification cards from an insurance agent or insurance company. The insurance identification cards must identify the trust with the letters \"TST\" and identify the settlor with the letters \"STL\". For example:\n\n\"John Jones TST\"\n\n\"John Jones STL\"\n\nHow the Settlor Applies for a Registration and a Title Certificate\n\nThe settlor cannot use the registration or vehicle plates of the previous owner. The settlor must apply for a new title certificate and a new vehicle registration. The DMV issues new registration documents, new vehicle plates and a new title certificate to the settlor. The previous owner must transfer or surrender the previous vehicle plates.\n\nTo apply for the new registration and title certificate, the settlor must provide to a DMV office:\n\nStatement of Transaction- Sale or Gift of Motor Vehicle, Trailer, All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), Vessel (Boat), or Snowmobile (PDF) (at NY State Department of Tax and Finance) (DTF-802)\n\nthe insurance identification card that identifies the trust and the settlor\n\nVehicle Registration/Title Application (PDF) (MV-82) completed and signed by the settlor\n\nthe trust document, which\n\ndescribes the trust as a revocable living trust\n\nshows the name of the trust\n\nshows the names of the settlor, the names of the trustees and the Social Security Number (SSN) of the settlor (if an SSN of the settlor is not available, the settlor can show a New York State driver license with the ID number of the settlors driver license, permit or Non-Driver ID ).\n\nSee location, instructions and reservation information for your DMV\n\nMore information"
