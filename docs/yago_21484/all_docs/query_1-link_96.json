In December 1815 she believed she had found a welcome refuge at Constance in the Grand Duchy of Baden. But the hatred of the Allies was still watchful. In spite of the Grand Duke’s personal sympathy for her, as well as that of the Grande Duchesse Stéphanie de Beauharnais, the diplomatic intrigues of the Holy Alliance made this retreat a precarious one. On February 10, 1817, the Queen bought the castle of Arenenberg on Lake Constance. But even her rights to possess this little corner of land were contested. Finally the loyal friendship of the King of Bavaria allowed the stepdaughter of Napoleon to acquire the Hotel de Waldeck, in the rue Sainte-Croix at Augsburg. She settled there on May 6, 1817.\n\nIt was at Constance during that mournful winter of 1816-1817 while her fate was still undecided that the Queen undertook to compose her memoirs.\n\nEndowed with an extremely sensitive nature and like her mother animated by a constant desire to please and to gain people’s affection, Hortense suffered from the slightest unfavorable criticism. Because of her kindness of heart, because she knew that she had never consciously harmed anyone, she wished public opinion to judge her always on her merits. Fifteen years of public life had not steeled her against malicious scandal-mongering. She made the mistake of believing that the latter was due entirely to ignorance of the truth. Her friends had changed her motto, Least known, least annoyed into Better known, better loved, and she joyfully had adopted the new phrase.\n\nThus it was natural that having found a refuge and impelled by her desire to justify her conduct she should spend long hours in trying in various ways to make herself better known.\n\nAlready at the time of the imperial divorce, hearing someone blame her brother for having consented to it—it is Hortense herself speaking—surprised by the difficulties truth encounters to make itself widely known she had noted down the details of the event but had not gone any further.\n\nIt was in 1812 while the Queen was taking the waters at Aix-la-Chapelle that the Comtesse de Nansouty had urged her to write the story of her life.\n\nWhen Hortense declared she would not have the patience to do such a thing the Comtesse de Nansouty proposed to record what she would tell her. The next day—as is stated farther on in the text of the memoirs—she brought me what I had told her the day before about certain incidents in my childhood. But it was not like me. While admitting the merits of this account I declared I did not care to hear myself using any other words than my own, and the volume went no further than the first page, which she kept.\n\nLouise Cochelet, who was a faithful although not always a very well-inspired friend of Hortense, relates how, at Constance, the pages were composed which now are being published in accordance with the wishes of Prince Napoleon. \"The Queen as usual spent the morning at home, working alone. It was at this time that the need to refute the lies and slanders which had appeared during the last two years suggested to her the idea of writing her memoirs. She felt as if it were a moral duty to describe events as they had occurred, to reply victoriously to the libelous accusations which had been brought against the Emperor. The misinterpretation of his motives, the distorted accounts of his actions could not better be set right than by someone who, having always lived near him, knew his ideas and his character.\n\nAs for the malicious gossip of which she herself had been made the object she felt so far above such base libels that, in order completely to annihilate them, all she had to do was to tell the truth about what actually took place and set down on paper a simple record of her conduct. This having been accomplished she felt relieved and thought no more about it.{1}\n\nMademoiselle Cochelet adds, The memoirs of the Queen begun at Constance in 1816 will not see the light till after her death. She had continued them, turning back to the years previous to that in which she began them. It is a legacy she is preparing which she will leave to historians whom time shall have rendered impartial.{2}\n\nThe Queen’s manuscript is dated Augsburg, 1820. This date is that on which she completed it. But on November 19, 1830, Mademoiselle Valérie Masuyer, who had just assumed the post of reader to the Queen, in telling how the latter organized her life in Rome writes: She wishes to stay at home till three o’clock every day in order to go over again the memoirs she began in 1816 and abandoned in 1820.{3}\n\nIn 1833, Buchon, the scholar who spent a winter at Arenenberg, also said: Sometimes the Queen devotes her leisure to adding a page to her memoirs, which are a sort of monologue in which the soul expresses itself without fearing a stranger’s glance.{4} Numerous traces of these revisions, as will be seen later, are to be found in the original manuscripts.\n\nThe memoirs which follow are not the only effort on the part of the Queen to re-establish the truth.\n\nFollowing the conflicting interpretations which had been placed on her trip in 1831 through France and England, she again took up her pen, and going back for an instant to the point where her former narrative had stopped she retraced briefly the events that had occurred since that time. On this matter Buchon writes as follows: \"The Queen was kind enough to read the simple, eloquent and moving account she composed following this journey. Everything is explained, everything becomes clear and understandable. This narrative was written simply for her personal satisfaction and as a continuation of her interesting memoirs, of which she had been kind enough to read me some exceedingly interesting passages in 1821. She did not care to display her private sorrows to the public. Had there not appeared at that time those fictitious memoirs bearing her name{5} in which with the best possible intentions she had been pictured as speaking, writing and acting as she certainly never dreamed of speaking, writing or acting, it would have been difficult to conquer this repugnance.\"\n\nThese scruples having been overcome, the narrative referred to above appeared in 1834 in Paris under the title of La Reine Hortense en Italie, en France et en Angleterre. Fragments extraits de ses Mémoires inédits écrits par elle-même.{6}\n\nBy painstaking research one might possibly find in still other quarters traces of the Queen’s ideas.{7}\n\nIn November 1836 there appeared at the establishment of the bookseller and publisher, Ladvocat, the first two volumes of the Mémoires sur la Reine Hortense et la Famille Imperial ë par Mademoiselle Cochelet, lectrice de la Reine (Madame Parquin).{8}\n\nThe publisher in a Note to the Public tells how, about November 12, 1836, an employee of one of the important stagecoach offices situated in the rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires left the manuscript of this work at his shop. The following day a friend called and explained to the publisher that the memoirs must be published before the 25th of that month and that this date limit was the only condition attached to their publication.\n\nOne should always be suspicious in regard to notices of this kind. A taste for publicity, a desire to arouse the curiosity of the public, a love for hoaxes did not originate in our day.\n\nLouise Cochelet died at Wolfsberg near Arenenberg on May 7, 1835. Her heirs were her husband and a daughter, the latter still a child. The husband was arrested with Prince Louis Napoleon at Strasburg, October 30, 1836. As he was to be tried by a court martial he was confined to prison until the day he was acquitted, January 18, 1837. Consequently he was not free when Ladvocat received his visitor.\n\nMadame Parquin’s brother had nothing to do with the publication of these memoirs. Following the announcement of their publication, which appeared on the fourth page of the Journal des Débats, November 19, the editor of the paper received a letter from Charles Cochelet, at that time paymaster general in the Ardennes, which was reprinted in the issue of the 24th. It read: As the issue of your paper appearing on the 19th of this month contained, to my great astonishment, an announcement of the forthcoming publication of the Memoirs signed by Mademoiselle Cochelet, kindly be good enough to announce that this publication is made without the knowledge of her family, who probably would not have given their consent.\n\nLadvocat replied by referring to the reader’s other brother, Adrien, at that time Consul General in Bucharest.\n\nIn the Journal des Débats, November 25, there appeared this statement signed by the bookseller: After a visit, the day before yesterday, from Monsieur Adrien Cochelet I had no reason to expect the appearance of the letter from his elder brother. Allow me to inform you, sir, that the Memoirs of Mademoiselle Cochelet were brought me by a person who, when the author was on her death-bed, received from her the order to have them published. I believe I have taken sufficient pains to indicate to Monsieur Adrien Cochelet the origin of these memoirs not to be accused by his brother, the paymaster in the Ardennes, of having undertaken their publication from purely mercenary motives. In regard to the Memoirs of Mademoiselle Cochelet I may say that I am surprised that the author’s brothers are the only persons who are not aware of the existence of this curious and witty collection of portraits which all the distinguished guests at the Château of Wolfsberg in Thurgovia (a Swiss canton near Lake Constance) had opportunities to appreciate when Mademoiselle Cochelet herself read them selections from it. It would be impossible to invent everything the author relates.\n\nThis reply did not satisfy Charles Cochelet. Ladvocat placed his volumes on sale November 26, a day later than had been announced. The same day they were seized by the authorities.{9}\n\nThe newspapers, however, mention that this seizure was made as a result of a discussion regarding the ownership of the manuscript.{10}\n\nAn effective outside influence must have intervened for the public was soon able to purchase the work, and the two last volumes appeared without further objections having been made in December 1837. They were dated 1838.{11}\n\nAs a matter of fact the publisher’s anonymous correspondent was the Queen herself or at least the package had been sent at her instigation.\n\nThe appearance of the work brought opportune aid to the unfortunate companions of her son involved in his Strasburg adventure. Besides this Hortense was not altogether a stranger to the actual composition of the pages which were to appear in print.\n\nIt is impossible, if one compares the memoirs of Cochelet for the years 1814, 1815 and 1816 and those of the Queen covering the same period, not to be struck with many analogies in their texts. Their descriptions agree, generally, more closely than one is accustomed to find in the case of testimony of two different witnesses of the same event. This might be explained, to be sure, by the fact that Mademoiselle Cochelet was familiar with the unpublished writings of her mistress and had followed their context.{12}\n\nThere can be no doubt that the main portion of the work was really written by the Queen’s companion. Certain pages could have been written by no one else. Those, for instance, where Louise gives rein to her love of intrigue, where she naively displays her satisfaction at meeting prominent people, in short where she does not hide any of those faults which were precisely those with which the Duchesse de Saint-Leu (Hortense’s title after the fall of Napoleon) reproached her.\n\nIt is also quite certain that she noted on paper some of her recollections. For those who knew her the reverse would have seemed astonishing. On this point we have not only the evidence of Ladvocat, but even the confession of her brother Charles who, in his letter to the Journal des Débats quoted above, admits: It is true, monsieur, that my sister, at the time of her death, left a large number of letters, the existence of which was due to the brilliant acquaintances she made in connection with her former position. Perhaps even some recollections written in her handwriting may have been found among her papers intended as a precious inheritance for her daughter. But certainly she never planned to use the letters, unedited and unselected, as the basis for a volume of memoirs. The letters, although from people of high rank, were only of personal interest. Even had she decided to undertake such a publication, and I doubt this very strongly, she would have done it with that reserve and tact which distinguished her. I cannot say if one will find these qualities in the present memoirs, doubtless written in part by someone else.\n\nIn spite of these elaborately cautious sentences intended to shield the responsibility of the paymaster of the Ardennes from any complaints that might be forthcoming from persons of high rank, it will be noticed that he does not deny the existence of a manuscript which has been revised and corrected by some other person. That person was the Queen. Hortense had embroidered on the canvas left by her companion.\n\nProof of this is to be found in the mysterious task to which she devoted herself previous to the publication of the memoirs of Madame Parquin and of which Mademoiselle Masuyer gives us a glimpse.\n\nUnder date of May 21, 1836, the latter writes as follows: \"We have spoken of Madame d’Abrantes, who aroused dismay by pillorying her acquaintance, and of the Mémoires Parquin in which the Queen will express her little dislikes. She would have considered it beneath her dignity to mention them in her own memoirs.\"{13}\n\nIn the same diary, Mademoiselle Masuyer, who acted as the Queen’s secretary in connection with these memoirs, refers on several occasions to the importance which Hortense attached to them. On October 19, 1837, two weeks after the death of her mistress, Mademoiselle Masuyer relates that \"after lunch the Prince (Louis-Napoleon) having asked me for my notes on the Mémoires de Madame Parquin, I brought him the four thick volumes, representing four years’ work on my part, for him to burn them. I felt badly about it, I should have like to have kept them. A little further on, Masuyer adds: The Prince sent the rest of the papers to be burned. I am very much afraid this was not done discreetly. Till the Last Judgment I shall always deny having had anything to do with these memoirs.\"{14}\n\nDoes this refer to the rough draft of the four volumes bearing Mademoiselle Cochelet’s name as author which appeared in 1836 and 1837? Was the Queen preparing other extracts revised and edited from the papers belonging to her companion? The first hypothesis seems the more plausible but, be that as it may, it cannot be denied that in the memoirs published under the name of Louise, there were a great many pages in which the Queen said herself what she wished to have said.\n\nWe may also mention that a biographical notice on Prince Napoleon-Louis, who died at Forli, appeared in 1831 bearing the signature of H. de Roccaserra. It was really written by Hortense, who had composed it the day after the death of her son. On March 29, indiscreet Mademoiselle Masuyer writing from Ancona says: Roccaserra has left, taking with him a copy of the notice she wrote about her son. He will have it printed in Corsica, and we shall do so in France.{15}\n\nII\n\nQueen Hortense wrote her recollections herself, on sheets of letter paper of the size generally used at that time, 13½ centimeters by 20 centimeters (5 by 8 inches), or other loose leaves. Some of these sheets, bearing many words scratched out, have been preserved, but the larger portion has disappeared. Prince Napoleon’s archives fortunately, however, contain four copies, some of them complete, the others unfinished or abridged.\n\nThe principal copy is dated Augsburg, 1820. It is signed at the bottom of the last page by the Queen and is entirely written by Mademoiselle Elisa de Courtin, who took a position with the Queen in 1815, at the beginning of the second Restoration, and did not leave her again till her own marriage with Casimir Delavigne, which was celebrated in Paris on November 1, 1830. The copy fills a large account-book, bound in large-grained red morocco, 24 centimeters by 1.315 (9¼ by 14 inches). The front and back covers of this volume, in addition to a border of vine-tendrils, grapes and wheat-ears, have in the middle a gilded H surmounted by the imperial crown. The side, without lettering, is covered with squares (quadrilles) and various ornaments. Inside, each sheet has wide margins on the right and left of the text. These margins are frequently covered with notes, some of them written by the Queen, others by Madame Salvage.{16} These notes and additions are the result of successive revisions carried out by the Queen from 1830 on. No title appears on the (page de garde) bastard title-page. This manuscript, which without question may be considered the most complete and the most carefully revised, has 550 pages.\n\nA second copy, executed about the same time, perhaps even earlier, was written by a secretary who, to all appearances, belonged to the Queen’s immediate household. We have not, however, been able to identify him sufficiently accurately to feel justified in mentioning any name. For the safeguarding of this reproduction two blank-books had been prepared, likewise bound in long grained morocco, 25 centimeters by 20 centimeters (10 by 8 inches). Only the first one was used. The blank-books are decorated on the front and back covers with an H beneath an imperial crown, and the borders of these covers are in a frame (rais de cœur) with a conventionalized heart pattern. The side is covered with a gilded checker-board pattern (quadrilles); in the middle they have only the inscription Tom. I. or Tom. II. The person who did the copying stopped abruptly in the middle of the first of these volumes at a passage which corresponds to page 177 in the preceding manuscript. On the fly-leaf is written: Mémoires de Hortense-Eugénie de Beauharnais, Reine de Hollande, Duchesse de Saint-Leu. At the time of the later revisions the Queen evidently worked on this document for, on the sides of the pages, are numerous additions, all in her handwriting. The majority of these additions were reproduced by Madame Salvage on the principal manuscript, but one can find some exceptions to this rule.\n\nThe archives of Prince Napoleon contain two other copies of the memoirs.\n\nThe first of these is entirely written by Madame Salvage de Faverolles, who attached herself to the fortunes of the exiled Queen at quite a late date. They are written on 176 loose leaves of large format, and the copying was certainly done after 1830, as the additions to the preceding copies, such as the one referring to Bourrienne’s Mémoires, which could not have been composed until after that date, appear in the proper place. This copy almost entirely conforms to the first manuscript. At the same time a certain number of pages relating to the home life of the Queen have been eliminated. Perhaps this copy was prepared by the Queen to present her recollections to her friends without disclosing to them all her secrets. Here again there are sentences and paragraphs added by the Queen which are in her handwriting.\n\nFinally, the last copy, also in the writing of Madame Salvage, is on loose sheets of letter-paper stamped with her monogram D.S. (Dumorey Salvage) and comprises 604 four-page sheets. Two of these sheets have been lost. Her Majesty the Empress Eugenie replaced them by a copy which she made herself of the missing passages. The text is the practically exact reproduction of the manuscript first described, except for a few modifications, mostly simply questions of form. We have paid no attention to them as these corrections appeared to us to be due entirely to the person who did the copying. The document, on which one finds no traces of the Queen’s intervention, was also made at a date posterior to 1830.{17}\n\nIII\n\nThe Queen till the time of her death, which occurred on October 5, 1837, enjoyed reading her memoirs to the friends who had remained faithful to her in her exile and to distinguished guests who paid homage to her in her misfortune.\n\nAlready in 1821, as we have pointed out, Buchon had been the first person privileged to hear certain selections possessing the highest historic interest.{18} One after another Chateaubriand, Madame Récamier, Casimir Delavigne, Alexandre Dumas, Madame Campan, Coulmann and many others had enjoyed the same privilege.\n\nWhen the Queen became aware that her sufferings were drawing to a close she took care not to forget these precious secrets. On April 3, 1837, fearing the results of an operation which Lisfranc did not dare perform, she drew up her will. At that moment she had no hope of seeing again Prince Louis-Napoleon, whom the French Government following his unsuccessful adventure at Strasburg had sent to America. Consequently Hortense included among her last wishes the sentence, Madame Salvage shall preserve my memoirs until she is able to hand them back to my son.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Madame Salvage de Faverolles, whose devotion to her sovereign is well known, performed faithfully and at the earliest opportunity the mission entrusted to her. Moreover the return of the Prince to his mother’s bedside, two months before the Queen breathed her last, reduced considerably the role and powers of the testamentary executor.\n\nMonsieur Fourmestraux{19} says, however, that Madame Salvage kept the manuscript and confided it before she died to Mademoiselle Masuyer with instruction to restore it to Prince Louis. This delay in carrying out the Queen’s wishes is the less easy to explain as by his mother’s will the future Napoleon III knew of the existence of the manuscript. Perhaps Fourmestraux is alluding to the last copy made by Madame Salvage without the Queen’s knowledge or consent and which she lacked the courage to give up sooner.\n\nBe that as it may, Napoleon III took possession of the memoirs. He read them and reread them. The notes in his handwriting on the Red Manuscript leave no doubt of that fact. After his death Empress Eugenie preserved them. The pains she herself took to replace the sheets missing from one of the copies prove the interest with which she regarded this relic. Following the death of the Empress the different manuscripts were placed in the archives of Prince Napoleon, who decided to have their text published.{20}\n\nIV\n\nThe Prince was preparing this edition when a mortal disease carried him off prematurely from the respect and affection of his faithful followers and from the admiration of those who had the honor of sharing his labors. In the performance of this task he displayed the characteristic qualities of order and method, the passion which filled his heart for everything that concerned the glory of France and the knowledge and understanding of all historical events great and small due to his long and studious researches.\n\nAlthough the Prince did not live to see the fulfilment of his last wishes his desires have nevertheless been followed respectfully and completely executed.\n\nIn accordance with his express desires the present edition is entirely unabridged with the exception of three bits of sentences, one consisting of four, another of three lines, and the third of six words, which he in his wisdom had considered should be suppressed on the ground of propriety. These passages moreover have nothing to do with the private life of the Emperor, the vivid description of which forms the principal attraction of the pages written by his stepdaughter.\n\nThe text reproduced is that of the volume which we have called the Red Manuscript. When necessary additions have been made to it by inserting passages from the other manuscripts which do not appear in the first-mentioned version, care has been taken to call these additions to the attention of the reader.\n\nThe narrative of the Duchesse de Saint-Leu in all these copies is an uninterrupted one, without divisions into chapters. It has seemed possible without betraying the intentions of the author to make these divisions for the purposes of greater clarity.\n\nIn presenting to the public the Memoirs of Queen Hortense exactly as she recorded them, in exposing it to scholars—with an intrinsic and absolute respect for the integral historical accuracy of the text—these intimate revelations as set down by her royal hand, Prince Napoleon did a service not only to history but also to the memory of a princess too often harshly criticized eminently French in her heart and mind, to the memory of an unfortunate Queen, to the memory of an exquisite woman.\n\nLike the Emperor, one of whose shadows she was and whose touching and affectionate farewell smile she received as he was leaving France for the last time, the Queen of Holland has nothing to lose by having all her acts and even her mistakes fully revealed.\n\nThis becomes very clear as one peruses these volumes where she took care not to avoid any of the difficulties of her task. She knew what society said about her; she was aware of the reproaches, justified and unjustified, of which she was the object. Frequently, reading between the lines one is conscious of the care her pen took to refute certain implications, sometimes with disdain but never without courage.\n\nIt only remains for the humble collaborator whom Prince Napoleon was good enough to associate with him in his labors, to express the deep gratitude he bears towards him who nobly and fittingly bore a name so burdened with a glorious tradition.\n\nIn questions of research, in the sometimes delicate task of preparing the notes, the unalterable good sense of the Prince, his firmly grounded knowledge, his conscientiousness and fairness, his unequaled tact were infallible guides which his constant kindness made easy to follow.\n\nThe author of these lines, who fervently carried on a task joyfully begun, found after the cruel loss of May 3, 1926, a no less precious aid, a no less accomplished leader in the person of her Imperial and Royal Highness Princess Napoleon. Having unceasingly shared the labors of her august spouse she took up the pen that had fallen from his fingers and completed the undertaking he had commenced. But will she allow us to say more regarding her share in a work which was one of the last enterprises of the great Frenchman who has died?\n\nJEAN HANOTEAU.\n\nParis, February 8, 1927\n\nOne hundred and twentieth anniversary of the Battle of Eylau.\n\nWe cannot refrain from expressing our gratitude for the aid we received during the course of our work. We must not forget Monsieur René Doumic of the Academie Française, who offered the more important parts of these memoirs the hospitality of the Revue des Deux Mondes; Monsieur le Vicomte Emmanuel d’Harcourt, custodian of the papers left by his grandfather, the Comte de Sainte-Aulaire, in which we found so much curious material; Madame Bernard du Closel, born de Las Cases, that name which is a synonym of faithfulness, who offered us the rich archives left by her uncle; Madame la Baronne de Beauverger, born Clary, who allowed us to use the autograph letters of the Queen which form part of her family treasures; Monsieur Émile Brouwet, the erudite collector whose knowledge is always at the disposal of research workers; Monsieur Jean Bourguignon, the highly competent curator of Malmaison so rich in memories of Hortense; Monsieur Maurice Dumolin, to whom one is obliged to refer every time one encounters some delicate problem connected with the topography of Old Paris; Monsieur Noël Charavay, whose helpfulness is only equaled by his knowledge; Monsieur Paul Marmottan, so well informed about everything having to do with the days of the Empire, who has allowed us to draw on his precious collections; Colonel Reboul and his wife, by whom our investigations in Holland were greatly facilitated; finally Monsieur Paul Hallynck, who has guided and advised us with a loyal spirit of friendship which we thoroughly reciprocate.\n\nWe also wish to thank the Princess de la Moskowa, born Princess Bonaparte, and the Prince de la Moskowa, thanks to whom we were able to complete our iconography; Monsieur Meyer who allowed us to reproduce the portrait of the Queen by Baron Regnault; Messieurs Jean Guiffrey, curator of paintings at the Louvre; André Pératé, curator of paintings at Versailles; Joseph Durieux, Maurice Levert, Ferdinand Bac, Doctor Cabanès, the Comte de Toulgöet-Treanna, and Henri Malo.\n\nJ. H.\n\nCHAPTER I—EARLY CHILDHOOD: THE REVOLUTION: THE REIGN OF TERROR (1783-1794)\n\nParentage—Earliest Memories—Visit to Martinique—Mistaken philanthropy—Flight to France—In Paris during the Revolution—The Arrest of Josephine and Beauharnais—Revolutionary Festivities—An Alarming Encounter—The Fête of the Supreme Being—The Execution of Alexandre de Beauharnais.\n\nMY life has been so varied, it has been so crowded with honors, so filled with misfortunes that it has become a subject of public interest. Some people have praised me unduly, others blamed me unjustly, few have really known me. This was on account of my social position, which limited the number of those who could come directly in contact with me. In view of all this I feel I am entitled to demand a fair trial without favor but also without prejudice.\n\nAll my actions, great and small, have been prompted by my feelings, by my heart. If the heart be pure can one do wrong? My love for everything that is fine, that is worthwhile, has supported me in the midst of my defeats and misfortunes. This feeling has been my strength and my comfort at all times.\n\nThe following pages are not intended for the crowd. They are addressed to a few sensitive and understanding souls. It is by these I wish my conduct to be judged. To them I shall show myself in my true colors. I say to this little group of friends, \"This is my real life.\n\nStudy me, pity me, love me, admire me. I feel the need of arousing these emotions. They will form the charm of my declining years.\" Thus the only audience I seek is one composed of friends.\n\nMy brother Eugène knows me too well to need any explanations of my actions. What thought has traversed my mind which I have not shared with him? Our tender affection for one another has made me confide to him every one of my emotions. As for my children it is not from me that they should learn the unhappiness their father caused me. I have suffered so much for their sake, I have cherished them so dearly that when they know the truth they will only love me the more. As far as I myself am concerned, while the writing of these memoirs may prove painful since they will remind me that what should have been the happiest years of my life were full of sorrows and trials, at the same time I shall find satisfaction in recalling the little good I have been able to perform.\n\nMy grandfather the Marquis de Beauharnais was Governor General of the French colonies in the West Indies.{21} While living at Martinique he became intimate with the family of the Counts Tascher de La Pagerie, who were originally from near Blois in Touraine, but who had settled in the West Indies and owned important estates there. The Marquis de Beauharnais married Mademoiselle de Chastullé, a rich heiress owning considerable property on the island of Santo Domingo, and had two sons by his marriage.{22} My father, the younger of the two, was born at Martinique, on the—,{23} and while still very young returned to France with my grandfather when the latter was recalled from his post.{24}\n\nAbout the same time one of the Taschers de La Pagerie married a Monsieur Renaudin and also settled in France. In order still further to cement the bonds of friendship uniting the two families, it was decided that my father should marry a member of the same family. When the ship bearing his request for the hand of the eldest daughter reached Martinique the young lady was dying. Later, when the family in France had asked to have the second sister sent back to Europe for my father, the fact that she had gone into a decline following her sister’s death and was afflicted with an incurable disease caused the youngest girl to be selected in her place. Her father accompanied her back to France and she became the Vicomtesse de Beauharnais.{25} The ceremony was performed in Paris on—.{26} Thus it was chance that directed my mother’s fate. Eugène was born in 1781{27} and I in 1783.{28}\n\nAlthough my mother’s social position was brilliant it was not enough so to make her forget her family ties and the country of her birth. Across the Atlantic still lived her mother,{29} now advanced in years, whom she wished to see at least once more. Then too her wish to leave France may have been stimulated by a certain feeling of resentment toward my father, a resentment easy to understand but difficult to overcome. The latter, handsome in person, highly cultured in mind, was greatly sought after by the most prominent people of both sexes at court and in society. My mother’s oversensitive nature took offense at this excessive popularity. Indeed she became actually jealous and felt that distance and separation would prove the best remedies."
