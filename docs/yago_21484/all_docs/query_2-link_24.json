        "text": "In the Netherlands, the name Hortense doesn’t say much. Yet it’s the name of one of our queens! Hortense de Beauharnais, was the daughter of Joséphine, Napoleon’s stepdaughter ánd sister-in-law, King Louis’ wife and the mother of Emperor Napoleon III. Who was this remarkable woman?\n\nDaughter\n\nBorn on April 10, 1783, she was the daughter of Alexandre de Beauharnais and Joséphine Tascher de la Pagerie, who married Napoleon Bonaparte after the execution of her first husband. Hortense grew up in Paris shortly after the French Revolution.\n\nWife\n\nAs the marriage of Joséphine and Napoleon remained childless, Hortense was wed to Napoleon’s brother Louis Napoleon in 1802. The plan was that Napoleon would adopt the children from this marriage and thus secure his succession. However, Louis didn’t agree to this. Despite their disagreements, the Emperor gave the kingdom of Holland to his brother and Hortense became the first queen of Holland.\n\nMother\n\nThe marriage between Hortense and Lodwijk was very unhappy. In 1810 the two separated. Yet three sons were born:\n\nNapoleon Charles, Prince Royal of Holland (1802 – 1807)\n\nNapoleon Louis, Louis II of Holland (1804 – 1831)\n\nCharles Louis Napoleon (1808 – 1873), Emperor Napoleon III of France, husband of Empress Eugenie\n\nWith her lover Charles Joseph de Flahaut she secretly had another son, Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, who was raised to Duke of Morny by his half-brother Napoleon III in 1862.\n\nLast years\n\nAfter Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo in June 1815, Hortense was forced to leave France. After many wanderings, she settled with her son Louis-Napoléon, in 1817 in Switzerland, in the villa Arenenberg on Lake Constance. She traveled a lot, especially to Italy where her second son lived with his father.\n\nIn 1837 Hortense died at the age of 54 in Arenenberg of cervical cancer. She never saw how her only remaining son finally acquired power in France: first in 1848 as president of the Second French Republic, and then in 1851 – after a coup d’état whereby his half-brother, the Duke of Morny, stood him faithfully aside – as Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nHortense, de vergeten koningin by Thera Coppens\n\nDo you want to see more pictures of Hortense, please have a look at my Pinterest board:"
