        "text": "Pink Diamonds\n\nPink diamond is a type of diamond which has all the same elements as more commonly known diamonds except that they also exhibit pink colour. Pink diamonds belong to a subcategory of diamonds called fancy colour diamonds, the generic name for all diamonds that exhibit any sort of colour. Pink diamonds range from flawless to included, just as white diamonds. The source of their pink colour is greatly debated in the gemmological world. Numerous theories have been posited as to how the pink is formed in pink diamonds. The prevailing theory is that the pink is caused when the diamond is subjected to enormous pressure during its formation. A similar theory is being tested on pink diamonds that originated in the Argyle Mine in Kimberley, Western Australia. This theory posits that a seismic shock propelled colourless diamonds to the surface and altered their molecular structure, causing them to appear pink.\n\nPink diamond gradient levels\n\nVarying shades of pink diamonds\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Hortensia Diamond\n\nWeighing in at 20.53 carats, the Hortensia Diamond is a flat, light pink diamond with a five sided outline that is marred by a very fine crack that runs from the outer edge to the culet. History records French King Louis XIV as an owner, where, according to a 1691 inventory list of the French Crown Jewels, its first appearance was in a floret of buttonholes.\n\nWhat we do know is that the diamond was stolen twice. The first time in 1792 when, during the French Revolution, the Royal Treasury was stormed by rioters who made off with most of the Crown jewels – including the Hortensia. However, thanks to the last minute confession of a condemned man by the name of Depeyron, the\n\nHortensia was recovered.\n\nThe diamond’s namesake, Hortense de Beauharnais, was born in Paris, France, the daughter of Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais and Marie Rose Josèphe Tascher de la Pagerie. When the marriage didn’t work out, Marie Rose was divorced by her husband and she – along with Hortense – was sent to a convent.\n\nAfter years of growing up in exile, Hortense and her mother finally returned to Paris. Back into French society, her mother, now known as Joséphine, remarried to the famed general and future Emperor of France, Napoleon Bonaparte. Now the step-daughter of the famous French leader, Hortense\n\nenjoyed the perks of being part of the most powerful family in France.\n\nHortense married Napoleon’s brother, Louis Bonaparte. Napoleon appointed his brother King of Holland, making Hortense the country’s queen in 1806. It was surely sometime during this period (1806-1817) that the diamond was named after her. Yet there is nothing to document when or why it happened. Although Hortense and Louis marriage was not a happy one, Hortense accompanied Louis to The Hague to assume her new duties. The Hortensia was stolen again was in 1830 from the Ministry of the Marine – but the Hortensia did not remain at large for very long.\n\nDuring the return of the monarchy in France and\n\nNapoleon’s exile to Elba, Hortense and Louis divorced. Hortense supported Napoleon following his escape from Elba and return to power. Her punishment for supporting Napoleon during the Hundred Days was banishment from France. Now roaming the continent, she eventually settled in Arenenberg, Switzerland in 1817, where she lived until her death in 1837.\n\nToday the Hortensia is on display in Paris at the Galerie d’Apollon of the Louvre museum.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe DeYoung Pink\n\nThe lively 2.82-carat pear-shaped DeYoung Pink Diamond comes from the Williamson mine in Tanzania. In the late 1950s, the Baumgold Brothers, one of the largest diamond cutting firms in the United States, acquired from DeBeers a sight (“lot”) of pink and blue rough diamonds. Soon afterward they made an agreement with the J. & S.S. DeYoung jewellery firm in Boston to sell them all the finished stones. One of the cut stones was the 2.82ct pink pear-shaped diamond. It was considered exceptional and kept by DeYoung until it was donated in December 1962. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) graded the DeYoung Pink as a natural fancy intense purplish-pink diamond with a clarity grade of SI-1.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Pink Star/Steinmetz Pink/Pink Dream\n\nKnown around the world for its mineral riches, it is not surprising that South Africa is where many of the most exceptional diamonds in the world are discovered. One such diamond is The Pink Star, a rare 59.6 carat Fancy Vivid Pink diamond. It is the largest pink diamond to be graded throughout recorded history. The rare stone was mined by De Beers in 1999 and had a rough weight of 132.5 carat.\n\nHowever, there was a considerable delay until the stone was finally set, this was\n\nbecause of Dr. Williamson’s wish to add further pink diamonds to his original gift. As these were not forthcoming, he added 170 small brilliants, 12 baguettes and 21 marquises instead. These were subsequently set by Cartier into platinum brooch, designed by Frederick Mew in 1952. The resulting brooch is described as being “designed in the form of a jonquil set with brilliants, marquises and baguettes, the center of the flower with a large pink brilliant”.\n\nThe Queen wears this brooch occasionally; most notably her Silver Jubilee Celebrations in 1977, the weddings of the Prince of Wales in 1981, of Viscount Linley in 1991, and of the Earl of Wessex in 1999.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Princie Diamond\n\nThe Princie diamond got its name from the fourteen-year old son of the Maharani of Baroda, Sita Devi, whose nick name was Princie. The mother and son were special guests of honor at a party held in Paris in 1960, by the owners of the diamond, Van Cleef & Arpels, to celebrate the acquiring of the rare and unique pink diamond. The diamond which perhaps was unnamed is a historic diamond said to have\n\nbelonged to the renowned Nizam of Hyderabad, who lost his domain in 1948, when it was forcibly annexed to the new Indian Republic. Once it was established that the Last Nizam of Hyderabad was the owner of the Princie Diamond, the mine of origin of the diamond should be undoubtedly the Kollur mines of Golconda.\n\nThe Princie Diamond was first introduced to the world in 1960 at a Sotheby’s auction held in London. Sotheby’s described the diamond as a spectacular pink cushion-cut diamond, and said it was being offered as “The Property of a Gentleman.” At the time of the sale\n\nthe identity of the anonymous owner was not known, but subsequently it was revealed that the actual owner of the diamond was none other than the VIIth and the last Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Usman Ali Khan, one of the richest men in the world in the first half of the 20th century but after his forceful abdication in 1948, following Indian independence retired to Bombay, where he lived on a pension granted by the Government of India. The Princie was purchased by the London branch of Van Cleef & Arpels for £46,000 equivalent to US$128,000 and then transferred to their Head Quarters in Paris.\n\nThen, the diamond slipped away from the public eye, and was not seen again until it came up for auction again in 2013. The Princie Diamond was the star of the auction, selling for $39.32 million dollars (£29,804,560) to an anonymous call-in bidder. However, that was not the end of the story.\n\nIn papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, the son and grandchildren of late Italian Senator Renato Angiolillo said they warned the auction house that the Princie Diamond had been stolen from their family, but Christie’s auctioned off the 34.65 carat stone anyway.\n\nThe suit said Angiolillo got title to the diamond in 1961. After Angiolillo’s death in 1973, his children inherited the diamond amongst other jewels. His second wife, Mari Girani, requested that she have custody, but not ownership of, the Princie Diamond the suit said. The offspring agreed, — but after she died in 2009, they were told by her son, Marco Oreste Bianchi Milella, that they were nowhere to be found. Italian authorities started investigating the disappearance of the diamond and the other valuable gems. Their investigation led them back to Girani’s son, Milella, and in March 2013, many of the jewels were found in Monte Carlo in apartments owned by Milella, his girlfriend and a gem-dealing friend of Milella’s.\n\nThe Angiolillos contacted the auction house through their lawyer and told them they\n\nwere the rightful owners, but the auction house insisted the unidentified Swiss seller “had valid title to the Princie Diamond” from Milella, and they were going ahead with the auction. The status of the criminal charges against Milella — who the suit said had sold the diamond to the Swiss seller for $20 million — is unclear.\n\nIn a statement after the auction, Christie’s said the legal action “stems from a long-standing and highly contentious inheritance dispute among the members of an Italian family.” “Prior to Christie’s sale of the diamond in 2013, the two main representatives of the family had expressly withdrawn any objection to sale, and they are well aware that the consignor of the Princie Diamond was not a member of the family, but a bona fide purchaser who acquired the diamond in an arms-length transaction for a significant sum and had held full and clear title to it for several years.”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Raj Pink\n\nThe 37.30 carat Raj Pink was named by the current owner of the diamond who requested anonymity. It is based on the Sanskrit word for king.\n\nAccording to Sotheby’s, the rough diamond that yielded The Raj Pink was studied for more than a year after its discovery in 2015. It was then entrusted to a master cutter, who crafted it into a cushion-modified brilliant cut.\n\nAccording to Sotheby’s, The Gemological Institute of America (GIA), in its report characterized the diamond as an “astonishing stone,” describing its hue as “a very bright and ravishing fancy intense pink colour,” adding, “For a diamond to display strong, unmodified pink\n\ncolour like that observed in The Raj Pink is rare, particularly at so considerable a weight.”\n\nDavid Bennett, worldwide chairman of Sotheby’s International Jewellery Division says “The discovery of any pink diamond is exceptional, but the Raj Pink’s remarkable size and intensity of colour places it in the rarefied company of the most important pink diamonds known.”\n\nThe Raj Pink went up for auction on 15th November 2017 at Sotherby’s Geneva with an estimate of £15,058,440 to £22,587,678 however, it failed to sell.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRose of Dubai\n\nThe “Rose of Dubai”diamond is a 25.02-carat, fancy pink, pear-shaped diamond, with an internally flawless (IF) clarity grade, the highest clarity grade for a diamond. The first time we hear about the diamond is in the 1980’s when it was owned by the London based jeweller Laurence Graff. Details of how Laurence Graff acquired the stone are not available. In all probability the diamond appears to be a new discovery, and given the size and the quality of the diamond, it might have had its origin in the Premier Diamond Mines of South Africa.\n\nLaurence Graff perhaps sold the diamond to an\n\nanonymous buyer, and the whereabouts of the diamond was unknown for over 20 years, until it appeared at the Christie’s Magnificent Jewels Sale held in October 2005. The diamond is set in a platinum ring, perhaps the same setting in which Graff sold the diamond over 20 years ago. The “Rose of Dubai”diamond was bought by Amer Radwan. The diamond was the top lot of around 400 lots put out for sale on that day. The estimate placed on the “Rose of Dubai” was $2.5 to $3 million. However, the diamond went for $6,008,000. Amer Radwan then named the stone the Rose of Dubai."
