        "text": "The Napoleon in Paris Walking Tour was more specifically designed for the American public:\n\nNew Orléans Foundation; Louisiana Purchase; Lafayette, the hero of two worlds; The Bonaparte and America; Louis the XVI and Marie Antoinette, 1778 Franco-American Treaty of Alliance, etc. are some of the subjects of the tour!\n\nThese America-related subjects are also included in the tour’s shorter 3-hour and 2.5-hour versions.\n\nThe 4-hour full tour is the one described on this page. It is a very long walk of +/- 6.5 km (+/- 4 miles).\n\nThe shortened 3-hour version of the tour does not include the last part of the full tour (after Place de la Concorde). It is also a very long walk of +/—5.5 km (+/—3.5 miles).\n\nThe shortened 2.5-hour tour does not include the full tour’s last part nor its first part (before Bourse, Palais Brogniard). It is still quite long: 4.5 km (3.8 miles)\n\nThe 4-hour full has to be reserved for people who like guided tours enough and have the health to handle such a long tour. It is ideal for real Napoleon aficionados! You should avoid booking this tour during the Paris low season (November to March) because of the significant risk of difficult weather. The 2.5-hour tour includes the essentials: Palais-Royal, Louvre, Place Vendôme, and Concorde. This is a prudent choice during the low season. The 3-hour tour is the most successful one, an equibrate compromise.\n\nEven though designed for Napoleon enthusiasts, the three versions of the tour are adequate for non-Napoleonic aficionados, including Paris first-timers. It includes many non-Napoleonic matters, such as architecture, French culture, and history. The tour guide will adapt the dose of Napoleonic content according to the audience.\n\nBecause Paris is the place where Napoleon left his most important marks. There are a lot of ways to follow in the footsteps of Napoleon in Paris, for example:\n\nTracing the young officer during the French Revolution\n\nSearching for the remaining symbols of his military glory\n\nFollowing the protector of the Arts and Sciences\n\nBut before all, you will discover an emperor’s dream to make Paris the capital of its newly built Europe.\n\nParis has changed a lot since Napoleon Bonaparte. It’s much bigger, by far the biggest metropolis of the European Union, but in some ways, the city’s center would still be recognizable to Napoleon … because he built much of it.\n\nThe tour’s main idea is to optimize your time with your guide. This tour then is an optimized route to discover, walking, the Paris of Napoleon.\n\nSo, unlike other Napoleon tours, our standard tour does not include places that you can easily visit without a guide (such as the Invalides, for example).\n\nNevertheless, if you want to do a short visit to Napoleon Tomb by yourself after the tour, it is normally possible if you book a tour departure, not after 1 PM (13h), it is all explained in the after the tour section.\n\nWe can also organize more extensive Napoleon tours, adding extensions to our route y/or visit of museums.\n\nNapoleon III, the other French Emperor\n\nLearn about the other French Emperor Napoleon III, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nLearn how Napoleon III, 37 years after the dramatic fall of the First French Empire, continued his uncle’s project of a newly redesigned Paris and how the Second Empire was given high credit for the rebuilding of Paris.\n\nThis is the famous haussmannien Paris with its broad boulevards, as on our route: Avenue de l’Opéra, rue de Rivoli or Boulevard Saint-Germain.\n\nAlso, Learn about his wife, Eugénie de Montijo, the last French Empress who was still alive in 1919, and the sad story of their only son, the Prince Imperial, who died in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War under the British Flag.\n\nParisian Word Famous Luxe and Chic\n\nOur tour route crosses one of the world’s most famous international iconic deluxe zones with rue de la Paix (part of the Napoleonic urbanistic program and formerly called rue Napoleon) and place Vendôme (formerly Royal Square Louis-le-Grand). The area is a showcase for luxury goods. Most of the world’s great jewelry brands have their most prestigious representation there: Dior, Channel, Piaget, Bvlgari, Chopard, Louis Vuitton, Boucheron, Cartier, Rolex, Van Cleef & Arpels, etc.\n\nOur route will also cross three of the world’s most famous hotels: Le Meurice and Hôtel de Crillon, two Palace hotels, and Le Ritz, an iconic world-class luxury hotel, a symbol of high society and luxury.\n\nTour End Location\n\nIt is impossible to tell you where the tour ends exactly for such long tours; it depends a lot on the customer (the number of questions asked, the walking pace, etc.) or any other contingency. In the case of the 2.5-hour tour and the 3-hour tour, we should normally end the tour around Place de la Concorde if everything goes well.\n\nIn the case of the 4-hour tour, depending on the group’s pace, we may continue after Place de la Concorde and reach the Esplanades des Invalides midway between the Invalides and the Seine River.\n\nWhat to do After: Leaving the Area\n\nFrom Place de la Concorde: métro lines 1, 8 & 12.\n\nFrom Esplanade des Invalides: métro Line 8 & 13, RER C.\n\nWhat to do After: Continue with Napoleon\n\nIf you plan to do a (short) visit to Musée de la Légion d’Honneur or Invalides (Napoleon Tomb), don’t book a tour departure after 12 A.M (4-hour tour) or 1 P.M. (3-hour tour); if you want to have a chance to reach it.\n\nInvalides & Napoléon Tomb, if still open. +/- 1300 meters from Place de la Concorde, +/- 350 meters from the middle of esplanade des Invalides.\n\nMusée de la Légion d’Honneur, if still open. +/- 900 meters from Place de la Concorde, +/- 950 meters from the middle of Esplanade des Invalides.\n\nInvalides – Napoleon Tomb & Army Museum\n\nIn the Invalides is not only Napoleon’s tomb but also the tomb of his elder brother, Joseph Bonaparte, former king of Naples and former king of Spain, who stayed in the USA from 1815 to 1832.\n\nAlso, there are the tombs of the beloved Grand Maréchal Duroc and Grand Maréchal Bertrand, who went with Napoléon to Saint-Helena. There is also an urn with the remains of General Leclerc, Stepbrother of Napoleon, Pauline Bonaparte’s Husband, who died in 1802 in Saint-Domingue (nowadays Haiti) when he was in charge of the disastrous Napoleonic expedition there.\n\nLast but not least, there is also the tomb of Napoleon II, the son of Napoléon and Empress Marie-Louise.\n\nThe Invalides also house the Musée de l’Armée (Army Museum), with many galleries dedicated to the Napoleonic era.\n\nSoon available.\n\nNapoleon Sites Outside Paris Area\n\nChâteau de Fontainebleau\n\nFontainebleau castle, apart from being a jewel of the French Renaissance with its famous mannerist frescos, paintings, and sculptures, is also an Imperial Palace. It is the place where Napoleon’s farewell to its old guard on four April 1814, before leaving France for his first exile to the island of Elba. The Château de Fontainebleau also houses one of the most important Napoleon Museums, including a gallery of portraits of all the imperial families. Napoleon’s apartment with the salon of the first abdication is also part of the normal visit to the castle.\n\nChâteau d’Orléans-la-Source\n\n: Napoleon never went there, but at only +/- 120 km from Paris, the place is fascinating for a real fan of the First Empire. It is where Marshal Davout gave the submission of the rest of Napoleon’s forces (standing along the Loire River) after Waterloo. It was the 14th of July 1815, the final end of the Grande Armée. The following day, at first light, Napoleon embarked on board the Bellerophon and made himself a prisoner of the English. The Château can’t be visited, but we propose a tour of the park of the Château, one of France’s most beautiful gardens (35 hectares)."
