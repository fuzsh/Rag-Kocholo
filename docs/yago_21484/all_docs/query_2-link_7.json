        "text": "I've not been able to find out in my poking around if the Bonaparte King Louis of Holland remained Catholic as monarch? I assume that if he did he was the only Catholic monarch the Dutch have had (since independence from Spain of course). Also, what exactly are the laws about religion and marriage with the Dutch monarchy? I know the parliament has to approve all marriages but is there a law about the monarch having to be a member of a certain church (Dutch Reformed?) and are there any laws against Orange royals marrying Catholics and keeping their royal rights like in Great Britain? I know some did and it did not make them very popular but I could never find out if this changed anything legally for them.\n\nKing Louis also interests me in general. It seems rather out of the ordinary that an imposed foreign monarch would become so popular and so identify with his own people that he would oppose his own family over it.\n\nThe first really Dutch monarchs (holding the highest office of state by hereditary succession) of course were the Ducs de Bourgogne (Dukes of Burgundy) who ruled over roughly 2/3rd of today's Benelux countries.\n\nLook at this map: it is almost like today's map of the Benelux countries plus the Duch√© de Bourgogne.\n\nThe Dukes of Bourgone were:\n\n1631-1363\n\nPhilippe the Bold, Duc de Bourgogne x Margaretha of Flanders\n\n= Jean the Fearless\n\n1363-1404\n\nJean de Valois, \"the Fearless\", Duc de Bourgogne x Margarethe of Bayern\n\n= Philippe the Good\n\n1404-1419\n\nPhilippe de Valois, \"the Good\", Duc de Bourgogne x Isabelle of Portugal\n\n= Charles the Bold\n\n1419-1467\n\nCharles de Valois, \"the Bold\", Duc de Bourgogne x Isabelle de Bourbon\n\n= Marie de Bourgogne\n\n1467-1482\n\nMarie de Valois, Duchesse de Bourgogne x Maximilian I of Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor\n\n= Philippe the Handsome\n\n1482-1506\n\nPhilippe of Habsburg, Duc de Bourgogne x Joanna of Castile\n\n= Charles de Habsburg\n\n1506-1556\n\nCharles V of Habsburg, Duc de Bourgogne x Isabella de Portugal\n\n= Philippe II of Habsburg\n\n1556-1581\n\nPhilippe II of Habsburg, Duc de Bourgogne\n\nIn 1581 the Burgundian territories in the Low Countries (roughly today's Benelux) revolted against the King of Spain (Philippe II) who was -as Duke of Burgundy- the rightful Lord of the Netherlands. Here the mighty Burgundian empire collapsed."
