        "text": "This is the second part of my series looking at the wives of Napoleon’s marshals. This week I am looking at Mesdames Davout, Gouvion St-Cyr, Grouchy, Jourdan and Kellermann. There is a real disparity in the length of the profiles this time around; while there is plenty of information on the life of Aimée Davout and I was able to find some first hand information on conversations with Anne Gouvion St-Cyr, there was a sad dearth of information on the other three women beyond their marriage and death dates. Unfortunately a good few of the marshals did not preserve any personal correspondence or domestic papers at all.\n\nOnce again I am struck by the enormous hardships some of these women faced. While being married to a marshal brought great status at Napoleon’s fledgling court, and usually substantial wealth, most of the wives were frequently left alone while their husbands fought endless campaigns across the length and breadth of Europe. A title was of small comfort when enduring bereavement, ill health or – worst of all – the loss of a child alone.\n\nMadame Davout: Louise-Aimée-Julie Leclerc\n\nLouis-Nicolas Davout’s first wife was Marie-Nicolle Adelaide de Seguenot, whom he married in 1791. Three years later, he divorced her for infidelity and she died in poverty very soon afterwards. His second wife would prove a much more successful choice.\n\nBorn in 1782, Aimée was the youngest child of Jean-Paul Leclerc, a wealthy merchant. Her father died when she was eight and so her elder brothers became her guardians. One of those brothers was General Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc, who had become the husband of Napoleon’s beautiful, promiscuous favourite sister Pauline. The General arranged it that Aimée spent the last years of her adolescence under the tutelage of Madame Campan at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where she was a contemporary of Caroline Bonaparte and Hortense de Beauharnais.\n\nIn 1801 Victoire Leclerc was commanded by Napoleon to take charge of the invasion of Saint-Domingue (modern day Haiti) and reintroduce slavery. As the general expected to be away some years he was keen to ensure that his youngest sister was securely settled before he left. According to Gallagher, Aimée first of all shot down the idea of being connected with Jean Lannes, who she found uncouth. As an alternative General Leclerc introduced the 19 year old Aimée to his friend and fellow General Louis-Nicolas Davout (31). They were married on the ninth of November and their marriage contract was signed not only by the customary notary but also by Napoleon and Josephine.\n\nThough the couple would go on to have a long and loving marriage, the first few years of matrimony were particularly hard for Aimée. First came the loss of her brother, who died of sickness in Haiti, and then following hard on the heels of that was the death of the Davout’s first child. Their son Paul died just short of his first birthday in August 1802. Aimée was (understandably) plunged into a deep depression which was only made worse when the pattern tragically repeated itself and the couple’s second child, a daughter named Josephine, died before she turned one. Aimée was utterly inconsolable and my heart aches for her even at a distance of 200 years.\n\nDavout did as much as he could, despite his continuous absences, to console her. He encouraged her to socialise more and not to spend all her time alone. However he did also show that even to his wife he could be unfeeling and, when the still-mourning Aimée fell pregnant once again in 1805, wrote her a rather sharp letter telling her that she needed to take care of herself and focus on the child who was yet to be born rather than the ones who were dead. He was unable to obtain leave for the birth and so on top of all her other traumas, Aimée had to give birth without her husband in the vicinity. Thankfully, when their daughter arrived (again named Josephine for the Empress) this time the baby thrived. They would go on to have another five children. Of her eight babies, Aimée lost four before or around their first birthday, while the other four lived to adulthood.\n\nThough Davout was often absent over the next 14 years, he and his wife wrote to one another pretty much every day and their letters reveal a very deep and abiding love. Aimée did not much care for life in Paris, and preferred instead to spend life at their chateau in Savigny-sur-Orge, which the couple bought in 1802. There her greatest pleasure was raising and educating her surviving children. After those two first terrible losses, I can imagine that she wanted to relish every second.\n\nOne of the few areas where this devoted couple markedly disagreed was on the subject of Napoleon. Davout’s devotion and loyalty to Napoleon was unshakeable and absolute, while Aimée deeply resented and blamed him for the loss of her brother. She was genuinely fond of Josephine though and outraged when the Emperor divorced her. Aimée also turned down, despite her husband’s urging to the contrary, a position as lady in waiting to Napoleon’s formidable mother. It was ostensibly for health reasons but I think she was very wise.\n\nWhenever it was possible – Napoleon had very firm opinions about his men taking wives with them on campaign – Aimée visited her husband in his various posting across Europe. It is known that she and the children visited him, or in some cases temporarily lived with him, in Bruges, Poznan, Warsaw, Vienna, Hamburg and Szczecin. She was always happiest when the whole family was together.\n\nAimée and her family would have another period of hardship to endure in the aftermath of Waterloo. Davout, always a devoted Bonapartist, had rallied to Napoleon’s side and afterwards had put his own reputation on the line in an attempt to protect other officers and men who had done so. The result was that the Marshal was banished to Louviers, stripped of his honours and deprived of his salary. The Davouts were thus reduced to existing on a handful of francs a day and fell significantly into debt. While her husband was trapped in Louviers under surveillance, it was left to Aimée to go to Paris to try and rent out their property there and also see to the management of their estate. It would be two long years before Davout’s honours and finances were restored.\n\nAimée and her husband lived quietly after that and it became clear at the start of the 1820s that Davout’s health was on the decline. Despite that, a great celebration was had at Savigny in 1820 to celebrate the marriage of their eldest daughter Josephine (an event attended by so many high-ranking officers of Napoleon’s that it was subject to conspiracy rumours). That joy sadly was short-lived and within a year Josephine died from childbirth complications, aged only 16. The loss absolutely broke the Iron Marshal and his health deteriorated more rapidly. Having lost a fifth child, Aimée’s grief was deepened all the further by the loss of her husband in 1823.\n\nAimée survived her husband by 45 years, continuing in her preference for quiet living. She refused an invitation to the coronation Charles X. She saw her youngest daughter Adélaéde-Louise become a famous woman of letters. Aimée died in 1868 at the age of 86 and was buried with her husband and daughter at Pere Lachaise.\n\nYou can view the dress she wore at the wedding of Napoleon and Marie Louise here.\n\nMadame Gouvion St-Cyr: Anne Gouvion\n\nAnne was born in Toul in 1775. She was 19 when she married her first cousin, Laurent de Gouvion St-Cyr in 1795 (You can view the entry for their marriage here). He was 11 years her senior and was nicknamed ‘the Owl’ by his men due to his introverted, unfriendly disposition. He had been significantly psychologically affected after his mother had walked out on the family when he was 4 and had a reputation for being an ‘oddball’.\n\nThe couple were childless for 20 years before their only son, named after his father, was born in 1815. To be a first time mother at 40 is considered risky enough even in the current era – it must have seemed an intimidating prospect indeed to Anne 200 years ago.\n\nThere is not a huge amount of information available on their marriage; St-Cyr was a late comer to the marshalate and so they had not yet reached their great rank during those sparkling social seasons at the height of the Empire. It seems to have been a happy marriage though and St-Cyr sent his wife long and detailed letters when he was absent on campaign. The only real account of them I could find was thanks to the memoirs of Alphonse Denis, who served under the marshal and became a close friend of the family.\n\nDenis left an interesting account of a dinner with the St-Cyrs who it seems preferred to live simply. The story also showcases the Marshal’s total lack of social awareness and preference to have things done in the way he liked.\n\nAfter having taken a walk with his subordinate, St-Cyr made an off-the-cuff invitation for Denis to join the family for dinner, seemingly blind to the discreet signals of his wife. The party was a small one: only the couple, their son, his tutor and Denis and throughout the course of the meal Anne repeatedly apologised to Denis for the simplicity of the fare and the lack of variety of dishes. She promised that if he would do them the honour of dining on another occasion, he would find her table better stocked.\n\nSt-Cyr at this point piped sharply up to say that he had no idea what his wife was talking about, that they never had more than six dishes on the table and that he had no idea why she was talking to Denis as though he worshipped food. He ignored her murmured suggestion that an extra effort should be made when one had guests and announced that that should be an end to the subject.\n\nHowever, Denis also said that this was the only time in their long friendship he could remember the marshal being sharp with his wife and noted that he always showed her the greatest deference. On the next occasion he dined with them, seven dishes were on the table (the marshal was oblivious) and he noted that Anne seemed very well pleased. Clearly she did not always let the great man have his way with everything!\n\nWhen Denis visited Anne after the marshal’s death she admitted to him that she would often get a playful revenge on her husband’s determination to never have more than six dishes by including an extra something sweet for him. When St-Cyr noticed and was in a cheerful frame of mind, he always claimed it did not really count as a dish!\n\nThe Marshal died in 1830 at Hyeres and again we have Denis to thank for the information that on the day before his death he was very peaceful and was smilingly fondly as he listened to his wife, who was very attentive to him. After his death, Anne lived in Paris at a small home on the rue Verte. The table was always well-supplied. She died in 1844 aged 68.\n\nI could find no portrait of Anne Gouvion St-Cyr.\n\nMadame Grouchy: Cécile Félicité Celeste Le Doulcet\n\nSadly, what little I can find about Cécile has wholly been defined by the men she was connected to. There is no indication of the kind of woman that she was, I can find no portrait and the only publicly available documents relating to her I could discover were her marriage certificate and an inventory taken after her death.\n\nCécile was the daughter of Jacques Charles Edmond Le Doulcet, Marquis de Pontecoulant, lieutenant general of the king’s armies. With such a father it would be easy to assume that Cécile came from a royalist household but her brother Louis-Gustave Le Doulcet de Pontécoulant, initially a soldier in the royal army, embraced the Revolution and was allied to the Girondin faction.\n\nIn 1785 at the age of 17, she married Emmanuel Grouchy, the eldest son of the Marquis of Grouchy, in the chapel of Villette Castle. Her husband was also an enthusiastic embracer of the principles of the Revolution so it’s probably fairly safe to assume Cécile must surely have had similar leanings. The couple had three children: two daughters and a son but it is difficult to find any other information about their marriage in the years that followed.\n\nCécile accompanied her husband into his post-Waterloo exile in America and would have had to endure all the distress of watching his reputation be destroyed.\n\nCécile died in 1827. Baron Larrey’s notes reveal that he had operated on her to remove a cancerous breast tumour not long before but that the cause of death was “a sort of spasmodic cholera or acute neurosis”. Marshal Grouchy remarried only a few months afterwards, which was said to significantly strain his relationship with Cécile’s brother Louis. His new wife was Joséphine-Fanny Hua. She was 25, the Marshal was 61. They were married until Grouchy’s death in 1847 at the age of 80.\n\nMadame Jourdan: Jeanne Nicolas\n\nIt is difficult to find a date of birth for Jeanne Nicolas, or indeed any information at all regarding her life, personality or beliefs. However as some sources describe her as being two years her husband’s elder, it can be assumed that she was born around 1760. She is also described as having spent her early adulthood working as a dressmaker.\n\nA sister of Jeanne’s was married to a fabric merchant called Michel Avanturier who, in late 1784, employed a poor ex-soldier by the name of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. Jourdan clearly went on to be on very good terms with his employer and must have interacted fairly frequently with the family to be able to propose to his boss’ sister in law. There seems to have been a little hesitation on the part of Jeanne’s family – at the time the orphaned Jourdan had no money, no prospects and would suffer life-long health problems after his overseas service – but eventually their consent was given. Jeanne and Jean-Baptiste were married at the church of Saint-Michel in Limoges on the 22nd of January 1788. Shortly after their marriage the young couple set up a haberdashery business in the town.\n\nThe marriage seems to have been a reasonably happy one, but it is impossible to say for sure as Marshal Jourdan left behind no private papers or letters. They had six children; five daughters who lived to adulthood and a son who died in infancy.\n\nWhen the Revolution began, Jourdan returned to the army as a volunteer and rapidly rose through the ranks. In 1794 he came within the shadow of the guillotine after attracting the ire of Carnot and was only just saved from certain execution before being dismissed and then recalled. Despite this, he became one of Revolutionary France’s most prominent generals.\n\nJeanne’s status in the world would have significantly increased when her husband was named on Napoleon’s list of marshals of the Empire in 1804. Sadly there is practically no information available on what she did or how she lived during this time. Even the voluble Madame Junot doesn’t seem to have had much to say about Madame La Marechale Jourdan.\n\nWhile Jourdan was far from the most successful of the marshals, the couple had a steady and respectable life during the restoration. Jeanne’s husband held several prominent appointments, including that of Governor of Les Invalides. He held this role when died in 1833, and is buried there. She survived him by seven years and died aged around 80. Three of her five daughters had pre-deceased her. I could also find no portrait of her.\n\nMadame Kellermann: Marie Anne de Barbé-Marbois\n\nSadly, Madame La Marechale Kellermann is yet another woman of whom it is almost impossible detailed information. Were it not that she married and had a son, she might as well have been invisible! Marie Anne was born in Metz into a family of lawmen on 30 September 1742 and on the 26th of September 1769 she married François Christophe de Kellermann, an army officer of minor nobility.\n\nThe couple had one son: François Etienne Kellermann, who would also become a celebrated general, and at least one daughter: Marguerite Cecile. When the Revolution came, her husband fully embraced its principles and became a general of the Revolutionary armies.\n\nThe Revolution must have been a time of emotional highs and lows for Marie Anne, who accompanied her husband on campaign at several points in his career. Her husband’s great victory at Valmy must have been a cause for much celebration, but in 1793 General Kellermann was arrested and incarcerated in l’Abbaye prison. He was there for a year, only just avoiding the guillotine because his trial kept being postponed in favour of others. What an ordeal it must also have been for his wife, who was described by the Marquise de Crequy as a ‘good woman’ and a ‘woman of spirit’.\n\nWhen Napoleon became First Consul, the Kellermann’s fortunes moved quickly in the other direction. Marie Anne would see her husband become president of the senate and then in 1804, Marshal of the Empire. In 1808, she became the Duchess of Valmy.\n\nSadly, like several other of the women in this post, there is practically no information available on Marie Anne’s life between marriage and death. She must certainly have been a woman of some courage, but there is little else that can be inferred. I could find no portrait of her either.\n\nMarie Anne died in 1812. Her husband survived her for eight years and died in 1820. They are buried together at Pere Lachaise cemetery."
