        "text": "Short biography Hortense (I)\n\nChildhood\n\nAlexandre the Beauharnais had never seen his bride Rose Tascher de la Pagerie (later: Josephine). The wedding contract had already been signed by the two families when in the port of Brest their first meeting took place. The little girl Rose was raised in the French colonies (Martinique) by her french parents of impoverished nobility and thus was considered as ' Creole' . Creoles were known, in the Parisian salons under the régime van Louis XVI, for their lack of ambulatory forms and backwardness. The marriage, not surprisingly, seemed to become a failure from the beginning, Alexandre never really warmed up to his wife and seemed even somewhat emberrased by her. After the birth of their son Eugène the young marchioness , Rose the Beauharnais, became pregnant by a brief and loveless second 'embrace'. Her husband refused to believe that he was the father of the small Hortense and wanted a divorce. The ex-wife was required to withdraw herself in a female convent, where she would be surrounded by women who suffered from the same fate. Rose however took rapid measures to evade such a life . She decided to go back to Martinique, to visit her mother. With er she took her daughter Hortense but she had to leave her son Eugene in the care of his grandparents and father. This must have been aa traumatising experience for the two children as they were eah others best friends. Thus Hortense spent much of her childhood the plantation of her grandmother on Martinique. With her curly blonde hair and blue eyes she received the admiration of the black slaves, who brought her in delight with their rythmic dancing and songs. Here Hortense developed the talent to enjoy music and dancing in a free manner. Her stephfather Napoleon would later admirely describe her as 'Notre Terpsichore'.\n\n---\n\nPainting left: an idealised portrait of the Beauharnais family, painted in later years.\n\nPainting right: Hortense de Beauharnais as a toddler.\n\nShort biography Hortense (II)\n\nAdolescent years\n\nAt the start of a slave insurrection Rose and her daughter hastely escaped Martinique and sailed to Paris, where the French revolution had made an end to the reign of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette (both ended up on the scaffold). In the hell of the 'terror' Hortense's noble father and mother were taken prisoner. Hortense and her brother Eugène only wondering through Paris alone, aided by their governess a Belgian Countess de Lannoy. Alexandre de Beauharnais was one of many thousands who found their death under the guillotine. But just before her way to the scaffold Rose the Beauharnais was released from prison and set free. Now she a widow with two small children, penniless and alone on the street.\n\nTo forget the horrors of the revolution and to still enjoy as much as possibler from her young life, the widow threw herself in Parisian society and quickly befriended some influential people. Hortense was send of to a boarding school for girls, run by Madame Campan, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where she received an excellent education. She learned to make music there,and beside the usual professions also dancing and acting. She received paint and draw-lessons from the famous Jean Baptiste Isabey. Hortense excelled in everything and was loved by everyone at that school. An important event for her in this stage of her life was that she was chosen as the sweetest child of the school and as a reward she was allowed to wear an artificial rose. But her mother had no time to admire her daughter. Rose used all her charms to get in the grace of the new establishment. She dressed herself extravagantly, arranged her rented house in an expensive way and looked for rich lovers who could pay off her debts. On a day she presented her daughter during a dinerparty to an intensely pale general: Napoleon Bonaparte. Hortense could not stand him and only showed her dislike.\n\nThe 28 y/o general changed the name of his 32 y/o bride from Rose to Josephine, and from now on decided over the rest of their existence. Without the knowledge of Hortense and Eugene, the couple quickly married. While Napoleon was on a militairy expedition to Italy, where he gained one victory after another, he tried to get into his stephdaughters favour by presenting her with one present after another: parfums, watches, jewels and letters. But Hortense was still angry because Napoleon had stolen the heart of her mother and answered him on a cold tone. Napoléon wrote back: ` I you have received your friendly note (..) you are a naughty, a very naughty little girl! (..) and then, something which you know perfectly well, your mother can not be compared to any other woman in the world (..) when it would be allowed to lenarge her happiness, I would consider it as one of my sweet duties, which I have now towards you. I will feel for you like a father and you me will love like your best friend. After these words Hortense slowly softened towards the Corsican general.\n\n---\n\nleft: a snuffbox with the portraits of Napoleon, his wife Josephine and his stephchildren Eugene and Hortense.\n\nright: a miniature portrait of a young Hortense.\n\nShort biography Hortense (III)\n\nMarriage\n\nNapoléons star was rising quickly. Triumphantly he retuned from Italy and soon left again with his troops and accompanied by a procession of scientists and artists, to Egypt.On his return in Paris he started a coup, overthrew the rule of the dictoriate and raised himself to be a consul and later to first consul of the French Republic. In this role he almost had royal powers. Joséphine moved with Napoléon from their house on the Rue de la Victoire to the palace ode Luxembourg and later to the Tuileries. Much against her own will, Hortense was askd to come home from her school frequently, in order to take part in lavish banquets, balls and receptions. She became part of the sparkling company around Napoléon, which quickly got the character got of a royal court.\n\nThe weekends were spent by the family of the first consul at Chateau Malmaison. Mother and daughter became inseperable there and were always discussion interior decorations, garden lay-out and purchases of art, to enhance Malmaison. Josephine was insatiable in buying paintings of, among others, Girodet, Gérard, David, Isabey and Gros. From the Italian sculptor Canova she bought elegant sculptures. She had fairy-like gardens made with glasshouses, in which they grew exotic flowers. To give Hortense the chance to develop her pasion for the stage, Joséphine had a theatre built, in which Hortense received applause for its ballets and acting. She played the pianoforte and the harp and later arranged large ourt ballets at the Tuileries, which brought complete Parisian society in delight.\n\nWhen Hortense reached the mariageble age, Joséphine suggested her to marry with Louis Bonaparte, the younger brother of Napoleon. In their children the blood of Napoleon and Beauharnais would be united. Joséphine hoped to save her own positionthis way, as she was unable to give her huisband any children of himself and was afraid that Napoleon might divorce her for that. Hortense was shocked, she was in love with somebody else and she had a dislike for the sobre Louis, who annoyed her with his eternal complaining. But Hortense would be the good girl that she always wanted to be at school, and against her better judgement married Louis Bonaparte. Louis did not feel himself attracted to Hortense but also did what his elder brother wanted him to do. In January 1802 the inescapable and unfortunate marriage was closed. Exact nine months later Hortense brought her first child in the world. It was a son and his stephgrandfather decided that he would be named Napoleon Charles Bonaparte. Joséphine rejoiced; her position on the side of the first consul seemed saved.\n\n---\n\nleft & middle: simular portraits of Hortense\n\nright: a drawing showing Hortense playing the harp\n\nShort biography Hortense (V)\n\nQueen of Holland\n\nWith an unstopable hunger for glory, Napoleon planned to get all of Europe under Bonaparte-rule. In December 1804 he and Joséphine were crowned emperor and empress in the Notre Dame de Paris. Princess Hortense was present, wearing an empire dress strewn with diamands. In her hand she held her son Napoleon Charles, heir to his uncles throne. Almost all brothers and sisters of the emperor got a crown somewhere in Europe. His younger brother Louis Bonaparte became King of Holland, and thus Hortense Queen of Holland. After the birth of their second son Napoleon Louis in October 1803, Hortense became desperate from the news she heard: `Do you really believe that he wants send us to the Netherlands? ` she wroten to her brother Eugène, ` I cannot think about this without water in my eyes. , I will be unhappy, my God, so unhappy that I would die!'\n\nDid she have to abandon her mother, who could live no day without her? But Napoléon ignored her complaints. In June 1806 the new queen had a first sight of The Hague, that was lavishly decorated with erebogen for the occassion. Her husband was next to her in the carriage with the two princes on his lap, he called himself Lodewijk Napoleon from that moment on. Newspaper ' De Haagsche Courant' reported: `the queen wore a brownish silk robe, her hair was decorated with diamonds and pearls.\n\nNow she was a quen, Hortense decided to make the most of it. She told the pleasant Dutch admiral VerHuell that she desired to be loved by the Dutchmen, so that they would make up for all that she had to leave in France.\n\nHuis ten Bosch, where the family decided to live, was rather neglected. The interior reminded Hortense of the House of Orange, who lived in the palace untill 1795. The last stadholder Willem V now lived in exile in Germany. The wall paintings in the ballroom still told stories about acts of heroism by his anscestors.\n\nThe king started directly with expensive redecorations. He worked with unfatigable zeal for the restauratiion of his kingdom. Within limited time that he ruled, he made large improvements in all kinds of areas. The people started love their king. And Lodewijk loved Holland, which became his only love. His marriage also was regarded by him as a disaster. With his morbid jealous nature he let people spy on his wife, opened her letters and forbade her to dance during court balls. She was no longer allowed to play the piano in public either and lived as a prisoner in her apartments. Shortly before their official visit to the city of Rotterdam they had a fierce fight at home. In this mood they had to travel to Rotterdam together on July 2nd 1806, where a festive reception had been prepared. The newspaper reported: `in fornt of the 'Regthuis' was a crown with four guirlandes; everywhere was the flag out, and every resident showed his joy about this event. Hortense showed her surprise about the festive welome she received: `it was the same everywhere', she wrote in hermémoires, `the change makes people joy-full, they expect good fortune from of the new.\n\nDuring the stormy night of May 4th and 5th of the year 1807, Hortense would suffer her greatest blow: her eldest son died from an illness at Huis ten Bosch palace. Hortense was in shock and left to France, where she suffered from depressions and grief.\n\n---\n\nleft: Hortense and her son Napoleon Charles\n\nright: Hortense on a Dutch coin\n\nShort biography Hortense (VI)\n\nReturn to Holland\n\nIn a spa in the french pyrenees Hortense tried regain some of her strengths. There she made exhausting mountainwalks and climbed on the highest gletchers and mountaintops to be closer to her child in the sky. King Lodewijk Napoleon only found consolation in the Netherlands. Willem Bilderdijk (a dutch poet) made a compasionate poem:\n\n`Sink, yes, in tears! Yes! Your King-self, sink,\n\nand melt in dispair; he, for another suffered so tenderly!\n\nSo help -, so full of compassion! Him, he needs help and consolation,\n\nand motionless his eye rests on the small corps of his child.'\n\nThe king undertook a last attempt to save his marriage. He went to France and met his wife in Toulon. There a short reconsiliation took place in a logement. and Hortense became pregnant for a third time. Lodewijk never believed that this child was his. And in Holland, where everybody was informed about the bad marriage, the rumour spread that admiral VerHuell had fathered the child. Although VerHuell hadn't left The Hague for a year, Lodewijk started to believe theme rumours himself. He returned alone to his kingdom.\n\nThe Hague no longer pleased him he decided to settle in Utrecht where he demolished a large number of houses to build a new royal palace. The expensive project was hardly finished or he changed his mind again decided to make Amsterdam the capital of the Netherlands and to make her townhall on Dam square his palace. Many people tried to discourage the King with reasonable arguments: the building from the Dutch golden age was ice-cold, due to its enormous marble halls, and totally unfit to live. The head-strong King Lodewijk however refused to listen and ordered masons, carpenters, furniture makers etc. to start working.\n\nMeanwhile Napoleon had decided that he had to seperate from Josephine, for the interest of France. The ceremony took place in December 1809 in Paris, to great rejoice of the Bonapartes. The Emperor quickly remarried with the eldest daughter of the emperor of Austria: Archduchess Marie Louise, who quickly gave him a son.\n\nNapoleon, who still considered and treated Hortense as his daughter, ordered her to return to the Netherlands and to reconsile herself with her husband. Unhappily, she travelled to Utrecht with her second sonl Napoleon Louis. Her youngest son Louis Napoleon was left behind with his grandmother in Paris.\n\nIn her apartments along river 'Drift' in Utrecht, Hortense led an isolated and sickly life. During a militairy parade on the inner-court of the palace she showed herself to the public, which was responded by the public with shouts of joy (a reason for Lodewijk to keep his wife even more away from the public). During the holy mass in the court chappel with its brand-new churchsilver and its superb choirs Hortense was touched deeply and she often went there to pray for her son. After the Easter days of 1810 however, the King decided to move Utrecht with his family and to go to the new capital. During the ceremonial entrance of Amsterdam, the queen was so weak that citizens who looked at her in the coach callen her ` queen misérable! Notre pauvre reine! Its appearance astonished everyone. People had heard that the queen led a frivolous life in Paris. But her looks did not answer to the picture of a frivolous woman.\n\n`The palace in Amsterdam is a former townhall had been and had a very beautiful interior, ` wrote Hortense in her mémoires, `The king had done everything possible to beautify it but still, one could not imagine a sadder place to live (..) my Dutch court ladies seemed very nice but I hardly knew them; most of them were new. Therefore I spent my days reading alone in my apartments. One usually warned me late in the afternoon that the king expected at his table; I came. During the meal he didn't speak a word against me. After the meal the king let his fingers wander over the opened piano. He drew his son on his lap, cuddled him, took him along on the balcony which looked out on the square. Whenever the people saw them, cheers would arouse. Then the king came back in, and seated himself behind the piano where he recited some French songs or hummed a melody. I was seated on a chair, only looking at the things that happened in the room, without saying a word. I withdrew myself at 9 o'clock after I had wished him a good night. That was the only words we saidd to eachother. Thus my days in Amsterdam were spent. After some weeks queen Hortense became even more ill, so ill that people feared she was dying. In the summer of 1810 she carefully asked the king permission to leave for Palace het Loo. He agreed reluctantly but kept its son in Amsterdam. After a short stay at het Loo, she left to take the waters in Plombières. She would never see The Netherlands back again. Her husband man abdicated a month later at Pavillion Welgelegen in Haarlem and appointed his eldest surviving son as the next king: Lodewijk Napoleon II. The five-year-old child was on the throne for two weeks. TAfter that period his uncle emperor Napoleon had him brought to Paris and incorperated the Kingdon in the French Empire.\n\n---\n\nbelow: three portraits of a bejewelled Hortense\n\nEmpress Eugenie\n\nEmpress Eugenie (from wikipedia)\n\nDona María Eugenia Ignacia Agustina de Palafox y Kirkpatrick, Countess de Teba, who became Empress Eugénie(May 5, 1826 - July 11, 1920) was Empress Consort of France (1853-1871), the wife of Napoleon III, emperor of the French.\n\nThe last Empress of the French was born in Granada, Spain to Don Cipriano de Palafox y Portocarrero 1785-1839, Count de Teba, Count de Montijo, marquis de Algava and duke of Peñaranda, a grandee of Spain, and his half-Scottish, half-Spanish wife, Maria Manuela Kirkpatrick, a daughter of the Scots-born William Kirckpatrick of Closeburn, who became U.S. Consul to Malaga and later was a wholesale wine merchant. Eugenia's older sister, María Francisca de Sales, also known as Paca (1825-1860), who inherited most of the family honours, married the Duke of Alba in 1849. Until her own marriage in 1853, Eugénie variously used the titles of countess of Teba or countess of Montijo, but some family titles were legally inherited by her elder sister, through which they passed to the House of Alba. After the death of her father Eugenia became 9th Countess of Teba, and is named as such in the Almanach de Gotha (1901 edition). After Eugenia's demise all titles of the Montijo family came to the Fitz-James's (the Dukes of Alba and Berwick). Eugénie de Montijo, as she became known in France, was educated in Paris, at the fashionable convent of the Sacre Coeur, where she received an indelibly Catholic training. When Prince Louis Napoleon became president of the Second Republic she appeared with her mother at the several balls given by the \"prince-president\" at the Elysee Palace, and it was there that she met the future emperor, whom she wed on January 30, 1853, not long after he had been rebuffed in his attempts to marry first Princess Carola of Vasa (later Queen of Saxony), a granddaughter of the deposed King of Swedeb and then Queen Victoria's teenage niece, Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langeburg.\n\nRead more about Empress Eugenie of the French in this wikipedia article\n\n-\n\nabove, left: Eugenie and her son Napoleon Eugene, by Winterhaller.\n\nabove, right: Eugenie by Winterhaller\n\nbelow: Eugenie and her ladies, by Winterhaller.
