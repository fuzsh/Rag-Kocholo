        "text": "October 27, 2018\n\n4 stars to the story of Napoleon’s stepdaughter, Hortense! ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️\n\nI am a huge Sandra Gulland fan. Her Josephine B. (Bonaparte) trilogy books are some of my favorite historical fiction works. I was thrilled that she would be taking on Josephine’s daughter’s story in The Game of Hope.\n\nHortense’s story is classified as young adult but is suitable for adults, too. Beginning four short years after the Terror of the French Revolution, Hortense is enrolled in a boarding school. She is talented with music, art, and academics, but she daydreams of Christophe, a military officer and friend of her brother’s.\n\nHortense’s mother, Josephine, has recently married Napoleon Bonaparte of whom Hortense is not a fan. Her beloved father was beheaded during the Terror, and she sees Napoleon in sharp contrast. If Hortense does not accept Napoleon, what will happen to her future?\n\nSandra Gulland deftly researches her chosen topics and writes with flawless ease. Hortense’s story is based on her real autobiography, as well as other historical archives.\n\nHortense is faced with a life she does not want in a time much different than our own. What fate will she be saddled with as a result? Her story is filled with the details of her school days, while it also is firmly entrenched on a backdrop of Napoleon’s rise to power. I loved hearing about Josephine and Napoleon from a different perspective, from that of Hortense, and how her life experiences are shaped by those around her.\n\nRich in historical details while also being approachable to young adult and adult audiences alike, Game of Hope is yet another solid, enchanting, and enthralling effort from Sandra Gulland.\n\nThank you to Historical Fiction Virtual Blog Tours and Amy Bruno for the invite and to the author for an electronic copy. I also own a physical copy I bought because Gulland is a favorite author.\n\nMy reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com\n\nJune 29, 2018\n\nAs much as I love historical fiction, this novel did not hit the mark for me.\n\nIt was an okay read but nothing more beyond that. The story barely graded on events going on at the time and instead mainly focused on the character of Hortense. This is understandable as she is the main character and the novel is marketed being about her story.\n\nHowever, I found she was somewhat of a boring and bland character. Adding on to that, she did not come across as being a teenager and seemed to be more relatable to a 10-12 year old in maturity.\n\nOverall, it was an okay and average read but I wish that there was more of a plot. There didn’t seem to be anything happening and read more similar to a daily diary from a young girl.\n\n***Thank you to Penguin Random House Canada for sending me a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review***\n\nSeptember 17, 2019\n\nFifteen year old Hortense grew up in a violent time, when many aristocrats were guillotined during the French Revolution, including her father. Her brother Eugene, a soldier, is fighting with their stepfather’s army in Egypt. Their stepfather is General Bonaparte, who is so opposite of her late dashing father. Her consolation and hope is a handsome aide of the Genera’s army, fighting along her brother in Egypt.\n\nAt some points, the story is heavy with dialogue, making the read choppy. The descriptions between dialogues are not very engaging. I didn’t care for all those step-by-step descriptions. And there is some unnecessary repetition in descriptions, making the pace very slow. On the other hand, since this book is for YA maybe this style-of-writing is engaging for them.\n\nFebruary 23, 2018\n\nWhat does the future hold for the timid daughter of a beautiful woman; the step-child of a ruthless man?\n\nWhen the story opens in 1798, Hortense de Beauharnais, whose father was guillotined during the last days of the Terror in France, is 15. Josephine, her notorious mother, is married to Napoleon Bonaparte, who is in Egypt leading the French army, and Hortense lives at a boarding school for aristocratic girls, nursing her talents, her sorrows and her secrets passions.\n\nSandra Gulland returns to the French Revolutionary era to tell the personal story of the young Hortense during the momentous rise of Napoleon from leading General to First Consul. Hers is the story of every young woman – influenced by momentous events, yet shaped much more by the incidents of her own life -- her guilt over her father’s death, her sorrow over the loss of a school friend, her passion for music.\n\nHortense is a well-rounded character, who grows in maturity over the two-year period of the novel. The setting seethes with the flavor of the era and the history weaves seamlessly into the story. Without giving anything away, the story ends on an uplifting note, as Hortense grows in empathy.\n\nDelightfully written, as we expect from Ms. Gulland, thought perhaps a trifle slow-paced at times, this would be an excellent read for young adults, especially those with a love for history and for delicate romance.\n\n*I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.*\n\nMay 18, 2018\n\nThe Game of Hope by Sandra Gulland\n\nDNF @ page 133 - 2 stars\n\nThe Game of Hope is a YA historical fiction novel that follows Hortense de Beauharnais, Napoleon's step-daughter. Honestly, I have no clue what the plot of this novel is because the 133 pages I read were a hodgepodge of girl drama, sordid family dealings, and music. It was all very boring and I'm quite sad because I thought this was going to be a novel I would love. I do enjoy historical fiction re-imaginings and I had high expectations for this one, not absurdly high, but I thought it would be a nice YA historical fiction that would at least garner four stars. What I read only garners 2 stars. It's not bad, but it is bland and drab. This book lacks substance, life, and vitality. It feels like it wants to be dramatic and over the top, but is bogged down by Gulland's disconnected writing style. The style has no passion and it left me feeling so disconnected from the story and the characters. Historical fiction has to be fierce and passionate because it is recreating the past and presenting a multitude of characters. I cared about no one and was interested in no plot. I am so sad that this wasn't a new favorite.\n\nWhimsical Writing Scale: 2\n\nThe main female character is Hortense. She is bland, but she does have a drive for composing music, which is an interesting passion. However, her actions in the last chapter towards her friend, Mouse, in revealing the truth behind her mother's death was very cruel and it left a sour taste in my mouth. I was over this novel by that point, but her cruelty and it being swept under the rug so easily was just the nail on the coffin for this novel.\n\nKick-Butt Heroine Scale: 1.5\n\nThere are a multitude of characters and I can't be bothered with any of them. The drama is petty and manages to be uninteresting. There is also some weird romantic subplot with Jaydin, her music teacher, and I just wasn't feeling it or interested in it. Basically, I couldn't be bothered and found there to be too many characters and not enough development to hold my interest.\n\nCharacter Scale: 2\n\nOverall, I do think The Game of Hope will be a favorite for many fans of the Napoleonic period. I was sadly disappointed by this book and did not finish it. I don't regret my decision to DNF this novel because I feel like I would've probably ended up disliking it even more by the end of the novel.\n\nPlotastic Scale: 2\n\nCover Thoughts: I love this cover so much. The art is stunning.\n\nThank you, First to Read and Viking Books (Penguin), for providing me with a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.\n\nFebruary 12, 2018\n\nAnother excellent novel by Sandra Gulland. Some very apt words from Net Galley:\n\n\"Sandra Gulland demonstrates a masterful grasp that she has on history in her book The Game of Hope .... Gulland ... has no problem displaying her understanding of post-revolution France and therefore invites her readers into a well-developed universe of Hortense de Beauharnais.\n\nThis book is well written for younger audiences of teenage girls, connecting them to the past with common issues that all preteen girls face in a timeless fashion. Gulland does not pump Hortense’s 1780 mind full of 2017 ideas, which is a genuinely refreshing change to the typical YA historical novel\n\n… for most preteen girls, this is still a wonderful introduction to history through the eyes of someone just like them, who truly lived, breathed, thought and felt in the same ways that they do.\"\n\nOctober 8, 2018\n\n“The Game of Hope” by Sandra Gulland combines two of my favorite genres: Young Adult and Historical fiction! It is a coming of age story of Hortense de Beauharnais, the stepdaughter of Napoleon. I feel like her story will resonate with a lot of readers.\n\nIt’s fascinating to see the events surrounding Napoleon Bonaparte and his leadership, as well as the aftermath of the French Revolution, through the eyes of his teenage stepdaughter. I love how Ms. Gulland portrays the family and their relationships with one another. There is often a lot of drama, but their relationships evolve throughout the course of the story. Throughout these evolutions, one can sense the importance of family. “The Game of Hope” also shows the value of remembering the past and forgiving. I especially enjoy reading about the relationship between Hortense and her brother. There are some great friendships and side characters as well.\n\n“The Game of Hope” is rich with historical accuracy and details! It’s also told in a way that will resonate with young adults (it’s not too bogged down with the details and it has faster paced chapters). I find it fascinating to see what Hortense’s life would be like. She experiences so many everyday things (like living at a boarding school and having her first crush); but also huge, out of the ordinary events (like surviving mobs and moving into a palace). The story is a secular read, so it does contain some more content than the books I usually feature. I think it would be appropriate for mature teens (see content below for more information).\n\n“The Game of Hope” is a fascinating glimpse into the life of a teenage girl who finds herself caught in events beyond her control. The book is a beautiful testament to family, friendship and learning to be confident in oneself.\n\nContent: I give this book a PG-13 rating. There’s more content in this book than the books I normally read, so rather than listing each instance, here’s a few examples: talk of a woman’s menstrual cycle; a girl mentions she is chaste; the word Negro is used in context: a main character finds a book about sex and is disgusted; mention of demons and spirits; talk of people having affairs; people tell fortunes; the word whore is used; a girl refers to her breasts; a dress is low cut; talk of a person committing suicide; reference to people being drunk.\n\nRating: I give this book 4 stars.\n\nGenre: Historical fiction; Young Adult\n\nI want to thank Sandra Gulland, Penguin Teen, Penguin Random House and Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tours for the complimentary copy of this book for review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I express in this review are my own. This is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s CFR 16, Part 255.\n\nFebruary 26, 2018\n\nGame of Hope by Sandra Gulland\n\nOne of the pleasures of reading historical novels is that the best ones bring alive the past in a way no history book can. Game of Hope is such a book.\n\nHortense Beauharnais, age 15, is the daughter of Josephine Bonaparte and step-daughter of Napoleon.\n\nHortense is a student at a lovely girls’ boarding school outside of Paris, near her mother’s estate Malmaison. A serious, bookish, musical girl, rather prim, plain and straight laced in a school that encourages scholarly interests in girls, Hortense is as unlike her beautiful, extravagant, sensual mother, Josephine as it is possible to be.\n\nThe novel begins in 1798, four years after the Reign of Terror in France, after the Revolution. The horror and violence of the Reign are still very much part of Hortense and her classmates’ memories. Each of them has been traumatized by the excesses of the Reign through loss of family or parents. Hortense reveres her father who was beheaded during this time although she hardly knew him. She is also critical of her mother whom she loves but considers frivolous and unreliable. As Hortense matures, both of her views are drastically altered.\n\nI enjoyed this historical novel because it portrayed a convincing picture of France after the Revolution by focussing on an historical figure of whom too little is known. Other characters included members of the Bonaparte family, in particular, Napoleon’s dreadful sister Caroline, and brother Louis. Both were heartily disliked by Hortense.\n\nIf accuracy is the ultimate way to show respect to your readers then Sandra Gulland has succeeded brilliantly. She is a painstaking researcher. Many of the scenes in the novel are based on actual events. She treats us to a number of historical details that bring this fascinating era to life, including Hortense’s musical compositions, letters written by the headmistress of the boarding school, Campan, Hortense’s music teacher, Hyacinthe Jadin.\n\nI should mention that I was fortunate to receive an advanced review copy of this engaging novel.\n\nRoberta Rich\n\nJune 13, 2018\n\nI was excited to win this book in a Goodreads Giveaway (thank you Penguin Random House Canada!). I do enjoy this period of French history, and the novel's premise is a fascinating one; Hortense, a teenage girl, has lost her father to the guillotine as part of 'The Terror'. Several years after his death, her mother remarries. But she doesn't marry just anyone! Oh no, she marries General Napoleon Bonaparte, the rising star of the French military!\n\nWhen the story opens, Napoleon is away in Egypt on campaign (the Battle of the Pyramids, anyone?) with Hortense's brother, Eugene, acting as one of his, Napoleon's, aides. Hortense is a pupil of The Institute, a school for girls run by maitresse Campan, a much admired headmistress and confidante. She has two staunch friends, Mouse and Em. The three of them are related but each also lost a parent to Robespierre's reign of terror that followed the Revolution.\n\nFor the most part it's an interesting tale, based on Hortense's own letters. We get to see the beginnings of Napoleon's rise to power in Parisian politics, but we also bear witness to a side of the man we maybe wouldn't necessarily consider; that of the family man. A man that loves his wife, writes her passionate love letters, and adores his stepdaughter, Hortense.\n\nI will be the first to admit that I am not the target audience for this novel. I would think this is a book that's aimed predominantly at teenage girls. There’s a fair amount of romantic speculation and musing. As one would expect, such affections are primarily centred upon the dashing young officers that surround Napoleon on a constant basis.\n\nHistorical fact shapes events, with a few embellishments (and deletions of actual people) here and there to aid the story (as per the author’s own notes at the end). Hortense’s life is certainly intriguing, and the book succeeded in making me want to discover more about her life. I actually did wonder if the author was planning a follow up book, covering a later period, but I guess not since she provides a synopsis of happenings beyond the end of the story presented.\n\nAll in all, it’s an entertaining read. It isn’t especially challenging, and, as mentioned, it isn’t written middle-aged men, but still, I enjoyed it greatly. There are plenty of highs and lows, if not a huge number of genuine surprises. To anyone familiar with the time period, the usual ‘suspects’ feature prominently; fancy dress balls, sickness, finding a husband, flamboyant outfits, dancing, war, pianoforte, needlework, rides in carriages, and so on.\n\nAs ever, I am EXTREMELY grateful I was not alive in the late 18th century :)\n\nMay 18, 2018\n\nThis is my second novel by Sandra Gulland and her first venture into YA, fitting as Hortense is a young adult herself.\n\nThis is the first time reading anything about Hortense and I quite enjoyed it. To get glimpses of the final years of the Revolution, though the eyes of the young, added that extra emotional element, it wasn't hard to feel empathy for what they went through. The scars left were not always the physical ones. Hortense didn’t ask to be stepdaughter of the famous Bonaparte but that was her lot in life. She is only 15 years old and has already experienced so much, her character was well-developed with memories and guilt of the past, along with a future not always of her choosing.\n\nIt’s definite from past books by this author that she has done an enormous amount of research into this time, based on actual events she stayed true to history.\n\nThe Game of Hope is a book that I was sad to see end, I would like to know where the next chapter in her life takes her (a sequel would be nice).\n\nThank you to the publisher (via Netgalley) for an advanced copy of this book in exchange for honest review.\n\nOctober 21, 2018\n\nIt’s been forever since I read a YA novel. I kind of go through phases with YA novels. Sometimes I end up reading like 5 or 6 at a time, and then I don’t read any for like months.\n\nCurrently I’m in the ‘I haven’t read any YA for months’ phase. So when this book came up for review, I was about to pass until I read the summary. I love Napoleon and the French Revolution and when I saw that this book was about Napoleon’s step daughter, Hortense, I was excited to read it….YA or not.\n\nSo I think what was hard about this book was the genre and time setting. I haven’t read a lot of historical fiction YA novels that I love. Let’s be honest, history isn’t really all that appealing to the mass readers of YA so you kind of have to be light on the history part.\n\nFor readers like me who love history, this book barely scratched the surface of the French Revolution. Had this been an adult book, I would have expected it to be oozing historical details, but it’s not. It’s a young adult book so that means its a little on the lighter side of history and as an adult reader I can see the difference.\n\nIt’s a nice introduction for younger readers and there is a focus on so I think the younger audiences will love it and adult readers will probably be in the ‘it’s good but not great’ camp.\n\nSandra Gulland has written several other adult novels about Josephine Bonaparte which I have heard rave reviews about, so it sounds like expectations were high for this novel. I am not sure why she opted to write more of a YA novel with this one. Just because Hortense was younger doesn’t necessarily mean that her story needs to be written as a YA novel.\n\nHortense herself was a little hard for me to take. She came across is way too selfish and it was a little off putting for me. It wasn’t awful, but for me it just wasn’t what I was expecting. I understood that she was in this privileged lifestyle but for me as the main character I hoped that she would have been a little less self serving.\n\nThe good thing about YA novels is they are usually pretty easy to read so I was able to read this one in a couple of days. It was ok, it wasn’t great. The characters fell short for me and I just wasn’t fully into the story because I felt like there was so much history that could have come alive in this story but just didn’t and I am not sure why that was so untapped.\n\nIf you are looking for a light read with a little history that you can get through relatively quickly, then you will probably like this book but for me I just felt like I needed more. I liked it enough to keep on reading but I wasn’t in love with it in the way that I had hoped.\n\nSee my full review here\n\nJune 18, 2018\n\n★★★✬☆ The Game of Hope opens in 1798. France is in shambles four years after Robespierre was executed. Our narrator is in a boarding school full of nobility who fear that The Terror Robespierre wreaked could happen again. I will admit to my ignorance of this time period, but Sandra Gulland navigated this potential gap in her reader's knowledge by providing a very brief historical note at the beginning of the novel to give them the required information.\n\n“You grew up in a violent time,” she said, her voice soft. “You witnessed things no child should ever have to see. But memories are like words on a wax tablet: they can be erased. You are smart, and creative, and talented. You can become whatever you wish, but first, you must learn to direct your thoughts—even your dreams.” She tucked a stray strand of my hair back up under my nightcap. “Remember: you are safe now.”\n\nThe story follows Hortense, the 15 year old stepdaughter of Napoleon Bonaparte, during her final year at The Institute -- a finishing school that houses a number of orphaned and/or traumatized children of nobility following the Terror. The characters are rich and come alive on the page, and I found myself caring for each of them deeply.\n\nI appreciated the discussion of difficult topics surrounding that period, including the slave trade (and the differences between the American and French views pertaining to \"freedom\"), arranged marriage versus romantic love, and a woman's \"place.\" Despite the time-frame, I found the writing and central characters to have a feminist spirit while still adhering to the expectations of the time period. I really appreciated the historical accuracy to the period while still giving the characters dreams and desires beyond that.\n\n“Kitchens?”\n\n“You need to see them because we’re taught how to cook.”\n\nEliza stopped on the landing, holding Henry by the neck (strangling him). “Slaves do not perform that function?”\n\n“We have a cook, but Maîtresse Campan believes it’s important that we learn to look after ourselves. We make our own beds and tidy our rooms, sew our own smocks and sashes, cook—”\n\n“In America, slaves perform all that,” Eliza informed me with a somewhat snobbish tone. As if we in France weren’t as advanced.\n\n“Slavery is against the law here,” I said.\n\nHer eyes went wide. “No slaves ?”\n\n“Not since the Revolution. We believe in equality.”\n\n“In America, likewise!”\n\n“Equality for all ,” I said, swinging open the heavy door.\n\nThis novel is a coming of age tale, but it is about more than hope, growing up, and young love. It is about living after a political nightmare, the trauma, of moving on and covers the brief period of time between the Revolution and the Napoleonic Periods through a character-driven perspective of the events. True to the time period, there are discussions of arranged marriage, etiquette, and the art of courting; however, romance is not the central component of this story. If you are looking for a historical romance novel of this time period, I think you will be disappointed.\n\nThe book is very well researched and I really appreciated the historical commentary at the end of the book describing what was from the historical record. I was a bit put off by the abrupt ending and although I was happy to see those gaps filled in from a historical standpoint, I wish the narrative just didn't end. I also expected that the game of hope (tarot cards) would hold a larger part of the narrative due to the title of the novel, but perhaps it is my personal love for the supernatural harboring this desire!\n\nThank you First to Read for providing me with a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.\n\nBlog | Twitter\n\nJune 25, 2018\n\nThe Game of Hope is a historical fiction novel for Teens that focuses on the life of Hortense de Beauharnais, Napoleon Bonaparte's 15-year-old stepdaughter. The story is set in 1798 in France, not long after the horrors during the Reign of Terror.\n\nThis was a quiet, slowly paced book that focuses on Hortense's life. It's a coming-of-age story of a girl struggling to deal with the after effects of The Terror and her unique family life, while still dealing with the normal struggles of teenage girls of that era.\n\nThe Game of Hope had an interesting focus and premise and readers should enjoy getting to see a different side to Napoleon as a family man as he rises to power. But I was hoping for more historical detail. Readers learn about the history from the sidelines and only through Hortense' point of view as she goes about her daily life. Gulland provides a broad sense of post-Revolution France, but I had to draw on previous books (namely Madame Tussaud by Michelle Moran) for a clearer picture of the devastation and horror of the time. Without a clearer picture of the era outside of Hortense' small world, I don't know if teens will truly grasp how horrific the Terror was for French citizens.\n\nThis is a good introduction of French history for teen girls featuring a protagonist their own age who lived a unique life as part of the Boneparte family and continues to deal with the after effects of the French Revolution.\n\nJune 17, 2018\n\n1 sentence summary: Gilmore Girls-esque storyline set in post-Revolution France.\n\nFull Review:\n\nI was a beta reader and also received an ARC of the US edition. I love Sandra Gulland’s Josphine B. Trilogy, and although Game of Hope is geared towards a younger audience, I still enjoyed it. This is her first YA novel, so don’t go into it expecting it to be exactly the same as her other novels.\n\nHortense, Napoleon Bonaparte’s stepdaughter, has to navigate the society that her mother’s recent remarriage has put her in while also dealing with her PTSD from the Reign of Terror. There’s no huge climax that the plot works towards, but if you like historical fiction and coming of age struggles interspersed with snarky snide comments, then I highly recommend this novel :)\n\nJuly 1, 2018\n\nThis was just another solid page turner from Gulland.\n\nJune 26, 2018\n\nI received a copy of this book through Penguin's First to Read program. This is my honest review.\n\nI wanted to like this book. I usually really enjoy historical fiction, but this book fell flat for me. I kind of feel like reading this book would be like reading Rob Kardashian's memoir if he was only famous because his mother married Bruce (now Caitlyn) Jenner. And I may have been more forgiving of the book if I'd remembered while reading it that it was based on Hortense's actual autobiography, but at the same time, I feel like I'd probably just rather read her autobiography.\n\nWhat I found in this story was a main character who is just completely full of herself. Sure, she implies that she gets so much satisfaction from helping others, especially the younger girls at her school, but it comes across like a person bragging about feeding the homeless or donating to charity.\n\nRead the rest of my review on my blog. --> http://justanothergirlandherbooks.blo...\n\nOctober 17, 2018\n\nThe Game of Hope focuses on the teen years of Napoleon’s step-daughter, Hortense. While Napoleon and her mother are away, Hortense attends a boarding school whose mistress once served Marie Antoinette. Hortense has to deal with friendship, rumors about her mother’s love affair, accepting her father’s death, and accepting Napoleon as her step-father. Most of all, Hortense wonders what her future will be and what role she will play in the emerging of the Napoleonic era.\n\nI really thought this book was a cute, charming, young adult novel. I really like how the author made Hortense into a real teen. While it is set in the early Napoleonic era, there are many issues that will resonate with the teenagers of today. Hortense has to deal with school, friendships, family, and boys. Thus, Hortense was a very identifiable and realistic character. I also liked how Hortense had her flaws. She can be judgmental, stubborn, and selfish at times. However, she is a determined and independent woman. She wants to follow her dream, which is to compose. Hortense also finds encouragement and support in unlikely places. Thus, Hortense learns to rely on and trust others.\n\nOverall, this is a coming-of-age story that deals with self-identify, acceptance, and loss. I thought all of the historical figures were well-rounded, especially Napoleon. He is portrayed as a man that loves and supports his step-daughter. The novel was written with meticulous historical detail. There were a few paranormal elements in The Game of Hope that I thought were unnecessary. Still, there was never a dull moment, and it left me wanting more. I wish that the author would write one more sequel because I did not want this novel to end. Hortense was such a fascinating character, and I hope that she will be a subject in future works! The Game of Hope is a feast for fans of Michelle Moran, Carolyn Meyer, and Katherine Longshore!\n\n(Note: This book was given to me as part of a blog tour in exchange for an honest review.)\n\nOctober 20, 2018\n\nThe Game of Hope is the historical fiction and young adult book that is set in the late eighteenth century in Paris, France. Hortense attends boarding school after the terrors of French Revolution. Then her life has changed when her mother is married to Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nThis is an interesting story. I do not know that it is based on true events, but that is a new fact to me. I am in intermediate level of French, so I recognize some words that are included in the book. I like the cover because it is lovely and connects to the overall plot. There are some parts in this story that are not appealing to me, but it is okay. I think that the writing is good and not complex. Overall, I like this book very much because it is easy to read and the plot is superb.\n\nJune 10, 2018\n\nThe second time very recently that I have been looking forward to a new book by an author that I quite like. Gulland wrote the Josephine B trilogy that I re-read almost every summer. It's just a happy place for me. So I was looking forward to The Game of Hope, whose story is from Josephine's daughter Hortense's perspective. I had high hopes, looking for her view on The Terror, the Revolution, the rise of Napoleon. But I actually couldn't finish it. I felt as though I was reading a YA novel, and it was not appealing.\n\nJuly 9, 2018\n\nI enjoyed this unique, believable, and well-researched story!\n\nNovember 12, 2018\n\n“The Game of Hope” by Sandra Gulland is a novel that stands out among other YA offerings. The cover, with its soft colours and depiction of a pretty young woman in regency attire, combined with the tagline about love make it look for all the world like a sappy, mushy romance story – so, the type of thing that I normally stay far, far away from. But there’s something else in the tagline that draws attention: the stepdaughter of Napoleon. Oh? I was intrigued. France’s post Reign of Terror years aren’t something I usually see in historical fiction, especially YA, so I decided to give it a try, mildly optimistic that it would hold more than the simple love story that the cover tries so desperately to sell you on. And I ended up really enjoying this a lot more than I thought I might! Yes, it’s a simple story, and yes, romance is pretty central to it, but the setting is so rich and the main character so genuine that it’s hard not to like. Spoilers follow.\n\nI’ll toss in my general disclaimer for good measure. I’m not a historian and only know what I either remember from my long-ago school years or what I learn through late-night internet searches and the occasional documentary, so I’m not here to nitpick the historical details – I’m more interested in the story elements and immersion in the time period.\n\nFor Hortense de Beauharnais, the last few years have been tumultuous. During the Reign of Terror, her father was executed, and her mother imprisoned. When the terror ended, her mother married Napoleon Bonaparte. Hortense still isn’t sure how she feels about her stepfather, a man so different from her father that it’s practically an insult to compare them. If that wasn’t enough, she’s still expected to go through the societal motions of an average sixteen-year-old girl. She’s enrolled in a finishing school with her cousin and best friend, where she obtains the polished education that a young woman needs. She also copes with Napoleon’s sister, who seems determined to make her life as miserable as possible. Worse? She’s been told that it’s time to find a husband, a task that her mother is determined to tackle with an enthusiasm that Hortense does not share. She already has her eyes on Christophe Duroc, a major in the military who serves alongside Napoleon as one of his trusted aides. Unfortunately, Christophe barely knows she exists…and even if he did, he’s hardly the sort of man that her mother would choose for her. Hortense just wants to work through the trauma of her past and look forward to what’s ahead, but with France’s political atmosphere constantly shifting, her future hangs in the balance.\n\nThis is a very easy book to get into. Some reviewers have remarked that it’s a bit slow…and they’re right. It’s slow in the sense that it’s a calm sort of story. This isn’t a tale of a girl overthrowing a regime, a lost hero staking her claim to a great fortune, or a leading lady battling supernatural evils; instead, it’s a real slice-of-life tale about a young woman coming of age in a tumultuous, uncertain time. The book reads like Hortense’s diary, taking us through her day to day activities and walking us through the changes that she and her family are in the centre of. It’s a smooth read, flowing nicely from one day to the next, and while this not may be an epic yarn of excitement, there’s plenty going on in Hortense’s life to keep a reader engaged. I mean, my normal reads are fantasy and sci-fi and I found it very easy to settle in with a cup of tea and a warm blanket and spend hours happily following Hortense through her struggles. She’s a very genuine character and her conflicts, though centuries in the past, are highly relatable and easy to get caught up in.\n\nIt’s the little details of this book that make it pop. Hortense has plenty of problems between her schooling, her complicated relationship with her stepfather and his family, her mother, the political shifts, her yearning for romance, and her secret desire to become a composer. It would be easy for these to simply become a checklist for the character, but they’re all given life through their details. The creative process is captured very well through Hortense’s music (emotion fuels her best pieces, prolonged periods of not wanting to compose, guilt at disappointing her teacher, and embarrassment when her work is recognized) and, though it is a small part of her story, makes it feel more real. At one point, after her status is elevated and she is about to enter a social event, she practices mouthing p-words (like “prune”) because her mother has told her that it sets her lips in a more attractive position. She occasionally laments on the discomforts of being a woman, like when she’s on her period or bemoaning that a dress has a low cut despite her lack of cleavage to show off or trying to hide her crooked teeth from potential suitors. These are the sorts of things that bring a setting to life and make us see Hortense not only as our narrator, but also a fully-developed character. Gulland has a deft hand for these details and weaves them expertly into the plot, creating an authentic setting that just sort of melts into the reading experience.\n\nMy sole complaint with the story is how abruptly it ended. The last few pages are full of excitement: Hortense attends the masquerade and learns that Christophe is also there, she dances with Christophe and learns that he likes her, she also dances with a more unpleasant older (though wealthier and more important) man who publicly asks for her hand in marriage…which she rather rudely rejects, she learns that her music teacher has fallen victim to consumption, she informs her school’s head mistress that an important donor (the man who asked for her hand) likes little girls a little too much, and she’s about to step onto the stage for the first time to play the piece she composed (at Napoleon’s personal request). The final scene is Hortense sitting down to play as she thinks of her late instructor. It’s sad and bittersweet, and I suppose it’s a strong note to end on, but with so much that happened before that moment, I desperately wanted to follow Hortense into what happened next. There are so many unresolved plotlines and so much that occurs within the last pages that it almost seems unnatural to end here. Though, given what Gulland tells us of the characters’ lives in the afterward, I suppose I can understand why the story was ended where it was since everyone seems to end up either miserable or dead in the following years, Hortense being no exception. So, I understand it, but I still felt a little sad at reaching the last page and realizing that it was the last page.\n\nThe real treat of “The Game of Hope” is being fully immersed in another time. With this being a Young Adult novel, it doesn’t get into the true nitty gritty of the post Reign of Terror era, but there’s still plenty to take you back to this tumultuous time. This isn’t just set-dressing to showcase a pretty protagonist, this is the world in which Hortense lives, the world that shapes her. Being the age that she is, Hortense is shielded from some of the more dangerous events of the time (Napoleon’s coup to overthrow the government, for example), but her mother and brother provide excellent insights into these events while Hortense herself allows us to experience life in the aftermath. That’s really what Hortense provides: a genuine look into the life the follows big historical events. When I read historical fiction, I want to be transported back to that time and feel like I’m right there with the protagonist, and that’s exactly how I felt while reading this novel. Gulland has clearly done her research into this time, and the setting is beautifully established and maintained, giving us a poignant look into what a young woman’s life looked like in this era. This is a time period that I don’t often see represented in YA fiction (or, indeed, fiction in general), so I was very delighted to get such a rich portrayal of Hortense’s life and the political environment that surrounded her.\n\nI’ll also add, on that note, that I very much enjoyed the commentary from Gulland at the end regarding the changes that must be made to adapt a real person’s life into a historical fiction novel. I’ve never really given the matter much thought, so I definitely learned something from it. In general, the supplementary material at the end is helpful for both educational reasons and basic understanding purposes (how the new calendar established after the Revolution worked, for example). There’s a list of characters and a glossary, just in case this is your first historical story and you need a little help with some of the terminology. I don’t normally comment on extra material, but this was so thorough and helpful that I had to toss in a little shout-out to it.\n\nThe romance in this is pretty tame. Despite the cover trying to convince you otherwise, and while it’s a central theme, I didn’t think it was overwhelming. Perhaps I’ve just read too many YA novels that ultimately end with the protagonist snogging her beloved while her dejected best friend cries quietly in a corner, but I thought the romance was actually quite compelling…and I usually hate romance on principle. To be fair, a lot of what makes it interesting is probably the era – women weren’t really permitted to just blatantly pursue the men they desired; they had to be at their refined best in hopes that a man of high status would arrange a marriage with their parents. This makes Hortense’s infatuation with Christophe much more interesting since she has to navigate it in a way that’s socially acceptable. It also helps that, while her spousal future is very much on her mind, it isn’t the only thing that she thinks about – with everything going on around her, she’s very present in the here-and-now and isn’t just mooning away constantly. The relationship drama is only part of her story, not the entirety of it, and I think this balanced portrayal leads to it being very palatable…at least for this reader, who despises all things romance on principle.\n\nHortense is an ideal main character for this novel. Her position as Napoleon’s stepdaughter gives her significance and a reason for being present in some of the things that she experiences while her age makes her an accessible viewpoint for teen readers. I’ve read a few complaints that Hortense is passive or boring, but I would argue that she is authentic. It must be understood going into this novel that now, women in Western society enjoy many rights that allow them to stand up for themselves and serve as their own advocates…this was not the case in late-1700’s France. Hortense is a young lady stuck in a difficult time. Her past is wrought with pain and her future is uncertain, yet somehow society expects her to pick up her skirts, hold her head high, and carry on as if nothing has happened. And Hortense certainly tries, but even she can’t deny that she is damaged by what she has experienced trepidatious of what lies ahead. The first-person narrative speaks of frustration and occasional grief at the events that play out (and, of course, moments of joy and contentment), but when she does try to speak for herself, she’s often chastised by the guiding figures around her. I can appreciate this and, in turn, appreciate the young woman who is attempting to make the best of a very constrained life. She’s a compelling character with plenty of aspirations wrapped up in the form of a girl often restrained by society. Her words speak to the character that she’s not permitted to show, and her thoughts and observations tell us more than spoken words ever could. She’s a woman of her time, and that’s not a bad thing – she offers us a genuine voice of someone living and coming of age in an era that was wrought with tension and often didn’t permit women to speak their minds. I appreciated that Gulland made Hortense so convincing and didn’t fall to the classic “modern woman in period dress goes against society” trope that I see so often in historical fiction.\n\nHortense isn’t the only intriguing character to be found here. Her mother, Josephine is just as strongly characterized as Hortense herself (no surprise, really, given that Gulland has written about Josephine in the past, too). While we only see Josephine through Hortense’s eyes, we get a very clear understanding of this character and her motivations, and that their changing world is just as difficult on her as it is on her daughter. I also loved Eugene, Hortense’s brother, and the strong sibling relationship that the pair shared. Caroline, Napoleon’s sister, is also well-fleshed out as a girl with a strong personality who stops at nothing to get what she wants (and, as a result, is viewed as boorish in a society the encourages grace and subtlety) while also having some vulnerabilities and insecurities. There are some great characters here, all wonderfully developed and brought to life through Hortense’s interactions and carefully crafted relationships with them.\n\nThe real treat regarding characters is the depiction of Napoleon Bonaparte. A big reason that I picked this book up was to see how France’s saviour was characterized through the eyes of a stepdaughter who was less-than-excited to be part of the Bonaparte family (or “the clan,” as she calls them). Seeing this relationship develop is fascinating. While Hortense is initially rather cold and distant toward the man that her mother married (especially when marital issues arise between them), she warms up to him over the couple years that the novel covers and shows us a different side to the General. Here, we see him not as an imposing figure, but as a family man who honestly seems as uncertain of Hortense and guiding her through womanhood as she is of him. There are some heartwarming moments between them, like when he takes a special interest in encouraging her dreams of composing or when he gifts her a horse after learning that she’s always wanted to properly ride one (even her own father refused this on the grounds that horses weren’t gifts for girls), and these serve to humanize him beyond what we learn in textbooks at school. Gulland deftly crafts the transformation from two strangers thrown into the same family as the result of a marriage to an almost tender father-daughter bond that feels both very natural and very realistic to anyone who’s ever experienced a parent remarrying.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a couple of characters that I wished had been given just a little more attention, if only because the afterward suggests that they were important figures in Hortense’s life. Both Em and Mouse are touted as Hortense’s best friends, yet the only character growth that I really saw of Em was when she caught the pox and had to deal with the loss of her beauty and then later her feelings towards a marriage that she never wanted; meanwhile, Mouse just sort of lingers in the background, never really doing anything. These two girls are apparently mentioned in Hortense’s personal letters a lot, yet I felt a stronger bond between Hortense and Caroline than I did regarding Em and Mouse. I’m sure part of this is because of where the novel picks up and the fact that Hortense must leave school partway through as her social situation changes, but I just never felt the strong friendship that supposedly existed between them.\n\nI suppose the Christophe is also rather weakly characterized, but I’m willing to give that a pass since we only see him as Hortense sees him, and she’s rather infatuated with him from afar despite not knowing much about him, so I don’t really expect much deep character development. Since he’s only just started to notice her at the novel’s conclusion, I’m sure that we’d have seen more had the book’s scope extended out further.\n\nI’m ultimately very glad that I gave “The Game of Hope” a fair chance. I think this is the sort of novel that you need to be aware of what you’re getting into before you open it. This is a smooth, historically rich and accurate novel about a young woman coming of age and navigating the various societal changes taking place around her while also trying to find love in a difficult time. It’s a true slice-of-life story that shows you the good, the bad, and the ugly of Hortense’s time, all rife with little details that make the story pop. The characters are mostly beautifully fleshed out and their relationships with Hortense are carefully crafted. The image of Napoleon as a sometimes-uncertain family man is a refreshing take on the character and everything feels very authentic and genuine. On the downside, the story ends rather abruptly and some of the characters fall a little flat in comparison to their historical importance to the real Hortense. I give this one Four Stars – despite its flaws, it kept me engaged and entertained for hours at a time, and I can always appreciate a good historical novel that successfully takes me to another era.\n\nJuly 18, 2020\n\nEen heerlijke zomerread, zeker als je in Frankrijk zelf bent. Hoewel dit boek voor een deel fictie is, heeft Sandra Gulland zich zeer goed ingelezen in de historische bronnen. Beide bij aanvang en afsluiting van het boek staat een historische onderbouwing, wat het boek nog beter maakt. Ik zou zo een tweede deel van dit boek lezen over de rest van Hortenses leven.\n\nMay 8, 2018\n\nThis book is all I'll be thinking about for the next three months. Where to begin...\n\nSandra Gulland has done it again, drawing me in to the Napoleonic Age and making me fall in love with the colourful personalities of the era all over. Gulland has tackled the period before in her magnificent trilogy focusing on the life of Josephine Bonaparte, the mother of our heroine, Hortense. In this novel, teen-aged Hortense de Beauharnais takes center stage. Gulland renders her with charm, humour, and complexity- a young woman haunted by the violent execution of her fashionable father (whom she idolizes) and struggling to accept the changes in her family brought about by her mother's marriage to General Napoleon Bonaparte, whom Hortense views as an intruder in their life. Hortense visibly matures over the course of the novel, and her interactions with the various characters around her likewise shift and change. Her relationship with her brother Eugene is a highlight throughout, the two being extremely close. Hortense's relationship with her mother, too, is fascinating and complicated, as Hortense is unable to understand many of Josephine's actions and decisions, and finds herself doubting her as a consequence.\n\nAs ever, the novel is meticulously researched. Sandra Gulland's understanding of the very real people about whom she's writing is so profound she practically breathes life into them. She remains the sole fiction writer who truly understands Napoleon, Josephine & Co. and writes them accordingly.\n\nIt isn't at all necessary to have read Gulland's Josephine B. Trilogy in order to get sucked into this novel. However, I found that it compliments the older series extremely well, spanning roughly the same time period as its second installment, I was able to see the events of that book from a drastically different perspective. Napoleon and Josephine, naturally, do not feature as prominently in this novel, but it was wonderful to view them through Hortense's critical eyes.\n\nIt's probably too much to hope for, but should she ever write another novel on Napoleonic France, I wouldn't hesitate to read it!\n\n(as a side note, considering how good and in-depth her research is, she could probably write an honest-to-God biography on Josephine or Hortense that wouldn't make me want to claw my eyes out, because yes many of them are That Bad)\n\nApril 26, 2018\n\nThe Game of Hope is a coming-of-age story that simultaneously keeps the reader rooted in the post-Revolutionary era and serves as a reminder that growing up is complicated no matter when you live. As Napoleon Bonaparte's stepdaughter, Hortense de Beauharnais witnesses endless changes around her, but she has no say in any of what occurs, putting her in a unique position of being both in the center and on the fringes of France's increasingly important family.\n\nMs. Gulland is a pro at avoiding a pitfall that usually makes me see red: writing historical figures with modern mentalities. I loved the way she explored Hortense's desires and hopes within the historical context instead of transforming her into a modern woman chafing against the late-18th/early-19th century world. Ms. Gulland further does not shy away from including the physical and emotional changes that go along with growing up, deftly showing how a teenage girl walks a fine (and sometimes cruel) line between child and adult. It was a joy to watch her relationships change and deepen with her mother (the future Empress Josephine), stepfather, brother (Eugene), friends, mentors, and love interest. Hortense's world was developed in such a way that at the conclusion, I had no desire to leave it.\n\n[This review is based on a much-appreciated ARC]\n\nJanuary 12, 2019\n\n2.75. Slow and windy, with not a lot to keep you engaged. I also was unsure of the plot for pretty much the entire book. I felt like the afterward held all the answers... was I supposed to care that she played the piano at the end of the book? It didn’t feel like a culmination, it felt like the author had to pause and decided to share the rest of the story by debriefing everyone instead of continuing to write the book.\n\nI know little history about the Terror, or France during the revolution and Napoleons reign. After reading this book I don’t feel like I have learned anything.\n\nEven the title just references a game that pops up in different ways, but don’t hold any actual meaning to the story... ugh. I wanted so much more!\n\nShelved as 'did-not-finish'\n\nJuly 9, 2019\n\nI was over halfway through with this and nothing was happening. Having looked up this historical figure to see why she was important, I was expecting the \"you're going to marry Louis\" bomb to drop literally at any moment, but it just wasn't coming and wasn't coming, so I flipped through the rest of the book to see if it would ever happen, and it doesn't. The second half of the book is just Hortense pining after a man she'll never end up marrying and doing other basic daily things. There's no PLOT really - it's just a long, boring diary. Not impressed.\n\nSeptember 23, 2018\n\nI enjoyed this book - but I do have to say I was slightly disappointed by it. I picked it up to read because I absolutely love Sandra Gulland’s series on Joséphine Bonaparte, so a series on her daughter (the step-daughter of Napoleon) immediately spiked my interest. My favourite part of the book was the afterward which went into an explanation of fact vs fiction in the matter of this book - it’s always interesting to gain an understanding of why historical fiction authors makes the decisions they make for the sake of a story. Regardless, Sandra Gulland wrote another lovely historical fiction novel, and she remains one of my favourite historical fiction authors that I’ve ever read. If anything, this book made me want to re-read her Joséphine series.\n\nJune 26, 2019\n\nWell researched but the story is gorgeously boring. And I somewhat hoped that it would go beyond. But if it was an autobiography or perhaps in a more adult manner I might enjoy it as Hortense de Beauharnais had a certainly interesting past.\n\nJune 14, 2020\n\nI am not super educated on this era of history, but this book seemed quite informative- albeit fiction. I enjoyed all the references to look up after reading. I also enjoyed that this book was YA , allowing me to understand the material without a lot of older language."
