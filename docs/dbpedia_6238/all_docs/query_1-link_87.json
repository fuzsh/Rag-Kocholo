        "text": "History\n\n100.5 was previously known as WVOR-FM, a hot adult contemporary music station for many years. The station was owned by the Lincoln Group before being sold to American Radio Systems (ARS), a forerunner of CBS Radio. ARS was forced to sell the station to Jacor to meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ownership restrictions. Jacor would later be absorbed by Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia).\n\nWVOR-FM rebranded from \"Mix 100.5\" to \"The Drive\" in 2006, leaning its direction towards adult album alternative; the WVOR calls would be placed on sister station WISY, in nearby Canandaigua. The station is still a Mediabase hot adult contemporary reporter, however. The AAA lean was dropped in 2012."
