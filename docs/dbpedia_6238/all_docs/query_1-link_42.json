        "text": "When I checked Billboard Dec 5, I noticed re-entry of \"Christmas Portrait\".\n\n(Barry Manilow's latest Christmas Album debuts and Elvis Presley's Christmas Duets last year [which contained a duet with Olivia Newton-John] is also re-entry.)\n\nChristmas Portrait\n\n#193 - Billboard 200 - Dec 5, 2009\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002GHQ...veASIN=B000002GHQ&creative=373489&camp=211189\n\nI heard \"Merry Christmas Darling\" on Internet radio 7 times today!! WLNP, KTDZ, WMHK, WLTE, WNWV, KRVE & WROZ\n\n(And \"Superstar\" on KONO & \"Top of the World\" on CFOB. Charlie Tuna re-aired interview with Karen, too!! Karen mentioned Japan! CFOB will repeat, probably CJRL,too. WSOX & QWTU may air 'Charlie Tuna the '70s' this weekend.)\n\nLast September I read an article about Christmas radio program that mentioned Richard.\n\nAfter that I saw the song list and demo.\n\nThe song list has\n\nCarpenters Christmas Medley (Richard Carpenter) at HOUR 8,\n\nMerry Christmas Darling credit was Carpenters.\n\nChristmas Across the Lands\n\nNow in it's 10th Anniversary Edition, Christmas Across the Lands was originally called Christmas At Home, but due to it's\n\nglobal nature is now called Christmas Across the Lands.\n\nFrom across USA and Canada, many foreign countries as far away as Dubai, Phillipines, Sri Lanka, New Zealand,\n\nIreland, and more. Plus we are honored to donate our show to the Armed Forces Network-Radio, and Canadian Forces\n\nNetwork-Europe. you know why we say \"Across The Lands!\"\n\nThe concept of the show came to creator Randy Sherwyn in the 1980's while listening to other shows that were the same\n\nyear after year. In fact one year Randy opened up the show, and the CD's had coffee stains on them! He decided then\n\nthat an annually updated Christmas show would one day be his goal. The show is written, hosted, and produced by\n\nRandy. Every year though he leans on a few others for some much appreciated assistance. People like Joel Denver of\n\nAll Access play a valueable part in the shows success. This year Randy welcomes back Robin Marshall as the \"First\n\nLady\" of Christmas Across the Lands.\n\nWhy not take a listen to a sample of this years's show and consider Christmas Across the Lands for your\n\nstation.{play}cal2008demo{/play}\n\nhttp://www.smspacific.net/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=47\n\nChristmas for Troops and YOUR Hometown!\n\nSeptember 25th, 2009\n\n(Ft. Myers, Florida)-- Randy Sherwyn, host of the popular Christmas Across the Lands 12 Hour Christmas Radio Show announced today that the fresh, new show for 2009 has been completed.\n\nChristmas Across the Lands will be heard worldwide on the Armed Forces Network-Radio, and via the Canadian Forces Network/Europe again this year.

Songs are carefully selected to appeal to the whole family, from the classics by Bing, Nat, Johnny to Mariah, Buffett, Beach Boys, and Rascal Flatts.\n\nChristmas Across the Lands is donated to our service men and women around the world. Radio stations wishing to air the show can do so for the low program cost of $129.00. No barter spots, 10 min local avails.

I heard ad couple of times but the date/time was not mentioned. Maybe they said big day or something. Christmas Day?\n\nI was able to hear AFN AM. There was AFN or older FEN SW but there is not SW anymore. I cannot hear AFN at home lately.\n\nCFN has Internet radio, but they sometimes stopped just a minute before American Top 40 repeated. Hope I can hear Richard and \"Merry Christmas Darling\".\n\nWould you post the radio station links and time when you will find? Thanks.\n\nSakura"
