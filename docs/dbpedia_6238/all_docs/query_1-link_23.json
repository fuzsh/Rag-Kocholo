This is a list of all those kind folks who've taken time out of their busy schedule to show me around and see their studios and transmitter sites. It also includes those who've given me guidance and support throughout the years as well. For that, I thank you\n\n-- Mike Fitzpatrick\n\nP.S. If you don't see your name on here, please don't think I am excluding you. I have a bad time keeping track of all the names of those who've given me the tours and it means I most likely misplaced your business card. But please don't think I don't appreciate your time to show me around. Feel free to drop me an email if you think your name was excluded, so I can give you the proper credit you deserve!"
