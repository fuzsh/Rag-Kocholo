        "text": "Radio station in Webster, New York\n\nWLGZ-FM (102.7 MHz) is a commercial FM radio station licensed to Webster, New York, and serving the Rochester metropolitan area. It broadcasts an oldies/classic hits radio format and is owned by DJRO Broadcasting LLC.[2] The radio studios and offices are in Rochester's east side.\n\nWLGZ has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 6,000 watts. The transmitter tower is on Ferrano Street in Rochester, near the Erie Canal.[3] WLGZ broadcasts using HD Radio technology. Its digital subchannel broadcasts an Urban Contemporary format known as \"105.5 The Beat.\" The subchannel feeds a 250 watt FM translator, W288CS at 105.5 MHz.[4]\n\nOn August 23, 1991, the station signed on the air. The original call sign was WLMF. On October 30, 1992, the station changed its call letters to WFUL, on February 3, 1993, to WDCZ, on August 1, 1997, to WDCZ-FM, on January 1, 2004, to WRCI.[5]\n\nOn February 11, 2008, the station, then owned by Crawford Broadcasting, ended its contemporary Christian format as WRCI \"102.7 The Light\" to make way for \"Legends 102.7\", a hybrid of oldies and adult standards. The \"Legends\" format was already featured on 990 AM WLGZ, which after simulcasting of the FM signal turned to a Christian talk and teaching format. AM 990 now carries the call letters WDCX, along with much of the programming of its sister station in Buffalo, WDCX-FM.\n\nWLGZ was purchased by DJRA Broadcasting on January 1, 2010. Following WLGZ's sale from Crawford to DJRA, most adult standards titles were dropped from the station's playlist and WLGZ morphed into a straightforward oldies outlet featuring hits of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The format change for WLGZ has succeeded in increasing the station's audience.\n\nThe station's license was assigned to DJRO Broadcasting LLC on June 1, 2012. A noteworthy fact is that this station has not completely discarded songs and artists from the 1960s and early 1970s which are not commonly heard on commercial radio. However, WLGZ has adapted its playlist to feature a greater proportion of songs from the 1980s, as are heard on classic hits outlets.\n\nOn September 21, 2017, at 6 p.m., WLGZ-FM launched an urban contemporary format branded as \"105.5 The Beat\" on its HD2 subchannel, fed on translator W288CS.[6]"
