Exactly one year later, he proposed at there, too.\n\nGiven their history with the festival, friends suggested they tie the knot there.\n\n\"At first we were like, 'Hahahaha,'\" Chase recalled. \"Then we were like—'Wait a minute.'\"\n\nChristina added, \"It started out as a joke, and it went relaly far and we're happy we're here now.\"\n\n\"Really, really happy.\"\n\nThe couple's marriage on Friday doubled as a show titled \"Chase Padgett Gets Married.\"\n\nConsider it Christina's Fringe debut.\n\nThe ceremony was followed by a variety show that featured acts by the couple's friends.\n\nChristina and Chase even received a surprise toast from Colin Mochrie, who is performing at the festival this week.\n\n\"We had no idea Colin was going to pop up,\" Christina told CTV News Edmonton.\n\n\"We couldn't have been more delighted,\" her husband said. \"It was the best.\"\n\nFunds from ticket sales to the show will help the couple pay for their Hawaii honeymoon in the New Year.\n\nThe couple is in the process of immigrating to the U.S."
