        "text": "On June 13 at 7:30 p.m., Colin Mochrie and his comedic partner in crime, Brad Sherwood will present a night of comedy they’re calling, “Asking for Trouble,” at The Music Hall in Portsmouth. Seacoastonline sat down with Mochrie to discuss the show and get into the roots of a life lived on stage, scripted or otherwise.\n\nSeacoastonline: What’s the importance of a good laugh from time to time?\n\nMochrie: I believe there’s been scientific studies that claim that it actually makes you healthier with regard to mental health. I know when the lockdown was happening and everyone was sort of stuck in their homes, people were catching up on their comfort food, sitcoms, watching standup specials… I do feel sometimes that it’s an essential service. People do need to laugh, especially these days. It seems like every day there’s a new little challenge that can benefit from getting laughter going.\n\nSeacoastonline: I do think it’s an essential service. I love telling jokes and getting a rise out of people – me being a person who considers himself ore of a sit-down comedian than anything else… I’m wondering – as a professional comedian/actor who has been at this for decades now, do you feel that social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok are opening the doors to a greater audience? My feed is made up of an abundance of comedy reels, and I feel all the better for it. Has it become a little easier to cast a wider net?\n\nMochrie: Absolutely. Looking back in “my time” growing up, there was … you know we almost had to use carrier pigeons to attain a not so similar result. Having social media certainly helps. YouTube, parts of your sketch on Instagram or TikTok. Today it feels like you can now get the attention of a substantial audience in a month that in the past would take years to build.\n\nSeacoastonline: What can folks expect when they come out to see “Asking for Trouble”? Or is it in the name?\n\nMochrie: Well, we’ll see. We like to say it’s a live version of “Whose Line is it Anyway” without the dead weight. You know who I’m talking about. (Ryan) Stiles and (Wayne) Brady. They deaden the show. They suck the energy out of the room. (Laughs.) But seriously, the show will be a blast. It’s interactive. It’s family friendly. Our fan base is made up of kids from ages 8 to 80. It’s a good fun time with no politics involved. Goofy fun nonsense. And then after you leave you can go on and continue hating 50% of the country. (Laughs.)\n\nDoing comedy is the most death-defying thing I’ll do in my life. I’ll never jump out of a plane, and I’ll never swim with sharks, but I will go onstage with nothing prepared. I look forward to it every single time.\n\nSeacoastonline: How’d you find yourself trying your hand at comedy initially? Was there a moment or experience in particular that led you down the path of earning a living making people laugh?\n\nMochrie: Yeah. There was a moment that is still so crystal clear in my mind, actually. I was a very bookish child. My plan was to be a marine biologist, so I was heavy into sciences in high school. I was quiet and quite shy, and a friend dared me to try out for the school play. So, I did. I got that part. I got my first laugh and that was pretty much the end of everything up to that point. It was like, ‘no, this is what I want for the rest of my life – to get this feeling and this reaction.’ So, I got into theatre and made the long, slow climb up to lower stardom. (Laughs.)\n\nSeacoastonline: Who were your earliest influences? Who helped shape or forge that path you initially followed?\n\nMochrie: Oh, gosh, there’s so many. Anyone that made me laugh at all I sort of studied and stole from. Staring with Chaplin and Buster Keaton, then Bob Hope and the Bing Crosby Road movies. Jack Benny. The Dick Van Dyke show was a big influence. SCTV. Monty Python. Anyone that even made me giggle a little I became a fan of and would start to watch and figure out, ‘what are they doing and how can I use this?’\n\nSeacoastonline: You’ve been on both ends of the comedic spectrum – scripted and improv. What do you appreciate about both, but what ultimately do you prefer about improv and not really knowing how a joke is going to form, and further, land?\n\nMochrie: Both of them are different muscles. I love the puzzle aspect of scripted scenes where you’re trying to get across whatever the writer has set up. You’re also sort of navigating network executives and directors, etc. So, you’re trying to be true to the character and get those laughs. You can see where they’re going to come with the script. And with improv, I love that no one knows what is to blame what we do, except for us. We can’t say, ‘well, that’s how it was written.’ If we sucked it’s because we sucked and if we do well, it’s because we did well. I like having that responsibility. I’d much rather fail on my own rather than fail with something somebody made me do.\n\nSeacoastonline: What do you think your batting average is with regard to taking your swing and hitting a joke out of the park?\n\nMochrie: (Laughs.) Um, I would say we do pretty good. I think people kind of come into our shows knowing what to expect a little bit. And by that, I mean, they know what we’re doing and have seen us on “Whose Line…” So, oftentimes, they’re already coming in as a fan, which is a good head start (laughs). If we dump in the bed, we’ve really dumped in the bed. That said, certainly we’re not batting 100%. That’s impossible. There are times when a show can fall apart due to the nature of it. But I’d say we’re at 80-90%. I am so going to live to regret this… (Laughs.) I mean, at the end of the day, we’ve got a 50/50 chance to succeed when we set out onto a stage.\n\nSeacoastonline: Those are still hall of fame numbers.\n\nMochrie: (Laughs.) I appreciate your perspective, Chris.\n\nSeacoastonline: I tried reading your entire resume, but it’s as long as Tolstoy’s “War and Peace.” I shy away from things that exceed 300 pages in length. That said, there were a couple of things that caught my eye… The Red Green Show being one. I think about that show every time I set out to be handy around the house. Or really anytime I see duct tape. Goosebumps. Ted Lasso. These are all wildly random and an extremely small sample size of the work you’ve done throughout your career. How do you find yourself into these roles? What do you get out of each role you take on? Do you learn anything from the experiences?\n\nMochrie: I feel very fortunate in that a lot of people I knew wound up getting into a position of power so that they could hire me. That makes it so much easier when you can find really talented friends who are on their way up. With the “Red Green Show,” Patrick McKenna, who played Harold, were really good friends who were at Second City together. It was actually a Second City sketch that we did that is where the character of Harold came from.\n\nWith Ted Lasso, years ago there was a Second City alumni who was part of a festival in Ireland, in Kilkenny. The year I was there, Dan Castellaneta from the Simpsons was there, as was George Wendt. And George had brought his nephew, Jason Sudeikis. Jason and I kind of got on very well. I thought he was funny and asked him to join us for one of the sets. He was really good. I don’t want to take credit for his success, but you know… (Chuckles). OK, maybe I had something to do with it… (Laughs). I’d bump into him from time to time due to the Second City stuff; I saw him in Las Vegas, I’d see him in New York… And then he called me during the last season of “Ted Lasso,” and said, ‘hey, we’re filtering in little easter eggs that are about things that really inspired us, and I was wondering if you and Ryan (Stiles) would play a couple of sports commentators on the show.’ We said, ‘absolutely.’ It’s such a great show and it was really nice to be a small part of it.\n\nSeacoastonline: You’ve been alluding to it, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention “Whose Line is it Anyway?” in this series of questions. I’m a product of the 90s. Born in the 80s, but really a product of the 90s through and through. Thus, Drew Carey was a big deal to me. Were you excited to work alongside him when the American version of that show kicked off? How was he to work with?\n\nMochrie: You could not ask for a better person to work with. If you’re going to know a millionaire, make sure he's as kind and generous as Drew. Every year he would take the cast and crews of both of his shows (\"The Drew Carey Show” and “Whose Line…”) on trips with him. We’d go to Vegas every year. He’s just the sweetest person to work with. I have nothing but great memories with him.\n\nSeacoastonline: How did the American version of the show compare to the UK version, which predated the American one in your career lineage?\n\nMochrie: It was pretty much the same thing. It was all the same producers and crew, kind of. So everyone was on the same page. The big difference was in Britain there was no censorship. You could pretty much say anything. That changed immediately when we crossed the sea (laughs). It was mostly sexual stuff, but also, we didn’t really know where the line was. There were some things that would be bleeped that were kind of harmless, but your mind to a totally different place. I think we were doing our second taping where there was a scene where I had to kiss Greg Proops. So, I kissed him. And then this voice came over the speaker that said, ‘can you make up something else, please?’ In the previous scene I had killed three women and thrown them out the window and it was fine, but kissing a man, apparently, was going to destroy the fabric of society.\n\nSeacoastonline: Who is the funniest person you’ve ever met?\n\nMochrie: Oh. Gosh. Well, I have to say – and I’ve been very fortunate to know so many funny people in my life – my wife is the funniest (Debra McGrath). She’s consistently funny, she does great characters, she does hoity, she does dumb… She’s very funny.\n\nSeacoastonline: Do you make yourself laugh? What’s the funniest joke you’ve told that made you laugh as it was presenting itself?\n\nMochrie: Oh, geez. It sounds weird, but I don’t actually listen to my jokes as I’m saying them. They just sort of come out and I am often just as surprised as the audience.\n\nSeacoastonline: You’re heading to the Music Hall for an improv show alongside your longtime partner in crime (comedy?), Brad Sherwood. The two of you have been at it for over two decades, so obviously you’re enjoying each other’s company. That or you’re just trying to keep the lights on…\n\nMochrie: Well, obviously, every show we do is like an opening and closing night. That audience are the only people in the world that are going to see that show, because everything starts with a suggestion from the audience. So, everything that happens is a unique organism unto itself. So that’s always fun. And I love the fact that there are no guarantees. When we walk out there it’s just an ‘okay, hope this works…’\n\nSeacoastonline: Do you still get butterflies when you head out onto stage?\n\nMochrie: Yeah, I mean, there is that little thing just before you walk on. You can hear the audience and think, ‘my god, they’re excited to see a show that we don’t have at this particular moment…’ But once I’m out there I think it’s actually the most relaxed that I am in my life. Which is weird. (Laughs.)\n\nSeacoastonline: What do you appreciate about the audience participation aspect of your show? As a performer, it’s got to feel pretty special to be able to get the room involved in your routine (if you can call it a routine). Do people still surprise you with their additions to the dialogue?\n\nMochrie: Yeah, they do. I mean, there’s still a section of the audience that you want to punch after they answer a question. I mean, really, for a sound effects scene you want us to do a gynecologist? Grow up! (Laughs.) The most work we do in our shows is actually asking for things we want to get from our audience where we don’t get the jokey answer that they actually have to put a little bit of thought into. Overall, it’s wonderful and there are times when we’re taken aback by the imagination and things that audience members come up with. That’s a bonus. Anything that keeps us a little off balance. That’s where I think we have the most fun and is usually where the magic happens."
