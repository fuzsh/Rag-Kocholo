        "text": "About the Festival\n\nThe Winnipeg Comedy Festival was the brainchild of Lara Rae and CBC Radio's Tom Anniko, who worked in partnership with the Gas Station Arts Centre to bring the first comedy festival to life in 2002. Since its founding year, the festival remains the GSAC's flagship event and has come to include year-round outreach programs, rural tours, workshops, and television broadcasts that attract over 2 million viewers annually thanks to the hard work of the WCF team.

The hit CBC Radio show features Canada's hottest comedians going toe to toe, debating topics in the news and on the minds of Canadians. The audience picks the winners based on who delivered the best logic and laughs, the best rhetoric and rant. Facts and force of argument can earn points, but in the end, jokes will likely win the match. Comedy trumps all. The Debaters airs Saturdays at 6:30pm (7:00 NT), Mondays at 8:30pm (9:00 NT) on CBC Radio One. The WFC was nominated for a Gemini in the category of Best Host of a Comedy or Variety Show (Bubbles). The number of Galas staged each year grew from two to four and then six in the festival's 5th year.
