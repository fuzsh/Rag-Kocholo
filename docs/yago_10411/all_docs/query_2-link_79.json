        "text": "Comedians Colin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood, known for their work on TV show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?”, will improvise new material from audience suggestions and participation during their Dec. 1 show at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. Mochrie spoke with us about his career.\n\nHow do you prepare for an improv show?\n\nIt’s just clearing your mind and being relaxed enough to walk out on stage with absolutely no preconceived ideas and just working off Brad and working off what the audience gives us. It’s really the best gig for lazy people.\n\nYou’ve been improvising for 40 years. What keeps you going?\n\nUnlike rock bands, we’re not doing our greatest hits. Every night, it’s a show that only that audience is going to see. It really is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing, so we never get bored with it.\n\nWhat do you think makes your partnership with Brad successful?\n\nIt’s been over 25 years now, so we know each other really well. We also have this sort of big brother, little irritating brother relationship. He’s the little irritating brother. He’s a prankster. I think that it comes off on stage. You can see that we enjoy each other.\n\nWhat can we expect at your Irvine show?\n\nJust two hours of fun. You’re not going to learn anything. Hopefully you’ll work those stomach muscles. It’s family-friendly. We know that a lot of fans of the show come with their families, so we’re always aware of that."
