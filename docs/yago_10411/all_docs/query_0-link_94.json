        "text": "Colin Mochrie was born on Nov. 30, 1957 in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, Scotland and grew up in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. After taking a role in his high school play on a whim, Mochrie directed his passions toward acting and comedy, which he pursued via the Studio 58 theater school in Vancouver, Canada following graduation in 1975. Mochrie remained with Studio 58 until 1986, at which point he relocated to Toronto, Canada and joined the famed Second City improv troupe. During his tenure with the group, Mochrie began working with fellow comedian Ryan Stiles, with whom he'd form a long-lasting partnership. Mochrie's involvement with Second City also introduced him to director and comedian Debra McGrath, whom he'd go on to marry in 1989. That same year, Mochrie began appearing on the British improv comedy television series \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" (Channel 4 1988-1999); following several guest appearances, he became a regular cast member on the program in 1993. In 1998, both Mochrie and Stiles relocated to the United States for the show's American spin-off, \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" (ABC/ABC Family 1998-2003, 2005-07). Throughout the 2000s, Mochrie found small roles in film and television, as well as recurring parts on several short-lived series like \"Seven Little Monsters\" (PBS 2000-03), \"Blackfly\" (Global 2001-02), and \"Getting Along Famously\" (CBC 2006), among others. Mochrie reteamed with Stiles and fellow former cast members for a reboot of \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" (The CW 2013-), hosted by comedian Aisha Tyler."
