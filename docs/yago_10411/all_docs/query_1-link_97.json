        "text": "Ileana Ros-Lehtinen\n\nIleana Ros-Lehtinen validated the acceptance of transgender people during her time as a member of Congress. She represented the 27th congressional district of Florida from 1989 to 2019. She took her stand on a national level for her trans son, Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen.\n\nHer bravery in fighting for the LGTBQ community earned her a tribute in 2018 as the first Cuban-American elected to Congress by the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute. She was also the first and foremost Republican in the House to defend marriage parity. We're not sure if her advocacy had anything to do with it, but Rodrigo now serves at the National Center of Transgender Equality as the executive director.\n\nJane Lynch\n\nThe \"Glee\" actress came out to her parents by writing them a letter. The star was aware that she was a lesbian from a young age but only managed to open up to her parents about it when she was 32 years old.\n\nAllegedly, Lynch waited such a long time to tell them as she was scared of how they may react to the news, and she was worried that they would not be very accepting. To her surprise, her parents were highly welcoming of the news, and the star stated that they really embraced her and took it very well. Lynch is now happily married to psychologist Lara Embry.\n\nMatt Bomer\n\nFor most, the job of coming out is a tough one. In Hollywood, the pressure is higher since all eyes are on you, and your announcement will most likely make tabloid headlines. It was no different for Matt Bomer when he came out in 2012.\n\nThe star opened up about how his parents reacted at first when he told them. For them, who are conservative and Christian, it was difficult to accept their son's news at first. Many years have passed since the star came out to his parents, and he admits that only now are things getting a little better. We guess some parents need many years to process that their child is part of the LGBTQ community.\n\nHari Nef\n\nHari Nef is an actress, model, and writer who disrupted the fashion industry in 2015 when she was the first transgender model ever to get a signed deal with IMG Models. She started pursuing a degree in theater in 2011 at Columbia University, and this was around the same time that she started transitioning.\n\nRecently, she played one of the Barbie dolls in the highly anticipated \"Barbie\" flick that came out in the summer of 2023. Reportedly, her parents were very supportive when she went through the transitioning process. Her dad stated that he loved his kid as a boy, and now he loves her as a daughter.\n\nWanda Sykes\n\nWanda Sykes has been named one of the funniest stand-up comedians and is one of America's most prominent LGBTQ+ supporters. Her wit and humor have opened up so many doors for her in her career. In the fall of 2008, Sykes came out as a lesbian while at a rally in Las Vegas for same-sex marriage.\n\nJust a month prior to this, the star secretly married her wife, Alex Niedbalski, after which the pair became parents in 2009. Sykes has openly admitted that coming out to her conservative parents was a tough pill for them to swallow at first. They even refused to attend her wedding, but Sykes has thankfully since then reconciled with them.\n\nSamira Wiley\n\nSamira Wiley is mostly known for her portrayal as Poussey Washington in the iconic series \"Orange Is the New Black.\" For the four seasons that she starred in the show, she became a moving role model for audiences in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nRecently, the star said that it took a few years for her to come to terms with her sexuality and to get to the point of opening up to the world about it. The star's father is one hundred percent behind her, as he has even made a surprise appearance in front of Congress to stand up for his daughter's lesbian rights.\n\nSean Hayes\n\nThe \"Will & Grace\" star Sean Hayes is often celebrated as a gay trailblazer. He opened up on the tricky process of coming out to his family in an interview with \"People.\" He came out as gay in 1988 at the age of 18 years old and has admitted that the news was not well received by his mother, especially at first.\n\nThe star revealed that his mother wrote him a 10-page essay in light of him coming out to her. Despite the initial reaction of his mother, which wasn't exactly welcoming of their gay son, Hayes said that she ended up coming to terms with things, and she was super supportive of her gay son, all the way up until her passing in 2018.\n\nDan Bucatinsky\n\nThe actor Dan Bucatinsky, of Latin and Jewish descent, has reported that he only came out to his parents about being gay in his mid-20s. Before that, he was too scared to break the news, thinking that they wouldn't take it too well.\n\nThe Emmy Award winner also stated that his mother knew long before he came out about it to her. The star has even gone on to write a book dubbed \"Does This Baby Make Me Look Straight?: Confessions of a Gay Dad,\" in which the star shares the tale of how he and his hubby became parents to their youngsters Eliza and Jonah.\n\nNoah Schnapp\n\nNoah Schnapp is known for his performance in the 12-time Emmy-award-winning Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Schnapp publicly opened up about his sexuality shortly after his Stranger Things character, Will Byers, did the exact same thing on the show.\n\nSchnapp admitted that his family said that they already knew about him being gay long before he even came out to them about it. The actor has since attended his first Pride Parade affair in New York City in 2023 and stated that it was such a liberating and emancipating experience to see his parents and friends on the sideline cheering him on. Go, Noah!\n\nNeil Patrick Harris\n\nNeil Patrick Harris was the first openly gay man to host the Academy Awards ceremony in the year 2015. He came out in 2006, after slowly hinting about his sexuality, and then finally revealed that he was gay to his parents.\n\nAfter the deed of telling his parents, it was now time to come out to the rest of the world. In November 2006, the star came out to the world as gay in an interview in \"People.\" The star alleged that his parents were concerned with the news at first, but slowly and surely, they started to accept the new notion of their son being gay.\n\nJim Parsons\n\nJim Parsons, the \"Big Bang Theory\" star, publicly came out as gay in 2012. He had already come out to his close family members prior to that and has also opened up about how it was a challenging task to come out to his mother, Judy Parsons.\n\nJim Parsons lost his dad in 2001 to a motor crash accident, and when he came out to his mother in 2003, she was already struggling with the act of recently becoming a widow, so it was not an easy task to break this news to her. It all worked out, though, and nowadays, Parsons is married to his hubby, Todd Spiewak.\n\nMegan Fox\n\nIn 2022, Megan Fox gave a moving interview with \"Glamour\" and opened up about fame, motherhood, and how she guides her children in the world of gender identity. Fox has three sons: Journey, Bodhi, and Noah.\n\nShe has also been open about her oldest son Noah's wishes to wear dresses to express himself since he was a bambino at the age of two and all the intimidation that he had to put up with because of that. She explained that she has taught her kids about gender identity and how to carry oneself proudly no matter what gender you identify as.\n\nEugene Levy\n\nEugene Levy is an award-winning actor, producer, and writer. His son, Daniel Levy, followed in his father's footsteps in the world of acting. The Father and Son duo have even been involved in the same production, like when they both starred in the award-winning series \"Schitts Creek.\" The series spanned over six seasons from 2015 to 2020.\n\nMost people who see Daniel's character, David, in the series adore the pansexual performance he gives, but apparently, he is not pansexual like his fans would have liked. Daniel came out as a gay man at 18 years old. His parents were incredibly supportive of this move, and thanks to that, he was able to flourish in Hollywood the way that he did.\n\nAdele\n\nThe British pop sensation Adele shares her child Angelo with her ex-husband Simon Konecki. The pair are also not trying to impose any gender stereotypes on their child, who was born in 2012. Adele and Konecki made a decision together to raise their child in a gender-neutral method.\n\nThe singer was spotted at Disneyland a few years ago, in 2016, with her accompanying son wearing a blue and yellow 'Elsa' dress and ballet flats for the occasion. Adele has also openly admitted that she won't be upset if her son does decide to become a woman one day. Go, Mom Adele!\n\nMatt Salmon\n\nIn 2013, the then-Republican Matt Salmon opened up about his gay son in an interview with \"Phoenix TV.\" Salmon said the following about his son: \"By far, one of the most important people in my life. I love him more than I can say.\" Salmon served as a US representative from 1995 to 2001 in Arizona.\n\nHis son Matthew Salmon finished up his psychiatry residency in 2015 and has since become a highly vocal activist for gay rights. Now, Dr. Matthew Salmon is a member at Whitman-Walker Health in Washington, DC, where he practices as an adolescent psychiatrist. He is also the author of \"Pride & Prejudice: Healing Division in the Modern Family.\"\n\nNaomi Watts & Liev Schreiber\n\nNaomi Watts and Liev Schreiber may not be posing as a married couple anymore, but the pair do still share two children together, Sasha and Kai, whom they still raise together as dedicated parents. This was evident recently when they celebrated their trans child Kai's middle school graduation.\n\nBoth parents and kids glowed in a family pic posted by Watts. Schreiber also posted a sweet snap of Mother and Child with a bouquet of flowers for the special occasion. Watts and Schreiber were together for 11 years but called it quits in 2016. They have been nothing but dedicated to raising their children together despite the split.\n\nAlice Walker\n\nAlice Malsenoir Tallulah-Kate Walker is an American author, poet, and activist known for her writing on topics covering mostly race and gender. She has always identified as bisexual and was raised in rural Georgia, where she overcame a lot of challenges, such as injuries and segregation. In 1982, she became the first African-American woman to be awarded the Pulitzer Fiction Prize for her work on the novel \"The Color Purple.\"\n\nHer only child, Rebecca Walker, followed in her mother's footsteps as a novelist and activist. Rebecca has also been open about her bisexuality, especially when she dated the German-American singer-songwriter Meshell Ndegeocello. Like mother like daughter, in this sweet family-life story.\n\nSigourney Weaver\n\nIn 2022, actress Sigourney Weaver announced that her only offspring, Charlotte, identifies as nonbinary. She spoke frankly about her family life in an interview on the \"Smartless\" podcast with hosts Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, and Will Arnett. Weaver and her husband, Jim Simpson, have been going strong since October 1984, and the pair welcomed their daughter Charlotte in 1990.\n\nThey now allegedly refer to Charlotte as Char since they came out as nonbinary. While Char may not have followed in her parent's Hollywood footsteps, they did make their debut on-screen appearance in the Oscar-winning \"The Guys,\" which was directed by none other than their father.\n\nMarie Newman\n\nMarie Newman is an American politician who served Illinois's third congressional district from 2021 to 2023. In 2021, Newman put up a pride flag outside of her Capitol office. She gave a speech in which she was choking on tears in the same year, stating that the Equality Act would offer protections for transgender people, which includes her beloved daughter Evie Newman.\n\nEvie came out as transgender in 2019 and shortly after began to transition. When Newman first found out about her child coming out, she took a few months off from her occupation, which was a marketing firm at the time, to do some research about how to best support her child's massive life change. Talk about good parenting!\n\nJackie Chan\n\nJackie Chan is a Hong Kong-born martial artist turned actor who has been making waves in martial art-themed flicks for a long time now. As such, he has appeared in more than 150 movies.\n\nIn 2017, his daughter Etta Ng, with former Hong Kong beauty queen Elaine Ng, took to Instagram to share with the whole world that she is gay as she was posing in front of a rainbow-colored flag backdrop. While promoting the movie \"The Foreigner,\" Chan was asked about his daughter coming out of the closet. The star simply said that if she likes it, then that's fine with him.\n\nJennifer Wexton\n\nJennifer Wexton is a congresswoman who's been serving the North Virginian people for almost two decades now. She serves as a prosecutor and advocate for abused children. She is a Washington native and earned a law degree in 1995 from the University of Maryland in College Park. In 2021, the Republican vehemently responded to Majorie Taylor Greene's remarks about transgender people.\n\n\"I want the LGBTQ community, especially our transgender family, friends, and neighbors, to know that these attacks do not represent the United States Congress,\" she wrote. In 2019, the Virginian politician started to hang the transgender pride flag outside her state office to proudly show support for her niece, who is transgender. That’ll show ‘em!\n\nAlexis Bellino\n\nAlexis Bellino was a member of the cast on \"The Real Housewives of Orange County\" from seasons five to eight. In October 2022, the star made a special post on Instagram in which she introduced her transgender kid when they allegedly asked their mom to give the world their message on their behalf.\n\nBellino started with, \"Hey, world, this is Miles. My transgender son. He's now a month shy of 15 years old, so he's seen the questions and comments made about him on my IG. Miles now has a voice and has asked me to do this post...\" Bellino added that Miles was happier than ever since coming out. Too sweet!\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nOur girl Jennifer Lopez shares twins Emme and Max with her ex-husband Marc Anthony. In a recent performance at the Dodgers Stadium, J.Lo headlined the annual Blue Diamond Gala affair. The Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation hosted the event, and it was a time that J.Lo brought her child Emme, who was 14 years old at the time, on stage.\n\nIt was a surprise appearance, and the star introduced her child with the gender-neutral pronouns \"they/them.\" This was not the first time that J.Lo graced her audience with Emme's presence, and also not the first time that Emme got to perform next to their brilliant mom. The two also duetted the song \"Limitless\" together in 2019.\n\nColin Mochrie\n\nColin Mochrie is a comedian, writer, and actor that many of you know thanks to the iconic series \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" or “The Drew Carey Show.” The star shared with the internet that he is the proud father of a trans daughter named Kinley and that both his mother and his mother-in-law love and accept her just the way they are.\n\nAt first, when the news from his daughter broke in 2016, the star claimed that he was afraid of the change, but eventually, he opened his mind to his child’s new stance on life. He sent a message to young people who don't accept trans people, that if boomers can do it, anyone could.\n\nThe Arquette Family\n\nUnless you have been living under a rock for the past few decades, you know who the Arquette family is. Head of the family is Lewis Arquette, who portrayed J.D. Pickett on \"The Waltons.\" He and his wife had three famous children — Patricia, David, and Alexis. They have all been featured in film and television.\n\nIn 2007, Alexis came out as a trans woman. Her family has always been progressive and open-minded, which means they accepted her for who she was even before they knew what it meant. Sadly, she died in 2016 due to a battle with HIV.\n\nSen. Rob Portman\n\nThis is the type of story that sounds as if it was taken from a movie, but it's real life. Portman was a Republican politician who served as a US senator from Ohio from the years 2011 to 2023. He also refused to support the Equality Act. In a fascinating twist, his son Will came out of the closet in 2011.\n\nThis has made Rob reconsider his stance and thankfully made him change his tune when it comes to supporting marriage equality. He now believes that any two people who are in love deserve the chance to get married and live happily ever after.\n\nAnne Rice\n\nIf Anne Rice's name sounds familiar to you, it means you were into vampires way before it was popularized with \"Twilight.\" Rice is the author of \"Interview With the Vampire,\" a classic novel that has also been turned into a movie starring Brad Pitt. She also authored the bestselling gothic series called \"Vampire Chronicles.\"\n\nHer son, author Christopher Rice, who came out as gay, always had his mom's support. She has been vocal about her support for the community on Facebook. Sadly Anne passed away in 2021, but today her legacy in literature and Hollywood lives on today, along with the mark that she left on the LGBTQ community.\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nJason Gould is an actor and a singer in his own right, but let's face it, you probably know him as the son of Barbra Streisand and Elliott Gould. Jason was born in 1966 but he knew he was gay from a very young age, but he was outed before he had the chance to come out.\n\nIn 1991 at the age of 21, the tabloids busted him and spilled the beans that he was indeed gay. Mother Barbra decided to familiarize herself with LGBTQ+ topics, and after doing so, she became an avid advocate and supporter of the community.\n\nPaul Haggis\n\nPaul Haggis wasn't the face of movies like \"Million Dollar Baby,\" \"Crash,\" and \"The Third Person\" but he was the brain behind them. The Canadian screenwriter has been involved in some of the best movies of the past two decades. He has two lesbian daughters which he fully supports.\n\nHe even left his church, the Church of Scientology, because he felt he could no longer be a part of an organization that didn't stand for his daughter's rights. He explained further in an interview with “The New Yorker,” that his daughter Katy who is part of the LGBTQ community, had apparently faced some discrimination issues from other members of the church.\n\nWill and Jada Smith\n\nAs one of Hollywood's long-lasting couples, the two have more than a few scandals tied to their names. Still, they are known to be open-minded people who support each other no matter what. In 2020, daughter Willow confessed to being both bisexual and polyamorous on an episode of “Table Talk.”\n\nThis series focuses on all generations of the family as they talk about taboo topics such as infidelity, adult content, and, most recently out-of-the-ordinary relationships. Ideally, Willow would like to date one man and one woman at the same time. After revealing this information to her mother and grandmother on their talk show, the two encouraged her to keep on doing what makes her feel happy and whole.\n\nCindy Barshop\n\nThese days, our reality television actors are celebrities. Sometimes their antics are too much, and other times they’re a welcome reprieve from day-to-day routine. On our list of LGBTQ+ supportive parents, \"Real Housewives of New York\" star, Cindy Barshop, spoke with People, saying that \"nothing's really changed.\" Her son, Jesse, 11 years old at the time of the interview, is transgender.\n\nThe decision to open up was in response to Mario Lopez's remarks that children should be of an appropriate age to decide their identity. Later Lopez apologized for his alleged insensitive and ignorant comments in a statement to People after receiving a lot of backlash from Barshop and others. Go, mommy Barshop!\n\nVanessa Carlton\n\nAnnouncing that she is a \"proud bisexual woman,\" is Vanessa Carlton. She came out a few years ago, though it's something that isn't commonly known! The singer of the hit single \"Thousand Miles\" saw the song reach the top five on the Billboard Hot 100, and it spent a whopping 41 weeks on this chart.\n\nShe has always been happy with regard to her sexual orientation, though it hasn't been the source of much media attention. The star came out while touring in 2010 at the Nashville Pride. She announced that she’s a proud bisexual woman, which was probably cheered on by the crowds.\n\nCher\n\nBorn Chastity Bono, Chaz has had a bit of a difficult journey to get to where he is today. Between the years 2008 and 2010, Chaz underwent a gender transition, transitioning from female to male. This was all very challenging since Chaz was already in his 40s by this stage, but it’s clearly never too late to go through transitioning!\n\nEven if you really think you’re strong enough. After the change, he legally changed his gender and name and was out in society as an openly transgender man. His mother, Cher, who is, of course, an LGBTQ+ icon, was nothing but supportive of her son!\n\nMarcia Gay Harden\n\nWith a personal reason for championing gay rights, Marcia Gay Harden certainly is a supporter of the LGBTQ+ community. Her teenage son, Hudson, who identifies as gay, certainly has a very supportive mother! Hudson was born in 2004 and has been publicly out and open since around the year 2018.\n\nIt came out when his mom revealed why she was fighting at the Family Equality Council’s Impact Awards for the LGBTQ community. She is pushing for this community to ensure her son's future is as equal and fair as hers was — so that one day he can have a family on his own terms.\n\nSia\n\nSia is such an icon! With her blunt blonde wig and amazing chops, we love this lady from down under, so get ready to add one more thing to love! The pop star adopted two teenagers in 2019 who were getting too old for the foster system.\n\nOne of her adopted sons, Che, recently came out as gay, and Sia has given him nothing but her full love and support. She commented that since coming out Che has just been blossoming as his true self. She went on to state that he is the light in her life and that she loves him so much. Too sweet!\n\nJamie Lee Curtis\n\nFirst, can we just say, how cool would it be to have Jamie Lee Curtis as your mom? Anyway, Curtis' daughter, Ruby, came out as transgender and went on to start her transition. The star of the \"Halloween\" franchise did admit to news outlets that it was challenging to learn \"new terminology\" but says that she's become more thoughtful and in turn, more supportive!\n\nThe entertainer has mostly kept her child out of the spotlight but has also shared that the whole transitioning of her child has opened up a whole new narrative in her life. She went on to state her goal is to shed light on trans topics and help others who may be in the same situation.\n\nCharlie Carver\n\nThe American actor who climbed the fame ladder with his role on the ABC show \"Desperate Housewives\" had a tough journey coming out to his parents. He later opened up about the whole experience when he accepted the Gamechanger Award from the charity GLSEN which spreads love and light about LGBTQ matters.\n\nHe claimed that a big part of why he came out in 2016 was so that he could perhaps assist other youngsters who feel shame in their relationships. Carver, as a young man, found it difficult coming out to his mother because his parents' own marriage ended for well…the same reason. However, instead of being angry, Carver's mom was more supportive and loving than ever! Naw!\n\nJohnny Depp & Vanessa Paradis\n\nSo we all know Lily-Rose Depp as an ambassador for French luxury brand Chanel, and of course, as the child of Johnny Depp and French actress Vanessa Paradis. The young fashionista and starlet came out as bisexual at the young age of 16, and, of course, her parents support her!\n\nRecently the star made waves on social media when she posted a pic with her crush 070 Shake, who is a rapper and songwriter. We love that there's plenty of love in this family and that someone who's chosen as an ambassador for such an iconic global brand is out and proud!\n\nKate McKinnon\n\nLook, we're not here JUST to celebrate parents of gay celebrities - we're here to celebrate the wonderful people who identify as part of the LGBTQ community, and that includes the wonderful comedy sketch star Kate McKinnon. McKinnon is a comedian, impressionist, actress, and writer.\n\nShe got her claim to fame at the age of 28 when she was cast on the NBC comedy series “Saturday Night Live.” This is where she really got to work on her comedic persona and celeb impressions. McKinnon has always been openly out, but it was just never something that came under much speculation or media attention.\n\nRory Feek\n\nThe younger of Rory's daughters from his first marriage is Hopie Feek! The country music singer-songwriter's daughter came out after some harrowing circumstances — her mother's funeral. She came out as a lesbian just days after they were mourning the loss of their mother.\n\nHopie was worried that her dad might reject her notions of coming at first and that he would stop loving her altogether. At first, it was tough for Rory, due to his religious beliefs, but over time he became more supportive of his daughter. Rory noted that the situation of his daughter coming out has taught him how to love unconditionally. Too sweet!\n\nSean Burke & Braunwyn Windham\n\nBraunwyn Windham-Burke is definitely loving the fact that her son, Jacob, is into drag! It's been a source of fun and entertainment for her and her family during quarantine, which is pretty cute! The teenager, who is one of seven siblings, has certainly paved his own way and molded his own identity for himself.\n\nHe loves drag (Jacob even has a drag persona, 'Divine Devon'), has been putting on quite a show for his family, and it's even featured on the Bravo reality show. In one of the episodes, Jacob transformed into his persona for drag with a stunning blue gown and a long, lush blonde wig. Love it!\n\nBelinda Carlisle\n\nFamed singer, Belinda Carlisle (yes, you can start singing \"Heaven Is A Place on Earth\") is one super supportive parent! Her son, James Duke Mason came out when he was fourteen years old. Carlisle admitted she kept the secret for a few months, before having more discussions about it.\n\nShe's even done a few talks for an organization that supports parents of children who identify as gay! She has even gone on to say that she would have never had it any other way and that she wouldn’t even have known what to do with a straight child. Love the honesty!\n\nIsiah Thomas\n\nZeke, who you may know as the son of basketball Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas, who has also been the official DJ for the NBA All-Star Game, has been on quite a journey with his coming out. The DJ has also been quite vocal and proud to express his feelings about Gay Pride, stating that it is a time of celebration, joy, and remembrance.\n\nHe further stated that it’s a time to be grateful for how far things have come. In an interview, Zeke also remarked that the NBA was pretty gay-inclusive. He is lucky to have the support of not only his father but also that of the NBA!\n\nWarren Beatty & Annette Bening\n\nStephan Beatty, the son of two Hollywood hard hitters, Warren Beatty and Annette Bening was assigned female at birth and initially named Kathlyn Beatty. Later on in their life, they came out as transgender. When he was just a teenager he began his difficult transition, in a full house (with his three other siblings).\n\nHis parents were nothing but supportive, with Beatty coming out and saying \"He's managed something that's very challenging with great style and great intelligence, he's a revolutionary, a genius…and my hero. He's an articulate, thoughtful person, and I'm very, very proud of him.\" Love!\n\nHalsey\n\nYou may have read that Halsey, otherwise known as Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, had her own kid and is now raising that child. But did you know that she's also bisexual? The singer gained a lot of attention from releasing her own work on social media platforms.\n\nShe got her stage name from a man she was romantically involved with at 17, who lived near Halsey Street in Brooklyn. She has always pushed the envelope, is very proud of her queer identity and has always made herself endearing to her fans. We love Halsey, and we're sure that no matter what sexuality or identity her son identifies with, Halsey will be behind him 100 percent!\n\nSharon & Ozzy Osbourne\n\nThe Osbourne family is probably one of the more famous ex-pat families in the States, with patriarch Ozzy being the frontman of the famous metal group Black Sabbath. Did you know that Kelly, his daughter (who always, always has great hair), is \"open to loving anybody\"?\n\nHer parents, of course, have her back 100% whether she is gender fluid or not. She did, however, recently give birth to her first son. Kelly and her boyfriend Sid Wilson welcomed their first baby into the world towards the end of 2022. The news came after her mom Sharon Osbourne spilled the beans on live TV.\n\nSally Field\n\nSally Feild's son from her second marriage is Samuel Greisman, who came out as gay at nineteen. Field has always been extremely supportive of all three of her boys and has continued to provide unconditional love and anything that her sons need. It was even rumored that her son’s coming out experience inspired some of the series “Brothers and Sisters” storyline.\n\nWe love that she even tried to set him up on a few dates. Talk about having Mom in your corner! We’re not sure Greisman took too kindly to it, but after all, if your mom is Sally Field, you’re bound to find some connections.\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong\n\nThis list celebrates all those kids who at some point, came out as LGBTQ +, and Billie Joe Armstrong is one of those people! In 1995 in an interview with The Advocate, when the lead singer of Green Day was in his twenties he revealed to the media that \"I've always been bisexual. I mean, it’s something that I've always been interested in.\"\n\nLater on, though, the star said that he doesn’t want to categorize himself as anything. He's in a different place right now, but it's healthy to explore different types of relationships and explore more about yourself and what you like.\n\nKim Basinger & Alec Baldwin\n\nIreland Basinger Baldwin, the daughter of Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin, was born in October 1995. She started acting and modeling in 2013 and got her first Hollywood on-screen appearance in 2013 in the movie “Grudge Match.” Ireland has also been a vocal advocate for animal rights like when she posed for the animal organization PETA.\n\nShe was previously in a queer relationship with rapper Angel Haze. While the gorgeous girl has dated women in the past, since the break up with Haze, Baldwin has almost exclusively dated men. You do you, Ireland! While her parents are not always supportive of her risqué photos, they are, of course, accepting of their daughter and her partners.\n\nMarie Osmond\n\nWhile Marie Osmond puts everything into her overly successful career, it should also be noted that the star always puts her number one priority first: her family. The legendary star is not only an entertainer but she is also a proud mother of eight children.\n\nJessica Osmond, one of the daughters of the famed singer Marie Osmond, is lucky enough to not only have a mother who has the means, but also one who has a big heart! After announcing her nuptials to wife Sara, Osmond posted on social media \"I could not love the two of you more! Welcome to our family!\" Nothing but love for her gals.\n\nCybill Shepherd\n\nClementine Shepherd Ford is an actress most well known for her portrayal of Molly Kroll on the series “The L Word.” The series befittingly followed the lives of a group of bisexual and lesbian women in California. She is also the daughter of actress Cybill Shepherd and David Ford. She came out quite a few years ago as being gay.\n\nThe way she dealt with her sexuality is quite refreshing — no questioning, no smoke, and mirrors, just the plain ol’ truth. We are here for it! Her mother, Cybill, was so supportive that she received an award for her outspokenness in regard to LGBTQ rights, at the GLAAD Media Awards.\n\nBilly Ray and Tish Cyrus\n\nMiley Cyrus, the daughter of Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus, has always been very gender fluid (a far cry from her \"Hannah Montana\" days), despite having been in a long-term relationship with Aussie hunk, Liam Hemsworth. Following their break up Miley started dating another man, the musician Maxx Morando.\n\nThe pair were first romantically spotted in November 2021. This is after a back-to-back relationship with Cody Simpson and Kaitlynn Carter. Definitely a good way to show that you swing both ways! After her divorce from Hemsworth, Cyrus perhaps embraced her sexuality a little more, pursuing relationships with women as well as men.\n\nMarlon Wayans\n\nAmai, who is the only daughter Marlon Wayans shares with his ex-wife Angelica, came out as openly gay. The young woman, who had a big announcement for her folks, was met with nothing but love and support from her parents. Marlon proudly celebrated his daughter during pride month for her confidence to be herself!\n\nThe comedian and actor posted a pic on Instagram of his teenager who was kicking it in a pair of pride-themed shoes with a rainbow for soles. In his “Happy Pride” message, he wrote that he wouldn’t change a thing - and that he loves them through all the galaxies and back. Naw!\n\nLady Gaga\n\nSo yes, you may remember Lady Gaga, also known as “Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta,” being engaged once or twice (no one can really forget that yellow diamond engagement ring, right?) to a man, however, there's no doubt that Gaga is a champion for LGBTQ+ rights and its community. She once, in an interview, even stated that all she wants to do is inject a bit of gay culture into the ordinary.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what she’s been doing through her music and this is probably why she is so loved! She's a lady with a lot of love to give, and all it takes is one listen to \"Born This Way\" to know where the pop queen stands!\n\nElliot Page\n\nIn the early 2020s, the world was taken by the headline that the actress of \"Juno,\" Ellen Page, changed their name to Elliott and was now an openly transgender person. Prior to that, the star came out as gay in 2014 at a conference in Las Vegas for Human Rights. In this speech that lasted for about 10 minutes, that star was given two standing ovations for their bravery at the time.\n\nAfter surgery and a transition that shocked the world in later years, Page is now comfortably himself. His parents, who are there for him during this challenging time, are joined by Page’s wife, Emma Portner. Nothing but love all around here!\n\nCharlize Theron\n\nThis Hollywood A-lister came out with some news in 2019 that was a bit controversial to start with — that her eldest daughter at the time, who was only seven at the time, is transgender. In an interview, the star shared, “My daughter’s story is really her story, and one day, if she chooses, she’ll tell her story.”\n\nMale at birth, her daughter Jackson revealed that she was in fact, a girl at the age of four. Charlize Theron, who is a known supporter of LGBTQ rights and is an activist of sorts for the cause, has nothing but love and support for her baby.\n\nKristian Nairn\n\nThe Irish actor and DJ, who hails from Northern Ireland, got his time to shine as Hodor in the iconic HBO series, \"Game of Thrones.\" This was his first acting accolade and seems to have catapulted him into the puts of fame. More recently, he has portrayed Wee John Feeney on the HBO show “Our Flag Means Death.”\n\nHe may have become a bit of a meme but he ain’t complaining about the fame! He is also openly gay and has never hidden his sexuality from anyone, which we think is awesome. People, be more unapologetically you! Hodor says so!\n\nTammy Rivera & Waka Flocka Flame\n\nTammy Rivera is an American TV personality, fashion designer, singer, and businesswoman. She also used to be on the cast of the VH1 reality series “Love$ Hip Hop: Atlanta.” Charlie is Tammy's daughter from a previous different relationship with Brian Williams.\n\nWhile Waka Flocka Flame is not Charlie's biological father, he has been in Charlie's life since she was just a tot — four years old to be exact! Their daughter came out as gay as a teen, and even took a girl as a date to celebrate her Quinceañera! At that point, both parents were very supportive of their little daughter!\n\nCynthia Bailey & Leon Robinson\n\nThe “Real Housewives of Atlanta” stars Cynthia Baily and Leon Robinson may have split up when their daughter Noelle Robinson was very young, but the pair have been able to maintain a civil relationship over time as they navigate co-parenting. Coming out as \"sexually fluid,\" Noelle knows who she is!\n\nInitially, though, Noelle struggled and wasn't sure how her parents, Cynthia Bailey and Leon Robinson, would take the news of her coming out. Once she told them and gave it some time, the pair came to terms with it and what it meant for their kid. At the end of the day, they just want the best for their child.\n\nMia Farrow\n\nRonan Farrow, son of Hollywood icon Mia Farrow, was Born in New York and is now a well-known investigative reporter and journalist. He is well known for his investigative reports on the sexual abuse allegations against the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nHe published this controversial work in “The New Yorker” magazine, which won a prize in the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service with the New York Times, for this work that he reported. Farrow came out as part of the LGBT community a few years ago, before getting engaged to Jon Lovett! Mia Farrow has always been supportive, and continues to support her son!\n\nHeather Dubrow & Terry Dubrow\n\nYou would know Terry Dubrow as one-half of the plastic surgeon team that runs the show \"Botched.\" Yes, it's reality TV and it's incredibly binge-worthy! Anyway, we're here to talk about their children.\n\nMax the oldest daughter came out as bisexual in 2020, and shortly after, her sister Kat followed in her footsteps and came out as gay in 2022 at the age of 15. Heather stated that her four kids, who all have different genders, and sexualities are all at interesting places in their lives, as they try to figure out who they are. The family has done a stellar job of navigating the topic and giving Max and Kat the confidence to be themselves.\n\nAlly Sheedy\n\nOne of the stars of the 80s classic, \"The Breakfast Club\" is Ally Sheedy. But did you know that her son, Beckett, is transgender? Born to David Lansbury and Sheedy, Beckett came out as part of the LGBTQ community. His family was one hundred percent supportive of his choice and decision to make a change.\n\nTo support her son, Sheedy did the best thing — researched and researched! Sheedy also stated that she learned a lot from her son’s journey and that she gave him all the room to glow and blossom into who he really wanted to be. By learning about her son, she was better able to support and love him!\n\nCynthia Nixon\n\nBefore coming out herself, Cynthia Nixon (you’d remember her as Miranda from “Sex and the City”), was in a relationship with Danny Mozes, a school teacher. From that relationship, the pair had two kids, whom they now co-parent.\n\nA few years ago in 2018, Nixon revealed that her son Samuel- or Seph as they like to be called, the eldest child, is transgender. In an Instagram post, just two days before the Gay Pride Parade, Nixon congratulated her baby on coming out and feeling comfortable enough to share his identity with the world. She also congratulated them on graduating from the University of Chicago. Awww!\n\nSade\n\nLegendary singer and beatmaker, Sade, is also one very proud and supportive parent. Her son, Izaak Theo Adu, who was born Mickailia, came out transgender in 2016. Since then they underwent a difficult process of transitioning, telling the media that he had a 'painful' sex-change journey.\n\nThey were very open and public as they went through the whole process, documenting the process in a personal essay. This was all despite the fact that his famous mom was a very private and secretive person. Sade's son opened up about how emotionally challenging it was and also paid homage to his parents. Big love!\n\nVanna White\n\nActress and former \"Wheel of Fortune\" presenter, Vanna White, probably didn't realize that her son was going to turn as many heads as she did back in the day! It was previously reported that her son, Nicholas, who prefers to be called \"Nikko,\" had a special relationship with a Hare Krishna monk named Jaycee Akinsanya, whom he had been living with while attending the University of Arizona.\n\nAllegedly the star’s son was just exploring a gay relationship but it was later revealed that it was just a fling. While he didn't confirm his orientation, he did say \"gay? It's possible,\" when questioned about it.\n\nBusy Philipps & Marc Silverstein\n\nBusy Philipps, who is a bit of an American TV series icon, is no stranger to being there for her children!

Philipps has noted that supporting her daughter has helped her grow herself and that being a mother to her queer daughter has taught her so much. Now that's a tear-jerker!\n\nGloria Estefan\n\nFirst going public a few years ago with her same-sex relationship, Emily Estefan has always been proud of her identity. While her mother, singer Gloria Estefan, has always been a staunch supporter of the LGBTQ community, there were some emotions to be worked through when it came to her daughter.\n\nEmily initially had some backlash from other family members which made it tough. According to Gloria, there are certain taboo topics in the Latin culture and apparently being gay was one of them at the time. Luckily, in the end, the family made it through and are fully supportive of her.\n\nDean McDermott & Mary Jo Eustace\n\nAn article that made headlines a couple of years ago was one about Dean McDermott's son, Jack. McDermott opened up to the world about his son on the podcast “Daddy Issues.” The actor had his son at 20 with his wife Mary Jo Eustace at the time. His eldest son apparently didn't tell his dad about his boyfriends, with McDermott remarking \"he's so quiet!\"\n\nThough he expressed full support for his son, he also admitted that things may have been easier on the family if his son was straight. Jack, who came out when he was 17, is described by his father as \"this beautiful, 6-foot-4, beautiful Adonis.\" Wow, that's a lot of love!\n\nBella Thorne\n\nBella Thorne got her claim to fame at the young age of 13 when she starred as Cece Jones in Disney’s “Shake It Up.” It really is no secret that the star doesn't really define a line when it comes to sexuality and fluidity, and we totally love that for her.\n\nMaybe it goes against the code for the Disney Channel, but Thorne is unapologetic about being pansexual. She described her sexuality as falling for someone because of their personality despite what their body looks like. She went on to say that you like beings for who they are, not what they are. Her parents, who supported her career all her life, fully back their daughter.\n\nKhary Payton\n\nYou may remember Khary Payton from the hit series, \"The Walking Dead.\" Some may also know him from his role in the soap opera “General Hospital,” but did you know the star has a transgender son? In 2020 the actor announced on social media that his son Karter was born female, but has \"always identified as a boy.\"\n\nKhary has also stated that there’s nothing better than watching your child feel the joy of discovering what it means to be one’s true self. We love the support Khary has for his son, Karter, and hope that Karter continues to grow with so much love from his dad, as a boy and later on as a man!\n\nGloria Vanderbilt\n\nRenowned CNN broadcaster Anderson Cooper may be a familiar face to many — and a household name to even more — but it seems that regardless of his career, he was destined for a life of luxury. That's because he was born into a dynasty family, Vanderbilt.\n\nAnderson came out of the closet to his mother while he was still a college student. He noted that he was raised in a house that welcomed gay people, as his mother had a lot of gay friends. Cooper, whose mother passed at the age of 95, also notes that his mother Gloria was in fact, a very supportive mom.\n\nRobert Stafford\n\nLil Nas X has to be one of the hottest rappers of the moment. Now an undisputed queer icon, the young musician burst onto the scene with pride anthems like \"Call Me By Your Name\" and \"Industry Baby,\" which were accompanied by openly-gay music videos.\n\nAfter coming out as a gay male, his father, Robert Stafford, has been praised as a \"supportive\" parent after defending and protecting his son. At first, though, it was tough for Lil Nas X to come out to his dad due to the family’s religious background, but apparently, his dad accepted it instantly. Nice job, dad!\n\nTim Cook\n\nOkay so, Cook may not have any LGBTQ-identifying children, but the CEO of Apple has an important story and message that we wanted to share. He was the first CEO of a major company to come out and says that he has no regrets whatsoever.\n\nIn 2014 Cook made waves in the world of business when he was the first chief executive of a Fortune 500 company to openly come out as gay. As the chair of a major corporation, and being openly proud, he's sending a message to adults and young adults everywhere that it's okay to be you! Love!\n\nAngelina Jolie & Brad Pitt\n\nSo there has been no confirmation that Shiloh Jolie Pitt, the daughter of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, identifies as LGBTQ, however, she has been swept up by the community and is held up as something of an icon!\n\nIt started back in 2010, when Jolie, in an interview shared what it was like to raise Shiloh, who \"wanted to be a boy.\" There are many pics of Shiloh online, some in which she dresses more like a boy and recent ones where she resembles her mother's stunning look. We can't wait to see the exciting life that lies ahead for Shiloh!\n\nVictor Garber\n\nIt’s been quite a journey for Victor Garber, and while we’re not sure his parents supported him being out, we’re sure that he’s proud and happy to finally be himself in the open!\n\nGarber came out relatively late in the game, as he was in his 60s, but has had a long-time partner for about two decades. Garber started dating Rainer Andreesen in 1999, and the two finally tied the knot 16 years later in 2015. The couple has been going strong ever since. We're just glad that he's now comfortable being himself, with the one he loves the most!\n\nMary Cheney\n\nThe youngest daughter of former US Vice President, Dick Cheney, is happily out and proud, married to her partner, Heather Poe. Cheney, who is, of course, a more conservative Republican, has been asked his opinion on gay marriage but says that the issue is up to the \"states\" to make a final decision.\n\nSadly Mary’s sister was not very supportive of her choices in women at first but at least her dad came through for her. Her mother was also weary at first, considering all the homophobia in the world at the time. Ultimately though, Dick Cheney came through for his daughter, and openly supported same-sex marriage, despite being a Republican!\n\nCookie Johnson & Magic Johnson\n\nEJ is the child of legendary basketball player Magic Johnson and \"Cookie.\" He was outed by TMZ as a gay male in 2013, which wasn't the best start at the time, but he quickly landed a reality TV show shortly after this stunt.\n\nThe new role model continues to break boundaries as a gay person and is particularly fond of the beauty world (just look at that glowing skin!). He is also an extremely fabulous dresser and is a fan of anything diamond-encrusted. Magic has voiced his appreciation for his son’s work within the LGBTQ community several times in interviews.\n\nSting\n\nEliot Sumner, who's none other than the daughter of legendary singer, Sting, opened up about her sexual orientation many years ago. She stated that she didn't identify with any gender, and found the whole concept of gender to be really fluid for herself.\n\nAt the time she'd been dating a woman, but identified first as a \"musician.\" Apparently, she never really formally came out to her friends and family about her sexual orientation because… \"no one asked.\" Ouch! That hurts. Let's hope nowadays her parents are there for her and providing their support for however she chooses to express her identity!"
