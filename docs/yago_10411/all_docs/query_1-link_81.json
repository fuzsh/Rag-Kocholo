        "text": "Aug 3, 2019 | 3:09 PM\n\nSpinal Cord Injury Alberta is gearing up for a fundraising night full of laughs in Red Deer with two of Canada’s longest-tenured actor-comedians.\n\nColin Mochrie and Debra McGrath, who are married, will perform August 8 at the Cambridge Red Deer Hotel and Conference Centre. There may even be some interactive Whose Line Is It Anyway.\n\nDoug Manderville, Regional Program Coordinator with SCI Alberta, was paralyzed from the chest down after an accident in 1994.\n\nOne of the most important things to note about spinal cord injuries, he says, is that they can happen in an instant.\n\n“One second, I was an able-bodied 21-year-old young man on top of the world, and a second later I’m a quadriplegic,” he says.\n\n“I thought what does life have in store for me now? Twenty-five years later, I love being out in the community, meeting people, and I love being an advocate for not just people with disabilities, but for all. I realized early on the difference between having a disability and being disabled.”\n\nTickets for the show are $50 and there is room for 800 people at the venue. Mochrie and McGrath will be on stage performing for close to 90 minutes\n\nTickets are available on TwoSpoons.tickit.ca."
