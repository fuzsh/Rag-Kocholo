Colin’s also done Shakespearean tragedy, and played a serial killer on Murdoch Mysteries. He’s joined by his life partner Debra McGrath, an award-winning writer, producer and comedian, who co-starred with Colin in the CBC series Getting Along Famously. And as you’ll see, they do get along famously as we talk about being \"OK Boomered\", making Mulroney: the Opera , master plasterers, life’s twists and turns, laughing through tough times, helping their trans daughter choose a new name, free speech vs. hate speech, punching below your weight, hope in the younger generations, change in older generations, an improv game, and a game show.\n\n#BuildBridgesNotWalls\n\nBoomTheShow.com\n\nRickMiller.ca\n\n@rickmilleractor\n\n@xingthegap\n\n@colinmochrie\n\ncolinmochrie.com\n\nAs a bonus to season 1 of Xing The Gap, we're releasing video versions of your favourite episodes.

Stephanie and Karen are renowned Albertan actors and improvisers. Steph’s a founding member of the Canadian Comedy Award Winning Live Improvised Soap Opera, Die-Nasty. Karen’s the co-founder of Dirty Laundry, another awesome Albertan improv company. Griffin is Karen’s son, and a fine actor and producer in his own right. As a quad, they cover the art/chaos of podcasting, assuming things about others and being wrong, how teenagers will save the world, how facebook and TikTok split generations, finding meaning in bullshit jobs, how GenX invented the internet, from “Yes But” to “Yes And”, seeing change as opportunity, and why learning people’s pronouns is - to quote Griffin - “less effort than helping them move\".\n\n#BuildBridgesNotWalls\n\nXingTheGap.com\n\nBoomTheShow.com\n\nRickMiller.ca\n\n@rickmilleractor\n\n@xingthegap\n\nBridging The Gap podcast\n\n@dienastyimprov\n\n@fraud.broads ( Scamtime )\n\n@dirtylaundryyyc\n\n@karenjohnsondiamond\n\n@stephwolfe101\n\n@GriffinCork\n\nAs a bonus to season 1 of Xing The Gap, we're releasing video versions of your favourite episodes.

Enjoy!\n\nIn this XTG episode, Rick interviews Steve Anthony and Malaika Astorga. For Canadian GenXers, Steve Anthony is a household name, as one of the early stars of MuchMusic. Steve then cut his locks, and spent the next decade hosting CP24 Breakfast, helping it become the #1 Morning TV show in Canada. He’s joined by Malaika Astorga, a Latinx B. Comm graduate from Concordia, and co-founder of Also Cool — an online arts and music platform, plus podcast. She’s also a strategist for an L.A based media company, and a social media consultant for a ton of artists. As 3 generations, they riff on Mexican-Canadians in Quebec, VJs at the dawn of the internet, the Montreal-Toronto gap, how music tethers generations, how Algorithms create niches, how social media changes businesses, dealing with declining relevance, taking TikTok seriously, and trying to stump a pop culture icon in a game show.\n\n#BuildBridgesNotWalls\n\nXingTheGap.com\n\nBoomTheShow.com\n\nRickMiller.ca\n\n@rickmilleractor\n\n@xingthegap\n\n@steveanthonyonline\n\nsteveanthony.com\n\n@_flleur @flloral_art\n\n@alsocoolmag\n\nmalaikaastorga.com\n\nAs a bonus to season 1 of Xing The Gap, we're releasing video versions of your favourite episodes.

Bruce Kuwabara is a founding partner of KPMB Architects, Chair of the Canadian Centre for Architecture, and an Officer of the Order of Canada. He’s joined by Roxane Bejjany, an up-and-coming KPMB architect, who brings a Millennial perspective on work, life, and everything in between. Through the lens of architecture (which is what Rick studied in school) they talk about plurality in Canada, the concept of openness, the meaning of buildings, how hard it is to make great architecture, office towers that breathe, designing for mental health, mentoring from boomers, learning from GenZ, and thinking long-term. All that, and the usual game show silliness.\n\n#BuildBridgesNotWalls\n\nXingTheGap.com\n\nBoomTheShow.com\n\nRickMiller.ca\n\nig: @RickMillerActor\n\nig: @kpmbarch\n\nAs a bonus to season 1 of Xing The Gap, we're releasing video versions of your favourite episodes.
