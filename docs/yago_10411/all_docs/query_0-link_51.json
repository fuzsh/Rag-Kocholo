        "text": "A Canadian comedy duo, including a member of \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?,\" will headline this year's Lambton College Presidential Gala.\n\nThe husband and wife combo of Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath will be the guest speakers at the fourth annual event May 9.\n\nLambton College Foundation Director Marc Guilbeault said the pair will certainly entertain all those in attendance.\n\n\"It's very exciting for the school and for the community. This is our signature fundraising event, and we've had great success and great feedback from our corporate partners and the community about bringing in these special Canadian acts, so we're looking forward to another great year.\"\n\nGuilbeault said they're hoping for another record-breaking event at this year's gala.\n\n\"We're really aiming to surpass last year's mark of $90,000 [raised], which was a record for us at the gala,\" he said. \"We've had a sellout every year thus far and I'm fully expecting that we'll have a sellout for this year's event once again.\"\n\nTickets for the annual event go on sale on March 9.\n\nOver his long career dating back to 1977, Mochrie has received a number of accolades, including multiple Canadian Comedy Awards, a Gemini Award, and a Writers Guild of Canada award -- the 62-year-old Scottish-born Canadian actor was also named the Canadian Comedy Person of the Year at the CAAs in 2013.\n\nMcGrath, 65, started her acting career in the 1980s with The Second City improv theatre in Toronto. Since then, she has acted, written and directed across the industry.\n\nMcGrath and Mochrie have been married since 1989 and have one child together."
