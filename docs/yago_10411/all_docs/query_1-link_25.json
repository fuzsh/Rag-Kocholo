        "text": "Canada, eh?\n\nJay Baruchel kicks things off as the comedians jump on the LOL train and hold on for dear life. Thanks to Tom Green and some hardcore sax - it doesnât take long for it all to go off the rails.\n\nGrilled Cheese, eh?\n\nThe epic comedy battle continues, and the gloves are off! Jay sends Mae and Jon to the daunting âpenalty boxâ. And a surprise guest appearance might be too much for the comedians to bare.\n\nWeresquirrel, eh?\n\nIn the savage third episode of LOL Canadaâ¦ Colin goes squirrely, Brandon pulls some real dick moves, and a bunch of the comedians refuse to pardon their French. Who will be forced to say their au revoirs as a sea of reds turn the game on its head?\n\nWipeout, eh!\n\nThis episode of LOL Canada has it all â table humping, fake boobs, creepy puppets, a livid Academy Award nominee, and pizza! And while the remaining comedians try to hold their ground, Colin wipes out twice and puts Tom on his heels in another cheesy onslaught.\n\nClash of the Titans, eh?\n\nThe train takes its final lap around the LOL studio as the final four comedians try to stay on track. In the epic season one finale, the action has Jay seeing red. And in the end, a comedic duel for the ages goes down to the wire and once the dust settles, the first LOL Canada champ will emerge victorious."
