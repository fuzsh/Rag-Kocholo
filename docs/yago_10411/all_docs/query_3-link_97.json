        "text": "For more than 17 years, County Stage Company has been bringing the beautiful landscape of Prince Edward County to life through the summer with music, food, and plenty of theatre. With more artists and shows than ever, 2023’s summer festival promises to be the County’s most ambitious yet.\n\nArtistic director Graham Abbey and managing director Vikki Anderson announced the festival line-up this morning, with seemingly endless options for theatre-goers. Running from May 26 to September 9, the 2023 season (presented by BMO and Huff Estates) brings an expansive lineup of theatre, dance, comedy, and music to two different locations in Prince Edward County: The Eddie Hotel & Farm, located in Bloomfield, and Base31’s newly renovated Sergeants’ Mess Hall in Picton.\n\n“We’re doing things a little different this year,” Abbey said in a press release. “We’re elated to announce that we have two venues in the County this season, allowing County Stage to reach a broader audience. We love being back at The Eddie [Hotel and Farm] and we’re thrilled to be a part of the new Base31 project.”\n\nThis season, County Stage is rolling out a new, inclusive ticketing program, offering lower-priced tickets and a 25 & Under Free program for shows at The Eddie Pavilion. The festival will host a series of interactive, all-ages community programs, including a summer book club presented in association with Books & Company in Picton.\n\n“We’re proud to introduce a new ticketing initiative offering lower admission prices for all shows and free admission to anyone 25 and under at our Eddie Pavilion events,” said Anderson. “We want families to bring their kids, we want teens and young adults to make theatre a habit. With our new lower general admission price, we want to remove as many barriers to entry as possible for our entire audience.”\n\nIn addition to the 2023 season, County Stage is continuing their mandate of investing in development and outreach projects, including their annual Indigenous Theatre Creator Program in collaboration with Tsi Tyónnheht Onkwawén:na. The program awards an Indigenous creator funds and support from the County Stage team, allowing them to create and workshop a new piece of theatrical work.\n\nThis fall, County Stage is proud to launch About Face, a multidisciplinary art engagement program for Canadian military members and veterans. The program uses performing arts as a therapeutic tool to support and advance the holistic well-being of those who have, and are currently serving in Canada’s military. Held at Base31, which previously functioned as a mess hall for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) No. 31 Bombing and Gunnery School during World War II, About Face will offer free workshops with artists and therapist facilitators.\n\n“We are presenting over 60 performances, on three different stages, showcasing 67 artists! 2023 is County Stage’s largest season ever,” Abbey continued. “Come enjoy intimate cabaret nights at Base31 featuring iconic singer-songwriters and top comedians at Base31’s Sergeants’ Mess Hall; see theatre under the stars at outdoor Eddie Pavilion including a comedy masterpiece, a world premiere and a dance festival; and enjoy a seldom performed off-Broadway hit in our new pub-theatre at The Eddie. We have more shows, more artists, more venues, and more ways to come out and enjoy live performing arts.”\n\nHere’s what you’ll discover in County Stage’s 2023 summer season.\n\nThe Mess Hall Sessions\n\nPresented by County Stage and Base31\n\nMay 26 – September 9, 2023 | 7:30 pm\n\nSergeants’ Mess Hall | Base31 | Picton, ON\n\n$35 General Chair Seating | $55 Preferred Table Seating\n\nShowcasing acclaimed Canadian singers and musical theatre performers in an intimate indoor cabaret space, The Mess Hall Sessions are curated by County Stage artistic associate Beau Dixon, one of the creators and performers of last season’s hit The Shape of Home.\n\nTHE VERANDAH SOCIETY | May 26 & 27\n\nIn the vein of Stuart McLean’s “The Vinyl Cafe”, The Verandah Society is a charming, humorous, and heartfelt show that takes audiences on an entertaining journey with storytelling and song writing.
