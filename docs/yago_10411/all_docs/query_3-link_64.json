        "text": "Title: The Course Of True Love\n\nAuthor: Jie Jie\n\nRating: PG\n\nPairings: Colin/Ryan, touch of Ryan/Greg\n\nWordcount: 4000\n\nSummary: Ryan and Colin's relationship breaks down. Can they pick up the pieces?\n\nA/N - Part 2 has landed...Comments/criticism would be much appreciated!\n\nAnd could I get a story tag please? ^_^\n\nAn audience and a microphone were all Greg Proops had ever needed. He swaggered across the stage, a smirk on his lips, as the crowd cheered. Finally getting bored of the reception Greg waved his hands for quiet.\n\n“Wow, I guess you guys don't get a lot of excitement here in L.A., huh?” Greg drawled. “Animals, vegetables and minerals, we have got a great show for you tonight. Please welcome the fantabulous Jeff Davis, the magnanimous Colin Mochrie and the ever ambidextrous Ryan Stiles!”\n\nWhen Colin walked out onto the stage he had a genuine smile on his face at the warm reaction of the crowd. Usually those stage lights hit him and he could set aside any problems he'd been having. Today, as he watched Ryan clap Greg on the shoulder, he wasn't finding it so easy. He really needed to stop thinking.\n\n“Okay, we're gonna start the show with a game called Superheroes,” Ryan announced as Greg took centre stage. The crowd cheered their enthusiasm for the well known game. “First we need the name of an unlikely superhero for Greg here.”\n\n“Amnesia boy!”\n\n“Irritable bowel man!”\n\n“Major Snuggles!”\n\n“Okay, I think we'll take Major Snuggles, right Greg?” Ryan chuckled as Greg casually flipped him off. “What world crisis is there for Major Snuggles to solve?”\n\n“It won't stop snowing,” a woman in the front row shouted.\n\n“Well, that certainly is a crisis for California. Take it away Greg.”\n\n“Gee thanks,” Greg said before dropping into character. He yawned widely and stretched out his arms. “Oh, another day here in my fortress of snuggle-tude. I wonder how all my cute little animal friends are this morning?” Greg walked towards his imaginary window, threw open the curtains and paused for dramatic effect.\n\n“Great leaping bush babies! It's snowing in L.A., that's surely one of the signs of the apocalypse. Boy, I hope my super friends get here soon!”\n\n“Sorry I'm late,” Ryan said as he walked into the scene. “I was busy shovelling snow.”\n\nSeveral cracks involving Ryan's big nose and a mountain of blow ran through Greg's head but he held them back. He was Major Snuggles after all. Living up to his title he walked behind Ryan and wrapped his arms around him, rubbing his face against Ryan's arm.\n\n“Thank God you're here, Claustrophobic Kid. Look, there's snow everywhere!” Ryan immediately started to fidget, pulling at the collar of his Oxford shirt and wiping his forehead.\n\n“If it's snowing why is it so hot? Does it feel hot to you? Why are you standing so close to me?”\n\n“You don't mind me snuggling, right?” Greg asked as he plastered himself even closer to Ryan.\n\n“Sorry I'm late,” Colin frowned as he took in Ryan and Greg's intimate position. “I thought we were supposed to be solving a world crisis, not having a love in.” Ryan noticed the bitter tone and his mouth worked before his brain had a chance to remind him that today was not the day to mess with Colin.\n\n“Oh look, it's Captain Killjoy,” Ryan instantly regretted the words. He saw his friend's jaw tighten in that familiar gesture of annoyance. Colin pushed his way between the pair, effectively breaking them apart. He held up his hands defensively when Greg tried to hug him in Ryan's stead.\n\n“I don't know what you're so happy about, four-eyes,” Colin snapped. He heard the reaction from the crowd and knew he needed to work to keep his tone relatively benign. “You know your little animal friends are all popsicles by now.”\n\n“No, not fluffy!” Greg cried with mock horror. Of course he knew why Colin was on edge but it still took every ounce of his self control not to pay back the insult. Fortunately Jeff chose that moment to enter the game.\n\n“Sorry I'm late, my snow mobile wouldn't start.”\n\n“Thank goodness you're here...Saturday Night Fever Boy.”\n\nJeff took a moment to give Colin a wry look. When he dropped into his best Travolta impression the audience screamed their approval as he strutted his way across the stage.\n\n“Just do the cha cha, man,” Jeff said with a grin. “We'll make so much heat the snow will melt.”\n\nColin put a hand on Jeff's shoulder and looked at him seriously. “I have to tell you: disco's dead.”\n\n“Wow, you really are Captain Killjoy!” Jeff shook his head. “Excuse me, I gotta hustle on outta here.” Jeff danced his way off stage leaving the awkward trio alone.\n\n“I'm gonna go too,” Colin said, although in truth he was reluctant to leave the stage. It meant leaving Greg and Ryan in the spotlight together and that didn't sit well with him. “I've got to go tell some kids that Santa isn't real.”\n\nIt turned out that Colin needn't have worried, Ryan knew better than to let Greg snuggle up to him again. He looked down at his watch.\n\n“Oh, I'm late for my date with Agoraphobic Girl!” Ryan dashed from centre stage, leaving Greg to wrap up the scene. He headed straight for Colin who did not look happy. “Col - ”\n\nColin cut him off before he could even begin to apologise. “I'm sorry, that was all me. I'll get it together.”\n\nRyan growled with frustration as Jeff called the next game. It was going to be a long night.\n\n*\n\nA cigarette and a shot was in order, Ryan decided as he headed towards his dressing room after the show. The evening hadn't been as bad as he'd initially feared. There had been a few more tense moments, especially between Colin and Greg, but they'd all warmed up as the show went along. That hadn't stopped Colin from quickly excusing himself from the backstage frivolities. Ryan had copied Colin's actions shortly after. He really needed to think about things and decide just what he was going to do. There were so many life altering choices to make. Quite frankly it was a terrifying prospect.\n\nA feminine voice interrupted his musings. “Hey there, big bird.”\n\n“I know that voice,” Ryan said with a smile. He turned around and there, in all her petite glory, was Debra McGrath. “Deb!” Ryan enveloped her in a friendly hug, genuinely pleased to see her again. He had always liked Deb. When she hit him solidly around the head he began to rethink his opinion of her. “Ow! What was that for?” He asked as he pulled back, one hand rubbing his abused crown.\n\n“Do you really have to ask?” Deb put her hands on her hips and stared up at the six foot six performer fearlessly. “You messed up, Stiles.”\n\n“I messed up bigger than you know,” Ryan admitted with a sigh.\n\n“You did something worse than sleeping with Greg Proops?” Deb asked. She smiled a little at Ryan's shocked expression.\n\n“How – ?”\n\n“I'm omnipotent,” she said with a delicate shrug. “Either that, or Gregory told me everything about ten minutes ago.” Ryan gritted his teeth against a wave of anger.\n\n“I think Greg needs to learn the meaning of discretion,” he growled. Deb rubbed his arm soothingly.\n\n“You can still fix this.”\n\n“How?” All Ryan could see in his head was the expression of betrayal and hurt on Colin's face. Sure they'd gotten through the show all right but there was a huge difference between their on-stage persona’s and their real lives. He couldn't see a way past the mess he had created.\n\n“You're both over-thinking things,” Deb said. “I think you should go back stage right now, grab Colin and kiss him.”\n\n“Grab him and kiss him?” Ryan's eyebrows shot up. “That's your great advice? And why are you trying to fix me up with your ex-husband anyway?”\n\n“Because you may be his best friend, but he's mine. And these last few weeks he's been miserable.” When Ryan looked doubtful Deb reached out and smacked him once more. “It's true!”\n\n“He's got every right to be pissed at me,” Ryan said, though Deb could tell from his body language that she was starting to get through to him.\n\n“You two are meant to be together,” she said with a certainty that was difficult to argue with. “And everything else is just crap.” When Ryan didn't move, Deb reached out and gave him a gentle push in the direction of Colin's dressing.\n\n“You aren't gonna let this go, are you?” Ryan said, though he seemed more amused than anything. Deb flashed him a warm smile.\n\n“You know me too well,” She quipped. “Come on, let's see if we can find you the Lesser Spotted Mochrie.”\n\n*\n\nColin almost ran down the corridor he was so high on performance adrenaline. It hadn't been a brilliant show, not by a long shot, but they'd gotten a good riff going by the end and the crowd had left happy. Colin's pace slowed slightly, a frown touching his brow, as he recalled just how awkward he'd felt at first. Having to perform with Greg and Ryan and knowing that they'd...that they had... He couldn't even bring himself to think about it just yet. It had been difficult but professionalism had prevailed. Colin reached his dressing room and pushed open the door. There, perched on his dressing table, was Brad Sherwood, crutches and all.\n\n“Brad,” Colin broke into a grin. “What are you doing here?”\n\n“I came to see the show. I wanted to make sure you weren't having too much fun without me.”\n\n“What did you think?” Colin felt a thrill of nervousness run through him as it always did when it came to talking about his own comedic performances. When Brad hesitated for a moment Colin's heart sank. “It was that bad?”\n\n“No, no, it was fine,” Brad said quickly. “I mean, the second half was great. The first half...not so much.”\n\n“Gee, Brad, don't tiptoe around my feelings or anything. Tell it like it is.”\n\n“Sorry man,” Brad shrugged. “Hey, you knew it was gonna be awkward.”\n\n“Not this awkward,” Colin muttered under his breath. Brad tilted his head to one side curiously but let the comment slide. “How long 'til you get the cast off?”\n\n“Four more weeks,” Brad said. He was strangely relieved to see disappointment on Colin's face. Part of him had been worried that after performing with Ryan again Colin wouldn't want to work with anyone else. It looked like his fears had been misplaced.\n\n“Can't you heal faster or something?” Colin teased, a small smile playing on his lips. Brad rolled his eyes and reached for his crutches. He shifted his weight up onto them and yelped as they slipped against the dressing room tiles.\n\n“Fuck!” He swore as he lost his balance. For a moment Brad thought he was going to hit the deck but strong arms caught hold of him and pulled him against a firm chest.\n\n“You really are uniquely co-ordinated,” Colin laughed. Brad rolled his eyes, by now he'd gotten used to the teasing. He looked up at Colin and couldn't help but be amused by the damsel in distress position he'd ended up in.\n\n“My hero,” Brad crooned in a falsetto and batted his lashes at Colin. “Kiss me, kiss me!” Never one to back down from a challenge, Colin grinned and leaned down to press a firm stage kiss to Brad's lips. A less than subtle clearing of the throat made them pull apart. Colin looked up to see his ex-wife and ex-partner both standing in the doorway. Deb was giving him that look which told him he'd done something monumentally stupid. Ryan's expression was unreadable.\n\n“Forget it,” Ryan said quietly and left as quickly as he'd arrived.\n\n“Ryan!” Colin called after him but was unable to give chase with his arms full of his accident prone co-star. “Shit.”\n\nDeb picked up Brad's crutches from the floor and helped get him upright. Colin hesitated for a moment, looking at the empty doorway with troubled eyes. Brad and Deb exchanged an exasperated glance.\n\n“Uh, Colin?” Brad said and waved a hand in front of Colin's face. “Shouldn't you be going after him?”\n\nColin was torn. Part of him wanted to chase after Ryan and make things okay, his insides were all twisted up with guilt. Another, darker and more bitter, part of his psyche was too busy providing him with images of Greg and Ryan sharing much more than a stage kiss.\n\nHe shook his head slowly. “No.”\n\n“Why the hell not?” Brad asked. He knew that Colin and Ryan were having problems but they were still close. That Colin would even consider not chasing after Ryan meant something serious had gone down in the last couple of weeks.\n\n“Because of Greg?” Deb asked shrewdly. Colin looked up at her, surprise written across his face. Brad simply looked lost.\n\n“What about Greg?”\n\n“How do you know about that?” Colin asked warily.\n\n“There really are no secrets around here.”\n\nBrad looked between the two of them, feeling like a spectator at a tennis match.\n\n“Someone want to clue in the cripple here?” He asked, an edge of annoyance in his voice. Colin sighed. He really didn't want to have this conversation. Admitting it made it seem more real somehow. Still, Brad was one of his few close friends and he deserved to know what was going on.\n\n“Ryan's screwing Greg,” he said flatly, the words tasted bitter in his mouth. He looked at anything but Brad, not wanting to see pity on his partner's face.\n\n“What?” Brad said, instantly outraged on Colin's behalf.\n\n“You broke up with Ryan, remember?” Deb interjected. “And just for the record, it was a one night thing.” Colin felt a stab of pain behind his ribcage.\n\n“You don't know that,” he said quietly.\n\n“Yes I do,” Deb disagreed. “And so would you if you'd just go and talk to him.”\n\n“Excuse me,” Colin couldn't talk about it any more. He knew his ex-wife well enough to know that she wouldn't let the matter drop. Sometimes it was easier to just remove himself from the situation. Without looking at either Deb or Brad, Colin fled the room.\n\n“You know, if I didn't have a broken leg I'd be kicking Stiles' ass right now,” Brad said casually.\n\nDeb patted his arm. “You keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.”\n\n*\n\nGreg was sitting on the steps of a fire escape at the back of the theatre, a lit cigarette hanging loosely from his fingertips. His solitude was disrupted when the fire door banged open and Colin stumbled out into the cool night air.\n\n“Hey Col.”\n\nColin recognised his friend's voice easily and his shoulders slumped. It seemed like there was no running away from his problems tonight.\n\n“Hi Greg,” he replied with an obvious lack of enthusiasm. “I didn't think anyone would be out here.”\n\n“Sorry to disappoint man,” Greg eyed the Canadian warily. After their pre-show conversation and the tension on stage Greg didn't know what kind of reaction to expect from his fellow performer. “So, you want to punch me or something?” He offered as he pulled himself to his feet. Colin slumped back against the wall and ran a hand over his face wearily.\n\n“I'm not going to punch you,” he said, a slight hint of laughter in his voice at the very thought of him hitting anyone. “It's just hard to adjust to the fact that Ryan and I aren't together any more, you know?”\n\nGreg took a drag on his cigarette. He stayed quiet, waiting for Colin to continue.\n\n“I don't have any claim on him any more. If you want to go out with Ryan then it's nothing to do with me.” It was the sad truth. Colin had hoped that Ryan would fight for their relationship, that he'd do what he had promised and make things right. With every day that passed, every conversation they had, that hope was looking more and more dim. Perhaps Ryan had the right idea and both of them should just move on with their lives.\n\n“Oh really?” Greg raised one eyebrow and his voice turned challenging. “So you'd have no problem if I went for it with Ryan then?” Colin burned with jealousy but forced a smile on to his face.\n\n“Of course not,” the words fell between them, empty and hollow. Greg dropped his cigarette to the stairs and crushed it beneath his heel.\n\n“Right, see you later then Col,” he said and headed back inside the venue. Colin felt a flash of panic as his active imagination kicked into overdrive. Colin shook his head violently but that didn't stop the images that flashed in his mind. Greg kissing Ryan. Ryan tearing off Greg's clothes. The two of them making love in Ryan's dressing room. No. He couldn't let that happen. Colin opened the door and dashed after Greg. The San Franciscan had stumbled upon Jeff in the corridor and they were talking, their postures open and relaxed.\n\nColin stalked up to them and tapped Greg on the shoulder. “Greg.”\n\nGreg turned to look at Colin with a knowing smirk that was the last straw. Colin caught him solidly across the chin with a mean punch that made Greg stumble backwards.\n\n“Fuck!” Greg swore in surprise. He'd expected Colin to come after him, hell that was the point of his teasing. He really didn't want Ryan like that, the idea had been to make his friend realise that he couldn't just move on so quickly. He hadn't expected the mild mannered Canadian to actually hit him. The wound to Greg's pride was compounded when Jeff laughed.\n\n“Nice left hook, man,” Jeff said, looking at Colin in a whole new light. Colin ignored the comment as he shook out his aching hand, looking almost as shocked as Greg himself.\n\n“Feel better now?” Greg asked, rubbing his jaw and hoping like hell it wasn't going to bruise too badly. Colin looked adorably bewildered as he shrugged.\n\n“I do actually,” he admitted. “We're okay?”\n\n“Yeah, man,” Greg said, clapping a hand on Colin's shoulder. “I deserved that. You're so buying me some concealer if this baby bruises up before our next show.”\n\n“Deal,” Colin was mostly grateful that Greg could forgive his momentary outburst of violence so easily. “Oh, and Greg?”\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“Stay the fuck away from Ryan.”\n\nHaving said his piece Colin headed off down the corridor, leaving Greg and Jeff alone. Jeff reached out and lifted Greg's chin to get a good look at the abused area.\n\n“I didn't think Colin had it in him,” he said in amazement. “You should get some ice on that.”\n\n“You could just kiss it better,” Greg suggested with a waggle of his eyebrows. Jeff laughed at the cheek of the man. Deciding to play along for the moment, he brushed his lips gently across Greg's jawbone. Being as close as he was to the other performer he could hear the way Greg's breath caught in his throat when skin met skin. He let the kiss linger for a moment before pulling back and regarding Greg with a smirk. Greg reached up to press a hand to the area when Jeff's lips had just touched. He winced at the tenderness he found there.\n\n“You know, actually I think I'll just take the ice... Hey!” Greg shouted as Jeff punched his shoulder solidly. “What the fuck is this? Abuse Greg Day?”\n\n“You asked for it Greg,” Jeff said, shaking his head ruefully. “Your mouth is going to get you in serious trouble some day.”\n\n“Well obviously,” Greg was quick to admit. “But it's going to get me out of it again too.” The lecherous grin on Greg's face made it obvious what he was talking about. Jeff rolled his eyes. The man was just insufferable. Jeff grabbed Greg's hand in his and dragged him down the corridor in search of some ice. When it came to Greg Proops sometimes actions were much better than words.\n\n*\n\nRyan paced up and down the empty lobby of the theatre. He was furious. It wasn't that he was jealous, oh no, that wasn't the reason he was angry at all. It was the fact that Colin was such a fucking hypocrite that made his blood boil. He'd had the nerve to guilt trip Ryan over one drunken night with Greg when it was clear that he'd been having an affair with Brad. He had never been comfortable with the amount of time that the two of them spent on the road together during their tours. Of course, Colin had often assured him that Brad was just a friend. What a load of bull shit that had turned out to be.\n\n“You're going to wear a hole in that carpet if you don't chill, dude,” Brad said from where he was leaning against the abandoned reception desk. Ryan hadn't even seen him arrive.\n\n“I don't see how that's your problem, dude,” the words were mocking and laced with venom. If he didn't need to hold on to his crutches Brad would have lifted his palms in a placating gesture. He had his own beef with Ryan but first of all he owed it to Colin to put the record straight.\n\n“You're pissed over nothing Ryan,” he said with all the sincerity he could muster. “Seriously, we were just messing around. It was nothing but stage kiss.”\n\n“Whatever.”\n\n“Come on man,” Brad said, getting a little tired of Ryan's double standards. “It was a harmless stage kiss and even if it wasn't you aren't exactly one to talk.” When Ryan's eyes narrowed into a glare Brad couldn't help but think that might have been the wrong thing to say. For a moment it looked like Ryan was going to explode but then his shoulders relaxed and he shook his head with a quiet laugh that made Brad even more nervous. “What's so funny?”\n\n“Nothing,” Ryan said. “It's just, me and Colin split up over two months ago.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“And look at us! Colin's mad at me because I slept with Greg, I'm mad at him because he was kissing you backstage. It's like we're still going out but without all the fun parts.”\n\nBrad frowned, he didn't like the way this conversation was heading. “What are you trying to say, man?”\n\n“I'm not sure yet,” Ryan said, he couldn't get his thoughts straight. “Whatever it is I should be saying it to Colin though.” Brad made a noise of agreement. Now that he had calmed Ryan noticed Brad's cast and crutches for the first time. “How's your leg doing?”\n\n“It's getting there,” Brad replied, glancing down at his immobilised leg.\n\n“You need a ride?”\n\n“Don't you want to talk to Col?” Brad's use of the casual nickname made anger flicker briefly behind Ryan's eyes.\n\n“Not yet,” he said. “I need to think about some things.”\n\nBrad was sure he didn't want to know what those things were.\n\nTo Be Continued...\n\nGood, bad or indifferent, let me know! ^_^"
