        "text": "Just as she’s released from the hospital in real life, we have another Kathy Griffin episode, back to her S5 taping complete with ‘HAAAEEEEHH’ lady bellowing every time there’s something funny. Knowing this episode, we’ll be hearing that a lot.\n\nDrew sort of dances down the stairs dangerously this show\n\nRyan: “Can you come down the stairs normal, I’ve got a mortgage.”\n\nQuestions Only: passions erupt at a luxury beach resort\n\nDrew starts, as this is the first game of the taping, by saying ‘Kathy Griffin, one of the funniest women in the whole wide world, nice to have you on the show”\n\nI’d honestly agree with Drew. Kathy Griffin might be one of the funniest women performers in the show’s history. Not THE, as Josie Lawrence and Heather Anne Campbell still exist, but ONE OF.\n\nKathy gets the game IMMEDIATELY, as Wayne starts massaging her back: “Can you do it faster?”\n\nWayne: “Stella, you want your groove back?”\n\nWayne: [removes progressively smaller pairs of underwear]\n\nKathy: “annnd…what’s his name?”\n\nWayne: “would you like to meet Captain Willie?”\n\nRyan, 5 lines into his scene with Wayne: “…why aren’t you wearing any clothes?”\n\nWayne accidentally goes for a pun response to Ryan’s ‘WOULD I?’ [‘PEG LEG?’] instead of doing a better question\n\nColin, summing up Questions Only in one line: “…am I too late for the passions erupting?”\n\nRyan, testing Colin, asks if he’s ‘Fluffy the mime?’\n\nColin mimes a question mark. Ryan’s AMAZED\n\nRyan: “How much time did you spend in the joint?”\n\nColin: “Do you mean jail?”\n\nRyan: “What’s the joint mean to you?”\n\nColin, waving his arms: “WHY ARE ALL THESE THINGS SO…FRESH AND STRANGE TO ME?”\n\nRyan, caught off guard by the hand waving: “…I can’t…”\n\nBUZZ\n\nIn the master, Drew’s still making fun of Colin’s hand waving\n\nColin, to Kathy: “Where have you been all my life?”\n\nKathy: “What are you SAYING, tiger?”\n\nColin, exact same tone as before: “…Where have you been all my life?”\n\nKathy: “Is this too…hot for you?”\n\nColin, goofily dancing and gyrating: “IS THIS?”\n\nKathy: ‘…yes.”\n\nBUZZ BUZZ BUZZ\n\nReally fun round of this. Very substantial, and Kathy fit right in with the other 3. Also, no sign of HAAAEEEEHH lady yet.\n\nWeird Newscasters: Colin anchors, Kathy, Clueless teenage Whose Line? groupie who has made it onto the show, co-anchors, Wayne, The dancing host of Soul Train gradually morphing into a goofy white guy then back again, does sports while Ryan, Vegas stage magician who only knows silly “Dad” tricks but performs them as if he’s David Copperfield, does weather\n\nThis is a mix of two playings of this game. Kathy and Wayne had different ones in both. This one I believe has the 1st playing’s Wayne and the 2nd playing’s Kathy. Ryan only did one.\n\nDrew, on Wayne’s: “Oh boy…you’re gonna get a letter…”\n\nColin: “Welcome to the 6:00 news-”\n\nKathy: “AND YOU JUST MAKE THAT UP? OH MY GOD.”\n\nThat is perfect. Right from the getgo.\n\nColin’s top story: “A fight was started downtown by a man wearing a suit made completely of mirrors. The police said the man apologized once he had time to sit down and reflect.”\n\nHAAAEEEEHH NUMBER ONE. THERE WE GO. I WAS WORRIED.\n\nKathy’s freaking out about that Colin joke, turns and “OHHH MY GOD, DREW CAREY!”\n\nShe kisses him on the cheek, which is honestly the most flattering thing to ever happen to Drew in this game.\n\nWayne does a good job with his, slowly morphing into someone really uncool, but once he has a goofy white guy from the audience play him at the end, he has a hard time getting him to get the gist of the joke. Takes him more than a second.\n\nSomehow, the goofy guy starts dancing and getting back on the audience’s side, which is NOT something Wayne expected\n\nColin, finally: “Wow…that was sad.”\n\nRyan also tries some goofiness, like putting his hand up his sleeve and looking like it appears, and doing finger tricks.\n\nThen, Ryan goes to the audience and asks an audience member for their jacket.\n\nThat person down there, handing Ryan the jacket, is Elyse, who was one of the pioneering Whosers of the Drew run LA tapings. She was one of the prominent Whosers who attended six of the ten Season 5 tapings, and wrote reports online for fans to predict upcoming episodes with. I say this, because…\n\nRyan: “Nothing in this jacket…EXCEPT…for a pad of paper and a pen, but I’m not gonna use that…”\n\nYeah, that pad and pen was what Elyse was using to document games and happenings from the taping. Firstly, it was hard for her to do this one BEING IN THE FRONT ROW, but also…Ryan just pointed out her tell to everyone. Her pad’s been exposed. Now people who are in the know KNOW she’s taking notes.\n\nI often wonder what would have happened if there was another round of LA tapings in 2002. Would the producers be policing pads and pens thanks to this incident? Would Elyse, Michelle, LKK and the other prominent reporting Whosers even be ADMITTED? It’s only a what if, because this was the last round of tapings for the Drew era.\n\nRyan uses the jacket to duck under and perform an escape act. Colin’s just amused as hell. He eventually appears in the audience, after annoying several row members\n\nRyan, after running back from the audience, then returning Elyse’s jacket, and getting back to the seats, acts like nothing’s happened.\n\nDrew: “…quite a workout ya got there…”\n\nAn alright WN, but the antics of audience members were funnier than some of the actual quirks.\n\nIrish Drinking Song: Graduation v1\n\nOh boy.\n\nRyan, on the audience applauding for this, cracks to Colin: “It’s a crowd favorite”\n\nI’m guessing this was during pickups\n\nKathy: “My mom and dad are so proud”\n\nColin: “I am so happy”\n\nRyan: “There she is, she’s loud!”\n\nI love the randomness of Wayne specifying “To DeVry I’m going!”\n\nRyan: “Then I’ll have a wife and kids”\n\nWayne: “And then I’ll read the bard”\n\nWayne cracks, as he had nothing\n\nKathy has trouble rhyming with ‘proud’, so Ryan has her go with ‘day’\n\nWayne: “I’m glad I graduated”\n\nKathy: “And wish I wasn’t gay!”\n\nRyan, progressing the story: “Today I just got laid off”\n\nWayne: “Ah…good grash.”\n\nKathy: “Graduation’s off our memory”\n\nColin, with nothing: “I HAVE TO GO TO A NEW PLACE.”\n\nSo, like the Kathy one, Wayne compensates by giving Colin something anything can rhyme with, “What will I DO?”\n\nKathy: “I’LL GET THE BEER NOZZEL KNOB.”\n\nColin…as everyone’s been progressing time further and further this game, goes the furthest: “There’s blood in my stool!”\n\nAND THE REACTIONS…\n\nIT’S IMMEDIATE. Kathy’s pretty strong here, but even SHE’S taken aback by this.\n\nPoor Ryan\n\nThere’s not even a full reaction from Drew. Colin’s pulled so many of these that he just facepalms\n\nKathy, back at the seats: “…what? That totally made sense to me”\n\nWayne, with a line that still cracks me up: “Improv AND a medical report!”\n\nRyan even points out the funniest part of this: “well, ya know it was supposed to rhyme with DO.”\n\nColin: “…okay, POO I GUESS, but I didn’t wanna go that route…”\n\nKathy: “No, I liked that it was REAL.”\n\nDrew: “I’m not givin’ ANY points for that one…”\n\nColin: “I shouldn’t be the last person.”\n\n[Memo to the CW, this was a JOKE.]\n\nA very funny IDS. Very bottom heavy, but funny\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\n“Disturbing things to hear someone yell out during sex.”\n\nWayne: “…I’VE GOT BLOOD IN MY STOO-”\n\nHAAAEEEEHH NUMBER 2\n\nI think this reaction is in response to that laugh\n\nAs the audience laughs at this, Kathy even throws in an IDS refrain\n\nKathy: “YOUR NAME! I CAN’T REMEMBER YOUR NAME!”\n\nWayne: “DREW!”\n\n“Odd things to say using a sexy voice”\n\nColin: “…you have a booger hanging out of your nose…”\n\nDrew: “Bad moments for a woman’s water to break”\n\nWayne: [does a circus routine with Kathy]\n\nHAAAEEEEHH NUMBER 3, RIGHT AT A QUIET MOMENT.\n\nWayne, recovering, holds up the child like it’s part of the act\n\nHAAAEEEEHH NUMBER 4. THEY’RE ALL COMING NOW\n\nKathy: “Don’t be nervous, it’s okay, I’m a virgin….OHHH…NO I’M NOT, NO I’M NOT!”\n\nThat’s funny. Kind of reminds me of some of Heather’s jokes from the CW version\n\nRyan: [hums the first 4 notes of Here Comes the Bride]\n\nColin: “OHHHHH!”\n\nHAHAHAHA\n\nRyan: [hastily hums the rest of the song, rushing Colin down the aisle]\n\nDrew: “When a passionate kiss is completely out of line.”\n\n[any time on Whose Line?]\n\nColin and Ryan eye each other nervously.\n\nWayne starts out a scene onstage, then:\n\nWOW\n\nAnd, of course:\n\nRyan: [hums first 4 notes of Here Comes the Bride]\n\nColin, different tone: “OH!”\n\nRyan just makes sure Drew buzzes before the kiss.\n\nWayne: “Alright, officer”\n\nKathy: “Yeah, we’re taking you in”\n\nAnd in the absolute best timing:\n\nKathy, to Drew: “not so bad, is he?”\n\nWayne:\n\nHAHAHAHAHA\n\nWayne does a football pep talk to end it, but Colin’s frightened the entire time, because he’s directly next to Wayne, and he knows what’s gonna happen. Eventually:\n\nColin’s still tense as hell\n\nBUZZ BUZZ BUZZ\n\nI love it. They both can’t believe the things they have to do on this show.\n\nReally, REALLY funny SFAH. Lots of substantial, fun scenes. Wayne did a nice amount of heavy lifting, too\n\nWorld’s Worst: Person to Share an Office With\n\nWe follow this quick-fire round with…another quick-fire round!\n\nI love that Kathy gets to play this one, too. They’re actually giving her a chance, despite being a female performer. I like this!\n\nDrew: [steps out]\n\nWayne: [buzzes]\n\nRyan: “ohhhhhh AYE DE DI DE DI DE DI…”\n\nColin: ‘……….AAAAAAAHHHHHH!”\n\n[this is me at work]\n\nRyan: [puts on headphones…sings aloud to Lido Shuffle by Boz Scaggs]\n\n[this is how I learned this song, lol]\n\nColin, calling back to 5×02: “Anyone up for monkey testicles and cola?”\n\n[Also, this scene reminds me of how much Colin reminds me of Colin Robinson from What we do in the Shadows]\n\nDrew’s lowbrow runner elicits one more HAAAEEEEHH, bringing us to 5.\n\nKathy at least does a GOOD lowbrow one, using a CD to pop a zit\n\nKathy has another nice one: “Listen, honey, I don’t wanna have a fight at work, alright? My office-mate’s right here……..WELL MAYBE IF YOU COULD GET IT UP ONCE IN A WHILE, I WOULDN’T HAVE TO SCREW YOUR BROTHER EVERY TWO SECONDS!”\n\nKathy Griffin was so damn good on this show, man\n\nColin, lifting something: “…hey, there’s blood on my stool!”\n\nRyan:\n\nAnd, right at the end, HAAAEEEEHH NUMBER SIX.\n\nReally good World’s Worst. Kathy had some good ones. Drew’s fell flat. Colin’s gotten the hang of this game.\n\nOverall: An extremely strong show, from an extremely strong panel, with some extremely funny moments, and yet I don’t even think it cracks the top 5 of this season. Yes, the Whoopi show is still beating this one. But still, this show had the Blood in my Stool runner, but yet that didn’t feel like the highest height this show could muster. Questions Only had amazing improv, Weird Newscasters had amazing audience participation, SFAH had amazing teamwork and World’s Worst had amazing quickfire work. They spread their strengths all over the board, and I didn’t feel disappointed at all, even if Weird Newscasters relied on different factors to get humor. All four felt great, Kathy had a lot of awesome moments, and it flowed really nicely, improving vastly on E2.\n\nShow Winner: Wayne\n\nBest Performer: Colin, in a squeaker. He’s so good here he even wields running gags from other episodes.\n\nWorst Performer: Ryan, oddly enough. Colin, Wayne and Kathy had stronger showings than he did.\n\nBest Game: Scenes from a Hat, narrowly edging out Questions Only because it utilized more unity and collaboration, and also that Here Comes the Bride runner.\n\nWorst Game: Weird Newscasters, but look what it was up against.\n\nFinal HAAAEEEEHH Count: Six. 5×02 had one more. Man, I was expecting LOADS.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Who says Whose Line doesn’t teach you anything? Thanks to this one, a S4 Brad episode from the same taping as the g-strong episode, I know how to say ‘I’m very sorry’ in sign-language\n\nAnother S4 leftover. This one’s from the same Chip taping that gave us the very strong E9. There’s not a TON of peak material here, but enough to keep me intrigued.\n\nLet’s Make a Date: Chip must choose from Wayne, the amazing Italian acrobatic circus family and their world famous stool act, Colin, a backwoods farmer helping his prized cows Wayne & Ryan through difficult multiple births, and Ryan , who is performing Drew Carey – The Musical\n\nRyan, upon reading his:\n\nDrew: “…I’d like to remind RYAN, before we get started, where his paycheck comes from…”\n\nChip’s accent for this round is an ‘eastern European’ one, close to Russian\n\nI love how Wayne does all the different voices for the Italian circus family\n\nWayne, sure enough, does a nice stool-balancing act there. Very similar to actual balancing acts I’ve seen on Got Talent shows\n\nChip: “I am Olympic weightlifter, in my spare time I am foot model.”\n\nColin grabbing and extracting at Wayne’s crotch area is very similar to some of his tickling from last episode. Man, I thought Party Quirks was the only source of Colin continuing to tickle Wayne this taping\n\nOnce Colin turns to Ryan, you just see Ryan’s eyebrows raise, then him stifle uncomfortableness as Colin grabs one out of him\n\nChip: “…Bachelor #2 I like the way you disgust the audience…”\n\nRyan…has fun with his\n\n“My eyes are covered with glass…\n\nAND LOOK AT THE SIZE OF MY ASS…”\n\nRyan: [buzzes musically]\n\nDrew: [grits teeth]\n\nWayne looks like he’s about to attempt another trick…so Colin knows this is a good time to screw with Wayne again, and make it more difficult for him\n\nChip’s question for Colin, “what is your least favorite nickname everyone gives for you?”, gives him a moment’s pause. A brief glimpse of humanity\n\nColin: “Can’t say it on television…man, I’m gonna have to castrate that bull…”\n\nRyan pulls some great faces as Colin yanks another calf from him.\n\nChip, also giving a great one to Ryan: “If someone was to MOCK YOU MERCILESSLY, what would they say to you?”\n\nRyan:\n\nRyan, getting to a classic slam: “I’m…in love with a girl named Maria…[MIMES BLOWING SOMETHING UP]\n\nDrew:\n\nHAHAHAHAHA\n\nColin even breaks here, looks RIGHT AT DREW as Ryan does this\n\nDrew and Ryan just…look at each other for a few seconds after Drew buzzes. A moment of hysterical tension.\n\nDrew, finally: “I’ve got some bad news, during that game…Lewis died!”\n\nHA\n\nChip’s guess for Colin, “a country veterinarian with way too much business’, is not only funnier than the actual quirk, but the plot of The Incredible Dr. Pol\n\nDrew: “Who is Ryan, before we say goodnight to Ryan?”\n\nChip: “I HAVE NO IDE-no…RYAN IS STARRING-”\n\nDrew, buzzing: “I DON’T KNOW EITHER, I dunno who the hell he is…”\n\nSuch a funny round of this, aside from the obvious Ryan gag. I honestly think Ryan’s had the least going on of everybody’s. Colin’s and Wayne’s were much more physical and honestly funnier, though the ‘look at the size of my ass’ line was great.\n\nDrew: “It was fine, I can take a joke as much as everybody, but 1000 points to everybody…”\n\nRyan, mouthing, knowing Drew: “BUT RYAN”\n\nDrew: “…except for Ryan…”\n\nWayne finally asks who Ryan was, and Drew tells him, and Wayne…tries his hardest not to react.\n\nChip, playing along: “I didn’t get that at ALL…”\n\nWayne: “That wasn’t funny at all…”\n\nRyan, summing it up: “I thought I was rather kind…seeing how I’ve got a LOT OF STUFF ON YA…”\n\nPERFECT. Somehow, Ryan still ends up with the upper hand.\n\nDrew: “So like I said, 5000 points to MY GOOD BUDDY RYAN STILES!”\n\nDubbing: Ryan is the leader of the Puerto Rican gang The Sharks and he is outraged when he finds his beautiful girlfriend Maria, audience member Galen, voice by Wayne, flirting with the leader of The Jets, Colin, on a playground in Spanish Harlem\n\nMan, early, pre-guest star dubbing. Wow.\n\nRyan, upon hearing he’s playing a Puerto-Rican, looks away, smirking\n\n“Finally, I get to use my dialects…”\n\nI love the awkward progression from Galen putting her arm around Colin to just a full-on hug. SO MUCH HUGGING IN THESE EARLY AUDIENCE MEMBER GAMES\n\nRyan:\n\nRyan’s already done\n\nGalen’s actually really good at nailing Wayne’s dialogue, even as he goes back for an even more rolled-r Maria.\n\nWayne: “I love the way the moonlight shines off the top of your head onto the monkey bars.”\n\nGalen barely gets through this without cracking\n\nColin, shaking his head: “I love the way you laugh as you talk.”\n\nRyan: “Hey, drop my chalupa.”\n\nHA\n\nGalen has a funny moment, where Wayne says ‘LOOK AT ME’, and Galen takes him literally and looks at Wayne, making Wayne go ‘NO, not you”. This happens repeatedly. It’s very funny.\n\nRyan: “When we moved to America…from Canada…”\n\nYeah, that accounts for that accent\n\nWayne: “I said I’d stay by your side as long as you kept your Canadian-Puerto Rican accent but you’ve obviously LOST IT!”\n\nI love the quick transition to the knife fight, and Ryan just casually stabbing Colin and going ‘that was easy’.\n\nColin: “hey…that’s no fair, I was dancin’ there…”\n\nRyan: “Maria, you must make up your mind”\n\nColin: “Well, I’m dying, so BIG CHOICE…”\n\nWayne sets Galen up to kiss Colin on the head, but Ryan hedges out of the way and beats her to it\n\nColin ends the scene looking VERY confused\n\nA very silly Dubbing. Not the best of these, but still very good. Galen seemed to enjoy herself\n\nRyan: “I said to Colin ‘did you know that was me’, he goes ‘yeah’, I go ‘how’d you know?’, he goes “I know your lips!”\n\nThis is what being an improv duo for 20 odd years does to you\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\nDrew, reading a VERY WORDY first scene: “Besides an athletic event or a criminal getaway, times when people run as fast as they can”\n\nColin: “Maria, before I die, GIVE ME A BIG WET KISS.”\n\nHAAAA. I’d forgotten about that callback\n\nRyan: “….Hoedown?”\n\nHA\n\nBad Segues Following Tragic News Stories:\n\nWayne: “It was a big, big loss. Speaking of big, right after this, The Drew Carey Show-”\n\nBUZZ\n\nWayne, for the third time this show, goes “no, NOT YOU…”\n\n[I’m reminded of Louis CK, creep that he is, and his impression of his local French child molester: “No, NOT-A-YOOU!”]\n\nDrew: “…you are all gonna pay…”\n\nDrew: “Phrases that just don’t sound right when a cheesy announcer says them.”\n\nColin, perfectly: “PLEEEEEASE ACCEPT MY CONDOLENCES!”\n\nRyan: “THAT’S RIGHT, I’LL RESPECT *YOU* IN THE MORNING…”\n\n“Things you shouldn’t do while standing in a police lineup” is a fun one. Chip tries robbing Colin, and Colin just indirectly motions to him. Ryan mouths “YOU’RE DEAD.” Finally, all four come up and Riverdance together, which is a fun visual\n\nNot a bad round of this. Every suggestion had some funny stuff.\n\nGreatest Hits: Songs of Rome\n\nColin: “Hi, we’ll be right back to our documentary on Proctologists in Love, ‘Somebody Up There Likes Me’\n\nHAHAHAHAHA\n\nChip:\n\nRyan: “The city of Rome, the city of Love- is it?”\n\nColin: “it could be”\n\nRyan: “It is now.”\n\nI love their banter in this.\n\nLots of fun puns from Chip and Wayne during the Tex-Mex number. Chip rhymes with ‘Augustus’ and ‘Cesarian section’. There’s a clumsy ending, as Chip starts looking at Wayne, trying to figure out how they’re gonna end the song. They thankfully end on both feet, but there’s a few measures of uncertainty\n\nRyan, screwing with Chip: “You know, when you listen to Tex-Mex, you don’t normally hear a lot of yodeling, but you do on this CD.”\n\nChip, from offscreen: “I TRAVEL A LOT!”\n\n[Is this the Whose Line version of this?]\n\nI love how, of all Offspring songs to emulate, Laura and Linda make this one sound like Original Prankster, which didn’t do too well in the US. I happen to love it, though\n\nWayne…does a great Dexter Holland impression.\n\n“He said, hello man, and he grabbed me on my butt”\n\nWayne even adds a ‘Pretty Fly’ motif to the chorus, which garners some respect points\n\nA very light Greatest Hits, but not bad. Good Chip/Wayne stuff.\n\nProps: Ryan and Drew vs. Colin and Wayne\n\nRyan, using his as an electric chair: “I’m sorry, Phil, the governor didn’t call”\n\nThis one finally gets a reaction out of me, after several very basic props jokes\n\n…and this ends up being the last one\n\nNot a great props\n\nOverall: A very alright show that didn’t do a lot wrong but only really stood out in Let’s Make a Date, and maybe some of Dubbing. Either way, everything in this show worked (except for Props), and nothing really had me too angry at anything. However, this is the kind of basic, sane show that would be more at home in season 2 or 3, and is a lot more rare in the more flagrant, wild hit-or-miss era of Season 5. It’s kind of refreshing to see a basic, alright show like this, in comparison to something like E12, which was a charming failure.\n\nShow Winner: Chip\n\nBest Performer: Ryan Stiles. Had the biggest moves of the show, did the most creative improv work.\n\nWorst Performer: Honestly, Wayne only had LMAD to really impress me, and couldn’t outdo Chip, who had several games of strong work.\n\nBest Game: Let’s Make a Date, obviously.\n\nWorst Game: Props had barely anything new\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Another one from the Kathy Griffin taping. Get ready to hear a lot more of the world’s most annoying audience member laugh, because there’s SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR IT.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, a Season 4 taped episode with Kathy Greenwood that aired in Season 5, but it so good that it should have been aired in Season 4.\n\nSo much fun stuff in this one. Hell, there’s a game in this that made my mom laugh HARD when we watched this together back when it was on ABC Family. And it may not be the one you think.\n\nQuestions Only: The police have been called in to investigate a robbery on a nudist beach\n\nWayne, thinking outside the box, looking down: “AIIIGH! WHERE IS IT?”\n\nKathy: “D’you think I’m paranoid or something?”\n\nWayne, making his character very clear: “where would I put it?”\n\nWayne, trying to remember: “…what time of the day was it?”\n\nKathy: “you don’t even wear a watch???”\n\nKathy and Wayne’s scenes in this game are always really natural\n\nWayne, of course: “Why wear a watch when you have a sundial?”\n\nRyan: “Mind if I say this looks like a misdemeanor?”\n\nHAAAAAAAAAA\n\nRyan and Wayne’s scene is just as funny, with Ryan’s repeated ‘WOULD YA GET UP AGAINST THAT WALL PLEASE’ contrasting with his eventual “…how’s that feel?”\n\nRyan, to entering Colin: “What’s up?”\n\nColin: “…isn’t that obvious?”\n\nOf course, the conversation turns blue:\n\nRyan: “where’d you get something like THAT?”\n\nColin: “d’you know how much this cost me?”\n\nRyan: “what d’you want for it?”\n\nRyan asks if Colin’s an undercover agent\n\nColin: “…do you know I can’t show you my badge right now?”\n\nRyan: [buckles]\n\nBUZZ\n\nKathy, disrobing: “Do I still look like a police officer?”\n\nColin: “…how should I answer that?”\n\nColin starts a question with ‘don’t you think you could lose…’, then realizes he’s gonna insult Kathy, and just aborts it.\n\nRyan ends the scene by finding Wayne’s member\n\nWayne: “Where’d you find it?”\n\nRyan, opening his coat, cracking: “any of these look familiar?”\n\nA RARE QO WITH A BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND END. Everyone had funny stuff to do, everyone had multiple reps, and there was a lot that was really funny here that didn’t involve dick jokes.\n\nLiving Scenery: Colin and Ryan are two guys who are enjoying different activities at a ski resort before going back to their chalet to relax- Kathy and Wayne are props\n\nWayne begins as acting like a chair lift:\n\nAs Ryan places Kathy on the ground as a toboggan, you can hear her crack a little\n\nThen, as Colin uses Wayne as a snowboard, you can hear him trying to muffle his laughter into the carpeting.\n\nWayne comes on making a loud animal noise\n\nColin, reminding me of 5×01: “oh, look, it’s the animatronic bear!”\n\nColin also uses this bear as a cider dispenser, which is a wonderfully bizarre Colin idea\n\nRyan is enjoying using Kathy as a hot tub\n\nColin: “I’m gonna go in the hot tub too-”\n\nRyan: “NOT IN MY HOT TUB, YOU’RE NOT…”\n\nWayne decides to act like another hot tub, and makes blooping noises so Colin can come over\n\nColin: “Mine’s cold, I better turn up the temperature!”\n\nHe then twists knobs on Wayne’s chest. AND WAYNE EMITS A HIGH-PITCHED, OUT-OF-CHARACTER SCREAM. So Colin, after being confused for a second, keeps doing it.\n\nThen, in response to Ryan toweling off with Kathy, Colin uses Wayne to dry off his crotch area. Drew is DYING at everything Colin’s putting Wayne through\n\nIn bringing over firewood, Colin has a SFX reaction of Wayne spontaneously combusting, conveniently\n\nReally funny round of this, even besides the obvious tickling Wayne bit. Colin sure had fun terrorizing Wayne\n\nOf course, Drew wants to talk about it:\n\nDrew: “Hey Wayne, I need to be dried off too, man. Could you dry me off later?”\n\nWayne, shaking his head: “yeeeah, I’ll dry ya off…EW…”\n\nColin: “WAYNE’S REALLY TICKLISH.”\n\nWayne: “…yes, I am ticklish.”\n\nDrew, ominously: “…good to know.”\n\nDrew: “I’m gonna have trouble sleeping tonight…”\n\nWayne: “me too.”\n\nFilm Dub: Ryan, Colin & Kathy- a woman’s car breaks down on the highway\n\nRyan, putting everything in perspective: “I was just driving down the 405 in my TANK and I couldn’t help but notice…”\n\nKathy makes an observation: “Hey, aren’t you George Clooney?”\n\nColin, from the tank, has a line of dialogue, but unfortunately it’s overlayed with the ‘Wayne’s really ticklist’ audio file from a few minutes ago. In lieu of what the actual joke is. They do this again in another film dub in 7 episodes.\n\nRyan says that Colin’s ‘just an upper body’\n\nKathy: “I don’t need an upper body”\n\nRyan has a reaction to this next shot like it came from the gods, sort of like Greg’s reaction to ‘WHO INVITED THE CHICKS’ in Season 7:\n\nRyan: “HE-HEY…WILL THIS DO?”\n\nHA\n\nNot a bad Film Dub, but a bit haphazard in points\n\nParty Quirks: Kathy hosts\n\nWayne – Group of rock stars recording a benefit song to raise money for Colin’s hair transplant\n\nColin – Batman villain “The Tickler” terrorizing everyone in the studio\n\nRyan – A class of kindergarten kids posing for their individual yearbook photos\n\nI still wonder about the serendipity of this quirk being handed to Colin the day he finds out how ticklish Wayne is. Did they switch up the quirks during the break and make it so? Is that why it’s shorter and simpler than the others? Was this REALLY a coincidence? Because it comes off like ‘Wayne has a mission to screw with Colin, and he doesn’t know that Colin has a mission to screw with him’. It’s diabolical\n\nWayne’s…is so funny. SO Funny\n\nWayne, as Stevie Wonder I believe: “Because when you see, when it’s awfully round and shiny\n\nYou might take some from his chest, or maybe from his hiney”\n\nColin, who knows SOMETHING is up, nods at this. Knowing he’s about to get his revenge\n\nOnce Colin’s chyron comes up, the audience knows exactly what’s about to happen, and what the producers have just set Wayne up for. And they can’t wait.\n\nCOLIN GETS TO WAYNE:\n\nThen Colin starts tickling audience members. One even has a Wayne-like high-pitched yelp\n\nHe gets to Drew…and grins, and blows his gloves up.\n\nRyan’s is his usual ‘series of people doing things’, but with cute faces. Once he gets past his first few and takes a drink, he just shrugs to Drew, doing the best he can. Then, Ryan pulls more frightened faces as Colin tickles him\n\nWayne comes back as someone else, possibly someone from Creed: “Every time in a man’s life, got to explain\n\nBecause you need to get some Rogaine”\n\nColin:\n\nDear God\n\nColin: “NEVER AGAIN WILL HE SING.”\n\nWayne’s now hiding behind the chairs. Poor guy.\n\nThe way Kathy guesses “a whole recording session on Colin songs” is so funny. Colin songs. Colin music.\n\nKathy gets Colin easily, and needs more help getting Ryan. Ryan’s just amused at all her missed guesses.\n\nDrew: “And an extra 2000 to the evil tickler. Man, he got you good.”\n\nWayne’s shaking his head.\n\nThen Drew says, to camera, as if it’s an important detail for the audience: “Wayne’s got a tickly butt.”\n\nWayne, sighing: “…YES, I have a tickly butt…”\n\nReally funny PQ, just with the Wayne-Colin stuff. Poor Wayne.\n\nHelping Hands: Ryan, hands by Colin, and Kathy, are a newlywed couple who wake up the morning after their wedding night to have breakfast together\n\nRyan, as Colin holds Kathy: “Maybe after breakfast we can pretend it’s…nighttime AGAIN…”\n\nThe second Ryan uncovers the breakfast platter, he recoils: “looks like it took a bit of time to get here from room service.”\n\nKnowing he’s eventually gonna have to eat the cold sausage, he goes for orange juice first. Already he’s not looking forward to this one.\n\nRyan, using the sausage as a cigar: “Who am I? ‘aghhhh, Gracie and I…”\n\nWILL THIS BE THE MOST OBSCURE REFERENCE OF THE SHOW?\n\nRyan, eating the sausage: “…lemme tell ya something…that is FRESH.”\n\nI love how there’s a fun disconnect between Ryan and Colin that’s already evident. Colin’s using the pancakes as boobs for Ryan, and it takes him 5 seconds to notice. This will be a theme here\n\nColin throws the entire thing of maple syrup on the two pancakes, and then puts his hand on it. The dedication, with Colin. He’s the anti-Marc Summers\n\nRyan: “Lemme tell ya something. Syrup is something that PEOPLE ON TV wouldn’t wanna eat, cause it’d take forever to get off.”\n\nJust giving a little hint to Colin there. Classic.\n\nAnd…Ryan licks Colin’s hands.\n\n[A few weeks ago, Ryan used a shot from this game, specifically this lick, as a way of saying he’s probably screwed if Coronavirus comes his way]\n\nIt’s amusing to see Ryan missing all the fresh fruit Colin’s throwing in his face.\n\nNow, Kathy asks Ryan to pour her some coffee. Already, Colin has a hard time finding it on the table, which isn’t a good sign. Ryan jokingly attempts to pour some directly into Colin’s hand, which elicits gasps.\n\nYou can tell Colin’s emotion just from seeing his hand. He’s scared.\n\nRyan: “i know, I’m not scalding myself again…”\n\nSure enough, Ryan fills a cup with coffee, which overflows over Colin’s hand.\n\nYou just SEE Colin’s hand tense up. And the audience gasps. But Ryan doesn’t notice.\n\nKathy finally gets the cup out of Colin’s hand:\n\nAgain, ALL THE EMOTION THAT COLIN’S GIVEN OFF CAN BE SENSED JUST BY LOOKING AT HIS HAND. HE’S IN PAIN.\n\nRyan: “…that actually is hot, I think.”\n\nI love that Ryan’s not even reacting, though he finally gets the message:\n\nHell, Kathy tries to hand Ryan the OJ again, but Colin’s pained hand causes her to drop it, which works even more with the scene arc\n\nRyan, meanwhile, keeps going:\n\n“MUST PHONE AMBULANCE-”\n\n“…HELLO?”\n\nBUZZ BUZZ\n\nColin, putting away his costume, modestly: “…really is quite hot…”\n\nDrew: “I saw steam coming up from that”\n\nColin, now able to laugh at it: “…yeah!”\n\nDrew: “This is how crazy I am watching that- I was wondering why Ryan wasn’t screaming when the coffee hit his hand…”\n\nRyan: “Well, a week from now, people will ask me ‘did it hurt when you poured coffee on yourself?”\n\nColin: “I had my mouth in his back, screaming…”\n\nRyan, with the best kind of deadpan: “I didn’t feel a thing!”\n\nDrew: “…well LOOKS LIKE THE TICKLER will be out of action for some time…”\n\nColin:\n\nSuch a funny game of this. Even the Kathy-Ryan stuff leading up to the spill was fun, and Ryan was great at trying to avoid the inevitable. But the scalding incident made it even funnier, and I love the wild ending with Ryan overacting, as it just felt like the scene was building to it.\n\nHoedown: Magicians\n\nWayne’s ‘Siegfried and Leroy’ gag is one that Drew was gonna use\n\nDrew, for a rare moment, channels Ryan:\n\n“Hoedowns about magicians, are really hard to do\n\nHard to think of one verse, let alone even two\n\nLet me tell you something that’ll give you a little laugh”\n\n[to Wayne] “if you take my rhyme again I’m gonna saw your ass in half!”\n\nHA. GO DREW.\n\nRyan: “…there goes MINE…THANK YOU, DREW!”\n\nColin: “I am a great magician, I have this special hex\n\nI can take a man, and make him change his sex”\n\n[Heh]\n\n“It really is quite simple, the best trick in the world\n\nI just tickle Wayne’s bum, and he screams like a girl.”\n\nHA. PERFECT. Wayne has to nearly sit down at this one\n\nRyan finally thinks of one:\n\n“Colin wants to be a magician, and I think he should\n\nThe only problem is, he’s not very good\n\nHe really sucks, he’s the worst in the land\n\nHis best trick is pouring hot coffee on his hand!”\n\nEVEN THE HOEDOWN’S GREAT. Everyone’s was really funny.\n\nOverall: A low 10, but still a 10. The entire ending half of this show was rock-solid, from the insane Party Quirks to the well-done, and well-paced Helping Hands, and a killer Hoedown. And that’s not to say the first half is bad, as Questions AND Living Scenery are both great, but Film Dub weighed it down. Both runners worked well and culminated in Hoedown. The desk banter was just loose enough without feeling like last show’s. Wayne, despite being quieter tonight, was great in letting the tickling jokes by without getting too bothered. A really strong, very funny show, and one that really should have come in S4.\n\nShow Winner: Kathy\n\nBest Performer: Colin Mochrie. The Tickler strikes again.\n\nWorst Performer: As per usual, Kathy was relegated to support roles.\n\nBest Game: SO TOUGH. I’m giving it to Helping Hands because it seems the most complete, but PQ came close.\n\nWorst Game: Film Dub was the only okay game in the bunch\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Another show from the same S4 taping, with Chip, that gave us the strong episode 9 of this season.\n\nWe’ve hit another guest star episode, and it comes from a S5 Greg taping we haven’t seen yet, delineated by Colin’s pumpkin shirt.\n\nThis time, they got a guest star that would be perfectly fine with being in on the joke. After all, Jerry Springer’s speciality on his long-running talk show was knowing where the line was between intentional and unintentional humor, and toeing it politely. Jerry Springer knew EXACTLY who he was as a pop culture figure, and to this day is a figure of class despite the trashiness of his show.\n\nSo, getting him for Whose Line? Genius. He’ll be great. And one of the ways they use him tonight is a pretty awesome idea for him, too.\n\nDrew’s opening joke: the points are just like “football in LA. Oh, you don’t have a team here yet, do ya?”\n\nGive them 20 years, they’ll have 2.\n\nHollywood Director: Greg and Ryan are the leaders of rival biker gangs facing off in a dramatic race towards a cliff’s edge in a game of chicken; as they begin, Greg’s girlfriend Wayne rides in, trying to stop them, whatever it takes\n\nI love Greg, thinking he’s starting from the side, slowly edging his way onstage in Wayne’s place. If I remember correctly, this is not the only time he does this during this taping.\n\nBut, after Wayne’s character is revealed, so is the fact that the bud Greg smoked before the show is still in effect:\n\nThe opening detail that Greg’s bike is a lot smaller than Ryan’s works, and gets an audible laugh out of Wayne\n\nI love how wonderfully physical and goofy the first scene is, with Wayne hopping between bikes while Ryan and Greg knife-duel\n\nOn the ‘gremlins’ style, Ryan does the obvious joke of getting into a tiny car, then going “oh, sorry, I thought we were DRIVING Gremlins…”\n\nThe ending style, where everyone ‘loves the feeling of carpet on their skin’, Greg pulls an aroused face he hasn’t pulled since his F&TS scene with Caroline Quentin in UK 8×06\n\nThe scene ends with Greg and Wayne getting intimate on the floor.\n\nWayne: “Sometime tonight, during the show, I’m humpin’ someone in the audience”\n\nRyan: “…so KEEP YOUR TICKET STUBS HANDY”\n\nNot a great HD scene. Felt very fragmented, kind of off. There were good moments, but a lot of it felt underwhelming\n\nNewsflash: Ryan and Greg in the studio, Colin in the field in front of the Jerry Springer show\n\nBetween Drew flubbing a line and blaming it on his mug, and the patter in between scenes, I’ll just say it- it is VERY LOOSE in the studio tonight. More than usual for this season.\n\nGreg, with an original interruption joke: “So she’s tickling me, and I go…’look, the truck driver can SEE us…”\n\nThe sight of a grown man in women’s undergarments prancing around the Springer stage gets the audience going. I’m not capping that.\n\nAnother clip, little person wrestling, hasn’t aged well. As a lot of Springer stuff has, I reckon.\n\nOf course, the second they show a guy with fish duct-taped to his body, the audience goes crazy. And Ryan…doesn’t know what to say\n\nThe next thing to make the audience squirm is a lady taking out her dentures. Drew even writhes in his seat\n\nColin, after several minutes of this, deadpan: “…this is amazing, isn’t it?”\n\nThere’s even a cutaway to Wayne, who’s standing and shaking his head\n\nA pretty okay Newsflash, but the stuff on the tape did more than Colin could do. He just seemed confused\n\nRyan explains the fish fetish guy, and the context. “Not that *I* watch it, but I saw a clip of it…”\n\nSong Styles: Wayne sings a Gospel tune to Jerry Springer\n\nSure enough, the former mayor of Cincinnati, which is odd because Drew’s big into a DIFFERENT Ohio city, seems pretty happy to be here\n\nJust…just Jerry being there, and Wayne having to sing to him, gets both of them cracking up. Again, the energy in this studio is so wild tonight\n\nSure enough, Wayne cracks one more time, just going, in disbelief, “it’s Jerry Springer!”\n\nI love that the book the audience is opening up, according to Wayne, is “Jerry 3:81 Syndicated”\n\nWayne: “that if thou…live in the park of the trailer…thou shalt go to the promised land which is the Circle K”\n\nThen, as Wayne dances around, he turns to the chairs to hide how excited he is to be singing to Jerry Springer. This is HUGE for Wayne\n\nWayne: “I’ve seen a 550 pound woman in a g-string\n\nNow who in their right mind would want to see such a thing?”\n\nHis lyrics in this one are really well-defined, and he’s got a fun angle on this\n\nThen, as he lists all the people that come on his show, he does a callback and lists “one guy who would sleep with fish!”\n\nWayne, adding in: “and there was even a breakdancing group but they couldn’t keep a beat”\n\nThen, after a “I’mma beat her ass cause she is a ho” line from Wayne…he turns to the chairs once again. Trying to hide his crack-ups, cause this is THE GUY.\n\nWayne, cracking: “I think the censors said no, Jerry…”\n\nWayne, in his final big revue line, where he goes into detail about where he’s at at 2 am when the shows on, and who’s on his show, including “the big bald guy, Steve, I really like him…”, he’s just proving how appreciative he is that Jerry came on\n\nA REALLY STRONG SONG FROM WAYNE. He should be commended. So much love and passion in there, and such great lyrics. Jerry seemed to really like it, too\n\nWayne starts saying he shouldn’t have said ‘ass’ and ‘ho’ in that\n\nRyan, sarcastically: “I think Jerry was SHOCKED.”\n\nDaytime Talk Show: Little Red Riding Hood\n\nJerry hosts, Ryan and Colin are guests, and Wayne and Greg are in the audience\n\nTHIS is a genius idea. Not only bringing back Daytime Talk Show, which was an awesome game on the UK version AND in Season 1, but getting Jerry to do some improv and host the show. now, I’m not sure how good his improv is gonna be, but…this is a pretty fun move, and proof the producers were really putting their heads together with ways to make these guest star shows fun.\n\nJerry throws it to Ryan, not trying too hard with improv. Ryan casts himself as the wolf, and “before we start, can I rub Drew’s head?”\n\nJerry, looking at Drew: “…yeah”\n\nJerry, to Ryan: “…you wanna rub the other one”, motioning to Colin\n\nColin: “No. I DON’T RUB HEADS, IT WAS JUST A PHASE.”\n\nRyan cracks for a moment [maybe due to the Springer-ness of it all], during an explanation: “I was waiting for Red to uh, well, how do I put this…have a little snack…”\n\nRyan FINALLY casts Colin as Red Riding Hood, as we went on for a bit without knowing who he was\n\nColin: “I was violated in so many ways….HE CRUMBLED MY GOODIES.”\n\nRyan explains that every day Colin passes through with a basket full of “things wolves like”\n\nColin: “MUFFINS. WHO KNEW THAT WOLVES LIKE MUFFINS?”\n\nRyan, perfect Springer logic: “So I made a little mistake…killed her grandmother, pretended to be her.”\n\nColin: “HE DEVOURED MY GRANDMOTHER. HE ACTUALLY ATE HER UP.”\n\nRyan: “AT NO TIME DID SHE SAY ‘NO'”\n\nThat’s a good line\n\nJerry makes a decision to cut Wayne off mid-question after he insults Jerry. Which is a choice.\n\nGreg, sporting a New York Jew accent: “I AM RED RIDING HOOD’S GRANDFATHER, AND I AM A LITTLE T’D OFF ABOUT THIS”\n\nMan, he sounds exactly like the candidate that he blocks people on twitter for supporting nowadays…\n\nGreg: “I COME HOME, I FIND MY WIFE INSIDE THE WOLF, AND THERE’S NO MUFFINS IN THE HOUSE.”\n\nPERFECT SIDELINE SUPPORT. Finding the funny thing, the muffins, and driving home Ryan as the mark. Greg’s a pro at this\n\nRyan: “HEY, YA WANNA TELL HER?” [opens mouth]\n\nI missed this game\n\nI kinda love Jerry’s…annoyance at Wayne and Greg coming downstage, almost like he’s on the show. His improv isn’t perfect, but he gets EXACTLY what this game’s supposed to be. He’s just not as strong a proctor as Brad or Greg when they play\n\nJerry comes forward to give his final thought.\n\nRyan, being tackled by Wayne: “WHERE’S YOUR SECURITY, JERRY?”\n\nA pretty fun game of this. Not perfect, and it’d be cool if Greg hosted like old times, but the Springer quality shone through, and all 4 gave a lot of effort to make this fun, with emphasis going to Ryan and Greg.\n\nThree-Headed Broadway Star: Wayne, Ryan and JERRY sing ‘I Dream About Your Yarmulke’ to Shannon\n\nNo Drew game, just another guest game.\n\nThe guy who yelled out ‘yarmulke’ did so at a record speed for this game. Like, ZOOMED OUT.\n\nAlready, Jerry’s throwing on a fake New York Jew accent.\n\nI love Ryan accidentally throwing the verse into a loop and making himself rhyme with ‘fool’, which makes him give a look.\n\nWayne, who’s drawn himself into a corner, takes an extra measure and just says ‘tuchus’\n\nYeah, Wayne’s taking a lot of pauses between lines, as this one’s not going anywhere. Not Jerry’s fault, he’s got the hang of the game. It’s just hard to sing about yarmulkes.\n\nJerry starts messing up, taking too much of a pause, and doing two words at one point\n\nOverall, this one was…fine. Kinda wonky. But Jerry gave his all.\n\nOverall: All over the place, this one. Some games were great, like Song Styles and Daytime Talk Show. Some games were duds, like 3HBS and Director. Some games, like Newsflash, were just kinda there. And the energy in the room was just…odd. This felt looser than usual, in a way that was more noticeable than ever. Jerry was a fine guest, and the show was well-tailored to him, but he had his share of slip-ups. So…this is an alright show, but just…weirdly inconsistent. And just plain weird in general.\n\nShow Winner: Jerry\n\nBest Performer: Wayne Brady. Song Styles sealed it for me, but he had a lot to do all night.\n\nWorst Performer: Greg, I guess? He was kind of present, but left behind by the rest.\n\nBest Game: Song Styles. Wayne crafted this one insanely well.\n\nWorst Game: Three-Headed fell flat, despite their best efforts.\n\nGuest Star Rating: 8/10. Jerry was happy to be there, and boosted games, even if his improv skills need a bit of work.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: A look at the last of the new, uncovered S4 Kathy Greenwood tapings. This is definitely a ‘best foot forward’ show, because there’s a truly great runner, two if you really think about it, involving, of all things, Wayne’s ass.\n\nComing off a show where the producers wanted to save better material for other shows despite the PRESENCE of said better material, we get a similar case. The 508 taping has already seen two shows with guest stars, and we get one at the end of this season that’s a classic. So this show being very standard is surprising.\n\n[suddenly remembers what happens in Greatest Hits]\n\n…..OH YEEEAHHHH….\n\nAlright, I guess this’ll be a fun one after all..\n\nQuestions with Wigs: scandal erupts at a wedding\n\nA variation on Questions Only, given a hat component for more obvious character work. While this takes away the subtle character improv of the game’s past, it’d give easier laughs for future playings, which would lead into the Aisha version\n\nWayne, within seconds of putting on a long black wig, cracks up.\n\nBrad: “Did I see you kissing the bride earlier?”\n\nWayne: “Do you have video?”\n\nBrad, looking right at Drew: “…if I did would that be SCANDALOUS?”\n\nWayne, grabbing Brad’s hand: “would you take me at the altar?”\n\nBrad, cracking: “…is this some sort of devil worship?”\n\nThe laughs from this are a lot closer to the ground than usual for this game\n\nColin comes on in a headbanded middle-aged woman wig\n\nRyan: “…do you know who you look like with hair?”\n\nColin: “who would that be?”\n\nRyan: [breaks]\n\nBUZZ\n\nBrad comes in with a Gwen Stefani wig\n\nColin: “Did you hear what happened?”\n\nBrad: “Would you believe me if I said ‘no doubt’?”\n\nBrad: “Are you wearing your Daisy Dukes, Ellie Mae?”\n\nWayne: “Does a thong count as a Daisy Duke?”\n\nBrad: “…is there a thong in your heart?”\n\nAUDIBLE GROANS FROM THE AUDIENCE.\n\nWayne, turning around: ‘would you call THIS my heart?”\n\nRyan, reprising his impression of Bernie from Room 222: “…was’happenin?”\n\nA very silly game with a few good runs, but not as good as most QO rounds.\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\nThis one reuses the ‘I’ve got a game called SFAH’ intro from 4×24\n\n“If Tarzan appeared in other shows” is a good round of one-character jokes, which is par for the course in S5, as there are a lot of similar rounds\n\nRyan, to camera: “Me want boy go.”\n\nAnd Drew asks him to explain his Survivor joke, which may have been a hint that Survivor was just reaching its pop culture expiry date\n\nAnd, owing back to E10:\n\nRyan: “Hey, that great album. Me borrow for the weekend?”\n\nWayne: “No, sorry brother, you got get your OWN!”\n\nHaaaaaah. Even Ryan breaks at that\n\n“Unusual phrases to teach in an ESL class” has some good ones\n\nBrad, referencing a runner that hasn’t debuted yet: “repeat after me- GO BEAVER GO.”\n\nRyan: “REPETE. ‘USE YOUR BLINKER, DICKHEAD.'”\n\nDrew: “Strange comments for your doctor to make after ‘turn your head and cough'”\n\nRyan: “….would you like to go out to dinner sometime?”\n\nColin: “…alright, now bend over and sneeze.”\n\n[I always loved this one as a kid]\n\nWayne ends with a ‘ball clacking device’ gag, which is a pretty fun one.\n\nSolid SFAH. Short, but made up for it with some really good suggestions\n\nParty Quirks: Brad hosts\n\nWayne – Host’s repulsive landlady looking for excuses to interrupt the party so she can hit on everyone\n\nColin – Safari guide who thinks people are dangerous wild animals who must be wrestled into submission\n\nRyan – Uninhibited social director at a nudist camp trying to get everyone to join in the activities\n\nBrad, to a very touchy-feely Wayne: “…try the possum dip”\n\nWayne and Colin’s work really well- Colin starts wrestling Wayne, and Wayne takes this as a pass, so he’s really into it\n\nRyan, hands behind his back: “I have to say, I LOVE the sound of your doorbell”\n\n[…he’s come as himself]\n\nRyan: “Sorry I’m late, must be [checks self-sundial] THREE-O-CLOCK”\n\nAnd of course, THIS ONE works well for Wayne as well\n\nHE BROKE RYAN. AMAZING\n\nBrad: “Here, lemme take off your coat”\n\nRyan, confused: “…I wasn’t aware I was wearing one…”\n\nRyan, as Colin wrestles him: “OHHH, THIS WASN’T PLANNED.”\n\nRyan’s killing me here, as is everyone’s reactions to him\n\nAnd then Ryan starts doing jumprope. Ohhh man.\n\nColin: “Stay close! Sometimes the tongue takes you by surprise”\n\nRyan: “I WISH!”\n\nHAAAAAA\n\nWayne has to turn around he’s laughing so hard\n\nA pretty alright PQ, even if Ryan’s mostly lifted it for me.\n\nGreatest Hits: Songs of the Western\n\nOh boy. This is one that sent shockwaves through every taping that filmed this same weekend.\n\nColin: “Hi, we’ll be back to a Very Brady Bris in just a second.”\n\nRyan cracks. Yes, this filmed after Dubbing, I reckon\n\nI love the goofy, tacky western lines Colin and Ryan are pulling to start\n\nI love the unfitting cheeriness of Brad and Wayne’s Osmonds number\n\nWayne, holding in laughter: “If you get shot in the butt, man it’s gonna sting…”\n\nRyan: “You know, one of the reasons our CD set is so cheap is because only TWO Osmonds sing on that cut…”\n\nJust barely meta enough\n\nColin: “We cut out about 50 of them…”\n\nAND SO…\n\nRyan: “Here’s a little riddle for ya. What kind of bird always says the name of our next band?”\n\nThe thing is…both of them know the styles. They know what’s on the cards, and they know what the musicians and performers are ready for them. So Colin knows he has to get to The Who somehow, because that’s the band they’re doing. However, Colin knows he CANNOT do that, because his character’s ALWAYS supposed to get Ryan’s setups wrong. This has gone back to Season 2. Every ‘what comes to mind’ gag has to be done wrong. So Colin has to get this one wrong as well\n\nColin: “Well…I guess a TERN?”\n\nThis is the first level of Ryan laughter. He’s caught off guard in a way only Colin can catch him off guard. So he’s on edge.\n\nColin, however, keeps going: “…an ARCTIC TERN?”\n\nRyan, playing devil’s advocate: “…and what sound does an arctic tern make?”\n\nColin winds up, and: “……BACKSTREETBOOOYSS!”\n\nAnd thus:\n\nRyan has not laughed this hard since roughly the Tapioca incident.\n\nColin, LIKE THE TAPIOCA INCIDENT, spikes the camera here:\n\nHE KNOWS WHAT HE’S DONE.\n\nRyan, in mid sobs almost: “NOOOO..”\n\n[To quote another Fall 2001 taping, SCREEEEECH]\n\nCOLIN KEEPS CHECKING THE CAMERA:\n\nHe’s amused as hell that he got Ryan. And now he just wants the show to keep rolling.\n\nRyan, beginning to compose himself: “NO, COL. THAT’S WRONG.”\n\nColin: “Well, why don’t you tell us what’s right?”\n\nBrad:\n\nThey EVENTUALLY get to the Who number, and Ryan just gives a single frustrated look at Colin before they cut away\n\nBrad and Wayne go to their usual roles as the Who- Brad does Roger Daltrey, Wayne does Pete Townshend doing the refrain. There’s a very fun, energetic number here, and Wayne progressively has more fun with the refrains as they go along\n\nThe ending’s even funny. Wayne smashes his guitar. Brad begins to, then quietly puts his guitar away…only for Wayne to smash it anyway. Laura adds a well-timed piano multi-key hit to account for the bang\n\nColin waits for a lull in banter to get his revenge: “Hey…what sound does a blackbird make?”\n\nRyan:\n\n[“…oh no”]\n\nRyan: “i have no idea.”\n\nColin, birdlike: “O-PER-A”\n\nWayne:\n\nFriggin love that Wayne move. Out of NOWHERE\n\nColin screws with Brad and Wayne a little and has them do an Opera song, but…them doing vocal warmups\n\nBrad, as part of his vocal warmup, gargles water from their glasses from the seats.\n\nWayne, for real, has to keep himself from choking on the water\n\nSo Brad keeps gargling. Into the bridge. Which keeps Wayne laughing\n\nRight at the end, as Brad does another gargled note, he literally sprays the water in his mouth all over the floor, and he and Wayne erupt in laughter. MAN.\n\nLegendary game. Aside from that classic Ryan-Colin moment, Wayne and Brad were also delivering fun stuff, especially that ending moment, which was just silly enough to work.\n\nIrish Drinking Song: Marriage\n\nIn the first verse, there’s a strong enough story established: the protagonist loves his wife, but she gets on his nerves\n\nRyan, summing it up: “I love her, I’m a sap”\n\nRyan: “She doesn’t come around me”\n\nWayne, making a suggestive motion: “She doesn’t let me TOUCH”\n\nRyan: “I’m by myself all day”\n\nWayne: “MRS. BRADY WOULDN’T BE THAT WAY.”\n\nMan, Florence isn’t even in this one and she’s bringing out the best in everybody\n\nRyan makes Drew rhyme a punchline with ‘Japan’\n\nWayne: “I’ll meet myself a Geisha girl”\n\nDrew, reaching: “…and….marry my right hand.”\n\nWAYNE:\n\nHE’S SHOCKED\n\nDrew: “I’ll probably die with her.”\n\nColin: “and then we both will fart!”\n\nJust enough. I’ve been saying that a lot this show, but just enough.\n\nRyan’s gone. Drew’s gone. Wayne’s gone. Drew and Wayne try to come back for the refrain, but are still losing it. Poor Ryan.\n\nA solid IDS, that felt compact enough and fun enough despite not being an overwhelmingly hysterical one. Everybody had fun lines, the ending punchline worked. What else could you ask for?\n\nOverall: A surprisingly good show, even though on the surface it just seems like it’ll be just Greatest Hits carrying it. SFAH is a good one, Questions sets the ground work for future Questions playings, and IDS is a lawful, great playing without much gross-out work. Greatest Hits is still pretty classic though, and there’s a lot more going on there than just the Arctic Tern bit. Despite not being as strong as the Florence show, it’s still a pretty nice one, and has some good renegade links to other runners.\n\nShow Winner: Brad\n\nBest Performer: Wayne Brady! YEAH, THAT’S RIGHT. He had great moves in every game tonight, and I’m proud of giving him this over Colin who made the most memorable move. Also, Wayne had the most ‘oh my god’ reactions in things he may have not been the center of, and I paid attention to that.\n\nWorst Performer: Ryan Stiles. A tough one, I know, but Ryan’s best work tonight was in Party Quirks, and laughing in the last two games.\n\nBest Game: Greatest Hits. So damn good. Even around the Arctic Tern bit.\n\nWorst Game: Party Quirks, aside from Ryan, is very muted by comparison\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: I guess it has been a while since our last Guest Star episode. So here’s a new one, kicking off a new Greg taping from S5. Thankfully this guest star is someone who’s fully alright with being in on the joke\n\nThis episode brings us a new taping, a S5 one featuring Greg Proops, one of three he did during the fall 2001 sessions. In 7 shows, we get a classic from this taping. In 10, we get a second classic from this taping. If this show pales in comparison to those, blame the glut of content in general from this taping.\n\nLet’s Make a Date: Greg hosts\n\nWayne – Stage hypnotist who uses his butt to hypnotize people\n\nColin – Abrasive coach looking for new members to train for his all-women wrestling team\n\nRyan – Secretly setting up an erotic 24-hour webcam on stage and is surreptitiously trying to include the others in his broadcast\n\nWayne, with an eyebrow raised, already has the audience on his side.\n\nWayne’s subtle butt-shaking is enough to get the audience going crazy…and to elicit an impressed expression from Colin\n\nColin just picks two blonde ladies out of the audience and attempts to wrestle them. It’s mildly amusing\n\nColin keeping the girls onstage works well with Ryan’s, who starts eyeing them once his chyron comes up for the audience\n\nI also love the subtle stiff-arm Colin gives to Ryan once he starts leaning on one of the girls.\n\nThen, as there’s no avoiding it, Ryan sets a camera up under Wayne’s chair. Because of course.\n\nThen, as Wayne starts back up again, Ryan takes his camera and tries following him around without being too obvious\n\nWayne even brings someone down while shaking his ass, and the audience member he picks cannot, for the life of her, stop laughing. Man, if she’s a fan of dying laughing, she picked the right Whose Line taping\n\nThen, as Wayne tries hypnotizing her, Colin grabs her and tries auditioning her for the team. It’s rare when ALL THREE players can use the audience like this\n\nRyan is also still dragging around cameras, first to the audience members, and then…under Drew’s desk. Drew, playing along, lifts his leg up from behind the desk. Ryan, watching the feed, is amazed…and stabs his eyes out.\n\nGreg gets Wayne’s basically word-for-word.\n\nGreg: “At first I thought Colin was you, of course”\n\nDrew:\n\nGreg: “And THEN I THOUGHT *RYAN* was you…”\n\nDrew, helping Greg: “What kind of places to you go to get 24-hour cameras in action.”\n\nGreg: “…do *I* go???…there’s a little place in Tijuana…”\n\nDrew tries a ‘keyboard’ motion\n\nGreg, confused: “…oh, a…piano bar…”\n\nNot a bad LMAD, but a lot of the humor came from subtleties rather than dialogue\n\nDrew: “I’m gonna give a thousand dollars to- thousand POINTS that is-”\n\nThe whole audience ‘AWWWW’s\n\nRyan: “YOU SAID DOLLARS.”\n\nRyan, after Drew awards points to Wayne’s ass: “Hey Wayne, can I borrow that butt for the weekend?”\n\nWayne, of course: “Sorry, my brother, you gots to get your own…”\n\nScene to Rap: Top Gun\n\nOh GOD, I wasn’t looking forward to this one returning\n\nWayne has a fun line up front: “I’m not Tom Cruise, cause I’m darker and taller…”\n\nWayne does set up Ryan, saying “here comes one big tall blue Russkie”\n\nThis owes back to the ‘cowboy shirt’ runner we’ll encounter in a few shows\n\nRyan gets himself out of this early, coming in as a duck and landing on the windshield, so he doesn’t have to do much more.\n\nColin, also flapping: “Look at me, I’m here with you\n\nI’ve got no character…boo-hoo.”\n\n[Ryan, in the back, cracks at this]\n\nWayne: “I thought he was a bird, but then oh snap\n\nCause everybody knows Canadians can’t rap”\n\n[Aubrey Graham would beg to differ]\n\nThere’s a fun ending where Colin turns out to be Superman and shoots them down. There’s a moment where the camera’s on Ryan to do another line, he opens his mouth…and Drew buzzes. So he shrugs towards the camera. It’s always been a fun moment for me.\n\nA very alright Scene to Rap, but not as bad as these usually are.\n\nSound Effects: Ryan and Colin are two gung-ho astronauts who take off on a rescue mission to save an international space station orbiting Mars, but when they get there they discover that the station has been taken over by deadly aliens\n\nColin starts by taking the scene description very literally: “GUNG-HO!”\n\nI kind of find it funny that, in response to Ryan’s usual naming of Phillip, Colin responds by naming Ryan ‘Terence’. Terrence and Phillip.\n\nBLAME CANADAAAA, BLAME CANADAAA…\n\nRyan puts on his helmet, and Debra does a ‘JHHHOOOP’\n\nRyan: “My sucks EVERY BIT OF AIR OUT.”\n\nOnce they get on the elevator, Ryan waits for the car to land when suddenly Debra emits a HUGE POWERING-UP NOISE\n\nAnd they play it perfectly, like the elevator’s traveling the speed of sound.\n\nRyan eases into the space capsule\n\nDebra: “RUUAAARR.”\n\nRyan clutches his stomach: “That tang’s catching up to me…”\n\nRyan: “HANG ON, I THINK I HEAR THE COUNTDOWN”\n\n“….”\n\nColin: “You must have really good ears”\n\nKarina: “ONE….TWO…”\n\nRyan, cracking: “THEY’RE STARTING AT ONE. WE’RE GONNA BE HERE ALL DAY.”\n\nThe eventual takeoff noises the ladies make are lawfully hysterical. These two SFX ladies are both really good at this, and are actually doing decent SFX that are also really damn funny. It’s not like most cases where they just…don’t do it.\n\nColin suggests they put on their jetpacks as Debra makes a ‘fssssh’ noise\n\nRyan: “…apparently mine just took off by itself…”\n\nKarina: “WOOOOOOO”\n\nColin: “Oh, ghosts!”\n\n[Greg loves this move]\n\nThe ladies also crack everybody up with their jetpack noises. They just keep going, and getting louder.\n\nRyan, suddenly: “STOP!”\n\n[The force of this always makes me laugh]\n\nColin angrily chucks the jetpack away, and Ryan and Colin are left floating around, angry. It’s such a silly moment\n\nColin, to Ryan, getting out his raygun: “You expecting trouble?”\n\nRyan: “You never know out here…WHO KNEW THERE’D BE GHOSTS?”\n\nRyan prompts one of the alien creatures to talk, and one of the ladies emits an indecipherable noise\n\nColin mimes pulling out his translator book. That’s a fun move\n\nSuch a silly SFX. Both effects people were in great moods, and thankfully Ryan and Colin didn’t screw with them too much. So many goofy moments and sounds.\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\nEnding a long-term relationship in song:\n\nColin: ‘…you are DEAD TO ME…NOTHING BUT SCUMMM\n\nWhen I look in your eyes…I GET INFLAMATION OF THE BUMMMM…\n\nYOU MAKE ME FEEL PUTRID…I HATE THE-”\n\nRyan:\n\nDrew: “Things you’ve always wanted to say to the audience at home.”\n\nColin: “THEY’RE ALL WEARING TOUPEES.”\n\nThe ‘when a kiss is completely out of hand’ one is kinda basic, but I love Colin’s quick kiss on Wayne in a ‘your kid’s beating up my kid’ one.\n\nColin, back at the step: “Can we get women on the show?”\n\nPerhaps the Chyna kiss was a direct response to this\n\nRyan’s ‘unusual ways for an optometrist to test your vision’ one is a personal favorite:\n\nAnother thin SFAH\n\nWorld’s Worst: Psychiatrist\n\nColin, to someone who isn’t there: ‘…I was just gonna tell him….I KNOW!”\n\nRyan: “please, sit down”\n\nColin: “PENIS ENVY? Look at THIS…”\n\nNot a lot going on here.\n\nOverall: Very basic. Let’s Make a Date and Sound Effects were the standouts, everything else was very okay. No sign of other runners, which honestly hurts this one more. Just a lot of unconnected stuff lying around, which isn’t the best foot forward for a monolithic taping like this one.\n\nShow Winner: Wayne\n\nBest Performer: Colin had the best lines.\n\nWorst Performer: Greg wasn’t very present here.\n\nBest Game: Sound Effects made me laugh the hardest\n\nWorst Game: World’s Worst was limp.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Ironically, another show that tries to be boilerplate while having two sister shows that are insanely good. This is a dispatch from the Florence Henderson taping, and the third show we’re getting from the 508 show featuring Brad Sherwood. And it’s…alright.\n\nSo. I am still alive.\n\nUsually when I have an impromptu hiatus on here, it’s because of something silly like work or something like that. Here, my impromptu hiatus was thanks to a major pandemic sweeping the country and having me completely rehaul my worldview for several days. So that’s been fun.\n\nOf course, a great pick-me-up, like any time, is watching Whose Line, and that’s what I intend to do. We’re within 12 of two classics, and while I’m not sure how soon until we get to them, I intend to plow through some S5 ones this week. Y’all deserve it.\n\nThis is a new Season 4 taping that was pushed entirely to S5, featuring Chip Esten. Lots of underrated stuff happened at this taping. Including stuff that’s in this episode.\n\nAfter Drew’s surprisingly good opening joke, “the points are just like steak sauce in India”, Ryan remarks “SOMEBODY’s been working OVERTIME…”\n\nSuperheroes: There’s a Dead Possum in Colin’s Parking Spot!\n\nColin: STINKY MAN!!!!\n\nRyan – Giggling Nipple-Tweak Man\n\nChip – Captain Luau\n\nWayne – Temper Tantrum Kid\n\nFirst off, UPROARIOUS audience response to start the game. I feel like Keith wasn’t happy with the original response, so he had them do it again, bigger.\n\nDrew: “One of my favorite guys in the whole wide world, Colin Mochrie, is gonna start…you’ll never meet a nicer man…”\n\nAnd then he asks for the superhero suggestion…\n\nAudience Member: “STINKY MAN.”\n\nAnother underrated audience member: “Rogaine Man!”\n\nColin: [walks towards the audience scornfully]\n\nRyan: “I love that, ‘couldn’t be a nicer guy in the whole wide world-‘ ‘STINKY MAN!!!””\n\nI caught that juxtaposition, and I’m glad someone else did too\n\nI also love Ryan’s ‘can’t help ya’ shrug once the audience member suggests ‘dead possum in your parking spot’\n\nColin: [flexes, then] “…I don’t remember that plant being dead…”\n\nHe then sniffs his armpit and nearly faints\n\nColin: “Oh, I had my stench-beam on high…”\n\nYeah, he’s got this\n\nI also love that Colin indirectly causes the crisis, by killing the possum right at his parking spot: “WHERE WILL I PUT THE STINKMOBILE?”\n\nRyan has another great variation: he stays by the door, doesn’t enter, and says ‘sorry I’m late’ like he’s trying not to breathe\n\nColin: “Come on in!”\n\nRyan: “I don’t want to!”\n\nI kinda love that Ryan has Colin repeat the ‘nipple tweak’ part, as he didn’t get it for some reason, before going into it\n\nRyan: “How d’you know it’s dead? It’s a possum!”\n\nColin: [raises armpit]\n\nChip immediately draws back once Ryan names him, because it comes with a free nipple tweak.\n\nChip, barely holding it together: “…Aloha…”\n\nI love how Chip does some dancing, and then goes to roast a pig\n\nWayne, being himself: “Sorry I’m late- DAAAAAYUM.”\n\nWayne’s energy with his quirk is well-appreciated, and a great contrast to Ryan’s emotion. It’s even funnier when Colin shuts him up by hugging him close to the pits.\n\nWayne does end up leaving without solving the crisis. Like usual.\n\nColin: “Wow, his temper-tantrum woke up the possum.”\n\nMeanwhile, Ryan’s cracking up trying to go back to Chip’s nipples\n\nChip, to Ryan: “One more time for the road!”\n\nColin ends with a wonderfully disgusting ending line: “Oh, time for some beans!”\n\nReally good round of Superheroes. Not exactly highbrow, but enough silliness and teamwork to keep me entertained\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\nDrew: [sigh] “disturbing people to get a lap-dance from.”\n\nWayne:\n\nUnfortunate Times to Sneeze\n\nWayne: “…if you’d please hand me the mohel”\n\nHA\n\nI also like him bringing this back for ‘jobs where you shouldn’t kid around’\n\nJobs where you shouldn’t kid around:\n\nColin, very monotone: “You owe 50,000 in back-taxes. Ha. Ha.”\n\n“The Munchkins: What are they doing now?”\n\nRyan: “eh, looks like you need a new muffler…”\n\nRyan: “You forgot to give points, Mr. Carey…”\n\nBUZZ BUZZ BUZZ\n\nDrew: “Annnnd 1000 points to Ryan, who’s gonna get his ass kicked by a fat guy after the show…”\n\nVery meh SFAH. Not a ton going on.\n\nStand Sit Lie: Ryan is a woman giving birth, Colin is the nervous husband, and Wayne is the flirtatious midwife\n\nMy, we haven’t seen this once since 2×01, Chip’s first taping in the US\n\nI love that for once RYAN plays the woman, not Colin. AND WAYNE plays one as well.\n\nI love that Wayne starts on the table\n\nRyan: “I’M CROWNING.”\n\nWayne: “YES, I WIN!”\n\nThe switching motions is great here, because everyone keeps forgetting that someone needs to lay down, and Colin always ends up just falling on the floor to keep the three. He even gets up when it looks like Wayne’s gonna lay down, but he doesn’t, and Colin lays back down on the floor\n\nRyan, even on the table, screws with Colin- he lays down, but the second he sees Colin standing back up, he sits up, and Colin has to go down again. This is why Ryan’s so good at this game\n\nIt just turns into Colin doing various motions, even swimming, while on the floor\n\nWayne: “You are the owner of-”\n\nColin, briefly losing composure: “the OWNER? You’re not really a midwife, are you?”\n\nWayne: “No, I used to be a used car salesman!”\n\nWayne gets behind Ryan for the chair, but Ryan doesn’t know this, so he sits down on top of Wayne\n\nRyan: “HEYYY…GIVE ME A WEEK, WILL YA?”\n\nHAAAAA. That’s a fun ending line.\n\nReally good game of this. Not QUITE the caliber of the ‘who gets the table’ UK playings, but still really fun, and with good dialogue as well\n\nDrew, after commercial: “[this is] the show that gives Colin Mochrie a reason to live.”\n\nParty Quirks: Chip hosts\n\nWayne – Various acts getting booed off the stage during amateur night at the Apollo\n\nColin – Bomb squad member who received a tip that there are bombs in people’s pants\n\nRyan – Series of ugly undersea creatures swimming up to investigate the cameras\n\nChip, on the phone: “Nono, they come over, I guess who they are, they go home”\n\nI love how meta he can be occasionally\n\nI love how the audience plays along by booing Wayne any chance they get. One guy even does it before he does anything\n\nI also love Wayne’s into-it “all-riiiiight” when he enters again. Very Common-esque\n\nColin…oh, man:\n\nChip: “…are you the entertainment, cause I didn’t want you to come for another hour…”\n\nColin: “Alright, you’re clean-”\n\nChip: “Not anymore…”\n\nColin: “QUIET.”\n\nColin then goes over to Wayne, saying ‘this is where they usually put them’\n\nIn the taping chronology, this one comes 2 tapings after the ‘Wayne’s got a tickly butt’ taping. So Colin knew about Wayne’s ticklishness when he goes and puts his hands in his back pockets.\n\nColin: “I’M GONNA HAVE TO GO IN THERE.”\n\nRyan’s…is a favorite mine. It’s a peak ‘Ryan coming in as several different animals’ one, but with tons more silliness:\n\nSo…my favorite Ryan trick comes right as Chip is working on Wayne:\n\nRyan’s out of shot with Colin as Wayne does his thing. He knows this. He is aware of how out-of-shot he is. So he decides to surprise the camera, knowing Wayne’s about to be guessed:\n\nYOU CAN SEE HIM DUCK UNDER THE CAMERA HERE, as Chip’s guessing Wayne correctly. He’s getting into position:\n\nAND THEN. AND THEN. AND GENTLEMEN AND THEN:\n\nIt gets funnier:\n\nColin: “oh my god…RED BUTTOCK-BLUE BUTTOCK…”\n\nThere’s a moment where Colin and Chip nearly break, realizing what he’s about to do to Ryan. Ryan even looks back, making sure everything’s okay.\n\nAND THEN:\n\nBOOM. THE TIMING. THE UPWARD MOTION. RYAN TRYING HIS HARDEST NOT TO LAUGH. ALL AT ONCE. My gosh\n\nDear god, this is like the newspaper photo\n\nThen, after Chip guesses Colin, Ryan’s rebuttal:\n\nPFFFFF\n\nChip guesses Ryan with help from Drew\n\nSUCH a funny PQ. So much going on, all three quirks made me laugh, and so many funny bits of performers converging onto each other. How Ryan held it in when Colin put his hand down his pants, I have no idea.\n\nDrew ends PQ, gives everyone points, and then…\n\n[hack]\n\nRyan: “HE’S CHOKING ON A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL!”\n\nHe confirms he “almost choked to death on an altoid”\n\nRyan: “Well, they ARE curiously strong…”\n\nha\n\nDrew: “…HA HA, HE ALMOST DIED…”\n\nThis gets the biggest reaction. Like Colin, it’s funnier when Drew gets hurt for some reason.\n\nShow Stopping Number: Ryan, Colin and Wayne work in a factory\n\nColin wisely sets up what kind of factory this is right from the start: “you know, I thought the swiss cheese CAME with holes…”\n\nColin’s wide-eyed look once the buzz happens is fantastic\n\nColin’s song: “CHEESE. IS OUR LIFE.\n\nI WISH I COULD MAKE IT MY WIFE.\n\nI’D TAKE IT TO BED. WE’D SLEEP UNTIL WE’RE DEAD.\n\nOH BOY I LOVE CHEESE.”\n\n…Colin’s just so good at these goofy songs in this game\n\nRyan, in song: “Didn’t get the suggestion, we almost didn’t get the hint\n\nCAUSE DREW ALMOST CHOKED ON AN ALTOID MINT.”\n\nAgain, this game HAS to keep a runner going. That’s how Ryan works.\n\nRyan continues his move in this game to making Wayne’s character a woman, which throws him for a loop here. The first audible laugh at this move is Chip.\n\nColin: “…oh yeah, you’re a girl.”\n\n[This line has aged well]\n\nColin asks Wayne why he puts holes in things:\n\nWayne: “Because…without a hole, where would ya be?”\n\nBUZZ\n\nWayne:\n\nWayne takes an extra measure here, because why shouldn’t he?\n\nWayne: “Without a hole, where would ya be?\n\nNo place for [buzz] AND NO PLACE FOR THE PEE”\n\nWayne…aw, man…\n\nOnce the song ends, Wayne…deflates.\n\nRyan: “…NO PLACE FOR THE PEE.”\n\nDrew’s still cracking as he cuts to commercial\n\nNot the best show-stop, but such a silly one, especially Wayne’s whole character\n\nWayne, immediately after getting back to the seats:\n\nThe poor guy stumbled through half the scene, barely hanging on. He got into trouble and still ended with his dignity intact, but MAN. I can see why he’s so exhausted.\n\nThen, as they actually cut to commercial, Ryan and Colin go back to their Busby-Berkley arm movements…and Drew laughs for another 10 seconds\n\nHelping Hands: Ryan, hands by Colin, is the volatile owner of an Italian deli showing his son Drew the tricks of the trade\n\nOh god, a scene with Italian flag aprons with lots of touching. Maybe I shouldn’t have watched this one during the coronavirus after all…\n\nThis is a fairly standard one so far, but I do like the tomato flipped landing on the sandwich.\n\nOnce he bites the sandwich, he starts shaking the soft drink in his hand, KNOWING what must happen\n\nRyan just resorts to drinking olive oil to keep things going. Then…realizes he’s in way too deep, and just…holds his breath. He’s afraid to swallow. The succession of shots and faces Ryan makes when he realizes he can’t swallow OR spit it out, just writhing in place, is hysterical. He eventually has no choice but to spit downwards\n\nNot a great HH, but good for that olive oil moment.\n\nOverall: Solid show, with one extreme height, and one dud. Superheroes, Stand Sit Lie, Party Quirks and Show-Stop were all great, and there was a lot of fun energy throughout, especially before and after Show-Stop. Colin, Wayne and Ryan all had really good shows, while Chip was under-edited tonight. A lot of this show has been forgotten, mostly because it’s a solid S5 show surrounded by classics, but it’s a really good one, and it deserves more respect.\n\nShow Winner: Wayne\n\nBest Performer: Ryan, narrowly beating Wayne just for that HH moment.\n\nWorst Performer: Chip didn’t have a ton to do.\n\nBest Game: Party Quirks. Madness on top of itself.\n\nWorst Game: Helping Hands was too light, especially given the overexposure lately\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Yeah, both those episodes I referred to in the opening that we’re getting to within 12? This is the relatively normal sister episode. Season 5 taping, with guest star and hijinks…and this is the normal episode that they start us out with. With Greg.\n\n…I don’t really know how to go about this one.\n\nThis is an episode that was engineered to make big guest star ratings in 2001, and…features someone that hasn’t exactly come off wonderfully since the episode’s debut. Of course, I’m referring to WWE Siren superstar Chyna.\n\nWell…I would be referring to her as Chyna if Vince McMahon had allowed her to go by that name on ABC. He didn’t, as by the time this show would air, Chyna had basically been deemed persona non grata by the WWE for…reasons. She’s billed as Joanie Laurer, her real name, and there’s mention of her being a wrestling star (I think), but not CHYNA. So…even the producers didn’t really know how to go about this one.\n\nAnd to provide the context that not everyone may have about Chyna, after leaving the WWE, and after this WL episode wrapped, Chyna’s life spiraled out of control thanks to being cheated on, dumped by the WWE for sexism reasons, and, of course, copious amounts of drugs and alcohol. By the time of her death in 2016, she had not only alienated a lot of her WWE-era fans, but she’d become one of the worst things a former wrestler can become…a tabloid star. Like…’friends-with-Anna-Nicole-Smith’ tabloid star.\n\nSo…covering an episode of Whose Line with THIS PERSON as my feel-good guest star? OH GOODY.\n\nAh well, at least Brad’s here. This episode comes from a taping that has BARELY seen any output released. Just this and a Season 8 episode. That’s. It.\n\nScene to Music: Colin and his new wife Wayne are relaxing in a Jacuzzi at a health club, they are shocked when Ryan, the maintenance man, joins them in the tub to fix the jets\n\nA GAME WE HAVEN’T SEEN SINCE THE UK ERA. This game’s been retooled to resemble something like Film and Theater Styles, but it’s still good to see it again\n\nDrew: “Colin and his new wife, Wayne”\n\nWayne: [smiles at Colin]\n\nColin: [routinely nods at Wayne, as this is not his first rodeo]\n\nRyan: [enters]\n\nWayne: [shrieks]\n\nRyan: [puts on scuba mask]\n\nThe Jaws theme gives them the first style, adding an ominous tone, which Ryan reaffirms by warning them, “didn’t you see the sign?”\n\nColin gets sucked in\n\nRight as Ryan shoots Colin, romantic music plays\n\nColin: “…I feel better!”\n\nRyan: [playfully shoots an arrow]\n\nWayne: “Thank you so much for saving my husband”\n\nRyan: “your HUSBAND?”\n\nColin, eyeing Ryan: “…it’s nothing permanent…”\n\nHA\n\nWayne suggests he’ll do anything, even if it means “getting out of the way of true love”\n\nSuddenly, pulpy surf music plays, and he turns it into a striptease\n\nI love the detail of Wayne whipping his hair, and the hair hitting Colin slightly every time\n\nA very broad game, but it worked. The three of them focused more on movements and subtle touches than just dialogue, and that really worked. Not a COMPLETE triumph, but still a lot of fun.\n\nDubbing: Ballet dancer Colin is in love with his dancing partner, star ballerina Joanie, voice by Brad, a passionate woman with violent tendencies [OH MY GOD THAT CHARACTER DESCRIPTION HAS NOT AGED WELL AT ALL], as they are limbering up, her jealous husband, tyrannical ballet coach Ryan, storms in\n\nHere we go. And Drew is, technically, allowed to use Joanie’s name of Chyna, which gets some gasps from people in the audience. AS DOES THIS GETUP:\n\nDrew does mention that they can’t use her WWE name “or else they’ll sue us”, but…Drew, you mentioned it when you came in…\n\nThe ‘passionate woman with violent tendencies’ bit gets a hearty laugh from Drew AND Joanie.\n\n[tugs at collar]\n\nAlso, once Drew mentions Ryan’s character, Brad points to him, and Ryan scurries to the other side of the stage. I bet Ryan thought he’d be dubbing Chyna\n\nBrad, as Chyna’s on Colin’s leg: “I’m just gonna work out this knot”\n\nColin: “…that’s not a knot”\n\nColin, calling forth the inevitable: “I’m really nervous about this Wonder Woman ballet we’re doing…”\n\nOnce Brad yells “KISS ME YOU FOOL”, Chyna has no choice but to lunge at Colin:\n\nSo far, we can confirm at this taping session that Colin has kissed Whoopi Goldberg, Florence Henderson, and now Chyna. The man is building a rolodex\n\nALSO, THIS KISS LASTS FOR LIKE SEVEN SECONDS. MY GOD.\n\nBrad:\n\nyoooooou perv…\n\nAND IT KEEPS GOING. LONGER THAN TEN SECONDS. GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY, WHY DEB MCGRATH DIDN’T JUST MOVE OUT…\n\nColin…whispers something to Chyna right before Ryan comes in, which makes her giggle. I’m not sure what. Maybe an intimacy note? Like a ‘was that alright?’ kind of thing?\n\nColin, nevertheless: ‘OH, It’s so nice to have a woman on this show!”\n\nHA\n\nRyan:\n\nFunny mix-up where Ryan asks “how does that explain that lipstick on your face”, and Brad starts with an explanation, only to be undercut by Colin going “I think he was talking to me…” This cracks up Ryan a little\n\nBrad sort of writes the scene into Chyna giving Ryan a “farewell kiss”\n\nRyan:\n\nAnd as they do this:\n\nRyan’s hand just…keeps lingering over his own behind. Repeatedly.\n\nThis ends in a dance-off between Ryan and Colin\n\nBrad: “YOU TWO DANCE LIKE CRAZY, and I’LL JUST…SHIMMY…”\n\nColin goes in with some avant-garde interpretive dance which the audience seems to like.\n\nAnd then…suddenly:\n\nAS IF NO WHOSE LINE WAS COMPLETE WITHOUT IT.\n\nI love how Chyna just…backs out of the shot, absolutely floored. THAT is a funny reaction. Somehow she was not expecting that\n\nSo…that was wild. I think it was good improv? I’m not sure. But it just felt like Chyna just gave the entire game an exclamation point. She did fine in mouthing words, but just…really delivering her movements and…kissing Ryan and Colin was the bigger takeaway. I’m not sure whether it was good or bad, but I was entertained.\n\nDrew: “Hey, Ryan, were you spanking yourself while she was kissing you?”\n\nRyan: “Doesn’t everyone?”\n\nDrew: “…for a second he forgot he was on camera…”\n\nChange Letter: It’s new-members day at a nudist camp and experienced couple Brad and Colin are setting up a picnic- Wayne and Ryan enter soonafter\n\nCan’t Say P, Gotta Say G\n\nBrad, already establishing the obvious: “let’s start our GICNIC.”\n\nColin: “OHHH, GOTATO SALAD!”\n\nBrad, struggling: “..and…gotato chigs…”\n\nRyan, entering with Wayne: “Sorry we’re late, the Gorsche broke down.”\n\nBrad, obviously: “Nice genis.”\n\nRyan, perfectly: “…you are gonna GAY for that…”\n\nColin: “You have to excuse Geter, sometimes he can be a little grick.”\n\nHA\n\nRyan defies the game of the scene by introducing himself as ‘Dave’. Which is a fun touch\n\nA few straight slip-ups, Ryan says ‘Gerhaps’, forgetting that there’s another p in there, which Brad tries to help him with.\n\nAnd then, Colin introduces ‘gog’, which…is lost on Ryan, who clearly grew up in ‘soda’ territory, rather than ‘pop’ territory. He just loses it, not following at all.\n\nColin: “What? Am I SGEAKING ANOTHER LANGUAGE?”\n\nA haphazard but kind of fun playing of this.\n\nParty Quirks: Brad hosts\n\nWayne – The talking mirror image of everyone\n\nColin – A perky shoe shine who has brushes on his chest and an electric buffer in his butt\n\nRyan – All the characters in a gay Western\n\nBrad figures out the concept behind Wayne, and gets in close enough to warrant the FOURTH kiss of the show. Second between dudes\n\nOnce Ryan rings, Brad tries the same ‘close kiss’ strategy to Colin, which weirds him out. THAT is a fun character detail\n\nRyan: “…well throw a rope over the rafters and hang me high…”\n\nThe audience loves this\n\nBrad, guessing Ryan: “You’re not the cowboy from the Village People, are you?”\n\nNot a great PQ. Honestly, I prefer Drew and the gang riffing on gay westerns back at the seats\n\nRyan: “I’M GONNA BLOW YOU….AWAY.”\n\nBrad: “Let’s not forget fistful of dollars…”\n\n[HOW DID THAT MAKE AIR???]\n\nIrish Drinking Song: Knocked Over the Christmas Tree\n\nThis one has a messy, in-and-out refrain beginning\n\nColin talks about starting to fall\n\nRyan: “I put the presents underneath”\n\nBrad: “And broke my Christmas ball!”\n\nHA\n\nSOMEHOW THE THIRD VERSE IS MISSING. WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY REMOVE THE THIRD VERSE? PART OF THE STORY IS GONE!\n\nRyan: “I put the fire out myself”\n\nWHAT FIRE? WE MISSED A FIRE?\n\nBrad, too happy: “WITH THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER.”\n\nWayne: “Then, after I was finished.”\n\nColin, without a better rhyme: “DING-A-DING-A-DINGISHER.”\n\nRyan, barely together: “I didn’t know what to do that day”\n\nBrad, breaking: “It was so sad…”\n\nWayne: “No one got angry.”\n\nColin: “I peed my pants.”\n\nBRAD LITERALLY SQUATS ONTO THE STEP HE’S LAUGHING SO HARD. Wayne and Ryan don’t do much better\n\nA messy, haphazard, badly-edited IDS with a funny ending.\n\nLiving Scenery: James Bond, Ryan, and his Bond girl, Colin, have been captured and left to die in a fiendish way by Dr. No, they must escape from his snowy alpine hideout and make their way back to the safety of Bond’s luxury apartment\n\nDrew and Joanie are the Props\n\nColin, getting Chyna around him: “I’ll never escape this rack!”\n\nYOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID\n\nOnce Ryan mentions snowmobiles, he RACES TO GET CHYNA FIRST. Possibly remembering what happened with the cheerleaders we won’t see til S6?\n\nHOWEVER…THE POSITION RYAN HAS CHYNA IN IS QUITE REVEALING…And I believe her top wasn’t prepared for that much downward action. Also, noted perv [and by noted I mean I made that joke earlier] Brad Sherwood races to see if anything fell out\n\nRyan, saving the day: “MINE’S FLIPPED OVER!”\n\nRyan gets the bright idea to use Chyna as an igloo. Just so he can climb under her cleavage. Ah, 2001…\n\nColin then uses Chyna as a periscope, which is at least pretty funny.\n\nI feel like Drew hasn’t gotten to do much fun in this, so Ryan uses him as a toilet and reads a magazine.\n\nAfterwards, Drew shoots Wayne a look\n\nColin uses Chyna as a jetpack, and she jumps right on his back. Drew gets his arms around Ryan, and as he gets on the step so he can actually do this, Ryan turns to him and mutters something, perhaps getting a flashback to Chip during 4×09′s Hollywood Director\n\nRyan: “MINE AIN’T GOIN NOWHERE!”\n\nNot a great Living Scenery. Especially in comparison to some other recent ones that aren’t just ogling. Chyna seemed to take it in stride, but it was very…broad.\n\nOverall: [sigh] This wasn’t good, guys. What highlights do I take away from here that also count as good improv. Scene to Music? Just that one, probably? Cause Dubbing was…entertaining, but it wasn’t GOOD improv, and I cringed a few times just at how much Chyna was throwing herself into this. I wondered if this was all funnier in her head than it was in anyone else’s? It was odd. And then you had games like Party Quirks, which wasn’t good, Irish Drinking Song, which was bungled by the editors, Change Letter, which was okay, and Living Scenery, which was just awkward. Not a lot I liked here. Not a lot that’s aged well. And not a lot that the editors could make great even THEN. Maybe THAT’s why the rest of this taping hasn’t aired- the shadow of Chyna just looms over this thing so much that everything else isn’t airable. I don’t know, I just…didn’t like this one at all.\n\nShow Winner: Wayne\n\nBest Performer: Colin’s stuff was most obvious.\n\nWorst Performer: Wayne, once again, didn’t have much to do. I feel like I’m picking on him too much, but…it’s also kind of the edit.\n\nBest Game: Scene to Music. Closest to great improv tonight.\n\nWorst Game: Party Quirks was one big shrug.\n\nGuest Star Rating: Uhhhhhh I’ll go with 7/10 because she was really into it, but also scared the shit out of me with how into it she was? I’m not sure, guys.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: OH THANK GOD A HAPPIER SHOW. Mother of God, I was worried. Anyway, a Chip show leftover from Season 4, in a taping we haven’t seen yet. Definitely a best foot forward case, as the games I usually remember when I think about this taping are here.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, after the 100th show went well, the producers suggesting including more ‘holiday’ episodes to the Fall 2001 tapings, to get more ‘event’ ratings, and they subsequently filmed shows for Halloween, Christmas and Valentine’s Day, though only the Halloween show aired during regulation.\n\nThis…is the Halloween show, from a very frenzied and well-reported-upon Greg taping which I’ll no doubt get to talk in detail about.\n\nDrew: “To make it feel like Halloween, we have somebody egging your house right now”\n\nMake a Monster: Colin, Dr. Frankenstein, and Greg, Igor, construct monsters, played by Ryan and Wayne\n\nThis is a very odd yet very cool game that debuted in the Fall 2001 tapings, and was a great choice for the Halloween show.\n\nColin and Greg go right into some very fun characterizations as Frankenstein and Igor. They figure out that they should do the head of someone one of the two of them can do an impression of, so they give Ryan the head of John Wayne:\n\nGreg has a nice move of making the legs different, one being from a soccer player, and the other being from “a Radio City rockette”, making it extra difficult for Ryan\n\nColin, for the arms: “Oh, I know- how about the robot from Lost in Space.”\n\nHA\n\nOnce Ryan ‘comes to life’ he does a good job of displaying every attribute at once without seeming too overwhelmed by any of it.\n\nGreg, who actually seems to be better at this game than Colin, gifts Wayne with the head of Sammy Davis Jr., KNOWING that Wayne can do that impression\n\nGreg, leaning into Colin’s torso: “He might sing a ROMANTIC TUUUNE”\n\nColin: “…what are you talking into?”\n\nGreg: ‘…just checking your [CENSORED]”\n\nThis is one of those censored lines I’ve never been able to decipher. Is it ‘briefs’?\n\nColin ends up slapping Greg at a truly animated moment\n\nGreg: ‘…THANK YOU!”\n\nThese characters are probably the best part of this game\n\nGreg starts Wayne off with an arm from Muhammad Ali\n\nColin, out of ideas: “and the other arm…..from a woman.”\n\nHA\n\nAlso, I like the sudden, odd use of monster movie sound effects when Greg turns the machine on. Adds to the Halloweeny feel of it\n\nRyan, as John Wayne: “HEAD ON OVER HERE AND GIVE US…some sugar.”\n\nThe song portion sort of works, though you can tell there’s some clumsiness from both singers, ESPECIALLY RYAN, who seems like he’s reaching for most of this.\n\nOnce the game ends, Ryan mutters something to Wayne, possibly about who was really the man and the woman as they clearly forgot, and Wayne cracks up.\n\nA very clumsy first playing of this, and honestly the opening Colin-Greg portion was better than the ending song. But this game has promise, even though we’d only see it once more (in a playing I prefer)\n\nDrew, postgame, says he asked the producers for some candy, but all the produced was jelly beans, which “…maybe Halloween candy in England, but here it’s…Easter candy…”\n\nSo Drew just…chucks a handful at the seats. Knowing full well how pathetic this is.\n\nRyan does a chicken motion, as if Drew just passed out seed\n\nGreg: “Jelly beans on the floor? This is the best holiday ever, Drew…”\n\nScenes from a Hat:\n\nAnd now…one of the shortest SFAH rounds in the show’s history. Don’t worry, we’ll eventually see more scenes from this taping in a later show.\n\nDrew: “Things you don’t want to hear in the dark”\n\nColin: “Trust me, the points don’t matter.”\n\nAnd Greg and Wayne do a pretty genius one:\n\nWayne, offstage, in a Jamaican accent: “…hey baby, move over.”\n\nHA\n\nGreg, giving us a location: “…GUARD!”\n\nAlso, as an observation, the buzzer sounds a lot different this taping. It’s kind of lower, if that means anything.\n\n“What Slasher Movie Villains are Really Thinking While They’re Waiting To Pop Out” is such a good suggestion, it makes up the rest of the game\n\nRyan: “….man, I gotta go…”\n\nColin, practicing: “…stop, you’re about to DIE…no…you’re going to DIIIE…”\n\nColin, concerned: “…where are they? Gee…hope nothing’s happened to them…”\n\nHA\n\nAnd this ends with Greg and Ryan stabbing each other over a turf war, which is a very funny ending\n\nShort and sweet, though not really to the caliber of other recent SFAHs\n\nDrew, with a new bowl on his desk: “Funny thing happened while you were doing that- I found the GOOD Halloween candy…”\n\nSo Drew flings some lollipops and jawbreakers at them. Ryan just absentmindedly comes down and gets some\n\nGreg: “You know, who doesn’t wanna be seen eating a tootsie roll on TV?”\n\nLeast it’s not a Toblerone..\n\nGreg, laughing on a lull: “…THAT BAZOOKA JOE!”\n\nI kinda love the laid back feel the candy’s giving this show. Especially the mood Greg’s in. This mood would carry throughout the taping, and there’s a GREAT bit from Greatest Hits that didn’t make air with him and Drew discussing what Whose Line would be like if the Germans won World War II [“it’d just be called Whose Maginot Line is it Anyway”]. One day I hope they release it.\n\nWeird Newscasters: Colin anchors, Greg, politician filming a smear campaign against his rival Drew, co-anchors, Wayne, Frat boy doing a serious of outrageous dares to impress his drinking buddies in the front row, does sports while Ryan, rise and fall of a 1940s Boxer, does weather\n\nRyan’s quirk confuses him.\n\nI can confirm that this Colin intro and opening joke is from pickups. This one has a punchline of “now the snakes don’t even have a pit to hiss in”, which is a cheeky pun\n\nGreg: “As you know, my opponent, Drew Carey, lives in a house made entirely of chocolate…where he allows children to slide down the chocolate into a pool made up of nothing but gelatinous fluid.”\n\n[Colin has a great disgusted look to camera here]\n\nGreg’s able to nail this quirk AND leave Drew laughing rather than mad at him. Greg’s good at making up ridiculous details instead of just…insults.\n\nWayne’s good at playing off the audience, especially one random guy who WOOs once he grabs the candy bucket on Drew’s desk.\n\nSure enough, Wayne starts shoving as much of the candy as he can into his mouth, which Drew somehow abets him on.\n\nAnd, eventually…\n\nRyan…takes a creative approach to ‘1940s Boxer’\n\nYep. Different kind of boxer entirely. Once the audience gets it, they LOVE this\n\nOf course, the ‘fall’ is Ryan spontaneously being mowed down by a truck\n\nA fairly solid WN, but a bit disjointed in parts. Nothing really interacted, everything was self-contained, and a little smaller than expected. Ryan’s was a great cop-out, Wayne’s was a messy but fun idea, and only Greg’s really felt fully-realized.\n\nDrew, realizing that people now need to clean up the candy, just shakes his head\n\nGreg: “SCREECH”\n\nWayne: “Here are the show-brakes. SCREEECH.”\n\nGreg: “SCA-REEECH.”\n\nA line not used in the edit but definitely said by Drew was “it looks like Walt Disney threw up…”, which is one of Ryan’s go-to lines.\n\nHats: Dating Service Videos\n\nAh yes, Hats. The game the producers kept making the performers go back and do ALL THROUGHOUT THE TAPING. It’s hard to tell which pickups some of these are from.\n\nDrew: “Take it away…RYAN AND COLIN.”\n\nRyan and Colin:\n\n“…myeeahhh…”\n\nThis must have been in pickups. They have NOTHING\n\nI can confirm that these hats came from Halloween blowout sales. I can also say that I DEFINITELY saw this hat being sold in Halloween stores in 2001:\n\n“…you’ve got one down to go!”\n\n[middling response]\n\nColin lifts up the hat, looks at the camera, and mutters “…yeah”. this is what the whole round feels like for them\n\nColin, Elmer Fudd hat: “I’m just wooking for a wittle wove…”\n\nWayne: “…I like long walks….poo…”\n\nThis not only gets a good reaction from the audience, but Wayne as well\n\nGreg: “Well, I’m out of the caterpillar stage.”\n\n[…]\n\nBUZZ\n\nDrew, back to last game: “SCREECH. SCAAAREECH.”\n\nGreg, standing up: “You put the goddamned wings on…”\n\nAMAZING\n\nWayne: “I don’t have one, I just wanted to wear this…”\n\nRyan aborts a wolf-one halfway through, thinking it won’t air. Meanwhile, we get this shot:\n\nWHAT WAS COLIN GONNA DO THERE???\n\nEventually, Drew gets Ryan to do his:\n\nRyan, barely into it: “…ALL THE BETTER TO EAT YOU WITH.”\n\nTHIS THANKFULLY GETS RESPONSE\n\nA weird, barely-airable Hats round. Would have loved to see what didn’t make it.\n\nHelping Hands: Drew goes to see old witch Ryan, hands by Colin, to have his fortune told and buy some magic potions\n\nRyan, as Colin just sticks his fingers in his mouth early: “…MY FINGERS TASTE UNUSUALLY ODD TODAY…ALMOST LIKE I HAVEN’T WASHED THEM IN WEEKS.”\n\nAlmost like the producers kept shoving them back into a box of used hats for two hours…\n\nRyan: “Here’s what you need, the spell of LOVE.”\n\nDrew: “I can get that for 15 dollars?”\n\nRyan: “Not good love, FAST love…”\n\nRyan, with a gummy snake: “Why don’t you do the other end, and we’ll do the puppy thing”\n\nSecond time he’s forgotten the name of Lady and the Tramp. BUT A SECOND LATER HE REMEMBERS IT\n\nDrew and Ryan go right up the snake, closer…but right when Ryan pulls in, Drew just yanks the whole thing out of his mouth. One guy in the audience boos. He REALLY WANTED them to kiss.\n\nRyan: “YOU BIG TEASE!”\n\nIt culminates in the usual ‘making Ryan have something disgusting’, and this isn’t even the best one of those. So this one petered off for me.\n\nOverall: As a HALLOWEEN SHOW…kind of a disappointment, in terms of game selection. Helping Hands and Make a Monster could have been swapped out with a festive Hoedown and Hollywood Director. As is…this show’s alright. Nothing too special. SFAH’s fine, Weird Newscasters is flawed, Hats is done at gunpoint. Nothing seems to succeed entirely, more…partially. But the theming bits, and the candy, are all very funny. Greg even had a nice show despite not doing a whole hell of a lot.\n\nShow Winner: Wayne\n\nBest Performer: Yeah, Greg gets it. Had marvelous showings in Make a Monster, Weird Newscasters and SFAH.\n\nWorst Performer: Honestly, Wayne. Didn’t do much.\n\nBest Game: …fuck it. Scenes from a Hat. It was quick and didn’t disappoint me.\n\nWorst Game: Helping Hands just didn’t work for me.\n\nCOMING UP NEXT: Well…next show is a very weird one to talk about. It’s an episode from a Brad taping that only had two episodes from it, both ‘event’ shows. And this one is a guest star episode, that, uh…features a guest star that’s going to be very difficult to write about.\n\nOnto our first Kathy Greenwood show of the season…despite all of Kathy’s material from Season 5 coming from Season 4 tapings.\n\nRegardless, this is a new taping we’re seeing, the 433 taping, which we’ll get 1 episode from during regulation, and 2 episodes from during series’ 7 & 8. I have no idea WHY the material was relegated to later cobbled seasons, but…maybe ABC’s opinion towards Kathy has something to do with it?\n\nQuestions Only: In an alternative version of The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland where things have taken a turn for the worse\n\nA scene description like this works because we can start with established characters (Kathy starts as Dorothy, Wayne starts as the Cowardly Lion), and then move our way into the worldbuilding\n\nKathy, after Wayne tries a pick-up line: “are you trying to seduce me?”\n\nWayne: “Where’s your dog?”\n\nHA\n\nKathy asks to get back to Kansas\n\nWayne, turning this dark REAL FAST: “you willing to pay the price?”\n\nKathy, kinda surprised as well: “…why not?”\n\nWayne: “…ooh, I didn’t expect THAT…”\n\nBUZZ\n\nColin, entering: “…ever see a munchkin this big?”\n\nAnd then, indirectly foreshadowing the following game, he flexes\n\nKathy: “Don’t you know who I am?”\n\nColin: “…who?”\n\nKathy, under her breath: “…fuck…”\n\nBUZZ\n\nRyan has a smart move, and comes on with a clipboard: “…do you represent the lollipop guild?”\n\nRyan and Colin’s scene is very silly, as they get into the worldbuilding of munchkins unionizing and going on strike\n\nRyan: “…you’re not some kind of union scab, are ya?”\n\nColin: “…you’re…CRAZY?”\n\nBUZZ\n\nWayne comes on as a flying monkey\n\nRyan, as the same character: “are you a red bum or blue bum?”\n\nColin comes out jumping around as the Scarecrow, and he does this for a few seconds\n\nRyan, not giving him the satisfaction: “…did you just drop another tab of acid?”\n\n[this got CENSORED SOMEHOW]\n\nColin, smirking: “…did i do it over THERE or over THERE?”\n\nRyan: “…I don’t-”\n\nBUZZ\n\nVery good scene of this. I love when they worldbuild like this, and there’s a ton of really nice improv moments.\n\nNewsflash: Ryan and Kathy in the studio, Colin in the field in front of a bodybuilding competition\n\nCouple things I always notice with Ryan-Kathy Newsflashes- 1., Kathy’s usually the first to notice they’re filming during the usual pre-game arguing, this time about their divorce. 2. Ryan gives Kathy enough time to chime in and introduce Colin, but she never does, and he always has to do it, though doesn’t feel like he’s carrying too much weight\n\nColin, after the insane first shot of a bulked-out black dude gets a ton of response from the audience: “…well as you can see, things are slowing down a bit…”\n\nI’m gonna say this- once they show clips of women bodybuilders, the audience ends up sort of groaning at them. This would NOT FLY on the current version. That’s a disparity for you- the bulked up guys get cheers, the bulked up girls get groans\n\nColin, on another over-muscled girl, in a too-small bathing suit: “…I think this story’s about to break”\n\nRyan chuckles at that. Colin gives him a confused look\n\nColin: “THIS is very interesting right here”\n\nperfect\n\nRyan: “Colin. Along the same VEIN, let me POSE you another question”\n\nColin: “alright”\n\nRyan, sees a guy overextending himself, the veins in his head barely staying in: “…oh GOD…”\n\nColin, motioning to another female bodybuilder: “Of course, this entire thing could explode at any minute”\n\nRyan: “A question on everyone’s mind? Man or woman?”\n\nTHAT LINE would not fly in 2020. Colin even knows it, and says “well, why don’t we let a PICTURE say a thousand words here..”\n\nI love that even before Colin becomes a part of the community, he’s not gonna let Ryan call a female bodybuilder a man. Even if he doesn’t know exactly what’s behind him.\n\nI love that, once the clip restarts again with the black guy, Ryan is heard going “oh, NO…NO NO…”\n\nA pretty good Newsflash. Some comments that haven’t aged well take away from it, but it was pretty funny, and had a lot of good unintentional moments from Colin. Kathy was barely a part of it.\n\nSong Styles: Wayne sings a 70s disco song to Naomi, who works for UPS. Ryan, Colin and Kathy do backup\n\nOne of the more forgotten backup-dancer Song Styles, but I love this one. It’s obvious why: Drew announces everyone’s wearing big afro wigs for this song. Ryan, Colin and Kathy come and get theirs.\n\nWayne: “…oh, I don’t have one…”\n\nKathy, handing him his: “OHHH YES you do…”\n\nSo…we have THIS VISUAL:\n\nDrew makes the obvious Mod Squad reference\n\nColin, too happy: “doesn’t this bring back memories?”\n\nDrew thinks Ryan looks like Bernie from Room 222. Upon a Google search…he does!\n\nSo already, the visual of the other 3 boogieing around with those wigs is hysterical enough.\n\nOHHHH MAN, RYAN\n\nWayne: “GET ME THERE TOMORROW, AND PUT ME IN A LITTLE BOX.”\n\nI love Colin turning to both Ryan and Kathy, with a little ‘don’t we look ridiculous’ look. Ryan can’t help but let that sink in.\n\nWayne makes a Cast Away reference, which is nice…except in Cast Away, Tom Hanks worked for FedEx, NOT UPS.\n\nWhoever got the camera shot of all three backup dancers pelvic thrusting in unison deserves a raise\n\nOn paper, a very simple number, but my god this was so much fun. Wayne was just throwing out fun lines, and Ryan, Colin and Kathy were doing the goofiest dancing in the back. Maybe last show’s SS was a little sillier, but the wigs did the work for them this show.\n\nAs Drew wraps Naomi, Ryan gives him his wig, and he just…sits at the desk wearing the red wig like nothing’s different. Meanwhile, Wayne just goes back to the seats with his wig still on.\n\nRyan: “You know who you look like?”\n\nDrew: “No.”\n\nRyan: “You look like Side"
