        "text": "Roars of laughter filled the Kiwanis Community Theatre Centre Friday night as comedians Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath presented their One Couple Show in support of the Welcome Friend Association.\n\nThe husband and wife team were the obvious choice for the evening’s fundraiser given their own child Luke is transitioning into a woman.\n\nMochrie and McGrath joked about eliminating pronouns from their vocabulary and said they honesty wanted Luke to switch her name to Leia.\n\nJoking aside, the duo also stressed the importance of understanding, tolerance, and acceptance.\n\nDuring the main event, Mochrie and McGrath enlisted a number of audience volunteers for a variety of improv skits, a skill that both have perfected.\n\nAll proceeds from the event went to support the Welcome Friend Association’s Rainbow Camp which supports lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer questioning, and allied (LGBTQA) youth and their families."
