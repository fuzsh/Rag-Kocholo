        "text": "Article content\n\nA new holiday comedy made by Edmonton native Kevin Gillese is screening at Metro Cinema this Saturday. How to Ruin the Holidays — starring Gillese’s wife, voice actor Amber Nash, and improv king Colin Mochrie — is based on Gillese’s real-life family including his special-needs brother, Mark.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nEdmonton native Kevin Gillese's own life fuels holiday comedy with Colin Mochrie Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe film follows the story of a struggling comedian who returns home during Christmas to a father who’s become obsessed with preparing for the apocalypse, a sarcastic brother with a developmental disability and a sister who’s insistent the family is on the edge of ruin.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n“It’s a film based on my family and my life but I just changed enough stuff so that nobody can sue me,” said Gillese on Zoom from the Dad’s Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta, Ga. where he served as artistic director for more than 10 years. “It’s a comedy and a drama and it’s about the holidays and family and making the life that you want for yourself.”\n\nGillese, who’s lived in Atlanta since 2013, saw the film as an opportunity to show how a relationship with a special-needs sibling can be very different from what is normally shown on screen.\n\n“As I’ve gotten older, I’ve started to realize a little bit more about how satisfying it is to do comedy when there is more to it than just getting a laugh,” he explains. “One of the things that I’m really proud of with the film is that we used humour as a way of addressing some important things about representation and agency, and about the realities of having a family member with a developmental disability.\n\n“My brother and I laugh with each other. We joke around with each other … Comedy is our shared language despite whatever obstacles or barriers there may be. And I just hadn’t seen that (in film). I wanted to show a different perspective.”\n\nAccording to Nash, who was also on the Zoom call, the relationship between the brothers offered some healthy fodder for the film.\n\n“There’s actually some direct quotes from Mark in the script that always get big laughs,” says Nash.\n\nStarring alongside Nash is the up-and-coming special-needs actor, Luke Davis. Nash previously appeared with Davis in a short film called That Was Awesome. Gillese attributes the short as part of the reason they decided to make a feature-length film. You can watch That Was Awesome free on YouTube.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe movie was directed by Arlen Konopaki, Gillese’s longtime improv collaborator and the other half of Scratch — an audience favorite at the Fringe for nearly 20 years. Although both performers no longer live in Edmonton, they still frequent the theatre scene and return every year to perform.\n\nNash stars as the lead in the movie and says the project has a special place in her heart.\n\n“It’s the story of a struggling actor going home and being like ‘I’m still a struggling actor and comedian’ which I feel like so many people I know have been through and understand at its very core,” says Nash. “It’s so hard to choose a job where you have no expectation to be successful or be able to feed yourself. It’s a really sweet, very funny, kinda raunchy holiday movie.”\n\nFor Nash, the film is the first time she’s been cast as a lead. It’s also a departure from her usual gig as a voice actor. For 14 seasons, Nash has voiced the foul-mouthed Pam Poovey in the FX adult animated series Archer. The series finale will air this year.\n\n“Voice work is so different from stage work,” says Nash. “Going from voice work to being on camera just really made me appreciate how awesome voice work is because you don’t have to go through hair and makeup. You don’t have to memorize your lines. You can just show up and read them off a paper. It really is the best job on Earth.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNash is also quick to acknowledge that filming is stressful but rewarding in its own ways.\n\n“There’s a lot more pressure but it was also very fun because you’re getting to use your whole body as opposed to just using your voice,” says Nash. “Being on set is stressful and it’s long days but it’s also camaraderie. It’s almost like trauma bonding happens because you’ve all been through this insane situation together and you’re there for 12 hours plus a day with these people and they become like a family.”\n\nGillese on the other hand, approaches the subject with his characteristic dry humour.\n\n“As the writer and producer on this film, every day has been more chill than the last and honestly, it’s been like a bubble bath that’s lasted several years,” says Gillese. “No, everybody has been in hell but it’s worth it because we believe in the project so much.”\n\nOn top of promoting the new film, Gillese will be starring in a new solo show at Dad’s Garage in April 2024 called Seven Minutes in Kevin. Gillese and Nash will also be joining Mochrie for a series of improv shows in Canada in the summer of 2024, but details on that tour have yet to be confirmed.\n\nAs for Nash, she’s hopeful that the future brings more projects that see her and Gillese working together.\n\n“Hopefully we get to make more movies or do more projects that are ours because we really love working with our friends and working together and making cool stuff that other people probably wouldn’t hire us to do.”\n\nAfter a premiere earlier this month, How to Ruin the Holidays is showing at Metro Cinema (8712 109 St.) Saturday at 3:30 p.m.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
