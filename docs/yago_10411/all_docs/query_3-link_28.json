        "text": "Whose Line Is It Anyway? star Colin Mochrie has fired back at online trolls for attacking his transgender daughter on her birthday.\n\nThe 60-year comic posted on Facebook on September 3 to celebrate his daughter’s 28 birthday, writing: “Happy Birthday to my lovely daughter! 28 years old and everything we’ve ever hoped for in a chill.”\n\nHe also uploaded a photo of him, his wife—Debra McGrath—and his daughter Kinley.\n\nAfter a number of transphobic responses were left in the comments section, Mochrie posted another status on September 4.\n\n“Thanks to the fans of this page for being supportive and human. To the trolls, my thoughts and prayers to your body for losing it’s [sic] mind and soul so tragically,” he wrote.\n\nFans were quick to praise the comedian, who is best known for his appearances on both the US and UK versions of classic improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, for sticking up for his daughter.\n\n“Thank you for supporting trans folks,” one person responded.\n\n“We’re just trying to live our lives. We need love and acceptance like anyone else. So proud of your daughter and happy for your wonderful family.”\n\nAnother Facebook user said: “Fellow parent of a trans child here…your family is BEAUTIFUL and you set the bar for parents everywhere to love their kids unconditionally!”\n\nThe comic quietly revealed that his daughter is trans in January 2017.\n\nHe wrote on Facebook at the time: “My 90-yr-old mother-in-law and 87-yr-old mother love and acceptance of our trans daughter warms me. Wonder why some who are younger can’t.”\n\nThe comedian added: “The negative is that my mom refers to the community as BLT. It’s a learning curve.”\n\nThanking fans for their positive reaction, Mochrie posted on Facebook: “Thank you for the positive feedback on Kinley. For those less supportive, I hope somehow you can find empathy for those different than you and find a way to be more comfortable with those you don’t understand. Or you can remove your head from your ass.”\n\nAlthough it is the first time the news has made a splash, Mochrie and McGrath previously spoke about their daughter’s transition at a fundraiser for Canadian LGBT+ group the Welcome Friend Association.\n\nIn a speech the pair addressed their daughter’s transition and learning to switch her name and pronouns."
