More to come on this.\n\nNEXT SHOW IN TIMES SQUARE OCTOBER 30, 2016 3pm BUY TICKETS HERE\n\nPUBLIC CLASSES in TIMES SQUARE - CLICK HERE\n\nF ULL CALENDAR of SHOWS in TIMES SQUARE - CLICK HERE\n\nI have been teaching kids & teens now since 2009. I never expected to be a teacher. I never really liked teaching. I have been a professional performer for 20+ years now - Broadway Musicals on tour/regional theater, Improv Comedy in NYC and touring nationwide, TV, Commercials... I am certainly a doer not a teacher. And I could not stand the administration at schools and other programs that seemed more interested in politics, not making lives better for the students and staff.\n\nThen I had regulars/fans at our Improv 4 Kids shows asking about classes every week. So in 2011 I started a class. We had 3-4 students every week. I let a couple teens form our high school programs audit the classes in order to have enough to run.\n\nNow we run 3 classes weekly for kids & teens, averaging 10 students/class. We tech both improv & stand-up comedy.\n\nBut I may be off when I say I teach. I see myself more as a director. I do teach valuable acting skills (as well as creative writing, team, public speaking etc), however I think our secret is guiding these young artists like a director. We get out of their way, and their imagination take over; their's is far better than mine as a 44 year old adult.\n\nThe result is fantastic. We have students with agents and managers now. Some are actually getting work on TV. Some are working with us. We have had 3 students from various high school programs and one form our own get paid to do Improv with us. One even has taught classes after a few years experience.\n\nI grew up in Music and Theater, but more and more i wish I had programs like this. traditional theater for kids programs are based on decades old techniques. However, the modern world - including Broadway 0 wants more realism. My opera and clkassical big theater training - which makes me much louder than most - does not work on today's stages where such a voice blows out the body microphones.\n\nHowever, the Improv & Stand-up comedy training we provide is in line with what casting directors need for their projects. We helps students become the best possible versions of themselves. We teach them to observe and interpret the world, when other schools often just get kids to regurgitate lines with a smile. Instead of annoying \"Broadway Kids\" we have thoughtful and insightful brilliant young artists ready for any project!"
