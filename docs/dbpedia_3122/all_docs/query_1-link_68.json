        "text": "THIRSTY GUYS – …OUT TO LUNCH\n\n(June 2023 – Bad Time Records)\n\nAs a member of the Bad Time Records club, this is one I got really early and boy was it hard to keep my mouth shut about it. From the opening track ‘F**k I’m Dead’ through the end, this one has me banging my head and smiling big! It’s literally the perfect combination of all I love – ska, punk, hardcore, and it’s a bit poppy, too! Choose this over a cup of coffee one morning!\n\nFavorite Tracks – F**k I’m Dead, College Kids, Imposter Syndrome\n\nAmy Gabba & The Almost Famous – Screaming at the Top of My Lungs\n\n(June 2023 – Jump Up! Records)\n\nThis one may be surprising for those of you who know how much I reach for ska-core and ska-punk. It’s usually the heavier it is, the more I enjoy it. While this is true, there is no denying how talented Amy Gabba & the Almost Famous are. The vocals are some of the best I’ve ever heard, yet I can’t help but to destroy the songs by singing along! Open your mind and let this poppy album into your life. I bet you’ll be Screaming Along at the top of your lungs (see what I did there?).\n\nFavorite Tracks – One of My Mistakes, Makes me Want You More, Hey Little Rich Girl (The Specials cover)\n\nMustard Plug – Where did All my Friends Go?\n\n(September 2023 – Bad Time Records)\n\nLike many of you, Mustard Plug has been filing my earholes with music for almost 30 years now. My love for them started as a teenager and we’ve grown together over the years! It’s amazing how this band has stood up to the test of time, staying true to their roots, while also remaining relevant to current issues and state of our world today. This album is fun, but it’s also purposeful and will have you thinking as you skank along.\n\nFavorite Tracks – Vampire, Why Does It Have To Be So Hard?\n\nOmnigone – Against the Rest\n\n(March 2023 – Bad Time Records)\n\nI was hooked from the first track, Against the Rest, which comes in heavy and gives nod to the old Link 80 crew. This album is 30 minutes of ska-punk brilliance. It will make you want to drop what you are doing and start skanking wherever you are! I have not been able to catch Omnigone live yet but I sure am practicing and building up excitement for when I do (it’s coming)!\n\nFavorite Tracks – Against the Rest, Communities in Collaboration, In The Grey\n\nPLASTIC PRESIDENTS – GOOD TIMES CAN’T LAST\n\n(April 2023 – Ska Punk International)\n\nThis may be a debut album but it’s so good you would think these guys have been playing music together for a long time! It’s poppy/catchy ska, yet it’s heavy and feisty, too! Play this one a few times and you’ll find yourself singing along like you’ve been listening to it for years.\n\nFavorite Tracks – Arsonists Anonymous, Fairweather Friend\n\n#3 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nPOPES OF CHILLITOWN – TAKE A PICTURE\n\n(June 2023 – Criminal Records)\n\nI stumbled across this band and this album this year and fell in love with it. You’ll also love it if you appreciate some dub, hip hop, reggae and punk with your ska. Sounds like a lot but these guys do it in a way that is so seamless, resulting in a chill vibe that is sure to influence you to relax, move your body, and get lost in the tunes.\n\nFavorite Tracks – Short Straw, Apologise\n\n#2 ALBUM OF THE YEAR\n\nJ NAVARRO & THE TRAITORS – ALL OF US OR NONE\n\n(May 2023 – Bad Time Records)\n\nHaving been just over seven years since their brilliant debut album, Criminals and Lions, the hype and expectations were set for a great follow up release. ’All of Us or None’ is proof that good things come to those who wait! This one is filled with rocksteady and reggae vibes but the punk has certainly not been lost in the mix. It will have you dancing and will inspire you to fight for what’s right for ALL.\n\nFavorite Tracks – Holes, Rob the Rich, Casket"
