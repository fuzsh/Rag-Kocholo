I see some existing releases use the label for the manufactured by relationship. I’ve previously used the parent holding company, but now I’m wondering if this is correct. Which one is preferred?\n\nI’m not familiar with this company but I would not use a label (imprint) if it’s a manufacturer credit. If the holding has the same name as the manufacturer I would use the holding. If it appears frequently and there is no such label (company), I would create a new label, type manufacturer.\n\nFor phonographic copyright I’d use PONY CANYON INC., and there already seems to be some precedent for that. See also Sony Music Labels Inc., which has a lot of imprints serving as release labels but whose copyrights are almost invariably listed as Sony Music Labels Inc.\n\n“PONY CANYON / STEREO” is a text pattern that the company uses to indicate what they consider to be the primary label. It’s not related to the copyright statement. The company doesn’t run very many labels today, but you can see how the word to the left of “STEREO” has changed in the past in Knife Edge, FLIGHT MASTER, NINTENDO64 SOUND SERIES, etc.\n\nFor some reason, many Japanese record companies don’t include a company in the copyright statement.\n\nI see you have queued Edit #108663749 - Remove relationship.\n\nBut as it is displayed without labels, maybe we should simply link to [no label], instead, no?\n\n℗ 2021\n\n℗ 2021 [no label]\n\nInstead of loosing that ℗ 2021 info.\n\nAlthough, the copyright on sound recordings (℗) might not be such a good idea.\n\nThere is a rights holder, and if they are named on a later release we get:\n\nphonographic copyright (℗) by: XYZ Inc. (in 2010) and [no label] (in 2010)\n\n…for example. At least, it should not be used at recording level!\n\nWell, I think it should exist and it’s the right place, because ℗ is actually for the recorded material, represented by the MB recording.\n\n…\n\nThere are cases when one track of an album has an earlier date because it was released as a single one year before the album. This could not be captured at release level."
