        "text": "Hailing from the Bronx, Almighty Kay Gee was first introduced to what is known today as Hip Hop, in 1971 when he witnessed a DJ Smokey party where he first saw b-boys, graffiti writers and D Jing. Still in third grade, Almighty Kay Gee couldn't afford equipment to be a DJ and his parents would kill him if they caught him writing graffiti. His only option at that point was to break dance. Almighty Kay Gee learned to break dance from the original \"Mr. Freeze\" and \"Crip.\" Almighty Kay Gee learned to rap in 1974 after he heard Grandmaster Flash and the Furious 3's. During this time Almighty Kay Gee became a member of the all Jamaican \"Cheeba Crew.\" While with the Cheeba Crew, he learned to emcee and DJ simultaneously. He met DJ Charlie Chase in 1978 at an emcee convention and in 1979, after practice, became a part of the Cold Crush Brothers. Highlights in Almighty Kay Gee's career were going to Japan in 1982 on the Wild Style Tour. They were also the first group signed to CBS Records, through the Tuff City label. Almighty Kay Gee influenced Chuck D, who he considers a \"powerful emcee\" as well as Kool Keith, who Almighty Kay Gee met in the third grade. He has collaborated with such artists as C&C Music Factory, KRS-1, Funk Master Flex, Doug E Fresh and more. Almighty Kay Gee has produced \"Flesh not Bone\" on the Spooks first album and wrote a score for the HBO movie \"Disappearing Acts.\" Almighty Kay Gee has also performed with the Cold Crush Brothers at the grand opening of the \"Experience Music Project\" in Seattle. The Cold Crush Brothers are also on exhibit within the museum as one of the groups that contributed significantly to Hip Hop history. They also brought down the house, along with LL Cool J during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the museum's \"Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes and Rage\" exhibit when it opened at the Brooklyn Museum of art.I have over 25 years of experience.I play all genre of music from techno to hip-hop to rock to R&B and etc. I love to see people having a great time when I am DJ and people smiling and dancing I know that I am doing my job. Whether it's A wedding a birthday party a anniversary party or corporate event I make sure my clients come first this is a great business and I enjoy making people happy and having a great time."
