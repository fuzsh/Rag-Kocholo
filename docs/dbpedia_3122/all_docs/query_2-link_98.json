        "text": "Deal Unlocks Independent Music Catalogs for Early-Stage Startups\n\n(San Francisco, CA August 3, 2021) Feed Media Group, the leading B2B music licensing subscription service, announced today that it has signed a music licensing deal with Merlin, the independent music community’s digital music licensing partner for its Adaptr product. Adaptr is a subscription-based platform that makes it easy for startups to use popular music, and this deal provides access to an enormous catalog of licensed music from independent record labels and their artists.\n\nAdaptr was designed for startups that have raised less than $7.5 Million and earned less than $4.5 Million in revenue. Under the terms of the new agreement, record labels and distributors within Merlin’s vast global collective can make their music available via Adaptr beginning immediately. Merlin represents tens of thousands of labels and hundreds of thousands of artists from every country in the world.\n\n“We are thrilled that Adaptr clients will now have access to some of the best independent music in the world via our new deal with Merlin,” said Bryn Boughton, VP of Music for Feed Media Group “In so many cases independent music is perfectly suited for our clients, who are on the cutting edge of technology.”\n\n\"The deal with Adaptr is an innovative opportunity for Merlin to expand our member’s reach across sectors and services while giving early-stage startups access to diverse music from around the world,” said Jeremy Sirota, CEO of Merlin.\n\n“Adatpr solves a key problem our industry faces – ensuring that innovators have easy access to properly licensed music for their startups,” said Charlie Lexton, COO of Merlin.“As a tech-oriented organization, Merlin sees the value in enabling our members and their artists to participate in exciting startups at the earliest stages of their development, and to receive proper licensing fees in return. We’re thrilled to enable our members to power Adaptr.”\n\nAdaptr has previously announced licensing deals with other record labels, distributors, and publishers around the world. Adaptr is brought to you by Feed Media Group, a pioneer in connecting music rights holders and tech innovators. Its initial offering Feed.FM is a B2B platform that helps brands leverage music to connect with their customers.\n\nAbout Feed Media Group\n\nFeed Media Group is for businesses that need licensed popular music to create the most engaging customer experiences in their digital apps and physical spaces.
