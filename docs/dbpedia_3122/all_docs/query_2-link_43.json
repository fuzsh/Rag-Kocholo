        "text": "Osaka ska-punk legends HEY-SMITH have dropped their 6th full-length album, ‘Rest In Punk’, their first album release in nearly five years.\n\nFeaturing 11 tracks, the album includes recent hit single ‘Be The One’, ‘Fellowship Anthem’, and ‘Inside Of Me’, in addition to seven fresh tracks. The album also features ‘Say My Name’, the ending theme song for the TV anime Tokyo Revengers: Tenjiku Arc.\n\nThe title track, ‘Rest In Punk’, underscores HEY-SMITH’s unwavering resolve as a band, championing the principles of hope and freedom that lie at the core of their punk ethos.\n\nThis album also marks HEY-SMITH’s maiden release under the major record label Pony Canyon, following their 2022 signing coinciding with their 15th anniversary.\n\nOn November 16th, HEY-SMITH commence their ‘Rest In Punk Tour’ at Zepp Shinjuku, a tour that spans more than 60 dates across Japan, with performances scheduled in Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, and more.\n\nOriginally formed in Osaka in 2006, HEY-SMITH have come a long way since their debut with the mini-album ‘Proud and Loud’ in 2009. Renowned for their electrifying stage presence, the band maintains a relentless tour schedule, boasting around 150 annual shows and enjoying steadfast support from fans and fellow musicians. They have even established their own outdoor festival, OSAKA HAZIKETEMAZARE FESTIVAL, which continues to be a success since its inception in 2010."
