        "text": "Dissection Are:\n\nJon Nödtveidt - Vocals & Lead, Rhythm, Acoustic Guitars\n\nJohan Norman - Rhythm Guitars\n\nPeter Palmdahl - Bass Guitar\n\nOle Öhman - Battery\n\nDiscography:\n\nThe Grief Prophecy - 1990\n\nInto Infinite Obscurity - 1991\n\nThe Somberlain - 1993\n\nStorm of the Light's Bane - 1996\n\nWhere Dead Angels Lie (EP) - 1996\n\nThe Past is Alive - 1997\n\nFirst off, if you're talking about black metal, you have to be talking about the almighty Dissection! Oh, and by the way the song that plays on my index page is \"No Dreams Lie in Breathless Sleep\" off of the Storm of the Light's Bane album and the song that plays off this page is their cover of \"Elizabeth Bathori\" off of the Where Dead Angels Lie mini CD. Dissection is at the top of the game when it comes to musical talent and technical ability and even though the lead singer is in jail now for murder, their legacy lives on!\n\nThe Somberlain\n\n- This album is also their demo. I enjoyed this album for many reasons. Although this release doesn't compare to \"Storm of the Light's Bane\", it still makes an impressive statement. This album was great, I give it 4 out of 5 skulls...\n\nStorm of the Light's Bane - This has to be one of the best albums I've ever heard, Download the song \"Where Dead Angels Lie\" and I think you'll agree. This album displays impressive technical greatness, and it is one of the best black metal albums out there. I highly reccomend it, 5 out of 5 skulls...\n\nBLACK METAL PICK OF THE WEEK: \"Where Dead Angels Lie\"\n\nChildren of Bodom are:\n\nHenkka Blacksmith - 5 string\n\nJaksa Raatikainen - Drums\n\nJanne Wirman - Keyboards\n\nAlexander 'Ale' Kuoppala - Guitar\n\nAlexi 'Wildchild' Laiho - Guitar and Vocals\n\nDiscography:\n\nSomething Wild - 1998\n\nHatebreeder - 1999\n\nChildren of Bodom are a band that hails from Finland. They bring a unique sound to the black metal genre and all of their stuff I heard, I liked. Get their albums if you like black metal. The song that plays off of my Necronomicon page is the hidden keyboard solo off of the album Something Wild. They are relatively a young black metal band, but in my eyes they have already proven the talent and the originality that makes them stand out of the black metal genre.\n\nSomething Wild - This album is a great one, and I highly reccomend it. It is keyboard laden and the songs off of it are great to say the least. This album is a must for any black metal enthusiast. An impressive debut by this young band. 4.5 out of 5 skulls.\n\nHatebreeder - It is a much faster, more keyboard-laden than \"Something Wild\" and it kicks ass! The technicalities of this whole album are highly impressive. This, like \"Something Wild\" is also a must for any black metal fan. 5 out of 5 skulls.\n\nCovenant is:\n\nNagash - Bass and vocals(voice and pulse)\n\nBlackheart - guitars\n\nAstennu - guitars\n\nHellhammer - drums\n\nSverd - Synthesizers\n\nSarah Jezebel Deva - female vocals(starsong)\n\nDiscography:\n\nFrom the Storm of Shadows - 1994\n\nIn times before the light - 1997\n\nNexus Polaris - 1998\n\nThe Kovenant - Animatronic - 1999\n\nCovenant is a black metal band that hails from Norway. Both of their albums are very atmospheric with keyboards. I enjoy most of the stuff they come out with and they are very unique when it comes to musicianship. They display impressive keyboarding ability and shall leave their mark on the black metal genre.\n\nIn Times Before the Light - Impressive debut release from this two man outfit. If you purchase the album, check out Blackheart's portrait and e-mail me and tell me what you think, When you see the picture you'll know why. 3.5 out of 5 skulls.\n\nNexus Polaris - In this sophmore release, Covenant feature more members of the band. These members include: Hellhammer from Mayhem, Nagash from Dimmu Borgir, and Sverd from Arcturus. 5 out of 5 skulls.\n\nThe Kovenant: Animatronic - Their new one...I have to be truthful on this one, this album sucks bad, real bad. This album was so goddamn boring that I was in a goddamn coma by the end of it. This release sucks so bad that my balls were as blue as the sky by the 2nd song. Kovenant said screw their black metal ties and lets go industrial. Some of the songs on here sound just like Marilyn Manson. They also changed the names of their band members along with their, ahem, new sound. If you are a true black metal or 'Covenant' fan, you will not enjoy this at all. If you want to hear a song off of this, e-mail me and I will send you one. The only hope The Kovenant has now is to forget about this waste of an album and go back to their old sound or at least some true black metal.. This one gets 0.5 out of 5 skulls.\n\nMithotyn are:\n\nWeinerhall- Vocals & Guitar\n\nKarl- Vocals, Guitar & Keyboard\n\nRikard- Bass & Vocals\n\nKarsten- Drums\n\nDiscography:\n\nIn the Sign of the Ravens - 1997\n\nKing of the Distant Forest - 1998\n\nMithotyn are not the most notable of black metal bands, but they should be. They are one of the most unique bands when it comes to sound and lyrical ability. They are something to pick up if you are a true black metal fan. Their albums combine an eerie keyboard melody with really great musicanship and talent. They are a band to watch out for in the future...\n\nIn the Sign of the Ravens - Their debut release on Invasion, this is an all in all good album. The sound is very unique and it kept me surprised throughout the entire album. It is kept alive with the keyboard melodically mixing with the guitars. This release is really something else. 4 out of 5 skulls.\n\nKing of the Distant Forest - This is a big jump from the first album in quality but basically the same unique sounds. This album only proves how talented these guys really are. This is one of my favorite black metal albums and I highly reccomend it! 5 out of 5 skulls.\n\nCradle of Filth are:\n\nDani Filth - Oral Pleasures\n\nGian - Carniverous Licks\n\nStuart - Infernal Overkill\n\nLector - Umbilical Chords/Torture Chamber Music\n\nRobin Graves - Nocturnal Pulse\n\nDiscography:\n\nCradle of Filth is probably the most popular and commercial black metal band in the market today. They are very vampyric and gothic ridden in their music, most of their albums are worth it to get. They are the only band I know of that comes out with a new t-shirt every month. Commerciality at its best!!\n\nPrinciple of Evil Made Flesh - In my opinion I would say that this is their best album thus far, it is ridden with keyboards and I reccommend it. 5 out of 5 skulls.\n\nDusk...And Her Embrace - This is their second album and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I reccommend it to black metal fans. 4 out of 5 skulls.\n\nCruelty and the Beast - This is an overall good album, I liked this one as well. Make sure to get the double CD and not the single, if you already own it you know why. 4.5 out 5 skulls.\n\nEmperor are:\n\nSAMOTH - Lead & Rhytm guitars\n\nIHSAHN - Main Lead guitars, all vocals, synth\n\nTRYM - Drums & Percussion\n\nDiscography:\n\nEmperor - 1993\n\nIn the Nightside Eclipse - 1994\n\nAnthems to the Welkin at Dusk - 1996\n\nIX Equilibrium - 1999\n\nEmperor are black metal gods! These guys actually started all of this music when they were 16. Their albums are fast and at some times very melodic. Everything I heard from these guys, I've liked. If you are a true black metal fan, you probably own something from these guys.\n\nIn the Nightside Eclipse - This was an overall good album, I enjoyed it and it was fast. This album is a good album for a black metal fan to get. 4 out of 5 skulls.\n\nAnthems to the Welkin at Dusk - This album kicks major ass! Some people don't agree with me but I think this was a major step from \"In the Nightside Eclipse\". I highly reccommend this black metal release. 5 out of 5 skulls.\n\nAncient are:\n\nAphazel: Guitars, Bass, & keyboards\n\nKaiaphas: All male Voices, Drums, and assorted percussion\n\nJesus Christ!: Guitars, Bass, Keyboards, Cello, & Piano\n\nErichte: All female Voices\n\nDiscography:\n\nSvartalvheim\n\nThe Cainian Chronicle\n\nMad Grandiose Bloodfiends\n\nThe Halls of Eternity\n\nRising out of Norway in 1992, Aphazel's solo project Ancient rapidly developed into a full time band with the addition of vocalist/ drummer Grimm in 1993. Ancient paved a dark path with releases such as the \"Eerily Howling Winds\" demo and the classic full length \"Svartalvheim\" and mini album \"Trolltaar\". Separating from Grimm in '95 due to musical differences, Aphazel went to USA and recruited Kaiaphas from the Virginia based band, Grand Belial's Key. With the new line up formed, Ancient signed a five album deal with Metal Blade records. In 1996 \"The Cainian Chronicle\", quite a progression for the band, was released, followed by a European tour in early 1997. Their latest album \"Mad Grandiose Bloodfiends\", was unleashed in fall of 1997, demonstrates that Ancient has continued to move forward with dark innovation. \"The Halls of Eternity\" was released in 1999.\n\nSvartalvheim - This album features typical Norwegian black metal ala Mayhem. Features two or three stand out tracks but the rest are below mediocre. Don't buy this shit, but borrow it if you can. 3 out of 5 skulls\n\nThe Cainian Chronicle - This album is quoted as an \"eerie black metal masterpiece\" by some other douchebag who rated it. I listened to it and let me tell you, it falls short of a masterpiece, but it displays something....I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT IT IS SOMETHING. It is a decent release and as always is.....3.5 out of 5 skulls\n\nMad Grandiose Bloodfiends - This album is musically different from the previous albums. As you look at the layout of this booklet, you appear to see people in drag. It looks like a San Francisco gay bar. Amazingly, it is the band members. One thing to look out for on this album is an appearance by Jesus Christ! Check out the video for \"Willow the Wisp\". In this video, you can see Jesus Christ! acting abilites or lack of. 4 out of 5 skulls\n\nThe Halls of Eternity - Yet another appearance by Jesus Christ! that I would prefer to avoid. Features a new bitch on the female vocals. I didn't really care enough to get her name. This release is a great black metal album to purchase and any Ancient fan will enjoy it. 4 out of 5 skulls\n\nAMON AMARTH are:\n\nOlavi Mikkonen-Guitar\n\nFredde Andersson-Drums\n\nJohan Söderberg-Guitar\n\nTed Lundstrom-Bass\n\nJohan Hegg-Vocals\n\nDiscography:\n\nOnce Sent From the Golden Hall\n\nAvenger\n\nDeeply rooted in death metal with firm beliefs in Viking mythology Amon Amarth formed in 1992 in Tumba, Sweden a southern suburb of Stockholm. They began writing material with lots of melodies, harmonies and lyrics about Vikings and the northern gods. In summer 1993 they entered Lagret Studio to record the never released demo \"Thor Arise\". The band continued to reherse and writing stronger material and again entered the studio. The result was the second demo \"The Arrival Of The Fimbul Winter\". This time the band was much more satisfied with the sound and songs and launched it to an unsuspecting underground. The response was overwhelming quickly selling out of the first pressing and secured them a one off deal with Singapore's Pulverised Records.\n\nThis time they decided to use Abyss Studio, owned by Peter Tägtgren of HYPOCRISY, and during five days in November 1995 the MCD \"Sorrow Throughout The Nine Worlds\" was recorded. The five track recording contained three new songs plus two re-recorded tracks from the band's second demo. The MCD was released in April 1996 and continued the band's build to world dominance.\n\nOnce Sent From the Golden Hall - After releasing a mini CD a year prior, Amon Amarth were then picked up to release this masterpiece. This album features extreme melodic Black/Death influenced metal with viking lyrical content. Many would think their sound is comparable to Unleashed, that is BULLSHIT! This release also contains production by Peter of Hypocrisy and I highly recommend it to all fans of black and death metal. 4 out of 5 skulls.\n\nWitchery are:\n\nJensen - Guitar\n\nMique - Drums\n\nRicard Corpse - Guitar\n\nSharlee D'Angelo - Bass\n\nToxine - Vocals\n\nDiscography:\n\nRestless and Dead\n\nDead, Hot, and Ready\n\nThe first stumbeling steps towards what would later become Witchery were taken on the last week of April 1997, when four out of five members were fired from Satanic Slaughter by bandleader Ztephan Dark because of musical differences. This was only a week before the band were to enter the Los Angered studio to record the third Satanic Slaughter album; an album mainly concisting of mid 80's heavy metal covers, but also three own tracks. Now, oddly enough, it was the fired members who went ahead an recorded that album without Dark, and everybody enjoyed it so much that \"splitting up\" was never considerd. Only thing they needed now was a name and a lot of suggestions were made, but none stood out like a burning lightning-rode like Witchery, and so it was decided.\n\nRestless and Dead - Here we are at Witchery's first release on Necropolis Records. Receiving good reviews from the media and fanzines, this album was well hyped. This album also features Jensen's well executed, old school riffage and tasty licks(on his ballsac). I think the layout of this album was superb and it was well organized. 5 out of 5 skulls\n\nBlack Metal Fans Visited this page...
