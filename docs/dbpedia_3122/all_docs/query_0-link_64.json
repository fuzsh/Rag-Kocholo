        "text": "26 September 2017, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA\n\nThe IBMA is the International Bluegrass Music Association. Rhiannon Giddens latest album is Freedom Highway.\n\nGood afternoon. I am honored to have been chosen to present this year's Keynote Speech for the IBMA. After also receiving the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass last year, it feels incredible to be recognized by my banjo peers for being the die-hard banjo nerd and activist that I am. It was extremely challenging to go from a three-minute song to a thirty minute speech, but here goes!\n\n\"I'm just a hillbilly at heart\": That's what my Aunt Ruth said one day, smiling broadly at me, all cheekbones and gorgeous brown skin; to say she surprised me is an understatement. We had just listened to a few tracks off my first album with the Carolina Chocolate Drops when she dropped this bombshell, my elegant great-aunt, who had lived in the north for decades, but came of age in rural North Carolina. This was in the beginning of my career, when I still hadn't fully come to comprehend just how much the popular notion of the hillbilly stereotype shaped post-war Southern life and culture—the moonshine and the banjos; the overalls and the hay bales; the coal mines and the fiddles. All of these generalizations had left out people like my great-aunt; people like her sister, my grandma, and her children. And left out people like me—who come from both sides of the track—except, in so many areas of the South, there is no track. There's just people living and influencing each other in spite of what they are told to feel and do; and yes, Southern and American history is unfortunately thickly dotted with instances of the worst of human nature: violence, discrimination, and the warping of our souls; but underneath, and behind and around all of these acts is the strong current of intense cultural exchange, which is the hallmark of American culture.\n\nThe ability of musicians and artists to cross artificially-created boundaries and mix and mingle and become something new is exemplified in American string band music, the music that gave birth to the Grand Ole Opry; the music without which bluegrass wouldn't exist. That enormous moment in 1945 when Earl Scruggs joined Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys was, of course, not born of a vacuum—it was a moment that was hundreds of years coming.\n\nSo more and more of late, the question has been asked: how do we get more diversity in bluegrass? Which of course, behind the hand, is really, why is bluegrass so white??? But the answer doesn't lie in right now. Before we can look to the future, we need to understand the past. To understand how the banjo, which was once the ultimate symbol of African American musical expression, has done a 180 in popular understanding and become the emblem of the mythical white mountaineer—even now, in the age of Mumford and Sons, and Béla Fleck in Africa, and Taj Mahal's \"Colored Aristocracy,\" the average person on the street sees a banjo and still thinks Deliverance, or The Beverly Hillbillies. In order to understand the history of the banjo and the history of bluegrass music, we need to move beyond the narratives we've inherited, beyond generalizations that bluegrass is mostly derived from a Scots-Irish tradition, with \"influences\" from Africa. It is actually a complex creole music that comes from multiple cultures, African and European and Native; the full truth that is so much more interesting, and American.\n\nMusic has a power to bring us together in ways books, lectures, and indoctrination don't. So the question becomes: are we going to let bluegrass, as an art form, recognize the fullness of its history? Are we going to acknowledge that the question is not, how do we get diversity into bluegrass, but how do we get diversity back into bluegrass? How do we reframe the narrative so that it is seen to be welcoming to all—that the impact of Arnold Shultz, for example, on Bill Monroe is not a footnote, but rather recognized as being part of the main narrative of the story?\n\nI have bluegrass in the blood. My Uncle Dale plays in a long standing local bluegrass band, Southeast Express, and his father, the grandfather I never met, also played in a bluegrass band. My dad ran from bluegrass and went to the bustling metropolis of Greensboro to became a hippy guitar player, and incidentally, marry a black woman!—only to see his daughter grow up to play the old-time banjo. Life is funny sometimes! Now that's the white side—but as I thought about my upbringing, I realized bluegrass was in the black side, too.\n\nI lived the first part of my life out in the country, I guess you could say: my sister and I lived with our mother's parents in a small town outside of Greensboro. Back then there wasn't much to do other than play this really exciting game my sister and I came up with called \"run around the tree till you can go back inside the house\" just to get swatted out again. My black grandparents, retired, farmed their acre, played competitive bridge, listened to jazz and blues records and watched Hee Haw every Saturday night. You didn't get in between grandma and that large cabinet TV on the floor when Hee Haw was on—she was a huge fan of Roy Clark and his bluegrass banjo playing. I realized, as I prepared for this speech, that these are among my first memories of string band music and bluegrass—the 'picking and grinning' latter-day hayseed minstrel show that was Hee Haw—and it was glorious—we laughed at the cornpone jokes, watched the great guest performances, and all round had no notion there was anything odd with any of it, a black rural household in the South being entertained by this commercial idea of Southern music and culture while actually living the real country life.\n\nMy sister and I also often visited my dad's side of the family, the white side, on weekends, in another rural part of the outskirts of Greensboro, and there was Hank Williams and old gospel tunes coming out of my other grandma's radio. Now, I listened to plenty of pop music growing up, but it is these early sounds that I connected to when I turned to fiddle and banjo and became a disciple of 86-year-old Joe Thompson, the black fiddler from Mebane and the last in a long line of African American string band musicians. He often compared my banjo playing to bluegrass, probably because we played at the speed of light whenever we could—and that drove this clawhammer girl crazy! But for Joe, bluegrass was the new music, and he loved it.\n\nBut before Joe, before the Carolina Chocolate Drops, when I first got into string-band music I felt like such an interloper. It was like I was \"sneaking\" into this music that wasn't my own. It's a weird feeling—I constantly felt the awkwardness of being the \"raisin in the oatmeal\" in the contra dance world, in the old-time world, and in the bluegrass world. What was odd to me then but makes sense to me now was the place I felt most comfortable was the bluegrass world. Because there, in the piedmont, I was \"Dale's niece\" and everybody had an accent I grew up hearing, and an upbringing that I understood. But regardless, whenever I brought out my fiddle or banjo, or my calling cards to call a dance, no matter where I was, I still felt like the \"other.\"\n\nI remember so vividly the first time I saw one of Marshall Wyatt's superb compilations called Folks He Sure Do Pull Some Bow and seeing a picture of a black fiddler and freaking out—I had stumbled upon the hidden legacy of the black string band and I wanted to know more. Shortly after, I met Joe Thompson and realized that by picking up my banjo and by calling a dance I had joined an enormously long and almost forgotten line of black dance band musicians who helped create an indigenous American music and dance culture; of barn dances, corn shuckings, plantation balls, and riverboat and house parties.\n\nIt is now becoming better known that the banjo is an African-American instrument; a hybridization of African construction and tune systems and European adaptation and adoption; Dena Epstein, in her book Sinful Tunes and Spirituals, thoroughly documents the undeniable blackness of the instrument from the 1650s to the 1830s when it was known as a plantation instrument. This impression of the banjo continued until Joel Sweeney and his compatriots turned it into a commercial instrument meant for performing, with a standardized number of strings, tuning, and frame construction, and minstrel music, performed in black face, became the most popular form of American entertainment for the next 50 years. It was incredibly racist, but oh-so entertaining and the music was so catchy. It was the first American cultural export to sweep other nations, a full hundred years before rock and roll. It was banjo fever everywhere, and the real birth of the American popular song industry from Daniel Emmett's \"Dixie\" to Stephen Foster's \"O Susanna,\" and minstrelsy became the bedrock of American popular culture.\n\nBut the black to white transmission of the banjo wasn't confined to the blackface performance. In countless areas of the south, usually the poorer ones not organized around plantation life, working-class whites and blacks lived near each other; and, while they may have not have been marrying each other, they were quietly creating a new, common music. The Reverend Jonathan Boucher, who emigrated to England after the Revolutionary War, wrote a definition of the banjo in his dictionary published in the late 18th century. It says the banjo is \"a musical instrument, in use chiefly, if not entirely, among people of the lower classes.\"\n\nNow, it wasn't just Scots-Irish fiddle meets black banjo either; that's too simplistic. One of the earliest recorded instances of banjo and fiddle being played together was in 1756, in Newport, Rhode Island, by black musicians for an \"African frolic.\" As Phil Jamison says from his book Hoedowns, Reels, and Frolics: The Roots and Branches of Southern Appalachian Dance,\n\nWest African fiddlers have accompanied singing and dancing with one-string gourd fiddles since the twelfth century, and many black musicians in America learned on similar homemade fiddles before switching over to the European violin. As early as the mid-1600s, black fiddlers were playing for both black and white dancers at street celebrations in the Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam (New York City), and by 1690 slave fiddlers were routinely providing the music at plantation balls in Virginia. As elsewhere, dancing was the chief form of entertainment on the eastern edge of the North Carolina piedmont, and in the early nineteenth century \"every town and village had its ball-room, and its musician [was] almost always a negro fiddler.\"\n\nSo there's this incredible cultural swirl going on here—minstrel music becoming a huge commercial success, with traveling troupes bringing professional songs to different regions of the US; blacks and whites in places like Appalachia, and the piedmont, and other racially diverse areas are beginning to pass the music back and forth; and a wide flung net of black dance musicians are providing the music for communities all over the country, and are becoming the first to call square dances.\n\nThis was not the picture I was painted as a child! I grew up thinking the banjo was invented in the mountains, that string-band music and square dances were a strictly white preserve and history, that while black folk were singing spirituals and playing the blues, white folk were do-si-do'ing and fiddling up a storm—and never the twain did meet—which led me to feeling like an alien in what I find out is my own cultural tradition. But by 1900 this cross-cultural music was all over the South, not just the Appalachians, and a common repertoire was played by black and white musicians, not to mention regional styles, which often cared nothing for race. My own mentor Joe Thompson constantly talked about white musicians who lived in his area who he learned tunes from, and there was a constant stream of local white musicians who learned from and played with him, in what turns out is the great American tradition.\n\nSo what happened to change the paradigm so quickly between the turn of the century and the advent of bluegrass? Well, to begin with, there was the Great Migration. Six million Black southerners like my Great-Aunt Ruth decided to leave an economically depressed and racially depressing South for the mythical better life up North—and they took their families, food, and folkways with them—but in most cases they left that old-time string-band music behind. Newly arrived folks to New York, Chicago, and other Northern cities suddenly found that their lives were shaped by a totally different rhythm—an urban rhythm—that precluded corn shuckings and other rural events that would have required the familiar string band sounds they were used to; in addition, in the early 1900s the black community had shifting musical tastes—it was a time of great innovation and a proliferation of styles that would greatly affect the American cultural landscape. African American culture began a pattern of always innovating, always moving on to the next new sounds. The five-string banjo became, up North, a dazzling urban instrument that played jazz and ragtime, and, with its cousin the tenor banjo, became a mainstay of the dance orchestras until it was eventually replaced by the guitar by the 1930s, only to be eventually forgotten in the memories of urban blacks.\n\nWhat is often left out of this story, however, is that not everybody left the South: there were plenty of black folk who remained behind, and there were still black players of string-band music, despite the burgeoning popularity of the blues guitar. By some accounts, half of all string bands at the turn of the century were black. So why does it take a diving mission to find them? Were they recorded? It turns out they were—far less than we'd like, but more than people know—but never to be a mainstay of the body of recordings that form the basis of commercial country music and a foundation for bluegrass.\n\nBefore the invention of the phonograph and the attendant records, the music industry consisted of sheet music—popular songs of the day to be played yourself, and they chiefly consisted of patriotic and sentimental songs, minstrel songs, and orchestra pieces. But when the record industry was born, a whole new way of consuming American music was invented that was intended to make this new product easier to sell. Ralph Peer led the vanguard of A&R executives who would have a big hand in transforming how we think of our music; in his hands (and others) the musical genre was born. They saw that black consumers were loving the blues, and in 1920 the first \"race\" records were put out. Two years later they created the \"hillbilly\" market for rural Southern whites. In a musical market that had previously been dominated by professional compositions, it was a triumph for the working man that music \"of the people,\" vernacular music, began to be recorded.\n\nOne can celebrate this shift in the music industry while grieving the fact that in instituting these artificial categories, even if based on observed contemporary trends and assumptions, these record companies had a huge hand in the rapid segregation of American music. Columbia, Vocalion, and others would set up recording sessions, after advertising in local papers, where on one day they would record white musicians, and on the next, black musicians. If a black string band walked up to a session only knowing fiddle tunes, even if, as often was the case, they pulled from a common Southern repertoire that both black and white musicians knew, they'd more often than not be sent away if they didn't play the blues. The record companies had the power, and they wielded it at will—as Ralph Peer himself was quoted saying in 1959, \"I invented the Hillbilly and the Negro stuff.\" Except, of course, that he didn't say \"Negro.\"\n\nThere were a number of cross-racial recording sessions, such as \"Blue Yodel # 9,\" from the Father of Country Music himself, Jimmie Rodgers, which paired him with a little known trumpeter named Louis Armstrong, and his wife Lil Hardin Armstrong; and the Georgia Yellowhammers recorded with African American fiddler Jim Baxter, but for the most part this artificial sorting at the source was hard to buck. Occasionally black string bands were put on the hillbilly label but with their name obscured, such as when Vocalion Records released a set of tunes under \"The Tennessee Chocolate Drops\" for their race records and the exact same set of tunes under \"The Tennessee Trio\" for the hillbilly division. It rarely happened the other way around; when Columbia released the white Chattanooga duo the Allen Brothers' second record on their race series, the brothers sued Columbia for $250,000 for the damage to their reputations. A quarter of a million dollars in 1927! As they said later, \"We were trying to get into Vaudeville back then. It would have hurt us in getting dates if people thought we were black.\"\n\nAs Patrick Huber says in his essay Black Hillbillies: African American Musicians on Old-Time Record, 1924–1932:\n\nIn terms of their actual consumption patterns, Southern record buyers of the 1920s were far more omnivorous than record company executives generally seemed to comprehend, and interviews with elderly black and white musicians reveal that many of them purchased records intended specifically for sale to other racial and even foreign-language ethnic groups. Still, much of this appears to have been lost on talking-machine firms, which focused their promotional efforts on marketing race records to African Americans and hillbilly records to rural and working class white Southerners.\n\nThese promotional efforts reinforced a simultaneous nationwide movement towards creating a mythic white American history. A 1927 newspaper advertisement said that Columbia's hillbilly series Familiar Tunes Old and New were for those who \"get tired of modern dance music—fox-trots, jazz, Charleston—and long for the good old barn dances and the Saturday night music of the South in plantation days.\" Seems that everybody ignored the irony that the players for these blessed events would have uniformly been black in the \"good old days.\" Noted xenophobe Henry Ford founded fiddle competitions, but forbade blacks to enter; likewise White Top and Bascom Lamar Lunsford's Asheville Folk Festivals in the twenties were off limits to the melanin. There was an effort to repaint Appalachia as this completely homogenous society that was a direct unsullied line back to the old country, whether England, Scotland, or Ireland. This is a region that has always historically had a black population, in some places as high as 20 percent before the Great Migration, and is clearly a place where musical and cultural exchanges have been going on for a long time.\n\nFolklorists and song collectors at the time also had a huge hand in the creation of this myth; Cecil Sharp, founder of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, was one of the first to brave the Appalachian mountains in search of it. With Maud Karpeles he spent three years in the Appalachian mountains, recording families and making much of what he found there—but only the white folks. Now by the time they got to western North Carolina, the black population wasn't as high as it was, but that's only part of the reason there's no black representation in his collections, which influenced everyone who came after; they just plain didn't like black people. This abounds in their writings. My favorite quote is this one; after a long hard hike looking for the most isolated homesteads to record, they caught sight of some likely looking log cabins. Sharp says: \"We tramped, a very hard and warm walk, mainly uphill. When we reached the cove we found it peopled entirely by negroes!! All our trouble and spent energy for naught.\" Except of course, he didn't say negroes.\n\nMy goal here, today, is to say that what makes this bluegrass, old-time, and other forms of music so powerful is that there is room for everyone to explore these incredible traditions. I want people to understand—that recognizing the African American presence within these traditions does not come at the expense of trying to erase all of the other tradition bearers who have already received so much of our attention. I want to celebrate the greater diversity of the people who have shaped the music that is so much a part of my identity. I want the public to appreciate this string band music, this bluegrass music, as a creole music that comes from many influences—a beautiful syncretization of the cultures that call this country home. I don't want to minimize, trivialize, or ignore anyone's passion to explore this music. I just want them to understand, as fully as possible, the entire picture! If we are going to embrace greater diversity in bluegrass music, then we must be willing to acknowledge the best and worst parts of tradition.\n\nIt is important to what is going on right now to stress the musical brother- and sisterhood we have had for hundreds of years; for every act of cultural appropriation, of financial imbalance, of the erasure of names and faces, of the outside attempt to create artificial division and sow hatred, simply to keep us down so that the powers-that-be can continue to enjoy the fruits of our labor, there are generous acts of working class cultural exchange taking place in the background. These exchanges are indelible parts of this music. It's not about the \"influence\" of African Americans; we didn't \"shade\" the tunes with some contributions of syncopations and flatted sevenths; in actuality the great stream of string-band music that stretches back to hundreds of years ago, and that reaches forward to that great moment in 1945, is part of the foundation of what truly makes America great. It's not just Washington, Lincoln, Douglass, and King. It's also the untold thousands of ordinary folk playing banjos, fiddles, guitars, mandolins, basses, and everything else they could get their hands on—to make life a better place.\n\nSo that's the legacy. The question now: is that the future? Are we going to let a handful of dead A&R men and white supremacists decide how we feel about our own music? About who gets to play our music? Are we going to stand up to the kind of prejudice that had people warning me and my fellow Chocolate Drops, oh, don't go to the Galax Fiddlers Convention? That fellow in Floyd who said to my husband, oh, you're with that high yellow gal? and I see you got one of them blue gum negroes in the group ... Except of course, he didn't say negro. Are we gonna remember that pioneering hillbilly star Fiddlin' John Carson was a devoted member of the KKK? Or that we remember the Carter Family, but not Leslie Riddle? Hank Williams, but not Tee Tot Payne? Jimmie\n\nRodgers, Hobart Smith, Tommy Jarrell, Doc Roberts and countless others, who freely acknowledged all the black musicians who inspired them, but that we, as a society, don't remember or value? And what about Earl Scruggs' amazing innovation but not the hundreds of years of cross-racial music making that led up to it?\n\nWhen the Carolina Chocolate Drops became the first black string band to play the Grand Ole Opry, and let me tell you, it felt amazing—people started calling it a Healing Moment. But I have to ask: a healing moment for whom? One or two black groups, or one or two black country stars is not a substitution for recognizing the true multi-cultural history of this music. We have a lot of work to do.\n\nWe need to build on these moments, on these incredible opportunities to expand understanding. Some of the best times the Carolina Chocolate Drops had were at bluegrass festivals, at the Grand Ole Opry, and when the old time community welcomed us with open arms; Joe Thompson received every accolade possible for an old North Carolina fiddler before he died. Yes, there's so much beauty in this music, and in this, our culture—we have to keep reaching for it. To tear down those artificial divisions and let bluegrass and string band music be the welcoming place that it has, and can be, and, in more and more places, such as here at IBMA, strives to be now.\n\nAs Boots Faught said when he was confronted about Arnold Shultz being a colored fiddler in his band, \"You don't hear color. You hear music.\"\n\nI would like to leave you with the words of Paul Laurence Dunbar, eminent African American poet, the last stanza of his poem \"A Banjo Song\" he published in 1913:\n\nNow de blessed little angels\n\nUp in heaben, we are told\n\nDon't do nothin' all dere lifetime\n\n'Ceptin' play on ha'ps of gold.\n\nNow I think heaben'd be mo' home like\n\nEf we'd heah some music fall\n\nF'om a real ol-fashioned banjo,\n\nLike dat one upon de wall.\n\n8 February 2013, Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nThank you, thanks a lot. It’s kind of a freaky experience, the whole thing, it’s – it is\n\na bit like, this is the Italian wedding Patti and I never had. It’s a huge Bar Mitzvah.\n\nYour life does – did kind of pass and John legend made me sound like Gershwin, I\n\nlove that. Neil Young made me sound like the Sex Pistols, I love that.\n\nYou know, what a night, quite a night, uh makes me proud to be a musician. Here\n\ntonight with my mom, she is 87, she is here with me, yeah. My sister, it’s her\n\nbirthday, happy birthday sis. My lovely daughter is with me tonight, her boyfriend,\n\nand Ricky and Marian are my cousins who raised our children with us, thank you\n\nRicky and Marian for being here with me.\n\nGot to walk through red carpet, that was – it was fun. And Patty, what can I say,\n\nyou know, 20, 25, years we’ve been together, love you, love you. I’m glad you\n\ncould all share this night with me. I’m glad to be here for MusiCares, it’s a great\n\norganization, it takes care of musicians. They take care of the people who is taking\n\ncare of us with their voices and with their songs, with their blood, with their sweat\n\nand tears and with their lovely and great artistry.\n\nThe people whose music have inspired us and soothe their broken hearts, angered\n\nus, whose music we’ve got married to, divorced to, music that’s been with us on\n\nour blackest days, stood by us in war and in peace, made us laugh, made us be\n\nstrong, helped us not be stupid and formed us and loved us.\n\nMusic, do you believe in magic? There is no faith required, none whatsoever,\n\nbecause it’s all like this evening, right? Here in front of you. I’ve seen it, I’ve been\n\na part of the miracle of music. I’ve seen people tired and depressed and weary and\n\nworn out, soul off. And I’ve seen them revived, rise from their seats and dance.\n\nThe Taliban will never win, not now or not ever, not here, not in Timbuktu by\n\nbanning the music and dancing, don’t tell them. The minute you do that, you label\n\nyourself a tyrant and your cruel days are numbered. The minute Timbuktu was\n\nliberated, what did people do? They played music, and they danced. I was so happy\n\nto read that in the paper. I was happy for them, and happy for us.\n\n“Vive la France!”\n\nYou can’t triumph without music because music is life; music is the birds singing,\n\nthe wheat rustling in the fields, strumming of the wind through the leaves of that\n\ntree that was in the backyard of your childhood home. The earth and the stars\n\nrolling through the heavens at night, before man or a woman heard their name,\n\nthey heard music. They heard the wind rushing past their eardrums, the grasses\n\nhumming with insects, the birds knocking and rocking in the trees.\n\nThank you MusiCares for taking care of musicians, because we are bad with our\n\nmoney, we spend it too freely, and on too many stupid things. We drink it away, we\n\ndo drugs, we love too many and the wrong people, we are the wrong people. You\n\nknow, we fuck up many people’s lives, many people’s lives, while setting fire to\n\nour own dancing down the street. We are a brother and sisterhood of magical fuckups,\n\nand we need you.\n\nBecause once in a while we get it right, and then we sing about it, and we sing\n\nabout it and we are musicians. Take me for instance, I am here tonight under totally\n\nfalse pretenses, because whatever philanthropy I’ve ever done, it usually just\n\ninvolves me playing the guitar, making a few bucks and bringing some attention to\n\nthe folks that are really doing the work, shouldn’t count really much. I mean, I was\n\ngoing to be playing the guitar anyway.\n\nYou know, and I am actually, I’m here tonight because last year, Mr. Landau, my\n\nmanager called me up and said, “Boss, what do you think about opening the\n\nGrammys this year with your new song, and we had a new record, and I thought it\n\nwas one of the berst records that I ever made, and so I wanted to promote it, right?\n\nAnd I said, “It sounds great.” Because I am going to call Ken Ehrlich right now, all\n\nright, he is the Grammy producer, I met him, I don’t know maybe back in ‘96 when\n\nI sang The Ghost of Tom Joad, and he had me under like 10,000 lights, it looked\n\nlike I was going to be abducted by aliens.\n\nWe sort of – but anyway, I said go ahead call Ken; John calls back the next day\n\nsays, “Ken loves the song, and he would love to have a 63-year-old man open the\n\nGrammys, and – and would you like to be MusiCares Person of the Year?” Now,\n\nI’m pretty sure he said, “And” though he might have said “If.” He might have actually said, if you will be MusiCares Person of the Year or he might have said,\n\n“And”, and then he left a really long pause so that the “And” became “if” while it\n\nwas hanging out there. And he said, we’re going to be out there anyway for you to\n\npick up your best album award, because we are optimists. So even though I have\n\ngathered all of these people, some of my great heroes, all these new youngsters\n\nhere tonight is fabulous musicians. The evening actually had its origins in a\n\nmercenary promotional opportunity.\n\nUm, but, it’s a great night anyway, because people played music. So I’m having\n\none of the loveliest nights of my life tonight, I was just, I got the auction, you\n\nknow; just some I’ve really – the circle is a strange thing.\n\nYou know Ben Harper had Charlie Musselwhite playing with him on the\n\nharmonica, you know, I opened for Charlie Musselwhite in a little club in San\n\nFrancisco, he will not remember me, right? When I was my daughter’s age, you\n\nknow, and I have Patty Smith here in my life again. We always called that song our\n\nsong, but really it’s her song, right? I would have never finished it, I couldn’tdidn’t\n\nhave a story and the beautiful story of Fred’s Telephone Call, and if I’d had\n\nfinished it, I would have never had a hit with you, I would have never had. And see\n\nyou gave me one of my greatest, and I play this song almost every night, so it’s\n\nyour song and thank you for being here along with all of the other musicians, that’s\n\nthe humbling thing.\n\nI mean, it’s wonderful to see people come up and sing your music, the young\n\nmusicians. Musicians like the great musicians that are gathered here tonight, there\n\nis a group of people who are always in search, born searchers, born to get lost, born\n\nto get lost. Because that’s 98% of it and then suddenly, suddenly you’re home. All\n\npeople who are always in search of the power to sustain, the best of ourselves and\n\nto seek out the best in you, our fans and our audience. We want to be great.\n\nLike Neil says in his book, “Be great or be gone,” we want to be great, we want to\n\nbe important in your life, that was all that mattered to me. I didn’t care if I was\n\ngoing to be a, I don’t know if it’s going to make it rich or be famous or but I\n\nwanted to be great more than anything else, and I wanted to be important in your\n\nlife.\n\nBecause you keep us in search of the force that reignites our gifts, our ability to\n\nmake you want to move, to dance, to love, to make love, to be angry, to act. When\n\nwe play, we want the hair to stand up on your arms; we want you to feel the glory.\n\nAnd we want you to be glad of being alive. And really at the end of the day, that’s\n\nall there is to it. My fellow musicians, young and old tonight, thanks for taking\n\ncare of me and taking care of my songs this evening. I’ll never forget it and I owe\n\neach and every one of you; one. You made me feel like: Person of the Year. Now\n\ngive me that damn guitar.\n\n—————-\n\nSpringsteen Set List\n\nwith Jake Clemons, Nils Lofgren, Patti Scialfa, Cindy Mizelle, Curtis King\n\n1. We Take Care of Our Own\n\n2.

I can't even begin to tell you what an honor and a privilege it is to be out of the house. I know Neil Young was supposed to be here. People are looking at me like I had something to do with it. Why isn't Neil Young here? The truth of it is the poor guy just can't stay up this late. That's what it is. Either that or he swallowed a harmonica. I'm not sure.\n\nI'm so excited and you people know this but for 33 years every night I got to experience the blessing of live music. For 33 years. From the people in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and people who will be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and then for two years that went away. CBS caught me using a copier and fired me.\n\nWhen I came here to rehearsal and heard live music again I was reminded, oh my God what a gift live music is. I know all of these people and my band and Paul Shaffer were tremendous. Never take the opportunity for live music for granted and that's the message I can bring you folks tonight. It's a delight to be back here for this. By the way I've known Neil Young for many, many years. We met a long time ago on farmersonly.com. In 1988 is when I first met most of the people involved in Pearl Jam who were all in a band called Mother Love Bone. [Applause]\n\nThen, in 1991 things in the world of musical culture changed with an album entitled Ten. It was like a chinook coming out of the Pacific Northwest. It had an anger to it and it appealed to twenty-something people who felt displaced and unemployed and left out. I was almost 50 and even I was pissed off and it was also easy to dance to but that's another deal.\n\nThen, it turned out that these guys in Pearl Jam were something more than a band. They're true living cultural organisms. They would recognize injustice and they would stand up for it. Whether it was human rights or the environment. Whether it was poverty. They didn't let it wash over them. They would stand up and react.\n\nIn 1994, these young men risked their careers by going after those beady-eyed, blood-thirsty weasels. I'm just enjoying saying that. And because they did, because they stood up to the corporations I'm happy to say, ladies and gentleman, today every concert ticket in the United States of America is free. As I've got to know these gentlemen, they are very generous in spirit. As a matter of fact, listen to this, tonight the entire balcony is full of former Pearl Jam drummers. Stand up.\n\nI wanted to say a couple of things about the music of this group. The nice thing about knowing them for as long as I've known them, I know them as friends as well as cultural icons. And I would just like to say one day I hope to come back here for the induction for my friend Warren Zevon.\n\nNow, I'm going to start reading a list of the songs and you're going to start applauding and we won't get out of here until Sunday so: \"Jeremy,\" \"Corduroy.\" Now, here's one I like, the song, \"Yellow Ledbetter.\" It doesn't make Ten because they have too much good material, they decide we don't want to put this song on there with all of this other really good material. So, later it's released, as like, a B-side. Twenty-five years, it's an anthem. It's a musical icon. For a lot of people, that song would be a career. \"Sirens,\" \"Given to Fly,\" \"Kung Fu Fighting.\"\n\nThese guys, I used to have a television show, they were on my show 10 different times over the years. Every time they were there, they would blow the roof off the place and I'm not talking figuratively. They actually blew the roof off the place. For two years I did a show without a roof over the goddamn theater.\n\nYou know the song \"Black.\" There was a period in my life when I couldn't stop doing this *mimics song* Great. Now we owe them a lot of money. Honest to God that's all I could hear running through my head. I kept wondering how many times does this refrain occur in the song. I finally had to go to my hypnotist to get it to stop *mimics song again.* One night on the show I'm doing it and the stage door bursts open, in walks Eddie Vedder, he sings the song with Paul and the band. Then he comes over to me and looks me right in the eye and he says, \"Stop doing that.\" And I was cured, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nI want to tell you a story that I'm very fond of. It's about friendship with a guy who has done something for me that I'll remember my entire life. I had three shows left to go and Eddie Vedder was on that show and he sang \"Better Man.\" I like to tell myself it's because it rhymed with Letterman. There was something emotional in the air because as the show wound down the realization that we were saying goodbye, as I said before the experience that I miss most is the experience of live music every night. But that was in the air. It was palpable.\n\nAt the end of the show, Eddie Vedder came up to me, he handed me this, and I don't know if you can see that but that's the name of my son. He gave me this letter and said, \"This letter, it's for your son I want you to give it to Harry.\" I think we have a picture of my son, Harry. [Shows picture of young boy smoking a cigarette from his old show.] Look at that, we've had him at all the best clinics taking a gap year in middle school.\n\nSo, if you're in show business it's likely there's a good strong streak of cynicism in you, and I would be the president of that club except for things like this. This letter to my son from Eddie Vedder made me keep 2015, three shows left. I'll read you this letter now if you don't mind.\n\n\"Hi, Harry. My name is Eddie Vedder and I'm a friend of your dad's. I wanted you to have this small guitar to start with. Try it out, make a little noise, I'll make you a deal. If you learn even one song on this guitar I'll get you a nicer, bigger one for your birthday. Maybe an electric one. You let me know.\" And my son loves to fish, Eddie adds here, \"Playing guitar is kind of like fishing. Fishing for songs. Good luck, Harry, in all things. Yours truly.\"\n\nIt turns out that my son does play a string instrument, but it's the violin – close enough. There are quite a few reasons why these people are in the Hall of Fame, but forgive me if this personally is the most important reason.\n\n10 December 2016, Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nFirst of all I want to say thanks to Labyrith, that was an amazing performance.\n\nCan I put this down. Seriously? It’s better this way.\n\nMadonna accepts, adjusting microphone stand between her legs.\n\nIt’s better this way. I always feel better with something hard between my legs.\n\n[Crowd laughs.]\n\nThank you for acknowledging my ability to continue my career for 34 years in the face of blatant misogyny, sexism, constant bullying and relentless abuse.\n\nWhen I started there was no internet, so people had to say it to my face. There were very people I had to ‘clap back at’, because life was simpler then.\n\nWhen I first moved to New York, I was a teenager. It was 1979 and New York was a very scary place.\n\nIn the first year I was held at gunpoint, raped on a rooftop with a knife digging into my throat. And I had my apartment broken into and robbed so many times I just stopped locking the door. In the years to follow, I lost almost every friend I had to AIDS or drugs or gunshot.\n\nAs you can imagine, all these unexpected events not only helped me become the daring woman that stands before you, but it also reminded me that I am vulnerable. And in life, there is no real safety except self belief. And an understanding that I am not the owner of my talents. I am not the owner of anything. Everything I have is a gift from God. And even the totally fucked up things that happened to me, that still happen to me, are also gifts. To teach me lessons and make me stronger.\n\nI’m receiving an award for being woman of the year, so I ask myself what can I say about being a woman in the music business, what can I say about being a woman? When I first started writing songs I didn’t think in a gender specific way, I didn’t think about feminism, I just wanted to be an artist.\n\nI was of course inspired by Debbie Harry and Chrissie Hynde and Aretha Franklin, but my real muse was David Bowie. He embodied male and female spirit and that suited me just fine. He made me think there were no rules. But I was wrong.\n\nThere are no rules — if you’re a boy. If you’re a girl, you have to play the game. What is that game? You are allowed to be pretty and cute and sexy. But don’t act too smart. Don’t have an opinion. Don’t have an opinion that is out of line with the status quo, at least. You are allowed to be objectified by men and dress like a slut, but don’t own your sluttiness. And do not, I repeat, do not, share your own sexual fantasies with the world.\n\nBe what men want you to be. But more importantly, be what women feel comfortable with you being, around other men. And finally, do not age. Because to age is a sin. You will be criticized, you will be vilified, and you will definitely not be played on the radio.\n\nWhen I first became famous, there were nude photos of me in Playboy and Penthouse magazine. Photos that were taken from art schools that I posed for back in the day to make money. They weren’t very sexy. In fact I looked quite bored. I was. But I was expected to feel ashamed when these photos came out, and I was not, and this puzzled people.\n\nEventually I was left alone because I married Sean Penn, and not only would he would bust a cap in your ass, but I was taken off the market. So for a while I was not considered a threat. Years later, divorced and single — sorry Sean — I made my Erotica album and my Sex book was released. I remember being the headline of every newspaper and magazine. And everything I read about myself was damning. I was called a whore and a witch. One headline compared me to Satan. I said, ‘Wait a minute, isn’t Prince running around with fishnets and high heels and lipstick with his butt hanging out?’ Yes, he was. But he was a man.\n\nThis was the first time I truly understood women really did not have the same freedom as men.\n\nI remember feeling paralysed. It took me a while to pull myself together and get on with my creative life — to get on with my life. I took comfort in the poetry of Maya Angelou, and the writings of James Baldwin, and in the music of Nina Simone. I remember wishing I had a female peer that I could look to for support. Camille Paglia, the famous feminist writer, said that I set women back by objectifying myself sexually. So I thought, ‘oh, if you’re a feminist, you don’t have sexuality, you deny it.’ So I said ‘fuck it. I’m a different kind of feminist. I’m a bad feminist.’\n\nPeople say that I’m so controversial. But I think the most controversial thing I have ever done is to stick around.\n\n[Crowd applause]\n\nWhat I would like to say to all women here today is this: Women have been so oppressed for so long they believe what men have to say about them. And they believe they have to back a man to get the job done. And there are some very good men worth backing, but not because they’re men — but because they’re worthy.\n\nAs women, we have to start appreciating our own worth, and each other’s worth. Seek out strong women to befriend, to align yourself with, to learn from, to be inspired by, to collaborate with, to support, and be enlightened by.\n\nAs I said before, It’s not so much about receiving this award as it is having this opportunity to stand before you and really say thank you a s a woman, as an artist, as a human. Not only to the people who have loved and supported me along the way, so many of you are sitting in front of me right now, you have no idea…you have no idea how much your support means.\n\nBut to the doubters, the naysayers, to everyone who gave me hell and said I could not, that I would not, that I must not — your resistance made me stronger, made me push harder, made me the fighter that I am today. Made me the woman I am today.\n\nSo thank you.\n\n22 September 2016, Ryman Auditorium, Nashville, Tenneessee, USA\n\nI have come here today first to bring you love. I have come here to express my deep gratitude to you for your love of music and of each other. And, I have come here to talk about the value of the artist, and the value of art.\n\nWhen Michaelangelo was painting the great fresco The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel, he came under intense criticism from various members of the church, particularly the Pope's Master of Ceremonies- a man named Cesena- who accused him of obscenity. Michaelangelo’s response was to paint Cesena into the fresco in the lowest circle of hell with donkey ears and a serpent coiled around him devouring, and covering, his nether regions, so to speak.\n\nCesena was incensed and went to the Pope demanding he censor Michaelangelo for this outrage, and the Pope said, “Well, let’s go have a look at it. ”So, they went down to the chapel, and when the Pope stood in front of the fresco, he said to Cesena, “You know, that doesn’t look like you at all.”\n\nSee, the Pope didn’t want to jack around with Michaelangelo. Michaelangelo was making things that were going to last for hundreds of years. His stuff was going to outlive the Pope’s ability to do anything about it, so the Pope bowed to the inevitable. The Pope was afraid of a painter.\n\nThe painter could create another dimension between Heaven and Earth. Flat ceilings seemed to come down into the room in three dimensions. He painted rooms where priests and the church could sit and be transported to- and engulfed in- a higher realm, learning ancient stories- thoughts kept alive over centuries. And he did it by mixing together things he found laying around on the ground- sand and clay and plants. He was a fearsome alchemist.\n\nArt is not a market to be conquered or to bow before.\n\nArt is a holy pursuit.\n\nBeneath the subatomic particle level, there are fibers that vibrate at different intensities. Different frequencies. Like violin strings. The physicists say that the particles we are able to see are the notes of the strings vibrating beneath them. If string theory is correct, then music is not only the way our brains work, as the neuroscientists have shown, but also, it is what we are made of, what everything is made of. These are the stakes musicians are playing for.\n\nI want to recommend a book to you- The Technological Society by Jacques Ellul.\n\nJohn Wilkinson, the translator, in his 1964 introduction, describes the book this way- “The Technological Society is a description of the way in which an autonomous technology is in the process of taking over the traditional values of every society without exception, subverting and surpassing those values to produce at last a monolithic world culture in which all technological difference and variety is mere appearance.” This is the core of the dead serious challenge we face.\n\nThe first nuclear weapon was detonated on the morning of July 16, 1945, at 5:29 and 45 seconds.\n\nAt that moment, technocrats took control of our culture.\n\nTrinity was the code name of that explosion. It was an unholy trinity.\n\nTechnology does only one thing- it tends toward efficiency. It has no aesthetics. It has no ethics. It’s code is binary.\n\nBut everything interesting in life- everything that makes life worth living- happens between the binary. Mercy is not binary. Love is not binary. Music and art are not binary. You and I are not binary.\n\nParenthetically, we have to remember that all this technology we use has been developed by the war machine- Turing was breaking codes for the spies, Oppenheimer was theorising and realising weapons. Many of the tools we use in the studio for recording- microphones and limiters and equalizers and all that- were developed for the military. It is our privilege to beat those swords into plowshares.\n\nWe live in a time in which artists are being stampeded from one bad deal to another worse deal. No one asks the artists. We are told to get good at marketing. I have to say- and I think I probably speak for every musician here- that I didn’t start playing music because I sought, or thought it would lead to, a career in marketing.\n\nAnd, as we are being told that, our work is being commoditised- the price of music is being driven down to zero.\n\nI am working with a group called C3, the Content Creators Coalition run by Roseanne Cash and Jeffrey Boxer to develop an Artists Bill of Rights. Jeffrey is here today to meet afterward with anyone who wants to get into this. The first right artists have is the right to determine what medium they work in. The second is the right to set the price of their work.\n\nEvery person worthy of the name atist, from Rembrandt to Paul Cesanne to Picasso to Jackson Pollack\n\nFrom William Shakespeare to Tennessee Williams to James Baldwin and Jack Kerouac\n\nFrom Bach to Stravinski to Mahler to John Adams\n\nEvery one of those artists made art that to be understood, the world had to change.\n\nThey did not adapt to the world, the world had to adapt to them.\n\nThe technocrats suggest we crowd source.\n\nI suggest we not.\n\nThe very thing an artist does is figure out what he likes.\n\nThe technocrats- the digital tycoons- the iTopians- look down on artists. They have made all these tools and they think we should be grateful- subserviant even- and use their flimsy new tools happily to make them ever more powerful. But we can make art with any thing. We don’t need their tools. Music confounds the machines.\n\nSo the iTopians have controlled the medium and the message for a generation now. And they are making a complete hash of things. The clearest and most pervasive proof of this is the psychedelic political season we are in, which we can see playing out in every election around the world.\n\nBefore the atom bomb, we had begun to project idealized versions of people up on screens, while the people whose images were projected would hide behind the screens, knowing they could never measure up.\n\nAfter the atom bomb, we have automated that process. On facebook, everybody is a star. The idealistic, lysergic promise of the 1960’s has been mechanized, allowing us to become ever more facile conterfeiters.\n\nThe mask has become the face.\n\nMalcolm Muggeridge said that the kingdom Satan offers a man is to the kingdom of God as a travel poster to the place it depicts.\n\nThis internet technology that has been so wildly promoted as being the key, the final solution, to our freedom, has become our prison. What the false prophets of the internet said would replace governments and nation states and commerce, and create a free world of community and sharing, has led instead to a consolidation of wealth and power that makes the monopolies of the early 2oth Century- Morgan and Rockefeller and Carnegie- look weak and ineffective.\n\nEthan Zuckerman, the director of the MIT Media Lab has apologized for his part in creating what he calls a “fiasco”. Tim Berners Lee, who diagrammed the schematic for our current internet on a napkin, said at Davos last year that the internet needs to be rearchitected.\n\nOur 21st Century communication network, regarded by its early adherents with a religious fervor, has been turned into a surveillance and advertising mecnanism. The World Wide Web is just that- a web that ensnares everyone who uses it.\n\nArtists must not submit to the demands, or the definitions of, the iTopians.\n\nLastly, I am here to speak specifically about American music.\n\nThis country has been led by artists from Thoreau and Emerson through Walt Whitman to Woody Guthrie, through Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker, to Presley and Dylan to The Last Poets and Kendrick Lamar. The Arts have always led the Sciences. Einstein said that Picasso preceded him by twenty years. Jules Verne put a man on the moon a hundred years before a rocket scientist did. Medieval stained glass windows are examples of how nanotechnology was used in the pre-modern era. Those artists were high technologists, and many other things- they were aestheticians, ethicists, conjurers, and philosophers, to name a few.\n\nThey took risks. Risks a technocrat could never take. Artists risk everything in everything they do. Risk is what separates the artist from the artisan. Art is not a career, it is a vocation, an inclination, a response to a summons.\n\nWe, in this country, have defined ourselves through music from the beginning- from Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier in the Revolutionary War, to The Star Spangled Banner in the War of 1812, to John Brown’s Body and the Battle Hymn of the Republic in the Civil War, to the incredible explosion of music of the last century that was called Jazz, or Folk Music, or Rock and Roll, or Country Music- because although our music has taken many different paths, it is all of a piece and a most important part of our national identity- of US.\n\nMusic is to the United States as wine is to France. We have spread our culture all over the world with the soft power of American music. We both have regions- France has Champagne, we have the Mississippi Delta. France has Bordeaux, we have the Appalachian Mountains. France has Epernay, we have Nashville. Recorded music has been our best good will ambassador. The actual reason the Iron Curtain fell, is because the Russian kids wanted Beatles records. Louis Armstrong did more to spread our message of freedom and innovation than any single person in the last hundred years. Our history, our language, and our soul are recorded in our music. There is no deeper expression of the soul of this country than the profound archive of music we have recorded over the last century.\n\nThis is the story of the United States: a kid walks out of his home with a song and nothing else, and conquers the world. We have replicated that phenomenon over and over. We could start with Elvis Presley, but we could add in names for hours- Jimmie Rodgers, Rosetta Tharpe, Johnny Cash, Howlin Wolf, Mahalia Jackson, Bob Dylan, John Coltrane, Billie Holiday, Loretta Lynn, Chuck Berry, Hank Williams, Aretha Franklin, Jack White, Dr. Dre. That is the American Character. That is Johnny Appleseed.\n\nAt last year’s MusicCares tribute to Bob Dylan, Jimmy Carter said, “There’s no doubt that his words of peace and human rights are much more incisive and much more powerful and much more permanent than any president of the United States.” I believe that is undeniable.\n\nThat’s who the artists are. We can’t forget that.\n\nSo, in conclusion, there is this sense that the technocrats are saying, “Look, we’re just going to go ahead and do this, and we’ll sort it all out later.” As they did with the atom bomb.\n\nAs artists, it is our responsibility to sort it out now.\n\nBarnett Newman said, “Time passes over the tip of the pyramid.” By that he meant that there is a lot of room at the bottom of the pyramid to put things, but that as time passes, gravity washes them down into the sand. But if you put something right on the tip of the pyramid, it stays there.\n\nWe aspire to put things on the tip of the pyramid. That is our preference- our prefered medium.\n\nDigital is not an archival medium.\n\nTechnology is turning over every ten years. Their technologies don’t and won’t last.\n\nOur art-if we do it right- will.\n\n4 October 2014, Barclays Center, Brooklyn, New York, USA\n\nGood evening. In the beginning, there was Mad Dog Vini Lopez, standing in front of me, fresh out of jail, his head shaved, in the Mermaid Room of the Upstage Club in Asbury Park. He told me he had a money-making outfit called Speed Limit 25, they were looking for a guitarist and was I interested? I was broke, so I was. So the genesis point of the E Street Band was actually a group that Vini Lopez asked me to join to make a few extra dollars on the weekend.\n\nShortly thereafter, I met Dan Federici. He was draped in three quarter-length leather, had his red hair slicked back with his wife Flo — she was decked out in the blonde, bouffant wig — and they were straight out of Flemington, NJ.\n\nSo Vini, Danny, myself, along with bass player Vinnie Roslin, were shortly woodshedding out of a cottage on the main street of a lobster-fishing town: Highlands, NJ. We first saw Garry Tallent along with Southside Johnny when they dragged two chairs onto an empty dance floor as I plugged my guitar into the upstage wall of sound. I was the new kid in a new town, and these were the guys who owned the place. They sat back and looked at me like, \"Come on, come on, punk. Bring it. Let’s see what you got.\" And I reached back and I burnt their house down.\n\nGarry Tallent’s great bass-playing and Southern gentleman’s presence has anchored my band for 40 years. Thank you, Garry! Thank you, sir.\n\nThen one night, I wandered in the Upstage, and I was dumbstruck by a baby-faced, 16-year-old David Sancious. Davey was very, very unusual: He was a young, black man who — in 1968, Asbury Park, which was not a peaceful place — crossed the tracks in search of musical adventure, and he blessed us with his talent and his love. He was my roomie in the early, two-guys-to-one-six-dollar-motel-room years of the E Street Band. He was good, he kept his socks clean; it was lovely. And he was carrying around a snake around his neck at that time, so I lucked out with Davey as my roommate. [laughs] AND, Davey’s the only member of the group who ever actually lived on E Street!\n\nSo I walked in and he was on the club’s organ. And Davey’s reserved now, but at the time, he danced like Sly Stone and he played like Booker T, and he poured out blues and soul and jazz and gospel and rock & roll and he had things in his keyboard that we just never heard before. It was just so full of soul and so beautiful. Davey, we love you, and we still miss you so, you know?\n\nBut predating all of this was Steve Van Zandt. Steven: frontman, hitman. I walk into the Middletown Hullabaloo Club; he was the frontman for a band called the Shadows. He had on a tie that went from here down to his feet. All I remember is that he was singing the Turtles’ \"Happy Together.\" During a break at the Hullabaloo Club in New Jersey, he played 55 minutes on and five minutes off, and if there was a fight, he had to rush onstage and start playing again.\n\nSo I met Stevie there and he soon became my bass player first, then lead guitarist. My consigliere, my dependable devil’s advocate whenever I need one. The invaluable ears for everything that I create, I always get ahold of him, and fan number one. So he’s my comic foil onstage, my fellow producer/arranger and my blood, blood, blood, blood, blood brother. Let’s keep rolling for as many lives as they’ll give us, alright?\n\nYears and bands went by: Child, Steel Mill, the Bruce Springsteen Band — they were all some combo of the above-mentioned gang. Then I scored a solo recording contract with Columbia Records, and I argued to get to choose my recording \"sidemen,\" which was a misnomer, in this case, if there ever was one.\n\nSo, I chose my band and my great friends, and we finally landed on E Street — the rare, rock & roll hybrid of solo artistry and a true rock & roll band.\n\nBut one big thing was missing ... It was a dark and stormy night, a Nor’easter rattled the street lamps on Kingsley Blvd. and in walked Clarence Clemons. I’d been enthralled by the sax sounds of King Curtis and I searched for years for a great rock & roll saxophonist. And that night Clarence walked in, walked towards the stage and he rose, towering to my right on the Prince’s tiny stage, about the size of this podium, and then he unleashed the force of nature that was the sound and the soul of the Big Man. In that moment, I knew that my life had changed. Miss you, love you Big Man. Wish that he was with us tonight. This would mean a great, great deal to Clarence.\n\nAn honorable mention and shout-out to Ernie \"Boom\" Carter. The drummer who played on one song only: \"Born to Run.\" He picked a good one. So here’s to you, Ernie. Thank you, thank you.\n\nThanks, of course, Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan, who answered an ad in the Village Voice. And they beat out 60 other drummers and keyboardists for the job. It was the indefatigable, almost dangerously dedicated Mighty Max Weinberg and the fabulous five finger of Professor Roy Bittan. They refined and they defined the sounds of the E Street Band that remains our calling card around the world to this day. Thank you, Roy. Thank you, Max. They are my professional hitmen. I love them both.\n\nThen, 10 years later, Nils Lofgren and Patti Scialfa joined just in time to assist us in the rebirth of Born in the U.S.A. Nils, one of the world’s great, great rock guitarists, with a choir boy’s voice, has given me everything he’s had for the past 30 years. Thank you, Nils. So much love.\n\nAnd Patti Scialfa — a Jersey Girl — who came down one weekend from New York City and sat in with a local band, Cats on a Smooth Surface and Bobby Bandiera at the Stone Pony, where she sang a killer version of the Exciters’ \"Tell 'Em.\" She had a voice that was full of a little Ronnie Spector, a little Dusty Springfield and a lot of something that was her very, very own. After she was done, I walked up, I introduced myself at the back bar, we grabbed a couple of stools and we sat there for the next hour or thirty years or so — talking about music and everything else. So we added my lovely red-headed woman and she broke the boy’s club!\n\nNow, I wanted our band to mirror our audience, and by 1984, that band had grown men and grown women. But, her entrance freaked us out so much that opening night of the Born in the U.S.A. tour, I asked her to come into my dressing room and see what she was gonna wear! So she had on kind of a slightly feminine T-shirt and I stood there, sort of sweating. At my feet, I had a little Samsonite luggage bag that I carried with me, and I kicked it over. It was full of all my smelly, sweaty T-shirts and I said, \"Just pick one of these, it’ll be fine.\" She’s not wearing one tonight. But Patti, I love you, thank you for your beautiful voice, you changed my band and my life. Thank you for our beautiful children.\n\nSo, real bands — real bands are made primarily from the neighborhood. From a real time and real place that exists for a little while, then changes and is gone forever. They’re made from the same circumstances, the same needs, the same hungers, culture. They’re forged in the search of something more promising than what you were born into. These are the elements, the tools, and these are the people who built the place called E Street.\n\nNow, E Street was a dance; was an idea; was a wish; was a refuge; was a home; was a destination; was a gutter dream; and finally, it was a band. We struggled together, and sometimes, we struggled with one another. We bathed in the glory, and often, the heartbreaking confusion of our rewards together. We’ve enjoyed health, and we’ve suffered illness and aging and death together. We took care of one another when trouble knocked, and we hurt one another in big and small ways.\n\nBut in the end, we kept faith in each other. And one thing is for certain: As I said before in reference to Clarence Clemons — I told a story with the E Street Band that was, and is, bigger than I ever could have told on my own. And I believe that settles that question.\n\nBut that is the hallmark of a rock and roll band — the narrative you tell together is bigger than anyone could have told on your own. That’s the Rolling Stones; the Sex Pistols; that’s Bob Marley and the Wailers. That’s James Brown and His Famous Flames. That’s Neil Young and Crazy Horse.\n\nSo, I thank you my beautiful men and women of E Street. You made me dream and love bigger than I could have ever without you. And tonight I stand here with just one regret: that Danny and Clarence couldn’t be with us here tonight.\n\nSixteen years ago, a few days before my own induction, I stood in my darkened kitchen along with Steve Van Zandt. Steve was just returning to the band after a 15-year hiatus and he was petitioning me to push the Hall of Fame to induct all of us together. I listened, and the Hall of Fame had its rules, and I was proud of my independence. We hadn’t played together in 10 years, we were somewhat estranged, we were just taking the first small steps over reforming. We didn’t know what the future would bring. And perhaps the shadows of some of the old grudges held some sway.\n\nIt was a conundrum, as we’ve never quite been fish nor fowl. And Steve was quiet, but persistent. And at the end of our conversation, he just said, \"Yeah, I understand. But Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band — that’s the legend.\"\n\nSo I’m proud to induct, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, hard-rocking, booty-shaking, love-making, earth-quaking, Viagra-taking, justifying, death-defying, legendary E Street Band.\n\n12 April 1963, New York City Town Hall, New York, USA\n\nWhen yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb\n\nWhen you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb\n\nWhen yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace\n\nIn a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race\n\nNo matter what yer doing if you start givin' up\n\nIf the wine don't come to the top of yer cup\n\nIf the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on\n\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone\n\nAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it\n\nAnd the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it\n\nAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long\n\nAnd you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong\n\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day\n\nAnd tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away\n\nAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'\n\nAnd yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'\n\nAnd yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\n\nTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys\n\nAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'\n\nAnd the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'\n\nAnd the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'\n\nAnd yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'\n\nAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm\n\nAnd to yourself you sometimes say\n\n\"I never knew it was gonna be this way\n\nWhy didn't they tell me the day I was born\"\n\nAnd you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat\n\nAnd you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet\n\nAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air\n\nAnd the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare\n\nAnd yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying\n\nAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'\n\nAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet\n\nAnd you need it badly but it lays on the street\n\nAnd yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat\n\nAnd you think yer ears might a been hurt\n\nOr yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt\n\nAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rush\n\nWhen you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush\n\nAnd all the time you were holdin' three queens\n\nAnd it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean\n\nLike in the middle of Life magazine\n\nBouncin' around a pinball machine\n\nAnd there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying\n\nThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin'\n\nBut it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head\n\nAnd it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed\n\nAnd no matter how you try you just can't say it\n\nAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it\n\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\n\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\n\nAnd the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\n\nAnd his jaws start closin with you underneath\n\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\n\nAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign\n\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin'\n\nOn this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'\n\nOn this curve I'm hanging\n\nOn this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking\n\nIn this air I'm inhaling\n\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\n\nWhy am I walking, where am I running\n\nWhat am I saying, what am I knowing\n\nOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'\n\nOn this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'\n\nIn the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'\n\nIn the words that I'm thinkin'\n\nIn this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'\n\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking\n\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking\n\nBut you try with your whole soul best\n\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let\n\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground\n\nOr make yer heart pound\n\nBut then again you know why they're around\n\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\n\n\"Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping\n\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\n\nAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'\n\nAnd you can't remember for the best of yer thinking\n\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming\n\nAnd you know that it's something special you're needin'\n\nAnd you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'\n\nAnd no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding\n\nAnd you need something special\n\nYeah, you need something special all right\n\nYou need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track\n\nTo shoot you someplace and shoot you back\n\nYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler\n\nThat's been banging and booming and blowing forever\n\nThat knows yer troubles a hundred times over\n\nYou need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race\n\nThat won't laugh at yer looks\n\nYour voice or your face\n\nAnd by any number of bets in the book\n\nWill be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze\n\nYou need something to open up a new door\n\nTo show you something you seen before\n\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more\n\nYou need something to open your eyes\n\nYou need something to make it known\n\nThat it's you and no one else that owns\n\nThat spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting\n\nThat the world ain't got you beat\n\nThat it ain't got you licked\n\nIt can't get you crazy no matter how many\n\nTimes you might get kicked\n\nYou need something special all right\n\nYou need something special to give you hope\n\nBut hope's just a word\n\nThat maybe you said or maybe you heard\n\nOn some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve\n\nBut that's what you need man, and you need it bad\n\nAnd yer trouble is you know it too good\n\n\"Cause you look an' you start getting the chills\n\n\"Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill\n\nAnd it ain't on Macy's window sill\n\nAnd it ain't on no rich kid's road map\n\nAnd it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house\n\nAnd it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ\n\nAnd it ain't on that dimlit stage\n\nWith that half-wit comedian on it\n\nRanting and raving and taking yer money\n\nAnd you thinks it's funny\n\nNo you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club\n\nAnd it ain't in the seats of a supper club\n\nAnd sure as hell you're bound to tell\n\nThat no matter how hard you rub\n\nYou just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub\n\nNo, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you\n\nAnd it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you\n\nAnd it ain't in no cardboard-box house\n\nOr down any movie star's blouse\n\nAnd you can't find it on the golf course\n\nAnd Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus\n\nAnd it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes\n\nAnd it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons\n\nAnd it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices\n\nThat come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'\n\nSayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin\n\nLook at my skin shine, look at my skin glow\n\nLook at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry\n\nWhen you can't even sense if they got any insides\n\nThese people so pretty in their ribbons and bows\n\nNo you'll not now or no other day\n\nFind it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache¥\n\nAnd inside it the people made of molasses\n\nThat every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses\n\nAnd it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies\n\nWho'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny\n\nWho breathe and burp and bend and crack\n\nAnd before you can count from one to ten\n\nDo it all over again but this time behind yer back\n\nMy friend\n\nThe ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl\n\nAnd play games with each other in their sand-box world\n\nAnd you can't find it either in the no-talent fools\n\nThat run around gallant\n\nAnd make all rules for the ones that got talent\n\nAnd it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do\n\nAnd think they're foolin' you\n\nThe ones who jump on the wagon\n\nJust for a while 'cause they know it's in style\n\nTo get their kicks, get out of it quick\n\nAnd make all kinds of money and chicks\n\nAnd you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat\n\nSayin', \"Christ do I gotta be like that\n\nAin't there no one here that knows where I'm at\n\nAin't there no one here that knows how I feel\n\nGood God Almighty\n\nTHAT STUFF AIN'T REAL\"\n\nNo but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race\n\nYou can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face\n\nYou gotta look some other place\n\nAnd where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'\n\nWhere do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'\n\nWhere do you look for this oil well gushin'\n\nWhere do you look for this candle that's glowin'\n\nWhere do you look for this hope that you know is there\n\nAnd out there somewhere\n\nAnd your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads\n\nYour eyes can only look through two kinds of windows\n\nYour nose can only smell two kinds of hallways\n\nYou can touch and twist\n\nAnd turn two kinds of doorknobs\n\nYou can either go to the church of your choice\n\nOr you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital\n\nYou'll find God in the church of your choice\n\nYou'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital\n\nAnd though it's only my opinion\n\nI may be right or wrong\n\nYou'll find them both\n\nIn the Grand Canyon\n\nAt sundown"
