        "text": "Starting in 1968 with his first album with Nazz, four Philly musicians with an Anglophile bent whose label saw them as an American Fab Four, Todd Rundgren, Beatle-killer Mark Chapman’s all-time hero, has been making music for 40 years (42 if you count his proto-punk band Woody’s Truck Stop) and produced everyone from Meat Loaf to Patti Smith, The Band to Cheap Trick. Over the last four decades, the original DIY synth-kid has mastered pretty ballads and electronic freak-outs, pithy pop songs and side-long prog suites, organic jams and peace anthems at the height of glam. He’s also big on concepts: high on hallucinogens, he made rock’s first stream-of-consciousness LP in 1973 with A Wizard, A True Star, formed a band, Utopia, with the express intention of communicating his new-found acid visions, and recorded an album, Healing, dealing with the fall-out from his psychedelic drug adventures. And so it makes sense that, on the occasion of his 60th birthday, we should do a concept interview with the artist variously known as Runt and TR-I (Todd Rundgren Interactive), in which he talks for 60 seconds about the 40 best, or at least most significant, moments of his 40-year career, from Open My Eyes to Arena, his forthcoming bid to recapture his arena-rock glory days. (All entries are Todd Rundgren releases unless otherwise stated.)\n\nNAZZ: Open My Eyes/Hello It’s Me (from Nazz, 1968)\n\nTwo songs from debut Nazz album, issued as a double-A-side single, instantly prove Rundgren’s mastery of hard rock and ballads.\n\nThe Nazz were the super group that I built out of local musicians in the Philadelphia area, “super group” being a euphemistic term: it just meant different guys from different bands, not that you were super. Open My Eyes incorporated all our influences, with quotations from The Who and The Yardbirds, with the flanging via The Small Faces’ Itchycoo Park. But there are other influences, including The Beach Boys – the middle section with all the harmonies. We were open to all the possibilities, which is why our first single had Open My Eyes, a hard rock song, on one side, and Hello It’s Me, this dirge-like ballad, on the other. Although the label put us in a house together, there were differences between us and The Monkees, who were four “cute”, semi-talented guys picked for a TV show who didn’t write their music. We put ourselves together and wrote our own material, and we could play it fairly well, too.\n\nNAZZ: It’s Not That Easy (from Nazz III, 1969)\n\nTodd falls under Laura Nyro’s spell.\n\nBetween the first and second Nazz albums there was Laura Nyro’s Eli & The 13th Confession (1968). Her sophisticated chord progressions were a big influence. Burt Bacharach was too, and Brill Building writers like Barry Mann and Cynthia Weill. That was the germ that eventually brought the band down, because I was writing a lot of ballads and singing them when really the band was supposed to be a straight-ahead rock quartet with a lead singer. When I started singing more of these songs – mostly because “Stewkey” (singer Robert Antoni) couldn’t figure out how to deliver them properly – we got into big fights. I quit before the album was finished. I came back to mix it, and we did a few gigs for the money, but officially I was out of the band.\n\nWe Gotta Get You A Woman (from Runt, 1970)\n\nLocal hit from Rundgren’s debut solo album.\n\nMany people had trouble pronouncing my name, so I used the derogatory nickname (Runt) I’d had since I was a kid. We Gotta Get You A Woman was a hit in some parts of the States. That was partly because the label was brand new and didn’t have a lot of experience, and also because of the burgeoning feminist movement and a misinterpretation of the lyrics: there was a lot of protest about the song; in some cases threatening protests to bomb the radio station if they played it. It was about me and Paul Fishkin (assistant to Bearsville Records’ legendary founder – and Dylan manager – Albert Grossman) and I scoping for girls while we shared a two-bedroom apartment down on New York’s Lower East Side.\n\nSay No More (from Runt: The Ballad Of Todd Rundgren, 1971)\n\nNone-more-haunting ballad from unreleased, alternate version of Runt.\n\nI haven’t heard this in at least 30 years. My tendency is, after I finish a record, to listen to it until I’m totally sick of it, which is my way of getting musically beyond it so that I can move onto something else. That’s one reason why my records don’t sound the same. Also, Runt was the first record I ever really sang on, and I know how far I’ve come as a singer, so it’s hard for me to listen to myself singing not particularly well.\n\nWailing Wall (from Runt: The Ballad Of Todd Rundgren, 1971)\n\nReviewed for Rolling Stone by one Patti Smith, who compared Rundgren to Mozart. Recorded under the influence of marijuana, Ballad has been called “the greatest album Paul McCartney never made”.\n\nI don’t write lyrics until the music has been sketched out. Some people come to the songwriting process more as a poet or lyricist than they do a musician. Patti Smith probably has stacks of potential lyrics before she writes any music, whereas I don’t write any more than I have to. For Wailing Wall I probably had these chord changes and then I let the music coax some lyrical ideas out of me. It didn’t have to literally be The Wailing Wall. It’s just some place that somebody is stuck at. It could be a relative’s grave or any physical location that somebody is inexorably drawn to.\n\nHALFNELSON: Halfnelson (1971)\n\nRon Mael contributed to the artwork for Ballad, while brother Russell and Todd shared a lady-friend: ex-GTO, Miss Christine. Meanwhile, Rundgren introduced the world to the wacky wonders of Sparks (see RC 350).\n\nI plucked them out of obscurity when they used to rehearse in an LA warehouse next to a place where they made doggie beds. They were a terrific band with their own way of doing things, which was always attractive to me. I was looking for a band like the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band or The Mothers Of Invention, where they’re playing pop music but they’ve got a twisted way of doing it. Most of the demos they sent me wound up on this, their first album. The songs were so crazy and goofy, I thought, wow, this is going to be fun.\n\nI Saw The Light (from Side One of Something/ Anything?, 1972)\n\nThis double-LP saw our hero write, play and produce every last note of the first three sides. This is Julie Burchill’s all-time favourite song, although John Lennon was less impressed: he accused Rundgren of ripping off The Beatles’ There’s A Place.\n\nI didn’t go into the studio hoping to create the perfect pop single. It was written in 20 minutes. I just hit a groove. It’s the groove that most writers and performers spend their entire life looking for. The problem is, I get bothered if it comes too effortlessly. I feel like I’ve stagnated if there’s no challenge. I don’t recall John Lennon ever claiming that this was heavily influenced by There’s a Place. There are certainly Beatles influences here and there in my music, but not as many as you might think. I would have been more influenced by an American style of music than by British pop.\n\nIntro (from Side Two of Something/Anything?, 1972)\n\nThe studio whizz unveils some of his techniques. Hot Chip liked the 70 seconds of Todd-patter so much they sampled it for their 2008 album.\n\nThis was an indulgence. A friend owned a tape recorder and we used to spend hours messing around with things at different speeds, flipping the tape over and playing it backwards and then trying to imitate the sound of talking backwards, all those little games you can play with a reel-to-reel machine. So by the time I got to Something/Anything? I’d had a lot of hands-on experience and I thought, “Let’s do something goofy about the process itself.”\n\nCouldn’t I Just Tell You (from Side Three of Something/Anything?, 1972)\n\nTodd invents power pop.\n\nThis was never released as a single; they just kept releasing the ballads. There were a lot of hard rock songs on Side Three, and that was always part of what I was selling. My hardcore fans know to be prepared for anything, but many people would be indignant if I didn’t do exclusively ballads. But man does not live by ballad alone! At that point, I was a pretty estimable guitar player. I can’t say I was one of the all-time greats, but I could hold my own.\n\nHello It’s Me (from Side Four of Something/ Anything?)\n\nThe ‘pop operetta’ side of the album features this rerecorded version of the Nazz tune, which Todd performed in 1973 for US TV’s Midnight Special, dressed in Kabuki garb and make-up that made him resemble an insect-alien. It’s said he blew his chance to be a global Bowie/Elton-level megastar overnight.\n\nWhen I’d almost finished the album, I realised I had three sides of brand new material. It became obvious that if I wanted to include all of the material it would have to be a double, but I didn’t have the fourth side yet, so I decided to use it as an opportunity to play with other players (including the Brecker brothers and Rick Derringer). Hello It’s Me was one of three songs we did live on a Sunday afternoon. But none of them were recorded with the expectation that any would be a single.\n\nOne thing that releasing this as a single did was, it pushed the album into the gold record sphere. Then I appeared on the Midnight Special in my Birdman Of Alcatraz costume by this guy, Nicky Nichols, who did outfits and makeup for me. He was on this use-me-as-a-piece-of-art kick. I didn’t really know what was going on until he was done, which was moments before I had to go on. I thought it was pretty cool except for what he did to my hair. He gave me some kind of Mary Tyler Moore flip with a hot curler. That was weird.\n\nA WIZARD, A TRUE STAR (1973)\n\nTodd discovers psychedelics ahead of his/the first ever stream-of-consciousness record. “An album of vaulting ambition. Better than Pet Sounds. Better than OK Computer. Unquestionably better than Sgt Pepper’s,” as acclaimed rock author Barney Hoskyns recently wrote.\n\nThis was psychedelic not so much in the sense of coming up with weird Lewis Carroll-style lyrics, but in the sonic sense. The difference that psychedelics made for me wasn’t directly about the music; it was about my own thought process and realising in some ways how the brain works, the way that it’s constantly multi-tasking. I realised there’s a certain degree of controlled chaos going on in the average person’s head. The album was supposed to represent that.\n\nNEW YORK DOLLS: New York Dolls (1973)\n\nTodd the producer acts as midwife at the birth of punk.\n\nI was living in New York, but I was getting fed up with the amount of effort it took to get through a day there, so I decided to move upstate to Woodstock. I thought, before I leave, why don’t I do one of these bands in this burgeoning scene? It wasn’t called punk rock at the time. The band at the top of the heap was the New York Dolls, and they were looking for somebody with a reputation. It was a very interesting experience. They had probably the best songs of the “punk” bands, certainly the largest following, and the greatest amount of critical expectation. In fact, one of the biggest headaches was the number of freaking journalists there through the entire process, as well as groupies and other “cling-ons”. David (Johansen) was the one who took control. It’s not as if he was a real commandant or anything, but he tended to not get as fucked up as some of the other guys did.\n\nHow About A Little Fanfare?/I Think You Know (from Side One of Todd, 1974)\n\nBackwards voices and references to ESP preface Rundgren’s fifth solo album, and second double, in four years.\n\nI’d been through quite a regimen of psychedelic drugs, so the strict rules of pop music and even the strict rules of lyrics really didn’t apply any longer. It wasn’t as crazy a record as A Wizard, A True Star; it was essentially a retreat from that kind of aggressive stream-of-consciousness. I was less blinkered in terms of how I saw song-form. There was also a lot of experimentation from a technological standpoint: synthesisers were now becoming rife, and I was making full use of the sonic possibilities. How About A Little Fanfare? was one of those goofy experiments where I wrote out what I wanted to say and then turned it around and pronounced it phonetically backwards, and then played it backwards. It made me sound Swedish.\n\nA Dream Goes On Forever (from Side One of Todd, 1974)\n\nAmid the electronic freak-outs, a gossamer ballad.\n\nThis harks back to Something/Anything? I have an affection for those kinds of sappy ballads; I just don’t want to be a slave to them for the rest of my career. That’s one of the reasons why I stopped writing them. I got to a point where I wasn’t going around with a broken heart all the time. Things were going well in my romantic life (according to ex-girlfriend Bebe Buell’s biography, Todd was even more of a swordsman than her other conquests, including Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty), so it was pointless to write songs about lost love and things that I didn’t actually identify with any longer.\n\nEverybody’s Going To Heaven/King Kong Reggae (from Side Two of Todd, 1974)\n\nA monster medley of Hendrix thunder and rampaging reggae.\n\nEverybody’s Going To Heaven isn’t particularly obtuse, although it depends on your religious persuasion. A lot of people believe this is the worst of all possible worlds, and that the afterlife can only be better, so I was expressing that. King Kong Reggae was a gag I came up with because the toilet in the studio, which you can hear in the song, made this incredible roaring noise every time you flushed it. It was one of those old-fashioned ones with a big box on the wall and a long pipe and chain which you’d pull, and the sound of the water being sucked out of the box made this incredible roar that reminded me of King Kong. I thought, “I’ve got to write something around that sound.” There’s no deep hidden meaning. It’s an ode to a toilet.\n\nSons Of 1984 (from Side Four of Todd, 1974)\n\nTodd’s second fanfare for the common man after Wizard’s Just One Victory. Meet Todd Rundgren Interactive: the track features audiences recorded on America’s two coasts, while the album’s foldout includes a poster of Todd’s face comprising all the names of fans sent in on postcards given away with Wizard.\n\nIt was post-Vietnam and Watergate, and nobody else was writing these big anthems so I thought, “I’ll have to do it.” I didn’t expect I’d become a voice for other people; that the kind of music I was writing was engendering this intense fan loyalty. But I began to think of myself more as a musical representative of those people than as a balladeer, so I started writing these tunes in response to people’s reactions to my music.\n\nThe live recording of it was, again, one of these goofball ideas that had as much to do with technology as it did music. The postcard and poster were Albert Grossman’s ideas. He wanted to get a list of names: he said the most important thing is to get information from people. It was the graphic designer’s idea to turn the names into a picture of my face. It could have turned out to be a much bigger poster. I think there were about 10,000 names on it. If everyone who’d bought Wizard had sent it in, we’d have been in trouble.\n\nUTOPIA: The Ikon (from Todd Rundgren’s Utopia, 1974)\n\n“Polyrhythmic, contrapuntal and multi-timbral,” as Rundgren described this 30-minute techno-rock opus, comparing the band to The Grateful Dead jamming with Parliament.\n\nI’d been playing less and less guitar, and more keyboards. The Mahavishnu Orchestra were a big influence, not just on me, but on all the players in the band. We didn’t have the commitment to it that John McLaughlin did, though. Most of the guys didn’t have any spiritual agenda except for Kevin Ellman, the drummer, who was into Buddhism, where you chant for new cars and stuff, which he tried to get us all into.\n\nUTOPIA: Freedom Fighters (from Todd Rundgren’s Utopia, 1974)\n\nBrief but intense, this was a favourite of a certain Mark David Chapman.\n\nYeah, this was big with homicidal maniacs. I had to come up with something that could pass for a single and make it look like we were making an effort. But I also wanted more heavy metal elements and a heroic type of lyric, a rallying cry. It was meant to be a magnet for people on the fringes. The idea of the Utopia concept was a new community, but instead of it being, like, “Let’s go raise soybeans and sew our own clothes” – that kind of old-fashioned agrarian Utopianism, it was a high-tech Utopianism; the kind that gets into a spaceship and colonises other planets. Every couple of years I start wishing I had a big shoebox full of peyote buttons like I had in the 70s…\n\nHALL & OATES: War Babies (1974)\n\nIf this sounds like Rundgren/Utopia, that’s because Todd produced, engineered and supervised the recording, and members of Utopia played bass and drums.\n\nThis was recorded in the same studio, NYC’s Secret Sound, that we did the last few records, using similar devices, so the sound would be redolent. Actually, Daryl Hall was heavily influenced by David Bowie. They were yet to have a string of pop records, so they weren’t yet in a box. Unfortunately, War Babies wasn’t particularly well-received by the label, so that was their last record for Atlantic.\n\nReal Man (from Side One of Initiation, 1975)\n\nFrom the longest single album ever made came this super-melodic calm before the electroid storm.\n\nThis was sort of Motown from Mars. I was starting to make a distinction between psychedelics and the spiritual revelation that transcends the drug experience. I knew there was going to be a lot of long, challenging music on this album, and thought the best thing to do was to start out light and poppy, then get more dense. So you could say Real Man is the opening credits to the rest of the record.\n\nA Treatise On Cosmic Fire (Side Two of Initiation, 1975)\n\nRundgren’s side-long musical response to Alice A Bailey’s metaphysical Eastern philosophical tome.\n\nThis was strictly composed and performed mostly by myself using synthesisers. What (fellow Utopian) Roger Powell, who had been working for Moog, and I would do was set up a complicated patch, put the machines onto record, and then alter things on the fly, changing the rhythm and melodic patterns around. Then I’d go back and cut out all the most interesting pieces and string them together, then overdub some guitar. It was contemporary electronic music.\n\nSide One of Faithful (1976)\n\nThe Beatles, Dylan, Hendrix, The Yardbirds and The Beach Boys get, uh, faithfully recreated.\n\nIt was a tribute to the music that I heard on the radio walking down Chestnut Street in Philadelphia in 1966. The Yardbirds were a seminal influence on the Nazz so it was a no-brainer to pick one of their songs. A bigger challenge was Good Vibrations – it took six weeks for Brian Wilson to do the original, and we weren’t going to hire cello players, so we spent a day trying to get a fuzzy guitar sound that sounded like a cello. I didn’t do much to vary the pitch and tone of my voice (to get those Mike Love/Wilson falsettos). I’ve always tried to use the natural range of my voice.\n\nSide Two of Faithful (1976)\n\nTodd’s most conventional set of original material for four years.\n\nIt’s not that writing conventional songs was ever hard, it’s just that most of the Utopia records had an agenda to exploit the playing, and the concise pop song isn’t really built for that sort of noodling. And in my solo records, the lyrical ideas were moving away from conventional pop. But Utopia were now down to a quartet and I thought, “I’ll get the band to do most of the backup, and I’ll write songs that should be on the radio now but aren’t.” My least favourite kind of song is a song about a song. The Verb “To Love” isn’t about love songs, it’s about the meaning of a word that people use a lot, and Cliché isn’t about songwriting, it’s about expressing your true feelings and how sometimes we either don’t have the words or don’t go to a whole lot of effort to find the words.\n\nUTOPIA: Cosmic Convoy (from the unreleased Disco Jets, 1976 – available on the import-only Rhino double-CD, Demos & Lost Albums, 2001)\n\nGuitar-rock and disco meet in outer space.\n\nIt was the era of Star Wars and that whole Spielberg/ George Lucas science fiction/fantasy thing. We thought, “Let’s take some pop trends and write little instrumentals for them.” Bearsville said they were going to release it, but they never got around to it. In a sense it was like house music 10 years too soon.\n\nMEAT LOAF: Bat Out Of Hell (1977)\n\nSpringsteen meets Wagner on this zillion-selling opus. Songwriter Jim Steinman has called Rundgren a genius. He also marvelled at how brutal he was with Meat Loaf.\n\nI’m sure Steinman’s story of me telling Meat Loaf to go sit in the corner was embellished, but probably in essence he was correct. The problem wouldn’t have been between me and Meat Loaf, it would have been the fact that there were already a couple of cooks in the kitchen. Meat Loaf was singing it, and his name was on it, but this was Steinman’s baby. Meat Loaf was just the third guy making suggestions about how things should go. I have a lot of sympathy for him in that regard, but I think the results speak for themselves, and if there’s any hard feelings, geez, I’m sorry Meat Loaf.\n\nUTOPIA: Communion With The Sun (from Ra, 1977)\n\nAt the height of punk, Utopia release a concept suite about an Egyptian god. Cue stage pyrotechnics.\n\nWe were now down to a quartet and focusing a little bit more on songs. It wasn’t just big, long individual solos; it was a sort of progressive pop with hooks like Kansas or Yes. We were hoping that would be our ticket. And the ante had been raised with regard to stage presentation – you had ELO with the spinning piano and the drums on forklifts, and Kiss had the 30-foot-high pillars of flame. So we figured a good way to get an audience was with spectacle. We played some pretty big places in those days.\n\nUTOPIA: Love is The Answer (from Oops! Wrong Planet, 1977)\n\nA hit for England Dan and John Ford Coley.\n\nThis album was a little bit new wave-inflected. The whole milieu was changing. There were two ways to go: disco or pop-rock. Punk was starting to come around, but we weren’t going to go neanderthal, although the way we dressed on the sleeve was sort of punk. We were making a gag about it. Live, we’d come out dressed as we were on the back cover, in black jeans and white T-shirts, and be our own opening act. Then we’d go back and don our fancy costumes for the big production afterwards. But our label wasn’t even trying at this point.\n\nAll The Children Sing (from Hermit Of Mink Hollow, 1978)\n\nA return to TR’s do-it-all approach.\n\nI played everything on this album. The hardship was that, in my studio in Woodstock, the control room was up a flight of stairs, so when I did the drums, I was constantly running up and down. When I made a mistake I’d have to go up and stop the tape machine and start over, so getting the drums done was pretty much a sprinting exercise. My biggest problem was that, as a drummer, I tend not to be able to lock into a click-track very well. That’s why there’s generally a bunch of slop in what I do.\n\nCan We Still Be Friends? (from Hermit Of Mink Hollow, 1978)\n\nA beauteous ballad covered by Rod Stewart, Robert Palmer and Colin Blunstone. Recorded in the wake of Todd’s split from Bebe Buell, Hermit was his Blood On The Tracks.\n\nThe reason my voice sounds deeper is my testicles finally dropped. No, it actually came about from me constantly singing on the road. People would like to believe this is a song dissecting a real relationship but if someone was looking at my personal history, knew the personalities involved and how I felt, they wouldn’t assume it was autobiographical because the person that the song would have ostensibly been about, I never want to see again. Because they’re such a drain. If it was autobiographical it would have said, “Can we not be friends?”\n\nUTOPIA: Deface The Music (1980)\n\nJust after this album of Beatles pastiches was released, Lennon was murdered by Rundgren obsessive Mark Chapman, who was arrested wearing a Hermit Of Mink Hollow promo T-shirt and with a copy of Runt: The Ballad Of Todd Rundgren on a table in his hotel bedroom.\n\nWe recorded I Just Wanna Touch You for a movie that Utopia appeared in and played on called The Roadie. The roadie was Meat Loaf, and the act that he was roadie for was Alice Cooper. I’d been friends with Vince Furnier for a long time, so it was an opportunity for us to do something together. So we came up with a song, then they decided they didn’t want to put it on. They said, “It sounds too much like The Beatles and they’ve been real litigious lately, so they might sue us.” We thought that was ridiculous. We also thought, “Hey, if The Beatles sue us that would be a great way to get publicity.” So we said, “Let’s do a whole Beatles record.” We did the entire Beatles career in one record.\n\nTime Heals/Tiny Demons (1981)\n\nA bonus single with 1981 LP, Healing. Time Heals was the second video played on MTV, after Buggles’ Video Killed The Radio Star.\n\nWhen MTV came around, I was already making videos, some of which were like the stuff you’d see on MTV, and some of which featured more abstract stuff. Healing was about something more transcendent than me trying to come terms with the whole John Lennon/Mark Chapman thing. Through my aggressive experimentation of the pharmaceutical and spiritual kind, I’d acquired some side effects: an overdeveloped self-consciousness and a little hypochondria. So I made a record to confront these things.\n\nBang The Drum All Day (from The Ever Popular Tortured Artist Effect, 1982)\n\nA Stateside sports event standby; the Hey Ya! of the ‘80s.\n\nBearsville gave so little of a shit over my records at this point that they never bothered to put out singles, even though there were probably a couple of songs on that album that were concise and hooky. But this one became a Friday drive-time song on American radio, because of one line in it about pounding on the drum like it was the boss’ head. Eventually it found its way into sporting events. But the only money that I get from it is via its status as a party anthem. It gets used in movie trailers a lot, and there’s a mechanical license for the use of that. I get no record royalties from it at all.\n\nA CAPPELLA (1985)\n\nTwo decades before Björk’s Medulla (2004), a whole album of music created from vocals.\n\nThis was made with voices and a few other sounds that you could produce with your body like handclaps and footstomping – but no instruments. Björk did it, too? Well, there’s nothing new under the sun. It had its challenges. One of the things that gave me the idea was that I finally had a sampler, something that I could sing into and then play like a keyboard. I wouldn’t have considered making it otherwise, because having to imitate all the instruments would have been too much of an ordeal.\n\nXTC: Skylarking (1987)\n\nRundgren rescues XTC’s career, but his monomania almost sends Andy Partridge spiralling towards a nervous breakdown.\n\nThe band, and Andy Partridge in particular, had gotten used to a certain way of working, which was to go into the studio without any target date to finish, and just noodle around until they ran out of money or patience. I was aware of the band’s modus operandi, and also of the fact that the end result was losing market share, so for the first time in their career they were compelled by their label to take seriously the input of a producer. But it didn’t go over well with Andy. He was so miffed by it that it blinded him to what was going on musically, so when he got back to England he started trashing me and the record. In spite of that it became the record that salvaged their career. I was disappointed by Andy’s reaction, but I also had a great deal of confidence in the quality of the record, so I said, “It’s your tough luck.”\n\nThe Want Of A Nail (from Nearly Human, 1989)\n\nRecorded live in the studio, with Rundgren as Nelson Riddle. Features Bobby Womack on joint-lead vocals.\n\nI asked Peter Gabriel and Elvis Costello if they wanted to be that second voice, and they either couldn’t or wouldn’t, so I got Bobby, who’s always had one of my favourite R&B voices, to do it. The musicians would show up early and start learning the song. Then we’d refine and hone it, and by the afternoon we’d start doing takes until our voices were gone. This was the way music used to be made. Frank Sinatra records are basically Frank and the orchestra playing and singing at the same time, and what you hear is literally what happened in the studio.\n\nWorldwide Epiphany (from No World Order, 1993)\n\nTR-I is born (again). From the world’s first interactive CD.\n\nThe live shows, notably the 1994 one at The Forum, were part of the world’s first interactive music tour, audience members triggering samples with stage-wired gadgets. The term “interactive music” quickly got devalued after this, and any time a musical artist put out a CD-Rom, it was considered interactive, but my idea was that you could literally change the music yourself. It required a lot of labour-intensive preparation. When I first took the concept out live, it was a nightmare. At the first shows I wound up inviting the audience in out of the rain and playing acoustic songs for them. By the time we got to London, it had been rebuilt and it became a fun show to do.\n\nEspresso (All Jacked Up) (from The Individualist, 1995)\n\nAnother return to simple Toddsongs.\n\nThis would have been a good single, except it’s a little long. It was about the interactive tour; actually, it was about a tour that I had done through Europe with Ringo Starr as well. That was when I discovered the value of coffee. Previous to that it made me too crazy, but with all the travelling and jet lag, I started developing a taste for it: I have a good shot in the morning and another if I’m lagging. So it was a paean to a new drug. Now I’m a connoisseur.\n\nWITH A TWIST (1997)\n\nTodd goes lounge.\n\nI had a bee in my bonnet about the Latin American market. Since I’d been playing a lot of lounge music, I thought, “Let’s do a bossa nova record.” It was supposed to sound like an old Verve record, where you had big orchestrations and background singers; the kind of highly-crafted record that people don’t make anymore.\n\nMary & The Holy Ghost (from One Long Year, 2000)\n\nA little bit neo-classical, a little bit drum’n’techno: Rundgren had been listening to Goldie and Tricky.\n\nI was trying not to think in terms of album concepts but of pieces of music, and getting enough to turn into a collection. It was an opportunity to dabble in some of the music that other people were now making their living at, that I’d just glossed over. All of those little experiments on A Wizard, A True Star and Todd were now becoming genres, so I thought, “Let’s dabble with this,” since I do have a comfort level for that stuff.\n\nLIARS (2004)\n\nRundgren’s response to 9/11 and Bush’s bombing of Iraq. It is his strongest album for a quarter-century.\n\nFuture and Wondering came from listening to the music on TV car commercials, and Stereolab, who sounded to me like a jazzy Cocteau Twins. I was trying to be a cheerleader for the concept that truth is valuable. Once the planes went into the building on 9/11, it wasn’t just our sense of wellbeing that went out the door; it was our sense of reality. And then we bombed Baghdad and we were told one big fuckin’ lie.\n\nARENA (2008)\n\nTodd’s 21st solo LP, and 35th if you include his Nazz and Utopia albums.\n\nIt’s just me, but it sounds like a band. I wouldn’t mind being back in that kind of venue (arenas) because of the kinds of things you can do with production. You can make your shows more interesting. It’s something between prog rock and pop. It’s got very hooky songs, big, singalong choruses and melodic guitar solos; essentially the kind of music that works well in an arena. I called it Arena because I figure it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy: if I make a successful arena rock record, I’ll wind up playing arenas!"
