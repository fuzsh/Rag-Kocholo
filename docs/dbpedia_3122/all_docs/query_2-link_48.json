        "text": "SiM performs Attack on Titan’s opening theme song The Rumbling and switches to a new record label, Pony Canyon.\n\nIn conjunction with the airing of the action anime “Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2” (Shingeki no Kyojin) on January 10, the opening theme song was revealed at last! To our surprise, the heavy song which is titled The Rumbling was performed by no other than the reggae-punk band SiM!\n\nWithout a doubt, this is one of the heaviest theme songs we’ve seen so far in Attack on Titan, and it’s truly welcomed considering how the anime is nearing its climactic end.\n\nDespite SiM’s unique musical rock style, the band made sure to stay faithful to the anime by creating a work that integrates with the world of Attack on Titan, as explained by vocalist MAH who wrote the lyrics.\n\nOur translation of MAH’s comment:\n\nAttack on Titan—for which we had the chance to interpret its new opening theme song—is a piece of work with a singular world identity already established by its numerous famous theme songs. Faithfully, yet in our own approach, we tried our best to express the new world depicted in this anime season. We poured all our love into this song while still respecting as much as possible the work that has been done before us, its conventions, and the lineage we became a part of. We sincerely hope that Attack on Titan’s fans will enjoy this song and its lyrics.\n\nThe TV-size (90-second) version of The Rumbling is now available on digital platforms for purchase and streaming.\n\nBesides the honorable opportunity to provide the opening theme song, SiM is now a part of the record label Pony Canyon. Notably, Pony Canyon is a label that has been involved with Attack on Titan’s music side of things (among others) since the inception of the anime.\n\nThe reason why SiM joined Pony Canyon, as explained by MAH, is because “[They] allow us to truly create what we want, more so than ever!”. And for a rare specimen like SiM, we hope this will lead to more intriguing music."
