Within the last year, the controversial drill-hop artist has: been in and out legal trouble countless times (including suspicion of murder); authored innumerable threatening tweets (most notably a very public feud with Katy Perry); signed to a major label (Interscope); started his own record label (Glory Boyz Entertainment); released his major label debut (Finally Rich); collaborated with Kanye West on Yeezus; subsequently dissed Yeezus; signed to Gucci Mane’s record label 1017 Brick Squad Records; and most recently, on the day of his birthday, released the new mixtape Bang Pt. 2.\n\nWell, add one more notch to the bedpost, because Keef has announced (via Twitter) the September 12 release date of a new newer mixtape: Almighty So. Since mixtape release dates are about as reliable as Chief Keef baking you a cake, I wouldn’t put too much stock in this, but what the hell do I know.\n\nGet a taste for Almighty So with the leaked single “Round Da Rosey” below:\n\n• Chief Keef: http://www.chiefkeef.com\n\n• Interscope: http://www.interscope.com\n\nRelated\n\nFeatures\n\n2018: Favorite 50 Songs\n\nJams and non-jams for EVERYONE in EVERY COUNTRY on EARTH\n\nChocolate Grinder\n\nLISTEN: Chief Keef -\n\nBack From The Dead 3\n\ncolumn\n\nFavorite Rap Mixtapes of July 2018\n\nFrom 03 Greedo & Rabit to Pink Siifu & Big Kahuna OG (and back to 03 Greedo)"
