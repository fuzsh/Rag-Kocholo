        "text": "I have seen various character studies on various characters but none really on Jasnah by herself. I have also seen what I feel is misunderstandings regarding the character. So I decided to take every instance of Jasnah in all three books, in chronological order, in an effort to share with you all what I see in this character and perhaps show you all the humanity within her.\n\nI will go quote by quote showing how she is viewed at face value in a scene, and then I will provide context based on in book information and/or Words of Brandon. I hope by providing context to the scenes she is seen as emotionless as well as calling attention to the scenes where we do see Jasnah’s emotions and how many times we see them will demonstrate a deeper understanding of the character. This will allow people to hear my reading of her, but at the same time have the scenes referenced readily available for people to read and form their own thoughts. Some quotes will be trimmed at places due to descriptions of the surroundings (such as buildings, and etc) that have no content relevant to this thread. Where I skip will be denoted by “....”. I will spoil tag each quote for length and reading sanity. I am unsure if anyone will go through the effort of reading all of this all the way through, but if you do, I look forward to your thoughts. If you disagree, I also look forward to your thoughts though I ask you to read the scene, and reference the scene when explaining why you disagreed. I went through the trouble of including the scene for ease of access so I would appreciate if that extra work was employed in response.\n\nAfter typing all this up, going through all of Way of Kings and all of Words of Radiance, I have come to two conclusions. First, this took waaaaaay longer than I expected, and second, there are waaaaay more scenes of Jasnah than I thought lol. Because of this, I decided to post what I had so far (all of Way of Kings and all of Words of Radiance). If there is any interest in this, I will finish up with Oathbringer. If this however gets viewed and then is quickly lost among forum uncommented on, then ah well I did my best.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 62\n\nAfter chasing Jasnah Kholin from town to town for the better part of six months, Shallan was beginning to to think she’d never catch the woman. Was the princess avoiding her? No, that didn’t seem likely - Shallan just wasn’t important enough to wait for. Brightness Jasnah Kholin was one of the most powerful women in the world. And one of the most infamous. She was the only member of a faithful royal house who was a professed heretic\n\nSo this is our first introduction to Jasnah. From the perspective of Shallan, who never met her, never saw her, and bases her impression on some of the books she read in the library and rumors about the princess of the strongest kingdom on the planet. To her, this Jasnah is the most powerful and intimidating woman in the world. Shallan thinks she is nothing before such a woman. That Jasnah is the only member of a faithful house that is a vocal heretic\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 65\n\n“Young miss” the captain said to her after conferring with his men, “Your Brightness Jasnah, she’ll undoubtedly be at the Conclave, you see”\n\n“Oh, where the Palanaeum is?”\n\n“Yes, yes. And the king lives there too. It’s the center of the city, so to speak. Except it’s on top.” He scratched his chin “Well, anyway, Brightness Jasnah Kholin is sister to a king, she will stay nowhere else, not in Kharbranth.”\n\nNow Shallan is having her world view of Jasnah supported. Jasnah is sister to the king. Of course she would stay where a king lives. However we find out later that the reason is she is researching the end of the world and doing all she can to stop it. Whereas public opinion assumes she is royalty and expects to go where royalty goes, the reality is she is staying there to pursue knowledge to save the world. Same could be said about Shallan chasing her. Jasnah is being dismissive and flippant towards Shallan by not waiting for her. The reality is Jasnah is deeply fearful of the impending end of the world, and cannot spare any time from pursuing her research. The outside view shows her to be a selfish and self important princess, the inside view shows her to be a altruistic and self sacrificing scientist trying to avert disaster.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 71\n\nShe went over to present herself to Jasnah. The woman was a legend. Even Shallan - living in the remote estates of Jah Keved - had heard of the Alethi king’s brilliant, heretic sister. Jasnah was only thirty-four years old, yet many felt she would already have obtained the cap of a master scholar if it weren’t for her vocal denunciations of religion. Most specifically, she denounced the devotaries, the various religious congregations that proper Vorin people joined\n\nImproper quips would not serve Shallan well here. She would have to be proper. Wardship to a woman of great renown was the best way to be schooled in the feminine arts: music, painting, writing, logic and science. It was much like how a young man would train in the honor guard of a brightlord he respected.\n\nShallan had originally written to Jasnah requesting a wardship in desperation; she hadn’t actually expected the woman to reply in the affirmative. When she had - via a letter commanding Shallan to attend her in Dumadari in two weeks - Shallan had been shocked. She’d been chasing the woman ever since.\n\nJasnah was a heretic. Would she demand that Shallan renounce her faith? She doubted she could do such a thing. Worin teachings regarding one’s Glory and Calling had been one of her few refuges during the difficult days, when her father had been at his worst\n\nAgain from Shallan’s perspective, Jasnah is beyond any “normal” human beings. She is a scholary juggernaut that is a vocal heretic. A heretic that could try to corrupt Shallan from her religion, the only thing that gave her solace during her dark days with her father. A later scene with Taravangian that I will cover will show that Jasnah actually does not seek to convert anyone to her “heretical ways”. The reality is people frequently confront and attempt to convert her. She just defends her own rationale.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 83\n\nShallan had not expected Jasnah Kholin to be so beautiful. It was a stately, mature beauty—as one might find in the portrait of some historical scholar. Shallan realized that she’d naively been expecting Jasnah to be an ugly spinster, like the stern matrons who had tutored her years ago. How else could one picture a heretic well into her mid-thirties and still unmarried? Jasnah was nothing like that. She was tall and slender, with clear skin, narrow black eyebrows, and thick, deep onyx hair. She wore part of it up, wrapped around a small, scroll-shaped golden ornament with two long hairpins holding it in place. The rest tumbled down behind her neck in small, tight curls. Even twisted and curled as it was, it came down to Jasnah’s shoulders—if left unbound, it would be as long as Shallan’s hair, reaching past the middle of her back. She had a squarish face and discriminating pale violet eyes.\n\nShe was listening to a man dressed in robes of burnt orange and white, the Kharbranthian royal colors. Brightness Kholin was several fingers taller than the man—apparently, the Alethi reputation for height was no exaggeration. Jasnah glanced at Shallan, noting her, then returned to her conversation. Stormfather! This woman was the sister of a king. Reserved, statuesque, dressed immaculately in blue and silver. Like Shallan’s dress, Jasnah’s buttoned up the sides and had a high collar, though Jasnah had a much fuller chest than Shallan. The skirts were loose below the waist, falling generously to the floor. Her sleeves were long and stately, and the left one was buttoned up to hide her safehand. On her freehand was a distinctive piece of jewelry: two rings and a bracelet connected by several chains, holding a triangular group of gemstones across the back of the hand. A Soulcaster—the word was used for both the people who performed the process and the fabrial that made it possible. Shallan edged into the room, trying to get a better look at the large, glowing gemstones. Her heart began to beat a little faster. The Soulcaster looked identical to the one she and her brothers had found in the inside pocket of her father’s coat. Jasnah and the man in robes began walking in Shallan’s direction, still talking. How would Jasnah react, now that her ward had finally caught up to her? Would she be angry because of Shallan’s tardiness? Shallan couldn’t be blamed for that, but people often expect irrational things from their inferiors….\n\nAs Jasnah grew near, Shallan could hear some of what she was saying. “… realize that this action might prompt an unfavorable reaction from the devotaries?” the woman said, speaking in Alethi. It was very near to Shallan’s native Veden, and she’d been taught to speak it well during her childhood. “Yes, Brightness,” said the robed man. He was elderly, with a wispy white beard, and had pale grey eyes. His open, kindly face seemed very concerned, and he wore a squat, cylindrical hat that matched the orange and white of his robes. Rich robes. Was this some kind of royal steward, perhaps? No. Those gemstones on his fingers, the way he carried himself, the way other lighteyed attendants deferred to him … Stormfather! Shallan thought. This has to be the king himself! Not Jasnah’s brother, Elhokar, but the king of Kharbranth. Taravangian. Shallan hastily performed an appropriate curtsy, which Jasnah noted. “The ardents have much sway here, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said with a smooth voice. “As do I,” the king said. “You needn’t worry about me.” “Very well,” Jasnah said. “Your terms are agreeable. Lead me to the location, and I shall see what can be done. If you will excuse me as we walk, however, I have someone to attend to.” Jasnah made a curt motion toward Shallan, waving her to join them. “Of course, Brightness,” the king said. He seemed to defer to Jasnah. Kharbranth was a very small kingdom—just a single city—while Alethkar was one of the world’s most powerful. An Alethi princess might well outrank a Kharbranthian king in real terms, however protocol would have it. Shallan hurried to catch up to Jasnah, who walked a little behind the king as he began to speak to his attendants.\n\n“Brightness,” Shallan said. “I am Shallan Davar, whom you asked to meet you. I deeply regret not being able to get to you in Dumadari.” “The fault was not yours,” Jasnah said with a wave of the fingers. “I didn’t expect that you would make it in time. I wasn’t certain where I would be going after Dumadari when I sent you that note, however.” Jasnah wasn’t angry; that was a good sign. Shallan felt some of her anxiety recede. “I am impressed by your tenacity, child,” Jasnah continued. “I honestly didn’t expect you to follow me this far. After Kharbranth, I was going to forgo leaving you notes, as I’d presumed that you’d have given up. Most do so after the first few stops.” Most? Then it was a test of some sort? And Shallan had passed? “Yes indeed,” Jasnah continued, voice musing. “Perhaps I will actually allow you to petition me for a place as my ward.” Shallan almost stumbled in shock. Petition her? Wasn’t that what she’d already done? “Brightness,” Shallan said, “I thought that … Well, your letter …” Jasnah eyed her. “I gave you leave to meet me, Miss Davar. I did not promise to take you on. The training and care of a ward is a distraction for which I have little tolerance or time at the present. But you have traveled far. I will entertain your request, though understand that my requirements are strict.” Shallan covered a grimace. “No tantrum,” Jasnah noted. “That is a good sign.” “Tantrum, Brightness? From a lighteyed woman?” “You’d be surprised,” Jasnah said dryly. “But attitude alone will not earn your place. Tell me, how extensive is your education?” “Extensive in some areas,” Shallan said. Then she hesitantly added, “Extensively lacking in others.” “Very well,” Jasnah said. Ahead, the king seemed to be in a hurry, but he was old enough that even an urgent walk was still slow. “Then we shall do an evaluation. Answer truthfully and do not exaggerate, as I will soon discover your lies. Feign no false modesty, either. I haven’t the patience for a simperer.” “Yes, Brightness.” “We shall begin with music. How would you judge your skill?” “I have a good ear, Brightness,” Shallan said honestly. “I’m best with voice, though I have been trained on the zither and the pipes. I would be far from the best you’d heard, but I’d also be far from the worst. I know most historical ballads by heart.” “Give me the refrain from ‘Lilting Adrene.’ ” “Here?” “I’m not fond of repeating myself, child.” Shallan blushed, but began to sing. It wasn’t her finest performance, but her tone was pure and she didn’t stumble over any of the words.\n\n“Good,” Jasnah said as Shallan paused for a breath. “Languages?” Shallan fumbled for a moment, bringing her attention away from frantically trying to remember the next verse. Languages? “I can speak your native Alethi, obviously,” Shallan said. “I have a passable reading knowledge of Thaylen and good spoken Azish. I can make myself understood in Selay, but not read it.” Jasnah made no comment either way. Shallan began to grow nervous. “Writing?” Jasnah asked. “I know all of the major, minor, and topical glyphs and can paint them calligraphically.” “So can most children.” “The glyphwards that I paint are regarded by those who know me as quite impressive.” “Glyphwards?” Jasnah said. “I had reason to believe you wanted to be a scholar, not a purveyor of superstitious nonsense.” “I have kept a journal since I was a child,” Shallan continued, “in order to practice my writing skills.” “Congratulations,” Jasnah said. “Should I need someone to write a treatise on their stuffed pony or give an account of an interesting pebble they discovered, I shall send for you. Is there nothing you can offer that shows you have true skill?” Shallan blushed. “With all due respect, Brightness, you have a letter from me yourself, and it was persuasive enough to make you grant me this audience.” “A valid point,” Jasnah said, nodding. “It took you long enough to make it. How is your training in logic and its related arts?” “I am accomplished in basic mathematics,” Shallan said, still flustered, “and I often helped with minor accounts for my father. I have read through the complete works of Tormas, Nashan, Niali the Just, and—of course—Nohadon.” “Placini?” Who? “No.” “Gabrathin, Yustara, Manaline, Syasikk, Shauka-daughter-Hasweth?” Shallan cringed and shook her head again. That last name was obviously Shin. Did the Shin people even have logicmasters? Did Jasnah really expect her wards to have studied such obscure texts? “I see,” Jasnah said.\n\n“Well, what of history?” History. Shallan shrank down even further. “I … This is one of the areas where I’m obviously deficient, Brightness. My father was never able to find a suitable tutor for me. I read the history books he owned. …” “Which were?” “The entire set of Barlesha Lhan’s Topics, mostly.” Jasnah waved her freehand dismissively. “Barely worth the time spent scribing them. A popular survey of historical events at best.” “I apologize, Brightness.” “This is an embarrassing hole. History is the most important of the literary subarts. One would think that your parents would have taken specific care in this area, if they’d hoped to submit you to study under a historian like myself.” “My circumstances are unusual, Brightness.” “Ignorance is hardly unusual, Miss Davar. The longer I live, the more I come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind. There are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts.” Shallan blushed again. She’d realized she had some deficiencies, but Jasnah had unreasonable expectations. She said nothing, continuing to walk beside the taller woman. How long was this hallway, anyway? She was so flustered she didn’t even look at the paintings they passed. They turned a corner, walking deeper into the mountainside. “Well, let us move on to science, then,” Jasnah said, tone displeased. “What can you say of yourself there?” “I have the reasonable foundation in the sciences you might expect of a young woman my age,” Shallan said, more stiffly than she would have liked. “Which means?” “I can speak with skill about geography, geology, physics, and chemistry. I’ve made particular study of biology and botany, as I was able to pursue them with a reasonable level of independence on my father’s estates. But if you expect me to be able to solve Fabrisan’s Conundrum with a wave of my hand, I suspect you shall be disappointed.” “Have I not a right to make reasonable demands of my potential students, Miss Davar?” “Reasonable? Your demands are about as reasonable as the ones made of the Ten Heralds on Proving Day! With all due respect, Brightness, you seem to want potential wards to be master scholars already. I may be able to find a pair of eighty-year-old ardents in the city who might fit your requirements. They could interview for the position, though they may have trouble hearing well enough to answer your questions.”\n\n“I see,” Jasnah replied. “And do you speak with such pique to your parents as well?” Shallan winced. Her time spent with the sailors had loosened her tongue far too much. Had she traveled all this way only to offend Jasnah? She thought of her brothers, destitute, keeping up a tenuous façade back home. Would she have to return to them in defeat, having squandered this opportunity? “I did not speak to them this way, Brightness. Nor should I to you. I apologize.” “Well, at least you are humble enough to admit fault. Still, I am disappointed. How is it that your mother considered you ready for a wardship?” “My mother passed away when I was just a child, Brightness.” “And your father soon remarried. Malise Gevelmar, I believe.” Shallan started at her knowledge. House Davar was ancient, but only of middling power and importance. The fact that Jasnah knew the name of Shallan’s stepmother said a lot about her. “My stepmother passed away recently. She didn’t send me to be your ward. I took this initiative upon myself.” “My condolences,” Jasnah said. “Perhaps you should be with your father, seeing to his estates and comforting him, rather than wasting my time.” The men walking ahead turned down another side passage. Jasnah and Shallan followed, entering a smaller corridor with an ornate red and yellow rug, mirrors hanging on the walls. Shallan turned to Jasnah. “My father has no need of me.” Well, that was true. “But I have great need of you, as this interview itself has proven. If ignorance galls you so much, can you in good conscience pass up the opportunity to rid me of mine?” “I’ve done so before, Miss Davar. You are the twelfth young woman to ask me for a wardship this year.” Twelve? Shallan thought. In one year? And she’d assumed that women would stay away from Jasnah because of her antagonism toward the devotaries....\n\n“The dangers of living in a building cut directly into the rock,” Jasnah said, striding forward. “When did this happen?” Apparently she hadn’t been summoned to the city specifically for this purpose; the king was simply taking advantage of her presence. “During the recent highstorm, Brightness,” the king said. He shook his head, making his drooping, thin white mustache tremble. “The palace architects might be able to cut a way into the room, but it would take time, and the next highstorm is scheduled to hit in just a few days. Beyond that, breaking in might bring down more of the ceiling.” “I thought Kharbranth was protected from the highstorms, Your Majesty,” Shallan said, causing Jasnah to shoot her a glance. “The city is sheltered, young woman,” the king said. “But the stone mountain behind us is buffeted quite strongly. Sometimes it causes avalanches on that side, and that can cause the entire mountainside to shake.” He glanced at the ceiling. “Cave-ins are very rare, and we thought this area was quite safe, but …” “But it is rock,” Jasnah said, “and there is no telling if a weak vein lurks just beyond the surface.” She inspected the monolith that had fallen from the ceiling. “This will be difficult. I will probably lose a very valuable focal stone.” “I—” the king began, wiping his brow again. “If only we had a Shardblade—” Jasnah cut him off with a wave of the hand. “I was not seeking to renegotiate our bargain, Your Majesty. Access to the Palanaeum is worth the cost. You will want to send someone for wet rags. Have the majority of the servants move down to the other end of the hallway. You may wish to wait there yourself.” “I will stay here,” the king said, causing his attendants to object, including a large man wearing a black leather cuirass, probably his bodyguard. The king silenced them by raising his wrinkled hand. “I will not hide like a coward when my granddaughter is trapped.” No wonder he was so anxious. Jasnah didn’t argue further, and Shallan could see from her eyes that it was of no consequence to her if the king risked his life. The same apparently went for Shallan, for Jasnah didn’t order her away….\n\n“Miss Davar,” she said, “what method would you use to ascertain the mass of this stone?” Shallan blinked. “Well, I suppose I’d ask His Majesty. His architects probably calculated it.” Jasnah cocked her head. “An elegant response. Did they do that, Your Majesty?” “Yes, Brightness Kholin,” the king said. “It’s roughly fifteen thousand kavals.” Jasnah eyed Shallan. “A point in your favor, Miss Davar. A scholar knows not to waste time rediscovering information already known. It’s a lesson I sometimes forget.” Shallan felt herself swell at the words. She already had an inkling that Jasnah did not give such praise lightly. Did this mean that the woman was still considering her as a ward?...\n\nLiterally turn any substance into any other one. How it must grate on the ardents that such a powerful, holy relic was in the hands of someone outside the ardentia. And a heretic no less!...\n\nJasnah opened her eyes, blinking, as if momentarily confused by her location. She took a deep breath, and didn’t cough. Indeed, she actually smiled, as if enjoying the scent of the smoke. Jasnah turned to Shallan, focusing on her. “You are still waiting for a response. I’m afraid you will not like what I say.” “But you haven’t finished your testing of me yet,” Shallan said, forcing herself to be bold. “Surely you won’t give judgment until you have.” “I haven’t finished?” Jasnah asked, frowning. “You didn’t ask me about all of the feminine arts. You left out painting and drawing.” “I have never had much use for them.” “But they are of the arts,” Shallan said, feeling desperate. This was where she was most accomplished! “Many consider the visual arts the most refined of them all. I brought my portfolio. I would show you what I can do.” Jasnah pursed her lips. “The visual arts are frivolity. I have weighed the facts, child, and I cannot accept you. I’m sorry.” Shallan’s heart sank. “Your Majesty,” Jasnah said to the king, “I would like to go to the Palanaeum.” “Now?” the king said, cradling his granddaughter. “But we are going to have a feast—” “I appreciate the offer,” Jasnah said, “but I find myself with an abundance of everything but time.” “Of course,” the king said. “I will take you personally. Thank you for what you’ve done. When I heard that you had requested entrance …” He continued to babble at Jasnah, who followed him wordlessly down the hallway, leaving Shallan behind...\n\nWe begin this lengthy scene with Shallan’s overawed first impression of Jasnah. She expected a withered, ugly, old spinster because she is a “heretic well into her mid-thirties and still unmarried”. I think this commentary is to help us see the levels of opposition Jasnah has to deal with just to exist. She does not believe in the Vorin religion, and she (for whatever reason which there are many theories) chooses to be unmarried. Those two simple facts are enough to create an image of a crotchety, and bitter woman for Shallan. The revelation that Jasnah looks nothing of the sort is enough to stop Shallan in her tracks. She doesn’t fit the stereotype that only “unattractive women” remain single. The reality is she is quite attractive, and shows that her value is not only in her looks. She can be single and that be ok despite outside pressure pushing her to do otherwise.\n\nShallan then expresses her concern that Jasnah will scold her for being late despite it being Jasnah’s continual travel that caused it. Shallan rationalizes this as “ah well, she is so high above me, people like that always expect irrational things from their inferiors. This point is later disproven, but also slightly validated later on. If we skip a head a bit Jasnah confirms she does not hold Shallan’s arrival against her at all. In fact she is impressed. Now admittedly Jasnah grills Shallan and has very high expectations, but again there is context to this. First, Jasnah has been repeatedly pursued by multiple wards. A good chunk of those wards either wanted to steal the soulcaster for the Ardentia, gain notoriety for having a wardship with a famed heretic thereby increasing their chance of marriage, or manipulate Jasnah into giving them connections into the Alethi royalty. These are all types of individuals Jasnah has no time for given the pressing nature and importance of her research. So all the paces she puts Shallan through are ultimately warranted. I also think it says something of Jasnah’s character that when an individual does accomplish something noteworthy, she gives that accomplish its due, like when Shallan reasons that Taravangian’s own people already determined the mass of the stone.\n\nNow going back a bit, Shallan overhears Jasnah speaking to Taravangian. We find out they are discussing Jasnah using her soulcaster to turn the boulder to smoke to free Taravangian’s granddaughter from a cave in. Jasnah cautions Taravangian that her helping him, and him providing her access to the Palananeum in exchange could raise the ire of the Vorin church. She knows Taravangian is a practicing Vorin. She also could easily provide the money necessary to have free use of the Palaneum without any bargain of helping the king being necessary. She is desperate to research the coming end of the world yet she warns the king of the possible fall out with the church so he won’t suffer on her account, and takes the time to save the kings granddaughter when she has no need to accomplish her goals. So while from the outside it could seem that Jasnah merely saved the granddaughter as an exchange of services to get what she wants that lies in the Palanaeum, the inside view shows she could have gotten it regardless without any concern for Taravangian nor saving his granddaughter, yet she does so anyway. In my opinion that is Jasnah lowkey helping others with no expectation of gratitude.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 119\n\nWho was Jasnah Kholin? Not one to be cowed, certainly. She was a woman to the bone, master of the feminine arts, but not by any means delicate. Such a woman would appreciate Shallan’s determination. She would listen to another request for wardship, assuming it was presented properly. Jasnah was also a rationalist, a woman with the audacity to deny the existence of the Almighty himself based on her own reasoning. Jasnah would appreciate strength, but only if it was shaped by logic.\n\nPretty clear and upfront. Jasnah Kholin has had to fight in order to exist as the woman she is in the time period and culture she grew up in. As result, and as Shallan is realizing, Jasnah respects determination, intelligence, and strength.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 125\n\n“Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” he replied. “I’d hope she’s heard my name, though, since I’ve requested an audience with her several times.” Shallan nodded, rising. “You want to try to convert her, I presume?” “She presents a unique challenge. I don’t think I could live with myself if I didn’t at least try to persuade her.”\n\nOur first hint at Jasnah’s regular interactions with the Vorin Church. They either want to steal the soulcaster from her, or will use her as a trophy to say “hey! I converted the heretic!”. No respect for her beliefs. No understanding. Yet she is painted as the heretic that will corrupt good Vorin worshippers. This is shown again and elaborated on later in the book.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings Page 127\n\nShallan’s fears were confirmed as Jasnah looked straight at her, then lowered her safehand to her side in a mark of frustration. “So you are here.” Shallan cringed. “The servants told you, then?” “You didn’t think that they would leave someone in my alcove and not warn me?” Behind Jasnah, a small group of parshmen hesitated in the hallway, each carrying an armload of books. “Brightness Kholin,” Shallan said. “I just—” “I have wasted enough time on you already,” Jasnah said, eyes furious. “You will withdraw, Miss Davar. And I will not see you again during my time here. Am I understood?” Shallan’s hopes crumbled. She shrank back. There was a gravity to Jasnah Kholin. One did not disobey her. One need only look into those eyes to understand. “I’m sorry to have bothered you,”...\n\n“Brightness Davar?” asked a hesitant voice. Shallan looked up, realizing she’d been so wrapped in her misery that she hadn’t seen the servant approach. He was a younger man, wearing an all black uniform, no emblem on the breast. Not a master-servant, but perhaps one in training. “Brightness Kholin would like to speak with you.” The young man gestured back down the hallway. To berate me further? Shallan thought with a grimace. But a highlady like Jasnah got what she wanted. Shallan forced herself to stop shaking, then stood. At least she’d been able to keep the tears away; she hadn’t ruined her makeup. She followed the servant back to the lit alcove, satchel clutched before her like a shield on the battlefield. Jasnah Kholin sat in the chair Shallan had been using, stacks of books on the table. Jasnah was rubbing her forehead with her freehand. The Soulcaster rested against the back of her skin, the smokestone dark and cracked. Though Jasnah looked fatigued, she sat with perfect posture, her fine silk dress covering her feet, her safehand held across her lap. Jasnah focused on Shallan, lowering her freehand. “I should not have treated you with such anger, Miss Davar,” she said in a tired voice. “You were simply showing persistence, a trait I normally encourage. Storms alight, I’ve oft been guilty of stubbornness myself. Sometimes we find it hardest to accept in others that which we cling to in ourselves. My only excuse can be that I have put myself under an unusual amount of strain lately.” Shallan nodded in gratitude, though she felt terribly awkward.\n\nJasnah turned to look out of the balcony into the dark space of the Veil. “I know what people say of me. I should hope that I am not as harsh as some say, though a woman could have far worse than a reputation for sternness. It can serve one well.” Shallan had to forcibly keep herself from fidgeting. Should she withdraw? Jasnah shook her head to herself, though Shallan could not guess what thoughts had caused the unconscious gesture. Finally, she turned back to Shallan and waved toward the large, gobletlike bowl on the desk. It held a dozen of Shallan’s spheres. Shallan raised her freehand to her lips in shock. She’d completely forgotten the money. She bowed to Jasnah in thanks, then hurriedly collected the spheres. “Brightness, lest I forget, I should mention that an ardent—Brother Kabsal—came to see you while I waited here. He wished me to pass on his desire to speak with you.” “Not surprising,” Jasnah said. “You seem surprised about the spheres, Miss Davar. I assumed that you were waiting outside to recover them. Is that not why you were so close?” “No, Brightness. I was just settling my nerves.” “Ah.” Shallan bit her lip. The princess appeared to have gotten past her initial tirade. Perhaps … “Brightness,” Shallan said, cringing at her brashness, “what did you think of my letter?” “Letter?” “I …” Shallan glanced at the desk. “Beneath that stack of books, Brightness.” A servant quickly moved aside the stack of books; the parshman must have set it on the paper without noticing. Jasnah picked up the letter, raising an eyebrow, and Shallan hurriedly undid her satchel and placed the spheres in her money pouch. Then she cursed herself for being so quick, as now she had nothing to do but stand and wait for Jasnah to finish reading.\n\n“This is true?” Jasnah said, looking up from the paper. “You are self-trained?” “Yes, Brightness.” “That is remarkable.” “Thank you, Brightness.” “And this letter was a clever maneuver. You correctly assumed that I would respond to a written plea. This shows me your skill with words, and the rhetoric of the letter gives proof that you can think logically and make a good argument.” “Thank you, Brightness,” Shallan said, feeling another surge of hope, mixed with fatigue. Her emotions had been jerked back and forth like a rope being used for a tugging contest. “You should have left the note for me, and withdrawn before I returned.” “But then the note would have been lost beneath that stack of books.” Jasnah raised an eyebrow at her, as if to show that she did not appreciate being corrected. “Very well. The context of a person’s life is important. Your circumstances do not excuse your lack of education in history and philosophy, but leniency is in order. I will allow you to petition me again at a later date, a privilege I have never given any aspiring ward. Once you have a sufficient groundwork in those two subjects, come to me again. If you have improved suitably, I will accept you.” Shallan’s emotions sank. Jasnah’s offer was kindly, but it would take years of study to accomplish what she asked. House Davar would have fallen by then, her family’s lands divided among its creditors, her brothers and herself stripped of title and perhaps enslaved. “Thank you, Brightness,” Shallan said, bowing her head. Jasnah nodded, as if considering the matter closed. Shallan withdrew, walking quietly down the hallway and pulling the cord to ring for the porters. Jasnah had all but promised to accept her at a later date. For most, that would be a great victory. Being trained by Jasnah Kholin—thought by some to be the finest living scholar—would have ensured a bright future. Shallan would have married extremely well, likely to the son of a highprince, and would have found new social circles open to her. Indeed, if Shallan had possessed the time to train under Jasnah, the sheer prestige of a Kholin affiliation might have been enough to save her house. If only.\n\nNow we get to see the first mistake Jasnah makes in the books. Earlier Jasnah has made it clear that she had dismissed Shallan, yet Shallan persists and writes an argument for being taken on as a ward. Jasnah finds her still there and enraged tells her to get out. Despite this, minutes later a servant calls Shallan back. Was it to return Shallan’s money left in the goblet? No, though she does do that as well after. Was it because of the wonderful argument Shallan wrote? No again, yet that does come up after. It is because Jasnah, by herself, realized she had acted unfairly towards Shallan. A “typical” highlady would have just left things as is. Instead Jasnah has a servant search for Shallan, request she come back, and apologizes. The scene shows that Jasnah is exhausted from overworking herself researching (to prevent the end of the world as we later know). She is tired, frustrated and short tempered, but admits that is no excuse for her poor treatment of Shallan. It is then Shallan calls Jasnah’s attention to the argument she wrote. Jasnah then reads it and gives it the credit it is due. She respects well thought out reasoning, determination and tenacity. She gives Shallan the chance to petition again when she is ready. Something Shallan knows is a huge gesture, though given her situation it is not enough.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 140\n\nJasnah sat studying, heedless of the hour, her goblet filled to the brim with pure diamond broams. They were best for light, but less useful in Soulcasting, so weren’t as valuable. Shallan ducked back around. There was a place at the very edge of the alcove’s table where she could sit, hidden by the wall from Jasnah, so she sat there. Perhaps she should have chosen an alcove on another level, but she wanted to keep an eye on the woman. Hopefully Jasnah would spend weeks here studying. Enough time for Shallan to dedicate herself to some fierce cramming. Her ability to memorize pictures and scenes didn’t work as well on text, but she could learn lists and facts at a rate that her tutors had found remarkable. She settled herself in the chair, pulling out the books and arranging them. She rubbed her eyes. It was really quite late, but there wasn’t time to waste. Jasnah had said that Shallan could make another petition when the gaps in her knowledge were filled. Well, Shallan intended to fill those gaps in record time, then present herself again. She’d do it when Jasnah was ready to leave Kharbranth. It was a last, desperate hope, so frail that a strong gust of circumstance seemed likely to topple it. Taking a deep breath, Shallan opened the first of the history books. “I’m never going to be rid of you, am I?” a soft, feminine voice asked. Shallan jumped up, nearly knocking over her books as she spun toward the doorway. Jasnah Kholin stood there, deep blue dress embroidered in silver, its silken sheen reflecting the light of Shallan’s spheres. The Soulcaster was covered by a fingerless black glove to block the bright gemstones. “Brightness,” Shallan said, rising and curtsying in an awkward rush. “I didn’t mean to disturb you. I—” Jasnah quieted her with a wave of the hand. She stepped aside as a parshman entered Shallan’s alcove, carrying a chair. He placed it beside Shallan’s desk, and Jasnah glided over and sat. Shallan tried to judge Jasnah’s mood, but the older woman’s emotions were impossible to read.\n\n“I honestly didn’t want to disturb you.” “I bribed the servants to tell me if you returned to the Veil,” Jasnah said idly, picking up one of Shallan’s tomes, reading the title. “I didn’t want to be interrupted again.” “I—” Shallan looked down, blushing furiously. “Don’t bother apologizing,” Jasnah said. She looked tired; more tired than Shallan felt. Jasnah picked through the books. “A fine selection. You chose well.” “It wasn’t really much of a choice,” Shallan said. “It was just about all the merchant had.” “You intended to study their contents quickly, I assume?” Jasnah said musingly. “Try to impress me one last time before I left Kharbranth?” Shallan hesitated, then nodded. “A clever ploy. I should have put a time restriction on your reapplication.” She looked at Shallan, glancing her over. “You are very determined. That is good. And I know why you wish so desperately to be my ward.” Shallan started. She knew? “Your house has many enemies,” Jasnah continued, “and your father is reclusive. It will be difficult for you to marry well without a tactically sound alliance.” Shallan relaxed, though she tried to keep it from showing. “Let me see your satchel,” Jasnah said. Shallan frowned, resisting the urge to pull it close. “Brightness?” Jasnah held out her hand. “You recall what I said about repeating myself?” Reluctantly, Shallan handed it over. Jasnah carefully removed its contents, neatly lining up the brushes, pencils, pens, jar of lacquer, ink, and solvent. She placed the stacks of paper, the notebooks, and the finished pictures in a line. Then she got out Shallan’s money pouches, noting their emptiness. She glanced at the goblet lamp, counting its contents. She raised an eyebrow. Next, she began to look through Shallan’s pictures. First the loose-leaf ones, where she lingered on Shallan’s picture of Jasnah herself. Shallan watched the woman’s face. Was she pleased? Surprised? Displeased at how much time Shallan spent sketching sailors and serving women? Finally, Jasnah moved on to the sketchbook filled with drawings of plants and animals Shallan had observed during her trip. Jasnah spent the longest on this, reading through each notation.\n\n“Why have you made these sketches?” Jasnah asked at the end. “Why, Brightness? Well, because I wanted to.” She grimaced. Should she have said something profound instead? Jasnah nodded slowly. Then she rose. “I have rooms in the Conclave, granted to me by the king. Gather your things and go there. You look exhausted.” “Brightness?” Shallan asked, rising, a thrill of excitement running through her. Jasnah hesitated at the doorway. “At first meeting, I took you for a rural opportunist, seeking only to ride my name to greater wealth.” “You’ve changed your mind?” “No,” Jasnah said, “there is undoubtedly some of that in you. But we are each many different people, and you can tell much about a person by what they carry with them. If that notebook is any indication, you pursue scholarship in your free time for its own sake. That is encouraging. It is, perhaps, the best argument you could make on your own behalf. “If I cannot be rid of you, then I might as well make use of you. Go and sleep. Tomorrow we will begin early, and you will divide your time between your education and helping me with my studies.” With that, Jasnah withdrew.\n\nIt seems the biggest hallmark of Jasnah in Way of Kings is how hard she pushes herself researching the Desolations. This is again another comment on how she is researching nonstop well past exhaustion. She is terrified of what is coming (which is shown much later on as a very emotional scene). It is why she reacts to everyone as she does when we see her. She very much feels she is out of time and is trying to stop a storm by blowing hard. I think it is understandable that she would be testy around people. Yet despite all this, she sees in Shallan a kindred spirit. She knows Shallan’s family is falling apart, and that Shallan is seeking an alliance with her through wardship. That is why she rejected her so quickly. Because the Shallan she just met is like every other enterprising individual seeking to use Jasnah. But once Jasnah realizes there is a genuine love of learning within Shallan, she feels that it is worth nurturing and takes her on as a ward. This to me is a pretty clear sign of compassion.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 333\n\nShe eyed him. Was she testing his loyalty? Much like her daughter, Navani was a political creature. Intrigue made her blossom like a rockbud in calm wet air. However, unlike Jasnah, Navani was hard to trust. At least with Jasnah one knew where one stood—once again, Dalinar found himself wishing she’d put aside her projects and return to the Shattered Plains.\n\nThis is pretty open and shut. Dalinar trusts Jasnah. You know where you stand with her.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 456\n\nShallan hesitated, then wrote, Are we certain this is the best way? Perhaps we should simply ask Jasnah for help. You think she would respond to that? they wrote back. She would help an unknown and disliked Veden house? She would keep our secrets? Probably not. Though Shallan was increasingly certain that Jasnah’s reputation was exaggerated, the woman did have a ruthless side to her. She would not leave her important studies to go help Shallan’s family.\n\nShallan is starting to bit by bit get to know a deeper Jasnah. One that is not matching up with what everyone assumes.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 458\n\nShallan still found Jasnah an enigma. At times, she seemed a stern scholar annoyed by Shallan’s interruptions. At other times, there seemed to be a hint of wry humor hiding behind the stern facade. Either way, Shallan was finding that she felt remarkably comfortable around the woman. Jasnah encouraged her to speak her mind, something Shallan had taken to gladly. “I assume from your outburst that this topic is wearing on you,” Jasnah said, sorting through her volumes as the parshman withdrew. “You expressed interest in being a scholar. Well, you must learn that this is scholarship.” “Reading argument after argument from people who refuse to see any other point of view?” “They’re confident.” “I’m not an expert on confidence, Brightness,” Shallan said, holding up a book and inspecting it critically. “But I’d like to think that I could recognize it if it were before me. I don’t think that’s the right word for books like this one from Mederia. They feel more arrogant than confident to me.” She sighed, setting the book aside. “To be honest, ‘arrogant’ doesn’t feel like quite the right word. It’s not specific enough.” “And what would be the right word, then?” “I don’t know. ‘Errorgant,’ perhaps.” Jasnah raised a skeptical eyebrow. “It means to be twice as certain as someone who is merely arrogant,” Shallan said, “while possessing only one-tenth the requisite facts.” Her words drew a hint of a smile from Jasnah. “What you are reacting against is known as the Assuredness Movement, Shallan. This errorgance is a literary device. The scholars are intentionally overstating their case.” “The Assuredness Movement?” Shallan asked, holding up one of her books. “I guess I could get behind that.” “Oh?” “Yes. Much easier to stab it in the back from that position.” That got only an eyebrow raise.\n\nSo, more seriously, Shallan continued. “I suppose I can understand the device, Brightness, but these books you’ve given me on King Gavilar’s death are more and more irrational in defending their points. What began as a rhetorical conceit seems to have descended into name-calling and squabbling.” “They are trying to provoke discussion. Would you rather that the scholars hide from the truth, like so many? You would have men prefer ignorance?” “When reading these books, scholarship and ignorance feel much alike to me,” Shallan said. “Ignorance may reside in a man hiding from intelligence, but scholarship can seem ignorance hidden behind intelligence.” “And what of intelligence without ignorance? Finding truth while not dismissing the possibility of being wrong?” “A mythological treasure, Brightness, much like the Dawnshards or the Honorblades. Certainly worth seeking, but only with great caution.” “Caution?” Jasnah said, frowning. “It would make you famous, but actually finding it would destroy us all. Proof that one can be both intelligent and accept the intelligence of those who disagree with you? Why, I should think it would undermine the scholarly world in its entirety.” Jasnah sniffed. “You go too far, child. If you took half the energy you devote to being witty and channeled it into your work, I daresay you could be one of the greatest scholars of our age.” “I’m sorry, Brightness,” Shallan said. “I … well, I’m confused. Considering the gaps in my education, I assumed you would have me studying things deeper in the past than a few years ago.” Jasnah opened one of her books. “I have found that youths like you have a relative lack of appreciation for the distant past. Therefore, I selected an area of study that is both more recent and sensational, to ease you into true scholarship. Is the murder of a king not of interest to you?” “Yes, Brightness,” Shallan said. “We children love things that are shiny and loud.” “You have quite the mouth on you at times.” “At times? You mean it’s not there at others? I’ll have to …” Shallan trailed off, then bit her lip, realizing she’d gone too far. “Sorry.” “Never apologize for being clever, Shallan. It sets a bad precedent. However, one must apply one’s wit with care. You often seem to say the first passably clever thing that enters your mind.” “I know,” Shallan said. “It’s long been a foible of mine, Brightness. One my nurses and tutors tried very hard to discourage.” “Likely through strict punishments.” “Yes. Making me sit in the corner holding books over my head was the preferred method.” “Which, in turn,” Jasnah said with a sigh, “only trained you to make your quips more quickly, for you knew you had to get them out before you could reconsider and suppress them.” Shallan cocked her head. “The punishments were incompetent,” Jasnah said. “Used upon one such as yourself, they were actually encouragement. A game. How much would you have to say to earn a punishment? Could you say something so clever that your tutors missed the joke? Sitting in the corner just gave you more time to compose retorts.” “But it’s unseemly for a young woman to speak as I so often do.”\n\n“The only ‘unseemly’ thing is to not channel your intelligence usefully. Consider. You have trained yourself to do something very similar to what annoys you in the scholars: cleverness without thought behind it—intelligence, one might say, without a foundation of proper consideration.” Jasnah turned a page. “Errorgant, wouldn’t you say?” Shallan blushed. “I prefer my wards to be clever,” Jasnah said. “It gives me more to work with. I should bring you to court with me. I suspect that Wit, at least, would find you amusing—if only because your apparent natural timidity and your clever tongue make such an intriguing combination.” “Yes, Brightness.” “Please, just remember that a woman’s mind is her most precious weapon. It must not be employed clumsily or prematurely. Much like the aforementioned knife to the back, a clever gibe is most effective when it is unanticipated.” “I’m sorry, Brightness.” “It wasn’t an admonition,” Jasnah said, turning a page. “Simply an observation. I make them on occasion: Those books are musty. The sky is blue today. My ward is a smart-lipped reprobate.” Shallan smiled. “Now, tell me what you’ve discovered.” …\n\n“And your thoughts?” “I feel inadequate to draw conclusions, Brightness.” “What is the point of research if not to draw conclusions?” “My tutors told me that supposition was only for the very experienced,” Shallan explained. Jasnah sniffed. “Your tutors were idiots. Youthful immaturity is one of the cosmere’s great catalysts for change, Shallan. Do you realize that the Sunmaker was only seventeen when he began his conquest? Gavarah hadn’t reached her twentieth Weeping when she proposed the theory of the three realms.” “But for every Sunmaker or Gavarah, are there not a hundred Gregorhs?” He had been a youthful king notorious for beginning a pointless war with kingdoms that had been his father’s allies. “There was only one Gregorh,” Jasnah said with a grimace, “thankfully. Your point is a valid one. Hence the purpose of education. To be young is about action. To be a scholar is about informed action.” “Or about sitting in an alcove reading about a six-year-old murder.” “I would not have you studying this if there were no point to it,” Jasnah said, opening up another of her own books. “Too many scholars think of research as purely a cerebral pursuit. If we do nothing with the knowledge we gain, then we have wasted our study. Books can store information better than we can—what we do that books cannot is interpret. So if one is not going to draw conclusions, then one might as well just leave the information in the texts.” Shallan sat back, thoughtful. Presented that way, it somehow made her want to dig back into the studies. What was it that Jasnah wanted her to do with the information? Once again, she felt a stab of guilt. Jasnah was taking great pains to instruct her in scholarship, and she was going to reward the woman by stealing her most valuable possession and leaving a broken replacement. It made Shallan feel sick. She had expected study beneath Jasnah to involve meaningless memorization and busywork, accompanied by chastisement for not being smart enough. That was how her tutors had approached her instruction. Jasnah was different. She gave Shallan a topic and the freedom to pursue it as she wished. Jasnah offered encouragement and speculation, but nearly all of their conversations turned to topics like the true nature of scholarship, the purpose of studying, the beauty of knowledge and its application. Jasnah Kholin truly loved learning, and she wanted others to as well. Behind the stern gaze, intense eyes, and rarely smiling lips, Jasnah Kholin truly believed in what she was doing. Whatever that was…\n\nJasnah liked to speak of the great women of the past, ones who had not just recorded history, but shaped it. Whatever it was she studied, she felt that it was important. Worldchanging...\n\nAnd what did it say about Jasnah’s own intentions for marriage that she herself never bothered with the more becoming feminine arts like music or drawing? “Your Majesty,” Jasnah said, rising smoothly. Shallan started and looked hastily over her shoulder. The elderly king of Kharbranth was standing in the doorway, wearing magnificent orange and white robes with detailed embroidery. Shallan scrambled to her feet. “Brightness Jasnah,” the king said. “Am I interrupting?” “Your company is never an interruption, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said. She had to be as surprised as Shallan was, yet didn’t display a moment of discomfort or anxiety. “We were soon to take lunch, anyway.” “I know, Brightness,” Taravangian said. “I hope you don’t mind if I join you.” A group of servants began bringing in food and a table. “Not at all,” Jasnah said...\n\nHowever, the lighteyes considered him less than bright. He was not an idiot. In lighteyed politics, unfortunately, being only average was a disadvantage. As they ate, the silence drew out, becoming awkward. Several times, the king looked as if he wanted to say something, but then turned back to his soup. He seemed intimidated by Jasnah. “And how is your granddaughter, Your Majesty?” Jasnah eventually asked. “She is recovering well?” “Quite well, thank you,” Taravangian said, as if relieved to begin conversing. “Though she now avoids the narrower corridors of the Conclave. I do want to thank you for your aid.” “It is always fulfilling to be of service, Your Majesty.” “If you will forgive my saying so, the ardents do not think much of your service,” Taravangian said. “I realize it is likely a sensitive topic. Perhaps I shouldn’t mention it, but—” “No, feel free,” Jasnah said, eating a small green lurnip from the end of her skewer. “I am not ashamed of my choices.” “Then you’ll forgive an old man’s curiosity?” “I always forgive curiosity, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said. “It strikes me as one of the most genuine of emotions.” “Then where did you find it?” Taravangian asked, nodding toward the Soulcaster, which Jasnah wore covered by a black glove. “How did you keep it from the devotaries?” “One might find those questions dangerous, Your Majesty.” “I’ve already acquired some new enemies by welcoming you.” “You will be forgiven,” Jasnah said. “Depending on the devotary you have chosen.” “Forgiven? Me?” The elderly man seemed to find that amusing, and for a moment, Shallan thought she saw deep regret in his expression. “Unlikely. But that is something else entirely. Please. I stand by my questions.” “And I stand by my evasiveness, Your Majesty. I’m sorry. I do forgive your curiosity, but I cannot reward it. These secrets are mine.” “Of course, of course.” The king sat back, looking embarrassed. “Now you probably assume I brought this meal simply to ambush you about the fabrial.” “You had another purpose, then?” “Well, you see, I’ve heard the most wonderful things about your ward’s artistic skill. I thought that maybe …” He smiled at Shallan. “Of course, Your Majesty,” Shallan said. “I’d be happy to draw your likeness.” He beamed as she stood, leaving her meal half eaten and gathering her things.\n\nShe glanced at Jasnah, but the older woman’s face was unreadable. “Would you prefer a simple portrait against a white background?” Shallan asked. “Or would you prefer a broader perspective, including surroundings?” “Perhaps,” Jasnah said pointedly, “you should wait until the meal is finished, Shallan?” Shallan blushed, feeling a fool for her enthusiasm. “Of course.” “No, no,” the king said. “I’m quite finished. A wider sketch would be perfect, child. How would you like me to sit?” He slid his chair back, posing and smiling in a grandfatherly way. She blinked, fixing the image in her mind. “That is perfect, Your Majesty. You can return to your meal.” “Don’t you need me to sit still? I’ve posed for portraits before.” “It’s all right,” Shallan assured him, sitting down. “Very well,” he said, pulling back to the table. “I do apologize for making you use me, of all people, as a subject for your art. This face of mine isn’t the most impressive one you’ve depicted, I’m sure.” “Nonsense,” Shallan said. “A face like yours is just what an artist needs.” “It is?” “Yes, the—” She cut herself off. She’d been about to quip, Yes, the skin is enough like parchment to make an ideal canvas. “… that handsome nose of yours, and wise furrowed brow. It will be quite striking in the black charcoal.” “Oh, well then. Proceed. Though I still can’t see how you’ll work without me holding a pose.” “Brightness Shallan has some unique talents,” Jasnah said. Shallan began her sketch. “I suppose that she must!” the king said. “I’ve seen the drawing she did for Varas.” “Varas?” Jasnah asked. “The Palanaeum’s assistant chief of collections,” the king said. “A distant cousin of mine. He says the staff is quite taken with your young ward. How did you find her?” “Unexpectedly,” Jasnah said, “and in need of an education.” The king cocked his head. “The artistic skill, I cannot claim,” Jasnah said. “It was a preexisting condition.” “Ah, a blessing of the Almighty.” “You might say that.” “But you would not, I assume?” Taravangian chuckled awkwardly. Shallan drew quickly, establishing the shape of his head. He shuffled uncomfortably. “Is it hard for you, Jasnah? Painful, I mean?” “Atheism is not a disease, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said dryly. “It’s not as if I’ve caught a foot rash.” “Of course not, of course not. But … er, isn’t it difficult, having nothing in which to believe?” Shallan leaned forward, still sketching, but keeping her attention on the conversation.\n\nShallan had assumed that training under a heretic would be a little more exciting. She and Kabsal—the witty ardent whom she’d met on her first day in Kharbranth—had chatted several times now about Jasnah’s faith. However, around Jasnah herself, the topic almost never came up. When it did, Jasnah usually changed it. Today, however, she did not. Perhaps she sensed the sincerity in the king’s question. “I wouldn’t say that I have nothing to believe in, Your Majesty. Actually, I have much to believe in. My brother and my uncle, my own abilities. The things I was taught by my parents.” “But, what is right and wrong, you’ve … Well, you’ve discarded that.” “Just because I do not accept the teachings of the devotaries does not mean I’ve discarded a belief in right and wrong.” “But the Almighty determines what is right!” “Must someone, some unseen thing, declare what is right for it to be right? I believe that my own morality—which answers only to my heart—is more sure and true than the morality of those who do right only because they fear retribution.” “But that is the soul of law,” the king said, sounding confused. “If there is no punishment, there can be only chaos.” “If there were no law, some men would do as they wish, yes,” Jasnah said. “But isn’t it remarkable that, given the chance for personal gain at the cost of others, so many people choose what is right?” “Because they fear the Almighty.” “No,” Jasnah said. “I think something innate in us understands that seeking the good of society is usually best for the individual as well. Humankind is noble, when we give it the chance to be. That nobility is something that exists independent of any god’s decree.” “I just don’t see how anything could be outside God’s decrees.” The king shook his head, bemused. “Brightness Jasnah, I don’t mean to argue, but isn’t the very definition of the Almighty that all things exist because of him?” “If you add one and one, that makes two, does it not?” “Well, yes.” “No god needs declare it so for it to be true,” Jasnah said. “So, could we not say that mathematics exists outside the Almighty, independent of him?” “Perhaps.” “Well,” Jasnah said, “I simply claim that morality and human will are independent of him too.” “If you say that,” the king said, chuckling, “then you’ve removed all purpose for the Almighty’s existence!” “Indeed.” The balcony fell silent. Jasnah’s sphere lamps cast a cool, even white light across them. For an uncomfortable moment, the only sound was the scratching of Shallan’s charcoal on her drawing pad. She worked with quick, scraping motions, disturbed by the things that Jasnah had said. They made her feel hollow inside. That was partly because the king, for all his affability, was not good at arguing. He was a dear man, but no match for Jasnah in a conversation. “Well,” Taravangian said, “I must say that you make your points quite effectively. I don’t accept them, though.” “My intention is not to convert, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said. “I am content keeping my beliefs to myself, something most of my colleagues in the devotaries have difficulty doing. Shallan, have you finished yet?” “Quite nearly, Brightness.” “But it’s been barely a few minutes!” the king said. “She has remarkable skill, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said. “As I believe I mentioned.”...\n\n“I noticed that at one point when you were speaking to the king, you hesitated,” Jasnah said. “What didn’t you say?” “Something inappropriate.” “But clever?” “Cleverness never seems quite so impressive when regarded outside the moment, Brightness. It was just a silly thought.” “And you replaced it with an empty compliment. I think you misunderstood what I was trying to explain, child. I do not wish for you to remain silent. It is good to be clever.” “But if I’d spoken,” Shallan said, “I’d have insulted the king, perhaps confused him as well, which would have caused him embarrassment. I am certain he knows what people say about his slowness of thought.” Jasnah sniffed. “Idle words. From foolish people. But perhaps it was wise not to speak, though keep in mind that channeling your capacities and stifling them are two separate things. I’d much prefer you to think of something both clever and appropriate.” “Yes, Brightness.” “Besides,” Jasnah said, “I believe you might have made Taravangian laugh. He seems haunted by something lately.” “You don’t find him dull, then?” Shallan asked, curious. She herself didn’t think the king dull or a fool, but she’d thought someone as intelligent and learned as Jasnah might not have patience for a man like him. “Taravangian is a wonderful man,” Jasnah said, “and worth a hundred self-proclaimed experts on courtly ways. He reminds me of my uncle Dalinar. Earnest, sincere, concerned.” “The lighteyes here say he’s weak,” Shallan said. “Because he panders to so many other monarchs, because he fears war, because he doesn’t have a Shardblade.” Jasnah didn’t reply, though she looked disturbed. “Brightness?” Shallan prodded, walking to her own seat and arranging her charcoals. “In ancient days,” Jasnah said, “a man who brought peace to his kingdom was considered to be of great worth. Now that same man would be derided as a coward.” She shook her head. “It has been centuries coming, this change. It should terrify us. We could do with more men like Taravangian, and I shall require you to never call him dull again, not even in passing.” “Yes, Brightness,” Shallan said, bowing her head.\n\n“Did you really believe the things you said? About the Almighty?” Jasnah was quiet for a moment. “I do. Though perhaps I overstated my conviction.” “The Assuredness Movement of rhetorical theory?” “Yes,” Jasnah said. “I suppose that it was. I must be careful not to put my back toward you as I read today.” Shallan smiled. “A true scholar must not close her mind on any topic,” Jasnah said, “no matter how certain she may feel. Just because I have not yet found a convincing reason to join one of the devotaries does not mean I never will. Though each time I have a discussion like the one today, my convictions grow firmer.” Shallan bit her lip. Jasnah noticed the expression. “You will need to learn to control that, Shallan. It makes your feelings obvious.” “Yes, Brightness.” “Well, out with it.” “Just that your conversation with the king was not entirely fair.” “Oh?” “Because of his, well, you know. His limited capacity. He did quite remarkably, but didn’t make the arguments that someone more versed in Vorin theology might have.” “And what arguments might such a one have made?” “Well, I’m not very well trained in that area myself. But I do think that you ignored, or at least minimized, one vital part of the discussion.” “Which is?” Shallan tapped at her breast. “Our hearts, Brightness. I believe because I feel something, a closeness to the Almighty, a peace that comes when I live my faith.” “The mind is capable of projecting expected emotional responses.” “But didn’t you yourself argue that the way we act—the way we feel about right and wrong—was a defining attribute of our humanity? You used our innate morality to prove your point. So how can you discard my feelings?” “Discard them? No. Regard them with skepticism? Perhaps. Your feelings, Shallan—however powerful—are your own. Not mine. And what I feel is that spending my life trying to earn the favor of an unseen, unknown, and unknowable being who watches me from the sky is an exercise in sheer futility.” She pointed at Shallan with her pen. “But your rhetorical method is improving. We’ll make a scholar of you yet.” Shallan smiled, feeling a surge of pleasure. Praise from Jasnah was more precious than an emerald broam.\n\nThis is our first, and one of the great examples (there are two to three more over the course of the three books) of how Jasnah talks with individuals with beliefs different than her own, and her views on her own “heresy”. We first start with her method of teaching which to Shallan’s surprise is very Socratic (though Socrates obviously is not a thing in their world). Jasnah believes in encouraging curiosity, and asking questions to gain greater knowledge and insight. It is hard to see, but I believe this is the starting signs of a bond Jasnah is building with Shallan, and shows Jasnah beginning to care and respect Shallan. This is not just a lesson of memorization. She is trying to see and appreciate Shallan for the person she is, and help her grow as a person. If there is one way to instigate Jasnah’s ire, it is crushing another person’s creativity and ingenuity with personal ignorance. She calls out Shallan’s tutors as being idiots for doing exactly that. As per Shallan’s own thoughts, Jasnah genuinely loves learning and wants others to do so as well.\n\nTaravangian then arrives to eat with them. It is Taravangian, not Jasnah that brings up her beliefs. Shallan comments to herself how often Jasnah will not bring up her beliefs at all, and when asked typically changes the subject. This was only different because she felt Taravangian’s inquiry was genuine and not malicious or seeking to convert her. Every assertion Jasnah made was in response to an argument Taravangian made. At no point did she belittle his views. At no point did she deride him for believing as he wished. In fact it was Taravangian that stated “then you’ve removed all purpose for the Almighty’s existence!”, to which Jasnah simply responds “indeed”. Jasnah does not believe in the need of a deity. That does not mean she has any problem with anyone else believing such, and she states exactly that in this scene. “My intention is not to convert Your Majesty. I am content keeping my beliefs to myself, something most of my colleagues in the devotaries have difficulty doing”. She even pays the devoteries the respect of referring to them as her colleagues. Jasnah then inquires what Shallan was going to say to the king. Shallan admits it would have been derogatory, to which Jasnah in a calm and understanding manner instructs Shallan to never speak of Taravangian in that manner. That he is “earnest, sincere, concerned” and reminds her of Dalinar. She respects him, and wishes there were more men like him. She misses the ancient days where a man who brought peace to his kingdom was considered with great worth. This shows what kind of person she holds in high esteem. This is rather different than the cold, heartless killer an outside view of the other scenes lead us to believe. This Jasnah desires peace, and genuinely respects and is fond of individuals who feel the same.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 502\n\nShallan felt her heart flutter as she regarded the broken Soulcaster. Stealing from Jasnah had seemed acceptable when the princess had been a distant, unknown figure. A heretic, presumably ill-tempered and demanding. But what of the real Jasnah? A careful scholar, stern but fair, with a surprising level of wisdom and insight? Could Shallan really steal from her?\n\nAgain, the outside view Shallan started with of Jasnah is beginning to conflict with the Jasnah she is truly getting to know.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 507\n\n“Well, Brightness Jasnah isn’t a harsh mistress. She’s actually everything she’s said to be. Brilliant, beautiful, mysterious. I’m fortunate to be her ward.” Kabsal nodded. “She is said to be a sterling woman, save for one thing.” “You mean the heresy?” He nodded. “It’s not as bad for me as you think,” she said. “She’s rarely vocal about her beliefs unless provoked.” “She’s ashamed, then.” “I doubt that. Merely considerate.” He eyed her. “You needn’t worry about me,” Shallan said. “Jasnah doesn’t try to persuade me to abandon the devotaries.” Kabsal leaned forward, growing more somber. He was older than she—a man in his mid-twenties, confident, self-assured, and earnest. He was practically the only man near her age that she’d ever talked to outside of her father’s careful supervision. But he was also an ardent. So, of course, nothing could come of it. Could it? “Shallan,” Kabsal said gently, “can you not see how we—how I—would be concerned? Brightness Jasnah is a very powerful and intriguing woman. We would expect her ideas to be infectious.” “Infectious? I thought you said I was the disease.” “I never said that!” “Yes, but I pretended you did. Which is virtually the same thing.” He frowned. “Brightness Shallan, the ardents are worried about you. The souls of the Almighty’s children are our responsibility. Jasnah has a history of corrupting those with whom she comes in contact.” “Really?” Shallan asked, genuinely interested. “Other wards?” “It is not my place to say.” “We can move to another place.” “I’m firm on this point, Brightness. I will not speak of it.”\n\nThis is the second scene that shows how Jasnah deals with religion, vs how religion deals with her. Despite Shallan defending Jasnah, and showing that Jasnah is “not vocal unless provoked” Kabsal jumps to the conclusion that she must be ashamed then. This is also the second time we see people view Jasnah’s beliefs as “infectious”. As it disagreeing with the church is tantamount to being a disease. Makes you wonder what the church did to those Jasnah “corrupted”.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 509\n\nKabsal shook his head. “The Almighty gives everyone talents—and when we pick a Calling that capitalizes on them, we are worshipping him in the most fundamental way. A devotary—and its ardents—should help nurture that, encouraging you to set and achieve goals of excellence.” He waved to the books stacked on the desk. “This is what your devotary should be helping you with, Shallan. History, logic, science, art. Being honest and good is important, but we should be working harder to encourage the natural talents of people, rather than forcing them to adapt to the Glories and Callings we feel are most important.” “That is a reasonable argument, I guess.” Kabsal nodded, looking thoughtful. “Is it any wonder a woman like Jasnah Kholin turned away from that? Many devotaries encourage women to leave difficult studies of theology to the ardents. If only Jasnah had been able to see the true beauty of our doctrine.” He smiled, digging a thick book out of his bread basket. “I really had hoped, originally, to be able to show her what I mean.” “I doubt she’d react well to that.” “Perhaps,” he said idly, hefting the tome. “But to be the one who finally convinced her!” “Brother Kabsal, that sounds almost like you’re seeking distinction.” He blushed, and she realized she’d said something that genuinely embarrassed him. She winced, cursing her tongue. “Yes,” he said. “I do seek distinction. I shouldn’t wish so badly to be the one who converts her. But I do. If she would just listen to my proof.”...\n\n“I hear footsteps.” He stood, and Shallan turned as Jasnah walked into the alcove, followed by a parshman carrying a basket of books. Jasnah showed no surprise at the presence of the ardent. “I’m sorry, Brightness Jasnah,” Shallan said, standing. “He—” “You are not a captive, child,” Jasnah interrupted brusquely. “You are allowed visitors. Just be careful to check your skin for tooth marks. These types have a habit of dragging their prey out to sea with them.” Kabsal flushed. He moved to gather up his things. Jasnah waved for the parshman to place her books on the table. “Can that plate reproduce a cymatic pattern corresponding to Urithiru, priest? Or do you only have patterns for the standard four cities?” Kabsal looked at her, obviously shocked to realize that she knew exactly what the plate was for. He picked up his book. “Urithiru is just a fable.” “Odd. One would think that your type would be used to believing in fables.” His face grew redder. He finished packing his things, then nodded curtly to Shallan and walked hastily from the room. “If I may say so, Brightness,” Shallan said, “that was exceptionally rude of you.” “I’m prone to such bouts of incivility,” Jasnah said. “I’m certain he has heard what I’m like. I simply wanted to make sure he got what he expected.” “You haven’t acted that way toward other ardents in the Palanaeum.” “The other ardents in the Palanaeum haven’t been working to turn my ward against me.” “He wasn’t …” Shallan trailed off. “He was simply worried about my soul.” “Has he asked you to try to steal my Soulcaster yet?” Shallan felt a sudden spike of shock. Her hand went to the safepouch in her sleeve. Did Jasnah know? No, Shallan told herself. No, listen to the question. “He didn’t.” “Watch,” Jasnah said, opening a book. “He will eventually. I’ve experience with his type.” She looked at Shallan, and her expression softened. “He’s not interested in you. Not in any of the ways you think. In particular, this isn’t about your soul. It’s about me.” “That is somewhat arrogant of you,” Shallan said, “don’t you think?” “Only if I’m wrong, child,” Jasnah said, turning back to her book. “And I rarely am.”\n\nKabsal admits that the devoteries tend to force people to adopt certain glories and callings, while pushing them away from others. Women are urged to stay away from theology. Shallan then catches him and makes him admit that the reason he is pursuing Jasnah so much is for the distinction of being the one to convert her. He is not trying to understand her. Not trying to see her as a person. She is something to conquer. She is a trophy to be attained. When Jasnah arrives she shows she has no problem with Shallan speaking to whomsoever she wishes, even if the person is diametrically opposed to her. She just cautions Shallan because she is concerned he is using Shallan to get at her. Considering as we have learned how often this has been done to Jasnah in the past (and we even learn it is true of Kabsal), such a response makes sense. Jasnah is angry. Yet again is another person coming to belittle her beliefs and get her to “see the light”. Whereas with Taravangian Jasnah was respectful and considerate, with Kabsal she is hostile and picks him a part. This shows Jasnah does treat others in accordance with the way she is treated, and in Kabsal’s case she was right.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 528\n\n“You are progressing more quickly than I had assumed you would,” Jasnah said suddenly. Shallan spun, but Jasnah’s eyes were still closed. “I was wrong to judge you so harshly because of your prior education. I myself have often said that passion outperforms upbringing. You have the determination and the capacity to become a respected scholar, Shallan. I realize that the answers seem slow in coming, but continue your research. You will have them eventually.”\n\nAnother example of Jasnah making a mistake, admitting it, and seeking to do better. She admits she unfairly judged Shallan. She encourages Shallan, and explains her process. She understands Shallan and is considerate of her as an individual.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 529\n\nShallan sat back on her heels, still kneeling on the towel. “How do you know what is right, Jasnah? If you don’t listen to the devotaries, how do you decide?” “That depends upon one’s philosophy. What is most important to you?” “I don’t know. Can’t you tell me?” “No,” Jasnah replied. “If I gave you the answers, I’d be no better than the devotaries, prescribing beliefs.” “They aren’t evil, Jasnah.” “Except when they try to rule the world.” Shallan drew her lips into a thin line. The War of Loss had destroyed the Hierocracy, shattering Vorinism into the devotaries. That was the inevitable result of a religion trying to rule. The devotaries were to teach morals, not enforce them. Enforcement was for the lighteyes. “You say you can’t give me answers,” Shallan said. “But can’t I ask for the advice of someone wise? Someone who’s gone before? Why write our philosophies, draw our conclusions, if not to influence others? You yourself told me that information is worthless unless we use it to make judgments.” Jasnah smiled, dunking her arms and washing off the soap. Shallan caught a victorious glimmer in her eye. She wasn’t necessarily advocating ideas because she believed them; she just wanted to push Shallan. It was infuriating. How was Shallan to know what Jasnah really thought if she adopted conflicting points of view like this? “You act as if there were one answer,” Jasnah said, gesturing to Shallan to fetch a towel and climbing from the pool. “A single, eternally perfect response.”\n\nAnother instance of proof of how Jasnah handles religion. She does not force Shallan to see things her way. She is not trying to corrupt Shallan to athiesm. Shallan is more than welcome to be as pious as she wishes around Jasnah. The only thing Jasnah requires, is questioning. Question yourself, question your superiors, question your world and always learn.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 530\n\nJasnah stopped, looking off the Ralinsa and toward a darker side street. “What do you think of that roadway, Shallan?” “It doesn’t look particularly appealing to me.” “And yet,” Jasnah said, “it is the most direct route from the Ralinsa to the theater district.” “Is that where we’re going?” “We aren’t ‘going’ anywhere,” Jasnah said, taking off down the side street. “We are acting, pondering, and learning.” Shallan followed nervously. The night swallowed them; only the occasional light from late-night taverns and shops offered illumination. Jasnah wore her black, fingerless glove over her Soulcaster, hiding the light of its gemstones. Shallan found herself creeping. Her slippered feet could feel every change in the ground underfoot, each pebble and crack. She looked about nervously as they passed a group of workers gathered around a tavern doorway. They were darkeyes, of course. In the night, that distinction seemed more profound. “Brightness?” Shallan asked in a hushed tone. “When we are young,” Jasnah said, “we want simple answers. There is no greater indication of youth, perhaps, than the desire for everything to be as it should. As it has ever been.” Shallan frowned, still watching the men by the tavern over her shoulder. “The older we grow,” Jasnah said, “the more we question. We begin to ask why. And yet, we still want the answers to be simple. We assume that the people around us—adults, leaders—will have those answers. Whatever they give often satisfies us.” “I was never satisfied,” Shallan said softly. “I wanted more.” “You were mature,” Jasnah said. “What you describe happens to most of us, as we age. Indeed, it seems to me that aging, wisdom, and wondering are synonymous. The older we grow, the more likely we are to reject the simple answers. Unless someone gets in our way and demands they be accepted regardless.” Jasnah’s eyes narrowed. “You wonder why I reject the devotaries.” “I do.” “Most of them seek to stop the questions.” Jasnah halted. Then she briefly pulled back her glove, using the light beneath to reveal the street around her. The gemstones on her hand—larger than broams—blazed like torches, red, white, and grey. “Is it wise to be showing your wealth like that, Brightness?” Shallan said, speaking very softly and glancing about her. “No,” Jasnah said. “It is most certainly not. Particularly not here. You see, this street has gained a particular reputation lately. On three separate occasions during the last two months, theatergoers who chose this route to the main road were accosted by footpads. In each case, the people were murdered.” Shallan felt herself grow pale.\n\n“The city watch,” Jasnah said, “has done nothing. Taravangian has sent them several pointed reprimands, but the captain of the watch is cousin to a very influential lighteyes in the city, and Taravangian is not a terribly powerful king. Some suspect that there is more going on, that the footpads might be bribing the watch. The politics of it are irrelevant at the moment for, as you can see, no members of the watch are guarding the place, despite its reputation.” Jasnah pulled her glove back on, plunging the roadway back into darkness. Shallan blinked, her eyes adjusting. “How foolish,” Jasnah said, “would you say it is for us to come here, two undefended women wearing costly clothing and bearing riches?” “Very foolish. Jasnah, can we go? Please. Whatever lesson you have in mind isn’t worth this.” Jasnah drew her lips into a line, then looked toward a narrow, darker alleyway off the road they were on. It was almost completely black now that Jasnah had replaced her glove. “You’re at an interesting place in your life, Shallan,” Jasnah said, flexing her hand. “You are old enough to wonder, to ask, to reject what is presented to you simply because it was presented to you. But you also cling to the idealism of youth. You feel there must be some single, all-defining Truth—and you think that once you find it, all that once confused you will suddenly make sense.” “I …” Shallan wanted to argue, but Jasnah’s words were tellingly accurate. The terrible things Shallan had done, the terrible thing she had planned to do, haunted her. Was it possible to do something horrible in the name of accomplishing something wonderful? Jasnah walked into the narrow alleyway. “Jasnah!” Shallan said. “What are you doing?” “This is philosophy in action, child,” Jasnah said. “Come with me.” Shallan hesitated at the mouth of the alleyway, her heart thumping, her thoughts muddled. The wind blew and bells rang, like frozen raindrops shattering against the stones. In a moment of decision, she rushed after Jasnah, preferring company, even in the dark, to being alone. The shrouded glimmer of the Soulcaster was barely enough to light their way, and Shallan followed in Jasnah’s shadow. Noise from behind. Shallan turned with a start to see several dark forms crowding into the alley. “Oh, Stormfather,” she whispered. Why? Why was Jasnah doing this? Shaking, Shallan grabbed at Jasnah’s dress with her freehand. Other shadows were moving in front of them, from the far side of the alley. They grew closer, grunting, splashing through foul, stagnant puddles. Chill water had already soaked Shallan’s slippers. Jasnah stopped moving.\n\nThe frail light of her cloaked Soulcaster reflected off metal in the hands of their stalkers. Swords or knives. These men meant murder. You didn’t rob women like Shallan and Jasnah, women with powerful connections, then leave them alive as witnesses. Men like these were not the gentlemen bandits of romantic stories. They lived each day knowing that if they were caught, they would be hanged. Paralyzed by fear, Shallan couldn’t even scream. Stormfather, Stormfather, Stormfather! “And now,” Jasnah said, voice hard and grim, “the lesson.” She whipped off her glove. The sudden light was nearly blinding. Shallan raised a hand against it, stumbling back against the alley wall. There were four men around them. Not the men from the tavern entrance, but others. Men she hadn’t noticed watching them. She could see the knives now, and she could also see the murder in their eyes. Her scream finally broke free. The men grunted at the glare, but shoved their way forward. A thickchested man with a dark beard came up to Jasnah, weapon raised. She calmly reached her hand out—fingers splayed—and pressed it against his chest as he swung a knife. Shallan’s breath caught in her throat. Jasnah’s hand sank into the man’s skin, and he froze. A second later he burned. No, he became fire. Transformed into flames in an eyeblink. Rising around Jasnah’s hand, they formed the outline of a man with head thrown back and mouth open. For just a moment, the blaze of the man’s death outshone Jasnah’s gemstones. Shallan’s scream trailed off. The figure of flames was strangely beautiful. It was gone in a moment, the fire dissipating into the night air, leaving an orange afterimage in Shallan’s eyes. The other three men began to curse, scrambling away, tripping over one another in their panic. One fell. Jasnah turned casually, brushing his shoulder with her fingers as he struggled to his knees. He became crystal, a figure of pure, flawless quartz—his clothing transformed along with him. The diamond in Jasnah’s Soulcaster faded, but there was still plenty of Stormlight left to send rainbow sparkles through the transformed corpse. The other two men fled in opposite directions. Jasnah took a deep breath, closing her eyes, lifting her hand above her head. Shallan held her safehand to her breast, stunned, confused. Terrified. Stormlight shot from Jasnah’s hand like twin bolts of lightning, symmetrical. One struck each of the footpads and they popped, puffing into smoke. Their empty clothing dropped to the ground. With a sharp snap, the smokestone crystal on Jasnah’s Soulcaster cracked, its light vanishing, leaving her with just the diamond and the ruby. The remains of the two footpads rose into the air, small billows of greasy vapor. Jasnah opened her eyes, looking eerily calm.\n\nShe tugged her glove back on—using her safehand to hold it against her stomach and sliding her freehand fingers in. Then she calmly walked back the way they had come. She left the crystal corpse kneeling with hand upraised. Frozen forever. Shallan pried herself off the wall and hastened after Jasnah, sickened and amazed. Ardents were forbidden to use their Soulcasters on people. They rarely even used them in front of others. And how had Jasnah struck down two men at a distance? From everything Shallan had read—what little there was to find—Soulcasting required physical contact. Too overwhelmed to demand answers, she stood silent—freehand held to the side of her head, trying to control her trembling and her gasping breaths—as Jasnah called for a palanquin. One came eventually, and the two women climbed in. The bearers carried them toward the Ralinsa, their steps jostling Shallan and Jasnah, who sat across from one another in the palanquin. Jasnah idly popped the broken smokestone from her Soulcaster, then tucked it into a pocket. It could be sold to a gemsmith, who could cut smaller gemstones from the salvaged pieces. “That was horrible,” Shallan finally said, hand still held to her breast. “It was one of the most awful things I’ve ever experienced. You killed four men.” “Four men who were planning to beat, rob, kill, and possibly rape us.” “You tempted them into coming for us!” “Did I force them to commit any crimes?” “You showed off your gemstones.” “Can a woman not walk with her possessions down the street of a city?” “At night?” Shallan asked. “Through a rough area? Displaying wealth? You all but asked for what happened!” “Does that make it right?” Jasnah said, leaning forward. “Do you condone what the men were planning to do?” “Of course not. But that doesn’t make what you did right either!” “And yet, those men are off the street. The people of this city are that much safer. The issue that Taravangian has been so worried about has been solved, and no more theatergoers will fall to those thugs. How many lives did I just save?” “I know how many you just took,” Shallan said. “And through the power of something that should be holy!” “Philosophy in action. An important lesson for you.” “You did all this just to prove a point,” Shallan said softly. “You did this to prove to me that you could. Damnation, Jasnah, how could you do something like that?” Jasnah didn’t reply. Shallan stared at the woman, searching for emotion in those expressionless eyes. Stormfather. Did I ever really know this woman? Who is she, really?\n\nJasnah leaned back, watching the city pass. “I did not do this just to prove a point, child. I have been feeling for some time that I took advantage of His Majesty’s hospitality. He doesn’t realize how much trouble he could face for allying himself with me. Besides, men like those …” There was something in her voice, an edge Shallan had never heard before. What was done to you? Shallan wondered with horror. And who did it? “Regardless,” Jasnah continued, “tonight’s actions came about because I chose this path, not because of anything I felt you needed to see. However, the opportunity also presented a chance for instruction, for questions. Am I a monster or am I a hero? Did I just slaughter four men, or did I stop four murderers from walking the streets? Does one deserve to have evil done to her by consequence of putting herself where evil can reach her? Did I have a right to defend myself? Or was I just looking for an excuse to end lives?” “I don’t know,” Shallan whispered. “You will spend the next week researching it and thinking on it. If you wish to be a scholar—a true scholar who changes the world—then you will need to face questions like this. There will be times when you must make decisions that churn your stomach, Shallan Davar. I’ll have you ready to make those decisions.” Jasnah fell silent, looking out the side as the palanquin bearers marched them up to the Conclave. Too troubled to say more, Shallan suffered the rest of the trip in silence. She followed Jasnah through the hushed hallways to their rooms, passing scholars on their way to the Palanaeum for some midnight study. Inside their rooms, Shallan helped Jasnah undress, though she hated touching the woman. She shouldn’t have felt that way. The men Jasnah had killed were terrible creatures, and she had little doubt that they would have killed her. But it wasn’t the act itself so much as the cold callousness of it that bothered her. Still feeling numb, Shallan fetched Jasnah a sleeping robe as the woman removed her jewelry and set it on the dressing table. “You could have let the other three get away,” Shallan said, walking back toward Jasnah, who had sat down to brush her hair. “You only needed to kill one of them.” “No, I didn’t,” Jasnah said. “Why? They would have been too frightened to do something like that again.” “You don’t know that. I sincerely wanted those men gone. A careless barmaid walking home the wrong way cannot protect herself, but I can. And I will.” “You have no authority to do so, not in someone else’s city.” “True,” Jasnah said. “Another point to consider, I suppose.”\n\nWe have now reached one of the big scenes for a lot of people regarding Jasnah. As the point of this post is to get to know Jasnah “the person”, I will not be commenting on the morality of what happened. I will focus on what specifically happened, and the why she did what she did. Having said that, lets begin. Jasnah leads Shallan on foot to a less reputable location in Kharbranth. During their walking, Jasnah takes off the glove covering her soulcaster to see better by. Shallan notices men watching them. Jasnah goes on a philosophical lecture on the nature of what it means to question versus accepting what one is told at face value. Youth versus experience. Jasnah then explains that the street they walk currently has on three separate occasions over the course of two months had theatergoers murdered. All three cases led to death, not “mere” robbery. Taravangian, the king himself has attempted to get the city watch in order to protect the street but with no success. The captain is connected to an influential light eyes. There is suspected bribery, but the fact of the matter is the street results in deaths, and there is no sign that the situation will change anytime soon if at all. So we have a clear statement that all attempts to reform the city guard, fix up the street, and or apprehend the murders have led to naught. That is the scenario Jasnah and Shallan walk into. Shallan notices dark shapes at the entrance of the alley where they came in, and at the other end. Jasnah and Shallan are now boxed in, with no escape in an alley know for murders. The individuals reveal themselves to be holding swords and knives. More support of their lethal intent. Finally by Shallan’s own thoughts, these men were out for their blood. These are men that clearly have lived each day knowing the noose is the only end they will see. Jasnah remains standing, and waits for the first guy to approach her. He swings his knife at her initiating the attack. Jasnah lifts her hand, touches him and changes him to fire. The other three are close enough that in their panic they trip over each other, and Jasnah (not needing to move other than to turn) reaches out and touches another man changing him to quartz. The last two men flee in opposite directions. Jasnah raises her hand and twin bolts of lightning shoot out and hit them at the same time turning them to smoke. Jasnah remains looking calm.\n\nThey call a palanquin and ride it heading back to Jasnah’s rooms. During the ride they discuss what just happened. Again they discuss the ethics of it, but at the core here are some definiable pieces of information. The men were planning to beat, rob, and kill both Jasnah and Shallan. Jasnah and Shallan walked through an alley displaying wealth knowing the alley’s reputation for murder. The men are now dead and can no longer continue their practices. Shallan states Jasnah did it to prove a point, did it to prove she could. Jasnah responds that she did not do it to prove a point. She explains that she did it to help Taravangian with a problem he could not fix. She recognizes him associating with a known heretic can cost him a lot, so sought to balance the scales as it were and do him a good turn. Jasnah then comments about “men like those”, which does imply there is something personal for Jasnah in wanting to see murderers off the street. She then confirms that the actions in the alley way were actions she chose to do for herself, nothing to due with Shallan’s lesson. However she used her actions as an opportunity to ask further questions. So the men’s deaths was not for the lesson. It was a separate action Jasnah had intended to take unrelated to Shallan in an effort to help a man she respects accomplish defending the city he loves, with a hint of personal vendetta against murderers. Finally Jasnah does not try to paint her actions in a favorable light, nor try to convince Shallan to see things her way. She presents Shallan with questions for Shallan to find the answers to on her own, fully knowing the result could be turning Shallan against her or losing her ward. The scene closes (for the purpose of this post) with Shallan pointing out that Jasnah did not have to kill them all. Jasnah replies that Shallan doesn’t know that they would have stopped after that, and where as a careless barmaid walking home the wrong way cannot protect herself, Jasnah can and will. Shallan points out that Jasnah lacks the authority to take such action in this city, to which Jasnah concedes the point. However as brought up earlier in the scene, going based on the city, not even the king was able to stop the murders. So it appears not even the king had the “authority” to do anything about it.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 559\n\nI did not include this scene because it is Shallan going over various in world philosophical thought on whether or not Jasnah’s actions were ethical. For myself, this post is to get to know Jasnah better as a person, both with favorable attributes and failings. I am not here to argue whether or not her actions were ethical. I am here to understand why she took the actions she did. So I have chosen to skip this scene.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 588\n\nFinally, Jasnah nodded, then returned to her research. “You have nothing to say?” Shallan said. “I just accused you of murder.” “No,” Jasnah said, “murder is a legal definition. You said I killed unethically.” “You think I’m wrong, I assume?” “You are,” Jasnah said. “But I accept that you believe what you are saying and have put rational thought behind it. I have looked over your notes, and I believe you understand the various philosophies. In some cases, I think that you were quite insightful in your interpretation of them. The lesson was instructive.” She opened her book. “Then that’s it?” “Of course not,” Jasnah said. “We will study philosophy further in the future; for now, I’m satisfied that you have established a solid foundation in the topic.” “But I still decided you were wrong. I still think there’s an absolute Truth out there.” “Yes,” Jasnah said, “and it took you two weeks of struggling to come to that conclusion.” Jasnah looked up, meeting Shallan’s eyes. “It wasn’t easy, was it?” “No.” “And you still wonder, don’t you?” “Yes.” “That is enough.” Jasnah narrowed her eyes slightly, a consoling smile appearing on her lips. “If it helps you wrestle with your feelings, child, understand that I was trying to do good. I sometimes wonder if I should accomplish more with my Soulcaster.” She turned back to her reading. “You are free for the rest of the day.” Shallan blinked. “What?” “Free,” Jasnah said. “You may go. Do as you please. You’ll spend it drawing beggars and barmaids, I suspect, but you may choose. Be off with you.”\n\nAfter two weeks of struggling with the morality and ethics of what happened with Jasnah, Shallan presents her findings. Despite Shallan disagreeing with Jasnah, Jasnah respects the process she went through to come to her conclusions. What is especially telling about this scene is when Jasnah muses on her use of the soulcasting. She says that she was “trying to do good” and that she “sometimes wonder if I should accomplish more with my soulcaster”. From Jasnah’s own mouth, she did not kill the men for cold, dispassionate reasons. She genuinely feels she was trying to make the world a better place and help Taravangian.\n\nSpoiler\n\nWay of Kings page 634\n\n“If you think to distract me with this conversation,” Kabsal noted, folding his arms and leaning back against the railing, “you won’t be successful. I sat up there with your disapproving mistress for well over an hour, and let me say that it was not a pleasant experience. I think she knows I still intend to try and convert"
