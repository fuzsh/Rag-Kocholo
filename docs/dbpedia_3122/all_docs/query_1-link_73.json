        "text": "The enjoyment of music is simply the satisfaction of recognizing truth. A major scale resolving right on time. A vocal harmony clicking into place alongside the lead. An internal rhyme scheme executed with effortless precision. A lyric so profound it stops you in your tracks. All of these are intangible and incredible truths that color our days.\n\nBut whose truths are worthy of such merit? Here we dip into an excess of ugly honesty; “cringe.” A withering epitaph for those who spill their guts with no consideration to time or place, no restraint. A word that crops up far too often when considering a certain subgenre of heavy music: nu-metal.\n\nAmongst the most despised genres of music ever, nu-metal is responsible for both the biggest debut album of the 21st century and the fastest-selling rock album of all time, yet its flagship artists still find themselves working to divorce themselves from the genre that they created and created them. Well into the 2010s mainstream music publications still found it necessary to strike down young bands that dared to fly the flag, while others took great pains to carve out their favorites from the rest of the tainted genre. Lacking in grunge’s tortured nihilism or emo’s hardcore roots, nu-metal achieved enormous success without managing to free itself from “cringe.” You can’t just say you love songs like “Last Resort” or “Bring Me to Life,” you have to qualify them as guilty pleasures that ‘you don’t care WHO knows you still listen to.’ Rejected by Generation X as blasphemy, and renounced by Millennials as embarrassing; nu-metal is the bastard child of musical phenomena.\n\nAll this rejection has an upside though, in that the entire scene and every album it produced feels underrated. Grunge was heralded as historic on impact while 3rd wave emo received its retrospective acclaim, but even the biggest nu-metal albums are rarely mentioned outside of specific genre lists. And far be it from some impenetrably difficult music, this shit is basically pop in drop tuning, a musical movement energized by commercial possibilities that swung for the fences as often as possible. Thus, even years deep into a supposed ‘nu metal revival’ the genre still feels like untrammeled ground. Acres of albums cut in million-dollar studios with six-figure music video budgets lost to time in the boom years of a genre nobody much bothered to catalog. It’s why, several years deep into my personal rabbit hole journey into this genre, I keep discovering new favorites.\n\nIt’s also why I’m so excited to introduce you to The Nu Metal Agenda’s 100 Greatest Nu Metal Albums of All Time, expanded from my original list of 50 with the help of an incredible community of writers who believe in this music as much as I do. My highest hope is that you don’t just appreciate the albums you know but discover something new too. So please; lace up those Adidas, cinch those JNCOs, pierce that eyebrow, and enjoy our list of the 100 Greatest Nu Metal Albums of All Time. — Holiday Kirk\n\n100. Design19‌‌\n\nTrigger\n\n‌‌[Mercury; 2002]\n\nLike the Oasis to Deftones’ Beatles, Design19 engage in extensive White Pony worship across Trigger, they completely lift a lyric from “Digital Bath” for the chorus of “Downstairs” (“We are downstairs / where no one can see”). But that White Pony devotion - with a dash of Lateralus (“Ars Magna Sciendi”) and Wisconsin Death Trip (“I Go Disco”) for good measure - feels fresh coming from an era well before Deftones worship became common enough to necessitate the invention of “nu-gaze.” And when Design19 achieve their own kind of liftoff on the magnificent “FFWD” it’s majestic enough that even Chino might have been a bit jealous. — Holiday Kirk\n\n99. Limp Bizkit‌‌\n\nStill Sucks\n\n‌‌[Suretone; 2021]\n\nTwo decades removed from their commercial peak Still Sucks marks a first for Durst in that it’s musically light, unencumbered with having to shore up Interscope’s quarterly earnings reports leaving him free to enjoy making music with friends. After chasing relevance with the political misfire of The Unquestionable Truth and the unbecoming immaturity of Gold Cobra, Durst’s marketing genius returns as the band settles into old age with an inviting abundance of “Dad Vibes” that attracted new fans and reinvigorate old ones too. They had nothing to prove and managed to prove it anyway. And that title? Limp Bizkit Still Sucks? Incredible. Fred Durst, man. Never count him out. — H.K.\n\n98. PAX217\n\n‌‌Twoseventeen\n\n‌‌[ForeFront; 2000]\n\n‘Precocious bible study youths perform reggae-toasting rap-rock dedicated to praising the Lord’ is possibly the worst elevator pitch I could possibly give about Pax217’s debut album and yet that’s what it is. And not only is it that, it’s… good? Trading 311’s smarm and weed-hazed arrogance for a faith in Jesus so innocently sincere it's almost blinding, Twoseventeen takes on added depth when good vibes get shaded by real tribulations. On “No Place Like Home” singer Dave Tosti begs his mom and dad to work out their issues instead of splitting up; his total faith in this possibility, and the likelihood that it won’t work, stings. It’s the moment every young, devout believer runs into eventually; the part where you realize God can’t fix everything no matter how hard you pray. — H.K.\n\n97. Adema‌‌\n\nAdema‌‌\n\n[Arista; 2001]\n\nThe inevitable fact of Adema’s existence is that singer Mark Chavez is Jonathan Davis’ half-brother. Did his family ties to the Korn frontman help his band land their debut album on Arista Records? Probably. Does he spend the duration of that debut singing exactly like Jonathan Davis? Right down to the swapping of every \"Me\" for a \"Moi.\" But the other big name to note isn’t just Davis’, it’s Arista Records then-president LA Reid, who won Adema in a three-way label bidding war. Adema’s relationship with Arista brings to mind the moment grunge meant every label needed their own token grunge band as a matter of policy. Arista needed a nu-metal band, thus, Adema. And indeed Adema sounds like a can’t-fail major label investment; shiny as hell, ghillied up with trendy electronic accents and a lyric sheet hell bent on ticking off every single cliche in the nu-metal pantheon (even Korn would have thought twice before calling a song “Pain Inside.”) But it works because Mark Chavez truly embodies the kid brother energy created by the Jonathan Davis' shadow . When the elder Davis sings about “spinning round and round” on Korn's “Falling Away From Me” it’s about the dizzying cycle of parental abuse, when Chavez does the same on “Freaking Out” it’s because his mom and dad say things that make him “mad” and “sad,” respectively. On “The Way You Like It” Chavez strikes a wholly unconvincing, yet fun as hell, big baller rapper persona that culminates in a triumphant “They always said I’d never be shit but look at me now!” sounding less like someone popping bottles at the club and more like the least popular kid in your neighborhood watching his new inground swimming pool being installed just in time for summer. — H.K.\n\n96. Linkin Park\n\n‌‌Reanimation\n\n‌‌[Warner Bros; 2002]\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, Mike Shinoda had weathered revolving MC aliases (Akira, Kenji), project name changes (Xero, Hybrid Theory), industry-wide rejection of his bands’ demo tapes, record label attempts to replace him, headlined arenas with maybe 50 minutes of material, and now surging transatlantic incredulity as to how his rap-rock band’s (Linkin Park) debut album (Hybrid Theory) rocketed from major label development hell to unsinkable chart juggernaut. As a victory lap, now flush with record industry clout, Shinoda wrangled underground hip-hop legends (including Bay Area rap royalty from Dilated Peoples and Zion I) into shared billing with Korn’s Jonathan Davis and Deftones’ Stephen Carpenter, carving their names onto Warner Bros jewel cases across four hemispheres. God knows how many middle schoolers dove into the discographies of Jurassic 5 and The Roots after first hearing Chali 2na’s and Black Thought’s voices on this album. Principally produced and engineered by Mike on the tour bus between shows, interviews, and gunning for remixes from Björk, Aphex Twin, and PJ Harvey, Reanimation, the fourth best-selling remix album of all time (one spot ahead of no less than The Beatles), is the sound of Mike Shinoda spotting weaknesses in the walls between metal, rap, and pop; accelerating the collapse of genre and rewiring the brains of millions of impressionable Bush-era youth into developing a beginner’s ear for hip-hop. Tracking the many evolutions between Hybrid Theory’s 1999 “Crawling” demo Reanimation's “KRWLNG” - with Bennington joined by Staind’s Aaron Lewis circling the song’s swirling, glitching hooks - and 100 Gecs' 2021 hyperpop deconstruction illuminates how the band saw their songs: as living things, refracting, reacting, forgotten then pushed back together, repeatedly regenerating. — Finchmeister\n\n95. Death Grips‌‌\n\nJenny Death\n\n‌‌[Harvest; 2015]\n\nWhen Jenny Death initially came out in 2015, it was released to practically universal acclaim from the Death Grips fanbase, but there was definitely a subset of haters out there that unflatteringly compared this album to nu-metal, at a time when nu-metal’s reputation was firmly in the dirt. Now, 8 years removed from Jenny Death’s release, yeah, this album is nu-metal, and that’s precisely why it rocks. You could stretch the definition of nu-metal and apply it to a number of Death Grips albums for their combination of forward-thinking, experimental hip-hop, and sticky pop songwriting, but Jenny Death hardly requires a reach at all as the band embraces their alternative and progressive metal influences with sex-obsessed borderline jock jam “Pss Pss” to introspective classic rock inverting epic “On GP”, Jenny Death is a slammer of an album that not only deserves its place in the canon for introducing core tenets of nu-metal to brand new listeners, but re-introducing those tenets for lapsed fans of the genre. — Matty Monroe\n\n94. Primer 55‌‌\n\nthe (New) Release‌‌\n\n[Island; 2001]\n\n\"I don't think we've hit the weeding-out period yet,\" Concrete Marketing president Bob Chiappardi remarked to Brian Reesman of Billboard magazine in June of 2001, \"We've got great new bands that are coming up the ranks [...] that I predict will be platinum plus bands this year.\" Of the seven he proceeded to name a whopping one would make it to the platinum mark (Saliva) while the rest languished far beneath gold status. The rest of Reesman’s Sustaining the Success article casts a quizzical eye at an industry that signed way more nu-metal bands than they could break, a roller coaster heading over the peak and getting its first look at the long drop. One of those - Memphis, Tennessee’s Primer 55 - was touted by Island Def Jam as the next Limp Bizkit just a year prior instead topping out around 100k sold for their debut album Introduction to Mayhem, a mammoth disappointment for the era. Only two years after their debut EP Primer 55 were already looking like has-beens. So they hustled back into the studio to crank out (The) New Release; and that’s ‘New Release’ as in new album but also new releases in the form of strip clubs (“Texas”), drugs (“Pills”) and alcohol (“Lou Evil.”) Where these vices were revealed in on Introduction, here they’re seedy and malicious. Unconventional instruments creep into the mix, vibraphones and a brass section that could have been lifted from a Tom Waits album. Frontman Jason \"J-Sin\" Luttrell swaps Introduction’s clownish b-boy styles for a bulldozing howl. It’s an altogether more engaging and promising effort that impresses for arriving so soon after their debut. It didn’t matter. It sold even worse than their debut and their record label, following disappointing returns and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, would pull support for the album after a scant two months on shelves. So little attention was paid that not only does lead single - the infuriated, anthemic “This Life” - not have a music video but the live performance that is labeled as “Official” on the band’s Vevo page features them completely fumbling the song’s breakdown. Another indignity forced on one of nu-metal’s hidden gems from its boom years. — H.K.\n\n93. Smile Empty Soul‌‌\n\nSmile Empty Soul‌‌\n\n[Lava; 2003]\n\nSmile Empty Soul’s 2003 debut isn’t special because Sean Danielson wants to be Kurt Cobain - everyone did - or that he couldn’t come close - nobody could - it’s that he’s sincere about it. In the post-grunge power vacuum left by Cobain’s suicide, wannabes like Seether and Puddle of Mudd blew up by filling rock radio’s need for more Nirvana-lite content and while Danielson got his own hit single off, the anthemic “Bottom of a Bottle,” his inspirations hemmed closer to In Utero deep cuts (dig those screams on “Radio in a Hole”) than “Come As You Are” knock offs. Even his misses are compelling; as clumsy as the lyrics of “This is War”’ might be (“I drove in a car / I flew in a plane / to kick your door in”) - not to mention some way overbearing string arrangements - its dull, rudimentary observations do a better job of reflecting the real-life struggles of underprivileged kids drafted to die in the Iraq War than, say, the bougie smarm of American Idiot did. But when Danielson lands it’s even better. Buried at the tail end of the album, after 12 tracks of insolent rage, “I Want My Life” suggests nothing less ambitious than “All Apologies” covered by self-titled era Elliott Smith, climaxing with a bridge so tender, so heart-rending, Danielson breaks the chains of influence and soars upon his own updraft for a brief, beautiful moment. — H.K.\n\n92. Nothingface‌‌\n\nAn Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity‌‌\n\n[DCide; 1998]\n\nWashington, D.C. natives Nothingface don’t pull punches on their sophomore release An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity. Critics and fans alike incessantly compared their first album, Pacifier, to Korn’s early nu-metal style, which seemingly caused the band to switch up their sound. Their second album solidified a transition to a more uniquely 'Nothingface' sound. Radio interludes and other audio samples break up songs while also keeping the album cohesive, in addition to adding a bit of underground spice. “Breathe Out,” the first single from the album, spotlights Tom Maxwell’s speedy riffs and Chris Houck’s sharp, thrashing drums. Matt Holt’s earnest vocals envelop the record, particularly during “The Sick,” where his melodic groans are contrasted with persistent screams. Images of hatred, violence, and fear are painted throughout the record, leaving the listener stricken by Holt's misanthropy. An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity is a substantial second release from a band that still had so far to go. — Paris Murrow\n\n91. Korn‌‌\n\nIssues‌‌\n\n[Immortal; 1999]\n\nIn 1999, Korn had big shoes to fill: their own. The prior year saw the release of Follow the Leader, the emblematic record that saw the band solidify their status as pop culture icons. How could the band follow up to nu metal perfection such as \"Freak On A Leash\" without disappointing the millions of eager eyes watching? Enter the release of Issues. It can’t be understated how this Korn release impacted music culture of the late 90s and early 2000s; the album’s lead single, \"Falling Away From Me,\" debuted on a South Park episode featuring the band themselves as voice actors, and went on to top TRL for ten days in a row. The album was #1 on the Billboard 200, beating big names like Dr. Dre and Celine Dion for the top spot. It seemed like the United States was Korn Kountry in the late 90s; the band were inescapable on the TV and radio. The disappointment everyone thought would be inevitable was not only avoided, but the band graced fans with an incredible record that has held up over the last 25 years, just like its predecessors. Eerie guitar effects from Munky and Head that make your skin crawl, heavy grooves from Fieldy and David Silveria, and agonizing yet captivating vocal performances from Jonathan Davis come together to create an essential listen for entry-level nu metal enthusiasts; few records capture the essence of the genre quite like this one. — Jasmine\n\n90. American Head Charge‌‌\n\nThe Feeding\n\n‌‌[DRT; 2005]\n\nAfter traversing the planet with artists like Slipknot and System of a Down in support of 2001’s The War of Art, some personnel changes, and being granted a release from American Recordings, American Head Charge brought a refreshed lineup and sound with 2005's, The Feeding. While once more prominent in their music, the samples became more subtle and the guitars more amplified, but the core of what people loved about American Head Charge remained true: passionate, thoughtful, and aggressive music that will either help assist in getting you a speeding ticket (“Cowards,” “Dirty” and “Pledge Allegiance”) or getting you deep in your feelings (“Take What I’ve Taken,” “To Be Me,” “Fiend.) While this record didn’t get the recognition many still think it deserves for a slew of reasons, to this day it’s highly regarded as a tremendous piece of work. Two music videos were released in support of this album: “Cowards” featuring UFC star Chuck Liddell, and “Loyalty,” starring the band in a run-down hospital staffed by the clown nurse depicted on the album cover. Unfortunately, due to label issues, it’s not available on streaming services, but it’s still worth grabbing the CD (especially if you can get your hands on the version released outside of the USA, as it has the bonus track “Downstream.”) — Shaylarz\n\n89. Filter‌‌\n\nThe Amalgamut‌‌\n\n[Reprise; 2002]\n\nWhen Filter's third studio album The Amalgamut was released in 2002, Richard Patrick was spiraling. Deep in the throes of drug and alcohol addiction, the Filter frontman mastermind was rescued only by a trip to rehab that canceled the tour and a furious Reprise, already hundreds of thousands of dollars deep into the project, yanked promo and dropped him from the label. Fittingly, The Amalgamut is a total mess. An engaging mess, mind you, the kind of mess appropriate for the urban blight Patrick had to draw on for inspiration after the Title of Record tour, but a mess only an alcoholic burning through the last of his rock star leeway could make. Its definitive moment comes on lead single and shoulda-been hit “Where Do We Go From Here.” It’s the grand finale of the Filter project’s definitive era, fusing “Take a Picture”'s acoustic stomp and “Hey Man Nice Shot”'s big riffs for the most melancholy send-off to the 90s and the older end of Generation X’s youth we’ve got. It’s the sound of the cultural lens moving beyond your age range, reducing all you hold dear to a nostalgic blur somewhere off camera. In the song’s music video, Patrick and company find themselves in a teenage party, seemingly by accident and certainly uninvited. They’re ignored unless acknowledged as inconveniences, present only when infringing upon the proceedings. The only time any of them seem to exist is when bassist Frank Cavanagh has a vase thrown at his head for walking in on a couple’s makeout session. They're still there, still a part of the party, but only because nobody cares enough to say leave. — H.K.\n\n88. Prodigy‌‌\n\nThe Fat of the Land‌‌\n\n[XL; 1997]\n\nHailed by Metal Hammer in 2019 after resident wildman Keith Flint’s passing as the band who “started a fire under metal that burned so brightly, it couldn’t be ignored,” Prodigy did with Fat of the Land what many nu-metal bands would later attempt to do; bringing together heaviness, pop sensibilities, danceable tunes, and a punk ethos to unite fanbases who previously would have been at each other’s throats. One only has to look at the tumble of electronica remixes and collaborations nu-metal bands would embark upon after Fat of the Land’s earth-conquering success for proof positive. Moving more towards rock than their previous work, Prodigy pulled off a record that defies genre-lumping, but deserves to be mentioned alongside any era-defining nu-metal albums. From the driving riff in “Breathe,” to the intensely drawn out climax of “Smack My Bitch Up,” to Flint’s sneering, scathing vocal delivery on “Firestarter,” the record has the same eager roots in hip-hop, rock, and electronic music that nu-metal did. With ‘97 seeing nu-metal on the brink of taking the world by storm, The Fat of the Land did its part and then some to explode the idea of heavy music as all consuming cultural amphetamine. — Manus Hopkins\n\n87. Chevelle‌‌\n\nWonder What's Next‌‌\n\n[Epic; 2002]\n\nFans of the band can, and will, argue that Chevelle has done better work since their 2002 breakthrough album (two million plus sold, peaking at 14 on the album charts) – not to mention argue whether they’re alt-metal and not nu-metal (I do not care) but none of, well, what came next for themselves and the countless bands they influenced would exist if it weren’t for the formula perfected here. Drop-tuning, loud-quiet-loud dynamics, a construction of airy space and claustrophobia that alternates between freeing and oppressive, riffs both chugging and melodic, and most importantly for the record’s success, soaring vocal hooks that feel agonized over and casually detached at once. Everyone knows the two big hits (\"The Red\" went to #56 on the Top 100; \"Send the Pain Below\" #65) and they are indeed transcendent, earning their spot in the alt-rock radio canon, but almost any song on the first half could’ve put the band on the map. Despite the intervening decades of creative success and widespread influence the band, and this record in particular have had, it all somehow feels criminally underrated. — Luke O'Neil\n\n86. The Workhorse Movement‌‌\n\nSons of the Pioneers‌‌\n\n[Roadrunner; 2000]\n\nIf you were paying really, really close attention around the turn of the millennium you may have noticed a few nu-metal bands started mixing some southern blues and boogie into their sound. Texas groups like The Union Underground and Drowning Pool; Memphis, Tennesee's Primer 55 with their sophomore effort (The) New Release; and Mount Pleasant, Michigan's The Workhorse Movement, whose debut Sons of the Pioneers is a one-of-a-kind amalgamation of jazz, blues, rap metal, and southern rock all slotted into the only real sub-genre a sound like that had a chance (nu-metal, natch). Tracks like \"Keep the Sabbath Dream Alive,\" \"Traffic,\" and \"Heavy\" are blunted with an upbeat weed-hazard sense of Friday night good times. Though their sound somewhat caught on in the UK (Kerrang! Magazine memorably described the band as \"The Stooges kicking seven shades of shit out of Sabbath at a Public Enemy show\") this album utterly bricked as the sound of nu-metal took a turn for dour post-grunge. It's a shame but, leaves Sons of the Pioneers an untrammeled gem to be discovered. — H.K.\n\n85. Cheem‌‌\n\nGuilty Pleasure: Deluxe Edition‌‌\n\n[Lonely Ghost; 2023]\n\nFed up with waiting around for pop-punk and nu-metal to get their rears in gears and start evolving again Connecticut's own Cheem grab both by the scruff and drags them forward at once on the nuclear bomb of inspiration and optimism that is Guilty Pleasure. Packing a few albums worth of ideas into 22 minutes; Guilty Pleasure functions both as surface-level pop thrills and deeper metatextual commentary on the impulse to deny yourself the surface-level joys of turntable solos and rap breakdowns. Songs like \"Clueless\" and \"Cheem SZN\" taunt you for standing outside their playground while simultaneously inviting you in, a sweet-n-sour combination communicated expertly through Sam Nazz and Skye Holden's Bennington/Shinoda level connection if the Linkin Park duo were raised in midwest DIY venues. And the deluxe edition - issued a year later with the roaring \"Migraine\" and the Meteora-worthy \"EOE\" standing tall as the album proper's new capstones - improves on perfection, looking back at an impressively deep catalog while pointing towards the future of a band with a vast distance left to run. — H.K.\n\n84. Amen\n\n‌‌Amen‌‌\n\n[Roadrunner; 1999]\n\nAfter the dissolution of Florida hardcore punk band Disorderly Conduct, frontman Casey Chaos migrated to Los Angeles where he made a brief appearance for one album and several shows with Christian Death before recording an almost entirely solo album called Slave under the name Amen (taken from the title of Disorderly Conduct’s sole full-length release). That led to a collaboration with Ross Robinson, who had already struck gold with the likes of Korn and other nu-metal heavyweights, and subsequent signing to Roadrunner Records. While Chaos and the band vehemently denied that they were nu metal (bassist John “Tumor” Fahnestock infamously wore a shirt reading “FUCK NU METAL” in block letters for multiple tours), in hindsight it’s hard to see this album as anything but. From the opening riffs of \"Coma America\" and through the angst that absolutely drips off tracks like \"No Cure For The Pure\" this album has all the ingredients for a classic of the genre. This may qualify as “nu” more than some other bands who leaned more heavily into their punk & hardcore influences, on the basis of having Robinson on the boards and recruiting Tumor and Sonny Mayo of Snot; even if Tumor was against the nu label. By working with the most prolific producer of nu metal, sharing studio space, and touring, with Slipknot, not to mention appearances on the deeply nu-metal Tattoo the Earth tour, they assumed a prominent role in the peak era of nu whether they wanted it or not. — Mark Doubt\n\n83. Limp Bizkit‌‌\n\nChocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water‌‌\n\n[Interscope; 2000]\n\nWhat a genius maneuver this was. After the worldwide success of Significant Other and being blamed for Woodstock 99’s mayhem bacchanalia made Fred Durst into a household name, Durst beat the backlash by hustling everyone back into the studio and sat this plastic on every FYE, Tower Records, and Best Buy across America less than a year after Significant Other's release, which is how an album named after the appearance of a butthole and a non-sequitur involving a bottle of water Wes Borland saw at a gas station, did a million sold first week. So miraculous was their timing that not only did they avoid the 9/11-induced heavy music downturn they even shot a music video ballin' out of control on top of the World Trade Center almost exactly a year before it would be reduced to rubble, a powerflex on the entire post-Patriot Act future we will now all live and die in. The music therein betrays its rushed origins - “Full Nelson” and “Getcha Groove On” are hastily re-treads of “Stuck” and “N 2 Gether Now” respectively - but it sounds like a million bucks and is sequenced better than Significant Other with singles “Take a Look Around” and “Boiler” coming in the album's 4th quarter. Still, Chocolate Starfish hits hardest for the cultural moment it represents- a snapshot of a guy with a red baseball cap defying cultural gravity for three straight years. — H.K.\n\n82. Poppy\n\n‌‌I Disagree\n\n‌‌[Sumerian; 2020]\n\nNu metal has always been about more than just the music; it’s a culture, and also a product thereof. The Y2K internet age can be held responsible for the foundation of nu metal culture in its heyday and Poppy’s artistry and music are a great modern corollary. Before releasing I Disagree, Poppy dabbled in surrealist content on YouTube during the mid-2010s, paving the way for her creativity as a character and integrating a new age of the internet into her music. What makes I Disagree special isn’t that she just jumped straight into making nu metal after a rather prolific pop career, but that she combined the two genres into what we now know as Nu-Pop. For every downtuned riff and double-kick groove, the songs are filled out with lushly produced vocals and catchy melodies. It’s a record that surely has nu metal purists scoffing in dismissal, but undeniably brought new life to the genre. — RJ Martin\n\n81. Omerta‌‌\n\nHyperviolence‌‌\n\n[Self-released; 2020]\n\nSince the early 2010s, bands like Emmure and Of Mice & Men have been experimenting with fusing nu-metal into their more common metalcore and hardcore sounds. However, this fusion wouldn't reach its apex until the Houston-based Omerta kicked the door down with their 2020 album Hyperviolence, quickly becoming one of the most hotly sought-after heavy bands working. From the opening notes of \"Payback,\" Hyperviolence pushes its boot into your neck and refuses to let up. It's a sound faster and more intense than anything nu-metal had seen to date and merely hints at an explosive future yet to come. —RigbyGender\n\n80. From First to Last‌‌\n\nHeroine‌‌\n\n[Epitaph; 2006]\n\nThe connection between post-hardcore and nu-metal is a sort of ‘Yes you are/no I’m not’ sibling rivalry that’s as productive as it is dysfunctional. So while At the Drive-In, Glassjaw, Refused, Blood Brothers, and Thursday will not be making appearances on this list, (pity) Tampa, Florida's From First to Last, will. Their album Heroine bridged gaps between post-hardcore, emo, and nu-metal with such precise precision that not including them would be perverse. Consider the facts: produced by nu-metal godfather Ross Robinson, featuring Limp Bizkit’s Wes Borland on bass, and fronted by future Korn collaborator Sonny Moore (a.k.a. Skrillex) From First to Last were already showing up with enough incidental nu-metal cred that the chaotic drop tuneage of tracks like “Mothersound” and “Afterbirth” should be, but aren’t, an afterthought. Instead, Heroine rages better than most post-hardcore and bounces harder than most nu-metal, a potent combination yet to be topped. — H.K.\n\n79. HEALTH‌‌\n\nVol 4: Slaves of Fear‌‌\n\n[Loma Vista; 2019]\n\nIt was the most withering criticism they could imagine: “there’s already a nu-metal track called ‘Numb’.” This was how Pitchfork.com described HEALTH’s VOL 4 :: SLAVES OF FEAR highlight “FEEL NOTHING.” Between the derisive Linkin Park comparisons and the devastating 3.4 out of 10 awarded this was the most vicious judgment they could pass upon their once darling HEALTH in 2019. Five years on, VOL 4 :: SLAVES OF FEAR has aged spectacularly well, sidechaining the ‘noise’ in the band’s ‘noise rock’ to an urgent, eager industrial assault on the ears that sticks around long after the music has been switched off. “BLACK STATIC”’s aggro post-Zombie ‘kroove,’, “SLAVES OF FEAR”s sun-shy wallop; all of it points to a future in which post-Trent/Atticus industrial can intersect with accessibility, a future that HEALTH continues to soldier towards. Retrospectively, Pitchfork’s Linkin Park comparisons feel complimentary, not harsh, the mark of a band ahead and a publication behind the times. — H.K.\n\n78. .sPout.‌‌\n\nTULC‌‌\n\n[Pate Records; 2002]\n\nIn much the same way that Andrew W.K. replaced hair metal’s slavering misogyny with zen koans about partying, .sPout. trade nu-metal’s scowling misanthropy for goofy grins and... well, zen koans about partying. TULC (short for The Ultimate Love Connection) is filled with songs like “Do You Wanna Dance” and “Sicksong” that leap about with tongues a-flop and positive vibes to spare as front-man Stefan Unterweger - who raps like a 12-year-old kid half remembering and half inventing the lyrics to \"Nookie\" on the school playground - while circling, circling again and double underlining his ideas until they become almost profound. From opener “It’s Time to Rock”; “No tick tock tick! Timeless is my tactic to rock! It makes me sick! To hear a ticking clock!” If it clicks with you, you’ll achieve enlightenment; the past was yesterday, the future doesn’t exist yet, “our backpacks are full of six-packs” and right now it is time to rock. It’s all so adorable that when Unterweger drops the b-word on “Go Ahead” you’ll want to wash his mouth out with soap. — H.K.\n\n77. System of a Down‌‌\n\nMezmerize‌‌\n\n[American Recordings/Columbia Records; 2005]\n\nFor a certain subset of Americans, the second half of the aughts was looking bleak on multiple fronts. Fresh off a second George W. Bush election win, the United States continued its seemingly endless occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan while high-ranking members of government lined their pockets off the 'War on Terror' with a never-ending battery of cost-plus contracts. Against this backdrop, System of a Down’s Mezmerize hits like the first gasp of someone realizing they may not be drowning after all. Following the somber \"Soldier Side - Intro,\" first single “B.Y.O.B.” is a dramatic return to the in-your-face politics of Toxicity-era System. “Why do they always send the poor,” screams Daron Malakian right out of the gate, blasting the American military machine and the public’s willingness to turn a blind eye and party on while it keeps grinding. Yet this represents the peak of Mezmerize's Michael Moore-style pop politics as the band almost completely abandons them for Dadaist dick-measuring contests (“Cigaro”), bemused meditations on their own success (“Radio/Video,” “Lost in Hollywood”), even a poignant reflection on human mortality (“Question!”). And we can’t forget “Violent Pornography,” a resoundingly silly track where the band expresses their not-quite-convincing disgust with a particularly brutal porno. Ultimately, Mezmerize feels like a band with a lot to say, questioning whether anyone’s still listening, and doing their best to have fun making music with each other in spite of it all. — Gabi Brown\n\n76. Rage Against the Machine‌‌\n\nThe Battle of Los Angeles‌‌\n\n[Epic; 1999]\n\nBy the end of ‘99, the metal landscape that Rage Against the Machine has ascended looked completely different than it did when they debuted. Emerging and rival acts had warped the band's strident leftism into pedagogical angst, but instead of throwing in the towel and throwing stones from on high, The Battle of Los Angeles proved those emerging and rival acts still had a ways to go before being able to challenge RATM for their throne. The Battle of Los Angeles attempts to balance their political convictions - “Voice of the Voiceless,” an ode to Black Panther Abu Mumia Jamal - over tracks accessible enough to be heard blaring from the soundtracks of video games like Madden 10, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You wouldn't expect the message of such a staunchly anti-capitalist act to reach the masses via best-selling video games or pre-game tailgating sessions. But as \"Testify\" and \"Sleep Now in the Fire\" achieved the kind of MTV heavy rotation that nets you enough cultural clout to hold court on TRL and throw a tantrum at the VMAs - over losing an award to Limp Bizkit of all things - it began to be increasingly difficult to separate the band's rage from capitalism's double platinum embrace. One covers album later and Zach would walk while the remaining lineup collapsed into Audioslave with Soundgarden's Chris Cornell as frontman. It's impossible to say what the 2000s would have been like had they held it together but it's easy to say this list wouldn't exist if they had never arrived. — Jordan_T729 and H.K.\n\n75. LOK‌‌\n\nNaken, blästrad och skitsur‌‌\n\n[Sonet; 1999]\n\nAt the turn of the millennium LOK was an inescapable force of nature in the Swedish musical landscape. Having graduated from local heroes (Partille represent) with a limited run EP out, they catapulted themselves into music video programming mainstays on the strength of swedish language Rap Metal singles (a scarce commodity even at the time) like \"LOK Står När De Andra Faller\" and \"Skrubbsår.\" Where this album succeeds most is in its ability to sound stripped down yet never simplistic; occasionally the crunching riffs will end to let era-typical processed lead guitar lines play out alone over the punk influenced drums and heavy bass grooves. It's a distinctly live inspired soundscape with little overt studio trickery going on for most of the record. At times it sounds like the instrumentals are about to outpace Martin Westerstrand as he raps, screams, and snarls at the moment just before falling behind the rest of his band. Even for non-Swedish speakers leaping the language barrier reveals a youthful, aggressive, and attitude-filled collection of songs falling stylistically between hardcore, rapcore, and nu metal that will satisfy the appetite of anyone hungering to party like it's 1999. — Young Bukowski\n\n74. Fleshwater\n\n‌‌We're Not Here to Be Loved‌‌\n\n[Closed Casket Activities; 2022]\n\nWhen you hear the name Fleshwater, you’re probably expecting some sort of death metal band with an unreadable logo and blood and guts album artwork, not sidewalk chalk font and a rubber (?) ducky. Fleshwater is the side project of a few members of the popular hardcore band Vein.fm alongside Marissa Shirar, creating a historically minded yet forward thinking blend of grunge, shoegaze, post-hardcore, and nu-metal of the nineties. Tracks like “Baldplate Driver” and “Foreign” have their shoegaze elements on full display while “The Razor’s Apple” and “Kiss The Ladder” have that more aggressive grunge-hardcore. “Woohoo” and “Closet” are very apparent with their nu-metal/alternative metal. And for the pièce de résistance Freshwater connect the close dots between Bjork and nu-metal with a raging cover of \"Enjoy.\" They're not here to be loved but are loved regardless. — xgottsegenx\n\n73. Slipknot\n\n‌‌Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses‌‌\n\n[Roadrunner; 2004]\n\nWe arrive at the inevitable Serious Album. In which, like Green Day before and Linkin Park after, a band previously dismissed as featherweight invites a superstar producer into the studio and sets about proving they have something to say. Blessedly, since nu-metal was still being disparaged in its entirety, for Slipknot that project never rises above ballads, none of which work for me— Corey is an effective frontman, not a “lead singer.” Still, Vol. 3’s pleasures are hearing this band blowing 100% of the assumedly massive budget from Roadrunner as they replace Ross Rob with Rick Rube, trade Indigo Ranch for Houdini’s Mansion, and pack this thing with all kinds of requisite studio excesses. This absolutely does pay dividends - “Before I Forget” is a firecracker of a Grammy-winning hit single and if you catch me on the right day I’ll swear “Duality” is the greatest nu-metal song of all time - but by album’s end it’s clear Slipknot are reaching their limitations. But what an incredible ride it was getting there. — H.K.\n\n72. Karnivool‌‌\n\nThemata\n\n‌‌[Independent/MGM Distribution; 2005]\n\nThere was a clear demarcation in the global metal scene before and after the release of Meshuggah’s 2002 album Nothing. The djent sound is ubiquitous now, but it was a rare nu-metal band that incorporated djent’s signature rhythms into their sound while it was still relatively fresh. Karnivool got their start covering Nirvana and Carcass songs around their home city of Perth in Western Australia, but 2005’s Themata is the birth cry of something stunningly unique. Multi-instrumentalist Drew Goddard lays down a dizzying mix of bounce riffs, jazz chords, and rapid-fire licks over syncopated drum patterns that range from driving and catchy to downright mind-boggling. The album hits its stride at the third track, “Shutterspeed,” an upbeat djent-tinged anthem catapulted to the top shelf by Ian Kenny’s soaring vocals, and kicking off a sequence of songs that aren’t quite nu, aren’t quite prog, but are all undeniable. By the time we hit “Scarabs,” a chaotic math-metal assault, Karnivool have firmly established themselves as a band that can do anything and knock it out of the park. Later albums would see them take a page from contemporaries Cog and lean into their progressive instincts, but Themata remains as an exciting glimpse of a road nu metal could have taken if it had been a little braver, a little less obsessed with depressive navel-gazing, and willing to get a little starry-eyed looking toward the horizon. — Gabi Brown\n\n71. Chimaira‌‌\n\nPass Out of Existence\n\n‌‌[Roadrunner; 2001]\n\nPass Out of Existence, Chimaira's 2001 Roadrunner debut, stands as the band's singular foray into pure-nu. Tracks tend to lean more heavily into the metal side of the spectrum such as the stuttered d-beat of “Let Go”, the double bass and chugging riffs on “Severed.\" A guest appearance by Stephen Carpenter of Deftones on “Rizzo” cements the bizarre riffs laid down by Rob Arnold and Jason Hager as the off-kilter timing makes everything sound like the band was in the process of being abducted by a UFO while recording. Mark Hunter's rampant insecurity and vitriol for his former partners is on full display in a lyrical outing that Jonathan Davis might consider oversharing. Hunter’s tendencies to call for violence and graphic fantasies involving self-harm can also be downright misogynistic at times but what earns this album a place in nu history is also what Chimaira fought to move away from going forward (2003 follow-up, The Impossibility of Reason, was essentially a death metal album.) Pass Out of Existence stands as what Hybrid Theory might have been if Mike Shinoda grew up on Slayer or Nine Inch Nails. Dirty, murky, and downright weird, this album encapsulates what 2001 was about for aggressive nu metal, and it wasn't always pretty or radio-friendly. — Cranfather\n\n70. Machine Head‌‌\n\nThe Burning Red\n\n‌‌[Roadrunner; 1999]\n\nShortly after departing from legendary Bay Area thrash outfit Vio-Lence, Robb Flynn formed what would become Machine Head in an Oakland warehouse. Following the departure of founding guitarist Logan Mader in 1998, Ahrue Luster joined on lead guitars, and as a contributing songwriter. Their third studio album, The Burning Red, saw them work with Ross Robinson, by then already renowned for having produced Korn and Slipknot. While few today would consider Machine Head a nu metal band, there is little question as to whether The Burning Red is a nu metal album. From the first track following the instrumental intro, \"Desire to Fire,\" it's obvious Robb is enthusiastically embracing the emerging subgenre with bits of rapped vocals and a bouncing disco drumbeat. Responses at the time were certainly mixed, with some fans disliking the use of hip-hop influences or otherwise finding fault with Robinson’s production and their departure from the more groove metal sound of their earlier albums. Flynn said in 2012 regarding the backlash “If all that people got out of [The Burning Red] was rap-metal, then they didn't fucking listen to it.\" Fans who disliked the album were apparently a vocal minority; it stands as their second best selling release, surpassed only by their debut Burn My Eyes. In 2023 we can look back with over two decades of hindsight to see that Machine Head was ahead of the curve in adapting to new trends in heavy music. The Burning Red showed Flynn and his cohorts not only could run with the newer crowd, but continue to influence multiple subgenres of metal going forward. From this day, one can hardly help headbanging and/or grooving to this one. — Mark Doubt\n\n69. hed(pe)‌‌\n\nhed(pe)\n\n‌‌[Jive; 1997]\n\nBack in 1994, a young-ish SoCal beach bum named Jahred Gomes took some mushrooms and headed to a benefit concert for imprisoned activist Leonard Peltier. The lineup was amazing — Rage Against the Machine, the Beastie Boys, Cypress Hill, and L.A. punk band X — but for Jahred it was tantamount to a religious experience. “That just made me go, ‘Oh, this is what I want to do,’” he relayed to the Garza Podcast nearly 20 years on. “And by this, I mean ALL of this. I want to rock like Rage, I want to rap like fucking Cypress, I want to get down like the Beasties and I want to be punk like X.” This epiphany resulted in (hed) p.e.’s ramshackle debut, which dropped 12 days after Limp Bizkit’s more ballyhooed Three Dollar Bill, Y’All. Jahred spun fanciful tales about government cover-ups of alien visitation, but also touched on racism he experienced growing up – and the music largely sounded great. But without a fluky George Michael cover up their sleeve, they didn’t sell enough copies to even pay back their advance. (Not to mention, even if he was doing it purely for shock value – Jahred’s contention – there’s simply no justification for songs like \"Ken 2012\") Regardless, over the years, (hed) p.e.’s style became steadily more jaded and subversive, their questionable lyrics harder to overlook with Jahred's descent into 9/11 conspiracy theories and the like. As such, (hed) p.e. is generally one of the more maligned nu-metal era bands and yet, there are Reddit threads filled with people for whom those early albums meant a great deal, and Jahred seems to have mellowed into an affable dude who claims to eschew most of his old conspiracies, conquered his addictions, and dotes on his wife and two kids. He also still loves making music, though thankfully like Jahred himself, his tastes have evolved significantly. — Bryan Horowitz\n\n68. Korn‌‌\n\nThe Nothing\n\n‌‌[Roadrunner/Elektra; 2019]\n\nAfter decades of articulating the pain inside Jonathan Davis found himself having to wrestle with something new; grief. Written in the wake of the deaths of Davis' wife and mother the bagpipes and funeral tempo of opener “The End Begins” mirrors Issues intro “Dead” but it's closer \"Surrender to Failure\" that answers the call of \"Dead\"'s “All I want in life is to be happy” with a wracked, despairing \"I failed.\" Korn were a band that blew up their tribulations into nine-million-megawatt scale sound but when \"You'll Never Find Me\" ends with a quiet, modest, final refrain of \"I'm not doing fine\" it'll puncture your heart as accurately as any \"Falling Away From Me\" or \"Freak On a Leash\" could. Clocking at a trim 44 minutes, The Nothing overcomes its Octane-radio-core production with the most committed vocal performances from Davis in a decade and some truly vicious riffing that makes the polished chorus hooks soar. It's a late-career triumph wrought from the worst of circumstances and, in the process, becomes something inspirational rather than defeated. — H.K.\n\n67. The Mad Capsule Markets\n\n‌‌OSC-DIS‌‌\n\n[Speedstar; 1999]\n\nFormer Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman once said the difference between American and Japanese pop music is the fact that Japan enjoys less than perfect singers for the vulnerability and personality it adds to the music. Mad Capsule Markets vocalist Kyono’s raps are barked and his singing is shouted in both Japanese and English, lending the kind of personality Japan could appreciate, while Americans were left confused. From their humble roots as an underground hardcore punk band, the boys from Yokohama evolved their sound by adding industrial elements, rapped vocals, and experimentation with the English language lyrics, finally coalescing into the 1997 release Digidogheadlock, the album that started the sound they would eventually perfect in their 1998 digital hardcore masterpiece OSC-DIS. OSC-DIS is a relentless yet varied attack of amen break loops, bass-centric riffs, and heavily distorted vocals all tied together by hooks you can’t help but sing along with no matter what language is being spoken. From the surf punk vibe of “All the Time in Sunny Beach” to the atmospheric aura of “Step Into Yourself” to the hard-hitting rap metal of opening track “Tribe”, the album switches up styles while maintaining its identity. Promotion for the album followed a similar pattern of diversification; DVDs of the four music videos came bundled with the album for the US release and a video game based on their mascot came bundled with one of the CD singles. Additionally “Pulse” appearing in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 brought the band well-deserved attention overseas, perfectly fitting the futuristic Tokyo park used for the final competition. While “Pulse” is by far their most known song in the West, the closing track “Midi Surf” sums up the album perfectly; rapping Japanese vocals over a Helmet-like riff showing off the band’s harder side before transitioning into four pop chords with Kyono slurring out some positive encouragement; “I’m stoked this fine day”. — Smoothie\n\n66. 100 gecs\n\n‌‌10,000 gecs‌‌\n\n[Atlantic; 2023]\n\nIt seems like the primary objective for Laura Les and Dylan Brady's major label follow-up to their hyperpop breakout 1000 Gecs was to do the absolute most in the least amount of time: in 26 minutes and 53 seconds. We get a perky ska song with ribbits on the 2s and 4s (\"Frog On The Floor\"); a turntable backspin slicing up the THX deep note (\"Dumbest Girl Alive\"); digital distortion ripping the robo-phrase \"one million dollars\" to shreds (\"One Million Dollars\"); and most importantly, the undeniable zest of nu-metal. It's there on the ill-tempered \"Billy Knows Jamie,\" which aligns with the fine nu-metal tradition of writing a song about a scary dude who wants to murder you (\"Jamie's gonna make your ass one with the Earth / But first, he's gonna make your ass one with the hurt.\") It's there in the elastic bass and harmonic whine of junk food banger \"Doritos & Fritos.\" And it's certainly all over album highlight \"The Most Wanted Person In The United States,\" a smart-alecky rap number that exalts a sample of \"Insane In The Brain\" by Cypress Hill through verses about killing someone's dad, taking his money, and then having Anthony Kiedis sucking on your penis. All of it is perfectly dumb, perfectly dark, perfectly silly, and none of it would work in the slightest if it weren't so goddamn catchy. — Molly Mary O'Brien\n\n65. Apartment 26‌‌\n\nHallucinating\n\n‌‌[Hollywood; 2000]\n\nApartment 26 made industrial nu metal in the post-Nine Inch Nails/Ministry tradition but unlike their peers using such machinery for gloom and doom Apartment 26 were impish, even giddy at times. “Finished looking for the answers now I'm looking for the question,” frontman Biff entices on the three-minute strobe and neon rollercoaster plummet “Backwards.” Synthetic pleasures abound - the ultra satisfying “Nice.” sample drop on “Apt. 26,” the elegantly trip-hopped “The Fear,” the tent leveling synths of “Basic Breakdown” - wrapped in the gleeful confidence of a band that was too young to be this depraved and too good to be this disappeared (somehow a band that toured with Ozzfest doesn’t have a single live video.) Still, when Hallucinating is on you’re the one asking to be dealt in and Apartment 26 are holding all the cards. — H.K.\n\n64. Dir En Grey\n\n‌‌Vulgar\n\n‌‌[Firewall Div.; 2005]\n\n2005 may have been past the initial peak of nu metal in America, but Japan would deliver some of the zaniest, most forward-thinking, and sharply distinct nu metal of the era. Slowly shedding the glitzy, visual kei inspired image of their early career, Dir En Grey set out for dominance with their fierce, and at times deeply disturbing Vulgar. Released in the winter of 2003, the ringing metallic percussion of the intro \"audience KILLER LOOP\" lulls you into a false sense of security before the tone of the album properly bursts into your face, with all of its dark, raw and blown-out production. It smacks you clear across the face with its energy and doesn't let up from the moment it ends. The album's most well known track \"OBSCURE\" embodies the ethos of this album perfectly, with its bouncey as all hell Drop A riffs that will make you want to run face first into a wall. It's creepy, it's heavy, at times sorrowful yet still beautiful, and a sorely underappreciated gem. — Orion\n\n63. Linkin Park‌‌\n\nMeteora‌‌\n\n[Warner Bros; 2003]\n\nIt wasn’t just other rock bands that couldn’t figure out how to top Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park couldn’t do it either. Meteora, instead of attempting Linkin Park’s big evolution, finds new formations in the formulas, expanding rather than transforming. Thank god, no band before or since put the pieces together quite like Linkin Park and we should be thankful they gave us one more album of hyper-consistent nu-metal to enjoy before the anti-nu metal propaganda got to them. As the Bad to Hybrid Theory's Thriller, Meteora is heavier (“Don’t Stay”), poppier (“Numb”), more hip-hop (“Nobody’s Listening”), and more instrumental (“Session”) in pursuit of further world domination. Through and through, Meteora is an effective, accomplished follow-up to an impossibly high peak. It’s also where the story of Linkin Park: nu-metal band, comes to an end. Where would they have gone if allowed to expand upon something like “Breaking the Habit”— deftly fusing the band’s tight melodies and electronics to something that charts a way forward that they ultimately couldn’t take as the pressures to betray the soon-to-be passe nu metal scene for designer sunglasses and Rick Rubin took hold. Linkin Park’s run as nu-metal’s definitive band was short, but rock music is still living in the impact crater they left behind. — H.K.\n\n62. Pitchshifter\n\n‌‌www.pitchshifter.com‌‌\n\n[Geffen; 1998]\n\nThere's something deeply, bitterly spiteful about Pitchshifter’s www.pitchshifter.com. On one hand, it's a Godflesh clone going junglist massive at the height of the genre. It's snotty and quick when there once were growls and metallic dirges. However on the other hand, contrary to the metal elitists at the time (and still to this day,) this album, their first major label release, goes above and beyond the level of Pitchshifter’s previous output, to the point of intentionality. It's openly political in a crass, anti-authority way, while deeply respectful of its own allusions to early jungle, in both lyrics and praxis (what other nu metal album has a track filled with one-shot snares and beats?) It's filled with proto-DnB breaks and synth stabs, the kind of big beat bombast you’d hear on the Matrix soundtrack. It's filthy, grimy, and if you don't like it, it’ll kindly tell you to toss off before pushing you in front of a speeding London Underground train. — Cleo T\n\n61. Static-X‌‌\n\nWisconsin Death Trip\n\n‌‌[Warner Bros; 1999]\n\nWhen bands like Ministry and Nine Inch Nails incorporated mechanical components and harsh vocals to their songs in the early nineties, nu-metal's rise demanded a poppier counterpoint to satiate the masses. Thus, Static-X's Wisconsin Death Trip went platinum within two years, an indisputable testament to its addicting sound and replayability. In a 2019 interview, producer Ulrich Wild shed some light on how Static-X achieved their characteristic industrial sound despite small budget and short production time; custom drum triggers rigged from pieces of wood and microphones generate the relentless, chugging drum-machine sound without employing a drum-machine, and cymbals are played overtop. Guitarist Koichi Fukada provided the synth lines using the earliest model of a groovebox–a new technology at the time. The band’s creativity and technical skill outshone any limits of funding or equipment and resulted in a compelling use of amateur equipment that sounded partially mechanical but still contained distinct traces of personality. The unique setup really shines in “December” and “The Trance is the Motion,” where frontman Wayne Static's vocals start out softer and the beat is a bit slower than the rest of the album allowing the drums and mixing to come forward. In other songs, the beats are faster and the members use audio samples, vocal layering of Static’s voice, and simple but fast-paced guitar riffs, creating tracks like “Push It” and “I’m With Stupid” that are easy for fans to dance and sing (or shout) along to at home or in concert. — Yumi\n\n60. Fear Factory‌‌\n\nObsolete‌‌\n\n[Roadrunner; 1998]\n\nReleased in July of 1998, Obsolete saw Fear Factory removing any self-imposed limitations and fully inspired to make a legendary genre album. Already a successful touring band with a certified classic under their belts (1995's Demanufacture), they turned to a story written by vocalist Burton C. Bell to inspire a full concept album that ebbs and flows with the tales of a world controlled by machines and the humans that struggle with existence as a result. A record like this could have very easily been a cold or calculating affair with the spectacularly controlled performance of Raymond Herrera behind the kit. However, Obsolete is bursting with the organic energy of a live show. Their cover of “Cars”, later added as a bonus track and featuring Gary Numan himself (who also appears on the title track) catapulted the album to its gold status, remaining their best-selling record to date. The lineup that recorded Obsolete is very likely never reuniting due to in-fighting, and only guitarist Dino Cazares remains a member. It’s a real shame because, to many fans, Obsolete remains the crown jewel in the Fear Factory catalog. — Cranfather\n\n59. Psycore\n\n‌‌Your Problem\n\n‌‌[V2; 1998]\n\n“Love is a helmet / and there’s a war outside” is a versatile lyric, as easy to imagine wailed by a pop diva as shrieked by an emo chanteuse. But how about dryly intoned by a conspicuously bearded Swede over some nu-metal? Markus Jaan gravely speaks his verses like a worn-down salaryman ashing his cigarette behind a bar, someone who has been there done that and wants you to do a little better than he did. His naked voice is the first sound on the record, a tensely muttered “I can never be / what you want me to be / I can never do what you want me to” then a brutish nu-metal drop highlighted by the best snare sound this side of Terry Date’s mixing board. Jaan’s pragmatic spoken word is offset with an urgent shout, a coworker letting the office know he’s had it up to here and will take no more of this shit. But for every drop of nu-metal philosophy, there’s always something hilariously off-kilter to offset; songs about chocolate milkshakes or a finale that swaggers back into the office the next day hammered drunk. That lyric about love being a helmet? It’s followed with a question: “How come you can’t accept the fat sweaty person on the seat next to you on the concord to paradise?” Let’s see the pop diva try that one on for size. — H.K.\n\n58. Evanescence‌‌\n\nFallen\n\n‌‌[Wind Up; 2003]\n\nHailing from Little Rock, Arkansas, Evanescence made waves within their local scene, releasing several demos and EPs before major label Wind Up came calling. Fronted by vocal powerhouse Amy Lee, Fallen introduces the band’s unique musical style, a seamless marriage between contemporary metal and classical music. Tension between songwriters Ben Moody and Amy Lee results in a compelling coupling of guitarist Moody's du jour nu-metal alongside Lee's higher aspirations of gothic fancy. Reaching a peak on \"Bring Me to Life,\" the dueling impulses collide spectacularly, with guest vocalist Paul McCoy's clenched fist grunting providing ballast to Lee's emotive wails, much to her dismay and radio’s delight. Enchanting church choirs and pianos pull tracks together, such as the devastating piano ballad “My Immortal” and the overwhelming fight for self-control in “Haunted.” Themes of Christianity are also touched upon, particularly in “Tourniquet,” which centers around a desperate plea to a higher power for salvation from self harm. Lee’s spellbinding artistry and Moody’s interests in the mainstream helped the record’s commercial performance, scoring a number 7 spot on the Billboard 100. A not-insignificant portion of the record’s resonance is owed to its female perspective, something that was only occasionally explored in the nu-metal scene but explored evocatively here with millions of young women responding in kind, propelling the album to evenual diamond sales. Fallen presents a larger-than-life tale of battling life’s greatest challenges, solidified by Lee’s soul-stirring vocals and unflinching melodrama; ultimately delivering an unforgettable narrative of love, loss, and an erosion of the self. — Paris Murrow\n\n57. Çilekeş‌‌\n\nY.O.K.\n\n‌‌[On Air Müzik; 2005]\n\nY.O.K. is an abbreviation for “Yalnız Olma Korkusu”, which can be translated as \"Fear Of Loneliness.\" Understandably, a bunch of guys can feel lonely making nu-metal music in a half-middle-eastern, half-European country. Modern Turkish history can be read as a duel between Middle Eastern influences and European ideals. This is what many Turkish rock bands sound like, and Ankara band Çilekeş’s Y.O.K. is no exception.\n\nIn a letter to Robert Hooke in 1675, Isaac Newton made his probably most famous statement: “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants”. When you make nu-metal, a relatively new and inherently American music genre, you don’t have too many giant shoulders to stand on. Y.O.K.’s success lies in the fact that they’ve chosen the right ones: Deftones, Korn, Linkin Park, and even Dredg exist alongside Turkish and Arabesque musical contributions. Melancholy and anger are always there, as Y.O.K.’s real value stems from the harmony of heartfelt emotional expression and musical prowess. Çilekeş had the chance to support Deftones in their one and only Istanbul concert. You should give them a chance, too. — Emre Alper\n\n56. Loathe\n\n‌‌I Let it In and it Took Everything\n\n‌‌[SharpTone; 2020]\n\nHow genuinely Loathe illustrates the screening of horror, guilt, and betrayal - it rivals an oil painting. I Let It In and It Took Everything harrows the human condition in simulacrum, produced to the specific standards of nu-metal junkies. The then-quintet was fresh off of 2017’s The Cold Sun, a powerful record but one that, admittedly, was easy to lose track of. For their sophomore effort, Loathe evolved, aggressively, to an extent that completely reframes prior work. Guitarist Erik Bickerstaffe and vocalist Kadeem France are a breathtaking collaboration; balancing gentle serenity with feverish antagonism. Deftones comparisons are apt but Loathe go beyond simple nods at the Sacramento band's atmospheres and 'vibe' with real deal songwriting and dynamics. Wrapped in a savory, palatable mix that makes the record comfortable to admire when Loathe goes off script. The songwriting demands contemplation because there will always be new depths to I Let It In and It Took Everything. Each replay clarifies how sophisticated they are as musicians and, in turn, at expressing complex emotions. Chain yourself to it, and don’t let go. — Balloonfm\n\n55. Skrape‌‌\n\nNew Killer America\n\n‌‌[RCA; 2001]\n\nIt’s time to face facts; Staind ruined everything. When the Springfield, Massachusetts four piece’s power ballad “It’s Been Awhile” scaled the rock and pop charts to utterly own 2001 all of the hard-hitting, piledriving nu-metal acts that had been signed in the wake of Korn and Limp Bizkit’s success were yesterday’s news. Pity for Skrape, whose 2001 debut New Killer America couldn’t possibly have been more out of step with the times. Its neon bright technicolor sound, highlighted in marker with airy synths and industrial samples, brought together the unlikely fusion of “Pantera and The Cars,” as described to us by their former drummer Will Hunt. Singer Billy Keeton’s sideburned Flordiaman rasp pairs nicely with drummer Hunt’s headset mic, and Morgan Rose-style outbursts power songs like “What You Say” and “Isolated” onto higher heights than their misery-slinging peers. Maybe America didn’t get it but Japan heard this one loud and clear as the nation that embraced bands like Polysics and Mad Capsule Markets had their ears pricked by the band’s synthesizer, leading to greater success there than domestically, culminating in a triumphant performance at Summer Sonic festival in Tokyo. “We love your country Japan,” gruffs out Keeton before adding in the harshest Florida accent possible, “ARRI-GAHT-TOE.” — H.K.\n\n54. Unloco\n\n‌‌Healing‌‌\n\n[Maverick; 2001]\n\nOn a literal basis, Ünloco’s Healing is factory standard nu-metal. Abounding with lyrics about the pain, lyrics about being used, and lyrics about the pain of being used it’s easy to miss that over a tight 45 minutes, the whole becomes much more than the sum of its parts. Healing is excellently produced— thick guitar tones, meaty drum sound, elegant touches of spring reverb, and filler-free sequencing make for a rock-solid front-to-back listen. Even the lyrics reveal themselves as effective vehicles for clear, direct singing and screaming from Joey Dueñas rather than attempting any profundity. It’s the kind of album the genre deserved more of— a good one without any higher aspirations than being just that. — H.K.\n\n53. Stepa‌‌\n\nStepa‌‌\n\n[Locomotive Music; 2002]\n\nStepa’s self-titled debut is one of nu-metal’s most precious secrets. Passed around in .zip files and Google drives before finally making it to streaming services in early 2022, Stepa is an Interscope bankrolled effort that ended up buried, its major label origins revealed by songs as accessible as the genre’s most successful records while standing well outside of them. An extended psychedelic meditation on innocence close enough to taste but far enough away to be understood as gone, Stepa is filled with fantastical aquariums, Rubik’s Cubes, and eye candy intermingling with LucasArts SFX and 7-string guitar. “Confusion, simple brain, stupid frown on a pretty face,” singer Blake Beckman ponders on “Free” like a child staring with wide eyes at the adults around him. “When’s- it- my- turn- to explode / Ha ha ha!” Beckmann shrieks on “Mountain,” unfinished thoughts lost in excitement (\"I feel so happy I could / I feel so happy I could\") like a child whose second serving of mozzarella sticks just touched down. There’s trauma here too, rendered in panicky distant dream logic. “Spaceships and Airplanes,” another seemingly perfect pop-nu-metal glimmer that becomes darker with successive listens, is about the death of Beckmann’s brother in a car accident. “Let him go! Free and strong!” he wails through the breakdown before consoling, “I am with you wherever you are right now.” Trafficking real tragedy in the kind of innocent angst nu-metal provides, it’s a deeply touching moment, the beating heart at the center of Stepa’s curiosities. — H.K.\n\n52. Deftones‌‌\n\nDiamond Eyes\n\n‌‌[Reprise; 2010]\n\nOn February 28th, 2010, Deftones fans eagerly flocked to the band’s official website to hear their new single, \"Rocket Skates.\" Excitement and relief were palpable among their dedicated followers; the single came at a time of uncertainty about the band’s future due to bassist Chi Cheng’s tragic accident, and many speculated it could be the end. The release of Diamond Eyes is a resounding “no” to that inquiry. The auditory discontent that plagued their self-titled and Saturday Night Wrist releases is gone, replaced by the exact middle ground between Chino Moreno’s Robert Smith and 80s new wave inspirations and Stephen Carpenter’s eight-string heavy metal riffs. The record is a sonic reflection of unity brought forth by adversity and loss, and the result is an ethereal, atmospheric body of work that reminds us why Deftones are one of the best bands of their generation. Though it lacks the innovation of their '90s run, Diamond Eyes brings forth something fans hadn’t seen before: a refined, matured version of the band out of chrysalis, confident in their artistry, their relationships, and the future. — Jasmine\n\n51. Vein\n\n‌‌Errorzone\n\n‌‌[Closed Casket Activities; 2018]\n\nWitness for yourself the album that drove thousands to realize Anthony Fantano has no idea what’s going on in nu-metal. The 6/10 that echoed around the world - or at least its various rock and metal forums - against starry-eyed riff addicts that contradicted his review. Errorzone is the fucking truth and my flag is not solitary. Vein offers a meticulous and resounding production: the sound of maglev trains colliding at full force, imbued with emotional hatred, distilled to waveform. From “Broken Glass Complexion” to “Doomtech” and “Quitting Infinity,” it’s consistent songwriting that brings forth a canvas well-versed with Glassjaw, Slipknot and Orgy. “Virus://Vibrance” is a completely batshit way to launch: breakbeat cuts and 7-string dive bombs into a horrorcore adjacent shrill. Errorzone knocks with the weight of a thousand stars, armed with the chunkiest snare I’ve heard in years, dangerous math riffs, and flowers to regrow after the bombs go off. —Balloonfm\n\n50. Taproot\n\n‌‌Gift‌‌\n\n[Atlantic; 2000]\n\nUpon formation in 1997 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Taproot quickly brought in fans with their electric live performances. After gaining an Atlantic record deal with the help of fellow nu-contender System of a Down, the band released their first album Gift. The record was recorded in only six weeks, as most of the songs had been written years prior. Stephen Richards’ unique groaning vocal style is on full display and utilized in a variety of styles, including raps, screams, and gravelly growls, along with traditional melodic singing. Mike DeWolf and Phil Lipscomb string together a collection of heavy-knit riffs, while Jarrod Montague focuses much of his attention on the snare drum. Struggles with mental health and the woes of life while working to overcome these challenges and growing as a person inspire much of the lyrics, awarding the album a chilling, yet deeply personal atmosphere. The band scored places on the Mainstream Rock chart and the U.K. Singles Chart with “Again & Again,” a track with a captivating hook and a chorus that is hard to forget. “1 Nite Stand” brandishes the initial heaviness that the band shied away from in subsequent releases. The early development of many of the tracks and the band’s distinct style, as well as a tracklist full of heavy hitters, grant Taproot a stellar debut with Gift. — Paris Murrow\n\n49. One Minute Silence\n\nAvailable In All Colors\n\n[V2; 1998]\n\nThe most famous one minute silence of the 1990s was in London following Princess Diana’s funeral. The most appropriate One Minute Silence of the 1990s was a Welsh nu-metal band. In an era of impossible sincerity, obnoxious political posturing, and hastily re-written Elton John tribute songs selling 33 million copies around the world One Minute Silence’s debut album, Available in All Colors, wanted you to know that the whole spectacle was “sponsored by Budweiser.” While their comrades in political rap-metal wore stone-faced scowls, One Minute Silence bounded forth with a post-Faith No More splat of wacked and wild nu-metal unhinged enough to lend a whole three songs to combat racing video game Twisted Metal 4. Brian 'Yap' Barry raps like Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys explaining the plot of The Davinci Code to you in an elevator. When he really gets going, such as on “Stuck Between A Rock And A White Face,” you can practically see the cork boards and pinned newspaper he’s gesticulating at. — H.K.\n\n48. Project 86\n\nDrawing Black Lines\n\n[Atlantic; 2000]\n\nPart of the Blindside/P.O.D. cohort that briefly had record execs convinced Christian-HxC could be the next big thing, Project 86 arrived at the only moment when a godfearing rap-metal band could land a budget big enough to hire producer Howard Benson to craft guitar tones so epic it makes accepting Jesus into your heart sound like an act of sheer bravery rather than a prerequisite for the presidency. Drawing Black Lines concerns itself with the internal struggle that comes from attempting to live piously and failing, with a 10,000-megawatt production job as testament. Songs like “Steins Theme” and “One Armed Man (Play On)” impress with cannons of sound while frontman Andrew Schwab’s clenched fist conviction is so palpable you might wonder if it’s not too late to get baptized. — H.K.\n\n47. Blindspott\n\nBlindspott\n\n[EMI; 2003]\n\nReleased on July 13th, 2003 in New Zealand, Blindspott’s self-titled debut album went platinum in a week on an island of only 4 million people. To a young Kiwi, this was the CD you were ditching 8th period to go get and Blindspott rewarded your efforts in kind. Blindspott is a firmly post-Hybrid Theory nu-metal effort, not just in composition but in the idea that a good rock record needs to hit from front to back. If any one thing sets Blindspott apart from the million other scream/sing/scratch bands front-loading their albums like there was no tomorrow it’s that here you’re never far from a ringer. Even if ballads like “Blank” or “Plastic Shadow” lose you there’s a “S.U.I.T (So Us Is This)” or “Lit Up” on deck to jolt you back to attention. That the whole record is twined up with a cohesive atmosphere and instantly hooky melodies is just icing on the pavlova. — H.K.\n\n46. Nothingface\n\nViolence\n\n[TVT; 2000]\n\nD.C. darlings Nothingface returned three years after their sophomore triumph An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity with another success: Violence. The band themselves described the record as \"the soundtrack for the end of the world,\" a sentiment reflected in the hatefulness ingrained into every track. As with their previous releases, vocalist Matt Holt delivers grunts and growls on top of his trademark grunge singing style with scratchy, pummeling instrumentals to match. The band’s stellar songwriting abilities persist; sinister, vivid lyrics are expertly crafted for the listener’s immersion. Up to this point, the band’s work had frequently been compared to other bands. Pacifier was criticized as resembling Korn’s style too closely, while An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity was pitted against bands like Pantera. Violence marked the band’s emergence into a distinct, dark-sided sound, considered by some to be a bit of the best nu-metal the genre has to offer. Despite a disapointing commercial performance, critics hailed the album’s original sound and unflinching vitality, scoring a spot on CMJ’s \"Best Loud Rock Albums\" of 2000 and receiving four out of five stars from Kerrang. Violence is a prime example of a band growing and playing upon their strengths over time. Combining the elements that worked in their earlier releases with genre and identity developments leads to a high quality release—one of the best in their discography. — Paris Murrow\n\n45. Korn\n\nFollow the Leader\n\n[Maverick; 1998]\n\nFollow the Leader is as innovative as “Got the Life” and as regressive as “Kameltosis,” as epic as “Freak on a Leash” and as putrid as “All in the Family,” as necessary as “It’s On!” and as extraneous as “Earache My Eye.” It needs to be all of these things at once to fully communicate the tidal wave of Coors Light and inspiration Korn was riding into 1998. It is, in short, Peak Korn. To promote Follow the Leader Korn embarked on the Korn Kampaign: an expedition around the country, a long trek to radio stations and meet and greets, culminating with a march on Toronto in a literal tank. The message was clear; rock has entered its post-sellout era and Korn sells. A contemporary interview with Spin Magazine finds the band debating whether or not to cut the 'Biohazard breakdown'from “Freak on a Leash” for radio. Korn unanimously votes in favor. “I want a bigger house!\" chants Fieldy. He got one. Follow the Leader sold over 6 million copies in the United States alone. While those numbers are easy to accept nearly two and a half decades after the fact, Follow the Leader is still one of the weirdest multi-platinum albums ever made, rarely indulging in anything resembling a conventional melody or hook. In sound and form, with a daunting hour runtime, Follow the Leader sprawls like the suburbs American teenagers wandered with it spinning in their Discmans and car stereos. Like many peak-CD blockbusters Follow the Leader would be a better record with some edits but, then again, it would lose that peak-CD time and place magic if were any shorter. It needs to be too much, too long, too everything because that’s the point. “We did more partying than we did recording,” reflects Munky in the band’s 2002 home video Deuce, sounding momentarily remorseful before concluding, “But that’s okay because not our money.” — H.K.\n\n44. Static-X\n\nMachine\n\n[Warner Bros.; 2001]\n\nAfter a year on the road supporting breakout debut Wisconsin Death Trip Wayne Static had come to a conclusion; “I hate this!” That exclamation, from Machine’s “This is Not” is the centerpiece of an album about absolutely torching your way through hell at maximum speed. Machine sounds like highway signs and white lines whizzing by day after day after day. New parking lot, new venue, new city, new state. Same VHS tapes and same bunk waiting for you at the end of the night. Hell, “...In a Bag” is literally about how you can’t even shit on the bus. So when Wayne Static observes with horror “This is not my home / this is not my life / this is not me” what is there to do? While Machine doesn’t innovate on the 4/4-lunk-industrial of Wisconsin Death Trip, it brings its strengths into greater focus while shearing away what didn’t. The gross sex jams have been excised in favor of a song cycle about feeling like a cog inside a larger cog inside a machine that powers an even bigger machine. Static-X’s music is so simple it helps that Wayne has specific targets of ire to obliterate here. Problems are objectives to overcome with brute force (“Structural Defect”), de-evolution (“Machine”), or unfeeling aggression (\"Cold\"). The music, meanwhile, pummels forth with unceasing force and fury but occasionally breaks into something truly surprising. When “Otsego Undead” concludes with twinkling spirals of synth arpeggio it’s a moment of quiet wonder that sparkles in the air like mid-day snow. Then the song ends and it’s back on the bus. — H.K.\n\n43. Pleymo\n\nKeçkispasse?\n\n[Wet Music; 1999]\n\nNu-metal is as thoroughly American as genres get, only a country as twisted and ugly as ours could dominate a genre that does the same, but though we produced the majority of nu-metal classics, we also were the first to get burned out on it. By 1999, it was easy to feel like nu-metal was unraveling into a pile of cliches— pointlessly angsty music made by millionaires. If you lived overseas, however, nu-metal was still the cool foreign import. Long after it became a stateside joke nu-metal bands were logging hits and selling out tours abroad. On debut Keçkispasse? French sextet Pleymo sounds ecstatic at the prospect of making straight-up-and-down-no-denying-it nu-metal music. From the happy hardcore explosion “Yallah” to the charmingly boom-bap “Soukaripa” you get a sense of community from Keçkispasse? - of friends certain that with enough effort, aplomb, and zeal they can make this happen. Every bounce riff (and there are so many bounce riffs), scream, screech, and breakdown sound joyous. Angsty millionaires? In 1999 the best nu-metal on earth was being made by broke Frenchmen. — H.K.\n\n42. The Union Underground\n\nAn Education In Rebellion\n\n[Columbia; 2000]\n\n\"I'll bet my bottom dollar this band will be around 10 years from now,\" crowed Columbia Records A&R John David Kalodner to Hits Magazine in September 2000, \"Which is more than I can say for you guys.\" While not exactly a 'Led Zeppelin' level music prediction blunder, neither the band in question nor the record label they were signed to would even make it to the halfway mark (Hits Magazine, meanwhile, still going strong) But bet his bottom dollar, John David did. The Union Underground and their debut album An Education in Rebellion, were amongst the most extravagantly financed nu-metal debuts in an era full of them. Like Columbia label mates Stereomud; The Union Underground were thrust into an immediate “go big or go home” situation and assured they weren’t about to go home. Thus, Rebellion is flush with unearned rockstar confidence, the kind that grated at the time but now feels pleasurably inhabitable. Arriving at the dawn of the decade after grunge exploded, much of An Education in Rebellion delights in dancing upon its grave. The opening lyric (“Load up on your friends, man”) manages to misquote the first two lines to “Smells Like Teen Spirit” at once while making less sense than either. Dime store Alice in Chains harmonies and cliches about needles and damage done abound but unlike the era’s other shameless Kurt Kapitalists like Seether and Puddle of Mudd every track is upbeat, punchy, to the point with great choruses and sticky hooks. The only track that even threatens to become a ballad (“Revolution Man”) kicks into gear right at the first verse. Unfortunate Moody Blues reference aside, single “Turn Me On Mr Deadman” is a Rob Zombie-lite stick of dynamite, blasting through three choruses and a breakdown without flinching. An Education in Rebellion never wallows, rarely whines, is even optimistic at times (“Bitterman” is specifically about not being a bitter man). Hell, opening track “Drivel” boogies, a feature that few - if any - other nu-metal songs can claim to possess. As The Union Underground’s only album to date, An Education in Rebellion demarks a time when nu-glam-grunge could have almost been a thing had it not drowned in those boomtown years when every label was trying to launch their own nu-metal act. — H.K.\n\n41. Seo Taiji\n\nUltramania\n\n[Bando; 2000]\n\nAn impossibly young man sprints through an airport as hundreds of fans pursue him. Girls are reduced to tears as he takes the stage at a massive arena. Pyrotechnics explode. The crowd shrieks as he launches into… nu-metal. It’s 2000 and Seo Taiji is South Korea’s biggest pop star. Following the end of pioneering K-pop idol group Seo Taiji and Boys, Seo Taiji (the titular “boy”) immersed himself in guitar music. Following an adept alternative rock debut he created Ultramania, an album of straight-up balls-to-the-walls nu-metal. This pivot has almost no parallel in popular music. Imagine Jordan Knight departing the New Kids on the Block to make funk metal and somehow pulling it off. Tracks like “Orange” and “Ultramania” are all mild youth rebellion anthems but jacked up on a nu-metal explosion that sounds like the Ross Robinson/Max Martin team-up of your dreams (or nightmares). The album’s two “02 Remake” tracks are the clearest examples of how K-pop became K-metal. “Come Back Home” trades the original’s dusty hip-hop beats for a true Korn makeover replete with guitar squeals and clattering bass while “For You” is transformed from a drippy love ballad into an uptempo nu-pop-punk sprint. And for helpful time-and-place illustration, Ultramania comes with two live tracks that feature an audience of young girls screaming with an intensity more akin to The Beatles at Shea Stadium than any of the hulked-out grunting you’d hear on an average night of the Family Values Tour. — H.K.\n\n40. Carajo\n\nCarajo\n\n[Universal; 2002]\n\nCarajo is alive with a passion for rebellion. Each of its 12 tracks is a fist of triumph punched high in the air. Opener “Resistiendo con ideas” goes “Shouted love in the form of a song! ​​Invent our place and express ourselves!” Another line, from the anthemic “Sacate la Mierda”: “The economy stole our lives [...] And how hard it is to keep hope when food is not enough!” A rare nu-metal power trio; Marcelo 'Corvata' Corvalán sings with the intensity of a militia member passing out rifles on the front lines while punctuating tracks with his joyful shouts and whoops. Guitarist Hernán \"Tery\" Langer puts on a masterclass of nu-metal riffage (peep “Conquistador”) and drummer Andrés \"Andy\" Vilanova keeps things bouncy. The result is righteously heavy. In its final seconds “Sacate la Mierda” deploys a brutal downward key-change because, goddammit, A# was just not going hard enough. — H.K.\n\n39. My Ticket Home\n\nStrangers Only\n\n[Rise; 2013]\n\nMy Ticket Home often gives the impression that there are more than four musicians in the group. The more conventional metalcore styles of debut To Create a Cure were formidable but conventional. Strangers Only needs no such excuse. It is a sickeningly powerful eclipse of sanity by songwriters at their most passionate, way ahead of anyone else doing even an ironic reevaluation of nu-metal in 2013. Lead vocalist Nick Giumenti was made for howling over a wildfire of shrill instrumentation while backing vocalist Derek Blevins' more conventional cleans punctuate songs like “Keep Alone” with sturdy hooks. The album concludes just as bloodthirsty as it starts, with “Kick Rocks” - “Scream until it’s all gone, Bullshit poser, who are you?” inquires the anamorphic voice of distorted hatred. Strangers Only offers a serene catharsis rarely matched by its peers. — Balloonfm and H.K.\n\n38. Soulfly\n\nSoulfly\n\n[Roadrunner; 1998]\n\nAfter a decade with groove metal legends Sepultura singer Max Cavalera was suddenly unemployed, quitting his own band over managerial disputes. His debut album as Soulfly functions as both a finger to his old bandmates and a look to the future- a future as bright and open as the album cover. Across 70 unwieldy minutes, Cavalera succeeds at his stated goal to “find a better way,” coupling his distinctive tribal styling with a triumphant freedom displacing Sepultura’s intense lumber. Much of Soulfly chatters with jungle ambiance and distant drums but where on Roots they menaced, here they invite. Soulfly could have been a bitter slog, instead, it overflows with gratitude for Max’s buddies in Limp Bizkit, Deftones, and Fear Factory pitching in, and for the opportunity at a fresh start. — H.K.\n\n37. Sw1tched\n\nSubject to Change\n\n[Immortal; 2002]\n\nFor all their anti-pop posturing Slipknot had some incredible pop instincts. The sturm-und-drang of “Wait and Bleed,” “My Plague,” and “Left Behind” may have packed the mosh pit, but their million-dollar choruses are what sold plastic. Cleveland Ohio’s Sw1tched must have noticed this when plotting their debut Subject to Change. Re-imagining Iowa as produced by Mutt Lange, Sw1tched excised the 7+ minute excursions and freaky-deeky SFX to make room for fat hooks and bone-rattling bounce riffs. Slipknot had three drummers? Sw1tched get it done with one, and when they compliment him with a single conga on “Spread” it’ll break your neck. — H.K.\n\n36. Cold\n\n13 Ways to Bleed On Stage\n\n[Flip Records; 2000]\n\n'Leave me alone' is one of nu-metal’s all-time touchstones. The desire or demand to be rid of someone’s presence is a sentiment that has powered entire careers. But if other nu-metal bands just wanted to be left alone, then Cold made music for people who got their wish and were surprised nobody came back to get them. Scooter Ward, one of the few post-grunge frontmen to find an interesting approach to the yarl, sings like a man with his head in his lap, hoping in equal measure that nobody bothers him and someone asks what’s wrong. Songs like “End of the World'' and “Sick of Man'' owe as much to Massive Attack as they do Ministry while “Just Got Wicked” and “Send In the Clowns'' remind that this band can rage as hard as they mope. — H.K.\n\n35. Dry Kill Logic\n\nThe Darker Side of Nonsense\n\n[Roadrunner; 2001]\n\nFollowing the smash success of Slipknot’s debut (and, to a regrettably greater extent, Nickelback’s) Roadrunner Records, flush with cash and influence, snapped up some truly excellent nu-metal bands, one of whom, Dry Kill Logic, found a fresh spin on the drop-tuned metal attack that was big at the time by twining it with a little wink. From the opening track “Nightmare” carving its chorus into a tree for you (“Me + You = Nightmare, I say”) to the prototypical weepy acoustic finale “Goodnight” resolving immediately to “Seb,” sole lyric: \"Seb get the fuck up, the fuck out.\" That sense of humor is what keeps an album of such divorced guy energies (“I can see he’s a better man than me / What you want what you need”) from ever getting too bogged down. Helped along by a massive drum mix that showcases thick tom tom drums and a battering kick, The Darker Side of Nonsense goes harder and heavier than the vast number of bands in its very crowded lane. Sure, other nu-metal albums had their songs about the pain, the anger, the hurt, the hating but did any of them have the genius to interpolate a Spice Girls song while doing it? — H.K.\n\n34. MaNga\n\nMaNga\n\n[Sony Music; 2004]\n\nAmerica owned nu-metal. In fact, we owned nu-metal to such a degree that we robbed ourselves of albums like MaNga whose every second boasts the fact that it’s created by a Turkish band. Replete with arabesque strings and lush Persian scales, MaNga takes the rapping/singing/turntables formula and drops it into an Ankara recording studio. A nu-metal band well outside the American music scene that nonetheless commands hundreds of millions of views on YouTube, MaNga is an excellent hybrid of styles that never shows the seams holding them together. As racing strings, turntables, tremolo guitars, and rap cadences rush together in perfect harmony on “Bir Kadın Çizeceksin” you might forget about Bakersfield, California entirely. — H.K.\n\n33. Missile Girl Scoot\n\nWanderland\n\n[Toshiba EMI Ltd; 2001]\n\nGo far enough down the nu-metal iceberg and you eventually start finding bands so obscure that they're not even on websites with twenty download buttons and enough sketchy coding that your own browser has to ask if you’re sure about this. Take Missile Girl Scoot. Unless you own a Japanese Spotify subscription you don’t know and can’t know about them. Forget Spotify, most of their music isn’t even on YouTube. They're simply not around. Far from the usual kind of avant garde that makes a band obscure, Missile Girl Scoot created nu-power-pop rapcore so bright and bubbly it demands to be shared. Wanderland, their magnum opus, dips and dives between fuzzed out nu-garage on “Get Back,” the playful taunting of “Don’t Rely On Me,” anime end credits balladry on “Everytime It Rains,” and a haunted, minimalist wander on “Thick Forest.” It shouldn’t work all on one album but it does, enough so that you’d swear this is a greatest hits. Rapper U-Ri has a Salt-N-Pepa-esque playfulness to her flow, while singer Junn’s high-keening melodies possess an ineffable cotton candy sweetness. Wanderland is never anything less than delightful and you won’t rest till it has delighted everyone you know. — H.K.\n\n32. Limp Bizkit\n\nThree Dollar Bill, Y’all\n\n[Flip Records; 1997]\n\nBefore they’d become the poster boys for record label excess Limp Bizkit were lean, mean, and hungry as hell. Fred Durst, a hustler to the bone, had his band performing in parking lots, paying radio stations to play \"Counterfeit\" (with a disclaimer of course, no payola here), and recording an irresistibly disrespectful cover of 80s pop classic “Faith” that would, naturally, become their breakout hit. While never some Rakim-level MC, Durst remains an underrated rapper whose enthusiasm and love of the game take him places the conventionally skilled would never go. The flows and layered cadences of “Stuck” won’t be leaving your brain anytime soon while he attacks opener “Pollution” with ravenously infectious energy. Meanwhile, guitarist Wes Borland has a ball finding clever ways of deconstructing the fretboard of a 7-string guitar. The big bounce riff in “Counterfeit” is little more than a-tonal clunks and some touch harmonics while skilled flowing taps lace “Sour” and “Stalemate” with dense thickets of clean melody. Together Durst and Borland strike a perfect yin-yang balance — if said yin-yang is tattooed on a drunk Florida Man’s left bicep. When it was time to hit the road in support of Three Dollar Bill, Y’all, the prospect of schlepping from one half-empty club to another wasn’t very appealing to Freddy D. Instead he launched Ladies Night In Cambodia. Why is it “Ladies Night?” Chicks get in for free. The tour was a smash, “Faith” made it to MTV, and soon Three Dollar Bill Y’all would be platinum. Clever guy, that Fred Durst. — H.K.\n\n31. 40 Below Summer\n\nInvitation to the Dance\n\n[London-Sire Records Inc; 2001]\n\nAfter a half-decade of straight jackets, face paint, masks, and murder fantasies the market was starting to turn on nu-metal’s wild side. Linkin Park and Papa Roach were both going multi-platinum singing about ordinary pressures and pain wearing outfits that could have come from any mall in America while Korn and Slipknot were forced to adapt or die. By this token 40 Below Summer were practically a throwback, singer Max Illidge's sputters and howls would have been at home anywhere in ‘95, but the songwriting was unmistakably of its time. Along with bands like Disturbed and Drowning Pool; 40 Below Summer were wedding pre-millennium nu-metal antics with modern rock radio-ready production but 40 Below’s careful craft set them apart. Their debut album, Invitation to the Dance, is all clever songwriting as tense middle-eights resolve to huge choruses, breakdowns veer into thrash, coming together into tracks like “Falling Down,” melding disparate elements into a side-breaking anthem. Less reliant on big bounce riffs, songs like “Rope” and “Electric Smile” have layered choruses that give way to wild fits of shrieking. The tension between chaos and control is cultivated, over and over, until the titanic swoon of “Drown” brings it all to a head. “Stop this life” Illige mutters, “I cannot stop this life” sounding for all the world like a man unsure what’s going to take him out first; his band or himself. — H.K.\n\n30. Incubus\n\nS.C.I.E.N.C.E.\n\n[Universal; 1997]\n\nBrandon Boyd had all the answers. Witness, dreadlocked and blissed out somewhere in Europe, excited enough about his life that he has the nerve to imply his band’s combinations of turntables and guitars were confusing the masses. Several years after 311 first hired a full-time DJ and a year after Fred Durst poached DJ Lethal for Limp Bizkit, Boyd muses “We’re a little more difficult to understand at first.” If Incubus were ahead of anything it was selling nu-metal up the river. Just three short years after S.C.I.E.N.C.E. guitarist Mike Einziger would crow to Spin Magazine, \"We just really turned our backs on it completely [...] [rap-metal] is a very horrible place to be. We don't want to be part of anyone's little bullshit scene.\" The shame of this was how effortlessly Incubus made this little bullshit scene their own. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is a funky swirl of half-remembered Adult Swim cartoons, decayed educational film reels, and bonfire jam sessions assembled by those guys in high school who swore they did better on tests while high and actually did. You can practically see the band oohing and aahing at each other as Brandon Boyd explains the central metaphor of “A Certain Shade of Green” or giggling for hours looping “Magic Medicine”s samples. It should grate but it comes together with tight, dedicated musicianship and the undeniable wonder of inspiration. Incubus' S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is the shock of throwing everything at the wall and watching it all stick. — H.K.\n\n29. 36 Crazyfists\n\nBitterness the Star\n\n[Roadrunner; 2002]\n\nPost-hardcore’s relationship to nu-metal can be described as, at best strained, and at worst quite hostile. The two genres shared elbow room in the late 90s and, during the early 00s, started jockeying for position as record labels wondering which would be the new outlet of choice for angered teens signed bands like At the Drive In, Thursday, Blindside, and Alexisonfire. Refer to any of those as nu-metal and expect to get flamed by aging LiveJournal survivors but stand firm for Anchorage, Alaska’s own 36 Crazyfists. Clearly post-hardcore in many respects (lots of screamy yelling with emo breakdowns) but even more nu-metal in others (low, stringy bass sound; drop-tuned guitars; bounce riffs) their debut album Bitterness the Star is so packed with consistently excellent emoting it plays more like a greatest hits than a proper album. Maybe if Ross Robinson had discovered 36 Crazyfists instead of Glassjaw he would have signed them to save “Adidas rock” instead of kill it. — H.K.\n\n28. System of a Down\n\nSystem of a Down\n\n[American Recordings; 1998]\n\nLike mischievous imps dancing around our popular culture, System of a Down ingested the sociopolitical landscape and returned it as an absurdist tragicomedy. When “Sugar” breaks down into a jazzy snap or Serj Tankian shoots his voice into a mocking falsetto on “DDevil” (“Stupid people do stupid things smart people outsmart them / Then themselves! Then themselves!”) It feels like being laughed at by someone and laughing with them at the same time. “War?” describes a world where mass murder is ordained by God first, building to a haunting refrain “We don’t speak anymore of war” that circles like klaxons sounding in the dark. When System does come down to earth with us on “Spiders'' it is to mourn, hushed and reverent, with a lonesome cry: “Before you know I will be waiting, all awake.” — H.K.\n\n27. Sevendust\n\nHome\n\n[TVT Records; 1999]\n\nA strange thing happened during Sevendust’s star-making set at the infamous Woodstock 99 – a rainbow. Witnessing this awe-inspiring display of natural phenomena, the band’s singer, Lajon Witherspoon, asks the massive sweaty brawling moshing crowd to look at the rainbow. Actually, he demands it. “Look at that fuckin’ rainbow y’all!” Witherspoon whoops with childlike glee, “Everyone look at the rainbow!!” It was a perfect moment – and maybe the greatest pit call of all time – for a band who crafted battle cries for the bench press on record and displayed a hard-won easygoing generosity in person. Their peak, 1999’s Home, followed that triumphant Woodstock set with the same confidence a heavy metal band needs to demand a legendarily violent crowd bear witness to a rainbow. With a voice like the singer formerly known as Terence Trent D’Arby on Ozzfest, Witherspoon sings with a radiant passion buttressed by backing vocalist Clint Lowrey’s post-grunge conviction and drummer Morgan Rose’s adrenaline-spiked outbursts. It’s an incredibly underrated and effective triple vocal attack. When they bounce off each other on airtight bangers like “Reconnect” and “Waffle” you can hear the brotherhood in their voices. So open were their hearts that when Skunk Anansie’s Skin and Deftones’ Chino Moreno make guest appearances, Sevendust is happy to cede the spotlight to them and gets two of their best ever songs in return. — H.K.\n\n26. Papa Roach\n\nInfest\n\n[Dreamworks; 2000]\n\nThe first lyric of the first verse on Papa Roach’s major label debut Infest is “My name’s Coby Dick! Mr. Dick if you’re nasty!” A bizarre moment on multiple fronts— first, Coby Dick is not lead singer Jacoby Shaddix’s name and second Infest is not an album that asks you to be nasty. It asks if you’re traumatized, reassures you you’re not alone, and begs you to hold tight till the next chorus. Bolstered by an undeniable lead single and a friendly MTV, Papa Roach were a nu-metal breakout right as that phenomenon was becoming scarce. The plainspoken messages of songs like “Last Resort” and “Broken Home” are about finding the shortest path to catharsis and taking it. Shaddix’s rap delivery is never less than right up in your face, begging you to get your shit together and live to see another day. An unstoppable side-A secedes to a near conceptual side-B, wracked with the nervy paranoia of their hometown Vacaville’s empty lots and baked pavements. Songs like “Revenge” and “Snakes” are stories of youthful recklessness wreaking real consequences while “Thrown Away” and “Binge” are the downward spiral reaching bottom. But before the album can end disparagingly, Papa Roach pull themselves to their feet with hopeful reggae closer “Tightrope.” And sure, its 'Ras Trent with a wallet chain' skank is an overreach but they reach for it anyway, with an open heart and passionate eyes ready to help you scream your way to safety again. — H.K.\n\n25. Spineshank\n\nThe Height of Callousness\n\n[Roadrunner; 2000]\n\nIf adolescence is about drilling big gobs of gnarled hormonal muck from your chest and throwing them at whoever is around, then discovering Spineshank’s The Height of Callousness during that tender era is like someone handing you an industrial strength boring machine. Imagine a remake of the Keanu Reeves runaway bus thriller Speed but it’s Nine Inch Nails at Woodstock ‘94 and if the crowd stops moshing the stage explodes. Johnny Santos screams, pants, fumes, and howls like he’s speedrunning puberty. His opening roar, “COME AHHHHHHN!” sounds both like in"
