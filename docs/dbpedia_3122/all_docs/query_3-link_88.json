        "text": "Jay Gerard Bradley (born August 6, 1999), known professionally as Almighty Jay (formerly YBN Almighty Jay), is an American rapper. He was part of the YBN collective before their disbandment in August 2020. He is best known for singles such as \"Chopsticks\", \"Bread Winners\", and \"No Hook\".\n\nWhy He and His Songs Aren't Almighty\n\nHis voice is very uninteresting and bored, and sounds worse when he uses AutoTune.\n\nHis flow is very simple, and has nothing unique or memorable about it; in addition, as has often been pointed out, it is a borderline copy of Rich The Kid's flow, right down to the way he enunciates certain words.\n\nHis lyrics are the weakest part of his music. They're very generic and revolve all around cars, clothes, houses, jewelry, girls and being rich, and are also accompanied by awful bars like \"My brother shoot the chopper like he stupid\" in \"Red Light\".\n\nA lot of his beats are generic and boring to listen to.\n\nSimilarly, his music videos are rather boring and unoriginal as most of them are just him flexing and throwing money around.\n\nHe was with no doubt, the worst YBN member, since both YBN Nahmir and YBN Cordae sound enjoyable most of the time.\n\nHe and Blac Youngsta have bad chemistry.\n\nHe claimed that he was never signed to Rich the Kid's label when obviously he was as his production and and flow are very similar to Rich's. He even said \"Rich Forever shit\" in his 2018 XXL Freshman Class pitch.\n\nSpeaking of XXL, His 2018 and 2019 XXL Freshman Class pitches were trash.\n\nIn his 2018 pitch, he stated he should've made it because when he blew up everyone wanted to be \"his friend\".\n\nIn his 2019 pitch, he stated that his music is \"fire\" and others are \"trash\". Which is a very laughable reason why he thought he should've made it.\n\nHe along with YBN Nahmir, Plies, Ja Rule, 6ix9ine, Slim Jesus, Rich White Man, Soulja Boy and JayDaYoungan are fake gangsters as every time Jay acts tough, stuff never goes right for him.\n\nIn March 2019, Bradley was attacked in New York City, where his money and chains were taken. He was also stomped on and stabbed several times. He reportedly received over 300 stitches after the incident.[1]\n\nHe beefed with another bad rapper, who later exposed him.[2]\n\nHe got called out by Chief Keef for dissing the dead Gangster Disciple affiliate, Tooka.[3]\n\nHe threw a big party in 2020, despite COVID-19 being a serious danger at the time.[4]\n\nThe Only Almighty Quality\n\nHis YBN mixtape with Nahmir and Cordae isn't that bad.\n\nAlso he has some good songs like \"No Hook\" with YBN Nahmir.\n\nDiscography\n\nMixtapes\n\nYBN: The Mixtape (with YBN Nahmir and Cordae) (2018)\n\nBattling My Spirit (2021)\n\nEPs\n\nAlmighty: The EP (2021)"
