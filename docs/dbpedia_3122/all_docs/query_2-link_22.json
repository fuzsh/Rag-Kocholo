The company has yet to release its Q3 subs figures.\n\n“NetEase Cloud Music has established itself as a trusted partner for well-known Japanese copyright holders.”\n\nNetEase Cloud Music\n\n“As one of China’s leading online music platforms, NetEase Cloud Music has long been a preferred online destination for music enthusiasts, especially among the younger generation. NetEase Cloud Music has established itself as a trusted partner for well-known Japanese copyright holders,” the company said.\n\n“NetEase Cloud Music’s unique music community appeal, highly interactive user base and impressive user stickiness underscore the platform’s capabilities in efficiently promoting music content distribution while extending audience outreach with meaningful interactions,” it added.\n\nThe partnership with Japan’s Pony Canyon follows Cloud Music’s music copyright cooperations with record labels across Asia including Modern Sky, Emperor Entertainment Group, China Record Group, Feng Hua Qiu Shi, Yuehua Entertainment, Linfair Records, SM Entertainment, TF Entertainment, YG Entertainment, KAO!INC and Avex.\n\nFor Pony Canyon, the partnership with Cloud Music marks its latest effort in expanding its distribution network. The company recently announced on December 9 that it launched a new label called Pandrec, specializing in creator marketing and in supporting artists within the company’s digital distribution service."
