        "text": "YBN Almighty Jay has been on a crusade against ART@WAR label head James McMillan. According to the 21-year-old rhymer, McMillan played a role in him agreeing to sign what he now perceives to be an unfavorable record contract.\n\n“This n#### James McMillan is a fraud. He [signs] n##### to janky deals and f### em over,” posted Almighty Jay on Instagram six days ago. He continued to publicly express his frustration with some of the behind-the-scenes forces.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jay took his complaints to his Twitter account. The Battling My Spirit creator tweeted, “Didn’t have a choice when I signed… N#### signed my rights away to Atlantic Records behind my back.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ybnalmightyjay/status/1369328113805574147?s=20\n\nAlmighty Jay was not the only former member of the YBN collective that appeared to air their grievances with James McMillan. 23-year-old Maryland emcee Cordae (formerly known as YBN Cordae) recently co-signed Jay’s issues with the entertainment lawyer/record executive.\n\nIn February, YBN Nahmir griped about unnamed “old n##### in the background” who supposedly contributed to the YBN crew being torn apart. The 21-year-old Alabama rapper also talked about the then-teenagers allegedly being taken advantage of and manipulated by older businesspeople when they first broke into the industry."
