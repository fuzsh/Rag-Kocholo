A music video for \"Ready For a Miracle\" by American country pop recording artist, LeAnn Rimes, was released as a promotion for the soundtrack.\n\nRascal Flatts' version of \"Revolution\" peaked at number fifty-seven on the Hot Country Songs charts,[4] and \"The Power of One\" by Bomshel reached number fifty-two on the same.[5]\n\nTrack listing[]\n\nNote: Tracks one, two and fourteen to sixteen are taken from the film while tracks three through thirteen are inspired by the film.[6]\n\nReference[]"
