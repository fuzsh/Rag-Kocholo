        "text": "Don’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 257\n\nFri. Nov 14, 2013\n\n“Cygnet Committee”\n\nDavid Bowie\n\n1969\n\n“♫ I\n\nwant to\n\nLive ♫”\n\nOne of the most underrated songs on his 1969 debut album David Bowie, also know as Space Oddity, this treasure is definitely the most Zimmerman-esque cut Bowie had penned to date, even before his obvious ode on Hunky Dory’s “Song for Bob Dylan.” Peter Doggett said it best in his book The Man Who Sold The World: David Bowie & The 1970’s, when he wrote, “Like Bob Dylan, who was fighting off attempts [for the hippy movement] to co-opt him as the figurehead of the counter-culture revolution, Bowie wanted nothing more than to be allowed to live.” Although David Bowie’s 1969 debut is known for the Thin White Duke’s creation of Major Tom, this 9 minute acoustic flavored epic is best known for David’s indictment of the Hippie Generation also finds Bowie struggling to balance his personal independence and the need for critical success and commercial stardom.\n\nSpeaking of David and Bob, in Sean Egan’s edited The Mammoth Book of Bob Dylan, documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker talked about the similarities between Bowie and Dylan when he said, “I think they’re quite alike. Like Dylan, Bowie lives in the part of his brain that you and I don’t know anything about. Both of them have this place in their head they cab go into and kind of disappear. I’ve seen them both do it, disappear on me, right in the middle of a sentence.” “Cygnet Committee” is the sound of Bowie beginning to slip inside this shell. Although he has yet to voyage into outer space, you can feel the genesis of what makes Bowie want to crawl inside and mold the seeds of his future alter-ego Ziggy Stardust.\n\nMore than just a Dylan inspired treatise, in his book, Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell: The Dangerous Glitter of David Bowie, Iggy Pop & Lou Reed, Dave Thompson talked about the exquisite wonder of “Cygnet” when he called this Space Oddity, “the most important song [David Bowie] has ever written.” Thompson explained his reasoning’s when he wrote, “Even at literal face value, the song is the most venomous indictment [Bowie] has ever written. It is important because of what it would say, if you play it again a decade or so after it’s original release, and viewed those words through the eyes of plaintive hindsight. There are certainly enough ideas adrift for any other artist to have fashioned an entire concept album around it, but Bowie somehow holds it all together, and does so with such apparent ease that one could believe he penned such behemoths every day.”\n\nAlthough “Committee was released a year before the former the former Beatle created Plastic Ono Band, when John sung “I don’t believe…” could Lennon have penned “God” as a lyrical retort to Bowie’s “Cygnet Committee? Looking back, “Cygnet” sounds like the anti-thesis of John Lennon’s “God.” This was 1969 and unlike Lennon who was tired of the mania surrounding The Beatles, Bowie had yet to reach his age of disillusionment.\n\nSpeaking of cynicism, “Cygnet” acoustic flavored musings actually have closer to ties to a track on Bowie’s next record; although it sounds like a precursor to Hunky Dory’s “The Bewlay Brothers,” in reality, “Committee” has more in common with “Rock & Roll Suicide,” the track that would eventually kill Ziggy Stardust; while in that song Bowie sings, “♫ you’re not alone ♫” to his legion of followers, in this Space Oddity cut, the very weary Bowie wanted to keep his distance by repeating his mantra, “♫ I want to live. ♫” Peter Doggett discussed this dichotomy when he wrote in The Man Who Sold The World, “Even before he had become a star, Bowie had glimpsed the cannibalistic relationship between leader and followers, idol and fans, guru and disciples. Yet he was still drawn toward pursing fame, influence, the trappings of god—a tension that would haunt [him in] the decade ahead.” It’s as if, Bowie had to live the life of a pop star before rejecting the world that made him become the alien that they loved.\n\nDavid once dubbed “Cygnet” the best song on self-titled debut album, in that same 1969 interview with George Tremlett, quoted in Nicholas Pegg’s The Complete David Bowie, where he defended his epic when he said, “They say it’s too long, nine-and-a –half minutes as appose to the usual three…but it’s a song in which I had something I wanted to say. It’s me looking at the hippy movement saying [what] went wrong when the hippies became just like everyone else, materialistic and selfish.” Later, Bowie discussed his intentions of Committee” in Pegg’s The Complete David Bowie, when David explained, “I basically wanted it to be a cry to fucking humanity… [to attack those] who don’t know what to do with themselves? Looking all the time for people to show them the way.”\n\n“Committee” is more than just a call to arms to the hippy generation; it’s a struggle between Bowie’s innocence and his need for commercial and critical notoriety. “Cygnet” is a rare epic because it has a very unique tripped out flow without being overtly psychedelic. It’s a trip inside Bowie’s mind before he went to outer space. You can hear the seeds of Ziggy Stardust within the journey of Bowie’s ambitious epic. It’s obvious that Bowie was still finding himself and “Cygnet Committee” was Bowie’s theme song of David trying to find the balance between his own piece of mind and wrestling with how much he could actually give to his audience before he became the international cult idol and mega pop stardom his ego craved.\n\nWhen asked by Cameron Crowe, in David’s infamous Playboy interview of 1976, whether The Thin White Duke has trouble deciding which is the real you, Bowie responded, “I’ve learned to flow with myself. I honestly don’t know where the real David Jones is. It’s like playing the shell game. Except I’ve got so many shells I’ve forgotten what the pea looks like. I wouldn’t know it if I found it. Being famous helps put off the problems of discovering myself. I mean that. That’s the main reason I’ve always been so keen on being accepted, why I’ve striven so hard to put my brain to artistic use. I want to make a mark.”\n\nBowie definitely made his first artistic mark with “Cygnet” from his 1969 self-titled debut album also known as Space Oddity. While many consider Bowie’s creation of “Major Tom” as the highlight of his debut album, I prefer this underrated masterwork that is “Cygnet Committee.” Rediscover this undiscovered melody that author Dave Thompson called, “the most important song [David Bowie] has ever written.” “Cygnet Committee” is definitely one for the ages and one of the best Bowie songs you probably never heard before. Is “Cygnet” a call to arms, criticizing the counter-culture movement or the 9 minute plus epic that spotlight’s the battles of David’s personal demons before Bowie became international alien sensation that was Ziggy Stardust?’ Turn on, tune in and take a trip inside this classic and discover the lyrical truth within David Bowie’s rarely heard masterstroke of a Space Oddity that is “Cygnet Committee.”\n\nAlthough David rarely played this inner-space oddity cut live on stage, here’s a rare version where Bowie performed “Cygnet Committee” at the BBC:\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 256\n\nThurs. Nov 13, 2013\n\n“In a Station”\n\nThe Band\n\n1967\n\n“♫ Is\n\nthere\n\nsomething\n\nyou could\n\nshow me? ♫”\n\nMany fans and critics point to Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band as being the album that changed rock music but there’s an LP that was released in 1968, The Band’s Music from Big Pink, officially put the steak through the heart of Psychedelia. Richard Manuel, Gareth Hudson, Levon Helm, Rick Danko and Robbie Robertson were an answer to the unauthentic psychedelic “chocolate subway” sounds that were cluttering up the rock scene in the late 1960s. Sending a seismic shockwave of inspiration from Woodstock, New York, The Band’s Big Pink changed the musical landscape bringing a down home sense of pastoral reflective beauty away from the noisy studio trickery nonsense that made Psychedelia so infamous. The voice behind this new genuine country sound was The Band’s vocalist Richard Manuel. He led the lyrical train with the revolutionary beauty that was “In a Station.”\n\nElvis Costello called the Band’s music was “like receiving a letter from the other side of the world, a world you couldn’t possibly understand, let alone visit.” The Band’s Big Pink was so influential that not only did Eric Clapton and George Harrison both visit Manuel, Hudson, Helm, Danko and Robertson in Woodstock, both ‘British rock royalty’ wanted to literally join The Band. Harrison famously called his new favorite mates, “The best band in the history of the universe.”\n\nAfter hearing an early pressing of Big Pink, Eric realized, “This is what music was should sound like.” In Barney Hoskyns book Across The Great Divide: The Band and America, Slowhand talked about how much Big Pink influenced the guitarist on a spiritually influential level when Clapton explained, “I used to put it on as soon as I checked into my hotel room, do the gig and be utterly miserable, then rush back and put the tape on and go to sleep contented until I woke up the next morning and remembered who I was and what I was doing. [Music from Big Pink] was that potent.”\n\nThe Band’s sound was so potent that The Band’s Music from Big Pink became one the driving forces that led to Clapton leaving his very successful trio Cream and he told Bob Carruthers, “At that point in time I decided that I was leaving Cream. I got the tapes of Music from Big Pink and I thought this is what I want to play—not extended solos and maestro bullshit but just good funky songs. The combination of that Rolling Stones thing and hearing Big Pink decided for me that I was going to split Cream.” Big Pink’s influence was so earth-shatteringly inspiring that even guitar virtuoso Jimi Hendrix recorded an acoustic version of The Band’s “Tears of Rage,” finally released in 2010’s West Coast Seattle Boy.\n\nThere was something in The Band’s sound that artists like Clapton never heard before when he said in Carruthers book Eric Clapton Uncensored and on the Record, “I’d never really like country music before because I thought it was over-sentimental. That was when I was into being very aggressive and just playing straight blues. Country music was just sloppy. But the Band bridged the gap. They gave country music a bit it didn’t have before.”\n\nWhile Clapton, Hendrix and a legion of other Brit rock luminaries were busy being influenced by The Band, there was one artist who was the key inspiration for “In A Station,” the quiet Beatle George Harrison. Levon Helm talked about Manuel’s “Station” in his book This Wheel’s on Fire, co-authored with Stephen Davis, when The Band’s drummer wrote, ““In a Station” is Richard’s song about Overlook Mountain and the relative peace we were all feeling after those long years living on the road. He used to laugh and call it his George Harrison song, by which I meant it was visionary and [very] spiritual.” Songs like “In a Station” were the idealized Zen like places that successful rockers like Clapton and Harrison were trying to reach in their own careers. Here they found these young contemporaries, The Band, who has single-handedly discovered the secret of spiritual bliss artists like Eric and George have spent their craft trying to achieve.\n\nIronically enough Manuel didn’t see his song or his craft as that ground breaking, like most artists, he had this doubts about his own talent which he shared in Hoskyns book Across The Great Divide, “I always liked that line “I could taste your hair.” I can write music very easily but when it comes to words I cringe.” Harrison did anything but cringe as some of The Band’s rhythms would find themselves in The Beatles future records as author Simon Lang noted on his book The Music of George Harrison: While My Guitar Gently Weeps, “Numerous elements of Music from Big Pink either showed a Beatles influence or found echoes in The Beatles’ and Harrison’s music: “In a Station” featured distended slide guitar and “Tears of Rage” had the Leslie-toned guitars which immediately appeared on Abbey Road.”\n\nJust like The Velvet Underground & Nico, The Band’sBig Pink and Richard Manuel’s influence inspired legions of would rockers to start their own bands. But even more impressive than V.U.’s genius was that The Band single–handedly changed the sound of music with one single album. So influential that both Eric Clapton and George Harrison wanted to leave their bands, Cream and The Beatles, to become full-time members of The Band. Manuel’s “In a Station” was the leader of that spiritual shift away from the “chocolate subway” sounds of Psychedelia into a more American country rock sound found on Big Pink.\n\nWhat first sounds like the opening strands of mellotron psychedelics turns into a deeper trip when you hear the heavenly voice of Richard Manuel. There’s a sense of soulful enlighten flowing throughout like you’ve opened the window to a new world that you’ve always known existed but never discovered until you opened your ears to the sound of “In a Station.” Manuel is your spiritual guide taking you inside the wondrous landscapes of his tranquil echoes of lyrical perfection. I urge you to take that sacred Big Pink journey through the sounds of “In a Station,” if this is your first journey on this trip, lay back and enjoy the ride—you’re ears will be wide open and your mind will flow within the beautifully illuminating musical and lyrical grandeur of this Richard Manuel penned classic.\n\nclick on link to rediscover the majestic beauty of Richard Manuel & The Band’s “In a Station”:\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 255\n\nWed. Nov 13, 2013\n\n“Land: Horses/Land of a Thousand Dances/La Mer(de)”\n\nPatti Smith\n\n1975;\n\n“♫ And\n\nI felt the\n\narrows of\n\ndesire ♫”\n\nPatti Smith’s early life as a recording artist thrived with her uncompromising nature to live in the moment of inspiration. But the way that Smith told it in her book Just Kids, it was playwright Sam Shepherd who gave her the confidence to follow her creative instincts of inspiration when she wrote:\n\n“When we got to the part where we had to improvise an argument in a poetic language, I got cold feet. “I can’t do this,” I said. “I don’t know what to say.”\n\n“Say anything,” he said. “You can’t make a mistake when you improvise.”\n\n“What if I mess it up? What if I screw up the rhythm?”\n\n“You can’t,” he said. “It’s like drumming. If you miss a beat, you create another.”\n\nIn this simple exchange, Sam taught me the secret of improvisation, one that I have accessed my whole life.”\n\nNo other song captures the magic of Patti Smith living within the moment of her words and lyrics than the centerpiece and opus of her debut album Horses, “Land: Horses/Land of a Thousand Dances/La Mer(de).” Smith described her masterpiece of “Land” as “The dream, life, death, resurrection and soap opera of Johnny in the hallway.” Told through the metaphysical lyrical protagonist called Johnny, “Land” is an poetic elegy to Smith’s rock ‘n’ roll heroes, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison who all died before their time.\n\nIn Philip Shaw’s most excellent 33 1/3 tome, [Editors Note: if you don’t have Shaw’s treatise on Patti Smith’s Horses, go order it from Amazon or run to your nearest bookstore and purchase this essential book… right now] on Patti Smith’s Horses, has a magnificently illuminating passage by Tony Glover who was a witness to “Land’s” creation in studio, as Glover recounted, “Patti snuck into the booth that night, a haunted warp time of day. On the first take Patti did the singing part fine but when it came to do the poetry, Patti, went blank and just drew out occasional words, or urged the boys on, saying, “let it come down,, come down, “ or screaming “built it! build it! build it!” After the take, Patti would just overdub the vocal. She went back into the studio, and as the boys and I sprawled on the floor pillows and Cale hunched over the board, a super-strange flow came into the air.”\n\nIf I could go back in time, I would love to be a spectator in Electric Lady in New York when “Land” came to life. Just wait until you read what Glover described in Shaw’s 33 1/3 book as Tony continued his timeless true story on the recording of “Land” as he explained, “On the second take something weird happened,” Patti said later. “The Mexican boys and spaceships were gone—instead there was a black horse, and all those electrical wires and a sea—a “Sea of possibilities”—I didn’t know what direction the song was taking, there was all this strange imagery I didn’t understand.” When the take ended it was as if the whole room was holding it’s breath and they rolled the tape one more time. “…but it felt like it was The Exorcist, or somebody else was talking through my voice.” It was as if all the confidence that Shepherd inspired in Smith was fated to be unleashed at the very moment of “Land’s” lyrical creation at Electric Lady Studios. Smith life as a poet merged with her dream of being a rock and roll lyricist and she instantly became the warrior bard that we know and love today.\n\nThere are people how ask me about Patti Smith all the time, what’s the deal with Horses? Some just don’t want to take the time or just aren’t ready to dive into a work of art that becomes a reflection of themselves. I believe the best description of Horses comes from author Philip Shaw himself as he eloquently wrote in his outstanding 33 1/3 book on Patti Smith’s first album, “Horses, then, is about thinking, or it is about allowing oneself to be though, in the sense of an object of cognition. But above all, perhaps, it is about giving way to the violent impulses of the shadow self so that one may become a voyant. To do so, as Smith suggests, one must intensify the ego to the point of “me” drowns into the sea (la mer) of possibility.”\n\nThank you for the possibilities, Patti, for those of you who want to take the time to understand the infinite complexities of Smith’s masterpiece from Horses, press play and discover the song that inspired Michael Stipe, Morrissey, Johnny Marr and a legion of other artists, like me, to rise above all the doubting naysayers and dip our pens into the fire like stories in each of our creative destinies. Rediscover the beauty of “Land” today—and I guarantee after 9:25 you will be changed.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 254\n\nTues. Nov 12, 2013\n\n“Till There Was You [Live at the BBC]”\n\nThe Beatles\n\n1963\n\n“♫ No\n\nI never\n\nheard\n\nthem at\n\nall/ Till\n\nthere was\n\nyou ♫”\n\nThe new release of On Air, the second volume of The Beatles Live at the BBC sessions is double disc microcosms of what made the Beatles one of the greatest rock ‘n’ roll bands of our time. Author Malcolm Gladwell a definite fan of the Beatles, said it was the Fab Four’s work ethic that made the best, as he explained, “The Beatles had a musical gift, but what made them the Beatles was a random invitation to play in Hamburg… where they performed live as much as five hours a night, seven days a week. Talented? Absolutely. But they also simply put in more hours than anyone else.” Songs like This Peggy Lee cover of “Till There Was You” was one of the tracks that the Fab Four played during their legendary all night sets in Hamburg that made The Beatles the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\n\nSo what was it about playing in Hamburg that made the Beatles so great? The Fabs had to perform for over eight hours straight with no breaks as John Lennon said in Gladwell’s Outliers, “We got better and got more confidence. We couldn’t help it with all the experience playing all night long. It was handy being foreign. We had to try even harder, put our heart and soul into it, to get ourselves over. In Liverpool, we’d only ever done one-hour sessions, and we just used to do our best numbers, the same ones, at every one. In Hamburg, we had to play for eight hours, so we really had to find a new way of playing.”\n\nYou can hear the unbridled enthusiasm on the tracks from On Air: Volume 2 is some of the songs that The Beatles played at Hamburg. The same ones the Beatles had to play eight hours at night, seven days a week are the ones that sound the best. They say if you want to learn how to write a novel, you should type out a great one by Hemingway or Faulkner and by the end you will be able to pen the great American novel. It’s the same way with music. The Beatles played classic songs like “Lend Me Your Comb,” “Twist and Shout” and “Kansas City.” By performing these songs over and over again, the Fab Four learned the formula and that inspired the boys to pen their own songs like “I Saw Her Standing There.”\n\nAuthor of Shout, Philip Norman described the results of what playing at Hamburg did for The Beatles when he said, “They were no good on stage when they went there and they were very good when they came back. They learned not only stamina. They had to learn amount of numbers—cover versions of everything you can think of, not just rock and roll, a bit of jazz too. They weren’t disciplined onstage at all before that. But when they came back, they sounded like no one else. [Playing eight hours a night, seven days a week, in Hamburg, Germany] was the making of them.”\n\nOne of those slow jazzy songs was Paul McCartney’s beautiful cover of Peggy Lee’s 1961 hit song. “Till There Was You.” You can tell by the way that George Harrison’s clever guitar play elevates this once song from the Broadway musical of The Music Man with his one of a kind delicate surf rock solo giving this cover a layer of stoic substance over Paul’s crooner vocal. The Beatles just didn’t decide to record this vintage musical number for the BBC on July 10, 1963, “Till There Was You” was one of the many songs Paul, George, John and Ringo perfected during their grueling eight hours a day, seven days a week sets in Hamburg.\n\nDid you know it was Paul’s cousin who gave McCartney who played him records from Peggy Lee that he claims influenced him to pen songs that were “left and right of rock and roll?” McCartney talked about his love for “Till There Was You” during The Beatles Anthology, when The Beatles bassist said, “I could never see the difference between a beautiful melody and a cool rock ‘n’ roll song. I learnt to love all the ballady stuff through my dad and relatives – Till There Was You, My Funny Valentine – I thought these were good tunes. The fact that we weren’t ashamed of those leanings meants that the band could be a bit more varied. And there was a need for that, because we played cabaret a lot. Songs like Till There Was You would be the late-night cabaret material. They showed that we weren’t just another rock ‘n’ roll group. The Lennon/McCartney songwriting collaboration was forming during that period. We went on from “Love Me Do” to writing deeper, much more intense things. So it was just as well someone didn’t come up and tell us how uncool Till There Was You was.”\n\nUncool or not, constantly performing songs like “Till There Was You” in Hamburg were what gave the Fab Four the confidence to be the best band ever. If you want to hear the seeds of what made The Beatles pick up a copy of their new double disc collection On Air-Live at the BBC: Volume 2, and press play and you will rediscover why John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr are known as the greatest rock and roll band of all time.\n\nThe Beatles didn’t become the finest rockers over night; There were no shows like American/Pop Idol or The Voice back in 1960s. No sir, it took crafting their sound, playing show after show and like any artist, hard work of playing eight hours a night and seven days a week are the reasons The Beatles are known as the Mozart’s of rock and roll. Relive the magic with this once musical number recorded for The BBC and remade live on one single take into a cover song classic by John, Paul, George and Ringo. Instead of playing some of the familiar rock numbers, slip down to track 17 on disc on of On Air and you will hear the genesis of true greatness. “Till There Was You” was one of the songs that made The Beatles the renowned genius we know and love today.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 253\n\nMon. Nov 11, 2013\n\n“Birdland (Live in Los Angeles)”\n\nPatti Smith\n\n1975; 2001\n\n“♫ Am\n\nI alone\n\nin this\n\ngeneration? ♫”\n\nIn her inspirational biography Just Kids, Patti Smith wrote, “Robert [Mapplethorpe] would often use [the word magic] to describe us, about a successful poem or drawing, and ultimately in choosing a photograph on a contact sheet. “That’s the one with the magic,” he would say.” Magic is the perfect word to describes Patti’s “Birdland,” the song she crafted for 1975’s seminal album Horses. Inspired by Peter Reich’s memoir of his father, a counter culture psychoanalyst, Patti’s inspirational improvisational rock and roll tome has brought some peace to my own relationship with my old man. “Birdland” reflects a journey from a son’s perspective trying to connect with his distantly invisible father. More than just another rock song, Patti’s song keeps growing timelessly vibrant and one spin inside this prevalent 2001 version of “Birdland” reflects Smith’s own self-proclaimed, lyrical ‘telegram to a new breed’ of artists and dreamers.\n\nPatti Smith once said, “In art and dream may you proceed with abandon. In life may you proceed with balance and stealth?” The ironic thing is that “Birdland” defines that statement completely. This Horses cut is delivered with such dramatic and dream like abandoned but is also Birdland’s images are reflected in a stealthy soaring way and balance exquisitely well within the rhythmic canvas of cacophony and beauty brought to life by her “boys” the backing band of Lenny Kaye, Richard Sohl, Ivan Kral and Jay Daugherty and producer John Cale.\n\nSmith told The Observer in 2005 that it was Cale who gave her the space and confidence in the studio to bring out the improvisational and lyrical greatness of “Birdland” on Horses when Patti explained, “My greatest experience, as performer, on Horses’ – if only by getting her so wound up she needed catharsis. The song was inspired by The Book of Dreams, the childhood memoir of Peter Reich, son of radical psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich. ‘There’s a section in it where Peter describes a birthday party not long after his father died. He wandered outside and became convinced his father was coming down to get him and take him off in a spaceship.’ But what he thought was a squadron of UFOs revealed itself to be a flock of blackbirds. ‘This story haunted me, and when we recorded “Birdland”, which was totally improvised, that’s where the track went to.’ Starting with the young Reich hallucinating his father at the controls of the flying saucer, there’s a motif running through the song: ‘You are not human’ turns to ‘I am not human’ and then ‘we are not human’. Smith says ‘that’s really talking about myself. From very early on in my childhood – four, five years old – I felt alien to the human race. I felt very comfortable with thinking I was from another planet, because I felt disconnected – I was very tall and skinny, and I didn’t look like anybody else, I didn’t even look like any member of my family.”\n\nI can totally relate to Patti and her song “Birdland” because my father is a prominent psychiatrist and, because of my free-spirited artistic intentions, I historically have had a complicated relationship with my family. They have recently warmed to my poetic voice, but it has taken time, many years of questioning whether I myself was from another family, planet because how different I felt from my brothers and the rest of my family. I guess the only thing that made me different was that I never kept in how I felt. I let my emotions speak louder on the page.\n\nIn his 33 1/3 tome on Patti Smith’s Horses, author Philip Shaw expanded on the link between Reich and “Birdland” as he wrote, “When, in 1973, Reich’s son Peter published a memoir of his father, A Book of Dreams, the time was ripe for critical reappraisal of his work. For Patti Smith, however, the efficacy of Reich’s psychological and scientific research paled before the emotionally compelling account between father and son.”\n\nThis is why Patti’s “Birdland” reflects and connects so vividly with me. A son trying desperately to reconnect with his absent minded old school father. In many regards, “Birdland” is the story of my own relationship with my dad, who’s living but still distant, geographically and emotionally. It’s thawing and I feel like we’re slowly making new ground, at times it feels like I’m taking one step ahead for being too forward and he dives back into his traditional manly shell of taking twenty-two steps back. I like to think we have a respectful understanding. My Mami tells me, he know boasts to his colleagues about his “son—the poet.” He rarely shares that or any kind of praise with me, because I feel like he doesn’t want me to get complacent. I wish he knew that I inherited my dedicated work ethic from his hard working ways. I know the better I become the more the respect will come from all circles in and out of my family. But part of me has given up trying to please him or anyone and now I’m concentrating on my work and strengthening my own writing voice. With each line I pen, the reflection on my page gives my life more significance and that means more to me than anything else in this world.\n\nPatti Smith once said, “Good news doesn’t necessarily have to be a positive thing. Bringing good news is imparting hope to one’s fellow man.” Hope is all I feel, soaring higher every time I spin “Birdland” from Disc 2 of Land (1975-2002). Recorded live in Los Angeles, this rendition of “Birdland” sounds even more alive, vibrant and connects with Patti’s deeper voiced aged perfectly like the finest lyrical wine. Why is this so rare? Why is it when some rockers get older and try to sing their older songs, these artists seem outdated? But Patti and her songs grow timeless by the year. When Patti sings “Birdland” it’s as if the lyrics are torn from pages she wrote and improvised right before coming to the stage.\n\nWhen asked by NPR which song best illustrated her mission on Horses, Smith responded, “I think “Birdland” because – for various reasons.”Birdland” was an improvisation – built on an improvisation. It very, it so much exemplifies the communication of my band, especially between Richard, Lenny and I. And it speaks of this new breed, you know, the new generations who will be dreaming in animation, you know, the new generations that will race across the fields no longer presidents but prophets. That was my – it was like my telegram to the new breed.”\n\nAre you ready to receive Patti Smith’s timeless lyrical telegram that is this 2001 live version of “Birdland?” The New York Times Magazine described this Book of Dreams inspired song as, “Patti’s “Birdland” lyrics phosphoresce with a dark glow never before found in any kind of rock” Embrace the beautiful darkened glow while opening your ears and let your imagination flow inside the arms with this classic Horses cut; why fight it? One spin of “Birdland” and Patti Smith’s improvisational wings will definitely set you artists and dreams free tonight.\n\nclick on this link to experience:\n\nPatti Smith – “Birdland (Live in Los Angeles 2001 from Land (1975-2002)”\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 252\n\nSun. Nov 10, 2013\n\n“Sunday Morning”\n\nLou Reed & The Velvet Underground\n\n1967\n\n“♫ Watch\n\nout the\n\nworlds\n\nbehind\n\nyou♫”\n\nAt first listen, “Sunday Morning” sounds like the idyllic soundtrack to a romantic wake-up call between two lovers entwined— following their inspirations with lustier thoughts in bed. Despite the lovely arrangement, there’s a dark lyrical undercurrent seething underneath this once apparent heavenly setting. But just like most Lou Reed songs, it’s all what you feel within the sounds of this classic Velvet Underground single. Is “Sunday Morning” an anthem for the paranoid obsessive or a beautiful song dedicates to Reed’s ideal lover on his favorite day of the week? You decide…\n\nIn his 33 1/3 tome, The Velvet Underground & Nico, author Joe Harvard claims that the first song for V.U.’s first album was a precursor to two totally different future rock songs as he explained, when he wrote, ““Sunday Morning” may be the root of the family tree of songs like “Every Breath You Take” and “Satellite of Love,” whose pretty, lulling melodies mask their true thematic darkness. Sting and Lou Reed have admitted that their gently soothing aural textures mask the ugly expression of an emotion—obsessive jealously—so powerful it evokes the desire for full-time surveillance.” What you think is song for a picture perfect day becomes something with a more sinister lyrical identity.\n\nSo what was the genesis for Lou’s obsessive love melody? According to Dave Thompson’s Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell: The Dangerous Glitter of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, “Reed was strumming a melody one day when Warhol stopped to listen and asked to hear more. “I didn’t have the lyrics…and he said, ‘Why don’t you make it a song about paranoia?’ I thought that was great, so I came up with, ‘watch out, the world is behind you…,’ which I feel is the ultimate paranoid statement in that the world cares enough to watch you.” Andy Warhol was the one who suggested the theme to Lou, giving Reed’s love song a more infatuated undertone.\n\nReed’s love theme of obsession, “Sunday Morning” was the last song recorded for The Velvet Underground and Nico because producer Tom Wilson said that V.U.’s album needed a single as Tom Wilson told Paul Morrissey in his book Nico: The Life & Lies of An Icon, ““You couldn’t put an album out without having a single. But there’s nothing on [The Velvet Underground & Nico] that could be a single, and I want Nico to sing it. But I need a commercial song for Nico to sing.”” That’s when Lou brought Wilson “Sunday Morning” but not for Nico, Reed wanted to sing it. Author Nigel Williamson described the results of Lou’s vocal in his book, White Light/White Heat: The Velvet Underground: Day-by-Day, when he wrote, “Reed’s decision to commandeer the lead vocal is justified by the end result, however ungraciously he might have asserted himself in the studio. The song is almost sunny and catchy enough to be a Mamas & The Papas tune, it’s seductive, yearning beauty—and Reed’s effectively breathy singing—masking an ambiguous unease and uncertainty.” Williamson is right; Lou was the only choice for lead vocals on “Sunday Morning.” Nico’s low voice would have stifled, the sunshine making it a monotone song without Reed’s extra layer of lyrical delicacy of light.\n\nOne fan of “Sunday Morning” was Ian McCulloch, legendary Lou Reed fan who agreed with Nigel’s assessment, and is most famously know as the front man for Echo & The Bunnymen who told Chris Adams in his book, Turquoise Days: The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen, when the lead singer of Echo once said, “I think [The Velvet Underground & Nico] is actually the greatest album ever made. The Beatles or the Stones can’t touch this. It covers the complete spectrum between weird drug songs and seemingly innocent love songs, but even with ‘Sunday Morning’ there’s an undercurrent of weirdness, mainly due to Lou Reed’s voice. Perfect.”\n\nLou Reed’s lovely romantic anthem for closeted obsessives was the perfect way to begin The Velvet Underground & Nico. At first glance, “Sunday Morning” sounds like the ideal love song to lay in bed with your lover but, Reed’s lyrics hit at more sinister undertones. Lou’s vocal sounds like the nakedness of vulnerability coming to life through his subconscious feeding the paranoia unable to be satisfied within the moment. It’s like, Reed’s lyrical persona doesn’t believe he’s worthy enough and is already pondering where his lover is going when she gets out of his bed and walks out the door. So what do you think? Is ‘Sunday Morning” the soundtrack for two romantics lost in the throws within their passions on their favorite day of the week or is this opening song from The Velvet Underground & Nico filled with subliminal suspicious buried within Reed’s shadowy lyrics?\n\nI still believe the best description of this opening song from Velvet Underground & Nico was by Sterling Morrison in Peter Hogan’s The Rough Guide to The Velvet Underground when V.U.’s guitarist famously said that “Sunday Morning” captures the essence of— “when you’ve been up all Saturday night and you’re crawling home while people are going to church. The sun is up and you’re like Dracula, hiding you eyes.” Either way, this 1967 single remains a Velvet Underground classic and a perfect song to wake up to—for this or any “Sunday Morning.”\n\nAnd here’s my favorite, a link to:\n\nV.U.’s “Sunday Morning (Original Mono Single Version)”\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 251\n\nFri. Nov 8, 2013\n\n“Leave”\n\nR.E.M.\n\n1996\n\n“♫ Leave\n\nit all\n\nbehind ♫”\n\nDon’t look back I told myself, as I took those last steps from the corporate job I had for years. The way it happened, so cold and callous, it was their way of saying they didn’t want or need me working there anymore; I accepted it, even if it happened on the day after Christmas. What a present to be laid off. But I’m proud of myself because I never looked back. R.E.M.’s “Leave” has always been the soundtrack to that one night that has led me to my new path that would have happened if I hadn’t followed Michael Stipe advice to embrace my fear by walking unafraid and leave it all behind.\n\nDid you know that originally R.E.M. wanted to open New Adventures in Hi-Fi with “Leave?” Although, they ended up settling for “How The West Was Won And Where It Got Us,” can you imagine this underrated rocker would have been one of the best openers in R.E.M. history? In Johnny Black’s Reveal: The Story of R.E.M., Peter Buck described “Leave” as—“It’s a large, noisy, clanky, synthesizer-driven rock’n’roll song. It was the very last song that was written and recorded and mixed for the record.”\n\nThis Hi-Fi song has the distinction of being the last song drummer Bill Berry ever helped compose as a member of R.E.M. Scott McCaughey told David Buckley in his book R.E.M.: Fiction, how “Leave” came to life when the guitarist explained, and “The intro is just me and Bill backstage. Nobody else was around and Bill said, “I’ve got an idea for a song, play these chords.” I got this weird sound from the little practice keyboard we had in the dressing room, then he played the melody on acoustic guitar, and that’s exactly what’s on the record. That’s a great song—it seems to be a dark horse favorite of a lot of people.” Unbeknownst to Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Michael Stipe, “Leave” became Berry’s farewell song to his comrades. It was as if Bill had ironically and literally lived out Stipe’s fated lyrics. By the time it came to record R.E.M.’s 1999 Up, the fabulous foursome from Athens, GA were no more.\n\nIf you feel familiarity, Hi-Fi’s “Leave” is definitely a precursor to Up’s “Walk Unafraid.” Both songs deal with fear. “Leave” is the leap and “Unafraid” is the continuation of the story, when you pick yourself up after the fall. Patti Smith is the link between “Leave” and “Walk”. Smith sparked Michael Stipe to pen both of these brave songs with her sage inspiration as Buck explained when he said, “When we wrote Leave, Patti Smith was visiting. She and Michael Stipe were sitting in the next room while we were really rocking out with these tiny little amps. Patti came in and went, ‘Wow…’ while Michael said, ‘Hey, you guys are doing some weird shit over there’.” With songs like “Leave,” everyone’s favorite Athens, GA band proved that this wasn’t your little brother’s R.E.M anymore. Those days of “Losing My Religion” were a thing of the past. Patti gave Stipe the lyrical courage to pen both, “Leave” and “Unafraid,” these two timeless songs of braving fear for the unafraid.\n\n“Leave” will always be the soundtrack of that December 26th night that I’ll never forget. As I walked away, I could feel myself falling. I embraced the coldness. At that moment the air emboldened me. I didn’t know where I would land but no matter the scars, I knew it would be a better and more fulfilling place. And because of that night when I had to guts to stand up for myself, I still thrive within the inspirational sounds of this Hi-Fi cut.\n\nAfter the bands tumultuous Monster Tour when Bill Berry had a brain aneurysm, and Mike Mills and Michael Stipe both needed to have surgery, “Leave” reflects a time that R.E.M. as a band would like to forget. They overcame their health obstacles enough to record an album, Hi-Fi that Buck and his band mates believed, at the time, was one of the bands best as he once proudly explained, “I do think that we touch on a wider range of music than just about anyone right now. The Beatles used to do it, Led Zeppelin used to do it and I don’t think we get enough credit for doing it.” “Leave” is daring and so far from songs like “Religion” that signaled, creatively R.E.M. was still a vibrant band with so much more to prove. Because of R.E.M.’s sense of inspirational, perseverance— “Leave” will always remind me of feeding that familiar of not being afraid, reflecting all the brevity that Michael Stipe sings, in between the faithful lyrical leaps within his eternal rhymes.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 250\n\nThurs. Nov 7, 2013\n\n“Helpless”\n\nNeil Young\n\n2013\n\n“♫ Big\n\nbirds flying\n\nacross the\n\nsky/ throwing\n\nshadows on our\n\neyes ♫”\n\nI woke up this morning with Neil Young’s “Helpless” in my head. It was kind of strange; it always is, when songs that I never connected with immediately resonate with me on the state in between sleep and wakefulness. Historically, “Helpless” hasn’t really been one of my favorite Neil songs, until I saw The Last Waltz and I found a new appreciation for this Young classic when I heard Neil Young performed this with The Band and Joni Mitchell singing harmonies. Watching sparked an immediate epiphany; instantly reawakening a renewed admiration for the gloriously eternal sounds of Neil Young’s classic, “Helpless.”\n\nDid you know that Neil Young actually recorded his first version of “Helpless” as a member of Crosby Stills Nash & Young? Actually, Neil wrote this before joining the band, and it was this song that sealed Neil’s fate, when Stephen Stills took David Crosby to Neil’s house in Topanga to convince Young to join their band. Crosby shared what happened when they arrived at Young’s abode when he told Crawdaddy, “He [Neil} played ‘Helpless,’ and by the time he finished, we were asking him if we could join his band.”\n\nThat’s how good Neil Young song was at its first and earliest incarnation and “Helpless” remains equally as timeless as it did on that day in 1969. Nash was one of the few members of CSN who was at first reluctant to let Neil into the band but all that changed after Young shared “Helpless” with his new bandmates as Graham explained, “Neil’s effect on the band was immediate and very fulfilling. He adds a certain edge to the sound and, of course, he is an incredible musician. We became a better band because of the inclusion of Neil Young.”\n\nAuthor Jimmy McDonough had one of the best descriptions of “Helpless” in his book Shakey: Neil Young’s biography, when he wrote, “The one great pleasure is the cut Young failed to capture with the [Crazy] Horse, “Helpless,” a ballad so spare not even Crosby, Stills and Nash could muck it up. William S. Burroughs once said, “The function of art and all creative thought is to make us aware of what we know and don’t know. You can’t tell anybody anything he doesn’t know already.” Primordial, aching, trancelike, “Helpless” is something you already know, and it makes you believe Young is the only messenger of his work. It’s the only one of his songs I could actually imagine Otis Redding singing.”\n\nAlthough, one of the things that kept me away from Neil’s song was all the plethora of artists that wouldn’t stop covering “Helpless,” now, I would have loved to have heard Otis Redding take on Neil’s classic. I always felt like Just like Leonard Cohen’s most famous song, “Helpless” was to Neil Young’s “Hallelujah,” both songs have been covered way too many times. But still, both songs are two of the greatest songs written in modern times. And it can’t be a coincidence that two of the most covered songs in the last twenty years were written by these two Canadian born songwriting giants, Leonard Cohen and Neil Young. And now I understand why all of these artists covered this Neil’s classic, once you feel the magic of Young’s lyrics, and you’re left to share the beauty of “Helpless” with everyone that you know and love. Two of my favorite covers have to be KD Lang’s, which you can hear above and Patti Smith’s mystical rendition from her 2007 album Twelve right here, down below.\n\nWhen asked by Esquire, Young shared what he felt like was his best moment in music when Neil explained, “Sometimes when I’m playing my guitar, I get to a point where it gets very cold and icy inside me. It’s very refreshing. Every breath is like you’re at the North Pole. Your head starts to freeze. Your inhalations are big — more air than you ever thought there is— starts pouring in. There’s something magical about it. Sometimes when it happens, you wonder if you’re gonna be okay. Can you handle it?”\n\nNeil’s right, for years I wasn’t ready to handle the vivid reflections of his most classic song. Maybe it was simply the title and theme of the song. For the longest time, I’ve had this aura of helplessness that surrounded me in my life of confusion and Neil’s song was just another reminder that I still hadn’t figured out what to do with my life. 2013 changed everything when I accepted my calling as a poet. After I finally got accepted into Graduate School, I started this quest of going back and trying to experience a lot of the music, movies and art that I may have accidentally overlooked because of my insecurities. “Helpless” is one of these songs that I’ve only started to treasure. The more I spin the various versions of Young’s song, I’ve discovered that Neil’s lyrics aren’t promoting surrendering to the inevitable but more of embracing these moments of vulnerability and beauty that most people take for granted in their every day lives.\n\nNeil Young shared the perfect anecdote that reflected the theme of his most covered song, “Helpless” when he told Esquire in 2005, “The wisest person I ever met had to be my companion in the hospital a few months ago. I was recovering from complications after an operation to remove an aneurism in my brain. She was about eighty-five years old and maybe five feet tall. An old black lady from South Carolina. This young nurse wasn’t really in touch with what she was doing, and the old lady would tell her how to do what she needed to do without telling her. She never talked down to her, just gave examples. I felt that this old woman must be deeply religious, but there was nothing forceful about her. I woke up one morning at a quarter to six and looked out the window. Fog was on the bridge outside the room, and I said, “Well, that’s just beautiful.” And she said: “Yes, it is.” She turned toward me with this eighty-five-year-old face that didn’t have a line on it, no strain, nothing, and she said: “So the master’s not taking you. It’s not your turn.””\n\nNow it’s your turn to rediscover the classic. Don’t be like me and let you’re insecurities hold you back from experiences vintage songs like Neil Young’s “Helpless.” Give into the glorious sounds of “Helpless” and Neil Young will help set you free.\n\nDon’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Tres: Day 248\n\nTues. Nov. 05, 2013\n\n“Heroin”\n\nLou Reed & The Velvet Underground\n\n1967\n\n“♫ I\n\nguess\n\nI just\n\ndon’t\n\nknow♫”\n\nI remember the first time I actually tasted the sound and voice of Lou Reed’s “Heroin.” Like many young Doors fans in the spring of 1991, it was in the movie theater while watching Oliver Stone’s film The Doors. It was the scene when The Lizard King goes to the Factory in NYC to visit Andy Warhol. There was something about the way Oliver Stone had his cinematographer Robert Richardson film that floating scene that actually made the audience in the theater feel like you were high. It that moment as Morrison wandered through the glorious tripped out carnival world of Warhol’s Factory, the soundtrack of The Velvet’s brought Lou Reed’s vivid “Heroin” lyrics to life on the big screen. More than just a song about getting high, The Velvets song made me feel like I wanted to know so much more. Reed’s lyrics opened my eyes to new sounds and sparked a life altering creative life change. “Heroin” is a cut that still inspires me hit play on his song to this and every day.\n\n“Heroin” was more than just a song about getting high. Lou Reed even said as much in Victor Bockris’ Transformer, “At the time I wrote ‘Heroin,’ I felt like a very rather negative, strung-out, violent, aggressive person. I meant those songs to sort of exorcize the darkness, or the self-destructive element in me, and hope that other people would take them the same way. ‘Heroin’ is very close to the feeling you get from smack. It starts on a certain level, it’s deceptive. You think you’re enjoying it. But by the time it hits you, it’s too late. You don’t have any choice. It comes at you harder and faster and keeps on coming. The song is everything that the real thing is doing to you.”\n\nReed’s song was more than just about injecting the drug into your veins, to me; Lou made ‘the real thing’ from his drug sound like a literal heroine. It felt like the intoxication notice of Lou’s mythical flame was actually inside your veins, taking over very aspect of your mind, body and soul. It was more than waiting to get high but it was as if Reed was bringing to life the enraptured ecstasy of falling in love with a person, place, a drug, or a fling. Lou opened the doors of my closed off sanitized virgin vanilla lifestyle and wanting to experience more of a life that was reflecting creatively, and not literally, inside Reed’s inspirational lyrics.\n\nBut I wasn’t the first and for this fact, according to Nigel Williamson and his book White Light/White Heat: The Velvet Underground Day by Day, Reed and The Velvet’s experienced lots of backlash for releasing “Heroin” on their 1967 debut album as he wrote, “Over the years, Reed and the Velvets will weather their share of criticism for their support of sensationalizing and glorifying or even advocating the use of the drug. But in presenting his largely objective account of heroin in such a poetic fashion, he might perhaps make the prospect of using the drug more attractive than many find comfortable. (“It wasn’t pro or con,” Reed later tells the 1992 BBC documentary Curious, “It was just talking about heroin, from the point of view of someone taking it.”)” I won’t deny that Lou’s song sparked in an interest in wanting to experiment with mind altering substances but Oliver Stone’s The Doors movie and Gus Van Sant’s Drugstore Cowboy tripped out drug fantasies were more influentially inspiring a need to experience drugs on that same illuminating level.\n\nReed defending his poetic license of using “Heroin” as personified fodder for his very popular song with The Velvets to Q Magazine, as quoted in Joe Harvard’s splendid 33 1/3 tome on The Velvet Underground & Nic0, “I was really fucked up. And that’s all there is to it. It’s like I really encouraged it. I did a lot of things that were really stupid and I don’t know how they could sit and listen seriously to that stuff. […] It was such a big deal, a song called “Heroin” being on an album and I thought that was really stupid. I mean, they had it movies in the ‘40s—The Man with the Golden Arm, for Christ sakes. So what was the big deal? People were offended because we did a song called “Heroin” but there’s plenty of stuff about that in literature and no one gives a shit but its rock and roll so we must be pushing drugs or something. I thought after all that stuff about “Heroin,” well…If you find that shocking, take a look at this. It was a stupid, childish attitude I had but, you know, as long as they were going that way I thought, “Fuck it, I’ll give it a little push that way, a little street theater.” Getting involved in all that was like going along with it, pandering to it. I don’t think it brought out the most attractive features in me.”\n\nLou’s Velvet Underground bandmates were quick to defend Reed’s “Heroin” song like guitarist Sterling Morrison when he said in Victor Bockris and Gerald Malanga’s book Up-tight: The Velvet Underground Story, ““Heroin” is a beautiful song too, possibly Reed’s greatest and a truthful one. It’s easy to rationalize about a song you like, but it should be pointed out that when Reed sings he’s only glamorizing heroin for people who want to die. The real damage, particularly in New York, has been done through the cult of personality. Rock fans have taken heroin thinking Lou took heroin, forgetting that the character in the song wasn’t necessarily Lou Reed.” Lou and Morrison’s band mate drummer Maureen Tucker, the straightest-edge of all the members of The Velvets also stood up for Lou in Harvard’s 33 1/3 book when she said, “It started as a sort of theater which the audience took to heart. Because we sang “Heroin” people assumed we were junkies; because we played “Venus in Furs” they thought we beat each other. There were no smack heads in [The Velvet Underground].”\n\nAll of this negativity towards Lou’s song would all be for not if Reed hadn’t composed the literal lyrical equivalent to William Burroughs’ Junky on wax. Yes, “Heroin” the song is that good, in the literary and poetic sense or else would we still be talking about this mind altering song over forty-five years since its original release on The Velvet Underground and Nico in 1967. It’s not like Reed was the one who created the drug and used his song to make profits from the sale of “Heroin.” Lou was using his poetic license to thrill and the act of being enthralled with the idea of losing yourself inside of the moment whether it is with a drug or a person. If Reed hadn’t had been so successful, all of this criticism and conjecture about his song story wouldn’t exist. But it does, “Heroin” the song is better than the act of doing the drug as Joe Harvard wrote in his 33/13 book on The Velvet Underground and Nico, “In no way is [Lou Reed’s song] meant as an endorsement of heroin as a means of spiritual growth! I would point out that transcendence isn’t everything; if you think being junkie is romantic, just wait until heroin has you “transcending” the ability to keep a job, maintain a relationship or control your bowels, among other wicked spiritual stuff.”\n\nBut Reed’s “Heroin” is powerful stuff because Lou does evoke a very beautiful sense of transcendence. And that’s what we look for great art in books, music and movies to do for us, to take us away from our own mundane existence. And what better way to inject some excitement in your life than to inhale a glimpse of Reed’s mind-altering song. Good luck trying to relive that elation in your next hit of the drug because you’ll need more and more of the substance to get you there. That’s why music is the only thing that keeps me high these days. And Reed’s “Heroin” is proof of this because, this Velvet Underground cut get’s better and better with each listen; this makes Lou’s song far better than the real thing because the euphoria you experience from listening to Reed’s lyrics, you can recapture by simple dropping the needle on your vinyl spinning the uplifting sounds of “Heroin” over and over again.\n\nWhen I listen to the opening strands of “Heroin” it’s like I’m like I’m that naïve twenty-two year old in that movie theater in San Antonio watching Oliver Stone’s The Doors and experiencing the mind-altering sounds of Lou Reed’s music for the first time to my young-at-heart virgin-like ears.\n\nMore than just a song about getting high, Reed’s song inspired one of my first college poems as a university freshman where I personified “Heroin” as a woman that I craved even more than that illicit street drug. This Velvets song inspired me to open my mind to new forms of art, literature and music that went deeper than your average disposable pop culture flavor of the minute. Reed’s song opened me up to William Burroughs which introduced me to The Beats and Allan Ginsberg…all of this because I heard Lou’s song in The Doors movie. Some people just ignored the tripped out scene with “Heroin,” Lou’s song sparked me into a life-altering journey of me becoming a poet searching for meaning on the page like Reed did in rhythms and lyrics of “Heroin.” I may have never tried the junk but my mind will eternally be altered by experiencing the glorious effects, while inhaling the inspirational hit sounds of Lou Reed’s “Heroin”."
