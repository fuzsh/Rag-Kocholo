Privacy Policy\n\nEffective Date: January 1, 2020\n\nLast Updated on: July 1, 2022\n\nThis Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to all visitors, users, and others (“consumers”) to Ponycanyon USA Inc.’s (“we”, “our”) websites https://ponycanyon.us/, https://worldotafy.com, and https://otacolors.com (the “Websites”), and contains certain provisions applicable solely to visitors, users and others who reside in the State of California (\"California consumers\" or \"you\").

If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at 22010 Main St. Suite 300 Irvine, CA 92614 or email us at pcusa_info@ponycanyon.co.jp.\n\nInformation We Collect\n\nOur Websites collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device (\"personal information\").

You may choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of the Websites may not function properly.\n\nUse of Personal Information\n\nWe may use, or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following purposes:\n\nTo fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, if you share your name and contact information to ask a question about our products or services, we will use that personal information to respond to your inquiry.\n\nTo provide, support, personalize, and develop our Websites, products, and services.\n\nTo create, maintain, customize, and secure your account with us.\n\nTo provide you with support and to respond to your inquiries, including to investigate and address your concerns and monitor and improve our responses.\n\nTo personalize your Website experience and to deliver content and product and service offerings relevant to your interests, including targeted offers and ads through our Website, third-party sites, and via email or text message (with your consent, where required by law).\n\nTo help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our Websites, products and services, databases and other technology assets, and business.\n\nFor testing, research, analysis, and product development, including to develop and improve our Websites, products, and services.\n\nTo respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.\n\nAs described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.\n\nTo evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about our Website users is among the assets transferred.\n\nWe will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.\n\nSharing Personal Information\n\nWe may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. We may share your personal information by disclosing it to a third party for a business purpose. We only make these business purpose disclosures under written contracts that describe the purposes, require the recipient to keep the personal information confidential, and prohibit using the disclosed information for any purpose except performing the contract. In the preceding twelve (12) months, Company has disclosed personal information for a business purpose to the categories of third parties indicated in the chart below.\n\nWe do not sell personal information and in the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold personal information.

However, please know we do not currently sell data triggering that statute’s opt-out requirements.\n\nCalifornia Consumers’ Rights and Choices\n\nThe CCPA provides California consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes California consumers’ CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.\n\nRight to Know and Data Portability\n\nYou have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months (the \"right to know\"). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see the Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete section below), we will disclose to you:\n\nThe categories of personal information we collected about you.\n\nThe categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.\n\nOur business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.\n\nThe categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.\n\nIf we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:\n\nsales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased, if any; and\n\ndisclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.\n\nThe specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).\n\nWe do not provide a right to know or data portability disclosure for B2B personal information.\n\nRight to Delete\n\nYou have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions (the \"right to delete\"). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see the Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete section below), we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:\n\nComplete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.\n\nDetect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.\n\nDebug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.\n\nExercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.\n\nComply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.

To designate an authorized agent, you must provide your agent your signed, written consent to make a request to know or delete your personal information on your behalf. We may contact you to verify such consent has been made.\n\nYou may also make a request to know or delete on behalf of your child by providing written, official verification of your status as your child’s parent or legal guardian.\n\nYou may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know or delete must:\n\nProvide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include:\n\nVerification of your name, email address, phone number, zip code or other identifying information.\n\nOfficial documents verifying your legal status as your child’s parent or legal guardian.\n\nDescribe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\n\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\n\nYou do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know or delete.\n\nWe will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make it.\n\nFor instructions on exercising your personal information sale opt-out rights, see the Personal Information Sales Opt-Out Rights section below.\n\nResponse Timing and Format\n\nWe will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at pcusa_info@ponycanyon.co.jp.\n\nWe endeavor to substantively respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\n\nIf you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.\n\nAny disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.\n\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\n\nPersonal Information Sales Opt-Out Rights\n\nWe do not sell your personal information. However, to the extent that our use of your personal information to provide our Website, products and services to you may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA, and if you are age 16 or older, you may submit a request to “opt-out” by using the link provided below. We do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years old. Please note that some uses of personal information may not be considered “sales” under the CCPA and certain exemptions may apply under the CCPA.\n\nTo exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page link:\n\nhttps://ponycanyon.us/do-not-sell-my-personal-information/\n\nOnce you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales, if any.\n\nYou do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out rights. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.\n\nNon-Discrimination\n\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:\n\nDeny you goods or services.\n\nCharge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.\n\nProvide you a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\nSuggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.\n\nOther California Privacy Rights and Disclosures\n\nCalifornia’s \"Shine the Light\" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Websites that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, if any. To make such a request, please send an email to pcusa_info@ponycanyon.co.jp.\n\nCalifornia Do Not Track Disclosure\n\nWe may use cookies to track our customers over time and across third party websites for targeted advertising purposes. Your web browser may transmit “Do-Not-Track” signals to our Websites and other online services with which your browser communicates, if you have enabled this feature. We currently do not take any action in response to these signals. Third parties cannot collect any other personally identifiable information from the Websites unless you provide it to them directly.\n\nThird-Party Tracking\n\nThird parties may track your online activities and collect personally identifiable information about you across time or across websites, including our Websites. We do not control third parties’ tracking, collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way, and we encourage you to contact such third parties for further information.\n\nThird-Party Plug-ins\n\nOur Websites may use third-party plug-ins to enable Website features and functionality, and to enable you to easily share information with others on social media and/or enjoy multimedia content on the Websites.
