        "text": "Rights-management tech firm Orfium has another deal in Japan. It is working for label Pony Canyon, tracking the latter’s catalogue on user-generated content platforms to chase down any unclaimed royalties for artists like Official Hige Dandism.\n\nPony Canyon thus becomes the latest in a growing roster of clients in Japan for Orfium, joining Avex, Bandai Namco, Warner Music Japan and collecting society Jasrac.\n\n“Building on our recent partnerships across Asia and beyond, the deal marks further progress in our journey to providing the technology infrastructure for the global entertainment industry,” said CEO Rob Wells.\n\n“As anime music, and Japanese music more broadly, gains popularity around the world, it is vital to have a global solution to ensure that those who create the music benefit from that popularity,” added Orfium Japan boss Alan Swarts.\n\n“Now that music released by Pony Canyon is reaching more audiences and our artists are experiencing increasing international success, it is important for us to have the right infrastructure in place for creators to earn royalties when their music is used on YouTube,” said Pony Canyon’s music marketing division general manager Shinichi Ishii."
