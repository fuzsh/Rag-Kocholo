The exception would be small studios like Studio Rikka (Time of Eve), or titles that are completely funded by the studios creating them\n\npenguintruth wrote:\n\nThe only thing I know about Pony Canyon is that they teamed up with Toei to produce the DB/Z/GT Dragon Boxes.\n\nThey produce a ton of anime.
