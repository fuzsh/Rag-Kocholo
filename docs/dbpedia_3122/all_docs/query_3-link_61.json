        "text": "The dying days of 2008 saw the birth of “The Almighty Fallen” lifelong friends Phil Dixon and Joe Goudie tired of reality idols and TV diva’s.The two friends hungry to produce a fresh slant on the rock/goth crossover, spent many long winter months in the recording studio tirelessly writing and recording until they were confident they had conjured up something very different from anything else out there!\n\nSongs began to flow fast, almost effortlessly. They drip fed demo’s to some long term media contacts their demo’s to play on radio shows under obscure names to judge the publics reaction, although knowing that a live audience would be the acid test. Then a call from a Festival promoter in Finland wanting a to see the band at a live showcase! Under the name The Almighty Fallen and using the same session musicians who had played on demo’s they played the packed house showcase and were an instant success! They played a few more live venues including the 3,500 seater Dublin National Arena playing the 30 minute interval of an MMA show and televised to over 30 countries in Europe where amazing and really helped\n\nhone their sound. However, it soon became obvious they needed a settled line up. It was finally time to put a band together ."
