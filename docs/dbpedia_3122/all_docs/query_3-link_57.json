        "text": "Keith & Kristyn Getty\n\nFor over a decade, Keith and Kristyn Getty have occupied a unique space in the world of music as pre-eminent modern hymn writers with hymns such as “In Christ Alone” among the 32 songs in the CCLI top 500 between the USA and UK. Born in Northern Ireland, the award-winning artists became the first musicians of the modern era to be given the OBE from Queen Elizabeth II for service to music and hymn writing.\n\nThey have become ambassadors for the genre, from their “Sing” book and Conference which welcomes over 15,000 people in Nashville every year, to performing for Presidents and Prime Ministers, a hymn tour and Christmas tour which plays annually at Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center (as well as two TV specials on PBS and TBN), as well as founding a publishing company, record label, and online learning company for a new generation of writers and church musicians. Keith and Kristyn live between Northern Ireland and Nashville with their four daughters.\n\nBlessing Offor\n\n2022 has proven to be a breakout year for the Nashville-based singer/songwriter. Earlier this year, Blessing released his debut EP Brighter Days (via Chris Tomlin’s Bowyer & Bow imprint in partnership with Universal/Capitol CMG) to critical acclaim, with the self-titled track peaking at #2 on Billboard’s Christian Airplay chart. “Brighter Days” remains a popular track, currently at #8 on Billboard’s Hot Christian Songs chart. Blessing made his national television debut on NBC’s The Kelly Clarkson Show, and subsequently released the Brighter Days (Live Sessions) EP, featuring intimate live versions of tracks from his debut EP. Recently, Blessing collaborated with GRAMMY® winner TobyMac on his new single “The Goodness.” The track is currently at #6 on the Christian Airplay chart and climbing on all Christian radio charts.\n\nMatt Boswell\n\nMatt Boswell is lead pastor of The Trails Church in North Texas and the President of Doxology & Theology. He is an author and hymn writer, known for songs including “His Mercy is More” and “Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery”. Boswell earned his MA in Christian Ministry, ThM in Biblical Spirituality, and PhD in Christian Worship from Southern Seminary. He lives in Texas with his wife and four kids."
