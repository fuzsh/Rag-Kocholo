        "text": "EXIT TUNES is a Japanese record label that is managed by Pony Canyon.\n\nFormerly known as the the label QUAKE INC., in October 2011 they changed titles to EXIT TUNES Inc. On July 1, 2019, all business with the exception of music publishing and writer management was transferred to the parent company Pony Canyon, and the label was changed to \"Exit Music Publishing\". It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Pony Canyon. Depending on the music distribution website, the previous company name \"QUAKE HOLDINGS INC.\" is still displayed.\n\nHistory\n\nThe company was established in June 2011 as an Internet specialty printing company. It was then changed to a dance music label in 2005 when its president DJ UTO raised funds through the reality television program \"Dragon's Den\".\n\nDJ UTO owns or manages various music licenses for labels outside Japan in the trance genre and in 2006, became a major distributor with the investment assistance from Pony Canyon. Although Western music was the main style of music to be distributed, sales were diminishing and the company would seek new business ventures while working on cover albums for anime songs. The release of 2008's \"CaramellDansen\" received the Japan Gold Disc Award (Western Single Category). On August 27, 2008, Yahoo! Auctions received preferential rights to negotiate a business transfer to the music distribution website \"mF247\". However, September 10 deadline for the negotiations had passed and the business transfer was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2009, Pony Canyon acquired 50% of the shares and the company fully became a subsidiary of the Pony Canyon Group. Since 2009, EXIT TUNES has released a variety of Vocaloid Compilation Series albums using the Vocaloids Hatsune Miku and Megpoid (common name: GUMI) and albums for singers who started out their careers by singing on live streaming websites. In a massive milestone, the May 19, 2010 release of \"EXIT TUNES PRESENTS Vocalogenesis feat. Hatsune Miku\" was the first ever CD using Vocaloid or speech synthesis software to have reached 1st place in the Oricon Weekly Rankings. The January 19, 2011 release of \"EXIT TUNES PRESENTS Vocalonexus feat. Hatsune Miku\" also reached 1st in the Oricon Weekly Rankings. After this string of success, in October 2011, the company changed its name from QUAKE to EXIT TUNES.\n\nIn December 2011, \"EXIT TUNES ACADEMY\" (known as ETA) started a live concert event. It was an event that featured artists who were regarded as very popular by Netizens in Japan. In May 2012, \"EXIT TUNES ACADEMY - EXIT TUNES 10th ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL\" was held at Saitama Super Arena to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its founding. There were approximately 17,000 fans in attendance. In December of the same year, the label developed and released their own Vocaloid, \"MAYU\".\n\nIn April 2013, the \"EXIT TUNES ACADEMY - EXIT TUNES 11th ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL\" event was held at Saitama Super Arena where over 18,000 fans attended.\n\nIn March 2014, Glutamine's 1st album was released and the Japan Record Association certified it with the prestigious Gold Disc.\n\nIn April 2014, EXIT TUNES became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pony Canyon. As a result, DJ UTO was no longer president of the label, and was replaced by Pony Canyon's representative director Shusaku Yoshida. In August, \"EXIT TUNES ACADEMY FINAL SPECIAL 2014\" was held at Saitama Super Arena for a third consecutive year, where a record audience of 25,000 fans celebrated the event across multiple stages. On December 31st of the same year, \"EXIT TUNES ACADEMY FINAL COUNTDOWN SPECIAL 2014-2015\" was held at Tokyo Dome City Hall.\n\nIn August 2015, \"EXIT TUNES ACADEMY Japan Budokan 2015\" was held for over 8000 participants. With the support of Nihon Kougakuin Music College, EXIT TUNES ACADEMY was able to sell \"Student Seats\" on the second level of the arena to allow students interested in music to attend.\n\nIn July 2019, all business with the exception of music publishing and write management was transferred to the parent company Pony Canyon. The company name was then changed to \"Exit Music Publishing\".\n\nAssociated Brands/Label\n\nQUAKE RECORDS\n\nQUAKE RECORDS OTHER'S\n\nEXIT TUNES - Current name of the label\n\nEXIT TUNES OTHER'S\n\nEXIT BEATS\n\nGENERATOR TUNES\n\nDECIBEL ENTERTAINMENT\n\nSUB LICENCE\n\nVocaloid Producers Signed With EXIT TUNES\n\nArtist Name Member Since\n\nデッドボールP 2009, 2014\n\nラマーズP 2009\n\nazuma 2009\n\n164 2009 - 現在\n\n40mP 2010 - 2013\n\ncosMo@暴走P 2010 - 2015\n\nmothy_悪ノP 2010\n\nDios/シグナルP 2011\n\n蝶々P 2011 - 2014\n\notetsu 2012\n\ndaniwellP 2012\n\nYM 2012 - 2014\n\nSCL Project 2012\n\nゆちゃP 2012\n\nNem 2012 - 2015\n\nCLΦSH 2012\n\nピノキオP 2012\n\nひとしずく×やま△ 2012\n\nNeru 2013\n\nみきとP 2013 - 2015\n\nうたたP 2013\n\nジミーサムP 2013～2014\n\nトラボルタ 2013\n\nLast Note. 2013\n\nkeeno 2013\n\n亜沙 2013 - Present\n\nbuzzG 2013\n\nふわりP 2014\n\nラムネ (村人P) 2014\n\nじっぷす 2014 - 2015\n\nWONDERFUL★OPPORTUNITY! 2015\n\nかいりきベア 2015\n\nLinks"
