        "text": "All girl rock unit, saba sister, have announced their major debut under Pony Canyon with the upcoming release of their first full length album, ‘Decide Your Resolution!’ on March 8th. Simultaneously, the trio also revealed that they have signed a management contract with PIZZA OF DEATH, the label founded by punk legend Ken Yokoyama.\n\nThe news was unveiled through a video titled “Emergency Special Report from saba sister!!”. Reminiscent of a movie trailer, the video features Ken Yokoyama, who rescues the rock up-and-comers from a dodgy record deal.\n\nFormed in March 2022, saba sister rapidly gained attention in the domestic band scene. Within just two years, they were making appearances at major festivals, including a slot at the 4-day year-end event COUNTDOWN JAPAN 23/24 in Tokyo.\n\nThe album, aptly set to release on Saba (Mackerel) Day, will be backed by saba sister’s self-planned event, ‘Saba Fest Vol.2’, at Shibuya WWW on the same day.\n\nIn a comment about the announcement, frontwoman Nachi expressed her feelings about their journey so far and what lies ahead.\n\n“I am grateful to everyone – the agency, the label, the members, the audience, family, and those who have believed in what I love – for coming this far. With gratitude for everything and determination in my heart, I will take a new step forward! Please watch over us!”\n\nNachi (Vo/Gt)"
