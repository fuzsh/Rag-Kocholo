        "text": "The stars aligned and we came to run a lovely guest ranch in the Chiricahua mountains of southeastern Arizona some years ago.\n\nNo sooner had we completed our contract to open the luxury Lodge and Spa at Primland in Meadows of Dan, Virginia than my wife Susan said, “I’m ready for adventure!” It was then that the owner of Sunglow Ranch called to invite us to visit.\n\nFlying into Tucson we set out in our rental car down I-10 east when about two hours later we passed the outpost towns of Sunsites and Pearce. Soon after, leaving the pavement behind we drove another 7 miles down Turkey Creek Road (think dirt, dust, and rocks) to reach Sunglow Ranch–a remote and beguiling setting in the ancient Turkey Creek caldera of a long extinct volcano. Here Mexican, Chokonen Apache, and finally Europeans fought over precious water, land, and stagecoach routes through native Apache homeland.\n\nIt was about then Susan uttered the memorable retort, “There had better be a miracle at the end of this road.” We had long ago passed the sign that said, “No Services beyond this point.”\n\nIn some ways it was a miracle, even more so today as we look back and recall this sublime adventure in our lives. Our mailbox was 28 miles away past the Border Control checkpoint at the post office in Sunsites. Evading diamondback and Mojave rattlesnakes required daily vigilance although we came to love this sky island country where the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts meet. It is a truly remote area that is surprisingly rich in wildlife. Even jaguars and mountain lions were at home here along with coatimundi, javelina, scorpions, and tarantulas.\n\nWhen you live in places like this, you soon learn the importance of arranging for visiting musicians and performers for our guests–as they became our musical interludes as well. One such musician, Joel Eliot, would drive up from Sierra Vista, Arizona to play for us. It was here at Sunglow Ranch that Joel performed and introduced us to Cowboy Music.\n\nNow whenever we tell someone we love Cowboy Music, they will invariably agree they enjoy country music too. We try to explain the difference only to have the other person glaze over. If you are interested, it might be best to begin by listening to some of the old timers like Stan Jones or enjoy the music of Ian Tyson to understand what this means.\n\nWestern music was influenced by the folk music traditions of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland and cowboy songs sung around campfires in the 19th century such as Streets of Laredo. Otto Gray, an early Cowboy singer, felt that authentic western music had only three rhythms each derived from the gaits of the cow pony: walk, jog, and lope.\n\nAs a cowboy singer, Joel Eliot came to perform several times for us and each time he revealed new Cowboy songs and poetry. Through Joel, we came to know the music of other beloved Cowboy singers like Ian Tyson, Rex Allen, Stan Jones, Tom Russell, Corb Lund, and Dave Stamey. We came to know beloved Cowboy poets like Baxter Black, Charles Badger Clark, and Waddie Mitchell to name only a very few. We have listened to sweet performances by Michael Moon, Ben Alexander, and Gary McMahan at ranches in Colorado.\n\nThis past week we traveled back to Wickenburg, Arizona to hear Dave Stamey perform to a packed house at the impressive Desert Caballeros Western Museum. Dave is a favorite of ours (the museum too) and while there we delighted in reconnecting with Joel Eliot who was serendipitously in attendance that evening. Many of the beloved songs by Dave Stamey speak to his growing up on the family ranch in Montana most reflect his earlier lives as wrangler, dude string cowboy, and mule packer.\n\nDave performed songs both heartfelt and humorous for the faithful including Montana, a paean to his birthplace and growing up on a cattle ranch in Yellowstone County near Billings including his new 40 below, and The Truck Song about the challenges of life in Montana; a new song Too Many Crows, the humorous Fishin’ for Chicken, expressed thankfulness for one’s dog in Good Dog; sweet Sharon Littlehawk (a remembrance of a Native American girl from his childhood); and The Vaquero Song—perhaps becoming Dave’s most well-known song and a nostalgic look back at the rancho era of the 1840s when vaqueros and cowboys rode the range.\n\ntodavía estoy aquí I am still herе\n\ntodavía estoy aquí my soul is dancing in the moonlight\n\nI mingle with each grain of sand in the land that is my birthright\n\nDave paid tribute to Stan Jones’ Cowpoke song written in 1951, the kind of songs from the TV western era that we grew up with back when we still thought places like Tombstone, Arizona were imaginary. Dave also performed sacred Cowboy music standards like El Paso written by Marty Robbins and Ghost Riders written by Stan Jones. He ended the evening with his inspiring Come Ride with Me (Susan’s favorite Dave Stamey song) followed by an encore of Night Riders Lament written by Jerry Jeff Walker.\n\nAh but they’ve never seen the Northern Lights\n\nThey’ve never seen a hawk on the wing\n\nThey’ve never spent spring on the Great Divide\n\nAnd they’ve never heard ole’ camp cookie sing\n\nThanks to Dave Stamey and others, we have come to know there is magic in the air when you combine authentic Cowboy music performed live on a beautiful evening while singing along–especially around a campfire out west. It was magic that evening at the Desert Caballeros Western Museum in Wickenburg.\n\nTodavia estoy a qui.\n\nby Brooks Bradbury / March 2024 BrooksLooks\n\nbrooks.bradbury@gmail.com\n\nhe was the greatest living hero\n\n‘ever came out ta Appalachia\n\nthey all knew his name there\n\nfrom Meada’s-a’-Dan\n\nto downtown Galax\n\nfrom Fancy Gap\n\n‘ta right back at ya\n\na girl there she got his number\n\nthen she became his wife\n\nshe said i ain’t saying nothin’\n\nbut this’ll be one hard life\n\nyou ain’t got hardly a dollar\n\nso’s it’s prit near clear to me\n\nsure’s hell yer from down in\n\nold chicken shit holler\n\nno one there’s got one damn dollar\n\nyou just gotta be from\n\nchicken shit holler\n\nand his life ensued\n\nhe got a job\n\nand he got screwed\n\nhe got a right real attitude\n\nthen he got plum downright rude\n\nbegan to feud, came unglued\n\nhe tried to make his fortune\n\nand he jest got all tripped up\n\nknocked down\n\nworn out, bashed in some\n\ngot lost on endless highways\n\nlet it all get under his skin\n\nhe had it up to here back then\n\nbut hey they had a few good days\n\nthen he would just move on\n\n’cause he didn’t like the bosses\n\ndidn’t like the rules\n\ncouldn’t face the losses\n\ndidn’t want to deal\n\nwith all them damn fools\n\nwhen his wife looked right at him\n\nand told him it to him straight\n\nshe said i ain’t saying nothin’\n\ni know you do it for the dollar\n\nbut it looks to me like\n\nyou’re headin’ back home ta\n\nold chicken shit holler\n\ni said i think you’re right\n\ntime to stand up and fight\n\ni ain’t going back to old chicken shit holler\n\neven if i’m down to my last dang dollar\n\nand he looked in the mirror\n\nsaid his boss was an f’in clown\n\nthings got a bit clearer\n\nhe wasn’t backin’ down\n\nthen he told it straight to his a-hole boss\n\nthat he was sick and tired\n\n‘yer the worst damn boss i’d run across!’\n\nhis boss said, ‘well, anyway, you’re fired’\n\nand our hero said, “Your Loss.”\n\nwhen he got home\n\nhis wife looked right at him\n\nand told him it to him straight\n\nshe said i ain’t saying nothin’\n\nbut screw the almighty dollar\n\nit looks to me like\n\nyou’re fixin’ to git yerself out of\n\nold chicken shit holler\n\nyou’re on your way out\n\nof old chicken shit holler\n\ni’ve done my time\n\ni ain’t no damn scholar\n\ngettin’ the hell out a’\n\nold chicken shit holler\n\nif i have to spend my last half-dollar\n\ngettin’ the hell out a’\n\nold chicken shit holler\n\nleave it behind\n\ni’m proud of my blue collar\n\nain’t a goin’ back ta\n\nold chicken shit holler\n\n© Copyright 2021 Brooks Bradbury / BrooksLooks / All Rights Reserved\n\nForty some years ago an odd paperback book, “Country Inns and Backroads” caught my attention in the college bookstore. It was a travel guide of sorts about authentic, independent inns being marketed by author Norman Simpson. How little did I know then how the book would influence my life’s trajectory leading to a career in independent hospitality.\n\nAfter our college graduation, lifelong friend Dan Hopkins and I took off on adventure thanks to a Greyhound bus special, “Go Anywhere in the USA for $50”. We purchased two tickets and boarded in snow-covered Syracuse, NY and endured countless bus changes, strange characters and endless highway until 72 hours later we recovered at the home of our mutual friend Rob Marks in La Mesa, California.\n\nReturning home a year later from our ‘working vacation’, it was long overdue time to find gainful employment. I finally read Simpson’s book and was intrigued by the inn and hotel properties Simpson wrote about. With a pile of rejection letters and zero job prospects I donned my best $99 suit, borrowed my parent’s car and drove two hours east down I-90 across New York state to the one property in the book nearest our upstate home, just over the line in Massachusetts.\n\nIncidentally, I wore the same navy-blue suit with my red, white and blue tie weeks earlier in interviews with the Central Intelligence Agency. That is another story, a path untaken.\n\nCrossing the threshold of an old inn that dated to 1773, I arrived at the venerable Red Lion Inn in Stockbridge, Massachusetts inquiring about a job–without any clue what a remarkable place this inn or the town would turn out to be. Centuries ago the Inn had been a remote stagecoach stop. It was and is now a bustling hostelry in this picturesque New England village.\n\nThanks to the inn’s manager and Red Lion Inn owners Senator Jack and Jane Fitzpatrick I was given a warm welcome. By the end of the day, I had passed muster. The Inn was very busy indeed and yes, they could use my help right away. Returning a few days later to begin work as a dining room host (whatever that meant!) I stayed for a while in a tiny staff room on the sultry, un-air-conditioned 4th floor of the inn. I promised the owners I would work very hard for my $4 per hour wage and thus began a career in hospitality on July 2, 1979 that continues today.\n\nI would soon learn that both Norman Rockwell and Norman Simpson called the village of Stockbridge their home. Norman Rockwell died the year prior to my arrival, and over the years I delighted in befriending Norman Simpson as a bon vivant marketer who told the story of authentic old American inns until his untimely death in 1986. Today,Select Registry lives on as the latest evolution of Simpson’s vision. Mrs. Molly Rockwell still lived across the street from the inn back then and her husband Norman’s spirit is still celebrated in the Berkshires and beyond.\n\nStockbridge is a rare community in the Berkshires, rich in history and continuing to attract writers, artists and performers as it has from its earliest days as a mission community serving the native Mahican tribe. Today, a few miles up the road in Lenox, the Boston Symphony Orchestra performs each summer at Tanglewood Music Center as it has since 1937. Many of the BSO musicians lodge at the Inn with the hallways filled with the sweet sounds of practiced instrumentals.\n\nYears later, I had begun to learn a few things and was by then well-versed in many aspects of the Inn’s operation. ‘Mrs. Fitz’ called me to her office one day in 1993 and offered me the Innkeeper & General Manager position. After working in every department of the inn, I felt as though I had pulled the sword from the stone. ‘Mrs. Fitz’ as we called her was an inspiration, a mentor and a powerful force.\n\nWhile there, I had the pleasure of being a part of the management team that re-opened sister hotel, Blantyre, in the early 1980’s. Later, as GM of the Red Lion Inn I led our team effort to open the Porches Inn at Mass MoCA in North Adams, Massachusetts.\n\nLeaving this Camelot experience years later, I felt as though I had ‘graduated’ and was ready for more of life’s lessons. My wife Susan and I embarked on a path that would lead us ever onward across the country. Before that, twenty-one exciting and wonderful years would pass there in Stockbridge until Jack and Jane retired.\n\nWe never looked back as our adventure in hospitality continued. Fast forward to today, and we happily call northern Colorado our home. This was preceded by a beautiful Kanab, Utah home and our other ‘homes’ in Stamford, Vermont; Stockbridge and Dalton, Massachusetts; Madison, Connecticut; Sheboygan, Wisconsin; Meadows of Dan, Virginia (where we opened the luxury Lodge and Spa at Primland); Pearce, Arizona; Waynesville, North Carolina and Clark, Colorado in about that order.\n\nIroquois, Mahican, Stockbridge, Hammonasset, Winnebago, the Eastern Band of Cherokee, Apache, Yampa Utes, Anasazi, Navajo and Paiute native peoples preceded us in all of these areas. Their spirits permeate the communities on our path.\n\nBerkshire, Blue Ridge, Great Smokies, the Colorado Rockies and Chiracahua mountains have all served as the beautiful backdrop of our lives along the way. The dramatic vermillion cliffs of southern Utah surrounded us for a time.\n\nThis charming village of Kanab (our 10th such home, and 17th move since our October 2000 wedding in Stamford, Vermont) provided a warm welcome to a growing yet remote southern Utah community of 4,500 residents with thousands more U.S. and international visitors arriving in season to explore national parks, extensive BLM lands and extraordinary state parks such as Coral Pink Sand Dunes.\n\nKanab and Kane County are centered among Zion, Bryce, Grand Staircase Escalante and Grand Canyon National Parks. World-class challenging hiking trails traverse the area. Kanab was originally settled by Anasazi, Ute and Kaibab Paiute followed later in 1864 when ten Latter-Day Saint families moved into the area finally establishing Kanab in 1870.\n\nNow a thriving small city, Kanab is growing with the arrivals of outliers like us and the discovery of Kanab as an up-and-coming destination. Kanab’s town fathers and commissioners work diligently to balance Kane County’s growing tourism business with residents’ quality of life all the while honoring Kanab’s history as Little Hollywood, once the setting of many classic western movies and television shows.\n\nOur many moves have resulted from the vagaries of a career in independent hospitality and working for a range of owners from beloved to indifferent whom we discovered would unfortunately retire and die, sell their real estate holdings, change their minds, endure the great recession, suffer from dementia, etc. In short, we experienced life with all its uncertainties and changes.\n\nExecutive hospitality recruiters have played an important role in our lives, enticing us to consider new properties and explore wonderful new horizons. I learned early on that these were some of our most important business relationships.\n\nMost of all I am grateful to my wife Susan and our petites Cotons de Tulears who have endured these many moves. Susan has faced the unenviable task of managing each move with all the resulting household changes and upheaval—all while re-inventing herself and finding a place in these new communities. This has been the most difficult aspect of moving, along with saying goodbye to new friends who have been so kind and helpful. We cherish our friends whom in spite of time and distance continue to keep in touch.\n\nAbove all, we found amazingly good and generous people wherever we went including our staff, our guests and our neighbors. We have discovered beautiful places, some that most American’s will never see. Out West, we have come to know what quiet really means. And we learned to count on each other through all of life’s vicissitudes. Susan is fond of saying that I seemed like a stable guy once, and ever since our first date at the grand opening of Mass MoCA on May 29, 1999 our lives together have been a wild and beautiful ride.\n\nWe had the pleasure of representing Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab. Its founders had a vision years ago of saving the lives of animals with a mission to bring about a time when there are no more homeless pets. It is a joy, and a responsibility that we support their work to end the suffering and killing of animals in shelters all across the country by the year 2025.\n\nNone of us ever gets where we are without the help of others. To explore this extraordinary country has been our great privilege and we remember all those who sacrificed for us, our parents who raised us, our families who have given so much to us, our neighbors who have sustained us, the communities who have welcomed us, and the owners who have challenged us.\n\nWe have made a career in the work of managing, opening, marketing and growing private clubs, guest ranches, lodges and inns since those precious first years in Stockbridge.\n\nWe treasure the vendors, suppliers and consultants who have supported our work, and the guests and colleagues whom we have come to know and serve. It is all of you and especially my parents who have taught me the lessons of graciousness and service.\n\nTime flies when you’re having fun.\n\n© Copyright 2019 Brooks Bradbury / BrooksLooks"
