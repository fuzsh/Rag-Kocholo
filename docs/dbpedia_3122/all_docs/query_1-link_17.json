        "text": "A four-piece reggae-punk band from Shonan, Japan.\n\nTheir sound freely mixes hardcore punk, new metal, reggae, and ska music with a unique pop sense, and their lyrics are aggressive and rebellious, but also skillfully incorporate wordplay and quirky hook lines.\n\nMAH has a unique appearance and charisma that has earned him the nickname “the devil” from fans and other artists for his ability to instantly win the hearts and minds of the audience with his outstanding centripetal force, and SHOW-HATE wields his instrument with unparalleled precision and moves around the stage, The combination of SIN’s stringed instruments and GODRi’s drumming, which supports the backbone of the band with its thick, tight groove and chorus work, makes for an explosive live performance that is nothing short of spectacular.\n\nAccording to MAH, the band was “born in a live house, grew up in a live house, and will die in a live house.\n\nThey have sold out big-box solo shows at Nippon Budokan and Yokohama Arena, hosted the 20,000-person outdoor festival “DEAD POP FESTiVAL,” and headlined major outdoor rock festivals across the country, and have risen to the position of “destroying the rock scene from within,” both in name and reality. SiM has risen to the top of the rock scene in both name and reality, “destroying it from the inside out”.\n\nThey have established themselves as a live band after overcoming numerous challenges, such as numerous member changes, serious illnesses, and dismissals from their label, and they no longer have any blind spots."
