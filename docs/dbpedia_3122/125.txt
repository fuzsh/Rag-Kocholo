Queen Mary University Of London researcher Madeline Hamilton has found that vocal arrangements in popular music have become simpler since 1950. Her study, published in Scientific Reports, analysed over 1000 pop songs to track changes in melodic complexity. In one example, Hamilton contrasts Joe Stafford’s rhythmically free 1952 hit ‘You Belong To Me’ with Lady Gaga’s 2008 song ‘Poker Face’, which features a simpler vocal melody. “Pop songs today have so many layers, there’s so many different textures of sounds”, Hamilton notes, suggesting that simpler melodies may compensate for more complex instrumental arrangements in modern productions.
