On the May 29 episode of ALL MY CHILDREN, the media frenzy over Erica Kane and Jackson Montgomery’s divorce continued with an interview on the real-life THE MORNING SHOW WITH MIKE & JULIET. Co-hosts Mike Jerrick and Juliet Huddy played themselves, speaking with Erica and Jack about what could easily become Erica’s 10th divorce. Here is their report:

Soap Opera Weekly: How did you like memorizing all those lines?

Juliet Huddy: I had no idea we were going to have so many lines; we thought it was going to be maybe a couple. Before the show, our assistant handed us these giant books of scripts. So we cheated. We put our lines on our blue cards like we do on our show. We basically cheated our way through. Susan Lucci has 9,000 hours of lines that she has to memorize, and we’re sitting there looking at our little blue cards.

Mike Jerrick: We were both very impressed with the actors and how many lines they learn so rapidly. You can tell that they’re savvy veterans.

Weekly: What was your favorite part of the shoot?

Huddy: At the end of each scene they always end on one shot, and Susan Lucci has to just stare into space; it goes on for, like, three minutes! I’m like, “How do you keep a straight face?”

Jerrick: I kept offering to take my shirt off like they do in soap operas, but they didn’t want any of that. And I kept trying to lean in and kiss Susan, but she didn’t want any part of that, either.

Weekly: Are you ALL MY CHILDREN watchers?

Huddy: I was a big watcher while I was in high school and college.

Weekly: What do you think will become of Erica and Jack?

Huddy: Jack will probably continue to beg her to stay married, but Erica will dump him for Mike Jerrick. Then we will announce to Erica Kane that Mike cannot marry her, because Mike has secretly been in love with me all these years.
