        "text": "Even though it has been almost a decade since All My Children aired its last televised episode, “The Queen of Daytime” Susan Lucci continues to bring heart-pounding suspense to the world, but not always in the way you might think.\n\n“Two and a half years ago, I actually was very, very surprised to have a heart incident myself,” Lucci tells Forbes. “ I had always been very healthy. I really never had any health issues, I am happy to say. I was shopping at a boutique for a birthday present for my friend and I felt something I could not ignore. I felt like an elephant was pressing on my chest and it was radiating on my rib cage to my back. I sat down on a bench, while they wrapping the birthday present. The manager came over to me whom I've known for many years. She said My car is parked right outside. Why don't I drive you to St. Francis? That's the heart hospital, one of the top in the country. It happened to be just a mile down the road. I was so lucky in so many ways.”\n\nAccording to Lucci, once she got to the emergency room, her symptoms had gone away but the doctor still recommended some tests. It turns out that Lucci had 90% blockage in her main artery to her heart and 75% blockage in an adjacent artery. The 74-year-old actress went into emergency surgery that night, receiving two stents into her arteries, which increased blood flow back to her heart. She was released from the hospital by noon the next day and was back up on-stage performing just two days after that. “I called the doctor and he said If you feel you can do it, do it,” Lucci recalls.\n\nSurely for many All My Children fans, Lucci’s strength and tenacity to continue to persevere shows several parallels to her iconic television character “Erica Kane.” From 1970 to 2011, Lucci played the head-turning star of the hit daytime series. “She's a modern woman created by a woman ahead of her time, [show creator] Agnes Nixon,” says Lucci. “Maybe there is a little bit of ‘Erica’ in everyone, man or woman. So many people would stop me and say I'm at a crossroads in my life and should I do this, can I continue? And I would think to myself, What would ‘Erica Kane’ do? It was so wonderful to hear this because ‘Erica’ was the bad girl in town, the naughty girl in town, but people loved her spirit, her spunk, her determination.”\n\nOn May 21, 1999, after 19 Emmy nominations for her performance as “Erica Kane,” Lucci finally took home the Emmy, as the crowed roared for minutes on end to savor this well-deserved and long-awaited moment. Lucci says in many ways, that special night does feel like it was just yesterday. Now almost 22 years later, where does Lucci keep her Emmy? “The Emmy is on the mantle in the living room, center stage up there.”\n\nBeyond her recent heart complication, Lucci has in fact protected her heart for many decades, both on-screen and off. “Erica Kane” was known for marrying several men throughout her years on All My Children (some more than once), but one such husband does standout for Lucci from the rest. “I think the one fans saw the most of and certainly the writing reflected that was the ‘Erica and Jack’ relationship. ‘Erica’ could not seem to walk away from him.” Though “Erica” spent years looking for the right man, Lucci has been happily married to her husband Helmut Huber going on 52 years. “Time has gone really, really quickly. My instincts turned out to be good ones. Helmut is ten years older than I am. We married because we love each other and we got lucky. How fantastic to be in love with the man I married.”\n\nNow if you believe you have seen the last of Lucci as “Erica Kane,” you may want to think again. There have been talks of a new primetime series being developed titled Pine Valley, which is the name of the fictional town All My Children was set in. Lucci’s friends and former AMC colleagues Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos are said to be attached as producers to the project. When asked if fans will see “Erica Kane” live on another day, Lucci replies, “I certainly would welcome playing this amazing part of ‘Erica Kane’ again. Wonderful to have the opportunity to work with Kelly and Mark again. You know, it looks like it's going to happen.”"
