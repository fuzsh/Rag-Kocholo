        "text": "You always remember where you were when you heard truly devastating news. Depending on your generation, that could mean when JFK was assassinated, when the Challenger blew up or, if you're as shallow as I am, when you learned that \"All My Children\" had been canceled.\n\nI remember it like it was last week, mostly because it was. Although I haven't watched the show in a while (my loyalty to \"Days of Our Lives\" is well-documented), I have warm memories of Erica & Co., whose tormented lives I followed along with all the womenfolk in my family back in the day. True story: In high school, I forged a note that read:\n\n\"Please excuse my daughter from school on Thursday so that she may witness the marriage of Miss Erica Kane and Mr. Jeffrey Martin. I know that it will be a stunning affair and I'm certain you would not want her to miss it.\"\n\nBecause I live in the South, it was naturally considered an excused absence. No one can say we don't have our priorities straight. As my elderly aunt commented at the time, \"God ain't making no more land.\"\n\nNo, no. That was Tony Soprano quoting a real estate friend. What I meant to say was, \"You've got the rest of your life to learn geometry. Erica will only get married once!\" And this aunt was considered the brains in the family.\n\nAs anyone knows, Erica went on to marry 11 more times, sometimes to the same man, sometimes committing accidental bigamy (It's a long story.) The point is that through it all, she remained fabulous.\n\nSo when ABC announced it was killing off \"All My Children\" after 41 years and \"One Life to Live\" after 43 years, you can imagine that loyal fans went a little nuts. Which I totally get because the only way you'll take \"Days of Our Lives\" off Season Pass is to pry the Tivo from my cold, dead hands.\n\nI feel for the fans because I believe \"DOOL\" could be next and this fear propels me into a dark room with a quart of Gifford's butter pecan for comfort.\n\nScanning some of the blistering emails from fans to ABC revealed equal amounts raw emotional pain and really atrocious spelling. Perhaps the saddest was from a woman amputee who appeared to be comparing the loss of her leg to losing \"All My Children.\" Which, by the way, I totally get. We spend decades following the lives of these vapid, philandering, meddlesome, mysterious, loving, big-hearted characters. Duh Hubby has often looked up from reading Proust or \"Baseball Weekly\" to ask me if I'm \"still watching that drivel\" (meaning DOOL!) to which I just tell him that he didn't grow up watching his \"stories\" with mamas and grandmamas and can't possibly imagine the connection they supply with the dear departed.\n\nOh, Erica, although I forsook Pine Valley for Salem many years ago, I never forgot you. And I never will."
