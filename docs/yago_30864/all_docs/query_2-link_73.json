        "text": "Ah, yes: I remember it well.\n\n“Erica Kane” in large rollers — but in perfect makeup, of course — walking up backstage and saying, so sweetly: “I hear we’re doing a scene together.”\n\nHilarious, really. As if “doing a scene” meant actually acting together. Or actually acting.\n\nThis was one of those first-person reporter things we get to do once in a while. For some, it’s jumping from a plane, playing rodeo clown, appearing as Mother Ginger in “The Nutcracker.”\n\nFor me in the late ’80s, it was one day on the set of a soap. And the chance to say this in front of more than a million viewers: “Where’s that hunky bartender?”\n\nEven then, no one said “hunky” with any conviction. Talk about an acting challenge.\n\nBut that slice of the thespian life served as the day’s opening tease for “All My Children,” an ABC stalwart serial. Our “scene” together was me in the background of the club when Erica and one of her herd of husbands decided what to name their newborn daughter, Bianca. Who now, in a tribute to how soaps deal with aging stars, may be older than her mother.\n\nThat was then, when soaps were king. Still in the glow of the ratings-grabbing Luke & Laura wedding, weekly summaries and soap-themed magazines were hot. Not anymore.\n\nAs fervent fans know, Erica & Co. will call it a day on Friday after 42 years on the air. Sister soap, “One Life to Live,” departs in January. That leaves four soaps in daytime, which once presented a dozen daily serials.\n\nLike so many, I become hooked for a short time while in college and especially during summer’s gaps in schedules. Some students would schedule classes around their favorites, so never to miss their beloved “AMC” or “Days of Our Lives.”\n\nA precursor to reality\n\nThese were family dramas in a soup of sex, illness and greed, usually focused on one or two power clans. The rich folks were surrounded by an array of wannabes, those struggling to cross the tracks into wealth and comfort. These days, we call it “reality TV.”\n\nNot that anyone worked too hard to get ahead. My, these folks had a lot of free time. Hours to “stop by” to see how people are doing since Alex/Heather/Endorah dumped Lindsay/Chad/Wolfman Jack. Or revealed little Billy’s paternity.\n\nThe formula — stay tuned next time for more snail’s-paced action — worked for decades. Actors and writers, some better than others, toiled to deliver a soap-company supported daily product.\n\nCharacters with names such as Lance and Ridge, and some of the best villainy you’ll ever encounter, kept viewers hooked. But viewers have gone now, distracted by life’s other choices.\n\nTalk is that “AMC” and “OLTL” will appear online. Maybe. Susan Lucci, who has played the much-married Erica Kane since the show debuted 42 years ago, has rejected an offer to continue.\n\nSo, goodbye to that, now replaced with gals gabbing and judges and doctors and not quite enough “Law & Order” reruns. (“The Chew” replaces “AMC.”)\n\nAn era that begin with radio — Grandma was a huge fan — moved to TV and held on for generations is ending. Too expensive, smaller audience.\n\nRegis is leaving daytime too. What will life be without Philbin? Those still stinging at the loss of Oprah — or even the long ago king of intelligent talk, Phil Donahue — know we’ll survive.\n\nHow? Tune in tomorrow."
