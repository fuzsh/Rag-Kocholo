        "text": "Soap operas are no strangers to disaster: the wedding day tornado that collapsed a rectory and temporarily rendered one guest blind on One Life to Live; the earthquake that triggered a tsunami in Passions; the catastrophic casino collapse of The Young and the Restless; General Hospital’s hotel fire; the other tornadoes on All My Children. But even television’s most melodramatic genre was not prepared for coronavirus—which halted production and caused some of daytime’s few remaining soaps, including The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, to run out of episodes late last month. The timing for this soap shortage could not be worse; the world, grappling with a very real pandemic and very restrictive stay-at-home orders, craves the kind of reliable, escapist comfort that soap operas provide.\n\nWhich is why Susan Lucci, the Emmy-winning All My Children veteran and doyenne of daytime drama, is glad to give viewers a one-time soap fix Tuesday evening with The Story of Soaps, ABC’s two-hour homage to the genre.\n\n“It’s funny how things work,” Lucci said last week about the special, in which she appears alongside Alec Baldwin, Carol Burnett, Andy Cohen, Jon Hamm, Vivica A. Fox, and others. “This show has been in the works for a little while, but to air it now is perfect because people—at least the people who talk to me and follow on Instagram—they all want this. They want to see us.” Soaps are essential to their fans, like one male viewer who approached Lucci a few years back at a book signing. “He said to me, ‘Susan, they tell us that cotton is the fabric of our lives. But really, it’s All My Children.”\n\nIn addition to providing daily solace, soap operas have long been ahead of the curve in terms of tackling timely social and political themes—which Tuesday’s special reminds audiences. In her conversation with Vanity Fair, Lucci said she still feels profoundly indebted to Agnes Nixon, the late, great creator behind One Life to Live and All My Children, who was among the first to script hot-button issues like child abuse, AIDS, abortion, and narcotics into her story lines.\n\n“I was very lucky to work with Agnes Nixon and to be in her hands as a storyteller, and to be the actress she chose to tell so many stories through,” said Lucci, referring to her iconic character, Erica Kane. “The best kind of storytelling reflects the culture…We would see story lines and then maybe six months into telling this particular story, it would suddenly be in the headlines. One example I think of is adopted children looking for their biological parents. There was same-sex marriage. There was the LGBTQ community—Bianca, Erica’s daughter, coming out to her at a time when a lot of kids who were teenagers or in their 20s who were gay were afraid to come out to their parents, because they were afraid their parents wouldn’t love them. And because we were in people’s homes five days a week for an hour a day, there was the opportunity to tell those stories in a nuanced way from every character’s point of view.”\n\nThe #MeToo movement has shed light on power imbalances, particularly in Hollywood. But soap operas are one entertainment realm where women have long been in positions of power—dating back to 1968, when Nixon premiered One Life to Live. By the time Lucci appeared on All My Children in 1970, the actor said she “never got a feeling of prejudice against women.”\n\n“Our first executive producer was a woman. Doris Quinlan, Felicia Behr, Jean Dadario Burke, and so on and so forth, ending with Julie Carruthers—they were all women. Lucky me, I got to play a character who—as a result of a very strong, visionary woman—was a strong female herself. Was All My Children a place for really talented women in that field to shine? Yeah.”\n\nIn Lucci’s estimation, soaps are something of a universal language. Under normal, non-quarantined conditions, she continues to be stopped by “men and women, lawyers, doctors, athletes, whatever. It never was unusual for me to be stopped by a 10-year-old boy as well as a ballplayer.” Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to, as Lucci said, “come out” as a soap opera fan. “It was not always considered cool to be a fan,” she admitted, adding that soaps—like any entertainment genre—can be of varying quality. “Not all soaps are created equal, so I don’t pretend that they are.” (Burnett, however, was not the only celebrity soap fan: Bette Davis and Judy Garland were reportedly hooked on the shows too. Elizabeth Taylor was such a General Hospital devotee that she agreed to be cast in a 1981 episode featuring Luke and Laura’s wedding.) Lucci has also heard from fans before they became famous—like a teenage Andy Cohen. Decades before becoming a Bravo executive and television host, Cohen wrote Lucci such an articulate, impassioned letter that the soap star agreed to meet him, sight unseen, for lunch at Manhattan Mexican restaurant Santa Fe.\n\n“He wrote me a wonderful letter asking if he could interview me,” said Lucci, who added that Cohen joined her and her publicist for lunch at the Upper West Side spot. Both Cohen and Lucci have copies of the photo from that meeting. “It was the ’80s, and both of us had hair so big, I don’t know how we fit in the same photo.”\n\nLucci is hopeful that the program airing Tuesday will serve as a temporary distraction from the pandemic—and a news cycle that has become so fast-paced it makes soap opera story lines seem sluggish in comparison. When asked whether she sees any soap-esque elements in the current news cycle, Lucci grew thoughtful: “Well, not necessarily the news cycle,” she said. “But depending on who is speaking.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— The Week the Cameras Stopped: TV in the COVID-19 Era\n\n— Why Natalie Wood’s Daughter Is Confronting Robert Wagner About Wood’s Death\n\n— Inside Rock Hudson’s Real-Life Relationship With Agent Henry Wilson\n\n— How The Mandalorian F\n\nought to Keep Baby Yoda From Being Too Cute\n\n— A First Look at Charlize Theron’s Immortal Warrior in The Old Guard\n\n— Back to the Future, Uncut Gems, and More New Titles on Netflix This Month\n\n— From the Archive: How Rock Hudson and Doris Day Helped Define the Romantic Comedy"
