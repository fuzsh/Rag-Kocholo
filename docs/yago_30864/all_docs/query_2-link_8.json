        "text": "American actress (born 1946)\n\nSusan Victoria Lucci (born December 23, 1946)[1] is an American actress. She is best known for portraying Erica Kane on the ABC daytime drama All My Children during that show's entire network run from 1970 to 2011. The character is considered an icon,[2][3][4][5] and she was called \"Daytime's Leading Lady\" by TV Guide, with The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times citing her as the highest-paid actor in daytime television.[6][7] As early as 1991, her salary had been reported as over $1 million a year.[6][7] During her run on All My Children, Lucci was nominated 21 times for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She won only once, in 1999, after the 19th nomination; her status as a perpetual nominee for the award had attracted significant media attention since the late 1980s.[6]\n\nLucci has also acted in other TV series, as well as occasionally in film and on stage. She had multi-episode guest appearances on the series Dallas, Hot in Cleveland and Army Wives. Lucci hosted Saturday Night Live in 1990. After the cancellation of All My Children, she hosted the 2012-2014 true crime series Deadly Affairs and starred (as Genevieve Delatour) in the 2013–2016 Lifetime series Devious Maids.[8][9][10]\n\nIn 1996, TV Guide ranked her number 37 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.[11] She was named one of VH1's 200 Top Icons of All Time and one of Barbara Walters's Ten Most Fascinating People.[12]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nSusan Lucci was born in Scarsdale, New York, to parents Jeanette (1917-2021) and Victor Lucci (1919-2002).[1] Her father was of Italian ancestry, and her mother was of Swedish descent.[13][14] She lived in Yonkers, New York, before moving with her family at age 2 to Elmont, New York, and then at age 5 to another Long Island town, Garden City, New York.[15] Lucci graduated from Garden City High School in 1964 and from Marymount College, Tarrytown in 1968, with a BA degree in drama.[16]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nSusan Lucci began her television career with bit parts on the daytime soap operas Love Is a Many Splendored Thing and The Doctors. She also appeared in an uncredited role in the 1969 film Goodbye, Columbus and had a minor role in the 1969 comedy-drama Me, Natalie.\n\nAll My Children\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: All My Children\n\nLucci is best known for appearing as Erica Kane on the ABC soap opera All My Children, from January 16, 1970, to September 23, 2011. Erica is considered to be the most popular character in American soap opera history.[17] TV Guide calls her \"unequivocally the most famous soap opera character in the history of daytime TV,\"[6] and included her in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.[18]\n\nLucci was nominated for the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series Emmy for her work on All My Children almost every year beginning in 1978. When Lucci did not win the award after several consecutive nominations, her image in the media began to be lampooned, as she became notoriously synonymous with never winning an Emmy. NBC's Saturday Night Live exploited this by asking her to host an episode; during her monologue, the show's cast, crew, and even stagehands nonchalantly carried (and utilized; for example, as hammers and doorjambs) Emmys of their own in her presence. In addition, she appeared in a 1989 television commercial for the sugar substitute Sweet One, intended to portray her as the opposite of her villainess character, yet throwing one of Erica Kane's characteristic tantrums, shouting, \"Eleven years without an Emmy! What does a person have to do around here to get an Emmy?\" Her name eventually became part of the language, used as an avatar for artists who receive numerous award nominations without a win (e.g., \"Peter O'Toole was the Susan Lucci of the Oscars.\").\n\nAfter 18 nominations, she finally won in 1999; Lucci received a standing ovation upon receiving the award, which was presented by Shemar Moore.[19][20]\n\nWhen ABC cancelled All My Children on April 14, 2011, after 41 years on the air,[21] Lucci said in an interview: \"It's been a fantastic journey. I've loved playing Erica Kane and working with Agnes Nixon and all the incredible people involved with All My Children. I'm looking forward to all kinds of new and exciting opportunities.\"[21] Lucci publicly criticized ABC Daytime president Brian Frons over the cancellation of All My Children in the epilogue of her autobiography All My Life.[22]\n\nPrimetime television, stage, hosting and film\n\n[edit]\n\nLucci has appeared in a number of television series and television movies. In 1982, she appeared in a cameo appearance in the comedy film Young Doctors in Love. During the 1980s, she made guest-starring appearances in prime time series, such as The Love Boat, Fantasy Island and The Fall Guy. In 1984 she played her first leading role in the supernatural horror film Invitation to Hell directed by Wes Craven.[23]\n\nIn 1986, Lucci played the role of Darya Romanoff in the Golden Globe– and Emmy Award–winning made-for-television movie Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna. The same year she played the lead role as Antoinette Giancana, Salavatore 'Sam' Giancana's daughter's in the crime made-for-television movie, Mafia Princess. The following year she starred in the another horror film, Haunted by Her Past.[24] She later starred in the crime dramas Lady Mobster (1988) and The Bride in Black (1990). In 1990–1991, she began a series of guest spots on the nighttime soap opera Dallas.[25] She hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live in October of that year; in one skit, she appeared as Erica Kane competing on a game show.[26] In 1991 she starred in the thriller The Woman Who Sinned.[27] She later starred in Double Edge (1992), Between Love and Hate (1993), French Silk (1994) and Seduced and Betrayed (1995).\n\nIn 1995, Lucci played Elizabeth 'Ebbie' Scrooge in the Lifetime Fantasy television film, Ebbie. This film was an updated version of A Christmas Carol. Lucci played a Scrooge-like department store owner visited by Marley and the three ghosts on Christmas.Television critic Lynne Heffley from Los Angeles Times gave it a positive review writing: \"Soap queen Susan Lucci of “All My Children” is fun to watch as a severely tailored, unsmiling boss, spreading misery wherever she goes on Christmas Eve, whether firing a security guard or deciding the store’s traditional window display has got to go.\"[28] In 1998 she returned to thrillers with Blood on Her Hands.\n\nIn 1999, she played the title role of Annie Oakley in the revival of Irving Berlin's musical Annie Get Your Gun. Michael Logan of TV Guide said, \"Susan Lucci didn't just take Great White Way by storm: she took it by tornado, hurricane and tsunami, too.\"[29] In 2004, she guest starred in two episodes of the ABC comedy series Hope & Faith opposite Kelly Ripa. In 2005 she guest-starred on That's So Raven.\n\nLucci competed in season 7 of Dancing with the Stars with dance partner Tony Dovolani. She said that Dancing had asked her to appear before, but she had turned it down, in part, because of the travel it would have required of her (at the time Dancing taped in Los Angeles while All My Children taped in New York). Lucci later changed her mind, in part, because of the experience of fellow All My Children star Cameron Mathison, who finished fifth in season 5.[30] She was voted off the show on November 5, 2008, rather than November 4 due to election night, finishing sixth in the competition.\n\n2012—present\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Lucci made several appearances as herself, the arch rival of Wendie Malick's character, Victoria Chase, on the TV Land sitcom Hot in Cleveland , including the February 1, 2012 episode entitled \"Life with Lucci\".[31] She appeared in Gloria Estefan's music video \"Hotel Nacional\" in February 2012.[32] She guest starred in multi-episodes of the sixth season of Lifetime drama series, Army Wives in 2012.[33][34] Lucci also hosted and narrated Deadly Affairs, a prime-time series airing on Investigation Discovery from 2012 to 2014.[35] On November 15, 2012, Lucci appeared on The Colbert Report in a segment reflecting the soap-opera-like nature of the Petraeus scandal.\n\nIn 2013, Lucci began starring as Geneviève Delatour in the Lifetime comedy-drama series, Devious Maids created by Marc Cherry.[36][37][38] Her comedic performance was well-received by television critics.[39][40] The series ended in 2016 after four seasons. In 2015 she appeared in the comedy-drama film, Joy directed by David O. Russell.[41]\n\nIn 2017, Lucci played one of Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard's grandparents (with Henry Winkler) in Sia's music video, \"Santa's Coming for Us\".[42] Also in 2017 she guest-starred in an episode of Hulu comedy series, Difficult People. She also appeared in television ads for Progressive Insurance that were styled as a soap opera.\n\nIn 2023, Lucci received Lifetime Achievement Award at the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards.[43] In 2024, after seven years acting hiatus, Lucci returned to screen in the black comedy film, Outcome starring opposite Keanu Reeves,Jonah Hill and Cameron Diaz. [44]\n\nBusiness ventures\n\n[edit]\n\nLucci also has her own line of hair care products, perfumes, lingerie and skin care, called The Susan Lucci Collection.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLucci married Austrian-born chef and food-service manager Helmut Huber on September 13, 1969.[45] They are the parents of two children: actress Liza Huber and a son, Andreas Huber.[1] The couple were married 52 years until Helmut's death on March 28, 2022; he was 84 years old.[46]\n\nLucci's autobiography, All My Life: A Memoir, was published in 2011.[47] She is a registered Republican and has hosted fundraising events for Rudy Giuliani.[48] She is a supporter of LGBT rights and equality, her support spurred by an All My Children storyline in 2000 in which her character Erica's daughter, Bianca Montgomery, came out as a lesbian.[48]\n\nIn late 2018, Lucci had an emergency procedure to place two arterial stents in her heart after blocked arteries were discovered due to chest pain. Lucci postponed making her experience public until shortly before the American Heart Association's annual Go Red for Women fashion event in February 2019.[49]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1969 Goodbye, Columbus Wedding Guest Uncredited 1969 Love Is a Many Splendored Thing Bit role Uncredited 1969 Me, Natalie Cheerleader 1969 The Doctors Outpatient Day Player Uncredited 1970–2011 All My Children Erica Kane\n\nJane Campbell Lead role 1982 The Love Boat Paula Hastings Episode: \"The Groupies/The Audition/Doc's Nephew\" 1982 Young Doctors in Love Herself 1983 Fantasy Island Gina Edwards Episode: \"The Songwriter/Queen of the Soaps\" 1984 Invitation to Hell Jessica Jones 1984 The Fall Guy Veronica Remy Episode: \"Stranger Than Fiction\" 1986 Mafia Princess Antoinette Giancana 1986 Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna Darya Romanoff 1987 Haunted by Her Past or Secret Passions Karen Beckett 1988 Lady Mobster Laurel Castle [50] 1990 The Bride in Black Rose D'Amore-Malloy 1990 Saturday Night Live Herself – Host/Various Episode: \"Susan Lucci/Hothouse Flowers\" 1990–1991 Dallas Hillary Taylor/Faux Sheila Foley Special guest star, 6 episodes 1991 The Woman Who Sinned Victoria Robeson 1992 Double Edge Maggie Dutton/Carmen Moore 1993 Between Love and Hate Vivian Conrad 1994 French Silk Claire Laurent 1995 Ebbie Elizabeth 'Ebbie' Scrooge 1995 Seduced and Betrayed Victoria Landers 1998 Blood on Her Hands Isabelle Collins 2002 Between the Lions Herself 2 episodes 2004 Hope & Faith Jacqueline Karr Episodes: \"Daytime Emmys: Part 1\" and \"Daytime Emmys: Part 2\" 2005 That's So Raven Miss Charlotte Romano Episode: \"The Big Buzz\" 2010–2014[51] Hot in Cleveland Susan Lucci Special guest star, 5 episodes[52] 2012 Army Wives Audrey Whitaker 3 episodes 2012–2014 Deadly Affairs Herself – Host Documentary series 2013–2016 Devious Maids Genevieve Delatour Series regular 2015 Joy Danica[53] 2017 Difficult People Shelley Waxman Episode: \"Cindarestylox\" 2018 Ralph Breaks the Internet (voice) 2023 Generation Gap Herself Episode: \"What Kid Doesn't Love Stew?\" TBA Outcome Filming\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nDaytime Emmy Awards Year Category Work Result Ref Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Nominated Won Nominated Nominated\n\nSoap Opera Digest Awards Year Category Work Result Ref Outstanding Contribution by an Actor/Actress to the Form of Continuing Drama who is currently on a Daytime Serial\n\nAll My Children\n\nNominated Editor's Choice – Daytime Won Favorite Super Couple: Daytime (shared with Larkin Malloy) Nominated Best Love Story: Daytime or Prime Time (shared with Walt Willey) Nominated Outstanding Lead Actress Won Soapnet Diamond Award Won Favorite Couple (shared with Walt Willey) Nominated\n\nOther awards and honors include:\n\nGolden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Henry Kravis, 1991[82]\n\nFavorite Female Performer in a Daytime Serial, People's Choice Awards, 1992[83]\n\nWomen in Film Lucy Award, 1994[84]\n\nNew York Women in Film & Television Muse Award, 2004[85]\n\nOutstanding Female Lead in a Daytime Drama, Gracie Allen Awards, 2005[86]\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame, 2005[87]\n\nNAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame, 2006\n\nRide of Fame inductee, 2013[88]\n\nDisney Legend, 2015\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nSiegel, Barbara, and Scott Siegel. 1986.
