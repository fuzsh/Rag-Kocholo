        "text": "Whether or not you’re a soap opera fan, you’re likely familiar with Susan Lucci. The actress, who played the powerful and self-centered yet charismatic Erica Kane on All My Children from 1970, the year the soap began, to its final episode in 2011, is synonymous with the genre.\n\nDuring the show’s impressive 41-year run, Lucci earned the title of the Queen of Soaps, and was infamously nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series 19 times before she finally won in 1999.\n\nPrior to starring in All My Children, Lucci had just a few bit parts to her name, and she was just 24 when she started playing the role that would, over the course of 1,633 episodes, define not only her career, but the popular conception of soap operas as a whole.\n\nHere’s a look back at Susan Lucci young, in her early days as daytime drama royalty.\n\nA ’70s headshot\n\nLucci looks lovely in this 1978 headshot, taken eight years into All My Children‘s run — but still early in her career.\n\nSweater girl\n\nLucci embraced ’80s style with an oversized sweater, gold jewelry, sunglasses and a curly mane. In a 2015 interview, the star told FIRST for Women that when it comes to her personal style, she’s a fan of “Very easy dressing,” like flowy dresses and jeans with a camisole. As she told us, “I like to keep it simple.”\n\nDisco diva\n\nLucci looks ready to hit the dance floor in this decadently draped and sequined dress. In a 2014 interview with FIRST, Lucci told us she’s a music lover, and her favorite genre is Brazilian jazz.\n\nSusan and her sweatheart\n\nLucci was married to Helmut Huber, who became her manager, for 52 years, from 1969 until his passing in 2022.\n\nIn a FIRST interview in 2023, she said that in dealing with her grief, “I’m a work in progress, but I’m making progress. I find gratitude to be an amazing coping medicine. I am so grateful for the blessings I have now and have had in my life. To have known the kind of love that I experienced from my husband, to be loved like that. I know how lucky I was to have had that, and I would tell him that.”\n\nA soap opera tryst\n\nIn this steamy shot from a 1982 episode of All My Children, Lucci canoodles with Lee Godart, who played the wealthy playboy Kent Bogard.\n\nAn early award\n\nLucci hadn’t yet won her Emmy in 1983, but she did win Us magazine’s award for Favorite Female Daytime TV Star.\n\nErica and Jackson\n\nIn this 1989 episode of All My Children, Lucci and Walt Willey, who played the lawyer Jackson Montgomery, one of Erica’s many love interests, have a dramatic moment.\n\nReady for business\n\nLucci looked ready for business in a smart white button-down and ostrich skin pencil skirt.\n\nBringing the drama\n\nThis red, low-back, lace-embellished gown certainly brings the drama — just like Erica Kane.\n\nA fabulous hat\n\nYou can only pull off a hat like this if you’re a soap star of Lucci’s stature!\n\nLovely in leopard\n\nThis over-the-top skirt suit is the height of glamour."
