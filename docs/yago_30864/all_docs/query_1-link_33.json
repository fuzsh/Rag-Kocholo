        "text": "Yesterday’s episode of General Hospital, marked the first of a three-episode appearance by former All My Children star, Walt Willey. Not only did Willey return to another ABC daytime drama series, but he is appearing as his Pine Valley character of legal eagle, Jackson Montgomery.\n\nWilley shared scenes on Wednesday’s show with Kristina Wagner and Lynn Herring as Felicia and Lucy travel from Port Charles to Pine Valley to do some snooping and sleuthing on Lucy’s current love interest, Martin Grey (Michael E. Knight).\n\nIn a series of tweets, following his first GH episode, Willey shared: “I am at a loss for words (a very rare condition in my case) over the outpouring of generous, kind and supportive posts – here, in chatrooms, on GH’s social media – regarding my General Hospital debut. In a word: WOW! I cannot thank you all enough for loving and caring for me and ‘Jackson’ for almost 25 years on (and off!) AMC to the point where, 12 years after AMC went ‘dark,’ ‘Jackson’ — and his portrayer — still ‘have legs.’ I’ve said it more than once, but it bears saying again — soap fans are the greatest fans of all! Thank you so much! See you on General Hospital on Monday, July 17 and Tuesday, July 18!”\n\nMeanwhile, as Walt had promoted over the last few days, the beloved AMC veteran was part of several ABC affiliate station press interviews discussing: how it came about he landed on GH (with an assist from former AMC castmate and friend Michael E. Knight), how it was getting back into the rigors of shooting a daytime soap opera when it had been over 12 years since he worked on one, and more.\n\nYou can check out two of them below. One, from his current hometown in Nashville at WKRN News 2 where he appeared in studio, and another from ABC 7 Chicago via his mini-satellite media tour.\n\nA fun fact that was revealed to the hosts, Willey is currently married to Nashville singer/songwriter Sarah Kaine, whereas the love of his on-screen life on All My Children was, of course, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci).\n\nWhat have you thought of Walt’s appearance thus far on GH? Hope the soao brings him back for more episodes? What do you think is going on with Martin, in story? What is he hiding? Let us know your thoughts and theories via the comment section below.\n\nFormer General Hospital favorite and longtime fitness guru, Richard Simmons’s cause of death has been determined when his passing was ruled accidental.\n\nLenny Simmons, Richard’a brother, informed PEOPLE through a statement from a family rep, Tom Estey, the findings of the LA coroners report. Estey shared, “The Coroner informed Lenny that Richard’s death was accidental due to complications from recent falls and heart disease as a contributing factor. The toxicology report was negative other than medication Richard had been prescribed. The family wishes to thank everyone for their outpouring of love and support during this time of great loss.”\n\nSimmons, appeared as himself on GH when he held exercise classes at the Campus Disco from 1979-1983, and them made a brief return to the GH Nurses’ Ball back in 2013. He was found dead at his home on July 13th by his longtime housekeeper, one day after celebrating his 76th birthday.\n\nThe LAPD originally reported there was no foul play in his death, but that more testing needing to be done to be conclusive. Previous reports indicated that Simmons had fallen inside his home on July 12, after feeling dizzy, and that he had informed his housekeeper that he would possibly seek medical attention the following day, if he felt unwell.\n\nRichard’s brother, Lenny Simmons, shared how he wants the beloved pop fitness icon to be remembered, stating, “I want them to remember him for the genuine joy and love he brought to people’s lives. He truly cared about people. He called, wrote and emailed thousands of people throughout his career to offer help.”\n\nShare your thoughts on the official cause of death of Richard Simmons, and if you will miss the beloved fitness guru and enjoyed his appearances on GH? Comment below.\n\nOn the Tuesday, August 30th episode of ABC’s General Hospital, John “Jagger” Cates (Adam J. Harrington) becomes more unhinged as his hatred for Sonny (Maurice Benard) has taken over any sense of reason. First, he tried to get Kristina (Kate Mansi) put behind bars for threatening to kill and harm Ava Jerome (Maura West) during the confrontation that saw Kristina go crashing through a window.\n\nKnowing Cates is using Kristina as a pawn to get to him, Sonny goes into the courtroom as cool as a cucumber, while Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) goes before the judge to argue how Cates’ case against her daughter has no merit. The judge gives Cates 48 hours to come up with proof and build a case of the allegations he levied against Kristina, or he is in deep trouble with the law and the FBI.\n\nMeanwhile, Ava (Maura West) and Nina (Cynthia Watros) talk at the gallery where Ava admits what happened when Kristina came to pay her visit the night she fell through the window and lost her unborn baby. When Nina asks what really went down that day, Ava explains that Kristina came to see her after she was issued a subpoena. Ava confirms that Kristina barged into the room and was yelling at her. She then adds that at some point she put her hands on Kristina, but Kristina pulled away, and tripped over some luggage and fell through the window. Ava begs Nina to believe her. Later, Nina make a call to someone calling in a favor.\n\nAfter his case against Kristina goes bust, Cates heads to Ava’s gallery, where he informs her what happened in court. Ava thinks she will really need her lawyer now and she hasn’t heard from Scott.
