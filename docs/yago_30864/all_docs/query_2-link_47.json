She then went on to host the 2000 Emmy Awards.\n\nAfter being nominated for 19 Emmy Awards, she finally won in 1999. Her reputation of losing numerous times is so legendary when an actor/actress loses after several times they say, \"You pulled a Susan Lucci.\" Angela Lansbury almost caught up to Susan, with 18 losses in her career.\n\nShe was married to Helmut Huber, who passed away March 28, 2022, for over 52 years. Their two children are Andreas Huber and Liza Huber.\n\nOften did spoof commercials for Wendy's restaurant chain in 1992, where she, in soap opera character, wrote the late Dave Thomas, himself, for switching to the healthier lunch menu.\n\nAttended and graduated from Garden City High School in Garden City, New York (1964). She was a cheerleader and voted \"Best Actor\" by her classmates.\n\nHe was awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California on January 28, 2005.\n\nAs of her 2011 departure from All My Children (1970), Susan Lucci was the last actor, and her character, Erica Kane, was the last character remaining from the AMC pilot, and she was one of the most recognizable women on soaps. She started AMC shortly after graduating from Marymount College.\n\nAfter 19 nominations and no wins, she finally won a Daytime Emmy Award for the role of Erica Kane in All My Children (1970) in 1999.\n\nShe has three grandchildren from her daughter, Liza Huber and Alexander George Hesterberg III: Royce Alexander Hesterberg (born December 23, 2006), Brendan Hesterberg (born August 16, 2008) and Hayden Victoria Hesterberg (born March 23, 2011).\n\nHer fragrance LaLucci is now available in Walmart stores. It is the first time she has ever sold a product in stores. She is also the first soap opera star to sell their own product in a major retail store.\n\nAs of May 2006, she and partner Guthy-Renker have sold over six million Youthful Essence Personal Microdermabrasion kits since 2001. They attribute this success to Susan's huge fanbase.\n\nHas had amazing success with her new skin care collection, Youthful Essence. To date, she and partner Guthy-Renker have sold over four million kits.\n\nHer fictional All My Children character, Erica Kane, penned four books: \"Raising Kane,\" Erica Kane: Beyond the Pain,\" \"Having It All,\" and \"Uncensored.\" In July 1997, \"Having It All\" was released as a real-life book from Hyperion publishing.\n\nInterviewed by sports journalist Sam Weinman, who devoted an entire chapter to her in his book \"Win at Losing: How Our Biggest Setbacks Can Lead to Our Greatest Gains\", released by TarcherPerigree publishing on December 20, 2016."
