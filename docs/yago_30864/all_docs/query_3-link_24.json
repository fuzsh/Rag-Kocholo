She went on to tell Alec about her trials and tribulations that had occurred on that very beach, including the time she bottomed out completely, and the time that she threw Brian's engagement ring into the ocean. Alec finally convinced Hayley to stop beating herself up, and to have some fun. The couple was dancing closely at midnight, when Alec raised Hayley up in the air with the excitement of the countdown.
