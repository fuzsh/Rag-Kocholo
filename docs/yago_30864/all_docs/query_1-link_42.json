        "text": "A big crossover will happen on General Hospital\n\nSoap fans there is an exciting crossover coming soon when All My Children's Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey) crosses over from Pine Valley to Port Charles on General Hospital. According to Soaps in Depth, the daytime veteran completed taping for GH on June 9 which suggests his episodes should air in mid to late July if there are no preemptions.\n\nWilley a fan favorite will be joining four other All My Children alumn who are now on General Hospital but it's not known yet whether or not he will have any scenes with them. Michael E Knight (Martin Grey) portrayed Tad Martin on AMC, and James Patrick Stewart played Will Courtlandt. Finola Hughes (Anna Devane) took her GH character to Llanview and Cameron Mathison (Drew Cain) portrayed Ryan Lavery. .\n\nWilley expressed his joy that he was asked to join the General Hospital cast and said everyone treated him nicely but gave no hints about his new character. Montgomery is a lawyer so perhaps he will play a role in the trial of Drew and Carly Spencer who are battling the FCC. The timing of Jackson showing up in Port Charles coincides with attorney Zeke Robinson (Gavin Houston) coming to town. Zeke was there for Drew when Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) falsely accused Drew of pushing Ned Qurtermine (Wally Kurth into the pool.\n\nThe exit of Attorney Scott Baldwin ( Kin Shriner) leaves only Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennessy) as the established lawyer in the town. it's still not clear whether or not Shriner is just on a break or if he will return, Still have Zeke and Jackson who both are lawyers coming to Port Charles at this time is interesting.\n\nWalt Willey's personal life and daytime career\n\nThe actor began his career on the soaps in 1983 on ABCs The Edge of Night as a guard. He later portrayed Jim LaRusso on Another World, (NBC) Joe Novack on Ryan's Hope, (ABC), and Jacoby on As the World Turns (CBS).In 1987 he began his role as Jackson Montgomery, one of the many husbands of Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) on All My Children.\n\nBorn in Ottawa, Illinois, Walt Willey attended Southern Illinois University, where he majored in Fine Arts. It was during his time at college that he became involved in acting, performing major roles in several productions. In 1981, Walt left Illinois for New York to break into acting professionally.\n\nWalt began doing stand-up comedy in 1990 as he traveled across the country. He also headlined at famous comedy clubs like Caroline's in New York, Zanies in Chicago, and the Comedy Store in California. The View's Joy Behar recommended him for membership into the famous Friars Club and Walt joined comedy greats like Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, and Billy Crystal when in January 2001 he was inducted into the prestigious entertainment fraternity. Willey raised a lot of eyebrows when he released a racy comedy DVD titled Wild and Willey. Fans were in shock but Willey said his comedic influences were Robin Williams and Richard Pryor."
