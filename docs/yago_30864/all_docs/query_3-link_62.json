        "text": "Most women get married once or twice, but she's walked down the aisle nine times.\n\nShe is, after all, Erica Kane, portrayed by Emmy Award-winning soap opera superstar Susan Lucci. Just in time for all those June weddings is the Champagne Lace Wedding Erica Kane Doll, celebrating Erica's romantic 1993 Spring wedding to handsome, wealthy Dimitri Marick at Pine Valley's Wildwind Estate on ABC Daytime's Emmy Award-winning All My Children.\n\nEvery detail of this daytime legend's wedding ensemble has been re-created just as it was on her special day. Erica's mermaid-style gown of white lace with champagne satin lining and intricate beading is sophisticated, her flowing veil dramatic. She even wears a wedding ring inset with an authentic Swarovski crystal.\n\n\"Susan Lucci's overwhelming popularity and the phenomenon that has become Erica Kane exemplifies the glamour and beauty that makes up the Daytime Drama Collection,\" explains Amy Miller, vice president of marketing for Mattel. \"The month of June is the perfect time to bring together the world's best-loved daytime drama actor with a fashion doll of the character she portrays every day on All My Children. Collectors and soap opera lovers will cherish the Champagne Lace Doll for years to come.\"\n\nThe Champagne Lace Wedding Erica Kane Doll sells for about $65 and will be available in June. Champagne Lace Wedding Erica Kane is second in a series of dolls from the Daytime Drama Collection featuring soap stars.\n\n_ Times wires"
