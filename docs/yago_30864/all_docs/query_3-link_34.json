Without a doubt, she is the most responsive and diligent recruiter I have encountered in the industry. Over the course of the interview process, I was constantly stressed out but Erica was super encouraging and on top of it. She made sure to keep me in the loop about my progress every step of the way while also making sure I was at ease for my interviews. As a personal anecdote, I was incredibly nervous going into my first on-site interview so Erica took me to get coffee and play Pokemon Go. I felt so much better afterwards! I feel incredibly lucky to have worked with someone who takes such a personal approach to recruiting. She truly humanized the process and I wish every company could have an Erica Ebinger in recruiting! I would gladly work work with Erica again and I highly recommend her.”\n\n“Erica was my recruiter when I was considering career opportunities. The experience was great with honestly the least stress that I've ever had during interviewing. Erica took the time to understand what I was looking for and connected me to the resources that I needed during the search (whether that was people or just information!). I would strongly recommend Erica to any company that is looking for a talented recruiter. ”"
