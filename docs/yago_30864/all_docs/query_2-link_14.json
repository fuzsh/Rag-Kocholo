        "text": "Susan Lucci is used to playing a mom on camera, but she's also a mother to two kids in real life.\n\nThe soap opera star played the notorious Erica Kane on All My Children from 1970 to 2011 and went on to star in Hot in Cleveland, Devious Maids and Army Wives.\n\nBefore all of her success, though, Lucci married TV producer Helmut Huber in 1969. They met working at a hotel and dated for three weeks before getting engaged. On Sept. 13, 1969, they got married.\n\nLucci and Helmut welcomed their first child, daughter Liza, in 1975 and their son Andreas followed over a decade later in 1988. The pair raised their children in Garden City, New York, which Lucci has said provided a sense of calm to their otherwise hectic lives.\n\nOver the years, the actress has taken her kids to Hollywood events, supported their charity projects and celebrated them on their respective wedding days. The family was also there for one another when Huber died at age 84 in March 2022.\n\nIn an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 2018, Lucci said that she was a very involved parent, despite the demands of her job. She told the outlet that she took Liza to dance classes, riding lessons and equestrian competitions. The actress even said she drove carpools and planned family meals.\n\nHere's everything to know about Susan Lucci's kids.\n\nLiza Huber, 49\n\nLiza Huber, Lucci and Helmut's first child, was born on Feb. 22, 1975, in Long Island, New York.\n\nLucci's elder child graduated from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill with a degree in communication and media studies and went on to study acting at the Terry Schreiber Studio in New York City. Following in her mother's footsteps, Liza portrayed Gwen Hotchkiss Winthrop in the soap opera Passions from 1999 to 2008.\n\nIn the middle of her time on the series, on March 13, 2004, Liza married businessman Alexander Hesterberg III, per The New York Times. The couple, who met each other in elementary school, reconnected at a concert in Manhattan and got married two years later. They now have four children of their own: Royce, Brendan, Hayden and Mason.\n\nLucci has said she adores being a grandmother. \"I love the hugs and kisses!\" she told Closer Weekly in 2016. \"And Hayden running to me in her tutu shouting, 'Grammy! Grammy!' This warmth from the children is the best.\"\n\nIn 2012, Liza stepped away from acting and started the baby food brand Sage Spoonfuls, after not being able to find homemade meals she trusted for her kids. She was featured in Forbes' \"Female Entrepreneurs Rocking the World\" series in 2015 and was a parent ambassador for Healthy Child Healthy World, per her bio on the Sage Spoonfuls' website.\n\nLiza and Lucci have also been involved in ADAPT Community Network, formerly known as United Cerebral Palsy of New York City, for very personal reasons. Liza's son Brendan was diagnosed with the neurological disorder in 2010.\n\n\"I broke down in tears,\" Liza told PEOPLE in 2015 of hearing her son's diagnosis. \"I felt sadness that he would deal with cerebral palsy for the rest of his life, but I also felt gratitude that he could walk ... I want him to feel good and proud and celebrate the way he overcomes challenges.”\n\nLucci also spoke out about how her daughter has handled Brendan's medical prognosis. \"I am very proud of her,\" she said of Liza. \"Good for Brendan, for his mom to speak about him with such pride publicly, as well as to open up a conversation about cerebral palsy. It can only have a positive impact and how wonderful for Brendan to know his family is proud of him.\"\n\nLiza has said she is incredibly delighted with all of her son's progress, which includes Brendan attending a 2017 gala for ADAPT with his grandma. \"I want to shout his accomplishments from the rooftop. Walking up two stairs of our home without holding on when he gets home from school is the biggest deal ever!\" Liza said. \"I want to celebrate him and for him to celebrate himself.\"\n\nLucci shares in her daughter's excitement for Brendan's life. “He’s taught me that you have to go forward and that life is a gift,” the actress said. “He’s a spectacular little boy.”\n\nAndreas Huber, 36\n\nLucci and Helmut welcomed their second child, Andreas Huber, in 1987.\n\nAs a child, their son \"played every sport — karate, lacrosse, golf,\" Lucci told Women's Wear Daily in 2018. He was a golf champ in high school and college, making it to the quarter-finals of the US Junior Amateur, playing at Georgetown University and winning the Big East championship, per Inside Garden City.\n\nAndreas worked on Wall Street for a few years before joining the Canadian PGA Tour and European Challenge Tour. He is the co-founder and CEO of First Due, which helps fire service organizations and local governments \"streamline their information management,\" according to his LinkedIn.\n\nAndreas married wife Courtney Velasco on Aug. 21, 2016, in Newport, Rhode Island. Lucci shared a photo of the bride on her Instagram, writing, \"The beautiful bride on the staircase at Rosecliff ❤️💍❤️ #happiness #LOVE.\"\n\nShe shared many other photos of the day including a picture of her with her late husband and a snap of the newlyweds. Andreas and Courtney welcomed their first child together in November 2017."
