I wasn’t watching AMC that much over this time.\n\nBasically, Erica was addicted to painkiller following a back injury and was furious at most people in town for what she perceived as utter betrayal. She had a falling out with Dimitri over her addiction, and over his relationship with Maria (I don’t recall the specifics), and she was angry at Brooke for years of perceived wrongs; and at Liza and Tad for their business dealings that resulted in her losing her talk show. This speech paved the way for Erica to go to Betty Ford Center.\n\n\"and to the fans, I was only supposed be on every other Tuesday. But thanks to you I'm here to stay. I'm going back to that studio on Monday and I'm going to play Erica Kane for all she's worth.\"- Susan Lucci, 1999 Daytime Emmy Speech.\n\nThanks so much for clarifying! Much appreciated! 😀\n\nand so you are right! I was completely mistaken! This episode aired in 1996, so I’m guessing it was nominated in 1997 and the 24th Daytime Emmy Awards? or was it at the 23rd in 1996? I can’t remember if the eligibility period back then was based on the calendar year or if it was on a different timeline?\n\nThis episode aired in early 96 and she was nominated for this story at the 96 Emmys. For some reason, she decided not to submit this episode even though it was some of her best work ever! She submitted the episode before (Erica getting dressed for the award ceremony) and an episode of Erica going through withdrawals while detoxing.\n\nShe lost to Erika Slezak who won her fifth Emmy for the episodes where Viki realizes Dorian didn’t kill Victor after all, Viki’s altar Tori did. Viki then confesses to her family.\n\nThese scenes are soap acting gold! I’d never seen these before, and what a treat! La Lucci is in fine form here. The dig about St. Maria tending to the sick in her push-up bra was the best.\n\nI also love how well these scenes and Erica in particular capture the duality of almost all soap towns (not B&B or The City), where they are essentially small towns in the middle of nowhere but also have this weird glamour to them that attracts people from far and wide, with their own airports, TV stations, headquarters for multiple international companies, etc. Erica feels like a huge deal celebrity, but it also feels like she’s just telling off all the people in her book club. It’s great.\n\nand so you are right! I was completely mistaken! This episode aired in 1996, so I’m guessing it was nominated in 1997 and the 24th Daytime Emmy Awards? or was it at the 23rd in 1996? I can’t remember if the eligibility period back then was based on the calendar year or if it was on a different timeline?\n\n1996-97 was the last of the years that were not calendar years, with a second 1997 that was I think 8 1/2 months. Starting in 1998 it has been calendar years January – December.\n\nO.K., I never really loved Erica Kane nor Susan Lucci. She was never a favorite of mine and I resented her “name check” Emmy nominations because it meant other actresses were never nominated. Kathryn Hays deserved several Emmy nominations, and even from AMC Kate Collins was robbed of nominations. jmho.\n\nNot now\n\nViewing 12 posts - 1 through 12 (of 12 total)\n\nYou must be logged in to reply to this topic.\n\nSimilar Topics\n\nEmmyLoser - Aug 7, 2024\n\nDaytime TV\n\nadamunc - Jul 30, 2024\n\nDaytime TV\n\nEmmyLoser - Jul 19, 2024\n\nDaytime TV"
