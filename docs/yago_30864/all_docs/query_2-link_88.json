        "text": "Post by Principessa on\n\nI was going to do a whole recap of David and Erica, but then I realized there's a lot more to them and if you want to know ALL of them, you kind of have to break it down month by month which actually works because we're uploading clips of them right now -- and we're starting at the beginning. Thanks to ellabelle for doing all of the clipping and for helping with well...everything!\n\nSo here you go:\n\nFebruary 1999: David and Erica first met in February of 1998, when David treats a young Bianca suffers heart problems as the result of her eating disorder. But on February 4th, 1999 their real story began.\n\nDavid and Erica met again at the Teen's Against Addiction gala, where David promptly walked away from Vanessa Bennett after she collapsed with chest pains. Erica's impression of David Hayward, who she once thought was charming, changed quickly. She became suspicious and started digging, which caused her to find out more things about this mysterious doctor.\n\nDuring a bad snowstorm in mid-February David and Erica's paths crossed again in New York. David was desperately trying to find a flight back to Pine Valley - unfortunately, the airport had canceled all flights and there appeared to be no way back to town. Across the terminal, Erica placed a frantic call on her cell phone hoping to find someone to drive her back to town. They both made it to the car rental service at the same time. Erica explained she was to film a commercial or other appearance when she returned, but David had a medical emergency. Unbeknownst to David, Erica snuck into the car, after David refused to give her a ride.\n\nSomewhere between New York City and Pine Valley, Erica marveled at the findings in David's little yellow file folder. David returned to the car while Erica was still reading the file. As they bickered, Erica figured out that David was going to reveal the truth about Colby's paternity at Liza and Adam's wedding. Erica demanded that David drop her off at the next exit, but David refused to pull over. After they bickered some more, Erica suddenly screamed in horror, the had wrecked and a large pole crashed onto the vehicle and went through the windshield.\n\nDavid had a few scrapes on the side of his face, but he managed to regain consciousness fairly quickly. He looked down at the floor and noticed that his yellow file folder was covered in blood. He then turned to his right to look at Erica... and gasped.\n\nDavid realized that Erica was impaled, and was going to die if they didn't do something quickly. A piece of wire had punctured Erica's chest. Not only had the wire punctured one of Erica's lungs, but it had also lodged itself dangerously close to Erica's heart and aorta. His only choice was to save her. Erica suddenly stirred, and her body shifted in the car seat - the sudden movement caused the wire to tear into Erica's heart. As blood trickled from Erica's chest, David realized that he would have to begin operating on Erica.\n\nOnce Erica woke up at the hospital David entered the room and gave Erica a brief check-up. Erica pulled away as the doctor approached. Myrtle wasn't quite sure why Erica was acting so strangely and explained that David had helped her after the accident. David said it was perfectly normal for trauma victims to have amnesia. Little did she know what the future held for her and the man who almost killed her, and this was only the beginning...\n\nNow that you have the full Februaryback story, you can see all of David and Erica here. (We're still uploading the clips, so we'll post them ASAP.) The descriptions are ABOVE the videos.\n\nFebruary of 1999\n\nDavid and Erica really first met when David treated Bianca in February of '98. But their second (and most memorable) meeting was a ear later during the Teen's Against Addiction (TAAD) benefit on February 4th, 1999. David and Erica's flirtation is cut short by a 'mystery' woman, Vanessa Bennett. Later, in the parking lot they realize Vanessa is having a heart attack - and the cardiologist, Dr. David Hayward walks away.\n\n\"Their Story Begins\" February 4th 1999\n\nAfter Vanessa collapses, and Joe Martin takes her to the hospital Erica confronts Dr. Hayward, wondering why he walked away from a woman in distress. He asks her if there is someone she hated so much that she would walk away from if she knew they were going to die. She replies yes, that there is a man who she hated so much that her mother, who was a saint, let die. Erica starts to wonder just who Vanessa Bennett is and what connection she has to David. She picks up Vanessa's purse off of the ground, and has a look inside.\n\n\"You Walked Away\" February 5, 1999\n\nA few days after the gala, Erica goes to Vanessa who is recovering in PVH about David walking away from a patient. She asks if she rememebers that there was another doctor there that night, Dr. David Hayward, renowned cardiologist. Vanessa asks how she could forget. Erica explains that she was stunned that David just walked away. She also explains her previous conversation with David. Still unsatisfied by the answers given to her by Vanessa, she decides to go to Joe and Jake Martin. Meanwhile, David visits Vanessa and interrogates her about her stay in Pine Valley. She says maybe she wanted to see him again... the conversation is short, but it leaves us wondering what the connection is between David and Vanessa. Erica goes to Jake and Joe to find out more and to alert them that David walked away. She questions them about laws, and what could happen to a doctor if he walked away from a person in need, only to find out that the TAAD benefit wasn't the first time David had been in trouble with the hospital board. She learns that David had given Adam Chandler the wrong medication and it almost killed him.\n\n\"Looking For Answers\" February 10, 1999\n\nUpset that Erica is causing trouble at the hospital, David decides to go to Enchantment to confront Erica. He gets in by lying to Erica's secretary, he says he is Bianca's doctor. His lying infuriates Erica and does not get him anywhere. She threatens to call security, but David stops her. Realizing David isn't going to go away, she decides to give him five minutes to explain himself. He says he would like to start over, that they have a lot in common. When he suggests they could be friends, Erica says that's a bizarre and frightening thought. He says he could be of help if she needs any medical connections. He claims they share the same 'world view.' She tells him he is wrong. He says an exchange might be beneficial. Erica says he's good, but not good enough - that she created her business, that he thinks he can get his way by flattering her. She says it was her duty to report him to the hospital, actually the DA. He says Miss. Bennett was never in any danger - there was no reason for him to jump in. He wants no more misunderstandings - he tells her not to cross him or he'll be obliged to return the favor. Unfazed, Erica says her net worth exceeds his and she has great influence on the media. She says he blew his chances with her when he walked away from Vanessa, not everything is as it appears. She then brings up Adam Chandler. He says he was cleared, and asks if she ever made a mistake. Still curious about David, Erica calls up her good friend and ex-husband Adam Chandler who calls David a criminal and a sociopath.\n\n\"David's Veiled Threats\" February 11, 1999\n\nIf you want to see what else we have on our channel click here.\n\nPost by Principessa on\n\nDavid manages to regain consciousness fairly quickly, with only a few scrapes on the side of his face. He looks over and sees Erica - who is completely unconscious and is barely clinging to life. After checking Erica's pulse, with a worried expression on his face, he grabs his phone and calmly calls the hospital. He calls Jake Martin, who is on staff and is surprised to learn that Erica is the passenger in critical condition. As he explains Erica's injuries and tells Jake that the wire is lodged close to her aorta and with any sudden movement Erica could bleed out. He also asks Jake to have Dr. Weiss, a plastic surgeon on stand by. David immediately starts bandaging Erica's face - which causes her to stir suddenly. She asks what happened, and David explains the accident. He tells her not to move, and that the injury is very close to her heart - she whispers that it's hard to breathe. She whispers he'll walk away and he says he won't. She says she wants Joe, she doesn't want him before she becomes unconscious again. David calls Jake again and says he is afraid Erica may die. While David is on the phone, Erica moves and as feared - starts to bleed out. David begins operating to save Erica's life.\n\n\"The Accident: Part 2\" February 23, 1999\n\nAfter two hours, Jake continues to try to get a chopper to David and Erica. The pilot refuses to go out, he says union regulations prohibit him from flying - Joe Martin jumps in and says he will fly because Erica is a critical patient and will die if they don't get to her soon. Back in the car, David tells Erica he did his part now she has to do hers. He tells her to keep breathing until her friends at PVH get there. He says she told him she was a fighter, and that she needs to fight. As Erica's blood pressure is dropping, David's anxiety intensifies and he calls Jake - as he's on the phone, the medevac and ambulance arrive. As they arrive at the hospital David pushes his way past Jake, he says he has to finish what he's started. David prepares to operate on Erica, but is stopped when Dr. Weiss says he needs to start on Erica's face. David tells him to get in line, that it's not going to matter, that people aren't going to care what her face looks like inside of a coffin.\n\n\"The Accident: Part 3\" February 24, 1999\n\nPost by Principessa on\n\nA very upset Myrtle is at PVH to visit Erica, but runs into Dimitri who asks what happened. Myrtle explains the situation, but Dimitri continues to ask more questions. He wonders why she was out during a blizzard. David comes out of the ER and says Erica lost a lot of blood and has a lot of injuries but she came through the surgery fine. Myrtle asks if she can see Erica, but the nurse says there's something she needs to know. In Erica's room the nurses comment on how it's a shame, and that Erica was so beautiful. A semi-conscious Erica is laying in a hospital bed, her face is bruised and the right side of her face is covered in bandages. The nurse explains to Myrtle that other pieces of the wire went into her face, and that there wasn't time to fix it. But that they're lucky that Erica is still with them. Vanessa decides to talk to David, she says many men have tried to steal Erica's heart, but he saved it. Vanessa then goes on to talk about Erica, she says she heard she almost died. David says Erica will be very grateful that he saved her life. But Vanessa points out that he was behind the wheel of the car, and that he escaped with barely a scratch. She says he always was careless about other people's feelings, women mostly. Myrtle and Dimitri talk some more, she says she won't leave until Erica knows Myrtle is there. The nurse tells her to be prepared, and not to let Erica see how upset she is. She continues to tell Dimitri that the damage is extensive. In Erica's room, Myrtle tells Erica where she is, and that she had a car accident - and that she had them all very scared. Erica asks Myrtle what to leave, and she asks her to explain what happened to her.\n\n\"What Happened To Me?\" February 25, 1999\n\nErica regains consciousness after her heart surgery, and continues to ask Myrtle what happened. Myrtle tells her that she needs to rest, and not to speak - she needs her strength to get well. She tells Erica not to touch the bandage on her face. Erica says she wishes her mother was with her, Myrtle says she is always with her. Myrtle explains that they put stitches around Erica's heart, but she's going to be just fine. Once again, Erica asks what happened - Myrtle, worried that she might upset Erica, says she'll get the doctor to explain it to her. Myrtle starts to get upset, and tells Erica she's beautiful before explaining that Erica's face was cut in the accident. Erica asks if she'll be alright. Out in the hallway, Dimitri and Joe Martin talk about Erica - Joe says she was very lucky to have one of the finest cardiologists with her in the car. Dimitri asks to talk to Dr. Weiss. Back in Erica's room Myrtle assures Erica that she will be okay, she tells Erica about a man who had more bandages than Erica did, and he was fine. She says all Erica needs is time to heal. During this time David walks in. When David shows up, Erica whispers a \"no.\" Outside of the room, Dr. Weiss and Dimitri continue to talk - Dimitri says he's not sure Erica can live if he can't fix her face. In Erica's room Myrtle tells Erica that Dr. Hayward saved her life, and David asks if she remembers. She says she doesn't remember, she only remembers that she was in a storm and an airport. David seems relieved and says not to push it, that's it's normal for trauma victims to have amnesia. She asks when she will remember. He says some patients do remember, some don't. Myrtle follows David out of the room to ask him why he didn't tell Erica that he was driving the car. He says she's recovering, that it would do more harm than good to tell her about the details. Dimitri jumps in and asks what's going on. David explains he was driving and that he owes Myrtle an apology, that it was a lot more upsetting than he's willing to admit. He says she's right, that he should have pulled over. He lies and says Erica insisted that they continued driving.

He was the one driving on that cold, snowy February night. That night that nearly killed her. Erica decided to confront the cardiologist about lying to her. David then panicked, setting off red flags for Erica. She knew the doctor was trouble, and was done giving him chances to redeem himself.\n\nA few days later, after hearing Erica talk about wanting to return to modeling, Erica’s ex-husband Adam Chandler made it clear to David that he would pay for hurting her and ruining her chance at ever having a successful modeling career again.\n\nOnce Erica recovered enough to finally see her face in a mirror, she couldn’t believe what was before her. The right side of her face was covered in white bandages. Erica became alarmed and curious about her condition and immediately started asking questions about her face.

Before she could find out, David stopped Dr. Weiss, a well-known plastic surgeon in Pennsylvania from leveling with Erica about the extent of her facial injury.
