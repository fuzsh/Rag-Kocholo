        "text": "On the 1970 - 2011 TV show \"All My Children,\" Susan Lucci as Erica Kane was married to Jeff Martin. He was her first husband on the show. Erica's first two marriages, first to Jeff Martin in 1971 and then to Phil Brent in 1975, both ended because the men want her to be a housewife instead of a career woman.\n\nDuring Erica's marriages and relationships, the writers of the show in an interview for Soap Opera Weekly stated, \"Erica truly believes when she gets married that it's going to last. She's one of those people—when she says those vows, she means them. She's really very old-fashioned in that she gets married instead of just saying 'I've been married enough, I'm going to just live with someone.' She's still searching for that home with mommy and daddy and children. The home she didn't have.\""
