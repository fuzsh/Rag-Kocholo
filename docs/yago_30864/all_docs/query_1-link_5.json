        "text": "and loose his cash flow.\n\nNow to help out a bit… I watched AMC for just a little whiled the last few years it was on. I think Anna and her sister Alex characters crossed over to AMC. Anna was also married to a guy named David somthing and he was a Dr. on GH and AMC too.\n\nT. Knight played Tad Martin on AMC but we have not seen a connection to that character other than the play on his name. But today with the Hummingbird cake I got confused bc I don’t recall Tad loving it on AMC but it could have been mentioned and I just forgot. Tad also did not speak with a strong souther accent like Martin did … he has since dropped that accent.\n\nSky Chandler is also Sky Quartermain but she also had a roll on OLT as this same character.\n\nIt looks as if GH is pulling some of the other two soaps history in GH. Maybe a ploy to get more viewership. So are they trying to tell us that they are slipping and on the chopping block? I don’t think you will need to know a lot about the history of the other two soaps. It seems to me that the quick refrences are just “filler” blah blah blah… Gh did a good job today of bringing you in the loop with the characters talking it out. I was trying to remember who on AMC was trying to kill Anna thinking she was Alex. I think Anna fell off a boat or something… Its a blurr I didn’t watch but for a few years on and off. But thinking maybe that is why Jackson is talking to Anna. Anna involved with her past fall out and Jackson would need to be connected somehow IDk this is GH afterall.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nLucy solicited Felicia to find out what Martin is hiding from her and why he’s so deadset against marriage.\n\nFelicia found a large check amount from a bank account statement from Pine Valley hence the reason for the trip threre.\n\nFelicia is snooping tp find more info on the bank account through Jacskon Montgomery’s office.\n\nBased on the convo btwn Anna and Martin, he doesn’t want to remarry because he’ll lose his alimony payments (blackmail payments?). Anna told him Lucy is a dog with a bone and if Martin was willing to marry 3 other women she’s not ok with him not wanting to marry her.\n\nSpeculation: ex#3 may be in cahoots with Tracy over the deceptor product and she thinks Martin stole the idea and gave it to Lucy. Hence the invite to the ELQ picninc under the guise of being Tracy’s special guest. Perhaps a reveal of the ex#3 and possible connection to Tracy and Martin.\n\nDr. David Hayward has never been on GH, to my knowledge which in my opinion he should have been. He had a lot of crossover potential. Anna was on AMC for quite awhile, Robin even joined her for a short time. She & David were married & had a child named Leora. Unfortunately Leora developed a heart condition. David wanted to operate on her since he was a world famous heart surgeon, but of course could not because of his relationship to his daughter. She died & Anna left Pine Valley for Port Charles. Vincent Irizarry won an Emmy for his portrayal of David Hayward. He is possibly one of my favorite actors of all time.\n\nMichael Knight played Tad the Cad Martin on AMC for aver long time. But he & Martin Grey are 2 different characters on 2 different shows.\n\nJackson Montgomery (Erica Kane’s former husband, financed & love many times) was a character on AMC. I suspect that the character is on to further along the story & that file has info on one of Martin’s ex-wives that may have been a Pine Valley resident. Haven’t watched all of Tuesday’s show.\n\nI think this is pretty accurate summary of what happened on Pine Valley as I remember it."
