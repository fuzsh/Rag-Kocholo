        "text": "NEW YORK - Susan Lucci's memorable \"All My Children\" character is about to become TV's Ultimate Cougar.\n\nThe conniving Erica Kane, with 10 husbands down already, will fall into the arms of a much younger man on ABC's soap opera this summer. To make life a little more complicated, it's her daughter's ex-husband and ex-fiance's stepson.\n\nGot that straight?\n\nThe soap opera's summer story line puts Lucci squarely into television's zeitgeist, now buzzing with stories about experienced women looking for younger models - as opposed to old men looking for models.\n\nCable's TV Land just wrapped up \"The Cougar,\" a reality series featuring a 40-year-old blond mother of four with salivating 20-somethings competing for her hand. ABC is prepping the comedy \"Cougar Town\" for the fall, with former \"Friends\" star Courteney Cox re-entering the dating world. On CBS' \"Accidentally on Purpose,\" Jenna Elfman has a baby with a slacker she picked up for a one-night stand.\n\n\"Certainly the fact that it is a hot topic right now makes it all that more delicious for us,\" said \"All My Children\" executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers. \"It doesn't mean that that is how we're going to tell the story.\"\n\nIt's hard to find a TV character with a richer history than that of Erica Kane.\n\nKane has lived a lot since arriving in fictional Pine Valley in 1970, with a drug addiction, time in prison, a stolen embryo, a rape that resulted in a daughter, a stabbing of Husband No. 8 and many, many manipulations.\n\nShe reached double figures in husbands just two years ago.\n\nWhile Demi Moore may seem the prototype cougar these days, Lucci's frame of reference leads her to Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson and her famous seduction of Dustin Hoffman in \"The Graduate.\"\n\nIn the relationship with Ryan Lavery, \"I'm sure people would expect it to be the kind of story line where Erica was manipulating things,\" Lucci said. \"But there's been zero of that.\"\n\nShe believes the story will mean more to viewers than other TV cougar stories simply because it's been nearly 40 years of Lucci's character.\n\n\"Everyone watching the show has a sense of her vulnerability, her strength, her eccentricities,\" she said. \"They've gotten to know Ryan just as well. So there's a lot more to it than just, 'oh, my God she wants a younger man' or 'oh, my God, he wants an older woman.' \"\n\nHow much older? Don't ask. They don't tell ages on soap operas."
