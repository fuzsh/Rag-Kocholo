        "text": "That would have been my first guess mainly because she owned Enchantment. It would have made sense to have her be the one who actually created the product that is now known as the Deceptor and Martin gave it to Lucy and she is mad. However, it looks like its going to be Blair which is disappointing.\n\nWait, what? How do we know it’s Blair? What did I miss? Blair from OLTL?!\n\nEdit: I just saw the article that says it’s Blair. Interesting turn of events…. Kane would have made more sense though. But still fun to see some familiar faces from the old ABC lineup\n\nI hate that they’re dragging characters in from other soap operas. Some of us didn’t watch the other soap operas and have no clue who these people are.\n\nI am getting increasingly frustrated and angry at the number of characters that they keep introducing. What are we at 90 characters on the show now?!\n\nInstead of bringing more in, they need to be killing some of them off and shipping others out.\n\nOverly bloated cast. People aren’t getting airtime. Stories aren’t being told properly or in a timely fashion.\n\nI get bored if things are dragged out too long and I end up just not caring.\n\nI agree. I watched OLTL and AMC back in the day and even I think this is ridiculous. For those who haven’t watched those shows, these characters mean absolutely nothing and like you said, there are already so many characters on the show.\n\nI have been saying this for the past three years and it doesn’t matter. Frank Valentini does not care about producing a quality show. He wants to bring on his friends or friends/family of the cast members without regard to the audience or even the other cast members.\n\nThis is the worst I have ever seen GH in regards to characters. They have so many characters that some are lucky to get once a month. Last year Roger Howarth was on like three times in six months. I don’t get the way that he formats the show but obviously ratings show its not working."
