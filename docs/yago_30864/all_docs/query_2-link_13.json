        "text": "The happiest days of her life?\n\nIn anticipation of All My Children ending its 41-year network run before migrating online, Soaps.com is taking a look back at the many characters and relationships we’ve enjoyed along the way. Our latest subject is none other than Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) and her many husbands.\n\nErica Kane has been a fixture in Pine Valley since “All My Children” first went on the air in 1970. She’s certainly had no shortage of men to choose from during the past several decades as evidenced by the many trips she’s taken to the altar. The actual number of husbands she’s had is often a question of debate since a few of the marriages were invalid, but her penchant for getting married has become soap opera lore since there’s been at least 10 weddings.\n\nErica’s first trip down the aisle was to Dr. Jeff Martin (Charles Frank) in 1971. Of course, being a doctor’s wife was too mundane for her, so she divorced Jeff after having the first ever legal abortion on a fictional TV series.\n\nPhil Brent (Nick Benedict) was Erica’s next victim. They married in 1975, but after a miscarriage and a nervous breakdown on Erica’s part, they separated and Phil reunited with former love Tara (Karen Lynn Gorney).\n\nNext up was Tom Cudahy (Richard Shoberg). They married in 1978, but things started to unravel when he caught her in several lies. They divorced shortly after he discovered she was taking birth control pills, despite her claims of wanting children."
