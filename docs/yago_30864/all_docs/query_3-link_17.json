        "text": "Post by ellabelle on\n\nErica and Tad were friends in the 80s. She helped Tad and Jenny do some modeling in NYC, introducing them to her agent, Olga, and even letting them stay in her apartment in the city. She went to bat for Tad and Dixie in the late 80s, telling Adam that he was horrible for keeping Dixie from baby Adam Junior. In the mid-90s, they took turns hosting \"The Cutting Edge\" on WRCW, with Tad taking over after Erica's prescription drug addiction spiraled out of control. Tad was among the many voices urging Erica to get help.\n\nWhen Tad became a private investigator, he was Erica's go-to person when she needed information on someone. She hired him in 2004 to help her try to sort out what she'd really done the night Michael Cambias was murdered, as she had a block of time for which she couldn't account that night (temporary amnesia is SO common soaps, isn't it?) He also helped her figure out who Greg Madden was and was the one to gently break the news to Erica that Josh Madden was her son. After keeping the secret that Babe and Jamie were on the run with baby Adam Chandler III, Tad was the one who finally told Erica that Bess Chandler was really Miranda Montgomery.\n\nTheir friendship took a fabulously funny turn in 2007 when Erica convinced Tad to pretend to date her during Erica and Jack's \"New Divorce\" reality TV show, in an effort to make Jack jealous. Tad had a bit too much fun with the role, at one point pretending to take Erica's request that they sleep together seriously (she meant that she wanted him to spend the night in her hotel room and get caught by the camera sneaking out the next morning). The New Divorce gave us a hint of what a Tad/Erica relationship could have been - and let's just say it would have been really funny.\n\nDespite the 25+ years they shared on screen, Tad and Erica were not paired romantically. It was one of her few friendships with a man that didn't cross the line into something more, and IMHO, that's a good thing. They valued each other as friends, his mother was her best friend, and they were there for each other without it becoming something more.\n\nThe only exception to the 'no romance' - the hilarious 2002 Fan Fantasy Episode in which Tad and Erica were getting married. The only problem? Well, Joe was trying to stop the wedding because he and Erica had a secret love child, Opal didn't want the wedding to happen, Bianca was trying to sabotage her mother, and Tad was sleeping with every woman in Pine Valley. Literally.\n\nThis was right before the entire wedding (presided over by Jack) descended into chaos:\n\nI will never understand why AMC didn't do more of these fantasy episodes because this one was just fabulous.\n\nPost by Principessa on\n\nOh the fantasy episodes were FABULOUS! AMC should've done more! I agree, while I would've loved to see Tad and Erica as a couple (maybe just in a fantasy episode) I am glad that Erica had one male friend to stick by her without any extra more complicated strings. She needed that.\n\nWith that said, I have a few videos to post because well, this was the closest we got to seeing Tad and Erica as a couple. During Jack and Erica's 'lovorce' I adored how she used Tad to make Jackson jealous (while he was dating, but not dating Barbara). Oh the hilarious scenes that came out of the lovorce.\n\nErica and Tad's wedding fiasco. (From the fantasy episode.)\n\nIn 2006, Tad told Erica the truth about Josh...\n\nPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nTad decides to help Erica out when he sees that Jack is dining with Barbara, and Erica is attempting to make him jealous.\n\nAgain, at The Comeback, Erica and Tad decide to make Jack and his date jealous...\n\n(Side note: I think what happens in this clip are some of the funniest Tad and Erica moments ever!)"
