        "text": "by Sean P. Aune |\n\nIt seems Pine Valley isn’t quite gone yet as Walt Willey will appear on General Hospital as his All My Children character, Jackson Montgomery.\n\nThe original run of All My Children may have ended in 2011, but it seems the characters aren’t gone yet. It has been announced that Walt Willey will be making a visit to Port Charles as Jackson Montgomery. No word on what brings him to town, but his appearances are expected to begin in mid-July.\n\nWilley began his tenure on All My Children in 1987 and remained in the role until the original series ended its run on ABC in Sept. 2011. He did not participate in the short-lived revival from Prospect Park.\n\nJackson was best known for his relationship with Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), but today his character may be better remembered for his adoptive son, Reggie. The role was played by Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) and then was replaced by Michael B. Jordan (Creed III) when the role was recast. We doubt Reggie will be coming to town with Jackson.\n\nThere has been no indication of how long Willey will be visiting Port Charles or what brings him to town. Our first guess would be possibly a connection to Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). Anna spent a few years in Pine Valley and had some intimate interactions with Jackson. It may be completely unrelated, but it would also be an easy way to explain his presence.\n\nConsidering the heritage of All My Children, it’s good to see that the characters haven’t been completely written off."
