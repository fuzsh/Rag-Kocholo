        "text": "They’ll be no Erica Kane-esq fits of rage by Susan Lucci on the heels of ABC’s Thursday cancellation of long-running soap All My Children (along with One Life To Live).\n\n“It’s been a fantastic journey,” says the actress, who has played the dramatic character for 41 seasons. “I’ve loved playing Erica Kane and working with [show creator] Agnes Nixon and all the incredible people involved with All My Children. I’m looking forward to all kinds of new and exciting opportunities.”\n\nThe daytime dramas will end in September and January, respectively, and ABC has said they will launch two new lifestyle-oriented series, The Chew and The Revolution.\n\nBut, the cancellation news was upsetting for many.\n\n“This is like losing a member of your family,” Kelly Ripa tells THR. “All My Children was more than a job.– it was my family. It was there that I met my husband; it was there when my first two children were born; it was there where I met many of my life-long friends. It was the greatest training ground ever. I feel heart sick.”\n\nFans and former stars of the long-running show also took to the Twitterverse Thursday afternoon, with Lucci even Tweeting she was saddened by the news.\n\nActress Marlee Matlin Tweeted: “Who imagined that the Welcome to Pine Valley sign would ever come down? Ally My Children axed.” She later added: “I remember how excited I was to meet Ruth Warwick, aka Phoebe Tyler and Susan Lucci, THE Erica Kane. Wonderful AMC memories.”\n\nThe CW’s Vampire Diaries producer Julie Plec also tweeted her thoughts, saying “I grew up watching and loving soap operas. Today’s ABC news makes me sad.”\n\nThe cancelled soaps join a slew of others in recent years including CBS’ The Guiding Light and As the World Turns as well as NBC’s Passions."
