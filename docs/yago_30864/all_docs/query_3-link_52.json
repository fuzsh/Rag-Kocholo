        "text": "Post by ellabelle on\n\nI'm trying to make a list of all of the times Jack proposed to Erica:\n\n1. the initial first proposal in between her marriages to Travis, which ended with her remarrying Travis to make Bianca happy\n\nThis is her response to his first proposal:\n\n2. He proposed again during her marriage to Travis, and she accepted and put on his engagement ring, right before Travis walked in on them in bed together. I am pretty sure this was 1990.\n\n3. He proposed to her on the runway of a NYC fashion show in October 1994 while she was wearing a wedding dress. She said yes, but they broke up a few weeks later when Laurel was nearly killed in a car accident, and he decided to try to work on his marriage. She wasn't over Dimitri anyway and was unexpectedly calm about the breakup.\n\n4. He proposed to her in early 1998 after she got out of prison for Maddie's kidnapping. That engagement ended when Mike Roy was revealed to be alive. Erica was torn between the two men and ultimately chose Jack, but when he found out she'd slept with Mike, he broke off the engagement.\n\n5. He proposed to her in spring 2003 after their one night stand broke up her engagement to Chris Stamp. She initially turned him down, but when he nearly died after being shot, she changed her mind and agreed to marry him. Greenlee broke up their wedding by announcing that she was his daughter - and that Erica had known about it and kept the news from Jack.\n\n6. He proposed again in early 2004 right before the start of Kendall's trial for the murder of Michael Cambias. Erica returned that ring after the trial when she realized Jack had known about Bianca's continued pregnancy and kept the news from her. She was also drinking again, which was a factor too.\n\n7. I'm pretty sure he proposed again before the May 2005 wedding, but I don't know the date.\n\n8. He proposed in the hospital after her plane crash and mountain ordeal with Caleb. That wedding was thwarted when Jane kidnapped her. Jane, pretending to be Erica, returned that ring to Jack and said she loved David. Erica got the ring back when Erica escaped and Jack realized she wasn't crazy after all. The status of that engagement was left up in the air when AMC ended on ABC and Jack walked out on Erica.\n\nI think that's every proposal/engagement. If I missed one, PLEASE let me know! I know video exists of the 2nd proposal, but it's in the midst of a length compilation of clips online, the third proposal on the runway, the pre-trial proposal and the hospital proposal. If you have a link to a YouTube video of any of Jack and Erica's proposals, please post them here!\n\nPost by Principessa on\n\nEllabelle, you are welcome to edit and/or delete this post but here are some of the proposal links:\n\nThis includes the part where Erica accepts Jack's proposal and Travis walks in at them. (This video is one part of multiple parts of the Jack/Erica/Travis triangle! Go watch from part one!)\n\n2nd Proposal\n\n(The 1990 Proposal and Aftermath)\n\nStarts around 4:14\n\n6th Proposal\n\n(2004 Proposal)\n\nI am working on finding the other videos... if I do, I will add to this! I am working on getting the last proposal from another YouTube user, I know the actual date of that one (June 21st, 2010) and if I can find the dates of the rest hopefully I will find those too. Does anyone happen to know them?"
