        "text": "NEW YORK - Two classic ABC soap operas will soon meet their demise: \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" will air their final episodes in September 2011 and January 2012, respectively, leaving only \"General Hospital\" to survive them.\n\nSince it premiered in 1970, \"All My Children\" has received more than 30 Emmy Awards and made history by airing daytime TV's first same-sex kiss between two women as well as its first lesbian wedding and the first coming-out story for a transgender character. It is also home to Susan Lucci's famous Erica Kane, who has been married 10 times.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning \"One Live to Live\" has been on the air since 1968 and was among the first in daytime television to cover interracial romance, gang violence and teen pregnancy. The show made national headlines when it introduced a gay teen character (played by Ryan Phillippe) and was later honored by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD).\n\nIn place of the two soaps will be two new series, \"The Chew,\" a food show co-hosted by Mario Batali set to premiere in September 2011, and \"The Revolution\" (working title), a makeover show hosted by Tim Gunn that focuses on \"health and lifestyle transformations\" that will make its debut in January 2012.\n\nThe death of the two ABC soaps follows the recent cancellation of \"Guiding Light\" and \"As the World Turns\" on CBS.\n\n\"While we are excited about our new shows and the shift in our business, I can't help but recognize how bittersweet the change is,\" said Brian Frons, president of daytime for Disney ABC/Television Group, in a statement.\n\nNoting that the two new series were inspired by the success of \"The View,\" Frons said, \"We are taking this bold step to expand our business because viewers are looking for different types of programming these days. They are telling us there is room for informative, authentic and fun shows that are relatable, offer a wide variety of opinions and focus on 'real life' takeaways.\"\n\n(Melissa Maerz is a reporter at The Los Angeles Times.)"
