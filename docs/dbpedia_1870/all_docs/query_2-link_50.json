        "text": "I am a graduate of Lynden Christian (class of 2014), and I received my teaching degree from Dordt College in Elementary Education in 2018.My husband Paul and I live in Lynden. We are members of New Song Church in Bellingham, and we enjoy the opportunities we have to serve there.\n\nI love being back at Lynden Christian and find it a huge privilege to be working here. I want my students to know that they are loved by God, they are created in His image, and they are a part of His plan.\n\nOutside of school I enjoy hiking, biking, going camping, road tripping, and spending quality time with the people I love!"
