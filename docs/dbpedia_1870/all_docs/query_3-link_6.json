        "text": "Netflix once planned to have a contest (to improve movie recommendations) where they would release movie rental history, movie reviews along their birth dates, gender, and five-digit zip code. That combination is personally identifying information and could do things like out someone's private sexual identity if that could be inferred from their rental history.\n\nA famous study found that with the date of birth, gender, and five-digit zip code you can uniquely identify about 87% of Americans. It also found that you could uniquely identify about 100,000 Americans (0.04%) by the combination of year of birth, gender, and zip code.\n\nFor medical de-identification of protected health information (PHI), the US Dept of Health and Human Services suggests to truncate the last two digits of the five-digit zip code off, except for 17 rare zip codes starters (where less than 20,000 people share these three initial digits according to the US Census) (specifically 036, 059, 063, 102, 203, 556, 692, 790, 821, 823, 830, 831, 878, 879, 884, 890, 893) in which case you should replace the zip code with all zeros.\n\nSimilarly, you should be mindful of fields like age in exceptional cases are rare (e.g., there's only one American with an age of 116) so HHS recommends grouping these exceptional ages into one category (e.g., 90+). It's also probably better to group other users into age categories (like 50-55) to help anonymize them further.\n\nYes, of course it is personally identifying information. It provides identifying information about a person, so why on earth might it be considered otherwise?\n\nConsider a shopkeeper in a small town saying \"I think I shall invest in [very unpopular company] when I get home tonight.\" His customer says \"if you do, I will never shop here again!\" That night, the customer sees that another investor appears on the company's map for that zipcode.\n\nWould you consider it unreasonable of the customer to stop shopping at that store? Would you consider it unreasonable of others, on hearing this tale, to also stop shopping there? Remember, small town, there probably weren't any investors at all from there before.\n\nWould you consider it reasonable of the shopkeeper to then sue the company for leaking his private investment information and hence causing damage to his business?\n\nSo the potential number of zipcodes where the combination of [is a user of that webside's service] and [lives in that zipcode] and [when they started investing] will be uniquely identifying is obviously pretty huge.\n\nBut it's worse than that.\n\nThe following zipcodes have a population of exactly one person: 05141, 67843, 88264, 98222, 99790. There are over a hundred zipcodes with populations under 10. 11109 has an area of just two city blocks. If you live in 38639 you are also black. If you live in 02562 you are white (better than 99% probability for both). If you live in Beverly Hills 90210, you are rich and everyone knows it. If you live in 90209, you are still rich, but likely have a chip on your shoulder about your zipcode being less famous.\n\nThere are a little under 8 billion of us. That means that we need only \"33 bits of entropy\" -- that is, 33 yes/no questions which slice the population roughly in half, like \"are you male\", \"do you live outside China/India\", etc -- to identify any individual. A zipcode provides between 16 bits of information (the two most populous zipcodes have over 110,000 people in) and the full 33 (those 6 zipcodes above). That is to say, a zipcode alone is at least half the information needed to uniquely identify anybody.\n\n[Edit: and of course, in the US, businesses are persons. Many, MANY companies with a technical population of zero have their own zipcodes. If that company invests in another company, they may well NOT like that information being put up publicly.]\n\n[Edit2: Zip codes are explicitly called out as PII by Massachusetts (https://casetext.com/case/tyler-v-michaels-stores) and California (http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/pineda-v-williams-sonoma-33947).]\n\nIn The Netherlands both CPB (government institution for statistics) and CBP (government watchdog for privacy both in the commercial as government domain) will conclude that the dataset you have is containing personal identifying information. Their reasoning will be as followed most likely:\n\nA zip-code can identify say <100 people with it's strongest match and can identify <2500 people with the suffix removed (removing the last two characters from the six positions). The first four identify the region on the map and the last two the subregion that will even identify which of the street it is in some cases;\n\nAs you only list customers any hit will identify the customer in that area indirectly unless you're the telco with a 50+% market share in those zip-codes. If you have 1 in 1000 or even 100 people as customer you can identify which hit will be which customer combined with some digging;\n\nThis may seem extreme, but in a case study for medical data it was proven for The Netherlands that people could be identified if only one extra third-party detail was added to make the relation with their \"pseudo data entry\" (zip-code based). In some situations it was just browsing Google Maps to find that detail.\n\nBut as you indicate this is for a financial institution, then you really have to discuss this with your risk manager. Also as others have identified this as an issues in other countries."
