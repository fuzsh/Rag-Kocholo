For example, if you want to see postal codes that have at least one customer (that bought something within the time period you specified), leave the minimum threshold set to “1.” If you want to see postal codes that have at least two customers, enter “2,” and so on.\n\nBy Number Of\n\nThis field lets you choose if you want to filter by number of customers or number of transactions with postal codes."
