        "text": "I've been trying to purchase Quicken Deluxe for >1hr. I have been chatting with \"Max\" from support for ~45min. Every \"solution\" brings us back to the purchase page where I am required to enter a zip code (no option for postal code). I can see that this issue has been unresolved for over 1 year. It is really surprising that Quicken is missing out on the Canadian market by making the online purchasing process impossible. Ultimately the solution Max and I settled on was for him to call me, and I gave him my purchasing details over the phone. This process has made me very concerned about the quality of this product. I really hope I do not regret the decision to purchase.\n\nIn 2022, for the consumer to be unable to easily purchase the product online is embarrassing. Quicken should fire its web development team.\n\n1\n\nThe work-around is to use ANY VALID zip code. It will not affect the usage of Quicken.\n\nHave Questions?

If the zip code doesn't matter, then why is it there in the first place ?\n\n0\n\nI had this same problem a year ago. Turned out I was on the US quicken site. The lovely quicken.ca had somehow sent me there \"accidentally\" because I was perusing different links on the site. Eventually I found the correct webpage and everything worked.\n\n0\n\nI'm trying to renew my Canadian subscription. I changed the subscription type and when I went to purchase, it takes me to a screen that asks for zip code even though I started at Quicken.ca. Contrary to the above assertion, it will not accept my Canadian postal code. I suppose I could enter some other zip code, but it does concern me that something as simple as this is still a problem. Im surprised that this has not been fixed. Usually issues with the payment process are high priority for a company to fix as this can impact their revenue.\n\n0\n\nGiven that this has been going on for years, gives you an idea of what kind of \"support\" Canadian users will get. Quicken Windows Canadian is Quicken Windows US with lipstick on, and that goes for the rest of the support.\n\nSignature:\n\nThis is my website: http://www.quicknperlwiz.com/\n\n0"
