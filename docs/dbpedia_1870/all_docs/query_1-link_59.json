        "text": "The WALTHER-PRÄZISION brand originated in the 1950s from the requirement of the company founder Carl Kurt Walther to be able to connect and disconnect the supply lines of the company’s own production facilities and its own machine program of Maschinenfabrik Carl Kurt Walther, Wuppertal (founded in 1931) quickly and conveniently.\n\nConvinced of the technical and economic advantages of the product, the first range of couplings was launched on the German market in 1951. Even back in those days, the couplings already satisfied the very highest quality requirements with many of these first generation products still working perfectly today.\n\nSince those early days WALTHER-PRÄZISION has been recognised as an international problem solver and specialist for quick coupling systems, operating worldwide.\n\nThe basis of WALTHER-PRÄZISION`s success is innovative leadership, with a clear insight into customer-oriented solutions, combined with first class quality and due consideration for the environment resulting in first class products. WALTHER-PRÄZISION does not mass produce goods! Whether it is milled, turned, welded, glued, cast, injection moulded, punched, pressed or shaped, each item is checked. All assembled couplings, whether standard or special, undergo final function and leak testing before leaving the factory.\n\nAll employees at WALTHER-PRÄZISION act according to the motto: expertise through training, experience and curiosity! Precision and responsibility create quality! Quality in particular reduces the customer‘s operating costs!\n\nWALTHER-PRÄZISION will continue to stand for customer service, innovation and highest quality. This is the only way for us to continue to manufacture technically and economically superior products which also benefit the environment.\n\nWe would like to thank our many thousands of customers and assure them that also in the future we intend to make every effort to justify the trust they place in and their loyalty to WALTHER-PRÄZISION. We ask everyone else to put us to the test, so that in future, theyalso can become one of our good connections.\n\nYou want QUALITY – e.g. we design and manufacture according to:\n\nDIN EN ISO 9001 (quality management)\n\nDIN EN ISO 13485 (medical technology)\n\nDIN EN ISO 14001 (environmental management)\n\nYou need approved fittings – e.g. we supply:\n\nATEX (designed with explosion protection)\n\nGW (approved for gas, water)\n\nFDA (for pharmaceuticals, medical and food safety)\n\nEU 1935/2004 (food production)\n\nSAE J2600 (covering automotive industry, hydrogen tanking)\n\nDIN EN 60068-2-14 (for automotive industry, micro-hydraulics)\n\nTA Luft (German Clean Air Act) according to VDI 2440\n\nDIN EN 10204-3.1 (acceptance test certification)\n\nDIN EN 61373 (for rail vehicles)\n\nDNV prototype permits (for shipping, offshore)\n\nYour advantages:\n\nYou work with a partner who has many years of experience in designing and producing single and multi-way connection systems.\n\nYou have at your fingertips the world‘s largest standard range with 400,000 variations,mostly ex stock.\n\nYou get quick coupling systems which meet the required International Standards for quality approvals and applications.\n\nYou profit from a modern design department with fast internet-based communication channels.\n\nMade in GERMANY\n\nYour benefits:\n\nWALTHER-PRÄZISION delivers your media connections.\n\nWALTHER-PRÄZISION designs in 2D / 3D, saving your time.\n\nWALTHER-PRÄZISION validates your complete media interface if required.\n\nWALTHER-PRÄZISION supplies with defined costs.\n\nContact us. We are here for you!\n\nOur Know-how\n\nresponsibility and Care\n\nProduction of the coupling components requires the highest precision. We use modern machining centres and latest production technology to provide for flexibility and accuracy when machining a wide range of materials.\n\nThe nearby assembly plant offers both highly automated assembly lines for large volume production of standard couplings and special assembly areas for small batches. In this way, even small batches can be produced economically and to the same high standards.\n\nOur quality management system has been certified to DIN EN ISO 9001 since 1992 and is something that we at WALTHER-PRÄZISION consider a natural component of our top-rate quality standards. Our medical technology production line fulfils DIN EN ISO 13485. Every coupling produced by WALTHER-PRÄZISION undergoes function and leak tests before leaving the factory. Special test facilities are available for extreme operating conditions."
