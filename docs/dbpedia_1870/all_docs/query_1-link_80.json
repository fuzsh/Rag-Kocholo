If periods are replaced by\n\nhyphens, these are the same as the department codes from ISO standard 3166-2.\n\nFIPS: Codes from FIPS PUB 10-4.\n\nPopulation: 2001-07-28 census.\n\nPostal codes:\n\nThe Universal Postal Union document says that Honduras uses postal codes of six characters: two letters, representing the department, followed by four digits. I have not observed these codes in actual use.\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Municipalities of Honduras page.\n\nThere is a special district called Distrito Central, which is included in Francisco Morazán in the table above. It has an area of 1,648 sq. km., and contains the cities of Tegucigalpa and Comayaguela. Distrito Central ranks as a department in some ways, but in others it is subordinate to Francisco Morazán. The standards don't list it as a separate department. Aside from that, the departments are further subdivided into 298 municipalities (282 in 1980, 291 in 1995). The municipalities are subdivided into aldeas (villages) in suburban areas and caseríos (hamlets) in rural areas.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nIslas de la Bahía consists of islands in the Gulf of Honduras, of which the largest are Roatán, Guanaja, Utila, Barbareta; and, farther offshore, the Islas Santanilla.\n\nValle includes Isla el Tigre, Isla Meanguera, and other islands in the Gulf of Fonseca.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Honduras lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nEl Paraíso: = paradise\n\nFrancisco Morazán: named for Francisco Morazán (1799-1842), Central American revolutionary\n\nGracias a Dios: for Cape Gracias a Dios, = thanks to God\n\nIslas de la Bahía: = islands of the bay\n\nLempira: for Lempira (1499?-1537), native leader in the resistance to the conquistadores; his name means \"gentleman of the mountains\".\n\nTegucigalpa: Nahuatl for \"silver mountain\".\n\nValle: = valley\n\nChange history:\n\n1824: Tegucigalpa became alternate capital of Honduras (formerly Comayagua was the only capital).\n\n1825-06-28: Honduras divided into seven departments. Choluteca corresponded roughly to modern Choluteca and Valle; Comayagua, to Comayagua and La Paz; Gracias, to Copán, Intibucá, Lempira, and Ocotepeque; Olancho, to Olancho; Santa Bárbara, to Cortés and Santa Bárbara; Tegucigalpa, to El Paraíso and Francisco Morazán; and Yoro, to Atlántida, Colón, Gracias a Dios, Islas de la Bahía, and Yoro. The capitals had the same names as their departments, except that Juticalpa was the capital of Olancho.\n\n1869-05-28: Copán department split from Gracias. El Paraíso department split from Tegucigalpa, with the addition of Danlí and Teupasenti municipalities from Olancho department. La Paz department split from Comayagua.\n\n1872-03-14: Islas de la Bahía department split from Yoro.\n\n1880-10-30: Tegucigalpa became permanent capital of Honduras.\n\n1881-12-19: Colón department split from Yoro.\n\n1883-04-16: Intibucá department split from Gracias.\n\n1893-07-04: Cortés department split from Santa Bárbara. It also acquired part of Yoro department, but that part was restored to Yoro on 1893-07-17.\n\n1893-07-11: Valle department split from Choluteca. For a short period, the same area had previously been designated as La Victoria department.\n\n1902-02-24: Atlántida department formed from parts of Colón (La Ceiba and El Porvenir municipalities) and Yoro (Tela municipality).\n\n1906-02-17: Ocotepeque department split from Copán.\n\n1909-08-17: Nueva Armenia municipality transferred from Colón department to Atlántida.\n\n1934-06-07: Ocotepeque, the capital of Ocotepeque department, destroyed when the Márchala River flooded. A new city, Nueva Ocotepeque, was built five km. away. Its official date of foundation was 1935-09-17.\n\n1943: Name of Gracias department changed to Lempira; name of Tegucigalpa department changed to Francisco Morazán.\n\n1957-02-21: Gracias a Dios department formed from all of Mosquitia territory and part of Colón department.\n\n1958: Official name of Nueva Ocotepeque, the department capital, changed to Ocotepeque; however, the longer name lingers on.\n\n~1975: Capital of Gracias a Dios department moved from Brus Laguna to Puerto Lempira.\n\nOther names of subdivisions:\n\nCortés: Cortez (obsolete)\n\nLempira: Gracias (obsolete)\n\nFrancisco Morazán: Tegucigalpa (obsolete)\n\nPopulation history:\n\nDepartment1881189519101916193019401950-06-181961-04-171974-03-061988-05-292001-07-28 Atlántida11,37220,90532,50643,86263,58292,914148,440238,742344,099 Choluteca42,78133,66545,81747,77169,09688,245107,271149,175192,145295,484390,805 Colón6,46513,40911,19112,91831,78730,64435,46541,90477,239149,677246,708 Comayagua16,31121,71326,33931,19942,98754,04668,17196,442135,455239,859352,881 Copán32,15144,79840,28247,82766,20882,05395,880126,183151,331219,455288,766 Cortés13,66523,55930,31458,27387,269125,728200,099373,629662,7721,202,510 El Paraíso16,07531,24542,11840,85756,30067,74282,572106,823140,840254,295350,054 Francisco Morazán59,01558,98481,84486,119113,483158,918190,359284,428451,778828,2741,180,676 Gracias a Dios10,90521,07934,97067,384 Intibucá18,95727,28531,17339,00252,65059,36273,13881,685124,681179,862 Islas de la Bahía2,8343,9904,8935,5995,4807,0258,0588,96113,22722,06238,073 La Paz19,82920,61628,76430,60139,14048,51651,22060,60065,390105,927156,560 Lempira42,63036,26049,95551,74064,94778,97790,908111,546127,465177,055250,067 Ocotepeque28,19029,78737,49446,02045,67352,54051,16174,276108,029 Olancho28,15036,27343,36845,90453,41264,52183,910110,744151,923283,852419,561 Santa Bárbara29,47426,01839,06443,02061,26080,36696,397146,909185,163278,868342,054 Valle24,13330,47928,72340,25453,66665,34980,90790,954119,645151,841 Yoro11,57416,42418,92621,54042,55563,33998,700130,547194,953333,508465,414 Totals307,289400,350553,446605,997854,1841,107,8591,368,6051,884,7652,653,8574,443,4026,535,344\n\nPopulation of Mosquitia territory included in Colón until 1950.\n\nDepartment: Gracias listed under Lempira, Tegucigalpa listed under Francisco Morazán (1881-1940).\n\nNumbers are census years.\n\nSources: Instituto Nacional de Estadística Website. 1895 data are from \"Honduras: Estructura Territorial y Estadística\n\nsegún Censo 1895\", William V.
