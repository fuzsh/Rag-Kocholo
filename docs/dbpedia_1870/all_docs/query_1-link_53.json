        "text": "GN-38143 CAN Improved the overall matching logic to better match the city alias and street components. GN-42042 CAN Improved parsing logic. The usage of \"NO\" is no longer treated as preDirectional for input address such as \"NO 3 RD\". GN-42328 CAN Improved the parsing logic to identify the presence of extra information in the input address. GN-42136 CAN Fixed the parsing issue that causes ESPLANADE E and ESPLANADE EAST to parse differently. GN-42313 CAN Adjusted the city alias scoring for Master Location Data candidates. GN-42943 CAN Improved the parsing logic for Single-line address input. GN-43157 CAN The CA8 dataset now returns complete postal code. GN-42305 CAN Improved the matching logic to better match the input address. GN-42829 CAN The input address such as 110 AB 547, SIKSIKA, AB, T0J 3W0, CA,8766, which contains numeric streets, has now enhanced the street name search. GN-43211 CAN Improved the overall parsing logic for better handling of input where the street name contains unit type words. GN-42178 CAN Updated the candidate filtering to prefer the input language form for the street type if both French and English exist in candidates. GN-43188 CHN Restricted the number of words considered for matching in single-line input address when performing Geographic Fallback. GN-39504 CZE Optimized the matching threshold for better considering the address candidates. GN-39503 CZE Optimized the matching threshold for appropriate consideration of the address candidates. GN-42892 IRL Improved the parsing logic to better handle the street address format. GN-42939 JPN Updated the suppression of accented numeric characters for Kanji. GN-36822 JPN The Japanese geocoder supports a specified input address format. Hence providing the input address in a different format results in an incorrect address candidate. For information on the input format for Japan, see the \"Single Line Input\" section in the Enterprise Geocoding Guide for Japan guide. GN-42940 PRT The output address with the precision code (Z3) now returns the precision level 5. GN-42960 NLD The output address with the precision code (Z3) now returns the precision level 5. GN-42937 ROU Improved the soundex logics for ROU. GN-43212 SGP Optimized the matching threshold for better considering the address candidates."
