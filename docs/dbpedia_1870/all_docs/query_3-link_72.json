        "text": "Hi @Yunus1711\n\nThank you for reaching out to the community forums and for sharing the issue you are experiencing at the checkout.\n\nI understand that your checkout experience currently does not have the postal code as a mandatory field and that you do need the postal code to be able to provide local delivery options. While I am happy to submit feedback to our developers on this topic for you, I know that doesn't solve your immediate issue. I would recommend looking into an app or developer that can provide a post code validator on the product/cart page that prompts the customer to fill in their postcode before reaching the checkout. You can also edit the language on the checkout page so that there is a call to action next in the postal code field encouraging them to fill it in.\n\nAny text or fields can be edited using the theme language editor. In your store admin if you go to Online Store > Themes > Actions > Edit Language, you can change any precreated text on your checkout in there.\n\nCan you please let me know what country your business is located in so that I can provide this feedback to our developers?\n\nThank you!\n\n-Shay\n\nShay | Social Care @ Shopify\n\n- Was my reply helpful?

Since, the method of delivery I'm using is by inserting the postal code, I would appreciate if the team can make this tweak; as the field that must be filled, in order for the customer to understand what information they are lacking on. Hope it can be done soon!\n\nAnd yes, thank you so much @Shay for the tip. I can use the language tool to indicate the customer on informing the postal code is mandatory before clicking on.\n\nAlso, answering to your question, my store is located in Sri Lanka.\n\nThanks again and hoping the developers would respond as quick as you did on this tweak\n\n- Yunus -\n\nHello @Yunus1711\n\nThe zip code field of the address form in your checkout, is automatically set to require the zip or postal code be entered before proceeding to the next page of the checkout. Therefore, customers will not be able to continue through to the shipping page unless their zip code is provided.\n\nYou can assist your customers with entering their entire shipping address details by enabling the address autocompletion option. This checkout setting is found in your Shopify admin by going to ‘Settings > Checkout’. It looks like this:\n\nWhat payment gateway are you using? If you are using Shopify Payments, then there is another setting that you can use to ensure an accurate zip code is entered. From your Shopify admin again, please go to ‘Settings > Payment Providers > Manage’ and enable the Address Verification System (AVS).\n\nThis is a fraud prevention feature as well, that will decline the payment if the zip code entered for the billing address does not match what the customer’s credit card provider has on file for them.\n\nI hope the above is useful to you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nGemPages Support Team\n\nGemPages - Build any high-converting store pages for any business\n\n- If you find my reply helpful, please hit Like and Mark as Solution\n\n- Get connected: App Store | Blog | Community | Help Center"
