        "text": "ZIP Codes: a very brief history\n\nZIP codes, the postal code system used by the US Postal Service (USPS), were introduced in 1963. Their basic, and most familiar, format consists of five digits that indicate a specific delivery area. In 1983, the USPS introduced the extended ZIP+4 code.\n\nZIP+4 Codes\n\nAlso called “plus-four codes”, “add-on codes”, or “add-ons”, the ZIP+4 code starts with the standard five-digit ZIP Code. The four extra numbers are added after a hyphen to complete the ZIP+4.\n\nSo what do the extra numbers mean?\n\nThese last 4 digits represent specific delivery routes within delivery areas. This extra detail means an even more precise matching to a more granular level. It could represent a handful of houses on one side of a street, or even a single building that receives a high volume of mail.\n\nSo ZIP+4 Codes help the USPS more effectively sort and distribute mail. How does this affect you?\n\nWhy should you care about ZIP+4?\n\nNow you know why you should care about ZIP+4 codes. The next step is how to start using them.
