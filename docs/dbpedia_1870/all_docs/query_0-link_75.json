We have no influence on the current and future design, content or authorship of the linked pages. Therefore, we expressly distance ourselves from all contents of all linked pages that were changed after the link was set. This statement applies to all links and references set within our own Internet offer. The provider of the linked page alone is liable for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damages arising from the use or non-use of such information.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nLiability for contents\n\nThe contents of our pages have been prepared with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and up-to-dateness of the contents.\n\nAccording to § 7 para. 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act), we as service providers are responsible for our own contents on these pages according to the general laws. There is, however, no obligation to monitor transmitted or stored information from third parties or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity (§§ 8-10 TMG). If we become aware of any infringements of the law, we will remove this content immediately. However, liability in this respect is only assumed from the time of the point in time at which we become aware of concrete legal infringements.\n\nLiability for links\n\nOur pages contain links to external websites of third parties. We have no influence on the contents of the linked pages. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or owner of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. A permanent control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of legal infringement.

All contributions by third parties are marked as such. Duplication, processing, distribution, or any form of commercialisation of such material beyond the scope of the copyright law shall require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use only.\n\n​\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nInformation about the processing of your data\n\nWe are required by Article 12 of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: DSGVO) to inform you about the processing of your data when you use our website. We take the protection of your personal data very seriously and this privacy policy informs you about the details of the processing of your data as well as your legal rights in this respect.\n\nWe reserve the right to adapt the data protection declaration with effect for the future, in particular in the event of further development of the website, the use of new technologies or changes to the legal basis or the relevant case law.\n\nWe recommend that you read the data protection declaration from time to time and keep a printout or copy for your records.\n\nDefinitions\n\n\"Website\" or \"internet presence\" hereinafter means all pages of the responsible person on www.stadtquartier.nrw.\n\n\"Personal data\" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Personal data therefore includes, for example, a person's name, email address and telephone number, but may also include data about preferences, hobbies and memberships.\n\n\"Processing\" means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, filing, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment, combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.\n\n\"Pseudonymisation\" means the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures which ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n\n\"Consent\" hereinafter means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of consent in the form of a statement or other unambiguous affirmative act by which the data subject signifies his or her agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n\n\"Google\" hereinafter means Google, LLC 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; reachable in the European Union at: Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, Fax: +353 (1) 436?1001.\n\nScope of application\n\nThe data protection declaration applies to all pages of www.stadtquartier.nrw. It does not extend to any linked websites or Internet presences of other providers.\n\nResponsible provider\n\nResponsible for the processing of personal data within the scope of this privacy policy is:\n\nHotel Haan GmbH\n\nNeuer Markt 23, 42781 Haan, Germany\n\nTelephone: +49 (0) 2129/9220\n\nE-mail: info@stadtquartier.nrw\n\n​\n\nQuestions about data protection\n\nIf you have any questions about data protection with regard to our company or our website, you can contact our data protection officer:\n\nSpirit Legal LLP Attorneys at Law\n\nLawyer and data protection officer\n\nPeter Hense\n\nPostal address:\n\nData Protection Officer\n\nc/o Hotel Haan GmbH, Neuer Markt 23, 42781 Haan, Germany\n\nContact via encrypted online form:\n\n[Contact data protection officer]\n\nSecurity\n\nWe have taken comprehensive technical and organisational precautions to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, misuse, loss and other external interference. To this end, we regularly review our security measures and adapt them to the state of the art.\n\nYour rights\n\nYou have the following rights with regard to personal data concerning you, which you can assert against us:\n\nRight of access (Art. 15 DSGVO),\n\nRight to rectification (Art. 16 DSGVO) or deletion (Art. 17 DSGVO),\n\nRight to restriction of processing (Art. 18 DSGVO),\n\nRight to object to processing (Art. 21 GDPR),\n\nRight to withdraw your consent (Art. 7(3) DSGVO),\n\nRight to receive the data in a structured, common, machine-readable format (\"data portability\") as well as the right to have the data transferred to another data controller if the conditions of Art. 20 (1) lit. a, b DSGVO apply (Art. 20 DSGVO).\n\nYou can assert your rights by notifying the contact details listed in the \"Responsible provider\" section or the data protection officer appointed by us.\n\nYou also have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about the processing of your personal data carried out by us (Art. 77 DSGVO).\n\nUse of the website, access data\n\nIn principle, you can use our website for purely informational purposes without disclosing your identity. When you call up the individual pages of the website in this sense, only access data is transmitted to our web space provider so that the website can be displayed to you. This is the following data:\n\nbrowser type/browser version\n\npperating system used\n\nlanguage and version of the browser software\n\nhost name of the accessing end device\n\nIP address\n\nwebsite from which the request comes\n\ncontent of the request (specific page)\n\ndate and time of the server request\n\naccess status/HTTP status code\n\nreferrer URL (the previously visited page)\n\namount of data transferred\n\ntime zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\n\nThe temporary processing of the IP address by the system is necessary to technically enable delivery of the website to your computer. Processing your IP address for the duration of the session is necessary for this. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.\n\nThe access data is not used to identify individual users and is not merged with other data sources. The access data are deleted when they are no longer required to achieve the purpose of their processing. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when you end your visit to the website.\n\nIP addresses are stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, we use the data to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context either. The data is generally deleted after seven days at the latest; processing beyond this is possible in individual cases. In this case, the IP address is deleted or alienated in such a way that it is no longer possible to assign the calling client.\n\nThe collection of data for the provision of the website and the processing of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. You can object to the processing. In the event of your justified objection, we will examine the merits of the case and either discontinue or adjust the data processing or show you our compelling legitimate grounds on the basis of which we will continue the processing.\n\nCookies\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned access data, so-called cookies are stored in the internet browser of the end device you are using when you use the website. These are small text files with a sequence of numbers that are stored locally in the cache of the browser used. Cookies do not become part of the PC system and cannot execute any programs. They are used to make our website user-friendly. The use of cookies may be technically necessary or for other purposes (e.g. analysis/ evaluation of website use).\n\na) Technically necessary cookies\n\nSome elements of our website require that the calling browser can be identified even after a page change. The following data is processed in the cookies:\n\nlanguage settings\n\narticles in the shopping cart\n\nThe user data collected through technically necessary cookies are not processed to create user profiles. We also use so-called \"session cookies,\" which store a session ID with which various requests from your browser can be assigned to the joint session. Session cookies are necessary for the use of the website. In particular, they allow us to recognise the terminal device used when you return to the website. We use this cookie to recognise you on subsequent visits to the website if you have an account with us; otherwise you would have to log in again on each visit. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. We use session cookies to make the use of the website more attractive and effective. The session cookies are deleted as soon as you log out or close the browser.\n\nMost browsers are preset to accept cookies automatically. You can object to the processing of your data by cookies. By changing the settings in your internet browser, you can deactivate or restrict the transfer of cookies. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all functions of the website to their full extent.\n\nb) Technically unnecessary cookies\n\nWe also use cookies on the website that enable an analysis of the user's browsing behaviour. The following data, for example, is stored and processed in the cookies:\n\nsearch terms entered\n\nfrequency of page views\n\nuse of website functions\n\nThese cookies are used to make the use of the website more efficient and attractive. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. The technically unnecessary cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period of time, which may differ depending on the cookie.\n\nYou can object to the processing of your data by cookies. If you do not wish to use cookies, you have the option, by changing your browser settings, to generally or selectively block the placing of cookies or to remove cookies that have already been stored. You can also have corresponding instructions displayed before setting a cookie. If you change the browser settings for the use of cookies or deactivate cookies, the functionality of this website may be limited.\n\nInsofar as we integrate third-party cookies into our website, we will inform you of this separately below.\n\nc) Cookie banner notice\n\nWhen you access the website, you will be informed by an information banner about the use of cookies and referred to this data protection declaration. In this context, you will also be informed how to prevent the storage of cookies in your browser settings.\n\nContacting our company\n\nWhen contacting our company, e.g. by e-mail or via the contact form on the website, the personal data you provide will be processed by us in order to answer your enquiry.\n\nFor the processing of enquiries via the contact form on the website, it is mandatory to provide a name or a pseudonym as well as a valid e-mail address. The following data is also processed at the time the message is sent to us:\n\nIP address\n\ndate/time of registration\n\nThe legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO or Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO if the purpose of the contact is to conclude a contract.\n\nThe processing of the personal data from the input mask serves us solely to process the contact. In the case of contact by e-mail, this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in processing the data. The other personal data processed during the sending process serve to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.\n\nIn this context, the data is not passed on to third parties. The data is processed exclusively for the purpose of processing the conversation. We delete the data accruing in this context after the processing is no longer necessary or restrict the processing to compliance with the existing legally mandatory retention obligations.\n\nYou have the possibility to object to the processing of your personal data for contact requests at any time. This is the case if the processing is not necessary, in particular, for the fulfilment of a contract with you, which is illustrated by us in each case in the preceding description of the functions. In such a case, it may not be possible to continue processing the enquiry. In the event of your justified objection, we will review the situation and either discontinue or adjust the data processing or show you our compelling legitimate grounds on the basis of which we will continue the processing.\n\nProcessing and transfer of personal data for contractual purposes\n\nWe process your personal data if and insofar as this is necessary for the initiation, establishment, execution and/or termination of a legal transaction with our company. The legal basis for this results from Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.\n\nAfter the purpose has been achieved (e.g. processing of the contract), the personal data will be blocked for further processing or deleted, unless we are entitled to further storage and processing required in the respective context on the basis of a consent granted by you (e.g. consent to the processing of the e-mail address for sending electronic advertising mail), a contractual agreement, a legal authorisation (e.g. authorisation to send direct advertising) or on the basis of legitimate interests (e.g. storage for the enforcement of claims).\n\nYour personal data will be disclosed to the extent that it is necessary for the establishment, implementation or termination of legal transactions with our company (e.g. in the case of the transfer of data to a payment service provider/ a shipping company for the processing of a contract with your person), (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO), or\n\na subcontractor or vicarious agent that we use exclusively in the context of providing the offers or services you have requested requires this data (unless you are expressly informed otherwise, such auxiliaries are only authorised to process the data to the extent that this is necessary for the provision of the offer or service), or\n\nthere is an enforceable official order (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c) DSGVO) or\n\nthere is an enforceable court order (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c) DSGVO) or\n\nwe are obliged to do so by law (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c) DSGVO) or\n\nthe processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. d) DSGVO) or\n\nwe are authorised or even obliged to disclose data in order to pursue overriding legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).\n\nYour personal data will not be passed on to other persons, companies or bodies unless you have effectively consented to such a transfer. The legal basis of the processing is then Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) DSGVO.\n\nProcessing and disclosure of personal data in the online ordering system\n\nIf you would like to place an order or booking in our online shop, it is necessary for the initiation and conclusion of the contract that you provide personal data such as your name, address and e-mail address. The mandatory data required for order and contract processing are marked separately, other data are provided voluntarily. We process your data for order processing, in particular we will forward payment data to your chosen payment service provider or our house bank. In the context of your booking or booking request, booking information will also be transferred to external operators of internet booking engines (e.g. TourOnline AG, Borsigstraße 26, 73249, Wernau \"DIRS 21\") for contract fulfilment or preparation. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO. To prevent unauthorised third parties from accessing your personal data, the ordering process on the website is encrypted using SSL/TLS technology.\n\nWe delete the data accruing in this context after storage is no longer necessary or restrict processing if there are statutory retention obligations. Due to mandatory commercial and tax regulations, we are obliged to retain your address, payment and order data for a period of ten years. After two years after termination of the contract, we restrict processing and reduce processing to compliance with existing legal obligations.\n\nRegistration/ Password-protected area of the website\n\nIf you wish to use the password-protected area on our website, you must register using the following information:\n\ne-mail address,\n\nname\n\nusername\n\npassword of your choice\n\nYou are not obliged to use your real name; you are free to use a pseudonym.\n\nFurthermore, the following data is processed at the time of registration:\n\nIP address\n\ndate/time of registration\n\nThe data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were processed. This is the case for the data collected during the registration process when the registration on the website is cancelled or modified.\n\nThe following functions are available to you in the password-protected area:\n\nedit your profile data,\n\nview your orders/bookings,\n\nmanage, change or cancel your newsletter subscription\n\nIf you use the password-protected area of the website, e.g. to edit your profile data or to view orders and bookings made, we also process the personal data required to initiate or fulfil the contract, in particular address data and details of the method of payment. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO. The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was processed or if there are no legitimate interests that prevent its deletion. Due to mandatory commercial and tax regulations, we are obliged to store your address, payment and order data for a period of ten years. After two years after termination of the contract, we restrict processing and reduce processing to compliance with existing legal obligations.\n\nIf you voluntarily provide additional data (e.g. interests, size, age, gender, children, preferences, notepad), we will process your data that is not necessary for the initiation or fulfilment of a contract as long as you use the password-protected area and if you do not delete it yourself beforehand. The purpose of this is to optimise the use of the website for you as a user. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.\n\nYou can object to the processing of your voluntarily provided data. You can manage, change or delete your voluntary data yourself at any time in the password-protected area. You are free to take measures according to the section \"Your rights,\" whereby we ask you to contact our company as a first step in the event of complaints.\n\nProcessing of personal data according to § 30 Federal Registration Act (BMG)\n\nAccommodation establishments, such as hotels in particular, are obliged under Section 30 of the Federal Registration Act (BMG) to collect the following data from the guest on the day of arrival and to have the guest sign the registration form by hand:\n\ndate of arrival and expected departure,\n\nsurnames,\n\nfirst names,\n\ndate of birth,\n\nnationalities,\n\naddress,\n\nnumber of fellow travellers and their nationality in the cases of § 29 paragraph 2 sentence 2 and 3,\n\nserial number of a recognised and valid passport or passport replacement document in the case of foreign persons.\n\nIf applicable, further data for the collection of tourism and health resort fees.\n\nWe are obliged to collect, process and pass on this data within the framework of the BMG, the legal basis for the processing results from Art. 6 Para. 1 s. 1 lit. c) DSGVO.\n\nWe delete this data or restrict processing as soon as it is permissible under the provisions of the BMG and if there is no consent on your part (Art. 6 para. 1 s. 1 lit. a) DSGVO) and no other legitimate interest on our part in continued processing.\n\nEmail marketing\n\nExisting customer advertising\n\nWe reserve the right to process the e-mail address provided by you within the scope of the registration/order/booking in accordance with the statutory provisions to send you the following contents, among others, by e-mail during or following the processing of the contract, provided you have not already objected to this processing of your e-mail address:\n\nfurther interesting offers from our portfolio,\n\ninformation on events organised by our company,\n\ntechnical information,\n\nsending you our catalogue,\n\nquestions about special requests,\n\noverview of possible leisure activities,\n\ninformation on how to reach us via public transport.\n\nLegal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. We carry out the aforementioned processing for customer care and to increase our services. We delete your data when you terminate the newsletter subscription, but no later than two years after termination of the contract.\n\nWe would like to point out that you can object to receiving direct advertising at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates. To do so, click on the unsubscribe link in the newsletter or send us your objection to the contact details stated in the section \"Responsible provider\".\n\nPayment Service Provider (PSP)/ Payment Service Provider\n\nPayPal\n\nOn our website we offer payment via PayPal. The provider of this payment service is PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg (hereinafter: \"PayPal\").\n\nIf you select payment via PayPal, the payment data you enter will be transmitted to PayPal. The transmission of your data to PayPal is based on Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO (processing for the performance of a contract). We have no knowledge of the storage period at PayPal and no possibility to influence it.\n\nPayPal Plus\n\nIf you select the payment method \"Direct debit via PayPal Plus\" or \"Credit card via PayPal Plus\" as part of your booking/order, we forward the personal data collected to PayPal (Europe) S.àr.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg (hereinafter \"PayPal\") as part of the payment processing. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.\n\nPayPal creates an invoice based on the transmitted data and, if necessary, carries out an identity and credit check. In doing so, PayPal has a legitimate interest in the transmission of the buyer's personal data and processes them in order to obtain information from credit agencies for the purpose of checking identity and creditworthiness, Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.\n\nThese may be the agencies named at https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/third-parties-list?locale.x=de_DE and https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/third-parties-list?locale.x=de_DE.\n\nIn the credit assessment, mathematical-statistical procedures are used to calculate a rating with regard to the probability of a payment default (so-called calculation of a scoring value). PayPal bases its decision on the provision of the respective payment methods on the calculated scoring value. The calculation of a scoring value is carried out according to recognised scientific procedures.\n\nIn addition to the address data, information on previous payment behaviour and probability values for expected future payment behaviour are also included. We have no knowledge of the storage period at PayPal and no possibility to influence it.\n\nYou can request information, correction or deletion of the data stored by PayPal at any time and object to the processing of your personal data by PayPal at any time. However, PayPal remains entitled to process and pass on customer data if this is necessary for contractual payment processing (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO) or is required by law, by public authorities or by a court of law (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c) DSGVO).\n\nYou can contact PayPal using the following contact form: https://www.paypal.com/de/selfhelp/contact/email/privacy. For further information on the processing of your data by PayPal, please visit https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full?locale.x=de_DE#r7.\n\nDisclosure of personal data for the purpose of legal enforcement / address determination / debt collection\n\nIn the event of non-payment, we reserve the right to pass on the data provided when ordering/booking to a lawyer and/or to external companies (e.g. Verband der Vereine Creditreform e.V., Hellersbergstraße 12, D-41460 Neuss) for purposes of address determination and/or legal enforcement if there is a justified interest in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.\n\nIn addition, we may pass on your data if this is necessary to protect our rights and the rights of our affiliated companies, our cooperation partners, our employees and/or the users of our website. Under no circumstances will we sell or rent your data to third parties. The transfer of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.\n\nWe delete the data accruing in this context after the storage is no longer necessary or restrict the processing if there are legal retention obligations.\n\nYou have the option to object to the processing of your data at any time. This is the case if the processing is not necessary, in particular, for the fulfilment of a contract with you, which is shown by us in each case in the preceding description of the functions. In the event of your justified objection, we will review the situation and either discontinue or adjust the data processing or show you our compelling legitimate grounds on the basis of which we will continue the processing.\n\nHosting\n\nWe use external hosting services to provide the following services: Infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage resources and database services, security as well as technical maintenance services. All data required for the operation and use of our website is processed.\n\nWe use external hosting services for the operation of this website. By using external hosting services, we aim to provide our website efficiently and securely. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.\n\nThe collection of data for the provision and use of the website and the processing of the data via external web hosts is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. You can object to the processing. In the event of your justified objection, we will examine the merits of the case and either discontinue or adapt the data processing or show you our compelling legitimate grounds on the basis of which we will continue the processing.\n\nIntegration of third-party content\n\nThird-party content such as videos, maps, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites are integrated on the website. This integration always requires that the providers of this content (\"third-party providers\") are aware of the IP addresses of the users. Without the IP address, they cannot send the content to the browser of the respective user. The IP address is thus necessary for the display of this content.\n\nWe endeavour to only use content from third-party providers who only process the IP address to deliver the content. However, we have no influence if the third-party providers process the IP addresses, e.g. for statistical purposes. Insofar as we are aware of this, we will inform you of this below.\n\nSome of the third-party providers may process data outside the European Union.\n\nYou can object by installing a JavaScript blocker such as the browser plug-in 'NoScript' (www.noscript.net) or by deactivating JavaScript in your browser.\n\nHowever, this may result in functional restrictions on the website.\n\nGoogle Web Fonts\n\nWe use so-called web fonts provided by Google for the uniform display of fonts. When you call up a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into its browser cache in order to display texts and fonts correctly.\n\nFor this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to Google's servers. This informs Google that our website has been accessed via your IP address. Google Web Fonts are used in the interest of a uniform and appealing presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO. We have no knowledge of the storage period at Google and no possibility to influence it.\n\nYou can object to the processing by changing the browser settings so that the browser does not support web fonts - in this case, however, a standard font will be used by your computer.\n\nFurther information on Google Web Fonts can be found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google's privacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\n\nGoogle Tag Manager\n\nWe use Google Tag Manager on our website. Google Tag Manager is a solution that allows marketers to manage website tags through one interface. The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not collect any personal data. The tool triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If a deactivation has been made at domain or cookie level, this remains in place for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager.\n\nAdobe Typekit\n\nWe use Adobe Typekit for the uniform display of fonts. The provider of the Adobe Typekit components is Adobe Systems Software Ireleand Ltd, 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Ireland. When you call up a page, your browser loads the required fonts into its browser cache in order to display texts and fonts correctly.\n\nFor this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to Adobe's servers. This enables Adobe to know that our website has been accessed via your IP address. Adobe Typekit also processes your personal data in the USA and has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework. Further information and the applicable privacy policy of Adobe Typekit can be found at https://www.adobe.com/de/privacy/policy.html.\n\nThe use of Adobe Typekit fonts is in the interest of a uniform and appealing presentation of our online offers. The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. We have no knowledge of the storage period at Adobe and no possibility to influence it.\n\nYou can object to the processing by changing the browser settings so that the browser does not support Adobe Typekit fonts - in this case, however, a standard font will be used by your computer.\n\nFor more information about Adobe Typekit, please visit https://typekit.com/help and see Adobe's privacy policy at https://www.adobe.com/de/privacy/policy.html.\n\nAddThis-Bookmarking\n\nThe website includes plug-ins from AddThis, a service of AddThis Inc. (1595 Spring Hill Rd, Suite 300, Vienna, VA 22182; hereinafter \"AddThis\").\n\nThese plug-ins allow you to set bookmarks or share interesting content with other users. Through the plug-ins, we offer you the opportunity to interact with social networks and other users so that we can improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.\n\nVia these plug-ins, your internet browser establishes a direct connection with the servers of AddThis and, if applicable, the selected social network or bookmarking service. The recipients receive the information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online offer and the data mentioned in the section \"Use of the website, access data.” This information is processed on AddThis servers in the USA.

Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles, whereby you must contact the respective plug-in provider to exercise this right.\n\nThe legal basis for the use of the plug-ins is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. We have no knowledge of the storage period at AddThis and no possibility to influence it.\n\nIf you do not wish to participate in this procedure, you can object to the data processing at any time by setting an opt-out cookie with effect for the future: http://www.addthis.com/privacy/opt-out.\n\nThe opt-out cookie is set for the named domain in the browser used. If you use different end devices, change the browser after opting out or delete all cookies, you must set the opt-out cookie again using the activation link mentioned above.\n\nAlternatively, you can set your browser to prevent cookies from being set.\n\nFurther information on the purpose and scope of processing by the plug-in provider as well as further information on your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy can be found at www.addthis.com/privacy.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nThis website also uses Google’s \"Google Maps\" service to display maps or map sections, thus enabling you to conveniently use the map function on the website.\n\nBy visiting the website, Google receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding sub-page of our website. In addition, the data mentioned in the section \"Access data\" will be transmitted to Google. This occurs regardless of whether Google provides a user account via which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly assigned to your account. If you do not wish your data to be associated with your Google profile, you must log out before activating the button.\n\nGoogle stores your data as usage profiles and processes them for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or the needs-based design of its website. Such an evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged in) to provide needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our website.\n\nThe legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. The processing serves to make our website more attractive and to offer you additional service.

Further information on the Google Maps Terms of Use can be found at https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html.\n\nYou have a right to object to the processing, and you must contact Google to exercise this right. You can deactivate or restrict the transfer of cookies by changing the settings in your internet browser. Cookies that have already been stored can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all functions of the website to their full extent.\n\nServices for statistical, analytical and marketing purposes\n\nWe use third-party services for statistical, analytical and marketing purposes. This enables us to provide you a user-friendly, optimised use of the website. The third-party providers use cookies to control their services (see the section \"Cookies\" above). Personal data is not processed, unless otherwise explained below.\n\nSome of the third-party providers offer the possibility to directly object to the use of the respective service, e.g. by setting an opt-out cookie.\n\nIf you activate a corresponding opt-out cookie, the external provider will no longer process any data on your usage behaviour in the future. A merely selective objection to an individually made selection of external services is also possible. If you change the browser or the end device used or delete all cookies, you must set the opt-out cookie again.\n\nFurthermore, you can also opt out of the use of cookies via the opt-out platform of the Bundesverband Digitale Wirtschaft e.V.

Google Analytics uses so-called \"cookies\" (see section \"Cookies\" above), which are stored on your computer and enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated about your use of this website is transferred to a Google server in the USA and processed there.\n\nIn the event that IP anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will use this information on our behalf for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.\n\nThe IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.\n\nThis website uses Google Analytics with the extension \"_anonymizeIp()\". This means that IP addresses are processed in abbreviated form, which means that they cannot be linked to a specific person. If the data collected about you is related to a person, this is immediately excluded, and the personal data is deleted immediately.\n\nWe use Google Analytics to analyse and regularly improve the use of our website. The statistics enable us to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.
