        "text": "ZIP codes are five-digit numbers (sometimes nine) that identify geographic regions for delivering mail in the U.S., such as the famous 90210 in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nPostal codes in Canada are essentially the same thing, except they have six characters consisting of letters and numbers (e.g., L2E 6X5). Theyâ€™re also used for collecting census data and planning delivery routes.\n\nCanadians may be asked to provide a U.S. ZIP code for credit card purchases. Itâ€™s not always required, but there are a few scenarios when you will need one.\n\nBuying Gas in the U.S.\n\nGas stations in the U.S. generally require a valid ZIP code when youâ€™re paying at the pump with a credit card. Itâ€™s a security measure to confirm that youâ€™re authorized to use the card.\n\nShopping in the U.S.\n\nCredit card issuers sometimes prompt you to put in a ZIP code at stores in the U.S. for security purposes. Retailers may ask for a ZIP code, but itâ€™s typically not required for in-store purchases.\n\nRelated: Best Store Credit Cards\n\nShopping Online from a U.S.-Based Website\n\nU.S.-based websites usually request a ZIP code during checkout. If the code you enter when prompted doesnâ€™t match the one your credit card company has on file, the transaction will be declined.\n\nConverting your postal code to a ZIP code makes it easy to charge just about anything to your credit card, but you could be spending more than you think. Thatâ€™s because U.S. purchases add charges to your credit card bill you may not have budgeted for. Here are the most common:\n\nExchange Rates\n\nExchange rates determine how much youâ€™re spending in Canadian dollars for what youâ€™re buying in the U.S. If the CAD/USD exchange rate is 74 cents U.S., youâ€™re paying around CAD$1.35 per U.S. dollar. This means a USD$30 purchase will actually cost you CAD$40.59.\n\nBanks and credit cards charge a slight markup on daily exchange rates. Itâ€™s worth comparing the cost of exchanging cash or letting your credit card issuer handle the conversion. If your bank has a global ATM network, youâ€™ll likely be charged fewer fees for withdrawing U.S. cash.\n\nCurrency Conversion Fees\n\nCurrency conversion fees are applied to each transaction converted from one currency to another. These fees show up on your statement after the credit card network converts purchases made in U.S. dollars.\n\nIf you want to pay in Canadian dollars, merchants will charge a dynamic currency conversion (DCC) fee at the point of sale. This fee is often higher than standard currency conversions, which are typically around 1%. Making purchases in the local currency will usually always save you money.\n\nForeign Transaction Fees\n\nForeign transaction fees are a surcharge for purchases processed outside of Canada. The amount is set by your credit card issuer and ranges from 1% to 3%. Paying up to $3 for every $100 you spend on top of regular exchange rates can quickly increase the overall cost of a trip.\n\nThere are credit cards with no foreign exchange fees. These cards can help you keep more money in your pocket and potentially earn points or cash back on your purchases."
