        "meta_description": "The postal code, often referred to as a postcode or ZIP code, is the fundamental, essential element of a postal address. It is a unique identifier that unambiguously identifies an addressee's location and assists in the transmission, sorting and delivery of mail items. A postal code usually consists of a sequence of letters and numbers, or numbers only, and is appended to the end of an address.Despite the relatively small size of the Republic",

        "text": "Despite the relatively small size of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (T&T), not everyone is aware of the location of towns, communities and villages. In many instances, directions depend on ‘word of mouth’ and the use of landmarks. There is a dependence on casual locational systems that is highly unreliable when used to locate an address. Notably, because of increases in population and a surge in housing developments and industrialisation in areas of the country previously uninhabited, these casual locational systems are no longer functional.\n\nThe postal services (e.g. TTPost, FEDEX, DHL) will benefit in the following ways:\n\n• Improved efficiency and accuracy of locating addresses and improved mail delivery.\n\n• Optimisation of resource allocation such as delivery personnel and vehicles.\n\n• Saving on time and operating costs.\n\n• Reduction in returned, undelivered and misdirected mail.\n\n• Potential for the automation of mail sorting procedures.\n\n• Creation of postal code products such as postal code and address databases.\n\nThe private sector (Insurance companies, financial institutions and businesses that offer delivery e.g. Courts, KFC, etc.) will benefit from a postal code system through:\n\n• Improved product delivery and location of addresses, which would allow businesses to effectively locate and reach their customers (e.g. marketing agencies).\n\n• Promotion of e-commerce through the facilitation of online transactions and internet purchasing.\n\n• Efficient address location, particularly beneficial to service providers.\n\n• Increased competitiveness on the global market via efficient address location (e.g. in response to increased internet purchasing).\n\nThe public services (e.g. Inland Revenue, TSTT, WASA, T&TEC, EBC, Fire and Police Services) will benefit in the following ways:\n\n• Improved billing and customer service.\n\n• Improved management of epidemics, internal migration and primary health care.\n\n• Improved response time of emergency vehicles through quicker location of distressed callers.\n\nEach segment of the postal code, when read from left to right, provides step-by-step information regarding the destination of the mail item. The postal code narrows down the item’s destination to a small geographic\n\narea/point.\n\nDescription of Postal Code Segments\n\nPOSTAL CODE: 120110\n\n12 01 10\n\nThe first two digits (12) point to the Postal District and they identify the main TTPost delivery office which will process the mail. In this case, 12 would go to the Diego Martin delivery office. The second two digits (01) point to an area within the postal district called the Delivery Loop. They tell the delivery office which postal route will deliver the mail item. In this case, it is Route number 01 in the Diego Martin postal district. The last two digits (01) point to either a zone or building within the delivery loop. They identify the geographic location of a group of addresses or the address of large institutions.\n\nTTPost is committed to a policy of not changing postal codes/addresses wherever possible. Changes will only be made to benefit the service given to the customer, or when it is absolutely necessary, for example:\n\n• A new TTPost delivery office is opened.\n\n• TTPost has exhausted postal codes for new homes and businesses in a developing area.\n\n• Local Government has prompted a change by re-numbering buildings or re-naming roads.\n\nTTPost will always write to you to inform you about any changes that are planned. From the time that we notify you of any changes, our sorting system will recognise both your old and new postal codes. This should give you ample time to use up stocks of stationery and notify your customers, friends and relations of the change (although we recommend that you switch to your new postal code as soon as possible).\n\nI’m moving. Will I keep the same postal code from my previous address?\n\nIn general, a postal code identifies a group of addresses. So if your business is moving to a larger premises next door then you may well have the same postal code, but if you are moving from your house to another town, then your postal code will change. The postal code is specific to the address and not to you or your business.\n\nIt is the intention of TTPost to provide every house and business in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago with a complete postal address that would help them deliver mail quickly, accurately and cost effectively.\n\nFor additional information please contact: postcode@ttpost.net"
