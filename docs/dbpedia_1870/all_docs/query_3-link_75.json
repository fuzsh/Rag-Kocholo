        "text": "To help prevent fraud, we validate the postal code for the billing address you provide when completing your purchase from our website via our payment processor, Stripe.\n\nWhat can I do when my postal code fails validation?\n\nDouble-check the details on file with your bank\n\nOur payment processor (Stripe) can sometimes be picky with postal codes. If the postal code is rejected, it’s because your bank is telling us that the postal code doesn’t match the one it has on file for you. Please note that we need the billing address for the card, which can be different than your home address. This is especially true for workplace-issued cards. If you’ve recently moved, it can sometimes take the bank a while to update to the correct postal code. You may want to check with your bank to make sure they have the correct address on file for you.Â\n\nTry the PayPal option\n\nYou may have better luck using the PayPal option when completing the order. You don’t even need a PayPal account– just enter your card details on the next page after selecting PayPal as your payment method.\n\nIt appears that I was charged, but my order never completed\n\nIf your postal code fails validation and you see a charge on your account, note that this just an Authorization Hold. No funds have been taken from your account. When an order fails, the authorization automatically drops off of your account after a set amount of time. Generally this happens within 24 hours, but it ultimately depends on your bank’s policy. Check your account tomorrow and you’ll likely see that the authorization is gone. If it’s not, check with your bank. They will likely have their own specific policy regarding Authorization Holds. More information about Authorization Holds can be found here.\n\nIf all else fails, email us"
