An attorney who is not currently a member in good standing of the Utah State Bar must present a written or oral motion for admission pro hac vice made by an active member in good standing of the Utah State Bar. Communication with and service on local counsel shall be deemed to be communication with and service on the party so represented.\n\nR305-7-107. Proceeding Conducted by Teleconference or Other Electronic Means; Records of Hearings.\n\n(1) All parties shall be present in person, or through an authorized representative (see R305-7-106), at an evidentiary hearing, if applicable.\n\n(2) A party may participate in oral argument on a dispositive motion or oral argument on the merits of a special adjudicative proceeding by teleconference or other electronic means if:\n\n(a) all other parties stipulate to participation by teleconference or other electronic means; and\n\n(b) the ALJ approves the stipulation.\n\n(3) A party may participate in any other hearing or conference on a dispositive motion or a hearing on the merits of a permit review adjudicative proceeding by teleconference or other electronic means if all other parties stipulate to participation by teleconference or other electronic means.\n\n(4)(a) Hearings in all adjudicative proceedings that are subject to review by the Executive Director shall be recorded in order to preserve the record.\n\n(b) Hearings that are not subject to review by the Executive Director, such as status and scheduling conferences, need not be recorded. In such cases, the notice of hearing will indicate that the hearing is not scheduled to be of record. If a party objects, a record of the hearing will be made in accordance with subpart (c).\n\n(c) The Director is responsible for recording hearings of record, using audio recording equipment. Audio files of such hearings will become part of the adjudicative record.\n\n(d) Any party may request that a court reporter be employed for the hearing, which request shall be granted by the ALJ. Unless otherwise stipulated by the parties, the requesting party shall bear the cost associated with the use of a court reporter. Any such requests shall be submitted to the ALJ at least 10 business days before the scheduled hearing. In the event that a court reporter is employed, the transcript of proceedings will become a public record and part of the adjudicative record of the proceeding. As a result, the court reporter shall not be allowed to claim any copyright on the transcript. The party engaging the court reporter will be responsible for obtaining a full release of the transcript.\n\nR305-7-108. Modifying Requirements of Rules.\n\n(1) Except as provided in R305-7-108(2), the requirements of this Rule may be modified by order of the ALJ for good cause, provided the modification is not inconsistent with applicable statutory provisions.\n\n(2) The following requirements may not be modified:\n\n(a) the requirements for timely filing a Petition for Review under R305-7-203(5) and 205 for a special adjudicative proceeding;\n\n(b) the requirements for timely filing a Request for Agency Action under R305-7-303(5) for a proceeding other than a special adjudicative proceeding;\n\n(c) the requirements for timely filing a Petition to Intervene under R305-7-204(2) and 205 for a special adjudicative proceeding; and\n\n(d) the requirements for timely filing a Petition to Intervene under R305-7-304 (which incorporates the requirements of R305-7-204(2)) for a proceeding other than a special adjudicative proceeding.\n\nR305-7-109. Default.\n\n(1) The provision controlling default under UAPA, Section 63G-4-209, governs default under special adjudicative proceedings as well as proceedings under UAPA, including enforcement proceedings. However, a petitioner in a special adjudicative proceeding is not allowed to file a Request[request] for Agency Action[agency action]. Instead, a petitioner in a special adjudicative proceeding must file a Petition for Review. Therefore, if a petitioner in a special adjudicative proceeding improperly files a Request[request] for Agency Action[agency action] a respondent is not required to answer it. In addition, a respondent in a special adjudicative proceeding is not required to file a response to a Petition for Review under Section 63G-4-209(1)(c). However, a party in a special adjudicative proceeding who does not file a brief as required Section 19-1-301.5(8) may be held in default. See Section 19-1-301.5(10)(c).\n\n(2) A default order shall include a statement of the grounds for default and shall be filed with the Administrative Proceedings Records Officer and shall be served on all parties.\n\n(3) A defaulted party may seek to have the default set aside according to procedures set forth in the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. A motion to set aside a default and any subsequent order shall be made to the ALJ.\n\nR305-7-110. Limitation on Authority under Rule.\n\nNothing in this Rule constitutes a grant of authority for any person other than the recipient to challenge a Notice of Violation or to initiate an action to challenge or require a Director's[the agency's] enforcement either generally or in a specific situation. See UAPA, Sections 63G-4-102(8) and 63G-4-201(3).\n\nR305-7-111. No Limitation on Authority to Bring Action or Undertake Investigations.\n\n(1) Nothing in this Rule shall be read as a limitation on a Director's[either of the agency's] statutory authority to bring an emergency proceeding or a judicial proceeding under either UAPA, Section 63G-4-502, or under the Department of Environmental Quality Code, Utah Code Ann. Title 19. It shall also not be read as a limitation on the procedures a Director[the agency] may use for an emergency proceeding under those authorities.\n\n(2) Failure in this Rule to provide administrative procedures for an administrative action that is authorized by statute shall not be read as a limitation of a Director's[the agency's] authority to bring that action.\n\nR305-7-112. Procedures Not Addressed.\n\nIn the event there are [authorities or ]situations for which procedures are not prescribed by th is[ese] Rule[rules], the ALJ shall, for a specific case, identify analogous procedures or other procedures that will apply.[ If the proceeding is conducted under the authority of Section 19-1-301, it shall be conducted formally under UAPA.]\n\nR305-7-113. Applicability of UAPA.\n\n(1) Special adjudicative proceedings are exempt from UAPA except as specifically provided in Section 19-1-301.5. See Section 19-1-301.5(3).\n\n(2) With respect to all other orders:\n\n(a) Initial Orders and Notices of Violation issued by the Director are exempt from the requirements of UAPA, as provided in Section 63G-4-102(2)(k).\n\n(b) A proceeding to challenge an Initial Order or a Notice of Violation is subject to the requirements of UAPA , except as modified pursuant to this Rule.\n\n(3) Neither UAPA nor this Rule applies to requests for government records or requests for confidentiality of government records. Those matters are governed by the Utah Government Records Access and Management Act, Sections 63G-2-101 through 901, and by Section 19-1-306.\n\nR305-7-114. Prosecution of Actions; Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute.\n\n(1) The party seeking relief is responsible for prosecuting administrative proceedings under this Rule.\n\n(2) Unless the parties otherwise agree, if no request for appointment of an ALJ under R305-7-206(2) has been filed within three months after the filing date of a Request for Agency Action or Petition for Review, the Executive Director may serve a written notification to the parties stating that, absent a showing of good cause by a date specified in the notification, the Executive Director shall dismiss the adjudication for lack of prosecution. A Director may also file a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute under this subsection to the Executive Director. In either case, unless good cause is demonstrated, the Executive Director shall dismiss such Request for Agency Action or Petition for Review.\n\n(3) In any adjudicative proceeding in any matter governed by this Rule where an ALJ has been appointed, the Director may file a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute. Unless, after notice, the party seeking relief shows good cause for delay, the ALJ shall enter an order recommending that the Executive Director dismiss the proceeding for lack of prosecution.\n\nR305-7-200. Retrospective Construction and Interpretation.\n\n(1) SB 282 and SB 173 (Gen. Session 2015) modified Section 19-1-301.5 permit review adjudicative procedures effective May 12, 2015. Because the revisions are procedural, they shall be accorded retrospective construction in the sense that they will be applied to pending actions and proceedings, as well as to future actions but will not be so applied as to defeat procedural steps completed before the effective date of May 12, 2015.\n\n(2) Because the 2018 amendments to this Rule are procedural in nature, they shall apply to all matters pending before the Executive Director.\n\nR305-7-201. Scope of Rule; Purpose of Part.\n\nPart 2 of this Rule (R305-7-201 through 217) specifies procedures to be used in a special adjudicative proceeding, as authorized under Section 19-1-301.5.\n\nR305-7-202. Notice and Comment and Exhaustion of Remedies.\n\n(1) As provided in 19-1-301.5(4), if a public comment period is provided during the permit application process, a person who challenges a Permit Order, including the permit applicant, may only raise an issue or argument during the special adjudicative proceeding that:\n\n(a) the person raised during the public comment period; and\n\n(b) was supported with sufficient information or documentation to enable the Director to fully consider the substance and significance of the issue.\n\n(2) Any supporting materials which are submitted shall be included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they are already part of the Administrative Record in the same proceeding, or consist of state or federal statutes, regulations or rules, EPA documents of general applicability, or other generally available reference materials.\n\n(3) The relevance of and the relevant portions of any supporting materials included with or incorporated by reference in comments shall be described with reasonable specificity.\n\n(4) In preparing a comment response document, the Director may request that the permit applicant provide information in response to comments received during the public comment period.\n\nR305-7-203. Petitions for Review.\n\n(1) Permit orders may be contested by filing and serving a written Petition for Review as provided in R305-7-104(5).\n\n(2) Any Petition for Review shall meet all of the requirements of UAPA, Section 63G-4-201(3)(a) and (3)(b), and the requirements of Section 19-1-301.5. See Section 19-1-301.5(6)(d).\n\n(3) A Petition for Review shall be in writing, shall be signed by the person making the Petition for Review, or by that person's representative, and shall include:\n\n(a) the names and addresses of all persons to whom a copy of the Petition for Review is being sent;\n\n(b) the Director's file number or other reference number, if known;\n\n(c) the date that the Petition for Review was mailed;\n\n(d) a statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which review is requested;\n\n(e) a statement of petitioner's position, including as applicable:\n\n(i) the legal authority under which the Petition for Review is requested;\n\n(ii) the legal authority under which the Executive Director has jurisdiction to review the Petition for Review;\n\n(iii) each of the petitioner's arguments in support of the petitioner's requested relief;\n\n(iv) an explanation of how each argument described in Section 19-1-301.5(6)(d)(v)(D) was preserved;\n\n(v) a detailed description of any permit condition to which the petitioner is objecting;\n\n(vi) any modification or addition to a permit that the petitioner is requesting;\n\n(vii) a demonstration that the Director's permit decision is based on a finding of fact or conclusion of law that is clearly erroneous;\n\n(viii) if the Director addressed a finding of fact or conclusion of law described in Section 19-1-301.5(6)(d)(v)(G) in a response to public comment, a citation to the comment and response that relates to the finding of fact or conclusion of law and an explanation of why the Director's response was clearly erroneous or otherwise warrants review; and\n\n(ix) a claim for relief.\n\n(4) It is not sufficient under Section 63G-4-201(3) to file and serve a general statement of disagreement, a reservation of rights to serve a Petition for Review, or a request to have the matter heard.\n\n(5) To be timely, a Petition for Review to contest a Permit Order shall be, within 30 days of the date the Permit Order being challenged was issued:\n\n(a) received for filing by the Administrative Proceedings Records Officer at the address specified in R305-7-104(4)(c) of this Rule;\n\n(b) received by the Director at the address specified in Part 6; and\n\n(c) served as provided in R305-7-104(2), (4) and (5).\n\n(6) Failure to file a Petition for Review within the period specified in R305-7-104(5) waives any right to contest the permit order or to seek judicial review.\n\nR305-7-204. Intervention.\n\n(1) A person who seeks to intervene in a special adjudicative proceeding under this section shall file and serve:\n\n(a) a Petition to Intervene that:\n\n(i) meets the requirements of Section 63G-4-207(1); and\n\n(ii) demonstrates that the person is entitled to intervention under Section 19-1-301.5(7)(c)(ii); and\n\n(b) a timely Petition for Review.\n\n(2) To be timely, a Petition to Intervene shall, within 30 days after the day on which the Permit Order being challenged was issued, be:\n\n(a) received by the Administrative Proceedings Records Officer at the address specified in R305-7-104(4)(c) of this Rule;\n\n(b) received by the Director at the address specified in Part 6;\n\n(c) served on all other parties as provided in R305-7-104(4).\n\nR305-7-205. Extensions of Time for Filing Petitions for Review and Petitions to Intervene.\n\nThe time for filing a Petition for Review or a Petition to Intervene may be extended only by stipulation of the parties and only if such stipulation is received for filing before the expiration of the time for filing the Petition for Review or Petition to Intervene. If a person seeking an extension of time to file a Petition for Review or a Petition to Intervene is a prospective interventor, the time for filing a Petition for Review or Petition to Intervene may be extended only by stipulation of the parties and the prospective intervenor, and only if such stipulation is received for filing before the expiration of the time for filing the Petition for Review or Petition to Intervene.\n\nR305-7-206. Proceedings After a Petition for Review is Filed.\n\n(1) After a Petition for Review has been filed, the parties are encouraged to meet to attempt to resolve the matter.\n\n(2)(a) Any party may at any time file a request for appointment of an ALJ. An ALJ will not ordinarily be appointed until requested by a party, although the Executive Director may appoint an ALJ at any time.\n\n(b) A request for appointment of an ALJ shall be filed as provided in R305-7-104(2)(a), and served as provided in R305-7-104(2)(b).\n\n(3) After an ALJ is appointed, the ALJ shall review and respond to the Petition for Review in accordance with Subsections 63G-4-201(3)(d) and (e).\n\n(4) Unless the parties stipulate or the ALJ orders otherwise following a motion, the Director shall file and serve the Administrative Record, as provided in R305-7-209, within 40 days after the day on which the Executive Director issues a notice of appointment of an administrative law judge.\n\n(5) The schedule and page limits for briefing on the merits specified in Subsection 19-1-301.5(8)(a) shall apply except as otherwise stipulated by the parties and coordinated with the ALJ in accordance with R305-7-208(6).\n\n(6) Dispositive Motions. The schedule for submission of dispositive motions specified in Subsection 19-1-301.5(8)(a) shall apply unless otherwise stipulated by the parties. However, without stipulation or order, dispositive motions may be submitted in advance of the schedule specified in Subsection 19-1-301.5(8)(a). Any issue or argument that could be raised in a dispositive motion is not waived by failure to file such a motion, but may be raised during the briefing on the merits. See R305-7-212.\n\n(7) Subsection 19-1-301.5(13) is explained as follows. For each issue or argument that is not dismissed or otherwise resolved under Subsection 19-1-301.5(11)(b) or (12), the ALJ shall:\n\n(a) provide the parties an opportunity for briefing and oral argument in accordance with Subsection 19-1-301.5(8);\n\n(b) conduct a review of the Director's order or determination, based on the record as described in Subsection 19-1-301.5(9)(b)(c), and (10)(e); and\n\n(c) within 60 days after the day on which oral argument takes place, or, if there is no oral argument, within 60 days after the day on which the reply brief is due, the ALJ shall submit to the Executive Director a proposed dispositive action, that includes:\n\n(i) written findings of fact;\n\n(ii) written conclusions of law; and\n\n(iii) a recommended order.\n\nR305-7-207. Parties.\n\n(1) The following are parties to a special adjudicative proceeding:\n\n(a) the Director who issued the Permit Order being challenged in the special adjudicative proceeding;\n\n(b)(i) the permittee; or\n\n(ii) the person who applied for the permit, if the permit was denied; and\n\n(c) a person granted intervention by the ALJ.\n\n(2) A person who has filed a Petition to Intervene that has not been denied is not a party, but will be treated as a party for purposes of this Rule (e.g., for purposes of service, making motions and settlement) unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ.\n\nR305-7-208. Conferences, Proceedings and Order.\n\n(1) The ALJ may hold one or more conferences for the purposes of:\n\n(a) identifying and, if possible, narrowing the issues that will be considered;\n\n(b) determining whether an issue will be considered through a dispositive motion or during the briefing on the merits;\n\n(c) establishing schedules for the filing of motions and briefs;\n\n(d) considering stipulations of fact or law; and\n\n(e) considering any other matters.\n\n(2) The ALJ shall promptly issue an order memorializing any determinations made about the matters considered in a conference.\n\n(3) The ALJ may at any time order a party to make a more clear statement of the issues the party intends to raise.\n\n(4) The ALJ may:\n\n(a) require the parties to submit proposed schedules for the proceeding; and\n\n(b) to the extent allowed by Section 19-1-301.5 and R305-7-208(6), change deadlines and page limits for submissions established by this Rule.\n\n(5) The parties may request the ALJ hold a conference for the purpose of addressing the matters described in R305-7-208(1).\n\n(6) Stipulated Scheduling Orders. The ALJ shall issue scheduling orders following Section 19-1-301.5 for the administrative record, briefing and page limits, and dispositive motions that shall apply unless the parties file stipulations for alternative scheduling and page limitations. The ALJ shall promptly adopt such timely filed stipulations in applicable scheduling orders unless the ALJ is not available on the stipulated hearing date or questions the necessity of the stipulated brief lengths.\n\n(a) Stipulated Hearing Date. If the ALJ is not available on the stipulated hearing date, the ALJ shall confer with the parties to determine a mutually acceptable date and shall specify the mutually acceptable date in applicable scheduling orders.\n\n(b) Stipulated Over-Length Briefs. If the ALJ questions the necessity of the stipulated over-length briefs, the ALJ may require the parties to state with specificity the issues to be briefed, the number of additional pages requested, and the good cause for allowing over-length briefs. The ALJ may promptly refuse to adopt or may promptly modify through order the parties' stipulation for over-length briefs if the parties fail to show good cause.\n\nR305-7-209. Administrative Record.\n\n(1) To the extent they relate to the issues and arguments raised in the Petition for Review, the Administrative Record shall consist of the following items, if they exist:\n\n(a) the permit application, draft permit, and final permit;\n\n(b) each statement of basis, fact sheet, engineering review, or other substantive explanation designated by the Director as part of the basis for the decision relating to the Permit Order;\n\n(c) the notice and record of each public comment period;\n\n(d) the notice and record of each public hearing, including oral comments made during the public hearing;\n\n(e) written comments submitted during the public comment period;\n\n(f) responses to comments that are designated by the Director as part of the basis for the decision relating to the Permit Order;\n\n(g) any information that is:\n\n(i) requested by and submitted to the Director; and\n\n(ii) designated by the Director as part of the basis for the decision relating to the Permit Order;\n\n(h) any additional information specified by rule;\n\n(i) any additional documents agreed to by the parties; and\n\n(j) information supplementing the record under Section 19-1-301.5(9)(c) or R305-7-210.\n\n(2) If there has been no notice and comment period for a Permit Order, information that is submitted with the Petition for Review shall be deemed to be part of the Administrative Record as shall information submitted in any response to the Petition for Review.\n\n(3)(a) The Director shall prepare the record by compiling it in chronological order, numbering each page and preparing an index.\n\n(b) The Director shall, within 40 days of service of the Notice of Appointment, or as otherwise provided in R305-7-206;\n\n(i) file and serve an electronic copy of the record in accordance with the requirements of R305-7-104; or\n\n(ii) make a paper copy of the record available for review during normal working hours, and file and serve a copy of the record's index as provided in R305-7-104.\n\n(4) Any challenges to the Administrative Record shall be made by motion within 10 business days of the date the record or index is served under paragraph (3)(b).\n\nR305-7-210. Response to Supplemental Information.\n\nIf the Administrative Record is supplemented with additional information as described in R305-7-209(1)(i) or (j), the other parties may, in response, serve and file additional information specific to the supplemental information, which shall also be part of the Administrative Record. The additional information may not raise any new matters not raised in the supplemental information.\n\nR305-7-211. Motions.\n\n(1) A motion shall be made in writing, and shall include the grounds upon which it is based and the relief or order sought. A separate memorandum in support of the motion is not required.\n\n(2) Any response to a motion shall be filed within 21 days of service of the motion.\n\n(3) Any reply to a response to a motion may be filed within 10 days of service of the response. A reply shall be limited to matters raised in the response.\n\n(4) A motion may not exceed 20 pages. If a separate memorandum in support of a motion is filed, the motion and memorandum together shall not exceed 20 pages. A response may not exceed 15 pages. A reply may not exceed ten pages.\n\n(5) Deadlines and page limits may be modified by order of the ALJ.\n\n(6) Any determination by the ALJ that is dispositive shall be forwarded to the Executive Director in the form of a recommended decision.\n\n(7) See also R305-7-206(6) and R305-7-212 regarding issues and arguments not raised by motion.\n\nR305-7-212. Challenges to a Petition to Intervene or to Failure to Preserve an Issue.\n\n(1) A challenge to a Petition to Intervene under Section 19-1-301.5(7) or to a party's failure to preserve an issue under Section 19-1-301.5(4) and (6)(c) may be made by motion or may be made in the parties' briefs on the merits.\n\n(2) If a challenge under paragraph (1) relies on a significant portion of the evidence or arguments that must be considered to make a determination on the merits, the party making the challenge under paragraph (1) is encouraged to do so in the brief on the merits.\n\n(3) The ALJ may defer ruling on a motion under paragraph (1) until the ALJ makes a decision on the merits of the case if the ALJ finds that the motion relies on a significant portion of the evidence or arguments that must be considered to make a determination on the merits.\n\nR305-7-213. Procedures for Determination on the Merits.\n\n(1) Requirements for briefs on the merits in a special adjudicative proceeding are as follows:\n\n(a) The schedule and page limits specified in Section 19-1-301.5(8)(a) shall apply except as otherwise stipulated by the parties and ordered by the ALJ in accordance with R305-7-208;\n\n(b) Any page incorporated by reference from the administrative or adjudicative record shall count toward a page limitation;\n\n(c) The table of contents, table of citations, and any addendum containing statutes, rules, regulations or portions of the administrative record cited do not count toward the page limitation;\n\n(d) All statements of fact shall be supported by references to the pages in the administrative record in which the evidence is identified;\n\n(e) Matters addressed in the petition but not in the opening brief shall be waived;\n\n(f) Matters not addressed in the petition may not be raised in the opening brief.\n\n(2) A reply or a surreply brief may not raise any issue that was not raised in the responsive brief or the reply, respectively.\n\n(3) Briefs must be concise, presented with accuracy, logically arranged with proper headings and free from burdensome, irrelevant, or immaterial matters. A brief not meeting these criteria may fail to meet that party's burden of persuasion.\n\n(4) In cases involving more than one petitioner or respondent, including cases consolidated for purposes of the appeal, any number of either may join in a single brief, and any may adopt by reference any part of the brief of another. Parties may similarly join in reply briefs.\n\n(5) The ALJ shall provide an opportunity for oral argument, which shall be a hearing of record under R305-7-107(4)[. Oral argument shall, at a minimum, be recorded at the agency's expense using audio recording devices. The agency may elect instead to use a court reporter. If the agency does not elect to use a court reporter, any participant may request that the agency use a court reporter for the oral argument, which request shall be granted by the ALJ provided the requesting person agrees to bear the cost associated with the request. Any such request shall be submitted to the ALJ at least 10 business days before the scheduled oral argument].\n\n(6) The parties may submit comments on the ALJ's recommended decision to the Executive Director. Comments shall not exceed 15 pages, and shall be submitted within ten business days of the service of the recommended decision. A party may file a response to another party's comments, not to exceed five pages, within five business days of the date of the service of the comments.\n\nR305-7-214. Review and Determinations.\n\n(1) The procedures and standards for resolving a permit review challenge are specified in Section 19-1-301.5; see in particular paragraphs (9) through (15).\n\n(2) The standard of review for the Director's factual, technical, and scientific determinations specified in Section 19-1-301.5(14)(b) and (15)(c)(ii) is explained as follows:\n\n(a) The petitioner has the burden of proof;\n\n(b) Marshaling the evidence is a natural extension of the petitioner's burden of proof;\n\n(c) For each factual, technical, and scientific determination challenged by petitioner, the petitioner is required to marshal and acknowledge the evidence in the record that supports the Director's determination. Such determination shall be overturned as clearly erroneous only if the petitioner has proven, after marshaling, that the Director's determination is not supported. See Subsections 19-1-301.5(6)(d)(v)(G) and (H) and 19-1-301.5(14); and\n\n(d) If the petitioner fails to marshal, there is a presumption that the Director's factual, technical, and scientific determination is not clearly erroneous.\n\n(3) The standard of review for non-factual determinations provided in Section 19-1-301.5(15)(c)(i) recognizes that the Director has been granted substantial discretion to interpret the division's governing statutes and rules.\n\nR305-7-215. Interlocutory Orders.\n\n(1) Interlocutory review (review by the Executive Director before a final recommendation made by the ALJ) is not favored. Ordinarily, a party may challenge an order issued by the ALJ only after the ALJ has made a final recommended decision.\n\n(2) A party may file, in accordance with R307-7-104, a motion for interlocutory review of a non-final ALJ order only if a ruling that is alleged to be in error could not be corrected through a challenge to the final recommended decision (e.g., a ruling denying privileged status to records), or where early resolution of a material issue may materially advance the termination of the proceeding.\n\n(3) The Executive Director's determination to consider a motion for an interlocutory review is discretionary.\n\nR305-7-216. Settlement.\n\nThe parties may agree to settle all or any portion of an action at any time during an administrative proceeding through a settlement agreement, an administrative settlement order, or a proposed judicial consent decree. Upon notice by the Director that there is a proposed settlement that will be subject to a public comment period, the ALJ shall suspend the administrative proceeding, in whole or in part, until notified by the Director or another party that the suspension should be lifted. The ALJ may order an update on the status of the settlement.\n\nR305-7-217. Stays.\n\nThe procedure and standard for obtaining a stay is specified in Section 19-1-301.5(15).\n\nR305-7-301. Scope of Rule; Purpose of Part.\n\nPart 3 of this Rule (R305-7-301 through 319[320]) specifies procedures to be used in adjudicative proceedings that are not permit review adjudicative proceedings, as authorized by Section 19-1-301. For the most part, proceedings under Part 3 of this Rule will be enforcement proceedings and proceedings to terminate permits.\n\nR305-7-302. [Designation of Proceedings as Formal or Informal.]Issuance and Service of Initial Orders and Notices of Violation.\n\n[(1) All proceedings to contest an order that is not a Permit Order, including proceedings to challenge a Notice of Violation or compliance order, shall be conducted as formal proceedings except as specifically provided in Part 6 of this Rule.\n\n(2) The ALJ in accordance with Section 63G-4-202(3) may convert proceedings that are designated to be formal to informal and proceedings which are designated as informal to formal if conversion is in the public interest and rights of all parties are not unfairly prejudiced. A decision to use informal procedures must be approved by the Executive Director.](1) Unless otherwise stated, an Initial Order or a Notice of Violation is effective upon issuance and, even if it is contested, remains effective unless a stay is issued or the Initial Order or a Notice of Violation is rescinded, vacated or otherwise terminated.\n\n(2) The date of issuance of an Initial Order or a Notice of Violation is the date the Initial Order or a Notice of Violation is signed and dated.\n\n(3) Unless otherwise provided by law, Notices of Violation and Initial Orders shall be served through U.S. Postal Service Certified Mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the respondent's Designated Address. If there is no Designated Address for a respondent, service may be made through U.S. Postal Service Certified Mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the respondent's legal registered agent or, if the respondent is an individual, addressed to the respondent's dwelling or place of business. Notices of Violation and Initial Orders may also be served personally (by hand-delivery) or by Certified Mail with Return Receipt requested. Service of Initial Orders and Notices of Violation may also be made in the same manner as a summons in accordance with Rule 4 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n(4) Service of Notices of Violation and Initial Orders shall be made no more than seven days after the date of issuance. If service is made more than seven days after the date of issuance, the dates provided in R305-7-303 shall be extended by the same number of days that are in excess of seven days.\n\n(5) For purposes of this Rule, service is effective upon mailing, provided that the U.S. Postal Service Certified Mail receipt shows that the mailing was delivered. If the mailing is returned or if delivery is attempted but not made, service via U.S. Postal Service Certified Mail will not be deemed to be effective.\n\nR305-7-303. Requests for Agency Action and Contesting an Initial Order or Notice of Violation; Finality.\n\n(1) A Notice of Violation or an Initial Order may be contested by filing and serving a written Request for Agency Action as provided in R305-7-104(5).\n\n(2) Any Request for Agency Action is governed by and shall meet all of the requirements of UAPA, Section 63G-4-201(3)(a) and (3)(b).\n\n(3) As provided in Section 63G-4-201(3)(a), a Request for Agency Action shall be in writing and signed by the person making the Request for Agency Action, or by that person's representative, and shall include:\n\n(a) the names and addresses of all persons to whom a copy of the Request[request] for Agency Action[agency action] is being sent;\n\n(b) the agency's file number or other reference number, if known;\n\n(c) the date that the Request[request] for Agency Action[agency action] was mailed;\n\n(d) a statement of the legal authority and jurisdiction under which agency action is requested;\n\n(e) a statement of the relief or action sought from the agency;\n\n(f) a statement of the facts and reasons forming the basis for relief or agency action; and\n\n(4) A Request for Agency Action shall include the requestor's name, address and email address, if any.\n\n(5) To be timely, a paper copy of a Request for Agency Action to contest an Initial Order or a Notice of Violation shall be received for filing by the Director and the Administrative Proceedings Records Officer as specified in R305-7-104(2), (4) and (5) within 30 days of the [issuance of]date the Initial Order or a Notice of Violation was issued. This time may be extended only by stipulation of the parties and only if such stipulation is received for filing before the expiration of the time for filing the Request for Agency Action. The requester shall also send an electronic copy (searchable pdf) of the Request for Agency Action to [email protected].\n\n(6) If a Request for Agency Action is made by a person other than the recipient of an Initial Order, the Request for Agency Action shall also include a Petition to Intervene that meets the requirements of Section 63G-4-207 and R305-7-304. See R305-7-110, however (limitations on the ability of third persons to challenge enforcement proceedings).\n\n(7) (a) It is not sufficient under Section 63G-4-201(3)(a) or this rule to file a general statement of disagreement, a reservation of rights to file a Request[request] for Agency Action[agency action], or a request to have the matter heard.\n\n(b) If a person files a document challenging a notice of violation or an order under this Part 3 that does not meet the requirements of this rule, a party may file a dispositive motion addressing that inadequacy. The notice of violation or order will be final if the Executive Director approves or approves with modifications the ALJ's recommended order of dismissal.\n\n(8) A Notice of Violation or Initial Order will become final, for purposes of enforcement under Section 63G-4-501(1), upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of issuance, unless a Request for Agency Action is received as provided above. Failure to file a Request for Agency Action within the period specified [in R305-7-104(5)]above waives any right to contest the Initial Order or to seek judicial review.\n\nR305-7-304. Intervention.\n\nProceedings that are not permit review adjudicative proceedings will not ordinarily be subject to intervention. See R305-7-110 regarding intervention in enforcement proceedings. In the event intervention is appropriate under the specific facts of the case, the procedures for intervention specified in Part 2, including the deadlines for filing intervention specified in R305-7-204(2), shall govern. This time may be extended only by stipulation of the parties and the prospective intervenor and only if such stipulation is received for filing before the expiration of the time for filing the Petition to Intervene. The status and treatment of prospective intervenors in R305-7-207(2), shall also govern.\n\nR305-7-305. Parties.\n\nThe following persons are parties to an adjudicative proceeding to resolve a challenge to an Initial Order or Notice of Violation:\n\n(1) the person to whom the Initial Order or Notice of Violation was directed;\n\n(2) the Director who issued an Initial Order or Notice of Violation; and\n\n(3) any person to whom the ALJ has granted intervention under R305-7-304.\n\nR305-7-306. Proceedings After a Request for Agency Action is Filed.\n\n(1) After a Request for Agency Action has been filed, the parties are encouraged to meet to attempt to resolve the matter.\n\n(2) No response to a Request for Agency Action under Section 63G-4-204 is required, but the Director may elect to file a response. No reply to the Director's response is permitted.\n\n(3)(a) Any party may at any time file a request for appointment of an ALJ. An ALJ will not ordinarily be appointed until requested by a party, although the Executive Director may appoint an ALJ at any time.\n\n(b) A request for appointment of an ALJ shall be filed as provided in R305-7-104(2)(a), and served as provided in R305-7-104(2)(b).\n\n[(3) After an ALJ is appointed](4) Within 10 days after the appointment of an ALJ, the Director shall file and serve a Status Report that includes a brief statement of the case, an indication as to whether the Director believes further proceedings are warranted, and, if so, the Director's proposed scope of such further proceedings. The Status Report will provide the ALJ with the Director's position as to whether formal discovery is warranted as provided in R305-7-310, and, if so, the general nature and scope of the requested discovery. Within five days after service of the Director's Status Report, the other party or parties shall file and serve a Status Report including the same information outlined above. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer regarding the nature and scope of discovery, scheduling, and other pre-hearing matters.\n\n(5) Within 10 days after receipt of the final Status Report pursuant to subpart (4) or such other time deemed reasonable by the ALJ, the ALJ shall issue a Notice of Further Proceedings in accordance with Section 63G-4-201(3)(d) and (e). Until the ALJ has issued a Notice of Further Proceedings, no responses to motions filed before that date are due.
