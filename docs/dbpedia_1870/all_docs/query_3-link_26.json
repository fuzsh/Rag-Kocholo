        "text": "Im trying to enter in information to confirm parental/gaurdian status to add controls for my kid's account. However when it gets to the zip code part, there are no letters to use to enter my canadian postal code. I have selected Canada as my country, and everything else is correct, but without the postal code it wont let me go any further. Anyone else had this issue?\n\nHey there, @FoxG54 and @derrick.p.whiteside, thank you for reaching out to the community with this issue! Getting an unexpected hiccup in such a normal process can be jarring, but rest assured we'll work with you to find a resolution! Many times when we see this symptom pop up it is due to them being recognized as being logged in from a different country than Canada. This can be caused by VPN software, ISP routing wackiness, and other things of the sort that affect how you are seen online. If you are using anything like this, try disabling it and see if that corrects the issue. If not you can try to make the change when connected to a different network or device as we have seen similar issues resolved this way as well. Hopefully, this was simply a temporary issue and you're both all good to go, or that you are able to resolve the issue by trying those suggestions. If not, however, please reach back out to us and we'll see what we can do to dig into this deeper!\n\nIf you're the author of a thread, remember to mark a reply as the Accepted Solution to help others find answers!\n\nI am also having this issue. Apparently your updates have failed. I bought 2 of your headsets for Christmas and can't set either up due to your inability to get your stuff figured. I am less than impressed. This is a simple thing META. When someone selects Canada as their country, you need to program it to take a POSTAL CODE, not a ZIP code. Figure it out!\n\nHi, I am having this same problem. I've tried 2 different wifi connections and just the LTE network here.. but still can't get the account to register in here canada due to the postal code letters not being available.\n\nAny help available for this??\n\nTried different wifi options as well as just cellular data. It seems META doesn’t know where Canada is. This should be a basic entry. Canada = postal code NOT ZIP CODE\n\nFeels like a sleazy way of ensuring that my kids have no choice but to play with my adult account allowing them free reign to “accidentally” purchase what they want or enable features they shouldn’t have access to. They’re probably making millions off of this “glitch”. I doubt they’ll ever fix it.\n\nOk, I worked around this issue. I used a desktop to login and do the postal code. It turns out that doing it on a mobile device only brings up the number options, but on a desktop (a laptop would likely also work) it will accept letters for a postal code in the zip code slot and will allow you to proceed."
