About Mindscapes

Mindscapes is an international cultural program developed by Wellcome that aims to support a transformation in how we understand, address and talk about mental health.

Combining diverse perspectives and expertise, the program – including artist residencies, exhibitions and events – will be staged in a number of cities around the world, including "anchor cities" Bengaluru, Berlin, Toyko, and New York. This work is culminating in 2022-2023.

Mindscapes brings together cultural projects, communities, policy and research, and is informed and inspired by Wellcome's mental health program.

For the New York component of this initiative, Wellcome is partnering with selected local cultural institutions to examine the cultural meanings of mental health and well-being. Rebecca Jacobs, based at The Graduate Center, CUNY’s Center for the Humanities, is responsible for supporting the development of these projects across the city through a Working Group at the Center.

In December 2020, Jacobs organized a Mindscapes NYC convening, bringing together cultural institutions, artists, designers, policy stakeholders, researchers, foundations and Wellcome’s ICP and Mental Health Priority area teams.

The Working Group adapted Mindscapes NYC cultural projects in response to the tremendous public health and economic impacts of Covid-19 on New York City residents, taking on topics like recovery, healing, and collective care. Since January 2022, they have also working with a cohort of CUNY graduate students on Mindscapes programming.
