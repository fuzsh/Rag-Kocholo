        "text": "About the Minot Community Endowment Fund\n\nThe Minot Community Endowment Fund was established by a grant from the Otto Bremer Foundation in 1981 as a way for local residents to give back to the Minot community to support nonprofit projects and programs.\n\nThe fund is managed locally by a group of volunteers who make up the Advisory Committee and recommend grants from the fund annually.\n\nLocal Advisory Committee\n\nSusan Ness, Trinity Health (Kiwanis) - Committee Chair\n\nCameron Stone, Edward Jones (Sunrise Rotary)\n\nStaci Kenney, Minot Area Community Foundation (Rotary Club)\n\nKelly Matalka, Creedence Energy\n\nNeil Westergaard, Retired Educator (Golden K Kiwanis)\n\nJessica Phillips, First International Bank & Trust (Magic City Lions)Save & Close\n\nMike Buseth, Elite Real Estate (Optimist Club)\n\nRenee Escherich, Hometown Radio Group\n\nEx officio (non-voting)\n\nJason Zimmerman (MACF)\n\nContact\n\nBremer Trust\n\nKaren Gates\n\n20 1st Street SW\n\nMinot, ND 58701\n\n(701) 857-6241\n\nKara Geiger\n\nDevelopment Director, NDCF\n\n701-222-8349\n\nKara@NDCF.net\n\nApply for a Grant\n\nGrants shall be awarded only to those organizations designated by the IRS as 501(c)(3) nonprofit tax exempt groups, or government agencies.\n\nGrants shall be awarded to organizations within the city of Minot and surrounding communities, as determined by the Advisory Committee.\n\nGrants to religious organizations are limited to those activities which are non-denominational and serve the entire community (e.g. food pantry, community daycare center, homeless shelter).\n\nOnly one (1) request per organization per year will be considered.\n\nDeadline for requests is May 31 but may be extended at the discretion of the Advisory Committee. In addition, more than one grant round may take place within the calendar year.\n\nIf the applicant organization is outside of the Minot area, please describe in the narrative section how the project or program will specifically serve Minot area residents. Provide the number of Minot area residents served, if known.\n\nThe grant committee welcomes requests for funding all or a portion of a large project, provided a grant from MCEF provides a significant impact on the project and/or community.\n\nThe grant committee strongly encourages applicants to review the list of past grant awards to get a sense for the size of awards and scope of projects before submitting a request (Grant History tab).\n\nDeadline: May 31\n\nHow to Apply\n\nStep 1 - Review\n\nReview the grant guidelines above to make sure your organization qualifies.\n\nStep 2 - Register\n\nCreate an account on our Grant Portal. You will need your organization’s name, EIN, and executive officer's name. Be sure to write down your user name (email address) and password.\n\nStep 3 – Complete Your Application\n\nAfter registering or logging in, you will arrive at the application section. Click “Apply” to the right of the grant program to which you wish to apply. If you do not see your desired grant program on the list, contact our office. (The grant round will open January 1.) You will be able to save your application and return later to complete it.\n\nClick here for more detailed instructions and tips for using our online grant system.\n\nPlan Your Legacy\n\nMaking a lasting difference in our community or for future generations may be easier than you realize. With very simple language in your will or trust, you can help the Minot Community Endowment Fund (MCEF) continue to support important projects and programs in our area forever.\n\nGifts to MCEF are carefully invested by our partner foundation - the North Dakota Community Foundation - to generate a permanent source of charitable income.\n\nIf you have children or other relatives, you can leave a portion of your estate to them and a percentage to MCEF. Doing so provides for your heirs while honoring your charitable values.\n\nGetting Started\n\n1. Download our free Estate Planning Guide - it contains helpful information and things to consider as you develop your own unique plan.\n\n2. Reach out to a Minot Community Endowment Fund committee member to learn more about the charities and needs in our area.\n\n3. Consider discussing (confidentially) your vision with our NDCF gift planner Kara Geiger. She has many years of experience helping donors create their charitable vision and better prepare for their discussions with financial planners. You can reach Kara at 701-222-8349 or you can email her at Kara@NDCF.net.\n\n4. Contact your professional advisors (financial planner, attorney and/or accountant) and ask for help in establishing a charitable gift to our foundation.\n\n5. Make sure your will or living trust is up-to-date and reflects your charitable goals.\n\n6. Consider notifying the charitable organizations about the gift you plan to leave them. They will appreciate your generosity and will want to know what you’d like them to do with your eventual gift if it isn't clear.\n\nLanguage for Your Will or Living Trust\n\nIf you would like to include the Minot Community Endowment Fund in your will, here is some sample language to consider:\n\n“I give and bequeath to the North Dakota Community Foundation (Tax ID Number 45-0336015), a qualified charitable organization under IRS 501(c)(3), located in Bismarck, North Dakota, ___________ (a percentage of the estate, specific dollar amount, or remainder of estate) for the Minot Community Endowment Fund, a permanent component of the North Dakota Community Foundation.”\n\n* Be sure to contact your legal advisor.\n\nThere are many other ways to make a deferred gift to your community, including\n\nMaking NDCF (and your specific community fund) the beneficiary of your life insurance policy, IRA, 401K, or commercial annuity\n\nEstablishing a Charitable Gift Annuity with NDCF\n\nOther more sophisticated tools, depending on your unique situation\n\nTo investigate options and learn more about how other North Dakotans have given back, visit our planned giving website at www.NDCF.net/Plan."
