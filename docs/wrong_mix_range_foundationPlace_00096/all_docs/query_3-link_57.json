That puts the materials at risk.\n\nOutside Africa, such materials are scattered across thousands of collections with different indexing and user interfaces.

She’s currently University Librarian at the University of Lesotho, having previously served as Executive Director, Library Services, University of South Africa (UNISA), and as University Librarian at the University of Zimbabwe where, against a backdrop of a collapsing economy, she managed to build a state-of-the-art digital library.\n\nDr. Mbambo-Thata currently chairs the board of the Council for Library and Information Resources (CLIR).
