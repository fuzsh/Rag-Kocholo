        "text": "Connecting with other people is so important for our mental health. There are a lot of different ways we can do this, like phoning a friend for a chat, or visiting a neighbour. Sharing a meal is a great of building connections! It can help us slow down, talk and listen to each other. Since what we eat can also affect our mental health, while you're sharing a meal, why not think about ways to make it healthy for your mind and body! üëâ Find out more: https://bit.ly/3GAWTJM\n\nüì£ We're delighted to be recruiting for 3 roles this month, in Cardiff, Glasgow and London.

Originally started in the US in 1990, we have celebrated Disability Pride Month in the UK every July since 2015. Disability Pride is about spreading awareness about disabilities and celebrating the diversity of the disabled community. One in five people in the UK live with a disability. The Disability Pride flag uses five different colours to represent the many different identities and types of experience within the disabled community. üîµDid you know that the blue in the flag represents mental health problems? Some people with a mental health condition will identify as disabled, and some will not. This will be personal to each of us. Some people may also identify as having more than one type of disability. Disability Pride Month will mean something different to everyone. In the face of ableism, stigma and other forms of prejudice and discrimination, Disability Pride feels especially important. What does Disability Pride mean to you?\n\nThere's lots we can do to look after our own mental health, but we can't have good mental health for all without a society that prioritises it. That's why we're delighted to be a strategic partner for the Hapus Programme - a National Conversation on Mental Health in Wales. The aim of Hapus is to encourage people to prioritise their wellbeing and make time for the things that can boost mental health, like spending time with family & friends, walking in nature or listening to music. Something we could all do more of. Find out more below.\n\nCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is one of the most common treatments offered for mental health problems. Evidence suggests it can be used to treat depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia and more. But what is CBT, and what can someone starting this treatment expect from it? üëâIt's based on the idea that our feelings, thoughts and actions are all connected. By changing one of these, we can change the others. üëâWhen we‚Äôre upset, we often fall into patterns of negative thinking and responding that can make us feel worse and become a cycle. ‚úîÔ∏èIn CBT, your therapist will help you notice and change how you think and behave so you can break this cycle and feel better. Find out more about CBT in our guide here: https://bit.ly/4cS6kTe\n\nHelping others can have a positive effect on your mental health. üíú Acts of kindness don‚Äôt have to be big gestures, and they don‚Äôt have to cost a lot of time or money. You could: 1/ share positive feedback with a colleague 2/ listen to someone share a problem 3/ help someone with a task they're struggling with. These can all bring positive feelings. Remember to also extend kindness to yourself, too.\n\nSelf-harm is when a person hurts themselves on purpose. People might self-harm to cope with difficult or overwhelming thoughts and feelings. Self-harm can affect anyone. It's important to get help if you are self-harming. Talking to someone is often the first step to break the cycle. This could be a trusted friend, family member, your GP, or a helpline. It isn‚Äôt easy. But it‚Äôs an important step towards recovery and feeling better. Get more advice, information and support through our guide: https://bit.ly/3xQFTyd\n\nResearch shows that connecting with nature can boost your mental health.üçÉüåä This can mean getting outdoors and into green spaces, like parks and forests, or blue spaces, like rivers and lakes. You can bring nature indoors, too, with house plants or nature-inspired art. It's also been proven that watching nature documentaries can boost your mental health. This is particularly helpful for those unable to get outdoors.

Everyone deserves good mental health. But not everyone has access to the key building blocks of mental health, including decent housing, financial security, safe childhoods, and freedom from discrimination. Preventing many mental health problems is possible. But we need the government to take action. üì¢ That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre calling on the new Labour government to deliver a detailed, long-term, funded mental health plan. We look forward to working with the new government to make this happen."
