        "text": "German artist Anselm Kiefer conjoins matter, history and time in a moving installation of paintings and monumental sculpture opening October 20th at MASS MoCA. MASS MoCA centerpiece Building 4 galleries will feature four vast landscape paintings from a recent series never before seen in the United States, two paintings from the 1980, and an immense concrete sculpture, Etroits sont les Vaisseaux.\n\n\"Among our most important poets of war, in this surprising body of works Anselm Kiefer presents us with poignant moments of color flowering across the ruined topographies of his vast canvases,\" said Joseph Thompson, Director of MASS MoCA. \"For reasons I still cannot fully fathom, the Connecticut courts have recently required Andy and Christine Hall to remove Kiefer's elegiac Etroits sont les Vaisseaux from their property. I've long admired that particular sculpture its siting was exquisite and I was delighted when the Halls offered it on long-term loan to MASS MoCA. That spirited act of generosity was further amplified as we discussed creating a specific installation of Kiefer works keyed to Etroits sont les Vaisseaux. Admirers of Kiefer will find this exhibition revelatory, the relative profusion of color is unexpected, and somehow especially touching because of that fact and for those who may have missed the wonderful Fort Worth and Bilbao surveys of Kiefer's work, this focused installation presents a powerful environment in which to become familiar with his recent work. Two earlier canvases with overlapping themes will place this timely new body of work in a broader context.\"\n\nArtforum describes Kiefer's art as \"sensuous and mesmerizing images through which we gain entry to his arcane mindscape of ancient and recent history, philosophy, botany, Nordic myth, National Socialism, alchemy, and Wagner.\" The Independent said in a review of Kiefer's February 2007 exhibition at London's White Cubes Gallery: \"Great art is about transformation. And transforming experience and transforming materials are what Anselm Kiefer specializes in. The contrasting themes of destruction and recreation, violent upheaval and spiritual renewal, underpin much of the artist's work.\""
