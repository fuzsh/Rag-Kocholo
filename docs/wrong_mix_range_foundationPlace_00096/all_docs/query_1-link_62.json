        "text": "Mark Alan Knight\n\nBorn 1973-01-08 Birth Place Brighton, East Sussex, England Nationality English Aliases The Mad Fiddler Website madfiddler.co.uk\n\nMark Knight is an English composer and sound designer. His work ranges from the early 90s to this day. He has also received numerous awards for his audio contributions.\n\nMark started out in the games industry when he joined Mindscape's UK division in August 1992. In March 1997, the studio closed its doors and Mark moved on to Bullfrog Productions later that year, where he worked on the music and sound to a few of their titles. Around the same time, he was also working as a sound designer for Electronic Arts. In 2003, Mark left the two companies to work for Climax and Visual Science before returning to Electronic Arts in March 2006. However, the studio closed its doors later that year. Mark then started working at Codemasters near the end of 2007. He started there as a Lead Sound Designer, and then promoted to Group Lead Sound Designer, before going back to being a composer and sound designer so he could work to creating audio. His career at Codemasters spanned almost a decade. Mark later worked at other game companies such as 704Games, FunFair Technologies, and SONiC FUEL, holding various audio positions.\n\nToday, Mark currently works at BeamNG as a sound designer.\n\nMusic Development\n\nGame Gear\n\nThe only game Mark Knight composed for the Game Gear was Battleship. However, he wasn't involved with the Game Gear version's development. Instead, his MIDI files were given to the game's conversion team (Kalisto) and the MIDI files were implemented in the game by Gil Espeche, programming his own custom Z80 sound driver.\n\nNES\n\nBattleship was the only NES game Mark worked on. To create the music for Battleship, Mark used Cubase on the Atari ST. Mark then sent his music to Mindscape. The game uses Nick Eastridge's sound driver, strongly suggesting he arranged Mark's music.\n\nSNES\n\nMark used Protracker 2.3 on the Amiga, composed the music as .MOD files, and Mindscape later converted it to .MED files. His instruments were taken mainly from a Korg 01W. Mark used a sound development system called Berlioz. Mark says that he had no documentation, or support, and was not happy with the level of quality he could get from the system.\n\nIt was later discovered that Mark used Sculptured Software's audio system, BMus.\n\nGameography\n\nReleased Title Sample Notes 1990-??-??
