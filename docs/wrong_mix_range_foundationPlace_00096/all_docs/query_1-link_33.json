        "text": "The New Mindscape #10–2.\n\nIn our capitalist society, we have learned enormously about how to generate material value and how to multiply it. That is to say, we know a lot about how to accumulate financial capital, as well as how to generate more capital with seed capital. In sociology, management and some other fields, there is an increasingly wider understanding of the ideas of capital and value. For example, a number of concepts of “capital” have appeared, such as economic capital, human capital, social capital, cultural capital, symbolic capital and spiritual capital. These are different types of so-called “capital”. That means that different types of value can be accumulated, generated and converted into other things. For example, social capital refers to your social network and connections. Cultural capital refers to your amount of cultural knowledge. Symbolic capital refers to your prestige [1].\n\nSome scholars have been using the concept of “spiritual capital” to understand how certain organisations, whether businesses, NGOs or religious groups, try to put their spiritual values into practice [2]. They try to explore the value created through the application of a spiritual orientation to life — what is generated by spirituality. I have been doing some research on this in the past years in relation to the use of spiritual capital in the “third sector”, that is to say, in NGOs and civil society in Hong Kong [3].\n\nAt the core of religious teachings, in general, we find teachings of compassion and love, and the encouragement of good deeds, of generosity and of giving to charity. Thus it is no surprise that we have many charitable organisations with religious backgrounds. In fact, the origin of charitable organisations in history is religious. It is quite common that we associate religion with charity. It is something that religious groups have been doing for a long time — helping the poor.\n\nIn this research, we tried to understand whether there is anything about the spirituality of some of these faith-based organisations that make them different from other kinds of charities. There are all kinds of NGOs and charities — some of them are religious or have religious backgrounds, while the others are not. Let’s assume there are two groups that help homeless people — one is faith-based, while the other one is not. We would like to see if there is any difference between the two groups. Does spirituality generate any difference in the organisations that are trying to serve society?\n\nIn our research in Hong Kong, we found three types of faith-based organisations. One type is purely religious groups that only serve their own religious community. They do not necessarily serve society or the broader community outside their own group.\n\nAt the other end, there are some organizations that were originally started by religious people, but now exhibit scant difference from nonreligious organisations. The Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) of Hong Kong is an example. This organisation has a swimming pool, a sports club, a hotel, etc. It does many good things, but it’s hard to identify anything specifically spiritual about what it does. At the beginning, over 100 years ago, it had the urge and the generosity to help young Christian men — and hence it started those sports and educational activities. But gradually, these became very institutionalised, so that what they are doing now is hardly any different from what you could find in a non-faith-based organization.\n\nThe third type of faith-based organisations are inspired by a certain faith or spirituality, which leads them to do things for society differently from both traditional religious organisations, as well as from the secular social service organisations or NGOs. So we were curious about what makes them different.\n\nFor example, there was a group called the Centre of Spiritual Progress for Great Awakening. Master Yanyang, a Hong Kong Buddhist nun, started a social enterprise primarily for middle-aged women. Some middle-aged women may encounter problems in their marriage or job; they feel worthless and become depressed. This organisation tries to empower them through rebuilding their self-confidence, and their sense of purpose and value in life. It has a vegetarian restaurant, similar to the Bijas Vegetarian Restaurant on the campus of the University of Hong Kong, which is owned by another Buddhist social enterprise. Maybe these middle-aged women are unemployed and have limited social skills. But through working in the vegetarian restaurant, they gradually gain self-confidence, friendships, interpersonal communication skills, and finally can return to society. We found that this group is doing something interesting and new, because it’s rare that Buddhist organisations would start social enterprises. Another interesting thing about this group is that it not only provides working opportunities for those women, but also opens a camp for them to learn about spirituality. Through the Buddhist teachings, they learn about their Buddha-nature, the value of life, dealing with suffering in life, and so on. That is how they gain a sense of purpose in life, confidence, skills to handle quarrels with their families, and so on. Through spiritual training, they gain another kind of value. In this sense, this group is doing something rather different from what most organisations and even social enterprises do.\n\nAnother group that we visited is called the Christian Concern For the Homeless Association. As its name suggests, this is an organisation that helps the homeless. But unlike other organisations with the same objective, it doesn’t simply give the homeless food or shelter. It treats homeless people as human beings with as much value as anybody else. When the homeless people come to the shelter, they also learn how to become the leaders of activities. They learn that just like all human beings, they were created in the image of God, and that God loves them, even though they have nothing. In the eyes of God, they are just as valuable as anybody else. Thus the homeless gain a sense of value and confidence, as well as the skills to organise activities. We can see again that this organisation is providing not only material help by giving food and shelter, but also spiritual help, or rather, “spiritual capital”. Thus the homeless people are empowered after being involved with this organisation.\n\nThe next example is Mother’s Choice, which has a Christian background. This group works with pregnant teenage girls. When a teenage girl becomes pregnant, she will have a huge crisis in her life. She might be stigmatised by people around her or rejected by her family. She doesn’t know what to do — to have an abortion or to keep the baby? If she decides to keep the baby, how can she raise the baby? Should she put the baby up for adoption? All these questions will arise if a teenage girl gets pregnant. This organisation provides moral support for these pregnant mothers, as well as the first home for the babies of these mothers, if they decide not to keep their babies.\n\nWe found a lot of babies at Mother’s Choice — it’s almost like an orphanage. But it was not like a conventional orphanage that I had once visited. At that orphanage, I had seen a lot of babies lying in their beds, which was a depressing scene. There was nothing but children and babies in their beds, and nurses feeding them in a mechanical fashion. It was not a happy place. In contrast, Mother’s Choice was a very joyful place. There was a real family feeling. The orphans were happy and the nurses and volunteers were playing and taking care of them with much love and joy.\n\nThe typical institution sees a child as a material being. Thus, the most important thing is to make sure that a child has enough food, has a bed, and is physically healthy. But there is no time or effort to give the child love. But in Mother’s Choice, they figured that they also should give love to the babies and the teenage mothers — no matter if the mothers are on drugs or have many problems. Again, just like the homeless people, they have nothing. Yet, Mother’s Choice considers that they have spiritual value — they are human beings, and have infinite value, just like anyone else. Mother’s Choice gives them love, and creates this happy family atmosphere among the orphans and teenage mothers.\n\nThe Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Programme of the Baha’i community is another example. This programme is for junior youth between 11 and 15 years old, which is considered to be the most rebellious period of adolescence. It is an age that is often considered to be immature and rebellious. But in the Junior Youth Empowerment Programme, the attitude is just the opposite. That age is a very special time. One reason for the youth being rebellious is that they have a very strong sense of justice. They can see what’s going wrong in the world, and in their family. They don’t like it and they want to fight against it. Thus, this rebellion may actually be something very positive. How can that value — the desire to reject the bad things of the world, and to change the world — be recognised and nurtured? With this question in mind, this programme helps junior youth to form their own groups, in which they study about spiritual values and how to put them into practice, and in which they consult together to initiate small service projects. In these groups, the youth’s desire to change to world can be channelled in a positive way, where they can gain leadership skills, and where they can have positive influence on their peers and society.[4]\n\nWe also studied the Fullness Christian Social Enterprise [5]. This enterprise tries to integrate spiritual principles and values into the operation of its business. They have what they call a “triple bottom line”: the economic bottom line, the social bottom line, and the spiritual bottom line.This organisation helps ex-prisoners to reintegrate into society after their release. The ex-prisoners, because of their criminal record, have difficulty in finding their place in society. They will encounter a lot of prejudice and obstacles, which might lead them to commit more crimes and return to prison. This organisation, again, treats ex-prisoners as persons with infinite value. It creates a loving family atmosphere in the hair salon and the automobile repair shop where the ex-prisoners work. Here, the ex-prisoner gets a sense of his value, regardless of the mistakes he committed in the past, his weaknesses and faults he has. Instead, he is treated as an infinitely valuable person. This value is respected and nurtured so that it can grow and flourish.\n\nIn all these examples, we can see groups of people who generally are considered not to have much value in society. They certainly do not have financial capital, be it the middle-aged woman, the pregnant teenage mother, the orphan, the homeless or the junior youth. Neither do they have any social capital. Social capital in sociology basically means social networks. Social connections are very important in a person’s life, as they can help you move ahead in your career, make money, and so on. However, these people do not have social capital. Instead, they are looked down upon in society. Nor do they have cultural capital — their level of cultural knowledge and sophistication is quite low. And they don’t have symbolic capital — not only do they not have any “face” or prestige, they are even stigmatised and discriminated against in society.\n\nThe faith-based organisations I mentioned above, however, consider that these groups of people are very “rich” — they are rich spiritually. Inside themselves, they have infinite value — the value that God has given them, or the value of being an integral part of the flow of the universe. They have spiritual capital. These organisations treat these types of people with a genuine sense of dignity, and seek to nurture their high potential. They can contribute to society as much as anybody else. This is the foundation of the notion of spiritual capital.\n\nSpiritual capital is defined as the capacities that are generated through spirituality. So if you nurture your spirituality, you will gain the capacity to do certain things, which you would not have if you ignore your spirituality. For example, with their spirituality unattended to, the middle-aged women at the Centre of Spiritual Progress for Great Awakening felt that they were useless, because they are housewives ignored and beaten by their husbands. They just felt that they couldn’t do anything at all in life. However, once they gained a sense of their spiritual value, they also gained confidence, and started to learn many things. Just by affirming and nurturing the spiritual value of each person they work with — whether it is Mother’s Choice, or Christian Concern for the Homeless, or the Fullness Christian Social Enterprise — these organisations have already generated spiritual capital."
