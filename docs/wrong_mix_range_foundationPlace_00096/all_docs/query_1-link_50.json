        "text": "Martin Luther (1483-1546) is a central figure in the development of European cultural and intellectual history, both because of his theological influence and because of his contribution to the development of New High German. The complete Weimar edition of Luther's works is a central tool for theological, historical, philosophical, literary and linguistic research.\n\nThis complete edition of Luther's writings is one of the largest editions ever by a single author. The monumental work, which has been published since 1883 and comprises more than 117 volumes in quarto format, has been completed with the exception of the subject index to the \"Writings\" section, which has not yet been published in full. For research into the life and work of the reformer, the Weimar edition of Luther's works is an indispensable historical-critical tool for theologians and historians, linguists and literary scholars.\n\nQwest TV EDU provides access to a vast and growing archive of Black music and global sounds through live performances, documentaries, and interviews spanning diverse musical genres, from around the world.

Our online courses are self-paced and instructor-led, comprising an engaging mix of Sage-quality content, video, interactives, and formative assessments. The topics cover critical skills and research methods for across all stages of academic study; navigating information, data literacy, research skills, data science skills, and getting published.\n\nAccess to Part I Cases only.\n\nSage Research Methods Cases are stories of how real research projects were conducted. The collection provides more than 1100 case studies, showing the challenges and successes of doing research, written by the researchers themselves. They explain why the researchers chose the methods they did, how they overcame problems in their research and what they might have done differently with hindsight: the realities of research that are missing from journal articles and textbooks. Cases are peer-reviewed and come with pedagogical tools including learning objectives and discussions questions. They can be used as a teaching tool to demonstrate a particular method and how it is applied in real research, or as inspiration to students who are preparing for their own research project. – Publisher\n\nSage Research Methods Data Visualization is organized to introduce users to the fundamental principles of graphical displays of data—complete with annotated examples across an array of categories—presented with tips and tricks, as well as explanatory examples of bad practice.
