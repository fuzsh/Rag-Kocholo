        "text": "This final film differs from his best-known diaristic works, which document a life in exile and the New York avant-garde scene, in the near total absence of human figures. The few people who do appear in Requiem are filmed from afar and seem to be ghostly and peripheral, evoking feelings of alienation, impermanence, and mortality. The primary imagery of the film comes from footage Mekas captured over three decades, using video and digital media from an early Sony camcorder to a pocket-sized Nikon. These cut flowers, garden blooms, wildflowers, and trees in full blossom are stitched together through his signature nonlinear editing.\n\nThe globalized field of contemporary art—at least as figured at this edition of the Biennale—presents artists and curators from the Global South with two strategies regarding identity. Either to “navigate” the field, using classic postcolonial tools such as hybridity and transitivity to find one’s own way in a system premised upon multiculturalism and fluidity; or to break through to an “authentic” identity, which is constantly displaced and accessible only as the trace of multiple erasures. These two approaches are apparent in the two pavilions’ color schemes: both use blue as the key, but signifying the largely secularized tradition, performed in a smooth digital space of the blue screen for Uzbekistan and suggesting spirituality and twilight on the steppe in the case of Kazakhstan.\n\nSanadze was born in Georgia’s capital, Tbilisi, in 1976, surrounded by large-scale public sculptures of Lenin. As a child she lived next door to the prominent Soviet sculptor Valentin Topuridze (1907–80) and remembers the enormous hands and head of Lenin scattered around his garden. “We kids would climb them,” she has said, adding, “all these figures would be overgrown with grapes, and it was really beautiful, that ruined aesthetic that’s sort of classical art, but not in its perfect museum form.” Many of Topuridze’s public monuments were destroyed after Georgia gained independence.\n\nChantal Akerman once told an interviewer that each of her films needs hallways, doors, and rooms. “Those doors and hallways help me frame things, and they also help me work with time.” […] “Travelling” puns with the French travelling, or tracking shot. Akerman’s camera often moved right-to-left, working against the Hollywood standard of narrative progression and challenging preconceptions of what constitutes an advance. People are in transit in Akerman’s films, and the camera moves with them. Subjects exit train stations, check into hotels, ride the subway, and queue for buses.\n\nWu Tsang is interested in what she calls “resistant social life,” and has said she’s attracted to stories with “messy politics.” She is often concerned with territoriality, the spaces in between; she shares with her friend and sometime “band” member Fred Moten a concern with blurring, hinterlands, and interstitial spaces both literal and figurative. Past work has explored the social and gestural codes of sailors in a reworking of themes and motifs from Herman Melville’s Moby Dick. And here the theme of flamenco is one with potential.\n\nThis awareness of the archaic nature of cinema, and its relationship to nature, is at the base of Gabriel Chaile’s memorable installation Selva Tucumana [Tucumán Jungle] (2024), which signals an important change in his artistic vocabulary away from the large-scale adobe sculptures for which he is best known. These characteristic anthropomorphic sculptures also function as wood-fired ovens around which people can gather to participate in and observe communal rituals.\n\nIn 1991, when she was 12, the Vlora, a hijacked cargo ship carrying some twenty thousand Albanian refugees, unexpectedly docked in the Italian port city of Bari, near where Biscotti grew up. Many of the economic refugees were housed in a disused stadium. Skirmishes with Italian authorities ensued, resulting both in the refugees being repatriated and stricter border policies being implemented. A year later, Biscotti took a black-and-white photograph of the Adriatic Sea from Bari; using pen, she later superimposed onto this photo the outline of a hill, which she labeled “Albania.”\n\nThe ninth Biennale Gherdëina takes its title from a Ladin myth that is, in part, a cautionary tale. It narrates the series of tragedies that follows when the Fanes—the indigenous people of the Dolomites—betray a pact with their animal allies, the marmots. The Kingdom of Fanes—a national epic that roams across Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East—informs an exhibition that dwells on themes of interspecies relations, communal identity, and collaboration.\n\n“The bench,” as Clémentine Deliss has written, “is anathema to the capitalist space of the modern museum,” set up to discourage the “repose and study” once synonymous with the appreciation of art. Try standing in front of a painting for an hour: you will attract the same suspicion from the invigilator as you would staring at a jeweler’s window from a shopping mall’s security guards. And so, instead, I have started seeking out public spaces more amenable to unhurried observation—parks, graveyards, churches, bars—and writing about the pictures, inscriptions, prints, architectures, and objects I find therein."
