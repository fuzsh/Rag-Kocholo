        "text": "At the core of MindSpaceâ€™s ethos and values is inclusivity and it is important to us that there are as few barriers as possible to accessing our services. We are always reviewing what we do and improving accessibility for everyone is an ongoing commitment. We welcome feedback and suggestions from all sectors of our community, so if you have comments or criticisms, please get in touch.\n\nWe have made adjustments to our current premises to make them as accessible as possible, but we are limited by the constraints of an old building. For wheelchair users, we have installed a doorbell and have use of a ramp for entry to the premises. Our reception and activity area are all on one level and our tea and coffee making facilities at an accessible height for all. Please note however that our toilet facilities are down a flight of stairs, but during the daytime our neighbours at the Corn Exchange offer the use of their accessible toilets to MindSpace members. Red Lion Square toilets are also located about 200m from our premises and are accessible via the National Key Scheme for wheelchair users.\n\nFor further information, please contact our Host Administrator on 07563 385273 or click on the button below to send us a message.\n\nThe Recovery College is part of Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust that runs free mental health courses in Stamford.\n\nThe Recovery College uses an educational based approach to help people recognise and develop their personal resourcefulness and awareness in order to become experts in their self-care, make informed choices and do the things they want to in life.\n\nAll our courses are co-designed and co-delivered by experts with lived experience of mental ill health, peer trainers and expert health professionals."
