My intended structure is something like this:\n\nStyles/ | |– output/ | |– toMain.css | |– toMain.css.map | | – toMain.scss\n\nBut what I'm getting is 2 outputs, like so:\n\nStyles/ | |– output/ | |– toMain.css | |– toMain.css.map | | – toMain.scss | |– toMain.css | |– toMain.css.map\n\nI've double checked the output settings for the toMain.scss file via Mindscape > Web Workbench Settings and the only output I see is indeed that file set for the Styles/output folder, but I'm still getting the duplicate. I don't have any other extension in VS2010 that handle SASS, and I can't seem to find any information about this issue anywhere. Are there any other settings for the extension that could be causing this?\n\nEDIT: It may be worth noting that I'm using Team Foundation Server with this project - so the outputted CSS is excluded from source control. I'm not sure if this makes a difference."
