In 1963, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nZewail, 44, says it is a \"special honor\" to be named the first Pauling Professor. \"I feel Pauling is the greatest chemist of the 20th century,\" Zewail says. \"He has had a tremendous impact on my work and [on that] of every chemist in the world.\"\n\nZewail was cited for his research on the development of ultrafast laser techniques for recording the behavior of molecules during chemical reactions (The Scientist, May 29,..."
