In the Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (LMS) Center, collaborative multidisciplinary research has been established to address the role of complexity in the primary function of real systems including enzyme catalysis, protein-RNA transcription, electron transport in DNA, and the role of water in protein and DNA recognitions. A major research frontier at LMS is the new development of ultrafast diffraction techniques that make possible the imaging of transient structures in space and time with atomic-scale resolution. A significant effort is also devoted to giving public lectures to enhance awareness of the value of knowledge gained from fundamental research, and helping the population of developing countries through the promotion of science and technology for the betterment of society.\n\nMain publications\n\nPhysics & Chemistry - Ultrafast Electron Diffraction: Thee, H., Lobastov, V., Gomez, U., Goodson, B., Srinivasan, R., Ruan, C.-Y. and Zewail, A.H., Direct Imaging of Transient Molecular Structures with Ultrafast Diffraction, Science, 291, p. 385 (2001); Thee, H., Cao, J. and Zewail, A.H., Ultrafast Electron Diffraction of Transient Fe(CO)4: Determination of Molecular Structure and Reaction Pathway, Angew.
