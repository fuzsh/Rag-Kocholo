The Congregational Church - Wilmslow Road

The Congregational Church, on Wilmslow Road, near the junction with Dickenson Road, was a creation of Alfred Waterhouse, the architect of Manchester Town Hall, Owens College and the Natural History Museum in London.

It was built between 1863 and 1864 and Pevsner describes it as being, "Heavily Gothic, of darkened brick with a high NW tower. The tower has four steep gables and a short spire". It was built at a cost of Â£4,600 and offered 600 free seats.
