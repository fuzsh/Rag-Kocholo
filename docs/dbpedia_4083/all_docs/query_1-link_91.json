        "text": "Quarry Bank is a place of stark contrast, where the power of the Industrial Revolution sits alongside the beauty of picturesque gardens and lush countryside. At Quarry Bank you can discover a complete industrial community and experience the very different worlds of owner and worker, who lived and worked here side by side.\n\nDiscover what it was like to work in a cotton mill. Experience heritage machinery in action and feel the floors shake beneath your feet as the spinning machines turn and the looms weave. Find out about the life and legacy of Samuel Greg, the founder of Quarry Bank.\n\nExplore the Greg family home, Quarry Bank House, and wander through the stunning picturesque gardens that rise up the banks of the river valley, offering stunning views and spectacular changes through the seasons. By contrast, take a guided tour of the Apprentice House to step into the lives of the pauper children who worked in the mill. Stroll to Styal village to see how many of the other workers lived. Styal remains a thriving community today and we ask you to be mindful of our tenants' privacy.\n\nOn the estate there are acres of woodland to explore. Follow the meandering path of the river Bollin and cross the folly bridges as you look out for an array of wildlife and beautiful views."
