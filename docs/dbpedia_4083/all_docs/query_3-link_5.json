        "text": "Manchester Museum is part of the University of Manchester and is based in a fabulous neo-Gothic historic building, designed by Alfred Waterhouse in 1870, who also designed the Natural History Museum in London, as well as many of Manchester’s most iconic buildings.\n\nManchester Museum is one of the UK’s largest university museums with a collection of about 4.5 million items. The Museum reopened following a £15 million transformation project, making it more inclusive, imaginative and caring to the diverse communities it serves. A two-storey extension has increased the Museum’s floor space and existing spaces have been reconfigured to create new galleries, telling powerful stories and engaging with big ideas.\n\nManchester Museum became the world’s first carbon-literate museum in 2016, winning a gold award in the Carbon Literate Organisation Awards."
