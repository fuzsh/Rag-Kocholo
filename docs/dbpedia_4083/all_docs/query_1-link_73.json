        "text": "Lindow Man is back in Manchester. This is his third visit to the city since peat cutters found one leg, a head and torso in a bog near Wilmslow, Cheshire, in 1984. Since then he has covered far more miles than he did in his lifetime 2,000 years ago. And since then the key question continues to be asked: why did he die?\n\nThe people of Manchester and north-west England became very attached to the Iron Age man and launched a campaign (with special song and T-shirt) to keep him in the city. They lost and Lindow Man's permanent home is now at the British Museum in London. But he has come north for a year's stay at the Manchester Museum on the campus of Manchester University. The school parties are already pouring in.\n\nLindow Man was in his mid-20s when he died. He was 1.6m (5ft 6in) tall, weighed 60kg (9.4 stone) and suffered from intestinal worms and mild osteoarthritis. In his stomach were traces of wheat bread, heather, sphagnum moss and a small amount of mistletoe pollen. His death was not pleasant. A thong of animal sinew was round his neck, his throat was slashed and his head bashed in. He wore nothing but a fox-skin armband and his moustache had been trimmed with shears. His elegant finger nails suggested he could have had a privileged work-free existence before his death.\n\nBut what was his death? Summary execution? Ritual mugging? Sacrificial murder? That, then, is Lindow Man's biography, such as it is known, although he is clearly related to other bog bodies found in Europe, especially Denmark's Grauballe Man who Seamus Heaney saluted in awe-struck verse.\n\nThe organisers of the Manchester exhibition say they have adopted a \"sensitive approach\" this time (the tabloids called him Pete Marsh in 1984), stressing that Lindow Man is a dead man, not a mere museum object, and his story is told in part through interviews with those closest to him.\n\n\"We were chuffed we found him for everyone to see,\" said Andrew Mould, the peat cutter who discovered a part of Lindow Man that he describes as just \"like a lump of wood\". \"So we pulled it up and you could feel the skin and see the toenails,\" he added. \"So then we thought, 'Oh, we've got a leg'...\" Melanie Glass, a Manchester University archaeologist, talks of \"looking into the face of the past\", a face with recognisable features. \"It connects us to the past with an immediacy that a skeleton or a wrapped mummy perhaps doesn't.\"\n\nSusan Chadwick, who has lived in the Lindow Moss area all her life, was at primary school when Lindow Man was found in the age of Bros and Care Bears, and sang on the recording of the Lindow Man song. She recalls her surprise at seeing his stubble and how her friend said he looked like a suitcase. More than 20 years on, she would still like him back on permanent display in the region: \"I think if he came back to Manchester, a lot of people, especially from this area where I've been brought up, would be very proud to have him back ... this is our history, this is our neighbour ...\"\n\nSensitive museum staff have even contacted pagan and Druid priest Emma Restall Orr, who wishes she could wrap Lindow Man \"in some rich, sweet linen with herbs and take him back to the Moss\". She is, she adds, perturbed by the display of human remains \"almost for entertainment\". Which makes you wonder what she thinks about Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds exhibition up the road at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. (Perhaps she will say more during a debate on displaying the dead at MoSI on May 13.)\n\nAll these voices are fascinating but they tend to crowd out Lindow Man, who lies in a dimly-lit box surrounded by all this talk. He is not helped by the design of the exhibition, which features long rows of blockboard shelves. The shelving, with its resonances of libraries and sober academic endeavour, diminishes the mystery of Lindow Man, who appears as an extra in someone else's show.\n\nBruce Mould, Andrew's cousin, who spent most of his life cutting peat, goes some way to making the wondrous connection between Lindow Man and us: \"It's nice to know there's people summat like you from thousands of years ago and they lived pretty similar like us, you know.\""
