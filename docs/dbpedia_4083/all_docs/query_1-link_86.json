        "text": "Description\n\nWilliam Sharp Ogden was born in 1845 in Bolton le Moors, the son of Thomas Ogden, a coach builder, and his wife, Mary. William married Emma Vaison on 19th June 1873 at Manchester Cathedral, and they lived for a long time in Rusholme, Manchester, until they moved to Finchley, London in around 1918.\n\nWilliam Sharp Ogden was an architect, and his work includes the red brick Synagogue on Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester, as well as several monuments at Urmston Jewish Cemetery and Southern Cemetery. He also wrote many books on a range of subjects including mercantile architecture, Christian grave stones, antique oak furniture, the Roman mint and early Britain, and portraits of Shakespeare.\n\nWilliam Sharp Ogden was also a collector of antiquities. Manchester Museum's Etruscan collection was formed mainly from the donation Ogden’s collection, a short time before his death. A picture of the nature of his collecting habits and his social connections can be constructed from looking at how he acquired his objects. A number of his pieces were bought from dealers in London, however the labels on several vessels position them as previously having belonged to well-known collections including; ‘Signor Avvocato Marcioni, Orvieto’, ‘Rothschild, Rickmansworth, 1907’, ‘Fairfax Murray Collection, Viterbo’, and ‘Weber Collection’.\n\nHe also had a keen interest in coins. Ogden was a member of the British Numismatics Society, and in 1925 he donated a collection of coins, including 1500 from Roman Alexandria to Manchester Museum.\n\nWilliam died at the age of 81 on 26th April 1926 at his home in Finchley, London. William and his wife Mary had no children, and his estate, valued at £10961 1s 2d, was left to Sir Henry Alexander Miert and Evelyn Frances Goffey. He also left a large bequest of 17-19th century British prints, including the largest and most comprehensive collection of William Hogarth prints in the country to the Whitworth Gallery, Manchester."
