Come join us to have a ‘mooch’ round a museum with other LGBTQ+ people.\n\nA mooch is a gentle wander – we want to go at our own pace and spend time looking at the exhibits we enjoy. We will be self guided, and even have some little games/things to look out for so we can have the most fun possible! This will also be a great chance to meet people and find some common interests.\n\nIn February we will be visiting Manchester Museum, Oxford Rd, M13 9PL."
