        "text": "Whether you’re a football fan or interested in the history of policing, there is no shortage of museums to visit in Greater Manchester. They’re a great way to spend the day when the weather isn’t so great outside - which happens a lot at this time of year.\n\nBut there’s one museum which has impressed visitors from across the world with its extensive collections and it’s even drawn comparisons with London’s Natural History Museum. Oh, did we mention that it has its own mini ‘zoo’ too?!.\n\nLocated on Oxford Road, Manchester Museum is part of the University of Manchester. Don’t let the throngs of students put you off venturing to this part of the city, though, as you’ll discover an incredible collection of fossils, artefacts from ancient Egypt, taxidermy and more when you step inside.\n\nTry MEN Premium now for FREE... just click here to give it a go.\n\nThe museum may have been off your radar recently as it closed for an extensive refurbishment from summer 2021 until February 2023. When it reopened its doors it welcomed visitors to a new two-storey wing housing the brand new Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery and the South Asia Gallery, a collaboration with the British Museum.\n\nMany of the museum’s familiar exhibitions remained, including the Fossils Gallery, home to a 100 million-year-old tenontosaurus called April and Stan the tyrannosaurus rex. Meanwhile the spectacular main hall with its ornate galleries is overlooked by the skeleton of a sperm whale.\n\nThere’s still time to catch the Golden Mummies of Egypt exhibition, which is on until April 14. The exhibit showcases more than 100 objects and eight mummies and gives an insight into beliefs about the afterlife during an era when Egypt was part of the Greek and Roman worlds.\n\nOne of the museum’s hidden gems is the Vivarium, a collection of live amphibians and reptiles including many critically endangered species, such as the variable harlequin toad. As it’s not usual for museums to care for live animals, it’s something that makes Manchester Museum particularly special.\n\nThe museum has received rave reviews from visitors on Tripadvisor. Paul H wrote: “Amazing. I’ve lived in Manchester for years but I’ve never been before. It’s incredible, and huge. I don’t think you could get round it all in one day.” Georgia Brown said: “go go go!!! It’s free, it's so relaxed and so much to see, there is an actual zoo in there!!!”\n\nReviewer Mongreladam wrote: “This is on par with the natural history museum in London for its great depth of artefacts…the friendly staff and the fact it’s free!” Michelle C added: “Amazing experience! Crazy to think it was free! Really nicely done museum..even my teenage son loved it.”\n\nDuring your visit you can stop by the Museum Cafe, where breakfast and brunch are served from 8.30am to 11.30am, and lunch between 12-3pm. There is a Coffee Bar in the Main Hall which serves drinks and cakes.\n\nManchester Museum is free to visit. It’s open Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays 10am - 5pm, Wednesday 10am - 9pm, and Saturday 8am-5pm."
