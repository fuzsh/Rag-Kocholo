        "text": "Little Greene is delighted to be the official paint sponsor of Manchester Museum. Following a complete renovation, the museum has been transformed into an inclusive, imaginative and caring space for the diverse communities it serves. An array of colourful and inviting Little Greene shades create a joyful atmosphere that draws visitors through the exhibitions…\n\nWILD Exhibition\n\nManchester Museum’s latest exhibition delves into the topic of biodiversity and our relationship with the natural world. Our bright yellow, Sunlight, fills the space with a sense of positivity and optimism, as visitors explore the different ways that people across the world are rebuilding connection with nature.\n\nThe exhibition also features a number of bold accent shades from the Little Greene palette, which reflect the vibrancy of wildlife and complement the variety of natural history collections, artworks and interactive installations on display.\n\nManchester Museum is the UK’s largest university museum, situated in an impressive building designed by renowned architect, Alfred Waterhouse. Following a much-anticipated transformation, the landmark building has been unveiled to the public for the first time since August 2021, including a two-storey extension plus exciting new exhibitions.\n\nThey worked with designers, The Artistry House, to choose a selection of Little Greene paint colours to bring the vision to life. The project involved creating a new Entrance, Shop, Café, Picnic Area and Main Hall, where visitors instantly feel a sense of welcome thanks to a backdrop of bright and colourful shades. Our much-loved warm neutral, Portland Stone, is used alongside bolder colours like Goblin, Bassoon, Nether Red, Lamp Black and Córdoba to create real impact.\n\nLittle Greene paint colours have been used in both new exhibits and familiar spaces to create a sense of flow throughout the historic building. The beloved Dinosaur gallery has been enlivened with a vibrant colour palette, pairing the tranquil blue-green Aquamarine with accents of Marine Blue. While, in the Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery, the rich deep red, Bronze Red, provides a strong and impactful backdrop. This inspiring new exhibit explores the rich historic and contemporary links between Manchester and China.\n\nOur Creative Director, Ruth Mottershead, said: “At Little Greene, we are always delighted to supply paint for local museums and galleries, and it was a real joy to be part of Manchester Museum’s exciting transformation. This museum is such an important part of our community, and the hello future project will create an even more inclusive and imaginative community hub.\n\nFrom calming neutrals and tranquil green-blues like Portland Stone and Aquamarine, to the strong shades, Lamp Black and Córdoba, the chosen paint colours work beautifully in the grand nineteenth-century building, instantly welcoming visitors and making them feel at home.\n\nWe are so proud to have been involved in such an ambitious project, bringing joyful colour to Manchester Museum as it opens its doors to our diverse community.”"
