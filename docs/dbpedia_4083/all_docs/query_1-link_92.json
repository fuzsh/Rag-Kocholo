From its impressive Victorian architecture to its world-renowned music scene, there’s something to suit every traveler. Visitors can explore the city’s past with museums and historical sites while discovering Manchester’s modern culture. Even if you have only 24 hours in Manchester, you’ll find unique places to explore.\n\nIt was the world’s first industrial city and offers historical sights for visitors that pay homage to this legacy. The city places the love of sports in high esteem, as this is the home of England’s National Football Museum. You can also visit the world-famous football stadium, Old Trafford.\n\nFood lovers will find an abundance of selections for dining. And curry lovers will need to place Rusholme’s curry mile on their must-visit list as it features nearly 70 different Indian restaurants.\n\nWith its range of attractions and activities, visiting Manchester can offer you a memorable experience, even if you only have 24 hours to visit the city.\n\nOur 24 Hours in Manchester\n\nOn our first UK trip, it was goodbye Liverpool and hello Manchester.\n\nDown to our final full day in the UK, we looked forward to our last stop in Manchester.\n\nWe said goodbye to Liverpool late morning and traveled to Manchester via train on a 48-minute ride. We had good conversation during our train ride with an Iraqi traveler who has resided in the UK for two years.\n\nThere is one reason we are in Manchester – it is the closest city to Liverpool from which we can get a flight back to Los Angeles International Airport. So that gives us close to 24 hours in Manchester and we’ll share with you the things we did and things you can do if you have one day this English city.\n\nTop 10 Things To Do in Manchester\n\nIf you only have 24 hours in Manchester, the best place to start is to select activities from the Top 10 Things to Do in Manchester.\n\nThere is no way you’ll be able to pack all the top 10 things into a 24-hour visit. We suggest you pick one or two, fill up the rest of your time with food and drink, and stroll the city streets.\n\nAnd with that, let’s get into our Top 10 Things to Do in Manchester, England.\n\n1. John Rylands Library\n\nVisiting the John Rylands Library in Manchester is a special activity for any history buff. Located just off Deansgate, this stunning 19th-century library houses thousands of rare books and manuscripts that remind us of Manchester’s rich history. The building is an architectural marvel, with soaring columns, grand staircases, and intricate stained-glass windows.\n\nInside, the library houses a vast collection of books and manuscripts, some dating back to the 14th century. There is also an impressive selection of maps, prints, photographs, and other historical artifacts.\n\nThe display includes a papyrus fragment from the Gospel of John from Egypt dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD. This is considered to be the earliest portion of the New Testament ever found and you can view it in Manchester.\n\nWe viewed an 1813 document on a public meeting that was called to oppose Roman Catholic emancipation so that this group would continue to be excluded from holding government seats. This part of the exhibit showcased the historical treatment of minority groups (which Catholics were in Protestant England).\n\nThe books of this library are kept behind glass cases. The rooms we walk into are fairly dark. We wonder if the books are being digitized as the passage of time will ultimately compromise this collection. A docent informs us that such preservation is among the work by the archivists at the library. The digitized results apparently can be viewed online, and we are told to Google search “University of Manchester Luna” to view the collection. This is on the to-do list for after we return home.\n\nFrom the Gothic grandeur of its reading rooms to the wealth of knowledge within its four walls, a visit here demonstrates why the John Rylands Library is a top-rated Manchester landmark. It is free to visit. Expect to spend up to one hour seeing everything inside.\n\n2. Science and Industry Museum\n\nFor those looking to experience a journey of discovery and exploration, a visit to the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester is highly recommended. Set in the heart of the world’s first industrial city, this fascinating museum showcases over 3,000 years of science and industry history.\n\nInside, interactive exhibits offer visitors a unique insight into the city’s industrial past. From ancient inventions such as steam engines to contemporary advances in technology and engineering, the museum provides a comprehensive overview of Manchester’s contribution to science and industry. You can see the world’s oldest surviving passenger railway station and first railway warehouse dating back to 1830.\n\nAlong with its impressive collections, the museum also features an array of educational programs and activities designed to engage and inspire guests of all ages. Plan to spend up to 2 hours.\n\nA visit to the National Football Museum in Manchester is a must for football fans. Located in central Manchester, the museum houses an incredible collection of memorabilia that tells the worldwide football story. From ancient artifacts and match day programs to iconic equipment used by some of the greatest players, there is something here for everyone.\n\nLearn about the origins of football, relive great memories in the sport, and explore how the game of football has become an integral part of world culture. Notable sights include the ball used in the 1966 World Cup Final, iconic shirts, and trophies.\n\nWhether you’re a die-hard football fanatic or simply curious to learn more about the beautiful game, the National Football Museum will surely impress. In addition to its fascinating exhibits, the museum offers interactive displays that allow visitors to experience first-hand what it’s like to be a professional footballer. You’ll find engaging and interactive museums at the museum.\n\nPlan to spend up to 3 hours.\n\n4. People’s History Museum\n\nThe People’s History Museum in Manchester is an absolute must-see for anyone interested in the history of democracy and social justice. This award-winning museum preserves and promotes the story of democratic developments in Britain and the radical ideas that have shaped our world today.\n\nFrom remarkable artifacts such as suffragette banners to interactive displays that explore some of the critical moments in history, visitors will understand what it means to be a part of something bigger than oneself. The museum inspires engagement in equality, social justice, and the creation of a fair world.\n\nThe museum also offers educational programs and discussions that allow visitors to engage with each other meaningfully. If you are interested in the stories of people who stood up to create a more just society, this museum is for you. Whether you’re looking for inspiration or simply curious about our past, the People’s History Museum will leave a lasting impression.\n\nBernard Randall, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n5. Manchester Art Gallery\n\nAs one of the largest and most renowned art galleries in the North West, visiting the Manchester Art Gallery is a popular stop for art lovers.\n\nLocated in central Manchester, the gallery houses a spectacular collection of over 25,000 works worldwide. From Old Masters to contemporary artists, visitors will be spoilt for choice when exploring the gallery’s expansive collection. The fine art collection spans six centuries and is most famous for its collection of 19th-century British paintings. Beyond paintings, you’ll find a variety of decorative arts spanning ceramics, silver, glass, furniture, and clothing.\n\nIn addition to its permanent exhibitions, the gallery hosts various special events, including talks, workshops, and even live music performances.\n\nPlan up to 2 hours for a visit. Admission is free.\n\nDavid Dixon / Manchester Art Gallery\n\n6. Manchester Museum\n\nThe Manchester Museum is a vibrant hub of exploration and discovery. Located in the center of Manchester, the museum houses an impressive worldwide collection covering everything from archaeology to anthropology, art to zoology. Whether you’re looking for something educational, entertaining, or just plain fascinating, there’s something here for everyone.\n\nHighlights include dinosaur fossils and even live amphibians and reptiles.
