The University of Manchester-owned museum is home to so much to see and do, and is incredibly family-friendly. The collection found at the museum ranges from Ancient Worlds, Earth Sciences and Human Remains to Plants, Zoology, Archeology, Living Cultures and the Vivarium. Highlights of the museum include the collections of ancient Egyptian artefacts, which is the largest in the UK, and the award winning Vivarium, home to a comprehensive collection of live reptiles. Apart from the permanent exhibits found here, visitors will also come across a variety of special exhibitions that take place regularly throughout the year.\n\nTicket Price\n\nFree\n\nOpening Hour\n\n10am-5pm\n\nRecommended Visit Duration\n\nAround 3 hours or more\n\nSuitable For\n\nAdults, senior visitors, young adults, families, children\n\nMust See\n\nThe Vivarium, Living Cultures, Ancient World, Archeology\n\nPrayer Facilities\n\nMuslims visiting the Manchester Museum will not be able to find prayer facilities within its premises. They will therefore have to make use of the facilities offered at one of the several mosques and Islamic Centers in Manchester, such as the Manchester Central Mosque, Al Furqaan Mosque, Manchester Islamic Centre & Didsbury Mosque and Makki Masjid.\n\nHalal Food\n\nCafé Muse, located at the Manchester Museum offers a variety of delicious snacks and drinks.
