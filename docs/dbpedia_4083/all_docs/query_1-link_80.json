        "text": "Our Cultural Explorers Programme, aims to provide access to four of the University’s cultural institutions for all 9 year olds from the primary schools located in the local areas of Ardwick, Hulme, Moss Side, Rusholme and Longsight. Manchester Museum, The Whitworth, John Rylands Library Deansgate and Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre have been working together to develop an inspiring out-of-classroom learning experience for these local primary schools.\n\n2015-16, the second year of the Cultural Explorers Programme, has been really successful with 894 local 9 year olds visiting one of the University’s Cultural Institutions for a free hands-on, outside the classroom learning workshop. Children have delved through Manchester’s history with Victorian maps at John Rylands Library, explored constellations in an inflatable observatory at Jodrell Bank, handled real ancient Egyptian artefacts at Manchester Museum and collaborated with artists to create their own pieces of art at the Whitworth. We’re delighted that this year we’ve managed to reach 18 of our targeted 20 schools and so far feedback from teacher and pupils has been excellent.\n\n“The children are loving it – they’ve learnt a lot. They loved the inflatable observatory. The shout of surprise when they saw the telescope was amazing. The teachers loved it because we were welcomed by staff; each workshop was really well run.’” Adam Hossen, Year 5 Teacher, Rolls Crescent (Hulme)\n\n“I think this a fabulous opportunity for children not just in school but outside of school, because they’ve been given wristbands which allows them to visit with their families outside of school, it’s getting their families involved in what their learning about which is opening up further interest and that will naturally lead to more learning.’” Paula Heslop, Teacher, St Chrysostom’s\n\nChildren taking part are given free incentives to return to one of the venues with their families including sketchpads and art equipment, planispheres (to help find stars in the night sky) and free sponsorship of one of the Manchester Museum’s vivarium frogs. The programme is a fantastic opportunity for local people to access the great scientific and cultural resources of the University that are right on their doorstep.\n\nThis short film shows some of the visits from schools during the past few months."
