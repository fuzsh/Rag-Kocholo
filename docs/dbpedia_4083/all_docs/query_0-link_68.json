        "text": "Trending\n\nLidl launches bargain ‘mystery boxes’ full of middle aisle items worth over £100 Emily Sergeant\n\nLidl is launching its first ever series of ‘mystery boxes’ that are each filled full of weird and wonderful middle aisle items.\n\nEvery frequent Lidl and Aldi shopper knows that the supermarkets’ legendary middle aisles are the places to make for if you want to get your hands on a wide range of unexpected bargains – with everything from coffee machines and ukuleles, to goggles, crochet kits, massage guns, and more having popped up there over the years.\n\nBut how do you fancy getting a taste of the ‘Middle of Lidl’ at its finest for just £20? Even better yet if you’re helping charity along the way?\n\nWell now you can, as Lidl is launching its very-own Mystery Boxes that are worth more than £100 each, but for the bargain price of just £20 per box.\n\nJust 1,000 limited-edition boxes will be up for grabs nationwide.\n\nWith the concept of ‘mystery boxes’ recently bursting on to the scene and gaining popularity, with brands such as Nike and Candy Kittens notably jumping on the trend, Lidl says the launch of the Lidl Mystery Box is a “celebration” of the beloved cult-classic ‘Middle of Lidl’ and all its unpredictable product offerings.\n\nThe question is though, what will you get inside the box? In true ‘Middle of Lidl’ fashion, each box presents different surprises, so shoppers could receive a Silvercrest Slushie Maker in one, or get DIY savvy with some Parkside Spanners, and even learn a few chords with a Clifton Ukulele in another.\n\nFor 50 lucky dippers, a shiny ‘Bonus Item Coupon’ will be hidden inside their box too, which unlocks a bigger item worth up to a whopping £199.\n\nEverything from a Grillmeister 2-Burner Gas Barbeque, and a Tower Air Fryer 5 in 1 Smokeless Grill, to a Livarno Garden Furniture Set, or even an Inflatable All-Round Stand-Up Paddle Board are in the mix, so keep your fingers crossed you’re one of the lucky ones.\n\nAnd if all of that wasn’t good enough as it is, all the proceeds from the sales of the 1,000 Lidl Mystery Boxes will be donated to the NSPCC.\n\nKeen to get one then? The 1,000 Lidl Mystery Boxes will be on sale from 10am this Thursday (15 August), while stocks last.\n\nHead to www.lidlmysterybox.co.uk to purchase one.\n\nRead more:\n\nAldi launches new ‘magic bags’ with £10 worth of food for just £3.30\n\nLidl’s iconic trainers have been spotted back in Manchester stores\n\nPeople are discovering a little-known hack that can score teachers tonnes of discounts\n\nFeatured Image – Supplied\n\nTrending\n\nPicturesque Cheshire farm mansion with ‘undisturbed views’ goes on the market for £4.5 million Emily Sergeant\n\nA picturesque farm mansion with “undisturbed views” surrounding it has just gone on the market over in Cheshire.\n\nThe only thing is, you’ll just need the small matter of £4.5 million before you can call it yours.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that the vast majority of people reading this article won’t have £4.5 million just sitting in their bank account right now, and that properties of this size and stature are not the kind we’ll ever get to call home, but if like us, you’ve got no shame in admitting you love looking at houses you can’t afford in places you’ll probably never live, then allow us to introduce you to this absolute stunner.\n\nTake a look inside Hargrave Farm.\n\nLocated in Hargrave – which is one of Cheshire‘s many affluent and sought-after villages known for combining the best of rural living, while still being conveniently close to a wide range of amenities, excellent local schools, and transport links into Greater Manchester, the rest of the North West, and beyond – estate agents say this seven-bedroom home on the doorstep of Chester has so much to offer prospective buyers.\n\nTo put it simply, this historic home is nothing short of “impressive”.\n\nSet amongst an approximately 50-acres of land, with seriously breath-taking views in every direction you look, this exceptional property is approached from a country lane via an electric gated entrance, and opens onto a tree-lined drive that leads to both the house itself, and the accompanying outbuildings and equestrian facilities.\n\nEstate agents say the main house – which extends to around 8,000 sq ft – is an “imposing property” that offers outstanding space for entertaining, a spacious open plan family kitchen with an island and an Aga, and various flexible reception rooms and living quarters.\n\nThe property has a range of spacious bedrooms set over both the first and second floors, making it perfect for growing families of all sizes to move straight into.\n\nNot only that, but in total, the residence boasts a whopping six bathrooms.\n\nAway from the main house, a detached outbuilding provides separate self-contained accommodation in the form of The Oathouse, as well as the potential for a variety of other uses – including home offices, or fitness and leisure space.\n\nThe outside of the property is just as impressive as the inside too.\n\nThe main house and outbuildings are set in what estate agents have referred to as “attractive landscaped grounds” which come complete with well-stocked borders, extensive lawns, and a range of mature and semi-mature specimen trees, but it’s the equestrian element that really sets this property apart from the rest.\n\nThe equestrian facility’s “comprehensive” set-up combines both indoor and outdoor arenas, American barn stabling, and plenty of storage, and it also links directly to the property’s expansive land.\n\nRead more:\n\nThis stunning manor house surrounded by countryside is on the market for £1.6m… and it’s only in Stockport\n\nInside the Grade I-listed Cheshire mansion currently on the market for an eye-watering £11.4m\n\nAndy Burnham pledges to build 10,000 new council houses in Greater Manchester by 2028\n\nHargrave Farm is currently on the market with the Chester branch of national estate agency chain, Savills, for a whopping £1.6 million, and if you fancy taking a closer look, then you can contact the property company to arrange a viewing.\n\nOr you could just take the cheaper route instead and have a nosey at the Rightmove link here.\n\nFeatured image – Savills"
