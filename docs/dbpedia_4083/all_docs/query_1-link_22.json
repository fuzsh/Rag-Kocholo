The collection contains clothes worn by men, women and children from the 17thC to the present-day. Many of the clothes represent the high fashion of the day. Other, much rarer items represent the basic but equally interesting dress of working people, such as the clogs and shawls of Lancashire weavers. There are lively, colourful displays on two floors and a programme of events to interest visitors of all ages.",
