        "text": "All roads lead to PHM\n\nThe boom in cycling the last two year saw more people than ever hopping on the saddle. We asked avid cyclist and former Visitor Experience Supervisor Callum White to share six tried and tested routes to PHM from around Manchester.\n\nDo you cycle around Manchester? Perhaps you’re like members of the historic Clarion cycling club, who enjoyed cycling while discussing radical history. Or maybe you’re simply just trying to cut down on those pesky carbon emissions. Whatever the reason, be reassured that cycling to People’s History Museum (PHM) is easier than ever. In this handy guide, we’ll show you how to cycle to the museum from various parts of Greater Manchester.\n\nFrom Stockport:\n\n40 minute cycle / 7.5 miles from Stockport\n\nThe route from Stockport to Manchester is a fairly simple one.\n\nFrom Stockport town centre join onto the A6 and head in the direction of Manchester.\n\nThis will take you through Levenshulme and then Longsight.\n\nAfter going through Longsight you can take a left to go down the road Plymouth Grove.\n\nFollow this road and turn left across Upper Brook Street to join onto the Oxford Road Corridor where you should see the University of Manchester.\n\nSimply follow this road into Manchester and head into Spinningfields, where you will find the museum on the corner of Bridge Street and Left Bank, on the edge of the River Irwell.\n\nFrom Didsbury:\n\n32 minute cycle / 5.9 miles from Didsbury\n\nThe route from the leafy suburb of Didsbury is probably the best route in terms of cycling infrastructure as nearly all of it features cycle lanes.\n\nIf you’re coming from neighbouring areas it’s a good idea to join this route where you can.\n\nFrom Didsbury Village head towards Manchester on Palatine Road which will lead you onto Wilmslow Road.\n\nFollow Wilmslow Road through Withington, Fallowfield, Rusholme, and then through the Oxford Road Corridor which leads into central Manchester.\n\nSimply follow this road into Manchester and head into Spinningfields, where you will find the museum on the corner of Bridge Street and Left Bank, on the edge of the River Irwell.\n\nFrom Sale, Trafford:\n\n30 minute cycle/ 5.7 miles from Sale, Trafford\n\nThe route from Sale and the Trafford area is well connected to Manchester city centre, though due to the surrounding cycling infrastructure it’s best to only take this journey if you’re confident on your bike.\n\nWe suggest you start at the Waterside in Sale and take the Bridgewater Canal path from outside the building to Stretford and then pick up the A56 road through Sale and into Manchester.\n\nOnce in Manchester head towards Deansgate/Spinningfields and then onto Bridge Street, where you will see the museum on the corner of Bridge Street and Left Bank, on the edge of the River Irwell\n\nFrom Eccles, Salford:\n\n25 minute cycle / 4.2 miles from Eccles, Salford\n\nThe route from Eccles and the Salford area is fairly straightforward and features some good stretches of cycle lanes.\n\nTake Eccles New Road towards Manchester. This road runs alongside the tram into Manchester.\n\nYou can go straight on to Regent Road which will lead you on to Trinity Way and then into Spinningfields where the museum is located.\n\nOr you can avoid Regent Road (as it’s a busy road, though it does feature a dedicated cycle lane) by taking a small diversion on to Liverpool Street which runs parallel to Regent Road – which will lead you on to Trinity Way and then into Spinningfields where the museum is located, on the corner of Bridge Street and Left Bank, on the edge of the River Irwell.\n\nFrom Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside:\n\n38 minute cycle / 7.4 miles from Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside\n\nIf you’re coming from Ashton-under-Lyne and the Tameside area there are two options:\n\nThe first is to take the A635 from Ashton-under-Lyne all the way into Manchester city centre.\n\nThe second option is a more pleasant one but takes much longer; from Ashton-under-Lyne find the Ashton Canal and head towards Manchester.\n\nThis canal roughly runs parallel to the A635 and leads all the way into Manchester and you can get off it at Ancoats.\n\nFollow signs for Deansgate/Spinningfields and then head towards Bridge Street where you will see the museum on the corner of Bridge Street and Left Bank, on the edge of the River Irwell.\n\nA word of warning; the canal can be tricky to navigate in winter due to wet stone and ice, so always be careful to consider the weather and temperature before your journey.\n\nFrom Oldham:\n\n38 minute cycle / 8.1 miles from Oldham\n\nIt’s possible to cycle from Oldham, although the journey is quite a long one!\n\nStarting from Oldham town centre head towards the A62 which will take you all the way to Ancoats.\n\nFollow signs for Deansgate/Spinningfields and then head towards Bridge Street where you will see the museum on the corner of Bridge Street and Left Bank, on the edge of the River Irwell.\n\nA little advice for this route; while a lot of it has cycle lanes it is still a road with a high volume of traffic, so it might be preferable for the more experienced cyclist.\n\nIf you haven’t already, make sure to visit the statue of famous Oldham suffragette Annie Kenney! You’ll also find lots of information on the suffrage movement at PHM\n\nOnce you’ve arrived at the museum, there are bike racks to lock your bike outside the entrance to Open Kitchen Cafe & Bar at PHM located on Bridge Street.\n\nIf you experience any issues, don’t hesitate to give us a bell (a telephone call that is, not your bike bell!) on 0161 838 9190 and PHM staff will be more than happy to assist you in reaching the museum.\n\nThe whole museum is open to explore the past, present, and future of ideas worth fighting for, throughout Family Friendly galleries, new exhibitions, an archive and shop.\n\nAnd don’t miss Open Kitchen Cafe & Bar! Enjoy a sustainable, ethical and delicious new food experience.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you soon."
