        "text": "Inclusive features\n\nAccess in the museum\n\nThere is a ramped entrance from the pavement outside the museum to the front door. There are lifts to all floors and level access to all public spaces, including galleries, the shop, café, toilets and other facilities. You can find a map of the museum here.\n\nWe have wheelchairs and a walking frame with wheels, brakes and a seat available for visitors to use. Please speak to a member of our Visitor Team at the reception desk if you would like to use one during your visit.\n\nAt Manchester Museum, we have three accessible parking spots on Bridgeford Street, which runs along the side of the museum. To access one of these spots, there is a barrier next to UoM Car Park D, Booth Street West (access via Higher Cambridge Street). At the intercom, tell the attendant that you are using Manchester Museum accessible parking and turn left past the barrier. If you require assistance reaching accessible parking or getting to our entrance on Oxford Road, please call us on 0161 275 2648. Alternatively, there is also accessible parking at Manchester Aquatic Centre car park – to help you plan your visit and understand how far it is between the car parks and the museum, we’ve created this video.\n\nPlaces to sit\n\nWe have plenty of places to sit and rest seating throughout the whole museum, including in the Main Hall next to the coffee bar. There is seating in most of the galleries.\n\nPortable folding stools are available to use too – ask a member of our Visitor Team if you need one.\n\nQuiet room\n\nThe quiet room is on floor 1 next to the Egypt and Sudan gallery. It is a quieter space for anyone who needs time away from the galleries for rest, reflection or other reasons. It includes seating and mindful activities such as puzzles and books. Ear defenders are available in the room and at our reception desk.\n\n*Please note, our quiet room will temporarily move to a room next to our Belonging Gallery on Tuesday 16 January, Wednesday 17 January and Thursday 18 January. Ask our Visitor Team for more information.\n\nLockers and buggies\n\nPersonal belongings can be left securely in lockers, which are next to the Main Hall, and there is space to leave your buggy.\n\nD/deaf and hard of hearing\n\nBritish Sign Language (BSL) interpretation and captioning are offered where possible. We have a hearing loop fitted at our reception desk.\n\nBlind and visual impairments\n\nPublic interpretation, signage and digital content complies with RNIB standard. We have large print text available to collect at the reception desk for our galleries, please speak to a member of the Visitor Team on arrival for more information.\n\nGuide and assistance animals – including assistance dogs in training – are welcome at the museum. We ask that they are identified by wearing a jacket, a harness, or a brightly coloured collar and lead during your visit. Water bowls for dogs are available in the café and bowls can be filled using the water fountain in the Welcome area – just ask and our Visitor Team will be happy to help.\n\nTherapy dog\n\nYou might see our therapy dog, Murray, in the museum. Murray is trained to give emotional support to those who need it. We also have a therapy room on our Top Floor. To enquire about a visit from Murray, please contact Karen Brackenridge: karen.brackenridge@manchester.ac.uk.\n\nDigital Touch Replicas\n\nDigital Touch Replicas (DTRs) are physical objects that can be explored by touch. Feeling different areas of the surface triggers hidden electronics, which in turn plays information relating to the area on a screen. Our goal is to create a ground-breaking user experience that enables users to touch and interact with digitally scanned museum artefacts. We have worked with a range of enthusiastic museum colleagues, students and specialists in digital and 3D technology.\n\nPhysical interaction with objects is particularly important for some visitors with sensory impairments and for those who need to make physical connections with objects to make sense of them These replicas are high quality replicas of objects that are physically inaccessible because they are either too fragile to be handled or are displayed within exhibition cases.\n\nWe worked collaboratively with students and teachers from Grange School, a local school for autism, to create co-curate content for the DTRs for the museum’s Golden Mummies of Egypt exhibition and the wider Egyptian collection. This has formed part of the Touching Perspectives project which has been awarded funding from the Digital innovation and Engagement fund supported by the Museums Association, UKRI and AHRC.\n\nThe hope is that this second level of content, combined with being able to haptically explore the replica objects will create a way for neurodivergent children and adults to connect with these objects. This DTR technology, which aims to make museum collections more accessible, is based on research by Sam Beath, Senior Conservator at Manchester Museum, as part of her PhD at Loughborough University. If you wish to know more about this project, please contact Sam via email: sam.beath@manchester.ac.uk\n\nFeedback\n\nWe embrace the social model of disability and hope to build on this model in all our work. We have worked to remove potential barriers for people engaging with our building and collections in response to the diverse needs of our visitors. We have drawn on the skills and passion of our staff with support and guidance from partner organisations and volunteers.\n\nWe are proud of the work we have done so far based on consultations with partners on accessing the museum. We are also aware of how much there is to do and that welcoming visitors back to the museum might help us to identify new needs. We understand there are people who may feel excluded from the museum for different reasons.\n\nWe want to know how we can most efficiently and effectively direct our time and resources to have the greatest impact in making all people feel welcome and able to enjoy an equitable experience.\n\nIf you have feedback for us, can’t find what you’re looking for or you require additional assistance during your visit, we will do our best to support you:\n\nmuseum@manchester.ac.uk\n\n0161 275 2648\n\nThis website has been created to comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
