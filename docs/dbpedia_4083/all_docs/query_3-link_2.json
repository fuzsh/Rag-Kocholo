        "meta_description": "Manchester Museum has been at the heart of the city&rsquo;s cultural scene for more than 130 years &ndash; and is only getting better with age. As one of the UK&rsquo;s biggest university museums &ndash; sat at the heart of the University of Manchester &ndash; it&rsquo;s home to an incredible range of collections, covering everything from archaeology to zoology, natural history to human cultures. And no visit to Manchester is complete without saying hello to Stan, the eye-catching Tyrannosaurus rex who is the star of the Museum&rsquo;s Fossils and Dinosaur Gallery and has become something of a celebrity in the city. Wander through the stunning galleries and lose yourself in stories of what it means to be human, including the moving, personal narratives of the South Asia Gallery, co-curated with 30 inspiring community members, and the vibrant collections of the Chinese Culture Gallery. Rethink your relationship with the natural world, while enjoying amazing natural science collections that underpin vital conservation work. Unusually, its collections even include live amphibians and lizards - Manchester Museum is the only place in the world outside Panama where you&rsquo;ll see the extraordinarily beautiful and critically endangered harlequin toad. Find a sense of joy and connection through events that bring communities together to celebrate, share and learn, from Vaisakhi to Lunar New Year and Africa Day. In February 2023, the Museum completed a major, values-led redevelopment that created new gallery spaces and visitor facilities with collaboration and co-creation at their heart. So you&rsquo;ll find a beautiful picnic area, a spacious prayer room for all, a quiet room and Changing Places toilet, as well as a vegetarian caf&eacute; and a shop full of unique gifts, including exclusives created in collaboration with local makers and craftspeople. Exhibition Hall&nbsp; The Exhibition Hall is home to ambitious shows that explore past, present and future and engage with global and local narratives. The opening exhibition,&nbsp; Golden Mummies of Egypt, &nbsp;offered visitors unparalleled access to the Museum&#39;s world-class Egypt and Sudan collection and aimed to challenge Victorian narratives of &lsquo;ancient Egypt&rsquo; through new research from the University of Manchester. It was followed by&nbsp; Wild,&nbsp; which runs until 1 June 2025.&nbsp; Wild &nbsp;explores our relationship with the natural world and looks at how people across the globe are creating, rebuilding and repairing connections with nature. It asks whether going &lsquo;wild&rsquo; can help us to tackle the climate and biodiversity crisis. South Asia Gallery, a British Museum partnership&nbsp; The South Asia Gallery, a British Museum partnership, is the first permanent gallery in the UK to celebrate the lived experiences and contributions of the South Asian diaspora. Co-curated with the South Asia Gallery Collective, a group that includes community leaders, educators and artists, the gallery explores the connection between South Asia and Britain and the legacy of Empire, alongside contemporary South Asian culture and creativity. World-class collections from Manchester Museum and the British Museum are complemented by personal objects, such as a World War I uniform that belonged to the great-grandfather of a Collective member, as well as new commissions, including a rickshaw decorated by artists from Bangladesh and Manchester and a stunning mural created by artists The Singh Twins Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery The Lee Kai Hung Chinese Culture Gallery highlights personal stories of migration, friendship and collaboration to inspire empathy and build understanding. Developed in partnership with the University&rsquo;s Manchester China Institute, it draws on historical and contemporary links between Manchester and China. Showcasing rarely and never-displayed collections from cultural partners across the city, visitors will delve through personal stories and objects such as a late Qing dynasty (1636&ndash;1912) &lsquo;Manchu&rsquo; headdress decorated with blue kingfisher feathers and a 20-metre scroll showing Emperor Kangxi&rsquo;s birthday procession through the streets of Beijing in the 18th century. Fossils and Dinosaur Gallery Visitors can learn what it means to think like a palaeontologist while meeting some of the Museum&rsquo;s best-loved characters. Stan the Tyrannosaurus rex has become something of a Manchester celebrity over the past 20 years, captivating visitors young and old, and was recently joined by April the Tenontosaurus. The Museum worked with a team of Earth Science students from the University of Manchester, whose painstaking research has allowed April&rsquo;s skeleton to stand on all fours again. Living Worlds and Nature&rsquo;s Library Living Worlds and Nature&rsquo;s Library display some of the museum&rsquo;s collections of natural history specimens &ndash; from zoology, entomology, botany and earth sciences &ndash; to raise awareness of the incredible diversity of life on Earth. The galleries aim to inspire a deeper appreciation and connection with nature and encourage positive actions that benefit our planet and our health and wellbeing. The skeleton of a sperm whale has watched over the gallery for over 130 years. The Vivarium The Vivarium houses a collection of live amphibians and reptiles including many critically endangered species. It is unusual for a museum to care for live animals, but Manchester Museum has done so for 60 years, offering a unique opportunity to see rare and beautiful creatures and watch conservation in action.
