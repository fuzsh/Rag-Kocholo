        "text": "Non-native (= alien) species can be a problem for any country because of the potential threat they may pose to local biodiversity and ecosystems. In 2009 (the last time a proper inventory was conducted), a number of non-native species in England was in excess of 3,500 species. About 10-15% of these are considered invasive, i.e. capable of having a negative impact on the environment, economy or human health. There are 12,000 non-native species already established in Europe and about 2,000 alien species (54 indoors only) in Britain, and a further 10–12 become established annually.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of introduced insect species appears to be the Manchester Moth. This species was introduced to the UK (Salford) from California in 1829, collected once and described as a new species (Euclemensia woodiella) and then disappeared (see here).\n\nMost alien species introduced to Britain are originally from Europe, but in recent decades Asia and temperate North America have become major contributors of British non-native fauna and flora. To date, at least 20 species of spider had established themselves in Britain.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, I was contacted by his colleague from Exeter University who reported an unknown jumping spider which was observed and caught at the Tremough campus in Penryn (near Falmouth), United Kingdom. Immatures and adult females were found on 29 April and 07 May 2023, adult males and females and immatures were also collected on 17 May 2023. Further summer survey showed that spiders were still present and could be discovered by beating shrubs and trees between 50cm and 2.5m above the ground. It seemed that this spider species is likely to have established a reproducing population, at least on the university campus.\n\nA sample of two males and one female was sent to me, and on examination was found to contain an unknown species of Salticidae that is not native to either the UK or continental Europe. Further study revealed that it belongs to an undescribed species of the Caribbean genus Anasaitis Bryant, 1850 (see on the photo).\n\nThe species was described, named and dedicated to our recently deceased colleague, a keen natural historian and Honorary Curator at the Manchester Museum, Mrs Claire Miles (1958–2023).\n\nFor the moment, this spider species is known only from the Tremough campus, Penryn, Cornwall, United Kingdom. However, the actual origin of this species is yet to be revealed. The genus Anasaitis is essentially Caribbean, whereas the country of origin of the British population and the date of its actual arrival to the UK remain unknown.\n\nIt is known that alien jumping spiders were among those spider groups that were first introduced (or, better said, first recorded as being introduced) to Europe, dating back to the first half of the 19th century: viz., Menemerus bivittatus in 1819 and Plexipus paykulli in 1831 (see here). Both species (currently pantropical) successfully established in south-western Europe, but not in the UK. To date, 18 accidentally imported jumping spiders have been reported from England, of the approximately 50 species of all alien spiders recorded. Only two of them – Hasarius adansoni (here and here) and the newly described Anasaitis milesae – have been able to successfully colonise Britain; the former is known only from greenhouses and other indoor environments.\n\nDr Dmitri Logunov, Honorary Research Fellow at the Manchester Museum\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThis is the latest blogpost in the series summarising publications based on specimens from Manchester Museum’s (MM) Entomology Collection over the last academic year. Three papers from 2019 and 2020, not recorded in previous blogposts, are also included. A total of 14 papers were published in the period between 1 August 2022 to 31 July 2023 including references to specimens from our collection. Topics include phylogenetic and taxonomic studies, ecological behaviour, distribution and impact of introduced species and an obituary for the collector Stan Dobson whose spider collection is housed at the museum. There are also several descriptions of new species in three arthropod groups, and a new genus described in spiders (Araneae). The publications were authored by more than 35 researchers, with first authors from nine countries: Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, England, Finland, Germany, India, Russia and Spain. The full list of publications can be found below.\n\nThe majority of the papers were devoted to descriptions of new species: spiders from Iran, British Overseas Territories, South-East Asia and Turkey; fairyflies/fairy wasps from India; and beetles from Colombia (Figure 1a). Over half of the papers focused on spiders (Araneae), with the remaining half focusing on four other arthropod groups (Figure 1b).\n\nAccounts of the Museum’s Collections\n\nMarcus Bevilaqua and Claudio da Fonseca, undertook a review of the type specimens of the genus Passsalus housed at Manchester Museum. The review includes redescriptions, new illustrations, unrecorded characteristics and morphometrics, all of which will support future taxonomic and phylogenetic studies (Bevilaqua & Fonseca 2020). The species were originally described by Walter Douglas Hincks, British Entomologists and Keeper of Entomology at the Manchester Museum from 1947 to his death in 1961. The type specimens have been previously published in The Passalidae collection (Coleoptera) of the Manchester Museum, UK, with a complete type catalogue (Miles 2017).\n\nStan Dobson was a British arachnologist from Manchester, who contributed to spider records across Northern England and was an Honorary Member of the British Arachnological Society (BAS). Dobson’s spider collection, field notebooks and illustrations are housed in the Entomology Department at MM. Most of the collection has been labelled and ordered, but there is still some unsorted material and unidentified specimens from different localities. We are now in the process of re-curating and accessioning this collection (Logunov 2023a).\n\nThe Entomology Collection’s new digital microscope (Olympus SZX16 stereo microscope, DP27 Digital Colour Camera and Helicon Focus software) was used to take high resolution, detailed photographs of specimens to describe new species of Iranian jumping spiders. These descriptions are within a review of the group (Logunov 2023b).\n\nHighlights from other papers and authors\n\nLaurence Cook and John Muggleton analysed the frequencies of the melanic forms of the Asian Box-tree moth Cydalima perpsectalis in Europe and Britain, a species which has recently spread and is becoming well established in the region. Using data collected from Hampshire and Wiltshire during 2020-2022, the different morph frequencies were recorded. Possible reasons for such an increase in range are examined in the paper, with human transport of infected plants contributing to this expansion (Cook & Muggleton 2023).\n\nSpecimens from the collection were used to build the phylogenetic relationships of the karschiellid earwigs. DNA was extracted from identified museum specimens from around the world, amplified and compared with molecular evolutionary models (Kocárek et al. 2023).\n\nSpecimens of Passalus (Pertinax) were used for a taxonomic review and aided in the description of a new beetle species in Colombia (Jiménez‑Ferbans et al. 2022).\n\nNews from the Entomology Department\n\nAfter being the Curator of the Arthropod Collection at the Manchester Museum for more than 20 years, Dr. Dmitri Logunov announced his retirement. Dmitri will continue supporting the Entomology Department as Research Associate and Honorary Curator. His knowledge and experience will always be appreciated and valued here at the collection. Dmitri is currently working towards writing a complete account of the spider collection housed at MM. He is also providing better storage, documenting, accessioning and rehousing several spider collections with support from volunteers. Additionally, he authored four publications focussing on descriptions of new spider species – Araneae (Logunov 2023a; Logunov 2023b; Logunov & Ozernoy 2022; Sherwood, Henrard, Logunov & Fowler 2023).\n\nAll staff and volunteers at the Museum and the Entomology Department wish him all the very best for the future.\n\nSadly, Claire Miles, former volunteer, curatorial trainee and Honorary Curator, passed away in August 2023. Claire re-curated the collection of type specimens of earwigs (Dermaptera) and Passalidae beetles (Coleoptera). She published several papers while working at MM Entomology Department. A list of her papers can be found here. Claire will be greatly missed at the Museum and at the Entomology Department.\n\nOur deepest condolences to her family and friends.\n\nA complete list of the publications\n\n(Note there are two papers from 2019 and 2020 previously not recorded)\n\nAnwar P.T., F.

This blogpost is by Przemyslaw Glomski, undergraduate student at University of Manchester and reflects his curiosity for insects and his idea on developing a science communication project.\n\nBy Przemyslaw Glomski\n\nManchester Museum’s vast Entomology collection is awe-inspiring; however, the specimens rarely get a chance to be in the spotlight. As a Zoology student studying at the University of Manchester, I decided to dedicate my final year project towards the collection and displaying it to the public. I worked closely with the Museum to create an educational resource to use mainly in the classroom but also in other educational settings.\n\nThe educational resource that I created focuses on the importance of beetles (order Coleoptera) and highlights interesting phenomena displayed by this group, such as mimicry. Coleoptera is one of the most speciose insect groups, accounting for about 25% of the entire world’s animal species diversity. Even with such an abundance of beetles, they are often overlooked as important keystone species. For this reason, the resource I created aims to inspire a younger audience about the importance of entomology and more specifically beetles.\n\nSpecimens used\n\nAll the specimens used in the resource came directly from the Entomology Collection, Manchester Museum. Altogether, four boxes of specimens were created. The first box highlighted the wide diversity of beetles found in the UK (Rove Beetle – Cerophilus maxillosus, Great Diving Beetle – Dytiscus marginalis, Bloody-nosed Beetle – Timarcha tenebricosa, Oil Beetle – Meloe violaseus, Leafe Beetle – Chrysolina cercalis, Leaf Beetle – Chrysolina banksi, Wasp Beetle – Clytus arietis, Timberman Beetle – Acanthocinus aedilis, Stag Beetles – Lucanus cervus, Horned Dung Beetle – Copris lunaris, Dor Beetle – Geotrupes stercorarius, Burying Beetle – Nicrophorus humator, Burying Beetle – Nicrophorus investigator, Cockchafer – Melolontha melolontha, Cellar Beetle – Blaps mucranata, Rose Chafer – Cetonia aurata, Field Tiger Beetle – Cicindella campestris).\n\nThe second box contained UK ladybirds: Seven-spot Ladybird – Coccinella septempunctata, Two-spot Ladybird – Adalia bipunctata, Eyed Ladybird – Anatis ocellata, Cream-spot Ladybird – Calvia quattuordecimguttata, and Harlequin Ladybird – Harmonia axyridis.\n\nThe third box had two non-UK beetles. Firstly, a Goliath Beetle (Goliaphus regius), found in the tropical regions of Africa, and secondly, a Hercules Beetle (Dynastes hercules), found in Central and Southern America.\n\nThe last box highlighted how mimicry is present in nature. This box contained wasp-mimicking hoverflies (Syrphidae) with the following text “These hoverflies are perfectly harmless and mimic wasps which have a nasty sting. All have yellow and black bodies, but some also have more subtle mimicry – when at rest wasps fold their wings along their bodies; hoverflies cannot do this, but in some species, the leading edge of the wing is darkened giving the impression that the wings are folded at rest. Other hoverflies are evolving longer antennae like their wasps’ models, and many adopt a zig-zag like flight to look even more like wasps!\n\nBased on these boxes, two fun tasks were created to increase pupil engagement and independence. The first task was to list differences they could see between a Seven-spot Ladybird and a Hercules Beetle. This was an interactive task that got students thinking about how wide the biodiversity of beetles actually is. The second task, “Find the Imposters”, involved five images, three of them being wasps and two being wasp beetles. The pupils were asked to be detectives that can find the difference between the wasps and the beetles. This task introduced the topic of mimicry so that the pupils could see how some animals can be deceptive in their appearance and how hard it can be to tell the difference.\n\nUsing the educational resource\n\nThe educational resource was used in Hillcrest Academy, Leeds, on the 30th of March 2023 and obtained a lot of positive feedback from the teachers and pupils. Having the chance to see real-life Museum specimens up close was a new and exciting experience for many pupils. After giving the lesson, multiple students were motivated to visit the museum’s collection so they could see all the interesting specimens themselves. Alongside the interactive tasks, I made a presentation that described the beetles, and all the important ecological roles they play. The same boxes and activities were used in the Manchester Museum at the Earth Day Celebration on the 22nd of April 2023. Everyone that attended got to see how impressive beetles can get and got a chance to find the beetle imposters themselves.\n\nOverall, the educational resource has been shown to be beneficial and useful in school and museum educational settings in the two trials. It has always been my hope to create an educational resource that can be used by anyone to educate the public about Coleopterans, and I hope that this resource starts to work towards that aim. If you are interested in either looking at or using the resource, please get in contact with the Museum. We are also interested in continuing to develop it to make it more accessible, so feedback from users is always welcome.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThere is no better time to celebrate and recognise the support of museum volunteers, and particularly those in the Entomology during this Christmas festive season. While the Manchester Museum has been closed to visitors due to the “hello future project” (see here for more information), our volunteers have embarked on a different journey from the galleries to behind-the-scenes, showing the same enthusiasm and full dedication for the collections as they do to the museum visitors (see here the blogpost by Kate Glynn, Volunteer Manager).\n\nDuring the last two years, since the Museum was closed, volunteers, usually in the galleries, have had the opportunity to support different collections and departments. They have played a key role in the Conservation Department helping to prepare the Japanese Incense Burner, which will become one of the central pieces in the newly built Museum’s entrance. Yet, in the Herbarium, they have been cataloguing plant specimens, transcribing labels with old, sometimes difficult to read handwriting, and bagging pressed plants to prevent the spreading of such biscuit beetles.\n\nSince May 2022, the Entomology Department welcomed four enthusiastic volunteers. After an introduction given by Dmitri Logunov (former Curator of Arthropods) about possible tasks, our expectations and time required; it came as a big surprised when all the attendees decided to take up the challenge and to become part of the behind the scenes volunteer team. With no previous experience required, they were in good hands with full support from our small team along the way.\n\nThe Museum volunteers, Angharad, Niamh, Margaret and Vivien committed 4 hours per week, sometimes spending more time in the Entomology. They support re-arranging and documenting of the departmental archive, also and rehousing and databasing our spirit-preserved collections. A brief description of the tasks chosen by each volunteer is given below.\n\nAngharad Denby has been rehousing Richard (Dick) Jones’ spider collection (around 10,000 tubes) acquired in 2017. This collection was re-curated and documented in 2019 but is still kept in small glass tubes with plastic stoppers in its original cabinet. However, a recent inspection revealed a high evaporation rate of the ethanol from sample tubes. It then became a priority to have this collection rehoused and stored more securely in the larger jars, in the spirit store. Angharad’s task is to change plastic stoppers of small glass tubes for cotton wool stoppers and to rehouse them in medium sized glass jars with clip-tops and airtight seals. She also conducts a similar task for Eric Duffey’s spider collection.\n\nNiamh Roche has been supporting the digitization of the archive materials of Eric Duffey donated to the Museum by Rita Duffey (Eric’s widow). Eric was an ecologist and conservationist; he conducted spider faunas surveys in Britain and European regions. His archive contains long lists of species, habitats, maps from 1972, stories of spider bites and correspondence with other researchers. For more information about Eric’s legacy and life, see his obituary here.\n\nVivien Mentern has been documenting a collection of European spiders donated by A. Russell-Smith. She is giving unique accession number to the samples, documenting species and specimens numbers and storing them more securely in clip-top jars after changing the plastic stopper to cotton wool ones. Her task will continue with the digitisation of the gained information to the Museum’s database.\n\nMargaret McCadden has been digitizing beetle family (order Coleoptera) data from Colin Johnson (former Keeper of Entomology and British coleopterist). His archive contains species lists, many personal letters and documents, photographs and original beetle illustrations that were donated to the Museum by his family after Colin sadly passed away (see his obituary here). Margaret has made a digital list of the Manchester Museum Annual Reports from 1895 to 2003 also kept in the entomological archive. She also helps us to digitise the paperwork related to Acquisitions and Donations from 2004 to 2019.\n\nWe would like to thank Phillip Rispin (former Curatorial Assistant and Honorary Curator) for his dedication to the collection and for sharing his knowledge and passion with visitors, researchers and volunteers.\n\nWe would also like to mention the work and commitment from the collection volunteers, many of them have gained experience in working with natural history collections and others have developed a real interest in insects. Many thanks to Beth Moran, Emily Hill, Piotr Korpak, James Jepson, Michael Pentland, Robert Tracey, Michael Dockery (Honorary Curator) and Libby (volunteered in Entomology for 3 months). The support given by all the volunteers will help us to better maintain and keep our entomological collections and increase their usefulness and value for various users.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe following text is the second part of our online tours around the Manchester Museum; the first tour is here. This time we are presenting a brief overview of the museum’s gallery called ‘Living Worlds’.\n\nThe ‘Living Worlds’ gallery sits at the heart of the oldest galleries of the Manchester Museum, which were purpose built to show their newly acquired natural history collections. The striking views of the cases and the balconies to the floors above are similar now to how they were in 1912, but without game trophies on its columns. The view includes the skeleton of the sperm whale, hanging suspended over the gallery floor after its discovery in Massachusetts in February 1896 (Fig. 1).\n\nDespite the historic setting, the gallery today aims to move away from a traditional understanding of nature when it is presented as if existing in far off countries, separate from people. ‘Living Worlds’ puts people back into nature and describes its role in our everyday lives. Different ecosystems of our planet vary from polar lands to tropical forests, all full of life adapted to live in those conditions (Fig. 2). The life surrounding us could be viewed with fascination or fear, as something to exploit or to protect or as something to admire or to understand how it works (Fig. 3).\n\nEach case in Living Worlds takes a theme exploring one way in which people might connect with nature, either past of present. For example, the taxidermy tiger takes centre stage in a story about hunting for sport and trophy collecting. The tiger stands as if frozen in the moment of attack, telling us more about how the species was predominantly seen by Victorian society and about how the hunter wanted to be remembered, as a conqueror (Fig. 4). In comparison, other animals, such as those which came to the museum after living their lives at Belle Vue Zoo, are in poses which aim to show people how they may have behaved in life.\n\nWe all rely on nature in our daily lives. There are the very practical things, like food, clothing and shelter, but there are also less tangible ways we rely on nature. Having access to greenspaces and nature is known to help our own sense of wellbeing, helping us stay healthy, find a sense of place and of peace. We also use nature to help us communicate complex ideas about ourselves, our cultures and organisations. By a symbolic view of animals and plants we represent ourselves in the way we want to be seen or interpreted. The industrious and communal bee is the symbol of Manchester, whereas the bee has long been a universal symbol of ethical virtues, such as diligence, sociability, purity, wisdom, hard-work and community (Fig. 5).\n\nToday, many animals and plants are threatened in the wild, and museum collections hold examples of species which are already extinct (Fig. 6). Human activities such as agriculture, deforestation or mining can make it hard or impossible for nature to find the space to thrive, or even to co-exist with us. Many charities, organisations and individuals work to keep ecosystems healthy and make room for wildlife. How we view nature and the choices we all make in our day-to-day lives all has an impact on the natural world around us (Fig. 7).\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nManchester Museum is part of the University of Manchester and one of the UK’s leading university museums, holding more than 4.5 million objects and specimens, ranged across nature and culture. The Museum has eight main permanent galleries that reflect its main mission to build understanding between cultures and a more sustainable world. Here is a brief survey of the Museum’s gallery called ‘Nature’s Library’.\n\nNatural history museum collections include specimens from zoology, botany, entomology, palaeontology and mineralogy, as well as documentation associated with them. Recent estimates suggest that the number of natural history specimens in British museums exceeds 100 million. The vast majority of such collections (c. 95%) are kept in storage, behind the scenes (Fig. 1: on the left). But does this mean that these collections are not used? Far from it, we care for these collections as an irreplaceable resource for research, education and inspiration. Natural history collections act as ‘libraries’, in which a separate specimen can be seen as a letter or word, and an individual collection as that of a paragraph or section in a giant ‘Book of Knowledge’. The Nature’s Library gallery why we have natural history collections, where they came from, why we continue to keep them and collect more, how such collections are used, and why are they still relevant today?\n\nNatural history collections are the result of the curiosity and private passions of thousands of people, each with their own motivations for collecting. Living things, shells and rocks are often very beautiful or intriguing to look at, with endless variety of shapes, colours, patterns and textures (Fig. 1: on the right). Each specimen in the Museum is identified by a unique ‘accession number’. Information on each specimen is recorded in a Museum’s Register book and database. The Manchester Museum continues to collect, because collections have to be relevant to people and their needs today (Fig. 3).\n\nThe Manchester Museum is part of the University of Manchester, and has been open to the public since 1891. Thousands of schoolchildren, students and researchers use the Museum each year, for study, research and enjoyment (Fig. 4). The Museum is a unique place where visitors can see real objects, have access to experts and develop their own curiosity. Historic natural history collections are a rich resource of historical information about people, places and links to our colonial past. Designers and artists draw inspiration from their remarkable variety of forms, colours and patterns, exploring new ways of seeing and presenting the world around us. The Museum has about 250 enlarged models of plants and animals. These were used to teach students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and are still used for outreach programmes and undergraduate teaching today (Fig. 5).\n\nThe fundamental value of natural history collections is related to our understanding of the Earth’s diversity. The Manchester Museum holds large collections that were assembled by researchers who studied particular organisms and described new species. In the gallery you can find some of the thousands of specimens collected by HMS Challenger, during the first scientific expedition (1872-76) to explore the deep ocean (Fig. 6).\n\nNatural history collections offer a unique opportunity for understanding the world around us, providing data over a vast time span ranging from millions of years ago (minerals and fossils) to the present day. These data reveal changes in environmental conditions and their consequences from deep time to within human history, and help us build up a better, sustainable future (Fig. 7).\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThis blogpost is the latest of the annual series summarizing publications based on Manchester Museum’s Entomology Collection over the last academic year. A total of 32 paper were published in the period between 1 August 2021 to 31 July 2022 referring to the specimens from our collection. Topics included the analysis of historical data, the support of conservation programs or ecological studies, and the legacy of collectors (including former Keeper of Entomology, Colin Johnson; Figure 1a). Descriptions of new species and accounts of particular MM’s arthropod collections are also presented. The publications were authored by more than 50 researchers from 12 countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Finland, Israel, Russia, Ukraine, India, Japan, South Africa and the UK), their list is given below.\n\nThe majority of the papers were devoted to descriptions of new species: viz., spiders from Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Russia, Ukraine, India, Nepal and Kenya; beetles from Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Zambia, China and Taiwan; and stick insects from Vietnam (Figure 1a). Over two thirds of the papers focused on spiders (Araneae), with the remaining third dealing with five other arthropod groups (Figure 1b).\n\nThe value of sharing data from specimens\n\nThe MM’s Entomology Department was one of many natural history museums and societies supporting conservation initiatives. By gathering and using historical data from specimens and records of the Chequered skipper butterfly Carterocephalus palaemon (Pallas, 1771), Wildman et al. obtained a better understanding of how this species declined to extinction in England in 1976 and used this information to recommend conservation activities for other declining or endangered species. Records of this species, including those from the Manchester Museum, are now part of the Butterflies for the New Millennium (BNM) database created by Butterfly Conservation and the Biological Records Centre (BRC) (Wildman et al. 2022).\n\nThe updated checklist of four families of the order Diptera (Atelestidae, Brachystomidae, Empididae and Hybotidae) for Lancashire and Cheshire is not just a species list. Compiled by Phil Brighton using museum specimens and other sources, including local and national recording schemes, the paper includes relevant information on distribution, ecology, habitats requirements, and national and local conservation status. Data from the records and specimens assembled by former Museum’s Keepers, Harry Britten (from 1920 and 1950) and Alan Brindle (1950s), made a major contribution to this checklist (Brighton 2021).\n\nNews from the Entomology Department\n\nColin Johnson, the last person to hold the title Keeper of Entomology at the Manchester Museum (1982 – 2003) sadly passed away last year. Colin was an internationally renowned expert on beetles who described an amazing number of species new to science (especially tiny beetles of the family Ptiliidae, Cryptophagidae and Latriididae; for more information see in the blogpost “A life devoted to describing tiny beetles”). Colin contributed greatly to the expansion of the British Coleoptera at MM (92% of known British beetles are represented in the collection). An account on Colin’s work and legacy was compiled and published by his friend, Roger Dennis, in the obituary published by the Entomologist’s Monthly Magazine (Dennis 2022; Figure 2).\n\nJ. C. Otero & J. M. Pereira described Atomaria (Atomaria) johnsoni, a new species of the family Cryptophagidae from China, dedicated to Colin Johnson (Otero & Pereira 2022), making a total of 19 species named after him.\n\nAccounts of the Museum’s collections\n\nA paper on the collections of mites and ticks (Acari) in the Manchester Museum, written by two of our honorary curators (Graham Proudlove and Laurence Cook) and the Curator of Arthropods (Dmitri Logunov), gives a brief account of the history of the collections and collectors (including the work of former Museum keepers and assistants). It is also includes an analysis of historical specimens and material acquired in the last decade, for the first time. This collection of 2900 slides preparations was recently recurated, documented and stored in the original standard Hill units and drawers (Proudlove et al. 2022; Figure 3a&b). This paper immediately started generating numerous enquires regarding this collection, which was never published before.\n\nA publication regarding a small butterfly collection from Sierra Leone, given by Lieutenant Leech in 1895, explores not only the social life of the century and the colonial past, but also shares information on the natural heritage of west Africa. This collection had not previously been documented, apart from the handwritten labels. It contains 93 identified species of butterflies, moths and insects of various orders as well as other material. The specimens were collected between 1891 and 1893 in the vicinity of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, however there are uncertainties about collection localities for a group of specimens. Many butterflies were kept in triangular paper envelops (Figure 4a). The specimens have been mounted, labelled, identified and accessioned (Cook et al. 2022; Figure 4a&b).\n\nIn June 2022, a Special Issue (Vol 19) of Arachnology, edited by Dmitri Logunov, published 24 papers and proceedings from a symposium celebrating the life and legacy of John and Frances Murphy and Mike Roberts. Members of the British Arachnological Society (BAS), speakers from 39 countries and many spider enthusiasts, attended the online event. All symposium talks are available via the BAS YouTube channel. This volume contains eight papers based on the symposium presentations and 16 other contributions (freely available here).\n\nWithin the Special Issue, the scientific legacy of Murphy’s publications and archival material was analysed and summarised by Logunov (Logunov 2022a). This paper also includes a brief account of Frances and John’s life, fieldwork (Figure 5) and a brief description of the spider collection assembled over 45 years (Logunov 2022a; Arzuza Buelvas 2018). The Murphy Spider Collection and their archival materials are available at the Manchester Museum.\n\nThe issue also contained seven more taxonomy papers based on specimens of the Murphy spider collection (Azarkina 2022; Ballarin & Pantini 2022; Sherwood et al. 2022; Logunov 2022d; Pett 2022; Tanasevitch 2022; Zonstein & Marusik 2022). New species and a new genus from Kenya, and new species from Italy were described (Azarkina 2022; Ballarin & Pantini 2022; Pett 2022; Zonstein & Marusik 2022). The issue also contained an annotated catalogue of tarantulas (family Theraphosidae) retained at the Manchester Museum (Sherwood et al. 2022; Figure 6).\n\nHighlights of other papers and authors\n\nLaurence Cook and Chris Shortall analysed the frequencies of melanic forms of three moths over the last century, including the melanic morph, carbonaria, of the Peppered Moth Biston betularia, using data of the Rothamsted Insect Survey. This industrial melanic morph was not present in the analysed data. However, the intermedia morph (Biston betularia insularia) and the industrial melanic forms of the Scalloped Hazel (Odontoptera bidentata) and the Pale Brindled Beauty (Apocheima pilosaria) were found widely over Britain. Possible reasons to this finding are discussed in the paper (Cook & Shortall, 2022).\n\nSpecimens of stick insects, genus Trachythorax, were used in a review of this taxonomic group. This project examined specimens from related taxa including type materials, records of images and data collected during citizen science initiatives and described stick insects new to science from Vietnam (Bresseell, J. & Constant, J. 2021; Figure 7).\n\nA complete list of the publications:\n\nAzarkina, G.

The main idea was to develop interest in wildlife among local residents of this park in Oldham, which used to be a railway track.\n\nThe weather was perfect and the event itself was really a success. As soon as we set up our display table, some 40 minutes earlier than the official opening of the actual event, many interested visitors started to appear and engage with us. We shared stories about British insects, habitats and facts about their life cycles and natural histories, as well as showing some British endangered species and, of course, some showy foreign beauties. Other organizations, such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds – RSPB with birdwatching activity for kids and families, also supported this event. The hedgehog conservation group was talking about chances to create a more attractive environment for hedgehogs and discussing them with the local recording group.\n\nThe day was packed with many other activities for adults and children, including craft making, face painting and even tree-planting. There were also stalls with home-baked cakes, plants and goodies for selling, all towards fundraising for the maintenance of the Royton Linear Park.\n\nThis community group was established a year ago and have been working to keep this area free of litter/wastes and more family friendly. There are plans for different sections of the park, including incorporating art in tunnels and bridges. However, the most ambitious plan is to create a wildlife corridor connecting this linear park with other green areas/spaces in Oldham and Rochdale; ultimately, improving this green space for the benefit of the local residents and wildlife.\n\nMany thanks are due to Shirley Brown (the leader and organizer of the group and the event) for inviting us to participate. We were thrilled by positive responses from the visitors and amazed by how many people visited the Manchester Museum and remembered our Spider Crab.\n\nIf anyone reading this post wants to be involved and support Shirley Brown and her small group of enthusiasts, just join the Friends of Royton Linear Park on Facebook.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nWhen a taxonomist is going to name a new species, s/he must designate a particular specimen as the reference standard of that species. Such specimen – one particular butterfly, pressed plant or mineral – is called the name-bearing type (=holotype). It is permanently associated with the published scientific name and official description of the species. Type specimens serve as the primary and unique references for all known species names. They play a key role in stabilizing the use of species names. The type must be unambiguously designated, because it is required for identifying other specimens or validating the use of a name. Types are deposited in reliable natural history museums, properly cared for and made available to researchers that need to examine them.\n\nSimilarly to the International Bureau of Weights and Measures which establishes a common understanding of such units as length, mass, time, electric current and others, natural history museums keep type specimens to provide unequivocally links to species names. A number of the type specimens in a particular museum reflects its scientific significance and international standing. The Manchester Museum holds some 22,000 types representing over 8,000 species names, and the number of the types is growing. The Museum is one of the most important taxonomic depositaries in the UK.\n\nTraditionally, type specimens are kept in behind-the-scenes stores of natural history museums and never displayed. Their primary role is to support taxonomic research. Below a selection of type specimens from different collections of the Manchester Museum is presented.\n\nWell, the work of a taxonomist could apparently be compared even to that of a detective.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe Manchester Museum welcomes all kinds of visitors: art and design students, members of local natural history organisations, school and college students, family groups, etc. Yet, about half of our visitors are researchers working on many interesting, often inter-disciplinary projects. For instance, Dr James Jepson (on photo) is a palaeontologist from the University of Manchester, looking at the evolution of insects, in addition to studying the evolution of lacewings and their allies (order Neuroptera). He is also involved in studying these insects in Cheshire and Lancashire and is responsible for the national recording scheme of these insects. Below is James’ brief report on what he does and how he uses the Manchester Museum’s insect collections.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nI have the pleasure of regularly visiting the entomology collections at the Manchester Museum to gather data for three projects that I am currently undertaking. The first being part of my postdoctoral research on insect relationships and evolution. I am using the specimens in the collection to code morphological characters, which I will then use to create a phylogeny to show the relationships of extant and fossil insect orders. From this phylogeny, I will be able to investigate the evolution of insects throughout geological time, from their beginnings to the present day.\n\nThe second project relates to the British Isles Lacewing and Allies Recording Scheme. I have recently become the co-organizer of the scheme, which we relaunched earlier this year. The scheme takes in records of the orders Neuroptera (Lacewings, Waxflies, Antlions & Spongeflies), Raphidioptera (Snakeflies), Megaloptera (Alderflies) and Mecoptera (Scorpionflies & Snowfleas) found in England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. If you want to know more about the scheme, and how you can contribute, please visit our website. At the museum, I am documenting the collection of British lacewings and allies in the collection for addition into the recording schemes database. Museum collections hold very important data not only on recently collected specimens but also on specimens collected in the past. These historical collections give us information on past distributions of species and can help us assess any changes that have happened over time.\n\nThe final project is looking at the museum’s collection of Neuropterida (Neuroptera, Raphidioptera, Megaloptera). In addition to the British specimens, I will also be looking at specimens from other countries, like India, Costa Rica, and others. I will be putting a name to the unidentified specimens and checking the identity of the others to take into account recent changes in neuropterid taxonomy. It is always an enjoyable experience visiting the collections at Manchester Museum; the staff are enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and always very helpful.\n\nRead Full Post »"
