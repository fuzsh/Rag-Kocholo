        "text": "Factory International has announced the 2023 edition of Manchester International Festival, which takes place from 29 June to 16 July. Working with partners regionally and across the globe, the wide-ranging programme of original new work by artists from around the world will take place in venues and spaces throughout the city, with many taking place across the Oxford Road Corridor and at Factory Internationalâs much-anticipated new home, which opens its doors for the first time for the Festival, in advance of its official opening in October.\n\nFrom a collaboration exploring art and the beautiful game by curator Hans Ulrich Obrist and footballer Juan Mata, featuring new work by Tino Sehgal, to a mixed reality concert by Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, from a live photographic performance by Benji Reid to a musical adaptation of a cult queer classic by Philip Venables and Ted Huffman, the expansive programme of new work premiering at the Festival will see art forms merge, breaking new creative ground and challenging perceptions.\n\nArtistic Director and Chief Executive, Factory International & Manchester International Festival John McGrath says: âFrom the radical and agenda setting to the purest of celebrations, MIF23âs programme covers a huge range of art forms and styles â from a ritual on the banks of a newly uncovered river, to mixed reality from one of Japanâs greatest composers, from a hunt for artworks across the city to a residency from one of American musicâs most vibrant superstars. A genuine melting pot of creativity where artists share their ideas with each other and the public, the Festival will once again take the temperature of our times, and imagine possibilities for the future."
