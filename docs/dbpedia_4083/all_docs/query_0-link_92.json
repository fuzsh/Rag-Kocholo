        "text": "The Congregational Church - Wilmslow Road\n\nThe Congregational Church, on Wilmslow Road, near the junction with Dickenson Road, was a creation of Alfred Waterhouse, the architect of Manchester Town Hall, Owens College and the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nIt was built between 1863 and 1864 and Pevsner describes it as being, \"Heavily Gothic, of darkened brick with a high NW tower. The tower has four steep gables and a short spire\". It was built at a cost of Â£4,600 and offered 600 free seats.\n\nThe map segment above is shown with the Permission of Eric Rowlands of the Artus Family Website.\n\nThe church is indicated in the map above and the aerial photograph below, dated 1953.\n\nIf you click on the link below you can see the church in 1959, by which time it was already closed as a church.\n\nCongregational Church 1959"
