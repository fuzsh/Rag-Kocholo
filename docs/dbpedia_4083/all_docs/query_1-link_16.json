        "text": "\"Between two clear or accepted stages or states, and therefore difficult to describe or know exactly\"\n\n​\n\nPlatt Hall has stood on the corner of Platt Lane and Wilmslow Road for 250 years. It has been many things - a home, a work camp, an art school. From 1947 to 2017 it was the Gallery of Costume, home to Manchester's world-class collection of fashion and dress.\n\nNow it is changing again. Platt Hall Inbetween explores the past and the future to imagine new possibilities for this landmark building. We are working with local residents and communities to transform Platt Hall into a vital and creative space at the heart of its local neighbourhood.\n\nThis site is a space to document, share, and continue the process of collectively re-imagining this unique piece of Manchester's history, ensuring its usefulness for years to come.\n\n​\n\nThe award, from Paul Hamlyn Foundation's Arts Access and Participation Fund, will enable the next phase in Platt's development with funding spread over four years. It will support the growth of Platt Hall’s team through the implementation of three new roles and two new residencies that will combine strategic, practical, research-centred and creative approaches to create a sustainable and long-term working model.\n\nWe’re creating a sustainable future for this landmark historic building by partnering with schools, doctors’ surgeries, community centres and welfare charities, as well as local businesses, voluntary groups and residents across the neighbourhoods of Rusholme, Moss Side, Fallowfield and Longsight. Collectively, we are working to break down barriers of cultural participation and ensure Platt Hall best meets the needs of its local communities today and in the future."
