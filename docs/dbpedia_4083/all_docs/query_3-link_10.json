        "text": "The Museum has a new sign with our new name — Manchester-by-the-Sea Museum, which is only the third name to grace the front of the Museum in the past 99 years*. The sign is based on a logo designed by Becca Campbell, Museum Vice President. Like all good creative ideas, it started with a sketch on a napkin. Becca then worked with Jerry DeFazio of Daily Printing to finalize the logo, which has a crisp and clean design, ideal for visibility. We would like to give a shout out to both Becca and Jerry! Our thanks go out to Alison Anholt-White, Museum Trustee — who spearheaded the sign production; from sign creation to mockup testing to installation, and the many steps in between. We also would like to acknowledge Gary Jernegan of Cape Ann Sign, who manufactured and installed the sign. The logo expresses the Museum's brand goals: Welcoming — We invite all to enjoy our town's history and celebrate our community. Coastal DNA — The ocean is woven throughout our town's history and in the stories showcased in the Museum (Merchant Sea Captains, Salt Cod Fish Yards, Summer Seaside Resort era, hydro-powered Cabinetmaking Mills, and even Sea Serpents). * In 1925, the Abigail Hooper Trask House — at 10 Union Street — became the home of the Manchester Historical Society, which was founded in 1886. In 2012, the organization changed its name to Manchester Historical Museum, and at the September 2023 Annual Meeting, Museum members voted to change the name to Manchester-by-the-Sea Museum."
