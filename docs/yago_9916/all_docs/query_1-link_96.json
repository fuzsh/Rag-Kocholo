        "text": "7:00pm, Thursday 2 November 2023\n\nJoin us for this excellent Afro-futurist, genre-bending, sci-fi horror film...\n\n“How can you make a horror film in a place where death is a party?” – Cameroonian director Jean-Pierre Békolo\n\nLes Saignantes is an Afro-futurist, genre-bending, sci-fi horror film that blends social satire with a longing for change. It’s no wonder its director Jean-Pierre Békolo, has been described as unique in African filmmaking. Set in 2025, in an unnamed African state where corruption, nepotism, and sexual exploitation have only gotten worse, two young women decide to seize the potency of their own sexuality to combat those in power via the ancient ritual of Mevoungou.\n\nRightly lauded for its delicious photography, soundtrack and editing, LES SAIGNANTES is the magical and majestical treat that will get you back into that Halloween mode. Unmissable.\n\nLES SAIGNANTES (THE BLOODIEST) (viewer discretion advised – suitable for 18+ years old only)"
