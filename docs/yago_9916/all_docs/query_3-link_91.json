        "text": "Film came to Africa almost immediately after its invention. But Africans didn't get the opportunity to access it until the eve of the imperialist rules within the regions of the continent. This essay aims at identifying the margins and definitions of African Cinema, from prehistoric, historic and post modern points of view. In a way, it also tried to define which film is African or not. It uses a Qualitative approach to analytically draw it findings and concludes that African Cinema is a conglomerate of many national cinemas within the continent and not a single branded cinema as often portrayed in some international cinema discourses.\n\nLiterary and cultural racism alongside the question of authenticity have been at the heart of much critical thinking about African Cinema. Prior and clearly during the colonial era, motion picture works about Africa effectively served to reinforce visions of the western world to the African aborigines. These imperialistic viewpoints pictured Africa as a wild and savage place existing outside the boarders of history. As filmmakers began to emerge in the 1960s and 1970s from nations of the continent, with a rising consciousness about the ideological damages facing Africa, the need to quickly merge ranks became apparent, as a wide spread opinion agreeing to the reality that imperialist representations of Africa were stereotypical and inauthentic crowned it all. This paper is focused on examining this ideological counter from the early African filmmakers, not only to know how they amount to decolonization of the African motion picture industry but also to bring to bear their efforts in the struggle. The question whether the African Cinemas have been indeed decolonized decades after the colonials left is also in the spirit of this paper. The research adopts a qualitative methodology of textual evaluation to arrive at its conclusion. Amongst its findings is the fact that African Cinema was stereotyped by colonial forces to strengthen their dominance on the African landscape. The study contributes to knowledge by exposing the defaming western ideologies on the African cinema, while encouraging a Pan-African and counteractive cinematic themes and techniques for the deconstruction of western stereotypes and parody.\n\nThe Italian realism style had a significant impact on the development of Third World film, which includes African cinema. It also had an impact on storytelling and cinematography techniques. There are many similarities between African cinema and Italian neo-realism in terms of background history, themes, and driving forces. However, there are few accounts of how an exenslaved and colonized continent shared a similar search for emancipation with its former colonial rulers, especially in the field of filmmaking. This article on world cinema will introduce us to two of the most significant historical films, which were produced throughout two distinct film movements and eras yet have parallel similarities in their themes and points of view.\n\n‘Who is this man called cinema?’ Jean-Pierre Bekolo asks Djibril Diop Mambety, the great Senegalese filmmaker. ‘Why should it be a man?’ Mambety replies, and continues: ‘For me, it is a storytelling grandma, as all grandmas do. It could be also another sort of grandma (grammar) the kind that wants you to say things in one way, and not another. But Grandma herself allows us to betray grandma. She will let you contradict grandma. This means that the ABCs you get taught at film school can be absolutely transformed. Grandma wants us each time to reinvent her grammar. Grandma wants us to tell her story in a different way each time. […] Sometimes she is lazy and tells it in the same way. Then I get angry and say “grandma, come on!” She replies: “go and talk to Grandma”. Grandma asks me to always reinvent her discourse, to recreate it for her own durability.’ This short interview between Mambety and Bekolo turned into the film Grandma’s Grammar (La Grammaire de Grand-Mère) in 1996 and was initially intended as a part of Aristotle’s Plot (1996). Although Grandma’s Grammar was not inserted, it remains nevertheless of great significance for understanding Aristotle’s Plot and new African storytelling in cinema. ..................."
