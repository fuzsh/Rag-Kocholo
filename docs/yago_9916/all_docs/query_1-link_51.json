        "text": "About Me\n\nTalatu-Carmen\n\nMy blogger-personality Talatu-Carmen reflects my rapidly developing multiple personalities, and embodies my chronic inability to focus on just one thing. My blog Abubuwan da nake tunani chronicled the things that flitted across my mind often when I was procrastinating my school work and is now a vestige of graduate school. Most of my posts have to do with Africa, Nigeria, or Hausa culture. In the blog Abubuwan da nake Rubutawa, I place larger chunks of text (short stories, translation projects, film and book reviews) that I'd like to get feedback on.
