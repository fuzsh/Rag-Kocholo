        "text": "Bruno and I began discussing the possibility of Jean-Pierre Bekolo’s visit to MIT a year ago. We did not know then that he was being considered at Harvard Film Archive for the prestigious McMillan-Stewart Fellowship for Distinguished filmmaking. I am not sure Jean-Pierre knew it at the time either. The announcement came out from him on January 1 this year, followed thereafter by other announcements of his imminent presence in New York and a tour of the US, on which he is currently embarked. It is by pure happenstance that today’s appearance here coincides with Bekolo’s Harvard visit. At least nine of his films were screened there between March 4 and April 21, and he appeared in person several times to lead the discussion.\n\nI am honored to introduce Jean-Pierre Bekolo here this afternoon. He hails from Cameroon, where he studied Physics at the University of Yaoundé. Subsequently, he jumped to filmmaking, and studied under Christian Metz in France, whose work on film semiotics probably influenced Bekolo. My first encounter with Bekolo was through his 1992 film Quartier Mozart, which I screened as part of a summer African film outreach program that I ran for several years at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Quartier Mozart, which is now also the name of a cultural center that Jean-Pierre built in Yaoundé is so delightfully and utterly Cameroonian in its imagery but especially in its use of the French language. Having spent 2 years teaching on a Fulbright at the University of Yaounde a decade earlier, I relished the memories—pleasant and unpleasant--that the film stirred in me, mostly everyday life scenes, street talk in popular quarters of the urban setting of Yaounde in a manner reminiscent of Spike Lee. This contrasted sharply with “Cinema calebasse” films, which offer stereotypes of rural Africa. The film also taught me something else by clearly exemplifying the cinematic technique of the jump cut, which I tried in vain to understand from watching French New Wave cinema.\n\nMy face-to-face encounter with Jean-Pierre Bekolo happened at the 2007 Pan African Film and Television Festival, FESPACO, held in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) every other year since 1969. FESPACO bestowed upon Bekolo’s film Les Saignantes its second highest award—L’étalon d’argent—as well as best actress awards on both of its main characters. I happened to have been in attendance that year, and I remember being pleasantly shocked, because having seen the film before the jury’s decision, I did not think that FESPACO would fall for a science-fiction film at that point in time. The film is utterly innovative in its narrative style, if one can call it narrative. Bekolo does not believe in rectilinear narrative. Because of this, a critic has called his narrative style neurotic, two others have called it exceptionalism.\n\nCiting even half the awards that Jean-Pierre Bekolo has garnered would more time than we have, for there are many. Suffice it to say that he is at once a celebrated filmmaker and a theoretical thinker about cinema and about the world, particularly the place and struggles of Africa in the postcolonial world. His talk today is entitled “The Transformative Power of Afrofuturist Cinema” and is based on his newly published book entitled Cinema as a Transformative Tool for the Therapeutic Intellectual (subtitled “Putting Postcolonial Theories in Motion.”). It is made of 10 very brief chapters of about 10 pages each or less in length, followed by a Manifesto in bullet points entitled “Healing Cinema” and addressed specifically to filmmakers. The chapters are specific interventions that challenge accepted assumptions by African intellectuals. The whole book has the feel of a manifesto. Indeed, it is part of a series published in Germany called MissRead. It is the last in this series but also the inaugural publication of a new series explicitly called “Manifesto Series.” I think the main takeaway of the book is that the filmmaker and the artist in general, whom Bekolo calls “Creative intellectuals” of the post-colonial era is imbued with the power to diagnose the neuroses that ail post-colonial African societies, as well as the means by which to heal those neuroses and traumas. This, I think, is the goal he pursues constantly in his written work and his practice of cinema, although he insists that this must be a constant quest and a constant self-questioning, and not the application of cookie-cutter formulas inherited from the West."
