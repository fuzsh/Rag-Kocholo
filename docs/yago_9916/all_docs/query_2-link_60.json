        "text": "“Mudimbe’s Things and Words” (Les Mots et les Choses de Mudimbe) is a portrait of Congolese intellectual Valentin-Yves Mudimbe, one of the most important living African philosophers and writers.\n\nMudimbe was born in 1941 in Likasi, then Belgian Congo, currently Democratic Republic of the Congo. First, he started studies in economy in Kinshasa, then earning a Ph.D. in Romance Philology in Paris.\n\nValentin-Yves Mudimbe is a linguistic genius: he mastered about ten languages and can read in another eight. He gives lectures at many of the world's prestigious universities in France, Belgium, Mexico, Canada, Great Britain, Israel and Germany. In 1979, he emigrated to the United Stages, where he still teaches at Duke University as profesor emeritus. In his award-winning creative input, he references Africa's past and present as a continent suspended between tradition and European influences, as well as the processes of decay and destruction caused by the colonialism, missionary services and development aid. His monographs: “The Invention of Africa” (1988) and “The Idea of Africa” (1994), in which the author undertakes to liberate Africa from its place in the position of the “absolute Other”, firmly held by the continent in the Western thought, are deemed classic publications, with importance on par with Edward Said's “Orientalism”"
