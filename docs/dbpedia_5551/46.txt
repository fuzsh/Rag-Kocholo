Sire Records; November 2007

Warning: This four-song EP is really for big-time Tegan and Sara fansit doesn’t give a lot of new material to chew on and only provides building blocks for further adoration by those who already love the adorable Canadian twins. For instance, there are two new versions of “Back in Your Head,” which, despite being their first single off The Con, was not this listener’s favorite off that CD. However, rest assured the dance mix will make it onto any mix tape I create in the near future. “One Second” is one of Tegan and Sara’s more abstract numbers, while the title track has an eccentric, memorable keyboard line that holds much promise had it been expanded for the full-length.
