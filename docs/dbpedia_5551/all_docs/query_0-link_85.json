Later that year, they released another album, \"This Business of Art.\"\n\nThe band released another studio album, \"If It Was You,\" in 2002, followed two years later by their fourth, \"So Jealous.\" In 2007, their album \"The Con\" found the band experimenting with a more complex, mature, and varied sound, while their latest full-length, 2009's \"Sainthood,\" finds the duo returning to their simple, melodic roots while continuing to try on new styles.\n\nTegan and Sara stopped by Minnesota Public Radio's UBS Forum for a live performance in front of a studio audience.\n\nSongs Performed\n\n\"On Directing\"\n\n\"Alligator\"\n\n\"Nineteen\"\n\n\"Living Room\"\n\nThe first two songs are from Tegan and Sara's 2009 album, Sainthood; the third song is from 2007's The Con; both are available on Sire Records.
