        "text": "Music industry legend Seymour Stein on Wednesday announced his departure from Warner Music after 42 years at the label group, saying he’s eyeing a return to his “indie roots.” By leaving WMG, Stein also is saying goodbye to Sire Records, the label he co-founded in 1967 as an independent before joining forces with Warner Bros. nine years later.\n\nLed by Stein, Sire’s roster over the last half-century has been nothing short of legendary and has included Madonna, The Ramones, The Smiths, The Pretenders, The Cure, Ice-T, Depeche Mode, The Replacements, Uncle Tupelo, The Cult, Cyndi Lauper and k.d.lang, among others.\n\n“I was very fortunate during my youth to learn from so many great indie label people, like Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun and Jerry Wexler at Atlantic, and my greatest mentor, Syd Nathan at King Records,” Stein said in his announcement. “I went on to work with so many other great indies around the world as Sire grew to become the legendary brand it is today. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank all the amazing artists — far too many to name — who have called Sire home over the years.”\n\nStein, a one-time assistant at Billboard, co-founded Sire with Richard Gottehrer. In July 2017, WMG named Rani Hancock as the label’s president, with Stein staying on as chairman.\n\nIn his comments, Stein admitted that while he’s enjoyed his time at Warners, “in truth I long for my indie roots and the greater independence that I experienced back in the ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s. So the time has come to move on to the next phase of my career, leaving Sire in the hands of Rani Hancock, whom I sincerely wish all the luck in the world.”\n\nThe 76-year-old record exec hinted that he intends to stay in the music business and will be “back in action again soon. I’m looking forward to the future and continuing to develop new artists in the music business that I love so much.”\n\nStein’s departure from Warner Music coincided with him receiving the Recording Academy’s prestigious Trustees Award on Saturday at the organization’s Special Merit Awards ceremony and tribute concert, which was held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles."
