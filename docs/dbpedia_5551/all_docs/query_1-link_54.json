        "text": "The Stern Grove Festival kicked off its 87th season of free concerts at San Francisco's Sigmund Stern Grove Sunday but you didn't have to have a ticket to enjoy the music live.\n\nBack in May, Stern Grove Festival organizers announced the full schedule of summer concerts for 2024, including funk icon Chaka Khan, jazz keyboard legend Herbie Hancock, Latin soul band Chicano Batman and season opener, Canadian alt-pop duo Tegan & Sara.\n\nThe noted indie-pop duo, made up of identical twin sisters Tegan Rain Quin and Sara Keirsten Quin, started writing songs when they found an old acoustic guitar in the basement of their home in Calgary, Alberta. The pair has become one of the most commercially and critically successful Canadian acts of the past quarter century since the 1999 release of their debut album Under Feet Like Ours. The sisters rose to become festival favorites -- performing at Lilith Fair, Coachella, Lollapalooza, SXSW, Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo and Outside Lands.\n\nThey have also branched out into books, film and even television with the adaptation of their 2019 memoir High School into the Amazon Freevee show of the same name in addition to recording ten studio albums. As vocal advocates and activists for LGBTQ equality (both twins are gay and married), Tegan and Sara have received numerous awards for work done by their foundation. The duo's headlining performance at Stern Grove was preceded by a DJ set from Ladyryan and Oakland-born vocalist/songwriter King Isis.\n\nLast year marked the first time CBS News Bay Area partnered with Stern Grove to broadcast and stream online most of the season's concerts. Information on how to watch is below.\n\n• What: Stern Grove Festival with Tegan and Sara\n\n• Date: Sunday, June 23, 2024\n\n• Time: 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\n• Location: Stern Grove in San Francisco\n\n• On TV: KPIX+ 44 Cable 12"
