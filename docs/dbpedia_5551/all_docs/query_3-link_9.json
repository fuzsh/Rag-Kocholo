        "text": "Seymour Stein was never a household name to most music fans before his Sunday death from cancer in Los Angeles at the age of 80. But he certainly was to the Ramones, Talking Heads, Madonna, Ice-T, Depeche Mode and the dozens of other artists Stein signed to Sire Records, which he co-founded in New York in 1967.\n\nMoreover, Stein was the behind-the-scenes missing link between such disparate acts as the English blues-rock band Fleetwood Mac in the 1960s, the Dutch prog-rock band Focus in the early 1970s, and the The Pretenders and Richard Hell & the Voidoids later in the same decade.\n\n“I never believed in press for myself,” Stein said in a 2005 Union-Tribune interview previewing his induction that year into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n“It was one thing to have artists like the Ramones, Talking Heads and Madonna, who couldn’t stop getting press. But I had other artists who never got press. And because of that, I never wanted any. I didn’t want an artist to say: ‘Hey! Why are you getting media attention and we’re not?’ And they would be right, because their careers are very fragile.\n\nThe 1980s saw Stein sign dozens of young acts. The list included Madonna, Depeche Mode and the San Diego-bred band The Unknowns, while the 1990s saw San Diego’s Candye Kane record her standout album, “Swango,” for Sire.\n\nOn Monday, April 3 Madonna saluted Stein in a post on her Instagram page. Being signed to Sire by Stein, she wrote, “changed the course of my Life Forever. And was the beginning of my journey as a Musical Artist. Not only did Seymour hear me but he Saw me and my Potential! For this I will be eternally grateful!\n\n“I am weeping as I write this down. Words cannot describe how I felt at this moment after years of grinding and being broke and getting every door slammed in my face.\n\n“Anyone who knew Seymour knew about his passion for music and his impeccable taste. He had an Ear like no other! He was Intense -Wickedly Funny-a little bit Crazy And Deeply intuitive.\n\nDearest Seymour you will never be forgotten!! Thank You! Thank you Thank you! Shine on!!!”\n\nOther artists who thrived at Stein’s label included The Replacements, k.d. lang, The Cure, Seal, Aphex Twin, The Smiths, Ride, Madness and Echo & The Bunnymen. Stein was also instrumental in boosting Rock & Roll Hall of Famers Brian Wilson and Lou Reed, whose careers underwent dramatic revivals after being signed to Sire.\n\nBorn Seymour Steinbigle on April 18, 1942, the Brooklyn native began working in the music industry while he was still in his teens. He thrived behind the scenes, whether signing rising young artists to Sire, obtaining U.S. licensing deals for Sire with hip indie record labels in other countries, or co-founding the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation in 1983.\n\nStein was himself inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 as a non-performing Lifetime Achievement honoree. It was the same year that The Pretenders — one of Sire Records’ most notable successes — were also inducted.\n\nIntroducing Stein, gangsta-rap pioneer Ice-T said: “Seymour was looking for somebody who had something to say. When you take Mighty Lemon Drops, the Ramones, Madonna, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, Ministry, Ice-T, you put them together, it doesn’t seem like they go together. But they do. They all had an edge. That’s what Seymour was into.”\n\nChrissie Hynde, the mastermind of the Pretenders, was in awe of Stein’s musical range.\n\n“He knows all the lyrics to every song you’ve ever heard!” she once said.\n\nGetting signed to Sire Records was such a badge of honor that, in 1998, the Scottish rock band Belle and Sebastian wrote and recorded a song, “Seymour Stein,” about not securing a deal with the label.\n\nStein’s memoir, “Siren Song,” was published in 2018, the same year he retired. He never became a household name, but the music he helped nurture and promote will continue to resonate for years to come in households worldwide.\n\nHere is our full 2005 interview with Stein.\n\nSuddenly Seymour: Spotlight’s on Stein\n\nBy GEORGE VARGA, MUSIC CRITIC\n\nMarch 13, 2005, The San Diego Union-Tribune\n\nTo casual music fans, Seymour Stein might seem out of place when he is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame tomorrow night in New York alongside U2, the Pretenders, Buddy Guy, the O’Jays and Percy Sledge.\n\nBut Stein, whose name is synonymous with Sire Records, which he co-founded in 1966, has had a profound a musical impact. The Ramones, Madonna, Talking Heads, the Smiths and Depeche Mode can all thank him for signing them as budding young artists and helping to make them stars.\n\nSo can such diverse Sire alums as Wilco, k.d. lang, Seal, Barenaked Ladies, the Replacements, the Cult, Ministry, Aphex Twin and the English Beat. Factor in such recent Sire additions as Futureheads, The Distillers and Von Bondies, and Stein’s continuing influence as a peerless alternative-music talent scout and indie record label pioneer becomes even more pronounced.\n\n“Seymour can see a band in a little club, with bad lighting, and he knows when the music is good and when it’s not,” said former Talking Heads bassist Tina Weymouth, a Coronado native, who has known Stein since 1975. “And he’s the kind of guy that, when he believes in an artist, he sticks his neck out — and leaves it there.”\n\nIn a separate interview from their Connecticut home, Weymouth’s husband, ex-Talking Heads drummer Chris Frantz, praised Stein’s tenacity.\n\n“They say James Brown is the hardest working man in show business, but I think it’s Seymour,” said Frantz, who with Weymouth co-leads the dance-rock band the Tom Tom Club.\n\n“He would get up at 4 a.m. to do phone calls to England, then be in the office at 9:30 a.m. and work all day. Then, he’d take bands out for dinner to woo them, then check out more bands in the clubs after that. It seemed that anywhere you went in the world, Seymour was there. He’s made a lot of money, but I feel like he’s earned it.”\n\nA native of Brooklyn, Stein will be inducted at tomorrow’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony by one of his mentors, Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, and by gangsta-rap pioneer turned “Law & Order” star Ice-T, who Stein signed to Sire in 1986.\n\n“Seymour has never followed trends. He’s always looked for what’s on the cutting edge,” Ice-T said from Los Angeles. “I had other labels at the time who were interested in me. But I always go with the one who’s most passionate, and Seymour was the one.”\n\nIce-T and Stein, who has been the president of the board of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since its inception in the mid-1980s, will be in select company at tomorrow’s ceremony at the plush Waldorf Astoria hotel. (Fellow board members Ertegun and Jann Wenner, the founder and publisher of Rolling Stone magazine, were inducted in 1987 and last year, respectively.)\n\nU2 is scheduled to be inducted by Bruce Springsteen, while Neil Young will do the honors for the Pretenders (whose first eight albums were released on Sire). Blues dynamo Guy will be inducted by fellow guitar legends B.B. King and Eric Clapton, with Rod Stewart on hand to salute Sledge.\n\nAn edited, two-hour version of the ceremony will air March 19 at 9 p.m. on VH1. The cable channel’s quest for younger viewers may explain why Justin Timberlake will induct the classic R&B vocal group the O’Jays.\n\nFor the New York-based Stein, tomorrow’s induction marks a rare turn in the spotlight. He has always been happiest working behind the scenes.\n\n“I never believed in press for myself,” Stein said recently from London, where he was scouting new acts for Sire before moving on to Italy.\n\n“It was one thing to have artists like the Ramones, Talking Heads and Madonna, who couldn’t stop getting press. But I had other artists who never got press. And because of that, I never wanted any. I didn’t want an artist to say: `Hey! Why are you getting media attention and we’re not?’ And they would be right, because their careers are very fragile.\n\n“I collect antiques and get written up because of my collection from time to time. But that’s different, because it has nothing to do with music.”\n\nAnd music is everything to Stein, who has spent most of his life pursuing his passion.\n\nAt the age of 13, he began hanging out at the Manhattan offices of Billboard, the record industry’s most prestigious weekly publication, where he drew attention by fastidiously reading through 15 years of back issues.\n\nBillboard honcho Paul Ackerman was so impressed that Stein was soon hired to write concert reviews for Billboard. By 16, the magazine had hired him to work with record-charts editor Paul Noonan, with whom he developed the formula for compiling Billboard’s original Hot 100 singles charts.\n\nUpon graduating from high school, Stein was hired by Cincinnati-based King Records, the home of such R&B and country-music greats as James Brown and the Stanley Brothers.\n\nAfter 2 1/2 years, he returned to New York in 1963 to work for Red Bird Records, a label co-owned by songwriters Mike Lieber and Jerry Stoller (of “Hound Dog” and “Stand By Me” fame).\n\nStein and ex-Strangeloves member Richard Gottehrer formed Sire Productions in 1966; one of their first finds was Chain Reaction, a young band led by future Aerosmith singer Steve Tyler. Sire Records was born a short while later.\n\nWhile visiting London in 1967, Stein and Gottehrer became partners in Blue Horizon, the English record label whose roster was then headed by Fleetwood Mac.\n\nStein struck gold in 1971 when he signed the Dutch prog-rock band Focus, which in 1973 scored an international hit with “Hocus Pocus.” He fared nearly as well with two English groups he signed during the same time period, Renaissance and Climax Blues Band.\n\nBy 1975, a musical revolution was incubating at CBGB’s, the now-legendary New York Club that spawned the Ramones, Talking Heads, Patti Smith, Blondie and many more. Stein was ready.\n\n“I didn’t look at it as a transition,” he said. “I wasn’t a latecomer. As a record company, I was the first (to go to CBGB’s and sign bands). So Sire exploded, and we had a great run.”\n\nStein now speaks of the Ramones with a mixture of pride and sadness (three of the group’s four original members are deceased.) He signed the proto-punk band almost immediately.\n\n“I didn’t need more than 15 minutes, because their set was 18 minutes, and I fell in love with them right there,” he said.\n\n“It happened on numerous occasions that I made snap decisions like that. A lot of times I was wrong; a lot of times I was right.”\n\nStein sold Sire to Warner Bros. in 1980, but continued to run the company. In 1995, he became the president of Elektra Records and brought Sire with him. He re-teamed with Warner Bros. two years ago and still loves his job.\n\n“I think that, so long as there is great music and people go out and look for it, there will be a music business. It’s what I enjoy doing. I’ve never opted for a position that would remove me from the music,” he said.\n\nAs for the possibility of retirement, Stein said: “What keeps me going is that part of me never grew up. I have the body of a 62-year-old-man, but I don’t think I come across that way. The music really does keep me young.”\n\ngeorge.varga@sduniontribune.com"
