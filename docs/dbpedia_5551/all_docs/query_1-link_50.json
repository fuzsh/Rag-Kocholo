        "text": "Sapphic true crime fans, your hour has truly come. A new documentary about legendary indie performers Tegan and Sara is set to air on Hulu this fall, shedding new light on a nefarious catfish scheme that has targeted fans of the musical duo for the better part of two decades.\n\nFanatical: The Catfishing of Tegan and Sara will hit the platform on October 18, according to Variety, directed by documentarian Erin Lee Carr, whose recent doc Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini swiftly became Hulu’s biggest-ever docuseries in June. The documentary centers on events that occurred after Tegan Quin was hacked in 2011: the musician’s personal identity was stolen and used to catfish numerous fans, many of whom believed they were truly speaking to the real Tegan — until the culprit began scamming the entire grassroots community of Tegan and Sara fans.\n\nAlthough the hacking itself took place in 2011, Tegan explained in an Instagram post on Tuesday that the saga had been slowly unfolding over the past 16 years. She had written a story called “Fake Tegan” several years ago, she wrote, which eventually turned into the documentary project.\n\n“[W]e decided to tell this story and make this film in hopes that we could stop Fake Tegan, give some peace to the victims, and hopefully warn people who might fall for this kind of thing in the future,” she added.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nTegan and Sara have long been icons of the lesbian and broader LGBTQ+ communities, and have used that musical fame in the service of queer activism for years. They’ve attracted a fiercely loyal fanbase in that time, full of LGBTQ+ folks whose lives were touched by the twin sisters’ songs (ours included). But notoriety also hangs a target on one’s back — in this case, from an unknown scam artist profiting from that queer subcommunity. Some fans in the comments of Tegan’s Instagram post claimed they, too, had been victimized by the scammer in the past.\n\n“Along the way [while making the documentary] we met some incredible people, inspiring fans who became victims of this person, uncovered so much we didn’t know, and struggled to come to terms with how much this hurt so many fans of our band,” Tegan wrote in her post confirming the doc’s home on Hulu this week. “But we also realized how traumatizing and awful it was for us, the friends and people we worked with who became ensnared in it, and how it reshaped our relationship to our fans, our band and fame itself. We all got catfished and now we’re finally speaking out.”\n\nGet the best of what’s queer. Sign up for Them’s weekly newsletter here."
