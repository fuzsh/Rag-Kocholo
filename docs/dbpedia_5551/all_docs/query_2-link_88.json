        "text": "A new Tegan and Sara covers album will feature Hayley Williams, CHVRCHES, Ryan Adams and more.\n\nTitled ‘The Con X: Covers’, it will see artists cover Tegan and Sara’s fifth studio album ‘The Con’, released in 2007.\n\n“As the 10th anniversary of The Con approached, Sara and I started to brainstorm meaningful ways to celebrate what was easily one of our most important records,” Tegan said of the album.\n\n“Almost immediately we established that a tour playing all 14 songs in a more intimate and stripped-down arrangement would be memorable for our diehard fans. But we also wanted a companion piece that would live on past the anniversary, hence The Con X: Covers album was born,” she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We wanted the proceeds to go to our recently launched Tegan and Sara Foundation, which raises money for self-identified women and girls in the LGBTQ community.\n\n“With that intention set, we asked 14 artists who were either outspoken allies of the LGTBQ community or LGBTQ themselves to each cover a song from The Con, in any fashion they saw fit. All the artists agreed to donate their time and energy to the project and their labels all agreed to waive their fees as well. We are beyond grateful for the contributions of each artist, and we hope fans of The Con will be moved by their interpretations.”\n\nRecommended\n\nSee the full list of artists contributing to the album as well as the artwork below:\n\nThe Con X: Covers – Track Listing\n\n1.
