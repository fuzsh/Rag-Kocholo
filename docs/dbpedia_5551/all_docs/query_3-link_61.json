        "text": "Far Hills resident Marty Scott has been involved in the recording industry since he was in college at Franklin & Marshall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. With his childhood friends from Metuchen, Jeff Tenembaum and Ed Grassi, he created JEM Records, initially an importer and then a label partnership with Sire in Passport Records.\n\nJEM and Passport saw many huge successes, including the progressive rock band Nektar, the soundtrack to “Rocky Horror Picture Show,” and the import of the 1978 smash “Cheap Trick at Budokan,” the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame act’s biggest-selling record. But in 1988, the labels were lost in a hostile takeover, Scott said in the following interview.\n\nHowever, if you’re a believer in life’s second act, then this chat is for you.\n\nScott resurrected JEM in 2013 and now focuses on Beatlesque power-pop acts, such as Highland Park’s The Anderson Council, The Grip Weeds, and Brenyama; Asbury Park’s The Weeklings; South Jersey’s Somerdale; Hoboken’s Richard Barone, and recent out-of-state signings The Bayonets and The Red Button. All have international online followings, thanks in large part to Scott’s promotion, yet all of the Jersey acts often play locally.\n\nMembers of the Weeklings will perform Aug. 30 with E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, and The Anderson Council will be one of nine local acts at Hub City Sounds: ROCK New Brunswick on Sept. 10 in Boyd Park.\n\nIn the following interview, Scott also discussed growing up in Metuchen, meeting his wife, Toni, a former album art designer, and their bucolic home in Far Hills with their Goldendoodle, Spencer.

Soon I convinced my two childhood friends, Jeff Tenembaum, Cornell, and Ed Grossi, Wesleyn, to do so too. It went so well, we decided to start a business selling to college kids across America. Hence, JEM Records.\n\nBefore we set up in a trailer in the parking lot of a distributor, we went to Europe. While in London, I searched for a Who record you couldn’t get in the USA, “Direct Hits.” I found it and thought, “If I wanted this record, there must be other fans who want it.’ Soon stores and radio stations found out about us and wanted imports from us. It took off very quickly. We were breaking albums on FM radio from a trailer.\n\nQ: What was the first record you put out and when?\n\nA: I met Sire Records' Seymour Stein at a David Bowie concert. He couldn't believe what we were doing breaking Focus’ ‘Hocus Pokus’ as an import. He had acquired the U.S. rights to the band and now had a hit FM record before it was even released. He asked me to come to his office the next day and meet with him and his partner, Richard Gottehrer. The result was Passport Records, a partnership between JEM and Sire. The initial concept was to release albums I found overseas as imports and release them here. The first album released on Passport was Tucky Buzzard’s ‘Alright on the Night’ in October 1973. It was produced by Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones. They toured major arenas with Deep Purple and Uriah Heep. I was 23.\n\nI thought this is how it happens. I learned fast it doesn't.\n\nMy first U.S. signing was Larry Fast's SYNERGY, which would catapulted him to fame as the leading synthesizer players in the world, playing on just about everyone's albums in the ’70s and ’80s. You may have seen him on tour with Peter Gabriel. Larry is still my best friend, over 40 years later. Larry and his wife, Phyllis, just competed a documentary on The Great Swamp which will soon be shown on PBS stations across the country.\n\nOur first Top 20 album was Nektar's ‘Remember the Future.’ They were the first German band to hit it in America, though they were actually from England. Mo Moore, the band's bassist is now the owner of a large HVAC company out of Chester Township and was just elected to a township board.\n\nOur biggest selling album at JEM was ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show,’ and the biggest album we ever ‘broke’ as an exclusive import was ‘Cheap Trick at Budokan.’\n\nQ: How many records have you released?\n\nA: More than 1,000.\n\nQ: Out of all the records you’ve released is there one that makes you most proud? If so, what and why?\n\nA: Not so much one record, but finding and releasing artists that went on to fame, either with us or with others always gave me a feeling of accomplishment.\n\nQ: What is your next record and with whom?\n\nA: We released on Aug. 11, Somerdale, a band from South Jersey. It has gotten incredible advance reviews and was debuted by Rodney Bingenheimer on Sirius XM this past Sunday night. It's already on 60 stations, including Internet shows in England and Japan. It's an extremely well-produced album.\n\nJEM artists from New Jersey, The Anderson Council, The Grip Weeds, and The Weeklings, are all in the studio working on their next albums. The Weeklings will be releasing a series of singles starting on Sept. 1. They also plan to release a Christmas album in December to go with their holiday shows. Brenyama, whose debut we released this past spring, will be playing the area over the next few months, working on new material.\n\nQ: What is the latest artist you’ve signed and why?\n\nA: I just signed a great power-pop band called The Red Button. They are an L.A. duo that releases a record every five to six years, a studio-only group. They have had great critical response in the past and have had two ‘Coolest Songs in the World’ on ‘Little Steven's Underground Garage.’ I am putting out a two-CD set with their earlier two albums, plus a new EP and rarities on Oct 20.\n\nQ: Is running JEM Records a full-time gig or do you have a day job?\n\nA: I have been working for Ray Catena Infiniti of Bridgewater for the past 11 years. I re-started JEM in 2013 when I was asked to appear in a Richard Barone documentary and found out there was an unreleased Bongos album from 1986. I just decided to go back into the business after all these years to release it. If it was not for email, texting and files, I couldn't do this part time. But it has worked out well.\n\nQ: What happened to JEM and Passport Records before 2013? Why did they come to a halt?\n\nA: JEM was taken over by another company in 1988 in a hostile takeover. I started a new label at MCA, Paradox, and then owned a few companies over the years, including the rights to The Beatles and John Lennon's album art collections, which enabled us to open The Art of Music galleries. The galleries closed in the last decade. But they were cool when they were open. I was also a VP for an online portal.\n\nQ: Are you married and is your wife involved in JEM Records at all?\n\nA: I have been married for 37 years to my wife, Toni, who I met in the record business back in the days of Sire/Passport. She was the assistant to the art director of Famous Music, our distributor, and then the art director of Sire. She directed the art for all our albums back then and created some of the most iconic album covers of all time. Everyone knows the first Ramones cover for which she was the art director.\n\nA few years later, I was working with Richard Gottehrer on a Link Ray album and called his office. She answered the phone. I hadn't spoken to har in years. We talked and I asked her to lunch that day. I immediately drove into NYC, and we were married the next year.\n\nToni was very much involved as the art director for Paradox, our label with MCA, where she did covers for The Roches, Marshall Crenshaw and Richard Barone. She has owned art galleries and is has been designing home interiors for the past 12 years.\n\nQ: One of your current artists, The Bayonets have a member, Brian Ray, who will be playing in Paul McCartney’s band as he tours through the New Jersey area in mid-September. How did you come to work with The Bayonets?\n\nA: I first heard The Bayonets on ‘The Underground Garage.’ They had many songs that were ‘Coolest Songs in the World.’ I just went online and contacted Brian Ray and told him I wanted to release their album. We developed a good relationship. He and Oliver Lieber, the other band member, whose father was Jerry Lieber, one of the greatest songwriters of all time, went back into the studio to record a few new tracks that are on the album., which we released on May 19. I look forward to seeing Brian on stage when he and Sir Paul come to Newark next month.\n\nQ: Has a relationship with The Bayonets led to a relationship for you with Paul McCartney?\n\nA: I have never met Sir Paul. I do, however, remember his wife, Nancy, from when both our families lived in Metuchen and Edison and belonged to the same temple and swim club.\n\nQ: How have The Beatles and other ’60s rock and pop bands influenced and informed both JEM Records and your artists?\n\nA: It is no secret. Most, if not all, of JEM artists are influenced by The Beatles, Who, Byrds, Rolling Stones, Hollies and other ’60s groups. The Weeklings are becoming known all over the world as purveyors of rare Lennon/McCartney and Harrison songs, along with their own tunes. Their last album, “Studio 2,” was recorded in that same hallowed room that The Beatles utilized (at Abbey Road Studios). They even were able to use some of the vintage equipment used by The Beatles. Their new single, a great cover of ‘Paperback Writer,’ will be debuted by Chris Carter on Sirius XM's The Beatles Channel 18 on Labor Day morning, so all you will be home to hear it!\n\nThey play many shows in New Jersey, including a residency at West Orange's The Manor's Dome, and three of them are currently on tour backing Max Weinberg on his ‘jukebox’ shows. They will be at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park on Aug. 30.\n\nQ: You grew up in Metuchen, which is a very artistic town. Was it that way when you were growing up there, and if so, how did that environment influence you and your desire to be involved in music?\n\nA: Yes, but it was a very parochial small town. It was not like growing up in New York City. We didn't have rock bands playing in clubs. Toni saw many more artists when she was in her teens than I did. She saw The Beatles many times, including the first Ed Sullivan show, which she never lets me forget. I never saw them.\n\nI was in two bands when I was in high school. I wasn’t a good guitar player but could play any song I heard on the radio and that helped us get gigs. We had an audition at Sceptor Records, which in 1967 was known for Dionne Warwick and B.J. Thomas. Not exactly the hippest label back in the independent days. They didn't sign us, but it was exciting to record in a NYC studio at that age.\n\nQ: What do you like most about living in Far Hills and how long have you lived there?\n\nA: The bucolic forest that surrounds us. We live in ‘horse country’ with horses and sheep on the estate with our Goldendoodle, Sherman, who has his own fan club. There is a cattle farm across the street. It is just beautiful. We have lived in Somerset County for over 25 years.\n\nQ: Is there anything I didn’t ask on which you would like to comment?\n\nA: I would be interested in hearing from artists in the area. I remember getting an unsolicited album from a Canadian band one morning back in the ’70s. I couldn't believe how good it sounded. I immediately reached out and signed them. The next year, the album was platinum in Canada. You never know.\n\nActually, that is how I found Somerdale, our newest band from South Jersey. I read a review of their self-produced album, ‘Shake it Maggie,’ and contacted a radio promoter who was championing them. I signed them as soon as possible and sent them back into the studio to record some new tracks. The album, ‘Maggie Says It Again,’ came out Aug. 11.\n\nStaff Writer Bob Makin: 732-565-7319; bmakin@gannett.com"
