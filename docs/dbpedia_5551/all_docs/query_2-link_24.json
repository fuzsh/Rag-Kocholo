        "text": "You both demo separately in home studios. What do your individual setups look like these days?\n\nSara: I call it “my office.” During the pandemic, I started trying to get myself to say “studio.” People come over sometimes and ask, “Where’s the room where you make music?” I was like, “Oh my god, I need to put guitars on the walls and keyboards out, so people don’t think I’m a crazy person.” I’ve always used Apple products. I record on a Mac. I’ve moved away from Pro Tools and now record exclusively in [Apple] Logic. I use a [Universal Audio] Apollo Twin interface. For all of my demos, I like an old Neumann microphone. That’s it. I don’t use outboard; I don’t use crazy compressors, or equipment that would take up space. I do a ton of recording and demoing. And since The Con, a lot of demoing has ended up on our actual, official, squeaky-clean studio albums. You’d think that I’d be thinking, “Next time, there’s a good chance a lot of my demos will be on the album. I’m going to record that better.” [laughter] But I keep doing it the same way I’ve always done it.\n\nTegan: I use the same setup as Sara. I’ve been on Logic now since 2007. The other day I was in the studio and had to use Pro Tools. I felt pretty accomplished that I still remembered how to use it all these years later! I bought a cabin on an island off the coast of Vancouver a couple years ago. There’s a little writer’s shack – what they call a “bunkie” – on the property, which I’m sitting in right now. I have three guitars, an amp, and my computer set up to record if I want to. Which has proven to be confusing, because I’ll bring my microphone with me somewhere, and I come back here and I’m like, “Why did I bring the microphone? I should just leave one in every place.” So, I leave the microphone there, and I fly back to Vancouver. Then I don’t have a Thunderbolt cable, so I can’t use my interface. So, I order 42 new Thunderbolt cables. None of them are ever where I need to be! [laughter] I’m constantly calling my managers asking to postpone something because I don’t have a Thunderbolt cable. I can hear them thinking, “Are you really a musician?”\n\nFor its great software, Mac has not made it easy to plug and play. I don’t want any more dongles.\n\nT: The dongles; it’s so ugly! Our goal has always been simple. I remember one time I was in the studio with Carly Rae Jepsen, and she records everything on her phone. At the time, internally, I was like, “Come on, Carly.” Now I think that’s the way to go. Just make a voice memo on your phone.\n\nThere are some cool tools for phones these days. You used one in the writing of this album, right?\n\nS: I used the Keezy app on my iPhone to make everything. It’s fucking awesome. My partner, Stacy, her cousin was married to the guy who created it. He showed me Keezy almost ten years ago, and I was like, “This actually seems like something I could use.” I don’t have the patience to learn samplers; but this feels like it’s built for children, so I felt I could use it. I fooled around with it a little bit and then I didn’t think about it again. Then, when I started working on this album and writing songs, I had a folder on my phone with music-related things – a tuner, a metronome, and so on. I saw the Keezy app and opened it up, and I started making samples and sounds. My hard drives are filled with instrumentals, so sometimes I’d open an instrumental and sit with the Keezy app and make weird vocal loops. I didn’t bother to figure out if I could hook my phone up to the computer and use it as a device; I’d hit record and I’d play the Keezy app into my microphone. On a lot of this album, I can hear my..."
