        "text": "By . Published on June 30, 2010.\n\nby Fairy Cake, interview pictures by Christa Holka, live pictures by Sophie Allen.\n\nIt’s 12.15pm on a roasting Thursday afternoon, and, already, a long train of plaid shirts and Very Shane Today haircuts is stretched out along the pavement of Chalk Farm road. The girls shift restlessly against the steel barriers, occasionally tagging each other in School Sports Day fashion to go for toilet breaks, or collect provisions from the adjacent newsagent. There is a particularly queer brand of anticipation in the air. And with good reason. We have exactly 8 hours and 45 minutes until Tegan and Sara play the Roundhouse.\n\nDon’t let my faux-dramatics fool you; I was once a teenage fangirl. And despite my 23 years, it was hard not to be reduced to my dormant pubescent quivering self whilst sat across from one Sara Quin, half of the dynamic duet our aforementioned queuers were lining up to get a glimpse of. But Fairy Cake had to suck it up; if ever there was a time for ridged professionalism, this was it.\n\nThe girls are back once again, after a flying visit late last year, to promote Sainthood, their latest LP, from which two wickedawesome singles (Exibit A and Exibit b) and many a blinding review have sprung. And, contrary to the all too popular spoutation that T+S are “only for gays”, these ladies just keep getting bigger and bigger. After 5 albums worth of infectious-like-a-hospital-bug pop, the twins appear finally to be banging on the door of the mainstream, feeling the damp, gig-tired embrace of not only us queer girlies, but that of the straights, the trannies, the spray-on wearing hipsters, and bizarrely, the occasional besotted White Van Man. Last week’s gig, at London’s 3,000 capacity super-venue, was surely testament. Indie they may be. Niche they are not.\n\nAnyway. We really couldn’t let this little whirlwind of lesbian culture evade us, so we sent Sophie Allen to document the whole shebang in all it’s sweaty, blissed-out glory, whilst Christa and I got our squint on with Quin Number Two on the venue’s roof terrace. There simply isn’t a better way to spend a Thursday. We checked.\n\nSo…it’s not long since you were in our fair city. What do you dig about London…and what do you not?\n\nIt’s interesting. Tegan and I made our first trip to London exactly ten years ago, and I have spent no personal time here, beside likes a show. I have a friend from back home who lives here and I’ve been over to her house for a barbecue – that’s my London experience. But I’m going to spend a week here after Glastonbury. It’s not that I dislike London. It’s quite overwhelming and I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around it. What I do like about London, in terms of our career, is it’s one of those fan-bases that I feel particularly proud of, because it’s come from just hard work and coming back again and again. Sort of groundswell on an organic level. We don’t get a ton of press here; we’re not a big radio band; we’re not super-critically acclaimed; we don’t have a ton of accolades. A lot of the people who come to our shows have found out about us through friends or through the internet. So, i feel particularly proud of the base we’ve been able to build here.\n\nYou say that you’re not big here…but it’s 12.30pm and there are a load of people queuing for tonight’s gig already…and y’know, it’s not just crazy lesbos either…\n\nIt definitely diverse. I mean, I don’t mean to say we’re not big in terms of… I know tonight we’ll do like 26 or 27 hundred tickets. That’s phenomenal.\n\nI remember coming here and playing Water Rats. There were probably eighty people there. There were shows that were bleak, where you’d play to nobody and you and you’d feel like, “what the heck am I doing with my life?” I’m filled with gratitude, that’s a more important feeling when we come here and we play shows like the Roundhouse, because I know that we were able to build a fan-base less traditionally than we have in other places. For example, in Australia, we tour a tremendous amount, but we also had support from radio, and when we go there we know we can hit all the big media outlets. In London, it’s like, “Fingers crossed. Maybe we’ll get coverage in NME, or maybe we’ll get some air time on the BBC”.\n\nIt means a lot to me always, but when we see the kids lined up outside, I’m like “Alright!”, y’know? These kids genuinely care; they’re not here for hype, they’re not here because they’re checking us out, they’re here because they’re really loyal and I think that’s what all bands really want. And it could be all girls and all queer and it wouldn’t make any difference to me. Who comes to our shows matters less to me now than it did in the beginning. I used to worry about diversity and making sure that we weren’t being pigeon-holed. I don’t really give a shit anymore. As long as people come along and they sing and they’re nice.\n\nSo, your record, Sainthood, has got the both of you haloed in paper on the front cover. But how saintly are Tegan and Sara really? You don’t have to front. We’re practicality unshockable.\n\n*laughs*….Umm, I think we’re pretty saintly? I mean, not by religious standards; we’re queer, and I’ve had sex before marriage, I’ve done drugs and drink and I swear all the time and take the Lord’s name in vain. But I think we’re pretty good people. We ran amuck when we were teenagers, and did lots of misbehaving and lashing out and pushing boundaries, that sort of thing, but we’re kind of business people now. We’re pretty normal. I think people get pretty nervous when they come out on the road with us, but we’re afraid we’ll disappoint them because we’re so boring. I read a lot, and I don’t really party. If there was a bad side to me I don’t think I’d be comfortable talking about it anyway…\n\nEspecially not into the dictaphone of some girl you’ve just met…\n\nProbably not! *laughs* But I think we’re pretty saintly where it counts. We always use the cliche that we’re Canadian and that we’re terribly afraid to to disappoint people or hurt people’s feelings. We were raised to be respectful and to be quiet, polite, and I think we’ve managed to do a pretty good job. It’s an irony that we’ve obsessed so much about behaving well and appearing sober and coherent, and yet we spend much of our lives in venues where people are so intoxicated that they’ll puke on themselves, or get kicked out or whatever….I just think, “Wow, we spend so much time worrying about how we appear to drunk people.” They probably don’t even care!\n\nSo, that’s an 8 out of 10 on the saintly scale then. On to your image. A friend of mine saw a picture of you a while back when you were both rocking the hoodie/massive fringe thing, and said you looked ’emo’. Is it true? Are Tegan and Sara emo?\n\nThe emo thing, at least in America…I remember that classification starting maybe on our third record…\n\nDid that actually happen? I was making a funny…\n\nYes, yes!…There was this desperate rush to say what our new record sounded like, and at that time people were using the word ’emo’ everywhere. And then we finally got a write-up in the New York Times, and they wrote this whole piece on how we were the “female version of ’emo'”, which I actually took offence to because I was like “Well, if we’re emo we’re emo, it doesn’t matter if we’re girls.” I think that our music is certainly emotional, but where do you draw the line? I cite our inspirations as Bruce Springsteen and Talking Heads and Sinead O’Connor, y’know, from my childhood. Is Bruce Springsteen emo?\n\nThe Boss is definitely not emo.\n\nBut that’s the thing…that’s how I imagine us; we’re singing restrained loves songs. That’s what Bruce Springsteen does. They’re always heartfelt but I don’t cry on stage or anything like that.\n\nIt’s interesting you say that, because Tegan and yourself don’t really adhere to our idea of the ‘tortured artists’. You’re incredibly grateful and seem to love what you do. How do you get into that place to write? Because you do write about some very dark things…\n\nThere are definitely different personas, and we have our bad days too, but it always stresses me out when I see artists in interviews who look completely put off; like they don’t want to be there. I’m so concerned with seeming ungrateful or like a jerk or whatever that, even when I want to bash my head in during interviews or in public I’ll just put on a happy face…which then of course gives people this idea of “But you’re so happy all the time! You’re so lighthearted!”. I think the nature of being an artist is that you’re constantly analysing yourself and analysing how other people are making you feel, and you’re always in this cycle of self-soothing. Or at least for me. I feel so sensitive, so I’m very aware of how I feel and interpersonal relationships with people I date and people that I dated and the people that I wanna date and my parent’s relationships – and relationships in general. Especially with the last record – I really thought lots about mortality and death. When I’m laughing and making jokes and little videos on the internet people are like, “Oh, you seems so happy”. And I’m like “Right”, but the bulk of my life is spent being a lot more introspective than my public image. When it comes to time to write often it’s a relief to just talk about negative shit. I would hate to be this morose, frowning downer interviewee…I would hate that. But then you get into your writing space and you don’t think “Huh, am I being too much of a downer?”…you never think that…\n\nI guess you just have to let yourself go.\n\nTotally.\n\nBe honest now…do you feel even slightly pissed that it’s Tegan and Sara, not Sara and Tegan?\n\nHahaha…no! Not at all! Honestly, I didn’t imagine that we’d get much further along than a year or two after high school. We saw music as a way to entertain ourselves while we figured out what we were going to do. We had other bands’ names, but because we couldn’t settle on one we just settled on using our own names. And because we were twins and socialised with the same group of friends, it was very common to have people say our names. So I think it just came from that. Actually, a lot of times people would say Sara and Tegan, but it was harder for people to understand, especially if it was really quick. People would be like, “What was that?”. So we thought if we put Tegan first, you would really have to enunciate it, and it would be clearer. Also, Sara is a much more common name, so to have Tegan in front, it forces the mind to remember. And that’s the extremely boring origin of Tegan and Sara…\n\nWe were worried for a minute that she was setting up her solo career…albeit very early on…\n\nNo no! I mean, if anything, I just wish we had a different band name other than our names, y’know? Tegan and I are competitive but it’s in a far less exciting Tabloid-esque way than people would probably imagine. I like to think that we’re runners on the same team. We’re always pushing each other to run faster and have better form, but the goal is always for both of us to succeed. We rarely have conflict. Whenever I’m giving constructive criticism to Tegan it’s not because I want to bring her down or diminish her talent or self esteem, it’s about pushing the project as a whole. And it’s important to have feedback from your teammates. So our competitive nature is far less destructive and exciting probably than people imagine.\n\nWell, we think you’re pretty fucking exciting…\n\nThanks! Well, where it counts I think we are.\n\nTalking of excitement, what’s the most exciting thing that’s happened since you’ve been on tour…?\n\nThis is such a brief tour. We’ve got quite a daunting schedule coming up, so we were hoping to take a little bit of a break and do a little bit of touring in Europe. I mean, I got food poisoning. I was sick for a couple of days at the beginning, so this tour has been eventful in some strange way just because I was ill…so ill. Overall, though, it’s been a synch. I guess for me, the highlight of this tour really is London. Because it’s our biggest show and the one I’ve anticipated the most. The shows in Germany were amazing, and we toured in Ireland and that was great. Germany’s a big market for us…the weather was shit but it was awesome.\n\nWhen you come off tour, are you jumping straight back into the studio?\n\nWell, we’re touring until Christmas this year so…\n\n‘Til Christmas? Bloody hell. That’s a long time away from home. Are either of you in relationships?\n\nTegan is, yeah. Her girlfriend has a pretty flexible lifestyle, she’s a photographer. They’ve managed pretty well. After ten years you sort of figure out how to work it. You can’t really date ‘normal people’, i.e. people that work 5 days a week and only have weekends off; that’s really challenging. I think we’re not naturally drawn to people who live very structured lifestyles…all my closest dearest friends are “normal” people in that sense, and I surround myself with them because I, and the people that I am romantically interested in, live more flexible lifestyles. I don’t work 8 hours a day, I don’t work 5 days a week, I don’t take summers off… I’ve basically non-stop worked for 10 years. I love it. It’s not work to me; it’s just life. So yeah, we tour a lot, and this has been a long tour cycle. We probably would have wrapped in September, but we decided to take on some touring that has less to do with ‘career’ and more to do with ‘life’. Like, we’ve decided to go to places where we’re not even sure we have an audience… I think we’re going to India, and to Singapore and to South America. We’re trying to figure all that out now.\n\nYou seem to have retained a great deal of autonomy, especially since you’re signed to such a big label…how have you managed that?\n\nIt’s not that simple to explain. I think each band is different; Tegan and I have set things up in such a way that allows us to have that autonomy. We signed a very old-school record deal ten years ago. We’re still in the same deal, which we’ve renewed and adjusted, and it works for us. The only thing the record label has any kind of involvement in is the actual albums; all of our touring, all of our merchandising, our books, our side-projects, we do that all ourselves. They basically give us money to make records, and then they try to sell those records. It’s really old-school that way, they have no involvement in the other side of our career. We love having creative control over all aspects of our business, and we understand it in a way that it’s a very specific equation, and I don’t expect the record label to completely understand how to work that equation. It’s more important for Tegan and I to do that ourselves, and use them as a resource when we need to. It’s funny about big record labels. I have tons of friends on small labels, and they really operate the same way. We were on a little label, Vapour… just three people in an office. I know what it’s like to be signed to a small label, and the only difference for us now that we’re on Warner proper is that we have more resources. That’s my experience anyway – but I’ve heard every story under the sun, trust me.\n\nAnd finally, if Tegan and Sara were a cake, what cake would Tegan and Sara be?\n\nHonestly…I don’t like cake.\n\nNoo! Hahaha… In all seriousness, though, we don’t associate with people who don’t like cake. That’s it, we’re done.\n\nWe’re done? Aww, I don’t know what that says about me, that I don’t like sweets. I’m more of a pie person. Maybe an apple pie?\n\nOkay. It’s not really cake but…since it’s you.\n\nAre Jedward the only twins in your record collection? No excuse. T+S’s latest cut Sainthood is both utterly fantastic and available to buy from here. The girls aren’t going to be back for a while, but they’re all over YouTube. In fact, we think you should check out this obscure little podcast they did a few years back. Because it’s the proverbial nuts."
