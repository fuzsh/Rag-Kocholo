        "text": "Remember photographers used to love\n\nto put our faces together?\n\nThey'd be like,\n\nCan you put the tips of your noses together?\n\nAnd Sara was the one\n\nthat finally started to set boundaries.\n\nThis is a fun interview.\n\nYeah, it's like trauma dumping.\n\nWe're like, And then Sara said,\n\n'Would you ask Radiohead to do this?'\n\nHi, I'm Tegan.\n\nI'm Sara.\n\nAnd today, we are taking a look back\n\nat some moment that shaped our career and identity.\n\nThis is Becoming Tegan and Sara.\n\n[Tegan and Sara playing guitar]\n\nSo this is in our senior year of high school.\n\nWhat I sort of know would happen shortly after this clip\n\nis that we would really launch our music career\n\nwhere people wanted to already begin shaping us.\n\nWe were not out in the clip.\n\nWe both had started to explore our identity\n\nand we both sort of understood that we were probably gay.\n\nWe would've said gay back then, not queer.\n\nBut it was gonna still be probably almost another year\n\nbefore we would actually,\n\nwell before I would actually come out to people.\n\nJournalists would be like,\n\nSo, are you writing about your boyfriends?\n\nWhat do your boyfriends think?\n\nAnd it just made me feel nuts.\n\nSuper weird.\n\nEven though we were teenagers, we were 18 years old,\n\nI don't even know very many 18 year olds\n\nthat wanna talk about their sex lives\n\nor their romantic lives with 45 year old men.\n\nEspecially as I got into my senior year of high school\n\nwhen I started to secretly date my best friend\n\nwho was a girl, you can feel the songs really changing.\n\nLeading up to that point, I'm not sure.\n\nWe had songs like Gregory,\n\nwhich was about a boy who freezes to death,\n\nwhich is definitely about acid.\n\nBasically we went through a psychedelic stage\n\nwhere it was sort of like The Grateful Dead,\n\nand then we just went through our gay stage.\n\nYeah, 10th grade is psychedelics,\n\n11th grade is the struggle to get off psychedelics\n\nand then 12th grade is gay love.\n\nIf It Was You was an album\n\nI think that kind of actually launched\n\nthe Tegan and Sara sound.\n\nBefore that, we had sort of been struggling to figure out\n\nexactly who we were, what we wanted to sound like.\n\nAnd to me, it was sort of a return to kind of our roots.\n\nWe'd grown up listening to a lot\n\nof rock music and punk music,\n\nand If It Was You just had a snotty, punky style.\n\nJust, it corresponds in my mind\n\nwith the time where we really became ourselves.\n\nHi, my hair.\n\nHi, I'm Sara and I'm from Tegan and Sara\n\nand this is our European trip.\n\nWhat this video is is that Sara and I filmed everything.\n\nThis is, remember, it's 2002.\n\nIt's pre-YouTube, pre-influencers, pre-social media.\n\nWe got signed when we were 19\n\nand all our friends went off to college\n\nand we wouldn't see people.\n\nWe couldn't talk to anyone and we didn't have cell phones,\n\nwe didn't have the ability to stay in touch,\n\nand so we filmed everything.\n\nAnd then I would come home\n\nand I would edit together these videos.\n\nWe would put it up on our website.\n\nAnd six people would find it.\n\nYeah, but I can remember our managers being like,\n\nYou're paying so much money for hosting all of this data.\n\nIt's sweet.\n\nI mean, we're on tour in Europe and then into the States,\n\nand you can just see us deteriorate over this clip\n\nand we just get more and more exhausted looking.\n\nIt's the receipts that we really paid our dues.\n\nWe did it.\n\nNow artists are like, Oh my God, touring is so exhausting.\n\nOur bus broke down.\n\nAnd I'm like, a bus?\n\nYou just put out your first album!\n\nIt took us eight years to get to a bus.\n\nWe put out our album So Jealous in 2004.\n\nThat was our fourth record.\n\nIt was the record where we both sort of felt\n\nlike we were legitimately being accepted as a band.\n\nAll of a sudden, places like Rolling Stone and Spin\n\nwere having us into their offices to meet with journalists.\n\nRolling Stone ended up saying\n\nSo Jealous was one of the top 50 records of that year.\n\nIt just felt legitimate. It was a big year.\n\nWe both got bangs.\n\n[Tegan] We both got baby bangs actually.\n\nSpin had written this terrible review\n\nand called us Wiccan-folk nightmares.\n\nIt was actually being accepted by straight men\n\nthat made the media stop ignoring us,\n\nbecause they had to listen to the men\n\nthat they deemed important.\n\nSo Jack White from The White Stripes\n\ncovered Walking With A Ghost from So Jealous\n\nand it was like, White Stripes were worshiped\n\nby these magazines.\n\nOut of context, it feels really sad\n\nwhen you really dissect it and magnify it,\n\nbut in content in that moment, it was overnight.\n\nYeah, people started to talk about us.\n\nIt was just like we were legitimate.\n\nWe were just like, oh we're in a band.\n\nIt felt like we were maybe having to convince people less\n\nthat we were real.\n\nWe were still shrugging off that early age affiliation\n\nwith teen singers,\n\nor this idea that we had been put together\n\nby a record company.\n\nIt took years to convince people, which is exhausting,\n\nbut I think this was the record\n\nwhere people were like, Okay.\n\nOh yeah, I know what this is.\n\n[Tegan and Sara performing]\n\nSpeaking of trauma dumping.\n\nI believe this was from the third season of The L Word.\n\nIt shot up in Vancouver.\n\nWe had been hearing rumors\n\nthat there was a show about lesbians.\n\nI didn't have cable, I was living in Montreal.\n\nI knew one couple who seemed very rich to me at the time.\n\nI remember they had cable,\n\nbut they would record each episode weekly\n\nand then they would give the VHS tapes\n\nto me and my girlfriend at the time.\n\nAnd then I remember we brought it on tour\n\nand Tegan had not seen it, so we were like,\n\nWe have something to show you.\n\nAnd we would all crowd onto our tour bus\n\nand we would watch these bootleg versions of The L Word.\n\nIt was a joy, it was a total joy.\n\nIt was super cool.\n\nWhen we read the script\n\nand the portrayal of them on drugs, I remember thinking,\n\nNone of these people have ever done drugs before,\n\nand that's clear from re-watching the clip.\n\nDo you know who's a lesbian?\n\nDana Fairbanks.\n\nTo this day, gay people will come up to me and be like,\n\nDana Fairbanks is gay.\n\nStill people say that to me all the time\n\nand I think it's like,\n\nI'm so proud to be a part of that moment.\n\n♪ A million hours left to think of you and think of that ♪\n\nThe music video for The Con,\n\nwhich was from the album The Con, came out in 2007.\n\nWe actually shot this video,\n\nit was the day before our 27th birthday,\n\nand I know this because I was so profoundly depressed.\n\nMy girlfriend had broken up with me\n\nand I had cried the whole night before shooting the video.\n\nThe hair and makeup and wardrobe team felt so sorry for me\n\nthat they gave me a pair of Paul Smith sneakers\n\nfor my birthday.\n\nAnd our mullets are on point.\n\n[Sara] Our mullets are so sleek.\n\nWe look like seals.\n\nIt's like, there's almost a sheen.\n\n[Tegan] They're beautiful. I wanna pet us.\n\n[Tegan] Yeah. Very on point, and actually,\n\nI really really loved my T-shirt in this video\n\nand it's just a good reminder to myself\n\nthat I just should stop...\n\nStop giving away your clothes.\n\nWhy do I always give away my clothes,\n\n'cause I would love to have that T-shirt still.\n\nThe record was about anxiety.\n\nI talked to the video director, Suzie, and was just like,\n\nI just told her how anxious I was\n\nabout absolutely everything, and I just loved her treatment.\n\nIt just, especially the end\n\nwhere I'm drowning in the bathtub.\n\nIt was also very stressful to pretend to drown,\n\nbut it's pretty awesome to watch.\n\nFor us, even though we were indie rock,\n\nthere was so much emo in us,\n\nand the emo world was much more,\n\nthey embraced us so much more than the indie rock world did.\n\nIt's a record that so many people refer to\n\nas a beloved Tegan and Sara record,\n\nbut it was actually kind of a slow burn.\n\nThe first six months of that record cycle,\n\nwe used to play the record start to finish\n\nand then we would play it backwards.\n\nWe'd play it from song one to 14\n\nand then play 14 to one for the same audience.\n\nWe were like, You're gonna love the record, trust me.\n\nYou just need to listen to it twice.\n\nWhile we are being so blatantly candid and open\n\nwith our audience, it's a double edged sword\n\nbecause you cannot all of a sudden be like,\n\nWell I don't wanna talk about my sexuality.\n\nWe got more formal about our activism in 2007, 2008.\n\nI remember probably it coinciding with Obama, Prop 8.\n\nInstead of it being a question of,\n\nSo you guys are gay?\n\nDo you write your songs about girls?\n\nTell me more.\n\nIt was like, So you guys are gay,\n\nwhat do you think about what's happening politically\n\nin the United States or around the world\n\nwhen it comes to LGBTQ rights?\n\nIt sort of required us to adopt more language\n\nand more of a position, I guess you could say,\n\nwhich felt really natural.\n\nWe thought of ourselves and our concerts as safe spaces.\n\nWe weren't using that phrase,\n\nbut we'd go through Tulsa\n\nor we'd go through Columbus or Kansas City,\n\nand we knew that we were a gay happening.\n\nYeah, that was an exciting time.\n\nI felt like that was actually the start, for me,\n\nof kind of empowering ourselves as not just gay musicians,\n\nbut we became, I think, important leaders\n\nin the queer movement within the music industry.\n\n♪ All I wanna get is ♪\n\n♪ A little bit closer ♪\n\nOh my God, we're skipping Sainthood.\n\nCan I just publicly say, we are skipping Sainthood,\n\nwhich is my favorite Tegan and Sara album,\n\nwhich is probably saying a lot.\n\nI've always been known in the industry as deep cut Sara.\n\nI think the evolution from The Con into Sainthood\n\ninto Heartthrob felt like we could distinguish ourselves\n\nfrom what people thought we were still.\n\nWomen especially, we just get boxed in\n\nand Sara and I felt very much\n\nlike we didn't wanna be told what to do.\n\nAnd we were on a major label and they were basically like,\n\nYou have your lane. And we were like, Well we wanna work\n\nwith the biggest pop producer in the world\n\nand we wanna make a huge record.\n\nIt was a concerted effort that we made\n\nto go in a different direction, but to be perfectly honest,\n\nit was just, I wrote Closer,\n\nand when you write something that is undeniably pop,\n\nit's four on the floor, the hook is right off the top.\n\nWhen I sent it to Sara, she wrote me back 10 minutes later\n\nand said, This is a hit.\n\n♪ Here comes the breath before we get a little bit closer ♪\n\nThe video felt like, it was one of the first times\n\nI remember feeling like the record label was meddling.\n\nI remember having a lot of fights with the label\n\nand with our managers at the time.\n\nIt was just this emphasis on,\n\nWell you're so feminine and you're so pretty\n\nand you're so different than what people think queer is,\n\nand it was just, we knew what that language meant.\n\nThe original stylist who had been booked showed up\n\nand there were tank tops and things like that,\n\nand my girlfriend at the time called a friend of hers\n\nwho was dressing Hayley from Paramore at the time\n\nand she came in last minute, opened up our suitcases\n\nand brought a few items of her own and dressed us,\n\nbecause we were like,\n\nOh my God, we're not gonna wear tank tops in the video.\n\nI think we were one of the first bands\n\nthat also was tapping into something\n\nthat maybe didn't actually look like our lives.\n\nThese were sort of coded ways\n\nof saying we're queering something we've all seen before,\n\nthe sort of high school movie vibe at a party,\n\nbut we're gonna make it gay.\n\nI think it's better having it be our secret.\n\nTotally.\n\nWe wanted to write a book about the late 90s\n\nwhen we were 15, 16 and 17.\n\nWe pitched it, we wrote a proposal,\n\nand then all of a sudden we had a book\n\nthat we needed to write.\n\nAlmost immediately when we started writing the book,\n\nwe were like, This will make a totally cool TV show.\n\nIt was a really amazing journey.\n\nWe shot the show this last spring in Calgary,\n\nwhere we grew up.\n\nWe actually shot in our high school\n\nwhere we went to high school.\n\nI don't know if I think of it\n\nas being highly fictionalized.\n\nI think it's the Tegan and Sara story.\n\nI just, I never got to see teenagers play guitar\n\nor learn how to play guitar, girls.\n\nThese formative moments of struggling with my identity\n\nbut also falling in love and having a sexual relationship\n\nwith my best friend that I had to keep under wraps,\n\nto see that come alive on screen was just so moving to me.\n\nAnd I think the show captures that sort of feeling\n\nof when you first realize that you're gay\n\nand it's not just falling in love with one person,\n\nit's like the possibility of love is everywhere.\n\nBut often with gay stories, we only get to see,\n\nBill realizes that he loves Ted, and then...\n\nBill and Ted?\n\nIt's one on one to one or something.\n\nI don't know, just throwing out some big names, whatever.\n\nBut when I was gay and a teenager,\n\nI kinda felt like I was falling in love\n\nwith every girl that I saw\n\nand every girl I was friends with.\n\nI think it also captures the drug experience\n\nbetter than the other show we were talking about.\n\nCrybaby is a lot like Sainthood, actually.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nIt feels like a bit of an experimental record for us.\n\nIt's our 10th album and I sort of have this nervousness\n\nor this insecurity, how many more albums can a band make\n\nafter they've made 10?\n\nThinking about how you're gonna keep people\n\nexcited and invested, even though there's albums\n\nthat they already really really love\n\nand songs that they return to.\n\nHow do you compete with that?\n\nSo I feel like we gave it our best shot.\n\nI think it's a really strong album, start to finish.\n\n♪ We hit play, feels like yesterday ♪\n\nWhen we were coming up with an idea\n\nfor the Yellow music video,\n\nI was pitching all these extremely complicated,\n\nextremely expensive ideas, and Sara wrote back and said,\n\nMight be too on the nose,\n\nbut should we just remake Coldplay's 'Yellow' video\n\nin our own way?\n\nIt could be kinda cool 'cause there was one of him\n\nbut there's two of us.\n\nAnyway, it ended up working out perfectly\n\nbecause in his video, Chris Martin's walking up the beach\n\nand it's raining.\n\nIt had been blazing hot in Vancouver all week\n\nand then the day that we shot this at 4:30 in the morning,\n\nit started to rain, so we're soaking wet on the beach.\n\nIt was as if the heavens above opened up and were like,\n\nYes, two bands can have a song called 'Yellow',\n\ndifferent songs but have the same video.\n\nI dare to say, I see a legacy.\n\nBecause of what we did and the road we walked,\n\nI see bands now coming out or artists coming out\n\nthat may not even have heard of Tegan and Sara,\n\nbut I know that our legacy is that those bands get exposure\n\nin ways that they wouldn't have 20 years ago,\n\nthat people's minds were changed in important ways\n\nto make space for those kinds of artists\n\nand those kinds of bands.\n\nI don't think ever about myself\n\nas an iconic lesbian artist.\n\nThose words definitely don't,\n\nI think it's probably best,\n\neven if people think you're an icon,\n\nto never think of yourself as one.\n\nLike when your wife is mad at you and you're like,\n\nI'm an icon. Do you know who you're talking to?\n\nYeah, I just, I don't\n\nbecause I still feel like that Tegan in 1998\n\noutside of her high school\n\nwith the middle part and the K Way jacket.\n\nI just feel like I'm 18.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who watched.\n\nThanks for having us.\n\nYes, this was Becoming with Tegan and Sara.\n\nOr Becoming Tegan and Sara.\n\nIs this Becoming Tegan and Sara? Do we dress people now\n\nand get them into outfits that look like us?\n\nBecoming Tegan and Sara, a new show on HGTV.\n\nYeah.\n\nBecome Tegan and Sara because they're too old to do this now\n\nand they would like younger people to do it.\n\n[light music]"
