        "text": "The first single off Tegan and Sara’s September album, Hey, I’m Just Like You, is a punky bop with a spiraling earworm chorus reminiscent of their So Jealous days.\n\nSara herself directed and illustrated the animated lyric video (hello, Renaissance Woman), in which endearing cloud-shaped creatures experience commitment issues, run away, and promise (tentatively, possibly falsely) to come back someday. Watch it below.\n\nTickets go on sale tomorrow for the twins’ North American tour in support of their forthcoming memoir, High School. Their ninth studio album coincides with the book’s release; while doing writing research, T&S stumbled upon two cassette tapes containing the first songs they ever wrote as teenagers in the ’90s. They’ve updated and rebooted those songs for this record.\n\nHey, I’m Just Like You is out September 27 via Sire. Pre-order it here, and see a list of upcoming tour dates below. One dollar from every ticket sold benefits the Tegan and Sara Foundation, which fights for health, economic justice, and representation for LGBTQ girls and women.\n\nTegan and Sara on Tour\n\n9/24 – Brooklyn, NY – MurMrr Theatre**\n\n9/28 – Los Angeles, CA – Orpheum Theatre**\n\n9/30 – San Diego, CA – Balboa Theatre**\n\n10/1 – San Francisco, CA – Sydney Goldstein Theater**\n\n10/3 – Portland, OR – Aladdin Theater**\n\n10/4 – Seattle, WA – Illsley Ball Nordstrom Recital Hall (early & late shows)**\n\n10/5 – Vancouver, BC – Vogue Theatre\n\n10/9 – Edmonton, AB – Myer Orowitz Theatre\n\n10/10 – Calgary, AB – Bella Concert Hall (early & late shows)\n\n10/12 – Winnipeg, MB – Garrick Centre\n\n10/13 – St. Paul, MN – Fitzgerald Theatre\n\n10/15 – Evanston, IL – Northwestern University – Cahn Auditorium\n\n10/16 – Columbus, OH – Lincoln Theatre\n\n10/17 – Detroit, MI – Royal Oak Music Theatre\n\n10/19 – Toronto, ON – Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre\n\n10/22 – Ottawa, ON – Algonquin Commons Theatre\n\n10/23 – Montreal, QC – Corona Theatre\n\n10/25 – Boston, MA – Wilbur Theatre\n\n10/26 – Glenside, PA – Keswick Theatre\n\n10/27 – Washington, DC – Lincoln Theatre\n\n10/29 – Nashville, TN – CMA Theater\n\n10/30 – Atlanta, GA – Variety Playhouse\n\n11/1 – Austin, TX – State Theatre (early & late shows)\n\n**Purchase of any show ticket in Brooklyn, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle includes one copy of Tegan and Sara’s High School memoir, supplied by local independent bookstores they have partnered with to celebrate the release of the book."
