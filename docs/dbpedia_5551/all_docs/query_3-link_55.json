On March 11th, Sire will release his third studio album and his debut album on Fearless Records, MOOD SWINGS. Written/co-written by Sire and produced alongside Jon Lundin (Sleeping with Sirens, Good Charlotte) and Bruce Wiegner (Katy Perry), the album is his most authentic project to date, and the 11-tracks find Sire grappling with anxiety and the highs and lows of love, filled with his signature alternative pop and hip-hop sound inflected with his darkly ironic sense of humor.\n\nIn addition to MOOD SWINGS, the past year has brought a multitude of other creative ventures for Sire, including creating his NGMI (Not Gonna Make It) Podcast, launching his exclusive Patreon, and co-founding his CBD brand, happyface."
