        "text": "2009 studio album by Tegan and Sara\n\nSainthoodStudio album by ReleasedOctober 26, 2009 ( )RecordedMid-2009Studio\n\nSound City, Los Angeles, California\n\nTwo Sticks Audio, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nLength36:55LabelSireProducerTegan and Sara chronology\n\nThe Con\n\n(2007) Sainthood\n\n(2009) 2010 Summer Tour\n\n(2010)\n\nSingles from Sainthood\n\nReleased: October 2, 2009\n\nReleased: October 26, 2009\n\nSainthood is the sixth studio album by the Canadian indie pop duo Tegan and Sara, released in the UK on October 26, 2009 and in the US on October 27, by Sire Records.[1]\n\nThe album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2010 Polaris Music Prize.[2]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is the first album by Tegan and Sara to feature a song co-written by the pair, as they usually choose to write separately. However, it was not written while Tegan and Sara stayed together in New Orleans as an attempt to write together. No songs from that time made it on to the album, although one such song lends its title to that of the record. The album title was inspired by a Leonard Cohen lyric. The record also includes co-written songs from Tegan's side project with Hunter Burgan, bassist of AFI.\n\nThe album is described by the band as such:[3]\n\nTegan and Sara's sixth studio album – Sainthood – addresses secular themes of devotion, delusion, and exemplary behavior in the pursuit of love and relationships. Inspired by emotional longing and the quiet actions we hope may be noticed by the objects of our affection, Sainthood is about obsession with romantic ideals.\n\nIn the service of relationships we practice being perfect. We practice our sainthood in the hope that we will be rewarded with adoration. As we are driven to become anything for someone else, we sometimes become martyrs for our cause.\n\nLove, like faith, can never be held in an individual's hands. But the story of a great love affair – especially one that is unrequited or has ended too soon – can be woven like scripture or a bedtime story. And so the themes of Sainthood are tied together by this simple title, borrowed, with great respect, from the lyrics of the Leonard Cohen song \"Came So Far for Beauty\":\n\nI practiced all my sainthood / I gave to one and all / But the rumours of my virtue / They moved her not at all.\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nSainthood was released in the UK on October 26, 2009.[4]\n\nThe album was produced by Death Cab for Cutie guitarist Chris Walla and was tracked at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles and Two Sticks Audio in Seattle during the summer of 2009.\n\nTegan and Sara released the full album for online streaming on their MySpace page on October 20, 2009.\n\nEE Storey, the band's artistic director, designed the album artwork.\n\nWhen speaking with Alter the Press! in November 2009, the band revealed that the second single to be lifted from Sainthood would be \"Alligator\".[5]\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[6]Alter the Press![7]The A.V.
