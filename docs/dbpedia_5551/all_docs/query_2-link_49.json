        "text": "Image: Eluvier Acosta\n\nCanadian duo Tegan and Sara today release their new single, ‘Yellow’ which will appear on their tenth studio album CRYBABY due for release on October 21, their first album for new label Mom+Pop Music.\n\n‘Yellow’ is a gorgeous, sweeping pop track peppered with addictive, sublime melodies that just keep on coming, making it a joyful listen from beginning to end. It is the kind of track that grabs you by the heart from the very first listen and refuses to let go. Lyrically it deals with healing, finding peace and letting go of the traumas of the past.\n\n“[‘Yellow’} was written after we began to take steps to heal the bruises we have both carried with us since adolescence and early adulthood – wounds that never quite healed right and flare up seasonally, sending us spiralling backward in time,” Sara says. “Are we doomed to remain forever 15, breaking up and breaking apart? I hope not.”\n\nAlso released today is the stunning one shot, slow motion video for ‘Yellow’. Directed by Mark Myers, it was shot on Spanish Banks Beach in Vancouver and is an intentional nod to the 2000 Coldplay hit of the same name. “It was shot in Vancouver, a city that didn’t feel big enough to hold us both when we arrived here the first time,” Sara says. “Twenty-two years later, we’re back, calling it home.”\n\n‘Yellow’ will feature on Tegan and Sara’s tenth studio album CRYBABY, their first album of new material since 2019. Produced by the band with John Congleton (Angel Olsen, Sharon Van Etten), it was recorded in Seattle and Los Angeles. The album, which Sara calls ‘my bedroom electronic record’, saw the sisters evolve in how they collaborate, becoming involved in each other’s songs in a way they never had before.\n\n“This was the first time where, while we were still drafting our demos, we were thinking about how the songs were going to work together,” says Tegan. “It wasn't even just that Sara was making lyric changes or reorganising the parts to my songs, it was that she was also saying to me, ‘This song is going to be faster,’ or ‘It's going to be in a different key.’ But Sara effectively improves everything of mine that she works on.”\n\n“Maybe I am the renovator. I’m the house-flipper of the Tegan and Sara band,” Sara adds.\n\n2022 is shaping up to be a massive year for the beloved duo, who have been releasing music for over 20 years. Beginning on October 26 they will embark on a North American tour, finishing in Vancouver on November 20. Amazon Freevee will also be releasing the television series High School, based on Tegan and Sara’s memoir of the same name and executive produced by the band and Clea DuVall. This will be followed by middle-grade graphic novel duology Tegan & Sara: Junior High and Tegan & Sara: Crush, written by the twins and illustrated by award winning illustrator Tillie Walden.\n\nCreating music that always has storytelling, openness and vulnerability at its heart Tegan and Sara are one of the true legends of music to emerge from the underground/indiepop scene of the early 2000s. Eclectic, mesmerising and life affirming, they are a band that never disappoint and this new era in their music is looking to be one of their most exciting yet.\n\n‘Yellow’ is out now via Mom+Pop Music. You can download and stream here.\n\nCRYBABY will be released on October 21 via Mom+Pop Music. You can pre-order and pre-save here.\n\nTo keep up with all things Tegan and Sara you can follow them on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter."
