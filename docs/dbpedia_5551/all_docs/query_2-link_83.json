        "text": "Canadian twin sisters Tegan and Sara Quin began performing together at an early age, moving from high-school punk bands to an eventual deal with Neil Young's record label.\n\nAfter the sisters' 2000 debut (The Business of Art) spawned tours with several of their heroes — including Young and The Pretenders — they built considerable momentum with 2002's If It Was You. Two years later, So Jealous lent a poppier feel to Tegan and Sara's distinctive punk-folk sound, in the process making many critics' year-end Top 10 lists. The pair just released its fifth album, the similarly accessible The Con."
