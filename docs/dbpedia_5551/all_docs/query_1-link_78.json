        "text": "Did you know that gay people make music? Some of the best pop music ever written has been bestowed upon us by queer people, but that hasn't stopped JoJo Siwa from thinking she's created a new genre called \"gay pop\" with her re-branded single \"Karma.\"\n\nEnter gay pop pioneers Tegan and Sara, who have lightly clowned on the performer on TikTok for insinuating her song has created music for the gays. They start their video by stitching an interview where Siwa says, \"I wanna start a new genre of music, and they said 'What do you mean?' And I said, 'Well, it's called gay pop.'\" It then cuts to the twins knowingly smirking into the camera in silence.\n\nObviously, Tegan and Sara aren't in the business of starting internet beef with a 20-year-old whose only crime is trying to find her place in the adult world. \"These gay pop stars love JoJo,\" they wrote in their TikTok's caption.\n\nSure, \"Karma\" isn't great, and maybe Siwa's comment was a little uninformed. But which pop star trying to make a name for themselves as a serious performer hasn't fumbled a little bit? She will figure it out — especially with people in her court to help her along the way."
