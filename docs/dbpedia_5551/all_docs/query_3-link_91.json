        "text": "Stein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1942. He had a love for music from a young age, and in the 1950s, he began collecting records and attending shows. As mentioned previously, Stein co-founded Sire Records with Richard Gottehrer. The label initially focused on releasing soul and R&B records, but soon expanded its reach to include punk, new wave, and other genres. Unearthing bands such as The Pretenders, Ministry, Ice-T, Depeche Mode, Echo & The Bunnymen and The Undertones.\n\nOne of Stein’s biggest discoveries was the Ramones, whom he signed to Sire Records in 1975. The band’s raw, stripped-down sound was a departure from the polished rock of the time, and their influence on punk and alternative music cannot be overstated. Stein also signed other influential acts such as Talking Heads, Madonna, and The Smiths.\n\nThroughout his career, Stein was known for his keen ear and ability to spot talent before it hit the mainstream. He had a reputation for taking risks on artists who might not have been initially popular, but who went on to become superstars.\n\nStein’s impact on the music industry was recognized with numerous awards, including induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. He was also honored with a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2016.\n\nStein’s passing was mourned by many in the music industry, who took to social media to pay tribute to the legendary A&R executive. Madonna tweeted, “Thank you for believing in me Seymour,” while The Killers’ Brandon Flowers called Stein “one of the greatest A&R men of all time.”\n\nIn the end, Seymour Stein’s life was a testament to the power of music and the impact that one person can have on an entire industry. His passion, talent, and dedication will be missed, but his legacy will live on through the artists he discovered and the music he helped to shape."
