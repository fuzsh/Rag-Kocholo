Tegan and Sara's recording careers started in 1997, when they used their school's recording studio to record their first demo. In 1999, the Canadian sisters independently released their debut LP, "Under Feet Like Ours." Their poppy, emotive indie-folk style attracted the attention of Neil Young's label Vapor Records, who signed them in 2000. Later that year, they released another album, "This Business of Art."

The band released another studio album, "If It Was You," in 2002, followed two years later by their fourth, "So Jealous." In 2007, their album "The Con" found the band experimenting with a more complex, mature, and varied sound, while their latest full-length, 2009's "Sainthood," finds the duo returning to their simple, melodic roots while continuing to try on new styles.

Tegan and Sara stopped by Minnesota Public Radio's UBS Forum for a live performance in front of a studio audience.
