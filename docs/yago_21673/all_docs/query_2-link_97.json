        "text": "Just before turning 30, I decided I no longer wanted to work five days a week.\n\nWorking long hours had left me feeling exhausted and burnt out, with little energy left over for family and friends.\n\nMy work life didn't feel aligned with my personal values and although the prospect of earning less was daunting, I craved a slower, more mindful way of living.\n\nFast-forward a decade, and I'm still happily working part-time hours — while holding down a mortgage solo and running my own business.\n\nHere are some lifestyle changes that made part-time work possible for me.\n\nCreating a budget to save a nest egg\n\nIn the lead-up to quitting my full-time job, I saved hard. I was determined to build a solid nest egg to ensure a soft and safe landing into my next step.\n\nI also created a budget to determine the minimum amount of money I needed to survive — and thus how many hours I needed to work.\n\nI started with the standard budgeting approach: writing down every expense I had, then breaking each one down into monthly and weekly amounts to set aside.\n\nSome of these expenses were fixed costs that simply had to be paid. But others I had agency over — such as clothing and dining out. I realised that spending less in these areas would directly equate to being able to work less, so I made adjustments accordingly.\n\nI embraced sharing, bartering, buying second-hand\n\nWhile working full-time, I often found myself rushing, struggling to fit everything in and relying on costly quick-convenience measures to fulfil basic needs.\n\nWorking less has cut a lot of that out, meaning I need less money day-to-day. I now have time to prioritise a more sustainable permaculture lifestyle, which is almost always cheaper too.\n\nSome of my favourite thrifty living approaches include:\n\nSearching for things I need on the second-hand market first — everything from clothing and furniture to building materials and garden tools.\n\nSupplementing my diet with homegrown veggies, foraged edible weeds and even supermarket bin-diving.\n\nBuying a cheap car that I could pay for outright rather than taking out a loan – and aiming to ride my bike where possible to save on petrol.\n\nConnecting to the \"free economy\" via my local Buy Nothing group\n\nSharing internet with my neighbours.\n\nChoosing cheaper ways to have fun with friends, such as beach picnics or homemade dinners over expensive nights out. My favourite book — The Art of Frugal Hedonism — is a constant source of ideas.\n\nWorking part-time to help manage chronic illness\n\nShortly after going part-time, I suffered a severe back injury that has left me with daily chronic pain. I also have a brain type that is sensitive to sensory overload and burnout.\n\nThese two elements have become firm feedback loops in my life, forcing me to get serious about my working capacity, energy levels and how much rest I need.\n\nI now work to two budgets — money and energy.\n\nFinancially, I pay myself a small weekly \"wage\" into a personal account, to cover groceries, living expenses and entertainment. This self-imposed spending limit helps me live within my means without the tedium of logging every expense in a spreadsheet.\n\nEnergy-wise, I use time blocking in my calendar to ensure I'm working enough to make a stable living without overcommitting and putting myself at risk of pain flare-ups or burnout.\n\nThis is a practical application of the permaculture principle: 'Apply self-regulation and accept feedback.'\n\nNegotiating for part-time hours\n\nWhile calls for a four-day work week are growing in Australia, not all businesses are open-minded about the idea.\n\nOne chief executive told me I needed to \"be more realistic\" when I shared my dream of working part-time.\n\nHappily, flexible roles are more common post-pandemic – I was easily able to find fulfilling permanent part-time roles for several years while building my own business.\n\nNow that I set my own hours, I take Fridays off and schedule a 'rest week' every three months – a business structure that supports my well-being while also modelling a more diverse approach to working life.\n\nIn return, I experience a positive feedback loop. I feel more focused and productive on workdays. The quarterly holidays allow me to zoom out, take stock and assess the bigger picture. And the four-day work week offers space to reshuffle my workload for rest when chronic pain knocks me for six.\n\nWhen I look back on my life so far, my fondest memories have involved experiences beyond office hours. For me, cultivating a lifestyle that supports part-time work helps maximise time for the business of actually living.\n\nKoren Helbig is a sustainable city living educator who practices permaculture and grows organic food in the backyard of her small urban Tarntanya/Adelaide home."
