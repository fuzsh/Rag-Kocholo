        "text": "As always, there are plenty of fascinating, odd movies in the Cannes Film Festival lineup this year. There’s Woody Allen’s Café Society, starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, a movie called American Honey, starring Shia LaBeouf, a new Pedro Almodóvar flick called Julieta, and plenty more where that came from. But the race for Cannes’s weirdest project already has a clear winner, as a new film starring John Malkovich from director Robert Rodriguez will also make its debut at the festival . . . but in a safe. Where it will remain. Until 2115.\n\n100 Years: The Movie You Will Never See is a Hollywood time capsule of sorts. The film imagines what Earth will be like a century from now, but will be locked away from human eyes until that time actually happens. The safe was specially designed to be impenetrable until it automatically opens in 2115. So, unless modern science makes some serious advancements (fingers crossed!), it’s safe to say that most of us reading this will never get a chance to watch it.\n\nClandestine nature aside, even films no one can watch need a press junket; the safe will travel the world—Los Angeles, Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, New York—before it lands in Cognac, France, where it will remain in the cellars of Louis XIII (the cognac, not the king who died in 1643). Hopefully they’re up to the task of protecting this nation’s now most precious secret from eager cinephiles, who by now have learned from plenty of movies how to break into places and steal stuff—preferably in teams of 11, 12, or 13, with the help of Mini Coopers, or with just Nicolas Cage on their side. But no matter—we’re sure they have top men working on it right now.\n\n24 Delightful Star Wars: The Force Awakens Cameos You Might Have Missed\n\n1 / 11\n\nProust Questionnaire\n\nThe Proust Questionnaire: John Malkovich\n\nHe has been in more than 70 movies, including this month’s Red 2.

Vance Is About as Flat as a Day-Old Diet Mountain Dew\n\nNotably heavy on cruelty and light on charisma, Donald Trump's running mate is already giving Republicans buyer's remorse as they reckon with a more daunting Democratic ticket.\n\nCelebrity\n\nBlues Legend John Mayall Is Dead at 90\n\nA giant of the great British blues boom of the 1960s was a musical change-agent who revered and honored his forebears.\n\nTelevision\n\nJohn Oliver Begs Republicans to “Stop Being So F–king Weird”\n\n“The ‘weird’ label has been particularly hard to shake because Republican candidates further down the ballot keep compounding it, including some who won primaries just this week.”\n\nTelevision\n\nJohn Oliver Tears Into Trump’s “Disastrous” Attack on Kamala Harris’s Multiracial Identity\n\n“Putting Trump in front of a Black audience and asking him to speak on race was never gonna get more elevated than, ‘The lady said she was both Indian and Black—that is cheating!’”\n\nTelevision\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics Are Best as a Streaming Event\n\nWatching the Paris games via the Peacock app has greatly expanded our Olympics diet."
