        "text": "In all probability, we, 21st century barbarians, will not be very well loved by our 23rd century descendants.\n\nNon-historians of that age will probably group us together with the generations of the late 20th century, and refer to us collectively in their high-school level history courses. We are the generations who baked the earth and poisoned the seas. We wiped out thousands of animal species and held the world hostage for almost a century under the threat of nuclear or biological annihilation. Our insanity almost brought about human extinction and led to the Second Dark Ages, from which they are only just recovering.\n\n\"You want to give our time travel technology to those mad men? ARE YOU NUTS? Leave them in the past where their damage has already been done. We don't need them coming up here to further screw up our present!\"\n\nHere's another option that is often forgotten: Time travel might need an exit system available at the destination. Since we don't have an exit system in our time, time travellers cannot visit us.\n\nFor example, time travel might be done through a wormhole whose two ends are shifted in time relative to each other, so if you enter one opening, you come back through the other opening, say, one year earlier. Going back several years would work by passing it several times, and going back is done by passing it the opposite way. Then of course you only can travel to times after that wormhole has been established.\n\nEdit:\n\nHere's a second thought that occurred to me: What if the time machine doesn't travel with you? Think of the Star Trek transporter: If people are beamed to the surface of a planet, the transporter doesn't travel with them; it remains on the ship. If they couldn't ask the people on the ship to beam them up again (say, if the transporter could only beam them away), and there were no other means to fetch them back (like shuttles), they would be stranded on the planet.\n\nIn a similar way, a time traveller that comes to our time would be stranded in our time; we simply don't have time machines to send him back into his time, and probably don't have the ability to build one in his life time even if they'd bring the plans with them, nor the energy required to operate it. Which would be a strong disincentive for anyone to visit us, unless he actually wants to live in our time â€” but in the latter case, he'll probably not tell us that he's a time traveller, as that will be counter productive for his plans.\n\nEver noticed how people in time travel stories mess everything up? And then somehow by the skin of their teeth manage to put everything back to rights? Things probably don't actually work like that. About half of the time the calvary doesn't arrive in time, the answer to the riddle fails to pop into the hero's head, the match doesn't light, the green wire blows up the bomb. Time travel gives people infinite chances to mess everything up. Each chance to destroy the world plays out instantly as time travel is invented -- time travel takes all the possible spins of Russian Roulette and plays them at once.\n\nThe moment you invent time travel you fork a possible universe off, do your messy business, destroy everything and the only possible universe that still exists is the one where you didn't.\n\nIn any universes where time travel is invented the world is destroyed instantly. The fact that our world still exists can be taken as proof that we're on one of the few possible timelines where time travel doesn't, will not or cannot exist.\n\n@chrisj hit on the grand problem of time travel: you have to travel in time and space. I'd love to expand on all the ways this ties time travel to space travel.\n\nThe surface of the Earth is rotating at 0 to 465 m/s depending on your latitude. Fortunately momentum will be conserved (it must otherwise that would imply there is an absolute rest state for the universe) so when you jump you will also be traveling at that speed. However you'll be somewhere else. Even jumping 1 second back will place you 465 meters away... possibly in a brick wall. This is the least of your problems, because this assumes the Earth is standing still.\n\nThe Earth is moving around the Sun at about 30,000 m/s. Now if you jump back in time 1 second you'll be 30km away from where you started, probably either 30km inside the Earth or 30km in the air. Not good, but with some careful calculations you could construct a plane or spaceship or something? And if you want to jump back years you just make sure to jump when the Earth is in the same spot in its orbit. I have bad news.\n\nThe Solar System is rotating around the center of the galaxy at 220,000 m/s taking the Earth with it. Now if you jump back one second you'll be somewhere between 240 km and 200 km away from where you jumped, depending on which way the Earth was moving in its orbit. That's bad, but a spaceship can still fix that, right?\n\nLet's say time travel is invented in 2216 and they want to come back to 2016 to tell us all about it! In that time the Solar System will have moved...\n\n220km/s x 60 s/m x 60 m/h x 24 h/d x 365.25 d/y x 200 years\n\n1,388,534,400,000 km or 1.4 trillion km or 1.4 x 10^12 km or 0.147 light years.\n\nThat's ok, your time machine is also a spaceship! You can fly back to the Earth. And you're in front of the Earth, so it will catch up to you! Well, I have some more bad news.\n\nYou came out in front of the 2016 Earth, yes, but you are continuing to move at 220 km/s around the center of the galaxy in the same direction as the 2016 Earth (the difference in angle is so slight it does not matter for rough calculations). The Earth will never catch up to you. You're going to have to fly all 0.147 ly back to the Earth.\n\nWhat if you went even further back in time to give yourself more time to travel back to the Earth... now you pop out even further away from the Earth and have to travel even further to get back to it...\n\nBasically your time machine also needs to be an interstellar space ship. Maybe time travelers have visited us.\n\nP.S. There is a version of time travel where this is not a problem. Instead of jumping from one point in time to another, you instead speed up time. Now you are passing through every point in time. This means you are subject to the forces of gravity and held in place on the Earth.\n\nH.G. Wells' The Time Machine and the time machine in Futurama seem to work this way.\n\nOption 1: Time travel is a one-time deal\n\nLet's suppose time travel allows you meaningfully alter the past. By jumping back in time you're erasing the future you came from, leading to the good old fashioned grandfather paradox. Let's just sidestep that - You're physically in the past, so let's just assume you're now part of the past.\n\nKill Hitler, save Lenin and Franz Ferdinand, do whatever you want. You've now altered the time-stream such that the invention of time travel most likely happens at a different moment, if it happens at all. If the new inventors of time travel jump back the same thing will happen, either erasing you if they jumped earlier or erasing their own discovery if they jumped in after you.\n\nIf one of these jumps alters the timeline so that time travel isn't discovered, then it'll stay that way forever. If anyone from anytime can travel to any point in the past, then there's effectively an infinite chance this has happened. In the same way that people say it's statistically certain we live in a simulation, I say it's statistically certain we live in a universe were time-travel was permanently un-invented.\n\nOption 2: Time travel is for forensics and archaeology\n\nMaybe time travel doesn't even send you back in time - Maybe it just lets you see the past exactly as it was, like a kind of reverse Minority Report. I don't really have much to say about this one - It avoids all the problems of causality because it's non-interactive, but aside from perfect reconstruction of the past it's pretty dull. Great for documentaries, bad for trying to hunt dinosaurs.\n\nThe one remotely plausible mechanism for time travel is through \"frame dragging\" with a massive rotating object. The purpose built device is known as a \"T machine\" after Frank Tippler, who first proposed it, but it may be possible to have a similar effect using a rapidly rotating neutron star or black hole.\n\nEssentially what happens is the rotating object bends space-time in such a fashion that light cones are \"tipped\" and point to \"elsewhen\", outside of the 45 degree boundary defined by the speed of light. The illustration demonstrates how this is done:\n\nThere are a number of different assumptions you can make (and since no one has a working T machine to test it on, many of these ideas are equally plausible).\n\nNumber one: you cannot go any farther back in time than the creation of the T machine in the first place. Since we are talking about an artificially maintained cylinder of neutronium rotating at nearly the speed of light, this isn't a project that is going to be carried out anytime in the near future (or at least our near future).\n\nNumber two: moving into the past or future creates a new \"timeline\", and this timeline simply sees you start spiralling around the T machine and vanishing, never to return.\n\nNumber three: Since travelling in time is essentially travelling to \"elsewhen\", you have left our universe. This is related to number two, since there is no guarantee that the tipped light cones will actually be pointing back to your starting point. Even in the unlikely event that your light cone is pointed back to our universe, it might not be pointed back to our region of space, or to our current time. Popping back in existence in our universe one billion years in the future or one billion light years away has some obvious problems for the time traveller.\n\nFinally, most of these ideas are based on the assumption that you can equally access the T machine after travelling through to \"otherwhen\". Passing through the field of tipped light cones and emerging in an empty universe where there is no corresponding T machine is going to be a huge problem.\n\nAn option that has not been mentioned in the main answers (only found in the last one by colmde, when I thought it would not have been raised) is that such time travel discovered in the far distant future may not allow to travel back in time to where we are now. Probably not due to physics laws if it is able to travel back in time, but due to economics.\n\nSo, traveling back a week, is affordable to almost anyone.\n\nTraveling back a month, would be a severe hit to your economy but generally doable.\n\nTraveling back some years is something only governments or big corporations can afford.\n\nTraveling back hundreds of years, you would need the energy of dozens of suns to power your travel machine, thus it is \"impossible\" even though time travel is allowed and routinely performed in this universe.\n\nActually, it is uncommon that it would cost the same to travel back 1 day than 100 years (but I don't know the details of the time machine that is discovered in that distant future). Moreover, the power needed to travel back probably isn't linear to the time traveled but likely quadratical.\n\n1.) It will not be humans as we know them now that develop time travel.\n\nFrom the Sagan Series: The Frontier is Everywhere:\n\nIt will not be we who reach Alpha Centauri and the other nearby stars. It will be a species very like us, but with more of our strengths and fewer of our weaknesses, more confident, farseeing, capable, and prudent.\n\nI think the same concept applies to time travel. We're quickly approaching the singularity and as such, people will either become exceedingly enlightened and abandon much of what once made them such petty creatures or they will cease to exist.\n\nThe \"humans\" (more likely to be cyborgs) of this future will understand the long-reaching effects of their actions and won't want to interfere with the past if it might cause unforeseeable consequences to the future.\n\n2.) Humans of the future have already been wiped out\n\nIt can't be said that humans have passed the Great Filter yet. We're still living in tumultuous times. We still might wipe ourselves out. No humans in the future means no one to come visit us.\n\n3.) Alternate time lines\n\nAs others have mentioned, it may be the case that alternate timelines exist or branch when someone tries to change something in the past. This prevents time paradoxes.\n\n4.) We haven't made any receiving devices yet\n\nAs others have mentioned, it might be the case that time travel requires receiving devices that we haven't developed yet. It's easy to calculate where the Earth will be 200 years from now, so that won't be a problem, but no device to travel to might be.\n\n5.) There might be infinite timelines for time travelers to go to and we're one of the infinite that don't get traveled to\n\nMaybe time travelers can travel to any of an infinite number of time lines. the chances of one landing on our time line is infinitesimal. There are trillions of years for them to travel through and trillions of universes, but maybe only a few time travelers so far. The odds of them showing up during the last 5,000 years of our recorded history out of the trillions of years that our timeline will exist are very slim.\n\nI am going to address the second option on your list, Many Worlds, in more detail. In my opinion, it is the only physically-sound explanation for how time travel could exist while no effects from it would be visible. That said, Many Worlds is itself a bit of physics-woo, so make of it what you will.\n\nThe basic concept of Many Worlds is that for every possible outcome of an event, the universe splits, and both (or however many outcomes are possible) occur.\n\nIt is closely related to the concept of Quantum Immortality, which comes out of the application of Many Worlds to Schrodinger's Cat. In that thought experiment, a cat is left in an undermined state inside a box, either alive or dead. The primary issue is that, if the cat is in an undetermined state, what does the cat perceive before the box is opened? Many Worlds suggests the cat experiences both continued life and death; Quantum Immortality is the suggestion the cat would merely experience continued life, thus becoming immortal.\n\nThis is related to time travel in that it suggests every possible event, no matter how incredibly unlikely, occurs. Considering phenomena such as zero point energy, where probability is the main factor preventing absurd random occurrences (and entropy, the addressing of which is beyond this answer), the word \"possible\" can effectively be removed from that statement: every event occurs.\n\nNow, imagine some time traveler returns from 2222 to now. Let's presume the time machine comes with them, for the sake of discussion. What is the probability that a time machine and a time traveler appears in your front yard in the next hour? It's insanely - nearly impossibly - unlikely. But following certain conditions and making certain assumptions, it is possible for that to happen. Meaning in some universe, it must happen.\n\nNow, there is an issue with this, and it is where the cat returns. From your point of view, the probability of that occurrence is so vanishingly small it is easy to ignore. People and time machines do not just materialize out of thin air. But the probability from the time traveler's point of view is substantially higher. If the trip does not fail and he is not killed in the process, his only option is to appear in your front yard.\n\nIt's worth pointing out this would suggest probability can be \"localized\" to a given person. Again, that's well beyond the point I am making.\n\nBecause of the difference in the probability of outcomes between you and the time traveler, we end up in a case where the time traveler is effectively routed to a specific branch of time where he and his machine popped into being. You and I never experience this because it is so insanely unlikely that just in a pure probabilistic sense, we end up in some other branch of time. However, at least some number of you in other branches of time do see the time traveler. There's just many more of you that do not experience a time traveler appearing in their yard.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out this would mean temporal paradoxes are actually impossible to form, since upon going back in time, the time traveler would be entirely decoupled from their own origins. They effectively just spontaneously came into existence remembering \"their\" future.\n\nSo to summarize all that physics-woo, the Many Worlds interpretation applied to time travel would suggest it is merely very unlikely we end up in the same universe as any given time traveler. It's not impossible, but so insignificantly unlikely we can go about our lives with it never actually happening.\n\nIt's very simple. Time Travel only goes one way. It's called cryogenics and right now it generally has a 100% fatality rate.\n\nThe problem with this question is that it makes a faulty assumption. It assumes time exists. A better approach is to ask oneself, \"What is time?\"\n\nSimply put, time is perception. It's possible to perceive time at an incredible rate. Don't believe me? You're living proof. To something like an idea or concept that stands outside of the universe's perception, the all of reality might happen in an instance. It isn't slow, it just perceives events at a different perception. Another aspect is causality. Humans evolved in a way to create assumptions. We assume a beginning and an end. This instinctively creates a range. Here's another fundamental flaw. The universe isn't a dog or cat. It's timeless and infinite. It's not old, because that would require that it didn't exist at some point. Scientist busy themselves trying desperately to prove a beginning. This is because the other option is infinitely terrifying. The universe is in a way, its own cosmic horror. It defies reason. It is the absents of reason. In short, it's hell.\n\nTime works along the same misconception. If time existed, it would mean that at every point that the universe exists, there is a backup. The problem with this, is that there isn't a place to store something like that. Infinite isn't a number. It's a concept. It's something that isn't big. It just is. Causality is a human construct. If we didn't have memories or our memories were a jumble, time wouldn't be a concept at all.\n\nInstead of thinking of time as something to be traveled, it's more accurate to realize that there is just motion. We build our own time. The universe won't be bent to anything's will. Even something like an elevated idea can't undo an event. When a lightbulb breaks, you can only replace it.\n\nSo in short, time doesn't exist. A lot of people are making a whole lot of money creating a comforting lie. The sooner the elites stop looking for comfort the sooner we can get back to fixing real issues.\n\nP.S. I'm sorry if this seems like a downer. I'm not trying to insult anyone. If this is pure science fiction speculation, then I have missed the point entirely and I apologize.\n\nOk lets first break apart your questions:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\n...would travelers from the future come back to prove it exists?\n\nAnswer 1: Why would they bother, what possible motivation would they have for this. They know it is possible and exists they wouldn't need to prove it to the past.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nSurely, they would bring that technology back in time to let the people of the past use it?\n\nAnswer 2: See Answer 1\n\nNow lets look at your theoretical explanations for why this might not occur:\n\nI have four theoretical explanations so far, can anyone explain them in more detail, or provide other possibilities?\n\nTheory 1:\n\nThe people decided to ban backwards time travel...\n\nResponse: People ban lots of things and still people do those things, so most likely some people would still do that thing.\n\nTheory 2:\n\nThe people in the future went back in time to an alternate past.\n\nResponses: Personally I've always viewed alternate pasts as a hack trope of time travel plots. I comprehend alternate futures, but the past seems rather fixed from the POV of whatever when you are. Besides if this were the case then it doesn't particularly matter.\n\nTheory 3:\n\nThe people come back in time ... then jump forward in time... they return to is different to the one they left.\n\nResponse: This is basically the classic many worlds/alternate timelines trope. Again if their present changes, it is still our relative future so no big deal from our POV.\n\nTheory 4:\n\nThey cannot go back in time ...therefore they can only go forward in time.\n\nResponse: So basically.... they are us. Traveling forward in time and never back.\n\nBut have you considered that perhaps they have and do. Maybe they have been here maybe they have marched up the steps of the white house and declared that they are from the future and presented us with a time machine. Maybe they've created countless paradoxes.\n\nHere is the funny thing about time travel. We do it all the time without thinking about it, albeit in one direction. If we could turn around and go \"the other way\" we would un-perceive things going in reverse. Funny thing about this is that in-fact there is no reason to believe that we are in fact going in the \"right\" direction we may live in a back-wards universe with crazy things happing like, gravity pulling things together, light coming out of stars and and people being \"born\".\n\nNow...if we could jump back or forward in time but then continue forward in time at our normal temporal pace.. ah this would be what we think of as time travel, with that concept, there are basically four primary possibilities I can see.\n\nTime travel is only possible in one direction. Period. (borring)\n\nTime travel is possible (at this point we make an assumption that if time travel is possible it is impossible to avoid all paradoxes)\n\nThere is some mechanism outside of the known universe to prevent paradoxes from forming.\n\nThe universe is always in a state of paradox but because we are in the paradox we are unaware of it\n\nAny universe in which time travel is possible is a universe that will ultimately destroy itself before it exists.\n\nPersonally I like this last option... unfortunately this also means that the first option is also true.\n\nSo the point of all this is that. In a universe where time travel is possible there is no reason to believe that we would know it when we saw it even if it were sitting right in front of us."
