        "text": "No, everyone is dead. His mother worshipped him, but she died when he was scarcely eighteen, and his father before that. His mother is his adored memory. In all the mad scenes which he and his companions, I am afraid, have enacted in the Fontonka house, there is one set of rooms no one has dared to enter--her rooms--and he keeps flowers there, and an ever-burning lamp.\n\nThe Sphinx was smiling its eternal smile. It was two o'clock in the morning. The tourists had returned to Cairo, and only an Arab or two lingered near the boy who held Tamara's camel, and then gradually slunk away; thus, but for Hafis, she was alone-alone with her thoughts and the Sphinx.\n\n\"Prince Milas Lovski,\" Tamara heard an acquaintance say... while one of his friends called him \"Gritzko.\" The name fell pleasantly on her ears - \"Gritzko\"... Why was he such a wretch as to humiliate her so? She felt horribly small. She ought never to have let him speak to her, when viewing the Sphinx. She was being thoroughly punished for her unconventionality now!\n\nWhen the music started, she found herself dancing with a fierce Russian Count in green and silver. He held her tightly, exclaiming how beautifully she danced. They stopped, when quite out of breath, where the screened windows half-hid the poor ladies of the harem who watched the throng from their safe retreat.\n\nThe Count and Tamara bowed. Then a voice said close to her ear, \"May I, too, have the honor of a turn, Madame?\" - and she looked up into the eyes of the Prince.\n\nElinor Sutherland was born in St Helier, Jersey, the younger daughter of Douglas Sutherland (1838–1865), a civil engineer of Scottish descent, and his wife Elinor Saunders (1841–1937).\n\nHer father died when Elinor was two months old and her mother returned to the parental home in Guelph, Ontario, Canada with her two daughters, Lucy Christiana and Elinor.\n\nBack in Canada, Elinor was schooled by her grandmother, Lucy Anne Saunders, in the ways of upper-class society. This early training not only gave her an entrée into aristocratic circles on her return to Europe, but it led to her being considered an authority on style and breeding when she worked in Hollywood in the 1920s.\n\nHer mother remarried a Mr. Kennedy in 1871 and when Elinor was eight years old the family returned to Jersey. When there her schooling continued at home with a succession of governesses.\n\nElinor married Clayton Louis Glyn (1857–1915), a wealthy but spendthrift landowner, on 27 April 1892. The couple had two daughters, Margot and Juliet, but the marriage apparently foundered on mutual incompatibility although the couple remained together.\n\nAs a consequence Elinor had affairs with a succession of British aristocrats and some of her books are supposedly based on her various affairs, such as 'Three Weeks' (1907), allegedly inspired by her affair with Lord Alistair Innes Ker. That affair caused quite a furore and scandalized Edwardian society and one of the scenes in the book had one unnamed poet writing,\n\nWould you like to sin\n\nWith Elinor Glyn\n\nOn a tiger skin?\n\nOr would you prefer\n\nTo err with her\n\nOn some other fur?\n\nShe had began her writing in 1900, starting with a book based on letters to her mother, 'The Visits of Elizabeth'. And thereafter she more or less wrote one book each year to keep the wolf from the door, as her husband was debt-ridden from 1908, and also to keep up her standard of living. After several years of illness her husband died in 1915.\n\nEarly in her writing career she was recognised as one of the pioneers of what could be called erotic fiction, although not by modern-day standards, and she coined the use of the world 'It' to mean at the time sex-appeal and she helped to make Clara Bow a star by the use of the sobriquet for her of 'The It Girl'.\n\nOn the strength of her reputation and success she moved to Hollywood in 1920 and in 1921 was featured as one of the famous personalities in a Ralph Barton cartoon drawn especially for 'Vanity Fair' magazine.\n\nA number of her books were made into films, most notably 'Beyond the Rocks' (1906), which starred Rudolph Valentino and Gloria Swanson, and she was a scriptwriter for the silent movie industry, working for both MGM and Paramount Pictures in the mid-1920s. In addition she also had a brief career as one of the earliest female directors.\n\nIn 1927, by which time she had published 32 novels, she once again appeared in some verse of the day. Songsmith Lorenz Hart immortalised her in his song 'My Heart Stood Still' when he wrote,\n\nI read my Plato\n\nLove, I thought a sin\n\nBut since your kiss\n\nI'm reading missus Glyn!\n\nShe was so universally popular and well-known in the 1920s that she even made a cameo appearance as herself in the 1928 film 'Show People'.\n\nAs well as her novels, she wrote wrote magazine articles for the Hearst Press giving advice on 'how to keep your man' and also giving health and beauty tips. In 1922 she published 'The Elinor Glyn System of Writing', which gives an insight into writing for Hollywood studios and magazine editors.\n\nIn later life she moved to the United Kingdom, settling in London. She wrote over 40 books, the last of which was 'The Third Eye' (1940) and she died in Chelsea on 23 September 1943, being survived by her two daughters.\n\nGerry Wolstenholme\n\nNovember 2010"
