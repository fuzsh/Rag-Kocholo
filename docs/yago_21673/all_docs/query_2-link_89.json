Starting in April 2018, additional information on revenue projection errors and a listing of legislation with significant impacts on federal revenues have been added to the data.\n\nPotential GDP and Underlying Inputs\n\nEstimates, starting in 1949, of potential GDP (the economy’s maximum sustainable output) and its underlying inputs, including the natural rate of unemployment (the rate of unemployment arising from all sources except fluctuations in the overall demand for goods and services), various measures of the labor supply, capital services, and productivity.\n\nBeginning in January 2020, projections of potential GDP and its underlying inputs are included in the supplemental files that contain CBO’s 10-year economic projections. Historical values of those series can be found in the supplemental files that contain historical data and economic projections."
