        "text": "As we celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote, we should also celebrate the major strides women have made in the labor market. Their entry into paid work has been a major factor in America’s prosperity over the past century and a quarter.\n\nDespite this progress, evidence suggests that many women remain unable to achieve their goals. The gap in earnings between women and men, although smaller than it was years ago, is still significant; women continue to be underrepresented in certain industries and occupations; and too many women struggle to combine aspirations for work and family. Further advancement has been hampered by barriers to equal opportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life balance. If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the aging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic growth.\n\nA historical perspective on women in the labor force\n\nIn the early 20th century, most women in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were primarily young and unmarried. In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful workers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the home, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such. Of course, these statistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy beyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included work in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural products, for sale. Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of women by race. African American women were about twice as likely to participate in the labor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to remain in the labor force after marriage.\n\nThe fact that many women left work upon marriage reflected cultural norms, the nature of the work available to them, and legal strictures. The occupational choices of those young women who did work were severely circumscribed. Most women lacked significant education—and women with little education mostly toiled as piece workers in factories or as domestic workers, jobs that were dirty and often unsafe. Educated women were scarce. Fewer than 2 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were enrolled in an institution of higher education, and just one-third of those were women. Such women did not have to perform manual labor, but their choices were likewise constrained.\n\nDespite\n\nthe widespread sentiment\n\nagainst women, particularly\n\nmarried women, working outside the home and with\n\nthe limited opportunities available to them, women did enter\n\nthe labor force in greater numbers over this period, with\n\nparticipation rates\n\nreaching nearly 50 percent for\n\nsingle women by 1930\n\nand nearly 12 percent\n\nfor married women.\n\nThis rise suggests that while the incentive—and in many\n\ncases the imperative—remained for women\n\nto drop out of the labor market at marriage when\n\nthey could rely on their husband’s\n\nincome, mores were changing. Indeed, these years overlapped with\n\nthe so-called first wave\n\nof the women’s movement,\n\nwhen women\n\ncame together to agitate for\n\nchange on a variety of\n\nsocial issues, including\n\nsuffrage\n\nand temperance, and which\n\nculminated in the ratification\n\nof the 19th Amendment in 1920 guaranteeing women\n\nthe right to vote.\n\nBetween\n\nthe 1930s and mid-1970s,\n\nwomen’s participation\n\nin the economy continued to rise,\n\nwith the gains primarily\n\nowing to an increase in work\n\namong married women. By 1970, 50 percent of single women\n\nand 40 percent of married women\n\nwere\n\nparticipating in the labor\n\nforce. Several factors contributed to\n\nthis rise. First, with the advent of mass high school education, graduation rates\n\nrose substantially. At the same time,\n\nnew technologies contributed to\n\nan increased demand for clerical\n\nworkers, and these jobs were\n\nincreasingly taken on by women.\n\nMoreover, because these\n\njobs tended to be cleaner and safer,\n\nthe stigma attached to work for a married\n\nwoman diminished.\n\nAnd while there were still\n\nmarriage\n\nbars that forced women out of the labor force, these formal\n\nbarriers were gradually\n\nremoved over the period\n\nfollowing World\n\nWar II.\n\nOver\n\nthe decades from 1930 to 1970, increasing opportunities also arose for highly educated\n\nwomen. That said, early in that period, most women still expected to have short\n\ncareers, and women were still largely viewed as secondary earners whose husbands’\n\ncareers came first.\n\nAs time\n\nprogressed, attitudes\n\nabout women working\n\nand their employment prospects changed. As women gained experience in the labor\n\nforce, they increasingly saw\n\nthat they could balance work and family.\n\nA new model of the two-income family emerged. Some women began to attend college and graduate\n\nschool with the expectation of working, whether or not they planned\n\nto marry and have families.\n\nBy the 1970s, a dramatic change in women’s work\n\nlives was under way. In the period\n\nafter World War II, many\n\nwomen had not expected that they would spend as much of their adult\n\nlives working as turned out to be\n\nthe case. By contrast, in the 1970s young women more\n\ncommonly expected that\n\nthey would spend a substantial portion of\n\ntheir lives in the\n\nlabor force, and they prepared for it, increasing their\n\neducational attainment\n\nand taking courses and college majors\n\nthat better equipped them for\n\ncareers as opposed to just jobs.\n\nThese changes in attitudes\n\nand expectations were supported by other changes\n\nunder way in society. Workplace\n\nprotections were enhanced through the passage of the Pregnancy\n\nDiscrimination Act in 1978\n\nand the recognition of sexual harassment in the workplace. Access to birth control increased, which\n\nallowed married\n\ncouples\n\ngreater control over the size\n\nof their families and young women the ability to delay marriage\n\nand to plan children\n\naround their educational and work choices. And\n\nin 1974, women gained, for the\n\nfirst time, the right to\n\napply for credit in\n\ntheir own name\n\nwithout\n\na male co-signer.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the labor force participation rate\n\nof prime working-age\n\nwomen—those between the ages of 25 and 54—reached just over\n\n74 percent, compared with roughly 93 percent for prime\n\nworking-age men. By then, the share of women going\n\ninto the traditional fields of teaching, nursing, social work, and clerical work declined,\n\nand more women were becoming\n\ndoctors, lawyers, managers, and professors. As women increased their education and\n\njoined industries and occupations\n\nformerly\n\ndominated\n\nby\n\nmen, the gap in earnings\n\nbetween women\n\nand men\n\nbegan to close significantly.\n\nRemaining challenges and some possible solutions\n\nWe, as a country,\n\nhave reaped great benefits from the\n\nincreasing role that women have played in the economy. But evidence suggests that\n\nbarriers to women’s\n\ncontinued progress remain.\n\nThe participation rate for prime\n\nworking-age women\n\npeaked in the late 1990s and currently stands at about 76 percent. Of course, women,\n\nparticularly those with lower levels\n\nof education, have\n\nbeen affected by the same economic forces that\n\nhave been pushing down participation\n\namong men, including technical\n\nchange and globalization.\n\nHowever,\n\nwomen’s\n\nparticipation plateaued at a level\n\nwell below that of prime working-age men, which stands at about 89 percent. While\n\nsome\n\nmarried women\n\nchoose not to work, the size of\n\nthis disparity should lead us to examine the extent to which\n\nstructural problems, such as a lack of equal opportunity and challenges\n\nto combining work and family, are\n\nholding back women’s advancement.\n\nThe gap in earnings between men\n\nand women\n\nhas narrowed substantially, but\n\nprogress has slowed lately,\n\nand women\n\nworking\n\nfull time still earn\n\nabout 17 percent less\n\nthan men, on average, each week. Even\n\nwhen we compare men\n\nand women\n\nin the same or similar\n\noccupations who appear nearly identical\n\nin background and experience,\n\na gap of about 10 percent typically\n\nremains. As such, we cannot rule out that gender-related\n\nimpediments hold back women,\n\nincluding outright discrimination,\n\nattitudes that reduce women’s success in the workplace, and an\n\nabsence of mentors.\n\nRecent research has shown that although\n\nwomen\n\nnow enter professional schools in numbers nearly equal to men,\n\nthey are still substantially\n\nless likely to reach the\n\nhighest echelons of their\n\nprofessions. Even in\n\nmy own field\n\nof economics, women constitute\n\nonly about one-third of\n\nPh.D. recipients, a number that has barely budged in two decades. This lack\n\nof success in climbing the professional\n\nladder would seem to explain why the wage gap\n\nactually remains largest for\n\nthose at the top of the earnings\n\ndistribution.\n\nOne of\n\nthe primary factors contributing to the failure of these\n\nhighly skilled women\n\nto reach the tops of their\n\nprofessions and earn equal\n\npay is that top jobs in fields\n\nsuch as law and business require\n\nlonger workweeks and penalize taking time\n\noff.\n\nThis would have a disproportionately\n\nlarge effect on women\n\nwho\n\ncontinue to bear the lion’s\n\nshare of domestic and child-rearing responsibilities.\n\nBut\n\nit can be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have\n\nchildren. The very fact that these types of jobs require such long hours likely\n\ndiscourages some women—as well as men—from pursuing these career tracks. Advances\n\nin technology have facilitated greater work-sharing and flexibility in scheduling,\n\nand there are further opportunities in this direction. Economic models also suggest\n\nthat while it can be difficult for any one employer to move to a model with shorter\n\nhours, if many firms were to change their model, they and their workers could all\n\nbe better off.\n\nOf course, most women are not employed in fields that require such long hours or that impose such severe penalties for taking time off. But the difficulty of balancing work and family is a widespread problem. In fact, the recent trend in many occupations is to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work for those with family demands and can make it difficult to schedule childcare. Reforms that encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross-train workers to perform different tasks, or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in exchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs. Another problem is that in most states, childcare is affordable for fewer than half of all families. And just 5 percent of workers with wages in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution have jobs that provide them with paid family leave. This circumstance puts many women in the position of having to choose between caring for a sick family member and keeping their jobs.\n\nThis possibility should inform our own thinking about policies to make it easier for women and men to combine their family and career aspirations. For instance, improving access to affordable and good quality childcare would appear to fit the bill, as it has been shown to support full-time employment. Recently, there also seems to be some momentum for providing families with paid leave at the time of childbirth. The experience in Europe suggests picking policies that do not narrowly target childbirth, but instead can be used to meet a variety of health and caregiving responsibilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States faces a number of longer-term economic challenges, including the aging of the population and the low growth rate of productivity. One recent study estimates that increasing the female participation rate to that of men would raise our gross domestic product by 5 percent. Our workplaces and families, as well as women themselves, would benefit from continued progress. However, a number of factors appear to be holding women back, including the difficulty women currently have in trying to combine their careers with other aspects of their lives, including caregiving. In looking to solutions, we should consider improvements to work environments and policies that benefit not only women, but all workers. Pursuing such a strategy would be in keeping with the story of the rise in women’s involvement in the workforce, which has contributed not only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our country.\n\nThis essay is a revised version of a speech that Janet Yellen, then chair of the Federal Reserve, delivered on May 5, 2017 at the “125 Years of Women at Brown Conference,” sponsored by Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
