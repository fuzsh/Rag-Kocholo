King Vidor, the director of many pace-setting movies beginnning more than half a century ago, died yesterday of a heart ailment at his ranch in the rolling seaside hills of Paso Robles, Calif. He was 88 years old.

Mr. Vidor was a trailblazer and often a rebel, widely respected for his independence, individualism and humanism in a notable directorial career that spanned more than 50 feature movies over 40 years. His hits ranged from ''The Big Parade'' in 1925 and ''The Champ'' in 193l to ''The Citadel'' in 1938 and ''Duel in the Sun'' in 1947.

A year ago, Mr. Vidor, still an energetic man despite increasingly serious heart disease, played a lovable grandfather in the film ''Love & Money.'' Vincent Canby of The New York Times termed Mr. Vidor's performance the best in the movie.

Only last weekend, Mr. Vidor drove to San Simeon, William Randolph Hearst's legendary castle, to appraise movies of the lavish parties the publisher gave there. Some of the collection is expected to be released for a public screening.

Mr. Vidor was accompanied on the trip by Colleen Moore Hargrave, a close friend who, as Colleen Moore, was a popular star of silent pictures and early talkies.

Besides making many commercial movies, Mr. Vidor defied Hollywood conventions by tackling projects regarded as financial folly. ''The Crowd,'' his 1928 silent masterwork realistically depicting average people, was first dismissed by Hollywood cynics as an ''artistic flop'' but eventually it showed a profit.
