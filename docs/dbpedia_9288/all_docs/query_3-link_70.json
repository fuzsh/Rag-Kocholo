This process of transnational mobility is shaped by a complex interplay of economic, infrastructural, cultural, legal, and social factors. This presentation shows that Africa’s player mobility is shaped and informed by the historical context, the globalization of football, and the agency of the players themselves within the broader socio-economic and political landscape. The founding of the Chinese Super League (CSL) in 2004 expanded the lucrative options for African football players who were accustomed to venturing into Europe, Middle East, U.S.A., and Southeast Asia. Since 2006, the CSL has consistently had an average of thirteen or so players from Africa on their team rosters each year. So far, more than 28 African countries have had at least one player in the CSL. The presence of African players has elevated the brand value of the CSL by raising its profile, stadium attendance, and quality of the game. Additionally, the presence of star players in the CSL has helped to enhance global awareness of soccer in China.\n\nKeywords: Transnational mobilities, labor migration, Chinese Super League, African football, globalization, professional football.\n\nAuthor: Yomi Ejikunle\n\nTitle: New Approach to Anti-Apartheid Struggle: Interrogating Nigeria’s Contributions to the 1968 Mexico Olympics Boycott Threat\n\nAbstract: The Mexico Olympics of 1968 has attracted enormous attention of sport researchers and enthusiasts, particularly due to the famous black fist protest of two African American athletes against racism in American sport. The demonstration was so legendary that it overshadowed Africans’ anti-apartheid movement that forced South Africa out of the Olympics for two decades. This research aims to analyze the anti-apartheid struggle at the Mexico games with special focus on Nigeria’s contribution to the movement. Nigeria was expected to assume the leadership of African continent at international events when it gained political independence from colonial rule in 1960. Unfortunately, political mistrust, ethnic tensions and civil war put the country into disarray within its first decade as an independent nation. This paper argues that Nigeria failed to lead Africa in the anti-apartheid movement of 1968 even though the International Olympics Committee (IOC) accorded it the status of a continental leader. The Mexico games coincided with the Nigerian civil war (1967-70) and Nigerian political leaders revered the Olympics games beyond sports gathering but as a platform to diplomatically canvas for military supports against the seceding Biafran region.\n\nAuthor: Denis Waswa\n\nTitle: Rethinking Mau-Mau Ecosophy: The Forest and Black Liberation in Kenya\n\nAbstract: This paper examines (1) the British government’s perception of the Mau-Mau movement, (2) the indigenous struggle for freedom, and (3) the role of the forest in aiding African resistance to racialized violence. Through a literal and critical analysis of Meja Mwangi’s Carcase for Hounds, I explore the racial stereotypes that legitimized colonial violence against the Mau-Mau soldiers in Kenya. Colonialists described Mau-Maus as terrorists, beasts, savages, cannibals, atavistic men of the jungle, and primitive barbarians who deserved death. The above racist colonial language validated violence against the black soldiers in the forest. However, the forest sheltered these ‘undesirable excess elements’ that the colonial regime wanted to eliminate for threatening white supremacy. I argue that while colonialism erased the human identity of the Mau-Maus, the forest reconnects them to their ancestral land and identity. I propose that ‘going back’ to the forest uncovers cultural truths that enhance Kenya’s national rebirth. The Mau-Mau-Forest unity gives the indigenous soldiers the strength to resist, persevere, and remain resilient to the liberation struggle. This return to the forest marks a continuation of racial reparation politics, with the forest as an active actor in the battle. Therefore, I conclude that the Kenyan forest is a site of illuminating racial justice and equality.\n\nAuthor: Catherine Lee Porter\n\nTitle: Web-based approaches to understanding political association in Cold War Central Africa\n\nAbstract: This paper is a multidisciplinary approach to examining policies and greater security conversations in Cold War Congo and across Africa via digital canopies, network analysis, and programming tools. While this is a larger multi-layered approach of a larger project, the paper will address the role of macro and micro trends and how these can complement traditional histories. Much of the history of Cold War has been examined from a binary – from East-West, top-down, or winner-loser. However, the Congo Crisis was a small fragment of what could become a larger analysis of the spatial integration of decolonizing Africa or interlinking a variety of 1950s and 1960s Pan-African digital projects. The paper will examine how leaders in the 1950s- met across borders to highlight meetings, parties, and groupings. It will particularly focus on those which have been previously less historically studied such as the movement and collaboration of those that were fraught underneath that of the national leaders, as well as the varying groupings such as women. The paper will highlight how local networks can be illuminated in a digital spider web that the international community was attracted to during the early independence period.\n\nAuthor: Rume Kpadamrophe\n\nTitle: Chants of Freedom, Acts of Defiance: Women’s Resistance in Timbuktu\n\nAbstract: In the vast expanses of the Sahara, where history and sand intertwine, Abderrahmane Sissako’s film Timbuktu emerges as a visual poem narrating the ordeal of the eponymous city under the grip of jihadists in 2012. Within this dark canvas of occupation, a singular light emanates from the women of Timbuktu, weaving shards of resistance amidst the shadows of fanaticism. Among these women, Zabou, deemed “mad,” emerges as a central figure, embodying an enigmatic form of resistance. Another woman, whipped for singing, transforms the act of suffering into a bold declaration of freedom. Simultaneously, a vendor, defying the dictates of the jihadists, embodies resistance in everyday life. This study will delve into how these women in Timbuktu have chosen unconventional paths to resist, exploring the relevance of the concept of “social non-movements” proposed by the Iranian sociologist Asef Bayat. This concept, describing collective actions of unorganized individuals, offers an innovative perspective for understanding the dynamics of resistance in a context where women are institutionally oppressed by patriarchy.\n\nAuthor: Sandra Joireman\n\nTitle: Property Confiscation in the Zanzibar Revolution\n\nAbstract: Much of the literature on the Zanzibari revolution of 1964 highlights different perspectives and contested views of the events (e.g. Burgess 2002, Barwani et al. 2003, Clayton 1981, Glassmann 2000, Lofchie 1965, Maliyamkono 2000, Loimeier 2006). Attention has been given to the time of politics (zama za siasa) leading to the violence as well as the subsequent coming into power of Karume and the formation of the union between Zanzibar and Tanganyika. There have also been studies following the paths of those who fled the islands of Zanzibar in the aftermath of the revolution, especially people of Asian and Arab descent. Based on an in-depth engagement with the confiscation orders published in the Zanzibar gazettes between 1964 and 1987 this article sets out to introduce this particular dataset and embed it in the wider literature on the Zanzibar revolution and the socialist politics that followed. We conducted oral histories with Omani-Zanzibaris in Oman, accessed archived public records, and used spatial analysis on a dataset we constructed out of the public records. By providing insights on the amount, location, and subjects of confiscations this article illuminates property confiscations during and after the revolution and provides a basis for further inquiry. The article contributes to new understandings of the nature and impact of the Zanzibar Revolution as well as touching on an issue that remains of great importance to those whose families lost property during and after the revolution.\n\nAuthor: Marame Gueye\n\nTitle: A Soul of Small Places: Re-Imagining African Agency and the Role of Male Allies in the Fight Against Gender Violence in Senegal\n\nAbstract: The 2023 Caine Prize was awarded to Mame Bougouma Diene and Whoppa Diallo. This is the first time that the prize is awarded to a duo, and a writer from Senegal. In the short story “A Soul of Small Places,” Diene and Diallo, who in real life are husband and wife, fictionalize Whoppa’s own story of sexual abuse, weaving in local Pulaar lore about a woman who turned into a stone in the aftermath of her rape. This stone frames the narrative about the fictional Whoppa, who turns her assault into a force to save young girls from predators. Diene and Diallo’s literary collaboration offers the possibility to center African ways of knowing and dealing with trauma. It also shows that literature can bring visibility to gender violence in Senegal and serves as a model of how male allies can contribute to fighting gender violence.\n\nAuthor: Edward Tejeda\n\nTitle: The effectiveness of art therapy when treating youth gang members with trauma\n\nAbstract: This research proposal aims to investigate the effectiveness of art therapy as a treatment approach for trauma experienced by youth gang members. The study seeks to explore the potential benefits of art therapy in improving the well-being and mental health outcomes of youth involved in gangs who have experienced trauma. The results of this research are expected to contribute to the existing literature on art therapy and trauma, particularly within the context of youth gang involvement. Findings will provide valuable insights into the potential impact of art therapy as a complementary intervention for youth gang members dealing with trauma. The study’s implications may extend to the development and implementation of more tailored and effective therapeutic interventions for this vulnerable population. As well as, taking a deeper look at different theoretical perspectives that can give clinicians a better insight on how trauma impacts this particular group. It is anticipated that this research will highlight the significance of art therapy in promoting emotional expression, resilience, and recovery among youth involved in gangs. The findings will support the call for further research and investment in art therapy programs targeted at this population, while also underscoring the importance of integrating trauma-informed care approaches within gang rehabilitation efforts. Overall, this research proposal seeks to contribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of art therapy when treating trauma among youth gang members, providing evidence-based recommendations for the improvement of mental health services and interventions for this underserved population.\n\nAuthor: Sara Ghebremicael\n\nTitle: Climate and Conflict Impacts on Food Security – Tigray, Ethiopia\n\nAbstract:\n\nGlobally, more than two billion people experience moderate to severe food insecurity, resulting in malnutrition and negative health outcomes. Agricultural systems are universally dependent on temperature and rainfall, making food security vulnerable to climate change. Vulnerability to food security and climate change are particularly apparent in Ethiopia, where agricultural systems are dominated by rainfed agriculture and traditional farming practices. Exacerbating the threat of climate change in Ethiopia, an armed conflict worked to undermine mitigation and household resilience. The onset of the war on Tigray in November 2020 brought with it a large-scale humanitarian disaster. A man-made blockade and region-wide communications blackout ensued, isolating Tigray from emergency food assistance and medical supplies. The war has also resulted in large-scale agricultural abandonment, with farming populations forcibly displaced and farm animals, irrigation systems, and farm equipment damaged. Agricultural input supply chains and production were immobilized following a military-enforced ban on farming and planting – thus using famine as a strategic weapon of warfare. Conditions of starvation, mass migration, and dependence on external food sources then followed. The population in need of emergency food aid increased from less than one million to over 5.2 million (91% of Tigray) in a 7-month period, from November 2020 to June 2021. With this motivation, this study will use a multi-scale and mixed methods research design to focus on the intersecting issues of conflict and climate change, and their impacts on food security in Tigray, Ethiopia.\n\nAuthor: Alice R. Burmeister\n\nTitle: Strategies for Success: Reconsidering the Impact of Chinese Factory Production of Enamelware and Print Textiles in Northern Nigeria and Niger\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe establishment of Chinese enamelware factories such as the Northern Enamelware Company in Kano, Nigeria in the 1950s, and the more recent Chinese takeover in the 1990s of the Enitex print textile factory in Niamey, Niger, both serve as testimonials to the powerful role of China in the production of popular mass-produced goods in West Africa. Indeed, Chinese-produced enamelware bowls/dishes and printed textiles are arguably some of the most common items found in West African households. This is particularly true for the Hausa people of Northern Nigeria and Niger, who prioritize the ability to acquire large quantities of these items as a way to communicate wealth and social status, as demonstrated by cultural practices such as the elaborate presentation and gifting of these types of items during marriage festivities, and the creation of large houseware displays by married women in their homes.\n\nAlthough local consumer practices and aesthetic preferences for enamelware and print textiles have been noted for many ethnic groups across West Africa, little attention has been paid to the role that local Chinese production strategies may have played in the promotion of particular practices during certain time periods, or how Chinese-owned factories may have depended upon African designers to create unique textile prints or enamelware designs that would appeal to local consumer tastes. This paper will examine the marketing and design strategies found to be in operation at the Northern Enamelware Co. and Enitex factories during my field visits in the late 1990s that suggest a consistent and financially successful model for Chinese factories working within the African context. In reconsidering the important role that China has played both in terms of the production and marketing of these items, in addition to the adherence to local aesthetic preferences in object design, a fuller and more accurate understanding of China’s powerful impact on African material culture practices will hopefully emerge.\n\nAuthor: Taylor Hunkins\n\nTitle: Playful Places: How Maasai Mbili are Making Art for Their Kibera Community\n\nAbstract: Maasai Mbili (M2) has been recognized as an important node within the broader art network in Nairobi—one that moves in between and collaborates with formal and informal spaces including studios, residency spaces, galleries, and museums. In scholarship about the collective, the focus has been on their social and spatial infrastructure—the development of their studio and the educational programing and resources they provide to Kibera. Yet little work has focused on the methods and strategies M2 uses in their creative production or how their art works within the local community. With key artists in the collective interested place-making practices, I argue that M2 utilize play as a spatial and generative practice within their installations and socially engaged creative interventions. This paper will examine a wide breadth of M2 art projects, including their 2D works, public performances, installations, and social interventions. Their emphasis on play (and place-) making offers new social configurations in Kibera, subverting ongoing tensions around land, tenure security, and urban belonging.\n\nAuthor: Rebecca Wolff\n\nTitle: Reconsidering the Uli Aesthetics at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka Through the Lens of the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis paper foregrounds Nigeria as a post-war society, in addition to a post-colonial one, to reposition how we understand Nigerian contemporary art. An unresolved sense of trauma surrounds the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970), and it has been a driving impetus behind significant aspects of a wide range of artistic practices. Artists have used their art to convey the underlying sense of loss the war has caused through the invocation of memory and by providing testimony. As part of a larger book project, this paper examines the artists who studied and taught in the Department of Fine and Applied Arts in the immediate postwar decade, including Uche Okeke, Chike Aniakor, and Obiora Udechukwu. They developed an artistic approach based on uli, a form of body and wall painting practiced by Igbo women, which quickly became the department’s defining aesthetic. I situate this turn towards uli within the context of Nigeria’s post-war reintegration policy. I show how it aligned with the Federal Military Government’s post-war rhetoric of “unity in diversity.” It was a way for artists to celebrate their cultural and regional identity, and remember their wartime past, while asserting themselves as Nigerian once again. At the same time, many artists utilized their uli-based practices to testify to wartime traumatic experiences and their lingering effects on the post-war present. As this paper demonstrates, a study of artwork surrounding the civil war can open Nigerian contemporary art up to discussions of how artists act as witnesses and engage with trauma and memory.\n\nAuthor: Trenton Zylstra and Kelsey Rooney\n\nTitle: Investigations into a mid-20th century Senegalese pirogue and the development of the Senegambian boat-building tradition\n\nAbstract: In the late 1960s, a British adventurer purchased a small fishing boat from Senegal, used it to build a catamaran, and then sailed across the Atlantic to the US. This paper discusses the original construction of the vernacular watercraft, known colloquially in Senegal as a pirogue. This term, broadly applied to numerous local, vernacular watercraft, has been used since the Portuguese encountered the West African shoreline in the 15th century. Watercraft, already critical components of local subsistence and commerce, soon became an integral part of the negotiations between Europeans and Africans. The descendants of these 15th century boats continue to be omnipresent in Senegambian coastal life seen in their dozens and hundreds along the shoreline. By taking a close look at this watercraft, now at the Field Museum, we seek to give insights into the historical changes to the construction and operation of Senegalese watercraft in the mid-20th century. The reaction of Senegambian boatbuilders to the rapidly changing economic circumstances of 20th century Senegal and the Gambia, in particular the rise of peanut exports, exemplifies their adaptability and ingenuity.\n\nAuthor: Liza Malcolm\n\nTitle: Exploring Attitudes Towards COVID-19 Vaccination in Kono District, Sierra Leone\n\nAbstract: As COVID-19 spread rapidly, many communities around the globe anxiously waited for a vaccine to shield themselves and their loved ones. At the early stages of the pandemic, it was widely believed that Africa would be a major source of infection. Vaccinating communities became a major goal among local and global health authorities. However, when the COVID-19 vaccine became available in March 2021 in Sierra Leone, it did not gain traction with local communities. While much literature has focused on access and distribution, a growing number of studies discuss vaccine hesitancy as influencing low vaccine uptake. Shifting attention to understanding the determinants of vaccine hesitancy remains fundamental to increasing vaccination rates, as negative vaccine beliefs might delay or prevent vaccination. The local community perspective is especially important as vaccine behaviors may be more malleable when met with historically and contextually sensitive interventions (Fisayo 2021).\n\nThis study seeks to do this by assessing, through semi-structured qualitative interviews, the vaccine attitudes and experiences of residents of Sierra Leone’s Kono District. Furthermore, in contrast to applying “knowledge-deficit” models of belief, this study draws upon the vaccine anxieties framework (Leach et al. 2022). This framework recognizes that vaccines are “substantially emotional, social, and political devices” (Fisayo 2021). This study’s findings suggest that important bodily, social, and political factors, including fear of side effects and distrust of government, influence people’s COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. It is hoped that this study’s findings will inform future policy and interventions related to vaccine uptake in Africa and globally.\n\nAuthor: Christian Doll\n\nTitle: Small-Scale Money Transfer in Post-War South Sudan\n\nAbstract: With the recent transferral and closure of displaced people’s camps in South Sudan, state actors signaled that the war that began in 2013 was over. But for people who lost whole communities and for whom the camps have been their only stable home, the question of what resettling and rebuilding might mean remains deeply uncertain. Drawing on ongoing collaborative ethnographic research, this paper offers an analysis of the history, context, and work of a locally-run money transfer organization operating at the center of this uncertainty. The organization was founded by South Sudanese development professionals and entrepreneurs to link up and offer financial services to the people most impacted by recent conflict: giving unbanked, displaced, and disconnected communities a means to connect. The small-scale but widely dispersed alternative infrastructure has deliberately operated outside the purview and between the gaps of state-led and humanitarian aid initiatives. Its usage demonstrates how new forms of community, connection, value, and futurity are being conceived of and enacted in the shadow of conflict. Its perseverance suggests the creative ways people adapt to ever-changing (and seemingly impossible) circumstances. Drawing inspiration from Francis Nyamjoh’s notion of “incompleteness” and renewed attention to futurity in African Studies, the paper probes how informal, bottom-up, and socially-driven infrastructures emerge and transform in conflict-impacted contexts across Africa. In putting the views and voices of community members and local practitioners in conversation with postcolonial theory, the paper hopes to generatively contribute to the conference’s discussion of new perspectives, opportunities, and challenges in African Studies.\n\nAuthor: Anmol Sahni\n\nTitle: Metonymical Nations and Synecdochical Families: Writing Back to the Ugandan and East African Self with Metafiction in Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi’s Kintu\n\nAbstract: This article argues that Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi’s novel Kintu localizes narrative tropes from the popular genre of historiographic metafiction to represent political contingencies of gender, sexuality, and nationalism for Ugandan and, by extension, East African readers. In doing so, Kintu, I suggest, both instantiates and augments a novelistic tradition theorized by Ewan Mwangi (in Africa Writes Back to Self), in which African writers use unique rhetorical and aesthetic strategies to address—first and foremost—African publics and peer publications, as opposed to writing back to the erstwhile empires, as has been suggested by Ashcroft et al. in their seminal work The Empire Writes Back. Parsing the self-reflexive scenes in which the family appears in a synecdochical and metonymical relationship to the nation, the first two parts demonstrate that the Kintu family serves as a synecdochical site for state sovereignty, or, as Susan Andrade would describe, that the Kintu family is represented as the “nation writ small” in this intergenerational family saga. While Andrade in The Nation Writ Small contends that the oeuvre of first-generation African women novelists, though neglected, is equally involved in post-independence nationalist debates as the works of their male counterparts, my reading of metafiction in Kintu expands Andrade’s contention to a contemporary context. I thus proffer that recently published novels by African women writers, such as Kintu, are genealogically affiliated with first-generation women writers, insofar as these works continue to be thematically invested in feminist concerns about depicting women’s disillusionment with nationalism as linked to their marginalization and oppression of other sexual minorities. Part three examines Makumbi’s metafictional techniques for speculating on the discourse about the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda. Overall, the article redresses a lacuna in existing scholarship on Kintu by foregrounding the novel’s overlooked thematic triangulation of issues relating to gender, sexuality, and nationalism.\n\nAuthor: Seth Palmer\n\nTitle: ‘They Need to Speak Knou in Public All the Time’: Enregistering Lowly Caste, Marked Racialized Ethnicity, and Transgressive Gender/Sexuality in Antananarivo\n\nAbstract: The knou linguistic register has fostered vibrant social networks of same-sex desiring and gender-variant, male-bodied persons throughout Madagascar, but particularly in the capital city. Its circulation has allowed speakers to reconceptualize their sex/gender and social worldings in their own terms through a shared yet ever changing lexicon. Literature in linguistic anthropology has long emphasized this community-building capacity of argots, registers, and sociolects created and employed by their speakers. While knou fosters a sense of belonging among those who create and employ it, the register also embodies long-standing stigma held against speech styles that diverge from the formal, Official dialect of Malagasy. These include speech styles that are enregistered with lower-class and caste populations, feminine speech, and all dialects associated with ethnicities other than Merina – the dominant ethnic group in the capital. In the context of highly stratified, Christian social life in Antananarivo, knou speakers who are of elite status risk losing face when publicly speaking the register and frequenting the social geographies where it has developed. Underserved, poor speakers bearing transgressive genders and sexualities, who have less social capital to begin with, are more likely to embrace the shame wedded to the lexicon and actively participate in this speech community.\n\nAuthor: Ben Burgen\n\nTitle: Resilience and Opportunity: Building Rural Futures in Senegal River Valley\n\nAbstract: In this paper, I explore how some rural people in the Senegal River Valley are creating viable local futures for themselves and their families. Based on my ethnographic research in a farming town I call Keur Toma, I argue that many households are finding ways to consistently prioritize the continuity of their rural way of life despite persistent challenges ranging from low wages and limited job opportunities to recurrent drought and desertification. This resilient rurality is rooted in deeply embedded cultural ideals and a continuation of long-standing patterns of cooperation and interdependence at the local level. Yet it moves beyond a simple repetition of social and economic traditions because it represents a broad-based attempt to not only adapt to, but also profit from the global economic asymmetries that place people on the periphery and devalue their labor. Under these imbalanced circumstances labor migrants abroad can benefit their family and community at home by maintaining strong social networks and sending regular remittances. Collective living abroad also keeps migrants tightly bound to the social, political, and economic life of their hometown by integrating them into a familiar migrant community focused on the homeland. This hometown-focused disposition is further encouraged by the respect, praise, and encouragement that migrants receive from home. These factors all work together to reinforce the circuits which enable migrants and non-migrants to work together to take advantage of the realities of uneven global economic integration in their efforts to build viable rural futures in the Senegal River Valley.\n\nAuthor: Adamu Danjuma Abubakar\n\nTitle: À la découverte d’une plume inconnue: Achille Sylvestre Ndonaye\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn our time, it is somewhat challenging to find authors from the Central African Republic (CAR) studied, for example, in the Americas and Europe. This is not due to a lack of merit but rather to limited access to local publishing houses. However, thanks to social networks such as Facebook, we have had the privilege of exploring the works of CAR authors in our rapidly changing world, albeit one that is complex and deeply immersed in words aiming to speak truth to power, make it more accountable, and challenge the status quo. It could be conceded that authors of Central African origin are somewhat overshadowed behind the curtain of the many writers in the region, creating the impression that the Central African pen has run dry. In general, literature is often considered the mirror of society. However, without the multiple contributions of “literati” in this field of knowledge, one could not speak today of a supposed mirror. Thus, through this presentation, we will meet Achille, a poet and writer from the Central African Republic.\n\nAuthor: Huijoo Shon and Sora Han\n\nTitle: Reconceiving community development as spatial practice in the realm of environmental justice: The case of grassroots movements in African nations"
