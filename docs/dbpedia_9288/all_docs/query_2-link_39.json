        "text": "Anglesey Abbey hosts an evening of magic and mystery led by Three Times Magic Champion, Matthew Le Mottée\n\nOn the evening of Saturday 13 July, a team of world-class magicians will be performing a series of magic shows inside the National Trust house at Anglesey Abbey.\n\nPrepare for a sophisticated evening of magic, history and illusion as the enchanting halls of Anglesey Abbey’s Jacobean-style country house are filled with wonder.\n\nThroughout the evening, guests will experience immersive performances inside the house, led by Doctor of Magic and Three Times winner of The Magic Circle Close- Up Magician of the Year award, Matthew Le Mottée.\n\nTicketholders will also be able to enjoy exclusive access to the house and gardens from 4.15pm to 9pm, beyond Anglesey Abbey’s usual opening times.\n\nThere will be food and drinks on the lawn, accompanied by The Rose Quartet, a local string quartet from Cambridge.\n\nIn between performances, guests are invited to take a stroll through the Rose Garden, grab a bite to eat and make the most of the summer sunlight, sitting on the lawn in front of the house.\n\nMatthew Le Mottée says, “The ‘Whispers of Wonder’ is the kind of magic experience that I would love to attend myself, and I’m really excited to be able to perform it in the magnificent setting of Anglesey Abbey, near my hometown of Cambridge. There’s nothing else quite like it and I hope people come away with lots to talk about.”\n\nInside the house, there will be three Rooms of Mystery featuring a unique blend of performance, magic, history and illusion.\n\nRoom One – Matthew Le Mottée\n\nThe Master of Mystery. Experience magic demonstrations from the Three Times Magic Champion, featuring modern twists on magic classics taken directly from his award-winning act. Not everything is as it seems…\n\nRoom Two – Scott Penrose\n\nPast president of The Magic Circle, Scott is a magician, historian, and engineer. Watch as he performs magic demonstrations featuring rare, working magic automata, that were famous in the 19th century.\n\nRoom Three – John Conway Find out about the history of magic and mystery. A whistle-stop adventure through the ages of conjuring and mystery arts featuring some lesser-known characters and tales of how their magic has had an impact on the world as we know it.\n\nEach ticket includes access to the three Rooms of Mystery – mini shows with breaks in between – and exclusive access to the gardens at Anglesey Abbey in the evening. As one of the performances will be in the library on the first floor of the house, a discounted, reduced access ticket is available. There are also young people’s tickets on sale.\n\nHead to the Anglesey Abbey website for more details, prices and to book tickets. Please note, there are a limited number of tickets available for this evening, so book early to avoid disappointment. Mystery awaits…"
