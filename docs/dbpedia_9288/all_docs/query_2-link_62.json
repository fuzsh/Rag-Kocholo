The singer-songwriter grew up with small-town roots in Oologah and carried on the tradition when moving to Tulsa.\n\nSince his first guitar at age 14, his love for music has continued to flourish, leading him to write his first debut single in 2019 and rise in national popularity.\n\nThis year, Bryan released his third country album “American Heartbreak” where it ranked No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No. 5 on Billboard’s all-genre Top 200 Albums chart."
