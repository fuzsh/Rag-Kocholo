        "text": "I was born and raised in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, also known as CDA. My parents both went to Coeur d’Alene High School, just like me. My Grandpa built one of the first convenience stores here in town on the downtown main street called Sherman Avenue, as well as one of the first churches. My family maintains deep roots in this little town, and I feel like it was a great place to grow up.\n\nI love writing about my hometown on my little corner of the internet and sharing it with others who have never been. Today I am sharing a Coeur d’Alene travel guide, spilling all the details on how to spend the perfect vacation in downtown Coeur d’Alene. Enjoy!\n\n***UPDATED August 8, 2021***\n\nWhere to Stay Near Downtown?\n\nThe Coeur d’Alene Resort\n\nFirst off, where to stay when you visit? This one is a no-brainer. There really is only one great option as far as hotels go – The Coeur d’Alene Resort. The Coeur d’Alene Resort is the pinnacle of downtown Coeur d’Alene. Sitting right on Coeur d’Alene Lake, your stay will involve delightful views with an unrivaled location—centrally located to everything noteworthy in the downtown area.\n\nThey recently finished a three-year remodel to the entire resort. The resort now sports cozier mattresses, modern designs, and chic furniture pieces in each room. They’ve up-ed their technology game with high-definition television screens and charging stations for all your devices. There are gas fireplaces and remote controlled drapes. From what it was, they’ve made huge improvements for a pleasant and memorable stay for all of their guests. Book your room here.\n\nThere are fun restaurants at the resort that I love dining at when I visit. Beverly’s is great for a fine-dining special occasion type of experience, and don’t miss the gigantic desserts called, “Gooey’s” at Dockside. The ice cream sundaes are Instagram worthy, but I also love the huckleberry cobbler. We love the Whispers Bar for cocktails and late-night appetizers. Don’t forget to hit the shops for some souvenirs like local huckleberry jam or a Coeur d’Alene t-shirt.\n\nThe Roosevelt Inn\n\nIf you can’t stay at the resort, there is another option. The Roosevelt Inn is a beautiful bed and breakfast fairly close to downtown Coeur d’Alene. (About a 2 min drive or a 7 min walk to the downtown area.) Originally built in 1905, it was an old schoolhouse, and is the oldest schoolhouse that is still standing today in the area. It’s a gorgeous historic building with modern amenities to meet your current needs. Every room is named after a teacher that worked at the school or an important person who impacted the school in some way. Some rooms have a view of Coeur d’Alene Lake. Some rooms are pet friendly. The food includes a welcome dish of bread pudding and glass of rosé, breakfast buffet in the morning, and wine, cheese, and baked goods in the afternoon. It’s a fun option to look into. Book your room here.\n\n105 East Wallace Avenue, Coeur d’Alene, ID 83814\n\nAirbnb Options in CDA\n\nWe love staying in Airbnb’s across the country, and even internationally. I think it’s a fun way to see a local living perspective of the area, having a taste of what life would be like there. Coeur d’Alene has several great Airbnb options that are close to the downtown area, completely in walking distance. I wanted to share a couple of my favorites with you.\n\nThis place would be a great option for larger families. It is a 3 bedroom, 4 bath house that sleeps 7 people. It is beautiful on the inside. The best part is the location. It is close to Sanders Beach, Tubbs Hill, and McEuen Park. Pets are welcome. There is a washer and dryer. It might be the perfect fit for your family when you visit Coeur d’Alene.\n\nIf you have an even larger group, I love this place. It is close to The Coeur d’Alene City Park and beach, just a 2 minute walk away. This house sleeps 10 people and is cozy and inviting inside. It has a washer and dryer. It’s located in a quiet neighborhood where you can relax after a long day of exploring downtown.\n\nThis place would be a great pick for a smaller group. It is an apartment on the 3rd floor that has been newly remolded. It is in the perfect location, right next to Sherman Avenue where everything is happening. It’s just a short 5 minute walk to all of the best restaurants and coffee shops downtown. With two bedrooms and two bathrooms, it sleeps 4 people.\n\nNew to Airbnb? Click here.\n\nWhere to Eat in Downtown CDA?\n\nBudget (and a classic) Option – Hudson’s Hamburgers\n\nAnd now to the most important part of your trip to Coeur d’Alene. . . THE FOOD! You might want to checkout my other Coeur d’Alene blog posts for all of my favorite food stops in the area like my post on The Best CDA Restaurants, and my post for The Best CDA Coffee, and my post on The Best CDA Brunch.\n\nMy recommendation for the best budget option in downtown Coeur d’Alene is Hudson’s Hamburgers. It’s been around since 1907. They still make their burgers the same way that they always have. They don’t want to mess with something good. If you go to Hudson’s, I’d say, dine-in. Order a “single cheese with everything on it.” This translates to a single patty cheeseburger with house-made pickles and onions. If you’re extra hungry, just ask for another! Dining in will give you the full Hudson’s experience – sitting at the bar, watching them flip the burgers, listening to the chatter of the locals, applying the spicy ketchup and mustard (you have to try it!). Getting it to-go just isn’t quite the same, but we’ve certainly done it when we want to eat at a nearby park instead. But don’t expect fries here, they don’t have them! More info here.\n\n207 Sherman Avenue, Coeur d’Alene, ID, 83814\n\nCoeur d’Alene Bar Scene\n\nWhispers Lounge\n\nNow for all the details of where to get the best cocktails in Coeur d’Alene. I’ve got you covered. I love Whispers. It is located outdoors, in the back of The Coeur d’Alene Resort behind Dockside. They have heat lamps and fires to warm up near the tables. It is really cozy and inviting and a place you’ll want to stay for a while. Nate and I both loved our cocktails that we ordered. The garlic parmesan popcorn was delicious too and a fun addition to our night. We happened to visit when a group of people were launching floating lanterns up into the sky from the dock as well as fireworks. Can you say magical? More info here.\n\n115 S. 2nd St. #2738, Coeur d’Alene, ID, 83814\n\nThe Boardwalk Bar\n\nThe Boardwalk Bar is open all summer long, weather permitting. The location and views can’t be beat, overlooking Coeur d’Alene Lake. This is a casual place with cocktails and appetizers. You can find a spiked huckleberry lemonade as well as some fun blended tropical drinks, making you feel like you’re on vacation. (While the cocktails are good, the standout here is the location.) This might be a fun place to stop at before or after a long day at the beach. It’s open from noon to dusk everyday. More info here.\n\nNext to the West Entrance of the CDA Resort Floating Boardwalk\n\nLiveForBlu Gallery and Wine Bar\n\nThis wine bar on Sherman is very modern and trendy, showcasing the best wine from the Pacific Northwest. They have the best wine flights in town. Enjoy them while you sit back, relax and gaze upon the beautiful travel photography all around the space. They offer live music on Friday nights. The hospitality and love of wine, art, and travel are what make this place really special. More info here. For more information about all the wine bars in Coeur d’Alene, check out this blog post.\n\n505 Sherman Avenue, Coeur d’Alene, ID, 83814\n\nStudio 107\n\nThis wine bar features some of the best global wine selections that Coeur d’Alene has to offer. Trish and Tom do a great job selecting quality wines that show off the terrior of where they are from. You can buy wine by the glass or by the bottle, and I promise that whatever you choose, you’ll be pleased. Really great wine here. Studio 107 also sells local art and jewelry. They do live music on Friday nights. More info here.\n\n503 Sherman Avenue, Coeur d’Alene, ID, 83814\n\nIron Horse and Crickets\n\nWhile Iron Horse and Crickets are personally not my cup of tea, many people enjoy them. Iron Horse is always hoppin’ on the weekends, and has been since 1972. It’s definitely the busiest bar in town. They are proud of the fact that they, “always get people the drunkest.” You’re bound to meet some fun people when you go and have a memorable evening. More info here. Crickets is another place that’s been around forever and is popular with the younger crowd. They proudly serve oysters on their menu. It’s always busy, especially on the weekends. More info here. While both of these places seem mediocre as far as food goes, they are a fun place to stop for a good time on the weekend with your friends.\n\nIron Horse- 407 E. Sherman Avenue, Coeur d’Alene, ID, 83814\n\nCrickets- 424 E. Sherman Avenue, Coeur d’Alene, ID, 83814\n\nThe Crown and Thistle Pub\n\nMy husband and I lived in London for a year when we were first married. The Crown and Thistle reminds me of our days spent in London. It’s a cute little British pub offering all the British food and drinks that you could want. It makes you feel like you stepped into England for the day, and I love it. They have fish n’ chips, bangers and mash, a full English breakfast, and all the English draft ales on tap that you could want. More info here.\n\n107 N. 4th St.\n\nOutdoor CDA Activities –\n\nHike Tubbs Hill\n\nYou can’t go to Coeur d’Alene and not hike Tubbs Hill. Tubbs Hill is an easy 2.5 mile hike good for all skill levels. The entrance to the hike is to the left of The Buoy Lakeside Restaurant and just east of the resort. (This restaurant is great for drinks and a view, but I’d say grab lunch elsewhere unless you’re in a pinch.) Hiking Tubbs Hill is a fun family activity. There is a main trail that is easy to follow. There are smaller trails that take you down to the lake or further up the mountain. There are a few little beaches that can be fun to swim at or visit and put your feet in the water. If you’re looking for an adventure, many people jump off the rocks into the lake. There are some smaller jumps and some pretty good size ones. Not all cliffs are suitable, and you should be very careful before you jump. If you don’t hike Tubbs Hills for anything else, hike it for the great views of Coeur d’Alene Lake. You can’t get much prettier than this.\n\nThe trail does not return to the starting point. Many people turn around and come back the way they came. However, if you want to finish the trail, it’s easy to make it back to where you started. The other end of the trail is by Sanders Beach and the 11th Street Boat Marina. If you continue to walk west, through the neighborhood a bit, you will land right at The Coeur d’Alene Public Library, McEuen Park, the dog park, and if you walk through the grassy field, you will be right back to where you started again, the beginning of Tubbs Hill.\n\n208 S. 3rd St. Coeur d’Alene, ID 83814\n\nRent a Boat on Coeur d’Alene Lake\n\nIt seems like the main reason people visit Coeur d’Alene is to play on the lake. The best way to play on the lake is by going boating. I grew up having a boat and going on friends’ and neighbors’ boats. It’s always a good time. If you come to Coeur d’Alene with your own boat, great! But if you don’t own one but would still like to go boating while your’e in town, look into renting one. There are two options that I recommend for renting a boat on Coeur d’Alene Lake. The first is KJ Water Sports. They offer a variety of ski/wake boat rentals, pontoon boat rentals, jet ski rentals, and they are very professional and easy to work with. Secondly, Resort Boat Rentals through The Coeur d’Alene Resort is another great option. If you’re staying at the resort, this might be an easy option because they are located on the floating boardwalk. They offer Cobalt Sports Boats, pontoon boats, jet skis, and paddle boards.\n\nRent a Jet Ski on Coeur d’Alene Lake\n\nFor jet ski rentals, I’d recommend checking out Jet Ski Island. Their prices are affordable and the owner is really friendly and great to work with. He has a floating business near the CDA marina with jet skis tied to the side. It’s first come first served, so call the day that you are hoping to go out to see if he has availbility. He will come and pick you up near the CDA City Beach and boat you back to his place on the lake. It’s a fun experience and something that I’d totally recommend on your trip to CDA. The CDA Resort also offers jet ski rentals. More info here.\n\nSwim at the Beaches\n\nCoeur d’Alene City Beach\n\nThe Coeur d’Alene City Beach has a great beach just to the right of The Coeur d’Alene Resort. This is the “it place” to be in the summertime for all ages. Everything is happening here. Many people would argue, this is the beach where the fun is at. Because it’s such a fun place, it can be very crowded, despite the long stretch of beach. The closer you are to the resort, the more crowded it is, and the further you are from the resort, the less crowded it is. Despite the crowds, it’s a fun place to be and spend the day. You can rent water toys like paddle boats from the nearby dock as well as single and double kayaks, and paddle boards. More info about rentals can be found here. There are currently no lifeguards.\n\nThe Dike\n\nFurther away from the resort, closer to North Idaho College, you’ll find, “The Dike.” It is called, “The Dike,” because it is the area that connects the lake with the Spokane River. It’s a place that is more popular with the locals than the tourists, often being full of families who have set up “camp” and are hanging out for the entire day. It is typically less crowded than the Coeur d’Alene City Beach. There are pine trees and signs of nature everywhere, giving it more of a camping type of feel. You’ll see families of ducks swimming by. There are small grills for the public to use for barbecuing. Boats are passing by of people who are done boating for the day and are headed home. Like the Coeur d’Alene City Beach, you can also rent water toys through the North Idaho College. They have kayaks, paddle boards, canoes, and sailboats. More info about rentals can be found here. There are no lifeguards at this beach.\n\nSanders Beach\n\nSanders Beach is popular with the locals, especially the locals who live in the nearby neighborhood. There are two sections of Sanders Beach. The first area closest to the 11th Street Marina is a pretty small space but closest to downtown and the end of the Tubbs Hill hike. If you head east, you’ll find some private beaches. If you keep heading east, there is another stretch of public beach that is much larger than the first. For either, park along the street and walk down. Sanders Beach as a whole is often less crowded than the beaches closer to the resort. (However recently it seem to be getting more busy.) The lake water at Sanders seems to be cleaner and clearer than other parts of the lake because less people are in it. The downside of Sanders is that the sand is full of sticks, rocks, pine needles and sometimes, unfortunately, pieces of glass. Despite this, it’s still a great place to spend the day, and it definitely has its perks.\n\n(Pro tip: Pick up burgers and milkshakes nearby from Roger’s Ice Cream & Burgers, 1224 Sherman Ave, Coeur d’Alene, ID 83814, and eat at the beach.)\n\nGo Parasailing\n\nAt the Coeur d’Alene City Beach area, there is another fun option to do on the water – parasailing at Coeur d’Alene Parasail. You launch and land right from the boat, riding alone or with a friend. I went on my 17th birthday and again in my 20’s, and it was really fun both times. The recommended age is 4 and up. Make a reservation online before you go. You don’t even have to get wet if you don’t want to. The views are incredible, and I’d say it’s worth every penny.

I grew up playing here in this gorgeous outdoor space with the giant trees and lush grass. When I was 10 years old or so, the old playground’s rickety equipment was removed and the community came together to build this wooden playground structure. My dad helped build it, and my mom helped prepare lunch for the people who were volunteering. It was a memorable time for me as a child. Now, I enjoy taking my son, Jimmy, here to play.\n\nBesides this playground area, this is a great park for your kids to go and run around. We like to play outdoor games here like hide-and-seek and tag. Volleyball nets are often set up for a fun game with friends. The basketball area is a good size with several different courts. There are picnic tables sprinkled throughout, so we often pack a picnic lunch beforehand and make a day out of it. There is a gazebo area too with grills, but if you don’t get there first you’ll miss out. It’s a popular little place for families and seems to always be occupied."
