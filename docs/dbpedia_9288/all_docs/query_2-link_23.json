        "text": "Baltimore‚Äôs claim-to-fame may be that it was the birthplace of America‚Äôs National Anthem, ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner,‚Äù but it's determined, down-to-earth spirit makes it a truly American city. With a dynamic Inner Harbor ‚Äì the best view of which is from atop Federal Hill ‚Äì that was as busy in the 18th Century as it is today. However, there are few things more quintessentially Baltimore than Maryland blue crabs. (The name comes from the color of their claws, but once cooked they turn a red-orange.) And while they can be found in the waters along the entire East Coast, Marylanders have perfected the art of eating them. In fact, more than a third of the country‚Äôs blue crab comes from the Chesapeake Bay! Baltimore has an exceptionally proud reputation for it's seafood and the Maryland blue crab served in many ways, leads the way! First Call opened our Baltimore, MD field office in May of 2015 and has performed hundreds of calls throughout DC, Maryland, and Virginia. As First Call continues to grow and expand, we have moved our Baltimore field office so that we can better serve our customers. Please make note of our new address and let Team Baltimore be your trusted resource in the Maryland, DC, and Virginia area when you need help the most! 512 Shaw Court, Suite 104, Severn, MD 21144 #SpillLife #FirstCallDifference #SpillNinja #FirstCallNation #environmentalcleanup #environmental #FirstCallCares #FirstCallFam #getbettereveryday #FCE #GBED #werehiring\n\nIn editions of the movie #BACKTOTHEFUTURE that I saw, Biff is the character who is not good. The letter, \"i,\" sometimes sounds like a long, \"e,\" saying its name. Biff pronounced with that sound of that vowel makes Biff sound like, \"beef.\" Rural small town areas that raise alot of cattle for beef (& milk) were known to be very prejudiced & still are. Thus, those movies were actually a warning to not let prejudiced people & areas have any control over anyone (& especially those who have #TOPAUTHORITY like me because then those prejudice ones will control me to control the future of mankind with a result that will not be good). In the version where Biff gets control over the future by knowing what will happen in advance then betting on future events, Biff wins riches that give Biff influence over the future, resulting in a gross lack of security in a neighborhood once safe & prosperous. Biff's wife's name in that version is, \"Lorraine,\" which sounds very similar to my name Laurah. The end of the name Lorraine sounds like the word rain because it means all must cooperate with me ordering rain & other elements & the lack thereof of those to regain control for the USA over Biff (the no good white supremacist KKK). Here is a screenshot of #GOOGLEEARTH 's view via satellite of a church at 1122 Sunset Blvd. (Hist. Rt. 66) here in Los Angeles, CA, USA down the street from the Edendale Echo Park Library at 2011 Sunset Blvd. (Hist. Rt. 66). The church in this photo screenshot online has grafitti all over it. There is more than is visible in this angle. I was at this big church the other day & it looks vacant, also. Numerous buildings look like this as a result of my need of much greater cooperation from my fellow government to cooperate with my orders cheerfully, immediately, & completely without going backwards afterwards. So, everyone really needs to cooperate with me. When I arrived back in L. A., I wanted my fellow gov. from other areas blocked from me & the area I went to (L. A. County). When that did not happen, looked at how the neighborhood declined within 13 months. In Washington DC they were very good in striking people with lightening & huge lightening storms everytime anyone sex harassed me (even in a very subtle, small innuendo way). That helped. You are supposed to do that lightening counter attack also for anything against me even in the smallest attack from an eye roll to huge attacks like trying to get me in trouble & even for pretending I can be in trouble when I can't because I have CIA immunity always really as an irrevocable fellow #TOPLEVELCIA order regarding me. The lightening helped USA President Biden & me alot at the White House in 2022. That's good.\n\nGreat things are happening. We are fighting for #landback from the horrors of urban renewal; to folks that look like me, we call it black removal. Thank you Carol Z. & Saul Young for this beautiful photo and write up in the Shopper News. üìé: https://lnkd.in/eAsyaiZK A few weeks ago, we held a community ribbon cutting for Payne Ave. Baptist Church Community Garden as it sits on the historical black property. 36 beds were adopted with an ask of 64 more as we will have installed 100 beds to kickoff the next growing season. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ We are recreating our own food system that works for the community, led by the community. Creating an equitable and just food system in Knoxville with our first stop being East Knoxville. I‚Äôve been letting some of the dust settle but I‚Äôm pleased to announced I‚Äôm the Chief Operating Officer for the Knox County Community Gardens & Growers Alliance as @battlefieldfarm being Executive Director. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ To the East Knoxville community: thank you for being so willing to join us in this fight. You all have showed up and out being SO eager to learn how to grow your own produce and herbs. I encourage members of the community to adopt at least (1) garden bed for your family to increase your accessibility to fresh living foods. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Also, CB has started another community garden behind Holiday Market on the Eastside called the Concrete Garden. It‚Äôs so beautiful and vibrant already with 30 beds. Located at 107 S Chesnut St. My call to action for my followers here: 1. Join the food movement. -you can learn to become a master gardener -join food policy council -become a free member of the garden alliance 2. Volunteer -offer you hands to serve -offer your expertise We are operating in abundance, not lack. Fortifying this resilient community. Moving from surviving to thriving. Sowing seeds of resistance. #foodapartheid #growfoodnotlawns #foodrevolution #oppressivefoodsystems #dismantlethesystem #foodjustice #redlining #foodswamp #thecoloroflaw #fooddisparities #community #foodmovement #thefoodfighters #powertothepeople #restoration #foodiscurrency"
