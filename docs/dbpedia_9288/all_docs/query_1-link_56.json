        "text": "You might know Chicago as the birthplace of the skyscraper, the home of deep dish pizza, or as one of the largest urban cities in the country. But you might not know that we’re home to miles and miles of sandy shoreline, where you can swim, bike, kayak, boat, jet ski, paddle board, sip cocktails on the waterfront, and more.\n\nChicago’s 26 miles of scenic lakefront includes numerous public parks and gardens, an 18-mile Lakefront Trail — and more than two dozen free beaches that open to the public every summer in Chicago. Here are a few spots you can kick back and soak in the sun at Chicago’s beautiful beaches.\n\nFind Chicago beaches by activities:\n\nChicago beaches with waterfront dining\n\nChicago beaches with outdoor recreation\n\nChicago beaches near museums and attractions\n\nNorth Avenue Beach\n\nNorth Avenue Beach is one of Chicago’s most popular beaches with locals and visitors alike, thanks to its spacious sands, cool beachfront bars, and convenient location near other top attractions (like the nearby Lincoln Park Zoo).\n\nWhat to do: Ready to work up a sweat? North Avenue Beach offers tons of recreation options. Get out on the water with a paddleboard or kayak or a Jet Ski. You can also rent bikes and cruise down the Lakefront Trail, take a beachfront yoga class, play beach volleyball, or just kick back in the sand and soak in the sun and skyline views.\n\nWhere to eat: The first thing you’ll notice about North Avenue Beach is the sleek ocean liner-inspired beach house. The top deck is home to Castaways, a casual bar and grill that boasts some stunning views of the city. Also right on the beach, Shore Club offers a more upscale experience. Sip cocktails with your toes in the sand or reserve a private cabana with personalized bottle service.\n\nExplore more: Dine with a view at these waterfront restaurants and bars.\n\nOak Street Beach\n\nIts close proximity to downtown and The Magnificent Mile makes Oak Street Beach an easy (and scenic) pit stop. That also means you’ll get an up-close view of some iconic Chicago buildings, like 875 N. Michigan Ave. and historic The Drake Hotel.\n\nWhat to do: On the beach, you’ll find bike rentals, chair rentals, volleyball courts, and plenty of space to swim and spread out in the sand.

The quieter atmosphere, ample green space, and a playground make it a family favorite. Nearby, the Glenwood Avenue Arts District in the Rogers Park neighborhood offers vibrant murals, music venues, theaters, art galleries, and a mix of shops and restaurants.\n\nWhat to do: Around the beach, you’ll find Divvy bike rentals, sand volleyball courts, a natural area, and plenty of space to swim and spread out in the sand.

Burroughs Beach) is the place to be. The beach itself is located within Burnham Park, originally envisioned by legendary Chicago architect Daniel Burnham (best known for designing the 1893 World’s Fair), and features sweeping skyline views.\n\nWhat to do: Head to the 31st Street Harbor to find Chicago Water Sports Rentals, where you can rent Jet Skis, pontoon boats, kayaks, and paddleboards.\n\nWhat to eat: Pier 31is a beachside bar and grill featuring a walk-up window and plenty of outdoor seating.\n\nHollywood Beach\n\nLocated in Edgewater, this beach is officially named Kathy Osterman Beach — though the locals just call it Hollywood Beach for its proximity to Hollywood Avenue. The beach is also a beloved part of the city’s thriving LGBTQ+ scene.\n\nWhat to do: The calm waters and lack of boat traffic make it a popular spot with paddleboarders. Near the beach, there’s a playground and dog park, a natural area popular with migratory birds, and the northernmost point of the 18-mile Lakefront Trail.\n\nWhat to eat: Aura on Osterman Beach is a casual beachfront bar by popular neighborhood restaurant Uvae Kitchen & Wine Bar.\n\n12th Street Beach\n\nThis unique beach is situated on the eastern edge of Northerly Island, a man-made peninsula that stretches along the lakefront.

Montrose Beach offers one of the only official dog beaches in the city, with a fenced-off section on the northern end of beach where pups can swim and run free without a leash. It’s also the largest beach in Chicago, which means there’s plenty of room for humans too.\n\nWhat to do: Montrose Beach is a popular place for families, who set up umbrellas on the spacious sands or grill out in the grassy area just beyond the beach’s edge. Montrose Beach also includes a natural area that attracts migratory birds during the fall and spring seasons.

The lakefront area was first established in 1908 and was originally known as Rocky Ledge Beach due to the rough terrain. The beach was extremely popular in the early 1900s since rare electric lighting allowed local workers to enjoy the beach at night. An expansion in 1918 connected Rocky Ledge with another nearby beach, creating the sandy shores of modern-day Rainbow Beach.\n\nWhat to do: Today, the area is home to sweeping skyline views, a gymnasium, a fitness center, and multipurpose rooms, handball courts, two playgrounds, and one of the oldest community gardens in Chicago.\n\n57th Street Beach\n\nTucked in the Hyde Park neighborhood, fewer crowds make 57th Street Beach an ideal spot for picnicking or building sandcastles.
