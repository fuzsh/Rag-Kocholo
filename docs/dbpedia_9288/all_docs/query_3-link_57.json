The infinity pool sparkles; crystal pouches for guests’ healing have been placed in the Seaside Cottages and Woodland Hutches; the “Manor Mule” cocktail (grapefruit, ginger, vodka, and a dash of CBD oil) is being poured with a heavy hand. Everyone is wearing linen. And yet, outside The Manor’s immaculately kept grounds, and ancient forest bristles with secrets. The local community resents what they see as the Manor’s intrusion into the local woods and attempts to privatize the beach, and small skirmishes have erupted on the edges of the property between locals and the staff. And the whispers keep coming, about an old piece of pagan folklore–it must be folklore–the Night Birds, an avenging force that can be called upon to make right wrongs that elude the law. Though surely everything at the Manor has been done aboveboard. On the Sunday morning of opening weekend, the local police are called. There’s been a fire. A body’s been discovered. Something’s not right with the guests. What happened on the grounds of the Manor the past 36 hours? And who–or what–is the cause? Everyone has an agenda. Everyone has a past. But not everyone will survive…The Midnight Feast.’\n\nIf you have questions or need assistance, please call us at 978-399-2300 or send us an email at westfordlibrary@westfordma.gov.\n\nQuick Links to Our Most Popular Services!\n\nPrograms – Adults\n\nPrograms – Kids\n\nPrograms – Young Adults\n\nIf you have questions or need assistance, please call us at 978-399-2300 or send us an email at westfordlibrary@westfordma.gov\n\nFollow us!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/westfordlibraryma/\n\nhttps://X.com/westfordlibrary\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/J-V-Fletcher-Library-131093656901445/\n\nDisclaimer: Submitted content does not necessarily represent the opinions or views of WestfordCAT, its employees, its volunteers, its board members, its donors, its members or its sponsors.\n\nWestfordCAT News shares newsletters, press releases and member submissions at the discretion of the editor.
