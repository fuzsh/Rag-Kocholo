        "text": "In the hazy glow of Appalachia, where the rolling hills echo with the twang of guitars and the whispers of tales spun over campfires, emerges Ben Fugate, a bard of the backwoods. With a voice steeped in the rich tradition of country crooners and a spirit as untamed as the rolling hills of Kentucky, Fugate epitomizes the essence of honky-tonk authenticity.\n\nFugate's latest endeavor, the eponymous EP with The Burning Trash Band, is a testament to his evolution as an artist. Released under the Louisville-based sonaBLAST! Records, the album is a departure from his humble beginnings in Hazard, Kentucky. \"Dream Song #1,\" the EP's lead single, sets the stage for a musical journey that traverses the heartland of America's musical heritage.\n\nReflecting on his musical odyssey, Fugate reminisces about his early days, honing his craft in the garage with nothing but a single microphone. Yet, it was in those formative moments that his passion for music took root, nurtured by the rugged landscape of Southeastern Kentucky and the echoes of gospel hymns reverberating through Pentecostal churches.\n\nHis ascent to prominence was marked by a serendipitous encounter with Gill Holland, the visionary behind sonaBLAST! Records. Recognizing Fugate's raw talent, Holland extended an invitation to Louisville's La La Land recording studio, where Fugate's self-penned ballads were transmuted into sonic gems.\n\nHowever, Fugate's journey isn't merely about musical accolades; it's a testament to the enduring spirit of Appalachia. Proudly hailing from Hazard, he remains deeply rooted in his hometown's ethos, a sentiment reflected in his decision to host release shows in Louisville, Harlan, and Hazard itself. For Fugate, these performances aren't just concerts; they're a homecoming, a celebration of the community that shaped him.\n\nThe EP's tracklisting reads like a love letter to the bluegrass state, with songs like \"County Fuzz\" and \"Lovesick Over You\" evoking the sights and sounds of rural America. Collaborating with fellow songwriter Kevin Howard and drawing inspiration from country legends like Joe Diffie and Keith Whitley, Fugate weaves a tapestry of sound that's as authentic as it is evocative.\n\nYet, Fugate's musical journey is incomplete without mentioning The Burning Trash Band, his steadfast companions on this odyssey. Comprising seasoned veterans of the music scene, the band's tight guitar work and clock-like rhythm section provide the perfect backdrop for Fugate's soulful vocals.\n\nAs Fugate gears up for a series of promotional appearances and release shows, his gaze remains fixed on the horizon, where the promise of new melodies and untold stories beckon. With each strum of the guitar and every heartfelt lyric, he inches closer to realizing his vision of country music—a vision that's as timeless as the Appalachian mountains themselves.\n\nIn a world where trends wax and wane like the phases of the moon, Ben Fugate stands as a beacon of authenticity—a reminder of the enduring power of music to transcend boundaries and unite hearts. As his journey continues to unfold, one thing remains certain: Hazard's honky-tonk hero is just getting started.\n\nOut Now: \"Dream Song #1\" From Eastern Kentucky’s Ben Fugate & The Burning Trash Band, Off Forthcoming New Self-Titled EP, Due Out April 12 On sonaBLAST! Records\n\nTUNE-IN: Live appearance on WAVE Country with Dawn Gee set for April 11\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (February 09, 2024) - Honky-tonk country traditionalist and Appalachian singer-songwriter Ben Fugate & The Burning Trash Band released the first single, “Dream Song #1,” today off their new eight song self-titled EP [Pre-save/Pre-add] from Louisville-based sonaBLAST! Records, due out on Friday, April 12.\n\n\"This album is a big departure from my garage days with just one mic,” said Fugate. “We aimed to reflect our unique sound, while drawing inspiration from country legends, and I believe we've captured that essence!\"\n\nProudly hailing from Hazard, Kentucky, Fugate first began amassing a sizable following on his Tik Tok channel in 2020 by just simply singing a number of classic country and southern rock song favorites, along with a few of his originals. In 2021 Fugate released his debut EP by Sonder House, Pronounced Appa-Latch-Uh, where the title track has garnered more than 100,000 spins on Spotify, firmly solidifying a growing interest among his listeners and fans.\n\nRecord release shows planned throughout Kentucky in Louisville, Hazard & Harlan:\n\nFugate and his band will celebrate the release of the new EP with a series of shows in Kentucky.

The following week they’ll perform on April 20 at Harlan County Beer Company (120 E. Central St., Harlan). Admission is Free and open to the public for these events.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to host these release shows in my hometown, Harlan and Louisville,” Fugate said. “Both Hazard and Louisville have been pivotal in our success, so it feels only fitting to bring the celebration to where it all began for us!”\n\nTracklisting & Songwriters:\n\n1. “Dream Song #1” (Ben Fugate, Kevin Howard)\n\n2. “Til’ Death Do Us Part” (Ben Fugate)\n\n3. “County Fuzz” (Ben Fugate, Kevin Howard)\n\n4. “Take Your Love” (Ben Fugate)\n\n5. “Lovesick Over You” (Ben Fugate)\n\n6. “Impossible” (Ben Fugate)\n\n7. “Tick’s Blues” (Derek Mullins)\n\n8. “Dream Song #2” (Ben Fugate, Kevin Howard)"
