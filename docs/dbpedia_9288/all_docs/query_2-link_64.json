        "text": "Nicholas Caldwell, a founding member of ‘80s R&B group The Whispers, has died. According to The Associated Press, the 71-year-old died of congestive heart failure on Tuesday at his home in San Francisco.\n\nA popular concert draw for more than 50 years thanks to such hits as “And the Beat Goes On” and “Rock Steady,” the Whispers most recently played in Los Angeles — its hometown — at the Microsoft Theater on Dec. 19, 2015, with Stephanie Mills and The Temptations Review, featuring Dennis Edwards. Caldwell, along with twin brothers Wallace and Walter Scott, Gordy Harmon and Marcus Hutson, established the group in the early ‘60s. Harmon was later replaced by Leavil Degree; Hutson died in 2000.\n\nGone But Not Forgotten: Music Stars In Memoriam\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nIn addition to contributing vocals, Caldwell—described by friends and fans as a “gentle giant”— doubled as the group’s choreographer and penned songs as well. Known for its trademark silky smooth harmonies, the Whispers scored its first R&B hit in 1970 with the No. 6-charting “Seems Like I Gotta Do Wrong.”"
