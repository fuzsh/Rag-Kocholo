        "text": "March 8, 2022\n\nTwenty Two years ago, Anna and Grace were the BEST of friends-more like sisters- until Grace and her family relocated from the UK to Australia.\n\nSo when Grace’s dad passes away, and her marriage to Graham becomes so frayed that it might break, returning to Clearwater, seems like it could be the perfect place for a fresh start, and the ideal place to raise her daughter, Matilda.\n\nBut, Anna has a new group of friends.\n\nTight-knit and cliquey, she and the other women, Nancy-Rachel-and Caitlyn-are constantly linking arms, saving seats and whispering amongst themselves on the other side of the playground from the other mums from year four.\n\nDespite her new friends, not warming to Grace, Anna reluctantly invites her to join them at their next “girls night out”-one that Anna won’t return home from. She doesn’t arrive for the school drop-off the next morning either-or the one after that.\n\nGrace knows that Anna would NEVER leave her son, Ethan behind but nobody else seems as concerned as she is-including the police-so she takes matters into her own hands, and begins the search for her friend.\n\nCould her disappearance be linked to a case from the PAST, and to the secrets they have buried?\n\nI enjoyed Heidi Perks last book, “Three Perfect Liars” so despite the thriller trope of a current case, being linked to buried secrets from childhood, growing a bit STALE- I decided to give this a go. Unfortunately though, this book didn’t quite deliver for me. After a strong start, the story STALLED-nothing seemed to be happening-and when something finally did-it was underwhelming.\n\nReviews are mixed for this one-so perhaps if you read the genre less frequently than I do, you will enjoy this one more than I did. For me unfortunately, it only rates between 2-3 ⭐️.\n\nThank You to Gallery for the gifted copy. It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!\n\nAVAILABLE NOW!\n\nApril 19, 2021\n\nEXCERPT: I turn back to Sally, thinking of the last conversation I'd had with Grace two days ago.\n\n'Do you think of Heather, Anna?' she'd asked me. 'Do you ever think about that night like I do?'\n\n'No one knows Grace like I do,' I tell Sally. 'No one has a clue what she is capable of.'\n\nThe truth is that if Grace wants it to happen, then there is every chance a murder enquiry might open up.\n\nABOUT 'THE WHISPERS': Anna Robinson hasn't been seen since she went on a night out with her four closest friends.\n\nShe has a loving husband and a son she adores. Surely she wouldn't abandon them and her perfect life. . .\n\nBut what has happened to her?\n\nAt the school gates, it's not long before the rumours start. Anna's oldest friend Grace is beside herself with worry - desperately searching for answers, and certain that someone is hiding the truth.\n\nWith each day that passes, Anna's life is under increasing threat. And a the pressure mounts, it won't be long before something cracks. . .\n\nMY THOUGHTS: No. I didn't find this thrilling, or suspenseful. It was largely repetitive. I was considering abandoning this at 60% when there was a twist that piqued my interest. But I was soon struggling again.\n\nThe plot lacks substance, and the characters depth. They are very much cardboard cutouts. At the denouement I found myself wishing that the cliff would collapse and take the whole lot of them over the edge, but the author was determined not to give me any satisfaction.\n\nReading is a personal and subjective experience, and what appeals to one may not please another. So if you enjoyed the excerpt from The Whispers, and the plot outline appeals, please do go ahead and read it. Just because it wasn't for me, doesn't mean that you won't enjoy this.\n\n⭐⭐.4\n\n#TheWhispers #NetGalley\n\n@heidiperks #randomhouseukcornerstone\n\n@HeidiPerksBooks @PenguinRandomUK\n\nTHE AUTHOR: Heidi Perks was born in 1973. She lives by the sea in Bournemouth with her husband and two children. She has a huge interest in what makes people tick and loves to write about family relationships, especially where some of the characters are slightly dysfunctional.\n\nDISCLOSURE: Thank you to Random House UK, Cornerstone via Netgalley for providing a digital ARC of The Whispers by Heidi Perks for review. All opinions expressed in this review are entirely my own personal opinions.\n\nFor an explanation of my rating system please refer to my Goodreads.com profile page or the about page on sandysbookaday.wordpress.com\n\nThis review and others are also published on Twitter, Amazon, Instagram and my webpage https://sandysbookaday.wordpress.com/...\n\nMarch 13, 2021\n\nGrace has returned to the English coastal town of Clearwater, where she grew up before she emigrated with her parents to Australia when she was seventeen. Now married with an eight year old daughter and her husband away working In Singapore, she is looking forward to re-connecting with Anna Robinson, her childhood best friend.\n\nAnna’s mother left when she was five, leaving her disengaged father to bring her up. When Anna and Grace became friends at school, Anna started spending a lot of time at Grace’s house with her family, the two of them becoming as close as sisters. However, now that Grace has returned to Clearwater, she discovers Anna has moved on and has her own tightly knit group of close friends. While Anna is happy to see Grace again, she is not looking to rekindle the close friendship they once had or to talk about the events that happened in their past. But then Anna goes missing after a night out with friends and Grace feels like she is the only one concerned about her.\n\nThis is a complex tale about women’s friendships and how the closeness of them can lead to toxicity, jealousy and even obsession. The first part of the novel is mostly seen through Grace’s eyes, but is she a reliable narrator? Could she be seeing her old friendship through rose coloured glasses and Anna’s friends as controlling rather than merely supporting Anna?\n\nIn the background at the school gates, are the mothers at the primary school where Anna and Grace’s children are in the same class. At school drop-off and pick-up time they gather in clusters and watch in fascination as Anna and her friends interact with Grace, whispering about they think is going on in this drama playing out before their eyes. This was almost an incidental theme in the novel, but could have been employed more effectively to add tantalising gossip and conjecture as commentary on what appeared to be happening in the triangle that is Grace, Anna and Anna’s little group of friends.\n\nThe story is a slow burner which could have had a bit more suspense early on but this does allow for the tension to build slowly and then ramp up once we start to hear more of Anna’s voice later in the novel. It’s more of a psychological suspense than a mystery with the need to delve into the thoughts and motives of both Anna and Grace. The prologue ensures that there is always a feeling of foreboding, as we know a body will be found at the end – but just whose body will it be? 3.5★\n\nWith thanks to Random House UK and Netgalley for a copy to read. Expected publication date 15th April. Review originally published in Mystery & Suspense magazine.\n\nMarch 18, 2021\n\nGrace Goodwin leaves Australia and returns home to Clearwater near Weymouth, Dorset with her daughter. She expects to pick up where she left off in her teens especially with her then best friend Anna Robinson. However, Anna has a new group of friends, a Gang of Four and it becomes apparent there is much resistance to Grace’s overtures of friendship. This intriguing examination of toxic friendship is told by Grace and Anna as well as the whispering onlookers at the school gate.\n\nThis is a gripping psychological thriller that’s hard to put down. The observations of Anna, Nancy, Rachel and Caitlyn’s clique by the onlookers in the small town are very illuminating as well as what they witness of Graces’ reactions. The characterisation is very well done although most are not very likeable. The premise and plot are good and the pace is pitched perfectly keeping you invested in trying to establish whose perspective is correct and who is unreliable. The tone changes at about this thirds through as you realise that one of the women is obsessive, jealous, controlling and manipulative. There are so many secrets amongst all the women, there are lies, cover ups, plastering over cracks, toxic tension and an abundance of guilt. The problems originate in the past and I like the way we peak versions of those events until we arrive at what might have happened to haunt particularly one of the women. The finale of the events of the three months from September to the end of December is extremely tense and dramatic and almost makes you hold your breath.\n\nOverall this is a gripping read with a good ending that is very enjoyable.\n\nWith thanks to NetGalley and Random House UK Cornerstone:Century for the arc for an honest review.\n\nMarch 9, 2022\n\nGrace and Anna have been best friends from the time they were little girls until they were seventeen-years old when Grace's family moved to Australia and the girls lost touch with one another and eventually Grace met her husband and started a family. Now twenty years later Grace returns to the UK hoping to resume her friendship with Anna.\n\nIn their town the woman are very cliquish and Anna seems to have her own small trio of friends who aren't very welcoming or friendly to Grace. Anna also appears distant and seems to avoid Grace as much as possible which is surprising and uncomfortable and difficult for Grace to understand. Although she has noticed one of the women is overbearing and controlling especially of all the ladies' conversations particularly of Anna's. One night shortly before Christmas Anna finally invites Grace out for a ladies's night with her friends. Grace has mixed feelings about the invitation yet she's happy to be with Anna for the evening.\n\nThe women are also heavy drinkers which doesn't help and as the night progresses arguments and angry whispers stir within the group leaving Grace clueless and feeling unwanted as Anna has pretty much avoided Grace throughout the entire evening. When Grace feeling relief finally goes home while leaving the group behind notices that heated discussions continued to crop up around the table.\n\nGrace has had enough of all the women and especially Anna for treating her so poorly until the next morning when she drops her daughter off at school and hears that Anna never made it home the night before and when she questions the other women they all seem to have different stories about the end of the night and facts are not lining up properly. Why? Why wouldn't the women be truthful, what would make them lie? As the day progresses and Anna still has not surfaced, Grace feels lost and thinks something very bad has happened to Anna and someone in that group knows what really happened late, last night. What happened to Anna?\n\nThis was an enjoyable and entertaining story although it was a slow-burn up to a certain point and then the fun really starts! Some unpredictable twists came into play and they were well received. Anna and Grace were both complicated characters and I thought I understood them but I was delighted to realize I was wrong. When the book finally let loose the real history was told about both women and it was a doozy! Most of the characters are not likeable which was fine but I just didn't feel real emotions coming from them so I was a little disappointed with a lot of their dialogue and actions although it didn't keep me from enjoying the story. I really enjoy reading books by Heidi Perks and hope to read more in the future.\n\nI want to thank the publisher \"Gallery Books\" and Netgalley for the opportunity to read this ARC and any thoughts or opinions expressed are unbiased and mine alone!\n\nI I recommend this book and have given a rating of 3 TWISTED 🌟🌟🌟 STARS!!\n\nTitle: The Whispers\n\nAuthor: Heidi Perks\n\nPublisher: Gallery Books\n\nPublishing Date: March 8, 2022\n\nMarch 27, 2021\n\nThis is the story of a toxic friendship. It’s not clear at the start that this is the case. And when you do realise it, it is not clear who the toxic friend is. Of course it slowly dawns and that’s pretty much the story.\n\nAfter 19 years away Grace Goodwin returns to her hometown of Clearwater - a small coastal community in England. She had been dragged off to Australia by her parents at age 17. The worst part was leaving her best friend, Anna, behind. Since then Grace has married Graham and they have an 8 year old daughter Matilda. But Grace returns to Clearwater alone, well with Matilda of course, but Graham has a new job in Singapore and cannot get away very often.\n\nWhen Anna first learns of Grace’s return she is thrilled. She had just been emptying out her father’s house after his death and there was her good friend Grace, literally on the doorstep. But she hasn’t realised the full implications. When she sees Grace at the school gates with Matilda she realises that Grace is back to stay. Oops, that’s quite awkward as Anna has a group of new friends and the four of them seem very cliquey. The very well put together Nancy seems particularly hostile towards Grace.\n\nIt all comes to a head shortly before Christmas. The four friends are used to having pre Christmas drinks at the local pub and this time Anna invites Grace to join them, but she is not made to feel welcome. But, as is usually the case with these sorts of stories - things are not quite what they seem and that night Anna doesn’t come home. Nobody else seems overly concerned by this and they do seem to be keeping something from Grace. It feels to her like she is the only one who is keen to find out what happened to Anna.\n\nI didn’t get completely invested in this one. Sure it was a good story and well written but I found it frustrating at times as I’m quite a direct person and beating around the bush is something I hate. There was nothing unique about the plot but it was well put together and the misdirection worked very well. However, the outcome soon became apparent. None of the characters were particularly likeable either. Nevertheless it was an easy story to read and quite entertaining. Thanks to Netgalley, Random House UK, Cornerstone and Heidi Perks for providing a review copy. My opinions are my own.\n\nFebruary 26, 2022\n\nGrace and Anna were the best of friends when they were kids. Years later when Grace returns to Australia with her daughter. She expects that they will reunite like no time has passed. However, to her dismay Anna has a new group of friends who are almost jealous of the friendship between Grace and Anna.\n\nA girls night out with Anna, Grace, and Anna’s friends is the perfect time to drink, talk, laugh, and really get to know each other. The next morning, Anna is not present at school drop off. Three days later still no sign of Anna. This is highly out of character for her and her husband and son begin to worry. Grace also starts worrying about where her best friend could come possibly be.\n\nPeople start whispering about what could have happened or who did what. Grace is sure someone knows something. She won’t stop until she finds her best friend.\n\nI liked this book. The relationships are broken and everyone is hiding something. You have no clue who to trust and that was part of the fun.\n\nThank you to Netgalley and the publisher for this arc in exchange for my honest review.\n\nMarch 6, 2022\n\nThe Whispers by Heidi Perks is a novel that falls in the thriller category but I’d almost just call this one a suspenseful drama. The story in The Whispers is one that is told by changing the point of view between the characters and a slight bit of flashing back to past events.\n\nAs children Anna and Grace were the best of friends being completely inseparable until Grace’s family had to move away to another country. Now almost twenty years later Grace has returned to the town she grew up in and hopes to resume her friendship with Anna.\n\nOf course with so much time having past from the days of Grace and Anna’s friendship Anna now has a life of her own. Grace does her best to fit in with Anna’s group of friends even tagging along on a night at the pub but she leaves the party earlier than Anna. The next morning Grace learns Anna never made it home.\n\nThe Whispers by Heidi Perks was a very slow building novel which isn’t always my favorite type of read. The story focuses a lot on building the relationship between the women then tosses in a bit of suspense to move it along. There are some twists to the plot along the way but for me the overall novel didn’t engage me enough to finish thinking this one was more than just an average alright read.\n\nI received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.\n\nFor more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/\n\nApril 11, 2021\n\nGrace Goodwin leaves Australia and returns to her childhood home, Clearwater near Weymouth with her daughter Matilda. She is looking forward to seeing her childhood best friend Anna, as they were inseparable growing up, until Grace moved to Australia with her parents.\n\nAnna however has her own group of best friends and it soon becomes apparent that there isn’t room for another friend to join and whilst Anna is happy to see Grace, she does not want to talk about their past Friendship.\n\nWhen Anna goes missing after a night out with Grace and her friends, she feels like she is the only one concerned about Anna. Why are they not calling the police?\n\nThis is a gripping story and it kept me guessing with its many twists until the end.\n\nThank you to Netgalley for my copy in exchange for a review.\n\nMay 25, 2021\n\nThe Whispers is an enthralling psychological mystery/suspense read. Heidi Perks explores the dynamics, intricacies and intensities of female friendships, from childhood, through adolescence to motherhood and beyond.\n\nThe book opens tantalisingly with the discovery on New Year's Day of a woman's body at the bottom of Crayne's Cliff, an area locals know to be prone to landslips. We're not told the victim's identity, but the detective from whose perspective the prologue is told recalls an earlier tragedy, involving a younger woman, and the fact that three weeks ago, a woman called Grace Goodwin had reported a crime...\n\nWe're then taken back four months, as the narrative works its way forward to the present day. The point of view shifts between those of Grace Goodwin, Anna Robinson and a Greek chorus-like voice emanating from the observations of other parents in the school playground.\n\nThirty-something mother of one Grace Goodwin has recently returned to her (fictional) childhood hometown of Clearwater, on the UK's south coast, having lived in Australia since late adolesence. Her husband has a high-flying job based in Singapore, so she's effectively a single mother of 8-year-old Matilda much of the time. She's looking forward to re-establishing a close friendship with Anna Fallow (now Robinson), with whom she enjoyed a childhood and teenage friendship akin to sisterhood.\n\nHowever, as the story slowly unfolds, through present day perspectives and occasional flashback sections, we realise that there is a darkness underpinning Grace and Anna's relationship. What is the past event that seems to preoccupy them both in the present day, and why does Anna seem so reticent to rekindle her close friendship with Grace?\n\nHeidi Perks skilfully uses foreshadowing, hints at the possible unreliability of the characters' recollections, and immerses the reader in each woman's experience. Our sympathies are pulled back and forth as we observe the tensions between the central group of female characters. What loyalties do we owe our friends? Is the length of a friendship necessarily indicative of its strength or health for the protagonists? What can we reasonably expect from our friends, or they of us? At what point do we concede that we have outgrown a friendship and walk away?\n\nI found The Whispers a thought-provoking and deliciously suspenseful read. Any female reader will recognise the types of individual and group dynamics Heidi Perks describes, especially those of us who have observed and/or experienced playground (parent) politics ourselves!\n\nI would highly recommend The Whispers to any and all readers who enjoy character-based dramas set against a background of mystery and suspense.\n\nMy thanks to the author Heidi Perks, publisher Penguin Random House UK - Cornerstone - Century imprint, and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review this title.\n\n(Thanks also to Carolyn, whose excellent review prompted me to seek out a last-minute ARC)\n\nApril 11, 2021\n\nThe time old tale of 2 friends with a secret from the past, fast forward years and they are back living in the same town, 1 of them has new friends, 1 doesn’t, as say a time old tale but still no one forced me to read it!\n\nNow, the good bit first, this author writes fantastic ‘Mum’s at School gates’ observations, her descriptions of these daily carrying’s on are superb, in previous books and in this one, spot on\n\nSadly though this book was just not for me,I see mixed comments on it but it just didn’t hold up against the very high level of thrillers that are out there (and more arrive daily) the plot was threadbare, the characters both main and the 3 extra friends all unlikeable and uninteresting and it was so repetitive, nothing really happens and when it does it’s not that exciting\n\nAnd there I will stop apart from to say I look forward to the authors next book...\n\n3/10\n\n2 ( based purely on the School gate parts) Stars\n\nDecember 8, 2021\n\nThis is the third Heidi Perks book that I have read, and while both \"Her One Mistake\" and \"Three Perfect Liars,\" were 4-star reads for me, this one just fell a bit short.\n\nThe book opens with the discovery of a dead body at the bottom of a cliff, and then goes back four months in the past to main character, Grace, returning to her small hometown after 20 years in Australia. With a husband who works in Singapore and a young daughter who feels pretty non-existent, Grace's main goal in life seems to be to renew her childhood friendship with Anna, who was more like a sister to her before she moved to Australia. Anna doesn't seem to return the feelings though, as she now has her own clique and seems reluctant to include her former BFF. After a girls' night out in which Grace is finally included, Anna goes missing. Only Grace seems concerned though - neither Anna's friends nor her husband seem to care, so Grace goes to the police and starts her own investigation. Past secrets come back to haunt both Grace and Anna, which leads to the second tragedy in two decades in this small town.\n\nI liked the POVs and how they shifted from Grace, to Anna, to a group of school parents who relay their observations through \"whispers in the school yard.\" It was clever and a good way to tell much of the back story. That was about it when it came to what I liked though. I couldn't stand Grace, Anna, or any of the other women. They all lacked depth - Grace is creepy, Anna is shifty, and the clique is obnoxiously childish. After Anna goes missing, the other characters begin behaving inexplicably, and I figured out immediately what was really going on. The plot just wasn't overly thrilling or suspenseful and was seriously lacking in substance. As the book came back full circle to the body at the bottom of the cliff, I found myself not caring which character it was and actually wishing that it would end with all of the characters at the bottom of the cliff, but alas, it didn't happen.\n\nOverall, I struggled to connect with the characters and the storyline. I was expecting more twists and turns, but it ended up just being another tired tale of a twisted, toxic friendship. 3 stars.\n\nJanuary 9, 2023\n\nHeidi Perks you are a great author. Your book kept my attention the whole time I was reading it. The writing is so suspenseful you can't wait to get to the end of the story. The tension increases as more information about the past of both Anna and Grace is uncovered and disclosed. What will keep you reading is discovering who was found on the beach and untangling all the lies in search of the truth. This is more a novel of suspense rather than a thriller or mystery. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.\n\nDecember 26, 2020\n\nAnother excellent novel by author Heid Perks, an author who I have read a lot of this year and found very entertaining.\n\nThis is a gripping story set in a small village where gossip spreads like wildfire. Anna Robinson has a loving husband a son she dotes on and a close circle of friends, so when she suddenly disappears overnight they are all concerned. Why has she disappeared, is she safe or the victim of an horrible crime.\n\nGripping novel with lots of twists that will keep you guessing to the very end. As per usual the author creates excellent characters that come to life on the page. Another winner.\n\nI would like to thank both Netgalley and Random House, Cornerstone UK for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.\n\nJanuary 17, 2023\n\nThe story revolves around Grace Goodwin and Anna Robinson both are in their early thirties.. Grace has recently returned from Australia to Clearwater a small town near Weymouth. Grace and her parents had emigrated to Australia when Grace was 17. At that time Grace was best friends with Anna Robinson, they both met at school in Clearwater when they were five years of age and had become close friends, more like sisters according to Grace. Anna remained in Clearwater after Grace emigrated, she subsequently married and had a young son Ethan. Anna had also made friends with three women, Nancy, Rachel and Caitlyn. Grace enrols her daughter Matilda in the local school and on her first day taking her Grace sees Anna with her three friends at the school gates, they are a close tight knit group of four. Grace wants to infiltrate this group, take up her friendship with Anna again even though they have not kept in touch in the intervening years. Anna seems less than keen to rekindle their friendship. When Anna disappears after a night out it appears that Grace is the only one concerned.\n\nWe hear the story from both Anna and Grace’s point of view and I found myself sympathising with first Grace and then Anna. It is only when the whole story of the past is revealed that we learn the truth not only about their relationship but also about the event that had happened 22 years ago involving both Annia and Grace.\n\nMarch 19, 2021\n\nWhispers is a poignant but brutal slashing to chest kind of read. A tale of manipulation, jealousy and control. In order to fully fall for a book, you to need to find something that really speaks to you. A book that draws out connections, a book that aches to be heard. It’s a book that knows how you as a reader, ticks. The ease and rawness that flows from out with the pages is like liquid gold – rare and stunning. Whispers has an addictive pull that ties you down and won’t let go until the last sentence has seeped into your pores…chores be damned!\n\nThis story excels in taking you hostage, holding you to ransom and reluctantly letting you go when it thinks you finally understand the complexity of what its telling you.\n\nStruggling against the story that Whispers NEEDS to tell you is a futile struggle. A history never forgotten. A case of out of sight out of mind. Obsession and control. Trauma. An unreliable narrator. A death. Deceit and all the heart break you can muster. I won’t lie that I felt dragged through a hedge backwards by the end, the story wrought emotions in me that felt long dormant, I was fully invested and fully compelled to keep reading.\n\nHeidi Perks is an incredible writer. It took no time at all and I was gladly ripping my own heart out of my chest, take it, I no longer have a need of it…dramatic but that’s how she made me feel. The book seems to have the secret formula to dissecting relationships. Perk’s narrative leaves you searching for the missing pieces of your heart for the entirety of the novel. Misdirection at every turn, whispers is a novel that leave a shadow upon the soul.\n\nGrace Goodwin has left Australia to return to her hometown of Clearwater near Weymouth, Dorset with her daughter Matilda. Her husband, Graham works overseas in Singapore. Her best friend, Anna Robinson still lives in Clearwater and she hopes to pick up where they left off when she left as a teen. Not all is as it seems however, when after the initial excitement of her friend, Grace being back it turns sour. She has a new group of friends, Nancy, Rachel and Caitlyn. They aren’t exactly keen on Grace or how she likes to display her love and friendship.\n\nWhispers is the first book I have read Heidi Perks but if the others are as outstanding as this, I expect more of the same. Her characterization tells a tale of broken psyches with a story to tell with deep and dark histories. I constantly had a feeling of a creeping shadow of desolation running through out the story, it had me hook, line and sinker.\n\nWhispers is the perfect cadence of a highly addictive plot. It unseats you. Staggeringly brilliant. A riveting tale that likes to rip up the rule book.\n\nFebruary 23, 2021\n\nThis was a very slow burner, I found it dragged and was disappointed in the fact that all the characters did was chat to each other about their missing friend. It lacked excitement and action which was such a shame as I was hoping for better.\n\nJanuary 30, 2021\n\nGrace has returned to her home town after spending many years in Australia.\n\nShe has missed her childhood friend Anna and the two are reunited but things are not the same and Anna’s current friends are not happy about the situation.\n\nWhen Anna goes missing things take a dramatic turn as everyone tries to find out the truth of where she has gone.\n\nSome twist and turns in this story.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Random House UK, Cornerstone for my e-copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\nDecember 28, 2022\n\nIn 1997 Anna and Grace were the best of friends. Sure, Grace was more of a mother hen to Anna, who lost her mother early in life, and in turn rebelled with a seemingly constant need for attention, but they're as close as can be. When new girl Heather moved to town and strikes up a friendship with Anna, Grace feels threatened and paranoid she'll lose her bestie to another more exciting girl. Fortunately for her fate intervened when Heather disappeared, never to be seen again. Or was it fate or something else?? The disappearance was never solved and the case went cold.\n\nFast forward to present day and Grace has recently moved back home with her young daughter, fleeing a lackluster marriage in which her husband is always away for work. She's eager to see Anna again after all of these years, hoping her bestie will welcome her with open arms and help her through this particularly rough time. Unfortunately for Grace, Anna does not greet her with the warm welcome she anticipated, and is cold towards her, always coming up with excuses as to why she can't meet up to reconnect, forcing Grace to observe her and her new mom friends from afar...until one morning when Anna does not come home after a night out with the girls. Grace immediately feels something is amiss, however it seems she's the only one really concerned for Anna's welfare. Could it be she's just paranoid and overreacting? Or has something dreadful happened to her friend...something everyone else wants to keep a secret? Grace takes it upon herself to go to the police and file a missing persons report, but nobody seems to take her seriously. Does her disappearance have anything to do with the disappearance of Heather all those years earlier? If so, what?!!\n\nIt took me a few chapters to get a grip on the storyline, but once I did I was fairly intrigued. I needed to know what exactly was going on, if anything. It was fairly clear early on that Grace was involved in a one-sided friendship with Anna, but the reasons why were unknown. Told in dual timelines, we slowly learn about what exactly happened that fateful night in 1997 when Heather vanished, and how it ties to present day. That mystery plotline alone kept me intrigued throughout, but I had this one correct, for once! Despite this one not exactly having any earth-shattering twists that I didn't see coming, it was an enjoyable read for me, but probably won't stand out amongst my 2022 reads. I'd definitely recommend this to my fellow mystery fans, as the writing is exceptional as all of Perks' novels have been, but if you're looking for a true edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting read, this one may not be the book for you. That being said, I'm still a big fan of Perks and look forward to reading her next release!!\n\nMay 16, 2021\n\nTwitter |\n\nGoodreads |\n\nBlog |\n\nInstagram |\n\nI look forward each time to this authors book releases.\n\nWhen I received this I couldn’t contain myself any longer.\n\nI went into this blind and for me, it’s the best way for a thriller. I don’t want to know much at all, I want to go on a journey unknown.\n\nBased around Anna Robinson. Wife, mother and a friend.\n\nBut what was her past?\n\nAnd did anyone else know?\n\nHave you ever had a jealous friend when you were younger? Someone who just wanted you all to themselves and didn’t want you to have any other friends?\n\nI did.\n\nAnna is now grown. She’s in the town she grew up in. Bringing up her child, taking them to school and has nice grown mummy friends now.\n\nOne night, all the friends decide to have a girls night out except, she didn’t go home with the others. She didn’t return.\n\nShe would never abandon her child.\n\nDon’t be mistaken though, it’s not a missing woman type story. It’s much more than this......\n\nAnd the #whispers start. .........\n\nI was riveted by this plot. So much so I never wanted it to end, yet, on the flip side I wanted more, I needed more. Oh, I got much more!\n\nIf you’ve read Now You See Her back in 2019 it was Heidi Perks debut novel that Richard & Judy selected for their bookclub, and got over 2500 5* reviews on Amazon alone!\n\nRead The Whispers. The shhhh whispers at the school gates, the rumours, the hushed voices behind hands that whisper, the silent crackle of shhhhh whispers. Is it true?\n\nFebruary 27, 2021\n\nGrace and Anna met and became friends at five years old. They did everything together and had sleepovers together. Their people said that they were more like sisters as they were always together. But a few years later Grace and her parents emigrated to Australia and wanted to take Anna with them, but Anna’s father wouldn’t allow it.\n\nYears later Grace returns with a daughter while her husband is still working overseas. To be honest their relationship is strained and doesn’t think that it will last with each other living in separate countries. But Grace hopes that she can rekindle the relationship with Anna. But Anna has moved on an has a group of friends of her own and seeing Grace only brings back memories that she would rather forget. So, when Anna meets Grace, she tells her that she has moved on with her life and doesn’t need her as a friend. But when Anna goes missing Grace is the only one worried for her safety. Anna friends thinks that she will be back. Grace senses that there is something that they are not telling her.\n\nThis is another great novel by Heidi Perks, A bit slower burning than her usual books. This is a story of friendship but also jealousy and manipulation between friends. It is cleverly written and had a great plot. Four stars from me.\n\nMarch 8, 2022\n\nTwenty years ago, Grace Goodwin was best of friends with Anna Robinson while they were in school. Grace moved away and now returns with a small daughter, hoping to pick back up with her relationship with Anna. But Anna has 3 other good friends now and doesn't seem interested in Grace anymore. After a night at the pub with all the ladies, Anna doesn't come home. Her husband doesn't seem too concerned about calling the police but Grace knows Anna would never leave her son.\n\nChapters alternate with present and childhood as well as visits with Anna's therapist. In the first half, I had an overwhelming sense that I was missing something terribly important. Why was Anna so distant with Grace? The second part of the book explains it. I've read two other books by this author and she is very good with misdirection.\n\nMarch 22, 2021\n\nMy favorite novels involve friendships. They say love makes the world go round, but they never specify what kind of love. There is a huge focus on parental love and/or romance, but what about the relationships that carry us through the best and worst days? I say yes to finding the love of your life, and double yes to finding your soul mate. Oh, I see you coming. ‘You’re the luckiest person when you marry your best friend!’ But I would not happily chat with my hubby while shaving my legs. I am a big believer that some things can only be shared and understood by a friend.\n\nThat’s why I was happy to – literally – jump on Heidi Perks’ latest novel, The Whispers. I jumped. I could not resist the appeal of the author’s excellent writing with a clever plot revolving around friendships.\n\nDeath, trauma, toxic relationships, secrets, and all the years in between – The Whispers has all the ingredients of a great thriller and is served with a beautiful prose, subtle at times, threatening at others, always addictive.\n\nThe prologue reeled me in with its eerie tone and promise of a dead body. A date, a place, and so many questions. What was I supposed to do??? I turned off my phone, settled down on the couch, and read as if my life depended on it. It had been a couple of weeks since I’d felt the urge to cut myself from the world to fully dive into a story, and I relished every minute of it.\n\nGrace moves back to her childhood hometown of Clearwater after twenty years. Anna never left the place. Those two used to be best friends until Grace left with her parents when she was fourteen. Can they rekindle their friendship after all those years? Grace hopes so, but Anna… Anna has a new group of friends, mothers whose children go to the same school as Anna’s son Ethan, and now Grace’s daughter Mathilda. And all around, the buzzing of whispers from all mothers creates a wall that separates the group from everyone else…\n\nLet’s talk about the whispers from a moment. I mentioned in several reviews that I am happy not to be a mother, one reason being school runs scare me! The novel incorporates the noise made by mothers at the gates, talking about each other in hushed tones, hoping to grab the latest piece of gossip. What does a scene look like from their point of view? Those small interludes give a little shiver of thrill and excitement. By including them, the author gives the reader a chance to become part of the crowd, to mix with the parents and turn into a witness.\n\nAt the core of The Whispers is one friendship, Grace and Anna’s, which began when they were five. Inseparable until separated by Grace’s move to Australia when they were teenagers, their bond was strong, powerful and… and I quickly realized I couldn’t collate the images given to me by Grace with the vibes oozing from Anna. Something was wrong, this was made clear very early on. I could fathom that Anna had moved on, created a new life and was happy with her group of friends. But. There is always a but, and if you are lucky, it’s a good one. In The Whispers, it’s a big fat “but” that kept me hooked, drowned me in theories, and then turned the tables on me!\n\nWhen Anna goes missing, Grace steps up and wants answers. Why won’t her so-called friends or her husband go to the police? Why is no-one out there looking for her?\n\nA story has several sides, so does the truth. Those affirmations have never been truer. Depending on the lenses through which you look at things, they appear oh-so-differently. Heidi Perks plays with the point of views and tricked me a few time! I was expecting a missing-person thriller and ended up with a deep and intense exploration of what a friendship can be made of and how terribly heavy its weigh can feel, even after decades.\n\nWho is lying? What is on Grace’s agenda? What happened all those years ago? Most importantly…\n\nWhat would you do for your friends? I know I’d recommend them to read The Whispers so we could whisper (or shout!) about the book!!\n\nFebruary 21, 2021\n\n“keep your friends close and your enemies closer”? Or in the case of The Whispers “keep your friends at arm’s length and your enemies at a safe distance”. Mystery and intrigue abound as we follow Grace and Anna’s story, but a word of caution: there are always two sides to any story and often neither bear any resemblance to the truth.The setting of Clearwater is the perfect backdrop for The Whispers, it’s set in a small village where gossip spreads like wildfire. It’s the sort of place where everyone has an opinion, where Chinese whispers start as an innocent remark turn to something more vicious. It took me a while to get my head around the chapters, as there are chapters told from the POV of the two main protagonists Grace and Anna, and there are chapters told in the present and others that relate to the past.\n\nI found it difficult to like any of the ‘friends’, I found them to be self-centred, overbearing, controlling and immature, not my favourite traits in anyone let alone a friend! But this isn’t a negative because I actually enjoyed the book more for not liking the characters. It was fascinating to see the dynamics within the group change once Grace joined the group, and witness the complexities of Grace and Anna’s relationship unfold.There are also random chapters from the ‘playground mums’ which I thought was a genius ploy on the authors part, as the reader you feel part of their conversations, you jump to conclusions and form opinions based on half truths, and second or third hand information.\n\nOne thing I do like is an unreliable narrator it’s always interesting to see how one person’s recall of events can differ from person to person. The Whispers isn’t a fast-paced book by any means but the slower pace allows Perks to build on the tension and suspense, whilst creating a sense of trepidation as the author deftly reveals the depth of the friend’s toxic relationship. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book, considering the slower pace and the unlikable characters, but it surpassed my expectations. I’m sure The Whispers will be a major hit with psychological thriller lovers.\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\nAnna and Grace were best friends as children until Grace's parents decided to relocate to Australia when the girls' friendship was severed. Now, they are thirty-something women with families of their own and Grace is back in Clearwater near Weymouth, Dorset. She wants her and Anna to continue their friendship, picking up from where it was left. Anna, who has a new posse of friends doesn't seem particularly keen and is keeping Grace at arm's length. Grace, however, is determined but when Anna goes missing after a night out, she will need to keep her wits about her to find her friend.\n\nI loved this multi-layered novel which was full of unreliable characters and misplaced assumptions. The story is told using a narrative split between past and present so that the reader is able to view Grace and Anna's relationship from then and now. I revelled in this dark, ominous tale of toxic friendship. Well plotted with some great twists, I will definitely be reading more from Heidi Perks.\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this novel at my request from Random House UK, Cornerstone/ Century via NetGalley and this review is my unbiased opinion.\n\nJanuary 9, 2022\n\nGrace Goodwin moves from Australia back to Clearwater with her 8 year old daughter Matilda. She wants to rekindle her friendship with her best friend she had during her teen years, Anna Robinson. The problem is Anna has new friends now and they are not to open about including Grace in their group. Anna begins to shut Grace out and then one night after girls night of fun Anna disappears. Grace contacts her husband Ben, questions all the girls in the group and even goes to police. She know her friend wouldn't just up and leave her son Ethan.\n\nI have read several Heidi Perks’ books and enjoyed them all. THE WHISPERS was a great psychological thriller that I had a hard time putting down. It was a quick and easy read for me that had the perfect mix of mystery, suspense, and creepiness! The ending did not disappoint. You can add THE WHISPERS to the long list of great books by Heidi Perks!\n\nMany thanks to NetGalley and Gallery Books for my ARC in exchange for my honest review.\n\nThis review will be posted to my Instagram Blog (@coffee.break.book.reviews) in the near future.\n\nFebruary 13, 2022\n\n\"The Whispers\" by Heidi Perks, is about Anna and Grace who are childhood best friends. Grace has a picture perfect family and they take Anna under their wing due to her tough home situation. Eventually, Grace and her family move to Australia. They lose touch with Anna. Years later, Anna and Grace reconnect, but soon after Anna goes missing. Grace suspects someone close to Anna may be responsible and will stop at nothing to find out the truth about the disappearance.\n\nThe writing in this novel starts out strong, but midway goes into subplots that do not add much to the story. The plot has high school \"tit for tat\" type jealousy between the characters which becomes the central focus for a considerable amount of time. There are enjoyable high points in the writing such as Grace's mom making warm childhood memories for the girls. I look forward to reading more books from the very talented Heidi Perks.\n\n\"The Whispers will be published March 8, 2022.\n\nThank you NetGalley and Galley Book, for sharing this e-book with me in exchange for my honest review.\n\nApril 17, 2021\n\nOminous, atmospheric, and twisty!\n\nThe Whispers is a menacing, character-driven thriller that delves into the complex dynamics between friends and highlights just how dependent and toxic some of those relationships can ultimately become.\n\nThe prose is taut and intense. The characters are plagued, deceptive, and impulsive. And the plot using a back-and-forth, past/present style does a nice job of building tension as it unfolds a tortuous tale of friendship, lies, secrets, manipulation, and obsession.\n\nAs some of you know, I’m a huge fan of Heidi Perks, and this novel didn’t disappoint. The Whispers is another riveting, edgy, unsettling tale by Perks that kept me guessing from start to finish, and as always, I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThank you to Penguin Random House UK – Arrow Publishing for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review."
