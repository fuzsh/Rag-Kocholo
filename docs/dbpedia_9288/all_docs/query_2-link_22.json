        "text": "Welcome to Weekly Whisper #64\n\nLast month I travelled back to the UK to spend some long overdue time with family and friends.\n\nI spent time in my hometown of Edinburgh, where I lived for the first 20 years of my life. Despite not having lived in my ‘hometown’ for decades I still felt a sense of ‘home’ about it.\n\nI’ve always felt that ‘home’ would always be where my family was. To an extent that’s true with Edinburgh, as my Mum still lives there. But there was something else. There was something else that made me feel ‘at home’.\n\nMaybe it was the familiar surroundings – the council buses; the central train station; the castle in the middle of the city; the accents I was familiar with.\n\nPerhaps it was the lingering sense and spirit of where I grew up – physically, mentally, emotionally, etc.\n\nWhatever the reason, I felt centered, at peace, comfortable, proud, and ‘at home’. The experience made me reflect on how often I took that feeling with me elsewhere or would it only be provoked in my hometown?\n\nMy own food for thought – to change the sentiment of the Crowded House song – always take the ‘sense of home’ with you.\n\nSo, where’s home for you? How might you replicate that sense elsewhere?\n\nOne hour of life, crowded to the full with glorious action, and filled with noble risks, is worth whole years of those mean observances of paltry decorum - Sir Walter Scott\n\nStanding proud in the main street of Edinburgh is The Scott Monument – named after Sir Walter Scott a famous Scottish novelist, poet and playwright of the 17th/18th century.\n\nI looked into who he was and what he’d written and this quote stood out. Partly, because we had a hectic schedule trying to fit as many friends and family into short timelines. And partly because I’ve\n\nreminded myself for years that ‘sometimes it's better to live a day as a tiger than a lifetime as a mouse’.\n\nSo, what will you do with that one wild and precious hour in front of you? Roar or squeak?\n\nQuestion of the week:\n\nHow free are you from the limitations of your thoughts, feelings and expectations?\n\nPerhaps a nuanced distinction is to consider when to align with or when to ignore your own limitations.\n\nIt’s unlikely to be a binary situation so can you hold your thoughts, feelings, and expectations lightly enough that you can pick up or drop them at the right time?\n\nQuote of the week:\n\nDoing nothing is better than being busy doing nothing - Lao Tzu\n\nWell, I struggle with this one! I think parts of my busy-ness are an antidote to the fears and anxieties that might appear if I allow quiet time in! So often I fall into the trap of being busy doing nothing.\n\nThis serves as a good reminder for me at least.\n\nHow about you – how comfortable are you doing nothing?\n\nDid you miss last week's podcast episode?\n\nCatch up before the new release on Friday.\n\nEpisode #55 is a recap of our Season 2 special guests. The episode takes a look at our guest’s answers to the question Pete uses to open each interview – In terms of the work that each guest does, what should we be seeking freedom from?\n\nThat's all for this week. I hope you enjoyed Weekly Whisper #65.\n\nFeedback is my fuel so if you have any comments please send me an email at [email protected] and let me know your thoughts.\n\nCheers"
