        "text": "The strict security protocols governing the movements of President Sergio Mattarella of Italy dictate that he is not permitted to appear in the same location repeatedly. He is, in this respect and probably this respect alone, like lightning: He is not supposed to strike twice.\n\nIn rare circumstances, the rules can be bent. So last month, Mr. Mattarella was in attendance twice at track and field’s European Championships in Rome: once for the final of the men’s 100 meters, and once for the 4x100-meter relay. It seems the Italian president, like the rest of the country, cannot get enough of Marcell Jacobs.\n\nA day after the second event, Mr. Mattarella met the 29-year-old Jacobs in person when Italy’s Olympic team was invited to the Quirinal, the presidential palace in Rome, for an official reception. The squad is a glittering one, including the champion high-jumper Gianmarco Tamberi and two of tennis’s brightest talents, Jasmine Paolini and Jannik Sinner."
