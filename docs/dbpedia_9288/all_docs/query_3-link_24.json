        "text": "Hey Jaimee, hope you’re having a great week. Softball question to start before we get to the tough stuff, where are you right now and what have you been up to today/what are you up to today?\n\nToday, after spending some valuable time binging the relatively new Wednesday series on Netflix, I’ve been packing for the Cayamo cruise. It’s like a floating music festival hosted by Sixthman that will sail from Miami tomorrow. I’m stoked to be back on the boat.\n\nIntroduce yourself to our readers.\n\nHey, y’all. I’m Jaimee Harris — a Texas-raised, queer, folk singer-songwriter. When I’m not writing or playing music, you can find me at the nearest pinball arcade or riding roller coasters.\n\nYou talk a bit about your hometown in reference to your new album, Boomerang Town, where is your hometown, and what’s the best thing about it?\n\nI was raised in Hewitt, Texas — a small suburb of Waco. It’s complicated to explain my hometown. It’s not quite small enough to have small town charm, but not big enough to be a considered a city. To me, the best thing about it is that the lack of traditional entertainment required me to develop quite the imagination. Hewitt and Waco have changed since I left fourteen years ago, but one thing I especially loved about it was there weren’t a lot of places for like-minded folks to gather if you were a little left of center. It’s since closed, but we all used to hang out at a local coffee shop called Beatnix. It was a great mashup of singer-songwriter types, slam poets, academics from Baylor University, punk kids, DJs, and goths. I believe we all learned a lot from each other about art, imagination, creativity, and community.\n\nTell me about your new record Boomerang Town?\n\nThis album is a collection of songs that helped me explore the imprint my hometown and my family of origin made on me. I’ve often referred to my hometown as a “boomerang town,” meaning that people who try to leave seem to find themselves coming back.\n\nMy partner, Mary Gauthier, says “If you want to talk about the trauma of war, you can’t talk about the war. It’s too big. You have to tell the story from behind one soldier’s eyes.”\n\nThat’s what I found while writing Boomerang Town. This song cycle brings the listener behind the eyes of a seventeen-year-old boy who works at Walmart, a mother who has lost her pre-teen son, a young woman in the throes of alcoholism, people living in silent desperation, and souls renewed by the promise of new love.\n\nWhy was I able to get out of my boomerang town? Why are others stuck there, longing to leave but unable to find their way out? Writing these songs, bringing these narrators to life, brought me closer to the answers.\n\nEven though I was able to leave, I was not able to escape the generational cycle of addiction and mental illness. I had to deconstruct my Evangelical upbringing, keeping the good things I took from it (the importance of service and loving my neighbor), and rejecting the bigotry and brainwashing – then find faith again, my own way, outside of religion, through recovery, fellowship, and the alchemy of songwriting.\n\nMy hometown is no different than the hometown of millions of others. These songs tell the story of what it is like to live in these towns, in these times. This is what it’s like to be a part of the post ‘Born to Run’ generation. Springsteen’s generation had somewhere to run to. I’m not so sure mine does.\n\nWhether or not you grew up in a small town or were born and raised in New York City, I bet you can relate to these characters. I bet you know what it feels like to grieve the loss of a loved one or a dream. I bet you’ve experienced how one seemingly small decision can alter the course of your entire life, for better or worse. These characters are a reflection of a people whose resilience, hope, and faith is being tested.\n\nI love them. I am them.\n\nWow. Great answer, thank you. What’s the story to recent single, ‘The Fair and Dark Haired Lad’?\n\nI was invited to participate in a great co-writing workshop in Lafayette. On the last day, I was set up with Dirk Powell (Joan Baez, Rhiannon Gideon’s) and Katrine Noel (Les Hay Babies). We very quickly got into a discussion about generational addiction. Dirk brought in the idea of using the character “The Fair and Dark Haired Lad” to represent the alluring, insidious nature of alcoholism.\n\nYou released a pretty cool video along with the song, was that fun to film or a hassle?\n\nThe second I saw the music videos from David Olney’s Whispers and Sighs record, I knew I had to work with Anana Kaye and Irakli Gabriel for “The Fair and Dark Haired Lad” music video. They did all of the hard work. They cast the video, wrote the treatment, filmed, and edited it all. All I had to do was sit back and be amazed! It was really emotional to see images that were born in my mind when the song was being written appear in the final form of the video.\n\nTell me about one of the other songs on the record that I should look out for.\n\nI’d love for folks to know the story behind ‘Fall (Devin’s Song)’. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself Googling Devin Lujan. Devin was a classmate of mine who was accidentally shot and killed by his best friend when we were in sixth grade. What I discovered by Googling him was his mother had written several In Memoriam pieces to The Waco Tribune, sometimes about him and sometimes directly to him. The piece that hit me the hardest was the one she wrote directly to Devin on what would have been his high school graduation day. That is the day I walked across the stage. Devin should have been with us. I brought what I had to my partner Mary Gauthier and she was able to help me set a scene and bring Devin’s mother’s words to life. The accompanying music video made by Benjamin Violet (Pelvis Wrestley) is deeply moving.\n\nWhat was the last song that you chose for the record?\n\n‘Fall (Devin’s Song)’ was the last song chosen for the record and the first song we tracked. I played it live in the studio for the producer, Mark Hallman, on the first day of tracking and he agreed it completed the song cycle.\n\nWe couldn’t have anticipated what would happen months later at Robb Elementary in my home state. This song inspired by one mother’s grief has allowed me to do what I have done since I was a child — sing when I don’t have the words to speak.\n\nI see you’re visiting the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix in a few weeks, that is such a cool place. Where has been your favourite place to play live so far?\n\nThe most incredible experiences I’ve had playing live haven’t occurred on stages. It’s been my honor to play for the women currently incarcerated at the prison in Gatesville, Texas. ‘Missing Someone’ rises to a whole new level of significance in that environment.\n\nI also have been deeply moved by repeatedly being invited to sing for the Women in Recovery program in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Oklahoma incarcerates more women per capita than any state in the country. Most of those incarcerations are the result of non-violent substance abuse related offenses. Women in Recovery offers these women an alternative to prison that involves housing, educational, childcare, employment, and substance use recovery resources.\n\nOn February 8, I celebrated nine years of continuous sobriety. Although the consequences I faced in the criminal justice system did encourage me to get sober (after my second arrest) it was really, really difficult. I think most people assume that you fulfill the obligations required of you by the criminal justice system and you just get through it. There are so many barriers, including conflicting requirements within the criminal justice system itself. I know what it’s like to think “it would be easier to take myself out than get sober.” I know what it’s like to think “I’m never going to be able to climb this impossible mountain in front of me.”\n\nNine years ago, I was in jail. Now, I travel the world playing music full time. It’s a miracle. I think singing with the women at Women in Recovery or in the Gatesville Women’s Prison brings a little bit of hope. Oh, here’s a woman who has been through the criminal justice system, maintained sobriety, and has had so many of her dreams come true. A walking example of what is possible in recovery.\n\nAnother great answer, I can see why the people not the place are important to you. Where would you love to place live that you haven’t had chance to yet?\n\nI truly love to be on the move. I feel fortunate that this job really allows me to live everywhere! If I had an extended period of time off, I’d love to live in New York City, New Orleans, and Tulsa. For years, I’ve felt my soul longing to soak up the rhythms and musical legacy of all three of those cities.\n\nWith the $ from streaming being quite low, what’s the best way to support you as an artist?\n\nIn 2020, I launched the Folk N’ Roll Fan Club on Patreon. It’s not only been a financial game-changer for me over these last three years (truly, it’s allowed me to pay my bills and create art), but it’s also been a beautiful space to share honestly about what it’s like to be a singer-songwriter at ground level. Patreon has been an emotional support lifeboat for me.\n\nI feel like the expectation on social media is to make everyone feel like things are rocking all the time. Even though I don’t fulfill that expectation — I’m open about personal tough stuff on my social media. However, I do keep my professional struggles off social media. Patreon has given me an incredible opportunity to tell the full, real story. On my Instagram feed, you might see a photo of me singing on the same mic with John Prine at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. Looks awesome, right? On Patreon, you get the behind-the-scenes story of why I ended up on the same mic with John Prine (spoiler alert: that was not supposed to happen…at all), and why I was in a panic the whole time it was happening.\n\nWhat's the best bit of merchandise you have available?\n\nOh, that’s tough. I LOVE MERCH. I’m extremely proud of the limited edition red vinyl of Boomerang Town. I think I only have forty copies left.\n\nI’m also really proud of the Boomerang Town bandana designed by Jenni Earle. Jenni has an incredible story. When she was 22 she married a boy, followed him around the country, lost herself, and ended up hospitalized for mental health struggles. She found her way back to herself and launched a bandana business, inspired by the hours she spent with her Grandpa Earle hand-dying bandanas in his garage.\n\nMy friend Mike Schoenfield gave me one of Jenni’s bandanas in 2017 when I was going through a very difficult time. In the corner, it said “explore more.” That year, I went on an epic tour and traveled my little heart out. Jenni and I became internet friends and she started sending me a bandana every January. The talisman seemed to always magically pair perfectly with the year: “trust yourself,” “blaze a trail,” etc…\n\nWhen I came to Jenni with the idea of creating a “Love is Gonna Come Again” bandana I was thrilled when she said yes! Jenni hand designs and hand dyes each bandana. This has been a collaboration years in the works. I’m grateful that this record cycle created the opportunity to make it happen.\n\nWho’s an artist I need to check out?\n\nI’ve been on a big Wes Collins kick lately. Wes also has an incredible story. Wes was a stay-at-home dad for years while his wife had the primary career. Later in life, he went to school and became a librarian. At age 55 he entered the Kerrville New Folk songwriting competition and won! I fell in love with Wes’s songs and BEGGED him to let me sing with him. I was thrilled when he invited me to sing on his albums Welcome to the Ether and Jabberwockies. In all other circumstances, even though I’m really proud of my studio work, I HATE hearing my voice played back. Can’t stand it at all. It makes me way too self conscious. But I’m such a fan of Wes and his songs that I listen to his records all the time.\n\nI am also thoroughly obsessed with JaneLeo. Their live shows are epic. I think it’s really cool that both of our records will be released February 17th. If they’re playing near you, I suggest getting a ticket right now while you can still see them in small rooms. I anticipate world domination shortly.\n\nWe’re called Campfire Tales, tell us your best story.\n\nHonestly, I think the best story I’ve got is “Boomerang Town.”\n\nI was working at the supermart, when I fell for Julie, knocked her up\n\nLike everybody said I would\n\nThe day I turned sixteen I got that job, I couldn’t wait to buy a car, save enough\n\nLeave this town for good"
