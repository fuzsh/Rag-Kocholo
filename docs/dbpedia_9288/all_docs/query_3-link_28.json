        "text": "Biography\n\nBiographical Information About Jean Ritchie\n\nIt is impossible to place any one label on Jean Ritchie. She is a traditional musician by virtue of her life and works, but she is also a commercial performer, author, recording artist, composer, and folk music collector.\n\nRitchie was born in 1922 in Viper, Kentucky, into a family that considered music extremely important. In addition to singing as a means of entertainment, they had songs to accompany nearly all of their activities, from sweeping to churning to working in the fields. When they got together in the evening to sing as a family, they chose from a repertoire of more than 300 songs. Among them were hymns, traditional love songs and ballads, and popular songs by composers like Stephen Foster. For the most part, these songs were learned orally and sung without accompaniment.\n\nWhile much of the music that was to become central to Ritchie’s later performance repertoire originated at home, other influences on her musical development cannot be overlooked. Besides the songs of family and friends, she was exposed to the music of the Old Regular Baptist church meetings the family attended regularly and to popular culture, particularly radio and recording. It is interesting to note that the one thing absent from Ritchie’s musical background is formal training.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Viper, Ritchie attended Cumberland Junior College in Williamsburg, Ky. From there she went to the University of Kentucky, where she graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1946. With a bachelor’s degree in social work in hand, she moved to New York City to work at the Henry Street Settlement. There she drew on her knowledge of family songs to entertain the children in her charge.\n\nGradually, Ritchie’s reputation as a folk singer grew, and she was asked to perform more formally. (Many of these concert experiences are discussed in the video.) For folk music fans of the 1940s, Ritchie represented the ideal traditional performer: She grew up in the mountains of Kentucky, sang songs that she learned from her family, and played a little-known instrument called a dulcimer.\n\nRitchie has maintained an active performance schedule ever since. She has played and sung on radio and television, in concerts, and at folk festivals and hootenannies in the U.S. and abroad. As you will see in the program, her friends and acquaintances include many of the most recognizable people in the contemporary folk and country music scenes. When Ritchie’s album None But One won the Rolling Stone Critics’ Award in 1977, her acceptance into the popular mainstream was secured.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Ritchie’s career is her own songwriting. Central to her approach is a lesson learned early on from her uncle Jason. His practice of altering tunes from one verse to another in a song, and lyrics from one performance to the next, taught her to accept improvisation and variation as natural elements of traditional music. So her versions of both family songs and original compositions often vary slightly from one performance (or publication) to the next. And she often creates new songs by using bits of material from existing ones or adding newly composed verses to flesh out song fragments that she recalls from her childhood.\n\nRitchie was married to photographer George Pickow from 1950 until Pickow’s death in 2010. They had two sons, Peter, born in 1954, and Jonathan, born in 1958, and lived in Port Washington, New York. In 2009, Jean Ritchie suffered a stroke. She returned to Berea, Kentucky, where she lived until her death in 2015.\n\nSignificance to American Music\n\nJean Ritchie is extremely significant to traditional music in America as a performer, author, and composer. Besides launching what is usually referred to as the “dulcimer revival” through her performances and books (see The Dulcimer Book and Dulcimer People), she has influenced other folk and country singers, including the Judds and Tommy Makem, to explore their own musical roots. Through her professional visibility, Ritchie has been vital in awakening an interest in the music of Kentucky. And with her own compositions, she has proved an important spokesperson for the inequities of the Appalachian region.\n\nText by Karen L. Carter-Schwendler.

Singing was commonly accompanied by traditional instruments like the dulcimer, the banjo, and the fiddle.\n\nThe Dulcimer\n\nRitchie plays the Appalachian lap dulcimer, an instrument that is probably a descendant of the German Scheitholt, the Scandinavian langliek, and the French epinette de Vosges, brought to America by immigrants sometime in the 18th century. The lap dulcimer has three or four strings and a fretted fingerboard and is played with a plectrum of some sort. In the past this was often a feather, but nowadays it is most often a plastic pick.\n\nIn America, builders have made dulcimers in several different shapes, the most common being rectangular, teardrop, and hourglass. The hourglass-shaped instruments, like the one Ritchie typically plays in performance, have been created by makers in Kentucky as well as parts of Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nThe popularity of the dulcimer in the mountains has long been open to debate. While some folk song collectors have claimed that the instrument has always been rare in the mountains, even in the 20th century, Ritchie has a different view. Based on her own research, she has speculated that the dulcimer was the only instrument found in the region until the 1880s, and that these collectors did not see or hear them because they were looking for songs, not inquiring specifically about instrumental music.\n\nCertain cultural factors may also have had something to do with the “elusiveness” of the instrument. People living in the mountains were typically shy with regard to accomplishments. This “shyness and modesty” of instrument players was influenced by their religious beliefs. For Old Regular Baptists, lined-out hymn singing was the only music considered acceptable. Harmony was considered “frivolous” and instruments “sinful.” For example, the fiddle was long considered by many to be “the devil’s instrument,” and the banjo lost popularity with some people because it was associated most often with dance music.\n\nRitchie learned to play the dulcimer from her father when she was about 5 or 6 years old. She had covertly played around with the instrument earlier, so when her father actually “taught” her, he thought she was a “natural born musician.”\n\nWhen you watch Ritchie play, you will notice two things in particular that distinguish her style from others’. The first is the fact that when she strums the most important beats of the tune, she strums toward herself, not away like most other players. The second point has to do with her singing style. Listen carefully, and you will notice that while she sings the melody of a song, she usually plays a different melody, a “countermelody,” on the dulcimer to accompany it.\n\nText by Karen L.

What kind of music did you expect to hear Jean Ritchie sing? As you watched the program, were you surprised at all by the diversity of her career? Discuss this with the class.\n\nIn oral tradition, songs often change when they are transmitted from one person to the next. In our writing- and recording-based society today, it is difficult to experience this. To get the feel of it, try playing the game sometimes known as “whispering down the line.” Start at one end of the room and whisper a sentence to the next person, who whispers it to the next person and so on. What happens to the sentence by the time it has gone to the final person? How do changes occur? Through mishearing? Making up a word or phrase to compensate for something that is forgotten? “Improvements” or elaborations?\n\nEveryone hears and learns songs while they’re growing up, though probably not as many as Jean Ritchie did. What songs do you remember? Under what circumstances or in what situations were they sung? How did you learn them? Do you know the same songs as your classmates? As a class, make a list of “variant” versions of songs, sharing the different versions.\n\nDivide the class into pairs and have each pair of students discuss songs that they know. Each student should find one song that his or her partner does not know and then try to teach that song to the partner orally. Have the class discuss this experience. How easy was it to learn a song this way? Did the “teachers” have to repeat the song to the “learners” many times? Which element of the song was the easiest to learn: melody, lyrics, or rhythm? Which was the most difficult?\n\nWhat is your biggest musical influence? You might want to consider things like school, radio, MTV, recordings (CDs, cassettes, LPs), family gatherings, church, and live concerts. Do you listen to different types of music from these different sources? What kind of music is most important to you?\n\nKeep track of all the music you hear over the course of a weekend. (You might want to carry around a piece of paper and a pen so that you don’t miss anything.) Be sure to consider the context. Was the music generated by a live source, or was it recorded? Were you listening actively to the music—did you pay much attention to it? Or was it just part of the background? Did you have any negative reactions to music heard in any context? Share your findings with the class.\n\nText by Karen L. Carter-Schwendler.
