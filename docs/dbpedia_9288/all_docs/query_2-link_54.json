        "text": "David Nail is well-respected up and down Music Row. Some might even call him a “tour de force” as his songs pull no punches in evoking the demons with which he has wrestled through much of his life. The GRAMMY-nominated multi-platinum singer/songwriter’s early releases, I’m About To Come Alive, The Sound Of A Million Dreams, I’m A Fire and Fighter ignited his reputation as an innovator and creative risk-taker, yet left Nail feeling restless. This led to the departure from the only record company home he’d ever known, MCA Nashville, where he’d formed friendships that endure even now.\n\nThrough dealing with his own journey of mental health and the feeling of needing to “rebel against what people expect you to be,” Nail began making his most “organic” work to date, David Nail & The Well Ravens, with Jason Hall and Andrew Petroff. That project liberated Nail and propelled him into his next adventure. Writing solo for the next few months led to his debut solo independent EP Oh, Mother, a reflective piece of work. Of the title track, Rolling Stone noted that “the song creeps in like a sunrise — quiet, restrained cello and keys are the only underpinning for Nail’s powerful vocals at first. But then it slowly builds to something more massive and majestic.” That release was followed by Bootheel 2020 and Bootheel 2021, projects dedicated to the singer/songwriter’s hometown in the “bootheel” of Missouri. Nail released an EP titled Best of Me in 2023and the title track has seen heavy press support and country radio airplay. In Nail’s own words, “My philosophy has always been, I just hope to have a good enough year that I can have a next year while staying as true to myself as I possibly can.”\n\nHis most recent release If I Could Call was released this past March. We had the opportunity to sit down and chat with Nail before his performance at City Winery in Manhattan and found out a lot about his life, his music … and about him. This is his story.\n\nIn the heart of America's sprawling countryside, where the breeze carries whispers of old tales and the earth sings of simpler times, there exists a figure whose music embodies the very essence of rural life. That man is David Nail, a humble small-town guy from Kennett, Missouri who found himself playing country music because it was “what the Good Lord told him”. He’s an unpretentious guy whose lyrics ring true. We met with him before his show at City Winery this past March, where he talked to us about his upcoming single If I Could Call which was released on March 15th. It’s a beautifully personal and heartfelt song about grieving the passing of a loved one and wanting nothing more than to have the chance to speak to them again.\n\nNail first picked up his father’s guitar in 6th grade – it had only two strings on it. The first song he learned was (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction by the Rolling Stones. He continued learning how to play until he reached 6th or 7th grade and figured that he wouldn’t get much better than that! Country music wasn’t a choice but rather a lifestyle. In his words: “I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing.” There have been many moments where he’s tried to give up playing music and turn it in, but he said that The Good Lord has a way of pulling him back in. We observed right away that when he plays on stage he closes his eyes and gets lost in the music. Music helps him refocus and grounds him. It’s been a good journey – over 20 years in music while on the road for 15 of those years. In his own words: “I tried to quit to become a baseball umpire, but my father taught me to hate the Cubs and the Yankees.” Back to music he went.\n\nBetween the string picking and written words, music tells a much bigger picture, just like the vast fields he grew up around. Songwriting isn’t just about getting it all on paper. Nail's life gives breath to the words. “It’s hard to just make stuff up out of thin air.” A common theme in his songwriting is from the heart and pulling inspiration from home life. He feels that music is reflective. A big musical influence for David was Glen Campbell and Vince Gill - but his biggest influence was his father.\n\nNail's dad was a band director. Music has a remarkable ability to evoke memories and nostalgia: hearing a song from the past can transport listeners back to specific moments in their lives, accompanied by all the emotions and experiences associated with those memories. This leads us into his newest song about his grandfather. If I could call is written about a hypothetical conversation that he has with his grandfather who has passed away. At the end of the song he sings, “If I could call, I’d wipe the tears away and tell you about my only son who in the morning will be eight. If I could call, I’d tell you that the greatest thing I've ever done is give that boy your name.” Naming his son after his grandfather was not just touching but showed us his vast heart. This song came to him in one night, which is not something that happens for him very often. He usually writes when his wife gets into the bath and he goes to his office and picks up his guitar. In the video, you see him in the space where it started from nothing but became everything. It’s like the walls were talking to him. Hearing stories of his grandfather comforted him while traveling all over the Country.\n\nDavid Nail, with his moving deep voice and heartfelt lyrics, stands as a testament to the enduring power of country music to tell stories that resonate deeply with listeners. From the honky-tonks of Missouri to the grand stages of Nashville, Nail's journey is one of perseverance and an unwavering commitment to his craft. With each chord strummed and every word sung, he invites us into a world where honesty, vulnerability, and authenticity reign supreme. “The power of a song that hits you right” is hard to sing technically, emotionally, and psychically. A man who has sung them hundreds of times, mostly with his eyes closed as he performs. As we throw ourselves in the melodies and narratives woven by David Nail, we are reminded that the true essence of country music lies in its ability to capture the essence of life itself — its struggles, its triumphs, and everything in between. In the ever-changing landscape of the music industry, Nail remains a steadfast beacon of authenticity, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of fans old and new alike.\n\nFind more at www.davidnail.com"
