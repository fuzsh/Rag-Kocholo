For the seven years following the 1972 release of \"Back Stabbers,’ The O’Jays had a gold or platinum record every year and garnered three Grammy nominations for Best R&B Vocal Group. In 1990, the group won an American Music Award for Favorite R&B Group or Duo for their hit album, Emotionally Yours. With six platinum and eight gold LP’s including, Family Reunion, Message in the Music Ship Ahoy, So Full of Love and Travelin’ at the Speed of Thought, the talented trio has proven the test of time. With more than 50 hit singles released in their 40 year career, few people have earned the right to be called \"living legends.\" The O’Jays are one of them.\n\nThe Whispers, a talented group of vocalist has produced hits since 1962. In the seventies, they produced the R&B hit, \"One for the Money (Part 1). In 1987 \"Rock Steady\" written and produced by L.A. Reid and Babyface was their biggest pop hit of all time. Most recently their hits consist of \"My Heart, Your Heart\" which was #4 on the R& B chart in 1990 and \"Innocent\" which took #3. These successful artists have powerful voices that come together in amazing harmonies."
