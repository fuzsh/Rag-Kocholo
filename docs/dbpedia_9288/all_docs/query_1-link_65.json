        "text": "Through the long afternoon, Joshua Wyeth couldnât have missed the whispers of rebellion. Despite the chill on that winter day, Dec. 16, 1773, the 15-year-oldâs hometown of Boston was steaming. For years, resentment against Great Britain had been building in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Now that bottled-up anger was about to be unleashed on three ships in Boston Harbor and their main cargo: tea.\n\nA secret message made its way around the blacksmith shop where Joshua worked: The tea sitting on ships in Boston Harbor had to be destroyed. As night fell, about 100 men made their way through Bostonâs streets to Griffinâs Wharf, where the ships had docked. Teenage apprentices, including Joshua, filed in among them. Many of the men wore blankets or shawls, as they imagined Native Americans might.\n\nâWe had smeared our faces with grease and sootâ as a disguise, Joshua later recalled.\n\nPowerful British warships guarded the harbor. Would the ships fire on the men? Would soldiers come and throw them in jail?\n\nDespite the risks, the men went ahead. Under the cloak of darkness, they dumped some 90,000 pounds of tea into the dark water. Their bold action, known to history as the Boston Tea Party, sparked a chain of events that would lead to the birth of the United Statesâand forever change the world.\n\nThrough the long afternoon, Joshua Wyeth couldnât have missed the whispers of rebellion.

Their bold action is known to history as the Boston Tea Party. It sparked a chain of events that would lead to the birth of the United States. It would forever change the world.\n\nAbout 3,000 miles of ocean separated the Colonies and Britain, and for more than a century and a half, Britain let the Colonies mostly run things on their own. While Britainâs Parliament had appointed leaders to oversee them, the Colonies each had their own government, laws, and taxes.\n\nThe situation changed after the French and Indian War (1754-63), when Britain and France fought for control of North America. Britain won but ended up deeply in debt, so Parliament tried to raise money by taxing the colonists on goods they imported from other countries.\n\nBy 1767, those fees had raised the price of many essential items, including tea. Each new tax triggered anger over what many colonists called âtaxation without representation,â and groups of colonists responded by boycotting British goods.\n\nThe boycott on tea imported by Britainâs East India Company hit Britain especially hard. Most colonists switched to drinking tea smuggled in by Dutch and other traders. Stuck with warehouses of tea going bad, the East India Company was about to go broke.\n\nThen, in May 1773, Parliament passed the Tea Act, which allowed the East India Company to sell its tea more cheaply. British officials believed the move would persuade colonists to start buying it again, but many colonists burned with anger at Parliamentâs attempt to control them.\n\nA Boston leader named Samuel Adams seized the opportunity. Americaâs British colonies had largely operated independently from each other, but Adams believed that outrage over the Tea Act could convince them to unite against Britain once and for all.\n\nAbout 3,000 miles of ocean separated the Colonies and Britain.

Americaâs British colonies had largely operated independently from each other. Adams believed that outrage over the Tea Act could convince them to unite against Britain once and for all.\n\nBy October 1773, word came that seven ships carrying East India Company tea were heading for the Coloniesâ four largest ports: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston. No one knew how long it would take the ships to arriveâor which port theyâd reach first.\n\nOn October 16, colonists in Philadelphia passed a resolution vowing to send the tea back to Britain. Groups in the other port towns made the same promise.\n\nOn November 28, the Dartmouth, the first of the seven ships, entered Boston Harbor. Handbills soon appeared all over town: âFriends! Brethren! Countrymen! That worst of plagues, the detested tea, shipped for this Port by the East India Company, is now arrived.â\n\nDetermined to stick to their promise, some Boston colonists appointed a guard to patrol the docks. No tea would come off that ship.\n\nBut they knew the guard was only a temporary solution. Under British law, the colonists had just 20 daysâuntil December 17âto pay the import duties before the tea would be confiscated and sold by British customs officers to pay the taxes.\n\nBy October 1773, word came that seven ships carrying East India Company tea were heading for the Coloniesâ four largest ports: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.

If they didnât pay, the tea would be confiscated and sold by British customs officers to pay the taxes.\n\nOn December 16, as many as 6,000 peopleâabout a third of Bostonâs populationâpacked into the Old South Meeting House. By then, two other ships carrying tea had also arrived in the harbor. With the deadline quickly approaching, no tea had left the ships. Adams, John Hancockâa Boston merchant and later the first person to sign the Declaration of Independenceâand other leaders vowed to keep the tea from being unloaded. The rowdy crowd stamped its feet and roared its approval.\n\nAs dusk arrived, the gathering began to disperse. People leaving the meeting hall sensed a restless energy.\n\nâLet every man do what is right in his own eyes!â Hancock said, according to some accounts. Someone else allegedly called out, âBoston Harbor\n\na teapot this night!â\n\nOn December 16, as many as 6,000 peopleâabout a third of Bostonâs populationâpacked into the Old South Meeting House.

Someone else allegedly called out, âBoston Harbor a teapot this night!â\n\nFor Joshua Wyeth and other teens, the call to action was irresistible. Henry Purkitt, about 18, heard a loud whistle through the open door of the barrel makerâs shop where he worked. He joined the crowd surging toward Griffinâs Wharf.\n\nSamuel Sprague, 20, met some friends on the street who told him what was happening. He followed them to the harborâwhere he found his bricklayer employer had already joined the crowd.\n\nNot all bosses were as understanding. Peter Slaterâs locked him in a room to keep him from going, but the 13-year-old crawled out a window to get to the action.\n\nAs the men began boarding the ships, they found big chests of tea below the decks and hauled themâsome weighing as much as 400 poundsâonto the deck with ropes. Some men used axes to smash the chests to pieces while others dumped the loose tea overboard.\n\nFor Joshua Wyeth and other teens, the call to action was irresistible.

There were 46 tons of it. âI never labored harder in my life,â Joshua recalled later.\n\nThe tide was low. The tea leaves bunched up in the shallow water like grass in a new-mown field. Some of the boys waded in to break up the clumps with poles or their hands and feet. From the wharf, a crowd of at least 1,000 Bostonians watched.\n\nIn less than three hours, the work was done. Then everyone melted back into the night.\n\nWord of Bostonâs defiance electrified resistance in the other ports. When a ship arrived in Charleston later that month, local men seized its tea and locked it up so it couldnât be sold.\n\nThe captains of other tea ships headed for Philadelphia and New York were so unnerved that they turned around and sailed back to England. The movement of resistance continued to spread.\n\nFor Britain, the acts of destruction were the last straw. Beginning in March 1774, Parliament passed laws known as the Coercive Acts to punish the Colonies.\n\nThe first law closed Boston Harbor until the town paid for the destroyed teaâvalued at about $1.5 million today. With ships unable to pass in or out, many local businesses were devastated.\n\nParliamentâs crackdown only inflamed resistance. In September 1774, representatives from 12 of the 13 Colonies met in Philadelphia. Whatâs now known as the First Continental Congress formally demanded an end to the Coercive Acts. Parliament refused.\n\nBut as the divide with Britain grew, the Colonies grew closer. The acts of rebellion âhelped to unite the Colonies for war and independence,â says historian Benjamin Carp. It was exactly what Adams had hoped for.\n\nâThe distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more,â Virginia delegate Patrick Henry said at the Continental Congress. âI am not a Virginian, but an American.â\n\nWithin months, the Americans and the British were at war and on July 4, 1776, the Colonies declared independence. Seven years later, the American Revolution ended with a victory by the United States.\n\nJoshua joined the Revolution, fighting in several battles. In 1826, at nearly 70 years old, he became one of the first people to tell a reporter a long-held secretâthe role he and others had played decades earlier in an incident involving tea.
