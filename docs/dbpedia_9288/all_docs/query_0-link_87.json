        "text": "102\n\nThe United States State Department is reaching into Oklahoma to gather stories about democracy. Former Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett, who works with Jones PR, spoke via Zoom to a full house in Kampala, Uganda who wanted to hear examples of democracy in action.\n\nCornett discussed his predecessors and their abilities to create partnerships between the public and private sectors. He also stressed the importance of transparency and citizen engagement through in-person meetings and social media.\n\nThe conversation lasted nearly two hours with Cornett reminding the group that it’s important for government to “do what it says it will do.”"
