        "text": "PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) -- Ashley Audrain, the author of the 2021 powerhouse women’s fiction debut, THE PUSH, returns to the podcast to talk with Olivia about her new novel, THE WHISPERS. THE WHISPERS takes us to an affluent street where we experience life, frustration, marriage concerns, parenting failures, heartbreaks, tragedies, embarrassment, suspicions, all through the eyes (and whispers) of four women: Whitney, Blair, Rebecca and Mara.\n\nAshley says her experience during the restrictions of the pandemic helped to shape the novel. “Your world became so small, your world was only as big as what you could see outside your front window, which was your neighbor and your neighboring houses. I think we all became a little more intimate and closer with the people we lived in proximity with, that was very much on my mind when I was writing the characters of this book and their settings on the street” she says.\n\nTHE WHISPERS is out now from Pamela Dorman/Viking and is also available in audio.

Newman says in describing the premise of this summer’s new novel, DROWNING. The writer returns to the podcast to talk with Olivia about battling the pressures of following up her debut bestseller, and her gratitude for the opportunity to live her dream as a full-time writer. A former bookseller and flight attendant, Newman’s commercial airline centered thrillers sparked bidding wars in publishing and in Hollywood. This time around, deadline pressures were as intense as the burden of expectation, but Newman said she loved writing this intensely emotional book: “At its core, this story would not work if it were not a story of grief and loss and hope and survival and a family coming together” she says. DROWNING is published by Avid Reader Press, available for pre-order before its May 30, 2023 release. Newman will be signing books at Changing Hands Bookstore, where she used to work, on Monday May 29, 2023. She’ll be at The Poisoned Pen Bookstore the following night.

THE TRUE LOVE EXPERIMENT is a stand alone novel focused on “Fizzy” aka Felicity Chen, who readers first met in their instant bestseller THE SOULMATE EQUATION. “No two people complete each other, it is who is perfect for our heroine or our hero,” says Christina, and in this book it’s the divorced dad/documentary producer Conner who is clearly meant for Fizzy. The way the relationship unfolds slowly, Lauren explains, is what makes it good. “What more fun can you imagine than taking that person who thinks she knows everything about love and showing her that maybe that’s not actually true… they really became friends,” she says. THE TRUE LOVE EXPERIMENT is out May 16, 2023 from Gallery Books.

Not a genre Olivia was familiar with before reading his 2023 book THE WATCHMAKER’S DAUGHTER, Larry joined the podcast to talk about his approach to telling true stories that read like fiction. “I like thrillers, that’s what’s fun for me to read, turning the page, getting your heart rate going, so I just merged the two genres.” Larry spends at least a year on research before beginning to write his books- and telling Corrie Ten Boom’s story was no different. Once he completes his extensive research, he exercises his creativity in the formatting and pacing of the story. He takes no creative license with the details: “I can’t make anything up. What I can do is decide when chapters end, that’s up to me. When there’s a dead body, a gun, a briefcase stolen… then, I can end the chapter there. The reader says, ‘wait, wait, what happened? That’s what a thriller is.” Larry Loftis is the author of: THE PRINCESS SPY, CODE NAME: LISE, INTO THE LION’S MOUTH, and 2023′s THE WATCHMAKER’S DAUGHTER, published by William Morrow and is also available as an audiobook from Harper Audio.\n\nAnastasia Ryan, “You Should Smile More”: Vanessa Blair is most definitely not living her dream life. She’s working as a telemarketer for a judgmental tyrant who wants her out because of her RBF. Her facial expression aside, she’s done everything expected of the employees and then some (hello, office Olympics?) For fans of movies like Office Space and the classic 9-5, Anastasia Ryan’s debut novel YOU SHOULD SMILE MORE is laugh out loud funny and disturbingly relatable to most anyone who has worked in a company claiming to embrace a meaningful corporate culture. When Vanessa and her peers turn her termination into a challenge, they learn from the tenets of THE ART OF WAR, realize that friendships were the true perk of the job, and find a way to a happier ending that can incorporate gainful employment, kittens, and maybe even love. Anastasia talks to Olivia about the jobs and interviews that inspired her story, her own history as a foster mom to kittens, and why being an introvert feels like an obstacle to selling books!

The intense emotion of uncertainty of what to believe is what propelled the narrative of William Landay’s 2012 bestselling novel DEFENDING JACOB, recently adapted as a limited series for Apple TV+. More than ten years later, Landay is back with a new family drama that also involves the courtroom. ALL THAT IS MINE I CARRY WITH ME begins with the disappearance of a suburban mother of three, Miranda Larkin, spouse of a prominent criminal defense attorney. The investigation, fears, suspicions, and absence of the matriarch and questions of the father’s involvement fuel the moving story that spans decades, grappling with the uncertainty of never knowing what to truly believe. “It is human beings in a jury box, human beings who are judges and lawyers, and mistakes are made. So I wanted to capture some of that uncertainty – which is a difficult thing, when working toward a conclusion is the whole heart of the story,” Landay says as he joins Olivia on the podcast. He shares the journey over the years to write his fourth novel, and what advice he has for other writers who sometimes find the craft full of challenges. ALL THAT IS MINE I CARRY WITH ME published in hardcover by Bantam Books, and is available in audio.

Sarah talks with Olivia about her past career and the perk of traveling regularly to London, where she says, “she felt like I’d lived a previous life there. I felt so enchanted by the old brick alleyways... really enamored of it all. I knew I wanted to set my first book there and ended up setting THE LONDON SEANCE SOCIETY there as well.” Sarah talks about researching her Victorian-era novel, writing strong female characters like Lenna and Vaudeline, and her own adventure gaining perspective of a séance, digging deeper into what grieving people are seeking when they desire connection with those who have passed, and how those emotions can make us vulnerable.
