        "text": "Grace Massoud wrote this article in MTV website:\n\nIn my last two articles, I’ve recounted the most valuable life lessons imparted a month ago by none other than Oprah Winfrey, and this one is la crème de la crème. In case you were wondering, and at some point, we all wonder, trusting your intuition is the only way to get on the right path in life. Trusting that the universal force of life is speaking and breathing through you.\n\nWe should roll up our sleeves and do the work on ourselves, which is always spiritual, and this will lead us where we need to go.\n\nYou may or may not be aware that success leaves clues. Follow the yellow brick road and you will get to your final destination. God speaks first in a whisper and it is up to us to listen intently to what he is trying to tell us. As Oprah shrewdly explains, in problematic situations there are three stages, the whisper, the brick wall and the tsunami. Most people don’t pay attention to the whispers and only notice when the brick hits them upside the head, when they’re in full-blown problem mode. Some don’t do anything about the problem when they notice it and get stuck. That’s when it turns catastrophic and all hell breaks loose. The tsunami is here. The moral of the story is to catch the problem at the whisper so you don’t cause yourself unnecessary pain. If you see the red flag in the guy right from the start, don’t dismiss it, don’t bury the whisper telling you what is going to eventually cause the break up. The most successful people are the ones who are quick to make the tough decisions and quick to move on from what doesn’t work to what does.\n\nAlong the way, bear these vital teachings in mind:\n\nAsk God to use you as a tool for something bigger than yourself, to show you how to do it. Do good in the world. Shine the light don’t carry darkness.\n\nFind what brings you peace, calmness, that comforting space within you and around you. That’s how you know if someone or something is right for you.\n\nBe assured that worthiness is a position of power in life. It makes you receptive to all blessings, and kinder to yourself and others.\n\nTo thine own self be true.\n\nDelight thyself also in the Lord and He shall give you the desires of your heart. Psalms 37:4\n\nPick a career that even if you didn’t get paid, you’d still be doing it.\n\nOwning your own brand is true freedom.\n\nWhat you put out is always going to come back.\n\nDon’t dream the dream. Let God (or the universe) dream the dream for you and you just step into it.\n\nTo wrap it up, the Great Teaching of Oprah’s life brought a sigh of relief to me as I tend to cause myself grief when a desired outcome seems like is never going to arrive despite my better efforts. She advises to do the work, give it all you’ve got, and let the joy of delivering the work to the world be your reward, for the real joy is in the offering. No attachment whatsoever to the outcome. Do what you gotta do and let it go. When we fight, when we try to control the result or how something is supposed to look like, we suffer. Surrender to God. Give it to God."
