        "text": "THE whispers had begun at least as far back as when he was in college, that the gym rat liked to have a few beers, and then a few more than that.\n\nIt wouldn't be so startling considering his environment and culture - a young man, a star athlete, an urban setting - nor would it be unheard of for one in his position to go beyond alcohol.\n\nThe whispers traveled with Chris Mullin after he left St. John's University. Could it be true of, of all people, this gym rat, this guy with such a pale complexion that it was said he never saw the sun because he spent so many hours in the gym?\n\nGym rat. A name said with affection and respect. It was a humorous and somehow fitting image for Chris Mullin's tenacity and desire and discipline and dedication to basketball - essaying to fulfill his considerable potential as a player.\n\n''Chris Mullin,'' some said, ''you can't get him out of the gym.''\n\nIndeed, few played the game better. After his senior year in 1985 he had been awarded the John Wooden trophy as the best college basketball player in the land. But the rumors of abuse accompanied him cross-country to California where, as a first-round draft choice, the 6-foot-7-inch guard joined the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association. AROUND the league, as Mullin shifted into his second and third seasons, the stories persisted. The Knicks were considering making a trade for the hometown lad, but, as Al Bianchi, the Knick general manager, said, ''We heard the rumors and the red light went up.''\n\nFrom the statistics, Mullin was on the upswing on the court. As a rookie, his scoring average was 14 points a game, then 15 a game last season, and now it was 17.6.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
