In Their Words: “I love walks in nature, because when we can’t find the answers to our complicated lives nature will often bring us comfort. Rivers have always been a symbol of peace, hope, and love, for many years. While traveling and playing music with the legendary Tom Gray he encouraged me to go river kayaking with him, and it turned out to be a spiritual experience for me during a time of healing. This song was beautifully written by Claire Ulanoff and Marissa DiBlassio.” — Valerie Smith
