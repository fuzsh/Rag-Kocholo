        "text": "About the Location :\n\nStella Maris means the star of the Sea and this name suits beautifully to this Church. Stella Maris Church is situated on the coastal banks of Arabian Sea. It is very close to Malpe natural harbor of Udupi district, Karnataka, India.\n\nThe star of the sea guides the navigator during their voyage and restores hopes and aspirations in them and shows them the directions of the land where they have to reach.\n\nStella Maris Church of Kalmady being a great pilgrim center, like the morning star guides the devotees of Jesus and Mother Mary to give up their sinful life and to follow the path of prayers, truthfulness, nobility, love and sacrifice and to walk on the footsteps of Jesus. So it helps the sinners to give up their evil ways, bad habits and helps them to come out of it and lead a good life.\n\nKalmady being a small village was totally unknown to the outside people. But now because of Stella Maris Church and the lady of Velankanni Shrine, it has become a great pilgrim Centre. Today Kalmady has marked its own boundary in the world map. People from all over the world come to this Church seeking favors from our lady of Velankanni and when they receive favors again they come here with the gratitude to give thanks. So the place Kalmady which is chosen by God himself has become a place of miracles and devotion and has brought in communal harmony and brotherhood here.\n\nKalmady is the place chosen by God and Lady of Velankanni to cure the sick , to uplift the downtrodden, needy, poor and people who are addicted to excessive alcohol and drugs. There are evidences to show that some people who have become desperate because of their bad habits wanted to commit suicide came and stayed here and got cured. Now they are working in different parts of the world and have become the bread winners of the family because of prayer and counseling given by the Parish priest Fr. Alban D’Souza.\n\nThe beginning :\n\nBefore 1972 there was no church in Kalmady. People of Kalmady had to go to Udupi Mother of Sorrows Church or St. Anne Church, Tottam for their religious needs .Both the places are far from Kalmady. That time there were no proper bus services and people had to walk the 8 km distance. Children and aged people were finding it really difficult. The financial conditions of the people were also not good at that time. They couldn’t afford to go by bus so they decided to have a church in Kalmady and were praying for it, as in the Bible said knock and it will open. Pray and you will get it. So they prayed and the prayers reached God the almighty and were answered by God.\n\nRev. Fr Charles D’Souza , the founder of Stella Maris Church Kalmady being a native of Kalmady knew all the pains, problems ,difficulties and grievances of the people of Kalmady as he too had undergone the same trials. He was the commander in the Indian Navy. Even from his childhood he had a strong desire to become a priest. After completing his BA Honours degree in maths at St. Aloysius College Mangalore, he joined the Indian Navy and became a commander in the Indian Navy . To fulfill his dream of becoming a priest, he took voluntary retirement from the Navy at the age of 50, went to Rome, studied in Beda college for priesthood, got ordained by Pope Paul VI and became a priest. He wanted to help the people of Kalmady for their religious needs by building a church. For that he bought a field from Cecilia D’Lima from his own money and donated it in the name of his mother Mrs. Lucy D’Souza to build a church. Then with the help and cooperation of the people, he built the church out of his own money and also from the donation given by the people. While building the church many people of Kalmady worked hard and extended their helping hands.\n\nThis Chapel was blessed by Bishop Basil D’Souza on 5th February 1972. Then it was under Udupi Parish and priests from Udupi and Kalyanpur were coming here to offer Sunday mass.\n\nFormation of the parish :\n\nDuring the reign of Fr. Joseph Tauro who was the Parish priest of Udupi ,Priest house was built at Kalmady in the church compound and was blessed on 15th May 1986. Fr. Dennis Castelino was the first residing Parish priest of Kalmady and he took charge in June 1987. On 1st January 1991 Decree was given by the Bishop and since then Kalmady became an independent Parish.\n\nOn 15th of August 1988 the Statue of Our Lady of Velankanni donated by Father Wilson D’Souza was brought from Velankanni to be installed in Kalmady Church. On August 15, 1988 it was blessed in Mother of Sorrows Church Udupi and was brought to Kalmady in a grand procession and was installed here by Bishop Basil D’Souza. Since then it has become a great shrine and pilgrim center.\n\nAfter Fr. Dennis Castelino, Fr. Robert Pinto took charge of the parish and during his time the altar was renovated.\n\nThen came Fr. Ivan D’mello ,a great disciplinarian. He tried his level best to build a cemetery (graveyard) in Kalmady. Appeals were sent to concerned authorities for permission. He had to face a lot of opposition from people because they thought if a graveyard is built, their land rates will come down. Though Udupi municipality gave the permission once, immediately it withdrew it because of people’s opposition. So he and the Vice president of the church parish council Mrs. Flavia Mathias took the matter to High Court and after some years they won the case in the High Court and in the later years a beautiful Graveyard was built during the time of Jesuits and Mr Louis Lobo was the vice president of parish council then.\n\nFr. Ivan D’mello bought the adjoining field of one Hindu person by name Achyuta who gave his land at concessional rate for the church. Mrs. Flavia Mathais Vice President and Mr Philip Andrade got it registered to the church. After buying the land the compound wall was put up. There also father Fr. Ivan D’mello had to face a lot of problems. That time nobody even imagined that God had made them buy that land and God’s plan to build this new boat shaped Church there was wonderful.\n\nAfter Fr. Ivan D’mello, the Jesuits took charge of the parish and during that time the Church flourished. Fr. Richard Mascarenhas , Fr.Maxim and Fr. Joseph D’Souza were the Jesuits Parish priest here.\n\nAfter that again the administration of Kalmady Church came to the hands of secular priest. On 4th June 2012 came the great captain and great sculptor of Kalmady Church who is an architect too who changed the entire picture and scenario of Kalmady church . He is none other than Reverend Fr Alban D’Souza . This priest was sent by God himself to build a new Church for his honour in Kalmady. Fr Alban D’Souza is known for his healing prayers and counseling. He is a priest of prayers and penance. He used to help people who are sick and are in need.\n\nFr. Alban D’Souza was sent to Kalmady with a mission to build a new Church here because the religious heads had noted that people from far and wide are coming to Kalmady for prayer and Kalmady needs a bigger Church beside Malpe to Shimoga Road Central highway would get extended and it will come up to the steps of present existing Church. Realizing the need to build a new Church to meet the needs of pilgrims worldwide, they sent Fr. Alban D’Souza as a Parish priest of Kalmady. He took charge as a Parish priest on 4th June 2012. So God has sent the right person at the right time to meet the needs of people like Moses was sent by God to take people to the promised land.\n\nFr. Alban D’Souza was a great Counselor too and a lot of people used to come here for his counseling and prayers. Lot of miracles have taken place in Stella Maris Church Kalmady. Instances of Blood cancer, Brain cancer were cured after praying here though the doctors of well-known hospitals had lost hopes saying it cannot be cured . Tissue less patients have got children. Things which looked impossible were made possible by God here. Visas and jobs in foreign countries were obtained after playing here.\n\nAfter coming to Kalmady Fr.Alban D’Souza put the matter of beginning a new Church in front of the people and it was happily accepted by the people. It was a great project of 6 to 7 Crores of Rupees and collecting money was a very hard job. But Fr. Alban took up the challenge to build that mighty Church and got it completed with the support of parishioners and donors.\n\nSilver Jubilee celebration of Stella Maris Church :\n\nSilver jubilee of Stella Maris Church was celebrated on August 15, 2013.\n\nDr Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi Diocese presided over the Holy Eucharistic Mass along with Monsignor Baptist Menezes, vicar general of Udupi Diocese, Fr Valerian Mendonca, Chancellor of Udupi Diocese, Fr Stany B Lobo, rector of Milagres Cathedral, Kallianpur, Fr Fred Mascarenhas, dean of Udupi Deanery, Fr Anil D’Souza, dean of Kundapur Deanery, Fr Alban D’Souza, parish priest of Stella Maris Church, Kalmady, and architect of Kalmady and Fr Denis Castelino as the co-celebrants.\n\nFrom August 6, in preparations for the grand festival, nine days of the Novena of Vailankanni were carried out.\n\nBishop Lobo blessed the foundation stone for the new church.\n\nAfter the mass there was a small formal stage function with Bishop Lobo presiding.

The Noah’s Ark is a biblical story, tells how all creation was safeguarded from being destroyed in flood.

The image of Our Lady of Vailankani is carved on the Bell.\n\nJust like the lighthouse guides sailors to the shore, the bell tower symbolizes being a ‘guide’. While the world is compared to a sea of temptation, the tower and the bell aim to remind people that Jesus saves us when we call upon him.\n\nAlso, Udupi being a coastal town, the boat-shaped church and the bell tower adds more charm to the city. A climb to the top of the tower provides a scenic view of the beautiful Kalmady surrounded by small ponds and lush fields.\n\nInauguration of Grotto and honorary pillar :\n\nThe honorary pillar and grotto of Our Lady of Velankanni was blessed and inaugurated at Stella Maris Church, Kalmady by Dr Gerald Isaac Lobo, bishop, Udupi Diocese on March 9, 2019.
