        "text": "Bishop Gerald Isaac Lobo of Udupi Diocese inaugurated the Jubilee Yātra (Pilgrimage), a journey of the heart, on October 27, 2023, in Udupi, India.\n\n“The Jubilee Yātra, Pilgrimage of Hope, is not just a gathering; it is a transformative experience that aims to bring priests, religious, and lay faithful together on a shared path of reflection, renewal, and rekindling hope, \"Bishop Lobo said.\n\nHe added that \"this significant event is organized under the auspices of the Jubilee 2025 Desk of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India in collaboration with 132 dioceses across the country.\"\n\nBefore the celebrations start in November 2025, Father Yesu Karunanidhi, the CCBI Commission for the Bible Coordinator and Synod Leader for the Ordinary Jubilee 2025, will visit 132 dioceses of the Church of India.\n\nIt is not a Yātra (pilgrimage) on foot, but a pilgrimage of the heart, a spiritual voyage that seeks to unite believers across the country and to share their hope, said the bishop.\n\nRenewal, reflection, and consciousness are milestones on the journey.\n\nThe Jubilee Yātra has the following objectives:\n\n(i) To disseminate the information concerning the Ordinary Jubilee 2025 and integrate it with the Synod for a Synodal Church so that more people are brought to'synodal 'consciousness' as our Hope Father Pope Francis puts it.\n\n(ii) To introduce the documents of the Second Vatican Council, especially the Four Constitutions, by bringing out the key themes and making them contextual to the life realities of the people.\n\n(iii) To familiarize the Catholic faithful with different forms and methods of prayer. All these objectives will lead to the goal of the ordinary Jubilee 2025: that we become ‘pilgrims of hope’ in the Church and the world.\n\n120 priests and religious leaders attended Anugraha, an event put on by the new Pastoral Center of the Diocese of Udupi.\n\nParticipants were introduced by the treasurers of the Second Vatican Council after a brief introduction to the synod for a synodal Church and Jubilee 2025.\n\nSister Lincy, a participant, said, “For the first time, I heard about the Documents of the Second Vatican Council, and they are really challenging.”\n\n“Our Church would have already become synodal if we had lived out the teachings of the Second Vatican Council a while ago,” the priest said.\n\nOn the solemnity of Christ the King, November 26, 2023, the Church in India officially inaugurates the Jubilee 2025 preparations.\n\nJubilee 2025 celebrations will be integrated with the synod on synodality and the CCBI strategic planning synod; the Jubilee 2025 logo will be unfurled; and the Jubilee Prayer will be recited."
