There are around 1000 Christian families attached to this Church and many institutions who spread the great values to others. The people who relate to it and its vision and mission would bring about an admirable change in themselves and in the life of the other.\n\nOur Church is dedicated to Mother of Sorrows who helps us relate to God to offer our prayers, supplications and anxieties to our creator. Our Church has served not only Christians but people of all faiths in very many different ways such as social, spiritual, educational and material needs. People come to her abode seeking intervention of Mother Mary in all their life aspirations and we all are instrumental in bringing them together to build a society where love, peace, justice and unity prevails.\n\nWe are blessed to be in the abode of Mother Mary. God has embedded us with great talents in every facet of the society. God has helped us to build this community of love through our consistent efforts and through his blessings. We remember our forefathers who have lived their faith and sacrificed a lot for us, so that we could continue to keep up that spirit in faith and service. We are blessed to be your pastors to present God to you through our service of love. We have experienced it from you at this Church. We sincerely thank you for what you are to us.\n\nAs we launch this upgraded website based on the present day needs we wish that all our people, small, young and old may come together and utilize this media to the utmost benefit. Thus we celebrate life in and around our Patron Mother Mary and the God we believe. We priests and religious along with you all the faithful shall build a community of love. Let this social media unite us all to be in the service of each other in the example of Jesus Christ our Master. God bless you all.\n\nV. Rev. Fr Charles Menezes\n\nParish Priest"
