It has been serving the faithful spread in over 160 parishes in Udupi, Kasargod, and Mangalore.\n\n\"The diocese of Mangalore has a large number of parishes and there was a feeling among the faithful in the parishes that they were not getting personal and individual pastoral care,\" said the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI).\n\nAccording to a CBCI release, the demand for separate Udupi diocese became stronger when the Udupi revenue district was formed about a decade ago.\n\nUdupi is a popular pilgrimage centre and tourist spot, and is situated on the coastal belt."
