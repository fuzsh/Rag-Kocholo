        "text": "Christians across Udupi district gathered in their respective parishes and participated in Easter Vigil on Saturday.\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the Udupi Catholic Diocese here, the main celebration of the diocese was held at the Milagres Cathedral Kallianpur under the leadership of Most Rev. Dr. Gerald Isaac Lobo, Bishop of Udupi.\n\nThe liturgy of the Easter Vigil began at 7 p.m. outside the cathedral. The lights were switched off, and the fire was lit. With the blessing of the new fire, the Paschal candle was lit and it was carried inside the cathedral. As the Paschal candle was placed on its stand in the sanctuary, the lights in the cathedral were switched on. Dicon Denis Miranda of the cathedral, chanted the Exsultet, also called the “Easter Proclamation”.\n\nThe next part of the Easter Vigil was the Liturgy of the Word during which four readings from the Old Testament were taken up, each followed by a responsorial hymn and prayer by the main celebrant.\n\nThe four readings were: The story of Creation from the Book of Genesis; Crossing of the Red Sea from the Exodus; a passage from Isaiah and another from Ezekiel. This was followed by a reading from the Letter of St. Paul to the Romans and the Gospel passage taken from St. Mark. After singing “Gloria” accompanied by ringing bells and the main church bell, two readings from the New Testament were read.\n\nIn his homily, Dr. Lobo emphasised the fact that the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day after being crucified was the foundation of the Christian faith which could not be shaken by anyone. The Apostles, who were filled with fear after the crucifixion of Jesus, experienced the Risen Christ and became bold and vocal, and began to spread the good news. After the homily, the water was blessed following the recitation of the Litany of the Saints. Once again, people lit their candles as they renewed the Baptismal Vows following which the Bishop and priests sprinkled newly blessed Holy Water on the congregation.\n\nAt the end of the solemn Easter Mass, Fr. Stany B. Lobo, Rector of the cathedral, extended the greetings of Easter to all and invoked the blessings of the Risen Christ on all the parishioners. He also thanked each and everyone who had helped in the smooth conduct of all the services during the Holy week."
