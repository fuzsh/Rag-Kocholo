        "text": "The Catholic Sabha took its birth on 29th April 1979.\n\nWhy was the Catholic Sabha established?\n\nAfter the second Vatican council our Mangalore Diocese, hailed as the Rome of the East, gave the desired importance to the laity and was the first Diocese in India to set up the Parish Pastoral Councils. In order to educate the newly elected members of these councils on their mission and to give them the training seminars were held in three batches under the leadership of rev. Fr. Stanely R. Pereira, then director of the Canara Communication centre. 122 representatives from 67 parishes of 13 Varados attended these seminars. One of the things that sprouted from these seminars was the thought to have, like the associations in other faiths, a laity organization in Mangalore. Accordingly a committee named “Navachethana “was formed to give a definite shape to this thought.\n\nThe important decisions taken by this committee were as follows:\n\nChristians must take an active part in Politics.\n\nWe must fight unitedly against the hardships and problems that come upon our community.\n\nTo fight against the O.P Thyagi bill the Govt.\n\nTo convene a laity meet on 29th April 1979 at Udupi.\n\nAs per the decision to convene a laity meet on 29th April 1979 at Udupi invitations we prepared and sent to the Parish Pastoral Council members of all the 126 parishes in the Diocese. 180 representatives from 88 parishes attended this Meet. Most Rev. Dr. Basil S. D’souza, the them Bishop of Mangalore inaugurated this Meet. A decision to found the Catholic Sabha was taken at this Meet and an ad - hoc committee was formed with Sri Oscar Fernandes as its President and Sri Alban Rodrigues as the secretary. A committee of six members was also formed to draft the constitution of the Catholic Sabha and an office was set up at the Don Bosco Club, Udupi.\n\nThe beautiful prayer recited that day is recited even to this day at the parish units, varado committees and the central committee.\n\nThis prayer is:\n\n“O, heavenly father, do stay with us here with your beloved son, Jesus Christ and the Holy spirit. Enlighten our minds; give us the strength to think rightly, to take the decisions that place you, to understand and put into practice the laws assigned for the laity. Mary our mother dear, lead us forward unitedly. We promise you that we will put into practice the decisions we take and strive hard to be the true followers of Christ. We pray that this promise and our work may be pleasing to you”.\n\nGod Almighty as made us move forward with his divine protection to his day. We thank God Almighty for this which is the fruit of our prayer achieved through the power of the holy spirit. As the foundation of the catholic sabha was laid on solid hard rock it has with stood all the storms of problems of difficulties and has stood firm.\n\nWe know that the flow of water in rivers sometimes becomes less and sometimes it over flows with floods, but the flow of water continues to remain. In the same way the catholic Sabha with all the ups and downs continues to move forward.\n\nIn the initial stages the Catholic Sabha had to encounter many problems for its growth. as there are problems for the growth of the new-born child. And the founders had faced them all to bring the catholic Sabha to its present stature.\n\nThe founders, in the initial stages, used to go to difficult parishes every Sunday to meet the people and tell them about the catholic sabha. Some parish priest welcomed them and extended their co-operation. In other parishes they had to be satisfied meeting only some lay leaders. These lay leaders wielded their influence on others and created the right atmosphere to establish the units of the sabha. Thus the Sabha grew gradually and started giving its service at the unit, Varado and the central levels. Today it has a membership of nearly 20,000 in both the Dioceses. At present though there is no Province as such the units and the Varados are very strong.\n\nThe Catholic sabha is a registered body. The Catholic Sabha was registered under the society of Register Act in 1987. It is affiliated to the AICU at the CBCI level. Thus it has gained the national recognition and a place of honor.\n\nThe Aim of the catholic Sabha:\n\nService, sacrifice and Unity.\n\nIts mission as per the desire of the second Vatican council, the laity and the religions conjointly forming an organized, strong and alert community for the good of the community and for the great glory of god.\n\nBasic objective:\n\nOrganization through awareness.\n\nChristians should be in the main stream of the society without remaining se\n\nShould be active in native building\n\nShould raise the slandered of living of the brothers and sisters of our community\n\nShould give support to them at the time of their anxieties and needs.\n\nShould improve their educational, social, economic and cultural standards.\n\nKeeping these objectives in mind a particular them should be taken every year and plans should be formulated and work must be done to achieve this theme.\n\nSo far 20 central presidents have given their valuable services to the sabha. it is our hope that many more such president may come in the times to come.\n\nThe work done\n\nHas created political awareness, given education on politics and prepared for political movement.\n\nHas given career guidance\n\nHas formed self-help groups for economic development.\n\nPlayed a key-role in starting the first grade college at Shirva.\n\nPut in great efforts to open schools at and Madantyar.\n\nHas been able to find a solution to some disputes that arose between the employees and management of Fr.
