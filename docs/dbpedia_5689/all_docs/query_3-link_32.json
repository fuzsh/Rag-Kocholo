        "text": "Rt. Rev. W. V. Karl, the former Bishop of the CSI in Karnataka Northern diocese passed away on 8th march 2019 in Bangalore. He was an outstanding theologian and ecumenist who shaped the infant Karnataka Northern Diocese after the trifurcation of the Mysore Diocese. God Blessed the Bishop with long life and he celebrated his centennial birthday in 2015.\n\nRt. Rev. W. V. Karl was born in the Niligari region on 11th July 1915. He completed his degree in humanities from St. Joseph’s College in Bangalore and joined UTC in 1940. He started his Pastoral ministry from Bangalore in the year 1945. His pastoral ministry covered nearly the entire South India. He served as the field secretary to the India Sunday School Union from 1953-1958.\n\nDuring his pastoral ministry some of the churches he served in are St. Bartholomew in Mysore, St. Luke’s Church in Bangalore and Wesley English Church. Bishop W. V Karl was also invited by the Methodist Mission to visit churches and stay in England for a year. He was responsible for many innovative practices in churches which helped in formalising documentation of Church records.\n\nHe was consecrated as Bishop of Karnataka Northern Diocese on April 25th 1971 at the Holy Name Cathedral, Hubli. As the Bishop to the newly formed Diocese his years of experience in ministry and administration of Churches helped in setting up the formal structures required for the functioning of a new Diocese. Bishop Karl showed dedication and commitment to the values that the Diocese was built on and contributed immensely to the structure and ethos of the Diocese. He had the constitution passed and set up the physical structures needed for functioning of the Karnataka Northern Diocese. He retired after nine years as Bishop of the KND in 1980. After his retirement he continued to be a member for St. Andrew’s Church, Bangalore while worshipping frequently at CSI Kothanur Church. Bishop Karl was a true servant of God.\n\nThe funeral service will be held on Saturday 9th March 2019 at 4.00 pm at St. Andrews Church, Cubbon Road, followed by burial at Gate # 1, Hosur Road Cemetery, Bangalore.\n\nDeepest condolences and prayers: Rt. Rev. P.K. Samuel, Bishop CSI KCD, Officers of the Diocese, Area Chairpersons, Members of the Executive Committee, Pastors and the Diocesan family."
