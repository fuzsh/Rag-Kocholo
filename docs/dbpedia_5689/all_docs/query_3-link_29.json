        "text": "The Diocese of Gulbarga was erected by Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI on 24th June 2005 as a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bangalore. It was formally inaugurated on 18th August 2005 on the occasion of the Episcopal Ordination of Mons. Robert Miranda the first bishop of the newly formed diocese. This Diocese consists of four civil districts of North Karnataka, namely Bidar, Gulbarga, Bijapur and Yadgir â€“ all considered to be the most backward area of the state. At present we have 7,729 Catholics as against 7.2 million people in the diocese."
