St Lawrence Basilica is not just for Catholics, but for everyone. People flock in large numbers when miracles happen. They visit the sacred place because when they ask for peace and a blessing, their prayers are heeded. My intentions too were answered.\"\n\nBy their presence, numerous political leaders showed that this is also a place of harmony between religions.\n\nMgr Bernard Moras, Archbishop of Bengalore, explained the meaning of basilica. \"The name means 'beautiful royal house’. In Christianity, the term basilica was used by early Christians when they celebrated Mass in the royal palaces of kings\".\n\n\"In the world,” he added, “there are 1,742 minor basilicas, including 21 in India. This is the 22nd and the second in the state of Karnataka after the Basilica of St Mary in the capital.\""
