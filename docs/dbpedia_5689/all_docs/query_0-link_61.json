        "text": "By Matters India Reporter\n\nShirva, October 12, 2019: A 36-year-old Catholic priest of Udupi diocese in Karnataka has reportedly committed suicide for unknown reasons.\n\nFather Mahesh D’Souza was found hanging from a ceiling fan in his room in Shirva in Udupi district. He was serving as assistant parish priest of Our Lady of Health Church there. He was also the principal of Don Bosco School attached to the parish.\n\nThe news about the news was reported late night on October 11, but most people came to know it only the following morning.\n\nThe reason for the priest ending his life is not known.\n\nHowever, the death of the young priest has shocked the entire community, well-wishers, students and parents of Don Bosco school, according sources in the diocese. People find it hard to believe, they said.\n\nFather D’Souza was ordained a priest on April 15, 2013, and had served as assistant parish priest in Milagres Kallianpur, Mount Rosary Kallianpur.\n\nIn 2016 he was transferred to Shirva, some 390 km west of Bengaluru, the Karnataka state capital.\n\nRelated"
