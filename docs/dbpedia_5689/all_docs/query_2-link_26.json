        "text": "First ever India-American Bishop Installed in US\n\nMangalore Today News Network\n\nMangaluru, June 01, 2022: Tuesday May 31, 2022 was a big day as the 13th bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Columbus was installed in the USA, the first Indian-American. Ever since Pope Francis in April 2022, announced the appointment of Rev.Fr. Earl K Fernandes as the Bishop elect of Columbus Ohio USA, the Indian diaspora and people in India have been waiting with bated breath for the Consecration and installation of the new youthful Bishop. There has been a lot written about this first in the US.\n\nWhat is of interest to people connected to the Indian subcontinent is the fact that the new Bishop Fernandes hails from Konkani Mangalore roots on his paternal side and Goa from his maternal side. Further, his parents lived long in Mumbai / Bombay and both grandparents too having migrated from Goa and Mangalore.\n\nThe ordination/Installation :\n\nCheers, Applause and hymns dominated in the huge church of Saint Paul the Apostle Church in Westerville, as the Rev. Fr . Earl K. Fernandes was ordained and installed Tuesday May 31, 2022 as the 13th bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Columbus. The almost three-hour ceremony was deeply solemn, joyful and happy, with approximately 1,500 people in attendance for the ceremonial event. Rev. Fernandes, 49, Born in Toledo to Indian immigrants, he is the first Indian-American Catholic bishop.\n\nDuring the homily and remarks from the pope’s representative to the United States, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, Bishop Fernandes was appreciated and praised. The bishop-elect sat in a gold and maroon robe, a zucchetto (a Bishop’s skull cap) already on his head when he entered the church. Archbishop Pierre noted Fernandes’ broad smile and said that he’ll need it for his new position, it’s “not at all a bad start.” Indeed, Fernandes was seen grinning, often widely, throughout the ceremony.\n\nBefore reading the letter from the pope appointing Fernandes bishop, Pierre addressed the new Bishop, who was earlier an official at the Apostolic Nunciature, the offices of the pope’s representative to the United States, in Washington, D.C. Nuncio Pierre pointed out that, with three former bishops of Columbus in attendance — retired bishops James Griffin and Frederick Campbell and Bishop Robert Brennan, now bishop of the Diocese of Brooklyn — Fernandes would have \"no shortage of counselors” in his new role. Brennan, Pierre and Archbishop Dennis Schnurr, of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, led the Mass together. Fernandes’ brother, Trevor Fernandes, a deacon in northwest Ohio, proclaimed the gospel and was by his brother’s side for much of the ceremony.\n\nA choir sang many hymns and Bishop Fernandes himself distributed Holy Communion to those in attendance toward the end of the service, his trademark smile on his face as he did so. The leader of the Archdiocese of Atlanta, Archbishop Gregory J. Hartmayer, gave the homily and called Fr. Fernandes a friend. Hartmayer praised Bishop Fernandes’ parents: his late father Sydney and his mother, Thelma, who was watching the live stream from Toledo as she was too frail to travel for the ceremony. \"These two wonderful people have had the strongest influence on Father Earl’s life, especially his spiritual life,\" Hartmayer said. \"They were his mentors ... his first teachers in the way of faith.\" Hartmayer noted that Fernandes made history when he was ordained as a bishop, as he is the Catholic Church’s first Indian-American bishop.\n\nAmong the invited attendees were Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and his wife Fran; Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz, who was a classmate of Earl Fernandes’ at St. Francis de Sales High School in Toledo; interfaith leaders; about 35 bishops and more than 200 priests. Pope Francis, in a letter translated from Latin to English, described Fernandes as being “of strong faith and good character.\" After Pierre read the letter, he and Fernandes shook hands and embraced before Fernandes walked the aisle of the large church, holding the Pope’s decree above his head to show those in the pews. They gave him a standing ovation.\n\nMangalore-Goa parentage :\n\nRev Fr Earl’s father is Dr. Sidney Oswald Fernandes (1936-2019) was born in Bombay, graduated from Saint Xavier College in Mumbai and Topiwala Medical School and Nair Hospital in 1965. Dr. Fernandes’ parents originally hail from Mangalore city, and can trace his roots to Goa about 4-5 generations back. Earl’s mother (Thelma nee Noronha) is originally from Aldona, Goa and was a teacher in Bombay’s Catholic schools, after updating her qualifications went on to a rewarding teaching career in the USA.\n\nDr. Sidney Fernandes with his wife Thelma and two oldest sons moved to Toledo, Ohio in 1970, a time many professionals enjoyed this privilege. He did medical residencies at the Medical College of Ohio in family practice and internal medicine. He maintained a solo medical practice in Oregon, Ohio, for 40 years until retirement. Involved with the Mercy Health System, he was lovingly committed to Mercy Saint Charles Hospital, where he was Chief of Staff in 1988-89. Known for his exceptional care of his patients over the years, he is fondly remembered.\n\nThe Mangalore Roots :\n\nInformation from various sources proves that Fr Earl’s dad Dr.Sidney is of Mangalorean roots (grew up in Bombay) after his parents moved there from Mangalore. He married Thelma Noronha a Goan whose parents moved from Goa - a common matter in those times . Fr Earl Fernandes’ paternal grandfather was Ligoury Fernandes (1906-77) of Canara Coffee Works, Fort Mumbai, hailed from Mangalore. Ligoury’s wife Mary Magdalene hailed from a Coelho family of Bolar, ancient heart of Mangalore, They had six children, Joyce (Sr Hilda), Terence, Sidney, Joan, Brian and Vernon. One of her relatives (a cousin of her father) was Isidore Coelho (1878-1968), author of the classic work on Mangalorean culinary art “The Chef”.\n\nwith Mother\n\nReferring to some basic Mangalore genealogical information the names of Dr.Sidney and Mrs Thelma’s appear in a Directory based in the US. Also, Grandfather Liguory Fermandes is seen under Mangalore origin ’Coffee Marketeers’ of Mumbai in a detailed directory. Well known Mangalore based genealogist and researcher in his two decade plus old publications, has assigned this family to be of \"Fernandes-Shenoy\" origin with roots in Nantoor in the city; connections are sure to emerge in due course of time and hopefully people will share their information. Further information proves that Ligoury Fernandes’s parents (Bp Earnest’s Great Grandparents) Lawrence & Joanna nee’ Machado, lived in Nantoor in Mangalore. Great Grandmother Joanna hails from a Machado family of sub-urban Omzoor. The Mangalore connection may not be too significant for the present generation of the proper as the perceptions are different; ’Konkani Mangaloreans’ from all over Kanara today are found in almost every nation of the 196 or so nations of the world and contributing in a big way, their renown and integrity has been recognised for centuries. Here in Mangalore (and Goa, Mumbai) the community has every reason to know, be aware and appreciate. World media in general has missed out on this angle, it is hoped some interest will be soon generated and more significant information would emerge in due time.\n\nCompiled by I. J. Saldanha Shet"
