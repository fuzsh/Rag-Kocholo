        "text": "Pope Francis on January 13 appointed bishops for five dioceses and an auxiliary for one in four states of India.\n\nJan 27, 2024\n\nBy Jose Kavi\n\nPope Francis on January 13 appointed bishops for five dioceses and an auxiliary for one in four states of India.\n\nHe also accepted the resignations of three bishops, including Bishop K A William of Mysore who had been asked by the Vatican a year ago “to take a period of absence from the ministry.”\n\nFour of the bishops-elect are natives of Tamil Nadu that celebrated Pongal, its harvest festival, on the day. The announcement came a day ahead of the feast of Saint Devasahayam Pillai, the first native saint of Tamil Nadu.\n\nAccording to a press statement from the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India (Latin Rite), the Pope has also accepted the resignations of Bishops Gerald Almeida of Jabalpur in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and Antonisamy Francis of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu, southern India.\n\nThe new bishop for Jabalpur is Father Valan Arasu of the same diocese, currently serving as the principal of St. Aloysius College in the city, the legal headquarters of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIn Kumbakonam, the Pope elevated its vicar general Father Jeevanandam Amalanathan as its new bishop.\n\nAnother diocese in Tamil Nadu, Kuzhithurai, got Father Albert George Alexander Anastas, a priest of Kottar, as its new bishop. He currently serves as a professor at St. Paul’s Seminary, Tiruchirappalli.\n\nThe Pope has appointed Father Bhaskar Jesuraj, a priest of the Agra archdiocese, as the new bishop of Meerut, both in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The diocese was lying vacant since March 19, 2022, when Pope Francis promoted Bishop Francis Kalist as the archbishop of Pondicherry-Cuddalore.\n\nBishop-elect Jesuraj now serves as the deputy secretary of the Agra Regional Bishops Council and principal of St. Clare’s Senior Secondary School in Agra.\n\nAnother vacant diocese, Karwar in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu’s northwestern neighbor, got a new bishop in Father Duming Dias, a member of Shimoga diocese and director of the Sannidhi Pastoral Renewal Center of Shimoga. The diocese was administered by Bishop Derek Fernandes of Belgaum."
