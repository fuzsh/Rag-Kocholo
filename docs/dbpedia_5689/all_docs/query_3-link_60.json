        "text": "The Malayalee Catholics of Ramamurthy Nagar had an intense desire in their hearts; A church to fulfill all their various spiritual needs.This was fulfilled by the inception of the church on 15th August 2008. The foundation stone was laid by His Grace, Rev. Bernard Moras, Archbishop of Bangalore, at 8th cross, M.V Nagar, Ramamurthy Nagar. Our First Parish Priest Rev. Fr. Sonu Kulathur VC was present to lead us in this journey at the temporary structure.\n\nJust like how God was with the Israelites as they traveled from Egypt to Israel, Our Lord was with us in our journey from 2008, along with the intercession of our Mother Mary. As matters were not in our favour, we had to move out, to the premises of St.Anne's Convent. The help provided by the sisters of St.Anne's, Bangalore was really the work of the Lord. With Rev Fr. George Parekandathil VC taking over as our Second Parish Priest. In due course we moved to a rented place in NRI layout. It was a shed used to rear sheep and goats. But our faith in the Lord led us on. With the arrival of our new Shepard Rev. Fr. Shijo Kodakkathanathu VC., Our dream church, started taking shape with the generous contribution of all parishioners, well wishers and benefactors, we were able to purchase this land, and as you can see the church at last. Physically, financially and spiritually and whole hearted effort and above all team work and trust that the Lord will lead us through all our hardships has lead us in the great mission. Various innovative ideas has helped us in raising funds for the church construction:\n\nNot only financially, we had many benefactors who spiritually helped us by their prayers. Our cake sale was one such endeavour. We were able to raise funds for church construction and also help in providing service to 3 children who were suffering from terminal sickness.\n\n2014 â Baby Johnson â Heart disease\n\n2015 â Baby Thanmay â Congenital Liver Disease\n\n2016 â Baby Atifa â Uro genital disease\n\n2017 - Master Sushant - T-Cell Lympho Blastic Leukemia\n\nWe plan to continue in this mission of service for which we plan to implement a DePaul scholarship scheme, which would function by us adopting one child's education from each of the numerous parishes who came forward to help us.\n\nA well organised CATECHISM class are conducted in St. Mary's Church every sunday.Catechism staff included 25 teachers and 151 students.\n\nWe started with a humble beginning of 51 students in 2011.\n\nNow our sunday school has 151 students and 20 teachers. The various units under catechism are Cherupushpa Mission League, Thirubalabsakhyam, Alter Servers.\n\nRegular assessments conducted by the Catechetical centre, had appreciated our efforts taken in catechism.\n\nEvery month confession facilities are made available for the students. Parish priests, dedicated teachers and parishioners have greatly helped in the faith formation of our children. Sundat star and introduction of saints are conducted every sunday to motivate the students.\n\nThe Society of St. Vincent de Paul (SVP or SVdp or SSVP) is an international voluntary organization in the Catholic Church, founded in 1833 for the sanctification of its members by personal services of the poor.\n\nInnumerable Catholic parishes have established âconferencesâ, most of which affiliate with a diocesan council. Among its varied efforts to offer material help to the poor or needy.\n\nMission: The St Vincent de Paul Society is a lay Catholic organisation that aspires to live the gospel message by serving Christ in the poor with love, respect, justice, hope and joy, and by working to shape a more just and compassionate society.\n\nVision: To be recognized as a caring Catholic Charity offering âa hand upâ to people in need by respecting their dignity, sharing our hope and encouraging them to take control of their own destiny.\n\nOur Impact: The St.Vincent de Paul society is committed to actively and passionately speaking out against the causes of poverty and inequality of the people we serve.\n\nPithruvedi, an association of fathers. All the fathers in the parish are the members of pithruvedi.\n\nThis is a very active group always on the move. The various innovative ideas taken by them to create funds for church construction are worth mentioning.\n\nThe grocery shop was one of the such move. It helped in raising funds. The entire group has greatly contributed to reduce the cost of construction by putting their hands together in the construction process.\n\nâWe see in all motherhood the reflection of a beauty which mirrors the loftiest sentiments of which the human heart is capable: the self-sacrificing totality of love; the strength that is capable of bearing the greatest sorrows; limitless fidelity and tireless devotion to work; the ability to combine penetrating intuition with words of support and encouragementâ (Pope John Paul II).\n\nYoung Womenâs Association of St. Marys church is an initiative of Rev Fr. Shijo Kodakkathanathu V.C. All mothers of catechism students are active members of YWA. The members take special effort to cleaning the church and its surroundings, arrangements for the feasts and other events of the church construction activities.\n\nMothers are living examples of self-giving love and truly the teacher of love to all humanity. We invite all the young mothers to spread this love to the world."
