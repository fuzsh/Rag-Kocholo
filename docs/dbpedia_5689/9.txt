Udupi Diocese, the ninth official Roman Catholic diocese under the Archdiocese of Bangalore, was inaugurated by Apostolic Nuncio of India Salvatore Pennacchio at Milagres Cathedral, Kallianpur on Monday afternoon.

The inauguration began with a ceremonial reception to new Bishop Rev Gerald Issac Lobo, Apostolic Nuncio in India Salvatore Pennacchio and other dignitaries at the cathedral entrance.

Mangalore Bishop Aloysius Paul D’Souza and Bangalore Archbishop Bernard Moras escorted Gerald Lobo to the cathedral and Salvatore Pennacchio sprinkled holy water and presented the sceptre to mark the installation of the new Bishop.

“Don’t forget your duty, cooperate with the Bishop’s mission, be faithful and assist him with the examples of Christ,” he said advising laymen to listen to the bishop and follow the path of Christ.

Archbishop Bernard Moras urged people to support and work towards unity in the diocese. Obedience to the bishop is obedience towards Church, he said.
