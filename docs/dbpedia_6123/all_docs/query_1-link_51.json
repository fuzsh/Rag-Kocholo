        "text": "The team behind Blackadder once planned a movie set in the swinging 60s, cast member Tony Robinson has revealed. It would have featured Rowan Atkinson as a Blackadder who is the illegitimate son of Queen Elizabeth II, with Robinson himself shifting from his regular role as sidekick Baldrick to that of a rock band drummer named Bald Rick.\n\nBlackadder ran for four series on the BBC between 1983 and 1989, with the second, third and fourth seasons considered the classic runs. A number of specials based on the same historical comedy format have since followed, the most recent being the short film Blackadder: Back and Forth, produced for the Millennium Dome. Speaking at the Cheltenham literature festival, Robinson said there were once plans for a longer outing.\n\n\"We had a discussion of a movie set in the 60s after Blackadder Goes Forth, with Blackadder as the bastard son of Elizabeth II,\" he said. \"[Blackadder] was going to be in a rock band with a drummer who had no hair who was called Bald Rick.\"\n\nRobinson, who now presents the archeological show Time Team on Channel 4, said Blackadder eventually fell apart due to spats between the cast and the writing team of Richard Curtis and Ben Elton. \"[The cast] had an enormous amount of impact â€“ probably too much,\" he said. \"The writers would present us with the script and we would pretend to fall about laughing, and then when they were gone we would pull the script to shreds. We would even invent new characters.\""
