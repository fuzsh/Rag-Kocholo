        "text": "What a sad way for such a beloved franchise to go out.\n\nBLACKADDER is a classic British TV comedy. Instead of feeling like a show that had four seasons, it feels like four separate series, each one set in a different time period and slightly retooling the formula with new variations on the characters (Series 1 is set in the Middle Ages, Series 2 during the Elizabethan era, Series 3 during the Napoleonic era, and Series 4 during World War I). The first series is generally considered the weakest, but the second and third are both good, and the fourth one in particular is one of my favorite shows of all time. There were also a few specials that aired here and there, but none are as bad as this.\n\nI could write an entirely separate review on why the fourth series of BLACKADDER was so good and had an especially poignant finale, but I'll just leave it at if you're going to create a TV-special a decade later, it really needed to be good and on the level of that finale, and sadly this is not.\n\nWhat's so shocking about BACK & FORTH isn't just that it's bad, but that it almost feels like they reverted back to the first series. Wasn't the big criticism everyone had of that first series that the big budget on-location shooting didn't work for this type of dialog-driven comedy, and that the franchise really found its voice once it took on a more small-scale sitcom format in the second series? It's like they forgot all that.\n\nBACK & FORTH is basically a reunion special, but while it's nice to see Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Tim McInnerny, and Miranda Richardson again, we don't get to see them really bounce off each other that much. Instead it gets lost on this time-travel plot with big special FX and historical vistas that just seem to detract from the humor. Instead of all the fun characterizations and witty wordplay BLACKADDER was known for, this is just a large-scale extravaganza.\n\nEveryone looks tired; Richardson in particular looks uncomfortable playing Queen Elizabeth again, knowing that talking in that silly voice was funny 13 years ago but feels exhausted now.\n\nOverall, BACK & FORTH just isn't very funny or memorable, and what's worse is that, by being the final installment of the franchise, it lessens the impact that that wonderful fourth series finale had. I wouldn't say it tarnishes BLACKADDER's legacy, but it definitely wasn't the best note to go out on."
