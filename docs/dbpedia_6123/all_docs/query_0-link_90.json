        "text": "Autumn 2018\n\nKey SF News & SF Awards\n\nThis season's major award news includes:-\n\nThe 2018 Hugo Awards were announced at this year's Worldcon. Looking at the longer-term trend, the numbers voting on the Hugo short-list (the finalists) are roughly three times greater than at the end of the 2000s but down to around a half that from peak short-list voting in 2015. This year saw 1,813 valid nominating ballots (1,795 electronic and 18 paper, though not everyone nominated for all categories) and 2,828 voting on the resulting shortlist (again not everyone voted for all categories). We continue (from last year) to define the Hugo 'principal categories' as those that had over a thousand nominating in that category (down from two thousand as our definition in 2016 as the numbers involved in Hugo nominating have declined since 2016). The 1,813 number nominating was down on last year's number (2,464) (the second year of decline). The 2,828, voting on the final shortlist was down on the 3,319 voting in 2017 which in turn was marginally up on the number voting in 2016 (3,130).\n\nSo not surprisingly, the principal Hugo categories (those categories with over one thousand nominating) were markedly fewer than last year. Indeed, for the first time in many years we are not counting the 'Best Dramatic Presentation Short Form' as principal category (it only saw 819 nominating ballots and just a paltry 87 nominating the programme that went on to win). The principal category Hugo wins this year therefore were:-\n\nBest Novel: The Stone Sky by N. K. Jemisin (fantasy) which back in January (2018) we cited as one of the 'best books' of 2017. This is the third consecutive win for 'best novel' for Jemisin something that has never happened before in this category.\n\nBest Novella: All Systems Red by Martha Wells\n\nBest Dramatic Presentation  Long Form: Wonder Woman (Trailer here) which back in January (2018) we cited as one of the best SF/F/H films of 2017.\n\nOther category (win information) (those categories with less than 1,000 nominating the works) can be found at thehugoawards.org.\n\nThe 2018 Nebula Award presentation (for 2017 works) has taken place at the SFWAs (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America) Annual Nebula Awards weekend in Pittsburgh Marriott City Center in Pennsylvania, USA. The principal category wins, as voted by SF Writers of America, were:-\n\nNovel: The Stone Sky by N. K. Jemisin\n\nNovella: All Systems Red by Martha Wells\n\nNovelette: 'A Human Stain' by Kelly Robson\n\nAlso presented was the Ray Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation the winner was Get Out (trailer here)\n\nThis year's nebula for 'Best Novel' was a title we selected at the beginning of the year as one of the best SF/F novels of 2017. Details of all the category wins can be found at www.sfwa.org. This year's full short list we reported last season. Last year's principal win Nebulas here.\n\nThe 2018 British Fantasy Awards have been voted on my members of the British Fantasy Society and the category shortlists announced. The shortlist for each category was decided upon by nominations submitted by British Fantasy Society members. This year's principal category shortlists are:-\n\nBest Fantasy Novel (the Robert Holdstock Award):-\n\nAge of Assassins by R. J. Barker\n\nThe Court of Broken Knives by Anna Smith Spark\n\nThe Ninth Rain by Jen Williams\n\nUnder the Pendulum Sun by Jeanette Ng\n\nBest Horror Novel (the August Derleth Award):-\n\nBehind Her Eyes by Sarah Pinborough\n\nThe Boy on the Bridge by M. R. Carey\n\nThe Changeling by Victor LaValle\n\nThe Court of Broken Knives by Anna Smith Spark\n\nThe Crow Garden by Alison Littlewood\n\nRelics by Tim Lebbon\n\nBest Anthology:-\n\n2084 edited by George Sandison\n\nDark Satanic Mills: Great British Horror Book 2 edited by Steve Shaw\n\nImposter Syndrome edited by James Everington & Dan Howarth\n\nNew Fears edited by Mark Morris\n\nPacific Monsters edited by Margret Helgadottir\n\nBest Film / Television Production:-\n\nBlack Mirror, Series 4 by Charlie Brooker\n\nGet Out by Jordan Peele\n\nThe Good Place, Season 1 by Michael Schur\n\nTwin Peaks: the Return by Mark Frost & David Lynch\n\nWonder Woman by Zack Snyder\n\nThe winners are to be decided upon by a different jury for each category and the winners announced at this year's FantasyCon in October.. +++ Last year's winners are here. Meanwhile there is a review of last year's British Fantasycon here.\n\nThe 2018 Arthur C. Clarke Award has been announced. The Award was instigated and initially sponsored by the late author Arthur C. Clarke (with the first presentation coincidentally taking place at the 1987 Eastercon at which the first print edition of SF² Concatenation was launched). It is a juried award for the best SF novel published the previous year in Britain. This year's shortlist consisted of:-\n\nSea of Rust  C. Robert Cargill\n\nDreams Before the Start of Time  Anne Charnock\n\nAmerican War  Omar El Akkad (Picador)\n\nSpaceman of Bohemia  Jaroslav Kalfar\n\nGather the Daughters  Jennie Melamed\n\nBorne  Jeff VanderMeer\n\nAnd the winner was Dreams Before the Start of Time by Anne Charnock. It is a family saga episodically told, concerning Millie and Toni. Their children and grandchildren embrace new ways of having kids. When infertility is a thing of the past, a man can create a child without a woman, a woman can create a child without a man, and artificial wombs eliminate the struggles of pregnancy. In this world, what does it mean to be a parent? A child? A family?\n\nRussias Aelita Awards for 2018 have been presented. The awards were announced at the 35th Aelita convention in Ekaterinburg.\n\nThe Aelita: Vadim Panov\n\nThe Aelita - New author: Nikolai Chepurin for The Legacy of the God of War\n\nThe Aelita: V. Bugrova (contribution to SF): Alexander Gritsenko\n\nThe Aelita - I. Khalimbaji Knight of Fiction (sort of equivalent to Knight of St. Fantony): Dmitry Baikalov, Oleg Kolesnikov and Sasha Krugosvetov.\n\nThe Locus Award winners have been announced. The Locus Awards are run by the US Locus magazine and determined by a survey of readers in an open online poll. The principal category wins for 2018 were:-\n\nBest SF Novel: The Collapsing Empire by John Scalzi (Tor)\n\nBest Horror: The Changeling by Victor LaValle (Spiegel & Grau)\n\nBest Fantasy: The Stone Sky by N. K. Jemisin (Orbit)\n\n'Young Adult': Akata Warrior by Nnedi Okorafor (Viking)\n\nBest Collection: Ursula K. Le Guin: The Hainish Novels and Stories by Ursula K. Le Guin (Library of America)\n\nFor details of all the many categories (always worth a look) check out the Locus on-line website www.locusmag.com.\n\nPoland's 2018 Janusz A. Zajdel Award Awards have been announced at Polcon:-\n\nBest Novel:Rafal Kosik for Rózaniec (Rosary)\n\nBest Short Story: Marta Kisiel for 'Szalawila' ('Imp')\n\nJapan's 2018 Seiun Awards were announced at the 57th Japanese national SF convention. The principal category wins were:-\n\nBest Novel: Becoming a Field Following Yamatonadeshiko by Yusuke Miyauchi\n\nBest Foreign Novel: Sleeping Giants by Sylvain Neuvel (Sequel summary here)\n\nBest Translated Short Story: 'Folding Beijing' by Jingfang Hao\n\nBest Dramatic Presentation: Kemono Friends (Trailer here)\n\nBest Non-Fiction: Locke the Superman: The 50th Anniversary Tribute Project (Locke the Superman is a Manga series by Yuki Hijiri)\n\nNotes: The award is voted on by the convention's registrants.\n\nOther SF news includes:-\n\nComic-Con copyright court case arguably flawed lawyers' comment suggests. As previously reported, San Diego Comic-Con ownership of the 'Comic-Con' trademark has been affirmed. Then last season we noted that Salt Lake were concerned as to the propriety of some of the court's proceedings: Salt Lake runs another 'Comic Con'. Since then, the April 2018 edition of Orange County Lawyer has an article by those working for the Salt Lake side of the case (vol. 60: 4, pages 34-36). Noting that some former trademarks  including, 'aspirin', 'cellophane', 'escalator', and 'linoleum'  are now in common parlance (and not solely used to relate to products from a specific manufacturer), the article cuts to the quick of the matter. The legal test for 'genericness': a generic term says what a thing is as commonly used by many people, but a trademark says who (or whose) it is. So here the question becomes, does 'comic con' refer to the San Diego event, or does it refer to a type of event organised by different people, a comic convention? However, the article points out, the jury did not hear from an expert on linguistics for the defence and nor did they hear about the origin of the term 'comic con'. (For example, it was in use by 1963 among comic aficionados who, one year later, organized the New York Comic Con.) The article also notes that jury did not hear of The Oxford English Dictionary entry for the term 'con', and so we (SF² Concatenation) suspect also did not hear of the Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction whose entries are more advantageous in that they include source citations. Here Brave New Words informs that the term 'con' in citable written form dates at least from 1940. The Orange County Lawyer article helpfully points out for us not versed in US legal matters, that a generic term. . . cannot become a trademark under any circumstances. (Actually this is similar to the position here in Great Britain.) So if 'comic con' started out as the generic term for a comic convention, then it cannot thereafter be used as a trademark. Conversely, the Orange County Lawyer article notes that the jury was only allowed to hear evidence of usage dating back to 1970 when the San Diego event began. Yet, San Diego only submitted 'Comic-Con' (note the hyphen) as a trademark in 2005. This application was, it is said, initially rejected by the trademark examiner as it was too descriptive a term in a generic sense. San Diego apparently got around this by filing a sworn declaration that it was substantially the only user of the mark (i.e. that it was not in generic use). This last, some in fandom might well say, is more than a little debatable. (So, following the court's ruling, the Salt Lake event this year is now being called the 'Salt Lake Comic Convention'.) Though SF² Concatenation has no formal view, and nor do many of us like seeing SF community matters being taken to court, having come this far we suspect that a number in the community will wish this matter to be settled properly.\n\nThe current position was determined late August (2018) when California U.S. District Court Judge Anthony Battaglia has affirmed the previous court ruling that effectively San Diego owned the term 'Comic-Con' and that nobody else without San Diego's permission can use that term or 'ComicCon' or similar sounding terms such as 'Komic Kon'. But it is possible to use 'Comic Convention' And so it goes.\n\nFortnite is being sued for potential copying by its rival PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). Both online games have been very popular and have broken records for the number of players simultaneously online of 3.3 and 3.4 respectively. Both games have a Hunger Games type scenario in which up to 100 players land on an island and fight till there is only one last player left. PUBG has reportedly generated sales of up to £980 million (US$1.3 billion) while Fortnite (which is free to download but you pay for extras) apparently generates around £154 million (US$200m) a month.\n\nManchesters (UK) MaD SF moves from the Crown & Anchor after four decades. MaD SF is one of Britain's longstanding regional SF groups: MaD SF (Manchester & District) not to be confused with BaD SF (Bolton & District) down the Devil's highway (A666). Some of its members have been on the committee for a couple of 1970s Eastercons. The Crown & Anchor had been a long-term haunt for Manchester SF fans (a block from Manchester's main Piccadilly Station) but new management saw it become noisy and not conducive to conversation. MaD SF has therefore moved to the Bank pub off the other side of Piccadilly Gardens. MaD meets every 2nd and 4th Thursday evening of the month. All welcome.\n\nNorthumberland Heath SF (SE London) has entered its second year. The group is still small with half a dozen making most meetings (but has the potential for double figures if everyone turns up). Its 2nd Thursday of the month meetings from 22.00 for informal, convivial chat has been supplemented by occasional free, new SF/F book giveaways from a sponsor and outings to the local cinema. Bus routes connect to Barnehurst (Station), Belvedere, Bexley, Erith, Slade Green and Welling. Details here or on Facebook. Postcode for GoogleMap = DA8 1JD. Help spreading the word (if you have SF friends based in London) on social media of this new group would be welcome.\n\nTitanCon 2018 cancelled; TitanCon 2019 Eurocon still continuing. Normally we don't cover smaller, fantasy conventions but it has been pointed out to us that this news will be of interest to European con-going SF fans. This year's Game of Thrones convention, TitanCon 2018, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, has been cancelled. This is due to a combination of committee personal difficulties (unconnected with the convention) and the last of its guests of honour having to withdraw due to contractual other engagements.\n\nTitanCon next year is due to be the 2019 Eurocon, the European Science Fiction Convention. This is currently still going ahead on the weekend after the Dublin Worldcon (see below) south of the border. It is a little unusual (if not a first) for a convention with a firm fantasy focus being the SF Eurocon, and so this event will appeal to those whose SF tastes also straddle fantasy and especially the Game of Thrones TV show. Alternatively, for those SF fans with little to no interest in fantasy but who are going to the SF Worldcon the previous weekend, then the 2019 Eurocon could be considered as a post-Worldcon relaxacon. Let's hope there is a good café and bar area.\n\nTrump's travel ban prompts calls that the US is not fit to host a Worldcon. US President Trump's ban on citizens from certain nations to travel to the US has caused a few in the SF community to wonder whether the US is fit to host an SF Worldcon if some of the world is prevented from attending. US citizen Patrick Nielsen Hayden opined \"This years Worldcon in San Jose should be the last US Worldcon until this changes.\" Non-US science fiction authors, Brits, Paul Cornell and Adam Roberts concurred. The 2019 Worldcon is slated to be Ireland and 2020 New Zealand. The next Worldcon site selection vote will be next year (at the Irish Worldcon) for 2021. It will be interesting to see whether there will be any non-US bids for 2021 or whether the current US bid will defer. (Don't hold your breath.) Meanwhile future non-US Worldcon bids include France for 2023 and Britain for 2024.\n\nThe San Jose Worldcon has been held. There were programme issues in advance of the convention and these were largely resolved. At it the Hugo Awards were presented, see news above.\n\nThe convention has informed us that 5,440 physically attended and 7,864 registered (who were therefore able to vote for the Hugos and who received the four six-monthly advance convention Progress Reports.\n\nScience programme. This year the Worldcon was not in Europe which meant, true to recent years' form, a diminished science programme. This is not a derogatory comment: what it is, is emphatically an empirical observation (see the following links)! Further, even allowing for this year's Worldcon being in the States, the science programme was smaller than other recent US Worldcons. It was roughly: a third smaller than the Helsinki 2017 Worldcon, just a little smaller than the 2016 Kansas Worldcon, smaller than the 2015 Spokane Worldcon, and miniscule compared to the 2014 London Worldcon even notwithstanding that year's science programme's astronomy bloat. Indeed, the 2014 Worldcon's largest ever science programme demonstrated the popularity of science at Worldcons: virtually all London 2014's science programme in the breakout lecture rooms were filled to capacity with some unable to get in, and the science items held in the larger halls were substantially filled. Yes, we are the Science Fact & Science Fiction Concatenation, and so arguably are biased, but the data speaks for itself! Worldcon programme managers might perhaps do well to note.\n\nThe science topics covered in this year's Worldcon science programme were: 'Science: The Core of SF's Sense of Wonder', 'Dude, Where's My Ray Gun?', 'Movement and Motion in a Rotating Space Habitat', 'Opioid Crisis -- Fact and Fiction', 'The Myth of the Astronaut - Who Are the Space Cadets of Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow?', 'Cadavers, Bench Science... in Frankenstein', 'Hubble Space Telescope: Humanity's Most Important Tool Ever Invented?', 'Practical Telepathy: the Science and Engineering of Mind-to-Mind Communication', '911 in Freefall: Handling Medical Emergencies in Space', 'What's New from SETI?', 'Why Pluto Was Kicked Out of the Planet Club and What We Are Learning About It Today', Old Space vs. New Space: The Future of Spaceflight', 'Houston, We Have a Problem...', 'Really Weird Science: An Introduction to Quantum Computing', 'Psychological and Psychiatric Aspects of a Manned Mission to Mars', 'Games for Science!', 'Women in Science and Space Exploration: Are Women Finding Equity?', and 'The Coming Plague'.\n\nOther news. We hope to have a standalone con report our next seasonal edition (January 2019) but, in addition to all the usual Worldcon things one might expect, there was some sort of politically ideological demonstration outside the front of the venue plus a counter demo. Only a few score were involved, there was a small police presence and some shouting and swearing between the two rival camps whom we understand for the most part did not involve Worldcon attendees. There was barely any impact from this on activities within the Worldcon. (There are a couple of YouTube videos on this if you are really interested of which just one linked below.)\n\nBig Heart Award. From now on The Big Heart Award (recognising long-term fan service in Worldcon fandom) will be known as the David A. Kyle Big Heart Award. Its winner this year was File770 fanzine (also online) creator Mike Glyer.\n\nThe Guinness Book of World Records awarded the World SF Society (the body under whose auspices the Worldcon is held) with a second consecutive award for the longest running science fiction award: the Hugo Award.\n\nShort YouTube vids on the Worldcon:-\n\nN.

News from the con has been light but apparently the hotel accommodation is significantly more expensive than previous Worldcons such as the Loncon 3 in London 2013. The convention has yet to officially open its accommodation booking service. Those going on a budget might want to check out cheaper options now rather than wait for the rush. Alternatively, those going for the five days of the convention plus a night either side and staying in a hotel might want to budget for somewhere around 1,000 Euro/US$ extra. The good news is that restaurant and bar bills will be similar to those at the recent London Worldcon and not as costly as the 2017 Helsinki Worldcon.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's president Michael D. Higgins has written to the con committee saying: \"Ireland is a land which celebrates stories and imagination, and our Irish heritage has always been imaginatively interwoven with new cultures and new traditions.\" And: \"Speculative fiction plays a seminal role in helping us to question received versions of the contemporary world, and to dream of new worlds and new ways of thinking. It affords us a licence to look beyond the immediate and utilitarian, to engage in a long form of thinking which places no limits on our curiosity.\"\n\nJust prior to this seasonal news page the Dublin 2019 Worldcon increased its membership rates. Worldcons gradually increase their rates from two years in advance (when they win the bid) to the event. This is to encourage early registration so provide funds to prepare for the Worldcon as well as to encourage numbers who can then participate in Hugo nominating (usually the February and March before the convention) and short-list Hugo voting (late April, May and June). In addition to a lower registration rate, early registrants also get mailed to them four 6-monthly Progress Reports over the two years prior to the event. The rate changes are as follows:-\n\n- Full Adult Attending membership rates rise to 210 from 180\n\n- First Worldcon rates, for adults attending their first Worldcon, rise to 130 from 110\n\n- Young Adult Attending (meaning under 26 at time of con) membership rates rise to 130 from 110\n\n- Child Attending rates rise to 70 from 65 (under 13 at time of con)\n\n- Supporting membership (voting rights and pre-event publications only) is unchanged at 40.\n\n- The rate for an Infant, born after 16 August 2013 (under 6 at time of con), remains unchanged at 5.\n\nAs part of the convention's policy to encourage families and children to attend Dublin 2019, discounts of up to 10% for Adult-Child families of three or more members are available. Families should register as Supporting members and fill out a Family Membership request form on their website to have the balance calculated.\n\n+++ We also have a snippet below on the Republic of Ireland's publishing sector in this seasonal news page's 'Publishing News' section +++ Dublin Worldcon science GoH has been awarded a special Breakthrough Prize.\n\nThe 2020 Worldcon will be held in Wellington, New Zealand and called CoNZealand. This news follows the site selection vote at this year's Worldcon. New Zealand was a very interesting bid to host the Worldcon as NZ has never before held a Worldcon and NZ is simply a fascinating country not to mention that its capital Wellington (the proposed Worldcon venue) has much to offer. We have covered this bid's details before. Wellington NZ was the only serious (as opposed to the customary 'joke') bid on the ballot and so not surprisingly it won. However, the reason that it was the only serious bid for 2020 is a reflection of the Worldcon community wanting to give NZ its chance and that it is believed if everyone pulls together that this could be a good debut Worldcon for this nation. Some of us SF&sup2 Concatenation are supportive having been there at the bid's inception at Au Contraire (2010) and we even hope that a few of us will attend. (Given that some Worldcons don't even see us physically represented, our have a few attending is a little special for our home camp.)\n\nThe NZ bid has only had one significant problem, this late in the day, but has overcome it. The convention has had to move forward its dates by a fortnight to Wednesday, 29 July through Sunday, 2 August 2020, we have been told due to the unavailability of one of the main facilities. Apparently a major event organiser with a longstanding relationship with Wellington booked the main exhibit hall part of the venue. This rival organiser has booked this venue for 8 weeks starting with the week originally provisionally reserved by the Worldcon bid. Understandably anyone that can book such a facility for 8 weeks is a BIG player and so the NZ Worldcon bid felt that it could not compete. We are given to understand that this was not the convention bid's fault as they had negotiated with the venue buildings in good faith. It seems as if those managing these facilities were also unaware of the big organiser's intentions as the rival organiser has a relationship with Wellington's city corporate body and not the individual facilities. This date change makes the 2020 Worldcon the second to be held earliest in the year. The only other implication for fans going is that July is winter in New Zealand. So expect the maximum daily temperature in Wellington to be around 11°C. This is the same as: London or Glasgow in April and October; New York in April and November. No big issue though do pack a vest and a jumper. Also do expect some occasional rain. Here, the good news is that Wellington as a city is fairly compact and those used to walking will probably do that rather than use the buses for city centre tourism.\n\nCoNZealand has a promotional video on YouTube. This video sees a welcoming statement from NZ's Prime Minister! (We've never had Great Britain's PM providing Worldcon video endorsement, nor the US President for that matter.) And also in the video we learn that George R. R. Martin will be the con's Toastmaster, so expect many locals to register.\n\nThis last is not a trivial point. Given the small venue size, George R. R. Martin being Toastmaster is likely to make CoNZealand more popular than Australia's Worldcon in 2010 (despite that convention having one of the best ever film programmes at a Worldcon. The advice surely must be to register for CoNZealand early. Indeed, even if you end up by 2020 not having saved up enough finance to go, an attending membership will both get you Hugo nominating and final shortlist voting rights as well as the convention's publications (including up to four  assuming you register soon  six-monthly pre-convention Progress Reports. But if you can get to CoNZealand in 2020 then the betting will be that a couple of hundred other SF fans from beyond that country will be there a few days before and after that event for tourism. Indeed if a few of us on the SF² Concatenation team can encourage some of the local New Zealand SF groups to have events before and after the convention then CoNZealand could be the centre piece for a European's or N American's holiday of a lifetime.\n\nFinally, we'd like to congratulate CoNZealand for continuing the return, following Dublin 2019, to the practice of having an individual name for their Worldcon. The past couple of years has seen a simple numbering of Worldcons for their title: such as 'Worldcon 75' and 'Worldcon 76'. Good on NZ, this recent 'just numbering name' trend is to be deplored. Who but the most die hard Worldcon fans can remember which number is this year's Worldcon? So if the Worldcon community really wants to encourage greater inclusivity  especially those years it is outside N. America  individual branding for individual Worldcons is needed in addition to the generic 'Worldcon' brand.\n\nTo date the 2020 NZ bid organisers have been communicative. Presuming this continues, and that as this Worldcon  if not the biggest  could be something of a special experience we'll do our best to give good seasonal coverage over the next two years in the run-up to this event.\n\nFinally A comment has come our way that the NZ 2020 Worldcon will find itself in the middle of the 2020 Olympics, Tokyo, Japan (24th July  9th August, 2020). We have looked at what happened with the 2012 Olympics here in BritCit. That event did see air fares increase for flights into London. The two other inter-continental airport hubs nearby (Amsterdam and Paris) let alone others in western Europe, were less affected and airports elsewhere were completely unaffected. Assuming a similar picture holds for Tokyo 2020, this means that only those planning on going to the 2020 CoNZealand Wellington Worldcon from Europe who use Hong Kong and Singapore as stopover points are likely to be affected by a slight price rise. Having said that there is also the new non-stop Heathrow London to Perth Australia route that then carries on to Melbourne from which a flight to Wellington can be made. This is possibly an option for those wishing to do some western Australian tourism Those coming from N. America will be unaffected.\n\nThe 2021 Worldcon. There's currently one bid and that's for Washington DC (US). (Dallas, US, withdrew in 2016 and Boston, US, withdrew in 2017.)\n\nThe 2022 Worldcon. There's currently one bid and that's for Chicago (US).\n\nThere are now three bids for the 2023 Worldcon: France and Memphis, US, plus a new one from China. The French bid is, as we previously reported, for Nice. That there is a serious US rival bid possibly suggests that there is room for competition and that confidence in the French bid is not what it might be. This last is possibly due to the French bid keeping a rather low profile. This is something they can correct but they need to do so soon before New Orleans builds up momentum.\n\nA new bid by China for 2023 was also announced at this year's Worldcon. The proposed venue city is Chendgu. Chengdu (which if you know about China's past SF history, recent SF history let alone China's post-millennial development of SF you will realise) is home of the magazine SF World.\n\nThe Worldcon occasionally does see some interesting bids burst in unexpectedly on the Worldcon community but  it has to be said  these often do not come to much. This is not a derogatory comment on this new bid but an observation of the past Worldcon bid record. If a Worldcon bid stands a chance to succeed then the proposed bidding team usually researches matters well in advance with those within the Worldcon scene and so some inkling of intent circulates among the community in advance of the announcement. This has not happened with this new bid. Having said that, China's SF community, spearheaded by those connected with SF World, have for a few years now been keen to integrate more with the global SF community as indicated by their writing two of the afore linked articles in SF² Concatenation and their inviting western SF authors to their annual Chengdu SF con such as in 2007. China is of course known for strict State control (and associated cronyism etc) within which enterprise has to function. Back in 2010 SF World suffered a bit of a hiatus due to such cronyism but matters have since settled. What this all means for the new proposed bid we will see as the bid raises its profile (or not) over the next couple of years.\n\nThe 2024 Worldcon. There's currently one bid and that's for Great Britain. Britain has a reasonable reputation for Worldcons having held over half a dozen from the 1960s and last in 2014. Some news further to previous as to the potential venue cities being considered. The venue problem those running Britain's bid is that whichever city they go for there is an issue: Britain simply does not have a decent conference venue for something like a Worldcon or even major international science conferences as even the Council for Science & Technology Institutions (now rebranded as the Science Council) noted way back in the 1990s (and something that's truly embarrassing for us to admit about SF² Concatenation's home nation).\n\nThe news this season is that Liverpool is no longer being considered as the hosting city. This really is welcome news for many reasons which need not be recounted here. This leaves the bid runners considering London (BritCit) and Glasgow (CalHab). London has the hotel space near to the ExCel Conference Centre and would attract a few thousand extra registrants from those living in the populous SE England who can commute in, but all the venue's small break-out session rooms (where much of the programme would be held) together only cater for a couple of thousand (something we noted before the 2014 event itself). It might be possible to restrict numbers attending, but such are the venue hire costs that the registration price for a smaller event would be prohibitive (for example hardly any local students without accommodation or overseas travel costs would likely come unless they were given very special rates).\n\nConversely, Glasgow has most of the hotel beds a taxi ride away (but one of the cheapest taxi rides in Great Britain). Also, like London, Glasgow has its own conference break-out room problems for the programme even if a greater proportion of the convention could attend those items given that a Worldcon in Glasgow would be smaller than London (fewer would commute in locally as there is less of a local population serviced by a comprehensive regional transport system).\n\nAnd if you are old enough and thinking of Brighton as an option (the venue for the 1979 Worldcon) then Worldcon has simply outgrown the facilities there. (Anyway, the bid runners aren't considering that as an option.)\n\nIt therefore is all a bit of a Hobson's choice for those managing the bid. However, you can be assured that the 2024 Worldcon bid runners will give it a lot of thought and whatever they decide there will be reasons.\n\nThere are currently two Worldcon bids for 2025: Seattle, USA, and Perth, Australia. To be honest Australia's 2025 bid is going to have to work very hard to both convince folk that they are capable of running a half-decent Worldcon and attract physically attending members, such was the shambles of the 2010 Australian Worldcon. 2010's only saving graces were the excellent venue and superb triple film streams: the abortive programme, hotel room party contract debacle, the pre-con climate change 'academic' symposium failures (see the link for a review) cannot be forgotten in a hurry. Any Worldcon  to take one example  that tells you to ditch the entire programme schedule booklet on arrival, as a new programme was being developed on day one, cannot in any way be described as a success. Australia 2025 may get a sympathy vote, or support as an out-of-N. America Worldcon, but if it does it may not get many overseas warm body attendance other than the absolutely die-hard Worldcon regulars. This is not to say that Australia 2025 cannot turn things around but they are going to have to work extremely hard on their bidding profile which needs to demonstrate clearly that they have genuinely learned lessons from 2010. (That begins with recognising them.) Having said that, if they can demonstrate that they have got their act together, for those of us in NW Europe, 2025 would be a lot easier to get to now that there are direct, non-stop flights from London to Perth.\n\nAnd finally .\n\nFree SF Art to spur interest in SF Art. FreeArt.com offers free, gallery-quality 8x10 art prints and a wide variety of wall art and decor. Their idea is to give away the 8x10 prints free of charge (shipping/handling not included), with the hope that people may be interested in our other pieces. They currently have over 22,000 pieces of sci-fi art, See Free Sci-Fi Art Prints.\n\nNow is the time to check out Judge Dredd and the world of 2000AD! If you have ever wondered what all the fuss was about with Judge Dredd then now (from 19th September 2018) is arguably a good time to check Dredd out as the monthly Judge Dredd Megazine sees its 400th edition. The advantage for those wanting a taste is that this Judge Dredd Megazine issue sees all new adventures: newcomers will not jump into the middle of a graphic strip story. Also, to mark the 400th edition, this edition will be 100 pages and perfect bound. It will feature strips on: Judge Anderson: Psi Division (radiation from the nuclear war has created mutants, some of whom have telepathic abilities and are used by the Justice Department); Devlin Waugh (a tough, playboy vampire employed by the Vatican in the Dredd universe); Lawless (an off-world settlement of Dredd's Mega-City One, isolated by Munce Incorporated due to industrial irregularities: a futuristic wild west version of judging); and, of course, old stony face himself, Judge Dredd, plus others. All at the price of a paperback (£7.99) and available in most newsagents while stocks last through to the end of the month, possibly longer in specialist SF bookshops. Scrotnig.\n\nLocus magazine is 50 years old. Locus is effectively the literary SF trade magazine for N. America but does touch upon written SF elsewhere. It can also be found in a more limited form online at LocusMag.com (the online film reviews are particularly good). Our best wishes for Locus' second half-century.\n\nAutumn 2018\n\nFilm News\n\nThe summer's SF/F/H films appearing within the top five of the weekly box office top ten charts (which of course also include other non-genre offerings which we ignore) were, in the British Isles (Great Britain, NI and Irish Republic), in order of their appearance:-\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (Trailer here)\n\nStar Wars: Solo (Trailer here)\n\nJurassic World (Trailer here)\n\nA Quiet Place (Trailer here)\n\nDeadpool 2 (Trailer here)\n\nIncredibles 2 (Trailer here)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp (Trailer here)\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout (Trailer here)\n\nThe Meg (Trailer here)\n\nChristopher Robin (Trailer here)\n\nIncredible 2 becomes the first animated feature film to take US$600 million (£455m) in US.&nbsp So we can expect Disney to ask for another be made.\n\nInception's ending clarified by co-star Michael Caine. Back at the beginning of 2011 we cited Inception as one of our selection of the best SF films of 2010 and then it went on to win a Hugo Award. But the ending was ambiguous. Was the totem real? (That is to say, was the protagonist in the real world and reunited with his family, or was he trapped in a dream world? A small spinning object was used by the protagonist as in the dream world it would spin for an unfeasibly long time. At the film's ending we never saw the spinning object for long and so do not know if the end of the film was meant to be in the real or a dream world.) Michael Caine provided an answer when recently introducing the film at a screening in London's Somerset House. The actor confessed he was puzzled when he read the script and so asked whether or not when he was acting was he meant to be in the real world or a dream one? Apparently director Christopher Nolan replied that whenever Caine was in a scene it was the real world. So the ending is real. (Or is it? Of course Nolan could have just said that to Michael Caine to get him to act in a particular way )\n\nA couple of weeks later, in another interview, Michael Caine shared another discussion he had with the director (presumably after shooting) in which Caine asked what the ending meant. Apparently, we (the film's viewers) are all in the dream world of the film. Make that of what you wish: Caine himself confessed confusion at that explanation.\n\nWilliam Gibson's unused script for Alien3 is to become a comic series. Cyberpunk author William Gibson is best known for Neuromancer (1984) but he also was asked to write a putative script for Alien3. In the actual film, all the survivors from Aliens with the exception of Ripley, were killed off and Ripley crashes into a penal colony along with (unknowingly) an alien. Conversely, the Gibson script has it that after Aliens, Ripley, Hicks, Newt, and Bishop are hibernating their journey through space when they are intercepted by a ship from the Union of Progressive Peoples. This leads to a race between two national-military complexes to weaponise the alien in a cold war type thriller horror. The comic series will be produced by Dark Horse and comes out in November (2018).\n\nThe Blade Runner films are to be expanded into a series of books and comics. Alcon Media Group (the production company behind Blade Runner 2049) and Titan (the British company with a commercial eye) have come to an arrangement that Titan will publish a series of Blade Runner non-fiction books and comics. The non-fiction books will include things like artwork and stills from the films. The comics will fill in the Blade Runner universe. This is not the first time such spin-off commercialisation has taken place. Previously, Boom! Studios published both a graphic novel adaptation of Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep in 2009 and a prequel, Dust to Dust, in 2010. And then there was a run of novels by K. W. Jeter in the second half of the 1990s.\n\nMars Attacks is to become a comic. Dynamite Entertainment is to publish the comics which will be written by Kyle Starks and drawn by Chris Schweizer. This builds on the 1996 film adaptation by Tim Burton of the 1950s trading cards. The first editions will be released in October (2018).\n\nRoboCop is back in what could well be the first proper sequel.. The original 1987 RoboCop film, directed by Paul Verhoeven, was written by Ed Neumeier and Michael Miner. These co-creators of the character were not involved in any of the RoboCop sequels or the 2014 reboot. However, back in the 1980s they did write a sequel that was never used: Paul Verhoeven was not interested in a follow-up and the there was the Hollywood writers strike. Which brings us to today and Ed Neumeier and Michael Miner are up for bringing their original sequel to the big screen. This screenplay is being polished and updated by Justin Rhodes (who has just written the next Terminator screenplay). MGM are keen and one of its execs apparently thinks that its plot, of a reality TV star becoming President, sort of chimes with the times. Ed Neumeier and Michael Miner are to be producer and executive producer respectively. It may well be that Neill (District 9 & Elysium) Blomkamp will direct once he has completed a disaster film, Greenland.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin's The Ice Dragon is to be a film. Martin's children's book has been picked up by Warners, and Martin is apparently to co-produce; whether or not he will have a hand scripting remains to be seen. The film will be an animation.\n\nChicken Run follow-up is to be made. 18 years after the original and Chicken Run 2 is in development from Aardman (the folk who did Wallace and Gromit).\n\nStephen King's new Firestarter film gets a director King's 1980 novel was previously made into a film in 1984. Blumhouse Productions has now got Fatih Akin (the German director who did the revenge film In The Fade) to direct the new Firestarter film. The novel is a science fantasy. The result of drug trials enables a little girl to start fires with her mind. There was also a two-part TV movie sequel, Firestarter: Rekindled, in 2002.\n\nFrom a Buick 8 is the next Stephen King novel possibly to be adapted to the big screen. Hyde Park Entertainment has picked up the rights to Stephen Kings 2002 novel From a Buick 8. William Brent Bell is slated to write and direct. Given that a writer and director is slated means that the studio is serious about making the film reasonably soon. However, this is the second attempt to bring the novel to the big screen.\n\nTwo Star Trek films are in pre-production, Paramount Chief Exec confirms. Jim Gianopulos informed an audience at this year's Paramount Pictures CinemaCon. One of the films may well be the Quentin Tarantino project previously reported (this last is likely to be a few years away until Tanatino completes Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Skydance is reportedly involved in both the Trek film ventures: Skydance Productions partnered with Paramount on the last two Trek films: Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) and Star Trek Beyond (2016).\n\nDanny (28 Days Later & Sunshine) Boyle's next film is to have an SF/fantasy riff. It will be a comedy co-written with Richard (Black Adder) Curtis. The plot has not yet officially been released but is thought to concern a man who wakes one day to discover he is the only person in the world aware of The Beatles. IMDB says that the working title is All You Need is Love which could be revealing. The tentative release date is currently September 2019.\n\nThe late Carrie Fisher to appear in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode IX. The actress played Princess/General Leia in the original three and last two Star Wars films. She died in 2016 but there are enough unused clips from the last two productions, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Episode VIII  The Last Jedi , for her to appear in the J. J. Abrams-directed sequel, Star Wars: Episode IX currently slated for a December 2019 release. Notably, they have decided not to CGI her face onto another actor as happened with Peter Cushing in (Star Wars:) Rogue One. Mark Hamill will also reprise his role: presumably as a 'ghost' in the Force. Filming has already commenced at Pinewood Studios, London.\n\nThe next James Bond to be directed by Danny Boyle. Stop Press: No it wont! Bond's SF connections are due to the franchise being both a technothriller and frequently employing SF tropes be they global decimation by chemical weapons, hijacking space craft, or using orbital space weapons such as giant lasers. Danny Bayle himself no stranger to SF with films like 28 Days Later or Sunshine. Danny Boyle even has already done a mini-Bond with the opening of the 2012 Olympics. So all was set for what could be a really innovative next Bond film. Sadly over the summer artistic difference between Boyle and the franchise's producers (Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli) led to Boyle resigning: apparently there was a difference of opinion as to who should be cast as the lead villain. The good news is that the new director will not have much time to make huge changes and so a fair bit of Boyle's vision is likely to make it to the final version (even if it is covered by the producers' veneer) if the film is to make its slated 2019 release: filming was due to commence at Pinewood in December (2018). On the other hand, if there are to be screen-story changes then production will be delayed as will its likely release, currently proposed for November 2019.\n\nJames Bond: MGM and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment lose court case. When MGM and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment produced the James Bond box set of films they never thought they'd get taken to court, but they did. They used the promotional line All the Bond films gathered together for the first time. This to die hard film fans could be potentially a red rag to a bull; indeed, it was. Don't forget there is the 1960s David Niven starring Casino Royale and the Sean Connery reprise Never Say Never Again. Indeed, apparently David Niven was Ian Fleming's choice to play Bond. These were missing from the set as MGM had nothing to do with them. U.S. District Court judge Ricardo Martinez agreed with the complainant saying, \"At this time, the Court will Live and Let Die,\" and \"The Court finds the questions of how a reasonable person would interpret 'all' and 'every' and what qualifies as a James Bond film remain for the trier of fact to decide. These terms are not unequivocally puffery as a matter of law.\"\n\nAndy Serkis is directing a performance-capture film version of George Orwell's Animal Farm. Andy Serkis is best known for his performance-capture role of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy as well as in the recent Planet of the Apes reboot. The film is being produced by Serkis' film company The Imaginarium. Matt Reeves, who directed Serkis in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and War for the Planet of the Apes, will be one of the film's producers. Netflix will be streaming the film.\n\nThe four Avatar sequels will look at other cultures on Pandora. As many of you know, James Cameron's Avatar is to have four sequels produced by Jon Landau. Landau has now revealed that all four sequels will be based on the planet of Pandora but will not focus on the with one tribe and one location on a vast planet. Having said that,expect some back story revelations concerning the first film's characters and possibly their offspring.\n\nJames Gunn, director of Guardians of the Galaxy: vol. 3, has been dismissed by Disney. His misogynous Tweets from a decade ago resurfaced to some publicity. Gunn said: \"My words of nearly a decade ago were, at the time, totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative. I have regretted them for many years since  not just because they were stupid, not at all funny, wildly insensitive, and certainly not provocative like I had hoped, but also because they dont reflect the person I am today or have been for some time.\" And, \"Regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then. All I can do now, beyond offering my sincere and heartfelt regret, is to be the best human being I can be: accepting, understanding, committed to equality, and far more thoughtful about my public statements and my obligations to our public discourse. To everyone inside my industry and beyond, I again offer my deepest apologies.\"\n\nHowever then on the plot thickens and the fans rally. Now, before we go any further let us say that the original tweets are very risqué and really not the sort of thing you want to hear or see (if you really want to you can search for them yourself). Having said that James Gunn has moved on in the intervening decade and his humour style has changed from his purposefully provocateur days. And that's the point: back then everyone knew of his provocateur, black humour and his professional work clearly reflected that. Indeed, Disney must almost certainly known of his past when they originally hired him: it was effectively, if not explicitly, part of his CV. So why the firing now? Well, not only has James Gunn moved on, so has the world and today those decade old tweets simply are not acceptable in today's western socio climate.\n\nAnd here it is where the plot thickens. According to some sources, the reason that these old tweets got their present publicity was  it is alleged  in retaliation by supporters (including those at The Daily Caller) of Donald Trump have taken offense, hence retaliated, against some of Gunn's recent observations as to the current (2018) US President. For these Trump-supporter reasons, Gunn's fan base quickly leapt into action and within a couple of days of Disney firing Gunn they set up a 're-hire James Gunn' petition on Change.org. A week later the petition boasted over 60,000 signatures: after 10 days the number reached over 350,000. All of Guardians of the Galaxy franchises principal cast have also been supportive of Gunn. They signed an open letter of support a Tweet of which gathered a million 'likes' in half a day.\n\nShort video clips (short films, other vids and trailers) that might tickle your fancy .\n\nFilm clip download tip!: The History of the Art of SF Book Covers.

The fifth and final season sees the crew of the destroyer U.S.S. Nathan James journey through a world finally recovering from the deadly virus that devastated the population, but global political unrest remains The series is based upon a novel by William Brinkley. You can see the season 5 trailer here.\n\nThe First is a new series launched just as we post this seasonal news page. Mundane SF, The First follows the first manned mission to Mars. Under the direction of visionary aerospace magnate Laz Ingram (Natascha McElhone), the crew contends with peril and personal sacrifice as they undertake the greatest pioneering feat in human history. The series is produced by Britain's Channel 4 along with the US Hulu streaming service. You can see the trailer here.\n\nThe new season of The Walking Dead will premiere next month: 7th October, 2018. Season 9 of the post-apocalyptic zombie horror will premiere on AMC mid-October. There will be a mid-season break mid-December before it resumes February next year (2019). However as is now commonly known, the show's lead, Andrew Lincoln (Rick), will be leaving mid-season much to a number of the show's fans' concerns. (The Brit actor is apparently leaving the show after a decade so as to spend time with his children in his home country as they are at an age when school regularity means that they cannot spend so much time overseas.) Other news is that it rumoured that Jon Bernthal (Shane) will reappear in one episode, possibly as a flashback or a hallucination. There is also a rumour that the season will see a time jump forward, skipping a few years, as happened in the comic series on which the show is based. If this happens it will take us to a future in which materials that had been scavenged  such as petrol (gas) and bullets  come into short supply and the infrastructure (bridges and so forth) has increasingly broken down.\n\nThe Walking Dead season 9 also sees a new character from the original comics. The character Alpha, from the Robert Kirkman comics, will appear in the new season. She'll be played by Samantha (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Minority Report) Morton. Alpha is the leader of a large survivor group known as the Whisperers.\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Lincoln (Rick) has lamented that news of his leaving the show has leaked. \"I still regret that the story broke, because I believe in story,\" he said. \"Its gonna be a great season, but it would have been greater if it was not spoiled to a degree.\" It is not known how the leak happened but it is possible that it was deliberate given the season 6 cliff-hanging finalé in which it was known that one of two  but not which  main characters was going to die. The tension was too much for some fans and there was some negative (and even heated) online debate. You can see the season 9 trailer here.\n\nDoctor Who re-boot season 11 premieres Sunday 7th October 2018. And that's all there is to say really other than it features the second woman ever to play the good Doctor. (The first, of course, being Joanna Lumley towards the end of a two-part adventure, 'The Curse of Fatal Death', for Comic Relief in 1999 (it is on YouTube). That's a piece of trivia for you if ever you are organising an SF quiz.)\n\nNew series, Origin, premieres shortly on YouTube Premium. A colony ship crewed by folk who want to leave their past behind sees some of the passengers awake mid-flight with the rest of the passengers and crew mysteriously gone. Trailer here.\n\nLore season 2 due out shortly, October (2018). Lore is a horror anthology series based on Aaron Mahnke's podcast of the same name. Season 2 trailer here.\n\nNew War of the Worlds mini-series to be broadcast by BBC this autumn. We first reported on this new series back in 2016 but thought a reminder now for you to keep an eye out would be timely. There have been various visual versions of H. G. Wells seminal novel (1898) but only one, not very good, production actually set  as was the original novel  in Victorian times. This new version is similarly set. The three-part mini-series comes from mammoth productions in association with the BBC. It centres around George (Rafe  Prometheus & Life of Pi  Spall) and Amy (Eleanor Tomlinson), a couple defying the prejudices of society as they attempt to start a life together, but now amidst the chaos of an alien invasion. Filming took place earlier this year (short 'on set' visual here). Promotional short video here.\n\nNew series, The Crossing, has been cancelled after one 11-episode season. The Crossing sees 500 washed up on the NW coast of the US but though most are drowned 47 survive. Long story short, they are refugees from 180 years in the future and a war with superhumans called the Apex. First airing on ABC in April, the first season ended in June. It was, however, cancelled early in May after viewing figures fell from 5.4 million plus 3 million streaming, to 3.6 million plus 2.1 million streaming. For those wishing to catch this then be assured that the principal story thread is concluded within the season (though there remains a clear potential to take another thread further).\n\nStar Trek: Discovery season 2 is to see Spock and a new commander. Christopher Pike (the captain who commanded the Enterprise before Captain Kirk) is to appear in Season 2. As is Mr Spock who seems somehow connected to signals from deep space. Season 2 airs in January (2019) on CBS in the US, and there will be four short films this autumn to bridge the season gap. Season 2 trailer here.\n\nNew actor to play Spock  Gregory Peck's grandson. Ethan Peck will be playing Spock in Star Trek: Discovery when it returns for its second season next year.\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation is to return. And Patrick Stewart will reprise his role as Jean-Luc Picard. Sir Patrick made the announcement himself at Trek con. He himself could hardly believe it when he was asked as it has been two decades since the last television episode in 1994 and Sir Patrick is now aged 78. The last time he played the role was Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). So how come this has happened? Well, early indications were that Star Trek: Discovery had helped CBS All Access boost its subscribers and this has now been confirmed. So to build on this success CBS All Access has commissioned a new season of Next Gen'. Some of those working on Discovery will be helping with the new Next Gen' episodes' production. Roddenberry Entertainment President Eugene Rod Roddenberry (son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry) is also involved.\n\nNichelle Nichols has sadly been diagnosed with dementia. Nichelle, 85, is known for playing the Communications Officer on the original Star Trek television series and films. She is one of the three extant members of the six-strong, lead cast. This announcement follows a dispute between her son and her manager earlier in the summer that went legal. It was reported that her son wanted care for Nichelle while her manager wanted her to continue to work. So far only her short term memory is principally affected; her long-term memory and ability to converse remain largely intact. The term being used for her condition is 'moderate progressive dementia'. +++ We hope she is continuing to enjoy life.\n\nThe Good Place season 3: Spoilers ahead warning: Given the heaven-based comedic fantasy show's Hugo Award nomination appeal, we thought we'd share some of the show's news. The cast chatted to a reporter at this year's SD ComicCon. The NBC's show's season 3 will see a number of story arcs each resolved quite quickly, almost episodically. Not long into the season all four humans will be in the same room. Finally, the cast are frequently thanked by parents for the show giving them a way to swear in front of their young offspring. The interview can be seen on YouTube.\n\nThe Orville to return with season 2. The Star Trek spoof (think the Hugo Award-winning Galaxy Quest) series has, as previously reported, been renewed for a second season. The launch date has now been confirmed as 30th December (2018). The gossip has it that Robert Picardo (who played the holographic doctor on Star Trek: Voyager) will be reprising his role as Alara's father. Also the season is likely to explore more SF tropes than the first season due to the first season's individual episode response from the show's fans and viewing figures. You can see the season trailer here.\n\nStranger Things season 3 has been delayed. Season 3 was originally slated for this autumn (2018) but Netflix has now postponed it until next summer (2019). The science-fantasy horror series is set in a fictional town in Indiana, during the early 1980s. Stranger Things concerns the abduction (and then the consequences) of a 12 year old boy by a creature from an alternate dimension; the government has a research facility that have created a portal to this dimension. The series has a high (90%+) Rotten Tomatoes rating and season one was in 2017 nominated to the Hugo Award short-list for Best Dramatic Presentation. For those without Netflix, season one and two are available as DVD box sets. You can see the previous season 2 trailer here.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory is to have a 12th season but a 13th no longer seems possible. Yes, we have been here before as back in 2014, it was mooted that the show would end with season 10 in 2017. Well now, over this summer (2018) the creators and cast have been giving their usual promo interviews and the question of the show's future has inevitably come up with an apparent decision last month. Piecing together the 'don't' knows' and 'we'll have to sees', this appears to be the situation. As we know, season 11 ended with Amy and Sheldon tying the knot. First up, in case you had not heard, there will be -- as previously reported -- a season 12. Second up, season 12 begins with the Shamy honeymoon. Third up, season 12 will see crossover reference to other characters from the Young Sheldon series that itself has completed its first season.\n\nFinally, as for a possible season 13, the cast are all contracted to a provisional further season. Most of the cast and the shows scriptwriters are up for a season 13 (and with the principal cast earning what they do, no real surprises there). However, late in August it was announced that there will not be a season 13! Apparently, it has been reported that Jim (Sheldon Cooper) Parsons wanted to be free to pursue his theatre and cinematic career. It therefore looks like that after 12 seasons and 279 episodes The Big Bang theory will end? Or will it? There is nearly a year to go before the supposed final episode will be broadcast. It is therefore not beyond the realms of possibility for some sort of deal to be struck, be it a break before a possible season 13, or even the slating of some specials. Certainly the money is there, and the rest of the cast are reportedly willing. So, who knows?\n\nBig Bang Theory Howard Walowitz's space suit has been auctioned for US$12,000 (£9,000). The space suit was closely modelled on a real, contemporary Russian space suit by the costume company Global Effects. Though not as heavy as the real space suits, the Big Bang Theory replicas did need fan assisted ventilation: they were that good. Authentic Soyuz spacesuits worn by astronauts on the ISS have been auctioned for as much as US$50,000.\n\nZ Nation spin-off series, Black Summer, to come to Netflix. We previously reported Z Nation's renewal for a 5th season of the zombie action comedy show. SyFy's Z Nation's season 4 ended with the release of the Black Rainbow (that threatens both humans and zombies alike). Could this be related to Black Summer? What we do know is that Netflix is producing eight episodes of this spin-off series. Apparently, it will not have a comedic dimension, as has Z Nation, but will be more a straightforward zombie series. Also, the eight 'episodes' are not going to be episodic but part of a single adventure more akin to eight parts of a very long film.\n\nWynonna Earp is to be renewed for a fourth season. The western-style, gun-toting fantasy show is set in the present day with Wyatt Earp's great-great-granddaughter coping with a family curse. Season four will see 12 episodes next year (2019). To get a flavour of the show, see the season 3 trailer here.\n\nColony has been cancelled. The alien invasion show had a great premise but not much story progression. The USA Network series has not been renewed for a fourth season. To get a flavour of the show (as said, neat premise) see the season 3 trailer here.\n\nTales From The Loop is to be a new series based on the wonderful SF art pictures of Simon Stalenhag. The Swedish artist Simon Stalenhag produces some striking SF art and his pictures have inspired this series. The series will explore the town and people who live above 'The Loop', a machine built to unlock and explore the mysteries of the universe. The Swedish production and management company Indio and Fox 21 Television Studios will be co-producing the project. Amazon Studios has placed an eight-episode straight-to-series order. 'Tales From The Loop' was originally the title of a two-volume book set of Simon Stalenhag's artwork that which blends pastoral scenes with wild robotics and futuristic machinery. The background explanation is that a group of teenagers, in the late 1980s, live near a Swedish particle accelerator known as the Loop. When it malfunctions strange things to happen in their backyard. See also the 4-minute news video on YouTube to see some of the inspiring artwork.\n\nBrian Ralphs post-apocalyptic graphic novel Daybreak to be a Netflix series. The comedy drama sees Josh, a 17-year-old high school outcast, searching for his missing girlfriend Sam in post-apocalyptic Glendale, California. Zombie 'ghoulies' and Mad Max style gangs could yet stop him. Netflix has ordered 10 episodes.\n\nStar Trek 4 writers to oversee new Lord of the Rings television series. J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay will helm the forthcoming Amazon television series that is expected to air in 2020 or 2021.\n\nJoss (Buffy) Whedon is to write and direct The Nevers. The series concerns a gang of Victorian women who find themselves with unusual abilities, relentless enemies, and a mission that might change the world. The series will be shown on HBO and this venture marks Whedon's move from major network television to premium cable. (A sign of today's changing television scene.) The Nevers are people who should never be like this, who should never have existed. People who people are not of the natural order.\n\nThe Expanse television series was axed and then resurrected! Based on the two writer pseudonymous author James S. A. Corey series of novels (that includes Abaddon's Gate) the space opera series was cancelled by Syfy in May (2018). As it happens, the novels are apparently a favourite of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and, whether or not this is significant, Amazon has picked up the series. Amazon Prime is to stream and this may mean variable-length episodes. Expect season 4 next summer (2019).\n\nGhosted has been cancelled after one series. It was a sort of X-Files comedy spoof from the US company Fox. Fox is not known for its comedy and now has no live action comedies at all. If you want to see what you missed here's the show's intro trailer.\n\nTimeless has been cancelled yet again. And, yet again, revived. The time travel show concerns a research agency fighting to prevent renegades editing Earth's history (for which read US history of the past 150 years) to create a better future. (Season 2 trailer here.) This is the second time the Sony Pictures Television show has been axed after its first season but NBC then decided to air another following fan action. Sadly, after season 2 (which ended at the start of the summer) NBC declined to pick it up for a third series. For the show's fans this meant that it ended on a mid-action point: our protagonists' duplicates turned up from the future(?) promising to save the day. Shawn Ryan, the show's creator, wants to make a for-TV film to wrap up the overarching plot. It now looks like this may happen as a two-hour finale has officially been approved by NBC and Sony Television. It could just possibly be ready for a December (2018) screening.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars series is to return. See the preliminary teaser trailer here.\n\nBatwoman to become a television series. Vampire Diaries writer/producer Caroline Dries is to write and produce. Debuting in a 1956 edition of Detective Comics, Batwoman was Kathy Kane, a rich Gotham socialite and former circus performer who uses her money and skills to fight crime. However all that changed with the DC Comics universe Infinite Crisis' of the mid-1980s when she became Kate Kane, a Jewish LBGTQ character, one of the first-openly gay characters in the DC universe. So who knows which version they'll use but the smart money appears to be on Kate Kane. (Not to be confused with Batgirl who originally was Commissioner Gordon's daughter, Barbara, and which is currently to be brought to the big screen by Joss Whedon). The Australian actress Ruby Rose is to play the lead. The show is expected to air either in late 2019 or early 2020.\n\nAutumn 2018\n\nForthcoming SF Books\n\nThe Soldier by Neal Asher, Tor, £9.99, pbk, ISBN 978-1-509-83624-1.\n\nA woman and an AI try to keep an alien technology contained\n\nDoctor Who: TARDIS Type Forty Instruction Manual by Richard Atkinson & Mike Tucker, BBC Books, £14.99, hrdbk, ISBN 978-1-785-94377-5.\n\nThe guide as to how to use the TARDIS.

It is also artificial, though they have absolutely no idea of who created it or how (or why), only that it is hundreds of millions of years old. Naturally mankind has moved into the area and populated it and, whilst each planet is different (some modern, some medieval), groups and alliances have formed and, over the millennia, changed and changed again. It is a hundred millennia after Iron Gods. The Spin is at the end of its life and its diminished inhabitants are divided between those who live unknowingly in the relative paradise of one of hundreds of Virtual Realities - 'vrealities' - and those who scrape a living in what remains of the real world. But running the increasingly huge servers needed to maintain the vrealities is draining the last resources of the Spin, leading to conflict between those who tend the servers and those who believe they should simply be switched off, and so killing millions. There is one individual who divides his time between the real and the vrealities, finds himself caught up in this escalating and seemingly futile war. Meanwhile, in a remote star system, an ancient insectoid called Skarbo the Horologist observes The Spin. He has been doing so for several lifetimes. But now he notes the accelerating signs of decline in what he unfashionably considers to be a giant complex clock. And Skarbo too is about to die for the very last time. He had resigned himself to never visiting the object of his studies, but decides to make a last journey - travelling across a war-torn galaxy to what will be his final destination: the Spin. There he will learn of the artificial system's past - and its future This is part of a series of standalone stories the writing of which (though very distinct from) has a vague feel of Banks' 'Culture' novels. See previous The Creation Machine and Iron Gods. Elsewhere on this site Andrew Bannister is also a scientist and has given his thoughts on the 20th century scientists that have inspired him.\n\nXeelee: Redemption by Stephen Baxter, Gollancz, £20, hrdbk, ISBN 978-1-473-21721-8.\n\nThe Xeelee are back for the last time . . .

They wanted the perfect home, but theyll have to survive on the one they found. They dont realize another life form watches and waits Now, we have to be upfront and honest, mentioning that the author is the same Sue Burke who has done a number of convention reviews for us.

Of course, don'ttake our word for it, check out the meta-scores at online book retailers (though of course buy this at a real, bricks and mortar bookshop or direct from the publisher).\n\nXX by Angela Chadwick, Dialogue Books, £12.99, hrdbk, ISBN 978-0-349-70024-3.\n\nWhat happens when IVF treatment enables two women to have child?

Investigative reporter Ross Hunter nearly didnt answer the phone call that would change his life  and possibly the world  for ever. Id just like to assure you Im not a nutcase, Mr Hunter. My name is Dr Harry F. Cook. I know this is going to sound strange, but Ive recently been given absolute proof of Gods existence  and Ive been advised there is a writer, a respected journalist called Ross Hunter, who could help me to get taken seriously. What would it take to prove the existence of God? And what would be the consequences? This question and its answer lie at the heart of Absolute Proof. The false faith of a billionaire evangelist, the lifes work of a famous atheist, and the credibility of each of the worlds major religions are all under threat. If Ross Hunter can survive long enough to present the evidence . . .\n\nThe Minds of Billy Milligan by Daniel Keyes, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, £9.99, pbk, ISBN 978-1-409-16390-9.\n\nOK, this is not SF but this true story is SFnal and Daniel Keyes is well known for his Flowers for Algernon. This is the first UK publication of an American classic: the true story of Billy Milligan. Billy Milligan was tormented by twenty-four personalities battling for supremacy over his body  a battle that culminated when he awoke in jail, arrested for the rape of three women. Among the twenty-four were Philip, a petty criminal; Adalana, the affection-starved lesbian who used Billys body in the rapes; David, the keeper of the pain; and the Teacher, Billys alter egos fused into one. In this gripping account, Keyes examines the landmark trial in which Billy was acquitted of his crimes by reason of insanity, bringing to light the most remarkable and harrowing case of multiple personality ever recorded. We thought you would want to know this was out.\n\nProvenance by Anne Leckie, Orbit, £8.99, pbk, ISBN 978-0-356-56698-2.\n\nThis is set in the same universe as her multi-award-winning 'Ancillary' trilogy but (seemingly) quite separate to it.

The more he learns, the more he comes to realize that ball lightning is just the tip of an entirely new frontier in particle physics. Although Chens quest provides a purpose for his lonely life, his reasons for chasing his elusive quarry come into conflict with soldiers and scientists who have motives of their own: a beautiful army major with an obsession with dangerous weaponry, and a physicist who has no place for ethical considerations in his single-minded pursuit of knowledge.\n\nNoumenon Infinity by Marina Loestetter, Harper Voyager, £14.99, pbk, ISBN 978-0-008-22340-3.\n\nSpace opera that follows on from Noumenon.
