        "text": "Christmas in July Ranked\n\nRe-watched on BBC iPlayer as part of my ‘Christmas in July’ 2023 marathon\n\nI am so torn about this one. On the one hand there’s still some of that great humour that defines Blackadder at its core (though I could’ve done without a lot of the gross-out which feels out-of-place in a series which got its laughs through wit and clever dialogue) and the bigger budget with VFX is not a deal-breaker, the biggest problem is for something that aspires to be the big finale to the franchise, it’s nowhere near as long as it should’ve been. There’s way too much story and settings to be fully satisfied in a half-hour format; if this was expanded…\n\nWhat a sad way for such a beloved franchise to go out.\n\nBLACKADDER is a classic British TV comedy. Instead of feeling like a show that had four seasons, it feels like four separate series, each one set in a different time period and slightly retooling the formula with new variations on the characters (Series 1 is set in the Middle Ages, Series 2 during the Elizabethan era, Series 3 during the Napoleonic era, and Series 4 during World War I). The first series is generally considered the weakest, but the second and third are both good, and the fourth one in particular is one of my favorite shows of all time. There were also a few specials that aired…\n\nThis short reformation of the Blackadder gang came ten years after the final series, and was put together to run in the ill-fated Millennium Dome, that Greenwich white elephant opened to celebrate the arrival of the 21st century.\n\nBlackadder has built a 'time machine' which he has put together to impress his appalling dinner guests. Taking Baldrick with him he plans to bring back an array of disgusting items to prove he's been away - of course, it is initially a scam, but ...\n\nThrough their time travel, our heroes manage to change the course of history in more than one epoch - Edmund steals Maid Marian from Robin Hood (an OTT Rik Mayall with more than a whiff of…\n\nBlackadder: Back and Forth is a New Year's special for the iconic British history comedy series, for the first time set in present day but with a time machine. Hence, Blackadder and Baldrick can visit different parts of world (but mostly English) history before the new millenium begins. Actually quite a cool, potentially funny idea and the a logical step for the special's setting. Does it still work? Short answer: It didn't hold up as well but it was still good. Long answer:\n\nA lot of the charme of the original four Blackadder series and previous specials was that, apart from the first and weakest one, they were all produced on a tight budget with limited and very-cheap looking sets…"
