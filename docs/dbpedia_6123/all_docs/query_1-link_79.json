        "text": "The plot thickens at WNEM-TV5 as more details emerge about the sudden departure of beloved lead anchor David Custer. After 11 years as a trusted voice in local news, Custer is now at the center of a lawsuit against the station.\n\nWe told you just last week that Mid-Michigan television viewers were left shocked after learning of the sudden departure of David Custer, a cornerstone of WNEM-TV5’s news team. The Emmy Award-winning journalist, beloved for his integrity and compelling storytelling, announced that he was informed on July 1st that his contract would not be renewed. His tenure at the station came to an abrupt end on July 28th.\n\nWe are now learning more details regarding his sudden departure and reasons that could finally answer some of the bigger questions viewers and fans have had. According to Mlive, the controversy began when Custer reportedly provided \"truthful but unflattering\" statements about the station's inner workings during a Human Resources probe. His honesty may have cost him his job, but it also sparked a legal battle.\n\nReports indicate that through his attorney Tom R. Pabst, Custer had filed suit in Genesee County Circuit Court just 6 days before his July 28th termination. In the suit, Custter names WNEM, Gray Media Group, General Manager Kenneth Frierson Jr., and News Director Jayne Hodak Soboleski as the defendants.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Custer is requesting a judgment of $100,000 along with attorney costs and interest. The lawsuit centers around 3 violations of three counts, discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. All 3 counts are part of the Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act:\n\nAccording to Mlive, Custer was not the only employee with issues at the station which led to an HR investigation against Soboleski, an investigation that Custer himself was interviewed for by Human Resources. Although those HR investigation files with testimonies are supposed to be sealed, Mlive reports that management obtained Custer’s statements from HR which started a flurry of treating Custer improperly and in a negative way at the station.\n\nOf course, this is a developing story and we will keep you updated. As for David Custer, those close to him say he is taking it one day at a time and is missing doing what he loves in a community he adores, and thanks his viewers for their kindness and support."
