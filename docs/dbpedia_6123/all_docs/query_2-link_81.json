        "text": "In late-to-the-party news, I finally watched the pilot last night, as the Blu-ray chat put it in mind. I probably would have checked it out earlier, but I completely forgot that Gold (or at least a lot of its content) was included in my Now TV package. Oops.\n\nAnyway, pretty good, I thought! Not on the level of any of the later episodes I’ve seen (including Series 1) and in particular a lot of Edmund’s put-downs felt like they could have used another draft or two, but it definitely had the right rhythm to it.\n\nThe way they’ve nested it within a documentary about it is a bit annoying though. I’d really prefer not to have seen clips and images from the pilot and heard discussions about the pilot’s content before actually getting to watch the pilot. I’d have also preferred to watch the full opening and closing credits properly, not cut to a bunch of comedians watching it at a screening and applauding in a way that felt largely performative.\n\nI’m baffled about why they didn’t just make the pilot episode a dedicated programme, and then make the documentary aspect a separate programme shown straight after. Not only would this have alleviated the above grievances, but it would have made the documentary part better, because they could have shown a compilation of the people at the screening reacting to the episode rather than just showing the beginning and end, and they could have freely discussed more in depth about the story and jokes of the episode.\n\nAlso, unless I blacked out for it, they didn’t cover how the pilot was unearthed, which I was curious about. Maybe that story was just too boring, I don’t know.\n\nAs Warbodog asked, my thoughts upon my (re)watch of Series 1 of Blackadder, aka “The Black Adder”:\n\n– It had been so long since I last saw this, that I didn’t twig just how much of episode 2 is a direct copy of the pilot, like pretty much all of it, which is impressive given the hundred year setting difference. It makes the pilot’s absence from the box set sting a little less. And the Series 1 version has Tony Robinson, Brian Blessed, and the proper version of the theme song, so it’s obviously the superior version. Although the pilot version does have Robert “Todhunter” Bathurst himself.\n\n– Right off the bat the production quality is great – the costumes, the sets, the location work, the visual effects, and the prominence of music from Howard Goodall is almost Red Dwarf-esque. I don’t think the show needed to grow in that regard.\n\n– On top of it being unfair that Series 1 has the reputation of being bad, I realised that it’s also unfair that Series 1 Edmund is known as the “stupid” counterpart to the versions of later series. While he definitely has his moments of clumsiness and duncery (episode 1 is probably when he’s at his stupidest), he’s still always coming up with verbose put-downs and schemes, and he’s most often playing the straight man to Percy (and even to Baldrick on very rare occasion). The vast majority of Series 1 Edmund dialogue you could give to the later Blackadders with very little editing. It’s just in Series 1 Rowan Atkinson delivers those lines in a silly voice while making a face and wearing an especially stupid looking outfit. He’s far from being a un-mute Mr. Bean in this, and the fact that they were able to remake the pilot (where his performance was more like Series 2-4) without really changing Edmund’s dialogue or his characterisation much kind of proves that. In fact, it’s obvious Harry is a much bigger idiot than Edmund on average.\n\n– I will concede however, that Edmund in Series 1 is compromised in his characterisation, and it leaves the overall dynamic unbalanced. Because you have Edmund who is generally clever, but he has a stupid voice and stupid expressions, and will suddenly become stupid if a plot point or a joke requires it. Then you have Percy as the reliably stupid one, and Baldrick as the notionally most clever one, but Baldrick really doesn’t contribute much, so he kind of feels like he’s just… there a lot of the time.\n\n– It was pretty bold how much weirdness they put into the setting with this one. Not just the ahistorical “Richard IV” stuff, but the supernatural stuff too. Episode 1 has both witches and a ghost, and episode 5 is resolved with voodoo. I’m not sure whether I like it or not, but it’s striking.\n\n– Brian Blessed doesn’t just steal every scene he’s in, he more or less steals all the episodes too. His presence is consistently delightful. However good the later series are, Series 1 will always have that over them.\n\n– Episode 4 might be my favourite of the series, for having Jim Broadbent and Miriam Margoyles (who had an unfairly difficult task in selling herself as repulsive, but managed to sell it well enough by just looking constantly crazed), and it gave us some genuine continuity with Edmund’s marriage to Princess Leia. Although she was absent from episode 6, so I hope she got out OK.\n\n– Why wasn’t Rik Mayall credited in episode 6? Was it just too obvious it was him, like a Stan Lee cameo in a Marvel movie? Or did he just find the idea of “Mad Gerald as Himself” so funny a credit that he was willing to be uncredited?\n\n– Does it seem strange to anyone else that Edmund’s killing of Richard 3 never comes back to bite him? Not that it was needed, but it seemed like the kind of thing that would have played into the final episode. Considering he cruelly abandons Percy and Baldrick in episode 6, and they know his secret, you’d expect them to use that against him. I guess they’re just ride-or-die Black Adder Buds. “Do you think that I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference?” as Dr. Who once said, except this time said about someone who has been a selfish arsehole throughout the friendship.\n\n– Speaking of Doctor Who, IAN CHESTERTON IS IN EPISODE 3???\n\nThe whole Bob plot of a woman pretending to be a boy so that she can get a job is straight out of Shakespeare, Viola in Twelfth Night basically (which would have been extra funny in Shakespeare’s time because a female character like Viola would have been played by a boy). So the plot is more riffing on that than any true homosexual or transgender aspect.\n\nIn terms of the song lyrics, Blackadder is heterosexual and so falling in love with a boy is weird for him (on some subconscious level he perhaps realises Bob is really Kate), and I think Kate is always pretty clear that she considers herself a woman and is just pretending to be a man rather than genuinely feeling that she is changing gender during her deception. So the song is really just summarising the plot.\n\nOf course, I understand the allusion being made, and I don’t have a problem with the plot in general, I’m just picking at the song. The way I see it, the minstrel is meant to have a Greek chorus quality to him, and so however you justify it (obviously if he’s an actual 16th century minstrel, he’ll have just the same prejudices as anyone else from the era), the effect just doesn’t feel right.\n\nIt’s also way too much of a reach to judge the meaning as “falling in love with boys is weird… for you specifically, as a heterosexual man” when clearly it was meant to be an echo of the doctor’s viewpoint, that being gay is just weird in general.\n\nAnd I agree that Kate is obviously not meant to be trans, but the only way I can make sense of that line of the song is if the singer is generically grouping all masculine or gender non-confirming women (a group which includes trans men too, in the mind of the bigoted) together as uniquely unattractive freaks. Otherwise the comment of “fancying a boy is weird… especially if it’s actually a girl!” makes no sense.\n\nAnyway, it’s not really a big deal as it’s just the credits music, and the episode is pretty great overall. I just found it noteworthy that the minstrel would make this kind of first impression."
