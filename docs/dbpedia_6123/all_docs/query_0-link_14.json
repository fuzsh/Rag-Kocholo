        "text": "One of Britain's most recognizable (and most larger-than-life) character actors, Tom Baker is best known for his record-setting seven-year stint as the Fourth Doctor in Doctor Who (1963). He was born in 1934 in Liverpool, to Mary Jane (Fleming) and John Stewart Baker. His father was of English and Scottish descent, while his mother's family was originally from Ireland. Tom, along with his younger sister, Lulu, and younger brother, John, was raised in a poor Catholic community by his mother, a house-cleaner and barmaid, who was a devout Catholic, and his father, a sailor, who was rarely at home.\n\nAt age fifteen, Baker left school to become a monk with the Brothers of Ploermel on the island of Jersey. Six years later, he abandoned the monastic life and performed his National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps., where he became interested in acting. Baker then served on the Queen Mary for seven months as a sailor in the Merchant Navy before attending Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama in Kent, England, on scholarship.\n\nBaker acted in repertory theaters around Britain until the late 1960s when he joined up with the National Theatre, where he performed with such respected actors as Maggie Smith, Anthony Hopkins and Laurence Olivier, who helped him get his first prominent film role as Rasputin in Nikolaus und Alexandra (1971). His performance in this film earned him two Golden Globe Award nominations, one for best actor in a supporting role and another for best new star of the year. A couple of years earlier, Baker had made his theatrical film debut in The Winter's Tale (1967).\n\nDespite appearances in a spate of films, including Pasolinis tolldreiste Geschichten (1972), In der Schlinge des Teufels (1973), Sindbads gefährliche Abenteuer (1973) and Das Labor des Grauens - The Freakmaker (1974), Baker found himself in a career lull and working as a labourer at a building site. However, the BBC's Head of Serials, William Slater, who had directed Baker in BBC Play of the Month (1965), recommended him to producer Barry Letts, who was looking for a replacement for Jon Pertwee as the Fourth Doctor in Doctor Who (1963). Baker's performance in Sindbads gefährliche Abenteuer (1973) convinced Letts that he was right for it. It brought Baker international fame and popularity. He played the role for seven years, longer than any actor before or since.\n\nAfter leaving Doctor Who (1963) in 1981, Baker returned to theatre and made occasional television and film appearances, playing Sherlock Holmes in Der Hund von Baskerville (1982), Puddleglum in The Chronicles of Narnia story Der silberne Sessel (1990) and Hallvarth, Clan Leader of the Hunter Elves, in Dungeons & Dragons (2000).\n\nPeter Davison was born as Peter Malcolm Gordon Moffett on 13 April 1951 in Streatham, London. A decade later, he and his family - his parents, Sheila and Claude (an electrical engineer who hailed from British Guiana), and his sisters, Barbara, Pamela and Shirley, moved to Knaphill, Woking, Surrey, where Davison was educated at the Winston Churchill School. It was here that he first became interested in acting, taking parts in a number of school plays, and this eventually led to him joining an amateur dramatic society, the Byfleet Players.\n\nUpon leaving school at the age of sixteen, having achieved only modest academic success with three O Levels of undistinguished grades, he took a variety of short-lived jobs ranging from hospital porter to Hoffman press operator. He was still keen to pursue an acting career, however, and so applied for a place at drama school.\n\nDavison was accepted into the Central School of Speech and Drama and stayed there for three years. His first professional acting work came in 1972 when, after leaving drama school in the July of that year, he secured a small role in a run of \"Love's Labour's Lost\" at the Nottingham Playhouse. This marked the start of a three-year period in which he worked in a variety of different repertory companies around Great Britain, often in Shakespearean roles. He then made his television debut, playing a blond-wigged space cowboy character called Elmer in \"A Man for Emily\", a three-part story in the Thames TV children's series The Tomorrow People (1973) (April 1975). Appearing alongside him in this production was his future wife, American actress Sandra Dickinson, whom he had first met during a run of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" in Edinburgh. They married on 26 December 1978 in Dickinson's home town of Rockville, Maryland, USA.\n\nDavison spent the following eighteen months working as a file clerk at Twickenham tax office. He also took the opportunity to pursue an interest in singing and songwriting, which led him to record several singles with his wife. He later provided the theme tunes for a number of TV series, including Mixed Blessings (1978) and Button Moon (1980). Davison played the romantic lead, Tom Holland in Liebe zu Lydia (1977), a London Weekend Television (LWT) period drama serial transmitted in 1977.\n\nDavison's greatest acting breakthrough came when he played Tristan in the BBC's Der Doktor und das liebe Vieh (1978), based on the books of country vet James Herriot. It was a highly successful series, which ran initially for three seasons between 1978-1980. His success in Der Doktor und das liebe Vieh (1978) brought him many other offers of TV work. Among those that he took up were lead roles in two sitcoms: LWT's Holding the Fort (1980), in which he played Russell Milburn, and the BBC's Sink or Swim (1980), in which he played Brian Webber. Three seasons of each were transmitted between 1980-82, consolidating Davison's position as a well-known and popular television actor.\n\nIn 1980, Doctor Who (1963) producer John Nathan-Turner, who had worked with Davison as the production unit manager on Der Doktor und das liebe Vieh (1978), cast him as the Fifth Doctor in the series. Taking over from Tom Baker, who had been in the role for an unprecedented seven years, Davison was seen as a huge departure as he was by far the youngest actor to date. Davison announced he was taking the lead role in Doctor Who (1963) on the BBC's lunchtime magazine program Pebble Mill at One (1972) on 3 December 1980, when he discussed with the presenter a number of costume ideas sent in by viewers and was particularly impressed by a suggestion from one of a panel of young fans assembled in the studio that the new Doctor should be \"like Tristan Farnon, but with bravery and intellect\".\n\nHis appearance in Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis (1981), was recorded on 19 December 1980 and transmitted on 2 February 1981, by which time the viewing public were well aware that he would soon be taking over the lead role in Doctor Who. There was in fact only a month to go before he would make his on-screen debut in the series - albeit a brief one, in the regeneration sequence at the end of Logopolis: Part Four (1981).\n\nHis first full story was in Castrovalva: Part One (1982), the first story of season nineteen transmitted on 4 January 1982. Another significant change for the series was that it was taken off Saturdays for the first time, instead being broadcast on Mondays and Tuesdays. Davison was an immediate hit as the Doctor, with ratings picking up considerably from Tom Baker's final season. Several episodes from Davison's first season achieved over 10 million viewers, which would be the last time these numbers would be achieved in the original run of Doctor Who (1963). One particular success from Davison's first season was the stylish return of the Cybermen in Earthshock: Part One (1982), which became the most popular Cybermen story since the 1960s.\n\nAs the incumbent Doctor, Davison took part in the major celebrations of the 20th anniversary of Doctor Who (1963) in 1983, which included the multi-Doctor special The Five Doctors (1983). Nevertheless, Davison found himself dissatisfied with his second season on Doctor Who (1963), feeling that the writing, directing, budgets and tight recording schedules in the studio were frequently letting it down. With this in mind and fearing typecasting, he finished his tenure at the end of his third season in The Caves of Androzani: Part Four (1984). He left on a high, as it has been repeatedly voted one of the best stories ever by fans.\n\nDavison became a father when, on December 25, 1984 (one day before the couple's sixth wedding anniversary), Dickinson gave birth to a daughter, Georgia Elizabeth, at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London. Ten years later, however, the marriage broke down and they separated and later divorced. Most of Davison's work since then has been in the medium for which he is best known: television.\n\nHis credits include regular stints as Henry Myers in Anna of the Five Towns (1985), as Dr. Stephen Daker in A Very Peculiar Practice (1986), as Albert Campion in Albert Campion (1989) and as Clive Quigley in Ain't Misbehavin (1994) all for the BBC, and as Ralph in Yorkshire TV's Fiddlers Three (1991). In addition, he has reprized his popular role of Tristan Farnon on a number of occasions for one-off specials and revival seasons of Der Doktor und das liebe Vieh (1978).\n\nDavison has returned several times to the world of Doctor Who (1963). In 1993 he appeared as the Fifth Doctor in Doctor Who: Dimensions in Time (1993), a brief two-part skit transmitted as part of the BBC's annual Children in Need Charity appeal, and in 1985 he narrated an abridged novelization of the season twenty-one story \"Warriors of the Deep\" for BBC Worldwide's Doctor Who audio book series. In addition, he has appeared in a number of video dramas produced by Bill Baggs Video. In 2003 and 2004 he appeared as quiet and unassuming detective \"Dangerous Davies\" in The Last Detective (2003), the Meridian TV adaptations of Leslie Thomas's novels.\n\nColin Baker was born in 1943 in the Royal Waterloo Lying-In Hospital in London during an air raid. He spent his earliest years in London with his mother, while his father served in the armed forces. He narrowly avoided an early death during the wartime blitz when a piece of flying shrapnel just missed him, embedding itself in the side of his cot. After the war, Baker's father took a job as managing director of an asbestos company in Manchester. The family moved north to live in Rochdale, although Baker attended school in Manchester.\n\nIt was during his early schooling that - through the mother of one of his fellow pupils, who was a casting director at Granada TV - he had his first experience of acting. It was 1954 and the series was called My Wife's Sister (1956), starring Eleanor Summerfield, Martin Wyldeck and Helen Christie. Colin Baker went on to attend St. Bede's College in Manchester, where he was invited to take part in their annual productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. The twelve-years-old Baker appeared in the chorus for a production of \"Yeoman of the Guard\" and, a year later, landed a more major part - playing the female lead, \"Phyllis\" - in \"Iolanthe\".\n\nAfter completing his schooling, Baker went on to study law. One day during this period, he and his mother went to see an amateur production of \"The King and I\" at the Palace Theatre, Manchester. Inspired by the performance and encouraged by the president of the company that had staged the Amateur Dramatic Society and quickly became hooked on acting. Baker took a job as a solicitor but, as time went on, became less and less interested in this career. Finally, at the age of twenty-three, he decided to become a full-time actor.\n\nBaker joined the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), where he trained for three years. At the end of this, he was summoned with two of his fellow students to see the head of the drama school, who gave them rather gloomy predictions for their future prospects as actors and suggested that they seek alternative careers. These predictions proved somewhat wide of the mark as not only did Baker go on to great success but so too did his fellow students - David Suchet (who - amongst many other achievements - starred in LWT's award-winning productions of Agatha Christie's \"Poirot\") and Mel Martin (whose numerous credits include the series Liebe zu Lydia (1977), also for LWT). After leaving LAMDA, Baker took a temporary job driving a taxi in Minehead in order to be near his then-girlfriend. He then received a call to come to London to audition for a part in a BBC2 drama series called The Roads to Freedom (1970), which he won. This led to further TV roles, including two more for BBC2: \"Count Wenceslas Steinbock\" in \"Balzac's Cousin Bette\" (1971) and \"Prince Anatol Kuragin\" in an ambitious twenty-part serialisation of Lev Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" (1972-72). He also took on a wide range to theatre work, including several William Shakespeare festivals, appearing in productions of \"Macbeth\" and \"Hamlet\".\n\nIn the mid-seventies, Baker landed the role that would make him \"the man viewers love to hate\". This was \"Paul Merroney\" in the BBC1 series The Brothers (1972). After \"The Brothers\", Baker married actress Liza Goddard, who had played his on-screen wife in the series, but the marriage eventually ended in divorce. Baker later married actress Marion Wyatt. Theatre work kept Baker almost constantly busy for the next five years including appearances in everything from comedies to thrillers, as well as more Shakespeare. He also had a few further TV roles, including one as \"Bayban\" in \"Blake's 7: City at the Edge of the World\" (BBC, 1980) and one opposite Nyree Dawn Porter and Ian Hendry in the drama series, For Maddie with Love (1980) (ATV, 1980).\n\nBaker's next TV role after \"For Maddie with Love\" was as \"Maxil\" in the Arc of Infinity: Part One (1983) story, \"Arc of Infinity\". Shortly before Baker took the role of the Doctor on \"Doctor Who\", he and his wife suffered the loss of their baby son, Jack, to cot death syndrome. Baker subsequently became a passionate fund raiser for the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths, with many of is personal appearance fees being donated to the charity. Baker's time as the sixth Doctor was cut unexpectedly short, initially by BBC One controller Michael Grade's hiatus between the twenty-second and twenty-third seasons and then by the decision of Grade to oust him from the role.\n\nAfter his departure from \"Doctor Who\", the actor returned to the theatre, appearing in highly successful runs of \"Corpse\" and \"Deathtrap\" and having a four-month stint in the West End farce, \"Run for Your Wife\", with Terry Scott. TV work included a guest appearance in the BBC's Casualty (1986) and presenting assignments on programmes for the Children's Channel. After directing a play called \"Bazaar and Rummage\", Baker was asked to play the Doctor once again - this time on stage, taking over from Jon Pertwee in the Mark Furness Ltd production, \"The Ultimate Adventure\". This tour proved to him that, despite the brevity of his time as the Doctor on TV, he had amassed a loyal following amongst younger viewers.\n\nIn the 1990s, Baker had continued to pursue a successful career, mainly in the theatre. He has made regular appearances in pantomime, and his stage work has included roles in the musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' \"Great Expectations\" and in a comedy entitled \"Fear of Flying\". He has also starred in the \"Stranger\" series of videos made by Bill Baggs Video, alongside a number of other actors known for their work on \"Doctor Who\".\n\nSylvester McCoy was born Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith on 20 August 1943, the only child of Molly Sheridan and Percy James Kent-Smith, a couple living in Dunoon, Scotland. His mother was Irish. Percy James Kent-Smith was killed in the Second World War a couple of months before his son was born, and he was brought up by his mother, his grandmother (Mary Sheridan), and his aunts. He attended St Muns Primary School in Dunoon. The headmistress, Rosie O'Grady, was keen that her young charges obtain decent jobs upon leaving the school and so organized regular talks from people in all manner of professions.\n\nMcCoy expressed an interest in every job, and as a result eventually found himself given an afternoon off school to go to see a local priest about entering the priesthood. He left school, joined Blairs College, a Catholic seminary in Aberdeen, and between the ages of twelve and sixteen trained to be a priest. At Blairs College, he realized that there was more to life than could be found in Dunoon and discovered classical music and history, which fascinated him. He eventually decided to become a monk and applied to join a Dominican order, but his application was rejected as he was too young. He returned to school and soon discovered the delights of the opposite sex in the form of fellow students and determined he didn't want to be a priest or a monk after all.\n\nOn finishing his education he took a holiday down to London, from which he never returned. McCoy approached a youth employment center looking for a job and impressed by the fact that he had attended a grammar school, they instantly found him a job in the City working for an insurance company. He trained in this job and stayed there until he was 27 before deciding that it wasn't really for him. With the help of a cook at London's Roundhouse Theatre, McCoy gained a job there selling tickets and keeping the books in the box office.\n\nMcCoy joined the Ken Campbell Roadshow. Along with Bob Hoskins, Jane Wood, and Dave Hill, he would start performing a range of plays with the umbrella theme of \"modern myths\". McCoy found himself in a double-act with Hoskins. After Hoskins left, and being booked at a circus, director Ken Campbell improvised a circus-based act about a fictitious stuntman called Sylvester McCoy and thought it would be amusing if the program stated that this character was played by \"Sylvester McCoy\". While at the Royal Court Theatre, one of the critics missed the joke and assumed that Sylvester McCoy was a real person. McCoy liked the irony of this and adopted the name of his stage identity. During one of their UK engagements, the Roadshow team was invited up by Joan Littlewood, who was directing a production of \"The Hostage\", before the performance of her play. This led McCoy to bona fide theater, and he was subsequently invited to appear in numerous plays and musicals.\n\nMcCoy was starring at the National Theatre in \"The Pied Piper\", a play written especially for him, when he learned that the BBC was looking for a new lead actor to replace Colin Baker, who had been unceremoniously dumped from Doctor Who (1963) on the orders of Michael Grade. McCoy won the role as the Seventh Doctor despite reservations from Grade and Head of Drama Jonathan Powell, who were by this time monitoring producer John Nathan-Turner's decision-making very closely. McCoy's first season took the slightly pantomimic style of Baker's final season, Trial of a Time Lord, even further and received a very dubious reception from the press and fans. Nathan-Turner put McCoy in a pullover covered in question marks, which McCoy later admitted he didn't like.\n\nBy the time of McCoy's second season, the new script editor, Andrew Cartmel, was trying to make the series darker and more complex. In the third season, his costume was changed from a fawn jacket and paisley scarf to a dark brown jacket and an altogether more muted and subdued image, but the pullover remained. Despite forming a close bond with co-star Sophie Aldred and the general standard of the stories rising again towards the end, the series was obviously starved of funds and ratings were fairly poor throughout the McCoy era, with the series being trounced by ITV's Coronation Street (1960). The BBC's opinion of Doctor Who (1963) was that it was an embarrassment. In 1989, the new series head, Peter Cregeen, pulled the plug.\n\nAfter Doctor Who (1963) McCoy worked extensively in theater and on television. In theater he appeared in \"The Government Inspector\" twice in tours during 1993 and 1994, and in between these he starred as the Narrator, Thomas Marvel, in the stage version of H.G. Wells's \"The Invisible Man\". In 1995, he starred in Zorro: The Musical\".\n\nOn television, his credits include Frank Stubbs Promotes (1993) and Rab C. Nesbitt (1988). He also created the character of Crud in the cult television series Ghoul Lashed for Sky TV. In 1996, he was contracted to reprise his role as the Doctor, handing over to an eighth incarnation of the Time Lord in the earthly form of his friend Paul McGann. Also in 1996, McCoy devised and presented Reeltime Pictures' I Was a 'Doctor Who' Monster (1996), a special video tribute to the men and women who had played the monsters of Doctor Who (1963).\n\nLugubrious-faced English actor Geoffrey Palmer was born in London, the son of a chartered accountant. After leaving school, he did his national service with the Royal Marines where he became a field training and small arms instructor. He then briefly tried his hand at accountancy before his girlfriend talked him into joining the local amateur dramatics society. Palmer started as an unpaid assistant stage manager at Croydon's Grand Theatre and afterwards spent several years touring in repertory. In 1955, he made the transition to television, at first as diverse straight supporting characters in popular early comedies like Bootsie and Snudge (1960) and The Army Game (1957), a series detailing the exploits and misadventures of a group of national service conscripts at a surplus ordnance depot. During much of the early and mid-60s, Palmer cut his teeth on prolific dramatic roles that came his way in seminal crime and mystery shows (Simon Templar (1962), Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (1961), Der Baron (1966), Freie Hand für Barlow (1962)), in which he often appeared as military types, politicians, or as legal or medical professionals. His personal credo was to never turn down a part.\n\nBy the 70s, Palmer was becoming well-established as a supporting actor in British television. He made two appearances in Doctor Who (1963) in the early 1970s (most notably as the ill-fated Edward Masters, Permanent Under-Secretary to the Minister of Science, in \"The Silurians\"). From there, he went on to co-starring success as Leonard Rossiter's hapless brother-in-law in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin (1976), Wendy Craig's perpetually aloof and gloomy husband in Butterflies (1978) and as Lionel Hardcastle in the hugely popular sitcom As Time Goes By (1992) (opposite Judi Dench). He also starred as Major Harry Kitchener Wellington Truscott in Fairly Secret Army (1984), playing a buffoonish, reactionary ex-army man attempting to shape a disparate bunch of characters into a secret paramilitary organisation. Smaller (but memorable) guest spots have included his sausage-loving doctor in The Kipper and the Corpse (1979), the Foreign Secretary in Apocalypse WOW (1982) and Field Marshal Haig in Blackadder - Vierter Teil (1989). Palmer appeared opposite Judi Dench again in the James Bond thriller Der Morgen stirbt nie (1997) and in Ihre Majestät Mrs. Brown (1997) as Queen Victoria's chief secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby. In 2007 he returned to Doctor Who as a guest star in the David Tennant era.\n\nAn instantly recognisable actor with jowly features and a trademark deadpan expression, Palmer's stock-in-trade persona was of a world-weary, disenchanted, droll or sarcastic disposition. Conversely, in private life, he was said to be rather more lighthearted and humorous. He once declared \"I'm not grumpy. I just look this way.\" Nonetheless, he was great value in the BBC series Grumpy Old Men (2003) as one of several middle-aged narrators complaining about assorted irritations in modern life. In addition to several audio books, Palmer also lent his familiar voice to radio and to Audi TV ads. In his spare time he was an avid fly fisherman and a longstanding member of the Garrick Club in London.\n\nPalmer was awarded in OBE in December 2004 for his services to drama.\n\nChristopher Benjamin was fifteen when he made up his mind to become an actor. He recollected having already performed in school plays, playing Oberon in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Later acting opportunities arose in amateur dramatics in Bath, while Benjamin was undergoing a two year stint of national service with the Royal Air Force. His father died during his first term at RADA. After graduating in 1958, Benjamin began his professional career in repertory at the Manchester Library Theatre, often playing old men, because \"they couldn't afford real old men\". From 1958 to 1965, he became prolific as a leading actor at the Salisbury Arts Theatre, playing anything from Willy Loman and James Tyrone to Falstaff. Benjamin spent several seasons at the Bristol Old Vic (1962-67) and was later (1978-2002) regularly engaged by the RSC, headlining several times in the mid 90's in the title role of Julius Caesar. In addition to frequent portrayals of Shakespearean clowns Dogberry (Much Ado About Nothing) and Bottom (A Midsummer Night's Dream), Benjamin also reprised his dual roles of Vincent Crummles and Walter Bray in Trevor Nunn's production of The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, upon the play's transfer to Broadway's Plymouth Theatre in October 1981. He also played Falstaff again at Shakespeare's Globe, two years before his retirement from the stage in 2012.\n\nWhile the theatre has always remained his favorite medium, Benjamin has been equally prolific on screen since 1961, albeit in smaller roles. He has usually portrayed amiable, garrulous or avuncular characters with a comedic edge. Early on, Benjamin was featured on three occasions in Nummer 6 (1967) and made other guest appearances in popular ITC series Der Baron (1966), Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (1961), Simon Templar (1962) and Jason King (1971). He also made a strong run in period drama, his notable roles in this genre having included Annette's Belgian lover Prosper Profond in BBC's acclaimed Die Forsyte Saga (1967); the roguish bachelor Sir Hugh Bodrugan in the original series of Poldark (1975); corrupt landowner Sir John Glutton, chief nemesis of Die Abenteuer des Dick Turpin (1979); the amicable, though none-too-bright Bennet family friend Sir William Lucas in BBC's famous adaptation of Stolz und Vorurteil (1995); and the inept hack actor Montfleury in the made-for-TV movie Cyrano de Bergerac (1985) (a role Benjamin had previously performed several times on the stage).\n\nTelevision director David Maloney, who had been a BBC floor manager at the time of Benjamin's work on The Forsyth Saga, remembered the actor and cast him in the part of bluff theatrical impresario and reluctant hero Henry Gordon Jago in the Doctor Who (1963) serial The Talons of Weng-Chiang, alongside Trevor Baxter in the role of Professor George Litefoot. The duo proved immensely popular with audiences. In fact so much so, that Benjamin reprised his role as Jago in a fourteen-part series of audio plays ('Jago and Litefoor') for Big Finish Productions, released between 2010 and 2021. Benjamin had previously appeared as project director Sir Keith Gold in the Doctor Who serial Inferno and later played Boer War veteran Colonel Hugh Curbishley in the 'Agatha Christie episode' The Unicorn and the Wasp.\n\nIn 1996, Benjamin and Amanda Redman co-starred as MI6 agents in the BBC radio drama Colvil and Soames, a six part murder mystery created and written by Christopher Lee.\n\nAn avid cricket fan, Benjamin has been retired since 2021 and lives in Hampstead, London. He has been married to the actress Anna Fox since 1960. They have three children."
