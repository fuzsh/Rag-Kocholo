        "text": "TV Series of Some Interest\n\nFrench mini-series created by the same team that released Count of Monte Cristo with Depardieu. The classic novel (one of my favorites of all time) is huge in scope, story and depth, and even this six hour version is lacking some details, but is amongst the best ones and comes second only to the 1934 version. Jean Valjean steals a loaf of bread out of hunger, finds himself in prison for 19 years due to his attempted escapes and acquires a nemesis in the form of the rigid Javert who has an over-developed passion for justice. He is released full of hate and darkness, encounters a kind bishop that changes his life, adopts a miserable woman that had an exceedingly difficult life, then her daughter who was exploited and abused by a despicable family, etc... do I really have go into the rich and well-known plot? This adaptation is mostly good with some flaws. It is faithful to the book for the most part and has time to develop most of the sub-plots. Depardieu is good as always but seems a little tired relative to his other energetic performances, and the casting for Fantine, Cosette, the Thénardier couple and a few other characters are all superb. The flaws: Except for the 1978 version with Perkins, I have yet to see an adaptation that gets Javert right and here they use a wooden, overly-evil Malkovich who seems more intent on enunciating his French than in developing the depth his character needs. The first part is too rushed and chopped and gives no sense of time passed, Marius is miscast and off-putting, the bishop is very miscast, the Thénardier family is just a little too cartoonishly evil, and Eponine's character is also a tad miscast. I suppose my love for the novel makes me picky and that this series is pretty good despite its casting flaws, but the 1934 version got most of this stuff right. Comparisons: The 1978 version with Perkins has a good Javert but a poor Valjean and it leaves out or changes (or adds) too much of the story. You should also ignore the generally lifeless 1958 version with Gabin (even though it had a great Eponine and a good Thernadier), the weak 1982 version with Ventura (that also lacks subtitles), the Hollywoodized 1935 version with Laughton, any of the overblown populist musical versions including the unwatchable 2012 musical version, as well as the 1998 travesty that butchered the story and characters. Instead of all these watch this one, or the even better 1934 version by Bernard which won me over despite the fact that I generally prefer modern adaptations. In addition, if you love the book and just want to hang out with another fan who thinks the modern world revolves around the book, watch Lelouch's self-conscious modernized 1995 version that plays like extended annotations on the book.\n\nIsraeli/HBO docu-drama mini-series about a very challenging event in Israeli history in 2014. There was a kidnapping by Arabs of three Jewish youths, a country-wide upheaval, prayers and utmost concern while an extended search went on for the boys, and the final finding of the boys' dead bodies 2.5 weeks later, causing all of the country-wide upheaval to turn, understandably, into mourning and hate. The event that is challenging is not the kidnapping itself, but the aftermath, and the actions of some Jewish youths who mistranslated the country-wide emotional disturbance into a brutal terrible crime in revenge against a random Arab. The reason why I say that this is the focus is because Arabs commit horrible crimes on purpose all the time, and the Jews do not. So it's therefore the act of revenge that requires close observation and meditation, not the act of animals that do this all the time. This is the approach of this mini-series: It covers the murder by the Arabs in the first episode, then spends nine more episodes covering the reactions, the act of revenge, the police investigation, the aftermath, and the reaction of the Arabs, all in minute and very meticulous detail. Actual footage is carefully mixed with reconstructed drama extremely well, although many details were altered for dramatic effect or structural simplicity, the core of the story and the important details remain intact as far as I can tell, and careful detailed research is combined with some unavoidable speculation. The actors are all incredibly good and everything feels authentic. Now, as I said, a good Jew that holds himself to higher standards should wonder how such a thing could happen, and whether the film-makers' intentions were in this vein or not, the show delivers this opportunity and provides strongly for this interpretation. Of course, the reaction to this series was predictable. The masses that blindly hate Israel and Jews use this as ammunition, and the overly-defensive right attacked the show for being one-sided. Even Netanyahu, who along with almost everyone else in the country condemned the act of revenge, aggressively attacked this show. But all of this is mostly misguided. Of course, by focusing so extensively on the act of revenge and by including the reaction and suffering of the Arabs, it provides ammunition to the anti-Semites. And this is a somewhat valid critique. If it were me, in theory, I would have considered only showing the Jewish side of the revenge and skipped the Arabs, because that is what needs to be contemplated. And this would have driven the point home. But this is not practical since one cannot examine the act without showing its repercussions as well. In addition, this series doesn't skip the cause and context of the act like many news outlets; It devotes the first episode to it. In the end, haters will ignore this context just like they always do and they hardly need this as ammunition to feed their hate. The important part, like many Jews did when this happened, is to face the shock and try to understand how a Jew could do such a thing. Because Jews don't do this. And this is an emotion and a theme repeated in this series many times: The widespread disbelief by all Jews that something like that could have been performed by a Jew. Even the mother of the killed Jews condemned the act of revenge and this is shown in this docu-drama. Sure the more fanatical factions supported it. But most Jews were shocked. And this fact, together with the fear of repercussions, obviously caused the handling of this act to be heavily laden with many delicate conflicting emotions, difficult responses, and a bit of political maneuvering which need to be examined and meditated on. And that's why I believe this show dived into so much detail of the act, and why, despite the trouble that this mini-series caused, I am basically supportive.\n\nHyped HBO docu-drama on the Chernobyl catastrophe, deserving of praise but at the same time, deeply flawed. All movies based on history are typically fact-checked and compared to real events nowadays on the internet, and most historical shows have factual errors, and this show is no different in this sense. What does make this different is that this mini-series is presented as factually true rather than 'inspired by real events and dramatized for effect', and also the argument that many of the factual errors in this case are very important or basic and not just nitpicking details. Despite this, the show did many things extremely well. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert or to know the truth obviously, but my opinion is based not only on many fact-checks on the internet made by people that were there, or by people that studied the event for years, but also on my instincts while watching this show that some specific aspects felt inauthentic or implausible. First, the good: The dread, intense fear, and horrifying aspects of this event are all captured very well, the show managing to depict the big picture as well as the small picture, and the stories about the individual people and their horrifying tragedies amplify the bigger horror. The physics, and the way the event itself is explained from a scientific point of view is unanimously praised. The acting is superb, and the tiny details in the sets, locations, the plant and the event itself all impress. The show also manages to portray many Russians as inspiringly stoic and heroic. At the same time, the writers of this show were too desperate for clear villains and heroes. So, while there is general agreement that some of the managers of the plant were criminally negligent and sloppy, the people who knew them didn't agree that they were necessarily bad people, and this show goes out of its way to make them despicable. As far as I can tell, it's not so black and white. It's even worse with the Soviet government: While everyone agrees that the cover-ups, inefficiencies, oppressive control and corner-cutting production were all big factors in this tragedy, that doesn't mean that you have to portray officials as evil villains that force civilians at gunpoint, and a KGB psychopath at every corner. There is a big difference between inefficiency plus corruption, and evil. There is also a smaller problem with some of the heroes here, giving them too much credit. For example, it has one man stand up against the Soviet empire in a dramatic court hearing, except this never happened. There are even fundamentally things wrong with the way radiation is portrayed here, which is at the core (sorry) of the story. The show doesn't separate between radioactive dust, and people that are dying of radioactivity, treating people like they are infected with a contagious virus, and even I know that these are not the same. This alone means many of the scenes here are complete nonsense, but it also misinforms the public and perpetuates a myth that has caused harm (e.g. not helping people exposed to radiation). There are many more errors, but these are the bigger problematic ones. Actually, the one that bothered me personally the most for some reason, is that HBO just had to go Woke even here and take the credit away from dozens of male scientists and give it all to a fictitious woman, who not only outsmarts everyone in the show, she also is above everyone else morally and is behind the (real) scientist's death-defying heroic stand. So not only did they re-appropriate credit, they had to make men look bad compared to women... yet again. It's bad enough to create female characters that don't resemble reality in fictional shows, but to do this to real-life heroes in the name of political-correctness is repulsive. To re-iterate: Mostly great; Deeply flawed.\n\nHBO mini-series focusing on the life of the second president of the USA. As opposed to Rome, this sticks to pedantic historical facts rather than adding entertaining fiction with violence and sex. The casting and acting are superb across the board. The recreation of the period and the historical detail are magnificent and mostly accurate as far as I can tell, like history books and pictures come to life. I almost got chills when I saw George Washington move. The execution is flawless; it's the choice of subject matter and politically-correct characterizations that raise questions: John Adams allows for an unusual biopic and approach for exploring the birth of the USA, his less-than-heroic behaviour and difficult personality presenting the opposite extreme of a whitewashed glamorization. His anger and stern personality is not the problem, but the way they made him so whiny and dependent is problematic. The writers also went to questionably great lengths to make his wife as pivotal as possible, undermining his achievements and personality even more in dozens of little ways. The writing feels forced as a result, distorted towards an agenda rather than the truth. The first episode sets up the personality and feel of the period very well with a courtroom drama. The second episode is a riveting exploration of the politics behind the declaration of independence. The poor third episode features some obvious personal bias by the writers against France who understandably depict them as decadent, but also as childishly stupid. The rest of the episodes become increasingly more tedious and dull, focusing on pedantic politics or family drama, with some highlights (the audience with King George being one riveting scene). All in all, besides the biased & flawed writing, it feels like a teaser of what might have been if they had only explored the revolution as a whole with all of its colorful personalities and events instead of focusing on only one smaller aspect of it, Adams's contributions and personality notwithstanding. Granted, it's a biopic and not a war movie, but it still feels like the focus was on a less interesting aspect of the revolution, especially since the writers went out of their way to undermine him.\n\nWar And Peace (2016)\n\nAs with Les Misérables, War & Peace is a massive complex novel that seems almost impossible to get just right, and although there is a steady stream of adaptations, there are almost always some characters or elements that feel wrong, due to the many vivid and varied characters in the novel, and the challenge of getting the tone, location and period of the rich novel just right. Whereas Les Misérables got its definitive version early on by the French in 1934, with a valiant later attempt with Depardieu, this novel, I dare say, has yet to see its definitive version. Single movie-length creations are all obviously butchered (War & Peace is the benchmark definition of a massive novel). The Russian 7 hour adaptation by Bondarchuk in the 60s features the most mind-boggling epic scale, war scenes, and authentic costumes, and has the huge advantage of being made by Russians, thus giving it that crucial and unique Russian air, character and manner, and it features good casting for the most part. It is the closest thing to a definitive adaptation, except that it is marred by old-school overly theatrical, stiff and dramatic acting and performances. The 1972 BBC adaptation with Anthony Hopkins is the most detailed (to a fault) and true to the novel with its 15 hours, but the tone is somewhat too British, and the feel is sometimes too made-for-TV, especially with indoor scenes (outdoor scenes are surprisingly epic for a 70s BBC production), and it also features some theatrical performances that fail to bring some characters to life, with a mixed bag for the casting. Anthony Hopkins is superb as Pierre, and the rest range from good, to acceptable to poor (a bad Natasha). Which brings us to this 2016 BBC adaptation: At just over 6 hours, the coverage is a nice compromise that keeps the story moving along without losing important things. Visually it is beautiful, the production is superb, and the cast do bring the many characters to life. The problem is that they are not bringing them to life as the Russian characters that Tolstoy painted. For starters, they lack the Russian mentality and personality, much much more than in the 1972 version. It's not just that they are 'not Russian'; Their behaviour as written by Tolstoy which the screenplay has them do, very often does not match their characterizations as performed by the actors. There are also anachronisms, modern behaviours and dresses that don't go with attitudes of early 19th century Russian aristocracy. For example Lily James is a delightful Natasha, she just isn't a Russian 19th-century Natasha. And Paul Dano brings Pierre to life with subtle sensitive acting, he's just way too modern. And the first few episodes feel much more like a Jane Austen novel with an emphasis on romantic drama rather than on the many deeper Russian themes and characters of Tolstoy. Another example: The critical crisis when innocent Natasha is supposed to be swept away by the manipulative romantic gestures of Anatole is all wrong here, simply because Anatole is too much of an obvious narcissistic trashy modern brat in this show with no subtlety and no old-school Russian poise and confidence. So, while this is another close one that gets many things right and which is enjoyable (I admit I enjoyed this one the most), there are, once again, also many things that feel off and wrong and I could not shake off this feeling of wrongness for the whole show. One needs to work on the actors mentality for adaptations like these, not just on the costumes and the acting.\n\nEscape at Dannemora\n\nImpressively realistic and well acted 7-hour prison-escape thriller and drama based on a true story. It's like a long version of Escape From Alcatraz, only with much more color and character, taking its time to build the characters and tell the detailed story. The attempted escape involved the help and very personal involvement of a prison employee with severe personality defects, and it is this angle that gives the story its unique character. It is also acted by Patricia Arquette in one of those mind-boggling performances where she transforms herself so completely and subtly, physically and behaviour-wise, that she loses herself completely in the role and becomes that person. Its one flaw is that it is too realistic in the sense that the characters are thoroughly unlikeable, but they are acted so well, it is a compelling watch nevertheless. Only since the primary characters are so morally warped and despicable, the thriller aspects of this show are not as strong, since a sane person should want them not to succeed. The primary reasons, then, to watch this show, are the acting, the directing, and the story-telling. These are all done very nicely indeed, and are at the level of The Wire. A must-see-once.\n\nNight Of, The\n\nHBO remake of the first season of the British \"Criminal Justice\", which I haven't watched. It is superbly reminiscent of The Wire in the sense that it goes for meticulous detail, realism and authenticity when exploring a criminal case, while attempting to explore and enlighten a bigger theme: In this case, the idea that the justice system often does not work. Not by using the cliched approach of real criminals going free, but the opposite: That of an innocent caught in the web of a complex system populated by otherwise good, working people that just want to close the seemingly simple case and go home. Now I have seen hundreds of murder-mysteries in dozens of shows, many with plots similar to this one, but almost none of them managed to do what this mini-series did in terms of transporting you into the story via realistic details, down-to-earth characters, and a natural flow of developments. This is the huge strength of this series: The theme of mistakes in the justice system, although not presenting anything new to anyone that isn't naive, is demonstrated very clearly to the point of being morally thought-provoking. And most of the characters are superb, especially Bill Camp as the subtly efficient and quietly manipulative detective, and John Turturro as the cheap lawyer who is torn between his self-serving money-grabbing agenda, and his conviction that this is a case like no other that needs an honest and hard-working approach. There are flaws, albeit minor, but they accumulate: After a few episodes, too much time is spent as a cliched prison movie straight out of Oz with implausible developments as the prisoner deteriorates all too fast. Riz Ahmed is good at first, albeit seems overly medicated and subdued, but when it's time to act tough, he just becomes catatonic and detached for the rest of the show, bringing to mind Rami Malek. As a murder-mystery for the audience to solve, the show doesn't work, simply because it presents a solution out of left field. As a court-room drama it's not bad however, although many of them take way too long to pursue obvious investigations that could bring the truth to light, and this seems contrived just to allow the drama to unfold. But, the above strengths still make it very watchable, well-done and fascinating. So, I'm going to classify this as must-see-once.\n\nTruthfully, I was getting ready to hate this one before it even started, expecting a crude Wokefest given its topic and timing. But it surprised me, and is actually very well done. It's a true-crime mini-series based on the true story of a very clever and careful serial-rapist, the law-enforcement hunt for this man, and the very tragic story of one teenage girl who was handled poorly by the police until she retracted her story. I am the last person to let even traces of a Woke agenda off the hook, but this one was done 100% the right way, and I found this a touching and gripping story, so credit is due. Of course, some aspects of the story were probably altered, but, if this was done, it didn't lose its realism, and there was no preaching, barring a couple of realistic rants, and any criticism of men was done fairly and realistically. Perhaps the women here were all portrayed as super detectives, but I didn't mind. Some male policemen were useless and insensitive, and others were helpful, and husbands and bosses were not bad guys. Again, all done fairly and realistically. It is also a nicely done police-procedural drama-thriller, and the exhaustive investigate work was solidly written and made fascinating. But it's the drama of the victims that stays with you, without hitting you over the head with a hammer. Kudos.\n\nBased on both seasons.\n\nWe didn't need Jim Carrey in a TV series to remind us that TV has become something else entirely in the past decade. But the real star of this show is one of the producers/directors. This constantly surprising quirky comedy has Michel Gondry's fingerprints all over it. It is about a Mr. Rogers-esque star of a children's show that has been influencing generations of children all over the world for decades, becoming a living legend. But his personal life leaves a lot to be desired, to say the least. This Showtime show doesn't just take the easy way of portraying a monster behind the scenes of a children's show, but does something much more interesting than that: It portrays a man who really lives and breathes everything that he represents in the children's show; all of the light-hearted, kind, gentle behaviour and morals, his mind constantly in a musical fantasy world, despite all of the dark, depressing, crazy and rude world of violence, death, kinks and dementia. Except that some of it is also bubbling inside him, being repressed as best he can, causing outbursts of insanity. And nothing hurts him more than a death of his own child. Carrey portrays this complex man beautifully. The show explores his mind, his world, family, co-workers and friends using imagination, inner-fantasy, dreams, light magical realism, and even the children's show serves as a reflection of his inner turmoil. The writing loves to play around, constantly introducing strange people, props and flashbacks that seem tangential to the story, then connecting the dots in surprising ways much later. The family that helps him and manages him try to maintain the delicate and very commercial empire that they built around this man, but it's a losing battle. The first handful of episodes are jarring and somewhat clunky, with light quirky comedy and material for children mixed with trashy shock-tactics of rampant sexual situations and violence, like a bastard child of Gondry and wild Showtime trash. And it often tries too hard to be edgy by juxtaposing a children's show, child actors and a childish man with lots of trashy sex. And the quirkiness does undermine the drama, albeit in interesting ways. But it gradually melds together and finds a much better balance, becoming a very unique, quirky and interesting dramedy. It often feels off, like too many people pulling in different directions and adding clashing tones, but it's one-of-a-kind.\n\nAround the World in 80 Days\n\nFour and a half hour mini-series of this classic Jules Verne story, and definitely the better version when compared to Niven's and Jackie Chan's versions, but not without its flaws. Phileas Fogg is a pedantic, punctual and stiff English gentleman who takes on a wager that he can travel the globe in 80 days. He hires Passepartout, a French butler with previous employment in a circus, one day before he leaves. There is suspicion that Fogg may have robbed a bank before leaving, using the trip as a ruse, and, of course, everything goes wrong throughout the journey, forcing them to improvise and spend a lot of money to find alternate transportation, while surviving the Alps, Indian kidnappers, a Chinese emperor, a Jesse James shootout, and so on. A princess saved from death in India provides the romantic interest. Pierce Brosnan as Fogg is quite good, but a bit distracting, Eric Idle as Passepartout sports a silly Pythonesque accent and seems miscast but at least makes the role entertaining, Ustinov as the detective is also a bit too silly and bumbling, but the romantic angle is boosted and handled very well as Fogg has to handle intruding emotions. Another flaw is that the writers added extra adventures and meetings with historical celebrities, some of which are entertaining but many of which detract from the realism (a gun showdown with Jesse James? c'mon!). They also made Passepartout too much of a womanizer. The first episode is slow and very flawed, but the third episode is exciting even if you know the ending. In short, most certainly not the definitive version, but quite good nevertheless despite its flaws.\n\nJane Eyre (1983)\n\nI watched this one after the 2006 version, and this was a breath of fresh air. All of the flaws of that adaptation were corrected by this one, replacing it with only minor flaws of its own. The story flows in this one without obvious gaps and strange behaviour. The childhood drama isn't cartoonish and is balanced by humanity and personality. And even the dialogue is much more rich, eloquent and elegant than the 2006 adaptation. Timothy Dalton is Rochester, in a performance that brought some mixed reviews. His stage presence and acting talents are beyond reproach, and he only falters a bit with his gentler side, chemistry and emotional attachment to Jane. His good looks are also at odds with the book that describes an ugly man. Zelah Clarke as Jane is passable to good, but the chemistry problem affects her as well. The production is above-average for an 80s BBC production. In short, a very good adaptation and this is the preferable one to get if you love the book, but it is not without its minor flaws.\n\nBased on the single season.\n\nAn FX take on the caper series, one of three in the same year. Like The Shield, this features multiple ongoing plot-lines, developments that sometimes border on the incredulous but remain intense and mostly believable, and powerful lead performances. A group of professional thieves get entangled with the Chinese Mob, crooked cops, the FBI, etc. while dealing with family and girlfriend issues and pulling off complex jobs. A special point of interest is the unique, tense relationship between the black leader and his white step-daughter. The Shield had more interesting characters but the only real flaw in this great series is that it was cancelled after only 6 episodes, all the massively building story-lines ending abruptly. Could have been great if not for the cancellation.\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nA good Israeli terrorist-thriller series snatched by Netflix. It is about an ongoing war between undercover operatives on the Israeli side that specialize in infiltrating Arabs as Arabs while taking down terrorists, and various terrorist elements on the Arab-Palestinian side. But this is not a regular espionage and terrorist thriller since, given the nature of the war between close neighbors, it very often involves the families on both sides, and, in this series, it soon resembles a feud much more than a war, with one kill leading to a personal revenge-kill on the other side and so on ad-infinitum. Not that the show equates one side with the other, nor does it take sides nor even compare them; This show goes out of its way to avoid politics, and this is one of its disappointments. It is a straight-ahead thriller, a pretty good one, with gritty realism and tension that sometimes goes through the roof, but this is all it is. Of course, this won't stop reviewers from getting on their soap-box just because it involves this controversial war and most audiences will leave the show with what they had when they came in. So any review that mentions politics is going to be purely the reviewer's fault. But, as mentioned, this is a disappointment, since a show covering this scene could have done so much more, rocked the boat, presented arguments from both sides, raised dozens of questions, had their characters debate each other even while fighting the war, etc. And none of this ever happens for even one second.\n\nI found myself comparing this one often to 24: As with 24, it features ongoing escalating national dangers, acts of terror, desperate acts of military tactics with agents from both sides often going rogue as things escalate beyond control while becoming personal, forcing them to break the rules and do whatever is needed. As opposed to 24 however, it does not have the silly gimmick of 24-hours, the constant need to cram ridiculous twists and crises in a ridiculous amount of time, the constant implausible hi-tech hacks and infiltrations, etc. As such this show is very much superior to 24 with its gritty realism and down-to-earth tactics and plot developments. On the other hand, it also lacks cleverness most of the time. The methods, while somewhat realistic, repeatedly involve getting suspects to talk using various psychological pressures or tortures, the infiltration is temporary undercover work passing as Arabs for a short time (which doesn't always work), and the war is just brutal action and kills that sometimes deteriorate to fauda/chaos (although it is nowhere near showing the actual level of barbarism that goes on). While this may be somewhat realistic, it's not going to exercise your mental faculties, only your nerves. In fact, often it's quite the opposite as they seem to miss many basic tactics such as covering the back door to stop escapes, and tapping phones of family members. So the show is good, but not compellingly impressive. As far as the personal drama is concerned, it is also minimally solid in the first season, and doesn't reach the levels of, say, Engrenages. But both sides are presented as three dimensional humans with solid (but not compelling) personalities. The second season improves over the first in many ways however, also in terms of complex Palestinian factions that fight with each other, and also in terms of a larger cast, so that it doesn't feel like the world is depending on three or four people. In the end, however, it is what it is: A strong, pretty realistic, above-average action-thriller that will fit the bill for many thriller junkies, but also a big missed opportunity. It aimed small and achieved it pretty well. But it has also reduced a heated and complex war to a feud and to a merely good action thriller.\n\nHBO/Channel4 four-hour historical mini-series on The Virgin Queen. It's interesting to note the widely different screen productions on the Tudor family, especially in the characterization. Reviewers often criticize historical accuracy in the plot details, but the personalities and motivations are always wide open for interpretation. This series covers mostly the latter years of Elizabeth's reign, her various lovers, intrigue with the doomed Mary Queen of Scots, war with Spain, and the many ups and downs with the overly young and stupid Earl of Essex. Helen Mirren as Elizabeth is stupendously complex and alive with many depths, yet I have big problems with the characterization. In this series, Elizabeth is basically an articulate 50 year old high-school drama queen, running from one emotional outburst to another in full view of her council, public and court, yelling threats of death at anyone and everyone on an emotional high, and assigning power to foolish young men just because she felt a twinge in her heart, or crotch as it may be. I can't pretend to be an expert on behaviour in the 16th century, but one would expect nobility to have a minimal level of restraint, poise, elegance and reserve. Not to mention that it makes it hard to understand how the country flourished under such a hysterical woman. That said, it is a tribute to the writers and Mirren that the character is still very complex, fascinating and watchable. Jeremy Irons is also superb as usual. The series is also almost purely from her point of view mostly from inside the palace, and we don't see any wars or much of anyone else's life. The costumes and sets look great, but even they can't compete with Shekhar Kapur visual's spectacle. There is also nasty gore when it comes to executions. In short, very watchable and interesting, but it loses to the stiff competition of Kapur/Blanchett's version.\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nA British cop show that grabs you and forces you to pay attention. Intelligent, intense and, like many British shows, it boasts a strong personality and a fearless edge that most US shows lack. And this is very important in a show about a loose-cannon detective in charge of extreme murders and serial killers. Idris Elba (The Wire) provides most of the character and intensity on this one, managing to elevate and distract from the flaws of the show. Similarities to Dirty Harry include the intensity, and a strong sense of principles and moral justice that is even stronger than his respect for the law and dedication to his job. He also has a dangerous, near-suicidal edge as with Riggs from Lethal Weapon that compels him to confront the criminal and murderers with a mixture of strategy and fearless recklessness. The writing mixes episodic murderers and criminals, each episode offering a very different variation and, usually, an intense criminal, with some two-parters as well as character arcs dealing with his relationships with co-workers, bosses, ex-wife, ex wife's new boyfriend, and a murderess that managed to evade him but continues to have a strange ongoing relationship with him. This last one provides for fascinating developments that alternate between interesting and ridiculous, with questionable conflicting motives and she is used too often as a contrived plot device to save some situations. In addition, characters sometimes do implausibly extreme things just for melodramatic effect, as if the writers wanted to keep pushing the envelope but pushed it too far. Another flaw is the occasional omniscience of Luther who sometimes tends to guess motives and movements correctly and immediately as if by magic. One glaring example is how they managed to filter a phone call amongst thousands just by looking for something 'weird'. Other examples is his over-confidence in his psychological theories and predictions when provoking a psychopath to a frenzy. But there is no denying the greatness of everything else, it's just a shame that the scattered implausibilities keep distracting from the immersive and dark entertainment. This show never insults its audience, but it needs a bit more discipline in the writing.\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nIn some ways, José Padilha is the David Simon of Brazil, having created the superb 'Elite Squad' double-movie about a special SWAT-esque police force in Rio fighting both gangs and corruption, and then this show about global corruption in the whole of Brazil. (He also produced the show 'Narcos' covering Escobar and drug business in the Americas.) This show combined with 'Elite Squad' reminded me of 'The Wire', the circle constantly expanding, and, like 'The Wire', the first season takes several episodes to get off the ground with its intricate detail. It differs, however, in that all of these movies and shows he makes are based on actual events and not just inspired by individual true stories. Also, this show is much bigger in scope, covering corruption in many huge corporations and politicians in the whole of Brazil. It tells the story behind Operation Car Wash, a true investigation that resulted in literally thousands of warrants and hundreds of arrests that go all the way to the very top. Although the show claims to have modified some details for dramatic effect, the names can be matched to actual people and the core of the true story, presumably, is still there. The obsessed detectives in this show have to resort to sometimes mind-boggling games, very clever creativity, and some not-quite-legal tricks to bypass the ubiquitous corruption, and if it weren't based on a true story I would think it implausible. I did not find it as compelling as 'The Wire' for some reason, but it was a gripping, comparable watch nevertheless, with intricate detail and educational complex revelations as to how a system can be so thoroughly corrupt and undefeatable despite miracles, and creative, iron-willed investigators.\n\nHot Zone, The\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nBased on real events involving the spread of frightening viruses, but greatly fictionalized and dramatized in its details and characters. The first season covers ebola, the second covers anthrax. The first season tells of the first encounters with ebola in Africa in the 70s as a backdrop, but primarily tells the story of an ebola strain that emerged in the USA in 1989. Again, the basic story and main events are based on true history, but the details in the screenplay are fiction. This first season does a good job with the dread and terror of the various characters involved, as well as the detailed scientific investigations and the tension involved as new details were uncovered, with plenty of unknowns. I learned a lot from this docudrama even though the drama is fiction, and the drama is well done. There are some clunky and obnoxious aspects in the screenplay though: One is the awkward and misplaced injections of moralizing rants about the handling of AIDS seemingly for no reason other than the writers to preach their views on this subject. Another is the Woke injections of the treatment of a woman in the workplace even though the actual woman involved in this story said in an interview explicitly that she suffered no such treatments. Also, they give her full credit for the findings and make the men inferior even though, in real life, the story is very different. But, overall, it is a good, thrilling and educational show.\n\nThe second season covers an outbreak of anthrax in Russia in 1979 in the introduction, but then focuses exclusively on the anthrax attacks that followed 9/11, using 9/11 as a further dramatic backdrop for the drama. Once again, the primary events in this story are all true and I learned a lot from this show, and the fictional drama is pretty effective. But I had a big problem with the characterization of the supposed perpetrator of the attacks. In real life, the alleged perpetrator was accused but no solid evidence was given, and the accusations were contested, and this show not only runs with him as the attacker, it also portrays him in a way that doesn't ring true. The actor that portrays him is superb, but the writing depicts him more like someone's projected fantasy of a deranged person rather than a real person. I was not convinced in the least.\n\nBased on the single season.\n\nAn extremely tense thriller/drama from Sweden about the Islamic State (ISIS), terrorism and their methods for using radicalized teenage girls or indoctrinating them. One of the plot lines involves a disillusioned Swedish woman living in the heart of ISIS with her baby, and her husband who is a core member of the terrorists, and her harrowing efforts to get herself out of the clutches of ISIS and back to Sweden. She contacts the Swedish Security Service who use her to help their anti-terrorist efforts. The increasing dangers she finds herself in keep growing to truly distressing proportions. Another plot-line involves the Swedish Security Service, their investigations, internal tensions and betrayals, and their race against time to fight imminent terrorist attacks. This is a bit 24-esque with its portrayal of perhaps too-well organized, efficient and capable terrorists, but it's relatively a lot more realistic nevertheless. A third plot-line involves some Arab teenage girls that get caught up in their own emotions over their newfound religion and Muslim misinformation on the internet, and get caught in the web of ISIS, their recruitment scouts, manipulations and grooming tactics. It's generally very well done with tension that sometimes goes through the roof, but it has a few flaws. Some minor spoilers follow: First there is a plot twist with the Swedish Security Service management which is revealed in the final episode which doesn't make sense since much could have been avoided if there was basic communication of need-to-know information or better handling of the crises and the information. Second, agencies should know better by now that radicalized teenagers are not reliable and are not necessarily waiting to be saved. Their decisions when it comes to handling them, including after they are returned to Sweden, were obviously idiotic. Everyone knows you don't trust brainwashed people. Finally, you should know that the ending is harsh.\n\nQueen's Gambit, The\n\nAn unexpectedly super-popular mini-series that somehow managed to make chess more popular again. Seeing as the protagonist heroine is female, I was expecting a feminist fantasy. Although it is a fantasy in the sense that no such female super-player existed with this crazy amount of skill and wins, it is much better than I expected and quite an interesting, enjoyable show. It tells the tale of a prodigy orphan with a troubled family life and bad experiences in the orphanage as she battles a drug addiction while rapidly rising the ranks of the chess world. However, it makes the common mistake of pushing her skills to super-hero territory. Take Judit Polgár as an example, the undisputed top female chess player of all time: She did beat many world champions but didn't win the world championship, and she had many draws and losses in many tournaments. Everyone has losses, even world champions with decades of experience sometimes lose to people with a qualitatively lower rank. This severely damages the realism of this show. But there are also several other elements that balance this out and make this an interesting watch and character study. First, it doesn't shy away from the notorious egos and eccentric behaviours of chess masters, giving her ego and character problems as well for a more interesting and human character study. It also allows many men to contribute to her growth, usually a feminist no-no. Other flaws, however, include a bias against fathers, all 3-4 of the fathers shown or mentioned in this show being cruel or hopelessly irresponsible. Also, she has too much composure while being addicted to alcohol and drugs for most of the show. In the end, however, despite all the above pros and cons, I found it an interesting, involving watch, and they did an amazing job making chess exciting without sacrificing technical authenticity (Garry Kasparov was a consultant). And they avoided making Russians into bad guys, which is admirable.\n\nBased on the first three seasons.\n\nI always thought Karate Kid to be a great movie for juveniles and young teens, but mere cheesy fun for adults, with some great moments despite the cheese. This TV show's greatest feat is to reproduce every aspect of the movie including the cheese, the fun, sloppy fights, the tone and warm human moments, and it manages to balance just the right minimal amount of nostalgia with plenty of new material just perfectly. The clash between harsher 80s posturing and energy that often crosses the border into cruelty, and the new-generation's overly sensitive youth, is great fun and handled nicely. It is easily the Karate Kid for the new generation, and a must-see for fans of the old movies. In the movies, almost no character was completely bad, just misled, lost or swept away by the adrenaline, power and violence of karate. It's the same with this show, and it even messes with your head beautifully by making the Johnny character the protagonist instead of the antagonist, and Daniel sometimes turns out to be the closed-minded unforgiving one, based on his past bad experiences. They combine hot-headedness with contemplative regret and humanity, showing superbly complex human behaviour very nicely, and their interactions, posturing and bickering on this show are often priceless. In this show, these two characters raise and train a new generation of teenagers on karate with the clashing ideologies of defense-only Miyagi karate versus the macho Cobra Kai dojo that not only gives angry teenagers an outlet but also gives many bullied nerds their confidence. This clash erupts in frequent inter-dojo street-battles, in the best tradition of cheesy kung-fu movies, American style. The show gradually bring back as many of the characters from the movies as it can, including the only possible irredeemably evil character from the movies, and the stakes and violence are raised in season two and three, but without forgetting the Miyagi-esque gently inspiring moments as well. I'm happy they didn't try to re-imagine Karate Kid like so many cash-ins nowadays, and the subtle modernizations were welcome and done very well. I enjoyed all of it, the cheese notwithstanding, just like the original movie.\n\nEnd of the F***ing World, The\n\nBased on both seasons.\n\nDespite the descriptions of this series, this is not a teen-show, nor is it about serial killers. It's a drama, black comedy and romance, involving very broken people in messed up situations, and it just happens to feature teenagers as its anti-hero protagonists. Both are dead inside for different reasons. The young man is showing advanced signs of being a psychopathic killer and he assumes that's what he is, and the young lady is constantly rude and lashes out at everyone. They find each other, and proceed to embark on very strange adventures out in the world involving other messed up people, which, of course, forces them to face themselves. There are no cliches or feel-good developments, and the writing is unpredictable. More importantly, the writing is very solid, and except for one ironic coincidence, if features very natural developments and reactions given their characters and odd situations. Episodes are a short 20 minutes, with a continuous story-line, and given its eight episodes per season, this is a very easy and quick watch, like two 2.5 hour movies. The only flaw is that the characters are not that interesting once you get past their broken and harsh facades. A show can have unlikeable characters, but here there doesn't seem to anything there beyond their toxic personalities, since they are very dead inside and act like it too. But it was a solid, entertaining, and fascinating (short) watch nevertheless.\n\nBased on the first two and a half seasons.\n\nA very good show from FX with naturally flowing developments and multiple story arcs reminiscent of The Shield. The character development is unbalanced however. Raylan (Olyphant) is an old school marshal and lawman in a modern world that applies justice by allowing other people to draw first before he shoots them dead, talks straight and honest, refuses to play games, or gives them 24 hours to leave town. To give this approach some reality, they transfer him to a small district in Kentucky that also happens to be his hometown, where the bad guys are local pot and drug dealers, rednecks, white supremacy freaks, and moonshine-swilling petty criminals. Since the district is so remote, the marshal gets to perform random local police work as well. In short, it's an excuse to transport a Western to the modern world. His father is a hardened criminal and so is his friend Boyd (Walton Goggins in top form again), and many of the characters are very smart, terse and practical, making the dialogue and developments a pleasure to watch. Every season tends to feature small crises as well as slowly building arcs with the bad guy of the year, and the writing is consistently good. As mentioned though, the character development is the weaker aspect. If I compare this to The Shield, every character in that show was three-dimensional and every story and character there was compelling. Whereas here, once they set up the character of Raylan, he doesn't really go anywhere interesting and is just there to catch bad guys as a mere two-dimensional sheriff, and Boyd Crowder, on the other hand, is given so many extreme personality and outlook changes, that you get whiplash watching him and it starts feeling unrealistic. The rest aren't really interesting, although there are some characters like Arlo Givens, or Mags Bennett in season two, that stand out with their three-dimensions. It's really mostly about the twists and turns, the deceptions, plotting, crimes and trickery, violence, personal agendas versus friendship and family, and the gun battles. The show is very watchable and entertaining, although it always feels just this side of great, and, in season three they add one too many deceptions, agendas and twists, losing the superb realism of the first two seasons.\n\nDas Boot, as most people know, is a war movie about the experience of WWII submariners living and fighting in the old but very tough u-boat that is starting to become outdated thanks to new Allied technology. It's WWII from the German side, and you would think that sympathy would be impossible, but the experienced officers distance themselves from the Nazis and 'bloated' or 'unrealistic' leadership, and the whole crew suffer so much, that it just becomes a gripping movie about soldiers doing their job under unusually hellish circumstances. This review is not for the superb movie, or even for the mini-series version, but a comparison of the series to the Director's Cut version. To wit, there are at least three versions of this movie: A theatrical 2+ hour cut that always felt butchered and lacking in key scenes even though it was the first version I saw. The superb 3+ hour Director's Cut which features perfect editing and pacing, with all the key scenes, mood and buildup intact. And then there is the 5-hour 'original uncut' version that was viewed in Germany as a TV series. It adds many more scenes of daily life in the U-boat, mood-setting dialogue, lots more camaraderie, most of it very raunchy (too over the top in my opinion), extended scenes, and so on. But you won't miss anything important unless you think that living with these submariners for longer will add to your experience. In other words, the pacing suffers and it becomes more of an interesting experience rather an exciting war movie, and only die-hard fans of the movie version should check it out.\n\nBased on all three seasons.\n\nA different kind of (Australian) crime show by FX. Ray is a legendary, efficient street-thug, or hit-man for hire, but he tries to balance this violent world with his family life and friends, including his little daughter. It's not exactly Sopranos, albeit it made me think of that show sometimes. There is no syndicate or an emphasis on mostly animalistic criminal behaviour; This man is complex, and there is a delicate balance between gentle fatherhood, his roles as boyfriend and family member, and his ruthless life of crime, killing even innocent people. The show doesn't resort to making him a moral person out for revenge, or fighting other criminals; He does also kill innocents. Episodes vary, sometimes between touching drama, and ultra-violence or very dark crime within the same episode. The writing and episode lengths are very tight, as efficient and concise as our protagonist, and very masculine without requiring constant action. It's much more of a character study than plot driven, since many plot elements involving crime are usually solved very quickly with efficient violence. But it's the characters and family interactions that will maintain interest longer beyond the impressive crime and action.\n\nThe first season is relative weak and short but mildly interesting. First episodes merely feature short crime 'assignments' that he has to deal with and short interactions with his family, and his character doesn't really emerge for a while. The two-part finale also uses an impossible sequence of coincidences, breaking the realism. There is also a lack of consequences to his actions, each episode being too self contained. The second season is by far the strongest, featuring many superb character-development episodes, dark and intense episodes, and interesting challenges in crime, and creative, efficient solutions. The third season is a mix of the first and second seasons: Some episodes are only mildly interesting, self-contained missions and quirky behaviour, others have strong character development. An interesting, almost-great show.\n\nBased on the first two seasons and a bit of the third.\n\nThis spin-off of Narcos (which was originally intended to be a part of that show) is actually superior to that one. Not that the production or acting or realism are better; they are at the same level in that regard. The show is better in one simple way: The characters on both sides of the war use their brains rather than just brute force and money. They use strategy, creative ideas, quick thinking, thorough homework, scheming, politics, clever leverage, and there is also actual police-work, investigation and amazingly difficult work to try to work-around a deeply corrupt country rather than just waging a frantic brutal war as in Narcos. So, although the characters are above-average but not amazing, the story-telling is much more interesting. This show tells the Mexican side of the American drug-war, from the chaotic beginnings of bickering dealers and independent marijuana growers in the 70s, to the rise of the Guadalajara Cartel, the 'federation' brought together by the super-boss Félix Gallardo, and his meteoric, ambitious and cleverly scheming rise to power until his greed and ambition gradually become his undoing. The third season, as with Narcos, explores the aftermath with a hodge-podge of stories. Although the subject matter of yet another drug-war is not my favorite subject and the characters are not that gripping, it's well done and interesting material nevertheless, in terms of thrills as well as history, and a compelling one-time watch for two seasons.\n\nMan Seeking Woman\n\nBased on all three seasons.\n\nThis isn't a fantasy or sci-fi show per se, more like a cutesy 'surreal' comedy about relationships where every little thing is taken to an imaginative fun extreme and which often uses fantasy and sci-fi to poke fun at things. For example an unwanted and awkward date becomes a date with a literal troll, every text message in a new relationship becomes a literal global crisis in the presidential/military situation room, or a text-hostage-situation, a challenging relationship issue becomes a training session with a kung-fu sifu, and a fight becomes a battle between giant mecha-robots. This is all done very well and is great fun, and although the relationships and relationship problems are cliched and not really insightful, this technique of fantasy exaggeration is often very creative and actually makes it all quite touching, evoking very familiar life issues via surrealism. And it's also just fun to see what they come up with next. Most of the comedy is from the guy's point of view, along with his juvenile minded bro-buddy, and much of the comedy at first is quite raunchy and juvenile, but the show also varies things a lot and plays around from other points of view, including girlfriends and parents. A lot of the first season involves the woes of a single awkward guy who just can't seem to get a girl, but then it becomes more about longer relationships as he matures. The third season loses some steam but is still good fun. Altogether, despite the juvenile aspects, a very enjoyable watch from start to finish with a colorful imagination.\n\nGood Fight, The\n\nBased on the first three seasons.\n\nA spin-off from The Good Wife, and a slightly different show with a different focus in each season, as well as different pros and cons. In fact, I would describe it as something in between the legal-oriented Good Wife and the satirical and political BrainDead (without the sci-fi), and the result is actually better than those two shows, but with its own flaws. Two characters from The Good Wife find themselves ruined after a scam and scandal involving their family, and are forced to try to pick up the pieces in a new law firm with a different approach and people. The first season is the most similar to Good Wife with a combination of complex family scandal drama and an impressive legal playground with a rich variety of interesting cases and very creative and playful use of the law. The writing is sharper than ever. But the comedy is also better and more pronounced, emphasizing the new crazy world and rules of society, the writing becoming really creative with its wild stories and cases and the sharp-witted and entertaining methods by which they attack the constant stream of problems, cases and wild situations. There are many, many colorful characters, many of them highly intelligent and eccentric, especially amongst the guest stars that make the cases that much more entertaining and challenging. The second season adds more politics to the mix but increases the 'crazy world' satire with the addition of a killer running around killing lawyers. The third season dives head first into politics, craziness and extremism.\n\nThe show is often attacked for its politics. The first season is the most balanced and least political, even less so than The Good Wife. There are hot-topic issues like censorship and terrorism and crooked corporations, and there is a liberal bent, plenty of race issues, a firm with a crusade against police brutality, and it casts women in power everywhere, but it's almost never heavy-handed or preachy. Unlike The Good Wife, this show shows its writers seemingly have moved beyond their agenda, at least at first, and is just interested in making an entertaining and witty show. I enjoyed it. Actually, the one thing that did bother me was the repeated strange writing flaw of not finishing the story or case, often presenting a move that they think is a fait accompli, despite obvious missing pieces. For example, very often towards the end of the case they bring in a last-minute witness that provides seemingly damning testimony, and suddenly we skip to the post-win celebration making me feel like I missed a few scenes, except that the witness is hardly reliable and could have been attacked by the other side easily. Or, as another example, they are supposed to be solving the legal problem of handling abusive language in a social-media platform, then they solve one case with a clever tactic, but the thousands of others are never handled, and the episode ends as if the whole thing is solved. Or other similar sudden happy endings that feel shoehorned in, including season endings that don't close the story-lines. Another flaw is that the cases very often deal with large corporations that are going after the little people, and the lawyers always find some convenient evidence and win even though it is not clear at all at first that the corporations are in the wrong. So there are politics here in the writing as well as a dishonest portrayal of lawyering in order to make the protagonists into heroes. But, overall, these are just flaws in an otherwise entertaining show.\n\nThe Trump bashing and ranting starts to take off in season two amidst the craziness of a world gone mad. The entertainment factor also goes up though, as the situations get funnier and crazier and the characters have to find creative ways to deal with the madness. Whether one votes for Trump or not, one must agree that Trump could use at least some bashing (as long as it's accurate and not used for a political agenda). However they lose this impartiality somewhere mid-season-two. Even the protagonists, and many of the lawyers start ranting often against Trump, and many of the twisted or exaggerated news stories about him are presented at face value. The sense of an agenda starts taking over gradually and the balance is slowly lost, but the entertainment factor is still high, making for a mixed bag. It's like they tried to make a satire but frequently crossed the line into ranting. There's also an amusing irony: They cast a 'token black man' who voted for Trump to be the voice of the conservatives, although he is always drowned out by everyone else. Also, some of the agenda is subtle: There are frequent attacks on the alt-right (rightfully so), but never any mention of the extreme left, which is very revealing.\n\nThis becomes much worse in season three, though the entertainment factor, wit, and comedic situations still kept me watching, with gradually decreasing enjoyment. Several characters decide to fight the madness by beating them at their own games, breaking the law, using low tactics, lies, even violence. Once again, this feels like its meant to be a satire about some liberals going completely rabid under Trump, except that the show has several of its usually level-headed protagonists adopt this new attitude in multiple plot-lines, ranting and preaching about the necessity of it, justifying it repeatedly, and there's a new loud-mouthed crude lawyer whom some of the lawyers have to deal with, once again by adopting more extreme tactics. So the satire is lost and it feels more and more like a pushed agenda. If Antifa wrote a comedy, I imagine the result wouldn't be much different than this third season. So, despite the witty entertainment, this is where I got tired of watching.\n\nBased on the first season and most of the second.\n\nThis is an example of how character can elevate a pretty ordinary detective series and serial-killer thriller to something much greater (at least in the first season). As with Homicide, this show focuses on the people, their character, interaction, chemistry and dialogue, and the murder-mystery and detective-work become more of a backdrop. And it's a good thing too, because, if you think about it, the serial-killer case in the first season is pretty messy and too far-fetched involving a ridiculous cult conspiracy with slight suggestions of a potential supernatural element, and the detective work tends to wander amongst many tangents, leaving some plot-lines hanging. But since the focus is more on character-development and how they work together, you don't notice as much. It also helps that the two protagonists in the first season are top-tier character actors, with the always-reliable and colorful Woody Harrelson, and a solid McConaughey. They both get a juicy role of broken people, one more than the other, driven to find the killer, getting on each others nerves but also balancing out each other's flaws and skills to make a solid team. The case takes place over a few decades, tying together old unsolved cases with current murders, and expanding further even after they think they solved it. Their dialogue and chemistry ranges from grippingly tense and fascinating, to pretentiously empty attempts at meaningful statements, but even this is part of McConaughey's broken character who has dug a hole for himself. The detective work involves a lot of systematic work following obscure leads and instincts, slowly opening up the clues with sheer persistence, which is good, but it also leads to many dangling plot-lines and they break way too many laws to get critical information they need, slightly reducing plausibility. Overall, I found the first season a gripping watch, very strong in terms of character development, but overrated as a detective thriller. The second season, however, gets overwhelmed with the writer's pretensions and loses its vision, resulting in a very dead season that features unnatural characters that never come to life, convoluted multiple plot-lines that are almost impossible to follow, and uninteresting crimes and people.\n\nYoung Doctor's Notebook, A\n\nBased on both seasons.\n\nAlthough labelled a comedy, this is by Bulgakov. Which means pitch-black old-school-Russian satire and comedy coating a core of misery. This is a short, compact series based on short stories by Bulgakov about a young Moscow doctor banished to the middle of nowhere to practice medicine. The local peasants have no understanding of disease and how to handle their syphilis epidemic, tools are blunt which makes for disturbing amputations, there is nothing to do except listen to strangely obsessive 'anecdotes' from the dentist or have awkward sexual releases with the local nurse who is built like an ox, and the doctor develops a painful disease which leads him into a horrible morphine addiction. Where is the comedy, you ask? The doctor finds it in making fun of his own incompetence, and the story is told from the point of view of the doctor as an older man, who literally revisits his youth and interacts with him in near-surreal ways. Some gory scenes require a strong stomach and some may find the mix of extreme misery and comedy disorienting. Definitely a unique show that captures the Bulgakov spirit.\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\n\nJohn le Carré's book gets a quality BBC mini-series treatment with top-quality actors (including Alec Guinness and Ian Richardson). Spy-craft has never been this dense and intelligent. In fact, at times it is too intelligent, assuming too much of the audience. The complex plot and extremely subtle dialog is challenging enough, but the extensive unexplained spy-craft jargon, strange narrative structure of flashbacks that seems to go out of its way to put distance between pieces of the puzzle, and some unexplained developments, all make it impossible not to miss plot points and details. That said, what remains is still fascinating after it starts to tie itself together after a few episodes. The characters somehow manage to be both phlegmatic and full of personality, their dynamics are rich, the dialogue is fiercely intelligent, and the spy-craft is meticulous. The plot is about finding a mole in MI6 during the Cold War, a retired spy called in to lead the investigation, and the various clues and pieces of the puzzle from different periods. But it's really about the plot development, details and characters. A must-see-once for fans of John le Carré or audiences that like their spy-craft a mostly cerebral and talky affair, realistic and intelligent. But the slow pace and other flaws mentioned above are a hurdle for what is otherwise a standard spy story told in a dense and intelligent way.\n\nA ten-part mini-series by Kieslowski based on the Ten Commandments, each episode loosely related to one of the cardinal sins, telling a story with a twist on morality to provoke thought and explore humanity's dilemmas, ethical hardships and questions. If this sounds heavy, then you would be right. But it offers at least two rewards: One involves the little ethical twists presented in each thematic episode: God vs. all knowing computations and science, our relationship with parents and the line between parents and other important people in our life, murder vs. capital punishment, puppy love and romantic innocence vs. cynicism, carefree people vs. the woes of ownership, etc. The other is the series taken as a whole rather than the sum of its parts, which offers an interesting experience of humanity. A mysterious stranger with piercing eyes appears every time one of the characters is about to step over a line, and most of the events take place in the same apartment complex. But, although fascinating, this is not the masterpiece that lives up to its reputation: There are 3-4 superb episodes (especially the first one dealing with God which rivals Bergman at his best), two duds, and the rest are merely OK, sometimes going on too long for a story based on a single idea, and other times wandering into slow-moving melodrama and pointlessly depressed characters. Definitely worth watching at least once though and considered a major classic by art-house circles.\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nHBO transports the format and writing of an Israeli drama show on therapy to the USA, and produces something superb (despite the show having about 15 producers). A therapist and four of his patients fill five episodes a week, with the personal life and mind of the therapist both complementing the sessions with his patients, and filling up a fifth episode as he discusses his life and thoughts with his own therapist and friend. Borders between doctor and patient are constantly crossed as the discussions and intense emotions take personal turns, and even the doctor's firm rules and willpower can't always keep things under control. Most of the show takes place in the therapist's room, with events narrated by the patients, but if you think this would result in a boring show, you are making a big mistake. The writing and acting are simply perfect and deeply impressive. Minute actions and words are used to build depth of character and consistent, detailed personalities, without having the show or the therapist point everything out, allowing the audience to observe much for themselves, and leading me to wonder whether the sessions weren't taken from real-life. That said, some of the patients aren't always as fascinating as others, the therapist annoyingly and repeatedly is attracted to the neurotic selfish sluts (something that should be explored more with his therapist), and sometimes the self-absorbed neurotic monologues can get dreary, but three things keep the show interesting: The fact that you can skip specific patients if you really need to, the overall story arc of the therapist himself, allowing you to sometimes focus on how the patient is affecting the doctor instead of the other way around, and the way the writers ensure that every week there is some crisis, breakthrough or revelation (which is not realistic but it would be boring otherwise). The sleazy sexcapades narrated by the desperately slutty patient of the season don't hurt either I suppose.\n\nEach season takes time to sink its hooks, seeing as it takes 15 episodes to get three episodes going per patient, but the buildup is still interesting, there are always at least some interesting personalities, and the rewards of the investment are very good, not to mention that it becomes addictive fast. But this, and the fact that the stories are narrated, may explain why it isn't a big instant hit despite the superb writing and acting. I don't feel it's a re-watchable show, but it's a must-see while it's on (until you get your fill of other people's therapy). The first season is slightly more intense and interesting than the second but both are good. A fascinating and brave counterpoint to the plague of reality-shows.\n\nBased on the single season.\n\nCorrectly praised as the American 'Prisoner', this show features cleverly written plots about paranoia, powerful government agencies and an individual's struggle to maintain his identity and discover the truth, peeling away layer after layer of deception. The acting and direction is stunningly good, and some episodes are brilliant. But some severe flaws lower this show's ratings: Typically with such complex multi-layered shows and movies, writers don't bother to think things through and concentrate on introducing plot twists rather than on coherence. This show starts off extremely well and features some brilliant stand-alone episodes, but taken as a whole the motivations contradict each other, the deception seems to swerve in different directions with no consistency, and the resolution in the last episode fails logically, ascribing ridiculously complex machinations to simple goals that could have been dealt with using much simpler methods. Also, the show resorts to sci-fi in some episodes, undermining the intensity of the show with incredulous James Bond-like over-the-top thrillers, and a lot of the technology is unrealistic. This is still a grippingly fascinating show, but The Prisoner did this better.\n\nNight Manager, The\n\nIt's been a while since the BBC did a series based on John le Carré's work. This one is not a cold-war dense espionage story with moody spies however, but a straight-ahead thriller, albeit a solid one. Hiddleston is an ex-army man working as a hotel manager who becomes involved with an international arms-dealing ring of criminals and some British agents on their tail. Hugh Laurie acts against type as a bad guy, and although he is good, he doesn't raise quite enough authoritative malice for the role. Most of the series features dangerous, tense undercover work, and there is Bond-esque affairs and personal involvement with women in danger, as well as typical Le Carré inter-agency complications and politics. It is good, tense, and very watchable, but not overwhelmingly impressive or compelling. If this were a 90s or 2000s thriller movie, it would have been above-average but not a classic. It is also very reminiscent and familiar in its plotting, comparable to movies like 'License to Kill'. But the extra time it takes to build the plot and characters for six hours does allow for more audience involvement.\n\nCreated by the same writer/team behind Line of Duty, this has similar strengths and weaknesses, only condensed into a 6-part mini-series. It's about an ex-soldier turned to law-enforcement working in a 'Protection Branch' of the police service. After a harrowing encounter with a suicide bomber, he is assigned to protect a minister with very strong views on government interference in security. He is torn between his clashing political views and his duty as a bodyguard, and a personal involvement makes things even more complicated. For the first three episodes this is a top-notch thriller, a master-class that combines thrills, extremely well-directed tension, some action, as well as good drama and character development. I was ready to embrace this as some of the best thriller material in many years. But then come the fourth and fifth episodes which turn so incredibly convoluted with so many (implausible) plot elements, that it's impossibly to figure out what is happening. Thankfully, the sixth episode explains everything from the previous two episodes, if you think about it really hard and pay close attention. Unfortunately, the sixth episode also sinks the show with very rushed and implausible endings to the plot lines, as well as a plot twist that makes no sense whatsoever on many levels. This is one of those plots that sounds good theoretically and logically if a computer were to analyze the logic behind each plot element, but which is completely unrealistic and convoluted. Disappointing.\n\nBased on both seasons.\n\nDemented, eccentric and brutal conspiracy thriller from Britain that is unlike anything else. Don't be fooled by the genre and title though; this is not science-fiction, and does not involve any kind of utopia, except one as envisioned by sociopaths. This is also one of the most unpredictable shows I've ever seen, and it continues its ongoing stream of psychotic logic throughout both seasons, and it is this unpredictable madness, if nothing else, that will keep you watching. The conspiracy involves flu pandemics, both fake and real, and very extreme plots to control the world's overpopulation problem with genetics. There's a brilliant scientist, a group of powerful people above any international law that go around murdering and torturing anyone with a blink of an eye, including children if it will serve their purpose, and a group of eccentric youngsters that formed a club around a graphic novel that they believe reflects reality. Murder and mayhem and torture fly unchecked and rampant in this show, because so many of the people involved (possibly including the writers) are psychotic. In fact, it feels that this show would have you believe that being a sociopathic murderer is contagious, as long as you become involved in a problem as big as the overpopulation of the planet. Anything can happen in this show, and anyone can get killed, or come back to life after being presumed dead, and everyone else is running, or being blackmailed, or chasing, or trying to hide from people that will stop at nothing and who seem to be monitoring everything, anywhere. All that said, I can't say that it was particularly realistic in the slightest. As mentioned, there are too many psychotics, and people's reactions are a bit too fearful and passive taking into account that it all seems to boil down to a handful of people in power, and some of the weird murderers are only partially intimidating because they are sociopaths, but the murders are almost always so unexpected, and the tone is very twisted, clever and eccentric, so it kinda works in a crazy way, especially thanks to its relentless pace of continuous twists and unexpected violence and alliances. So, despite the lack of realism in the characters and plotting, it is definitely material for a cult show and very entertaining in a demented way.\n\nBased on all five seasons.\n\nDavid Crane delivers another funny show full of sexual misadventures bringing to mind his still superior 'Dream On', except that this is a satire on the TV show business, and, as with his experiment in 'The Class', this features a continuous story-line. This British-US co-production is a very addictive balance of satire, wit, relationship drama, and trashy sex and flings. The satire pokes fun at the TV industry, including how remakes of British shows get derailed by manipulative executives and narcissistic TV stars, as well as by affairs. The funny awkwardness of the first season effectively demonstrates what shows like The Office were lacking: Punchlines. Whereas those shows thought the embarrassments in themselves were funny, this one writes actual jokes around similar situations. The wit is the usual Crane-level of hilarity. There is a surprisingly realistic relationship between the married British writers that have been imported to the US, and it portrays all the effects of a soul-sucking and sexually-casual environment, making one think that this is based on real-life experience. Tasmin Grieg (Black Books) is the best thing about the show, but their chemistry together and sarcastic lines work very well as well. Matt LeBlanc does a surprisingly great turn in a role that is basically a destructive and narcissistic version of himself, finally shucking 'Joey' off for a much wittier and juicier role. And the sex is rampant, including affairs between selfish bosses and their damaged assistants, as well as immoral actors and fans ruining marriages. What does all this add up to? As mentioned, it is very addictive and fun and definitely worth watching, but it doesn't exactly achieve greatness, although it's right on the border. Perhaps it's the incongruous blend of relationship realism with over-the-top cheapening sex and big-penis gags that take it down a few notches, as well as the many cartoonish support characters that chew the scenery. Still lots of fun though.\n\nBased on all three seasons.\n\nVery reminiscent of Coupling, but nowhere near the same level of brilliance. It does involve four or five close single friends, as well as that anything-goes approach to humor on sexual misadventures and relationships going horribly bad. But it does also feature a lot of heartfelt real drama. At first the balance between the wild raunchy humor and the touching drama is somewhat even, but the drama does increasingly take over gradually during the course of three short seasons. At the center is that old chestnut of two people in love who can never get together due to a series of obstacles, some of them self-made. They stretch this will-they-or-won't-they relationship and love triangle drama a bit too much, but it does keep you watching til the end. The male characters involve an often used trio (Friends?) of awkward geekier guy, superficial playboy, and sensitive guy. The title (not the original title for the show) has a double meaning referring also to the search for love, and also to the fact that one of them discovers he has an STD and has to reach out to all the women he knew in the past (for some unknown reason he has to go back years), reawakening many old feelings, awkward funny situations, and complications. It also makes the show rely primarily on flashbacks, and this gets a bit tedious as well as makes the timeline a bit difficult to track. Altogether, however, this is a pretty watchable and enjoyable show, with a nice balance of good drama and fun humor.\n\nBased on all four seasons.\n\nNicely balanced comedy that is not as sociopathic and mean-spirited as Fleabag, nor is it a cutesy romantic-comedy sitcom, but somewhere in between, featuring a horny couple with some personality issues which keep society at arm's length, but who found each other and have a genuinely caring attraction for each other, keeping them together despite everything. A case of instant animal-attraction between a visiting American and an Irish woman creates a catastrophic pregnancy, and they decide to try to make it work. Their friends stir the pot with even bigger character flaws and horny raunchy escapades. And the man's immoral job in a pharmaceutical company add to the roller coaster. The comedy loves to cross the border back and forth repeatedly between raunchiness mixed with anti-social behaviour, and back to sane human intimacy, but always keeping it real and funny. The writers aren't just out to shock and titillate, but to explore a rocky relationship, horny warts and all, including mean but short-lived fights. Although, beware, the woman is a dozen times more selfish than the man and this can sometimes be off-putting, and the comedy does love to pile on the raunch. The first two seasons are very funny and perfect for binge-watching. As with many shows of this kind (especially 'Episodes') that feature a realistic relationship at the center, the writers and audience become increasingly invested in the characters and therefore the relationship gets increasingly more focus over the comedy, but it's still good and very watchable. The fourth season sometimes gets a little lost with sitcom plots having the character do silly things to create drama, as well as awkward short injections of politics, but it's not bad either. Fun for the inner jerks in all of us, and nicely balanced, but not for trigger-happy delicate people.\n\nDead to Me\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nI didn't expect to like this much but it was a nice little surprise and very watchable. It's a dark comedy and dramedy about dark secrets involving death and an unusual friendship between two women, and it is quite well written in the first season. Applegate is very good as a widow with an anger problem and a lack of closure with her dead husband, and Cardellini is sexy but an emotional cause for chaos. Each episode provides new well-written reveals or small twists in either the mystery, friendship or extended family, and it would be impossible to describe the story without spoilers. As opposed to many other shows that attempt this kind of thing though, the writers do a great job keeping it realistic and both darkly amusing as well as very addictively watchable. The first season is not a great classic, but it is solid entertainment and well acted and written. The second season, however, feels like they didn't have a clear handle on it this time, with ridiculous implausible twists right at the beginning, as well as an ongoing new secret involving a double-standard where women can get away with murder literally just because they are emotional, and white men are always bad even when they commit much smaller crimes.\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nAn episodic murder-mystery show that is overflowing with character and fun writing, and is possibly the best of its kind. The setup is great: A female detective who messed up on the job is assigned a new job in the basement handling ex-detectives that try to close very old and unsolved cold-cases as a kind of PR stunt that is not expected to yield actual results. She puts together a team of grizzly, flawed, quirky but talented retired detectives, and, to everyone's surprise they start solving cases, thanks to modern forensics and DNA tests combined with their talent, experience and knowledge. For the team, the show casts veteran British character-actors and each of them instantly bring their characters to life and take them in all sorts of directions. Their camaraderie, playful teasing and interaction with the stricter and younger boss, as well as the generation gap, all add great light comedy and character to the show, and the good writing gives them a lot to play with. In addition, this provides the show with a plentiful source for satire and interesting dynamics by comparing the generations via the age-gap, as well as via the crimes that were committed in another time and age, their different approaches to police procedures, attitudes towards women and authority, and reliance on old-school police work and personal skills rather than on technology. Thus, this show also comes off a much better version of Life on Mars without resorting to sci-fi or action-cliches. The mysteries are also quite solid. In short, for what it is, it's a very good show and worth catching whenever it's on (but its episodic format and lack of arcs make it inherently limited).\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nYup, it's another British murder-mystery series, except, rather than wallowing in drama or lurid murders, this one is loads of fun. Jonathan is a brainy, quiet young man who loves brain-teasers and who applies his devious, clever mind to devise magic tricks for a celebrity magician who handles all of that showmanship and publicity nonsense. An investigative journalist, AKA a garrulous, practical-minded and very nosy woman who uses mysterious murders to further her writing career, uses him and his skills to solve baffling mysteries. There are several variations on the locked-room mystery, as well as other seemingly impossible feats of crime with even more baffling odd clues. Their clash of personalities and their sexual attraction provide for comedy and a lot of teasing with a delicious wit by the writers, and the mysteries really get one's brain going trying to solve them before they do, always with just enough clues to let one come up with radical possibilities. Unfortunately, the solutions often involve some convoluted plan or bizarre coincidence, which, although logically feasible, never seem plausible, especially when many of the crimes could have been committed with much simpler devices. In other words, this show treats murders like elaborate magic tricks which are fun to try to figure out, but which are not quite realistic. Still, the characters and puzzles are good fun. And, for Doctor Who fans, three Doctors and couple of companions make appearances here.\n\nBased on the first three seasons and a bit of the fourth.\n\nIt's amazing how often multiple movies come out at the same time featuring a similar setting or premise. This Australian women-in-prison show came out at the same time as 'Orange Is The New Black', except it is miles better and harder than that marshmallow show about soft prisoners in a country-club prison, and definitely better and more realistic than the over-the-top trash of 'Oz'. This one is full of strong personalities, and the majority of the prisoners are screw-ups and/or hardened criminals, not fluffy healthy people in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is a good thing. At the center, however, is Bea, who brings to mind Breaking Bad. She makes a desperate decision, then spends a few seasons gradually becoming more hardened and dangerous than everyone else combined. There is constant prison intimidation and violence and back-stabbing schemes and plots, but the show's strength is in how it finds a human angle for even the most vicious crazies, and brings every character to life in three dimensions. There is plenty of drama, as well as drama and political games between the guards, officials and other workers in the prison. In addition to the usual prison violence and plotting, there is a female angle that is used well, their broken characters merged with, for example, motherhood drama, within this unusual setting, the writers keeping them all very human rather than just chess pieces in a game of violence. It all comes together in a nice balance of tense thrills, scheming and drama with strong characters. If you like prison thriller-dramas, then consider this a must-watch. I am not the biggest fan of constant animalistic scheming and battles for supremacy, with even the guards and governors taking part in the cruelty, but the characters, danger, well-written thrills and drama do keep one watching, especially in the strongly balanced first season. When one of the officials turns out to be a bigger psychopath than the prisoners, however, it started wearing thin for me, and in season four it all became too unrealistic. If you're into this sort of thing though, by all means check it out, as it is well done.\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nIt's another British murder-mystery series. This one is slightly reminiscent of 'Happy Valley' with its season-long developing and ever-expanding mysteries and stories, and the heavy focus on people and drama over thrills or gruesome murders. Also the theme is slightly different from other shows of this kind, a theme that gives it its heavy emotional weight: The cases are very old ones, decades old, starting with an unexpected human skeleton, with the investigations uncovering past sins and crimes, and very deeply buried emotions and guilt, often amongst old people that have changed since then as human beings. Old secrets are uncovered not in the cheap thriller way with easy heroes and villains, but with subtle writing and deep character work, portraying the criminals as deeply affected human beings that have grown old with their burdens. Not that this show neglects the police-work; far from it. The investigations are meticulous, detailed, involving and even exciting at times. But the fly in the ointment is the liberal slant. It's pre-Woke and not obnoxious as in later shows, but still peppered throughout with a slanted viewpoint of the world that feels like a constant poke in the ribs by someone with an agenda. The acting, mysteries, classy drama, and character-work are all nicely done however, with powerfully emotional denouements.\n\nBased on the first two seasons and a bit of the third.\n\nSharks, power games, greed, revenge, power, manipulations, agendas, aggression, one-upmanship, playing dirty, politics and money, lots of it, along with more financial jargon than you can shake a hedge fund at. That pretty much sums up this show. It's a battle of wits and power between the US attorney's office, especially one Chuck Rhoades, and a tycoon hedge fund king Bobby Axelrod, made complicated and personal by the fact that Chuck's wife is Bobby's best friend and employee. There is not a loophole, dirty trick, manipulation, financial machine-gun or legal hammer that they won't use against each other. It's basically a feud or vendetta made with money and power. This would make for an entertaining, intense show, except for the fact that everyone around them is also a shark at different degrees, each with their agendas and power games and greed. All interactions between characters are utilitarian, calculating and aggressive as if they were all playing from the same Machiavellian playbook. The women behave like men, and even spousal relationships almost always feel utilitarian and manipulative, and I am not even referring to the S&M sex scenes. Which makes this show entertaining, but quite one-dimensional. Even Dexter had more humanity than this. The financial thrills and games are sometimes too advanced for the non-savvy, but mostly they do a pretty good job in making thrills and plots out of financial cut-throat business. The power games are sometimes all too convenient when they find leverage against their opponents whenever needed, but most of the time it's actually quite clever. And this is what kept me watching despite the aforementioned big flaw. But it really needed more humanity and more realistic characters with more than just one drive and character trait at varying degrees. (Interestingly, this has a writer by the name of Sorkin, and brings to mind other shows with characters that all seem to come from the same stable...). Season two shows both an improvement and a decline: The writers improve somewhat, and on some episodes the characters show a bit more humanity (only to go right back to being calculating sharks in the next episode). And then they introduce a new character who seems to be interested in more human things, but then she turns out to be the biggest shark of them all, an annoyingly entitled & robotic one, possibly combined with Aspergers. It also doesn't help that she is a casting stunt from PC hell, a 'non-binary' character, and even her enemies, for some absurd unknown reason, respect her demands to use 'them' and 'their' pronouns even behind her back. Despite her young age, she somehow knows more about everything than everyone else despite not having any life experience, a typically ridiculous fantasy PC move. And worst of all, due to the incorrect use of pronouns, the dialogue sometimes becomes very difficult to understand since you can never figure out who they are actually talking about. And that's when I lost patience with the show, notwithstanding its entertainment value.\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nBased on Tom Clancy's super-spy who has both a fighting marine background and a sharp eye for research, intelligence and connecting the dots. This show attempts to emulate Clancy's realistic and detailed story-telling but is much more action-thriller than the usual Clancy material. Each season tells a different crisis where Ryan connects the dots and promptly finds himself in the thick of things with lots of action and fast-paced espionage. The first season features a smart terrorist with ambitious plans that surpass Bin Laden, the second covers current controversial issues in Venezuela with deeply corrupt politics and mass state-run violence. Many reviews of the second season are politically motivated. Both seasons are watchable and entertaining but the characters are mostly bland and not so interesting, and the writing is full of implausibilities, mostly in the last few episodes of the season, bringing to mind '24', although not quite as preposterous as that show. Terrorists use convoluted plans and unnecessary super-weapons when simpler ones could have worked, and some plot threads are left dangling. And in the second season, agents go rogue and behave like an unstoppable Rambo with the actual CIA nowhere to be seen. Some episodes are quite good, including, ironically, the ones covering side-plots that barely have anything to do with the primary plot; other episodes are comparable to a very average, flawed, popcorn thriller movie.\n\nBased on the first two seasons.\n\nThis British answer to Boardwalk Empire is the better of the two, without the flaws of that show. It also takes place in the 1920s, only in Birmingham, and it traces the rise of a criminal gang of ex-soldiers and an extended family led by a young ambitious man who is strong on strategy. It even has them shipping alcohol to Canada for the prohibition mobs in the US. This show, like Boardwalk, features rich visual settings and historical detail, except here, the protagonists are quite interesting and well cast, the writing is good, and the pace is superb. Each season explores a couple of ambitious plots to expand, while matters escalate with rival gangs, or with the law, as Tom tries to think his way out of his unravelling plans, while expanding his power. A brutal inspector (the always reliable Sam Neill) is called in by Churchill to take care of the escalating problem that has now become political, and it soon becomes personal, with escalating power games between them, and revenge. During the first gripping season, the writing is superb, and the escalation between the idealistic but brutal cop and Tom is excellent and compelling, up until the ending which sees a couple of questionable personality twists. The second season is still entertaining and well made, but is less interesting for me personally since it becomes just another war between criminal gangs and various insane personalities, and the law this time is just another unrealistically insane criminal as well, as if the writers wanted us to take sides with the murdering Tom by pitting him against a corrupt cop. I never really found gang wars that interesting. It also features Tom Hardy chewing the scenery in a highly colorful but unrealistic role of an insane Jew. For fans of mob series, however, this comes strongly recommended.\n\nBased on all three seasons.\n\nShowtime's answer to Sopranos featuring an extended Irish family running a neighbourhood in Rhode Island. One brother is a complex politician with principles, but is not above bending rules to achieve more power to do more good. The other brother (an intense Jason Isaacs as always) is practically a psychopath criminal with a good brain, and a soft spot for his family and lover, but with a temper and sadistic streak. There's a pushy, manipulative but very much in denial mother, an incompetent brother, a cousin fresh off the boat from Ireland trying to be accepted by the family, a bulldog of a man running the local mob, and many more. Except for Isaacs, the show is not as colorful as Sopranos but it holds its own. Where this improves over Sopranos, however, is in its shades of grey and the handful of characters that do have principles but who feel under pressure to compromise them every week. This, as well as the complex dual-brother relationship, makes the show more consistently watchable than Sopranos. That said, there is plenty of brutal violence and rampant criminality as well as graphic sexual-content straight out of an HBO show. Flaws in the writing are subtle, but involve frequent sloppiness in its treatment of consequences and consistent characterization. People tend to forget significant events at the writers' whims until the season endings, criminals get away with very sloppy jobs that the law could easily pin on them, and characters keep inexplicably switching a bit too often between conflicting forms of behaviour. These are subtle however, and do not detract too much from this otherwise quite good show.\n\nA very popular British police procedural series consisting of 6 mini-series and 3 TV movies over 15 years, all revolving around the same female detective, featuring Helen Mirren in a career-defining performance. This show paved the way for female detectives in entertainment. It starts off with a classic mini-series that combines an investigation of a serial killer that gradually develops its tension and frustration while, at the same time, she has to contend with an all-male team of underling cops that doesn't want a woman replacing and undermining their team-mate and friend. Although I am allergic to feminist agendas that usually portray men with broad chauvinistic strokes, this first entry does a good and realistic job with the material. In addition, the story uniquely focuses on collecting evidence rather than on a myste"
