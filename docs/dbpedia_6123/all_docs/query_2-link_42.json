        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nAll four series of Blackadder, starring Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson, are coming to Blu-ray for the very first time. It’s traditional that towards the end of the year, boxsets of comedy programmes are paraded before our eyes, to tempt us into buying very thoughtful festive gifts. However, there’s a surprise treat in this particular year’s repackaging of older shows: the peerless Blackadder is coming to Blu-ray for the first time. What’s more, in its entirety too. The new set is bringing together every episode of The Blackadder, Blackadder II, Blackadder The Third and Blackadder Goes Forth. On top of those, there’s also Blackadder’s Christmas Carol, The Cavalier Years, and the documentary Blackadder Rides Again. It’s unclear if the unaired pilot episode will be part of the collection. The whole Blackadder set is arriving on December 4th, and is available to order here. Seven discs are included in the package. According to the blurb, “These episodes have been restored and remastered using the existing film where available, with any standard definition content upscaled during the process”.\n\nRead more: UK DVD and Blu-ray release dates confirmed – up to early 2024\n\nThe extra features, likewise, are a mix of standard and high definition, we’re told. What we’re not being told is just what the extra features are at this stage, although given that this set is in part for the show’s 40th anniversary – crikey, that makes this particular writer feel old – expect a mix of celebratory and archive material. Still, according to this thing we’re reading here, the total running time for the whole set comes in at 1253 minutes. You’re getting a fair amount of Blackadder for your money, with the asking price for the set currently listed as £49.99. Not too much to say about it at the moment while we await further details landing. But it sounds as though, from what we can gleam, a fresh remastering has taken place (not for the first time where this show is concerned), and the Blu-ray release is very welcome. — Thank you for visiting!
