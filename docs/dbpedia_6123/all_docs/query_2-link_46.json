Featuring every episode that Baldrick could find (apart from the pilot, which he traded for a Turnip), all four series and specials have been cured by leeches and are presented in high definition for first time. Furthermore, throughout the age’s men of flair, facility and outstanding courage have emerged from the dust of dodgy documents and film from the cutting room floor to create the most cunning of special features.\n\nWhilst Baldrick, of course, the man you can rely on has managed to gather rooms full of deeply horrid people to create a huge pie of new and exclusive entertainment.\n\nThe Blackadder\n\nBlackadder II\n\nBlackadder The Third\n\nBlackadder Goes Forth\n\nBlackadder The Specials:\n\nBlackadder's Christmas Carol\n\nThe Cavalier Years\n\nBlackadder Rides Again\n\nAn hour documentary produced to mark the 25th anniversary with filming locations in Northumberland, Cheltenham and California. Narrated by John Sergeant.\n\nExtras:\n\n† Brand New Audio Commentaries:\n\n• The Archbishop ~ Brian Blessed • The Foretelling ~ John Lloyd • Beer ~ Miranda Richardson • Dish and Dishonesty ~ Mandie Fletcher • Captain Cook ~ Richard Boden• Corporal Punishment ~ Chris Wadsworth\n\n† Studio recordings of: Potato • Duel & Duality • Corporal Punishment • Cavalier Years • Goodbyeee\n\nThese episodes have been restored and remastered using the existing film where available, with any standard definition content upscaled during the process.\n\nThe special features in this release are a mixture of standard and high definition. Due to the age of the original materials, the technical quality of the extras may vary in places.\n\nLast edited: Nov 8, 2023\n\n— As an Amazon Associate, AVForums earns from qualifying purchases —\n\nVid\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nMay 6, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n6,740\n\nReaction score\n\n4,358\n\nPoints\n\n1,702\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#2\n\nAlways time for a bit of Blackadder.\n\nSyStemDeMoN\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 27, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n5,689\n\nReaction score\n\n1,987\n\nPoints\n\n1,195\n\nAge\n\n47\n\nLocation\n\nTelford\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#3\n\nAnd then they attach a stupid price to it !\n\nIm sure it will drop in price quite quickly.\n\nI forgot about 'The cavalier years'.\n\nZaichik\n\nProminent Member\n\nJoined\n\nMar 5, 2002\n\nMessages\n\n2,338\n\nReaction score\n\n1,538\n\nPoints\n\n687\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#4\n\nIs Back and Forth not in it?\n\nJim Di Griz\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 24, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n27,947\n\nReaction score\n\n23,698\n\nPoints\n\n7,742\n\nLocation\n\nDarkplace Hospital\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#5\n\nAbsolute must buy.

A cunning project for @bbcstudios. Here's a thread with some of the highlights\"\n\n1. First the first-time ever on a home release... the full unedited version of Blackadder's Christmas Carol\n\n2. 6 new audio commentaries including... Director Richard Boden, Director Mandie Fletcher, Producer John Lloyd, Editor Chris Wadsworth, Brian Blessed and Miranda Richardson\n\n3. Over an hour of previously unseen film rushes from the 1st series - raw and in HD for the first time\n\n4. Behind the scenes cine footage from the 1st series\n\n5. Raw film rushes from the 2nd series\n\n6. The raw materials from the original closing sequence to the 4th series, with context provided from editor Chris Wadsworth\n\n7. 6 hours of previously unreleased raw studio recordings from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th series plus Comic Relief special..\n\n8. An extensive photo gallery featuring the original musical score from across all series\n\n9. An extensive montage of rare BBC TV promotional materials thanks to @pipmadeley for his help with that!\n\n10. And in HD for the very first time, the millennium special 'Back And Forth'. It took a long time to locate the original 35mm negatives, but after many, many searches I was delighted to finally locate them and it looks utterly stunning!\n\n11. PLUS the option to watch B&F 'with' or 'without' a laughter track! So you can choose.\n\n12. Finally...
