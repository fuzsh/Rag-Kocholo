        "text": "Credits\n\nThe end.\n\nIt’s June 7th, 2008. Rihanna is at number one with “Take a Bow,” having taken the slot the previous week. The Ting Tings, Coldplay, Usher, Madonna, and Justin Timberlake also chart. In news, Manchester United triumph in the first ever all-English European Cup final, defeating Chelsea on penalties. Construction begins in London on the Olympic Stadium, and Barack Obama finally puts the long fight for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination to rest when he defeats Hillary Clinton to, by that point, absolutely nobody’s surprise.\n\nOn television, meanwhile, the Doctor is in a library, shouting at shadows. Seething, he tells them to look him up. They do so, and begin to read.\n\nLike anything, it emerged from a number of influences, and its history can in one sense be traced back indefinitely. It does not have a clear and definitive moment of creation – a pristine and bespoke origin story. It is, however, generally agreed to have a creator: Sydney Newman. Newman was a Canadian television producer who caught the eye of Associated British Corporation, a weekend ITV franchise in the North and Midlands of England. Moving there in 1958, he quickly made a reputation for himself, birthing the reasonably successful sci-fi anthology Out of this World, a fairly straightforward knockoff of the American Twilight Zone, and The Avengers, at first a fairly generic crime show, but eventually an international hit. At the beginning of 1963, he was poached by the BBC to become Head of Drama.\n\nShortly before Newman’s arrival, the BBC commissioned a study to see how science fiction might could work on television. Mainstream critics like Kingsley Amis were drawing attention to the genre, the earliest days of the New Wave, spearheaded by writers like J.G. Ballard and Michael Moorcock, were playing out, and the BBC, committed to making various types of programming in the interest of the public, wanted to try it. The general conclusion was that sci-fi is a literary, adult genre that can’t really be done well for families because of the need for special effects. Time travel was suggested as a potentially strong subject for allowing a variety of low-cost dramas, and the report arrives six months before Newman. Three months after Newman started on the job, a Saturday evening timeslot between a sports program, Grandstand, and a pop music program, Juke Box Jury opened up. The slot called for an all-ages program, appealing to teenagers waiting for Juke Box Jury, adults holding over from Grandstand, and the existing children’s audience for that timeslot. Newman decided the sci-fi program would be perfect, and set to work designing it with C.E. Weber, a staff writer, and Donald Wilson, head of the Script department.\n\nCuriously, the program’s development began with the sorts of characters who should be in it. The idea was a 30-something male protagonist and a younger female one, an older mentor figure, and an aesthetic that combined Victoriana with high-tech shininess. This latter conceit speaks volumes about the program’s intended morality. The time travel concept is clearly used to create a wide variety of adventures, in which the main characters will resolve moral problems. But the source of their wisdom and power is to be an old man who combines the futuristic sci-fi aesthetic with a historically minded British one. The idea, then, is that old-fashioned British values dating back to the height of the British Empire would save the day in the future as well. This approach was, in several subtle but important ways, a satisfying theme for science fiction. The British Empire had always been based in part on technological skill – their naval supremacy was born in part of the fact that British scientists Edmond Halley and John Harrison solved the problem of how to measure longitudinal distance around the Earth, thus swiftly making the British the best navigators on the planet. This extended into the Victorian era, where the industrial revolution came about in part due to the technological advances of people like George Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Even in World War II, it was British computer scientists such as Alan Turing who broke the German codes and enabled an Allied victory. So the idea that a British inventor of the future would have the crucial wisdom and knowledge to right wrongs in a technologically advanced world would have seemed a reasonable hope for a country that, in its own mythology at least, was still just twenty years out from having saved the world from the Nazis.\n\nNewman, however, had some refinements. He wanted a young girl to be cool and to motivate the plot by screwing up, and he wanted the older man to be a difficult, almost antagonistic man. Once again, this conceit has terrific significance. It is worth remembering that Newman is not British. He is Canadian – a product of British culture, but an offspring that had long since set off in its own direction, away from the British imperial values that the proto-steampunk aesthetic points towards. By turning this into a source of borderline menace such that the character is not entirely trustworthy and morally ambiguous, Newman moved the underlying premise slightly, opening the Victorian imperialistic values implicit in the premise to some sort of critique or modification. In essence, it positions the 30-something protagonists as a better, younger generation, improving upon the failures of the older one.\n\nThe idea was refined further. The male and female lead became schoolteachers, the old man a fugitive from the far-future. There’s now a broken time machine, stuck in the shape of a London Police Box, and in need of repairs. And with some scripts in development, it was time to hire a production team. After a few false starts, Newman poached Verity Lambert from his old employer and appointed her producer. Lambert is as hard-nosed a professional as they come – she successfully and calmly took over directing cameras on a live drama broadcast when one of the actors literally died in the middle of the performance, leaving the more senior producers to frantically rewrite the script on the fly. Meanwhile, David Whitaker, a promising young writer, was put in charge of editing scripts. They continued to refine their ideas, and settled on a choice of first stories: combining a three-episode adventure by Anthony Coburn about cavemen with a first episode based in a large part on C.E. Weber’s development of the series concept.\n\nAn initial pilot episode was filmed but deemed unsuitable due to some technical faults pulling off the show’s signature special effect as Barbara, the female lead, now played by Jacqueline Hill pushes through the Police Box doors to discover that, impossibly, a gleaming white control room far larger than the exterior of the box lies within. Seizing the opportunity, the script is tinkered a little bit as well, removing the explanation of the origins of old man, now played by William Hartnell, an actor best known for his hard-nosed military roles, and the young girl, Susan, now the old man’s granddaughter and played by Carole Ann Ford. The cast is rounded out by William Russell as the male lead, Ian. Ian and Barbara have become schoolteachers who follow a mysterious student of theirs back to her home. The student, Susan, turns out to live with her alien grandfather in a time machine disguised as a London Police Box, and, due to poor communication between her Grandfather and the schoolteachers, all four find themselves in an uncontrollable time machine, unable to return to their homes. Out of this cast, however, the show draws its title from Susan’s mysterious old grandfather, a Doctor, who declines to ever give his real name, thus adding to his mysterious and gruff mystique. On November 23rd, 1963, one day after the assassination of American President John F. Kennedy, the first episode goes out. The episode is titled “An Unearthly Child,” and the title of the series is Doctor Who.\n\nThe ratings were middling at best. This is unsurprising – the mood was still raw after the nearly twenty-four hours of solid news coverage. Doctor Who was the first thing that went out as the BBC returned to normal programming, and drew a paltry 4.4 million. In a small mercy, the BBC opted to re-run the first episode before the second episode, and the remainder of the first story pulled figures in the six to seven million range, peaking at 6.9 million for its third episode, which followed immediately on an appearance by the Beatles on Juke Box Jury.\n\nThe first story is an uncertain affair, however. Its plot is mainly focused on coming up with a reason for these two disparate groups of people to travel together. Ian and Barbara are schoolteachers, concerned with their student, Susan, who displays uncanny brilliance in some areas but bizarre gaps in her knowledge in others. Deciding to follow her home, they discover that she lives in a junkyard. When they hear her speaking from what appears to be a Police Box, they push past the old man trying to dissuade them from exploring and discover the truth: Susan and the old man are time travellers. Outraged, the old man, the Doctor, sets the ship up to dematerialize, sweeping the teachers away to an unknown destination. That destination turns out to be prehistoric Earth, where the characters settle a leadership dispute within the Tribe of Gum, a dispute that mirrors the tensions between Ian and the Doctor. The Doctor is a clearly untrustworthy figure, having kidnapped Ian and Barbara, and at one point considers smashing in the head of an otherwise innocent caveman who threatens to slow their escape. Still, they escape with their lives and set off to travel again. The story is competent – the first episode is better than the remaining three, but it does what the program is supposed to do, combining interesting and mature ideas with reasonably exciting adventure for the kids.\n\nThe second story is set to be a more straightforward science fiction story by a Welsh writer named Terry Nation. Terry Nation’s later work paints a picture of his approach to science fiction: as early as his other contribution to Doctor Who’s first season, The Keys of Marinus, he’s writing formulaic, intensely serializable pulp adventures. The bulk of his stories in the Hartnell era are actually a chain of one-episode adventures, copying the plot structure of Eagle’s old flagship space hero, Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future. Even in this story his tendency to rely on the serialized structure of Doctor Who and to craft adventures made of smaller mini-adventures is apparent. The titles of his episodes give it away: all seven are simply declared objects: “The Dead Planet,” “The Survivors,” “The Expedition,” “The Ordeal.”\n\nNation is under a further constraint for this one, however, a fact that would make him an integral part of the entire show’s history for what are, ultimately, strangely specious reasons. Shortly after signing the contract to pen a serial for Doctor Who, Nation got a better job offer doing a comedy special for Eric Sykes, contemporary of Spike Milligan on The Goon Show, and so did the entire Doctor Who story in a week, writing an episode a day. This meant that it was a reasonably easy script to shepherd into production early on, and thus it was ready for the slot of second story, whereas Anthony Coburn’s The Masters of Luxor, originally intended as the second story, was proving unsatisfactory to David Whitaker, both because of its implausible budget demands and because its resolution hinged in part on the Doctor’s Christian faith.\n\nThere was, however, a problem with Nation’s script, then titled The Mutants, which was Nation’s space adventure structure. It was not that Nation asked for anything unaffordable, although perhaps his giant mire beast was a little over-ambitious for a BBC design budget, but rather that his story was based around what Sydney Newman called BEMs – bug-eyed monsters. Newman was adamant that Doctor Who not go that route, instead maintaining a balance between historical stories like the initial caveman adventure and literary science fiction plays. The Daleks, Nation’s mutant villains, were blatant examples – inhuman creatures who looked for all the world like robots\n\nAnd so Lambert, as Newman tells it, constructed an elaborate explanation about how they’re not monsters, but people twisted by radiation so that they need survival suits. But this focus would surely require some alteration to the script. Nation’s pulp adventure script was, after all, exactly the thing Newman’s BEM policy was meant to avoid, and much as Lambert might have been thinking on her feet to talk her way out of a production note she didn’t like, she was smart enough to see it coming. More to the point, the hand of David Whitaker is all over this script. David Whitaker is one of Doctor Who’s earliest visionaries, and his literary career is largely defined by that association. In addition to script editing the first season and the start of the second, Whitaker wrote forty episodes of the show, adapted Terry Nation’s first two Dalek stories to films starring Peter Cushing, ghost wrote large swaths of the early Doctor Who Annuals published by World Distributors, and penned two of the first three novelizations of Doctor Who stories before largely exiting writing in favor of teaching in Australia.\n\nWhitaker’s work displays a theatricality and stageplay quality. He favors political intrigue and overt philosophical discussions. His writing has a meticulousness of structure that few of his contemporaries on early Doctor Who shared – even when his plotting was sloppy, which it often could be, he was adept at managing the motion of a given scene and at adding nuances of character. He was perfectly pitched to massage Nation’s script a little – the continuing narrative of the tense relations between the Doctor and Ian and Barbara is surely Whitaker’s work, as is the sequence where Ian manipulates the Thals into abandoning pacifism, an approach he takes for complex moral reasons involving not wanting to make other people die for him, and so wanting to give the Thals something of their own to fight for.\n\nThese themes of pacifism and the moral imperative to fight evil would be present in Nation’s original script – they’re exactly the sort of stuff that Eagle played with. But Whitaker seems to have played up the obvious Nazi associations of Nation’s monsters, but frame it in a lurid, dead planet. Under Whitaker’s knife the Daleks move from being evil aliens in a bunker to strange creatures of unlife. Their need for radiation has made them into creatures of death, determined to destroy the world further so that they can continue to live. They are the horrifying remains of people after nuclear annihilation, no longer people but inconceivably monstrous things. The story stops being about how there are some people like the Nazis who are just irredeemably bad and must be fought, and starts being about the sheer degree to which the Daleks are twisted and grotesque. Nation’s script had little of this – the Daleks were generic space monsters in a post-apocalyptic world, but Nation was infamous for hazily-defined writing. Designers on this story recall endless successions of featureless white corridors where Nation couldn’t think of any good images, and were basically given the world of Skaro and the creatures as a blank canvas on which to play.\n\nTwo creative visions stand out. The first was designer Raymond Cusick, who designed the physical appearance of the Daleks. The focus of the design was on making them look like objects instead of people, while still retaining some level of ability for their operators to act so that they could fulfill the relatively complicated plot roles the script demanded of them. Cusick designed around the mechanism of operation – a fairly blocky shape so that it wasn’t too brutal for the actor inside, capable of being wheeled and spun around from within. Lights flashed on the top to indicate which Dalek was speaking, and Cusick put the iris from a cannibalized camera in the eyestalk so that its eye could open and close. Early tests focused on the actors’ ability to move freely, and actors inventive ways of suggesting the mounting fury implied by the creature’s piercing robotic voice.\n\nThat voice was designed primarily by Brian Hodgson at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Hodsgson was responsible for much of the sound design on early Doctor Who, which mixed together strange noises created by speeding and slowing audiotape, electronically treating sound, and splicing up tape. These techniques were used by Hodgson’s colleague Delia Derbyshire to arrange Ron Grainer’s theme tune for the show into a haunting, unnerving piece of proto-electronica that paired perfectly with the experimental title graphics created by Bernard Lodge by pointing a camera at a monitor displaying the camera’s own image. Hodgson did not only create the clipped but intelligible speech patterns of the Daleks (by using what’s called a ring modulator), he created a wealth of pulsing, humming noise for the backdrop of the Dalek city.\n\nThe result, under the direction of Christopher Barry, is one of the most impressive shots of 1960s television. At the end of the first episode, Barbara, separated from the rest of the TARDIS crew, is menaced by an unseen monster. The next episode starts with a scene among the Doctor, Ian, and Susan plays out in which the Doctor’s cruel ruse to get them to explore the mysterious Dalek city is revealed as it becomes evident that the planet has a fatally high level of radiation and that they must get back to the TARDIS immediately. Repeating the Doctor’s own trick of hijacking a key component of the TARDIS, Ian forces the Doctor to agree to find Barbara before they retreat. They turn, walk through a door, and start, terrified. The camera pulls back from their faces, back through the room they have walked into, revealing these metallic things with recognizable arms and eyes, but not looking like a person at all, and their haunting voices.\n\nThe impact of the scene is evident. The first episode, “The Dead Planet,” pulled 6.9 million viewers. The second, with the Daleks making their first full appearance, fell to 6.4 million. But once they appeared the word of mouth caught on and the Daleks became a small national obsession, with a staggering 8.9 million people tuning in, rising to 10.4 million by the end of the story and firmly establishing Doctor Who as a hit television show.\n\nDue to the vagaries of how copyright worked for BBC production, however, Terry Nation ended up the primary beneficiary of this success. The Daleks, as a concept, remained copyright to him, and his agent, the famed Roger Hancock, was perfectly willing to play hardball with the series’ hit monster. Nation would spend the remainder of his life, and some portion of his afterlife petulantly taking the rights to the Daleks away and giving them back to him with various forms of increased creative control. This despite the fact that his creation was a weeklong rush job with a sketchy description honed to genius by other men.\n\nCynthia’s gaze darted up from her book, as a familiar mechanized chirping emanated from her ship’s console. She sighed, setting the book aside and checking the readout on her screens. Some sort of temporal anomaly, getting in the way of the autopilot’s course. She took manual control of the console for a moment, redirecting the autopilot away from whatever it was picking up. She couldn’t see anything ahead in the void of space, not really… but it was always better to be safe than sorry. She had learned that at home, growing up on Metebelis IV. When the Eight Legs came with their invaders to plunder their resources, she and her family had been forced into hiding. Then the man in the blue box came, this strange little person with an umbrella and wearing a question mark vest. He and his associate, the girl in the jacket full of otherworldly patches and a backpack of explosives. They sorted things out. They liberated Metebelis IV. They saved her life. Now here she was, a million or more miles away from her home world, exploring the stars just like he claimed to.\n\nShe had wanted to learn more about him. Her travels took her to all sorts of planets, and nearly every one had some sort of legend about the man in the blue box. She had gotten a name from one of them, and that had led her to the Library. There was no paper record of what she was looking for at the Library. Just as well, because those books gave her a funny feeling. With ingenuity, she managed to get a digital report of what she was looking for, and the results were right there on her micro-reader. Cynthia paused for a moment, just looking out at the empty space. The computer said she was somewhere inside the constellation of Kasterborous. There had been stories of this place, as well. Some sort of terrible war that had ended in a double genocide, a war that no ordinary person could comprehend. Now Cynthia regarded the emptiness as eerie, a sort of graveyard in space. The sooner she was out of here, the better.\n\nSomething caught her eye then. Something blue, floating through the void. No. It couldn’t be. The rational part of Cynthia’s mind knew it couldn’t be true… but the rest of her, the child who had been saved from the spiders? She knew. He was still out there, saving worlds and sorting things out. Cynthia smiled, a smile that nobody else could see, content with the knowledge that things would be okay in the universe. Inside a blue box that Cynthia had never stepped foot in, a good man and his best friend, an impossible girl, were on route to set another thing right.\n\nAs the Doctor moved on to the next chapter of the story, Cynthia picked up her micro-reader and continued to read.\n\nNevertheless, the show was a bona fide hit, and after a two-episode story by Whitaker designed to give the series a dignified exit point after thirteen episodes if it flopped the show began in earnest. The fourth story, Marco Polo, was used to subtly rejig the dynamic among the cast, with the Doctor becoming less of a potentially malevolent, untrustworthy figure and more of a magical grandfather, albeit one with an occasionally cantankerous streak. This more straightforwardly heroic Doctor reduced the need for Susan to provide a buffer between him and the human characters, and she quickly degenerated into being there mostly to put in danger and have scream – a tendency taken to comedic levels in the story’s final season, which has her decide that the rats in her prison cell are so terrifying that she can’t try to escape, and subsequently feels too queasy to run away from the guillotine.\n\nAnd so Doctor Who continued through its first year. In this period it mostly worked as it had initially set out to, before Terry Nation’s easily produced second script derailed it into BEMs. Historical stories and science fiction plays mostly alternated. Sometimes the historicals were thrilling adventure stories, as with the cavemen and Marco Polo, other times more comedic affairs, as with Dennis Spooner’s French Revolution tale The Reign of Terror, and other times they were morality plays, as with John Lucarotti’s The Aztecs, which features a quietly sad plot of the Doctor and Barbara butting heads on the nature of changing history and cultural imperialism, with the Doctor imploring Barbara not to engage in a doomed effort to cure the Aztecs of their taste for human sacrifice. The science fiction, meanwhile, endeavored for a literary bent, although only Whitaker’s short two-episode story and Peter Newman’s The Sensorites made much progress towards that, the other two stories being Nation-penned pulp adventure. But the show had its approach in mind, and carried it out.\n\nBut as plans began to solidify for a second series of what would be thirty-nine episodes, it was obvious that the show had to return to its glorious moment in popular culture and bring back the Daleks. The creatures’ popularity had made the show itself a clear hit, yes, but they were the star attraction. In addition to being perfectly designed for the iconic, uncanny shot of their first appearance, the Daleks were perfectly poised for children to imitate, giving the show a powerful hold with one of its primary audiences. All you had to do was put a waste paper basket over your head and shout a lot, both tasks children are, to be honest, prone to anyway. So great was their popularity that in December of 1964, a year after their debut, a Newcastle based girl group called The Go-Go’s (not those ones) attempted a novelty single called “I’m Gonna Spend My Christmas With a Dalek.” The single failed to live up to any sense of its title’s promise, but its existence speaks volumes.\n\nAnd so it was almost inevitable that the first story made as part of the second run of production would feature the return of the Daleks in The Dalek Invasion of Earth. Terry Nation, of course, returned with them, and penned six episodes of running around a ruined future Britain after a Dalek invasion, with the Daleks pursuing an absurd scheme of hollowing out the Earth’s core to drive it around as a spaceship. The momentum of the story combined with yet another bit of confident design work (including iconic shots of the Daleks rolling over major London landmarks and of a Dalek rising up out of the Thames) mostly came off well, coming out in exact synch with David Whitaker’s novelization of Nation’s first script, Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks. By the end of 1965 there were Dalek toys in the market, the first of the two Peter Cushing films, and a third Dalek television story, The Chase.\n\nIn many ways The Dalek Invasion of Earth marks the end of an era for Doctor Who. Its existence as a concession to popular culture provides an interesting bind. On the one hand, Sydney Newman, a populist impresario at heart, would have been elated, and Verity Lambert, the producer, enjoyed a clear boost in reputation. But this came at the expense of the series’ literary qualities. The series was a hit, but not for what Newman originally envisioned its purpose as being. The success of the Daleks was based on their visual spectacle, and served as a stunning refutation of the Frick report’s conclusions that attempting special effects-based science fiction on television was a doomed endeavor. But at the same time it refuted her conclusion that literary plays for adults were thus the correct model of science fiction, opening the door for more of the mindless pulp adventure out of which the Daleks sprung.\n\nIt is absurd to suggest that spectacle is the enemy of literary nuance, and the history of Doctor Who is a testament to the many ways they can blend. Nevertheless, the Daleks introduced new concerns to Doctor Who. The second block of production was full of attempts to create the next hit monster. There were the Zarbi, mute ant men in Bill Strutton’s The Web Planet, who served as the series’ first literal race of bug-eyed monsters, followed by the Mechanoids, literal rivals to the Daleks in The Chase, and, in the final story produced in this run (but held back to kick off the third block of transmitted episodes), the Chumblies, a race of robotic servants. And along with this turn comes the departure of David Whitaker, replaced as script editor by Dennis Spooner – a move that did not bring an end to Doctor Who’s investment in the literary, but that marked a clear step away from it, Whitaker having been a major engine of that aesthetic in the first series.\n\nAlso departing in The Dalek Invasion of Earth was Carole Ann Ford’s character of Susan, the Doctor’s granddaughter. Ford was frustrated with her character’s collapse into generic peril monkey, and wanted to pursue meatier dramatic roles, which, as was the fate of most Doctor Who supporting cast members, never really panned out. Not wanting to abandon the show’s winning formula, Verity Lambert and company set out to design a more or less like-for-like replacement, Vicki: a futuristic human girl who crash-landed on a remote planet and was rescued by the Doctor. So similar in conception to Susan was this character that Sydney Newman suggested that the actress who played her, Maureen O’Brien, might cut her hair and dye it black, to which O’Brien icily replied that if that was what they wanted, they should hire Carole Ann Ford back.\n\nThe task of managing the series through this significant transition in its central concept was given to Whitaker, a sort of one last job in handling the major creative directions of this fledgling series before he returned to the life of a freelancer. Attentive to the difficulties, the decision was made to focus on Vicki’s introduction in a focused, two-week character piece. Whitaker, it seems, proceeded to give Dennis Spooner, his successor, a tricky script to handle – Spooner describes the episodes as being twice as long as they were supposed to be, an error Whitaker surely knew better than to make having been handling scripts for over a year. But whatever Whitaker’s slight hazing of his successor, the resulting story was a success – a thematically dense bit of television theater that carefully introduced a new type of character and established her in relation to the existing cast.\n\nIt is worth reflecting on the nature of Vicki in order to get a sense of what the program was actually like in this period. Susan’s role as the Doctor’s granddaughter was, of course, the hook upon which the first episode of the series hung itself. The initial mystery of the series was “who is this strangely futuristic-seeeming teenager,” and the answer to that initiated a series of sci-fi adventures. Susan was a part of the link between the perfectly ordinary world Ian and Barbara inhabited and the science fiction world from which the Doctor hails. In this regard, she was always the least essential character. The show’s tension and innovation initially came from the juxtaposition of the ordinary Ian and Barbara and the bizarre settings that the TARDIS landed in. Once Susan had joined the schoolteachers and the Doctor, her role was in many ways done.\n\nWith Vicki, then, Lambert, Spooner, and Whitaker created a character who served as a different sort of link between the ordinary world and the Doctor. On the one hand, great care is taken to stress that Vicki is British, and from the same world as Ian and Barbara, only from the 25th century. On the other, Vicki clearly does come out of the same sort of science fiction world as the Doctor. The result is a character that was well-placed for the dawn of 1965, as the Beatles-style youth culture rose. The Beatles’ third album, Beatles for Sale, came out the day before the third episode of The Dalek Invasion of Earth, and featured liner notes talking about “a radioactive, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn,” and save for the cigar, this seems firmly the mould in which Vicki was designed – as a present day teenager who happens to be from five hundred years in the future.\n\nThis attention to conceptual clarity – making sure the new companion adequately addressed the problems of the old one – was a hallmark of the program under Dennis Spooner. All of his episodes were marked with a high concept clarity. Trips to the past became opportunities to explore a particular genre or style – Spooner himself penned The Romans, the third episode of which is a straight-up farce, and David Whitaker returned again to write The Crusade, which manages a credible impression of Shakespeare writing an action serial. The Crusade, along with the previous story, The Web Planet, became the second and third stories to be novelized. The Web Planet, by Bill Strutton, was an aesthetically daring sci-fi story featuring no humanoid characters whatsoever besides the regular cast and a mysterious alien world dominated by a strange, otherworldly intelligence called the Animus. The script played up its own strangeness: at one point a set of underground insect aliens discusses the problem of having to break through a wall, saying, “A silent wall. We must make mouths in it with our weapons. Then it speak more light.” This ostentatiously alien dialogue was paired with acting featuring strange experimental choreography by Roslyn de Winter, and a visual aesthetic that gave everything an unsettling halo due to a decision to smear Vaseline on all of the camera lenses. The Web Planet’s reach preposterously exceeded its grasp, but the fact that the BBC was even willing to try something so audacious serves as a testament to the popular swagger the series had. And sure enough, the first episode of The Web Planet pulled in thirteen-and-a-half million viewers, a million more than the high profile return of the Daleks had done three months earlier.\n\nNevertheless, by the time of the third go-around with the Daleks, The Chase, almost everybody who had been associated with the program was exhausted. For Verity Lambert, William Russell, and Jacqueline Hill it had been a grueling run of work: they had produced seventy-two episodes of television in seventy-seven weeks, and scored a solid hit. Nevertheless, almost all of them were ready to move on. So was Dennis Spooner, who burnt out as script editor in six months, following Whitaker’s swift path back to being a freelancer. Over the next handful of stories produced, all of them left – Russell and Hill in The Chase, replaced by Peter Purves as the former space pilot Steven Taylor, and Spooner ostensibly left with the same story, although he scripted the next story, The Time Meddler, for incoming script editor Donald Tosh. That story was another take on the historical, this time introducing a fellow member of the Doctor’s species who travels around just to meddle with history, and served as the second season finale. Lambert left five episodes later, which marked the conclusion of the second block of production. These five episodes consisted of the third season premiere, Galaxy Four, and a Dalek episode that would not feature the Doctor, Steven, or Vicki at all. In the course of Galaxy Four Lambert was shadowed by incoming producer John Wiles, who ended up doing much of the work on Galaxy Four. Wiles was a long-time BBC veteran who had script edited a bevy of programs. Maureen O’Brien and Hartnell, on the other hand, seemed eager to continue.\n\nThis was good for Hartnell, in that it provided a vestige of continuity where otherwise he would be the only old hand left on the program. Hartnell could be difficult to work with, to say the least, but he got along well with O’Brien. Hartnell had been fond of Carole Ann Ford as well, strongly urging her not to leave the part on the grounds that one ought not abandon a steady paycheck – in hindsight wise advice, given the paucity of later career success for Ford, but with O’Brien he found a common cause in holding the scripts to high production standards. For Hartnell, the program was a late career renaissance that he valued for making him popular with children in a way that the hard-edged military roles he was previously typecast in could not. He valued this audience and took special care with details of the program, making sure that, for instance, the controls of the TARDIS worked consistently from episode to episode and the switch that operated the door was always the same one. O’Brien, on the other hand, had, in cuttingly declining to have her character be a straightforward clone of Carole Ann Ford’s, started as she meant to go on. She was unapologetic in raising issues she had with the scripts, and often found an ally in Hartnell, which produced an at times more than slightly disruptive effect in rehearsals.\n\nWiles decided this was a problem while sitting in on Galaxy Four, and arranged that O’Brien would depart the program early in the third production block. Initially there was some debate over exactly where this would happen. At one point Vicki was to be killed around the halfway point of Wiles’s second story. This story was an obligation Wiles had inherited: a suggestion from BBC Managing Director Huw Weldon, who noted that his mother-in-law quite liked the Daleks, and thus proposed that instead of two six-part Dalek stories as they had done in the second production block, the series do one twelve-part Dalek story. The alternative, which was ultimately what was decided on, was to write her out at the end of Wiles’s first story, a historical set in the course of The Trojan War called The Myth Makers. The departure felt as hasty on screen as the behind-the-scenes decisions leading to it had been, with her falling in love with Troilus and deciding to stay in Ancient Greece, a development with no setup to speak of, Troilus only having made his first appearance in the third of the story’s four episodes. Replacing Vicki was a temporary companion named Katarina, who ended up with the shortest run of a Doctor Who assistant at five episodes, using what was briefly to have been Vicki’s death scene in the fourth episode of The Daleks’ Masterplan.\n\nThe prospect of a twelve-episode Dalek saga enthused almost nobody who actually had to make it. Perhaps least enthused was Terry Nation, who by this time came to feel he had better things to do than script episodes of Doctor Who. Nation was only willing to write six of the twelve episodes, and to provide an outline for the other six, which were to be completed by Dennis Spooner. In practice Nation allegedly provided twenty-four pages of notes that script editor Donald Tosh had to hastily turn into something resembling episodes. Thankfully, in order to manage the logistical nightmare Douglas Camfield was hired to direct the serial. Camfield was a long-time veteran of the series, having served as a production assistant in its earliest days, and directing nine episodes of the second production block of the series. He was a tremendously efficient director, giving his crew military-like ranks and establishing a firm chain of command, but a knack for sheer pragmatism, including offering cash rewards to anyone who could solve a technical problem on the fly. Used to rewriting the script as he went anyway, Camfield had less trouble than most adapting to the news that he didn’t strictly speaking have one.\n\nIt was wholly understandable that Nation’s head would be turned, though. For him, the Daleks and Doctor Who didn’t have to have anything to do with one another. Due to some savvy negotiating on the part of his agent, Terry Nation retained the copyright to the Daleks themselves, and he was free to license them separately from the BBC (which was already licensing Doctor Who considerably more than a normal show). Indeed, the Daleks never appeared in the Doctor Who comics that came out during the Hartnell era (nor, for that matter, did any of the companions – Doctor Who, as he was called in the comics, was accompanied by his grandchildren John and Gillian), instead appearing in their own comics in a rival publication. Dalek toys and merchandise was widespread, with the bulk of the revenue going to Terry Nation. Similarly, when the first two Dalek stories were adapted to films starring Peter Cushing by Amicus Productions, Nation benefitted nicely (as did David Whitaker, who did the adaptations and wrote large swaths of the spin-off material for Doctor Who), and thus found the low-paying writing job of Doctor Who a somewhat frustrating part of the plan. Nation was by this time hatching a scheme to bring the Daleks over to American television, a move that did not work out for him, and The Daleks’ Masterplan would be his last involvement with the series for nearly seven years.\n\nThe story borrows its aesthetic from the comic strip adventures of the Daleks, embracing the Dan Dare-style space adventures that Nation always favored for big, colorful battles among soaring fleets of Daleks. This was, of course, wholly impossible on a BBC budget, or indeed in any visual medium besides comics, but the appeal was there. The Daleks’ Masterplan is necessarily more modest, but the Space Agency and the Guardian of the Solar System that provide the background for the epic are dead giveaways of the story’s heritage. Over its mammoth twelve-week run, however, the story would drift, becoming a comedy for several episodes as it intersected Christmas and New Year’s Days, and then returning to the grimness of its opening, a brutal-action packed chain of episodes culminating in the horrific death of Katarina and the introduction of Sara Kingdom, who served as a temporary companion for the last eight episodes of the story before dying in the bleak final episode, “The Destruction of Time.”\n\nWiles, discovering quickly that he much preferred writing to producing, stayed with the program for two further stories. The first was the chaotic The Massacre, which required substantial rewrites and featured a hastily appended final scene introducing new companion Dodo Chaplet, who simply wanders into the TARDIS without explanation while it’s parked on present day Earth, abruptly bringing to an end an extremely emotionally tense fight between Steven and the Doctor over the ethics of changing history. The second was The Ark, an unusually structured science fiction story marred by some unfortunate colonialist themes in its depiction of conflict between a race of white humans and their dark-skinned servent race the Monoids. Donald Tosh left at around the same time, and they were replaced by Gerry Davis as script editor and Innes Lloyd as producer.\n\nLloyd, hand picked by Sydney Newman to reinvigorate the program, found himself with a spectacularly rough start. Much as Verity Lambert had shepherded the early stages of The Daleks’ Masterplan into production, Lloyd’s first story, The Celestial Toymaker, was intended to be largely set up with a script rewritten by Donald Tosh and a number of casting decisions made by John Wiles. Unfortunately the project blew up in Lloyd’s face in a complex bit of BBC internal politics, and he and Gerry Davis were faced with the prospect of cobbling together a new story around a few scraps of the original script. The result was a tedious four-parter made worse by the villain, a yellow peril style Chinese toymaker (the word “celestial” doubles as Victorian slang for the Chinese), sufficiently embarrassing that John Wiles apologized and blamed Lloyd for not simply abandoning the story altogether. This was followed by The Gunfighters, another project Lloyd and Davis inherited. A comedy historical set in the American west at the OK Corral, The Gunfighters went over particularly poorly, garnering the single lowest Audience Appreciation Index of the program’s history, and convincing Lloyd and Davis that the historical was a subgenre of Doctor Who best abandoned.\n\nBut after this rough start, Lloyd quickly set about transforming the program in his own image. He had Steven Taylor written out in his third story, The Savages, and eliminated Dodo Chaplet in the next story. His zeal to transform the program is visible in this departure – Dodo is mind controlled through most of the first two episodes, finally passes out, and simply does not appear again; her farewells and decision to stay in London are simply conveyed by Lloyd’s new companions, Ben and Polly. But the overhaul of the supporting cast was nothing compared to what Lloyd planned next: replacing the Doctor.\n\nThe story of Hartnell’s departure from the program is typically framed as a tragic end. Hartnell had very little career after the program, and it quickly became apparent that he was far sicker than he knew. On top of that, there is no question that Hartnell was forced out. Lloyd had no patience for his growing temper following the loss of all the people he trusted from the earliest days of the series, and there had been talk of replacing Hartnell as early as The Celestial Toymaker. And so over the course of filming for The Smugglers, made in the third production block but, like the second and third season premieres, held back for the start of the next season he politely but firmly ushered Hartnell out the door.\n\nTwo things, however, are important to realize. The first is that the decision was almost certainly necessary. Hartnell’s performances are still usually strong throughout the third season, but even a cursory comparison of his work in the first season, where he with gusto enriched a program bristling with ideas, and his work in the third season, where he appeared to be on autopilot through increasingly depressive scripts. It wasn’t just that he was getting difficult to work with, nor that he was growing frustrated that everyone he knew and relied on was leaving, or indeed, had left by the end of the third season. Even the second generation of actors like Peter Purves and Maureen O’Brien that Hartnell had learned to work with were gone, and in their place another set of actors Hartnell was too tired and too frustrated to put much effort into learning to work with. The show was barely functioning, and tempers were fraying.\n\nThe stresses behind the screen were, increasingly, being mirrored on the screen. As soon as John Wiles arrived, the series had taken a somber tone. His first story, The Myth Makers, began as a light comedy not unlike the Season Two farce The Romans, only to end in the violent, horrific sacking of Troy, with events turning dire in the episode’s closing minutes as Vicki is practically lost in the crowd and Steven suffers a life-threatening injury. The next story, a long and violent Dalek epic, killed off two companions, and the story after that, The Massacre, is as dark as its title suggests. After that came the arrogant imperialism of The Ark and the casual racism of The Celestial Toymaker. By the season-ending The War Machines, the series was taking place in contemporary London, where malevolent robots controlled out of Post Office Tower were controlling minds and killing people.\n\nAlong with this came what turned out to be Hartnell’s genuinely frail health. His career was coming to an end due to his advancing arteriosclerosis, and the real truth is that the series simply would not have continued for much longer with him as the star. The brutal rate of production had chewed up and spat out everyone else working on it, and the show, by any standard, had a good run of one-hundred-and-twenty-six episodes. There would have been no shame in cancelling it, especially given a fairly sharp decline in ratings and the poor reception of several stories. And yet this obvious course of action was avoided.\n\nInstead an altogether stranger plan was hatched: the Doctor would be recast. Initially the idea was conservative – another actor would carry on essentially mimicking Hartnell’s performance. But steadily the idea grew more radical: the Doctor would drastically change his face and effectively become a new character. This move was truly bizarre – so much so that it is at first difficult to imagine what could have prompted it. Why would the BBC preserve Doctor Who under these circumstances when it would have been far simpler to simply let the program go?\n\nThe answer has to do with what sort of program Doctor Who was. Its tremendous rate of production meant that it was a mainstay of television, preserved by simple inertia. Beyond that, there was a lot of money riding on it. Doctor Who produced merchandising like nothing else the BBC owned. There were comics, movies, and toys – and that was just the stuff that bore the label Doctor Who as opposed to focusing entirely on the Daleks, which Terry Nation was glad to separately license. Indeed, the truth is that the series was saved in 1966 by the Daleks, whose popularity meant that the BBC sought to preserve what it saw as one of its crown jewels even in light of the toxic atmosphere that was spilling out off-screen and on. And so the mandate was to continue it. If Innes Lloyd believed this was best accomplished with a mad scheme like recasting the lead role, so be it. It was an avaricious decision, and one born out of sad circumstances in the form of William Hartnell’s rapid physical decline.\n\nAnd yet it was a stroke of genius that single-handedly changed the program from what William Hartnell initially (and optimistically) predicted – a program that could run for five years – into one that has persisted for fifty. The fact that the recasting of the lead actor into an entirely new sort of character allowed the program to change with the times meant that it became an institution. There became no reason to cancel the program as long as it remained reasonably popular. And even with its dip at the end of the third season, the program was more than reasonably popular.\n\nHartnell’s departure was announced on July 29th, 1966, four days after completion of filming for The Smugglers a pirate adventure story that included a substantial location shoot in Cornwall. The same day, Innes Lloyd secured the services of Patrick Troughton, a respected character actor, as the new Doctor, to take over, with his first episode set to film three months later. But before Troughton’s debut in November of 1966, Hartnell would have one swan song, to be called The Tenth Planet.\n\nHe glanced up from the book—something had jostled a memory loose. After a half-hour’s worth of digging through stacks of decrepit magazines and paperbacks, he found the little programme guide, now jaundiced with age, and turned to a page that some reader in the 20th Century had earmarked:\n\n“AA(2) Unreleased; filmed ca. April 1966?\n\nTHE SHADOW PLANET\n\nWriter: Elbridge Bain (presumed pseud.)\n\nDirector: None listed\n\nRegular cast: see W above, minus Hartnell\n\nStory: We should first emphasize that “The Shadow Planet” isn’t considered canonical by a section of Doctor Who fandom, which argues that the serial is most likely a 16mm fan film, made sometime in the 1970s, and wrongly considered a “lost” Hartnell-era story. To the naysayers’ credit, there is the following to consider. No reference to “Shadow Planet” has yet been found in the BBC archives. There are no scripts (the scriptwriter credited on the episode, “Elbridge Bain,” doesn’t seem to exist otherwise), no casting information, no budget allocations, no Radio Times notices. There are no press photos, John Cura tele-snaps or audio recordings. And the First Doctor, William Hartnell, notably doesn’t appear in the surviving episode footage (Ep. 2 and sections of Ep. 3).\n\nThat said, Steven Taylor (Peter Purves) is quite obviously in the surviving footage, looking much as he did in “The Gunfighters” or “The Savages,” serials hailing from the same period in which “Shadow Planet” allegedly was produced. The sets, costumes, sound effects and musical cues are in line with other 1966 Doctor Who productions, with some keen-eyed fans noting props reappearing from 1965’s “The Web Planet.”\n\nGiven that only 30 minutes’ worth of footage has surfaced, it’s difficult to summarize the plot of “Shadow Planet.” The surviving episode 2 opens with Steven and Dodo (Jackie Lane) at a conning tower on an unnamed planet, repairing a console so as to communicate with “Helix Base A.” The Doctor is on the TARDIS, mysteriously taken ill; the companions are trying to contact the base to get a physician. It must be said the pacing is glacial even by Hartnell-era standards—there’s a five-minute sequence in which Steven and Dodo try to coordinate a series of lights on the console.\n\n(An aside: Lane was shown this episode in the 1990s but claimed that she wasn’t in it, pointing out that Dodo is always filmed from behind or shown in long shot, so that another actor or actress could have portrayed the character. Lane’s voice is quite obviously dubbed in, but she claimed she had no memory of doing voice work for the episode, which she found “disturbing.”)\n\nThe episode’s legendary reputation is owed to its final minutes, in which a character called Haruman, evidently the conning tower operator, appears. The actor, who has yet to be identified, seems under the influence of some psychoactive drug—he has trouble hitting his marks (the camera regularly has to move to keep him in frame), fumbles dialogue and apparently improvises some lines, including “there is no outside, Mr. Taylor, it’s all inside,” “death beyond the red hand!” and “there are 15 in the tower: have you seen them?”\n\nThe surviving pieces of Episode 3 (two roughly five-minute sequences, one of which is the cliffhanger lead-in) were not shown publicly until the late 1990s. These were found in a car boot sale in Surrey and their questionable provenance has inspired another theory—that the Ep. 3 fragments were a fan’s response to seeing Ep. 2 (so, a possible fan fake inspired by a possible fan fake). But again, the production values, music, camera angles, lighting and Purves’ physical appearance seem “correct” for the era.\n\nThe fragments find Steven (no Dodo here; no explanation why) having reached Helix Base A with Haruman. There are some 10 extras, apparently playing the surviving base members, who spend the first fragment hurling props at Steven, who’s taken cover in a ruined control room. Purves’ performance, which moves from bafflement to rage, is worth noting.\n\n(Pay particular attention to the extras in the far left of the shot—a man and a woman, dressed identically. As reviewers have noted, the woman looks horrified, is quivering with fear and is making a repeated hand gesture.)\n\nThe other fragment finds Steven being converted by Haruman (“take the shadow, Mr. Taylor! Accept the shadow!”) via some type of sensory manipulation machine, but this fragment is in rough condition, consisting mainly of blurred images and white-outs, due to apparently overexposed film. Purves consistently has refused to comment on the serial. Rumors that Episode 4 also survived, and was once shown at a cinema in Hull to unsuspecting viewers, appear dubious.”\n\nHad he seen Episode 4 once? Who did play Haruman? He thought for a while, then resumed reading his original book…\n\nIf Doctor Who spent the summer of 1966 undergoing radical changes, it was not alone. 1966 was a big summer for England. First and foremost, of course, was the World Cup, held in England. The tournament concluded with a final in Wembley Stadium between England and West Germany, which England won in extra time by scoring two goals, providing an iconic television moment as BBC announcer Kenneth Wolstenholme gave his famous “they think it’s all over! It is now, it’s four!” quote as Geoff Hurst scored England’s fourth and final goal while fans began streaming onto the pitch. It was a crowning moment of national pride – as though World War II finally had an official scoreline of 4-2.\n\nBut behind that was an England suspended perfectly between the two halves of the 1960s. On one half was the portion of the decade belonging to the so-called mods. The mods were a largely British phenomenon, inexorably linked to the rise of the Beatles, particularly the 1963/64 “Beatlemania.” Within Britain, Doctor Who was inexorably linked with this: the popularity of the Beatles coincided with the sister craze of Dalekmania the Christmas of 1964. It is a strange aesthetic that tries to encompass “Ticket to Ride” and the Daleks, and yet that was exactly what the first episode of The Chase did, having Vicki rock out to a clip of the band nicked from the most recent Top of the Pops. And in truth, the difference was not that great. Vicki, like the Beatles, demonstrably hailed to Liverpool, and seemed designed to answer the call for a starchild of the future that the early Beatles seemed to herald. The early 1960s seemed pregnant with future, with the UK, in 1966, seemingly back where it still, in its heart, belonged: at the center of the world, the sun never setting upon it.\n\nScratch the surface, however, and things were altogether more unsettled. The British Empire was collapsing by the day, and the reality was that Britain’s cultural dominance in the 1960s marked the transition from the most powerful nation in the world to an also-ran that bordered on being a client state to one of its own former colonies. If Britain dominated the world in the 1960s, it was only because Britain was doing an excellent job of marketing its culture to the United States, who bought into British music from the Beatles on, and who bought into British television series like The Avengers. Meanwhile, the bright future promised by the wave of post-War science fiction was fading to an altogether more uncertain relationship with technology in the face of the growing realization that one wrong geopolitical world could unleash a planet-destroying nuclear war.\n\nThis provoked an altogether more unsettled relationship between people and the future, and the sleek future-chic of the mods slowly but surely gave way to a very different sort of cultural craze. The Beatles navigated this almost perfectly, veering towards psychedelia and the hippie aesthetic almost exactly in sync with the culture. And by 1966 the transition was well underway. In the UK, these were the glory days of the underground press. Magazines like Oz and the International Times were cropping up, bringing with them a newly rebellious aesthetic in which Ezra Pound’s pro-German wartime speeches are published in full alongside interviews discussing the quality of marijuana in London.\n\nWhat jumps out first about Hartnell’s swan song is how perfectly it captures the mood of the era. On the one hand, The Tenth Planet plugs in perfectly to the growing sense of unease with the sci-fi utopia that had been being promised constantly since the end of the War. It was written by Kit Pedler, whose idea of an evil power emanating out of Post Office tower had been the underlying inspiration for the third season finale, The War Machines. Like that story, The Tenth Planet is full of paranoid action: a near-future space launch facility at the South Pole is besieged by the alien Cybermen. But the story reflected a more idiosyncratic fear on Pedler’s part. Pedler, an ophthalmologist, was gravely concerned by the prospect of artificial organs and the use of machines to sustain human life, and imagined the Cybermen as a dystopic extension of that trend: humans who had steadily replaced their entire bodies with plastic “spare parts” until they became robotic terrors – metallic mummies whose stark open mouths poured out a grotesque parody of human speech patterns as they explained that they had no emotions, and would be making the population of Earth like themselves.\n\nBut for all that the Cybermen represented fears of science running rampant and unchecked, there was something altogether more uncanny and strange about them. The Tenth Planet is less interested in its monsters than the planet they ride in on. This titular tenth planet of the solar system is Mondas, the Earth’s long-lost twin planet, which appears to be the Earth reversed so that Antarctica is at the north of the planet. The Cybermen are literally humanity’s evil twins, who became monstrous in the course of their planet’s long, slow “journey to the edge of space.” In Pedler’s original conception, they were a race of “star monks,” closely tying their spiritual malaise to the growing new age movement, a central pillar of late-60s counterculture. They were not just monsters, but encounters with the death of civilization and of humanity itself, and the near-future setting of 1986 made the end seem all the nearer.\n\nThe spiritual nature of the Cybermen was mirrored in how the transition from William Hartnell to Patrick Troughton was conceived. In the notes that Innes Lloyd and Gerry Davis drew up about how to handle the switch, describing it as “a metaphysical change” that is “as if he has had the LSD drug and instead of experiencing the kicks, he has the hell and dank horror which can be its effect.” Aside from raising the interesting question of which members of the Doctor Who production team were being relied on as sources for that description, this speaks volumes about the changing times. Hartnell’s Doctor and the Victorian vision of empire and adventure he embodied confronts a dying race that explored the stars with the same scientific vision that he defined himself against, and became unliving things. The horrific energy of this place forces a “metaphysical change” upon him; he literally becomes a new man.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, the implications of this were still up in the air. Everyone had their own idea of how Troughton should play the part. Many skewed towards the actively theatrical – just as Hartnell’s Doctor was an austere yet grandfatherly scientist, so Troughton’s Doctor was, at various times, conceived of as a swashbuckling Arabian figure (that Troughton would have apparently played blacked up) or a pirate captain. At an increasingly tense meeting to nail the decision down, Gerry Davis noted Troughton’s careful demeanor as he remained silent through much of the meeting, visibly trying to figure out what sorts of power struggles were being played out, and finally kicked everyone out of the meeting and developed the character with Troughton in private.\n\nThe resulting character took elements of Sydney Newman’s suggestion of the new Doctor as a “cosmic hobo,” but mixed them with Davis’s observations of Troughton and the sense of the Doctor as having undergone a bad acid trip. The Doctor’s clothes were to be disheveled, battered versions of the old Doctor’s clothes, and he was to regain the sense of unfamiliarity and strangeness that had defined the character in the earliest days of the program. Instead of the Doctor being angry and hostile to everyone, however, the Doctor would simply be a bit strange.\n\nDavis was helped here by the relative newness of the rest of the show’s cast. The companions, Ben and Polly, had only been introduced three stories earlier, and were part of a rapid turnover in the show in general. The fourth season would open with The Smugglers, a held over story from the show’s third production block. In it, Ben and Polly go on their first trip in the TARDIS, allowing the series’ premises to be reintroduced for new viewers. The very next story would throw those premises up in the air by suddenly removing the lead actor. And from that point, there would be a new lead. With Ben and Polly already having recently been used to re-explain the premise of the show, they slotted nicely into the role previously played by Ian and Barbara – representatives of the audience’s world who would ask the same questions the viewers would. Troughton’s Doctor, on the other hand, would ask the questions the audience wouldn’t know to ask, serving as a figure who affected things from the margins.\n\nSince this was in effect a soft relaunch of the entire program, Davis further decided that the best way to accomplish this was to stick with what had worked in the past. And so it was that the Daleks, having defined the program’s initial success, were brought back once again to help define it’s second one. Although the bloom had come slightly off the rose in terms of the Daleks’ popularity, the Peter Cushing adaptation of The Dalek Invasion of Earth had been reasonably successful in the summer of 1966, and they were still the best weapon the series had. This time, however, Terry Nation was too busy to write it, and so instead David Whitaker, who had served as Nation’s ghost writer on several pieces of auxiliary Dalek material like the Panther Books Dalek Book, was drafted to write it. After a last minute set of rewrites by Dennis Spooner, who was brought in because Whitaker had moved on to other assignments and was not free to make some revisions requested by Sydney Newman, The Power of the Daleks was ready to shoot on October 22nd, 1966.\n\nThe Power of the Daleks is almost certainly one of the most impressive pieces of British television of the 1960s, although this is impossible to determine for certain because nobody has seen it in decades. Poor archival practices brought on by an understandable failure to anticipate technological changes like the VCR and changes to television programming brought on by the renegotiation of terms prohibiting reruns with the actor’s union, Equity, meant that a large amount of 1960s and even some 1970s Doctor Who (along with many other programs) was destroyed by the BBC. Although some of this material, including everything from the 1970s, has been found, and rumors persist about recoveries of much of it, there will almost certainly always be at least some gaps in the archive for Doctor Who, and at the time of writing, all six episodes of The Power of the Daleks are among them. Thankfully both the audio track (recorded by a fan of the program) and a combination of promotional photographs and stills captured by John Cura’s Telesnaps service exist, and fans have matched these up to produce reconstructions of these and the other ninety-seven missing episodes.\n\nThe story takes the concept of Troughton’s Doctor being a figure who lurks at the margins seriously. For large stretches of the story the Doctor appears to ignore the problems around him, refusing to advance the plot for reasons he generally declines to explain to anyone around him. Much of the story focuses on the politics of a human colony and on how the colony’s discovery of a crashed Dalek ship with living Daleks preserved inside causes their political order to unravel. Instead of the shrieking armies of Daleks shown in many of Nation’s Dalek stories, Whitaker uses a relatively small number of Daleks and has them lie and manipulate the humans around them. In one crucial scene in the second episode, a newly revived Dalek slowly passes the Doctor, it’s eyestalk visibly turning to stare at him, recognizing him and in effect confirming for the viewer that yes, Patrick Troughton really is the Doctor now. The episode then reaches its cliffhanger as the Doctor implores the colonists to destroy the Daleks because of how dangerous they are, the Dalek proceeds to shout him down, shrieking “I AM YOUR SER-VANT” over and over again in the same voice in which it usually cries “EXTERMINATE.”\n\nUnder Troughton, the Doctor became a role that fit perfectly with the emerging psychedelic culture. He was mercurial and prone to trickery, adept at chemistry, and possessed a magic box that served to literalize the title of Aldous Huxley’s psychedelic classic The Doors of Perception. In stories like The Highlanders, The Underwater Menace, and The Macra Terror he arrived in various locations and upended the social order, fomenting mass revolutions or, at times, slaughters as he destroyed corrupt and evil authority figures. His tendency to playfully try on hats and fiddle about on a recorder made him an almost storybook figure – a sort of magical jester straight out of any number of classics of children’s literature. A year before Jefferson Airplane turned the iconography of Alice in Wonderland into their psychedelic anthem “White Rabbit,” Troughton was crafting an anti-authority eccentric scientist who would have fit perfectly into Carroll’s strange and whimsical world.\n\nThis tendency culminated in the finale of the fourth season, The Evil of the Daleks. During the recording of The Power of the Daleks, Terry Nation pitched a Dalek series to the BBC, which decided it was uninterested in the idea. Nation, accordingly, decided to pursue creating the series in the United States, and, with his relationship with the BBC strained at best, it was generally agreed upon that the Daleks should be written out of Doctor Who. The job of doing so was, unsurprisingly, given to David Whitaker, who turned out a seven-part script that culminated in a battle between two rival factions of Daleks that ravages Skaro. The ending satisfyingly split the difference between killing all of the Daleks and leaving open the possibility that a few survived, thus allowing everyone to put the Daleks in mothballs for a while; indeed, they would not appear again on the show for five years, longer than the time that elapsed between their first and then-potential last appearance.\n\nWhitaker’s script is in many ways the iconic 1960s iteration of the Daleks. These early Dalek stories are, after the first, aware of their epic heft, and are all made as showcases for the series’ most popular aspect. Under Terry Nation’s pen, the stories are action-packed serials, longer on spectacle than intelligence, but more often competently made than not. Even the episodes that have been lost have in their own say survived the test of time, with numerous accounts of their key scenes from viewers for whom they were burned into memory. But in the end, even if he owned a key piece of the copyright, all Terry Nation had created were some fairly generic evil aliens who were pushed to popularity by some of the best visual design work of the 1960s. His stories were adequate showpieces for the phenomenal work of Raymond Cusick and Brian Hodgson in developing the props and sound effects.\n\nBut the two Dalek stories written by David Whitaker take a different tone. Whitaker’s scripts for Hartnell had an erudite quality; his first owed a tremendous debt to experimental theater, whereas his third, The Crusade, was self-consciously written in a mock-Shakespearean style. He was with the program from the beginning, and was always committed to using it to juxtapose unexpected and even dissonant elements, adhering to the modernist aesthetic of strangeness that the series initially sprung from. Under his pen, the epic stakes inherent to Dalek stories were matched by tightly knit and character-based drama. The Evil of the Daleks features a Faustian bargain in Victorian England juxtaposed with a modern-day setting, all building to a massive final battle as the action returns to Skaro itself and the Doctor meets the towering Emperor of the Daleks.\n\nAround all of this are Whitaker’s sweeping themes. The Doctor is drawn into an attempt to isolate “the human factor” and “the Dalek factor,” the essential traits that define the two species. The Daleks plan to use the TARDIS, which they have stolen, to spread the Dalek factor across all of time and space, while the Doctor introduces the human factor to the Daleks, creating a faction that rebels against the other Daleks, sparking their civil war. These broad philosophical themes twist through a plot in which the Daleks arrive through a Victorian time machine made of mirrors and static electricity and tempt a rich man with the promise of the secret of alchemy. This strange and mystic Victorian setting extends out of a first episode set tightly in the present day, to the point of featuring the Beatles’ “Paperback Writer.” Airing the same week that Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is released, the episode perfectly tracks the changing mood and the swing into the so-called Summer of Love in all its psychedelic glory, framing it all in the sort of sci-fi action epic the Daleks belong to.\n\nIts success is in many ways remarkable. The final action sequence was tremendously ambitious, and the BBC design team ultimately ended up using toy Daleks for a number of elaborate model sequences. On top of that, all of this was made under massive time pressure. The intended production schedule for Doctor Who was that episodes would be made three weeks in advance. The complexities of recasting the lead actor, however, meant that the show took a week off between The Tenth Planet and Power of the Daleks. The show fell another week behind during the production of Troughton’s third story, The Underwater Menace, which involved several underwater effects shots that proved more complex than expected. This meant that for most of the fourth production block the series was being made a week before transmission, a nerverackingly tight schedule. And yet out of this chaotic pressure cooker of a production environment came one of the creative highs of the series. And while the ratings did not rebound to their 1965 heights, this creative renaissance was at least enough to stabilize the show.\n\nIt had, however, been a grueling production even compared to the first three. Script editor Gerry Davis and producer Innes Lloyd were both eager to move on. Davis departed first, at the end of the fourth production block, and was replaced by his assistant, Peter Bryant midway through The Evil of the Daleks. Lloyd had also once again tired of the supporting cast, and had Ben and Polly written out in the season’s penultimate story, The Faceless Ones. As with Dodo before them, their characters were unceremoniously dumped, getting kidnapped two episodes into the story and only appearing again in the sixth episode, in a pre-filmed departure scene. By this point the crew had been augmented by Frazer Hines, playing Jamie McCrimmon, a piper from the Battle of Culloden introduced in Troughton’s second story, which would prove the last time for a very long time that the series would do a purely historical story with no sci-fi elements beyond the TARDIS itself. The Evil of the Daleks, meanwhile, introduced Deborah Watling as Victoria Waterfield, a young Victorian girl orphaned by the Daleks. The presence of these two historical characters meant that for the first sustained period in its history Doctor Who would have a regular cast featuring nobody from contemporary England. Troughton’s Doctor, already a character created out of the fairy tale aesthetic of psychedelia, was in effect now accompanied by two storybook characters.\n\nWith Lloyd planning to depart as well, Peter Bryant was pre-selected to become producer midway through the fifth production block. Since he had never produced before, it was decided that he should do a trial run before getting the position permanently. Accordingly, The Tomb of the Cybermen the final story of the fourth production block, designed to be aired at the start of the fifth season much like The Smugglers, Galaxy Four, and Planet of Giants before it, was given over to Bryant as a proving ground.\n\nThe Tomb of the Cybermen marked the third appearance of the monsters, who were at this point actively being groomed as replacements for the Daleks. They had already come back in The Moonbase, just four stories after their first appearance, and had by this point been transformed almost entirely from their original conception. In The Tenth Planet they are perverse mockeries of humanity. But by the time of Tomb of the Cybermen they are little more than lumbering robots. Their lack of emotions, originally an extension of their plastic, artificial lives now became a product of the Cybermen’s “logical” nature. In practice they were allegories for the Soviet Union, invading through spies and infiltrators, mechanized in the same way that the Soviet Union fetishized itself as being. The stories were also no longer being written entirely by Kit Pedler, who had required substantial rewrites for both The Tenth Planet and The Moonbase. Perhaps mindful of how use of the Daleks was complicated by an overly involved writer, Pedler was eased into a secondary role, providing ideas for stories that would be translated by other writers, in this case Gerry Davis.\n\nAs its name suggests, The Tomb of the Cybermen owes considerable debt to the mummy genre of horror stories, with the Cybermen standing in for the traditional mysterious Egyptian sorcerer. But the Cybermen’s status as symbols of Communist Russia is still present – the team investigating the Cybermen tombs has, inevitably, been infiltrated by traitors who are seeking to awaken the Cybermen for their own purposes, and, predictably, the treacherous members of the team are also the ones who are played as generically “foreign” characters. Of particularly tasteless note is Toberman, a mute strongman who, played by the black actor Roy Stewart, became a crass racial stereotype.\n\nMore broadly, the story fit into a formula that Lloyd and Davis had developed over the course of the third and fourth production blocks – what is generally referred to as “base under siege” stories. The first of these stories was, in fact, Hartnell’s finale, The Tenth Planet, which featured the Cybermen attacking an Antarctic base. The basic setup of the stories was by and large dictated by the practical realities of Doctor Who’s production. Although at least sometimes in better studios than the cramped Lime Grove Studio D that the program had started in back in 1963, the production, although technically ambitious for the time, was limited in what it could do. A given story could afford production on one large-ish set and a couple very bare bones sets. Innes Lloyd hit on a fairly sensible way to utilize this: use the larger set as a big central location, and then create some corridors to suggest a larger building around the main set. Then, since a handful of monster costumes was all that could usually be afforded, a small group of monsters could attempt to attack the characters, slowly advancing through the corridors as the Doctor and company worked to force them back, until an eventual climax in which the monsters breach the main room before being defeated utterly.\n\nTomb of the Cybermen modified the formula in a several ways. For one thing, it stretched the budget to get two impressive sets – the antechamber of the Cybermen’s icy tomb and a larger basement chamber in which the Cybermen lay in suspended animation until an iconic and memorable sequence of the Cybermen awakening and fighting their way out of their tombs en masse provided the second episode’s climax. This also meant that it was not, as with most of the base under siege stories, a story about a remote location attacked by a small number of monsters. Instead the humans have come looking for monsters. Nevertheless, the same basic dynamic drives the plot: the humans are in one room, the monsters in the other, and the monsters want to break in.\n\nBut perhaps most important to Tomb of the Cybermen was its leading man, Patrick Troughton, who by this time had settled into his role and was routinely turning out top drawer performances. Troughton approached scenes methodically and idiosyncratically, starting not with learning his lines but with developing a sense of the scene’s pace and what the Doctor was doing in it, and then finally learning his lines perfectly once he’d already developed the tone with which he’d deliver them. The result was that his Doctor flitted around the edges of scenes, rarely taking center stage, but always being active and dynamic. Troughton’s versatility allowed him to switch tones within his performance quickly and decisively, going from a genially paternal figure to a steely determination seemingly instantly. Tomb of the Cybermen sees him using this skill to great effect, cheerily and curiously peppering people with questions from the edges of a scene and then angrily harden once he’s lured his interlocutor into saying more than they intended. Close examination of the script for Tomb of the Cybermen reveals that the Doctor’s actual motives are hazily defined at best – he helps open the Cybermen tomb and exposes everyone to danger supposedly to stop the villains from getting access to the tomb, raising the obvious question of why he didn’t let them just fail to get into it in the first place. But whatever holes the script might have are thoroughly papered over by Troghton’s charismatic and mercurial performance, which utterly convinces the viewer that the Doctor must have some sort of sensible plan, even if the story itself gives little evidence of this.\n\nWhatever its flaws in hindsight, however, Tomb of the Cybermen was a roaring success at the time, and it was decided that Bryant would take over three stories into the fifth production block.\n\nThese final three stories of Innes Lloyd’s tenure were, unsurprisingly, mostly bases under siege. The first, The Abominable Snowmen, was by far the most fanciful yet, featured robotic yeti attacking a Buddhist monastery, while the second was in many ways the most obvious iteration of the formula possible, featuring the eponymous Ice Warriors: reptilian monsters from Mars attacking a futuristic base. However Innes Lloyd’s final story, The Enemy of the World, saw David Whitaker return with an altogether more mature conspiracy thriller in which Patrick Troughton played both the Doctor and the villainous Salamander, giving him a chance to show the range of his acting and, perhaps more importantly, to give him a functional break in the midst of the busy schedule to try his hand at something else.\n\nBryant’s tenure continued with three further bases under siege, all fairly faithful iterations of the format: Cybermen attacking a space station, sentient seaweed attacking a natural gas platform, and, for the first of them, The Web of Fear, the return of the robotic yeti from The Abominable Snowmen attacking the London Underground. This story, directed masterfully by Douglas Camfield, was a particular triumph of mood and lighting, with sets for the Underground tunnels so accurate that London Transport accused the program of filming illegally in the Underground. It was one of several Doctor Who stories to make a lasting impression, highlighting the effectiveness of the base under siege format. Nevertheless, the fact remained that six of the seven stories in Doctor Who’s fifth season follow the same basic formula. No matter how good the formula, this risked tedium, and was a stark contrast to the psychedelic inventiveness that had characterized the previous production block.\n\nBut this transformation was mirrored beyond the episodes of one science fiction television program. Beyond the scope of Doctor Who, the optimistic counterculture of the 1960s was giving way to an altogether more paranoid mood. Where the summer of 1967 was dominated by the image of the Summer of Love in San Francisco, 1968 was a far more ambiguous and ultimately sour experience. In May of 1968, while Doctor Who aired The Wheel in Space, featuring David Whitaker frantically trying to spin something interesting out of yet another base under siege featuring the Cybermen, France was gripped by a massive uprising of students and workers headed up in a large part by the Marxist radical group the Situationist Internationale. The strikes were so effective that Charles de Gaulle fled the country, and nearly succeeded in bringing down his government. But this utopian peak was quickly followed by a brutal collapse as de Gaulle called an election for June that he won decisively with a law and order campaign. Similarly, int he United States, the waves of antiwar protesters that arrived for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago were met by a brutal police crackdown, and the Democrats’ choice of Hubert Humphrey, outgoing President Lyndon Johnson’s Vice President and thus heavily associated with the Vietnam War, cemented their defeat. The ensuing backlash against the left saw Richard Nixon win the Presidency, a final insult to top a year of catastrophic failure for the radical left.\n\nIn this regard, Doctor Who’s transition is wholly fitting. If the early days of Troughton were a perfect fit for the psychedelic aesthetic, the base under siege is an ideal story for the more paranoid embers of the 1960s. Its central metaphor is one of paranoia over the line between the outside and the inside. The base contains the good humans, and the bad aliens are constantly trying to break in, infiltrating it with spies, picking people off one by one, and otherwise ratcheting up the paranoia and tension. Every base under siege is, in its own way, a Cold War metaphor, but perhaps the most iconic of the fifth season is The Web of Fear, in which the alien invasion hits London itself, lurking around in the Underground, slowly taking over, while a band of soldiers with a traitor among them tries to stop it. But all of the bases under siege had their own sense of the paranoid infiltration. And for all that it was generic, it worked – the fifth season was the most popular of Troughton’s three season tenure, and provided iconic television images for a generation of children. Much of this was down to Troughton’s performance, which was often carefully tailored to children, with Troughton playing a sort of whimsical uncle leading the children at home through an adventure. The high point of this actually came in trailers for The Web of Fear, in which Troughton, in character, warned children that next week’s episode was going to be very scary and that they might need to reassure their parents that it will all be OK.\n\nWhere previous production blocks had held back one story for transmission with the next production block, the fifth production block closed with two, which would open the sixth season of Doctor Who, and between them almost perfectly capture the strange dualism of the Troughton era. The first was The Dominators, by the same pair who had created the two Yeti stories for Season Five. Truncated to five episodes and sent out under pen names after the writers fell out with Peter Bryant and his new script editor/second in command Derrick Sherwin, the story was a crass parable about the supposed moral failings of pacifism in which even Patrick Troughton, who had previously been able to salvage even the most dire of material, visibly gives up even trying to make it look good.\n\nThe other, however, was The Mind Robber, which may be Doctor Who’s most direct engagement with psychedelia. The story featured the TARDIS being pulled into another dimension: the Land of Fiction, where characters from literature and television come from. Originally planned as a four parter, the story was expanded to five parts with a sparse and avant garde first episode set mostly in an empty white void. From there the Doctor and his companions found themselves matching wits with Lemuel Gulliver, encountering the futuristic sci-fi hero the Karkus, and matching wits with the Master of the Land of Fiction, a burnt out pulp writer. Throughout their adventures the danger looms that they’ll be trapped in the Land of Fiction and become fictional characters themselves, a strangely meta textual and complex threat. The story was Doctor Who’s long overdue nod to the literary tradition of children’s adventure fiction that it hails from, but one that was just as in touch with the aesthetic appropriation of Lewis Carroll and children’s fiction by psychedelia. At one point Jamie loses his face and the Doctor errs in putting it back together, leading to Jamie being played by a different actor for one week (in reality Frazer Hines got the chicken pox).\n\nFor all that Troughton enjoyed this final and more literary story, he was frustrated by the scripts and growing restless. Troughton kept unusually busy for an actor in order to afford the financial burden of supporting two separate families, and was mindful that he risked typecasting if he stayed in one role for too long. Beyond that, the schedule was sufficiently punishing that he hardly had time to see the families. Accordingly, he decided in August of 1968 that he would depart the series after the sixth production block.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Bryant and Derrick Sherwin were thinking actively about how best to reinvigorate the program. The Web of Fear had been a particular success, and so they decided to try another story about aliens invading contemporary Earth, bringing back the Cybermen once again to do the job. Budgetary restrictions forced them to save money by doing fewer stories with longer episode counts, and so this ended up being an eight part epic in which the Cybermen allied with a wealthy electronics magnate to try to invade the Earth, with the Doctor once again teaming up with the military to stop them. To strengthen the connection with The Web of Fear the leader of the soldiers in that story, Colonel Lethbridge Stewart, was brought back and given a promotion to Brigadier. Behind the scenes, the story was a trial run for a more radical reconception the series that would take advantage of both Troughton’s departure and the BBC’s forthcoming transition to colour television for what would effectively be a complete reboot of the series.\n\nExtended to eight episodes due to problems with other scripts, the story lived up to its startlingly confident and singular title: The Invasion. In this regard, however, the story departed significantly from its source material. It was conceived of as a sequel to and remake of The Web of Fear, and while the underlying concepts of that story are still present, there’s been a slight but significant shift. The Invasion is in many ways structured like the base-under-siege stories that dominated the fifth production block, but instead of a claustrophobic story about aliens scratching around the edges of a tiny set of rooms the action is expansive, jumping all around London. Douglas Camfield, returning to direct again, clearly relishes in the story’s sense of scale and turns out a slick and confident techno-thriller perfected a villainous star turn by Kevin Stoney as Tobias Vaughan, the ruthless businessman with whom the Cybermen have allied.\n\nAs was by this point the norm for Cybermen stories, Kid Pedler provided some story ideas, which were very loosely adapted by someone else, in this case Derrick Sherwin himself. This left him busy, and his newly hired assistant, Terrance Dicks, found himself quickly promoted to where he was left to edit the next story solo. That story, The Krotons, was by a newcomer named Robert Holmes, who spun a four part story that provided the Troughton era with its most literal engagement with psychedelia, as the Doctor meets a bunch of oppressed students and teaches them how to mix up an acid that will overthrow their cruel alien masters, who try to fill their heads with useless facts and keep them from understanding the way the world really works. But instead of returning after it was done, Sherwin decided to start shadowing Peter Bryant with an eye towards taking over the series for the final story, by this point slated to feature the joint departure of Patrick Troughton, Frazer Hines, and the latest female companion, Wendy Padbury, who played Zoe Heriot, a futuristic girl genius, and to set up the new approach to the series, in which the Doctor would be stuck on Earth helping Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart with various threats. This left Dicks to handle the remainder of the production block: one last base under siege featuring the return of the Ice Warriors, in which Dicks rewrote four of the six episodes, another story by Robert Holmes that capitalized on the heavy popular interest in space travel generated by the imminent American moon landing, and the season finale itself, which Dicks ended up co-authoring with Malcolm Hulke, who had previously co-authored The Faceless Ones for Troughton’s first season.\n\nAt ten episodes The War Games is the second longest Doctor Who story in the program’s history, outdone only by the twelve episode The Daleks’ Masterplan from the third season. But where that story felt like an exercise in wringing every last drop of spectacle out of the Daleks, The War Games earns its scope with a sweeping plot that serves as the definitive commentary on the Troughton era’s engagements with the culture of the late 1960s. Its two writers serve as a nearly perfect balance between the two competing impulses of the era. On the one hand is Terrance Dicks, a classical liberal who has suggested that on balance the British Empire was a good thing and expressed profound skepticism towards revolutionaries and utopian ideologies. On the other is Malcolm Hulke, a committed Marxist whose later stories will drip with criticism of imperialism, exploitative labor relations, and the entire idea of returning to some nostalgia-tinged vision of past glory.\n\nAt first the story appears to be a return to the abandoned historical genre, set this time in World War I, but over the first few episodes it becomes increasingly clear that something is very wrong until, in a sublime second episode cliffhanger, the Doctor and his companions pass through some mist and discover that they’ve gone from the First World War to Ancient Rome. It turns out that someone has been kidnapping human soldiers from across history and forcing them to fight each other as part of a grotesque and elaborate game that the Doctor, obviously, vows to put a stop to. But ultimately the Doctor finds himself overwhelmed by the situation. Even though he manages to stop the evil War Lord behind the experiments, he realizes that he cannot possibly return everybody to their correct time on his own, and that he must contact his own people for help.\n\nThis ending, in which Troughton’s mercurial and psychedelic Doctor runs aground in the face of the complexities of the real world, is a fitting end to the 1960s for Doctor Who. It was, after all, upon the rocky shores of real-world politics that the utopian ideals that gave the early Troughton era such potency finally ran aground. The sight of the Doctor running into a situation grounded firmly in human experience and history and being unable to fix it is a potent and timely one. But the story is equally critical of the base under siege structure that made up so much of the Troughton era. Much of the middle of the story is in effect a base under siege in reverse, with the Doctor and his companions taking the role usually given to the monsters, scraping around the edges of the base from which the War Lord and his minions are masterminding the cruel games. The result is just as much a commentary on the paranoid nature of that genre, moving the Doctor from being a figure of the establishment to being a proper outsider.\n\nAnd in the course of all of this the Doctor, after six seasons of mystery, finally gets an origin story: he is apparently a Time Lord who went on the run from his own people, and who is ultimately charged with violating his people’s rule of non-interference. And after an impassioned defense of his actions on the grounds that he was fighting real evil in the universe, the Doctor is sentenced to exile for his crimes. His companions are taken away from him and returned to their own times, his TARDIS is disabled, his face is changed once more, and he’s confined to Earth, setting the stage for Bryant and Sherwin’s reinvention of the series.\n\nIn practice, this was well-timed; ratings slumped badly over the course of the sixth season, with The War Games pulling dire ratings – only five million people watched Troughton’s last bow as the Doctor, and the eighth episode of the serial pulled the second-lowest ratings of the program’s entire fifty year history. Indeed, it was only out of a combination of not having an obvious replacement and the fact that the series was already slated to heavily retool itself that the program survived into a seventh season. Like Troughton’s Doctor, and indeed the psychedelic counterculture he so embodied, the program was going to have to find a new approach to the world.\n\nDr. Marx looked up from Baron Brougham’s Colonial Policy, took a swig of the musty air of the British Library, and waited for his blood to cool a little. He shifted himself slightly in his chair in an attempt to take the weight off his carbuncles, suddenly aware of the comparative meagreness of the pain they gave him. For a moment, he imagined the shelves of the great circular room filled not with books but rather with wretched men and women in chains, packed in as tightly as could be. They seemed to stare at him. He shook his biblically bewhiskered head as if to free himself of this horrid vision, and surveyed the people who were really there. Rows of backs hunched over desks, a crowd of noses buried in paper, an orchestra of pencils scribbling away in notebooks, and an army of feet padding carefully down walkways, sending up little clouds of dust with every step.\n\nThere was Karswell, hanging around as ever, glum and twitchy and seething, trying to trick people into accepting his accursed little symbol-covered paper notes, which – if you believed the man – were capable of bringing ruin to their possessors through some occult power over human destiny.\n\nThere was Whateley, the goatish monstrosity! Dr. Marx watched the man’s disturbingly large pores sweating what looked like ichor as he feverishly hunted through one of the more obscure and sinister old catalogues.\n\nThere was that old fraud Maxtible, ferreting around in the medieval esoterica, as always. Dr. Marx knew what he was after. The fool imagined himself a student of the alchemical arts, and dreamed of recovering what he called “the secret”. “Metal into gold!” Maxtible had once bellowed semi-coherently into Dr. Marx’s face after button-holing him outside the library. He’d evidently imagined that he and Dr. Marx might have similar interests… possibly, Dr. Marx reflected, because of their similar taste in facial hair. Dr. Marx had gone along with the old turd for a while, and got a few free drinks out of it at the Alpha. Maxtible had passed out – Dr. Marx never having doubted that he’d be able to drink the man under the table – and Dr. Marx had ended up having a very pleasant chat about geese with the landlord Windigate, an amiable drunk called Baker, and some fellows called Bernard and Bacon.\n\nThe irony was, of course, that Maxtible and Dr. Marx were interested in similar things. Indeed, Dr. Marx knew very well how metal (or anything else) got itself transformed into gold. And the answer wasn’t to be found in the literature of the middle ages, but rather in the factories of the present epoch. And it was an occult thing only insofar as it was carefully hidden. But Dr. Marx wasn’t telling Maxtible. The man was a bourgeois through and through. And Dr. Marx hadn’t liked the little shock of static electricity he’d received from the man’s handshake.\n\nAnd there was that mad woman, leaning against the wall below the ornate thermometer… the one who just called herself ‘the Doctor’. The Doctor indeed! Dr. Marx was doubtful that she had any actual academic standing at all. Dr. Marx had memories of slogging through Democritus and Epicurus to earn his doctorate. He resented people who just declared themselves Doctors without putting in the sheer reading involved. After all, wasn’t it labour that was the source of value? Of course, the Doctor had once claimed to Dr. Marx (or ‘Charlie-boy’, as she had insisted on calling him) to have actually met Democritus and Epicurus, and given them both all their ideas… but then that had been said during a pub crawl with Liebknecht. And a decent fellow doesn’t hold a person responsible for things said on a pub crawl.\n\nThe Doctor looked up from her reading material – it seemed to be some kind of printed story about Guy Fawkes, comprised of little pictures and captions – and caught Dr. Marx’s eye. They exchanged nods.\n\nAnd then there was that young American fellow… what was he called? Sandford? Sandilands? Something like that. Another impoverished scholar, like Dr. Marx himself. The world should value and reward its scholars, thought Dr. Marx… not for the first time. Sanderton – or whatever his name was – was engaged in something he called a ‘psychochronography’. Dr. Marx had no idea what a ‘psychochronography’ might be, but he found the word intriguing. He momentarily caught himself longing for twenty lifetimes so that he could finish his own chosen project and have time to write his book about Balzac. If he had such a surplus of time, he’d allocate some of it to investigating ‘psychochronography’. But, of course, as it was…\n\nSighing, feeling his carbuncles ache again (and vowing that the bourgeoisie would have cause to remember them) he returned his attention to Brougham, and to the English East Indies, whe"
