        "text": "Blackadder:\n\nAnd here is a front page of Macbeth, signed by William Shakespeare himself.\n\nLady Elizabeth:\n\nDarling:\n\nWho?\n\nMelchett:\n\nOh, come on, you know this... he's the fellow who invented the ball-point pen.\n\nGeorge:\n\nWell you certainly won the bet, Blackadder. Here's your 10,000 francs...\n\nBlackadder:\n\nWhat do you mean, \"francs?\"\n\nGeorge:\n\nWhat do you mean \"What do I mean, 'francs'?\"\n\nDarling:\n\nWe've been using francs for over 200 years.\n\nMelchett:\n\nYes, ever since Wellington lost the battle of Waterloo.\n\nBaldrick:\n\nYou know how when you're drowning, and your life flashes in front of your eyes? Well, what I was thinking is that you could dunk your head in a bucket of water and if you held it down till just before you died, you could see how the levers were and get us home.\n\nBlackadder:\n\nExcellent plan, Baldrick, with perhaps one slight modification...\n\nBaldrick:\n\nI'm 18, I've just left Nursery School. I'm 25, I'm back in Nursery School.\n\nBlackadder:\n\nYou really are as thick as clotted cream, that's been left out by some clot, and now the clots are so clotted, you couldn't unclot them with an electric de-clotter, aren't you, Baldrick?\n\nBlackadder:\n\nMay I present to you, the greatest breakthrough in travel since Sir Rodney Tricycle thought to himself, \"I'm bored of walking. I think I'll invent something with three wheels and a bell, and name it after myself\": the time machine."
