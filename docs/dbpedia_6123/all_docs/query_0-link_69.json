        "text": "And now comes the point at which I really, really start wanting to reach back in time and strangle my younger self for impulsive decisions made in the heat of the moment. The Year in Review post, as you’ll probably know if you’ve been around these parts for long enough, is effectively an enshrined and state-mandated Dale’s Ramblings tradition at this point.\n\nBut, like many a public holiday before it, it’s also a tradition that has now squarely reached the most controversial part of its lifecycle, only without the typical undercurrents of “I want to engage in an uncritical celebration of the country in which I live without being made to think about what is probably a rather violent and messed-up colonial past” that usually accompany such debates.\n\nNo, the problem here is altogether simpler and considerably less charged: There’s just a lot more books now than there were in 1992. Even disqualifying the short story anthologies, as I habitually do, 1997 contains a grand total of twenty-eight books to rank, a far cry from the six that we had to contend with back when the NAs were still being published bimonthly.\n\nMore than that, the transfer of Virgin’s mandate as the producer of novel-length original fiction based on Doctor Who, and our own decision to continue reviewing those NAs which feature the continuing adventures of legally permissible protagonist Bernice Summerfield, leaves us in a position where this already considerable tally of books is spread across four separate ranges. Consequently, we effectively need to construct four separate lists to best account for the differing standards that apply to each line, and in the words of one Amelia Jessica Pond, this is where it gets complicated.\n\nBut, with all of that being said, 1997 was a year that was rarely anything short of fascinating, even as it turned out several novels that were very short from being good, and I do believe the extra workload is broadly worthwhile. Before we can give ourselves enough time to ponder whether that’s just the result of an impressive capacity for self-delusion on my part, however, I say we get this show on the road, and start things off the way we always have done, by jumping straight into…\n\nThe New Adventures\n\n12. Mean Streets by Terrance Dicks\n\nWe begin with a placement that might seem a trifle odd for those of you who happened to catch my original review a few weeks back, in which I was generally pretty positively disposed towards the novel even as I acknowledged some very substantial faults with its general moral and political framework. Indeed, I myself dithered for some considerable time over which book should take the bottom spot here, and the fact that I settled on a book like Mean Streets should only really be taken as a reliable indicator of the general lack of outright awful books turned out by Virgin this year.\n\nPerhaps it’s just a matter of comparison to BBC Books, which hit the ground stumbling with the one-two punch of The Eight Doctors and War of the Daleks in such rapid succession that Virgin could have turned out anything short of a few scraps of aged and illegible vellum and still have been said to have emerged the unambiguous victors of 1997. Perhaps a book series that has spent six years honing a consistent “house style” – in a way that the BBC novels, to spoil the next eight years’ worth of reviews, never really end up managing – is just given a rather large lead over a fledgling set of books, even allowing for the unprecedented challenge of kicking the Doctor out of the picture. We may never truly know.\n\nWhat can be pretty reliably stated, though, is that Mean Streets is not a bad book in the conventional sense. It’s eminently readable, doesn’t have too many moments of ill-advised continuity worship or downright retch-inducing Boys’ Club sexism courtesy of Uncle Terrance, and is largely a pleasant enough way to fill a few hours when you get down to it. By the same token, though, it’s not exactly aiming to push the Wilderness Years forward whether you approach it as a Bernice Summerfield novel or as a de facto Doctor Who novel that has the misfortune of being written under a particularly restrictive set of legal constraints.\n\nBy and large, this is the New Adventure in 1997 which seems to be most clueless as to what it actually wants to accomplish for either of those two interconnected worlds. Eternity Weeps is a standard spot of Mortimorean nihilism, yes, but it serves the clear purpose of establishing a post-divorce status quo for Benny. Dragons’ Wrath is conventional to the hilt, with a perfunctory enough plot that Justin Richards was right to propose it as a prime candidate for adaptation into a video game, but it sets down what a typical New New Adventure might look like.\n\nEven Deadfall improbably begins to metamorphose into a deliberately queered take on the “women in prison” genre of exploitation film, while also laying the groundwork for any number of more adventurous novels to come that would shift their focus onto a main character besides Bernice. Mean Streets, by contrast, is Terrance Dicks’ attempt to do a Raymond Chandler novel, but this is in actual fact just the exact same thing Dicks has been doing to one degree or another for almost three and a half years at this point, going all the way back to Blood Harvest.\n\nAnd yes, there’s a valid argument to be made that one should adjust their expectations when going into a book whose author has the single longest history with Doctor Who out of any of the names we’re going to be listing today. What’s more, Mean Streets remains light-years ahead of The Eight Doctors on any conceivable metric you might care to name.\n\nBut if that’s the dichotomy at work here, and we’re more than six years distant from the possibility of even getting a book on the level of Exodus, then it’s tough to construct an actual case for Dicks’ being continually commissioned that doesn’t require an appeal to an entirely valid but largely nebulous sense of residual goodwill from his titanic run on the Target novelisations.\n\nMean Streets is a decent book, but nothing more, and in a year when just about every other New Adventure was at least willing to entertain the possibility of “something more,” that simply isn’t good enough. Far from being the mean of the list, it ends up falling squarely at the minimum position.\n\n11. Eternity Weeps by Jim Mortimore\n\nAnd the surprises just keep on coming, at least from the precedent I’ve set of generally enjoying all of Jim Mortimore’s works to date, even the more universally slated ones like Parasite. In truth, I even enjoyed Eternity Weeps, as much as that verb can realistically be applied to a novel that closes with the wanton destruction of a tenth of the Earth’s population and the dissolution of a power couple whose wedding formed the crux of the NAs’ big fiftieth novel celebrations just eight months earlier.\n\nEven so, I’d be remiss if I didn’t admit that there’s something decidedly more stale and even distinctly cynical about Mortimore’s general schtick this time around. There are several components to this, the most obvious of which is the man’s general slide into conservative fearmongering since I last tackled one of his books all the way back in the not-so-halcyon days of April 2020. The only thing saving him from being consigned to the same void as Gareth Roberts, really, is that Mortimore at least has the decency to consign his nonsense to his personal Facebook page with all the rest of the disgruntled middle-aged white men.\n\n(Then again, one suspects that this merely reveals nothing but Mortimore’s sheer cultural irrelevance in 2024, which is probably the main factor preventing the Ghouls That Be at The Spectator from even attempting to tap him for a nationally published column on the evils of wokeness or whatever.)\n\nBut in a much broader sense, Eternity Weeps‘ initial publication in January 1997 saw Doctor Who in a very different place than it was just two years earlier when Mortimore released Parasite. Speaking with the benefit of hindsight, we can now look back on December 1994 as a point in time right before the New Adventures really started to consistently hit it out of the park with the dawn of 1995, and before the cautious optimism proffered by reports of the Paul McGann television movie could really start to steal Virgin’s limelight heading into 1996.\n\nIn 1994, in other words, the New Adventures were still on the cusp of exiting their experimental phase, even though they’d stuck around for three and a half years by the time of Parasite. This isn’t to say that they weren’t any good, because they were absolutely better and bolder than anyone had any right to expect of a set of tie-in novels based on a cancelled science fiction programme, but they hadn’t quite established a reasonable baseline of quality.\n\nThe upshot of that, as we saw, was a general spirit of vigorous experimentation as a generation of fans decided to try their hand at shepherding the franchise’s destiny, and it was a spirit into which Mortimore’s early works fit perfectly.\n\nYet the fact that Eternity Weeps feels so conspicuously antiquated in early 1997 is itself revealing. Where writers like Kate Orman and Paul Cornell have been steadily honing their impressive sets of skills so as to match their experimentation with the quality of being, y’know, actually good – and here the deck is slightly stacked in their favour, as Revelation and The Left-Handed Hummingbird are frankly far better debut novels than Lucifer Rising or Blood Heat could ever hope to be, much as I quite enjoy all four – Mortimore… well now, how do we end that sentence?\n\n“Isn’t” is the obvious answer, but it isn’t quite correct. Clearly somebody who’s still got a couple of widely acclaimed works like Eye of Heaven or The Natural History of Fear in their future catalogue can’t be entirely out to sea, even if the mercifully unpublished Campaign‘s “VR game based on Aristotelian philosophy” does come perilously close to suggesting otherwise.\n\nFor all of that, though, Eternity Weeps remains a profoundly ugly piece of work once you scratch off its action-packed veneer and start getting to such choices as its unapologetic and unnecessarily gruesome fridging of one of the most compelling and poorly-served companions in the programme’s history. Instead of starting off 1997 by putting their best foot forward, Virgin ironically ended up demonstrating the nastier aspects of nineties Doctor Who fandom that would keep it a rather insular cultural property for a while longer, to the point where it’s hard to seriously begrudge Russell T. Davies’ implicit disavowal of the novel come The Sarah Jane Adventures.\n\nIt’s certainly a more engrossing reading experience than Mean Streets, and Mortimore’s general competence as a wordsmith ensures that there are a few truly standout passages, but in the final summary one can’t help feeling that contemporary fans were largely correct to consider it the weakest link in the New Adventures’ otherwise sterling endgame.\n\n10. Deadfall by Gary Russell\n\nA novel which sidelines the New Adventures’ female lead in favour of a plot that was explicitly conceived of as “a Boys’ Own adventure… in space!” might reasonably fill some folks with a blind, unreasoning terror at just how awfully awry such efforts could go, particularly when taking the book’s byline into account.\n\nOn the basis of past form, Gary Russell’s tendency to have characters drop racial slurs as if they’re mere quaint colloquialisms would tend to suggest that we’re in for a world of hurt as regards his taking on a subgenre so inextricably linked to British colonial concerns. Coupled with his general inability to accomplish basic tasks like “knowing when the city of Baghdad was founded” and “making sure the datelines of his flashback sequences have the decimal point in the right place,” there was every chance that we’d get that most deadly of cocktails: a book that manages to be both incoherent and offensive in equal measure.\n\nAnd yet that isn’t what we got. I mean, it’s not as if we got a piece of fine art, but coming off of the back of Business Unusual it was positively merciful. Deadfall knows what it wants to be, and sets about constructing a broadly entertaining adventure yarn for established recurring players Jason and Emile, while also reintroducing Chris to the world of the NAs and maintaining a surprisingly cogent thematic throughline with a carefully considered queer reclamation of classic “women in prison” exploitation shows like Prisoner.\n\nWe’re still at that part of the list where our analysis will generally trend towards the superficial, purely on account of there not being all that much to work with, but the repeated emphasis on the potential monstrosity of unbound heteronormativity through the machinations of BABE and the uncomfortably sleazy possessiveness of Tolland is at least a sign that we might be starting to slowly transition out of that phase.\n\nBeyond thematic concerns, the character writing is also broadly solid, and even those cast members Russell only affords a fleeting chance to shine, from Braxiatel to Benny herself, do in fact reliably shine.\n\nIn short, Deadfall is almost enough to make one wish Russell would make engagements with the present of Doctor Who and its attendant spin-off series more frequently, but I suppose we’ll have to withhold judgment on the wisdom of that particular wish until after we’ve read Placebo Effect…\n\n9. Dragons’ Wrath by Justin Richards\n\nDragons’ Wrath is the first novel to really showcase Justin Richards in what will effectively become his default mode in the popular imagining, as a safe and workmanlike pair of hands who can be trusted not to do anything too grotesquely embarrassing with a given commission. It’s unlikely to rank as anyone’s favourite Benny novel, or even their favourite Benny novel to be written by Richards, but it manages to serve as a much better illustration of an average month for the retooled line than the wackiness of Oh No It Isn’t!\n\nThe novel manages to serve up just the right amount of thrills and twists to keep the reader on the hook while quietly introducing a number of concepts and characters that will prove to be considerably more influential going forward than the bulk of Cornell’s work, and making it look practically effortless to boot.\n\nImprobably, despite necessitating a ludicrously overwrought complication of Benny and Brax’s timelines in order to explain how they can interact with one another some fourteen hundred years before Theatre of War‘s apparent setting, Richards manages to prove deft enough at handling his own creation that any sense of confusion barely has time to register. Newer additions to the roster, like the perpetually chlorine-wreathed Divson Follett or the tea-loving Ice Warrior Commander Skutloid, also manage to hit just the right note of delightful eclecticism to be enjoyable, while the presence of the Knights of Jeneve serves to provide Benny’s adventures with a suitably large – and decidedly nineties-inflected – galactic canvas against which to unfold.\n\nDragons’ Wrath might be a book whose significance lies more in its contributions to the ongoing saga of the Benny novels than in telling a particularly transcendent adventure in its own right, but it makes these contributions with such sleek and unhurried confidence that it’s hard not to be entertained.\n\nIt’s a genuine shame that the awful, butchered Big Finish adaptation is the most readily accessible version for most fans nowadays, and I’d implore those who have only listened to the audio drama to give the original novel a read. More than any other book in that first season of Benny adaptations, this is one that has lost the most in the process of its translation, and despite its relatively low placing on this list, it deserves better than to be remembered in such a truncated and messy form.\n\n8. Oh No It Isn’t! by Paul Cornell\n\nAnd now we can set ourselves a floor for the portion of the list that I’d actively classify as “really very good indeed.” If it seems strange and borderline sacrilegious to cast perennial New Adventures icon Paul Cornell in this position, well, you’ve clearly never read Oh No It Isn’t! To call this Cornell’s weakest NA is a rather obvious critical judgment, as is the readily apparent follow-up proclamation that the man’s weakest still manages to outstrip so many lesser writers’ best.\n\nOf the six total New Adventures Cornell has contributed, after all, three of them remain incredibly influential classics that deserve to be mentioned in any remotely thorough history of the Wilderness Years. The remainder constitute an unexpectedly well-rounded conclusion to a poorly-defined story arc, a big gaudy celebration of the range reaching fifty instalments, and this, a big gaudy celebration of the eccentric British tradition of pantomime.\n\nBut we should be careful in our definition here. To suggest that Oh No It Isn’t! is the weakest of Cornell’s NAs is not tantamount to a suggestion that the subject of pantomime is inherently less worthwhile than that of Virgin’s strange and spiky continuity. (Oh yes it is! Sorry.)\n\nThe problems with Oh No It Isn’t!, if they can be called that, are almost entirely down to the fact that Cornell was, at least ostensibly, very loudly and publicly proclaiming himself to be done with Doctor Who and Bernice Summerfield. This is plainly a chance for one of the range’s most acclaimed writers to do something completely oddball and screwy, written while he has one foot out the door so that he can go and do more respectable fare like writing for Coronation Street or that Queer as Folk spin-off that never got made.\n\nThat it’s as good as it is, frankly, just goes to show what a treasure Cornell was all this time, and entirely justifies Virgin’s decision to respond to the “Planet of the Panto People” brief with anything other than a snort of derision and a flat “no,” which one imagines would have been the reaction had it been anyone else. That this latest loud and public proclamation of Cornell’s impending departure proved to have just as much staying power as it did on every other occasion in the past and the future – i.e. none; recall that Human Nature was originally supposed to be his last NA, as was Happy Endings – merely adds to the general comedy of proceedings.\n\nAnd make no mistake, Oh No It Isn’t! is very funny. Yes, it mixes in the usual smatterings of Cornell pathos that we’ve come to love in amongst that humour, perfectly mining everything you’d expect “Paul Cornell’s last NA” to be in its examination of the relationship between Benny and a newly anthropomorphised Wolsey, but it’s the madcap, irrepressible sense of humour that ends up sticking with you the longest, even if, like me, you’ve never been to a single panto show in your life.\n\nSo no, Oh No It Isn’t! isn’t a Who-redefining classic, nor is it even a Doctor Who book at all, but it is a great deal of fun. Few writers can claim to turn out one definitive classic, let alone three of them in near consecutive fashion, and it seems churlish to complain that a man who managed just that didn’t slide in a fourth as he was leaving. Getting a Paul Cornell book that’s “just” a gleeful celebration of whatever quirky bits of British culture take his fancy in a given month still surpasses so many of the alternatives.\n\nAt least four, to be precise.\n\n7. Ghost Devices by Simon Bucher-Jones\n\nOne ultimately can’t help but feel a little sorry for Ghost Devices, surrounded as it is by one of the most aggressively conventional periods in the New Adventures’ history outside of their extremely rocky beginnings. As if that wasn’t bad enough, it also happened to drop right as the Eighth Doctor Adventures landed their own equivalent of Cornell’s Revelation in the form of Alien Bodies, a set of circumstances which – coupled with Gary Gillatt and Alan Barnes’ temporary banishment of the Benny novels from Doctor Who Magazine‘s Shelf Life feature – inevitably conspired to divert practically all the attention away from the sophomore offering by The Death of Art writer Simon Bucher-Jones.\n\nAlien Bodies, of course, is very good, and its eventual ranking among the year’s EDAs will probably surprise absolutely nobody, but the fact that it came to so thoroughly monopolise fandom’s attention throughout the month of November 1997 is something of a shame, given just how entertaining and inventive Ghost Devices manages to be in its own right.\n\nIt’s almost hard to believe that this high concept tale, shot through with a razor sharp wit, came from the word processor of the writer who previously offered us the ponderous, psi-powered Parisian melodrama of The Death of Art barely a year earlier. It would be overly neat to suggest that Ghost Devices fulfils the promise of the hypothetical “good book somewhere at the heart of The Death of Art” that I mentioned last time, but it’s also not a million miles removed from the truth of the matter either.\n\nAlthough grasping the slew of temporal paradoxes that is the Vo’lach civilisation is probably not all that simpler a task, on paper, than comprehending the machinations of the Brotherhood, the Family and the Shadow Directory, there’s a lyrical elegance to the central MacGuffin of the Spire that manages to cut through all the talk of tachyons to make a certain kind of intuitive sense on a deeper and murkier level than is generally allowed for under the auspices of pure logic.\n\nAs New Adventures go, it’s proof positive that the EDAs were never the only game in town when it comes to being willing to think big in their science fiction conceits, and the fact that Bucher-Jones would go on to be a key contributor to the world of Faction Paradox through works like The Taking of Planet 5 and The Book of the War makes a great deal of sense.\n\nIf Ghost Devices had dropped even one month earlier, it would almost certainly have absolutely wiped the floor with a novel like War of the Daleks. But as it stands what we have here is, appropriately enough, a vast relic that draws the mind down all manner of crazed “What if?” theories, the possibilities of what might have been now quietly withered to dust with the unrelenting passage of time. Or something. I dunno, the point is, it’s a weird one, but I still consider it to be a bit of an overlooked gem. As most weird books are, really.\n\n6. Beyond the Sun by Matthew Jones\n\nOnce more, we find ourselves faced with a case of a writer improving considerably on their second go at the bat. Fortunately for Beyond the Sun, Matt Jones is starting with a fairly sizeable advantage over Simon Bucher-Jones here in that Bad Therapy was frankly light-years ahead of The Death of Art to begin with.\n\nAs far as the less outlandish and experimental side of the Benny novels is concerned, eight books in, this is easily the pinnacle of the form. It’s a much more traditional science fiction adventure novel than its two direct successors, to the point where the structure of its central fictional society is largely just a lift of Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Dispossessed.\n\n(Then again, if we can love The Also People in spite of Ben Aaronovitch’s unapologetically plundering the works of Iain M. Banks, there is no reason we ought to consider an equally frank riff on Le Guin to be a dealbreaker. And Jones is, indeed, very candid about what he’s doing, most obviously in the naming of the Ursulans.)\n\nThe events of Beyond the Sun may be pretty straightforward on a basic plotting level, but Jones’ writing is ultimately a testament to how even the simplest of adventure yarns can really sing in the right pair of hands. It’s not that Beyond the Sun is necessarily an outright “dark” book per se, but it’s certainly suffused with a strangely haunting, funereal atmosphere that makes for a stark contrast to the generally peppy and sardonic tone the Benny novels usually opt for.\n\nEven this is probably overstating the case, however. At the end of the day, this is still a book in which Benny, Emile and Tameka manage to sneak into the base of a bunch of colonialist fascists with an assist from a flamboyant, disco-flavoured drag cabaret act. There’s always moments of glorious camp excess in amongst the darkness.\n\nIn this regard, even if it probably can’t lay claim to being the absolute best novel of 1997, it might just be one of the most important, nodding as it does towards the delicate balancing act of hedonism in the face of despair that Jones will shortly prove instrumental in cultivating alongside Russell T. Davies in his capacity as script editor on Queer as Folk. Even as the Wilderness Years are about to take a headlong dive into the snarled tangle of conceptual madness and, frankly, irrelevance, the seeds of the revival are being laid here, all the way down to the novel’s plot having more than a hint of The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit about it.\n\nReally, though, we don’t even have to reach for an “importance to the franchise” argument here, as Beyond the Sun is a perfectly solid book in its own right. The first extended grappling with Benny’s complicated feelings for Jason in the wake of their messy divorce works wonderfully, and there’s a certain subversive pleasure to be taken in gender-swapping the role of the traditional “damsel in distress” in such a manner. Emile builds on the success of the queer representation in Damaged Goods and Bad Therapy to present a compelling new addition to the recurring cast, and even Tameka – largely destined to be completely forgotten about by the NAs after a brief cameo appearance in Deadfall – is sketched with sufficient finesse to make you wish that subsequent novels had done more with her.\n\nIn any event, Beyond the Sun stands as an early success for the Benny novels, and even if Jones moves on to bigger and better things after this – barring one last Second Doctor story for next year’s inaugural Short Trips anthology – he managed to cement himself as one of the strongest novelists of the Wilderness Years in a phenomenally short span of time.\n\n5. Lungbarrow by Marc Platt\n\nOh alright, I know that putting this one as high as I have is just asking for controversy even before I’ve said anything, but dammit, I enjoyed it. Do I think that its “lore revelations” need to be elevated to the status of “official canon” and that every conversation about the Time Lords in the New Series should have included a minimum of 7.3 mentions of Looms every minute? No, of course not. Was John Nathan-Turner right to veto the plans to make this in place of Ghost Light? Yes, absolutely; this is the kind of story that can really only be excused by its status as the last New Adventure to feature the Seventh Doctor, and in any event a course of action that deprives the world of a story like Ghost Light is, quite simply, never going to fly with me.\n\nBut frankly, the fact that every single discussion of Lungbarrow devolves into a dissertation on its ramifications for “the lore” or whatever becomes, quite simply, exhausting at a certain point. The ramifications of Looms or the Pythia on the larger lore of the Time Lords has been and will probably always be zero, based not on any subjective sense of merit to those concepts, but rather the basic reality of what Lungbarrow is: a novel which most reasonable, well-adjusted members of the general public – so, nobody who reads this blog then – have long since forgotten about, and probably never even knew existed in the first place.\n\nThis is a novel which basically cannot be legally acquired anymore without paying exorbitant sums of money that are several orders of magnitude greater than its RRP, not a cent of which goes back to the original author or publisher anyway, and there’s really a debate as to whether its reveals should matter? I mean hey, why don’t we just debate the merits of the Palladin Hordes while we’re at it?\n\n(I, of course, did just that in my original review, but we’re already approaching 5000 words for this alleged summary post so clearly I’ve got something screwy going on in my brain.)\n\nIn fact, if you were going to do a big show-stopping event novel about the Doctor’s origins and the founding of Gallifreyan society – and the nature of the Wilderness Years meant that somebody was going to, particularly when fans had been salivating over the knowledge that there existed an abandoned script just lying around to complete the supposed “Cartmel Masterplan” – this is probably the best way to do it, with a writer like Marc Platt who has a sufficient grasp of ambiguity and nuance to present the “facts” in an interesting way. We can say this is, at least, not the worst way to do it, since The Timeless Children exists and is, in fact, worse in just about every conceivable way.\n\nMaybe I’m just a sucker for this kind of messed-up Gormenghast Victorian fantasy aesthetic, or maybe I’m just deluding myself into thinking I got a satisfying ending to the New Adventures after spending five years on the damn things, but I generally had a good time with Lungbarrow.\n\nAnd speaking of ending the New Adventures…\n\n4. The Dying Days by Lance Parkin\n\nBy its very nature, The Dying Days is an odd thing. Caught as it is between the departure of the Seventh Doctor at the end of Lungbarrow and the ascension of Benny to the role of the NAs’ chief protagonist in Oh No It Isn’t!, it’s largely a book that feels as if it lacks an era.\n\nIndeed, even though it features the Eighth Doctor in his first post-TV movie adventure outside of the Doctor Who Magazine comics, it even feels slightly wrong to try lumping it in with the subsequent EDAs, as the character’s presence is largely just used as a symbolic signifier of the NAs’ having changed with the passage of time. The focus here is squarely on Benny’s being pushed into the role of main character, complete with an extended passage in which Parkin teases the possibility that he might have killed off the Doctor in exactly the way he was rumoured to have done in the lead-up to the novel.\n\nPerhaps the cruellest irony of all, then, is that an adventure that practically throws up its hands and admits that there’s nothing for it but to write Eight in a consciously genericised fashion should still be so much more entertaining than BBC Books’ eventual attempt at debuting the character in The Eight Doctors.\n\nSome of my own personal enjoyment can surely be put down to the general goodwill that Virgin have accrued with me over the past sixty NAs, but there’s still an essential difference between Parkin and Dicks on this score. The Dying Days‘ portrait of Eight may be generic as all get out, and a far cry from Vampire Science, but the character does at least get to do archetypally Doctor-y things rather than passively react to a bunch of continuity references while wandering around in a dazed, amnesiac state.\n\nAnd despite the self-consciously broad nature of the plot, there are moments of real beauty and enjoyment to be found in equal measure, from the Doctor’s risking his life for the sake of an imperilled house cat all the way through to the supremely cheeky implied sex scene at the close of the novel.\n\nThe Dying Days was never going to be the deepest of novels, but to complain about that almost misses the point. Like I said in my original review, this is first and foremost a victory lap designed with a view towards ushering in a new era of the Wilderness Years and the transition of Virgin’s flagship Doctor Who series into a line built around one of their most popular companions. Taken on those terms, it’s a resounding success, and a perfect final bow for a series that brought us so much.\n\n3. Down by Lawrence Miles\n\nIf Ghost Devices was a novel that saw itself dwarfed by the shadow of Alien Bodies, then Down‘s finding itself consigned to a similar fate feels even more ironic. A snapshot of the last moment in time at which Lawrence Miles was just another eccentric curio in the line-up of Wilderness Years authors, just two months before he cemented himself as one of the era’s leading lights, it’s difficult to avoid having one’s perceptions coloured by hindsight here.\n\nIt helps, of course, that Down is a very good novel on its own terms. After a four-month period which saw the retooled New Adventures establishing the particulars of Bernice’s world, capped with a piece of subversive Dave Stone weirdness, Miles promptly picks up that baton and runs with it all the way to the finish line.\n\nIts central argument is, in many ways, arguably just a more elaborate formulation of the thesis that lurked around the edges of Christmas on a Rational Planet, and the creeping sense that Miles is significantly more comfortable playing in the wheelhouse of science fantasy than straightforward science fiction. In terms of understanding the man’s usual thematic preoccupations and his perspective on Doctor Who, Down might improbably manage to be an even more useful text than Alien Bodies itself, particularly when paired with the musings contained in The Judgement of Solomon, published in the same month.\n\nThe flipside of this is that it becomes hard to really describe the novel without making it sound like a list of academic points, though this seems like nothing more than a bit of characteristic cheekiness on Miles’ part given his liberal peppering of the narrative with quotes from an actual in-universe thesis. And while the musings on the horror underlying much of modern adventure fiction are certainly finely-tuned and precisely the sort of thing that Doctor Who and its spin-off series should probably nod towards in some fashion, it’s not as if the book is exactly reinventing the wheel when it chooses to relitigate the existential horror of Star Trek‘s transporter, or to critique the utopia of the People in a way that inevitably invites comparisons to the United Federation of Planets.\n\nWhat really ends up tying Down together is, frankly, just how good Miles is at writing for Benny, and it’s a crying shame that he does it so rarely, barring the aforementioned Decalog story and 2008’s The Adolescence of Time. Even the guest characters are of a higher calibre than usual, with Lucretia in particular managing to avoid the general fate of a lot of Miles-written characters – including those in Alien Bodies – of being a cool high concept in search of an actual personality.\n\nTie all of this up with a fresh and intriguing take on Ben Aaronovitch’s People – although let’s be real, as someone with a massive love of The Also People, the mere inclusion of those guys is enough to earn you a few points with me – and you have one of the strongest Benny novels so far. But not quite the strongest…\n\n2. Ship of Fools by Dave Stone\n\nAlright, granted, I can definitely understand finding room to quibble with this pick. Dave Stone has never exactly been the most restrained of authors, and those who are less favourably disposed to his very particular eccentricities and quirks than I will probably find less to enjoy here.\n\nThen again, the fact that this is the highest-rated of Stone’s novels on the Shannon Sullivan poll suggests that there is something to this one that resonates on a sufficiently deep level that it overcomes his general Marmite quality. Certainly, for all that Ship of Fools still contains the trademark wacky characters and kooky concepts that one has come to expect from a Dave Stone novel, it remains a much more grounded endeavour than something like Sky Pirates!, and this largely ends up working in the novel’s favour.\n\nWhere a book like Down served to shed fresh light on an up-and-coming young author, Ship of Fools‘ success is of an altogether different stripe, seeing a relatively seasoned veteran of the Virgin lines wrangling his style into a more precisely-tuned form, without irrevocably compromising his… artistic idiosyncracies, shall we say.\n\nAnd it is, by and large, an approach that works wonders. From start to finish, this is an absolute riot of a book, packed with any number of laugh out loud moments that fully demonstrate the benefits of having a writer like Stone who is, by all outward appearances, willing to stick with Virgin for the long haul, even when jumping ship to BBC Books would probably have been the more sensible financial decision. Benny absolutely sings in his hands, and it’s little wonder that he’d end up tying with Justin Richards as the most frequently commissioned author of these post-Doctor NAs.\n\nIt also helps that, unlike a lot of Stone novels, the jokes are tied together by a strong sense of thematic unity. Almost every punchline here is turned towards the general purpose of smashing Benny into the works of Agatha Christie and having her engage in her usual “point at it and laugh” routine at the expense of the chronically upper-class aesthetic and worldview of those novels.\n\nIt’s certainly a delicate balancing act to try and pull off, requiring a delicate weighing of the comedy and the commentary such that no one aspect comes to overpower the other, but Ship of Fools manages to pull through. It is, without a doubt, a highlight not just of the Benny novels, but of Dave Stone’s career as a whole.\n\n1. The Room With No Doors by Kate Orman\n\nWell, yes, obviously. As the immortal saying goes, “You were expecting someone else?”\n\nI might not have as much of a problem with Lungbarrow‘s lore revelations as some folks, but the fact of the matter is that, by any reasonable standard, it is The Room With No Doors which ought to be given pride of place as the real conclusion to the New Adventures and their overall thematic arc.\n\nI mean, it’s hardly difficult to account for why one should receive so much focus at the expense of the other. Lungbarrow sits comfortably within the tradition of nineties sci-fi to need to “go big or go home” with regards to its scale and its scope. Gallifrey becomes every bit the grand, towering mythological edifice that fan imagination has always yearned for, with every Capitol street hiding a new secret as to the nature of Rassilon and his legendary Oven Mitt (capitalisation entirely mandatory, natch).\n\nBut The Room With No Doors, as befits Kate Orman’s last Seventh Doctor novel – give or take a So Vile a Sin – represents an approach that is almost the exact polar opposite of the purported “Cartmel Masterplan,” but which is infinitely more crucial in properly understanding and contextualising the New Adventures as a part of Doctor Who.\n\nThis is a quiet, understated little novel, to the extent where I suspect that I’ll need to give it a second reading some day to allow its brilliance to properly ferment in my mind. This isn’t some show-stopping epic, and unless one is able to completely jettison the mountains of fan expectation that instruct us to expect just such an epic, the actual tone of The Room With No Doors is the sort of thing that will probably throw you for something of a loop on the first go around.\n\nEven so, it’s hard not to appreciate the sheer level of meticulously crafted, beautiful lyricism on display here. There are any number of images that rank as some of the most striking the New Adventures ever produced, from the Doctor and a young peasant girl being pierced by the same arrow through to the ironically transcendent sequence of the Doctor being buried alive. The whole book sings with metaphor and poetry, whether it be the titular room or the recurring Schrödinger’s cat motif.\n\nAnd ultimately, setting aside all the nonsense about Time Lords and Looms and the Other, it’s really books like The Room With No Doors for which the New Adventures should be remembered, and it’s for that reason that it really does deserve to be called the best New Adventure of 1997.\n\nWhat we have here, whether you believe there are sixty-one instalments in the series or eighty-four, is a run of science fiction tie-in novels that managed to reach heights of quality which no other franchise could even dream of reaching, let alone surpassing. Far from being down for the count after being consigned to the wastelands of popular culture, the past six years have seen Doctor Who grow and change like never before, and the effects of that change are still being felt more than three decades on.\n\nWhat a series.\n\nThe Missing Adventures\n\n4. The Dark Path by David A. McIntee\n\nFor those of you disappointed that I didn’t take Lungbarrow to task for inadequately filling in the gaps around a supposedly huge unanswered question in the series’ lore, well, this is the one for you. The Dark Path forms the middle act of an incredibly loose “Master trilogy” from writer David A. McIntee, following up on the introduction of the brand new – and swiftly forgotten – Basil Rathbone Master in First Frontier and presaging a sojourn to meet the ravaged Inferno Earth’s Master in The Face of the Enemy just one month into 1998.\n\nBy the standards of a David A. McIntee novel, this is certainly one of the more well-regarded ones. The only books of his to achieve a higher Sullivan score are The Eleventh Tiger and the aforementioned The Face of the Enemy. Similarly, the book sits just 0.3 percentage points below Mark Gatiss’ The Roundheads to be crowned the second-best Second Doctor novel across all the Virgin and BBC lines.\n\nIt’s not as if this praise is completely unfounded, either. This late in the game, coming just one month before Virgin lost their Doctor Who license, the company has clearly figured out how to pull from the established lore of the New and Missing Adventures in order to assist the worldbuilding within a single novel. There are some meditations on the mentality of Empire that manage to take on a surprisingly resonant tone, delivered as they are mere months before the handover of Hong Kong and amid a climate of resurgent Euroscepticism in the lead-up to the general election.\n\nMore than that, McIntee manages to capitalise on the cast in order to help flesh out this theme, whether it be through having Victoria reflect on her shifting attitudes to the imperialist mindset of her native time, or using his prerogative as a Scottish author to actually give Jamie some more authentic dialogue. Even the notoriously difficult-to-capture Second Doctor manages to avoid being too egregiously out of character, which is a much more impressive achievement than my equivocating framing might make it sound.\n\nThe problem, really, lies with almost everything to do with the Master, which is something of an issue for a novel that is plainly selling itself almost entirely off of the promise of a pre-Pertwee exploration of the Master’s origins and his relationship with the Doctor. Even here, the actual interactions of Koschei with the novel’s characters, both regular and guest, generally manage to work quite well.\n\nBut the actual arc of his descent into becoming the Master we know and occasionally love depending on the quality of this week’s script, perhaps the most crucial element of the novel to get right, feels curiously superficial and truncated. The sensation of truncation, at least, is readily explicable: McIntee quite literally had to cut reams and reams of extra material from the book in order to get it down to size.\n\nThe obvious follow-up observation here, however, is to note that The Dark Path is still quite a long book by the standards of the MAs, coming in at just under three hundred pages. Given just how much of that bloated runtime is given over to extended space battle sequences of the sort that McIntee really ought to have grown past after Lords of the Storm turned out to be such a disappointment, it’s tough to argue that the storytelling real estate was parcelled out in the most economical manner possible.\n\nSo while The Dark Path may be a step in the right direction for the Second Doctor novels, the Troughton Era remains frustratingly poorly served nearly two years after The Menagerie failed to impress. Despite its apparently being held in high esteem by fandom, this isn’t even the best Second Doctor novel of 1997, and without intending to get too far ahead of ourselves, it might just be the worst.\n\n3. The Well-Mannered War by Gareth Roberts\n\nNo, you’re not reading that wrong, I did just place a Christopher Bulis novel above a Gareth Roberts book. To a certain extent, this could probably be argued to be an indefensible choice, a case of me allowing my personal dislike of the author’s politics to colour my impression of a book written some twenty years before he really started to go off the deep end and began publishing transphobic bilge.\n\nAnd well, sure. We have, I trust, thoroughly exhausted the topic of Gareth Roberts’ transphobia over the past four years or so – I’d say five, but again, I wrote my reviews of The Highest Science and Tragedy Day while I was completely unaware of the matter, so it feels like cheating to count them – but since this is the last time he’ll actually crop up on one of these Year in Review posts, I figure I ought to take this final opportunity to ask… is it wrong for me to allow his shittiness to inform my ranking here?\n\nIn the main, I don’t think so. I’m sure, if I were to look at The Well-Mannered War “objectively,” that I could construct a case for its being considered a “better” novel than A Device of Death, say, but even if we were to try and set aside all the politics of this situation, we’re still left with the fact that I found my actual enjoyment of the novel to be severely hampered by this context.\n\nWhy would I want to wholly excise my feelings just to be “more objective” about an out-of-print Doctor Who novel from half a decade before I was even born, when the author is actively contributing to a ghoulish, genocidal movement that wants nothing less than the complete eradication of trans people? At a certain point, all calls for “objectivity” come dangerously close to Matthew Dessem’s “unbiased” review of Citizen Kane, published in the wake of the Gamergate movement’s self-professed demands for “ethics in games journalism.”\n\nSo while The Well-Mannered War might have any number of fun, humorous moments, it ultimately cannot avoid standing as the epitaph for my engagement with one of the most sadly fallen figures in Doctor Who‘s history. Gareth Roberts was once at the forefront of the franchise and boldly pushing the series forward as a part of the wave of hungry young innovators swept in by Virgin, only to find himself left as a cranky, warped, bitter old fossil in the vague shape of his former self, and the fact that I had to give over my last review of Virgin’s explicitly Doctor Who-branded novels to a bigoted troglodyte like him still can’t help but sting.\n\n2. A Device of Death by Christopher Bulis\n\nA heavily qualified placement, as will probably always be true of any praise one might care to heap upon a Christopher Bulis novel. The man who made his debut with Shadowmind is never likely to turn out an absolute masterpiece, and A Device of Death benefits considerably both from the muddled quality of The Dark Path and the deep-seated loathing I feel towards Gareth Roberts for becoming so deeply mired in transphobic ignominy.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is “merely” a passable read with solid characterisation and a plot that progresses at a sufficient clip to prevent one from becoming too bored. In allowing Bulis to claim his record fifth Missing Adventure, the novel makes an effective case for the series’ constantly returning to him, which is far more than can be said of a book like Twilight of the Gods, and therefore allows him to bow out on something approaching a high note.\n\nAll passive-aggressive swipes at the author’s writing aside, however, A Device of Death also demonstrates a willingness to get creative in its explorations of the franchise’s historical lacunae well in excess of your usual MA fare. The notion of a gap between Genesis of the Daleks and Revenge of the Cybermen in which the Fourth Doctor, Sarah Jane and Harry are given a temporary TARDIS and also maybe accidentally influence the creation of the Movellans is fanwanky as all get out, sure, but there is at least the vague glimmer of an attempt to bridge the radically different aesthetics of the Hinchcliffe and Williams Eras of the programme.\n\nIt’s trying to approach the show’s continuity with a view towards extrapolating its implications for the types of stories possible in a given period, which is vastly preferable to the itemised list attitude exhibited by books like Business Unusual, or even Bulis’ own half-hearted attempts to “sort out” Kamelion’s death in The Ultimate Treasure some six months later.\n\nThe actual plot of the book is admittedly relatively standard Bulis fare, with lots of high-tech space militarism and a grand war between two alien factions. Even so, this is certainly the best execution of that rudimentary brief to be found in his catalogue to date, though that really isn’t saying much.\n\nI doubt A Device of Death is the kind of book I’ll look back on with teary, nostalgia-glazed eyes when I wrap up Dale’s Ramblings, but I still managed to surprise myself by enjoying it as much as I did. As we barrel towards the blog’s seven-year anniversary, that’s precisely the kind of surprise I need.\n\n1. Burning Heart by Dave Stone\n\nBetween this and my crowning Steve Lyons’ Killing Ground the best Missing Adventure of 1996, one would be forgiven for thinking that I merely possess a deeply-rooted liking of Sixth Doctor books. Of course, if you want to disabuse yourself of that notion all you need to do is flip on over to the Past Doctor Adventures section and check out Business Unusual, but I digress.\n\nIf I had to pin down what it is that I find so consistently entertaining about those novels that choose to take on the rather daunting task of revisiting the widely-slated Colin Baker years, I could probably do worse than to argue that such efforts, if they are to succeed, always require some gestures towards the redemption of a fundamentally broken era.\n\nAnd Burning Heart is no exception to the rule, managing to loop back around to the lineup with which the Sixth Doctor MAs began all the way back in State of Change. Moreover, it attempts to bridge the toxic, abusive Six/Peri dynamic of Season 22 with the far more sedate and friendly rapport on display in The Trial of a Time Lord.\n\nTo a certain extent, this is always going to be a doomed task, by the very nature of past Doctor fiction. No amount of willpower on the part of Dave Stone or any other author will ever be able to retroactively change the television stories that exist on either side of Burning Heart, and a reader who attempts to maintain the pretense of the novel’s slotting between Vengeance on Varos and The Mark of the Rani will inevitably see the broadly hopeful conclusion of the dysfunctional duo’s adventures on Dramos dashed upon the harsh rocks of Industrial Revolution-era Killingworth.\n\nYet there is, in some readings of the novel, a tendency to overcorrect and suggest that Stone is in some sense attempting to reinforce the notion of Peri as a fundamentally flawed and unintelligent character, with the primary piece of evidence for such usually being the way in which she unwittingly falls in with a bunch of Nazi analogues.\n\nSpeaking purely for myself, this is an interpretation that has never seemed entirely convincing. On the contrary, Burning Heart makes a point of stressing that Peri’s gravitating towards the Human First lot is a fairly direct consequence of her feeling hurt and confused by the Doctor’s mistreatment of her. A glance at Peri’s actual arc throughout the novel further imperils this reading, building as it does to a scene of her asserting her individuality and unwillingness to succumb to xenophobia and hatred. It’s hard to imagine a conclusion more at odds with the ostensible goal of snickering at how rubbish Peri is.\n\nRather than being yet another tiresome screed against a character (and actress) who was treated awfully by the programme, Burning Heart is a surprisingly thoughtful little number that works extremely well when taken as a companion piece to Bad Therapy‘s paean for the value of empathy. And as if that wasn’t enough, it’s also an implicit mashup of Doctor Who with the world of Judge Dredd, providing some much-needed resolution not just for the lingering scars of the 1985 hiatus, but for the larger British tradition of weird, thorny, and Mary Whitehouse-reviled counterculture with an anti-Thatcher bent. Mere months before the ascendancy of New Labour, it’s hard to think of a more timely subject.\n\nBurning Heart might just be one of the most underrated and misunderstood books I’ve ever had the pleasure of covering, and it all fed into a review which I have no qualms about considering one of my proudest moments as a critic. It might not be for everyone, but it’s definitely for me.\n\nThe Eighth Doctor Adventures\n\n6. War of the Daleks by John Peel\n\nThe bottom two slots of the EDA ranking were at once the easiest and the most difficult out of all twenty-eight novels under consideration here. While there was never any serious doubt in my mind that the lowest rungs of this particular ladder would be filled by War of the Daleks and The Eight Doctors, I had to spend a considerable amount of time deliberating over which novel I found more objectionable on the whole.\n\nAnd frankly, for all that the fact you’re currently reading an entry about Peel’s novel rather than Dicks’ might reasonably imply that I managed to reach some sort of definitive conclusion on the matter, I remain entirely receptive to anyone who might want to make the case for The Eight Doctors being a worse book.\n\nBut since the nature of the Year in Review format generally presupposes a certain measure of surety in our judgments, I’m willing to stand my ground here and reiterate what should be obvious to anyone who read my original review.\n\nWar of the Daleks is quite simply one of the worst novels ever to be published under the Doctor Who brand, and the fact that I have to begin a ranking of the EDAs of 1997 with any amount of hemming and hawing as to whether it can be considered the worst instalment in the series to date is a searing indictment of just how ignominious the line’s beginnings have been.\n\nAfter a nine year wait for fresh Dalek action following the invigorating energy of Ben Aaronovitch’s Remembrance of the Daleks, including a six year period in which Virgin – and the TV movie, for that matter – had the xenophobic pepperpots flit around the edges of their steadily accreted Future History, along comes John Peel in his capacity as the most establishment of establishment writers to effectively roll back the clock on two decades’ worth of development.\n\nAnd although the giant, clanking retcon of Skaro’s destruction receives the lion’s share of criticism, not unjustifiably, it’s the larger disdain towards the very idea of doing anything bold or provocative with the Daleks that ultimately proves so toxic to the novel’s success, to say nothing of the unintentional cynicism of appealing to the wishes of the recently-deceased Terry Nation.\n\nAnybody hoping against hope for something more substantial than a set of po-faced, moralising lectures on the nature of war with occasional flare-ups of creepy, retrograde sexism and a seemingly endless procession of incomprehensibly dull Dalek action sequences will wind up sorely disappointed by War of the Daleks. So, too, will anybody expecting drama with even an ounce of spark or verve or even so much as a thready pulse.\n\nBut then, that’s always been the way with John Peel, hasn’t it?\n\n5. The Eight Doctors by Terrance Dicks\n\nAh, excellent, another one where I barely even have to try and craft a coherent dismissal of the novel because its sheer awfulness is just so jaw-droppingly self-evident. Again, it’s worth noting that I wouldn’t even argue too strenuously wth anybody who concluded that I should have swapped The Eight Doctors into last place. Certainly, in terms of what it represents for the state of the wider Doctor Who brand, this was a much greater shock than even the most pessimistic of observers could have possibly predicted heading into June 1997.\n\nGiven a reasonably safe and beloved pair of hands in the form of Uncle Terrance, the BBC Books line should have, at the very least, gotten off to a solid if unremarkable start. Sure, they had a fairly sizeable mountain of fan scepticism to overcome off the back of the less-than-stellar reception of the TV movie, to say nothing of the decision to revoke Virgin’s license in spite of their generally turning out a quality of product far in excess of most science fiction tie-in lines, but one could reasonably hope that we had come through the worst of the Wilderness Years confusion. How could they possibly mess this up?\n\nWell, as it happens, they could, and in spectacular fashion too.\n\nAbout the only thing helping The Eight Doctors pull ahead of War of the Daleks here, really, is the fact that its disjointed, fanwank-drenched structure prevents it from ever settling in one place long enough to completely drain all interest from the reader.\n\nThis should not be misconstrued as a declaration that The Eight Doctors is not boring, because it most certainly is. The Trial of a Time Lord segments are particularly trying of the audience’s patience, and are, on a not unrelated note, by far the portion of the book in which Dicks luxuriates the longest. But for the most part, each segment of the novel sees the reader quickly whisked along to witness some fresh offence against good taste in literature.\n\nIs this damning with faint praise? By any remotely healthy standard, yes, but it is at the very least marginally preferable to War of the Daleks‘ method of choice, which largely just boils down to beating the audience senseless through constant repetition of its cardinal inanities until you’re screaming to be let off the ride.\n\nA full accounting of The Eight Doctors‘ many sins would only further bloat this already gargantuan post beyond all sanity, particularly when I already spilt several thousand words on the subject in my original review. Suffice it to say… it’s bad.\n\nShocking conclusion, I know, for an entry where I’ve basically devolved into comparing the book at hand to War of the Daleks in much the same way one might discuss different forms of psychological torture. Both will leave your inner critic a gibbering, sobbing wreck, but their respective methods ultimately diverge in the specific shade of awful that they most openly favour.\n\nWho says freedom of choice is dead?\n\n4. The Bodysnatchers by Mark Morris\n\nWe should begin by saying that The Bodysnatchers is readable. It’s rather alarming that our standards have sunk so low that that should feel like a dividing line between the qualitative tiers of the EDAs, but for better or for worse, this is the first book on the list where you could sit down and read it without having cause to question the general wisdom of the choices in your life that led you to that decision.\n\nAt the same time, well, it’s difficult to make the case that its successes are the most original or innovative Doctor Who has ever seen, particularly coming off the back of the gleefully idiosyncratic Virgin line. Granted, this is at least partially the point of the exercise, with horror author Mark Morris making his Doctor Who debut by blatantly trading off the back of fans’ established goodwill towards such Hinchcliffe Era classics as Terror of the Zygons and The Talons of Weng-Chiang.\n\nIn this respect, the most instructive point of comparison for The Bodysnatchers probably still remains Mark Gatiss’ The Unquiet Dead, with both its Hinchcliffe revivalism and its position as the third EDA making the juxtaposition all but inevitable. In all honesty, the only truly distinctive addition that The Bodysnatchers makes to the stories from which it’s pulling – barring inconsequential and slightly silly “revelations” about Zygon lore of the sort that I generally don’t care about – is probably the obvious glee Morris takes in being able to make use of a genuinely Gothic authorial voice in all its self-indulgent, flowery glory.\n\nPerhaps more interesting than all of this, however, is the novel’s take on Sam, with Morris giving her permission to act unlikeable in a profoundly teenager-ish way that, while undeniably obnoxious, offers at least the barest glimmer of a workable characterisation for the series’ rather broadly-defined new companion. It’s a refreshing take on the standard Doctor Who archetype of the companion, with the only other character I can think of to cite as a precedent being saddled with some rather unfortunate quirks besides, like “being played by Matthew Waterhouse.”\n\nOf course, it’s also in The Bodysnatchers that the first stirrings of the rather insipid and lifeless Doctor/Sam romance plot begin to make themselves known, and the scene in which Sam jealously contemplates the figure cut by Emmeline in her sodden underwear is only a few levels removed from John Peel having her say she’s “mature for her age” in the course of fending off the advances of a creepy and entitled “nice guy.”\n\nStill, any discussion of the novel is liable to loop right back around to where we started: It’s readable. And at this early stage of the EDAs, that counts for more than you might initially think.\n\n3. Genocide by Paul Leonard\n\nOK, now we’re starting to get to the stuff that actually shows some real promise. Genocide is far and away the best novel Paul Leonard has written to date, and deserves far better than to be lumped in with The Bodysnatchers and War of the Daleks as a part of the four month period of dead air between Vampire Science and Alien Bodies.\n\nIndeed, of the five books – or six if you count next year’s Legacy of the Daleks – that constitute the micro-era of Nuala Buffini’s brief tenure as editor of BBC Books’ Doctor Who line, this is up there with Orman and Blum’s effort as the book which leans the least on nostalgia for an established part of the programme’s history. Just as Vampire Science used the very loose thread of the vampire menace suggested by State of Decay as a springboard to concoct a broader bloodsoaked tale owing more to Anne Rice and Joss Whedon than Terrance Dicks, Genocide extrapolates a post-Green Death future for the iconic Jo Grant while simultaneously weaving a quietly moving narrative of colonial violence and temporal paradox.\n\nOf course, it probably goes without saying that, with its dabbling in alternate histories and constant references to the UNIT years, Genocide owes a sizable debt to Jim Mortimore’s Blood Heat, but while Leonard might have effectively spent the past three years pigeonholed as the poor man’s Jim Mortimore, it’s here that he first begins to articulate a compelling case for his having not just equalled his close creative compatriot, but to have perhaps surpassed him.\n\nWhere Blood Heat largely papered over Mortimore’s deficiencies in skilful characterisation by employing the old sci-fi trick of parallel universes to present twisted reflections of familiar faces, Genocide proves hauntingly attentive to the myriad of competing perspectives caught up in the wake of a mutually reinforcing cycle of imperialism, without ever losing sight of the central horror of such an idea in the mists of its own ambivalence as Eternity Weeps seems to do.\n\nEven Sam is given some fairly meaty drama to work with in her chaotic slaying of a Tractite at the novel’s climax, and without so much as a hint of the cheap, underdeveloped romance of The Bodysnatchers to boot. It’s a crying shame to read the stunning final reprisal of the opening framing sequence, with Sam performing the role of Mauvril as the guilt-wracked narrator unburdening herself to the Doctor, when you know that John Peel’s sexist drivel is just around the corner.\n\nUltimately, for all that Genocide has some lingering implications for the line, it largely ends up feeling emblematic of the Buffini Era as a whole, being most interesting as a vision of a road not taken right before the destiny of the line was rather forcefully redirected by the massive success of Alien Bodies. But as we said of Ghost Devices, alternate histories still remain potent and intriguing objects in their own right, and Genocide serves as further proof of that thesis, standing as a pretty impressive capstone on a three book run bookended by the dismal failures of Dicks and Peel.\n\nOh, what might have been.\n\n2. Vampire Science by Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman\n\nIn many respects, it’s the following up of The Eight Doctors with Vampire Science that proves problematic and instructive in equal measure for those of us wishing to discern the overall arc of the EDAs. From the very beginning, BBC Books were keen to highlight the fact that their new line of novels would be making a conscious effort to move away from the more controversial excesses of the Virgin line, whether that be the constant angsting over the Doctor’s reliability or lack thereof, or the willingness to feature less kid-friendly fare involving more sex and violence than was ever allowed on the original programme.\n\nBy the same token, Vampire Science was always liable to represent a bit of a speedbump on that particular road. If a particularly discerning reader could take one glance at a Terrance Dicks novel named The Eight Doctors, proudly sporting the Seal of Rassilon on its front cover, and be reasonably assured of guessing the general tenor of its contents, then the latest contribution of noted Virgin veteran Kate Orman, joined for the first time by long-time RADW sweetheart and soon-to-be husband Jonathan Blum, was no different. Moreover, it was supremely unlikely to ever deviate in any sort of substantial fashion from the Virgin house style, and indeed, when July 1997 rolled around, it didn’t.\n\nThe problem, if it can be accurately described as such, was that Vampire Science was actually rather good. Indeed, in the years since, it’s become almost universally agreed that it would have made an infinitely better start to the saga of the Eighth Doctor than Terrance Dicks’ travesty of a novel. If we want to get more extreme in our formulation of this thesis, there’s probably a reasonable case to be made that it would have made for a better beginning than the TV movie itself.\n\nIn isolation, the high quality of Vampire Science isn’t really an issue. It’s the first piece of substantial, novel-length fiction to present a workable Eighth Doctor, and Orman even manages to perform something of a repair job on the much-maligned Sam. I defy the most staunch of Sam haters to seriously argue that there isn’t a world of difference between the character as written here when compared to her cursory introduction by Terrance Dicks. Outside of the regular cast, the book also offers a refreshing take on vampires within Doctor Who, feeling keyed in to the zeitgeist that gave us Interview with the Vampire and Buffy the Vampire Slayer in a way that Terrance Dicks’ borderline archaic Hammer Horror imitations never could.\n\nBut as you’d probably expect of a Kate Orman novel, the ways in which Vampire Science is good are closely tied to the ways in which the New Adventures were often good. Needless to say, this is a bit of an issue for a book series that so loudly trumpeted its breaking from the Virgin mould as one of its primary selling points. In the long run, this was undoubtedly a good thing, as it began to free the EDAs up to be just as weird as their predecessors, if not even moreso, but it certainly didn’t help an already chronically confused launch in the wake of The Eight Doctors.\n\nStill, taken on its own merits, Vampire Science is another feather in Kate Orman’s increasingly impressive cap, and an early highlight of the EDAs by just about any metric you could care to name. It’s obvious, in reading it, that the BBC Books line would have been far better served if they’d simply ditched the whole “anti-Virgin” positioning from the get-go and simply focused on telling good stories making use of the tricks and tools developed over the past six years of the New Adventures.\n\nWhich brings us, appropriately enough, to number one…\n\n1. Alien Bodies by Lawrence Miles\n\nWell again, I ask you, were you expecting someone else?\n\nIf Vampire Science laid bare the foolhardy, misbegotten nature of the EDAs’ decision to position themselves as the anti-New Adventures, it’s Alien Bodies that truly ends up dealing the deathblow to that idea. For all that this is a landmark moment in the history of Doctor Who and basically the single most direct intersection between the BBC Books lines and the programme’s eventual post-2005 revival, it’s difficult to argue that Alien Bodies is at all a comfortable fit for the series’ ostensible mission statement to this point of rejecting the adult stylings of the NAs.\n\nOf course, as with Vampire Science, we might fairly ask if this is at all a problem, and the answer, just as predictably, is a resounding no. This is a book packed to bursting with big ideas, and a novel whose shadow looms large over the remaining eight years of the EDAs, even past the point at which its core mythological concerns have been explicitly tidied away.\n\nTo some extent, the Vampire Science/Alien Bodies duology proves just as instructive as the one-two punch of Revelation and Time’s Crucible back in the early days of the Virgin line. Where Cornell and Platt laid down the law as to just what the New Adventures could achieve, Orman and Miles achieve something similar here for the EDAs, sheepishly conceding in the wake of The Eight Doctors and War of the Daleks that the whole “Let’s not do things like Virgin did it” idea wasn’t the most winning of stratagems.\n\nAnd this begins to get at the dirty little secret of the Eighth Doctor Adventures’ place in the Wilderness Years, a secret that we’re undoubtedly going to return to time and again over the remaining 170 books: they’re far and away the least relevant corner of the Wilderness Years. Relevance, naturally, has always had an oblique relationship with quality at the best of times, so it’s not as if we’re about to write off the EDAs six books in just because we never got Matt Smith reminiscing over Iris Wildthyme or Ncuti Gatwa waxing lyrical about the Council of Eight.\n\nYet that still leaves us with Alien Bodies, a book that accidentally hits upon one of the cornerstones of Russell T. Davies’ revival in 2005, but can only do so by harking back to the style of the very book series that the EDAs were initially touted as a rejection of. Most damningly of all, however, it’s not as if the other authors onboarded any of those stylings as we head into 1998, at least if a cursory glance at books like Kursaal or Longest Day is anything to go by.\n\nSo yes, Alien Bodies gets this spot primarily on the virtue of its influence, and like all truly influential works of fiction, its greatness becomes somewhat difficult to fully perceive in light of its many subsequent imitators. Yet even a quarter of a century later, in spite of its proving deeply revealing as to the identity crisis of the EDAs, that glimmer of innovation still persists, and every part of the novel works in furtherance of a plot with enough shocking twists and truly gonzo ideas that you don’t even care about such trifles as the fact that the guest characters are as broadly drawn as they are in every other Lawrence Miles outing.\n\nThis is the book that 1997 was building to from the very first page of Eternity Weeps, even if we might only be able to truly realise it in hindsight. How could I really justify giving the #1 spot to anything else?\n\nThe Past Doctor Adventures\n\n6. Business Unusual by Gary Russell\n\nAs an amusing preliminary post-script to my original review, I’ll first begin by noting that I actually did send it in to a close friend of mine for a peer review process of sorts. In spite of my own personal feelings that I’d been harsher on Russell’s work than I had in the past, one of the main comments I got back was that I could have gone in a little harder on the guy.\n\nIn truth, this gave me something to think about, and I realised that I have perhaps treated him with kid gloves at times purely on account of my review of his debut novel having been, in retrospect, a lot snarkier and angrier than I generally like to be these days.\n\nSo again, until we get to the seemingly much-maligned Placebo Effect, and in light of my having lost out on another opportunity to be an irascible grump towards the man on account of my having actually enjoyed Deadfall against all odds, I suppose I’ll have to make do with being crystal clear on my feelings about Business Unusual: It’s awful.\n\nAfter a run of Sixth Doctor novels from Virgin that I found consistently fascinating for their efforts to rehabilitate a much-reviled era of the programme, we’re faced with a book that seems to sincerely believe that the biggest problem with the Colin Baker years was that Pip and Jane Baker should have contributed more scripts. There are moments at which the Sixth Doctor characterisation fostered by Russell’s later work at Big Finish manage to shine through in spite of the novel’s best efforts, but all too frequently we’re left with lines for the Doctor and Mel that feel a mere hair’s breadth away from “the catharsis of spurious morality” in their quality.\n\nFrankly, however, as grating as the overly verbose and simplistic attempts at “character development” might be, they’re really just the tip of one of the most tedious literary icebergs in the history of Doctor Who publishing. Any book in which the Doctor still has yet to actually so much as encounter the main villains three-fifths of the way through its length is bad enough, but to have the character brush right up against the possibility and then decide to postpone the confrontation even further feels almost wilful in its trying of the audience’s patience.\n\nAdd to all of this some muddled messaging on the materialistic excesses of the 1980s and the relationship of UNIT and the Pertwee Era to Doctor Who as a whole, along with an unfortunate recurrence of Russell’s aforementioned propensity towards racial slurs, and well… like I said to begin with, the final product is awful. It really is as simple as that.\n\n5. The Ultimate Treasure by Christopher Bulis\n\nIt seems it’s a real red-letter day for me trashing the contributions of authors who’ve made much more complimentary appearances on this list thus far, huh? Yes, unfortunately folks, if A Device of Death managed to overcome the inherent tepidness that seems to accompany most Christopher Bulis novels, with a far more thoughtful and creative construction than we’ve come to expect from the writer, the best thing that can be said in defence of The Ultimate Treasure is that it is, by a very thin margin, less boring than some of the true Bulis stinkers of days gone by like Shadowmind or Twilight of the Gods.\n\nThere’s little here that actively offends my tastes, to be sure, but this is the mercifully rare breed of book where you can practically discern all you need to know from the title alone. It’s a generic quest narrative of the highest order, all the way down to a half-assed, hackneyed reveal that the eponymous treasure is not of a “worldly possessions” sort, but more along the lines of “spiritual enlightenment,” and as ever, any writer who finds themselves coming this perilously close to aping the conclusion of movies like Star Trek V: The Final Frontier needs to sit down and have a long, hard discussion with themselves.\n\n(Actually, that holds just as true for the rest of The Final Frontier, now that I think of it. Maybe even more so.)\n\nEven within Bulis’ oeuvre, there’s very little to differentiate The Ultimate Treasure‘s story of a bunch of intrepid adventurers sallying forth on a grand quest from his more fantasy-inflected pastiche of the artform in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, which I wasn’t especially fond of in the first place despite its apparently being held in considerably higher regard by fans than this latest Bulis offering.\n\nI mean, I suppose you could point to the light sci-fi/fantasy fusion sheen that the book has going on, but even this feels more like an acknowledgment of the buzz generated by the then-recent Star Wars special editions and the announcement of the forthcoming prequel trilogy than it does an indicator of any deeper aesthetic purpose. Certainly, the book isn’t afraid to hop across the aisles of the two major “Star…” science fiction franchises, with the inclusion of a bustling space station seeming to suggest that Bulis’ longstanding tendencies towards Trek mimicry have finally grown to encompass Deep Space Nine. Which is progress of a sort, I suppose.\n\nAnd despite generally avoiding the depths of crassness that Season 22 plumbed in terms of the Doctor-Peri relationship, the first MA/PDA outing for the Five-Peri pairing can’t help feeling a little too gleefully sadistic in its seemingly setting out to destroy Peri’s wide-eyed naivety. Meanwhile, robbed of the considerable talents of Peter Davison, the inept attempts at capturing the Fifth Doctor’s exasperation just end up making him look as callous as his successor ends up being.\n\nThe Ultimate Treasure, ironically enough, is anything but a gem.\n\n4. Illegal Alien by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry\n\nThis one was always going to be a bit of a tough sell for me. Rolling back the clock on the New Adventures, a series which it’s hopefully apparent that I have a great deal of affection for at this point, and returning the Doctor and Ace to the immediate aftermath of Survival, complete with an abandoned Season 27 script? How could I possibly do anything but slate this?\n\nWell, as it happens, Illegal Alien is a perfectly competent debut for the Seventh Doctor in his newfound position as a member of the past Doctor fiction roster. It’s obviously playing to the traditionalist crowd who’re still liable to be griping on RADW about how it all went off the rails when they had Benny say “fuck” in Transit, to the point of maintaining the facade of being divided into discrete “Parts” like the television show of old, but for the most part Tucker and Perry avoid any odiously venomous attacks on the Virgin line.\n\nThese days, of course, the central trick of using the London Blitz as a means to create atmosphere has been rather resoundingly pre-empted by The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances, and even Victory of the Daleks has one-upped the placing of an iconic Doctor Who monster in such surroundings. Nevertheless, in 1997 World War II was still a relatively novel topic for the franchise to tackle directly, having only made its first appearance in The Curse of Fenric at the very tail end of the classic series, and the Blitz as presented in Illegal Alien makes for an appropriately desolate and bleak milieu.\n\nIndeed, it even leads to some of the strongest sequences in the book, as Tucker and Perry openly interrogate the nationalist myth-making that surrounds the era, while also taking the time to stress the disproportionate effect of the war on London’s East End in a manner that the television series’ forty-five minutes and change per episode could never hope to achieve.\n\nIf anything, the book’s biggest stumbling block comes in the final quarter, with its attempts to tie the pulpy horror narrative of Cyber-conversion to the all too real horrors of the Nazi occupation of Jersey essentially proving the point made in Lance Parkin’s Just War as to the unsuitability of Doctor Who for directly tackling that kind of all-encompassing human evil.\n\nSo in a very real sense, yes, this is a regression from the complexity of the NAs, but it remains broadly enjoyable fare nevertheless. If we can’t have the Virgin novels anymore, I suppose this will have to do.\n\n3. The Murder Game by Steve Lyons\n\nWell folks, they did it. A full two years after The Menagerie, and some three years after the advent of the Missing Adventures, BBC Books have managed to do what Virgin never could by turning out a Second Doctor novel that’s… OK.\n\nAdmittedly, there’s a credible case to be made that writer Steve Lyons’ fifth Doctor Who book is his weakest to date, and it’s almost undoubtedly his least interesting, but the standard of what constitutes a good Troughton Era novel has been so thoroughly skewed at this point that it really doesn’t matter all that much in the long run.\n\nWhat we have in The Murder Game, essentially, is little more than a perfectly competent Agatha Christie pastiche, with some decent characterisation for the Doctor, Ben and Polly and as many Doctor Who in-jokes as you’ve probably come to expect from Lyons by now. The biggest problem isn’t even one that could have been realistically foreseen by the publisher or author ahead of time, namely the very unfortunate timing of having the book see print shortly before the publication of Dave Stone’s own far superior send-up of classic detective novels in Ship of Fools.\n\nIn any event, the mechanics of the novel’s plotting are pretty well-tuned, and the Selachians make for an interesting twist on the archetypal Doctor Who monster of which the Troughton years proved so fond, actively choosing to play into their monstrous qualities in an effort to psychologically unnerve their opponents. It’s easy to see, even from this first appearance, why Lyons felt them worthy of returning in later stories like The Final Sanction and The Architects of History.\n\nIt’s not a perfect novel by any means, however, with the half-hearted attempt at incorporating an in-universe version of the book seeming rather limp coming from the mind that gave us books like Conundrum, Head Games and Time of Your Life. Similarly, the Ben/Polly/Terri love triangle winds up being just as dreary as the other million times it’s been trotted out by the early BBC Books lines.\n\nNo, for the best Second Doctor novel of 1997, we’ll have to turn our gaze to…\n\n2. The Roundheads by Mark Gatiss\n\nHeading into November 1997, Mark Gatiss had quite a bit to prove. Nightshade had been good, true, but that was more than five years ago at this point, and though he’d contributed to BBV’s P.R.O.B.E. series of fan films, those were never exactly the artistic highlights of the Wilderness Years. His last proper novel, St Anthony’s Fire, had been a tiresomely didactic screed against the evils of organised religion which was so lacking in any sort of nuance or complexity that it quite literally resorted to gruesome scenes of its main villain torturing a small kitten.\n\nThe Roundheads, thankfully, is a much better book than all that, even if it doesn’t eclipse Nightshade‘s raw, crackling “debut novel” energy. On his third turn at the bat, Gatiss finally proves what was always suspected in regards to his suitability to the world of past Doctor fiction, executing the “pure historical” brief with such deftness that it manages to make the task of capturing the essence of the Second Doctor’s era look like child’s play.\n\nNo small part of this is down to Gatiss’ very obvious affection for the subject matter of the English Civil Wars, and The Roundheads practically revels in the esotericism of its historical references, making off-handed nods to all manner of small details from the period without pausing to let the audience take a breath.\n\nOf course, a historical can’t be carried on detailed research alone, and the actual plotting of the book feels true to the “split up the TARDIS crew” form of sixties Who, with both Ben and Polly finding themselves in their own discrete plot threads that eventually intersect towards the end of the book. Meanwhile, the Doctor and Jamie largely find themselves sidelined in the halls of power alongside Oliver Cromwell, who provides what is nowadays recognisable as the “celebrity” component of the “celebrity historical,” filling the role that will go to Dickens in Gatiss’ own The Unquiet Dead, or to Winston Churchill in Victory of the Daleks.\n\nTo tell the truth, however, it’s the Cromwell sequences where the book most resoundingly runs aground, with the whole “Richard Cromwell might have foreknowledge of the future” plotline largely amounting to nothing and being tidied away by a spot of convenient hypnosis, though not before some vaguely uncomfortable and Whiggish “great man theory” sentiments can be espoused.\n\nStill, these are relatively small-scale problems, and while they hold the book back from taking the number one spot among its PDA contemporaries, they’re still not enough to completely sink a work that is, on the whole, far more enjoyable than any other Troughton novel to date, with The Murder Game providing the only thing in the way of a credible opponent.\n\n1. The Devil Goblins from Neptune by Keith Topping and Martin Day\n\nIn the context of nineties Doctor Who fandom, there’s a significant symbolic weight attached to The Devil Goblins from Neptune right off the bat, due mainly to its being conspicuously authored by two of the writers of 1995’s vaunted Discontinuity Guide, and the conspicuous absence of the third writer of that esteemed tome, Paul Cornell.\n\nIn developing from an embryonic Missing Adventures proposal kicked around by the discontinuous trio to the first strictly sans-Cornell collaboration between Topping and Day, the book effectively cements itself as one of the most effective microcosms of the Virgin-BBC Books transition imaginable, quite literally losing the involvement of one of the most acclaimed and recognisable voices to come up through the NAs.\n\nPredictably, despite his absence, the spectre of Cornell continues to linger over practically every page here, primarily through his infamous contention as to the Third Doctor’s having been “exiled to Earth and made… a Tory.” Yet, even in this we ought to make note of some rather salient points, chief among them being the fact that the finished product is clearly the result of a labour of love from all concerned, Cornell included.\n\nTo hear Martin Day tell it, The Devil Goblins from Neptune was always conceived with the aim of effectively being the perennial seventies Doctor Who story, replete with every trope and convention associated with the decade both in the context of the programme itself and of popular culture as a whole, without a care in the world as to how silly or gaudy those tropes may seem.\n\nAnd it works. This is a work that is suffused with a profound sense of the fun and the utterly ludicrous, taking in everything from Cold War spy-fi to the extraterrestrial greys of UFO lore. Even the smaller details, like the jokes about David Bowie’s The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars having been inspired by The Ambassadors of Death, or the infamous alternate history Beatles, are carefully calibrated to make a comment on the seventies as a decade, particularly in relation to the spirit of the sixties, itself reflective of a central animating tension of the Pertwee Era.\n\nThe actual plot of the novel is, in truth, almost wholly secondary to this garish procession of unapologetically seventies images, and in its own way, this serves as the perfect encapsulation of the Pertwee Era itself. When the biggest complaint I have about your book is a totally incomprehensible non sequitur of a scene that plays into “ancient aliens” ideas without any deeper purpose – although admittedly, that is in itself supremely seventies – and which has so little impact on the book as a whole that it can be easily disregarded, I think it’s fair to say that you’ve done something right.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWell there you have it. 1997, truly done and dusted. 15,000 extra words spilt on the subject. Why do I do this to myself? I wish I knew, dear reader, I truly wish I did. I’m probably going to shoot for a slightly different mode of production as we head into 1998 and I start easing myself back into university. The plan is to still do the reading of the novels, but to hold off on the actual reviews for a while so I can publish them in a weekly fashion without completely tanking my post-COVID fatigue-riddled energy reserves.\n\nSo, with all of that being said, be sure to tune in (provisionally) on the blog’s seventh anniversary on October 24th as we hop aboard the other Polar Express for yet another Agatha Christie pastiche in Christopher Bulis’ Tempest. Until then, however…\n\nKind regards,\n\nSpecial Agent Dale Cooper\n\n…they play something called jazz. Old Earth retro is all the rage just now.\n\n~ Sara correctly identifies nostalgia as the flavour of the month\n\nIn hindsight, it would probably have felt fundamentally wrong for 1997 to end in any other fashion. More than anything else, the single strongest unifying thread running throughout these past thirty books or so has been the gradual transformation of all of our assumptions regarding what Doctor Who looks like and what it can do. The Wilderness Years status quo as it stands with Mean Streets is practically unrecognisable from that with which we rang in the year in Eternity Weeps some eleven months ago.\n\nThe nature of this transformation, as we’ve implicitly stressed time and time again, is effectively nothing less than the death of Doctor Who, and the fact that this should seem at all remarkable is, in and of itself, worth commenting upon. After all, death has always been a part of the programme’s unfolding text dating back to October 1966 at the very latest, with every iteration of the show gradually becoming consumed by the march of time and used as raw artistic biomass to fuel the metamorphosis of its successor.\n\n(Pedants, of course, may want to point to the fifth episode of The Chase as an even earlier candidate for the first intrusion of Doctor Who‘s death into the narrative.)\n\nAnd yet none of this can quite alter the very real sense in which this latest death is, indeed, wildly different, primarily on account of the actual nature of the McCoy/McGann transformation never seeming remotely settled.\n\nOne possibility that was shot down in flames almost immediately, ironically enough, was the one that everyone had assumed and hoped would be the case going into May 1996, with the original twenty-six season juggernaut of BBC One programming finding a new lease on life as an American co-production with the likes of Fox and Universal. When the programme managed a meagre 5.5 million viewers on its American broadcast on the Fox network, tying with a rerun of Cops as the 75th most-watched broadcast of the week, any such hopes of a trans-Atlantic revival were dashed hard against the harsh and unforgiving rocks of Ellis Island.\n\nEven this minor televisual apocalypse proved to be a curiously deferred one, however, as was perhaps befitting of a decade like the 1990s in which all the presumptive eschatons seemed to ultimately fizzle out in a quietly embarrassing fashion. As late as April 1997, it was theoretically possible that Universal might choose to extend their option to expand the McGann television movie into a fully-fledged series, but there was never a sense that anybody that considered themselves to be even slightly “in the know” as to the ins and outs of television production seriously rated the probability of such a decision as anything more than a statistical trifle.\n\nSo Doctor Who died, six and a half years after it kicked the bucket the first time around. In this respect, Segal’s TV movie provides us with the perfect visual analogy in its much-delayed regeneration scene. Far from the classic series’ half-hearted blurring of the camera with a cheap visual effect, or even from the revival’s eventual fiery yellow splendour, the regeneration of the Seventh Doctor into the Eighth stands out as a moment of supremely ghoulish horror.\n\nHaving been the victim of an ill-advised attempt at medical intervention – at revival, even – Sylvester McCoy lies gurning in a mortuary cabinet, his skin limned by ethereal blue electrical discharges that offer fleeting glimpses of the skeleton beneath. On a television set, a lone technician watches a late night showing of James Whale’s classic 1931 adaptation of Frankenstein. As the newly transformed Paul McGann sits bolt upright in his steely confinement, the voice of Colin Clive as the eponymous mad scientist rings out through the hospital: “It’s alive! It’s alive!”\n\nThe appeal of this to those of us who like to create overly neat readings out of entirely extraneous snippets of an old television movie should be obvious. As a stand-in for the necromantic ritual that all television revivals are to one extent or another, it’s pretty much everything that one could ask for, and the only detail that might have conceivably improved the gracefulness of the parallel would have been to use one of the classic Peter Cushing-led Hammer Horror films instead, providing you as it would with a regeneration scene containing three separate Doctors.\n\nFrom a cynical perspective, the very fact of Doctor Who‘s having been imbued with life for that all-too-brief ninety minute span is treated here as something inherently monstrous, its new visage having been assembled out of sundry cult television cast-offs from the turn of the millennium rather than the extremities of a host of rotting corpses.\n\nAnd in case this hasn’t become glaringly obvious over the course of these past however many dozen reviews, I am undeniably one of those who takes a cynical perspective on the TV movie, not least because of what happened next. Well, OK, technically speaking “what happened next” in the immediate sense was that the New Adventures found themselves thrust into an unforeseen metatextual Greek tragedy-cum-existential crisis.\n\nWith Virgin staring down the barrel of a revoked licensing agreement, the novels that had almost single-handedly shepherded the Doctor Who brand for nigh on half a decade were forced to make way for a “revival” that was broadly acknowledged to be dead in the water, but not quite dead enough that the BBC didn’t think they could make a pretty penny by taking the books in-house.\n\nThis sense of inevitability and narrative determinism was only further heightened by the troubled production of So Vile a Sin, leading to a strange situation in which, for a full five months, contemporary readers of the NAs were acutely aware of the ruinous ends of two thirds of the line’s latter-day regular cast, despite only having actually seen one of those ruinous ends play out in full. If there exists a situation more likely to make the head of your average modern spoilerphobic fanboy spontaneously explode into a million tiny pieces, I truly cannot fathom what it might be.\n\nBut as fascinating as this period might be as a rare example of Doctor Who‘s past clinging on to life well beyond the point at which we as fans have been conditioned to expect it to be supplanted by the nominal “future” of the series, it has become increasingly clear by the end of 1997 that it was little more than that. Just nine months after it formally wrapped up, the McCoy-focused run of novels between Happy Endings and Lungbarrow feels like a peculiar footnote in the larger arc of the Eighth Doctor books’ rapidly attaining ascendancy over their Virgin predecessors.\n\nWhich allows us to circle back around to what I originally meant by “what happened next.” Whatever might have transpired in that prolonged interregnum – and make no mistake, it was a period containing several books that ought to be qualitatively assessed as, at a bare minimum, “really damn good” – the launch of the EDAs came to so strongly overshadow any other events that the elision of the twelve or so months between the airing of the TV movie and the publication of The Eight Doctors doesn’t actually feel entirely unjustifiable.\n\nUnfortunately for us though, not all stories attain notoriety by virtue of being good, or even basically competent, pieces of entertainment, and indeed in the case of the early Eighth Doctor Adventures it’s tough to escape the impression that the books repeatedly bore out the exact antithesis of that notion by being… well, let’s not make any bones about it, by being downright terrible.\n\nThe Eight Doctors quickly gained a reputation as one of the most widely derided Doctor Who novels of all time, and its placement as the third-worst of the EDAs’ eventual seventy-three total books on the Shannon Sullivan rankings becomes an even more scathing vote of no confidence when one considers its status as a product of perennially beloved former script editor Terrance Dicks. When the inaugural outing in a series of original, novel-length Doctor Who stories, written by one of the figures who practically defined the parameters of what prosebound Doctor Who could even look like for an entire generation of fans, is met with such widespread scorn and derision from the moment of its release, something has gone very, very wrong indeed.\n\nAnd go wrong it did. In a stunning display of artistic self-sabotage Dicks rapidly squandered thirty years’ worth of goodwill on a paper-thin, continuity-saturated mess of a novel whose unrelenting tedium was only broken up by moments of extraneous passive aggresiveness towards those parts of the programme that failed to meet with the author’s approval. Failing that, readers could expect to be treated to a spot of clumsy moralising and/or barely-veiled sexism that served as an all too painful reminder of the book’s having been written by a sixty-two year-old white British man who started working in television before the advent of colour transmissions.\n\nIn the wake of the EDAs’ quite literal failure to launch, the subsequent months did at least play host to a substantial uptick in quality. Vampire Science, The Bodysnatchers and Genocide demonstrated that a higher standard of novel was achievable if the range’s authors were willing to engage in a greater degree of artistic collaboration, with Orman, Blum, Morris and Leonard each chipping in to try and find a workable niche for a Doctor-companion duo that had found itself extremely lacking in definition for reasons largely outside of its control.\n\nYet if the laws of gravity are held to be a universal constant even in the publishing realm, what goes up must inevitably come down, and in War of the Daleks John Peel inadvertently ended up proving the truth of that maxim. After things had begun to start looking up for the nascent series, the erstwhile Dalek noveliser’s attempt at a big clanking Skarosian epic of his own quickly descended into a deeply regrettable morass of interminable battle sequences intercut with a series of po-faced lectures on the nature of war with all the moral sophistication of a Looney Tunes short.\n\nWhat’s more, Peel continued to display his persistent inability to write for women without constantly reminding the audience of their outstanding physical beauty or threatening them with the lingering spectre of unwanted or otherwise generally creepy sexual advances.\n\nThen, just as the novels seemed to have hit their lowest ebb for the second time in just five months, along came Lawrence Miles with Alien Bodies. Shooting almost instantly to the top of countless fan rankings of the Wilderness Years novels and remaining there for no small period of time, it was nothing short of a game-changer, transforming Miles from a purveyor of intriguing novelistic oddities like Christmas on a Rational Planet or Down into a leading light amidst the churning sea of the BBC Books line’s inadequacies.\n\nName a recurring concept from the Eighth Doctor books and there’s a fair chance that it can trace its lineage back to Alien Bodies in one way or another. Humanoid TARDISes, Faction Paradox, the War in Heaven, Dark Sam, the bottle universes; you name it, Alien Bodies started it.\n\nAt this juncture, particularly astute readers might be inclined to write all of my waffling off as a totally extraneous exercise in reiterating a loose paratextu"
