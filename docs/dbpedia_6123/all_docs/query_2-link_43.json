        "text": "< Back\n\nBlackadder 4\n\nThe Western Front 1917: Captain Blackadder joined the British Army when it was little more than a travel agency for gentlemen with an abnormally high sex drive. Now he's twenty yards from a lot of heavily armed people who want to kill him. Worse still, his brother officer is a man whose family brain cell is gathering dust in a pawn shop in Dunstable, and Baldrick is in charge of cooking. All six episodes ('Captain Cook', 'Corporal Punishment', 'Major Star', 'Private Plane', 'General Hospital', 'Goodbyeee') from the fourth series are featured on one DVD. Starring Rowan Atkinson along with guest stars such as Geoffrey Palmer, Miranda Richardson, Rik Mayall, and Adrian Edmondson as Baron von Richthoven."
