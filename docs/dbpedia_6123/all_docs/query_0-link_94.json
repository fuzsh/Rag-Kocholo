        "text": "Primetime, no. 16, Winter 1990/91, page 34-42\n\n[Primetime was an excellent little fanzine, with\n\nproper facts and nice long episode guides, which,\n\nafter this issue, merged into The Box magazine. This\n\narticle was followed by a piece called \"How To\n\nRecognise Different Episodes Of Monty Python From\n\nQuite A Long Way Away\", compiled by Andrew Pixley,\n\nSue Flower and Neil Alsop. It was a lengthy sketch-by-\n\nsketch breakdown of every episode, detailing exactly where\n\nevery sketch was then available to buy (videos, records,\n\nfilms, Secret Policeman's Balls, etc), and was accompanied\n\nby a beautiful colour snap of Graham Chapman in a waiting\n\nroom from 'Michael Ellis'. Brilliant though it is, this episode\n\nlist has not been reprinted here as all the details are now\n\navailable elsewhere, plus I can't be bothered with all that\n\ntyping]\n\nFRONTIER CIRCUS\n\nThat seminal comedy series MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS recently celebrated its 21st birthday. The occasion was marked by an OMNIBUS tribute on BBC-2, accompanied by re-runs of some classic episodes featuring Silly Walks, the Spanish Inquisition, the Dead Parrot sketch and many other old favourites. PAUL CARR and DICK FIDDY take a look back at the MONTY PYTHON legacy, and on the following pages, you'll find a complete guide to MPFC on TV...\n\nNothing is ever \"completely different\". For even if, as seems likely, \"nobody expected\" MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS any more that viewers of the \"trouble at t'mill\" sketch expected the Spanish Inquisition, its arrival was not entirely unprecedented.\n\nLike other pioneers, it had precursors - not only in radio shows like I'M SORRY I'LL READ THAT AGAIN and television programmes like THE FROST REPORT, in which prospective Pythons polished their style, but also in series like NOT ONLY... BUT ALSO (recently revived on BBC-2 after more than 25 years) and THE GOONS, which they did not contribute. CRAZY PEOPLE, for instance, the radio show which was to become THE GOONS, was first broadcast 18 years pre-PYTHON.\n\nBut even the Goons (Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe) and the Fringers (Alan Bennett, Peter Cook, Jonathan Miller and Dudley Moore) can't quite compare with the Pythons' success in almost every medium, from radio to records, from television to cinema, from print to performance - a success in no way diminished by the debt they undoubtedly owe not just to THE GOONS and BEYOND THE FRINGE, but to silent comedy and surrealism, the Theatre of the Absurd and the Marx Brothers. For the Pythons fully deserve their reputation as perhaps the most innovative comedy writers and performers of the last quarter of a century.\n\nThe Pythons learned the ropes of TV comedy on THE FROST REPORT, THE LATE SHOW, AT LAST THE 1948 SHOW, DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET AND MARTY - each of which offered them opportunities for both behind-the-scenes and on-screen contributions. THE FROST REPORT was the first to involve John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle all at once - though, with the exception of Cleese, only as writers. Animator Terry Gilliam's first TV hook-up with any of the team was on DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET, in which Palin, Idle and Jones also appeared. What sort of shows were they? Words like \"whacky\" and \"zany\" recur in the reviews - alongside the ubiquitous label \"satire\".\n\n\"Satire\" was the term deployed whenever Oxbridge men - for they were always Oxbridge and nearly always men (a book should be written on class and gender in relation to British comedy) - took to broadcast comedy in the Sixties. And if Cambridge's famous \"Footlights\" cabaret and its Oxford equivalent equipped them for the stage, it was broadcasting where they found their comic feet. Of the TV series, though, only Frost's had any \"satirical\" content - in the sense of regular reference to actual political events. However we describe them, most of the pre-PYTHON shows stand up well to reviewing today, and all of them reveal acorns from which Pythonesque oaks -or larches - were to grow. None of them, however, can quite explain why PYTHON happened when and where it did. For that, we need to look at what was happening in television in particular and popular culture in general.\n\nPerhaps the best analogy with the spirit of PYTHON is that of late Sixties popular music. Just as rock began to split into two apparently mutually exclusive and distinct categories at the end of that decade - pop and progressive, each with its own audience and its own section in the record stores - so was comedy split between traditional \"realist\" sitcom on the one hand and surrealist zaniness on the other, each with its own channel and slot. The late-night scheduling of PYTHON and the screening of DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET in \"children's hour\" revealed for perhaps the first time - as contemporary rock did - the break-up of the notion of a homogenous family audience, and with it of consensual comedy. PYTHON was thus television's \"youth culture\", part of its appeal its very inaccessibility to adults. In that sense, it was TV's very own version of the Fringe, its avant garde. But as in rock, it was an avant garde which emerged \"upwards\" out of popular culture rather than being absorbed \"downward\" from the \"Arts\".\n\nEven the title MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS echoes the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the circus-set track on that album, Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite. Sgt Pepper's was one of the first rock \"song cycles\" or concept albums - a departure from the conventional collection of discrete songs characteristic of pop's past. Similarly, PYTHON was the first of the comedy shows to replace a series of discrete sketches with a stream of consciousness which embraced them all in a flow (albeit one of crazy inconsequentiality). This strategy was adopted and adapted from THE FROST REPORT's \"Continuous Developing Monologue\" - a narrative spine scripted by Frost on a topical subject around which Cleese, Chapman, Palin, Jones and Idle wove their own idiosyncratic and inspired lunacy.\n\nThe rock/comedy parallel was echoed in the pairing of Pythonesque humour on DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET with the music of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, and also by Eric Idle's film pastiche of the Beatles, The Rutles, the financial support for Monty Python And The Holy Grail given by \"progressive\" bands like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, and by George Harrison's backing (through his company Handmade Films), of Monty Python's Life Of Brian.\n\nThe debt of Gilliam's distinctive animation for the series to Dada and surrealism was one shared by much of the album cover art of \"progressive\" music of the period (of which Sgt Pepper's itself is an excellent example). Finally, the Pythons' success, particularly in the US, both as live performers on the stadium circuit and as campus comedians in the cinema, echoes the itineraries of rock stars.\n\nBut if rock offers a cultural parallel, it was television which created a cultural context. The late Sixties was a period of considerable risk-taking in the BBC and although Hugh Carleton-Greene, the then Director-General, left the BBC on April Fool's Day 1969 (some six months before the first PYTHON programme was transmitted), it is his regime to which considerable credit is due for PYTHON's debut.\n\nIn his book From Fringe To Flying Circus (the best on MPFC), Roger Wilmut has suggested that the Pythons \"were perhaps the last people to benefit from Hugh Greene's influence at the BBC\". Wilmut's suggestion aside, it is certainly amusing to imagine the Pythons as a characteristically mischievous parting gift from Greene to the Corporation. He had been DG throughout the Sixties and during that time the BBC became the place for a new liberalism - in serious drama and light entertainment - when everything from one-off plays to sitcom series absorbed the new social realism. It was just this kind of cultural consensus and the assumed aesthetic hierarchy which went with it PYTHON unsettles.\n\nBy the end of the decade, a Conservative appointee as Chair of the BBC Governors and a Conservative government meant a retreat from such realism. For the Pythons, however, it was a bugle call for advance along the route they had already mapped out. For the Circus style was, by definition, a much less literal, much more lateral, one that its TV competitors, and the Pythons hoped that the built-in absurdity of the approach might work as some sort of alibi against accusations of bias or blasphemy, obscenity or libel - all of which charges were to be levelled at them soon enough.\n\nA world in which competitions could be held to summarise Proust, and civil servants gave out grants for sill walks, may sound simply crazy. But one in which there are news programmes for parrots succeeded - where \"sensible\" social realism had failed - in pinpointing British TV news's xenophobia (where reports of foreign disasters are so often followed by the refrain \"No Britons were injured\"). Similarly, the undertaker-as-cannibal sketch, in which it is suggested that the dear departed might be roasted and served up with French fried and broccoli, was Swiftian in its satirical edge without ever losing its anti-realist vein in revealing an enterprise culture taken to its callously (il)logical conclusion.\n\nIf PYTHON's peculiar blend of satire, psychedelia, surrealism and schoolboy silliness is hard to define, it is perhaps easier to describe what the Pythons themselves wanted to avoid. Two connected comedic devices which they were keen to escape were the discrete sketch with a beginning, middle and end, and also the punchline. Topical satire (along Frost lines) they also wanted to avoid, and they were equally averse to the way in which that series had been literally anchored by one performer/presenter. In place of this magazine format, they opted for one based on a Gilliam animation from DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET. It was called Elephants and its \"plot\" was as follows:\n\nIgnoring a sign saying \"Beware Of Elephants\" a man is crushed beneath a fallen elephant leaving only his head protruding which some passing football players start kicking around until their own heads too fall off and bounce away into the distance where they appear only as tiny bits of dirt in an ad for soap powder apparently presented by Enoch Powell holding up a clean white sheet on which appears a shoot-out scene between a fort and a gunman-on-horseback whose bullets hit the soap powder packet and the powder spills out like snow indeed it is snow and a stagecoach appears in the wintry scene only to be held up by an outlaw whose cry of \"Hands Up\" is greeted by a huge outstretched hand which crushed him flat.\n\nCombining both visual and verbal stream of consciousness, parody - particularly of TV itself - taken to grotesque lengths (the game show skit \"Blackmail\") and an admirably tasteless plunder of everything from adverts to fine art, the Pythons were probably TV's first post-moderns.\n\nPYTHON's fourth and final (Cleeseless) television series came to an end in 1974, the year of their first film \"proper\". They never perceived their 1971 picture And Now For Something Completely Different as anything more than a string of sketches from the first two series reshot on 35mm. Monty Python And The Holy Grail, however, was a cinema original and was a considerable box-office draw at home and abroad. In the same year, 1974, the series itself finally appeared on American screens (on PBS in Texas, of all places).\n\nThe Pythons, meanwhile, continued to write and perform for the small screen. Cleese co-scripted and co-starred in FAWLTY TOWERS, which had its first run of six episodes in the following year, 1975, with a second run of a further six in 1979. Idle also got two runs for his RUTLAND WEEKEND TELEVISION (in 1975 and 1976) as well as a one-off success with THE RUTLES in 1978. Michael Palin and Terry Jones produced RIPPING YARNS, which had two short runs in 1977 and 1979 after the success of the \"pilot\" programme TOMKINSON'S SCHOOLDAYS.\n\nOf this post-PYTHON television work, while TOMKINSON'S SCHOOLDAYS and THE RUTLES are both brilliant one-offs, most of the rest remains relatively straightforward parody. From anyone else, much of it would have seemed stunning, but from the Pythons themselves it was something of a disappointment. FAWLTY TOWERS, indeed, towers over other post-PYTHON TV if only because of its successful combination of a pre-Pythonesque traditional sitcom format - indeed the idea derives from an episode Cleese wrote for the DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE in 1969 and comparison of the two is instructive - subjected to the excess and savagery of a PYTHON piece taken to its crazily illogical conclusion.\n\nSince the mid-Seventies, some of that savagery seems to have been replaced by a softer parodic tone - through this is more evident in the individual Pythons' own subsequent TV series than it is in the films, and particularly Life Of Brian. But for all the brilliant sequences in these cinema releases - and PYTHON was always at its most brilliant in certain sequences - the 30-minute format of TV better suited their strengths than feature-length.\n\nAnd this may not be unconnected to the fact that television was always one of the Pythons' main targets, while cinematic conventions have remained (by and large) untouched by their films, except obviously for the utterly brilliant cinema short Away From It All released to support Life Of Brian. Indeed, the conventional narrative structure of the features is a constraint on their invention and a return to the realism they had reacted so daringly against in television.\n\nThe impact of the Pythons on the rest of television has been enormously liberating yet oddly limiting. No other programme has put so many catchphrases into popular currency and yet at the same time offended so many of the assumptions of that populace. Like all innovations, the story of the Pythons' influence is also the story of their incorporation. Terry Jones has hosted book programmes, Michael Palin has presented a profile of railways and the occasionally Pythonesque, globetrotting documentary AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS, Cleese has co-authored a self-help book - all areas PYTHON would have savaged in sketches in the early Seventies. Meanwhile, Gilliam's graphic style has been greedily absorbed by the advertisers, and both Cleese and Idle have appeared in a number of different commercials. In fact, advertising seems the biggest inheritor of the PYTHON heritage.\n\nGilliam has directed for the cinema Jabberwocky, Time Bandits, Brazil and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Cleese scripted and starred in the monster hit A Fish Called Wanda and demonstrated his transatlantic appeal with an Emmy Award-winning appearance in the US sitcom CHEERS, Palin scripted Time Bandits and The Missionary for the big screen and EAST OF IPSWICH and NUMBER ONE for BBC-TV and acted in Time Bandits, The Missionary, A Private Function and A Fish Called Wanda.\n\nNot to be neglected, Terry Jones directed the films Personal Services and Eric [sic] The Viking, while Eric Idle turned up in a US ghost sitcom NEARLY DEPARTED and (coincidentally) a US TV mini-series of AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS (as Passepartout to Pierce Brosnan's Phileas Fogg). Graham Chapman wrote and starred in Yellowbeard and worked on a CBS-TV series JAKE'S JOURNEY. In 1989, Chapman met with a very untimely death at a very timely moment - the 20th anniversary of the TV debut of MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS. His contribution to the team was significant, and the honesty and dignity he showed in later years impressed even some of the mercenary tabloid newspapers.\n\nNow what for the Pythons? Their products are controlled by their own company, Prominent Features, creative control being crucial to them since the end of the original show. Indeed, they now own the rights to the TV series themselves. Cinema seems to be the arena for most of their future work, for MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS is no more. It has ceased to be. In spite of repeats, video sales and saloon-bar recitals, it is an ex-programme. And yet something has changed - the small screen landscape will never be the same again, and something is completely different today.\n\nIt used to be said - much to the Pythons' pleasure - that one effect of watching the programme was that it was impossible to take whatever followed seriously. It must have been equally difficult for those who produced the programme to follow it themselves. Considering the Pythons' particularly savage assault on al things British, their very success on the international market which made them suddenly and embarrassingly into a British institution could also have been their undoing. There can be no greater tribute than that sort of success - and no tougher act to follow. But if there is anyone in Britain equipped to come up with anything as inventive, it is still the Pythons themselves.\n\nThe Guardian, 10th August 1996, page 30\n\n[ An interview with Terry Jones, accompanied by the\n\nnow-traditional What Modern Comedians Think About\n\nPython piece which for some reason always sounds like\n\nthe stream-of-consciousness of a bunch of five years olds\n\n(\"And then the BBC didn't like them, and then they made\n\nsome films, and John Cleese was very tall, and I liked him,\n\nbut they weren't really very funny, but I liked the one where\n\nthe man dressed as the lady, and...\")]\n\nSOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT\n\nIt was 1969, we had got together as a team and starting writing sketches for a BBC series. All we needed was a name. A Horse, A Spoon, And A Basin was a runner for a while, but it wasn't quite right. My personal favourite was The Toad Elevating Moment, which arose from Graham Chapman's fevered brain. Mike Palin suggested something along the lines of Elsie Parfitt's Flying Circus, named after the woman who played the piano at Southwold Women's Guild. We finally decided on Bun, Wackett, Buzzard, Stubble and Boot.\n\nThen, just as the programme title was due to go in the Radio Times, the BBC said, sorry, it's too silly. They told us it had to be something Circus because that was the working title on the manuscripts. OK, John Cleese said, something slimy like a Python. Eric Idle decided we should have some name reminiscent of a seedy music hall entertainer, like Monty. I rushed home and told my brother that after months we had finally got ourselves a title, Monty Python's Flying Circus. He said it would never stick.\n\nThe Python team was split into two camps: Oxford and Cambridge. Mike and I had met at Oxford University and had started writing together for the BBC. Terry Gilliam became an honorary member of the Oxford team. John, Graham Chapman and Eric were the Cambridge team. We believed we could create the funniest show around, but we weren't quite sure how. John and Graham also wrote together, and in the early days they were responsible for the more cerebral, linguistic bits like the Parrot and Cheese Shop sketches. Mike Palin and I went for the sillier, more visual things like the Spanish Inquisition and Spam. But eventually we started parodying each other - for example we wrote a sketch naming all the stars in the Zodiac which was actually a piss-take of the parrot sketch - so you couldn't actually tell who had written what. Eric always wrote by himself: Wink, Wink, Nudge Nudge was typical Eric.\n\nThere was also a split about the form we thought the programme should take. The Cambridge team wanted a simple sketch show. The Oxford team wanted it to have a shape that would make it different. This elusive shape came to me one day after I'd watched a cartoon by Terry Gilliam in which one thing merged into another. We were also great admirers of the Goons, who showed us that we had been thinking in clichés, that sketches could start out one way and end up in a totally different, illogical place. I suppose we tried to exploit TV like the Goons did radio. Last but not least, Laurence Sterne was a great influence. In Tristram Shandy, he took a novel and buggered around with its form. One chapter, headed something like A Chapter In Which Nothing Happens, consisted of a couple of blank pages. Inspired.\n\nAlthough we worked in teams or individually, Python was collaborative, anarchic in the true sense, in that there was no one ruler. People say that John and I were fighting all the time, but I don't remember it like that. We'd argue about scripts, but we weren't fighting. By the end of the second series, John was bored, but we hadn't fallen out; he just wanted to do his own show.\n\nPerhaps it seems astonishing today that the BBC let us into their studios, but in the late sixties/early seventies there was a totally different climate. The producer was still the driving force and the BBC took pride in never censoring anything. The heads of programming never asked to see a show beforehand, and comment was reserved till the meeting after it had gone out. But even in the short lifespan of Python, we could see the culture changing. By the second series the heads wanted to see the shows before they went out, and by the third they even wanted to see the scripts.\n\nIt was a logical progression for us to make films like the Holy Grail. The trouble with TV is that you can't perform and be behind the camera at the same time. But we realised that to protect our material we'd have to direct.\n\nRecently, when I was making a documentary series about the Crusades it struck me how much the ancient chroniclers nicked from Python. We were filming in northern Syria when we discovered that in the 11th century one of the Crusader kings tried to impress on another leader how tough his men were by getting them to jump from the top the castle. Naturally, they all killed themselves. Pure Python.\n\nWould we do anything differently today? Well, perhaps we'd make it less boysy. I suppose Python was pretty sexist - Carol Cleveland was the token, occasional woman and she just played outrageous bimbos - but we didn't understand sexism then. We did try out actresses for bigger parts, but it always seemed funnier when I shoved on the old frock and raised my voice a few notches.\n\nPeople tell me that we made a hugely important contribution to the history of comedy, but I'm not so sure. Things always seem better, more important, in retrospect. While Python could attract nine million on a good day, a sitcom like Till Death Us Do Part could hit 20 million. The films were successful, but they were never blockbusters. What were we trying to achieve? Silliness. We tried to create something that was unpredictable, that had no parameters. Perhaps the fact that Pythonic is now in the dictionary is a measure of our failure.\n\nTerry Jones was talking to Simon Hattenstone. The 21st anniversary video of Monty Python And The Holy Grail with the \"missing 24 seconds\" is released on August 19\n\nPYTHON IN PERSPECTIVE\n\nSTUART [sic] LEE\n\nMonty Python was the promise of fifties, post-war, surrealist, Goons-type humour fulfilled on TV. They were important in a similar way to punk. Not many people copied them, but they opened up the possibilities. They abandoned punchlines, didn't satirise specific figures and used techniques from other artforms like Buñuel's films. There are only about four minutes in every episode which are less than terrible, but even when it doesn't work it is really admirable. They were hated at the time, the BBC never scheduled them properly, but now they are really proud of them. I don't think the programme would get made today.\n\nJACK DEE\n\nI've always thought of Monty Python as the Beatles of comedy because they liberated it. I know Cleese saw the Goons as being particularly influential, but I never found the Goons that accessible. Certainly the roots of my comic interests are firmly planted in the Python era, and I understood them even as a child. My favourite sketch is Lumberjack.\n\nFELIX DEXTER\n\nI loved the fact that they didn't perform \"jokes\", but rather, routines which were abstract. My favourite of the Python team was Eric Idle - it was obvious he wasn't a patrician who viewed comedy as an artform. I enjoyed the graphics they fused with the sketches, as they acted as a visual extension of their style. The main appeal of their humour was that it was childish, just plain silly.\n\nRHONA CAMERON\n\nThey were the first people to do an intellectual piss-take of British standards. By attacking middle-class uptightness which we're all subject to, they also took the piss out of themselves. Chris Morris is the best contemporary solution to what they were trying to do. Basically they were repressed public school boys giggling at sex. Mostly we don't need Oxbridge types on the circuit, they're a real pain, but they were the only ones to do the high brow stuff well. They were all talented and it was an unusually effective combination. I like it most when they play women because it's deadpan and not camp. The Grim Reaper sketch is great. What really, really irritates me is that they're always quoted by drunken students.\n\nDYLAN MORAN\n\nMonty Python made everybody who didn't think they were funny feel they should apologise for it. A lot of the sketches didn't work or were repetitive to the point that you wanted to shriek at the television. When they did work, they were poetry. And the laughter was often sudden, dark, hysterical. You felt grateful to them and their blessed perversions. They showed me it was possible to do exactly what you want before a mass audience. My favourite scene is John Cleese in the cheese shop chasing away the Greek dancers.\n\nMARK THOMAS\n\nMonty Python were very important but not as important as The Goons, who were more anarchic. Monty Python occupied a space that was made for them by the brilliance of The Goons and Peter Cook. They were funny because they were critically aware that they were biting the master's hand - taking the piss out of the people who had employed them. When I watched them back in the seventies there was the feeling that I was watching something a bit rebellious. The Life of Brian was almost a precursor to the Pistols - taking the piss out of religion.\n\nDOMINIC HOLLAND\n\nI'm not a huge Monty Python buff. Some episodes I don't find funny and some I don't get at all. There's a space in comedy now for people who are not that funny but are different and clever and it's PC to like them. Monty Python were the first to start this trend. But I do really like the Ministry of Funny Walks sketch because of its sheer absurdity. I'm a major John Cleese fan - his standards are impeccable and I think A Fish Called Wand was the best British comedy in 15 years.\n\nLYNN FERGUSON\n\nMonty Python opened up the sketch show format to include absurd, probably drug-induced things like knights and dragons. One of my favourites in Robin Hood stealing lupins - very bizarre. Everyone who was into evil, satanic music loved Monty Python. They used TV for comedy in a new way. What Dennis Potter did for drama on TV, Monty Python did for comedy, at a time when everyone else was going down the Morecombe & Wise road. Most people aren't clever enough to get away with \"intellectual\" comedy. They were apolitical, going after pure humour, with no subtext. They were funny first and clever afterwards. Everybody loves the Parrot sketch. You keep thinking they did this brilliant sketch and then you remember oh shit, they did that as well. It's a bit like that with Bob Dylan.\n\nJEFF GREEN\n\nThe Life of Brian is my favourite film of all time. I die laughing at the scene \"Are you the Judean People's Front? No, we're the People's Front of Judea.\" The British are world leaders of the surreal - think of Eddie Izzard, Reeves & Mortimer, The Young Ones. But when we face the Americans joke for joke, we're not that hot. Monty Python were the ultimate in surreal, quirky British humour. But they did make it big in America - the only other person who managed that was Benny Hill.\n\nInterviews: Justina Hart\n\nClassic Television, No. 4, April/May 1998, page 12-16\n\n[Classic Television magazine was a short-lived fanzine\n\ndevoted to television programmes. It was a bit amateur:\n\npoorly-written articles, grainy nicked-from-the-internet\n\nphotos, unpaid contributors, but they had a nice style,\n\ndevoting the back page of each issue to a \"Special Guest\n\nVillain\" such as Genial Harry Grout or Servalan, later\n\nreplaced by a page of humorous quotes from Blackadder\n\nor The Day Today. They didn't stick to the usual TV\n\nmagazine selling tactics, either: for example, when doing\n\nan article about Dr Who they would put a large picture of\n\nJohn Thaw on the cover instead. Actually, in retrospect,\n\nthis may have been why they sold so few copies. But they\n\ngave away videos of either Ripping Yarns or Boys From\n\nThe Blackstuff with every subscription for a while, which\n\nwas a nice gimmick. And I wrote an uneventful piece about\n\nThe Young Ones for them once, printed in their kinda-\n\nwidely-acclaimed British Comedy issue. They added an\n\nirrelevant intro about how I argued that The Young Ones\n\nwere the South Park of their day, which I didn't, and they\n\nonly said it to add drawings of Neil, Vyvvian, et al, dressed\n\nas the two-dimensional sweary puppets. And they added a\n\nbadly-done three-quarters of a page description of 'Nasty' to\n\nfill up space. Aah, I'm rambling now. The article, then:]\n\nTHE FULL MONTY\n\nAs the remaining members of Monty Python staged a one-off reunion and prepare for a tour next year, Paul Bamford assesses the impact of their comedy on British and world culture over the last 30 years.\n\nThe word phenomenon seems inadequate to describe what five Brits and one American set in motion almost three decades ago. Monty Python's Flying Circus was indeed 'something completely different' and anyone around in the late 1960s or early 1970s will tell you just what an impact it had on this country, and later the world.\n\nMonty Python inspired a whole new generation of comics and is still doing so today (where would Alexei Sayle, Steve Martin or Vic and Bob be without Python?). But how did it all happen and under what circumstances?\n\nIt is important to understand that Python wasn't created in a social or cultural vacuum. It has predecessors and influences, and definitely wouldn't have come about without important events in British history that changed the way we live and how we regarded our country.\n\nOne important factor was a gradual change in the authoritarian BBC and a willingness to experiment with more unusual forms of entertainment.\n\nIn their formative years, the Pythons were almost certainly exposed to post-war radio shows like Hancock and the Goons (this influence cannot be emphasised strongly enough, nor can Spike Milligan's later Q5 television series). And as the threat from commercial rival ITC (launched on 1955) began to hit home so the Beeb took more and more chances.\n\nThere was also the Suez crisis in 1956 in which Britain displayed a total ignorance of its place in world politics and embarrassed itself on a global scale. This ultimately led to an upsurge of what the press called 'the satire movement' when it became fashionable to knock leading British figures.\n\nInevitably, this came to a head in the swinging 60s when, after years of repression, there was suddenly a lot more freedom of expression. It was against this background that the Pythons emerged.\n\nThere can be no denying the importance of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in this story either. The British-born members all wound up in one or the other (with Terry Gilliam going to Occidental College, California - but later becoming an honorary member of Oxford).\n\nMichael Palin, the son of an engineer from Sheffield, went to Oxford to read history. There he met Welshman Terry Jones, who was already a notable figure on campus, and they formed a friendship. Palin was a keen actor and, like Jones, he loved to write what he performed.\n\nA play condemning capital punishment, Hang Down Your Head and Die, which Palin contributed to, was good enough to reach the West End and he also went with Jones to Edinburgh for the Oxford Revue in 1964.\n\nSimilarly, Somerset-born John Cleese, who went to Cambridge to read law, encountered his writing partner from the Midlands, Graham Chapman, while at college. Both got involved in the Footlights theatre club there, and after experiencing some success in the areas of performing and writing, Cleese decided he didn't want to be a lawyer and Chapman gave up a promising medical career.\n\nEric Idle, who hailed from County Durham, arrived at Cambridge in Cleese's last year, just after Chapman had left. Idle also got involved in Footlights and even became its president for a while.\n\nAll five went into television after leaving university. Jones and Palin wrote for the Frost Report (1966) and a series featuring John Bird and John Fortune. The pair then joined Eric Idle and David Jason for ITV's Do Not Adjust Your Set (1968), which in some respects can be seen as a dry run for Python.\n\nCleese delivered copy for That Was The Week That Was (1963), then he and Chapman joined the Frost Report where they met Palin and Jones. Cleese also worked with Marty Feldman on At Last, The 1948 Show (1967) and adapted Richard Gordon's novels for the small screen.\n\nThere are two theories about how the gang all came together. In the first, Barry Took, then a BBC comedy producer, gathered them together, adding a young cartoonist from the USA, Terry Gilliam, who'd worked for magazines like Help! and was relatively new to television.\n\nIn the second version of events, the Pythons approached the BC with the show and were then referred to Took. In this version, it was Eric Idle who insisted that Gilliam should provide the graphics and animation.\n\nHowever it happened, it was the catalyst for one of the funniest and most outrageous programmes television has ever witnessed. Such a mixture of talent and viewpoints resulted in a unique perspective on comedy.\n\nThe next step was to come up with a name for the thing. Several suitably surreal ones were suggested, including The Year of the Stoat and Owl Stretching Time (which eventually became the sub-title for the fourth episode of the first series).\n\nThere was some mention of Baron Von Took's Flying Circus and Palin rather liked the name Gwen Dibley, which he'd noticed in a newspaper. However, Monty Python had a more seedy appeal and so it was coupled with the 'Flying Circus' and a legend was born.\n\nTerry Gilliam devised the delightfully daft opening title sequence featuring the words springing out of red roses, various naked ladies, a cardinal on wheels, a man's head being pumped up until it explodes and, of course, the soon to be famous giant foot, stolen from Bronzino's Cupid, which drops down at the end to the sound of a 'raspberry'. It was all set to the distinctive tune of John Philip Sousa's Liberty Bell.\n\nThe team was given quite a free reign in what they wrote, unthinkable before the 1960s. John Howard Davies stepped into produce and direct the show, although he was replaced after the fourth programme by Ian MacNaughton.\n\nMonty Python's Flying Circus premiered on Sunday, October 5, 1969 on BBC1 in what had previously been a religious slot. The only warning the audience got was a mysterious listing in the Radio Times. Goodness knows what people thought when they initially encountered it.\n\nThe first episode, actually recorded second, contained a telling blend of items, giving a good indication of what to expect in future. Called Whither Canada, for reasons not explained, it started with Michael Palin's ragged man struggling to reach the seashore and then proclaiming: 'It's...' followed by Cleese's exaggerated vowels announcing 'Monty Python's Flying Circussss.'\n\nThe Pythons were an educated lot and their show reflected this. But references to 'high culture' (the arts, literature, classical music) rubbed shoulders with 'popular culture' (TV, film and advertising) and politics as well. There was also a fair amount of generally bizarre visual humour too.\n\nIn Whither Canada, for example, Mozart (Cleese) hosted his own TV show about famous deaths; Arthur 'two sheds' Jackson (Jones) attempted to talk about his symphony; and Picasso painted while on a bicycle.\n\nWe also had the Pepperpots (the Pythons in drag and talking in high pitched voices) who were taking the mickey out of Stork margarine adverts; a tutor trying to teach Italian to men from Napoli and Milan; the funniest joke in the world being used as a weapon in the Second World War; not to mention pigs being sat on and Terry Gilliam as a Viking.\n\nAs the series progressed, more and more Python staples were introduced to go with the Pepperpots and Chapman's interfering Colonel ('Stop that. It's silly.').\n\nThere was the well-dressed announcer; the knight with a chicken fetish; the Gumbies, complete with wellies and knotted hankies on their heads; comedy judges and lawyers; government officials; and Mr Praline (played by Cleese in a certain parrot sketch).\n\nIn addition, Python developed some regular formulae which it used many times over: Gilliam's fantastic cartoons breaking up the show; the interviewer situation; the office; parodies of TV shows; ending a sketch in an unexpected way - such as the dropping of a weight on somebody's head or having a choir suddenly burst into the room. And, although the guys often played female roles themselves, women like Carol Cleveland were introduced to add a touch of glamour to proceedings.\n\nUnfortunately, the BBC was slow to pick up on what it had discovered. It kept moving the show around and sometimes took it off-air altogether if there was a sporting event on.\n\nThis made it hard for Python to build up a regular base of viewers - but not impossible. By the end of the first series, audiences of three million were enough to give them a second go, this time with a more stable time slot (albeit at 10pm when regional programming took over).\n\nThank goodness the BBC persevered because the second series was the best ever with highlights such as the Spanish Inquisition, the Bruces and the sketch which was to become synonymous with Cleese - the Ministry of Silly Walks.\n\nImmediately afterwards, in 1970, the Pythons embarked on their first cinematic project. In an effort to promote their material abroad, especially in the United States, sketches from the first two series were remade for the big screen.\n\nShot over five weeks on a very low budget, the set-pieces didn't translate that well to the big screen and failed to elicit the desired response. The film only made a profit in the UK because the comedians were quite well known.\n\nAnnoyed at producer Victor Lownes' domination of the film and, no doubt, their small pay cheques, the team set up Python Productions. A number of albums and books followed with the Pythons exercising more control over what was on the market.\n\nBy the time the third series began in 1972, there was more tension than usual in the work place. Lord Hill had become chairman of the BBC and he was less liberal than his predecessor and more inclined to take note of Mary Whitehouse's National Viewers and Listener's Association. You can imagine what she made of Python and, for the first time, cuts looked inevitable. As if that wasn't enough, Cleese's first child, Cynthia, had just been born (he was married to American actress Connie Booth) and he resented the long hours he had to put in. He also felt that the team was repeating itself rather than producing something fresh and original. Cleese made it plain that he would tour with the group in 1973, but would not do a forth series.\n\nThe BBC, however, begged for more, so the show continued, but only for six episodes rather than the usual 13 and with BBC2 as its new home.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the fourth series was the worst, yet the last ever programme, broadcast on December 5, 1974, was a belter. It featured the course, but hilarious, most awful family in Britain; a doctor whose patients are stabbed by his nurse; and an appeal on behalf of the extremely rich.\n\nIronically, at the point of break up, the Pythons were becoming established overseas. In Germany, they'd done a special pilot and were very popular. Likewise in the United States, where the movie, And Now For Something Completely Different, had failed, small stations showing the series had succeeded. Though much later the team would end up taking the ABC network to court for re-editing their material, and they eventually gained copyright for their own programmes abroad.\n\nIn 1974, they made plans for another movie. But they vowed to have more say in its making. Palin's interest in history fuelled the idea of tackling the Arthurian legend in true Python fashion. Originally envisaged as a mix of the contemporary and the historical, with the Holy Grail being found in Harrod's, in the end it leant more towards the latter (except for the abrupt ending).\n\nCleese returned to the fold for Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and it was a huge hit. Gilliam and Jones shared directorial duties with the whole affair being filmed in the remote Scottish highlands where coconut halves were used instead of horses, Black Knights were armless and shouts of 'Ni' struck terror into defenceless old women.\n\nThe movie was so well received that they were encouraged to make another. The cinematic life suited them, allowing them to get together every so often but still do their own thing in between.\n\nUnfortunately, The Life of Brian, which told the story of how an ordinary bloke was mistaken for Christ, proved a major headache.\n\nFor a start, they were dealing with a touchy subject - religion is something almost everybody has an opinion on.\n\nAlthough it took a year to get to first draft level, the project appeared to be going well. It was backed by EMI to the tune of almost $5 million. But then EMI withdrew support because it feared a blasphemy prosecution.\n\nFormer Beatle George Harrison's Handmade Films stepped in and the project was revived. It was filmed on location in Tunisia under the direction of Terry Jones.\n\nAlthough the British Board of Film Classification passed the film without cuts in 1979, the Catholic Church blasted it and groups such as the Festival of Light caused a rumpus. It was banned in some areas, while others deemed it X-rated. On the other hand, the notoriety ensured it made money.\n\nThe next celluloid outing was Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982), which featured selected highlights from four live performances where the guys went through the motions once more. It had a limited theatrical screening but did well on video.\n\nThen the team gathered for one final film. Supported by Universal, the rather ambitiously titled Meaning of Life again saw Jones in the director's chair, although Gilliam contributed the prologue.\n\nThe film was basically a series of sketches which illustrated life as we know it, starting with birth, and ending with death, and covering most things in-between. Fans were not disappointed. Treats such as the Lionel Bart inspired Every Sperm Is Sacred and Mr Creosote (Jones) exploding in a restaurant after over eating helped it win the special jury prize at Cannes.\n\nIt is safe to say that Monty Python's Flying Circus went from a little known cult show to a fully fledged British institution in the space of 15 years. Yet it's strange to think that the team who did their level best to buck the system, to challenge the boundaries of comedy in absurd, and sometimes shocking, ways, have now become part of it themselves. It's almost as weird as the Python ethos itself.\n\nWith the death of Graham Chapman almost a decade ago, there can never be a complete Python reunion again - let alone another film. But this should only serve to make us appreciate all the more what they did achieve in their time together.\n\nLIVES OF PYTHON\n\nMichael Palin has rarely been out of the limelight since Python. He wrote, with Terry Jones, and starred in Ripping Yarns for BBC Television in the late 1970s and enjoyed a string of roles in films like Jabberwocky (1977, which he co-wrote), Brazil (1985), The Missionary (1981), A Private Function (1984), A Fish Called Wanda (1988) and American Friends (1991).\n\nHe also won critical acclaim as a headmaster in Alan Bleasdale's TV drama for Channel 4 GBH (1991). More recently, he has become the BBC's travelling man, with three series under his belt starting with Around the World in 80 Days. The man who made fun of Whicker Island so long ago has become a similar figure himself.\n\nTerry Jones has had his fingers in many pies, but his main passion is still writing. He penned a book about the Knight from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in the 1970s, produced a number of children's books including Fairy Tales (1981), and wrote the screenplay for the David Bowie film Labyrinth (1986). He also contributed a regular column for the Guardian.\n\nHe continued to direct, most notably with Erik the Viking (1989), an episode of the Indiana Jones saga (1991) and more recently The Wind in the Willows in which he also played Mr Toad.\n\nEveryone knows that John Cleese scored a big hit with his 1970s sitcom Fawlty Towers (he based Basil on a real hotelier the Pythons had once encountered). But he also went on to become a bona fide film star in the 1980s.\n\nHe was Robin Hood in Time Bandits (180), a loony army officer in Privates on Parade (1982), the sheriff in Hollywood's Silverado (1985), a panic-stricken headmaster in Clockwise (1985) and a stripping barrister in A Fish Called Wanda (1988) in which he starred alongside Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline. The Wanda team reunited last year for Fierce Creatures 'an equal not a sequel'.\n\nCleese has also had considerable success with his books Families and How to Survive Them and Life and How To Survive It.\n\nEric Idle went straight from Python to his weekly BBC2 parody Rutland Weekend Television with Neil Innes. He then hosted Saturday Night Live in the United States which led to a spoof Beatles documentary, the Rutles, with Dan Akroyd and John Belushi. Film appearances include Nuns on the Run (1990) and Splitting Heirs (1993).\n\nHis musical talent has also served him well. More than a decade after the Life of Brian, his song Always Look On the Bright Side of Life reached number one in the network charts. He also played Ko-Ko in Jonathan Miller's production of the Mikado and sang the theme tune to One Foot In The Grave.\n\nCo-directing Monty Python and the Holy Grail was frustrating for Terry Gilliam, so it wasn't really surprising that he struck out on his own to direct Jabberwocky. This brought him only limited success but he did better with Time Bandits. In 1985 he directed the excellent science fiction fantasy Brazil, having to fight to keep the downbeat ending in the final cut. Making the Adventures of Baron Munchausen was even tougher and the movie flopped. Working from a script by Richard Lagravenese gave him his most financially rewarding film - the Robin Williams urban fairy tale The Fisher King (1991). A native of Britain for the last 30 odd years, he still visits America often, especially when making a movie such as his last hit 12 Monkeys with Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt.\n\nAfter Graham Chapman announced at a party that he was gay, he subsequently co-founded Gay News in 1972 and became a champion of the gay liberation scene.\n\nAlcohol problems in the mid-1970s nearly killed him although he shook off the addiction by the end of the decade. After Python, he starred in the Odd Job with Carolyn Seymour, worked on the pirate movie Yellowbeard, which failed because of the death of its star Marty Feldman, and wrote the semi-autobiographical A Liar's Autobiography which spliced together fantasy and reality. He died of throat cancer in 1989 on the eve of the 20th anniversary of Python.\n\nTOP TEN PYTHON SKETCHES\n\n1. The Dead Parrot...
