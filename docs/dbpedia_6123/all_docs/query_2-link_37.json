        "text": "The master of the amusing insult, Blackadder first hit screens 40 years ago. Rowan Atkinson’s creation may not have been an instant hit, but following the 1986 broadcast of Blackadder II, it really took off.\n\nWhile it has previously been issued on DVD, the complete Blackadder has yet to enjoy a Blu-ray release. That is about to change on November 27th, however, with the release of Blackadder: The Complete Collection. A 7-disc collection running to 20 hours and 53 minutes, Blackadder: The Complete Collection features every broadcast episode, along with Blackadder’s Christmas Carol, Blackadder: The Cavalier Years, and Blackadder Rides Again.\n\n(At this time, there is no word as to whether the 2023 special Blackadder: The Lost Pilot will be included, but it has not yet been confirmed. Also missing is Blackadder: Back & Forth, produced for the opening of the Millenium Dome in 1999.)\n\nThe included episodes have been upscaled where possible and film inserts remastered “where available.” Special features, meanwhile, are a mix of standard and high definition.\n\nBelow are the confirmed contents:\n\nThe Blackadder\n\nStarring Rowan Atkinson as Edmund Duke Of Edinburgh with Tony Robinson as Baldrick, Brian Blessed as King Richard IV, Tim McInnerny as Percy, Elspet Gray as the Queen and Robert East as Prince Harry WITH Peter Cook as Richard III, Miriam Margolyes as Princess Maria, Rik Mayall as Mad Gerald. Music by Howard Goodall, Directed by Martin Shardlow, Produced by John Lloyd.\n\nBlackadder II\n\nStarring Rowan Atkinson as Lord Blackadder with Tony Robinson as Baldrick, Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy, Miranda Richardson as Queenie, Stephen Fry as Lord Melchett and Patsy Byrne as Nursie WITH Rik Mayall as Flashheart, Tom Baker as Captain Rum, Ronald Lacey as the Bishop, Miriam Margolyes as Lady Whiteadder, Hugh Laurie as Ludwig. Music by Howard Goodall, Directed by Mandie Fletcher, Produced by John Lloyd.\n\nBlackadder The Third\n\nStarring Rowan Atkinson as Edmund Blackadder with Tony Robinson as Baldrick, Hugh Laurie as The Prince Regent and Helen Atkinson-Wood as Mrs Miggins WITH Robbie Coltrane as Dr Samuel Johnson, Chris Barrie as a French revolutionary, Stephen Fry as the Duke of Wellington. Music by Howard Goodall, Directed by Mandie Fletcher, Produced by John Lloyd.\n\nBlackadder Goes Forth\n\nStarring Rowan Atkinson as Capt. Edmund Blackadder, Tony Robinson as Pte. S Baldrick, Stephen Fry as Gen. Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett, Hugh Laurie as Lt. The Hon George Colthurst St. Barleigh , Tim McInnerny as Capt. Kevin Darling. WITH Rik Mayall as Squadron Commander Lord Flasheart, Adrian Edmondson as Baron von Richthoven, Miranda Richardson as Nurse Mary, Geoffrey Palmer as Field Marshal Dougie Haig. Music by Howard Goodall, Directed by Richard Boden, Produced by John Lloyd.\n\nBlackadder The Specials:\n\nBlackadder’s Christmas Carol\n\nStarring Rowan Atkinson as Sir Edmund Blackadder and Tony Robinson as Baldrick WITH Stephen Fry as King Charles I, Warren Clarke as Oliver Cromwell. Music by Howard Goodall, Directed by Mandie Fletcher, Produced by John Lloyd.\n\nThe Cavalier Years\n\nStarring Rowan Atkinson as Sir Edmund Blackadder and Tony Robinson as Baldrick WITH Stephen Fry as King Charles I, Warren Clarke as Oliver Cromwell. Music by Howard Goodall, Directed by Mandie Fletcher, Produced by John Lloyd.\n\nBlackadder Rides Again\n\nan hour documentary produced to mark the 25th anniversary with filming locations in Northumberland, Cheltenham and California. Narrated by John Sergeant, Directed & Produced by Matt O’Casey.\n\nAs you can see, this is a must-have for any Blackadder fan, and while there are some omissions, it seems to be the ideal Christmas gift (albeit one that won’t easily fit inside Baldrick’s stocking).\n\nPersonally, I cannot wait – I’m hoping to unwrap this on Christmas morning (pending a visit from the Spirit of Christmas), or perhaps my December birthday.\n\nYou can pre-order Blackadder: The Complete Collection on Amazon now."
