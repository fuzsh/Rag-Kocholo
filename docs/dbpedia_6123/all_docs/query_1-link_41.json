        "text": "Blackadder writer and actor Ben Elton has confirmed that the iconic sitcom will not be coming back.\n\nThere had been rumours in recent months of a reboot or reunion series but Elton, who co-wrote the last three seasons, has confirmed that there are no cunning plans to resurrect the show.\n\nRead more: Blackadder to return after 20 years for Comic Relief special\n\nSpeaking at the BAFTAs to Radio Times, Elton said: \"No, Blackadder's not coming back.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're all still very good friends, all of us, genuinely. And I think one of the reasons for that is that we don't do a Blackadder. There's been a couple of half-arsed bits and pieces... and I think they've been pretty s*** to be honest.\"\n\nElton made clear that he appreciated the success of the series but had moved on: \"Basically, you know, we did something surprisingly special, nobody had the slightest idea that it would resonate and land the way that it did.\n\n\"Of course not, you can't plan for any success or failure. I think it's best to leave it where it was, we're all a lot older and doing a lot of other things.\"\n\nBlackadder did make something of a return earlier this year for a special Comic Relief sketch that featured Tony Robinson reprising the role of Baldrick.\n\nThe brief sketch, which was organised by Richard Curtis but had no involvement from Elton or Rowan Atkinson, led to many fans hoping a proper reunion would happen especially after the BBC said they would be open to the idea.\n\nBlackadder originally ran from 1983 to 1989 on the BBC with brief reunions following in 2000, 2012 and 2023.\n\nThere has been constant speculation since the end of the show that a new series will be made with potential settings listed as Colditz, the Russian Revolution and the JFK assassination.\n\nRobinson has appeared the most keen to revive the show whereas Elton, Atkinson, Curtis and fellow star Stephen Fry have played down the idea of doing a special or more episodes."
