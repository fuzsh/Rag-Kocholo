        "text": "The BBC's blackest comedy villain ... but where to next? Photograph: BBC\n\nI don't know about you, but, as George the Prince Regent would say; I'm as happy as a Frenchman who's invented a pair of self-removing trousers. I think. Put it this way, Blackadder, the greatest Britcom of my lifetime, could be returning. As he does every few years, Tony Robinson told Teletext this week that there was every chance that the cast would be reuniting soon for a special series to mark 25 years since Blackadder II: \"We've always had a fantasy about doing it again in 2010, so we'll be having that conversation soon. I would love to do it and suspect Rowan Atkinson would too.\"\n\nIt's the last bit that means maybe we should believe it this time. Robinson's obviously wanted to do it for years, but the major sticking point has always been Rowan Atkinson himself. If he's melting to the idea, then it's a very real possibility.\n\nIt's a tough one. The sequence at the end of the first world war-set Blackadder Goes Forth, where they go over the top and are instantly wiped out by bullets, the screen fading into poppy fields, goes down as one of the most emotionally brutal scenes TV scenes I can ever remember on television, let alone on a comedy. When you've had a full stop like that, it's dangerous to go back. But can you blame everyone involved for wanting one last hurrah?\n\nWhat's strange is that they're planning this to mark 25 years since Blackadder II. The silver anniversary of a sequel?! Okay, so the series didn't truly hit its stride until Edmund's adventures in the court of Queen Elizabeth I. Indeed, in the first series, Baldrick was actually the clever one (albeit still just a stinky), but that's not to say the first series, The Black Adder, should be erased from history.\n\nAnyway. This isn't the first they've attempted a slight return of the Slack Bladder. The only useful thing about the Millennium Dome first time round was its use in the special Blackadder Back and Forth episode, screened on y2k night and then later on Sky One, when a modern day descendent built a time machine as a con trick which surprisingly ended up working.\n\nAnd ideas for a fifth series have been floated on and off ever since. Most popular for years was a 1960s version, wherein Edmund headed up a rock band called the Black Adder Five complete with hairless drummer Bald Rick.\n\nA space-faring Star Adder has been touted, and while they would no doubt find a way to make it brilliant - somehow - that smells like a jumping the shark moment to me. Almost as much as the other fantasy-themed idea doing the rounds, Batadder. Being a historical comedy is part of Blackadder's furniture, that just feels like moving it around too much.\n\nAs recently as last year, Atkinson was denying that a reunion would ever happen, but revealed one-time plans for another idea, for a film version set during the Russian revolution called The Red Adder. \"He would have been a lieutenant in the Secret Police. Then the revolution happened and at the end he is in the same office doing the same job, but just the colours on the uniform have changed. It was quite a sweet idea and we got quite a long way with it but in the end it died a death.\"\n\nMore plausible perhaps, is a Colditz-set series where they're all prisoners of war. Atkinson, always the least keen to do another series, is on record as saying, \"That would have the right level of authority and hierarchy which is apparent in all the Blackadders.\"\n\nSo what's a time-hopping nobleman to do? Is this a plan so cunning you could brush your teeth with it, or is it as thick as the big print version of the Complete Works of Charles Dickens?\n\nWhich period would you like to see a new Blackadder set in? And, with Hugh Laurie so busy and so successful with House, could it ever be the same without him? If you come back with the information, Captain Darling will pump you thoroughly in the debriefing room..."
