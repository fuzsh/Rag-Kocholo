        "text": "Sir Tony Robinson has been praised for his return as Baldrick from Blackadder for a bedtime story on Comic Relief.\n\nThe actor, 76, reprised his role from the BBC sitcom - which aired from 1983 until 1989 - earlier this evening, reading a script by the original show's writer Richard Curtis, 66.\n\nIt saw the character read an alternative version of the fairytale Cinderella - which was named Baldarella - alongside illustrations which visualised elements of the plot.\n\nTony - who last played an incarnation of the character in the short film Blackadder: Back & Forth, which was released in 1999 - has been praised by viewers over his performance.\n\nBlackadder fans took to Twitter to share their thoughts on it, with one writing: \"That was joyous! [Tony] hasn't lost it and still gives a brilliant performance as Baldrick.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I've missed Baldrick! Love the storytime.\" A third said: \"The Baldrick bedtime story was ace.\" Whilst one said: \"You have got to love Baldrick. I miss Blackadder\".\n\nOthers agreed, with one writing: \"How I've missed Baldrick. Tony Robinson take a bow\". Another commented about it: \"That was a nice way to give us something new.\"\n\nExpressing a similar sentiment on the platform, another viewer praised: \"Take a bow, Tony Robinson! 40 years playing the same character - well, sort of - is not to be sniffed at.\"\n\nAnd some said they want to now rewatch the original series, with one tweeting: \"Crying with laughter. Need to rewatch Blackadder\". Another said: \"Excellent! Loved [it]\".\n\nNot everyone was as keen though, with it having been described as \"dated,\" \"boring\" and \"unfunny\" by some other viewers. One person said: \"Some things are best left alone.\"\n\nTony recently spoke about the first time he read the script for Baldrick's return, with him sharing the reaction that himself and his wife Louise Hobbs had over the writing of it.\n\nThe actor revealed: \"We just both thought it was hysterically funny.\" He further commented: \"As soon as I started reading it, the character came back. It was wonderful.\"\n\nComic Relief is on BBC One and BBC iPlayer tonight.\n\nDo you have a story to sell? Get in touch with us at webcelebs@mirror.co.uk or call us direct 0207 29 33033."
