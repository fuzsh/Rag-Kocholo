        "text": "This paper starts by claiming that the amount of narrative time is one of the distinctive features by virtue of which TV series are treated as a self-standing appreciative kind in contemporary culture. As suggested by Jason Mittell, time is constitutive of TV seriality: \" a series is a cumulative narrative that builds over time \" and also \" time is an essential element of all storytelling but is even more crucial for television \" or \" seriality itself is defi ned by its use of time \" 1. There are so many contemporary series considered experimental in time structure that, as Melissa Ames puts it, \" although temporal play has existed on the small screen prior to the twenty-fi rst century […] never before has narrative time played such an important role in mainstream television \" 2. We will argue that this vast amount of time can confl ict with the structural constraints of formulaic narrative, especially from an Aristotelian perspective according to which a narrative is inherently a knot to be untied. More specifi cally, according to Aristotle, \" Every tragedy is in part Complication and in part Denouement; the incidents before the opening scene, and often certain also of those within the play, forming the Complication; and the rest the Denouement \". We will show that, with respect to this issue, contemporary TV series primarily face two options, which we will call the super-knot and the super-knotty rope. We will argue that these two options are not suffi cient in order to fi ll the TV series' amount of time. Further fi lling strategies are needed. We will present what we consider the two main fi lling strategies in contemporary TV series, namely the fl ash strategy 3 and the strand strategy 4. Finally, we will argue that these strategies can raise issues that risk to make the narrative experience of contemporary TV series less valuable. We will do so with particular reference to heavily serialized shows both in US and in Europe.\n\nThe paper investigates the ways Shakespeare’s oeuvre, with its reputation for a universal adaptability that embraces all media and contexts, finds its way into a serial structure that is the dominant form of visual performance today. In order to see whether this seems at all possible, the paper examines the most recent television series, Star-Crossed, in which the original Shakespearean narrative unit (Romeo and Juliet) is broken up into several episodes, thus adopting the most popular televisual genre of our time. The paper argues that this fragmentation of the original narrative whole fits into the contemporary cultural tendencies of textual poaching, snatching quotations and (re)placing them in seemingly random contexts, often with a complete ignorance of original meanings and contextual frameworks, but applying them to whichever means seems favourable for the adaptors. At the same time, it also appears that the dramatic original does not lend itself easily to serialisation, and notwithstanding the conscious decisions on the part of the creators to embed the series into the topical, stylistic, generic and aesthetic contexts of contemporary television, the failure of the enterprise comes as no surprise.\n\nFaërian Drama is a term developed by J.R.R. Tolkien in his essay “On Fairy-stories,” which he describes as plays which the elves present to men, with a “realism and immediacy beyond the compass of any human mechanism,” where the viewer feels he is “bodily inside its Secondary World” but instead is “in a dream that some other mind is weaving” (63-64). Smith of Wootton Major is a prime example from his own writing; other examples of the genre include A Christmas Carol or the movie Groundhog Day. When we read or view a work containing an example of faërian drama, we add a metafictional layer to the story: we are (or become) aware that the actor or character is experiencing the faërian drama, and part of our engagement as an audience rests in the tense anticipation of whether the character will realize she is in a faërian drama or not. A number of episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer exhibit some characteristics of faërian drama: for example, “The Wish” (3.9) takes Cordelia into a world where Buffy never came to Sunnydale; “The Replacement” (5.3) lets Xander see what his life might be life without his insecurities; in “Hell’s Bells” (6.16) Xander is granted a distorted vision of his future life with Anya, and Anya experiences an opposing vision in “Selfless” (7.5). In this talk I will concentrate on “Normal Again” (6.17), a problematic episode which takes the Faërian drama idea in unexpected directions. Buffy is presented as an institutionalized mental patient lost in delusions of being the Slayer and being pressured to give up this fantasy life and join the “real” world. The ambiguity of the ending presents an unusual twist: the participant in the faërian drama chooses to stay within the fantasy world.\n\nIn my paper I examine 24 (2001–2010, Fox), a contemporary TV show, which gained high critical and public attention thanks to its narration technique. In my view, this technique has its roots in classical television narration, so the discussion starts with an introduction, in which the rules of traditional television narratives are summarised. After discussing the most important terms, such as series/serials, narration, schedule, fl ow, etc. the concept of the host is introduced. It is the narrator of documentaries and news, but some TV shows have hosts as well. Traditionally, the presence of such an on screen and/or voice-over narrator leads to disbelief, because it points out the fi ctional character of the story. Each episode of 24 can be divided into two parts: the recap with its homodiegetic voice-over host/ narrator (the protagonist, Jack Bauer), who updates the viewer; and the show itself which is transmitted from another, invisible narration level. Why does this discrepancy not affect our trust in the presented possible word? How can the show unite former distinct categories? What could have been the secret of 24’s rise and failure? What is the role of Jack? These questions will be examined in my essay."
