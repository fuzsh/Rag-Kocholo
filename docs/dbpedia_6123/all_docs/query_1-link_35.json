        "text": "It was good to see a clip of the final scene of Blackadder Goes Forth doing the rounds on Twitter last week. If the thousands of likes and positive comments are anything to go by, the series clearly still resonates warmly with the public over 30 years after it was first broadcast in 1989. But not everyone’s a fan. Indeed, the show is something of a perennial bugbear for historians and other commentators who feel British people fundamentally misunderstand the First World War. Gary Sheffield’s hugely insightful 2001 book, Forgotten Victory, opens with a discussion of the series in which the author rightly notes that Blackadder ‘reflected and reinforced the majority of the public’s views and emotions about the Great War.’ Prof. Sheffield is a sort of revisionist’s revisionist and there’s a great deal of truth in his critique. The adventures of Capt. Edmund Blackadder and his comrades were a comedic and thus very potent expression of the ‘lions led by donkeys’ myth, which has been around in one form or another since the war itself but really crystalised during the 1960s. In this vision of the conflict, the British campaign on the Western Front was conducted with supreme incompetence by Douglas Haig and the other generals, who were brutally callous with the lives of their men. The staff officers in Blackadder are certainly portrayed as incompetent and callous, and, as Sheffield points out, the series’ portrayal of British strategy and tactics ‘is funny because everybody ‘knows’ that British generals were incompetent and their battles were invariably bloody failures’. And he is by no means the only military historian to take issue with the series. Max Hastings has dismissed the popular perception of the war as ‘the Blackadder take on history’, and the late Richard Holmes decried the extent to which ‘Blackadder’s aphorisms have become fact’.\n\nBlackadder Goes Forth has also been invoked in political commentary on public perceptions of the past. In an article anticipating the centenaries of the war that was published in the Daily Mail in January 2014, Michael Gove was scathing about what he regarded as the apparently dominant ‘Blackadder’ version of the war, which portrays the conflict as a ‘misbegotten shambles’ and thus denigrates the ‘patriotism, honour and courage’ of the fallen. Gove was Secretary of State for Education at the time and his article was essentially an attack on the way history is taught in British secondary schools. His comments quickly met with robust responses from his Labour counterpart, Tristram Hunt, and a range of other prominent commentators, including historians Richard Evans and Antony Beevor. Tony Robinson, who played Pte. Baldrick in the series, also weighed in, passionately defending British teachers. This particular quarrel has now been forgotten, but it reveals the degree to which ‘Blackadder’ has become short-hand in certain quarters for a crude misunderstanding of the ‘war to end all wars’. In very broad terms, the debate divides those who regard the war as a bloody but necessary conflict in which British servicemen heroically achieved a great victory and those who see the war as little more than a futile exercise in mass slaughter.\n\nAnd yet despite often heated disagreements about the meaning of the 1914 – 1918 conflict, and the persistence of the view that the war was futile, there is remarkable consensus in Britain that the war dead should be remembered with reverence and respect. Even groups that have been very critical of the official, government-driven culture of commemoration, such as the Stop the War Coalition and the No Glory in War Campaign, have stopped short of suggesting that the dead should not be honoured. And this is where Blackadder Goes Forth offers some valuable – and usually overlooked – insights into the British relationship with the First World War. The tension in the British memory of the war is quite unmistakable in the shift in tone we see in the final scene of the six-part series. For five and a half episodes, the series brilliantly lampooned the British war effort, and then, in the last ten minutes of the final episode, it paid a remarkably sincere and poignant tribute to the men who lost their lives on the Western Front. As Dan Todman notes in his own revisionist classic, The Great War: Myth and Memory, the closing scene rather undermines the more irreverent and cynical mood of the rest of the series. It is as though the writers, Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, felt that they couldn’t in conscience make a television show about the war, no matter how satirical, without ultimately honouring the dead.\n\nAnd the final scene is indeed moving. All of the main characters, with the exception of General Melchett, clamber over the parapet and advance heroically into German machine-gun fire. A slow, haunting piano plays the theme music in lieu of the brassy marching band of previous episodes, and, in the end, the image of the fallen heroes in 1917 fades to a tranquil scene of the Western Front in ‘our own time’, accompanied by the sound of birdsong. It’s an undeniably well-crafted piece of television. Yet, in much of the commentary on the scene, one of its most poignant and revealing elements is usually overlooked. The clip currently circulating on Twitter begins as Blackadder and Baldrick and the rest of the characters step into the trench and prepare to go ‘over the top’. In the originally-broadcast version, however, this moment is preceded by an unusual exchange in the dug-out between Blackadder and Capt. Darling:\n\nCapt. Blackadder: How are you feeling, Darling?\n\nCapt. Darling: Erm, not all that good, Blackadder – rather hoped I’d get through the whole show; go back to work at Pratt & Sons; keep wicket for the Croydon gentlemen; marry Doris … Made a note in my diary on my way here; simply says, ‘Bugger’.\n\nCapt. Blackadder: Well, quite.\n\nI honestly think you’d struggle to find a more moving passage in the whole canon of post-1960s First World War fiction. The scene is played with real pathos and feeling by Tim McInnerney and Rowan Atkinson and its power is heightened by the fact that their characters have been arch-enemies for the rest of the series. In the other episodes, Capt. Darling is a toadying junior staff-officer, skulking about in the regimental HQ, a foil for Blackadder’s cutting wit; now he finds himself very much at the sharp end. His wistful lament for the life he thought he’d live after the war is all the more poignant because this formerly unappealing character now has his back against the wall. His words also seem to capture what must have been a common state of mind for the men who fought and died during the war. ‘Rather hoped I’d get through the whole show’ would be a fitting epitaph for any number of the dead.\n\nWhen I discuss this scene with my public history students each year, I also encourage them to consider Darling’s fiancé, Doris. She’s a fictional character, mentioned in passing in a sitcom, but she arguably represents all those left behind when their loved ones failed to return from the front. And her predicament is more relatable to most of us today than that of the men who served on the Western Front and in the other theatres of war. None of us will have to fight in an industrialised war, and few of us will experience military service. Yet all of us will suffer loss and know bereavement. The pain of grief is a fairly universal experience, and in it we can empathise with our ancestors more than we sometimes appreciate. Blackadder Goes Forth does not of course tell us much about the military dynamics of the First World War. Yet in reflecting the tension in Britain’s relationship with the conflict, and dramatically evoking the fate of the men who fought and died, the series offers us some genuinely valuable insights."
