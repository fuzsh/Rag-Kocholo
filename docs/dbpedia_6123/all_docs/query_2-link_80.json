        "text": "A draft script for a Christmas episode of Blackadder has come to light during research for a new book about the BBC's classic comedy series.\n\nBlackadder in Bethlehem sees Rowan Atkinson's character as the owner of the inn where Joseph and Mary seek a bed for the night.\n\nThe story also features Baldrick, the Three Kings - and a talking turkey.\n\nWritten in 1988, the script was given to comedy historian Jem Roberts by writer Richard Curtis.\n\nRoberts describes it as \"completely unofficial Blackadder\".\n\nFragments of the unfinished script appear in his book, The History of the Black Adder, which is published later this week.\n\nIn the book, Curtis says that he abandoned the idea \"for fear it would cause too much offence\".\n\nInstead, it was the Dickensian-themed Blackadder's Christmas Carol that went into production, and was broadcast on 23 December 1988.\n\nBlackadder ran for four series between 1983 and 1989, starring Atkinson as Blackadder and Tony Robinson as his dogsbody Baldrick.\n\nThere were also some stand-alone stories, the last of which was Blackadder: Back and Forth in 1999.\n\n\"When you write a book about a comedy world, there is a dream that you'll be invited into this Ali Baba's cave of unbelievable archive material,\" Roberts told the BBC. \"I always presumed that would never be the case with Blackadder.\"\n\nBut Roberts was amazed when he was handed the previously unseen script while interviewing Curtis at his offices in Notting Hill.\n\n\"He printed out a document from his computer and said, 'see what you want to do with this'.\n\n\"My jaw dropped when I saw I was holding a lost Blackadder script.\n\nRoberts added: \"He wrote on the script that one of the reasons it didn't get used was because it was a strange cross between Fawlty Towers and Life of Brian.\n\n\"He didn't think he was going to make it compare to either of them. That's his reason for it never getting any further than it did.\""
