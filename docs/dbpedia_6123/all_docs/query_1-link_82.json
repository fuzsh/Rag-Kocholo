        "text": "June 15th is the 40th anniversary of one of the funniest TV series of all time, The Black Adder starring Rowan Atkinson. It’s a historical period comedy set in various eras where Blackadder tries to become rich, gain power, and not die, and not necessarily in that order. It even made life in the trenches of WWI funny. To celebrate they did a cunning plan and snuck a painting of him into a gallery to the confusion of some visitors.\n\nI watched this show in its entirety for the first time last fall, and OMG, it is so brilliant.\n\nBut if you told me I could keep only Hugh Laurie OR Miranda Richardson, my brain would fry.\n\n(And then I’d pick Queenie.)\n\nThe first Blackadder I saw was Blackadder: Back And Forth. Then I went back and watched the whole series. So much comic genius, but also so much emotion.\n\nAnd the ending of that final series gets me every time.\n\nWarning - you’re crying, I’m crying, we’re all crying at this one…\n\nLooks like Hulu and Britbox are currently streaming the series (Blackadder).\n\n__\n\n“To you, Baldrick, the Renaissance was just something that happened to other people, wasn’t it?”\n\n“You’re that man who used to be funny!” related Tony Robinson on Time Team, said by someone who recognized him from Blackadder."
