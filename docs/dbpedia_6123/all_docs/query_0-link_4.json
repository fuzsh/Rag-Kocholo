        "text": "Alone in the chapel of hope on Christmas Eve Reverend Bernice hates Christmas,since her mother was carried off by Papa Lazarou disguised as Santa Claus when she was a child. She has three visitors. The first is Charlie Hull,convinced from his recurring nightmare that his wife Stella is using a voodoo coven called the Solutions to stop him winning the line-dance contest. Then an old man who visited Herr Lipp and his wife in 1975 recounts the saga of Lipp's fascination with cute young choirboy Matthew and his belief that Lipp was a vampire. Finally Chinnery comes to unburden himself as to why he is such a bad vet. In Victorian times his great-great-grandfather,the finest vet in England,came to Royston Vasey but was tricked into touching the wrong monkey's testicle,as a result of which all succeeding vets in the family have been cursed. Bernice feels happier after consoling Chinnery but she is unaware that history is about to repeat itself.\n\nViolet Moon (Dame Eileen Atkins) wants to be in control of the circumstances and people in her life. Particularly her son and daughter-in-law who she discovers are considering selling the farm where she has known some of the happiest times of her life. Violet's control is not only threatened by their decision, but also by the sudden reappearance of someone from her past whom she meets at a local spiritualists club. Someone who has the potential to resurrect a long buried secret as well expose her current plot to put a stop to the sale of the farm. When Violet takes the opportunity to silence this person, she doesn't consider that enemies have friends.\n\nAliens in human form land on Earth to carry out a secret mission, and when the Supervisor is decapitated, the two bumbling Cadets have no idea what the mission entails. With a mixture of their of own language, and mannerisms taken from old 50s movies, they try and get through the crazy world we live in, without trying to get caught by the various shady organisations after them.\n\nFather Sherko (Sherko Zen-Aloush) is increasingly concerned that his daughter Resa (Benae Hassan) is getting sick. Presenting themselves at the hospital they encounter a number of asylum seekers from their block, all demonstrating similar symptoms. At first it looks like an epidemic of flu, but soon it appears to be something infinitely more sinister. Quickly the civil and emergency services are beyond breaking point and it emerges that the authorities are powerless to halt this disaster. When Asylum Support Unit worker Rabeena Dhondy (Robina Qureshi) arrives at Sherko and Resa's flat she finds the little girl is suffering from an extremely bad cough. At the hospital, the doctor Annie Millbrook (Morag Calder) diagnoses flu. Shortly afterwards one of the Resa's neighbours Hamez (Salah Hussein) dies from what the hospital are still calling flu. Quite naturally the asylum seekers are getting worried and a meeting is arranged with them by the hospital. Robina arrives at Sherko and Resa's block of flats to find ash swirling around like a fine snow. Robina goes straight to see Brian Cooper. Back at the hospital it looks as if Resa and a number of the other patients are feeling much better. Doctor Annie Millbrook is suspicious though..."
