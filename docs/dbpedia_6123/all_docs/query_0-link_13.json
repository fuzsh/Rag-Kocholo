        "text": "\"Not only inexperienced, but also massively inept\" – Me, 2004\n\n60,000 words on sitcoms, sketch shows and stand-up DVDs, mostly written when I was still at school, if you somehow require this information.\n\nWritten for dooyoo.co.uk from 2000–2010 (aged 14–24).\n\nTop Ten TV Programmes...Ever!\n\nTop 10 Comedy Programmes... so far\n\nWritten on 09.06.04\n\nAs the Guide for TV category, it stands to reason that I have an interest in looking at cathode ray tubes changing colour, although I wouldn’t describe myself as a casual television watcher. No. When I like a programme, I really LIKE it, and this is the principle aspect of my viewing life that must be made clear. (Aside from BBC Three’s ‘The Mighty Boosh,’ which I’m fairly indifferent to).\n\nI’m a fan of some science fiction programmes – not a casual fan of the genre, but a fan of specific shows, remember – but my first love has always been comedy. Even when I was a baby I found it highly amusing to watch my father cover his eyes and then reveal them again, and I remember taking a great deal of pleasure in watching holiday camp entertainers ‘accidentally’ falling into swimming pools with their clothes on. Obviously I have grown and my tastes have adapted, apart from that pool thing, and over the years I have taken delight and comfort in various television programmes, mostly but not exclusively British. This is my top ten of entertaining and personally influential comedy shows from my life so far.\n\n1. LEE AND HERRING (Fist of Fun / This Morning With Richard, Not Judy)\n\nNot specifically the funniest comedians, but the relatively obscure comedy duo of Stewart Lee and Richard Herring produced two television series which attracted a legion of incredibly devoted fans and which, along with their earlier radio work, soon gained a cult status. Thanks to the infinite wisdom of BBC controllers of the age, this cult status was never allowed to extend into genuine fame due to the complete lack of repeats issued.\n\n‘Fist of Fun’ ran for two series of six episodes in a late night slot on BBC 2, and was proposed as a show concerning lifestyle tips. In reality, it was a way for the comedians to use successful stand-up routines based on their deliberately different personas, with plenty of sketches and regular characters.\n\n‘This Morning With Richard, Not Judy’ was a much different outing for Lee and Herring. This was a Sunday lunchtime comedy show based loosely on a chat show format, but which was more concerned with tales of Richard Herring’s quite literal animal husbandry, and pointing out the inherent flaws in the teachings of Jesus. This also featured sketches and recurring features, as well as a level of audience and viewer interaction.\n\nLee and Herring’s humour could be silly as well as incredibly intelligent. They would often point out the cheap tricks used in comedy, such as exaggerating your own character traits and confounding expectations with punchlines such as “…and then I got off the bus, ahh” and were not afraid to use these same devices once they had pointed them out. This meant that they never patronised their viewers, despite their claims to the contrary with lines such as “thank you for sending your pictures and suggestions in, you viewers are the real stars of the show… but obviously it’s me and Rich that get all the money for them,” and both series were the highlight of my week. Their “faux-naïve scatology and smug self-satisfied intellectualism” appealed to me more than any other comedy act, and although the two friends rarely work together any more they still tour the stand-up circuit and make a living from other means in the entertainment industry.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“You want the moon on a stick!”\n\n“Drink your weak lemon drink… now!”\n\n“I am Rod Hull. I am him!”\n\n“Hello Mister Rich, hello Mister Stew, I’m Curious Orange.”\n\n“Ahhhhh!” “No it’s not an ahhh situation.” “It is an ahhh situation.”\n\n“Listen to the question, listen to the words in it, are you the Lord of the Dance Settee?”\n\n“Of course they’re all snowy owls by the time I’m finished with them.”\n\n(Anyone interested should visit www.richardherring.com, www.stewartlee.co.uk, or even better FistofFun.net where there is a petition to get Fist of Fun released on DVD for its tenth anniversary).\n\n2. MONTY PYTHON’S FLYING CIRCUS\n\nIn my opinion the first great comedy series, and infinitely more influential and timeless than the heaps of racist ITV sitcoms of the time that are very rarely repeated today. I’m sure most people must be familiar with this six-piece of comedy virtuosos, who made their name with the hilarious, surreal and convention-destroying ‘Flying Circus’ television show before moving on to equally excellent films. Aside from Graham Chapman they are all still alive and working, however Eric Idle has officially never done anything good since Monty Python, and anyone who says he is, is an idiot.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“This is a late parrot.”\n\n“I put on women’s clothing and hang around in bars.”\n\n“I came here for an argument!” “No you didn’t, you came here for an argument.”\n\n“We are the Knights who Say ‘Ni.’”\n\n“He’s not the Messiah. Now p*** off!”\n\n3. RED DWARF\n\nArguably not quite as funny as other programmes, but the whole idea of this space sitcom has appealed to me since I first saw the show at the age of seven. There are plenty of reviews on the show here on Dooyoo so I won’t go into detail about the plot, but it’s essentially four different characters marooned in deep space completely alone. The first few series are based around the cast generally bumming around and playing off each other, but the later years became more plot- and adventure-oriented. Red Dwarf can be classed as both a comedy show and a science fiction show, and indeed often is, but the real humour comes from the excellent choice of characters: the antagonistic relationship between the career-obsessed failure Arnold Rimmer and the laid-back bum Dave Lister is by far the highlight of the show for me, however every episode in the first six years was a piece of classic television that I can (and indeed, do) watch again and again.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“Shut up you dead git!” (‘Me2’)\n\n“We are talking jape of the decade…” (‘Queeg’)\n\n“Do you think Wilma’s sexy?” (‘Backwards’)\n\n“Sirs they’ve taken Mister Rimmer!” “Quick, let’s get out of here before they bring him back.” (‘Holoship’)\n\n“Step up to red alert.” “Sir, are you absolutely sure? It does mean changing the bulb.” (‘Legion’)\n\n4. CHRIS MORRIS’ SERIES (The Day Today / Brass Eye)\n\nOne of the most controversial comedians of our age, Chris Morris is the man behind the spoof news show ‘The Day Today’ and the spoof documentary series ‘Brass Eye’ (screened on Channel 4 as Morris had been dropped from the BBC). The mixture of nonsensical facts and expressions with unbelievable situations being shown in a believable way makes these two classic series of television comedy, aided greatly by the supporting actors such as David Schneider, Rebecca Front, Steve Coogan and Peter Baynham. Brass Eye’s paedophilia special, exposing the treatment of the subject in the media, is often seen as the most controversial comedy episode ever, although it’s still very funny.\n\nMorris’ warped sense of humour was demonstrated further in the radio series ‘Blue Jam’ and the TV adaptation ‘Jam,’ both using distorted visuals to compliment strange and often very disturbing situations. I enjoy these shows, but nowhere near as much as Morris’ earlier, more approachable work, which is now available on DVD.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“Goal!… TW**!… Sh** did you see that?… Liquid football!… That, was a goal.” (Alan Partridge)\n\n“He’s not gay by the way, we would never employ a homosexual.”\n\n“Teacher uses big-faced boy as satellite dish.”\n\n“This man was paid three hundred pounds to incubate a stomach full of shoulders.”\n\n“Footage of this paedophile disguised as a school.” “Yes, we must catch that man. He really is a sh**.”\n\n5. FAMILY GUY\n\nThe only animated series on the list, as well as the only American show, Family Guy’s appeal is incredibly strong, but still not as influential as something like the far less amusing ‘The Simpsons.’ Still focusing on an American family but with more interesting and entertaining characters as well as far more bizarre and often contradictory situations. Stewie, the talking baby who is essentially evil (and as the series progresses, increasingly homosexual) wins over many viewers, but for me it’s the sheer idiocy of the father character, Peter Griffin, that keeps me laughing. Not very politically correct at all, even leading to an episode being undeservedly deemed too offensive due to its Jewish jokes, Family Guy isn’t just a load of mindless swearing like on some other popular animated series.\n\nFamily Guy ran for three series before being cancelled by the Fox network, but impressive DVD sales in the US, Australia and the UK have led to a new series being commissioned that should begin airing next year.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“Whose leg do I have to hump to get a dry Martini around here?” (Brian)\n\n“Peter this is wonderful, you’re not going to die!” “Go on.” “…Well that’s it.” “Go on.” (Lois & Peter)\n\n“It’s not so much that I want to kill her as I don’t want her to be… alive… any more.” (Stewie)\n\n“I’m about to go upstairs and eat a whole bag of peanuts!… I’m allergic to peanuts… You don’t know anything about me!” “Who was that guy?” (Meg and her father Peter)\n\n6. REEVES AND MORTIMER (The Smell of … / Bang Bang it’s …)\n\nAnother comedy duo, the unexplained strange situations in the sketch shows of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer made it hilarious to my child’s mind and still amusing to this day. The situations could become too silly at some points, but most of the time I find myself laughing hysterically at their discussions and recurring characters. Vic and Bob are probably most well known for Shooting Stars, a less extreme and more accessible show than their earlier work, and recently wrote and starred in the BBC Three comedy drama ‘Catterick.’ It’s ‘The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer’ and ‘Bang Bang it’s Reeves and Mortimer’ that will always be my favourites however, catching the duo at their most inventive and unusual.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“It doesn’t really matter does it.”\n\n“Do you want some salt?”\n\n“I told you to inform me of any financial investment over £2,740 Vic!”\n\n7. THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN\n\nOne of the biggest comedy series of the late nineties, the League’s unique mixture of comedy and horror resulted in an incredibly popular television series, radio show and live tour. Based on a sketch show format with recurring characters, each episode furthered a number of plots integral to the series’ overall story arcs. Many characters were easy to relate to and recognisable, while others were plain disgusting or bizarre. The third series in 2002 was a little less popular due the changes in style, but plans for an upcoming film seem very promising. The League are Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson, the latter of which doesn’t appear in the shows.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“Hello hello, what’s going on, what’s all this shouting, we’ll have no trouble here.”\n\n“In this house, we don’t m*****bate.”\n\n“It’s a sh** business isn’t it?”\n\n“You’re my wife now.”\n\n8. RIK MAYALL WHEN HE WAS GOOD (Kevin Turvey / The Young Ones / Bottom)\n\nBefore ‘The New Statesman’ and ‘Drop Dead Fred,’ Rik Mayall was a very funny comedy performer. Beginning his TV career as the meandering Birmingham investigative reporter Kevin Turvey in a spot on ‘A Kick Up the Eighties,’ Rik then appeared alongside Adrian Edmondson as characters loosely based on their ‘Dangerous Brothers’ stand-up routine: this programme was ‘The Young Ones.’ Far too silly and ‘youth programme’ for some viewers, the Young Ones took on cult status immediately and is widely regarded as one of the best shows of the eighties. The Young Ones also featured musical interludes as part of a scheme to earn more money from the BBC under the ‘entertainment’ budget rather than the lower comedy equivalent, and this inevitably increased these two views even more.\n\nRik’s pathetic, angry, pedantic virginal character Rick was progressed into Richie when Rik and Adrian appeared in ‘Bottom’ in the early 90s. Although my view is clearly tempered by my love of the series when I was a child, I still consider Bottom to be one of the funniest shows created; even if the later episodes relied on diarrhoea gags and absurd violence a little too much, the ongoing themes of sad middle-aged life for two disgusting, violent perverts was still strangely funny in a depressing kind of way.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“If there’s anything you want investigating, Kevin’s ear.” (Kevin Turvey)\n\n“Virgin.” “I am not!” (Rick & Vyvian)\n\n“You stupid bloody hippie.” (Rik)\n\n“Edward Elizabeth Hitler, either you open this door or I’ll ruddy well open it myself.” (Richie)\n\n“It was a bloke!” “She had an earring.” “Yes, through HER foreskin!” (Richie & Eddie)\n\n9. BIG TRAIN\n\nFairly similar in premise to the sketch show format of ‘The Fast Show,’ Big Train took an interesting approach in terms of very strange situations and a focus specifically on a low-key, deadpan style for every sketch. Although it ran for two series, Big Train seemed to have an incredibly brief run and never received the level of recognition that I think it deserved. The regular actors were Kevin Eldon, Simon Pegg, Mark Heap, Amelia Bullmore, Rebecca Front and Julia Davis, and was primarily written by Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews, although the cast often contributed. Memorable sketches include the Evil Hypnotist, World Stare-Out Championship, the Huge Dog and Spoon-Phobia, and both series will be available on DVD later this year.\n\n10. I’M ALAN PARTRIDGE\n\nThis very realistically shot series followed the depressing, uneventful and very funny life of failed TV personality Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) as he lived in a Travel Tavern on the side of the motorway. Alan is abrasive and easy to provoke, but his sadness and pathetic nature made him very likeable in the first series. In 2002, the writers brought Alan back for another series which was just as successful but for me lacked some of the charm of the first series, mainly due to Alan’s wealth and better position in life. The supporting cast are all excellent, and the show is filmed in an untreated, realistic way, although it never makes any claims to be genuine.\n\nMemorable catch-phrases:\n\n“No offence Lynn, but technically your life isn’t worth insuring.”\n\n“You feed swans beefburgers.”\n\n“Jurassic Park!”\n\n“Oh no… oh no! Are you dead?…”\n\n“No way you spastic, you’re a mentalist.”\n\nVERDICT\n\nThis list is obviously subject to change. If it wasn’t, and there were no significant comedy shows throughout the rest of my lifetime, it would be a sad day for us all, although hopefully by then the BBC will have released Fist of Fun on DVD. If there are any important comedy shows that you feel deserve to be in this list, it’s most likely that I have already considered them and decided they didn’t have the same level of influence on me, although it’s always a possibility that I’ve simply forgotten them. I’m not magic, do I look like a wizard? (Well, perhaps one in particular…)\n\nI still enjoy a large variety of comedy programmes, but there are several types that I cannot personally stand:\n\nLad comedy: Men Behaving Badly was quite entertaining when I was younger, but I cannot condone the existence of ‘2 Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps.’ There are too many things I dislike about shows such as this, far too many to mention, but essentially it isn’t my lifestyle and I really don’t find the characters or situations entertaining.\n\nHousewives’ comedy: I’m not sure how to categorise it actually, but it’s essentially ‘Birds of a Feather.’ I really don’t like this.\n\nDaft American eighties gimmicky family series: Harry and the Hendersons, Mork & Mindy, etc.\n\nFamily comedy series: Nothing against comedy for all generations, but shows like ‘My Family’ and the appalling ‘My Hero’ are keeping British comedy in general firmly entrenched in the 1980s.\n\nThank you for reading this self-indulgent review, I hope you enjoyed some aspect of it.\n\nAdvantages: Hilarious and influential, Keep me entertained, Original and inventive\n\nDisadvantages: Not to everyone's tastes, A great comedy series is very rare\n\nTop Ten TV Characters\n\nTop Ten TV Comedy Characters. Probably.\n\nWritten on 07.07.04\n\nThere are two areas of television that interest me: comedy and science fiction. Well, and music channels, but that’s not really appropriate here. In the same way that I used Dooyoo’s ‘Top 10 TV Programmes…Ever!’ category to write about what were (probably) my top ten comedy programmes, here are (probably) the ten fictional characters in television comedy who I admire the most, for various reasons.\n\nMost of them correspond with the shows chosen for my Top 10 Comedy Programmes review but this isn’t the case with all of them: while I loved the sketch-based show ‘Big Train’ and the ramblings of Reeves and Mortimer, neither of these acts introduced any really inspirational and memorable characters. It’s interesting to note just how many of these favourites of mine are pathetic, unloved people who I really wouldn’t want to meet in real life, but who make the shows they are in so much funnier through their interaction with more well-rounded characters.\n\nAs is always the case with this type of review there will be plenty of characters I have forgotten that could be included, but most of the omissions will have been considered. Feel free to add any of your favourites in the comments, but please don’t tell me I really should have included Frank Spencer, Rene from ‘Allo ‘Allo and the silly one from Dad’s Army who says ‘don’t panic!’\n\n1. DAVID BRENT (The Office)\n\nRicky Gervais’ portrayal of the pathetic, arrogant, misguided, lonely, ineffective boss of a Slough paper merchants has been recognised on numerous occasions with prestigious awards and a top-rated television series and I feel this is rightfully deserved. ‘The Office’ was an excellent programme and one of the only programmes I have to make myself look away from on occasion or even switch off when I’m aware that something embarrassing is about to happen. Every one of these involves David Brent, and whenever he wanders into scene giggling inanely or even looking quite sombre, it’s obvious that something brilliant is about to happen.\n\nThere were twelve episodes of ‘The Office’ and a two-part Christmas special soon to be released on DVD, and as such there are far too many David Brent moments to mention here. Needless to say, he is a character that needs to be seen to be fully appreciated: I can’t even guess the number of times I’ve heard my brother shout “oh God, why’s he doing that?” and “I’d hate him!”\n\nIn the Christmas special, set a few years after the TV series, Brent tells the cameraman that he only came across as generally foolish because of the biased editing by the BBC (‘The Office’ was a spoof of a fly-on-the-wall documentary). This caused me to pause for a moment and consider whether such a thing was possible, even taking into account that the programme is completely fictional, but there is no way that carrying out a ‘practical joke’ that makes your receptionist burst into tears, behaving childishly with an inflatable penis, trying to impress with a humiliatingly improvised dance routine and deliberately avoiding facing up to everything could be due to editing. Gervais was the co-writer of the series and it’s clear that he’d been waiting a long time to bring this character to life on the screen.\n\nDAVID: No-one’s dispensable in my book, because we’re like one big organism, one big animal. The guys upstairs on the phones, they’re like the mouth. The guys down here, the hands.\n\nJENNIFER: And what part are you?\n\nDAVID: Good question. Probably the humour.\n\n2. ARNOLD RIMMER (Red Dwarf)\n\nDespite its flaws I have always had a special love for Red Dwarf since I was a child, and on many occasions I have wondered who my favourite character is. Recently I’ve come to realise that the backbone of the show is the butt of most jokes and the supplier of all the witty comments, Arnold Judas Rimmer.\n\nAlthough he starts the series as a bit of an unlikeable git, Rimmer’s weaknesses and the increasing focus on how pathetic his life actually is lead to him becoming someone with whom the audience can sympathise, but who is still basically a git. Blaming all of his failings on his modest background, despite the fact that all of his brothers went on to become high flyers in the Space Corps, Rimmer was still a lowly, chicken soup machine repairing second technician after twelve years of long service. Brief points raised over the subsequent series such as the name labels he would sew into his ship-issue condoms, his collected notes on twentieth century telegraph poles and his love of both Hammond Organ music and Morris dancing all help to further this image of someone who is clearly in need of some friends.\n\nThe true extent of Rimmer’s necessity to the crew (which otherwise consisted of a disgusting but likeable bum, a creature obsessed with its own appearance, a deranged computer and a servile mechanoid) was shown when Chris Barrie left the series in 1997 to pursue other interests. The resulting shows were very poor compared to the usual Red Dwarf standard, although Rimmer’s return in 1999 couldn’t hide the weak quality of the writing by that stage.\n\nRimmer’s comments on situations and characters show that he is actually quite capable and intelligent, but he still managed to fail his engineering exam fourteen times (including the time he had his spasm and the time he coped with a mental breakdown by writing ‘I am a fish’ four hundred times. He even went up for extra paper). The first four series of Red Dwarf are available on DVD and show the evolution, and lack of it, for this brilliant character. Oh yes, he’s dead and composed entirely of light as well, which must be a bit of a bummer. The episode ‘Dimension Jump’ is probably the most Rimmer-heavy episode of the entire franchise and shows just what he could have become if he had tried a little harder.\n\nLISTER: Your excuse for anything slightly peculiar is aliens isn’t it? You lose your keys – it’s aliens. A picture falls off the wall – it’s aliens. That time we used up a whole bog roll in a day…\n\nRIMMER: Well we didn’t use it all Lister, who did?\n\nLISTER: Rimmer, aliens used our bog roll?\n\nRIMMER: Just cause they’re aliens doesn’t mean they don’t have to visit the little boys room. Only they probably do something weird and alienesque like it comes out of the top of their heads or something.\n\nLISTER: Well I wouldn’t like to be stuck behind one in a cinema.\n\n3. SIMON QUINLANK (Fist of Fun/This Morning With Richard Not Judy)\n\nA more obscure choice here, but this regular feature of Lee and Herring’s ‘Fist of Fun’ and ‘This Morning With Richard, Not Judy’ series is fantastically portrayed by Kevin Eldon, a comic actor you will undoubtedly have seen playing a variety of roles in a number of series from Big Train to Nighty Night. Simon Quinlank presented short segments exploring the hobbies he was obsessed with, and how to do them.\n\nRather than simply being a nerd, everything about Simon was elevated to different and original levels, and even when it became obvious what he was going to do or say it was still a joy to see it happen. As well as having a very deep obsession with all kinds of strange hobbies (Old Man Collecting, Train Ignoring, Metal Desecrating, Phoning Norris McWhirter at 3am and Asking Him What the Biggest Leaf Is, etc.) Simon Quinlank was also unusually abrasive and prone to drastic mood swings. He had very little time for other humans, who he saw as inferior to his own status as ‘The Hobby Messiah,’ and whenever forced to consult them during his hobbies he would snap “answer me!” He also had a very abrupt laugh that was a lot of fun. Simon Quinlank was a celebration of nerdism and obsession that never reverted to tired ‘I like Star Trek’ and ‘I’m doing the shopping for my mum’ routines.\n\nMy favourite aspect of the character was the clear mental problems he was suffering: although sitting in a room with a Thunderbirds alarm clock and detailed maps and bar charts on the walls could possibly be passed off as a bit excessive, some hobbies revealed strange hatreds of certain aspects of life. In his ‘Egg Smashing’ hobby he was determined to destroy every single egg on the planet, even shouting “smash those whorish eggs!” as he did so, and the final hobby Simon presented (the Imagining Things Other People Have Never Imagined Before Ever hobby) saw him overloading his mind’s capabilities and undergoing a surgical procedure to remove his brain.\n\nSIMON: Ha ha! That fifty pence coin was covered in cat’s wee! The cat wee hand idiot!\n\n4. RICHARD RICHARD (Bottom)\n\nMaybe an unpopular choice but Rik Mayall’s presentation of surely the saddest and most depraved sweaty middle-aged man in the early 90s series ‘Bottom’ has cracked me up since I was a child. Playing alongside the slightly less disgusting but equally unappealing violent drunkard Eddie Hitler, Richie would mainly complain about his unsexed life and his own depression, but he’d mainly be caught trying to play with himself and reacting violently to Eddie, possibly using a pan or other household implement.\n\nSome people see ‘Bottom’ as a continuation of sorts of the more popular 80s series ‘The Young Ones,’ and it’s easy to see how the virginal, politically-obsessed Rick could grow into the virginal, past-caring Richie. The later series of ‘Bottom’ resorted to more toilet humour and repetition that made them less enjoyable, but the first series from 1991 is one of my favourite series of a comedy show ever made. The dark, seedy lives of Richie and Eddie are shown unadulterated by bad jokes, even making the viewer wonder whether the two were somehow secretly attracted to each other underneath the violence and petty bickering. Classic Richie moments include: stubbornly changing the television channel to watch Cricket so Eddie can’t watch Miss World, even though he wants to watch that show even more than Eddie does; accidentally killing the gas man and going into a frenzied panic; opening birthday cards that have all been sent by himself and trying to avoid his doomed fate by living in a makeshift tent in the lounge under the settee.\n\nRichie is filthy, sexist, obnoxious and incredibly pathetic, and that’s why he’s so enjoyable to watch. This is a character whose misery you can really take delight in.\n\nEDDIE: Keith isn’t a bird, he’s a bloke.\n\nRICHIE: Well, she had an earring.\n\nEDDIE: Yes, through ‘her’ foreskin.\n\n5. MICHAEL PALIN AS ANY CHARACTER (Monty Python’s Flying Circus)\n\nThere were very few recurring characters in the brilliant and highly influential seventies series Monty Python’s Flying Circus, but any brought to life by the talented, hilarious and very versatile Michael Palin always seemed very believable and was almost guaranteed to be very funny, unlike some performances by lesser members such as the quite annoying Eric Idle. The barber who wishes he was a lumberjack is one of the best examples as Palin combines friendly lifestyle banter with homicidal undertones and ends it in a musical performance about being a transvestite, but every episode is littered with examples of his genius. He also played his share of women too, although it’s clear that he was more suited to playing men, whatever their role in society or place of origin.\n\nMichael played a staggering number of roles in the film ‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail,’ much more than any of the other actors, and his performances ranged from the tall, squawking leader of the Knights Who Say Ni to the noble Sir Galahad and the uncaring, money-hungry owner of the unwise Swamp Castle. ‘Life of Brian’ also saw Palin taking on a number of prominent roles including an upside-down prisoner and the camp Pontius Pilate with a speech impediment.\n\nART CRITIC: Good evening. I'd like to talk to you tonight about the place of the nude in my bed - um... in the history of my bed – of art, of art! I'm sorry. The place of the nude in the history of tart - call girl! I'm sorry, I'll start again... bum – oh what a giveaway.\n\n6. BALDRICK (Blackadder)\n\nRowan Atkinson’s Blackadder character was the dominant and most impressive feature of the four series and assorted TV specials, but it was his servile, idiotic underdog Baldrick that made the programme even more of a success. Tony Robinson was one of the finest comedy actors of the 80s in my opinion, and Baldrick is certainly incredibly memorable and also quite loveable.\n\nThe Baldrick of the first Blackadder series was, like most aspects of that initial series, very different from the Baldrick of the later series in terms of his high intellect, but his status as the dung-shovelling servant who must reluctantly carry out the most sordid of tasks to benefit his master is something that lived on in his prostitution (Blackadder II) and horse duties (Blackadder the Third). The Baldrick of the final series, Blackadder Goes Forth, is perhaps the most memorable of the lot and is certainly the thickest and most disgusting, although this time all those around him are forced to live in conditions that earlier Baldricks would have considered quite heavenly.\n\nAnother thing that made Baldrick interesting was his inconsistency, occasionally surprising the viewer: while his idiocy would mostly result in unworkable plans that have a little basis in reality, such as disguising a bull as a chicken to create a flawless cockfight competitor, his complete lack of education and general knowledge is clear in his Dictionary definition of the letter C, “big blue wobbly thing that mermaids live in,” while Dog is defined as “not a cat.”\n\nBALDRICK: I’ve written a poem about it, it’s called ‘War’:\n\nHear the words I sing,\n\nWar’s a horrid thing.\n\nBut still I sing, sing, sing,\n\nDing-a-ling-a-ling.\n\nBLACKADDER: Yes well it started badly, tailed off in the middle and the less said about the end the better.\n\n7. CHRISTOPHER MORRIS (The Day Today/Brass Eye)\n\nThe man behind the strangely satirical ‘The Day Today’ and ‘Brass Eye’ presented parts of each programme from the guise of his Jeremy Paxman-like anchorman with a peculiar manner of talking and occasional outbursts, all controlled by a hard stare and unflinching features.\n\nDespite claims by co-writers and close friends such as Peter Baynham that Morris is a delightful man to be around, it’s difficult to get any kind of positive image from this strange character who seems to criticise and look down upon everyone else in the studio due to his isolation, but there are some quirks to the character that make him even more enjoyable: his banter with sports commentator Alan Partridge is fairly antagonistic and pointless as he questions him about significant words, although in the final episode this changed into a genuine appreciation when Morris tells Alan how impressed he was with the coverage of a football match, even proceeding to give Alan a surprising kiss. His embarrassing and over-the-top flirtation with Valerie Sinatra the traffic correspondent shows another side to the character that only makes him more of an enigma.\n\nChris Morris played several other recurring characters in both series including Ted Maul and Austen Tesseltine, but it’s the ‘Christopher Morris’ character for which he will be most remembered, introducing unbelievable but somehow credible news stories and offering his own comments.\n\nMORRIS: A quick look at tomorrow’s papers, ‘Aristocrat’s Dung Saves Village From Flood,’ that’s in the Mail, The Today: ‘Drowned Italian Wins Eurovision.’ The Express go with ‘Lord Mayor’s Pirouette in Fire Chief Wife Decapitation’ grisly but gripping, The Sun: ‘Robin Cock!’ And the Daily Star, ‘Feel My Nose and Put My Specs There Roars Drunken Major.’\n\n8. PETER GRIFFIN (Family Guy)\n\nThe only animated character on the list, the father character in the excellent American adult cartoon series ‘Family Guy’ is strangely redeeming and likeable despite his incredible stupidity, chauvinism and arrogance. The writers of Family Guy take advantage of the animated format in presenting the viewer with bizarre and often contradictory glimpses of events that apparently happened in the past, and most of these involve Peter in undesirable situations: in a job interview he is asked where he sees himself in five years’ time and Peter, looking at the interviewer’s photo of his family, keeps thinking “don’t say doing your wife, don’t say doing your wife,” eventually coming out with “doing your… son.”\n\nThe programme is completely un-PC and proud of it, just as it should be. Making jokes that mock peoples’ ideas about racism and other such issues would only offend people without a sense of humour, and it’s Peter who is usually the instigator. I’d usually round this off by saying that at least he is a great father and husband, but this is untrue; Brian the dog even asks Peter’s wife Lois “why do you put up with him?” In the end it’s only a cartoon series and deliberately avoids making any concessions towards good taste or positive messages. Peter is ace.\n\nQUAGMIRE: Hey, who wants to play Drink the Beer?\n\nPETER: I don’t know, I promised Lois I wouldn’t drink.\n\nQUAGMIRE: Aww, don’t feel bad Peter.\n\nPETER: Gee, I never thought of it like that.\n\n9. ALAN PARTRIDGE (I’m Alan Partridge/Knowing Me Knowing You/The Day Today)\n\nYet another self-obsessed and quite sad man, Alan Partridge’s life is presented in the form of a documentary in ‘I’m Alan Partridge,’ although he starred earlier in the spoof chat show ‘Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge’ and ‘The Day Today,’ as well as their respective earlier radio incarnations. ‘I’m Alan Partridge’ is the true classic of these however in terms of getting inside Alan’s head and seeing how others react to him, especially in the excellent first series in which Alan lives a lonely and unsuccessful life in a Travel Tavern. The second series was filmed much later and is still very funny, but Alan has lost most of his pathetic qualities that I found the most enjoyable, generally coming across as unnecessarily arrogant.\n\nThe first series featured many classic moments such as Alan’s day of being incredibly bored, setting up a practical joke by pretending to be a zombie in the reception area that ends up as a depressing scenario. His dinner discussion with the head of BBC programming ends up with Alan going a little insane and stealing some cheese, while the series also catalogued his increasing mental instability in the form of pole-dancing fantasies. This insanity resulted in him developing an addiction to Toblerones, doubling his weight and driving to Dundee in bare feet between series. Yet another character who is excellent in his worthlessness.\n\nALAN: If you see a lovely field with a family having a nice picnic and there's a pond in it, you fill in the pond with concrete, you plow the family into the field, you blow up the tree and use the leaves to make a dress for your wife who’s also your brother!\n\n10. PAPA LAZAROUS (The League of Gentlemen)\n\n‘The League of Gentlemen’ presented and developed many interesting and very funny characters, but even Tubbs and Edward from the Local Shop aren’t as memorable or terrifying as the strange travelling wife-stealer and owner of Papa Lazarous’ Travelling Circus, played brilliantly by Reece Shearsmith.\n\nPapa Lazarous’ weird dialogue and unclear accent were exaggerated to hilarious extremes when the League toured the country, but in the episodes themselves (Papa appeared in the first episode of series two, the final episode of series three and the Christmas special) he is menacing, confusing and quite scary, even though he gets a lot of laughs. I would have felt very intimidated by the black and white make-up and dirty clothes if I saw him in the street when I was young. I think I still would now, if Reece spoke in that grating voice. Papa Lazarous delighted in stealing women from towns and declaring them his ‘wives,’ as well as calling a lot of people ‘Dave.’ He was based on a man who the League knew called Peter Papa Lazarous (strangely) who would always ask to speak to ‘Steve’ (Steve Pemberton, one of the Gentlemen), continuing to ask for Steve even when he was told that Steve was not in.\n\nPAPA: Hello Dave.\n\nWOMAN: Excuse me?\n\nPAPA: Is that Dave?\n\nWOMAN: No, you’ve got the wrong house.\n\nPAPA: Alright is Dave there?\n\nWOMAN: No, there’s no one called Dave here.\n\nPAPA: Okay (Jams foot in door) Dave, my wife would like to use your toilet…\n\nSo there are (probably) my ten favourite TV comedy characters. I hope you at least enjoyed the quotes. There are many, many more characters from comedy that are very memorable, far too many to bother giving ‘honourable mention’ to, but these are the ones that have (probably) made the biggest impression on me. Many comedy fans feel that the genre has become stale and unoriginal in this decade and to some extent I agree, but as long as there are portions of genius such as ‘The Office’ and ‘Family Guy,’ comedians and comedy writers will continue to create and produce high quality entertainment and characters.\n\nI’m always hopeful that my favourite television series ever is just over the horizon, its concept currently being scribbled down by a comic genius in a flat somewhere…\n\nAdvantages: Original and ingenious, Occasionally very life-like, sometimes very abnormal, Either serve to make a show fantastic or that little bit better\n\nDisadvantages: Not to everyone's taste, I've clearly left something out\n\n#\n\nThe 11 O'Clock Show\n\n\"Yeah, But Ali G Was Good Though\"\n\n***\n\nWritten on 17.06.04\n\n‘The News Alternative’ that was the 11 O’clock show ran for a number of series on Channel 4, mostly starting within around one hour of the time slot advertised by the title. The series was something of a cult hit and indeed was the show that introduced hugely successful comedians Ricky Gervais and Ali G to television audiences, although after a while the format of the show became both tedious and unoriginal.\n\nCAST\n\nThe topical show was presented by the forcefully-controversial Iain Lee and the arousing, deadpan Daisy Donovan from their confined set that seemed to be a fusion of Chris Morris’ news desk from ‘The Day Today’ and Andi Peters’ broom cupboard from Children’s BBC. As well as making jokes and observations about current events and the media world, Iain and Daisy also presented regular features such as ‘Do and Don’t’ on subjects such as teenage pregnancy. These features were amusing, but it was always the switch to contributions from the show’s more impressive personalities that were eagerly awaited.\n\nAn oft-criticised but occasionally interesting part of the show featured Daisy as the ‘Angel of Delight,’ interviewing people on the streets and politicians, manipulating them into accidentally saying ‘hilarious’ things that could be interpreted as sexual through editing. A notable example included an interview with a female politician in which Daisy asked her if she would ever ‘finger’ Mrs. Thatcher; simple double entendre material essentially. When interviewing male politicians, she would put on an incredibly flirtatious, innocent persona that was quite funny and must have been uncomfortable for those involved.\n\nAli G shot to fame straight after his series of uninformed, ignorant interviews on important aspects of society with political and artistic figures. His catch-phrases and general speech may have become incredibly tiresome and much imitated, but I still find his classic interview clips as funny as ever, although as soon as he became famous he left his three minute slot on this programme far behind him. Classic discussions included Ali’s visit to the countryside in which his streetwise urban character was scared by a cow and his cringingly ignorant views on sexism.\n\nRicky Gervais appeared on the show as Ali G was on his way out, and he immediately became the sole reason I watched the show. Anyone who has seen his live performances or his short-lived series on Channel 4 will be familiar with his critical and occasionally shockingly rude style, although it’s difficult to pin down exactly what he did on the show; one week he would stand in a field talking about the Second World War, the next he would discuss pornographic websites.\n\nRicky Grover’s menacing ‘Bulla’ character appeared in 2000 after the show hit its real decline, but the obese prison inmate was reasonably amusing.\n\nMATERIAL\n\nIn terms of the satirical and topical material, the 11 O’clock show only proved itself to be fairly average. On occasion I noticed direct rip-offs of jokes from other current events programmes, even the high profile Have I Got News For You, while comedy duo Lee and Herring even commented on the ripping off of their own material from their ‘This Morning With Richard Not Judy’ Sunday morning comedy show:\n\nSTEW: This week saw the last episode in the current series of the 11 O’clock show…\n\nRICH: Oh no Stew, who will copy our jokes now?\n\nThe title of this opinion is another quote from TMWRNJ, summing up the possible response of Channel 4 executives when faced with the cancellation of this series.\n\nDespite some unoriginality, the 11 O’clock show was at least something amusing to watch on Tuesday or Thursday school nights, and the camera tended to remain on Daisy Donovan long enough for more bored viewers to enjoy her contribution in their own way; her innocent English girl persona contrasted very well with her occasionally harsh language. The show’s final series was a major disappointment to most viewers due to the change in presenters and the drop in quality of the material, and it seems that the show’s legacy will only be to the careers it helped launch.\n\nAdvantages: Competently filled the 11 - 11.30pm time slot, Some very funny features and regulars, Informative\n\nDisadvantages: Repetitive jokes, especially from the main studio, Some presenters failed to impress, Not very original\n\nA\n\nAsylum\n\nJust a Pizza Delivery Boy?\n\n***\n\nWritten on 25.08.07\n\n‘Asylum’ was a short-lived an almost entirely forgotten comedy series produced by the UK Paramount channel in 1996. Based around the premise of a corrupt mental institution along the lines of ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’ (which is acknowledged by references in several episodes as an obvious influence), the main plot was essentially a flimsy device to bring together a cast of young, up-and-coming comedians and allow them to perform shortened versions of their stand-up shows to varying degrees of success. Its only real claim to fame is introducing the partnership of comedians Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson with writer/director Edgar Wright, who would later create the surreal sitcom ‘Spaced’ and the hit films ‘Shaun of the Dead’ and ‘Hot Fuzz’ (without Stevenson’s contribution).\n\nWhile the premise is undoubtedly flimsy, I find the ramshackle and uneven nature of the show quite charming, enhanced by the very low budget, and it’s interesting to see all of these performers being thrust into the same situation and treating it very differently. The show is introduced and technically fronted by Norman Lovett (Holly from Red Dwarf), though his contributions are largely in a supporting role as the incompetent and fairly bored Doctor presumably written by the series writers David Walliams and Edgar Wright. The majority of the material appears to have been written by the individual comedians themselves, leading to some isolated stand-up routines from Adam Bloom – an inmate who apparently believes he is a stand-up comedian, and plays a recording of audience laughter from his Dictaphone every time he cracks a joke – and some more impressive cooperative material from Pegg and Stevenson.\n\nSimon Pegg’s character is the real star of the series, an unlucky pizza delivery boy who ends up in the asylum by mistake and acts as the viewer’s point of reference amidst the formerly sane people around him, whose incarceration and treatments have slowly driven them out of their minds. Pegg is his usual reliable self, occasionally chatting to the camera with what are presumably his old stand-up routines but mostly acting the part of the angry and confused, but ultimately quite weak young man with many of the nuances viewers will be familiar with from Spaced and his more recent films. His interaction with Jessica Stevenson’s character becomes greater in later episodes, but her insanity (she believes that aliens in league with Carol Vorderman are communicating secret messages to her through the ‘Countdown’ conundrums) prevents them from bonding in a Tim and Daisy way, and his interaction with the other comedians is fairly limited. Stevenson also plays the evil Nurse McFadden, a very different character whose unrequited lust for Dr. Lovett and careless attitude towards the inmates comes to a head in the final episode, as the series begins to take on some form of actual plot.\n\nSomeone who really takes the situation to heart and works with it is Julian Barratt (of The Mighty Boosh), whose character Victor Munro is an extremely eccentric and bizarre individual. Tapping into the same vein of weirdness that Barratt is now well-known for, the character’s obsession with artistic statements, his belief that he has another face underneath his hair and a pack of dogs living in his eyes, and his repeated failed attempts to cast life into a miniature clay golem (“it worked for Tony Hart!”) can become a little irritating, but his commanding presence and pointy-beard-and-huge-eyebrows image makes him one of the more memorable parts of the show, in which he features regularly, often alongside the mute juggler Paul (Paul Morocco). Compared to these noted contributors, the rest of the cast is somewhat disappointing in its lack of effort. The premise that Bloom believes he is a stand-up is a really weak device that allows him to shoehorn in a couple of old five minute routines, while John Moloney wastes a few minutes in the first two episodes with incredibly dull and irrelevant routines talking about his grandparents and then drugs. Comedy duo Parsons and Naylor appear in the later episodes but don’t get up to much past an obvious deconstruction of rock-paper-scissors, but more forgivable are the brief moments offered to Bill Bailey and David Walliams, whose material isn’t that good but is at least short and inoffensive – Walliams discusses the ‘Star Wars’ trilogy, while Bailey deals with sub-atomic biscuits.\n\nThe series has never been officially released, and it’s not a show that holds up well when watched in close succession. Each episode begins with the same opening monologue from Lovett (similar to the introductions he provided on the first two series of Red Dwarf) and a tedious ‘previously on...’ segment repeating scenes mostly from the first show, of Simon arriving with a pizza and being given the low-down on the nefarious antics going on in this place. The plot develops slowly over the six episodes between the unconnected comedy routines, but really isn’t up to much, and tends to drag episodes down when they focus too much on the situation itself. An example is episode four, in which Dr. Lovett accidentally gets his sweets and tablets mixed up and the security guard Nobby Shanks (Mick O’Connor) has to occupy the inmates with a game of charades. There really are only so many jokes that can be extracted from this idea, making it get very old very fast. More amusing is Nurse McFadden’s solution to deciding which of three inmates receives the only remaining pill, by dropping it onto a ‘Hungry Hungry Hippos’ board and letting them bash away for it.\n\nThe final ingredient of ‘Asylum’ that I haven’t yet touched on is the use of a house band, namely David Devant and His Spirit Wife. These sections, which always come towards the end of the show and also provide the opening and closing title music, are completely unrelated to the main plot and characters by being recorded in isolation, though in what appear to be the same sets. Each episode’s song, taken from the band’s first album, loosely relates to an aspect of that week’s plot – though this is clearly down to chance more than careful planning – and although it’s a little odd and distracting, it helps to give the show an exotic and unhinged atmosphere, similar to the musical sections of ‘The Young Ones.’ The songs aren’t particularly funny or interesting, though they’re okay, particularly one about Cluedo that I remember more than the rest (“le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-lead piping”), but I’m glad they were included in this enjoyable mess.\n\nFar from being a comedy classic, ‘Asylum’ was more of a testing ground for young talent, and a chance for some comedians to get a brief stint on the telly (even if it was only the Paramount channel). It proved incredibly beneficial for Pegg, Stevenson and Wright, paving the way for ‘Spaced’ a few years later where Wright’s directorial style could be fully explored (there are a couple of scenes, particularly the alien visitation at the end of episode five, that remind me of that great series). Norman Lovett’s biggest TV role was already behind him, and he’s used here mainly as a familiar face to draw viewers in, but no one else seems to have benefitted from the series in the same way. Julian Barratt is great in this, even if he jabbers on about nipples too much, but his big break wouldn’t come for a long time, while Adam Bloom was doomed to remain on the Paramount channel forever after in tedious circulation on its stand-up shows.\n\nAs this was never given an official release, and thus achieves cool underground cult status, it can commonly be found on sites such as YouTube where people will proclaim it to be much better than it actually is. My advice would be to seek out the better performers in their own shows, where they have more creative control, though for a mixed bag of very different talents this show works surprisingly well.\n\nAdvantages: Excellent collection of mid-90s underground comedy talent.\n\nDisadvantages: Wafer-thin contrived setting and uneven performances.\n\nB\n\nBaddiel & Skinner Unplanned\n\nThe Importance of Being Witty\n\n****\n\nWritten on 09.07.04\n\n“Two blokes. One sofa. No script.”\n\nThis premise on the front of a theatre opens the pre-recorded title sequence to Baddiel & Skinner Unplanned, a low budget but quite well-known comedy based completely on improvisation and audience interaction. This programme was either doomed to failure or popularity among a limited audience: as it happens, it was the latter.\n\nI’ve never particularly been a fan of either Baddiel or Skinner, but this programme caught my attention when it was advertised in 2000 on ITV (I refuse to call it ‘ITV1.’ It’s only called that on old, brown television sets that don’t have remote controls), providing a comedy show in the 21.30 – 23.30 slot when the fourteen-year-old me had not discovered the pleasures of guiding the TV category on Dooyoo and I literally had nothing to do at night. Well, apart from that.\n\nIn February I rediscovered this show being repeated on the Paramount channel and although I felt a little silly and conformist watching it again, I found it strangely addictive. My 10.20pm slot was full for a while. There is plenty of criticism that can be (and indeed has been) aimed at this show, but it’s also strangely enjoyable for all its low-key dullness. It also doesn’t seem important that the show (which was originally live, at least in the first series) is several years old, although discussions over sport events and political or celebrity personalities do provide a splash of age water every so often.\n\nTHE PRESENTERS\n\nThe show is presented from a very comfy-looking brown sofa in a studio, occupied by David Baddiel (on the left) and Frank Skinner (right). Behind them is a large blue backdrop featuring caricatures of their faces, something that itself receives some criticism over the series, and in front of them is the ascending studio audience. David and Frank basically act like themselves, at least that’s the idea, and their different personalities are the driving force behind the show.\n\nTHE SKINNER ONE\n\nClearly the more popular of the two, although I’m not really a fan of either of them on anything other than this, Frank Skinner (real name Chris Collins) is the loveable Birmingham-born everyman comedian. Frank has a habit (that can be both very amusing or very annoying) of converting peoples’ comments into sexual ones and his general movements and actions lead to him being called “the campest straight guy on TV” by many of the audience and the Baddiel one.\n\nAs this show lends itself to a certain cult following, many of the audience are long-time fans of the duo, but especially of Frank. On a number of occasions Frank realises he has met obsessive women in the audience before and his general charm lets him get away with all manner of potentially offensive jokes. The Baddiel one puts a ban on his Jewish jokes quite early on though.\n\nTHE BADDIEL ONE\n\nDavid Baddiel (real name also Chris Collins. Not really) was apparently the token silly one of the Newman and Baddiel duo in the early 90s (responsible for ‘The Mary Whitehouse Experience.’ I never saw it), but in the Baddiel and Skinner act he fulfils the role of the over-educated and sarcastic critic, although he couldn’t be described as curmudgeonly. It would be easy to hate the Baddiel one but I find many of his comments and tales funny.\n\nIn order to be successful, both members of a comedy duo have to be very different. Morcambe had glasses, Ernie was short; Hale had stupid eyes, Pace was fat and had a moustache (or whichever way round they were). Skinner is a slim, camp Brummie who used to work in factory while Baddiel is a bearded, bespectacled Jewish Cambridge graduate who has never done a decent day’s work in his life.\n\nTHE ROUTINE\n\nThe discussions and events of each show are unscripted and largely up to the questions posed by the audience or according to what Baddiel or Skinner have been up to during the week, but there are a couple of fixed features in each show. Early in each ‘episode’ the duo will choose their secretary, an eager member of the audience who records the things they discuss on a board. The brief conversations with more interesting or unusual secretaries resulted in some of the most memorable parts of shows, even leading to a newspaper condemning the show for rigging some audience members. As they become fond of pointing out, it would be difficult to plan some of what goes on.\n\nEach show is ended with a musical number chosen at random by the audience from the songbooks. David plays the piano, prone to errors on a number of occasions, while Frank tries his best to sing, usually going over-the-top and keeping it amusing when it could easily be embarrassing to watch. The first series was shown completely live as it happened and this often resulted in the programme being over or under length: on one particular occasion the song was completed and the screen was filled with a © 2000 Avalon productions screen for three minutes while Frank and David rambled on with the audience in the background, although on most occasions the song was never given full time to be completed. This is undoubtedly part of the reason that the subsequent series were recorded a day prior to transmission for editing.\n\nTHE MEMORY REMAINS\n\nIt’s difficult to pin down specific gags or humorous moments as this is primarily a programme that provides a constant humorous atmosphere throughout without any notable scenes. As such I can only remember some recently seen examples:\n\nA discussion over turkey eggs and whether they exist. This was brought up in a number of shows and no one had any idea until one was eventually sent in as confirmation.\n\nFrank’s birthday presents. Frank’s birthday falls on two shows across the series: the first one sees David’s gift of Robert DeNiro’s papier-mache genital replica, while the second is a little more sarcastic and is based on colouring hair and removing age lines.\n\nThe wonderful birthday joke. A discussion over pubic hair styling techniques in one of the birthday episodes inspires Baddiel’s wit to ask whether they are playing “call my m*ff.” Frank is very pleased with this joke; it is much better than the rubbish presents.\n\nThe pair switch sides of the sofa. This wasn’t really a joke, but it did seem very strange seeing them on the opposite sides following a commercial break. They found it even more disconcerting though.\n\nVERDICT\n\nWhile not really a landmark in TV comedy history, this provided a nice mix of reality TV and improvised comedy and felt very friendly and relaxed; the running jokes and interaction with the audience also served to make it addictive while not having to rely on sexual tension to pull in viewing figures. (If they had it would likely have had the opposite effect: I for one would not be interested in the middle-aged funny men’s gay intercourse festival).\n\nThe jokes are usually fairly crude and never sensational, although this wasn’t the point of the series. ‘Baddiel & Skinner Unplanned’ was fun to watch and is one of the most laid-back programmes I have ever seen, although consequently not one of the most interesting. Not so much compulsive viewing as a leisurely glance in the direction of the telly for half an hour. The show is still on its cycle on digital channel Paramount 2 and occasionally on ITV 2, although the duo has more recently featured in ‘Fantasy Football 2004’ which may or may not still be running. I don’t watch that.\n\nAdvantages: Spontaneous and enjoyable, Funny stars who are slightly different, Doesn't try too hard\n\nDisadvantages: Not exactly groundbreaking, Occasionally gets boring, I wouldn't buy it on DVD\n\nBig Train\n\nSurreal Comedy for the Next Generation\n\n****\n\nWritten on 26.03.04\n\n1999 was, in my opinion, a great year for British comedy with new series such as the League of Gentlemen and Big Train catering for the laughter and slightly surreal needs of both young and old. Although often criticised or forgotten, Big Train seemed to get the balance between straightforward jokes and confusing/disturbing situations spot on: sort of a mix between the Fast Show and Chris Morris' bizarre 'Jam' series.\n\nBig Train was granted a generous airtime on a Monday night, just before the new first series of the award-winning League of Gentlemen, although it obviously wouldn't be to everyone's taste. The little-known actors and writers all played their characters in hilariously deadpan and low-key styles, experiencing emotions such as fear, confusion and calm much more than happiness and excitement.\n\nThe performers are as follows:\n\nKevin Eldon - a talented actor who has appeared in a great deal of comedy from Lee and Herring's TV and radio shows to Brass Eye. you may recognise him from his slightly monkey-esque face and dark hair.\n\nSimon Pegg - much more well-known for starring in Spaced and the upcoming film 'Shaun of the Dead', it's a wonder he hasn't been in more high-profile shows. He did appear in Guest House Paradiso, the disappointing film version of Bottom.\n\nMark Heap - like Kevin Eldon, he has appeared in a lot of comedy such as Brass Eye, Spaced, Jam, Brass Eye and a rubbish comedy film called 'Hospital' that only my Dad likes.\n\nThe female regulars Julia Davis and Amelia Bullmore will be less familiar to viewers, but have both appeared in Jam. Davis was a writer and star of the terrible new show 'Nighty Night,' which also features Kevin Eldon - its only redeeming feature.\n\nBig Train's first six-part series was essentially a sketch show featuring stand-alone stories. Sketches such as the Evil Hypnotist, Spoon-Phobia and the human-sized dog were average length features with great humour throughout while the show also offered a number of very short scenes, used for all of the programme's trailers on the BBC, such as the fireman dancing around and licking the fire pole and the frightened policeman. The first series also became famous partially due to the animated World Stare-Out championship which, despite not being a personal favourite of mine, is certainly very memorable. Lengthier sketches could often drag on a bit too long or just be too confusing to understand, such as a dying man rising and singing a song or a woman cheating a man for a set of traffic lights.\n\nThe show's second series in 2002 was written without the input of comic genius Graham Lineham and as such did seem to be lacking a lot of the humour. There were a greater number of sketches which I didn't find very funny or had a punchline, although there were still many which I found hilarious. A man who grows giant when exposed to the sun for too long and a child whose apparent face paint turned out to be her natural markings from some weird tiger-human race were brilliantly bizarre, although did not appeal as much as the earlier programmes.\n\nBig Train is certainly a programme aimed at a specific audience, and it will doubtless not appeal to the greater public at large. For me and my friends it presented a great show amidst the tedious and sho\n\nrt-lived sitcoms of the late 90s, and I look forward to May when it is finally being released on DVD.\n\nAdvantages: Fantastic actors and writers\n\nDisadvantages: Won't appeal to a lot of people\n\nBig Train – Series One and Two\n\nJockeys... Something Must've Spooked 'Em\n\n****\n\nWritten on 11.01.06\n\nOne of the best sketch shows of the last decade, Big Train was written by Father Ted's Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews, who appear occasionally as bit-parts in the sketches and may be recognised as the two Irish TV executives in 'I'm Alan Partridge.' The first series was transmitted in 1998 in a classic Monday night pairing with 'The League of Gentlemen,' its surreal fast-moving sketches the perfect compliment to the League's much darker, character-based humour.\n\nThe writers stated that their main aim with the show wasn't to try and be particularly clever or witty, and certainly wasn't to create a string of recognisable characters with catch-phrases that could be repeated in the school playground. As such, Big Train is funny, bizarre comedy at its best, a self-confessed result of Monty Python influence. Despite great dialogue, Big Train isn't highly quotable, but definitely leaves a lasting impression.\n\nBig Train beats Python in one area, and that is the quality of the acting. While John Cleese's irritable customer character is a deserved comedy legend, the Python team were only usually equipped to perform the roles they'd written with themselves in mind, and did little more than a funny voice to distinguish themselves between sketches. The performers of Big Train are established modern comedy greats, despite (initially) all coming from roughly the same comedy background, i.e. things written by people from 'On the Hour,' the groundbreaking radio news spoof that became 'The Day Today.'\n\nThe first series of Big Train saw Simon Pegg (of later 'Spaced' and 'Shaun of the Dead' fame), Mark Heap ('Brass Eye') and Kevin Eldon ('Fist of Fun') playing the male roles, accompanied by Amelia Bullmore (Alan Partridge's Ukranian girlfriend) and Julia Davis (writer and star of 'Nighty Night') (apologies for all the brackets). The writers realised afterwards that they hadn't featured the women quite as much as they would have liked, and this limited presence perhaps makes it less shocking that they were replaced for the later second series when unavailable by more famous faces.\n\nTracy-Ann Oberman ('EastEnders'), Rebecca Front ('The Day Today') and Catherine Tate ('The Catherine Tate Show') did an admirable job of filling their shoes.\n\nThis DVD features both series of the show across 12 episodes. The second series was created a few years after the first, and there is a noticeable difference in image quality and style, the latter of which results from Graham Linehan's absence. Matthews brought in a number of additional writers for one-off sketches, while a lot of material was again improvised or suggested by the performers. The first series is more consistently funny, the second relying a little too much on attempts at \"disturbing humour\" that are sometimes excellent but sometimes too weird to be particularly funny, and every episode of the first series also features competitors from 'The World Stare-Out Championship': the part of the show that divides fans the most, an animated battle of staring between funny-looking men that is funny at first, seeing the packed arena hanging on every second of these unblinking men, but almost immediately has to rely on silly occurrences to keep it interesting, but distract from the basic joke of the tedious sport.\n\nThe humour is all of a certain style, meaning it won't appeal to everyone. A common recurring theme derives humour from displacing events and people, notably a Western shoot-out between the BeeGees and Chaka Khan and a fantastic parody of the battle between good and evil that sees Jesus as the manager of an office (or at least a man with a beard, a white robe and a crown of thorns on his head) getting fed up with the mischievous antics of an employee who looks like Satan (i.e. red with horns and the ability to set people on fire).\n\nThe sketches also avoid irony and satire whenever possible, and it seems that Linehan and Matthews are almost offended when people view the \"w**king in the office\" sketch as a parody of no-smoking rules. As long as you're able to get used to this literal approach, the results are very rewarding, despite being pointless. Those who enjoy high budget television should be impressed with Big Train's constant move between convincing replicas of Nazi Germany, monasteries, the English civil wars and the Roman Empire all within a few minutes. Even as a big fan of the series, and someone who thinks comedy shows are often overlooked by heads of programming, I find it questionable whether they should have been given all that money... assuming they were, and didn't just have a brilliant and resourceful production crew.\n\nDespite the high quality of the writing and acting, it's clear when watching the episodes in succession that the programme wasn't taken too seriously by its creators, and this makes it all the more laid-back and enjoyable to watch. Characters and scenes crop up a second time, weeks after being seen, in small sketches based on dialogue, and the audio commentaries confirm that these were essentially funny things that the actors improvised to make further use of the costumes. The friendships and good working relationships between the cast and writers allows for some vast improvements, such as Pegg's \"does anyone want to see my monkey impression?\" finale tagged on to the Ritz/Titz sketch which would otherwise have gone out on quite a poor punchline.\n\nEach series features a celebratory musical performance for its climax performed by Kevin Eldon, a nice and satisfying conclusion to a couple of great series. The first series' is better than that of the second, the usual response to comparing the two series, seeing the death of Chairman Mao (Eldon) and his inexplicable resurrection to perform Roxy Music's 'Virginia Plain' in what I'm told is a faithful recreation of its original music video. The second series' more contrived conclusion of a Frankenstein / Dexy's Midnight Runners scenario is cut off before it really gets anywhere, but it's still a nice idea.\n\nA two-disc set that was a long time postponed from the original release date, the Big Train DVD is good value for money. As well as a very handy scene selection that links to every individual sketch, meaning that less favourite ones can be skipped, there are audio commentaries to all the episodes. These occasionally feature the cast (mostly in the first series) which leads to some funny moments such as Eldon criticising Pegg for innocently name-dropping 'Shaun of the Dead' out of admitted jealousy, as well as the very frank and honest views of everyone involved over what worked and what could have been improved. Linehan and Matthews are especially critical of the way they occasionally resort to cheap punchlines when they can't think of a satisfying conclusion, such as making the \"child slaves forced to write puns for radio\" and \"passing other peoples' opinions off as your own\" sketches into adverts at the last minute.\n\nThe deleted scenes are the best extra on this set, totalling 30 minutes for the first series and arranged essentially as a seventh episode (even featuring the title sequence after the opening sketch). On the whole these are inferior to the episodes themselves, but some were blatantly cut for reasons of time: I'm sure many of the longer sketches in the Big Train episodes must have been heavily edited from the stock footage, based largely as they are on improvisation, and some of the deleted scenes here really do drag on. 'Hopeless Extra' doesn't really get any funnier each time Mark Heap's character messes up a take, and the recurring 'Time Share' segments simply repeat a joke over and over. The opening 'Nosebleed' sketch deserved to be cut purely because Mark Heap's convincing acting makes it very disturbing to watch, perhaps succeeding a little too well. (Fans of Chris Morris' 'Jam' series should like it though). The deleted scenes are all usefully divided up just like the episodes, and the real highlight comes at the end with the epic 'Battle of Sledgby: 8th July 1646.' Although it starts a little blandly, Parliamentarian Englishmen against a force of hens not really being inherently funny once the viewer is accustomed to the show's style, the final scene at a modern day memorial site, seeing hens with cameras around their necks milling amongst the human tourists, is the highlight of this piece.\n\nOther features include comprehensive and almost completely up-to-date biographies and credits for all performers and writers (the DVD was released last Easter), photo galleries and subtitles. There's also an interesting extra on the second disc featuring two scenes from 'Geht's Noch,' the German version of Big Train that was shot and performed, it appears from these clips, as an exact copy of the original (but in German, obviously). The sketches featured are the hospital phone call from series 1, one of Pegg's best performances as he can't bring himself to put down the phone on a talkative friend despite needing to attend a dying patient, the afore-mentioned Onanism in the office, and the boss' spoon phobia.\n\nThis extra is fun but, in the end, completely pointless and unnecessary. Much like the series. The backgrounds to the menus are also a nice treat, recreating sketches from each relevant series in miniature puppet form, most notably the parody of Hitchcock's 'The Birds' on the episode selection for disc 2. These menus would doubtless provide several minutes of entertainment on their own, if you are that way inclined.\n\nThe DVD can be bought for £13.99 on Play.com and 2 pence cheaper on Amazon.co.uk, but sans the free delivery, and with 12 episodes across 2 well-produced discs, it's not a bad price at all.\n\nBlackadder the Third\n\nYou Could Start By Not Calling Me Bladders, Sir\n\n****\n\nWritten on 03.07.04 [2015 Bladders rewatch]\n\nThe third series of the Richard Curtis and Ben Elton penned historical sitcom Blackadder faced the challenge of making \"a period in history nobody knows about\" funny. As History lessons had ensured I had a general knowledge of British society and Government of the time, the show's only goal as far as I was concerned was to make a period of history that is incredibly boring, funny. 'Blackadder the Third' excels at this and although perhaps not as widely seen as the hugely popular second and fourth series of the show, the plots and humour are up to the same high standard.\n\nCAST\n\nBlackadder: \"Hundreds of years from now, I want episodes from my life to be played out weekly at 9:30 by some great heroic actor of the age.\"\n\nBaldrick: \"Yes, and I could be played by some tiny tit in a beard.\"\n\nROWAN ATKINSON is still the star of the show, playing the world-weary, sarcastic Edmund Blackadder, fallen from his nobility and now nothing more than a butler to the Prince. The character evolves with each series; this time round he is a little less arrogant due to his servile occupation, although the lack of beard also has an impact on this. The hair was apparently only absent because Rowan's girlfriend despised it.\n\nTONY ROBINSON is again excellent as the pathetic and lowliest of life forms, S. Baldrick. Still as stupid as in the second series, Baldrick has an unhealthy fascination with turnips and highwaymen, his unfortunate lack of common sense and intellect confirming Blackadder's view that \"if you want something done properly, kill Baldrick before you start.\"\n\nHUGH LAURIE plays the incomprehensible stupid Prince Regent, the only main character based entirely on a genuine historical figure, and in some ways fills in for Tim McInnerny's Percy character from the earlier series, although Percy wouldn't spend weeks attempting to put on a pair of trousers. Laurie's convincing portrayal of the idiotic Prince led to his return in Blackadder Goes Forth as an upper-class lieutenant of a similar mental disposition.\n\nAs a mainstream and highly popular comedy series, Blackadder continued to attract familiar talent from its own past and from other shows. Stephen Fry is excellent as the ruthless Lord Wellington in the final episode and Miranda Richardson plays a highway(wo)man and giggling fool: both had been in the regular cast of Blackadder II. Red Dwarf's Chris Barrie affects a French accent to play a swaggering ambassador who is \"hung like a baby carrot,\" Robbie Coltrane dons a wig and a high voice for Samuel Johnson and the Young Ones' Nigel Planer is the Scarlet Pimpernel. Sadly no roles for Rik Mayall or Adrian Edmondson in this series, although Tim McInnerny (formerly Lord Percy and later Captain Darling) makes a brief appearance as a nobleman.\n\nEPISODES\n\nThere are six half-hour episodes of Blackadder the Third, all of which are excellent: 'Dish and Dishonesty' is a heavily satirical opening to the series concerning elections and huge turnips; 'Ink and Incapability' sees the writer of the first English Dictionary threatening to kill Blackadder after Baldrick accidentally burns the only copy; 'Nob and Nobility' celebrates the French revolution but not really the French people; 'Sense and Senility' depicts the Prince's pathetic attempts at acting; 'Amy and Amiability' is a romantic tale of sorts in which the potential bride for the Prince must on no account meet him before agreeing, and the conclusion 'Dual and Duality' is an epic fight to the death and a take on the Prince and the Porpoise.\n\nThe interaction between the main characters and with the guest stars is the driving force behind the show, but rather than being a The Office-style exploration of the performers in different emotional states, Blackadder was still very much plot-based in a similar way to the earlier Fawlty Towers (except the hotel is a palace, Baldrick isn't from Barcelona and the boss is an insane German all the time, not just in one over-repeated scene). The period costumes are all excellent and aid a great deal in the believability, and in the whole series there is only one set that looks genuinely unconvincing, although this is covered by Blackadder's description of \"an unrealistic grassy knoll.\"\n\nThe self-contained plots of each episode make it an easy task to remember which one is which, aided by the moving video clips on the 'episode select' menu of the DVD. You may also notice that each episode's title is linked to its plot or theme: very clever.\n\nTHE HUMOUR\n\nThe style of comedy in Blackadder the Third is similar to what has come before, but is a little more refined. The silliness that was heavily present in Blackadder II has been toned down but still shows itself occasionally in the form of the Standing at the Back Dressed Stupidly and Looking Stupid Party and a tray reverse-falling into Blackadder's hands, but there is a great deal more political humour in this series a la Yes Minister (which my brother likes) or the New Statesman (which I have seen and is rubbish). Although I can tolerate current affairs comedy shows as long as they aren't rubbish I don't usually find political comedy that funny, mainly as I'm so ill-informed on such matters, but at least in Blackadder it's fairly universal: still, claiming that \"a violent, bigoted, mindless old fool\" is \"a bit overqualified\" for a job as an MP does seem quite tired today, although I'm sure those alternative comedy eighties anarchists loved it.\n\nIt's relieving that despite this desire to criticise the Government through the ages, the traditional Blackadder humour of cynicism and odd comparisons is still present. Blackadder described Samuel Johnson's Dictionary as \"the most pointless book since 'How to Learn French' was translated into French\" and claims that the Prince Regent has \"a brain the size of a weasel's wedding tackle,\" but the length and frequency of these statements are thankfully kept under control rather than being overused, as was the case in the fourth series. Although saying that, \"madder than Mad Jack McMad the winner of this year's Mr. Madman competition\" does push it a bit, but it's funny hearing Rowan handling all those syllables.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThe themes of murder and corruption inherent to all Blackadder series make it a fairly dark comedy, although this is balanced out by the light-hearted attitude of the dialogue and performances. While 'Blackadder II' is often viewed as the funniest series, which it probably is, and 'Blackadder Goes Forth' applauded for its compassion to those that gave their lives in the First World War, (and 'The Black Adder' tolerated for not being as good as the other ones), Blackadder the Third had an interesting choice of setting, and could have failed dramatically if not for the success of its earlier incarnations. Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson are as good as ever, while Hugh Laurie's Prince George is an excellent newcomer to the franchise who plays off Atkinson perfectly. Some of the points discussed in this series actually helped me in my History lessons as well, although that didn't serve to make this study of it more interesting.\n\nThe DVD, which can be more affordably acquired as part of 'the Complete Blackadder' set, presents the episodes and their soundtracks in the highest quality possible but is devoid of any real extras apart from English subtitles. Had the Blackadder sets been released more recently the BBC may have felt pressured to include some special features such as interviews or even commentary tracks due to the popularity of the series, especially given the age of the programme and the accomplishments of all the main stars since then.\n\nSodoff Baldrick's novel, BALDRICK:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a lovely little sausage called Baldrick,\n\nand it lived happily ever after.\n\n\"It's semi-autobiographical.\"\n\nBlackadder's Christmas Carol\n\nSchwarze Weihnachten\n\n****\n\nWritten on 16.09.04\n\nHave you ever been uncertain whether a peculiar memory in your mind was a dream or a scene in a 1988 Christmas special on BBC 2? I, as I am sure you will be aware having just read that, have. Several years ago, when reading the blurb “featuring further filthier Blackadders” in the book containing all the scripts across the four series of Richard Curtis’ and Ben Elton’s legendary sitcom, my mind had been alerted to a faded vision of a futuristic cyberpunk space pirate Blackadder accompanied by an bondage-clad Baldrick slave.\n\nThat potential sexual confusion was thankfully laid to rest when I recently saw ‘Blackadder’s Christmas Carol’ for the first time in ten years, an enjoyable festive tale featuring Blackadder incarnations from the distant past to the flashy, sexually-repulsive future, now available on DVD.\n\nYE STORIE\n\nIt is the end of the nineteenth century, and respected businessman Ebenezer Blackadder is preparing for a selfless Christmas period of love and happiness between fellow men, and his smelly but oddly likeable apprentice Baldrick. Blackadder’s generosity is well-known, but there are many unfortunate souls living in industrialised London town who are willing to take advantage of his endless compassion and rapidly dwindling wealth.\n\nAs Blackadder tucks into bed on Christmas Eve, having given away everything he painstakingly prepared for the morning, he is visited by a ghost bearing the face and stout body of Robbie Coltrane, who offers glimpses into Blackadder’s ancestry. From the curmudgeonly favourite of Elizabeth I, the long-suffering butler of the Prince Regent and beyond, Blackadder is taught a valuable lesson in self-obsession and charity beginning at home, and remaining there.\n\nCAST\n\nThe performers and characters remained reasonably stationary throughout the run of Blackadder, leading to most of them appearing here in various recognisable and original guises. Rowan Atkinson is the clear star of the show, his charitable Ebenezer still being very witty and enjoyable although clearly not up to the standard of the traditional incarnations. The reappearance of the bearded Blackadder from series two will please fans of that particularly successful series (even though the clearly artificial beard is a little distracting), while the Blackadder III characters were so recent to all concerned when this was produced that it doesn’t even feel like a step backwards.\n\nTony Robinson’s Victorian Baldrick is identical to the dogsbody of series 3, leading to some classic idiot scenes, most notably when he manages to spell ‘Christmas’ without getting a single letter correct, revealed in full at the close of the end credits. In an alternate futuristic scene, a glimpse into what will evidently transpire if Blackadder doesn’t return to his curmudgeonly ways, Baldrick even gets a chance to play the dominant role. He is still stupid though, accidentally causing an intergalactic war.\n\nMiranda Richardson and Stephen Fry reprise their roles as Lord Melchett and Queen Elizabeth, while Hugh Laurie again dons the ridiculous wig and large trousers for the role of the Prince Regent, all three also appearing in the galactic council scene. The absence of Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy is a little disappointing and makes the Blackadder II segment seem lacking, but McInnerny had declined the Percy role in series three for fear of being typecast as the bumbling oaf: this proved very successful when he did return for Blackadder Goes Forth as Captain Darling, who was very different from Percy but had the same number of friends.\n\nAll performers involved were excellent in their scenes, only seeming less inspired when the writing wasn’t quite up to scratch. Miriam Margolyes and Jim Broadbent, actors who had previously appeared in Blackadder series among other roles, have some enjoyable scenes as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, although there’s still no sign of Rik Mayall’s Lord Flashheart.\n\nTHE DVD\n\nIt always seems a little unfair when the BBC release a forty-five minute Christmas special for the same price as a three-hour series, but fortunately this DVD has come down in price below the ten pound mark over time. There are no special features apart from the usual chapter selection, and it’s never been clear why the BBC didn’t add this release, along with the compilation of other Blackadder specials, to their otherwise excellent ‘Complete Blackadder’ collection. The picture quality is as expected for a full-screen eighties BBC release.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThis is a high quality Christmas special that shows very few signs of inferiority to the classic series themselves. Some of the more experimental sections are a little far-fetched and less funny as a result, in particular the very low budget future scene that shows exactly why Blackadder was successful in a historical context, but the main setting of Victorian England works excellently in the first half. The call-backs to the second and third series (not the very different Blackadder character from the first series, for obvious reasons of confusion as well as budget) work as well as they can be expected to within such brief amounts of time, but they aren’t really anything special. The notion of the reverse Scrooge is enjoyable in its simplicity, and even though the ending is very obvious, it’s the return to form that the viewer has been anticipating throughout.\n\nVery easy to overlook but worthy of repeat playing, ‘Blackadder’s Christmas Carol’ is far superior to the 1999 ‘Back and Forth’ special as it catches the writers, performers and even the viewers while the Blackadder saga is still in motion. The final series ‘Blackadder Goes Forth’ appeared the following year to huge acclaim, this Christmas special whetting fans’ appetites for tales of dastardly cunning and idiocy.\n\nAdvantages: More classic Blackadder, Elizabethan setting works excellently, Cast and crew on top form\n\nDisadvantages: DVD release is a little disappointing and sparse, Some characters missing, some dodgy decisions\n\nBlackadder Goes Forth\n\nYour Long Wait for Certain Death is Nearly at an End\n\n*****\n\nWritten on 28.04.04\n\nRecently hailed as Britain's second favourite sitcom, the Blackadder series provides high quality humour and likeable characters for all generations, despite the fact that the majority of it is set centuries before they were even conceived. Most people have their particular favourite series, but the fourth and final series made in 1989 is often the most memorable; the jokes and characters were at an all-time high, while its portrayal of life in the trenches of World War I managed to be satirically biting, hilarious and moving.\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\n\n'Blackadder Goes Forth' appeared on British television screens on 28th September 1989 and had the usual six-week run of a comedy series. Long-time viewers were already well accustomed to the characters established in the previous years, and in some cases there was the return of old favourites.\n\nROWAN ATKINSON stars as the eponymous CAPTAIN EDMUND BLACKADDER, the sarcastic and world-weary captain of the featured trench. The character of Edmund Blackadder was firmly established in 1985's 'Blackadder II,' and Rowan Atkinson's portrayal of the only sane character out of the bunch is what kept this series popular. Without the advantage of high political status or camaraderie with royalty, the Blackadder of this series loses an amount of smugness, and he is unable to seek quick escapes so easily.\n\nTONY ROBINSON is his usual excellent self playing the filthy and incredibly stupid PRIVATE S. BALDRICK. The classic oppressed mass of the series, it is impossible not to feel sympathy for Baldrick whilst also revelling when he is treated like the piece of filth that he is. The major change in the character from the previous series is that he is now far stupider, from actions such as carving his name into a bullet to literally failing to tell his arse from his elbows.\n\nHUGH LAURIE regresses from his role as the idiotic Prince George in 'Blackadder the Third' to play the equally stupid, but far less important, LIEUTENANT GEORGE here. Laurie once again excels at bringing the loud imbecile to life, and this offers plenty of material for the writing team to discuss the benefits, and lack of, of public school education. Fans of the Fry and Laurie double-act will doubtless have been delighted by the numerous interactions between the two actors in this series.\n\nGENERAL MELCHETT, played by STEPHEN FRY, is another very memorable and popular character, and is a perfectly exaggerated example of the foolish and ignorant Generals responsible for actions in the First World War. The previous Melchett character in 'Blackadder II' was far different and not as funny, but Stephen Fry manages to steal every scene he is in with the braying moustachioed fool.\n\nTIM McINNERNY plays CAPTAIN KEVIN DARLING, the final regular character in the series, the pen-pushing assistant to Melchett who would be a valuable asset to the war if not for his abject cowardice and offensive personality. Tim McInnerny previously played the foolish character of Percy in the first two series, the equivalent of Lieutenant George here, but turned down a regular role in series 3 for fear of being typecast. The character here is so different that it took me a long time to even realise it was the same actor. There are also many jokes made regarding his nickname which are certainly cheap shots, but which the viewer cannot help but find very funny. It's all in the timing.\n\nBeing a popular series, Blackadder had its share of talented comedy actors in cameo roles and this final series is no different. Miranda Richardson, famous as Queen Elizabeth in Blackadder II, returns as a nurse in one episode, but the most impressive cameo is by Rik Mayall's Squadron Commander Flashheart in episode four; the self-obsessed ladies' man once again completely steals the show, and it makes for a great episode.\n\nEPISODES\n\nA brief look at the plots of the episodes does not really do them justice, but it is fair to say that they are all classics in their own right, with the finale being the most recognised and perhaps the best of the lot. Still being a comedy series, there is no real plot, other than the situation and the interaction of the characters, that links the episodes together, and so missing an episode would not dampen the enjoyment of the others. Brief synopses are taken from the book 'Blackadder: the Whole Damn Dynasty,' with my opinions to follow, along with a suitable quote to describe the state of the war.\n\n'CAPTAIN COOK' - When General Haig unveils his new strategy to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin, Blackadder volunteers to be Official War Artist.\n\nA very funny episode to start the series, each character is given time to shine. Blackadder comes across as scheming and very cunning, while the ever-present danger of the trenches is highlighted towards the end, almost to foreshadow the series' end.\n\nBlackadder: \"Would this brilliant plan involve us climbing over the top of our trenches and walking slowly towards the enemy?\"\n\nMelchett: \"How do you know that, Blackadder? It's classified information.\"\n\nBlackadder: \"It's the same plan that we used last time, sir. And the seventeen times before that.\"\n\n'CORPORAL PUNISHMENT' - Order for Operation Insanity arrive and Blackadder breaches regulations by eating the messenger. Can the Flanders Pigeon Murderer avoid the Firing Squad?\n\nMuch more focus on Blackadder in this episode, the notion of disobeying foolish orders is important for the series. Needless to say, the characters are all quick to forget about this incident afterwards, but it is a comedy show first and a drama fifth.\n\nBlackadder: \"Oh, come on. With 50,000 men getting killed each week, who's going to miss a pigeon?\"\n\n'MAJOR STAR' - The Russian Revolution produces two more appalling results: an offensive by Germany and a really offensive Charlie Chaplin impression by Baldrick.\n\nSome light relief from the trench life, this is an opportunity for the characters to at least enjoy themselves a little, with the incentive always being that their new careers may take them away from the front lines. Melchett is particularly good in this one, as he falls in love with George's drag act and asks him to marry him.\n\nBlackadder: \"A war hasn't been fought this badly since Olaf the Hairy, High Chief of all the Vikings, accidentally ordered 80,000 battle helmets with the horns on the inside.\"\n\n'PRIVATE PLANE' - German machine-guns in front. British firing squads behind- the only way out is up tiddly up-up.\n\nPerhaps my favourite episode, the focus on the Blackadder/Baldrick relationship is a highlight here, along with Rik Mayall as Flashheart and Adrian Edmondson as the mad German Baron von Richthofen. There is also a feeling of excitement, despite the fact that it is clearly not Baldrick flying the plane on film!\n\nFlashheart: \"Just because I can give multiple orgasms to the furniture just by sitting on it doesn't mean I'm not sick of this damn war. The blood, the noise, the endless poetry.\"\n\n'GENERAL HOSPITAL' - The secret of the Great Plan is out. Ordered to find a spy in the hospital, Blackadder spots a man with a strong German accent, a beautiful nurse and a chance for three weeks in bed.\n\nAnother chance for Rowan Atkinson to show his acting skills, this is another great episode that brings the focus back to the grittier aspects of warfare.\n\nBlackadder: \"Oh I see. And that would be the plan to continue with total slaughter until everybody's dead except Field Marshall Haig and Lady Haig and their tortoise Alan.\"\n\nMelchett: \"Great Scott! Even you know it! This security leak is far worse than I'd imagined.\"\n\n'GOODBYEEE' - Millions have died but the troops have advanced no further than an asthmatic ant with some heavy shopping. Now, at last, the big push looms...\n\nBlackadder series always end with at least some of the main characters dying, and this is no exception. The dismal and inescapable life in the trenches is captured perfectly during this episode, and even Baldrick and George manage to seem saddened.\n\nGeorge: \"I don't want to die. I'm really not over keen on dying at all, sir.\"\n\nSTYLE & TONE\n\nThis series' success is partly due to its originality, and a lot of careful thought clearly went into its preparation. As usual the sets and costumes are very believable and historically accurate, and the setting of the Great War makes for a more emotional and hard-hitting show due to its harsh and violent nature, as well as the fact that it is much nearer to the present day than the previous series have been, making it less detached.\n\nThere have been many parodies and satires of the nature of World War I fighting, notably the famous play 'O What a Lovely War,' and especially the idea of \"lions led by donkeys.\" For me, the factor that elevates 'Blackadder Goes Forth' from a very funny show to a classic piece of television history is the fact that it is very relevant and truthful in its opinion of the First World War, and this has even led to quotes being included in History exams. My brother's GCSE paper utilised a piece of source material based on Blackadder's quote: \"We've been sitting here since Christmas 1914, during which time millions of men have died and we've moved no further than an asthmatic ant with heavy shopping.\" It's true, History really can be fun. Although my experience of learning far more than strictly necessary about Louis XIV did cause me to drop A-level History after a year due to sheer boredom.\n\nIf anyone can recall seeing an episode of Blackadder, there is a good chance it would be the final episode, which seems to have become a staple of every Remembrance Day and comedy celebration. Twenty five minutes of some of the funniest and well-researched jokes and several minutes at the end where the tone changes to one of sadness and regret, with the lead characters all leaping over the top of the trench and falling one by one, the image dissolving into that of a peaceful field of poppies to end the series.\n\nI cannot see how Ben Elton and Richard Curtis could have ended a series any more perfectly, as it sums up their respect for the courage of the fallen soldiers and the futility of such a war. The final line is: \"Whatever it was, I'm sure it was better than my plan to get out of this by pretending to be mad. I mean, who would have noticed another madman round here? Good luck everyone.\" Even the most hardened comedy viewer may have shed a tear for those men.\n\nPERSONAL NOTE\n\nThe humour aside, Blackadder Goes Forth is a much more interesting take on the First World War than most of the other resources available. I speak from experience, having read novels and poetry (\"the endless poetry\") and although they are very insightful and emotional, I much prefer being shown these messages through a medium that I enjoy. My three-hour English Literature exam on World War I literature will undoubtedly include my appreciation for this comedic masterpiece alongside more traditional sources.\n\nBottom – Series Three\n\nThe Prime Minister's Nipples\n\n****\n\nWritten on 09.08.06\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of ‘Fawlty Towers,’ writers of classic sitcoms strive to make the best possible use of the three televised hours granted to them per year, ending their shows after two series to leave viewers hungry for more. A sitcom based largely on erection gags and cartoonish violence, ‘Bottom’ was never going to be a classic sitcom. Made three years after the second series, this third and final batch of six episodes features some of the series’ finest and weakest shows.\n\nRichie Richard and Eddie Hitler (Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, who write the show) are still living in their filthy Hammersmith flat, still getting on each others’ nerves to the point of severe mutilation and still failing to get their respective ends away. As was the case in series two, half of the episodes focus entirely on the two main characters, while the rest incorporate a larger cast, including Eddie’s friends Spudgun and Dave Hedgehog. Almost as a rule, the former episode premise leads to more impressive results.\n\nDespite claims by the writers that Bottom was intended partially as an exploration of the inherent pointlessness of life (especially in middle age), series three could hardly be described as profound. The toilet humour has increased, most notably in the Halloween episode in which Richie repeatedly soils his tights when electrocuted, and plots are often more or less recycled from previous episodes. The notable exceptions come with the opening and closing episodes of the series, the memorable ‘Hole’ in which Richie and Eddie are trapped on the top car of a Ferris-wheel facing demolition by vengeful fairground staff, and the highly enjoyable ‘Carnival’ which sees the characters finally meet their demise (well, having already plummeting to certain doom in ‘Hole’).\n\n‘Hole’ is one of the best Bottom episodes, and came out on top in some unnecessary poll by the BBC in the mid-90s. The situation is entertaining enough in itself, but becomes increasingly dire and terrifying as the single thirty-minute scene progresses. This is far from perfect comedy, relying too often on slapstick as the series often does, and cheap pull-back-and-reveal gags, but there are some great exchanges. My favourite was always Richie’s obliviousness that ‘Keith’ who he had been pursuing all night was not in fact a woman; her alleged earring being “through her foreskin.”\n\nLike many episodes, ‘Terror’ tries too hard to extract all the humour possible from a crude premise, in this case Halloween festivities. The double-entendres reach their peak in the opening scene, which some people will find ridiculous but which I quite enjoy in its more desperate moments (“maybe we should eat our flakes … can I drink your juice?”). The scenes skip around from some disappointing trick-or-treat gags on an unconvincing outdoor set to a Halloween party in the flat that plays out as a less impressive re-make of the Christmas party from the previous series.\n\n‘Break’ sees the pair preparing for the holiday of a lifetime in gloomy Doncaster. It’s nice to see Richie pushed over the edge of ecstasy by childish excitement, rubbing his nipples with vigour as Eddie plays the boring straight man watching Emmerdale, but the show seems overlong by the time the far-from-dramatic conclusion arrives. Plenty of slapstick fight scenes, a penis in a v"
