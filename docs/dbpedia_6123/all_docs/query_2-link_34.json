        "text": "Bumbling man-servant Baldrick has a cunning plan and builds a time-machine out of old cereal packets for the Blackadder millennium special, it has emerged.\n\nVisitors to London's Millennium Dome will be able to see Blackadder and Baldrick travelling through the ages in the new film, Blackadder Back and Forth.\n\nTo be shown in the Skyscape events venue from 1 January, 2000, Rowan Atkinson stars as dapper Sir Edmund Blackadder.\n\nBut it's his faithful sidekick Baldrick, played by Tony Robinson, who builds a home-made time-machine from Leonardo da Vinci's designs.\n\nBlackadder II: ruff and tough in Tudor England\n\nBut the controls of Baldrick's craft prove difficult to manage and the duo spin randomly through history, causing chaos.\n\n\"Bringing Blackadder to the big screen has always been an ambition,\" said Atkinson.\n\n\"I am delighted to be realising it to celebrate the arrival of the 21st century, but extremely worried at the prospect of travelling through time with Baldrick.\"\n\nRobinson added: \"A lot of people say that they see Baldrick as an 'everyman' character and, if that's true, then I don't think it says much for a British character.\"\n\nThe film has been co-written by comic Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, who scripted the biggest grossing British movies of all time, Notting Hill and Four Weddings And A Funeral.\n\nCurtis said: \"It's all an irreverent trek through British history - a time travel adventure story consisting entirely of people who are either rude or stupid.\"\n\nGirl on film: Kate Moss meets Blackadder\n\nAtkinson and Robinson starred in four series of the BBC comedy Blackadder and were last united in Blackadder Goes Forth, shown 10 years ago this month.\n\nThe film, also featuring Kate Moss, Colin Firth, Rik Mayall, Miranda Richardson, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, will be shown on TV on Sky in 2001. The BBC also plans to screen it at a later date.\n\nTickets to the Dome go on sale on 22 September at a number of outlets including 25,000 National Lottery ticket sellers, or via the ticketline on 0870 606 2000 and the Dome website."
