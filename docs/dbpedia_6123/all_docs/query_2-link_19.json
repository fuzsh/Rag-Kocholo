        "text": "Blackadder\n\nTV sitcom\n\nBBC One\n\n1983 - 2000\n\n26 episodes (4 series)\n\nThe Blackadder dynasty has run through English history since time immemorial, seemingly always hampered by a Baldrick, and often a Percy and Melchett. Stars Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Tim McInnerny, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and more.\n\nStreaming rank this week: 135\n\nThe Black Adder (1983)\n\nThroughout the ages men of flair, faculty and outstanding courage have contributed to England's heritage. Others, like the snivelling worm Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh (alias The Black Adder), have emerged from the dust of dodgy documents to claim their wrongful place in history.\n\nBlackadder II (1986)\n\nEngland, 1558-1603. The filthy genes of the Blackadder dynasty bubble back to the surface of the melting pot of history as Lord Edmund, arrogant peer-about-town, swaggers back with a big head and small beard in search of grace and favour from stark raving mad Queen Bess.\n\nBlack Adder The Third (1987)\n\nEngland, 1760-1815. The Blackadder family's fortunes have rather plummeted with the advent of the Regency period and Edmund Blackadder, butler to the Prince Regent, veers from calamity to disaster.\n\n1988 Specials (1988)\n\nIn The Cavalier Years, it's November 1648 and King Charles I is in hiding from Cromwell and the Roundheads. In Blackadder's Christmas Carol, we visit Ebeneezer Blackadder, the nicest man in England - but perhaps not for much longer...\n\nBlackadder Goes Forth (1989)\n\nThe Western Front, 1917. Captain Blackadder joined the British Army when it was little more than a travel agency for gentlemen with an abnormally high sex drive. Now he's twenty yards from a lot of heavily armed people who want to kill him.\n\nPrince Of Wales Gala Special (1998)\n\nA five minute special produced for ITV's Prince of Wales's 50th Birthday Gala. It's King Charles II's 50th birthday, and Lord Blackadder has been invited to arrange a Royal Gala performance in celebration.\n\nBlackadder Back & Forth (2000)\n\nNew Year's Eve 1999 and Lord Edmumd Blackadder has assembled an assortment of his friends to celebrate the new millennium - and play a practical joke on, with an unusually cunning plan involving a time machine..."
