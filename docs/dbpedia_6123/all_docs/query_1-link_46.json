        "text": "\"So they wouldn't feel as warm about it, they wouldn't feel as good about it. Even if it was absolutely great, they'd probably go 'It's not like the old series, is it?'\"\n\nTony explained it was \"extraordinary\" for him to reprise his role as Baldrick and was pleased when he received the \"beautifully crafted script.\"\n\nHe added the \"brainless\" character also acts as a contrast with the more \"sophisticated\" roles played by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry.\n\nThis isn't the first time Tony has reprised his role as Baldrick after he and Rowan appeared in a previous Red Nose Day sketch in 1988.\n\n\"No act I do will be considered cutting edge because I’ll never be young again. I’ll never be the game-changer I was.\n\n\"So I’ll just carry on expressing myself as honestly as possible and trying to find as large an audience as I can.\n\n\"Not Blackadder again. I don’t think either of us feels any appetite to do that.”\n\nRed Nose Day returns to BBC One on March 17."
