        "text": "View Seattle's most famous musicians all in one place here.\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nThe Greatest Guitar Player Ever was born here and cut his teeth (with which he’d later play that guitar) jamming with local R&B bands.\n\nThe Sonics\n\nYou can say Patti Smith created protopunk in New York, or the Stooges in Detroit, or the Monks in Germany. But listen to the Sonics and you know Tacoma got there first.\n\nThe Fabulous Wailers\n\nThe Sonics might’ve eventually been more influential, but the Wailers were the local rock band.\n\nNirvana\n\nCobain and company pretty much invented airwave-ready angst. No band is more associated with this city.\n\nSleater-Kinney\n\nThe Olympian post-punk trio has repeatedly been anointed the “best band in the world.” Sounds absurd until you hear them.\n\nMacklemore & Ryan Lewis\n\nDorky white guys rapping about thrift stores and white privilege—they are, if nothing else, indicative.\n\nQueensrÿche\n\nInstead of engaging in the spandexiness of its contemporaries, the pop metal band perpetuated the righteously classic style of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.\n\nFleet Foxes\n\nThe neofolk outfit bent Beach Boys harmonies to Northwest lushness and reushered some unabashed beauty into our sound.\n\nBrandi Carlile\n\nThis region raised a contemporary country singer who’s actually good.\n\nQuincy Jones\n\nA Garfield High School alum who became a musician, producer, and film-score composer of incomparable influence.\n\nThe Fleetwoods\n\nEven if largely forgotten, the doo-wop trio were our first chart-topping stars.\n\nPearl Jam\n\nBasically a PNW U2—arena rock kings who also do things like raise $11 million to fight homelessness.\n\nRay Charles\n\nThe R&B icon’s two years in Seattle were formative both for him and for his friend Quincy Jones.\n\nFoo Fighters\n\nDave Grohl’s major post-Nirvana band. They aren’t revolutionizing anything, but it’s nice to have a stalwart.\n\nSoundgarden\n\nTo know how much Seattle has loved Soundgarden, you just need to know that Chris Cornell is one of our only rock stars to be made into a statue.\n\nSir Mix-a-Lot\n\nThe man who hit the bigtime with a paean to big butts spent much of his career cataloguing the lives of black Seattleites (and still lives in Black Diamond).\n\nModest Mouse\n\nWho else has found a way to merge philosophy student lyrics to carnival barker vocals and nimble mesmeric guitar rock?\n\nSub Pop\n\nSince starting 30 years ago, the label and its Hardly Art offshoot have tirelessly championed Seattle music.\n\nFastbacks\n\nSimply one of the best and longest playing punk bands in the city.\n\nErnestine Anderson\n\nOf the major musicians who came out of Seattle in the first half of the twentieth century, Anderson was one of the most talented, and one of the only to return.\n\nDuff McKagan\n\nThe former Guns ‘N Roses bassist started out playing in local punk bands like the Fartz. He now spends his time telling people he’s the inspiration for The Simpsons’s Duff Beer.\n\nKathleen Hanna\n\nThe Bikini Kill, Le Tigre, and Julie Ruin frontwoman remains the ultimate feminist punk.\n\nDave Matthews Band\n\nWhat it sounds like when marijuana and polarfleece become sentient (see \"The Sainthood of Dave Matthews Has Been Indefinitely Postponed\").\n\nSunny Day Real Estate\n\nAn emo progenitor, whom we shall not fault for the genre’s many subsequent sins.\n\nHeart\n\nThe hard-rocking Wilson sisters led the only major band to come out of the Seattle area in the 1970s.\n\nMudhoney\n\nThirty years of the fuzz punks testify to an undersung fact: Our music is fun.\n\nBen Gibbard\n\nThe Postal Service and Death Cab for Cutie frontman is indie rock royalty.\n\nAlice in Chains\n\nTheir dingy metal is a reminder that our early ’90s music had more to do with locale than genre.\n\nThe Ventures\n\nThe band’s dirty surf rock yielded some major hits, including the Hawaii Five-O theme song.\n\nBing Crosby\n\nBefore he became the King of Christmas, the Tacoma native picked up his jazz chops in Spokane and Seattle. Apparently, he even smoked weed with Louis Armstrong here."
