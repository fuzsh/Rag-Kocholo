        "text": "Norman with Dorothy Squires, Roger Moore – one of you will identify the fourth character\n\nWe left Norman, as with George Martin and Wally Ridley, bemoaning the fact that the producers never received any credit on the record labels or sleeves, never mind a royalty, though by then they’d mastered the trick of writing B-sides for singles under an assumed name and benefitting from 50% of the publishing royalty! Anyway, we move on to a random final section of name dropping…..\n\nI met Johnny Mathis in America on one of the sessions and I thought he was sensational. He came over and appeared at what is now the Hammersmith Apollo, and his agent rang me. I’d got this kind of reputation, and he asked if I would record Johnny. We made an album of all British songs. Of course I also recorded Marlene Dietrich who was one of the most exciting women. She kind of took a liking to me and when she went to appear in Monte Carlo she asked me to accompany her. She made a date for me to go and see Somerset Maugham. I thought ‘oh my God.’ She said to be ready for 7.00 but then phoned to say she’d got such a terrible headache she was going to stay in. (She was a terrible fibber, always pretending to be someone else on the phone), but looking over the balcony I saw she was being picked up by Yves Montand! We made several albums with her, the most famous being Where have all the flowers gone . After a tremendous run of recording and accompanying her, Burt Bacharach took over. She called me one day at home and said would I come up to the Dorchester and meet someone. I was free so I went up and there was Burt Bacharach. I didn’t know then who the hell he was, but she helped his career a great deal. Every evening we used to go back to the Dorchester where she had the Oliver Messel suite, and the guests at her Cafe de Paris evening went back with us…so I met some fantastic people and heard some wonderful conversation, especially about Hollywood.\n\nTeddy Holmes introduced me to Noel Coward. He wanted to make an LP and said “Norman Newell must make it.” We became great friends. In fact one of dinner dates was with Noel, Marlene Dietrich and a newspaper columnist who was killed at the Grand National. (Nancy Spain?). I made a lot of records with Noel as well as the show Cowardy Custard, though Lady Windermere’s Fan was a flop. My favourite work was recording musicals. I always recorded them in the studio. To me you never got the same atmosphere in the theatre. I did do a couple (in theatres). The last was Tomfoolery which was done with an audience because there was lots of laughter, but it didn’t help if you were doing something like Sound of Music.\n\nThe first time I met Ken Dodd his manager phoned and said Ken would like to work with me. He’d made an album and had a big hit Love is like a Violin for Decca. I found this song, Tears, and on the first session I did with him we recorded Tears and The river, which were both No. 1’s, and the B-sides. Ken did them in about two hours and then went back to Liverpool. From then on he did about 60-70 ‘takes’. One thing about Ken – he was always an amusing person. He still lives in the same place he was born in, in Liverpool. I think he’s got other places as well. He always finished his act with a song. His compilations sell extremely well, but I don’t get the royalties from them. I wrote a lot of songs for him but he keeps them in his own company – I never get the money from them. In the early days I had to write under a pseudonym as the company didn’t approve of these outside interests. I can’t believe I wrote Portrait of my love under the name of David West. But I went there (EMI or Philips?) as a writer. Other producers, except Johnny Franz, were not very interested in songs by Norman Newell. My awards for Portrait of my love are under Norman Newell but the public didn’t know that. When I did something at the Mayfair for Barry Mason he said ‘just sing one of your songs, or speak it’ , as I said I can’t sing it. He said ‘which one do you want to do?’ and I said Portrait of my love. He said ‘you didn’t write that’ and I told them I did. It’s sad. Frank Sinatra recorded two of mine, Softly Softly and Forget Domani from The Yellow Rolls Royce. I got so fed up with this business of changing my name, because they found out in the end that it was me and that was that! I said to Teddy Holmes at Chappell ‘put any name you like on it – I don’t care; I’m sick of it.’ So he put Bond, as in Bond Street where Chappells Publishing was. But I couldn’t believe it when I saw ‘Mary’ in front of Bond. I said ‘you must be joking. I’ll be a laughing stock if this becomes a hit.’ It did become a hit – Come what may.\n\nI was having a meal with Teddy Holmes and he said ‘have you listened to Geoff Love’s work?’ I said ‘no’ and he said ‘he’s got tremendous talent’. That was the same with Wally Stott, but that’s another story! I think he (Geoff) did banjo records in the beginning, then we had a series called Party Time, then Manuel of course. I went to see a film called The Honeymoon at the Odeon Leicester Square. I heard the theme which I thought was wonderful, so I said to him ‘look Geoff, I want about eight guitars, lovely strings and the rest is up to you but I want to try and convey what the film is all about.’ Well, it became a very big success. What I think is so wrong is that if a cowboy song was a hit everyone would copy it, but this was so different we couldn’t call it ‘Geoff Love and his Orchestra.’ I’m a great believer in the letter M. If the letter M is around, I think I’m lucky, so I said ‘why don’t we call it Manuel and his Music of the Mountains?. That was fine until America said that ‘music of the mountains’ sounds like country music, so over there is was Manuel and his Marvelous Music or something like that! But his big success of course was his guitar concerto. We were in America together when someone phoned through and said it was No.1. Actually it never reached No.1; that was a mistake, but it was No.2 for a long time.\n\nNorman and Geoff Love with Gracie Fields (?)\n\nNorrie Paramor had a successful series with a banjo band so we just thought we’d do it too. Mandingo was before its time. It was about 8 tympani and all the drummers available and then the strings were added afterwards.\n\nI recorded all the pianists really – Mrs Mills, Russ Conway of course. I’m very proud of Russ. Funnily enough he was introduced to me as being a composer who wrote lyrics. I wrote lyrics with him for about six months. He came into my office to play me a new tune and I was looking for a pianist. I thought ‘my God, he’s been around all this time; he’s handsome; he’s got a personality; he plays marvellously and I hadn’t recognised it.’ So I said ‘how would you like to make a record?’ He said ‘you must be joking’. I said ‘well, we can’t use your name (Trevor Sandford) so I chose Conway because Steve Conway was one of my favourite people, but I don’t know who suggested Russ. We didn’t have any great success with the songs we wrote together, but Jeannie was a hit for Danny Williams.\n\nHow did the group scene impact on your career?\n\nI was allowed to do what I liked, but I felt the pop scene that was developing was not for me. Remember Shirley (Bassey) and Ken (Dodd) were around then and Des O’Connor. Those people were all around so I had plenty to do and if anybody came along like Manfred Mann I’d pass them over to John (Burgess) who did a great job. When George (Martin) started his own company John went with him and I don’t blame him at all. I think he always thought that I was annoyed not to have been asked to be one of the team. I was very lucky with my assistants, John first, Tony Macaulay, Bob Barrett. Bob was my assistant for a while, then Norrie offered him a job and through Norrie he became a record producer. I started him on his career.\n\nWhen the others walked out it made a tremendous change to the way things were done. George was responsible for the royalty payments situation and the name situation. It wasn’t too long after George left that I left myself. I thought I’d do better on my own. But I didn’t really. It was a time where really the only type of record selling was a beat record, though there were occasions when people like Shirley came through. I was always recording musicals. One of the greatest thrills of my life was going to America about ten years ago (c.1990) to record On Your Toes. I think I was the first English producer to record an American musical. I had great resistance at first from the American producers. I was so nervous, never slept a wink that night, went to St. Peters (church?) in the morning saying ‘Please help me get it right.’ It was a magical experience – didn’t get paid much though!\n\nI’ve been writing recently with Les Reed, the first songwriter to get the OBE, I think. When I think of Philips (Records) today I can compare it with the one office we started in, with me sitting on the floor! Their early artists were people I brought there..Ronnie Carroll, who sang one of my songs Say Wonderful Things in the Eurovision Song Contest. My first American artist was Judy Garland – that was a nerve-wracking night. She was quite big at the time, had done concerts at Carnegie Hall, and appeared at the Dominion (London) to tremendous acclaim. She wanted a record made called It’s lovely to be back in London and wanted me to alter the lyrics. I was so nervous about the whole thing. I waited at EMI for her to arrive and I looked at her and said ‘how are you?’ and she said ‘I’m petrified and nervous’ so then you have to take over and show them that you’re not. She was very nice but she wasn’t easy to work with. People say that Shirley’s not easy to work with but I find her tremendously easy. I haven’t kept up with anyone really. You go up to London and take Shirley out to lunch and she brings about six people! I’m not a mean person but unless she wants me to do a lyric for her (and she hasn’t for ages)…. She might not be very pleased that one of my last records, made in Italy, was Pavarotti and Celine Dion doing a version of my song Never never never which they called I hate you then I love you or something. I prefer the original lyric. Usually they have to get permission to change a lyric but in this case it just came out of the blue and who’s going to argue?\n\nJudy Garland became very friendly with Lionel Bart – in fact we had a terrible row. Geoff Love was in my flat and I said ‘get on the other phone and listen to Judy Garland’. She swore at me because I’d asked Lionel Bart to leave the studio on a certain occasion. I thought he was interfering too much with the artists and I lost control.\n\nCeline Dion impresses me a lot. What do I like today (2000-ish)? I can’ really answer that question. I rang EMI the other day and said ‘Can I speak to someone – probably you. They said ‘who’s speaking?’ and I said ‘Norman Newell’ ‘Who?’. Well, of course, they’re teenagers and and they remember the days when getting through to Norman Newell and Wally Ridley wasn’t easy!\n\nWally Stott. I was recording Geraldo at EMI and said ‘who did the orchestration?’ and he said Wally Stott, so I called Wally in after everyone had finished and said ‘what on earth are you doing orchestrating for other people and they get all the credit? You’re the most wonderful orchestrator – why don’t you work under your own name?’ Which he did and became a great accompanist but he never made a great name here. Everyone knew him as a great arranger.\n\nWally Stott, who later transgendered to Angela Morley\n\nDid you have LP’s when you started?\n\nYou’re joking! We had wax and 78’s which were very easy to break – which I often did if I didn’t like what I’d done! When EMI started LP’s every cover was the same – you couldn’t distinguish one record from another. I know at one of the meetings one of us suggested different covers. We were then allowed to choose what we wanted – that was another part of the job.\n\nWhen I look back, I can’t remember any rivalry between the four of us at EMI. We always seemed to be pretty nice to each other all the time. We congratulated each other when we got a hit, and that sort of thing.\n\nI had to phone Ken Townsend (then manager of Abbey Road Studios) recently, needing to know everything I’d recorded over the last 20 years, and he had it for the next day. He’s a lovely man – I bet they miss him. His predecessors in my opinion were stuffy people – they insisted on how you dressed etc. When Ken came in and took over he was marvellous. It’s a question of personality. I couldn’t run a studio. If I tried people would say ‘who the bloody hell is he?!’\n\nI was having lunch with Joyce Grenfell when she was appearing at the Saville Theatre and she was talking about her mother and said ‘she used to sing a song for us and I used to love to join in but I always started to laugh’ so then she sang and she started to laugh. It was so funny I was nearly on the floor. Is said ‘you really must record it. You can’t have your mother on it, you must have someone else.’ I had just seen Norman Wisdom and when he sang Don’t laugh at me I thought ‘right, that’s a hit’ and took him into the studios. So I said would he make a record with Joyce Grenfell. He said ‘yes, I know Joyce Grenfell but I want top billing.’ So I went to Joyce and said ‘I’d love you to do Narcissus with Norman Wisdom but he wants top billing.’ And she said ‘what a silly man! I don’t care if I’m second or third.’ Of course, it’s a scream. They still play it, don’t they?\n\nAnd there the interview must have gently ended as indeed some six years later did Norman. During part of my EMI life, Norman was still used by the A&R man assigned to my division, Vic Lanza. He was always a very gentle, slightly nervy or nervous and unassuming man, though his special relationship with Sir Joseph Lockwood probably raised many a hackle during the 1960’s. Sadly, Norrie Paramor had died long before I commenced these interviews, and Sir George had written his own autobiography. But Wally Ridley, the boldest of the four, granted me an extensive interview which will come when I conjure up the energy!\n\nText ©David Hughes 2019.
