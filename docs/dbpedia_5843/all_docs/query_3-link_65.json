        "text": "In the last decade, the music industry has witnessed an unprecedented rise in the popularity of Latin music, driven largely by Spanish-language singers. Today, Spanish language tunes are hitting new heights of global acclaim, a feat that’s been building over the years.\n\nFrom catchy Latin pop anthems to renowned reggaeton beats, and the timeless allure of classical folk, Spanish music is making a compelling case to rival English in its worldwide popularity.\n\nBut amidst this wave of contemporary hits, how familiar are you with the legends of Latin music? Our curated list isn’t exhaustive – that would be an epic feat – but it’s designed to give you a glimpse into the musical giants of the Spanish-speaking world. These are the icons known in every Spanish-speaking household, the artists who have shaped the very essence of Latin music.\n\nSo, plug in your headphones and prepare to embark on a melodious journey through our selection of the best Spanish singers in the world – a vibrant showcase of cultural heritage and musical genius.\n\nSpain: Flamenco Beats and Latin Pop Giants\n\nIf it is a list of Spanish singers, then naturally we will start with some of the most famous singers from Spain. Of course, Spain is well known for flamenco music based on traditional Andalusian folklore.\n\nFlamenco music could be a whole lesson itself, but today we’re focusing a bit more on Latin Pop and worldwide hits. So here are three of some of the biggest names in the music world from Spain:\n\n• Rosalía\n\nLa Rosalía likely isn’t going anywhere, so check out her music if you want to practice Spanish with some modern musical styles.\n\n• Alejandro Sanz\n\nAlejandro Sanz is a Spanish musician, singer, and composer from Madrid who is one of the biggest names in the music industry. Most of his music includes styles from Latin Pop, but he is most well-known for his Flamenco-inspired ballads. Since his parents are from Andalusia, it makes sense that he would incorporate this style into his music.\n\nThis legendary Spanish singer has won 4 Grammys and 22 Latin Grammy Awards and first made some commercial success in 1991 with his album Viviendo Deprisa. His 1997 album Más is what garnered him international success, though.\n\nThough he does have several different styles of Latin albums, his most famous songs are ballads (Corazón Partío). So if you’re a fan of singing in the shower and are looking for Spanish singers, Alejandro Sanz is a good place to start.\n\n• Enrique Iglesias\n\nAnyone who was listening to music in the early 2000s knows the King of Latin Pop, Enrique Iglesias. He is the son of the most commercially successful European singer of all time, Julio Iglesias. It seems like anyone in this family is destined to be one of the greatest Spanish singers.\n\nHe first became the most successful Spanish language act of the decade in the 90s and then afterward started developing bilingual albums. He is one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time and currently holds the number one slot for the most number 1 hit songs on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs, at 27 hits. Then, in 2020, he was awarded the “Top Latin Artist of All Time” at the Billboard Latin Music Awards.\n\nSo Enrique Iglesias is a pretty good singer.\n\nHis most famous song is the 1998 hit Bailamos. And if you want to check out any of his music, the best part is every one of his English songs has a Spanish version to go along with it. Great news for Spanish learners!\n\nColombia: Cumbia Grooves and Reggaeton Stars\n\nHeading over across the pond, Colombia has a huge music industry. The country is considered to be one of the world’s largest contributors to the industry. So you can bet that you’ll find some of the greatest Spanish singers in Latin America come from this country.\n\nHere are some of the most well-known ones:\n\n• Shakira\n\nHonestly, if you don’t know who Shakira is, then where have you been for the last 2 decades? She has sold over 75 million records worldwide and is the Latina artist who has sold the most albums in history.\n\nShe is from Barranquilla, Colombia, and has made a huge impact in the Latin music industry, recording her first album there at the age of 13. But she became globally famous when she made English and Spanish versions of some hit songs, including Contigo, and Mi Vida (Whenever, Wherever). At the time, she was considered a pioneer of Latin music in the US.\n\nShe’s known as one of the greatest Spanish singers of all time, having become one of the most well-known artists from Latin America. She’s currently the highest-streamed Latin Artist on Spotify, making her the only artist with Spanish songs totaling over 100 million streams.\n\nIf somehow you haven’t heard any of Shakira’s music, then you’ll want to start your playlist with some music from this legendary Spanish singer.\n\n• Maluma\n\nMaluma is another immensely famous singer from Colombia. His music style is described as a mix of reggaeton, Latin trap, and pop. If you ever go dancing (post-pandemic), you’re extremely likely to be hearing some of his music played.\n\nHe’s currently one of the best-selling Latin music artists and collaborates with a ton of other famous artists (like Shakira, for example). One of his singles, Hawái, from his fifth album Papi Juancho, topped the Hot Latin Songs chart for 9 weeks in 2020 and even got a remix done with The Weeknd.\n\nTo be fair, reggaeton isn’t always a popular style with English speakers, but the fact is that it’s not going anywhere – and Maluma is only becoming more and more popular.\n\n• Karol G\n\nJ Balvin, a native of Medellín, has become a global reggaeton sensation. Known for his catchy rhythms and collaborations with international artists, Balvin has played a pivotal role in bringing reggaeton to a worldwide audience. His hits like “Mi Gente” have topped charts globally, making him one of the leading figures in modern Latin music.\n\nThese artists, each with their unique style and contribution, have not only elevated Colombian music on the global stage but have also brought new flavors and perspectives to the ever-evolving world of Latin music. Their impact extends beyond their music, as they continue to inspire new generations of artists and music lovers worldwide.\n\nCuba: Salsa Queens and Afro-Cuban Melodies\n\nCuba‘s contribution to the music world is immense, with its Afro-Cuban rhythms playing a pivotal role in shaping music globally. From salsa to son cubano, Cuban artists have left an indelible mark on the music scene.\n\n• Celia Cruz\n\nKnown as the Queen of Salsa, Celia Cruz is a monumental figure in Cuban music. Her powerful voice and vibrant stage presence made her an icon of the genre. Cruz’s music, infused with the rhythms of her Afro-Cuban heritage, has inspired generations and continues to be celebrated worldwide.\n\n• Gloria Estefan\n\nGloria Estefan is considered one of the main artists who broke down the barriers stopping Latin music from becoming popular internationally. Not only is she one of the top Latina artists of all time, but she’s also one of the highest-selling female singers of all time.\n\nHer hit song from 1985, Conga, is one of her most well-known songs, listed as number 11 on the Greatest Latin Pop Songs list. Though most of her biggest hits are from the 80s, she has continued to make music and star in movies ever since.\n\n• Omara Portuondo\n\nOmara Portuondo, often hailed as the diva of the Buena Vista Social Club, is another jewel of Cuban music. Her soulful voice and deep connection to the traditional “son cubano” (Cuban songs) style have made her a beloved and respected figure in the world of Latin music. Portuondo’s career, spanning decades, showcases the rich musical heritage of Cuba and her unique ability to bring it to life\n\nMexico: Mariachi Roots and Modern Latin Chart-Toppers\n\nMexico is another big name in the music industry, especially in recent years, with Mexico City being a hotspot for top music hits.\n\n• Thalía\n\nThalía is one of the most famous artists to come out of Mexico. She is a singer, businesswoman, and actress. In fact, in many ways her acting career is just as highly regarded as her music, often being referred to as the Queen of Telenovelas.\n\nShe is another one of the best-selling Latina artists of all time and is the highest-paid telenovela actress in history.

His contributions to Latin music are vast, touching on various genres and resonating deeply with fans across generations.\n\n• Luis Miguel\n\nKnown as “El Sol de México,” Luis Miguel’s smooth vocals and charismatic performances have made him a superstar. His ability to blend traditional Mexican music with contemporary styles has earned him immense popularity and numerous accolades.\n\n• Special Mention: Eslabon Armado and Peso Pluma\n\nCurrently riding the wave of popularity, Eslabon Armado and Peso Pluma have captured the hearts of modern audiences. Their recent hit “Ella Baila Sola” has skyrocketed, amassing almost 500 million views on YouTube, and showcasing the evolving landscape of Mexican music.\n\nArgentina: Tango Traditions and Pop Innovators\n\nArgentina’s music scene is as dynamic and diverse as its culture, producing some of the most influential artists in Latin music. From traditional tango rhythms to contemporary pop, Argentine musicians have made significant contributions to the global music stage.\n\n• Mercedes Sosa\n\nMercedes Sosa might no longer be a household name, but she was one of the most influential singers of the 20th century. Her music was popular throughout Latin America and Spain and was heavily influenced by Argentine folk music.\n\nSosa was a huge social activist and all of her music contained themes of social justice, to the point where she became known as the “voice of the voiceless”, speaking up for Latin artists. She is known to be one of the biggest proponents of using music as a means of social activism.\n\nShe Has won six Latin Grammys and has performed in prestigious venues all over the world.

Born to a Puerto Rican father and a Dominican mother, Nicky Jam has become a pivotal figure in the Latin music scene, especially in the reggaeton genre. Blending the rhythmic essence of his heritage with the urban vibes of the States, he has carved out a unique niche for himself.\n\nNicky Jam’s journey in music is a testament to his resilience and talent. He rose to fame with hits that resonate with a wide audience, thanks to his ability to intertwine Spanish and English in his music seamlessly. His songs often reflect his multicultural background, offering a blend of catchy reggaeton beats with the contemporary flair of American music\n\nPuerto Rico: Reggaeton Rhythms and Latin Pop Pioneers\n\nBeing such a small island, Puerto Rico has made a huge impact on the music industry.

He is the rapper and singer-songwriter from Puerto Rico who coined the term reggaeton. So you have Daddy Yankee to thank for the huge explosion of this genre.\n\nHis first big international hit was “Gasolina” from 2004, which is the song that most people consider to have introduced reggaeton to the international community. Ever since then, reggaeton has become insanely popular globally.\n\nIn 2017, he collaborated with Luis Fonsi and recorded Despacito (You know this one), which quickly became the most-watched video on YouTube and Daddy Yankee became the most listened-to artist on Spotify that year, too.\n\nSo regardless of whether reggaeton is a style of music you like, you can’t deny its international success – and a big part of it is because of Daddy Yankee.\n\nEmbarking on a Melodic Spanish Adventure\n\nAnd there you have it – a vibrant tour through the world of Spanish and Latin music, showcasing some of the most influential artists from across the Spanish-speaking world.
