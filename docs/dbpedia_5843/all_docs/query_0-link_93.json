        "text": "This takes me back. We used to have this Music For Pleasure LP in our house when I was growing up. I’m not sure what happened to it. All of the remaining records in the house were absorbed into my collection in the late 1990s, and this one didn’t survive that long. I’ve always had my eye out for it ever since. A quick dig in the sale bins last Saturday – the September Drop of Record Store Day 2020 – proved successful.\n\nGeoff Love probably doesn’t get the love he deserves. I have a few of his records, and they’re always worth a listen. Growing up, I always assumed Love was a white guy – but it’s not surprising to find out he’s black. He definitely injects a heap of disco funk into some of these sometimes staid themes. His version of the Theme From Star Trek is dangerously groovy; to boldy go where no man has jived before. Hearing this at such an impressionable age might explain my love of funk ever since.\n\nThis collection, as the title suggests, is a run through of all the main science-fiction film themes from the ‘60s and ‘70s. The one thing I love about this record is its wonderful artwork – influenced by the poster of the prior year’s Star Wars – but featuring the Tardis from Dr. Who alongside Star Trek’s Starship Enterprise and 2001’s circular space station. Less accurate is the depiction of Luke Skywalker, pictured here as a middle-aged man; more divorced farm-owner than adopted farm-boy.\n\nHit: Main Title From Star Wars\n\nHidden Gem: U.F.O."
