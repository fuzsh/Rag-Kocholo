        "text": "When Everything Everything, Django Django and Years & Years took to their respective stages at Glastonbury they were upholding a long tradition of bands which sound repetitive, even though their music doesn’t.\n\nThe trend of double names peaked in the 80s but has been going strong since music became popular. From punk to indie, boy-band to electro-pop, some bands just can't help naming themselves twice. So, if you're thinking of a creative name for your band, take inspiration from our tribute to ten music acts, in no particular order, which gave themselves a naming encore.\n\nBorn out of the New Romantic scene in Birmingham in the early 80s, Duran squared is perhaps the most successful of the doubler-uppers, helped in part by becoming the poster boys who followed in The Beatles footsteps and conquered America. Named after the villain in Jane Fonda’s arthouse sci-fi film Barbarella, interestingly, they could have disqualified themselves from this prestigious list as the Wild Boys subtly changed their name during an experimental period in the 90s. Album artwork which accompanied Big Thing saw them drop from a five piece to a trio and rename to Duranduran - no space and technically one word. But double vision sanity returned with their next studio release; and they remain familiarly doubled to this day with a new album, Paper Gods, out this year.\n\nThe ultimate repetition. Once you’ve named yourself after, well, everything is there anything left but to underline the point by repeating it? The indie-pop band started out with the express intention of making futuristic pop music in an age of data saturation, using contemporary RnB techniques. Having reached the longlist for the BBC’s Sound of 2010, their first album Man Alive went on to be nominated for the Mercury Prize. For BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge they covered Rhianna's What's My Name? Well, it's everything.\n\nEverything Everything at Glastonbury\n\nEverything Everything at Glastonbury 2015\n\nWhy stop at a mild downpour when you could have a soaking? Another set of 80s survivors who’re back on tour this year, the Scottish band fronted by Marti Pellow formed in 1982 after taking their name from a line in a Scritti Politti song. The band’s first single Wishing I Was Lucky was released in 1987 starting a phenomenal run of 27 Top 40 hits, including the Troggs cover Love is All Around which stayed at the top spot for 15 weeks. That's 12 more than the number of Wets in their name.\n\nWet Wet Wet perform at BBC at the Quay in 2014\n\nWet Wet Wet perform at BBC at The Quay in Glasgow in 2014.\n\nA rogue '&' is not going to stop us from including the band which is quite possibly the coolest pop trio around. They've become a staple of UK festivals recently, becoming crowd-pleasers with their mix of soulful synth music. They also topped the BBC Music Sound Of 2015 list, which highlights the best new artists for the year ahead. With that pedigree, they should be around for years and years.\n\nYears & Years wow the John Peel stage at Glastonbury 2015\n\nYears & Years at Glastonbury 2015\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs are rooted in American indie rock and with four albums to their three names have been nominated for multiple Grammy and MTV awards. At the end of last year, lead singer Karen O told NME the band was on a 'bit of hiatus' but did not rule out new material 'when the urge takes us'."
