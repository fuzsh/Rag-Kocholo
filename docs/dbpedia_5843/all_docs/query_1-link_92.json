        "text": "It’s hard to not be jealous of Geoff Rickly, frontman of the band Thursday. When a person is brilliant at two different artforms, it feels unfair. And yet, you can’t hate him: gentle and soft-spoken, Rickly was categorically kind when I meet him for the first time at Olas, a coffee shop in Greenpoint. We were there to discuss the release of his lyrical, psychedelic debut Someone Who Isn’t Me (Rose Books). It’s the first title published by Rose Books, an independent press founded by author Chelsea Hodson. Someone Who Isn’t Me is semi-autobiographical, inspired by Rickly’s life, but also, it wouldn’t be quite accurate to say Rickly himself is the protagonist.\n\nYes—the narrator is literally named Geoff, who lives in Brooklyn, and is the lead singer of Thursday. But really, the narrative is a fictional account of Rickly’s recovery from heroin addiction, which he reaches with the help of an experimental treatment called ibogaine. The trip-inducing drug acts as a portal for Geoff and the story unfolds “for three days and three nights, a burning in the fabric of the world,” as Rickly takes the reader on a Dante-esque adventure toward spiritual self-realization. Atmospheric and emotional in essence but grounded in an air-tight story structure, Someone Who Isn’t Me is my favorite book of the year.\n\n—Madeline Howard\n\nMadeline Howard You started writing Someone Who Isn’t Me right after you got sober. Did you know the work would become a book from the beginning?\n\nGeoff Rickly I knew that the project needed to be book-length to keep me engaged and in my seat, which was my original goal with writing. I had a therapist who made me buy a Playstation who was like, Just don’t get up. Play Playstation all day. After two days of shooting zombies, I realized it wasn’t going to engage me. I decided I needed a project that would take me a long time. It took me five years, five hours a day, for five days a week.\n\nMH The prose in this book is the perfect mix of lyrical and beautiful, yet approachable. How did you strike this balance while writing?\n\nGR The critique that I’ve received about the book, so far, is that this kind of lyricism is very out of fashion. Restrained prose, like that of Rachel Cusk, who I love, is more popular right now. That’s not to say I don’t love restrained prose. I try to meet art on its own terms, though. I don’t approach it with the mindset of, What do I want from it? But rather, What is the artist doing?\n\nI was very aware that the voice I was using is out, and I tried a draft where I took it out. But then I was like, How am I going to write the character Geoff from Thursday, who is known for lyrical writing, and not have him thinking in those terms?\n\nI also didn’t want to swallow the book whole in my lyrics. So I figured out that when Geoff gets high, he’s lyrical. When he’s in withdrawal, the world empties of its color and the prose becomes more restrained.\n\nMH This book is about the character Geoff from the band Thursday who takes the drug ibogaine—but it’s not a memoir, even if all of those things are a part of your life’s story. What makes this book fiction to you?\n\nGR It’s a strange thing when people ask me, “What makes it a novel?” I like the idea of treating real facts as if everything might be fictional. I remember in college reading White Noise by Don DeLillo. There’s a fictional drug in the book, which I thought was fascinating. I’ve read several other accounts of fictional drugs. So I decided to treat ibogaine as if it was fictional, because it sounds fictional and fishy. But I think at a certain point, when you’re lost in addiction, you are treating your life as fiction because the stakes are so absurd. Every day is life or death, so maybe it’s better to think of it as not being real. It occurred to me as some kind of double negative. If you’re lying to yourself day in and day out until your life becomes a fiction, and if you write a fictional novel about it, will it come out the other side as true?\n\nMH Tell me about the part of the book when you see your “true self,” during the ibogaine trip, and you think you’re literally Hitler, or rather, the ibogaine is making you associate yourself with familiar cultural tent poles and what they represent.\n\nGR The most fictional part of the book are the hallucinations, because in real life they were not so clear. They were more chaotic. My first draft of the book had them more true to how they really were, but then it was like, Who would want to read this? This is a nightmare. If there was one thing I should use fiction for, it’s to make this an enjoyable story for somebody who wants to read it. The showing my true self and becoming Hitlet part, though, is unfortunately real. It took me a really long time to unpack that with my therapist afterwards. She basically just said, “You hate yourself. That’s just how your brain works.” And when I was trying to explain the therapy session to my friend, he was like, Wait, you’re telling me that the lead singer of Thursday hates himself? Spoiler alert. You’re the last person to find out.\n\nMH In the book, you see that Geoff the character hates himself, but also that he eventually finds out that, deep down, he’s really just a lonely child, which helps him (and the reader, in my opinion) to heal.\n\nGR The whole middle section of the book is a non-traditional memoir in three parts made up of three hallucinations. The first one is more memoir, the second one is like my version of Italo Calvino’s Invisible City, and the third is the confrontation with the real. I was trying to figure out how to structure that middle section, because you know how they say, Don’t tell anybody your dreams? It’s basically like a dream sequence, and I was worried that it was such a bad idea.\n\nTo envision the structure, I thought of images that are nested circles that work inward, like a record shape, a chandelier, tree rings, or labyrinths. I had to find a way to make it so the climax of the book was the center of the circle. I had to make Geoff find his way there and find something there, like a final boss. What I kept coming to was this notion in Zen Buddhism that the center is empty, there’s nothing in it, so you enter the vessel and you break the vessel. So I thought, What’s at the center of a maze? What’s at the center of a record? There’s a hole there.\n\nI realized that I could have this hole at the center and a smaller childhood version of myself would be there, like a nested doll. It ended up being an emotional scene, but I also realized that the best end would be to go to the beginning, to the source.\n\nMH The book is so tightly paced. It had the perfect balance of describing what life was like before the ibogaine clinic, what sent Geoff there, the ibogaine trip, and life after enlightenment. How did you learn to balance that narrative?\n\nGR When I brought this to a 92nd Street Y workshop, the book started with the very beginning of the trip. I just jumped right in and I basically said, Welcome to the chaos. I was going to explain what I had done through flashbacks. But it was such a mess. My instructor Wendy Salinger was like, You should give the reader more and let them know where you’re at, even if it’s short. You need to give the rules of the book before you start breaking the rules of the book. So I wrote a paragraph, which became a page, which became a whole section of the book.\n\nMH You write about the first time you tried heroin like this: “I want to experience some shit like the birth of the universe.” What was it like diving into this headspace, going back to experiences of being high?\n\nGR It’s strange because it wasn’t that hard. I can still relate to why I wanted and needed to do those things, and I have compassion for myself. I’ve always been good about forgiving and loving other people. When it comes to myself, I’m not so great. Through reading and writing this book and being forced to look at a lot of my actions, many of which were not great, I was able to have compassion for why I did them. While I do love this world, it can also cause great pain. It’s like you’re looking for a way to be in this world you love so much without hurting all the time.\n\nMH Tell me about your writing process. I read that you put perfume on your wrists and have a long playlist with no lyrics. Are these ceremonial habits for you?\n\nGR I wake up with the sun and I go. I also have a very ritualistic coffee from my espresso machine. Then I sit down and I will be in that seat for four or five hours. I just have to show up. It doesn’t matter how much gets done. It doesn’t matter if I throw out every page that I wrote that morning. After time’s up, I have a little food and then take a walk with my partner. Most of the time, after five hours, I find a lot of problems in the writing that I don’t know how to solve. And then when I walk around, I’ll gain clarity and I’m like, That’s it. I figured it out."
