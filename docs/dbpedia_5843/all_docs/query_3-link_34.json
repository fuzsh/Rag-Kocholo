        "text": "If you dream of a career in music and you've got the passion and dedication to back it up the UK music industry provides a wealth of opportunities Learn more about the music jobs on offer and how to secure them\n\nA report by UK Music, the UK music industry body, demonstrates how vital the industry is to the creative sector and the UK economy as a whole.\n\nThe findings from This Is Music 2023 showed that the music industry's contribution to the economy in 2022 was £6.7billion, while music exports generated £4billion.\n\nEmployment in the UK music industry stood at 210,000 in 2022.\n\nMusic jobs\n\nIn terms of career options, singers and musicians may be the most visible jobs in music, but you could carve out a career in a number of areas including:\n\nperforming\n\nsongwriting\n\ncomposing\n\nlive music entertainment\n\nmusic education\n\nmusic production\n\nartist management\n\nmarketing and PR\n\nmusic journalism.\n\nWhile careers in the music industry are undoubtedly competitive, they're by no means out of reach for those with the right qualifications and experience.\n\nHere are some of the music jobs you can do:\n\nA&R (artists and repertoire) manager - as a form of talent agent, you'll be responsible for finding fresh talent, signing them up to record labels and overseeing the completion of recordings. You'll help new artists develop and grow and to do this you'll need a solid understanding of the music scene and strong business skills.\n\nConcert promoter - you'll need a love of live music and excellent communication skills. It's your job to spread the word about live music events and ensure this results in strong ticket sales. You'll liaise with agents/artist managers, recording artists and club/concert venues to book shows, publicise events and set up advertising campaigns.\n\nMusic magazine journalist - exceptional writing skills and an interest in all things music are a must. You'll report on music industry news, interview artists and musicians, and review albums and concerts - either for a specialist print or online publication or the music section of a general news outlet.\n\nMusic producer - producers write, arrange, produce and record songs for artists or for their own personal projects. The hours can be long, and you'll spend the majority of your time in a studio setting. You'll collaborate with recording artists, recording/sound engineers, session musicians and singers, as well as A&R managers and record company executives.\n\nYou could also become a:\n\nbackground singer\n\nblogger\n\nbooking agent\n\ncomposer\n\nDJ\n\nevent manager\n\ninstrument technician\n\nlive sound technician\n\nmusic PR\n\nmusic therapist\n\nmusical director\n\nmusician\n\nprivate music teacher\n\nradio producer\n\nsinger\n\nsongwriter\n\nsound engineer\n\ntour manager.\n\nPortfolio careers are common in the music business. This means having several streams of income at the same time, often combining jobs with freelance work.\n\nFor example, session musicians could also make money as private music teachers, and with the right knowledge and experience, DJs and recording engineers can move into music production. Concert promoters can move into marketing and PR roles.\n\nRead more about putting together a creative portfolio.\n\nYou'll also find that social media has opened up a route that wasn't available a decade ago. Singers and musicians are now being signed after being spotted on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok. And music journalists are securing jobs off the back of blogging and vlogging.\n\nDespite this, you still require the relevant qualifications and work experience, whether that's achieved through a music degree, apprenticeship or internship.\n\nMusic degrees\n\nWith outstanding talent as a singer, songwriter, dancer or musician you may be able to enter the music industry directly - whereas if you're interested in business, educational or technical music-related jobs you'll likely need a degree.\n\nNo matter your end goal, studying for a music degree can be beneficial. Courses give you in-depth practical and theoretical knowledge and the chance to develop transferable skills, make industry contacts and find industry work placements. These opportunities to network and gain experience are invaluable in a competitive field like music.\n\nA degree in music is usually referred to as a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or a Bachelor of Music (BMus), and there's no clear distinction between the two. Check the details of individual courses to ensure they match what you're looking for. Some universities run performance-focused degrees, while others are more academic.\n\nAs well as more general music degrees, at undergraduate level you can also study more specific subjects such as:\n\ncomposition\n\ndigital music\n\nlive events production\n\nmedia and communication (music industries)\n\nmusic business\n\nmusic journalism\n\nmusic management\n\nmusic production\n\nmusic technology\n\nmusical theatre\n\npopular music performance\n\nsongwriting\n\nsound engineering\n\nsound technology\n\nstage management.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing where to study, it's useful to check subject-specific rankings and league tables.\n\nYou'll find that the best performers are a mix of traditional universities and specialist institutions, also known as conservatoires, such as the Royal College of Music (RCM) and Guildhall School of Music and Drama. These provide different study environments and deciding which you prefer is another important thing to think about as you do your research.\n\nYou'll usually need good passes at GCSE and a set number of UCAS points. Many courses ask for an A-level in music, or alternatively Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM) Grade 5 in Music Theory and Grade 8 in Performance. Depending on the course, you may also need to demonstrate performance skills. Entry requirements vary so check with your selected university or conservatoire.\n\nDiscover what you can do with a music degree.\n\nMasters in Music\n\nWhile not an essential requirement, a music Masters allows those who studied the subject at undergraduate level to explore an area of music in more depth. The majority of courses also have connections to the professional world, giving you the opportunity to expand your industry contacts.\n\nThere are a variety of postgraduate options to consider, with taught and research-based options available from the following institutions:\n\nGoldsmiths, University of London\n\nKingston University London\n\nRCM London\n\nRoyal Northern College of Music (RNCM)\n\nThe University of Manchester.\n\nAs well as the Masters in Music, you can also choose to specialise in a particular area, including:\n\ncomposition\n\ncomposition of music for film and television\n\ncommunity music\n\nelectronic and computer music\n\nhistory of art and history of music\n\nmusic education\n\nmusic for the moving image\n\nmusic production\n\nmusic psychology\n\nmusic and sonic media\n\nmusical theatre\n\nperformance.\n\nFor instance, the University of Bristol offers the one-year, full-time MA Composition of Music for Film and Television. For entry onto the course, which costs £13,200 (UK students) or £28,400 (international students) in 2024/25, you'll typically require a 2:1 degree in music, plus some experience as a composer, as demonstrated through a portfolio.\n\nLearn more about Masters degrees and search for postgraduate courses in music.\n\nMusic industry internships\n\nTo stand out from the crowd and demonstrate your passion and dedication to employers, work experience and internships are essential.\n\nWherever possible, try to gain relevant experience - for example:\n\nin a recording studio for aspiring music producers or recording engineers\n\nor at a record label if you're aiming to get into A&R, artist management or marketing and PR\n\nif you've set your sights on a career as a music journalist, look for internship opportunities at music magazines, blogs and websites\n\nget in touch with your local radio station if you'd like to become a radio producer or DJ.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that any music-related experience will be useful. So look into volunteering at music festivals, get a part-time job in a record shop or start your own music blog reviewing local gigs. Do your research to find out if there are any music-related events happening in your community at which you could lend a hand.\n\nA number of organisations provide music internships but beware of unpaid opportunities. Internships should pay at least the National Minimum Wage (NMW) - see GOV.UK - NMW rates.\n\nMajor music companies such as Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group all offer industry placements or internships in a variety of functions such as administration, marketing, promotions, digital, communication and artist relations and commercial sales.\n\nMusic internships are also available at:\n\nYellow Shark Recording Studios\n\nStudio Moross\n\nLarp Music\n\nAny volunteering experience can be incredibly beneficial. If you'd like to get into teaching, volunteer at a school or youth club and teach young people how to play an instrument. If you dream of becoming a DJ, create your own set and volunteer at local club nights.\n\nInternships and voluntary work are an excellent way to develop your knowledge and skills, learn about the industry and make useful contacts. Including it on your CV shows employers that you're passionate, committed and able to use your initiative.\n\nMusic apprenticeships\n\nThe apprenticeship route is a great alternative to university study. Working towards an apprenticeship enables you to gain industry qualifications while actually doing the job and earning a wage.\n\nTo find out more about what they involve, see what is an apprenticeship?\n\nMusic apprenticeships are becoming more widespread, but you'll still need to do your research to uncover opportunities. Record companies, talent agencies and PR agencies all offer apprenticeship schemes in the music business. You can work in international promotions, communications, music publishing, marketing and business administration. You can also work as a music assistant or digital media apprentice.\n\nThe BRITs Apprentice Scheme, created by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and run by recruitment specialists DiVA, gives ten people from all backgrounds across the UK the unique opportunity to work at a top independent record label or music company.\n\nApprentices receive specialist training in either administration, A&R, business affairs, digital media, licencing or marketing. The scheme is open to those aged 18 or over and lasts for 15 months.\n\nTo search for music apprenticeships, see:\n\nDiVA Apprenticeships\n\nGOV.UK - Find an apprenticeship\n\nMusic Industries Association (MIA)\n\nMUSIC4GOOD\n\nYou can also read about how to apply for an apprenticeship.\n\nFind out more\n\nDiscover the 7 skills you need to succeed in performing arts.\n\nConsider other creative jobs."
