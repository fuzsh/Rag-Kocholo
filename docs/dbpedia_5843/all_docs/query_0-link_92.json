        "text": "Following a four-year national search, the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra (ASO) has appointed Geoffrey Robson as music director to lead the performing arts organization into its 58th season.\n\nRobson has been serving as the symphony’s artistic director.\n\n“Geoff has become a remarkable conductor and leader. From his concerts with Midori, Gil Shaham and most recently Zuill Bailey, Geoff has proven himself as the artist, musician and leader this orchestra wants to follow into its future success,” said ASO CEO Christina Littlejohn. “His deep love of music and people set him apart. Whether conducting symphonic repertoire or playing bluegrass, folk or Florence Price, he brings joy and a sense of wonder to every performance.”\n\nThe search for the ASO’s next music director began in earnest following a year-long delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, Robson played an instrumental role as artistic director designing innovative programs that allowed the symphony to continue to move forward and adapt as it transitioned from public to online, live streaming performances that reached over one million music fans around the world at a critical time.\n\n“It is the honor of a lifetime to be chosen to chart the path forward as the next music director of the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra, made extraordinary as I was chosen by a group of musicians, most of whom I have known for years. During these years, the passion for the music shown by the players, the presence of brilliant creative partners in the orchestra and around the community, and a common desire to grow as artists has kept me rooted here, inspired to have the greatest positive impact that I can,” said Robson. “The ASO is a marvelous organization made possible by this Arkansas community. Every single person I work with has a steadfast dedication to making beautiful music available to all. Thus, the ASO is inseparable from the community it serves. This gives us our purpose, relevance, and visibility.”\n\nRobson’s work with ASO has included conducting critically acclaimed and sold-out masterworks, pops, chamber and educational concerts throughout Arkansas. In addition, he frequently performs as a guest conductor with symphonies around the nation and was awarded the Respighi Prize in Conducting by the Chamber Orchestra of New York in 2017.\n\n“The symphony’s next music director will play a key role in the organization’s future success and Mr. Robson’s artistry, discipline, curiosity, humor and infectious enthusiasm made him the leader we want to lead ASO into this next chapter,” said Jan Hundley, chair of the ASO Board of Directors. “While many of us have had the opportunity to watch him develop as a musician, conductor and leader over the years, he clearly stood out in this nationwide search and from an incredible field of candidates for the professionalism, creativity, vision and passion he brings to this work.”\n\nRobson studied orchestral conducting at the Mannes College of Music in New York City under the tutelage of David Hayes and holds violin performance degrees from Yale University and the Michigan State University Honors College. He studied conducting at Yale University with Lawrence Leighton Smith, Edward Cumming and Shinik Hahm. Other notable teachers include Leon Gregorian, John Farrer, Neil Thomson and Larry Rachleff.\n\nRobson’s appointment as music director comes as the ASO prepares to break ground on the ASO Stella Boyle Smith Music Center planned for development in the heart of Little Rock’s East Village. The new state of the art, 18,500 square foot music center will greatly expand ASO’s capacity to serve Arkansas children and adults through music making opportunities, concert programs and extensive music education offerings."
