        "text": "Today, the LGBTQ+ community can look to several gay musicians for inspiration, but that wasn’t always the case. Several pioneering openly gay singers paved the way from a time when sexual orientation wasn’t a topic for public discussion.\n\nIndeed, these famous gay musicians faced tremendous backlash and damage to their careers because of their honesty and openness.\n\nAs we explore queer performance art, we pay homage to those who came before us. In this piece, we’ll list some of the most influential names in the queer art movement and their impact on our past and present.\n\nBeing an Openly Gay Musician\n\nUndoubtedly, the entertainment industry has come a long way in accepting and representing LGBTQ+ individuals. However, it wasn't always this way, especially for musicians.\n\nComing out as a gay musician in the 20th century was no small feat. It required immense courage and determination, especially when the music industry was predominantly hetero-normative.\n\nSexuality was not only a taboo topic for public discussion but could also result in alienation from fans and even cause damage to one's career. As such, many gay musicians chose to keep their sexual orientation hidden for fear of retribution.\n\nTake Bruce Wayne Campbell (known by his stage name Jobriath), for example. He was not only one of the first openly gay rock musicians to get signed to a big record label, but tragically, he was also one of the first internationally famous musicians to die of AIDS. Despite tremendous talent, he also came up against severe backlash for his sexuality.\n\nMusic Activism as a Tool for Change in the LGBTQ+ Community\n\nIn the face of such challenges, many gay musicians turned to music activism to advocate for their rights and create change. Over the decades, gay musicians have utilized music's power to connect people and spread important messages, and the LGBTQ+ community and gay history are no exception.\n\nThrough their songs and performances, these courageous individuals were able to shed light on important issues and promote love, tolerance, and acceptance. They used their platforms to speak out against discrimination and fight for equal rights for all.\n\nNow, let's turn our attention back to musicians like Jobriath, who are or were openly gay in the music industry. Their bravery and willingness to be themselves have helped pave the way for future generations of LGBTQ+ artists. They serve as a reminder that it is possible to thrive as a musician while being true to oneself.\n\n19 Famous Gay Musicians\n\nNow, here’s a look at 19 of the other most influential gay musicians throughout the decades.\n\n1. Benjamin Britten\n\nBenjamin Britten is one of the greatest composers of the 20th century. He was also open about his homosexuality in a time and place where being gay was heavily stigmatized and illegal. In 1953, Britten was among the signers of a letter to a newspaper called The Observer, which demanded decriminalizing homosexuality, which was then punishable by imprisonment in the UK.\n\nMany of Britten’s songs were dedicated to his lover and muse, Peter Pears. Some of Britten's works, such as his opera Peter Grimes, dealt with themes of persecution and social exclusion, making him an early advocate for LGBTQ+ visibility.\n\n2. Akihiro Miwa\n\nJapanese cabaret performer, singer, actor, drag queen, and social activist Akihiro Miwa began his career as a cabaret performer in the 1950s, quickly gaining notice for his androgynous appearance. Miwa's performances often included a mix of Japanese and English, along with extravagant costumes and makeup.\n\nAs an openly gay performer in a largely conservative society, Miwa's activism has promoted greater acceptance and understanding of LGBTQ+ people in Japan. He has been a vocal proponent of same-sex marriage and has spoken out against discrimination and harassment.\n\n3. Little Richard\n\nRichard Wayne Penniman was born in 1932 and began singing in church at an early age. In the early 1950s, he began performing in clubs and bars, developing the stage persona Little Richard.\n\nToday, many artists and historians recognize Little Richard as a very influential figure in the rock and roll space. As one writer put it, such recognition eluded him in his heyday because he was “too black, too queer, too holy” for mainstream acceptance in the 1950s.\n\nDespite his rock and roll success with hits like “Tutti Frutti” and “Lucille,” Little Richard remained connected to the church throughout his career, even becoming a minister in 1957. He later returned to secular music but continued to draw on his religious beliefs in his music. Little Richard passed away on May 9, 2020, at the age of 87.\n\n4. Sir Elton John\n\nSinger, songwriter, and pianist Sir Elton John is one of the most successful and influential musicians ever, with over 300 million records sold worldwide. Born Reginald Kenneth Dwight in 1947, John began playing the piano at a young age.\n\nIn the 1960s, John established himself in London bars and clubs, eventually earning a record deal in 1969. His 1970 self-titled album started a long run of commercial hits, including “Your Song,” “Rock Man,” “Tiny Dancer,” “Crocodile Rock,” and “I’m Still Standing.”\n\nSince the 1980s, John has become equally well-known for his philanthropic efforts, including his work with the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Now, he is widely considered one of the most successful and influential gay musicians of all time, winning five Grammy Awards to date and an Academy Award for his work on the soundtrack for the film The Lion King.\n\n5. Freddie Mercury\n\nAs Queen shot to fame in the 1970s on the strength of hits like “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “We Will Rock You,” and “We Are The Champions,” the focus was on their flamboyant lead singer, Freddie Mercury. His powerful vocals and eclectic stage style combined elements of rock, pop, opera, and even more esoteric styles.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS, a highly stigmatized and misunderstood disease. His death at age 45 in November 1991 shocked millions of fans. But it also led to a greater understanding of the effects of the disease, bringing visibility to the issue outside of the gay community. Today, Mercury is seen as a pioneering figure for LGBTQ+ visibility.\n\n6. George Michael\n\nEnglish singer, songwriter, and producer George Michael rose to fame as a member of the pop duo Wham! With hits such as \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\" \"Careless Whisper,\" and \"Last Christmas.\" In 1987, he began a solo career with the album Faith, which spawned even more worldwide hits like the title track, “Father Figure,” and “One More Try.”\n\nIn the 1990s, Michael became involved in HIV/AIDS activism after his partner, Anselmo Feleppa, died from AIDS-related complications. He worked tirelessly to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS, often donating the proceeds from his concerts to charities supporting people with the disease. In 1992, he performed a version of \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" with Elton John at a benefit concert for the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.\n\nMichael, one of the most popular gay musicians of his time, passed away on December 25, 2016, but his music and LGBTQ+ activism continue to inspire fans.\n\n7. Rob Halford\n\nRob Halford is best known as the lead vocalist of the British heavy metal band Judas Priest. Halford came out as gay in a 1998 interview with MTV News, making him one of the first well-known heavy metal musicians to identify as queer openly. He initially feared that revealing his sexual orientation would alienate Judas Priest’s fanbase, known for its masculine and macho image.\n\nHowever, Halford’s fears proved unfounded—he was widely praised for his courage and honesty. He continued to perform with Judas Priest, and the band’s popularity grew. His coming out is now seen as a pivotal moment toward greater acceptance and LBGTQ+ visibility in the metal community.\n\n8. Big Freedia\n\nBig Freedia is the “Queen of Bounce,” a style of music that originated in New Orleans and is characterized by uptempo beats. Their influence on music, specifically in the hip-hop and R&B space, was solidified with their collaborations with artists like Beyonce (on “Formation”) and Drake (several songs, including the chart-topper “Nice For What”).\n\nBig Freedia’s music has long celebrated Black, queer, and transgender culture. Their platform extended to TV after appearing in the reality TV show Big Freedia: Queen of Bounce on the Fuse network.\n\n9. Lil Nas X\n\nLil Nas X shot to fame in 2019 when his country-rap song “Old Town Road” topped numerous charts across genre lines. Shortly afterward, he came out as gay in “c7osure.” He then endeared himself to fans by openly and honestly discussing his difficulty in accepting his own sexual orientation.\n\nIn an interview with Gayle King, Lil Nas X detailed his long journey to self-love and acceptance. He has since been open about his struggles with anxiety and depression, making him an inspiring figure to many young people seeking approval.\n\nNow, Lil Nas X is known for his willingness to embrace his true self, even in the face of intense media criticism, making him a symbol of hope and empowerment for the LGBTQ+ community—or fans of any sexual orientation.\n\n10. Ricky Martin\n\nKnown worldwide as the \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" singer, Ricky Martin came out as gay in 2010. He admitted to staying quiet for years due to fear of damaging his career but ultimately decided living authentically was more critical.\n\nSince coming out, Martin has actively supported LGBTQ+ rights and even established his own foundation, The Ricky Martin Foundation, to advocate for children's well-being and human rights.\n\n11. Sam Smith\n\nSam Smith rose to fame with their soulful voice and hit songs like \"Stay With Me\" and \"Writing's On The Wall.\" In 2014, they came out as gay, and in 2019, as non-binary and genderqueer, using the pronouns they/them.\n\nSince then, Smith has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and has used their platform to raise awareness about the community's issues. They have also been open about their struggles with body image and mental health, using their music to spread messages of self-love and acceptance.\n\n12. Troye Sivan\n\nTroye Sivan is an Australian singer, actor, and YouTuber who came out as gay to his fans in a heartfelt YouTube video in 2013.
