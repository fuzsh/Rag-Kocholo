        "text": "Exhibit / March 1, 2017\n\nObject Name: “Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Other Disco Galactic Themes” by the Geoff Love Orchestra\n\nMaker and Year: Geoff Love/Music for Pleasure, 1978\n\nObject Type: Album LP\n\nDescription: (Richard McKenna)\n\nAs the 1970s drew to a close, the appetite for science fiction-related material of any type and in any form (though preferably of low price) was such that its effects were visible in every field: the post-Star Wars windfall admitted all comers. The collision of sci-fi with another then-dominant expression of contemporary pop culture, disco music, brought about the musical genre now known as space disco. After seeing Star Wars on the day of its release in 1977, trombonist and record producer Meco (Domenico Monardo) had been struck by the idea of producing a disco version of the film’s soundtrack. Several weeks later, he and his band (also called Meco) released their version of the Star Wars theme, which rapidly climbed to number one in the U.S. pop charts and went on to become a bestseller around the world. Personnel on the record included synthesizer wizard Suzanne Ciani, who provided sound effects, and Tony Bongiovi, who had provided production work for such seminal records as Gloria Gaynor’s Never Can Say Goodbye (1975), The Ramones’ Leave Home (1977) and Rocket to Russia (1977), and Talking Heads: 77 (1977). Meco’s first two LPs, Music Inspired by Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk and Encounters of Every Kind, were also released in ’77, followed by a string of similarly-themed records including Superman and Other Galactic Heroes (1978), Moondancer (1979), and Across the Galaxy (1980)."
