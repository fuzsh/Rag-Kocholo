If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have learned at such a young age to love classical music, along with the principles and idea of creating sound.\n\nThen I was introduced to the man that would show me everything that I know -- Mr. Harold Blanchard. Many years later after many lessons with the world-renowned musician, I was able to see the ideas being played out literally in front of me. I have continuously been inspired ever since -- by Mr. Blanchard (who I STILL studied with until his recent death), and actually quite a wide variety of musicians that I've heard through the years.\n\nHowever, it was my mom that helped me understand discipline and how important music can be for a young mind, and I can't thank her enough for keeping me focused. Although I owe my musical career to Mom, Dad never lets me forget that he was the one that paid for all my lessons.\n\nWhat was the most unusual or memorable gig you've ever played?\n\nThat's a tough one. There are tons of memorable, unforgettable and sometimes regrettable moments, but to pick one ... .\n\nOne of my long-time running groups, The S.E.A.D., got a call in mid-November to play a \"Reggae Beach Party.\" These were our exact instructions: to keep the party going with fun, danceable music. I was a little confused on this slightly cold, overcast and rainy November day at 11 a.m., and then after showing up and meeting the host, we learned that this was actually a wake for her mother. OK -- that didn't help with my confusion.\n\nWell, I verified that they wanted reggae party music, and that is definitely what they wanted. She proceeded to tell me that her mom had strict orders to have a party with her passing, not make it a sad occasion. So everything was going great, then the moment of silence took place with the late mother's sons paddling out in the surf to spread her ashes.\n\nAnd what happens next is something I will never forget as long as I live. The gentlemen spread her ashes, and at that very moment the skies opened and the sun shined on our party, and only our party. And then just a moment later, two whales showed up to say hello and frolic like little children in the waves directly in front of where the ashes had been placed.\n\nNow, I was a lifeguard for three years, and grew up in the ocean all of my life, and I had never seen a whale out here off our coast. I suppose it could happen, but the fact that it happened on that day, at that particular moment, at that exact location ... makes ya think. That was most definitely a day to remember.\n\nWhat musician/celebrity/historical person would you most like to have dinner with?\n\nOK -- brunch with Jesus, then dinner with Buddha and then after dinner we all meet up with the Dalai Lama for drinks. Can you imagine what kind of conversations would take place that afternoon?\n\nWhat was the last book you read?\n\n\"Green Eggs and Ham\" by Dr. Seuss\n\nWhat CD/tape/music is in your car/home stereo/iPod right now?\n\nDefinitely Jamie Cullum and Pat Metheny have been getting a lot of play around this household lately.\n\nWhat is your favorite movie?\n\nTo preface this answer -- this is not my most cultural side. But to name a few favorites: \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" \"Tommy Boy\" and \"Avatar (3D)\". Yeah.\n\nWhat was the best concert you ever attended?\n\nI think mostly of my first festival. It was at Spirit of Suwannee Music Park to participate at Spring Fest, which is basically a gathering of music lovers to listen and dance and share stories and experiences around campfires and hammocks in what is, in my opinion, the most beautiful place in Florida!\n\nBetween the nostalgic sound of bluegrass, and the ever so warm feeling from the smell of campfire, all tangled up in the long Spanish moss, beautiful aged oaks and fresh spring air, I felt I had found a relationship that is sure to last a lifetime. Kids running around being kids, adults running around being kids, a tree swing to jump in the river to cool off from the warm springtime sunshine -- this is truly an experience worthy of being a \"best\" for anyone.\n\n\"If I didn't play music, I would ... \":\n\nI always said I would be a traveling vendor at music festivals if I didn't have to practice everyday. Either that or be the president ... nah, festival vendor.\n\n\"I'd sell my soul for ...\":\n\nHow much are souls going for nowadays?"
