        "text": "American musician (born 1979)\n\nMusical artist\n\nGeoffrey William Rickly (born March 8, 1979) is an American musician and author, best known as the lead singer and songwriter of rock band Thursday. Rickly is also a member of hardcore punk band United Nations, and the alternative rock group No Devotion with former members of Lostprophets, and is the founder of the record label Collect Records.\n\nIn 2023 his debut novel, Someone Who Isn’t Me, was published by Rose Books.[2]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nRickly was born in Providence, Rhode Island and raised in Dumont, New Jersey, into a Catholic family, and attended Dumont High School, where he was a member of the band and played the tenor sax.[3][4] He attended Rutgers University until 2000 before dropping out to pursue music.[5] Rickly is a diagnosed epileptic, which has affected his ability to tour.[6]\n\nIn early 2013, Rickly was mugged in New York City, where his cell phone, iPad, wallet, credit card, rent money, and medication were stolen.[7][8] In 2015, Rickly was poisoned and robbed in Hamburg, Germany, while touring with No Devotion to play at the Reeperbahn Festival. Rickly was hospitalized, causing them to cancel their concert, but recovered for a scheduled show in Paris the following day.[9]\n\nIn a 2017 interview with Spin, Rickly spoke of battling a heroin addiction that began shortly after Thursday's breakup in 2011.[10] Following Thursday's reunion in 2016, Rickly was inspired to quit using the drug.[11]\n\nRickly lives with his partner Liza de Guia.[12][13]\n\nMusical career\n\n[edit]\n\nRickly has contributed guest vocals to many songs, including My American Heart's \"We Are the Fabrication\", Murder by Death's \"Killbot 2000\", This Day Forward's \"Sunfalls and Watershine\", Circa Survive's \"The Lottery\", and My Chemical Romance's \"This Is the Best Day Ever\". He also occasionally performs solo, most recently in Anaheim, California, at Kill Iconic Festival on March 23, 2024, performing his band, Thursday songs \"Understanding in a Car Crash\" and \"This Side of Brightness\" acoustically.\n\nLyrically, Rickly has been known to draw from a wide variety of influences, many of them being authors and poets. In a March 2009 interview,[14] he cited the works of Denis Johnson, Martin Amis, Roberto Bolaño and David Foster Wallace as being among his influences for the lyrics of Thursday's Common Existence album, which was released in February 2009. A tattoo on his forearm reads \"love is love\", a lyric from the band Frail; Rickly adopted these lyrics into Thursday's \"A Hole in the World.\" The band's song, \"Autobiography Of A Nation\" is clearly influenced by poet Michael Palmer's \"Sun.\"[citation needed] Rickly has also written, recorded and played for United Nations, an experimental powerviolence collaboration.\n\nCollect Records\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2009, Rickly formed Collect Records, a record label which in its early years only co-released various albums, including releases by Touché Amoré, United Nations and Midnight Masses, but in 2014, the label announced plans to be the primary label behind albums by Black Clouds, Vanishing Life, Sick Feeling and No Devotion.[15]\n\nMartin Shkreli controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2015 public scandal of hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli and his controversial monetary inflation of toxoplasmosis-related pharmaceuticals, it was revealed that Shkreli was a silent investor in Collect Records, while still allowing Rickly to retain creative control.[16] Rickly and Shkreli met when the guitar that Rickly used to make Thursday's album Full Collapse was purchased by Shkreli for $10,000.[17] Rickly said he was completely shocked by the scandal, stating: \"I've seen the guy give away money to schools, charities, and frankly, our bands, who if anyone really knows the industry, is a hard sell. I am struggling to find how this is OK.\"[16] Due to the controversy, Shkreli's relationship with Collect Records angered several artists signed to the label. One of the artists, Sick Feeling, said in a public statement: \"One thing is clear; as long as he has a part in the label, we, Sick Feeling, cannot. Our experience with Geoff, Norm, and Shaun has been nothing but positive, however, we cannot continue to work with Collect as long as Martin Shkreli has any part in it.\"[18] Dominic \"Nicky\" Palermo of Nothing, who had just recently signed a two-record deal with Collect Records, expressed interest in ending the contract and said: \"I'm hoping that we can just get out of this with someone else and not have to go down whatever ugly road that could lead to.\"[18] Within two days of the controversy, Rickly put out a press release stating that the label had severed its relationship with Shkreli, and that the amount of money he currently had in the bank could not cover Collect Records' outstanding invoices, leaving its future uncertain,[17][16] without Shkreli's significant financial contributions to Collect (estimated to be \"somewhere around a million dollars\"[17]).\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAs band member\n\n[edit]\n\nThursday\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see Thursday discography.\n\nWaiting (1999, Eyeball)\n\nFull Collapse (2001, Victory)\n\nFive Stories Falling (2002, Victory)\n\nWar All the Time (2003, Island)\n\nLive from the SoHo & Santa Monica Stores (2003, Island)\n\nLive in Detroit (2003, Island)\n\nA City by the Light Divided (2006, Island)\n\nKill the House Lights (2007, Victory)\n\nThursday / Envy (2008, Temporary Residence)\n\nCommon Existence (2009, Epitaph)\n\nNo Devolución (2011, Epitaph)\n\nUnited Nations\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited Nations (2008, Eyeball)\n\nNever Mind the Bombings, Here's Your Six Figures (2010, Deathwish)\n\nThe Next Four Years (2014, Temporary Residence)\n\nSolo\n\n[edit]\n\nMixtape 1 (2012, self released)[19]\n\nDarker Matter/// Mixtape 2 (2013, self-released)[20]\n\nStrangelight\n\n[edit]\n\n9 Days (2013, Sacrament)[21]\n\nNo Devotion\n\n[edit]\n\nPermanence (2015, Collect)\n\nNo Oblivion (2022, Velocity)\n\nAs guest member\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Artist Album Song Ref 2002 My Chemical Romance I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love \"This Is the Best Day Ever\" [22] 2002 This Day Forward Kairos \"Sunfalls and Watershine\" [23] 2003 Murder by Death Who Will Survive, and What Will Be Left of Them? \"Killbot 2000\" [23] 2003 Stretch Arm Strong Engage [23] 2005 The Blackout Pact Hello Sailor [23] 2005 My American Heart The Meaning in Makeup \"We Are the Fabrication\" 2008 Players Club \"Coextinction\" [23] 2009 Touché Amoré ...To the Beat of a Dead Horse \"History Reshits Itself\" [23] 2012 Circa Survive Violent Waves \"The Lottery\" [24] 2013 Man Overboard Heart Attack \"Open Season\" [23] 2020 Cremation Lily \"Light Gathers in the Corners of the Room, Pt.
