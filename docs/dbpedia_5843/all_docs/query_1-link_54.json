        "text": "Geoff Palmer’s Charts & Graphs will be released on July 23.\n\nRecorded by David Minehan (The Replacements), and mixed by Mike Kennerty (All American Rejects), the album will be released by Stardumb Records on vinyl, Rum Bar Records on CD, and Memorable But Not Honorable on cassette.\n\nSweet Sweet Music spoke with Geoff about the initial spark, the creative juices, and hearing your art come to life.\n\nHow did this record come together?\n\nIt came together much like my other records, haha. First, I get a batch of demos and song ideas organized and then start working with friends to make them come to life. I enjoy the early stages of writing an album. I like the whole process, but the initial spark up to the studio is always exciting.\n\nWhen did you decide to start asking for opinions on the new songs?\n\nAsking for opinions started pretty early on back when I first started writing. I’ve always liked working with people and getting the creative juices flowing in a group setting. Everybody hears things differently, and when you are with other writers and players, you respect that input is valuable.\n\nIf I did everything myself, I fear it would get too repetitive. But, when I look back at the catalog of albums and bands I’ve made, I feel proud that there are many different feels and styles in there. It all fits under the same basic umbrella, but there is variety. I believe that is because of working with and taking advice from outers.\n\nThe meaning of success has changed over the years. What would success look like for the new record?\n\nSuccess does change over the years. You want different things in life, and what was important yesterday might not be today. I love change. One thing that has always been a judge of success for me with a record or a band is doing something new, playing new places, trying new ideas for writing styles, new production ideas, anything we haven’t done before. I love meeting new people through music. If a song on the record catches on in a new genre, that is a success. Always try to open new doors and keep the old ones open too.\n\nRecording music. What’s all the fun about?\n\nI remember the first time I went to a studio to record properly. I was sitting down in the control room with the tape machine spinning and hearing the sounds come out of the speakers! Like, wow, that is us! It was so cool. Since then, I’ve always loved the studio. It’s probable my favorite part of being in a band. Building a song and hearing your art come to life is very fulfilling.\n\nIs recording a record easier than getting it heard nowadays?\n\nOh man, double-edged sword. It’s much easier to record and work on writing and production ideas because most people have decent little studios at home. It allows the option to work with people that before would have to fly out to a studio, and financially most times, that wasn’t an option. Releasing music is easier too, but that can flood the market a bit. I’m pro digital and using any modern marketing tools to connect with a listener base that will hopefully enjoy my tunes. Luckily for me, I have a label like Stardumb Records to release my stuff. That is a huge help because the label has been going for years and has a trusted name."
