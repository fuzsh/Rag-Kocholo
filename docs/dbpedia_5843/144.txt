I hope I am not flooding you but I have so much to share with you!

Geoffrey Love (4 September 1917 â€“ 8 July 1991), known as Geoff Love, was a prolific British arranger and composer of easy listening and pop versions of film themes. He became famous in the late 1950s, playing under the pseudonym of Manuel and The Music of The Mountains. I started listening to him from the late 1950s and I was in love with both his pseudonym and his style of music. I am sure you will love his style of orchestration. Shall we listen to his music then?

Stardust from the album Magic Fountains produced in late 60s.

Sleepy Lagoon from the album "The Sun, The Sea And The Sky", released in 1972.

La Vie En Rose from the album "Exotica", in 1965.

The Breeze and I from the album "Mountain Carnival", in 1961.

Island in the Sun "The Sun, The Sea And The Sky", released in 1972.

The enchanting Manuel for you!

Cheeniya, I've been listening to all the selections you have posted in the past few weeks. Manuel and The Music of The Mountains, Henry Mancini, Franck Pourcel, Mantovani ... I have IL open in one tab with your music threads and work in the other tabs. Mostly not logged in to IL in hopes of productivity : ) so I forget to click Like or post in thread. My listening and appreciation of music have improved a lot thanks to your threads. It is the year end and I am catching up on a lot of pending personal writing. Most of that was written with the music from your selections playing. Thank you for the music.
