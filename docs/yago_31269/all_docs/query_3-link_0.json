        "text": "Peter IV (born Sept. 5, 1319, or Sept. 15, 1317, Balaguer, Catalonia—died Jan. 5, 1387, Barcelona) was the king of Aragon from January 1336, son of Alfonso IV.\n\nPeter was the most cultivated of Spanish 14th-century kings but was also an inveterate political intriguer whose ability to dissemble was notorious. Through his voluminous correspondence, the workings of his mind are far better known than those of any contemporary Spanish ruler. Having picked a quarrel with James III of Majorca, he reincorporated the possessions of the Majorcan crown, namely the Balearic Islands and Roussillon, by force into his own dominions (1343–44). He next crushed the long-standing pretensions of the Aragonese nobles by defeating the armies of the Unión Aragonesa at Epila (1348), thereafter displaying the extreme vindictiveness that he always showed when his authority was challenged. Peter had to contend with revolt in Sardinia throughout his reign; but he succeeded, by political and military means, in preparing the future reunion of Sicily to the Aragonese crown and was recognized by the Catalan Almogávares as duke of Athens and Neopatras in 1380.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
