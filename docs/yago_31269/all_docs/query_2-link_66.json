        "text": "The Pyrenean kingdom of Navarre had a distinctive record with regard to female rule, with five reigning queens between the accession of Juana I in 1274 and the annexation of the realm by Castile in 1512. These five women, in common with all sovereigns, used the language of charters, the imagery on their seals and their visual representation on the coins of the realm to establish and emphasize their authority. They had to negotiate the particular challenge of female rulers; to define their authority both as the natural sovereign of the realm and with regard to their spouse, the king consort. This complex personal and political partnership between the female sovereign and her spouse confounded contemporary understandings of gender roles and the relationship between husband and wife. The husband was perceived, though Biblical tradition, of being the ‘head’ of his wife and yet the wife’s head wore the crown, creating a lack of clarity over how they ought to function as a ruling pair. This complicated power sharing dynamic between the queen and her consort found literal and physical expression in the cartulary and numismatic output of their reign. This paper will provide a comparative analysis of the address clauses, seals and coinage of the five reigning queens of Navarre. It will note the adoption and adaptation of previous models and the significant innovations which occurred, including the great double seal of Blanca I (r.1425-1441) and her consort Juan of Aragon and the portrait coins of Catalina I (r.1483-1512) and Jean d’Albret. It will compare the often divergent representation of authority in textual sources versus visual sources. For example, Juana I (r.1274-1305) was often listed after her husband or a reduced to a mention or consent clause in her cartulary and yet her name appears alone on the coins of the realm, with no mention of her powerful spouse. Taken together, these sources demonstrate the ways in which these queens demonstrated their authority as sovereigns, in context with their male predecessors and in tandem with their spouses. It will add to the understanding of rulership generally by highlighting practices in Navarre, which is often overlooked or omitted in wider surveys. It will also develop awareness of the particular challenges of representing female authority and this more unusual formulation of joint rule.\n\nThe figure of Queen Margaret, formerly Margaret of Anjou, her marital relationship with her new husband, King Henry VI, her relationship with her lover, the Duke of Suffolk, and the figure of Suffolk himself in 2 Henry VI, which was probably written in 1591 (Norton Shakespeare, 203) can be seen as an oblique commentary on the situation in England in the 1590s. In this paper, I will briefly focus on three ways in which the marital relationship can be regarded as relevant to the turbulent events of the 1590s: as a commentary on the monarchy in general and on Elizabeth in particular, as a commentary on the domestic situation in England, and as a commentary on England’s international situation.\n\nLindy Grant’s long awaited and magisterial (although here one particularly laments the lack of a genderappropriate adjective) book offers us a biography of Blanche of Castile, the Iberian princess famously chosen by her grandmother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, to marry the son of Philip II of France, Lord Louis, the future Louis VIII. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the importance of Blanche on many fronts, especially as dowager queen and regent for her son, Louis IX, Grant’s is the first substantive study of her since Elie Berger’s 1895 Histoire de Blanche de Castille, Reine de France. Grant’s book is very much a biography, in the best traditional sense, untroubled by considerations of, for example, postcolonial criticism. As such it invites comparison with the sprawling biography by Jacques Le Goff of Blanche’s son, the 1996 Saint-Louis. But here key differences emerge as well, for as William Chester Jordan has recently noted, Le Goff, hyper-prolific in the article format, was les..."
