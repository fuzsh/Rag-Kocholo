        "text": "Here are my thoughts on the Navarre Succession Crises in 1316, 1322, and in 1328.\n\nKing Philip IV the (Un) Fair had three sons and a nephew who married two sets of two sisters, who were daughters of Duke Robert II of Burgundy (in the Kingdom of France) and Count Otto IV of Burgundy (in the Kingdom of Burgundy and Holy Roman Empire).\n\nJeanne or Joan, the daughter of the future King Louis X and Margaret of (ducal) Burgundy, was born in 1312.\n\nKing Edward II of England and his teenage Queen Isabella visited King Philip IV in 1313 and Isabella gave embroidered purses to her brothers and their wives. Later in 1313 at a party in London, Isabella noticed the purses she gave to her sisters-in-law were being worn by two knights (who were another set of brothers). Isabella informed her father Philip IV on her next trip to France in 1314. Philip began investigating.\n\nPhilip's investigations led to the arrests of his sons' wives and their alleged lovers in 1314, accused of adultery in the tour de Nesle affair.\n\nMargaret of (ducal) Burgundy, wife of the future King Louis X, and Blanche of (county) Burgundy, wife of the future king Charles IV, were convicted of adultery and imprisoned, their husbands later remarried. Joan of (county) Burgundy, wife of the future King Philip V, was acquitted.\n\nSome have suggested that Isabella (who later deposed and possibly murdered her own husband) accused her sisters-in-law in the hope of gaining the French throne for her son Edward III.\n\nThe only son of any of the three sons of Philip IV to survive his father was John I, the baby king of France and Navarre, the rest of their surviving children were daughters. If daughters were allowed to inherit France and/or Navarre, Jeanne/Joan, daughter of king Louis X the oldest brother, would have been the logical choice. But when her half brother john I died 20 November 1316 Jeanne's uncle Philip V became King of France and Navarre, and when Philip V died in 1322, survived only by daughters, his brother Charles IV became King of France and Navarre.\n\nKing Philip IV the (Un) Fair of France only became King of Navarre by right of his wife Queen Joan I of Navarre. So with the death of their grandson John I in 1316, his sister and their granddaughter Jeanne/Joan became the rightful heir. She should have been proclaimed queen of Navarre at least, with Philip her regent, if not also queen of France.\n\nSince Jeanne/Joan was suspected of being illegitimate, it might also have been properly legal to make Philip king of France and Navarre (as he actually was made king) - on the grounds of being the closest heir of undoubted legitimate birth, and NOT on the grounds of being the closest male lineage heir as he claimed on 2 February 1317. In that case when Philip V died in 1322 without surviving sons his oldest daughter Joan (1308-1349) countess of Burgundy and Artois in her own right and wife of Duke Odo IV of Burgundy should have been the rightful Queen of Navarre, since her mother Joan was acquitted of adultery and remained on good terms with her husband.\n\nAnd if even the accusation of adultery on Joan of burgundy's part put Joan of burgundy's children (including her son Philip if he had lived long enough for it to matter) under too much suspicion of illegitimacy to inherit the throne of Navarre, then Charles IV should have inherited the throne of Navarre (as he did in fact). And when Charles IV died in 1328 his children by Blanche of Burgundy would have been in even more suspicion of illegitimacy but were already dead anyway. His only surviving children where by his third wife Jeanne d'Evreux and thus of undoubted legitimacy. Thus Charles IV's daughters Marie (1327-1341) and Blanche (1328-1382) should have been the undoubtedly legitimate heirs to Navarre.\n\nSo in 1316 either Jeanne/Joan, daughter of Louis X, should have become Queen of Navarre with Philip as regent, or Philip should have become King of Navarre if Jeanne/Joan was suspected too much of being illegitimate. If Philip became king of Navarre either his children including daughters should have been next in line, or if they were suspected of illegitimacy his brother Charles should have been next in line. And If Charles became King of Navarre because of suspicion of illegitimate birth for those ahead of him, then his heirs should have been his certainly legitimate children (and not his children whose legitimacy was suspected).\n\nSo the order of succession to Navarre should have been:\n\n1) King Philip IV the (Un) Fair of France by right of his wife Queen Joan I. Actual king of Navarre. Died 1314.\n\n2) King Louis X of France, son. Died 1316. Actual king.\n\n3) King John I of France, son. born and died in 1316. Actual king.\n\n4) Jeanne/Joan II. Sister. Passed over in 1316. That shouldn't have been because she was female like her grandmother Queen Joan I, or because she was too young, she was older than her half Brother King John I. The only logical reason to exclude her was doubt about her legitimacy.\n\nMaking Jeanne/Joan II Queen of Navarre in 1328 was a reversal of earlier decisions. Either it was restoring the rightful teenage queen after her evil uncles usurped the throne, or else it was putting an usurping Queen on the throne in place of the rightful heirs of the rightful kings Philip V and Charles IV. But it is hard to imagine any legal right except what the nobles involved desired at the time to make the decisions in 1316, 1322, and 1328 all legally correct.\n\n5) King Philip V of France (reigned 1316-1322) Actual king 1316-1322. the only logical reason to make him king of Navarre was doubt about Jeanne/Joan's legitimacy.\n\n6) Blanche of France (daughter of Philip V), Duchess and Countess of Burgundy, and her descendants and her sisters and their descendants.\n\n7) If Blanche of France and her sisters were excluded from the succession to Navarre because their mother was accused, though acquitted of adultery, King Charles IV of France (reigned 1322-1328). Actual King of Navarre 1322-1328. In my opinion King Charles IV should have either ceded Navarre to Joan in 1322 or declared that his sister Queen Isabella of England and her heirs were next in line to Navarre until and unless he should have some children of undoubted legitimacy.\n\n8) Marie (1327-1341) and Blanche (1328-1382), the undoubted legitimate daughters of King Charles IV, and their descendants. (they had no descendants).\n\n9) Queen Isabella of England and her descendants. And if suspicion was placed on the legitimacy of the children of the wives accused of adultery in 1314, only King Philip V and the future King Charles IV had better claims than Queen Isabella of England in 1316. Only only King Charles IV had a better claim than Queen Isabella of England in 1322. And only Marie (1327-1341) and Blanche (1328-1382) had better claims than Isabella to the throne of Navarre in 1328.\n\nIf King Charles IV of France had died in 1324, for example, the rightful heir of Navarre would have been either Joan II (with apologies for keeping the throne from her for so long), or else Blanche of France and her sisters, whose legitimacy might not have been as suspect as Joan II's, or else Queen Isabella of England whose legitimacy and that of her children was not suspected.\n\nAnd what reason did anyone have as late as 1316 to suspect that the succession laws of France should have been different from those of Navarre?\n\nSince the election of Hugh Capet in 987 each Capetian King of France had had a surviving son to succeed him. And for 200 years they had carefully had their oldest sons elected by the nobles and crowned co kings during their lifetimes. This had not been necessary for the last 100 years before 1316. So basically people had to look in the history books for successions more than 300 years earlier to figure out who should have inherited the French throne in the succession crises in 1316, 1322, and 1328.\n\nA that time there were four families whose members claimed the thrones of France and Navarre as descendants of King Philip IV and his wife Queen Joan I of Navarre and another family that claimed the throne of France as descendants of Count Charles of Valois the brother of Philip IV.\n\n1) Joan II (1312-1349), eventual Queen of Navarre, daughter of King Louis X of France and Navarre (died 1316), claim by seniority in male preference primogeniture but marred by suspicions she was the child of adultery.\n\n2) Joan of France (1308-1349), Countess of Burgundy and Artois in her own right, wife of Duke Odo IV of Burgundy, and her children and her sisters and their children, daughters of King Philip V. Their claim to Navarre was as the senior heirs by male preference primogeniture who were not suspected of illegitimacy as much as Joan II since their mother Joan of Burgundy had been acquitted of adultery but marred by still being suspected since their mother had been accused of adultery. Their father Philip V claimed on 2 February 1317 that women (and .....) could not inherit the throne of France. His only son Philip promptly died on 24 February 1317. Joan of France and her sisters and their descendants were thus disinherited in the eyes of those who accepted their father's claim of male only succession.\n\n3) Jeanne (May 1326 – January 1327), Marie (1327 – 6 October 1341) and Blanche (1 April 1328 – 8 February 1382), daughters of King Charles IV of France and Navarre by his third wife Jeanne d'Evreux. Their claim to Navarre would be that although their older half siblings (who died before their father anyway) had been suspected of being illegitimate, they were the senior line by male preference primogeniture that was not suspected of being illegitimate. Blanche married the Duke of Orleans but had no children.\n\n4) Isabella (1295-1358) daughter of King Philip IV, sister of Kings Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV, Queen of England, and her older son King Edward III of England (1312-1377). After the death of John I in 1316, only her brothers Philip V (died 1322) and Charles IV (died 1328) stood ahead of her as heirs of unchallenged legitimacy to Navarre until Charles IV finally had children of unchallenged legitimacy in 1326. Isabella could still have claimed the throne of Navarre for her son Edward III on the grounds that the kingship could be inherited through a female of unchallenged legitimacy but not by a female, a claim valid until any of the daughters of Charles IV had sons.\n\nOf course if doubts about the legitimacy of the daughters of Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV were not considered sufficient to disbar them from the throne of Navarre, there would have been more lives between Isabella and the throne of Navarre.\n\nAnd there was a fifth family with claims to the throne of France, but not to the throne of Navarre.\n\nPhilip VI (1293-1350), son of Count Charles \"of the Hat\" of Valois (1270-1325). Charles got his nickname because of his unsuccessful attempts to gain crowns. Philip may have inherited that desire for kingdoms.\n\nPhilip claimed the throne of France when Charles IV died in 1328, on the grounds that as Philip V had claimed in 1316 the throne could not pass to a female. Edward III claimed that the throne could pass through a female to a man, namely him. Philip claimed that the throne could only pass through males to males. That inheritance law called male primogeniture or agnatic primogeniture was used in Germany and many places during the Middles Ages but male preference primogeniture was more common. In male preference primogeniture a noble's sons would inherit in preference to his daughters, but if he had no sons his daughters would inherit in preference to his brothers or more distant male lineage relatives.\n\nMale preference primogeniture is more favorable to the king at the moment, because it makes it likely that the realm will go to his descendants instead of his cousins and relatives even if his male lineage descendants die off. Male only primogeniture is more favorable to the founder of the dynasty because ensures that the realm will always go to his male line descendants and not pass through females to another dynasty.\n\nBu why should a kingdom use an inheritance law that favors a centuries dead king (who supposedly would either be in heaven and so happy that nothing on Earth could make him happier, or else in hell where the devils wouldn't give him any good news about events on Earth) instead of an inheritance law that favors the present king who is alive to enjoy knowing his child and heir will inherit even if a female? What would the people of the kingdom gain by male only primogeniture for the king, when most of them did not want to follow it in the inheritance of their own property?\n\nSome time later French propaganda claimed that male only or agnatic primogeniture had been the ancient law of the Franks because it was in the centuries old and long disused law code of the Salian Franks. So male only or agnatic primogeniture is usually called the Salic Law. Despite the fact that many French fiefs passed through females in contradiction to the supposed Salic Law both before and after the succession controversy.\n\nPhilip VI had no claim to the Kingdom of Navarre since he wasn't descended from Queen Joan I, but no doubt he would have grabbed Navarre if he had a chance to. And I think that his succession in France was just as unjustified as usurping Navarre would have been.\n\nAs far as I can tell the only legal justification for Philip V, Charles IV, and Philip VI becoming kings of France is because many powerful nobles decided to make them kings, no doubt in the belief that their succession to the throne would be better for the deciding nobles than the succession of someone else like, for example, Edward III. And later events showed that the opinion of the nobles about which choice would be best for them was - however legal it may or may not have been - a big mistake.\n\nSo I ask why should the new succession law needed in France for the first time in centuries in the early 14th century, have been any different than the succession law of Navarre?\n\nNote. Writing this on 26 September 2016 was the first time I realized that the children of King Philip V and King Charles IV could have made serious claims to the throne of Navarre.\n\nHeirs of the claimants to the throne:\n\nAt that time there were four families whose members claimed the thrones of France and Navarre as descendants of King Philip IV and his wife Queen Joan I of Navarre and one family that claimed the throne of France as descendants of Count Charles of Valois the brother of Philip IV.\n\n1) Joan II (1312-1349), eventual Queen of Navarre, daughter of King Louis X of France and Navarre (died 1316), claim by seniority in male preference primogeniture but marred by suspicions she was the child of adultery.\n\n2) Joan of France (1308-1349), Countess of Burgundy and Artois in her own right, wife of Duke Odo IV of Burgundy, and her children and her sisters and their children, daughters of King Philip V. Their claim to Navarre was as the senior heirs by male preference primogeniture who were not suspected of illegitimacy as much as Joan II since their mother Joan of Burgundy had been acquitted of adultery but marred by still being suspected since their mother had been accused of adultery. Their father Philip V claimed on 2 February 1317 that women (and .....) could not inherit the throne of France. His only son Philip promptly died on 24 February 1317. Joan of France and her sisters and their descendants were thus disinherited in the eyes of those who accepted their father's claim of male only succession.\n\n3) Jeanne (May 1326 &#8211; January 1327), Marie (1327 &#8211; 6 October 1341) and Blanche (1 April 1328 &#8211; 8 February 1382), daughters of King Charles IV of France and Navarre by his third wife Jeanne d'Evreux. Their claim to Navarre would be that although their older half siblings (who died before their father anyway) had been suspected of being illegitimate, they were the senior line by male preference primogeniture that was not suspected of being illegitimate. Blanche married the Duke of Orleans but had no children.\n\n4) Isabella (1295-1358) daughter of King Philip IV, sister of Kings Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV, Queen of England, and her older son King Edward III of England (1312-1377). After the death of John I in 1316, only her brothers Philip V (died 1322) and Charles IV (died 1328) stood ahead of her as heirs of unchallenged legitimacy and paternity to Navarre until Charles IV finally had children of unchallenged legitimacy and patrnity in 1326. Isabella could still have claimed the throne of Navarre for her son Edward III on the grounds that the kingship could be inherited through a female of unchallenged legitimacy but not by a female, a claim valid until any of the daughters of Charles IV had sons.\n\nOf course if doubts about the legitimacy and paternity of the daughters of Louis X, Philip V, and Charles IV were not considered sufficient to disbar them from the throne of Navarre, there would have been more lives between Isabella and the throne of Navarre.\n\nAnd there was a fifth family with claims to the throne of France, but not to the throne of Navarre.\n\nPhilip VI (1293-1350), son of Count Charles \"of the Hat\" of Valois (1270-1325). Charles got his nickname because of his unsuccessful attempts to gain crowns. Philip may have inherited that desire for kingdoms.\n\nAnd here are the lines of succession to those five families:\n\nLine Number One: Senior line of succession through Louis X, legitimacy and descent from previous kings doubted:\n\nJoan II (1312-1349) daughter of King Louis X, was passed over as Queen of France and Navarre in 1316 and 1322 and became Queen of Navarre in 1328. The senior heir, but of suspect paternity.\n\n1) Joan II (1312-1349) and King Philip III (1306-1343) Count of Evreux, her husband.\n\n2) Charles II (1332-1387) the Bad.
