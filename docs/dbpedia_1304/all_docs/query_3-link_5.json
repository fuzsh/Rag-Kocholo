        "text": "“The Lost Boys: Hard-To-Find ’80s Albums” gives you exactly what the title implies: a rare or out-of-print album from the ’80s in its entirety. Some will be from CD, but most will have been lovingly transferred from pristine vinyl culled directly from the Analog Kid’s vast collection. Whatever album I choose, it will be one that you can’t easily find a physical copy for sale on Amazon or in your local record store (if you even have one anymore). Death…by stereo!\n\nThe Kinks experienced a pretty amazing comeback on the American side of the Atlantic in the late ’70s and early ’80s– they sold tons of records, packed arenas nationwide, and even had hit videos on MTV. A lot of my friends (Hi Bri! Hi Wade!) were REALLY into the band, but for some reason I just couldn’t seem to get on board. OK, it wasn’t really some reason: it was a reason, and that reason was “Come Dancing.” I was addicted to MTV back in the summer of 1983, and MTV was addicted to the video for “Come Dancing.” It was on at least once an hour for that entire summer (literally, “All Day And All Of The Night’), and by August I was ready to kick Ray Davies in the nuts. I stopped listening to The Kinks completely, and that sabbatical lasted a good fifteen years or so. And then a magical thing happened…\n\nI started buying vinyl again. I started buying any and all vinyl that I could get my hands on, and that meant that I bought lots of Kinks records at what would definitely be considered very reasonable prices. At some point, I put Give The People What They Want and State Of Confusion and Low Budget on my turntable for the first time in years. And you know what? I loved them. I had ALWAYS loved them. Even “Come Dancing” didn’t sound so bad after a long break, although I still wouldn’t put it in my Kinks top 100.\n\nI ripped most of my Kinks vinyl to mp3 years ago, and have recently begun re-ripping these long out-of-print albums using my newer (and better!) equipment. I created a brand-new 320 kbps rip of 1981’s Give The People What They Want earlier today, and I thought that it would be the perfect album to share with you after a long (long) period of inactivity on The Analog Kid Blog. AND IT GOES LIKE THIS!!\n\nThe Kinks: Give The People What They Want\n\nArista Records, 1981\n\nAll songs written by Ray Davies\n\n320 kbps vinyl rip courtesy of The Analog Kid\n\n1. “Around The Dial”\n\nAround The Dial\n\n2. “Give The People What They Want”\n\nGive The People What They Want\n\n3. “Killer’s Eyes”\n\nKiller’s Eyes\n\n4. “Predictable”\n\nPredictable\n\n5. “Add it Up”\n\nAdd It Up\n\n6. “Destroyer”\n\nDestroyer\n\n7. “Yo-Yo”\n\nYo-Yo\n\n8. “Back To Front”\n\nBack To Front\n\n9. “Art Lover”\n\nArt Lover\n\n10. “A Little Bit Of Abuse”\n\nA Little Bit Of Abuse\n\n11. “Better Things”\n\nBetter Things\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nBonus Tracks!\n\nThe first rule of The Analog Kid blog is that if you write about a song on the Analog Kid blog, you share the song on the Analog Kid blog.\n\nThe Kinks: “Come Dancing” (Ray Davies)\n\nFrom the album State Of Confusion\n\nArista Records, 1983\n\nCome Dancing\n\nThe Kinks: “All Day And All Of The Night” (Ray Davies)\n\nFrom the album Kinks-Size\n\nReprise Records, 1964"
