        "text": "Among people who don't want to have an 'obvious' choice like The Beatles or The Rolling Stones, but who also don't want to come across as pretentious jerks in their selection, The Kinks have become a very common and a rather understandable alternative answer to the question, \"Who is your favorite band of all time?\" To say these guys were neglected by mainstream culture for years is to say nothing; their best albums sold horribly on initial release, and for a very long time they essentially went down in history (to the average person) as a two-hit wonder (\"You Really Got Me\" in 1963, \"Lola\" in 1971). Eventually, though, history ended up being pretty kind to the group, recognizing that they helped create both hard rock and Brit-pop (within a short time of one another), as well as that the number of bands that can claim The Kinks amongst their influences is through the roof. The band wasn't immaculately consistent at its peak, and the band could've split around 1972 with no major negative impact on the music world at large, but the band's best songs have to be considered among the peaks of rock and pop music as a whole.\n\nOne of the most important factors contributing both to the band's lack of commercial success in the 60's and to its deserved accolades decades later is the defiant timelessness of the band's classic style. Few bands ignored mainstream psychedelia (aside from one or two lapses in judgment) quite like these guys did in the late 60's, and nobody did a better job of ignoring and defying 20th century \"progress\" than these guys did. Ray Davies would have been perfectly happy living 100 years earlier than he did, and made sure that the listener knew it very well; he loved to incorporate traditional music hall styles into his songs, and his lyrical topics screamed out OLD SCHOOL BRITISH as loud as could possibly be. This was not music for the young and rebellious and the people rock music was supposed to be targeting; one of the band's best albums was a concept piece about nostalgia, for heaven's sake. Nah, this is music for people who are, at least on some level, aged beyond their years, and for whom getting old is not necessarily a bad thing. Yet as intriguing and close to unique as this style may have been, it would have been largely wasted if it weren't for so many AWESOME melodies and riffs as Ray was able to come with in his prime. They tend to be simple and direct, just as the lyrics tend to be, but they very often tend to be simple in a way that suggests a musical genius at work (though fairly often the simplicity isn't close to as impressive as it is when Ray is at his peak).\n\nSo that's the upside of the band. Unfortunately, the band had a pretty large set of downsides, which I prefer not to dwell on excessively but nonetheless are kinda hard to ignore. Unlike The Beatles and Rolling Stones, the band didn't have multiple great songwriters at its disposal; Ray Davies was undoubtedly a songwriting genius, but he was only one, and the few contributions of his brother Dave, however nice they might have been at times (\"Death of a Clown\" was probably the peak) hardly qualify him for the \"great songwriter\" title. Unlike The Who, they didn't have multiple powerful creative forces at work against each other; the band was always, in essence, the Davies and extras (however useful they might have been at times), and that helped exacerbate the problem of having only one great songwriter.\n\nPartially as a consequence of those two factors, the band's output was spotty at best for the last, oh, twenty years of its career, with two or three (or so) good songs per album and a bunch of generic mediocre bleh otherwise. People like to say that the same problem exists with the Stones post-Exile, but ehn, Tattoo You is one of my favorite albums ever, and albums like Black and Blue and Some Girls sound unabashedly great to me. Nah, Davies just mostly lost it after '72 or so, and never really got it back, except for a very mild resurgence in the late 70's and early 80's.\n\nStill, the band's post-peak failings shouldn't and can't obscure the band's one-time greatness. The band never made what my ears would consider a \"perfect\" album, largely because of the issues mentioned above, and the band had a habit of not putting all its best songs on its albums (there are a lot of great bonus tracks on the reissues of their albums) that I consider a little annoying, but it's as deserving of a **** rating as just about any other band on my site. About half of the band's discography can be discarded with little pain (especially the Preservation etc. albums in the mid 70's, not to mention the bland 80's stuff), but the band's best work is absolutely essential.\n\nWhat do you think of The Kinks?\n\nYankees92352.aol.com (04/10/07)\n\nExcluding the super groups, Beatles, Stones, Zep, and the Who, the Kinks are the greatest rock band from that, or any other era. Along with Wishbone Ash and dada, The Kinks remain one of my all time favorites. Ray was the songwriting equal of Pete Townsend, and the band had so many underrated classics like Sleepwalker, Soap Opera, and Schoolboys in Disgrace. I saw them in Memphis 1980 and it was a highlight of my concert career. And I've seen everybody from 1968-83. Let's put this great band where they belong....right at the rock top.\n\nKinks - 1964 Pye\n\n5\n\n(Mediocre / Bad)\n\nBest song: You Really Got Me\n\nI know I'm not breaking any new ground by saying this, but the first Kinks album sucks, with an obvious exception. The band sounds so destined for Nuggets infamy on this album that it's just pretty sad; outside of that one major, major classic, the band just doesn't sound like it can really do anything right. Like pretty much all bands at that time, they had to fill out the album with a number of covers, which wouldn't be a problem (the covers on the first three Stones albums, for instance, are fantastically entertaining) except for the fact that they sound totally incompetent in doing them. It doesn't help that Dave is asked to sing on several of them; Ray doesn't sound that great on this album, but the only rational explanation for allowing Dave to take lead on so many of these is that the Davies' mother must have said something like, \"Now Ray, be nice and let your little brother sing your little tunes, you don't need to hog all the glory.\" Add in that the instrumental skills of the group are average at best, and you have hardcore tedium.\n\nWith the one obvious exception, the originals (and there are a surprising number of them) aren't interesting either. The brief instrumental \"Revenge\" is so primitive that I actually find it kinda cute and endearing, and \"Stop Your Sobbing\" is a decent stab at sounding like the Fab Four, but the other three lesser tracks just ooze awkwardness. Fortunately for all, though, there is the classic, the song that would have ensured (at the least) the band a place in rock history among the greatest one-hit wonders of all time (alongside The Seeds, The Kingsmen and other Nuggets greats). \"You Really Got Me\" may or may not have invented the concept of heavy rock with its devastating five-note riff (and accidentally awesome guitar tone), but there's no denying that it's one of the greatest songs of the early 60's, one of the greatest songs of the band's career and a classic that sounds rough and powerful many decades after initial release. And don't forget that solo, a glorious burst of sloppy (in a good way) enthusiasm that probably inspired a legion of punk rockers more than a decade later.\n\n(As an aside, I must confess that, for the longest time, I thought the line, \"You've got me so I can't sleep at night,\" was actually \"You've got me so I can't see that knife,\" which led me to think that the song was about a woman having a guy under her control so much that she was in a position to kill him. Silly me.)\n\nUnfortunately, that song's all that can be seriously recommended from the original release of the album. I actually have the expanded version, with multiple bonus tracks; some of these will be covered in my review of Kinksize/Kinkdom, and of the rest, the major standout is the \"Got Me\" clone, \"All Day and All of the Night,\" which rules at least 90% as much as its predecessor. Funny how the band sounded so awesome when doing one specific type of song and so ... not awesome otherwise. Anyway, of the other non-Kinkdom bonus tracks, the alternate cover of \"Too Much Monkey Business\" is moderately recommendable, but otherwise, meh. Just get the best songs on a compilation somewhere, and ignore the rest, bonus tracks or no.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nBen (benburch500.hotmail.com) (02/13/12)\n\nI heard \"You Really Got Me\" years before I heard this album. I already loved it, and assumed the rest of the album would be just like it. I was horribly wrong. The band is having too much fun here, and Ray's singing abilities are non existent. I completely agree with you on this one.\n\nKinda Kinks - 1965 Pye\n\n7\n\n(Mediocre / Good)\n\nBest song: Tired Of Waiting For You\n\nBy some miracle, the hilarious ineptitude of Kinks (apart from Got Me) wasn't enough to prevent the band from having the opportunity to make a followup, and thankfully this is much better. There aren't any gigantic standouts this time around, but aside from the two covers (the stiffest rendition in the world of \"Dancing in the Streets\" and a showcase for some terrible Dave vocals in the dragging \"Nagging Woman\"), the band no longer sounds completely incompetent. They don't sound great yet, apart from a couple of really nice songs, but they sound good enough that an album consisting only of the originals found here could muster at least an 8.\n\nNot surprisingly, the songs that sound best are the ones where Ray sounds the most self-assured as a songwriter, meaning that he's not blatantly using other artists (and popular styles) of the day as a blatant crutch. Well, ok, the 'softer' guitar lines of \"Tired of Waiting for You\" sound a little Byrds-ish (while Dave pounds out his rougher chords with glee), but the melody is totally unlike anything else I've heard from that period, and Ray's singing and lyrics run the gamut of emotions of a cheated lover so effectively that it becomes much easier to understand how he'd be able to make the big jump within just a couple of years' time. \"Something Better Beginning\" is also quite nice, with some nice shaky (in a good way) vocals and a deep echoing production (with guitars that sound like they'd be perfectly at home with the harpsichords that would have filled this song had it been written two years later) that complements a melody that's full of twists and resolutions that most songwriters (including Davies himself on the rest of this album) would have killed for.\n\nUnfortunately, while none of the other originals suck, none of them are even close to the two highlights. The opening \"Look for me Baby\" is an awkward R&B number that sounds a bit too much like an average track on Kinks, and the multiple Rays singing in the background aren't very impressive, but at the same time, it feels much more developed than the average track from that album. Dave does a surprisingly acceptable job of singing a few up-tempo numbers, especially in \"Got My Feet on the Ground,\" a fun piece of boogie rock. The rest of the tracks basically fall into the \"average pop ballad\" category, meaning they're nice when on and completely out-of-mind when the album's done.\n\nThis album, especially in the context of its predecessor, presents The Kinks as a giant enigma. Obviously Ray could write very, VERY good songs ... so why weren't there more of them by this point? Were The Kinks a mediocre band capable of pulling out a totally solid number only about one time in five, or were they a great band in embryo that just needed some time and patience to fully develop? Obviously you can guess my answer, but based on just these first two albums alone, it's still a bit of a puzzle. Of course, the bonus tracks on this CD give a strong hint, as mentioned in the next review...\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nBen (benburch500.hotmail.com) (02/13/12)\n\nI don't think this album is an improvement over the first one, in fact I think it's worse. There's only one song I like here, and even that doesn't match up to the better songs from this period (\"You Shouldn't Be Sad\"). I'll give this a solid two out of ten.\n\nKinkssize / Kinkdom - 1988 Rhino\n\nA\n\n(Very Good / Good)\n\nBest song: See My Friends or I'm Not Like Everybody Else\n\nTo somebody like me, in the present day, one of the most irritating aspects of the 60's music industry was the separation of singles and albums. I can understand having singles as a way to promote an album, but the practice of keeping singles off of albums had only commercial and no real artistic value (in my opinion). For bands like the Beatles and the Stones, there was at least the bonus of having a glut of great tracks to put onto singles compilations that could serve as a solid supplement to the great albums put out by them. In the case of the Kinks, though, there's the weird situation where this singles compilation (actually a pair of compilations originally issued in the US back in 1965, reissued in the late 80's) beats the absolute snot out of the first three albums as a whole. I should note, by the way, that this compilation is technically no longer in print, but that's because it can be entirely constructed out of bonus tracks from the band's first four albums (four from Kinks, a whopping ten from Kinda Kinks, two from Kinks Kontroversy and one from Face to Face).\n\nThis collection doesn't start off very well, truth be told. The opening \"Who'll be the Next in Line\" is a better attempt at generic up-tempo 60's pop rock than similar attempts on Kinda Kinks, but that's not saying a whole lot; the band's cover of \"Louie Louie\" is shockingly bland and uninteresting (in theory, no band should have been able to do a better version of this song than \"You Really Got Me\"-era Kinks, but this version is as stiff and uninspiring as can be); \"I've Got That Feeling\" is pleasant and decently written but unnecessary; and \"Everybody's Gonna be Happy\" is only particularly interesting in the unusual way Ray sings, \"Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii know, Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii know.\" Starting in track five, though, the band stops sounding like a weak mix of other, better bands of the day, and starts sounding like a band that can actually mark out its own identity (and do it decently well). Two tracks (\"I Gotta Go Now,\" \"Things are Getting Better\") that were found amongst the Kinks bonus tracks are as primitive as I'd expect (especially lyrically), but they also have a delightful bit of whimsy and fun in the vocal harmonies, so that's at least something.\n\nThe next eight tracks, then, are so much better than the bulk of Kinda Kinks that it's hilarious. The most infamous highlight of these is \"See My Friends,\" where Ray goes all out in trying to replicate an Indian sound in both his singing and in the guitar playing (no sitar here, but it sure sounds like one), which would probably make him the first person in British pop music to have done so unless somebody can come up with some obscure example to prove me wrong. I like all of the rest of these tracks as well, but the standouts for me would have to be \"Well Respected Man\" (the first of Ray's many, many character sketches, and one that fittingly describes somebody whose life isn't quite as great as it looks on the surface), \"I Need You\" (another rewrite of \"You Really Got Me,\" but which sounds absolutely pummeling) and \"Set Me Free\" (which merges power chords with emotive balladry in a delightful way that probably would have sucked had it been written twenty years later but which sounds like blissful in this 60's context). And, well, the others from this group are nice too.\n\nThe two Kontroversy tracks are a lot fun, and (surprise) are better than the album they accompany (both could have gone very well on Face to Face). \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\" is a fun sketch of a guy who dresses way too well to be fully straight, and \"Sitting On My Sofa\" does stoned proto-psychedelia as well as any band could have in 1965. And finally, the album ends on a very high point with the lone Face to Face representative, a track that captures the alienation, self-hatred and nihilism of classic punk as well as any track I've heard from the mid-60's. \"I'm Not Like Everybody Else\" has arguably the best angry delivery (from Dave, no less; at last, he got some control of his voice) in the whole Kinks catalogue, and the way it builds into a melodic, yet convincing screaming fit in the chorus (before quickly shifting back into quiet at the end of each iteration) is something amazing to behold.\n\nI guess what I like most about this collection is that it gives me a chance to hear the band evolve over the course of roughly half an hour from tolerably average to a band on the cusp of greatness. The fact that these tracks are only available as bonuses to (on the whole) mediocre albums is a bit obnoxious, but if you like 60's Kinks, you simply must collect these tracks in any way you can.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nMichael Easton (michaeleaston10.gmail.com) (04/10/07)\n\nHi. First comment here.\n\nI don't have the album, so I can't comment on that. However, I have been to a few Ray Davies concerts in my life and he has always opened with 'I'm Not Like Everybody Else.' As much as I like Dave's version, it sounds so much better when it is in the hands of Ray. Either way, it's a great song!\n\nBen (benburch500.hotmail.com) (02/13/12)\n\nI don't have this album, but I've heard all the songs, and have them all on different formats.\n\nThe Kinks were indeed still a crappy band at this point, having the occasional good song or two. Their second good song (\"All Day and All of the Night\") is better than their first (\"You Really Got Me\") so there was some hope at least. That's the only good song on \"Size\". They couldn't even do \"Louie Louie\" right. \"Kinkdom\" has a few good songs, \"A Well Respected Man\", \"I Need You\", \"See My Friends\" and \"I'm Not Like Everybody Else\") and two okay ones (\"Sitting on My Sofa\" and \"Who'll Be the Next in Line?\") but they still had a long way to go.\n\nThe Kink Kontroversy - 1965 Pye\n\n8\n\n(Good / Mediocre)\n\nBest song: Where Have All The Good Times Gone?\n\nThere are two things that stood out to me most while listening to this album in earnest.\n\n1. The band is way, way better on here than on the first two proper Kinks albums. There isn't a single obvious stinker as far as my ears can hear, as Davies has finally figured out how to consistently write decent early 60's guitar-pop. Heck, even the sole cover, the opening Dave-sung \"Milk Cow Blues,\" is given a rendition that's miles above the covers that had littered the last two albums (I don't know if the Stones ever covered this, but I'm betting that The Kinks' version would at least match, if not exceed a version by them). Add in that Ray is no longer using \"You Really Got Me\" as a major crutch, and you have a pretty impressive achievement.\n\n2. If the band had continued along this vein, they were simply not going to get any better. Their stuff might have been starter-quality at the AAA level by this point, but as major-leaguers they were going to be middle relievers at best. The whole album exudes competence, but distressingly little of it goes beyond that point. The sole classic (later covered by Van Halen to great effect) is \"Where Have All the Good Times Gone,\" a great ode to getting stressed out by life and longing for a more relaxing time, even while acknowledging that, \"things are so much easier today.\" It does a great job of contrasting a sing-songey chorus with an aggressive Dylanish vocal in the verses, and shows some real creative oomph that's mostly lacking on the rest of the album.\n\nIndeed, aside from \"Till the End of the Day,\" the closest thing to a \"Got Me\" clone on the album (though it's much different in vibe, replacing the \"I want you babe\" feel of \"Got Me\" with \"Think happy thoughts think happy thoughts\" as if he was in that one Twilight Zone episode with the kid who could read minds), and the mildly pretty ballad \"Ring the Bells,\" the whole album falls into the \"decent but disposable\" category. These songs just reek of anachronism, and not just today; it's amazing to realize these were released at a time when Dylan had put out Bringing it All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited, and when the Beatles were just about to release Rubber Soul. Something like \"When I See That Girl of Mine,\" nice as it may be, wouldn't have come close to deserving inclusion on any Beatles album after Please Please Me, and given that Ray was somebody who would be writing \"Rainy Day in June\" and \"Sunny Afternoon\" as soon as the next album, this is impossible to ignore. The songs almost all have moderate hooks, and are basically enjoyable when on, but they fail to make any permanent dent in my consciousness once they're done (in contrast, turn back to \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\" and \"Sitting on My Sofa,\" which are bonus tracks here).\n\nIn the end, an 8 is really the only possible grade for this album. It is good, no question about it ... but it only aspires to greatness a couple of times, and that can't be ignored. Thankfully, though, greatness was just around the corner...\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nBen (benburch500.hotmail.com) (02/13/12)\n\nWhat a pleasant surprise. This is the first good Kinks album. Hearing it directly after the abysmal albums before it, I hated this at first, figuring it was just like them. For some reason, the more I hear this album the more I like it. Now I realize there's much more than just \"Till the End of the Day\" (my favorite Kinks song). I always expected proto-punk and farage rock like that song and \"All Day...\" and \"You Really Got Me\" from the first two albums but never really found it until now.\n\nI can't really find any song on here I don't like, but other than \"Till the End of the Day\" nothing really stands out. For a fun mid sixties album not dozed in psychedelic nonsense, this is a great album, but it certainly hasn't dated well. I got the mono version of this album from the deluxe edition and I have to say its much better in mono. I'll give this a seven out of ten.\n\nFace To Face - 1966 Pye\n\nB\n\n(Very Good)\n\nBest song: Sunny Afternoon\n\nSupposedly, this Great Leap Forward for The Kinks was originally supposed to be a Great Leap Forward for all of rock music in general. Yup, rumor has it that this album was originally supposed to contain 18 tracks connected by dialogue and full of sound effects (which would have allowed the band to pull off its own Sgt. Pepper a year before 1967), but The Evil Record Company thought this wouldn't sell and forced the release of 14 un-connected songs (with only a couple containing sound effects). I honestly don't know what other songs were originally intended for this album, but if they included or were on par with the best bonus tracks on the reissue, this album would have been an all-time monster. As is, while it's still a good way from perfect, it's still terrific and very easily the band's best to date.\n\nAllegedly, Ray had a bit of a nervous breakdown early in the sessions of recording this album, fueled by a realization that he was getting older and becoming an industry pawn and being forced to write music that wasn't 100% what he had his heart in, and it seems that coming out of it armed him with a giant \"Screw It All\" attitude that allowed him to change his musical and especially lyrical approaches drastically. Looking past the opening sound effect of a telephone ringing and a Brit answering, the opening \"Party Line\" might be considered just another in the line of Dave-sung up-tempo openers, but the lyrics are already 100% classic Kinks. \"Is she big? Is she small? Is she a she at all?\" and \"I'm not voting in the next election unless somebody does something about finding out the person who is on my party line\" are bits of goofy cleverness that no other songwriter would ever (at that time) have had the ability to write. \"Rosy Won't You Please Come Home?\" is another example of a \"normal\" song that sounds way different from anything else of the time, both because of the heavy dose of harpsichord (a year earlier Ray would have just used standard instrumentation) and because he addresses the topic of a runaway child not from the typical angle of the rebellious child but instead from the angle of the parents who miss their kid and who will, if she comes home, \"bake a cake if (she likes) it.\" And then we have \"Dandy,\" a two-minute portrait of a swinging bachelor that contains my favorite Kinks lyric of all time (\"And when you're old and gray you will remember what's been said, that two girls are too many, three's a crowd and four you're dead\"). It also shows Ray effectively doing an acoustic guitar-popper that's more Rubber Soul than Please Please Me, and MAN that's good to hear from him.\n\n\"Too Much on My Mind\" strikes me as a slight step down, but not as much as I originally thought it was; the verse melody is a little weak, but the sweet chorus (with more effective harpsichord) mostly makes up for it. \"Session Man\" is a cute pop song with an excuse to have a solo harpsichord introduction (the chorus is a little dippy - \"He's a session man, a chord prog-ress-i-on, a top mu-sic-i-an\" - but that's part of its charm), and then we have the first major highlight of the album, \"Rainy Day in June.\" What's most interesting to me about this song is the way Ray almost manages to sound like a pretentious art-rocker or fantasy-metaller lyrically (this is a song that mentions misty shadows and eagles spreading their mighty wings, demons stretching crinkled hands and snatching a butterfly, and elves and gnomes hunched in fear), but he uses these images very carefully, making sure the listener mainly remembers it was a rainy day, and everybody felt the rain. As a dark, apocalyptic pop song, this is remarkable because of the fact that, unlike Morrison and Co. a year later (and I like The Doors, bear in mind), the potentially goofy \"gothic\" aspects are only used as window dressing, and not as anything like the main attraction (which definitely consists of the melody, the chorus and the *BOOM* of the thunder).\n\nThe album is a little spotty from here on out, but it's still fine overall. The best of the lot is \"Sunny Afternoon,\" a song that's so awesomely square it's a rectangle. It combines amazing lyrics about a rich guy who's lost everything except his mansion to taxes and other sundry sources, a melody that reworks traditional music hall values in a way that nobody else was even considering at the time, and a playful vocal delivery (with GREAT backing harmonies in the chorus) that argues the case of Ray Davies As Genius as well as anything else in the band's catalogue. Unfortunately, none of the rest of the album comes close to hitting this peak, nor does it quite live up to the initial stretch thru \"Rainy Day in June.\" \"Fancy\" is a particular low point, with nothing I can recommend musically; the melody is unmemorable and kinda ugly, and the way Ray's vocals mix with the acoustic guitars and the bass just strikes me as an awkward attempt at something vaguely pyschedelic. The rest ranges from fairly standard 'primitive' rockers (\"Holiday in Waikiki\" is the best, with energetic drumming and an amusing travelogue for lyrics, while \"House in the Country\" and the Dave-sung \"You're Looking Fine\" are at least moderately catchy and provide good balance to the album, even if I don't love them) to more attempts to smoosh Ray's new approach in with standard Brit-pop-rock (\"Most Exclusive Residence for Sale\"; the closing \"I'll Remember,\" which would have stood out a lot earlier in the album but gets kinda dwarved by \"Sunny Afternoon,\" which proceeds it), and finally to an acoustic character sketch that has nice lyrics and an ok set of vocal melodies and chord sequences (\"Little Miss Queen of Darkness\"). No, they're not amazing, and they certainly let the album down a bit overall (it's a very, very good thing that \"Sunny Afternoon\" shows up when it does to leave a good taste in my mouth at the end), but they're still good on the whole.\n\nOverall, then, this is a fine debut of the \"classic\" Kinks sound, and while they'd certainly improve on it in the future, this album is a necessity for any Kinks collection and for any decent overall collection. This is especially true given the AMAZING quality of the bonus tracks on the reissue, which I will be mostly ignoring (and not counting in the overall rating) on the grounds that I will cover them in my Kink Kronikles review later. A couple of them aren't found on that collection, however, and one of them, the Dave-sung \"Mr. Reporter\" (with amazingly biting lines like, \"Do you like what you're doing or is it that you can do nothing else?\" and \"I'll believe all that you put down. I'll believe the sun is going up, even though it's going down.\") is a minor classic (the other, the \"Little Women,\" is a nice two-minute instrumental that makes use of a lot of mellotron flutes in the first half and standard mellotron sounds in the last twenty seconds). Anyway, seek out this album, and especially seek out the reissue.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nBen (benburch500.hotmail.com) (02/13/12)\n\nThis album proved that The Kinks weren't just a flash in the pan and can be taken seriously. I agree with you on just about everything except I really don't like \"Rainy Day in June\" and \"Most Exclusive Residence\" is my favorite song.\n\nMy list of favorites isn't that long, but there are some songs that rank among my favorite Kinks songs. These include \"Rosie,\" \"I'll Remember You,\" \"Sunny Afternoon,\" \"House in the Country\" and \"Holiday.\" the rest of the songs (aside from \"Rainy Day\" and maybe \"Fancy\") are pleasant but don't really grab my attention the way those six do. For the bands effort, I'll give this album an 8, but quality wise it's about a half grade lower. Keep up the good work.\n\nSomething Else - 1967 Pye\n\nB\n\n(Very Good)\n\nBest song: Waterloo Sunset\n\nOne of the most astute things I've ever read on internet message boards was somebody's comment that the three main factors that draw people to songs and artists are (a) the music, (b) the lyrics and (c) the image. Now, obviously, (c) isn't going to be the main thing drawing people to this era of The Kinks, but one's attitude towards the relative importance of (a) and (b) is going to have a major effect on one's reaction towards this album. If (b) is particularly important to you when listening to The Kinks (and there's no good reason for this not to be the case, given what a good lyricist Ray could be during this time period), then you'd have a very good reason for this to be your favorite Kinks album. Ray's lyrics here aren't just among his best, they're (on the whole) some of the best lyrics I've come across on any pop album. Ray's mastery of telling stories and creating character sketches would never be better than this, and from this perspective the album should probably be a D or E.\n\nWhile I find Ray's lyrics intriguing, though, he doesn't reach deep down into my soul in such a way that that's enough for immortality. I don't quite reach the Starostin level of giving this a shockingly low grade (7/10), but I can sure empathize with his perspective. For way too many listens, this seemed to me like three monstrous tracks and a whole bunch of relative filler, and while that notion's mostly dissipated, I'm still not sold on this whole album. It also doesn't help that, while the album is actually pretty diverse, it manages to slam nearly all of the genres it takes on into the same twee Brit-pop mold, which is nice but a little hard for me to endure. The album cover shown above may be a nice powder blue, but my version of the album is a solid grey, and the album has that same monotonous feel to my ears even when I academically know that Ray and co. are taking on several styles.\n\nStill, monotony or no, this album is very nice. There are still some tracks I don't like; for instance, except for the cool \"Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun\" lyric, I find \"Lazy Old Sun\" close to an unlistenable mess (like with \"Fancy,\" I just can't buy this band trying to do any sort of psychedelia). \"No Return\" doesn't sound painful to me, but it does sound like two minutes of rambling nothing, and Dave's tune of longing, \"Funny Face,\" has a lot of elements that sound ok on their own but that don't really come together in a way I'd like. Oh, and \"Situation Vacant\" is a fun tale of a man's life getting ruined by his nagging mother-in-law, but aside from the chorus it's not very impressive. On the plus side, \"Harry Rag\" and \"Tin Soldier Man\" are fun forays into the world of British folk music and playful war marches; \"Two Sisters\" and especially \"Afternoon Tea\" are wuss-pop of a high level; and \"End of the Season\" is an atmospheric bliss that conveys the transition from summer to autumn fantastically. Oh, and let's not forget my favorite of the 'lesser' tracks, the Dave-sung \"Love Me Till The Sun Shines,\" a high-quality pop-rocker (which, for some reason that totally escapes me, George Starostin referred to as a \"weak ballad,\" which is odd given that it's neither weak nor a ballad) that adds a badly needed dose of up-tempo bliss to the middle of the album.\n\nThese all pale, of course, to the big three. The opening \"David Watts\" is twee Brit-pop par excellence; it may technically be a ripoff of \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" by the Stones, but ehn, the Stones were sorta ripping off The Kinks in the first place when they made that (excellent) album, so I'm not going to hold that against a song that's as cool a portrait of lower class yearning as this. The second song, the immortal \"Death of a Clown,\" is probably the best Dave-song in the band's catalogue, as it captures the timeless power and depth of the most profound moment in the history of television (I refer to, of course, the Chuckles the Clown episode of the Mary Tyler Moore Show) with a glorious melody and high-pitched harmonies that I could only imagine before hearing this. The best song of all, though, comes at the end in \"Waterloo Sunset,\" about a man who gains joy not from living his own life but from watching other people live theirs, and with another amazing melody to boot. I don't agree with the multitudes who would crown this as the band's best song (it wouldn't make my top 5), but it's amazing, right down to the twangy guitar tone that plays the melody in the beginning and the end.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I definitely don't agree with those who elevate this album to a plateau of immortality, but it's a great album nonetheless and one of the band's best, and a necessity for any collection. Just try to fight the initial urge to get bored and you'll be fine.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nTrfesok.aol.com (04/29/08)\n\nYes, with three classic singles on the album, I had high hopes for the rest of it. It's mostly a letdown, though. I think I like it even less than you do. There's some nice acoustic work on \"No Return\", a very touching lyric on \"Two Sisters\" (not one that'll endear the band to feminists, though), but the majority of it is very under whelming. I do like \"Fancy\", but \"Lazy Old Sun\" is clearly Ray trying to reach beyond his grasp. As is Dave, with \"Funny Face\". It sounds vaguely like he's trying for what the Who did better with \"Rael.\" \"Afternoon Tea\" borders on lounge lizard music. \"Tin Soldier Man\" sort of is a precursor to what would come down the line in a couple of albums, but not as good.\n\nOf course, everyone agrees about the singles. \"Death of a Clown\" is charmingly naive, especially Rasa Davies' \"la-la-las\"; anybody who was an ex-high school loser (yours truly included) can relate to \"David Watts\"; and \"Waterloo Sunset\" is touching. Still, these songs are on Kronilkles, so I would only recommend the rest of the album to more hardcore fans.\n\nThe Village Green Preservation Society - 1968 Pye\n\nD\n\n(Great / Very Good)\n\nBest song: The Village Green Preservation Society\n\nIn much the same way that Pet Sounds can be considered more of a Brian Wilson solo album than a proper Beach Boys album, this release can be considered more of a Ray Davies solo album than a proper Kinks album. Yes, Ray had always been chief songwriter and main vocalist for the band, but previous Kinks albums had significant input from Dave as well; he tended to bring in more traditional \"rocking\" values than Ray tended to favor, and he had his fair share of songs written and/or sung by him make it onto albums even as the band had squarely entered the realm of Brit-pop. Here, though, Ray takes almost complete control: every song on the album is attributed to Ray, and the only time Dave makes an appearance is on the relatively hard-rocking (it's not hard at all, but in the context of this album it feels like steel) \"Wicked Annabella\" (I'm guessing Ray nicked that riff from Dave, though). The rest of the album is almost entirely devoted to the Brit-pop vein Ray had largely mastered over the last two albums, but that's (needless to say) hardly a bad thing; this is (to my ears) Ray's overall peak as a melody-writer (there are NO BAD SONGS ON HERE), and he elevates the quality of his obsession with \"wuss music\" to a level that makes this a total classic. Many many fans of the band consider this the band's peak and one of the greatest albums of all time; seeing as it's currently in my top 100, I'm obviously not arguing too strenuously on the second point.\n\nYou know what, though? I'm not 100% sold on this album. This album starts off absolutely amazingly, but even if there's not a single bad song on here, this album still seriously runs out of gas by the end. Not only does this album stack the GREAT songs in the first half, leaving slimmer pickings for the rest, it even loses steam conceptually. This is a loose concept album about nostalgia, both for one's personal memories and for an olden-time idealized England (a time of village greens and steam-powered trains and innocence and whatnot), but past a certain point, the only continuations of this concept are topical rehashes of (superior, unfortunately) songs that had already come. And, well, the general monotony of the sound wears me down after a while. Dang it, people, diversity does matter. No, diversity alone can't make a weak album into a great one, and it can't make a great album into just a good album, but lack of diversity can take a potential all-time classic and nudge it ever so slightly out of the realm of ironclad immortality. I mean, I love the songs on this album as a whole, but this is (in the end) a much harder album for me to listen to than I'd want from an album that a decent number of people list as one of the 25 greatest of all time.\n\nIt can't be ignored, though, that the high points are jaw-dropping. The title track, aside from functioning as the album's \"mission statement\" (preservation of all sorts of elements of the \"good old days\"), has one of the smoothest flowing pop melodies I've ever heard, making it one of the two or three greatest songs ever written by a guy who wrote more than a few great ones. The band's ties to mainstream coolness are completely severed in this song (if there were any ties left), what with the lyrics and the lack of guitar and the dominance of organ (oddly enough, though, the loudest instrumentation in the song comes from the drums), but those of us who aren't cavemen can love this for what it is (and don't forget those cute faux-Beach Boys backing harmonies!): a close-to-perfect pop song. The followup, \"Do You Remember Walter?,\" is a wonderful musing of what happens when old friends grow old and boring, even as your memories keep them the same age forever. That it also has a pair of fantastic, perfectly complementary melodies is enough to make the song into a rock-solid classic.\n\n\"Picture Book,\" then, is another example of Ray's ability to take the dorkiest, hokiest ideas and do them so shamelessly and skillfully that they become totally enjoyable. Forget that the lyrics (about taking pictures to preserve the present for the future) are clever and the melody is impeccable; it also has parts like \"naaaah nah nah nah\" and Ray giving up singing \"normal\" lines at times and resorting to, \"uh scooby dooby doo.\" Normally, with most songwriters, I'd be reaming the writer for so clearly running out of ideas and releasing a work-in-progress as a finished song; in this case, I can just tip my hat to the way he makes the song so enticing from start to finish. Next up is \"Johnny Thunder,\" a song whose lyrical point eludes me (mostly because I can't figure out what \"Johnny Thunder lives on water, feeds on lightning\" means), but whose melody and especially whose chorus (those are some weirdly powerful \"baaaa ba ba ba ba ba baa\" backing vocals) are enough to make it a minor lightweight classic.\n\n\"The Last of the Steam Powered Trains\" is an interesting take on gritty, \"rootsy\" blues-rock, with Ray matching this ode to old-fashioned trains with a backing track that really does remind me of a train slowly rumbling down the tracks (until the part near the end where they speed things up and, for one glorious moment, the memory of the train going full speed is brought back to life). It's also the end of the album's stretch of impeccability; the tracks from here on out are all good, but almost all of them feel \"supplemental,\" if you get me. My favorite of this group is \"Animal Farm,\" an incredible (both lyrically and musically) ode to farm life, and both \"Village Green\" and the closing \"People Take Pictures of Each Other\" (topical rehashing notwithstanding) are outstanding examples of the band's prime style. Looking at the rest of the tracks, though, my general reaction is \"nice, but kinda quaint.\" \"Sitting by the Riverside\" has a nice French cafe feel to it, \"Big Sky\" is at least a better nod towards psychedelia than \"Lazy Old Sun\" was, and \"Phenomenal Cat\" is quiet softness done well, but the other tracks don't exactly awe me. They're nice and all, but aside from the already-mentioned \"Wicked Annabella\" (about a forest witch, I guess), I don't really consider them worthy of namechecking.\n\nSo as you can see, an E or F is out of the question for this album as far as I'm concerned. I dig the style, but I don't dig it that much, and as great as a lot of the songs on here are, the great songs only make up about half of the album. Still, half great and half good is worth a very very high grade, and it deserves a place in any respectable rock and pop collection.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (03/13/09)\n\nI do think that this is a tiny bit overrated, but it is indeed a classic pop album. The low-rent psychedelic cover photo is misleading, but the presence of a Mellotron on a bunch of tracks (particularly \"Phenomenal Cat\") does add somewhat of a spaced out atmosphere, even though most of the topics of the songs are relatively down to earth. The song \"Village Green\" was actually recorded during the sessions for the last album and seems to have been the starting point for the concept. But I don't think the concept is all that discernible, unless you think of the songs as snapshots of scenes around the village. Not that that matters, since, I agree, all of the songs range from pretty good to excellent. The title track is indeed the peak, but I also especially like \"Phenomenal Cat\" (clearly of the Cheshire variety!); \"Wicked Annabella\" (a perfect kids' fantasy about someone who was probably just a scary old lady little the kids would make up stories about -- nice big drum s, too); the two upbeat songs about taking photos. \"Monica\" sounds like it has a twinge of Latin influence, which really hadn't shown up much in white pop at this point. I'm a little less fond of the music hall styled tracks, but they are fun. \"Big Sky\" is pretty interesting lyrically -- Ray's musing about God, perhaps?\n\nThe CD which I came across actually has two versions of the album. First comes the 15 track version that you have, in a mono mix. There's also a stereo version, which I much prefer. The delineation of the instrumentation is much clearer. This is the version that was released originally in some parts of Continental Europe. However, it leaves off five songs (\"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains\", \"Big Sky\", \"Sitting by the Riverside\", \"Animal Farm\" and \"All of My Friends Were There\") and adds two others. \"Mr. Songbird\" is unbelievably upbeat and cute, even by the standards of this album. There's also a stereo mix of the gorgeous \"Days\". A lot of people seem to think that \"Waterloo Sunset\" is the ultimate Kinks single, but this one has it beat, I think. Melancholy and more mature, although I can see why Ray pulled it from the final version of the album -- it's a lot more pensive. The CD also tacks on the mono single mix, just for the heck of it.\n\nA number of other songs were recorded during the sessions, but left off because they really didn't fit in, either. The \"Wonderboy\" single is fun, but way too sarcastic. And \"Did You See His Name?\" -- a nice, upbeat jaunty tune - which ends with a suicide! Hardly a nice, nostalgic scene you want in your fantasy British village.\n\n*Arthur (Or The Decline And Fall Of The British Empire) - 1969 Pye*\n\nE\n\n(Great)\n\nBest song: Shangri-La\n\nOne thing that stands out about this album in relation to the last few is that it represents a fairly significant departure from the niche style the band had established for itself, culminating in the hardcore Brit-pop fest of Village Green. The sound is much heavier on guitars than it's been, and could almost be considered (if one is cynical enough) an attempt at a slightly generic late 60's classic rock album on the part of the band. If you're totally in love with the sissy Kinks, this album might not enthrall you as much as the last three. If you're like me, though, and admire and enjoy the band's output primarily for Ray's melody and lyrical skills (while treating the style as something that's cool but not the make-or-break factor), this album can be as enjoyable as its predecessors and maybe (as for me) even better. All of the raw skills demonstrated in the last few albums are still present, but they're crossed with a willingness to actually rock in a way that they hadn't since the garage rock days. The guitars are back in full force, and the songs are often much faster than anything the band had done in the past; when combined with the great melodies and riffs Ray was churning out on a regular basis, you have the foundation for one of my favorite albums of all time. Except for a little too much aimless jamming at the end of \"Australia,\" a slightly boring (not bad, just not crisp like the rest of the album) ballad in \"Young and Innocent Days,\" and the fact that Ray inexplicably takes on a goofy singing voice in large stretches of the album, there's very little to complain about.\n\nArthur, as can probably be deduced from the full title, is another concept album (the band wouldn't make another non-conceptual album for almost another decade), but it's much more developed and fleshed-out than the loose conceptuality of Village Green. Basically, it creates a parallel between the British Empire, which started out grand and all-powerful and finished as rather unremarkable, and a Brit named Arthur, who started off totally average (but with dreams of grandeur) and ... finished as rather unremarkable. The first side is Arthur as a young man (and the empire still in its prime), and the second side is Arthur as an older man who's lost the ability to advance particularly far in life (and the empire as a deflated spectre of its former self, one that would only continue to go down hill). If ever there was really such a thing as \"The British Dream,\" this album is about how that dream dissolved around and for the poor schmos like Arthur who grew up eagerly awaiting their piece of it, only to see it completely unrealized. This may seem fairly unremarkable, but let's face it; most concept albums either involve totally fantastical, otherworldly stories that have no direct bearing on everyday life, or bizarre, interesting things happening to people and changing them in a spiritual way. Arthur is one of the few albums to fess up to the notion that most people, frankly, are boring losers that let life happen to them instead of going out and living it, and that far too often the act of letting life happen to them means that pretty much nothing happens to them. It's disarming and unsettling, but it's something badly needed in rock music.\n\nThe opening \"Victoria\" takes us back to the glory days of the British Empire, when \"sex was bad and obscene, and the rich were so mean,\" and when the best thing one could do with one's life was to go out for a few years and fight for queen and country. It has some slower parts with stately horns, betraying that it's definitely late 60's Kinks that we're listening to, but it also starts off with and stays heavy on up-tempo guitar parts, complete with with Dave's charmingly out-of-practice attempt at a fast guitar solo, signifying from the start the band's recommitment to something resembling actual rock music. I still don't get the weird singing voice (though Ray's normal voice returns during the slow, \"Land of hope and glory-a, land of my Victoria\" part), but it's a classic. Then it's off to war with \"Yes Sir, No Sir,\" which smooshes a bunch of regal, militaristic themes into a rather goofy number about life as a mindless grunt (and immediately showing that the romantic thoughts of how wonderful it is to serve queen and country, alluded to in the opener, are a bunch of hooey).\n\nContinuing in the theme of war, we come to one of the finest ballads Ray ever wrote, and an easy choice for one of my five favorites from the band. \"Some Mother's Son\" further bursts the bubble of the nobility of being a soldier by reminding the listener of the actual humanity of casualties of war (and of the humanity of the mothers of those soldiers), something that warmongers seem overeager to ignore. It's particularly poignant for pointing out that every soldier on the battlefield was, at some point, a carefree child playing games underneath the sun; that a soldier in this song gets killed as a direct result of momentarily tapping those innocent memories is just another good example of what a sordid state of affairs war is. Whatever may be, the song is utterly stunning.\n\nMoving back to happier times in life, we come to \"Drivin',\" which is Ray's nod to the fun of enjoying life by wasting it in idle pursuits, even as rough things are happening all around in both your personal life and in the world at large. The melody's fun, and the harmonies are cute. \"Brainwashed,\" then, is Ray addressing both Arthur and the world at large, denouncing the way people way allow themselves to be subservient to 'the powers that be;' content with just a few things in life, just because they're too tired to fight back. More importantly, though, it's a song that would have sounded AWESOME had it been on the Clash debut album almost a decade later; that one moment where Dave taps into a brutally heavy guitar sound, bringing out all his (inevitable) frustration with having to restrict his pure rock instincts for so many years, is just breathtaking, and the way Ray's vocal melody plays around that sound (which is then mirrored by trumpets the next time it would have a chance to come back) in a way that merges perfectly with the rest of the song makes this a total classic.\n\nAfter the amusing-but-overlong 'advertisement' of \"Australia,\" which mimics the way Britain tried to make Australia seem the way western America was in the 1800's (the song is neat, but the jamming is just awkward, even if the excess of it ends up making it oddly alluring in the end), we come to the second half, where the cold reality of Arthur's life is hitting home. \"Shangri-La\" is my favorite Kinks song, and while it's the music that really brings things home for me, the lyrics hit me right in the places where I'm sure Ray was aiming. After slogging through the uptight British school system, after suffering through military service, after getting an 'honest' 'working-class' job, after generally being a good boy and doing all that he was told to do, his reward is ... sitting by the fire in a house that looks like everybody else's. And a mortgage he can't really afford. And a couple of small niceties, like a TV and a radio, that he has to finance. And zombie-like neighbors who all have the exact same lives he does. Sheesh, when Ray puts it like this, I can see why he really didn't want to get a job like everybody else. But forget the lyrics for as second; the music is INCREDIBLE, starting from the dark acoustic main theme, moving into a sad-but-less-depressing harpsichord-driven melody (that gets reprised at the end), momentarily climaxing with each chant of \"Shangri-laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,\" and then breaking into a bitchin' acoustic-theme that's propelled by Mick Avory's greatest stretch on drums. It's simply glorious, and its five-plus minutes feel like three.\n\nThe rest of the side can't hope to match this song, but it puts on a good show anyway. \"Mr. Churchill Says\" starts off kinda stupid for a couple of minutes (with Ray bringing out the voice from \"Victoria,\" which I guess is supposed to be a symbol of big government or jingoism or something similarly stupid in his eyes), but when the sirens start going off, an electric guitar theme pops up that rocks harder (in its distinctly 60's way) than anything the band had done (outside of \"Brainwashed,\" obviously) since Kinkssize/Kinkdom. \"She Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina\" is a fun music-hall romp about people coping with their pathetic lives by buying things they can't afford, and strangely contains my favorite stanza on the album (\"He's bought a hat like Anthony Eden's because it makes him feel like a Lord. But he can't afford a Rolls or a Bentley; he has to buy a secondhand Ford.\"). After the aforementioned \"Young and Innocent Days,\" we come to later in Arthur's life (\"Nothing to Say\"), when his kids grow up and he no longer gets to have them around regularly to ease the relative pointlesses of his existence. I would point out, by the way, that if you look at this track in the \"Decline and Fall of the British Empire\" light, this track also works as Britain's various colonies and protectorates breaking off and starting their own lives (I guess keeping the queen on their money is the equivalent of phoning on Father's Day and Christmas).\n\nFinally, we come to the title track, where Ray tries to make sense of what's happened with Arthur's life (through a wonderfully bouncy, anthemic tune). The key line of the whole thing, I think, is when Ray says, \"And your hope and glory has passed you by; can't you see what the world is doing to ya'?\" which largely absolves Arthur directly and puts the blame instead on Britain failing the little people even as it was failing itself in the world. For all of its criticism of Arthur for being a mindless sheep elsewhere in his life, the song is kind enough to suggest that, \"Arthur, could be you were right all along\"; even with the choices he made, he did not have to end up in the state he did, and would not have if Britain had held up its end of the contract it implicitly made with Arthur when he was busily being indoctrinated. Ray doesn't despise Arthur; he instead (kinda condescendingly) pities him, and loves him and wants to help him through. Don't ya know it, don't ya know it.\n\nI love this album, and my sincerest recommendation, if you're not familiar with the Kinks, is to make this and Village Green simultaneous purchases the next time that's feasible. Ray's conceptuality wasn't always very effective, and would largely be his downfall in later years, but on the last album and (especially) this album he was able to make a pair of gems. They show two rather different sides of the band, and while I slightly prefer this one (at least, in this case), both should be enjoyed regularly.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (04/13/09)\n\nHmm. I don't know if the Kinks ever produced a \"definitive\" album like Sgt. Pepper's.., Pet Sounds or Who's Next, but I can see why you'd pick this one. I like the more rocked out style, too, and the production is the best on a Kinks album up to this point. Since this was intended as a soundtrack for a TV movie that never happened, I would venture a guess that this is the most focused of Ray's concept albums.\n\nI think this also proves that Mick Avory was a bit underrated, particularly on \"Australia\". Like the previous poster, I don't find it too long at all. My only (minor) gripe is that the horns are bit intrusive, but they don't detract much. \"Victoria\" is a fun, boisterous single, but yeah., what's with that voice? \"Shangri-La\" does capture the shallowness of suburban life, from the point of view of someone in his 20's, which can seem stultifying at that age. \"Some Mother's Son\" is, I agree, very touching -- a protest song that isn't angry. My other favorite is the jaunty title track -- very catchy, contrasting with the rather depressing lyrics. On the whole, though, the album holds together extremely well.\n\nThe only thing that I don't really like about the album, is, as you mention briefly, the attitude of condesencsion that Ray brings to some of this. Sure, again, the 9-to-5 life would seem unappealing to an artistic type -- but what did Ray offer as an alternative? What's better about the sex-alcohol-rock and roll lifestyle? It looks like Ray was complaining about that, too, a few albums down the road. I'm not sure Ray ever got down to the issues in any sort of existential way. If he had, maybe he wouldn't have repeated himself quite so much.\n\nTrung Doan (trungtamdoan.gmail.com) (01/13/12)\n\nI really would like to write a detail essay on why this album is not only deserve a 10 but is a serious contender to best album of all time and I will eventually do that on a later date when I have the time.\n\nHowever this comment will just focus on a mostly overlook aspect of this album A lot of the reviews of this album mostly focus on the lyrics and the concept. Most of the reviews doesn't really focus that much on the music itself and in particular Dave Davies guitar playing.\n\nHowever to me, I find the musical arrangement to be top notch and probably the best I have heard in a pop album. Also this album also convince me that Dave Davies is an all time great guitarist and I hold this album as the benchmark for guitar playing in a pop album. Seriously any guitarist in a pop group should listen to this album. The fact that Dave Davies isn't recognise as a great guitarist shows how limited people define great guitar playing. I only seen Dave Davies been credited of pioneering the power chord with You Really Got Me and All Day and All of the Night but nothing much after that.\n\nNow why do I say that.\n\nJust listen to the last song, the title track Arthur.\n\nDave Davies is playing lead guitar for the entire song. Most other guitarist would have started with the guitar riff in the intro and then go into basic strumming and appegios throughout the verse and chorus. Maybe a few licks and fills in between the vocal phrase. However Dave Davies created a distinctive melodies throughout the song that is distinct and separate to the vocal melodies. You can listen to that song and ignore the vocals and you can follow the melodies of the song purely by the guitar playing. Is it only me that finds what he plays during the chorus to be absolutely outstanding? It's also very catchy and complex melodies that Dave Davies is playing.\n\nNot only is their a distinct guitar melody throughout the song that is catchy in its own right but it's gels and harmonises well with the vocal Ray Davies is singing.\n\nTo me this is absolutely mind blowing as it's hard enough to create a catchy vocal melodies, it's even harder to create a catchy guitar melody. It's doubly hard to be able to do both and make it gel with each other without one melody interfering with another.\n\nTo me this is a pretty unique style of guitar playing. I don't see many guitarist who has that ability (although maybe that reflects that my music collection is still small and incomplete and I'm happy if someone can show me other examples of guitarist who can do that). Mostly they show off by having a set instrumental break/guitar solo or create lead parts in between the vocal phasing. Only Tom Verlaine from Television with the album Marquee Moon (\"Venus\" comes to mine) and Graham Coxon from Blur (''This Is A Low' and 'Country Sad Ballad Man' in certain parts and it's clear that he is a disciple of Dave Davies anyway) comes close to match Dave Davies ability but even then he wasn't fortunate enough to have an all time great singer songwriter in Ray Davies to play off with. I'm even tempted to say it's revolutionary (although I'm no expert in 60's rock) as i haven't heard that style of guitar playing beforehand. Even listening to Hendrix, I couldn't see any continuous guitar melody that harmonises the vocals there. The closest I can think of is Carol by The Rolling Stones but even then, the lead guitar was played in between the vocal phasing . Again feel free to point out another guitarist who does that before Dave Davies but even if there was someone who did it beforehand, I find it unlikely that they did it as good as he did in this album\n\nDave Davies also demonstrate this ability throughout Yes Sir, No, Sir, Nothing To Say and Brainwash as well. Really this ability came out of no where as Dave Davies never shown this ability before this album or afterwards.\n\nI'll say that if you have a bias towards the anti-guitar hero philosophy of guitar playing that the role of the guitarist is to support the songwriter and bring out the emotions of the song and that your ideal guitarist is more Johnny Marr and Graham Coxon rather than Jimmy Page. Than I'll posit that this album would absolutely be heaven for you because throughout this album even when he is not taking the guitar harmony aspect. As he really fills out the song with his intricate fills and licks, and downright catchy melodies or just really nice sounding appegios. With this album he becomes the king of the anti-guitar heroes for me and he achieved that status even before that terminology became in vogue (the anti-guitar hero status mostly referred to post-punk bands).\n\nI'll eventually write back and give a song by song analysis but for now I just leave that that this album is a combination of exceptional songwriting with brilliant melodies mixed with brilliant lyrics and being combined with exceptional guitar playing and great arrangements. It's the type of album where if you stripped down to basic arrangement, the melodies and lyrics are strong enough to sustain the song whilst simultaneously if you remove the vocals and just listen to the arrangement, the arrangement would just be interesting to listen to on its own. To me that is what perfection in music is about.\n\nAnthony Golding (toneechestnut.googlemail.com) (10/13/15)\n\nAs an Englishman nearing his eighties living alone and occasionally hearing from his two boys taking on the world , this album can bring me to tears ( I spent three years in the British army) as he captures the suffering of the working man. And as that includes most of us I find its one of the few albums from the sixties that attempted to present the existential feeling of its listeners, though it gets more poignant as one ages. Personally to avoid becoming totally like Arthur I periodically adventure off to the likes of Australia , but one always has to return.\n\nLola Vs. Powerman And The Moneygoround, Part 1 - 1970 Pye\n\n9\n\n(Good)\n\nBest song: Lola\n\nA HUGE step down from Arthur, but the bar was set so high by that album that this is still very good. While the change in style that went with Arthur was necessary to make that into an immortal classic, I can't help but think that Ray and the band somewhat mortgaged its future and soul through that move. The slight lean towards arena rock tendencies (and away from the band's greatest strengths) that worked so well on Arthur is even more pronounced here; while there were enough great ideas in those songs to make them work, here the tend towards genericism is compounded by a tend towards songwriting laziness, and the two working together really hurts things. There are some great songs on here, but there's a lot of material on here that's neither very inspired nor very inspiring.\n\nIt's tempting to say that Ray was focusing more on the lyrics and concept than on the music when making this album; the problem with this is that the lyrics and concept aren't that impressive either. The general idea of the album is that a group of musicians start out as a struggling band, write a #1 single (Capn' Marvel theorized that \"Lola\" itself is the big #1 single of the fictional band, and I have to say that that makes a lot of sense), make it big and come face to face with the soulless machinery that is the music industry (in the end realizing that it's not the money and fame that matter, but rather the people and places they care about). I'm not sure that this was a topic that was routinely broached by musicians way back in 1971, but it's hard not to look at it as awfully cliche, especially when the execution of the topic makes it feel at times like a half-baked musician bio-pic (\"Ray, I gotta tell you, we think you're onto something very big here. Nobody's ever combined transexuality and big major chord changes before! Lola is a smash. You better start thinking about a follow-up, my friend. Right now!\"). The tracks on Arthur still had a heavy dose of cleverness in their character sketches, but there's an awful lot of banality leaking out of this album.\n\nFor all these weaknesses, though, there are some very good songs on here. \"Lola,\" of course, was the band's first big Big BIG single since \"You Really Got Me,\" and it's a well-deserved classic and easily the best on the album. On the first side, the other (minor) highlights are \"Strangers\" (a largely acoustic ballad marking the return of Dave Davies, with some effectively haggard vocals that make the simplistic lyrics work better than they could otherwise) and \"Get Back in Line\" (a nice ode to working class angst in the \"pre-hit\" portion of the album, which gets draggy in places but has some lovely moments). On the second side, I'm very fond of the catchy return-to-vaudeville jaunt of \"The Moneygoround\"; it's shorter than it reasonably could have been, but what's here is a lot of fun. The last three tracks of the album are even better; \"Apeman\" is a catchy-as-hell longing for a \"primitive\" life (while also acknowledging that, for all of the technology around us, we're really not as sophisticated as we think we are), \"Powerman\" is a driving guitar-fest about a big powerful music executive (my favorite music on the album aside from \"Lola\" is the 'chorus' melody of \"It's same old story, it's the same old dream, it's power man, power man, and all that it can bring.\") and \"Got to be Free\" is a fun song with pianos and banjo where (I guess) the protagonist breaks out of the shackles of the industry and finds happiness in his original life. Frankly, I have no emotional investiture in the concept of the album (especially by the end), so it's nice that I'm able to enjoy this as much as I do for 'pure' musical reasons.\n\nThe other tracks aren't bad, they're just kinda bland and unexciting to my ears. The one track that serves as a frightening harbinger of what was to come later is \"Top of the Pops\"; not only is this track a clear case of Ray writing lyrics first and then coming up with a melody for them second, it also features a main riff that sounds an awful lot like a simple variant of Louie Louie, as well as a second riff that's basically the melody to Land of a Thousand Dances with one note changed. Otherwise, though, there are a lot of songs (both in the 'rocker' and 'ballad' areas) that sound moderately ok when on and leave absolutely no lasting impression with me once they're done. If you hang on every word and note that Ray and Dave can offer (Dave has a second contribution in the distorted-guitar laden Rats, and it has an ok riff but not much else), I can kinda understand; as is, with the Kinks having come into my music education pretty late, I don't care enough to give these tracks yet another listen to try and dig something out of them.\n\nIt's rather disappointing to me that Ray could crash so much within the course of a year; if this album didn't have Lola on it, the grade would be noticably lower. There are fine songs here, yes, but they're coming in about 50/50 with the ok-or-worse ones, and that's not something I can really ignore. If you're starting up a Kinks collection, this should not be near the beginning; if you have to have Lola on an album right away, get The Kink Kronikles.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nLangas de los Langas (putolangas.hotmail.com) (06/01/08)\n\nHi, John. Just listened to this record for the very first time. I agree that is below Arthur, but I liked some songs on this first listen (I especially admired the opening 'The Contenders', which you don't even mention).\n\nBut anyway, it's not the album I want to talk about. It's Lola. L-O-L-A, Lola. My God! I hadn't listened to a song so catchy, yet so brilliantly asembled in years! It's been in my head for the last three days, I'm starting to get worried it won't ever go away.\n\nThere are so many things I admire about this song. Here are some of them:\n\n1 - It's one of those strange songs which have a verse that is so damn catchy that a chorus in itself. So the real chorus (\"Well we drank champagne and danced all night\", etc.) sounds more like a bridge that puts the song together and leaves you waiting the exact time for the next brilliant, catchy verse; and the brige itself (\"I pushed her away...\" which surprised me me on a first listen, as I was not expecting a new melody) is great, short, and flows perfectly into the next verse.\n\n2 - The lyrics are, at least, risky. And I don't mean the subject, but the rhyme. Writing a whole song based on the word \"Lola\" in English is strange at least without sounding like an ass (in Spanish it would be a piece of cake), but Ray pulls it off pretty well.\n\n3 - That little guitar riff in the codas, that introduces the third verse and the bridge.\n\n4 - And, above all, the structure of the choruses. It's simply perfect. The main voice starts on a low melody in the first verse; in the second one, it is accompanied by a soft upper harmony. In the third, fourth and fith, the harmony dissapears and there are two voices singing the same melody, with an octave between them (adding a fiery tone in the fifth that makes it different). Quite usual to this point; but here is where Ray kills me, singing the sixth verse only with the harmony (from the second verse) as the main voice, and finally in the seventh, the harmony and the high melody; so, all possible combinations have been used, and the listener hasn't had the chance of getting bored for a single second. Man, I LOVE this song.\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (04/13/09)\n\nAs with a number of other Kinks albums, I heard a few of the tracks years before hearing the whole album: \"Lola\", of course; the followup single, the hilarious \"Apeman\"; and its B-side, \"Rats\", a really good hard rock song that sounds like, of all things, a precursor to Aerosmith's music. The rest of the album is, as you say, quite inconsistent, especially when compared with the last album. If it is a concept album, than it's a sham. It's like Ray said, \"Well, I have a song called 'Lola', another one called 'Powerman', and another one called 'The Moneygoround'. If I string the titles together, I'll have a concept album\". Sorry, Ray, no go. Most of the songs have nothing to do directly with this anti-music industry concept, especially Dave's.\n\nLeaving that out, the songs are mostly pretty good. Throughout the album, Dave proves that his high harmony vocals were an important part of the distinctive sound the Kinks were developing at this point. \"The Contenders\" leaves no real impression, and I find \"Get Back in the Line\" dull and its lyrical message a bit ambiguous. \"Strangers\" is a bit too redneck for me, but still OK. The music industry attacks are vicious and do work, especially \"Denmark Street\". Elton John's \"Bitter Fingers\" deals with the same subject in the same locale during the same time period. Between the two of them, we have to conclude that Denmark Street must have been a very nasty place! \"Powerman\" has a really catchy riff. \"This Time Tomorrow\" and \"A Long Way From Home\" are lovely, touching ballads. \"Got to Be Free\" sort of rehashes the \"Apeman\" theme in a more serious way, but it's decent.\n\nDespite the weak spots, the high points make it a good enough to make it the next stop after the previous two. The version I have is the remaster, which adds the mono single mix of \"Lola\", which changes \"Coca-Cola\" to \"cherry cola\" (at the insistence of the BBC); and versions of \"Powerman\" and \"Apeman\" recorded very early in the sessions. The latter sounds very different from the final version, lacking strong harmony vocals and with much louder lead guitar parts. I guess they redid it to make it sound more like \"Lola\" so they would have a second single.\n\nSoundtrack From The Film \"Percy\" - 1971 Pye\n\n7\n\n(Mediocre / Good)\n\nBest song: Moments\n\nThis is a soundtrack to a film about a guy who receives a penis transplant, and while going the soundtrack route might have provided top-notch results once for Ray (Arthur), here it just sounds like a mess. It's reasonably diverse, but all that means is that fairly uninteresting and pointless instrumentals (what exactly was the purpose of this instrumental version of \"Lola?\") are interspersed with ballads that are way too drenched in sap and perfunctory orchestrated melodrama. The melodies are usually reasonable, but the presentation is way below the standards that Ray had established for himself.\n\nThe opening \"God's Children\" (which made Kink Kronikles and is usually considered the album's best track) is decent, but while Ray may completely be earnest about the point he's trying to make lyrically in the song, he doesn't do a great job of making me care thanks to the relatively low ratio of substance to attempted anthemic power. Still, the substance is there somewhat, and I feel at least a small twinge when listening to it. A few tracks later comes what I consider the real highlight of the album, the nice organ-laced ballad \"Moments.\" If nothing else, the part where Ray sings, \"Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry\" is the strongest hook of the album, and this in conjunction with the slight Dylanish growl (for lack of a better word) in Ray's vocals is enough to give this song the nod. Oh, and the last full song of the album, \"Willesden Green,\" is notable for Ray handing over vocals to bassist John Dalton (who takes on a very Elvis-like tone in his voice), so even if the lyrical message is largely the same as on \"Village Green,\" I'm able to forgive it due to the novelty.\n\nBut the rest, ehn. The only real standout is \"Animals in the Zoo,\" and that's mostly because I can't help but focus on how much it sounds like an alternate version of \"Apeman\" (I know, it's a different melody and has different lyrics, but it has the same feel as \"Apeman\"). Everything else works as background music but nothing more, and that's way below the standard I hold the Kinks to. In short, there's a good reason that (last I checked) this still hadn't officially been issued in the US, and even a serious Kinks fan shouldn't pay full price for this. Heck, I'm probably overrating it.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nKink Kronikles - 1972 Reprise\n\nD\n\n(Great / Very Good)\n\nBest song: Mr. Pleasant or Big Black Smoke\n\nI never recommend getting a compilation for a band prior to getting one of their real albums, but were I to make an exception, this would be the one. It's a FANTASTIC 2-disc retrospective of the band's peak period, mixing 1 disc's worth of a solid greatest hits compilation (I find it awfully befuddling that \"Fancy\" made it instead of \"Rainy Day in June,\" and that \"Get Back in Line\" made it instead of \"Powerman,\" but the choices are hard to dispute otherwise) with a terrific 1-disc collection of failed singles and awesome B-sides and other rarities. It's one of the few compilations I know that really does, to call up a cliche, work for new and veteran fans alike. Since I've covered the album tracks sufficiently already, I will be focusing on the more obscure material.\n\nIt really amazes how the band apparently didn't learn its lesson over the first three albums and continued to leave so many great songs off of its albums (especially since Face to Face and Something Else each had some obvious dross as candidates for replacement). Had the four weakest tracks on F2F been replaced by the four representatives here of that album's bonus tracks (a fifth representative from those sessions, \"She's Got Everything,\" wasn't among the bonus tracks, and it's just as well seeing as it's not that great), for instance, that album would have been an easy E and probably would have knocked Arthur from its perch as my favorite Kinks album. \"Dead End Street\" is an amazing look at the hopelessness of life as a poor person with no prospects for improvement, with well-placed \"Dead end!\" chants in the chorus and a great melody that brings out simple-yet-effective lines like, \"What are we living for? Two-roomed apartment on the second floor. No chance to emigrate, I'm deep in debt and now it's much too late.\" \"This is Where I Belong\" is the finest rebuttal (musically and otherwise) I can imagine to the rock cliche of \"we gotta get out of this place\"; the line, \"I won't search for a house upon a hill. Why should I when I'd only miss you still, for this is where I belong ...\" has more meaning to me than the entire dribble of the worst 70's RCA albums. And the other two, holy hell. \"Big Black Smoke\" (the B-side to \"Dead End Street\") is one of the best combinations of catchiness and darkness in the band's whole catalogue (about a girl who grew tired of her life and ran off with somebody who ended up setting her house on fire with her and her child in it), and \"Mr. Pleasant\" (the A-side to \"This is Where I Belong\") takes Ray's music-hall obsession (much more potent here than on \"Sunny Afternoon,\" even if that is the better song over all) to an unprecedented level of goofy magnificence. I am quite sure that nobody else in the world could have written \"Mr. Pleasant\"; nobody else would be willing to say \"to hell with dignity\" quite to the extreme that was required to write and record this song.\n\nThe Something Else tracks aren't as amazing as that quartet (except for \"Autumn Almanac,\" a catchy-as-hell multi-part song about living in one place forever and enjoying its monotony enough to not really want to leave), but they're ok. The Dave-sung \"Susannah's Still Alive\" can't hold a candle to his best SE contributions (and doesn't even have any moments on par with the best ones in \"Funny Face\"), but \"Wonderboy\" and \"Polly\" are character sketches that are at least on the same level as the average material of the main album. Of the three Village Green tracks, one is a slight duffer (\"Did You See His Name?\"), but I would have been perfectly happy seeing the mellotron-laden \"Berkeley Mews\" knock off \"Monica\" or the acoustic-driven \"Days\" knock off \"Starstruck.\" And finally, there's the two Arthur-era tracks, which of course wouldn't have fit in well on that album (where the conceptuality was very tight), but are both very good nonetheless. \"King Kong\" gives a good rocking punch to its lyrics about how great it is to be a societal bully, and the Dave-penned \"Mindless Child of Motherhood\" is a fine bit of social (I guess; if it's a song to a woman who scorned him, then it's a bizarre one) critique.\n\nAnd that's it; as an outtakes collection, this album would rate at least a B, and when combined with the already-known tracks that make up the remainder, a boost to D seems pretty automatic. The only reason I don't give it a higher grade is that I'm wary of giving grades higher than D to compilations; the Past Masters comps and Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy are special cases because those are specifically singles compilations, whereas this is just a very high quality period retrospective. Whatever the rating, though, it's absolutely essential.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\ntrfesok.aol.com (03/13/09)\n\nLike a lot of people, this was my first real introduction to the Kinks' second phase, and it's indeed excellent. If you're willing to take the time to do such a music-geeky thing (like me), programming this in chronological order is most illuminating, tracing the group's rise, and unfortunately, getting a tiny glimpse of their fall.\n\nJust some random thoughts:\n\nI don't quite get why you don't like \"Fancy\" when you do like \"See My Friends\". The lyrics are less straightforward, but the Indian style music is still really gorgeous.\n\n\"This Is Where I Belong\" has very touching lyrics, almost like McCartney period Revolver.\n\nI can see why they left \"She's Got Everything\" off of F2F. It's a fun song, but it sounds more like first phase Kinks. Here (as on a number of other songs), Mick Avory sounds somewhat like Keith Moon.\n\nI think \"King Kong\" was recorded after Arthur had already been released. It improves over at least one song on Lola.. (the boring \"Get Back in the Line\") and maybe should have been put there.\n\nI actually like Dave's songs quite a bit, with his weird off-kilter voice and equally weird lyrics. \"Mindless Child of Motherhood\" -- a very striking phrase, but it's a little hard to figure out what he means.\n\n\"Willesden Green\" is the low point and really should have been left out. I don't really like the redneck music, and the vocal (which, supposedly, is John Dalton, not Ray) is horrible. If this is what the next studio album is like, I'm not sure that I'd like it.\n\nHowever, that's only one dud among classics. The only other beef I have is with the sound quality -- it's lacking. A number of songs are still in low grade mono mixes, and on a whole, it sounds like they just took the LP masters for the CD's. It doesn't detract that much from the classic status of the music, but this really deserves to be reissued, properly remastered, with optimum sound.\n\nMuswell Hillbillies - 1971 RCA\n\nB\n\n(Very Good)\n\nBest song: 20th Century Man\n\nThis is one of those albums that becomes a lot more impressive when you actually sit down and think about what's being accomplished on it. The initial reaction to this can easily be along the lines of, \"Whoopie, Ray's doing generic hick music\" and just leaving it at that; if this is the case, some significant level of disappointment is pretty much inevitable. Closer inspection, though, reveals that the \"generic hick music\" of this album is actually 'generic' ragtime and Dixieland music done by a jazz-band version of the Kinks and featuring lyrics that combine (a) hardcore Britishness, (b) sketches of middle-to-lower-class British life and (c) paranoia about and disdain for modern life and bureaucracy. None of these elements are original on their own, but the combination of them is completely original. Furthermore, as suggested by the title, the album essentially works as a bridge between the rednecks of the U.S. and the \"rednecks\" of Britain, sorta making this into a \"cultural unifier\" or something similarly pretentious (or at least would be if the feel of the album was so thoroughly not so).\n\nThe major classic, of course, is the opening \"20th Century Man,\" where Ray expresses his life philosophy more effectively in one line (\"I'm a 20th century man, but I don't want to be here\") than he would in his hours of obsessive rants on the subject over the next 20 years. The lyrics are hilariously paranoid and Libertarian (see: \"I was born in a welfare state, ruled by bureaucracy, controlled by civil servants and people dressed in grey. Got no privacy, got no liberty, 'cos the 20th century people took it all away from me\"), but they manage to entertain instead of annoy in this case, and they work very well with the music itself. The song starts off with kind of a Band-ish country flavor to it and builds into a strong organ-and-guitar rocker, and Ray mixes up his vocal delivery well, ranging from a kinda proto-Knoplfer low-pitch grumble to his classic screaming style by the end. It's arguably the best song of the post-Kronikles era, and it's definitely the best song-length crescendo in the band's catalogue.\n\nNone of the rest of the album rocks quite as hard as the opener does in its most intense moments, but that doesn't make it much less enjoyable. \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\" would be a throwaway with any other set of lyrics; as is, the fact that Ray decided to put this kind of paranoid rant to this kind of New Orleans-y music makes it a minor classic. \"Holiday\" features Ray singing with a cigar in his mouth to make the song seem more 'authentic' as a 20's number, \"Alcohol\" is a dark cross between generic 20's jazz and some rather interesting 'mystical' folk (I guess; I'm sure there's a better description for it, I just can't think of one), and \"Complicated Life\" is such a fun singalong that I can completely forgive the total genericism of its Dixieland melody. All of these songs could be dismissed, but they each have something extremely interesting going for them, and that's good enough for me.\n\nMost of the rest of the songs are at least slightly more removed from the \"hick\" nature of the others, and should satisfy even fans with an allergy to such styles of music. My favorites are \"Skin and Bone\" (about a woman who went from fat to way way too thin), \"Have A Cuppa Tea\" (a weird cross between 'normal' Kinks Britishness and gospel that makes Tea close to divine) and the title track (a fun anthem where Ray happily declares his status as a British hick), but the others are all at least ok (except for \"Uncle Son,\" which kinda passes me by every time). In particular, \"Here Come the People in Grey\" is a fun and disturbing generic rocker that delves into Ray's fears that The Bureaucracy Is Coming To Get Him, and \"Holloway Jail\" is at least notable for Ray's voice sounding (to my ears, anyway) more than a bit like Neil Young's in places. Not a great track, but certainly a decent one.\n\nThere's a couple of other tracks I didn't mention, and they're not bad either (I just couldn't think of anything to say about them). The main overall point that I want to get across is that, while not bursting with obvious classics, this album has a style and feel to it that's as interesting as almost anything else in the band's catalogue, and that alone is enough to make this a very worthwhile listen. It's not an all-time classic by any means, but it's definitely in the band's top 5, and that means it's great. If you have to get into 70's Kinks, start here.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nEverybody's In Showbiz - 1972 RCA\n\n9\n\n(Good)\n\nBest song: Celluloid Heroes\n\nEssentially a sequel to Muswell Hillbillies style-wise, this is largely Ray's \"life as a touring artist is so hard, please pity me\" concept album. It's somewhat disregarded in the band's canon as a whole, but it's not an enormous step down from its predecessor, and it's definitely miles above the next few albums on the whole. Essentially, this is Ray's last album before he ceased to be the Ray Davies that we'd come to know and love, and that should at least mean something.\n\nA couple of the songs follow the MH formula a bit too closely, and they're not so great. \"Maximum Consumption\" is basically the exact same melody as \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoid Blues\" and has the same lyrical theme as \"Skin and Bones\" (centered on Ray instead of a girl named Annie), and \"Look a Little On the Sunny Side\" is sooooo over-the-top simplistic and hokey that it just doesn't really work. \"Unreal Reality\" also follows the formula kinda closely, except for a big-band intro and outro that sounds awfully awkward, and the song doesn't impress me much either. A couple of the songs that could have been from the MH sessions are a lot of fun, though: \"Motorway\" does \"leisurely folk-pop made really hyper\" very well, and \"Hot Potato\" is a delightful romp featuring Dave proclaiming his passionate love for ... potatoes.\n\nThe other five songs, except for the totally throwaway Dave-song \"You Don't Know My Name,\" are just fine, and more than enough to ensure this album a 9. The opening \"Here Comes a New Day\" dwells on road fatigue, and Ray is smart enough to set the lyrics to a peppy horn-laced guitar-pop song; it really gives the impression of the artist being mentally fatigued, but totally laced on caffeine (or more illicit substances) and able to face the day because of it. \"Sitting in my Hotel\" is a lovely musing of whether or not living the life of a rock star is really worth it; I find it most interesting for the way it focuses on his lifestyle would look to his friends, who would look at the shallow extravagance of it all and laugh and, \"would all be saying that it's not really me ... would all be asking who I'm trying to be.\" Melody-wise, it's probably the prettiest ballad Ray had written since Arthur, and that says something.\n\n\"Supersonic Rocket Ship\" is a playful diversion that shows the nice sense of humor that Ray would completely lose in the next few albums, with nice light touches of what almost sounds like a ukelele and a fun melody with lyrics about how wonderful life on the ship would be. On the other side of the spectrum is the big epic of the album, the closing \"Celluloid Heroes,\" which was clearly written with the intent of being the best of this collection of songs and which actually lives up to this attempt. It's a musing on the immortality of movie stars and other notables via the inscriptions of their name in the sidewalk of Hollywood Blvd., and somehow it works as a march through the history of cinema and all the ups and downs of everybody who had struggled for fame. For all the pomposity of the lyrics (and they are pompous; come on, Ray is taking it upon himself to write THE big treatise on what it means to be a musician or thespian seeking fame and glory), the melody really manages to carry things impeccably; it's freaking beautiful, and frames the lyrics perfectly.\n\nSo that's the studio half. This album was actually a double (now on one CD), and the live album that makes up the other half is ... interesting, if a little unnecessary. Aside from a couple of odd choices of older material (boo to \"Top of the Pops,\" yay to \"Brainwashed\"), it consists of runthroughs of Muswell Hillbillies tracks and Ray messing with the audience by singing 45 seconds of \"Mr. Wonderful,\" a minute and a half of \"The Banana Boat Song\" and two minutes of \"Baby Face\" (the last track is just the audience singing the coda to \"Lola\" for two minutes). It's interesting if nothing else for the way it shows that Ray had a bit of a Dylanish way of messing with his audiences at this point; I mean, I doubt that the average person coming to the performances captured on this album had this much interest in hearing MH material, but here it is. Ah well; it's also interesting to hear Ray's bizarre interactions with the audience, and to hear the Big Band version of the group live.\n\nSo there's the album; not great, but certainly quite good, and a decent close to the first half or so of the band's career. Believe me, things were about to go really bad.\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nPreservation Act 1 - 1973 RCA\n\n4\n\n(Bad / Mediocre)\n\nBest song: No\n\nThere's a fairly cliche science fiction storyline that goes something like this: there's an alternate universe that has all the same people as this dimension, but has them living different lives than us and with different personalities than us. A portal opens up between the two dimensions, somebody passes into our world and immediately causes this world's version of that person to vanish from existence. Only after killing the alternate universe version of the person, or sending him back to his own world, can this world's version of the person return to existence, allowing everything to return to its normal state.\n\nI bring this up not because it has anything directly to do with the subject matter of this album, but because this is the only rational explanation for what happened to Ray in the leadup to this album. Ray Davies, as we have grown to know him, is not the Ray Davies who shows up on this album and its successor; oh sure, the obsession with simple life and village greens and fear of progress that is largely the foundation of this is nothing new, but never before, not even in the very earliest days of the group (which at the least beat the snot out of this in the fun department) had Ray sounded this unremittingly incompetent. Maybe this album shouldn't be rated lower than the debut on an 'objective' basis, but screwups on this level deserve extra ire.\n\nSome background: Ray had originally hoped to release a full-version of Preservation all at once, but apparently pressure was put on him to release an album well before he was going to be finished (or before he even had a plot mapped out), so he had little choice but to put this out as a stopgap. Now, when you're looking to make a rock opera, there are three critical elements: music, lyrics and plot. In order to be successful, you need to do well on at least two out of the three; Preservation, on the other hand, fails in all three. There is no plot here; Ray decided to instead treat this as a series of character introductions, but where Ray had previously succeeded so marvelously in coming up with character sketch tracks, here he comes up with nothing interesting to say about anything or anybody related to this world of his. This of course brings us to the lyrics, which tend to feature Ray presenting \"ambiguous\" lines to give listeners something to puzzle over (for instance, he resurrects the persona of Johnny Thunder) even though he himself didn't know where the hell he was going with his story. The rest of the time they're just bland and irritating.\n\nAnd the music? Do you really think Ray would bother to take care of writing good music for this? Of course not, he was too busy focusing on the lyrics and the story! Which also sucked! The only moment on the album that even remotely rocks is the opening (on CD; it wasn't part of the original album, but was a lead single of sorts) \"Preservation,\" and that's only because Ray steals a guitar line from \"Purple Haze\" so blatantly that it drives me nuts. The only tune that's reasonably pretty is \"Sitting in the Mid-day Sun,\" and that's only because he decided to so blatantly steal from \"Sunny Afternoon.\" Yeah, I know that thievery is something that's unavoidable in writing rock and pop music, but when you steal from your betters (including yourself at a better time) you have to make at least some sort of effort to distract from the theft. If you don't, you severely decrease the chances of the listener going, \"boy, that's a neat twist on a familiar idea\" and increase the chances of them going, \"Gah! Why did he steal the line to 'Purple Haze??!!'\"\n\nThe rest of the album is not pretty and does not rock. Sure, it doesn't regularly jump out of its way to be ugly or ear-splitting, but I almost wish it would; it would alleviate the loooong stretches of boredom. There are problems afoot when a pure musical-style song about Cricket is arguably the best of a bunch of tracks; the rest has no good riffs and no pretty melodies, simple as that. If you can enjoy Kinks music without these two elements, then you'll swallow anything that Ray Davies puts to tape; as for me, I only have love for Ray's creations when he meets my requirements. When he doesn't, screw him.\n\nAnd lo, Act 2 was on the horizon ...\n\nSend me your thoughts\n\nNicholas Jones (nicholasdavidjones.gmail.com) (05/13/12)\n\nYou could not be more wrong about this album....\n\nPreservation Act 2 - 1974 RCA\n\n5\n\n(Mediocre / Bad)\n\nBest song: When A Solution Comes\n\nSo I guess I should say something about the plot for this whole Preservation nonsense. In the previous album, we were introduced to two prominent men, Mr. Flash and Mr. Black. Mr. Flash is a big evil capitalist who first destroys the Village Green by making it modern and mechanized, and then (prior to this album) somehow leverages that into being head of the nation (I think). Mr. Black is ostensibly the \"champion of the people\" who ends up (by the end of this album) overthrowing Flash (with the help of the \"people's army\"), but then crushes all individuality and suppresses freedom and all that. That's ... basically it, and done in an incredibly banal way too. The only thing that makes the plot discernable is the presence of multiple narrative breaks courtesy of an \"announcer,\" and the narrations are so devoid of any sense of irony or humor (Ray was taking this stupid plot seriously) that they do nothing positive for the album. It should also be noted that the unintentional comedy level on this album is through the roof at times: in particular, I'm thinking of the dialogue of \"Flash's Dream\" (this is how my mind wants it to go: \"Flash, this is your soul. Stop touching yourself.\" \"It is my soul!\"), but there are a lot of other cringeworthy moments as well.\n\nI have to admit, though, that this album starts and ends rather strong (which is definitely more than I could say for Act 1). \"Introduction to Solution\" and \"When a Solution Comes\" are both very different from anything the band had done before, and they're awfully good for it. They're both rather dark and have their own goofy kind of anthemic power, giving the songs the kind of apocalyptic flair that would be suitable for a better album of this ilk. \"When a Solution Comes\" is especially enjoyable, as it shows Ray going for a gloomy Roxy Music-style (especially in the second half) kind of decadent atmosphere that builds off the opening downbeat guitar lines very well. The closing \"Salvation Road,\" which is the anthem of the people's army and which becomes the national anthem after Black takes over, is a high quality semi-grandiose up-tempo acoustic number that (I guess) works in a way like \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" did on Tommy. If nothing else, these songs reveal that Ray's talent wasn't completely gone overnight.\n\nThe rest, though .. ugh. Ok, there are a couple of songs that kinda work (the cheese-fest \"Mirror of Love\" is a nice bit of jazzy balladry, and \"Money Talks\" is a fun bit of dorky rock), but they only work on a guilty pleasure level, and the rest loses the \"pleasure\" part completely. I just cannot find these songs enjoyable; they're not hideous, but they're full of the same ever-present stench of boredom that sank Act 1. There's not enough solid material here to fill a single album, let alone a double, and thus it's impossible to give this a much higher grade than its predecessor.\n\nYou know, this whole Preservation mess really makes me appreciate Tommy and Quadrophenia that much more. Tommy had a dippy plot, yes, but it was a clever dippy plot, and it had a ton of great riffs and pleasantly low-key instrumentation. Quadrophenia was kinda overblown, but its storyline is the polar opposite of simplistic and banal. I mean, the second half of that album isn't even a \"story\" in the conventional sense; it's just Jimmy walking along the beach having a bunch of flas"
