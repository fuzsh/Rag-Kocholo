Once the Internet started transforming the progressive part of the planet into one global village, though, it suddenly turned out that practically every pop-music-related site of serious merit thinks it his duty to include a little personal shrine to these guys. The Kinks are not esoteric knowledge - that honour should probably go to someone like the Frogs or the United States of America (the band, I mean, not the country) - but theirs is a weird phenomenon nevertheless, as most people fall into one of the two categories: (a) those who have never even heard the name and (b) those who consider the band to be among the top ten all-time musical greats of the XXth century, if not the greatest band to ever exist. There's precious little in between, and I'm not sitting on the fence either, firmly joining group (b).\n\nYes, the Kinks were phenomenal; they just had a nasty history of doing the right things at the wrong time, and just as often doing the wrong things at the right time. In terms of invention and experimentation their most creative period happened to fall upon the early years of 1964-66, yet whenever they tried something new, somebody \"better equipped\" would always run in front of them and do it (or pretend that he did it) better, be it The Beatles or the Who. And when the Kinks finally settled into a groove that was practically impossible for anybody to recreate on the same level - that is, created an absolutely unique musical style of Brit-pop which NOBODY could pull off with the same effectiveness - they did it in defiance of the musical fashion of the times, which led to their being basically written off as dull British pop freaks. C'est la vie - if you choose to ignore the trends, it's fruitless to expect immediate rewards. It would be somewhat far-fetched to praise the Kinks for \"stark realism\" when opposed to their colleagues; I'd personally say that it wasn't until at least the late Seventies that band leader Ray Davies turned into a true stark realist, substituting liberal art for liberal propaganda, and that, not coincidentally, was when the band's music began to truly stagnate. \"Real life\" with all of its ugliness shocked and alienated Ray just as much as it did the rest of his colleagues. But instead of joining the crowds and seeking spiritual escape in the Summer of Love, hippie ideology, mysticism, marijuana and Woodstock, Ray Davies sought for salvation in more humble, grounded subjects, such as afternoon tea, village green, old people taking pictures of each other, and Waterloo sunsets - in other words, traditional Victorian values. A little idealized, of course, as he himself understood fairly well (and whoever doesn't see the deep irony in songs like 'Victoria' is definitely unfit to listen to the Kinks at all), but not any more idealized than, for instance, the doctrines of Eastern philosophy were for the hippie crowds. In return, their records simply didn't sell, and much of the press branded them as retrograde conservatives (even if in reality, it's hard to find a more liberal rock musician than Ray Davies, that is, if your understanding of liberalism goes beyond formalized cliches). To this one should add an unfortunate ban on live performing in the US, caused by some stupid skirmish on a particularly bad day and active for much of the Sixties, which, of course, didn't exactly do wonders for their States popularity. But luckily, time heals all wounds - and as it turned out, the Kinks' musical legacy has lived up to time. Besides (and because of) having influenced probably hundreds, if not thousands, of pop bands, Ray and his brother Dave Davies have, all of a sudden, been discovered to have written a fairly good amount of truly timeless tunes. Just one good look was all it took. Now, stepping away from any socio-political implications, what truly distinguishes the Kinks' music from the other typical stuff produced by the British Invasion is certainly the very special way in which Ray Davies writes his compositions. And no matter what genre he prefers - be it early rock'n'roll rip-offs, sweety ballads, clever introspective Brit music, rock opera or heavy metal - he always has his own insignia printed on every song. What you might call it is beyond me. I call it 'childishness'. His elementary chord sequences, sweet soothing voice and funny, but (let's face it) naive lyrics convey this atmosphere of childish delight. That's what helped such a terrible lot of people consider Kinks' music crappy simplistic bullshit; but it also helps their music still stand out proud and loud, as fresh and sincere as it ever was. Today, most people are afraid to follow the same pattern - afraid of being ridiculed for not being smart, sarcastic, and ambiguous. Not that they don't have good reason: it's a real tough job to sound \"childish\" and not come out as \"ridiculous\", a job that, in my humble opinion, could only be successfully performed at the right time (the Sixties) and through the right people - with Ray Davies as the rightest of all the right people, of course. Two more things are mentionable here, both concerning Ray's skills as a lyricist. First of all, he may be the only serious 'no-nonsense' songwriter in rock music. Like I said, his songs are always straightforward, sometimes to the point of seeming too simplistic; that was just the schtick, though - to show that true art could be different from both the psycho wordgames of Dylan-like songwriters and the majestically pompous, but meaningless phrase combinations of the likes of Pete Sinfield. In later years, this could lead to terrible onslaughts of banality and self-repetition; but during the good days, Ray's ability to put it simple short and short while avoiding all the pitfalls was second to none. Second, beginning from Arthur, Ray has devoted his entire self to one subject: the problem of interaction between the individual and society. Individualism is the main theme that runs through a good two-thirds of the entire Kinks' catalogue, whether it be in a serious, contemplative form (Arthur), dressed in black humour (Muswell Hillbillies), or somewhat naive (Ray's mid-Seventies' rock operas). Again, one might find it uninspiring to see the same subject being milked for an endless amount of times (geez, bureaucracy must have really gotten on Ray's nerves), but, on the other hand, this contributes to Ray's image as the greatest humanist in rock'n'roll. True humanism is extremely rare in rock: being humanistic is usually considered either too banal or too unhip. And this also explains why lots of Kinks records didn't sell at all: setting aside the public's interests, Ray just presented his own 'little man's' panorama of ordinary life. Primitive? Banal? Grotesque? Derivative? In a certain sense - yes, although none of these epithets should be taken in a derogatory sense here. But in any case - oh so unique... Unfortunately, the fact that Ray and Dave stayed together through the 70's and 80's, dragging the band's name through a set of very, very mediocre, very, very monotonous, and very, very predictable albums, helped somewhat wash up their reputation. But even in that murky epoch they could sometimes come up with a goofy sort of success - like with 1979's Low Budget, for example. This sorry stagnation, along with several other factors (such as the lack of a \"purely perfect\" album), prevents me from revering the Kinks on quite the same level as the Big Four That Get Five, but they're almost up there, and while I'm usually being moderate about exploiting the \"genius\" tag, Ray Davies is one of those few artists who'd get this tag from me without a second question. If you're not overfamiliar with the Kinks, lemme just tell you they burst out on the scene in 1964 - which is a lil' bit later than the Stones but a lil' bit earlier than the 'Oo - with the following line-up: Ray Davies - rhythm guitar, lead vocals, lead songwriter, too; Dave Davies (younger brother) - lead guitar, sometimes lead vocals (thank God, not too often), sometimes songwriting; Pete Quaife - bass guitar; Mick Avory - drums. Of the latter two, Pete quit the first (by 1970 he was already replaced by John Dalton, who in turn was later replaced by Andy Pyle, who in turn... Jesus Christ, well, you know what I mean). Avory stuck around throughout the 70's, but somewhere around 1984 he called it a day and was replaced by Bob Henrit. Occasional keyboard players also joined the band, like John Gosling in the 70's and Ian Gibbons in the first half of the 80's. But overall it's Ray and Dave that do most of the work and are the biggest Kinks around.\n\nGeneral Evaluation:\n\nListenability: 5/5. Ray Davies hasn't been called one of the greatest songwriters of all time for nothing.\n\nResonance: 4/5. A total 5/5 for the early days, but brought down by too much straightforward and blatantly corny material afterwards.\n\nOriginality: 4/5. At times, Ray and company could be almost defiantly derivative, but still, wasn't it the band that pioneered both hard rock and Britpop almost at one time?\n\nAdequacy: 4/5. Again, much of the Seventies' stuff is so unabashedly pretentious that I just have to cut 'em down a bit...\n\nDiversity: 5/5. Together with the \"great triad\" of the B and the RS and the W, make out one of Britain's most original bands.\n\nOverall: 4.4 = B on the rating scale. A very strong four, almost a five. Maybe a real five. Don't take it to heart.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nALBUM REVIEWS KINKS\n\nYear Of Release: 1964\n\nRecord rating = 4\n\nOverall rating = 8\n\nYour average garage-band album - which is the synonym for 'random crap'.\n\nBest song: YOU REALLY GOT ME, of course - nothing else even comes close.\n\nTrack listing: 1) Beautiful Delilah; 2) So Mystifying; 3) Just Can't Go To Sleep; 4) Long Tall Shorty; 5) I Took My Baby Home; 6) I'm A Lover Not A Fighter; 7) You Really Got Me; 8) Cadillac; 9) Bald Headed Woman; 10) Revenge; 11) Too Much Monkey Business; 12) I've Been Driving On Bald Mountain; 13) Stop Your Sobbing; 14) Got Love If You Want It; [BONUS TRACKS:] 15) Long Tall Sally; 16) You Still Want Me; 17) You Do Something To Me; 18) It's Alright; 19) All Day And All Of The Night; 20) I Gotta Move; 21) Louie Louie; 22) I Gotta Go Now; 23) Things Are Getting Better; 24) I've Got That Feeling; 25) Too Much Monkey Business; 26) I Don't Need You Any More.\n\n'Rock bands will come, rock bands will go. But rock'n'roll will go on forever.' This statement certainly applies to the Kinks' debut album - sure enough, there's a lot of rock'n'roll here, but where's the rock band? The songwriting is next to none, and when it's there, it's mostly primitive. The playing is nowhere above average, and when it is, it's Jimmy Page who's playing guitar. The production is murky, too, courtesy of the legendary Shel Talmy, unquestionably one of the two most hated thugs in rock business (together with Allen Klein). In all, a fascinating listen.\n\nDon't be too quick in reaching for the stones. The problem was a rather standard one: the band was just starting, the producer was cramming them with horrible second-rate material, and, first of all, Ray wasn't yet confident about himself. There is one absolute gem here - the rave rocker 'You Really Got Me', often hailed as the first hard rock (read: heavy metal) song. Actually, it was the long-expected hit single that made the Kinks famous overnight - it shot to #1 as an arrow, and the band were rushed into the studio to cash in on its success, just like the Animals were rushed in on the wave of 'House Of The Rising Sun'. Problem is, the Kinks just didn't have the Animals' chops or the Animals' self-assuredness or even anything vaguely approaching the Animals' stunning image: the Kinks were just one of the hundreds of average British rock bands that accidentally happened to fall upon a new, rich, innovative sound. Accidentally, as legend has it that Dave Davies actually hit upon that guitar tone while absentmindedly poking his amplifiers with a needle... needle? heh heh heh. Anyway, 'You Really Got Me' is a hell of a great song. It has a nice, even though primitive, five-note riff - the first heavy riff in history, it builds up well and includes a mad one-string solo by Dave who complemented the grumbling riff by a deserving, chaotic instrumental passage. Oh, where would we be without that needle today? But don't just think of the song as a rough beginning, only important from a historical point of view: even today, the riff sounds completely fresh and invigorating, and the song strikes me as far more 'heavy' than ninety percent of these goofy hair metal bands or these equally goofy \"post-grunge\" outfits who want so much to sound 'heavy' but sound nothing but miserable. In a certain way, together with 'House Of The Rising Sun', 'You Really Got Me' was the most important number one single of 1964, and the one that really set the things happening... but not on this album, unfortunately. At least we should praise Ray Davies for including a whopping six original compositions (one in collaboration with Jimmy Page) on the album - at an epoch when even the Stones only dared to include one. Unfortunately, the poor young boy overestimated his forces. The instrumental composition 'Revenge' is ridiculously atrocious; chaotic harmonica lines and boring simplistic riffage don't make a good tune (besides, isn't it merely based on fidgeting with the melody of 'Cadillac'?). 'So Mystifying' is never even mentioned by reviewers, and for darn good reasons: it took me some time, but I finally got it - the song's a total rip-off of Bobby Womack's 'It's All Over Now', a song which Ray certainly heard in the Stones' version and immediately cloned, changing the vocal melody in the chorus a bit (instead of 'it's all over now', they chant 'girl you're so mystifying') and adding far clumsier lyrics. 'Just Can't Go To Sleep' is oversweetened and unbelievably clumsy - goddang that Ray who can't even fit his lyrics into the rhythm and has to sing 'every night I just can't goat sleep'. The harmonica-driven 'I Took My Baby Home' is slightly better; actually, if we prefer to disregard the song's obvious debt to 'Fortune Teller', it comes across as a tolerable ditty, with vocal harmonies akin to those of The Animals (I'm referring to the 'whoa-whoa-whoa' refrain, you understand). It still reeks of Herman's Hermits, tho', so the only serious original composition, besides the obvious 'You Really Got Me', is Ray's stuttering ballad 'Stop Your Sobbing' - a true Kinks classic (well, \"semi-classic\") and one of the band's best attempts at imitating the Beatles' sound. Even so, the riff of that one is stolen from Phil Spector (who based about half of his songs on it, to be fair). And the covers? Well, the biggest problem with the covers is that Dave Davies takes lead on too many of them. Now I must say that, while Ray has got one of the most expressive voices in rock music, it took him some time to realize its full potential, and none of these songs are able to woo you with the sheer power of his tone, as would be possible with songs like 'Sunny Afternoon' or 'Autumn Almanac'. Much too often, he sounds bleak and dull. But no matter how bad he sounds on this debut album, the voice of his younger brother makes him comparable to Pavarotti, Shalyapin and Maria Callas all at once. I apologize beforehand, but Dave simply sounds like a rabid alcoholic in between two fits of vomiting. Add to this that the covers of 'Beautiful Delilah', the blues ode 'Long Tall Shorty' and the stupid R'n'B rave-up 'I'm A Lover Not A Fighter' feature some pretty average musicianship, and you'll end up really thinking twice about ever putting this record on. It's all the more amazing how in just a few years Dave would finally master his voice and turn in a few decent performances ('Death Of A Clown', 'Rats', etc.); judging by these tunes, he's totally hopeless. The cover tunes on which Ray takes lead vocals aren't much better, either. Chuck Berry's 'Too Much Monkey Business' and Slim Harpo's 'Got Love If You Want It' (oops, sorry, that one's sung by Dave, too, only he's not so obnoxious) are okay. Not brilliant by any means - you'd be much better off with the originals, as the Kinks cannot hope to make these songs their own. They are no Stones and they are no Animals. They can't. Please forgive them. They hadn't yet figured out what to do. They were young, exuberant and reckless. They were even given two songs by producer Shel Talmy, one of which sports the title 'Bald Headed Woman', the other of which sports the title 'I've Been Driving On Bald Mountain' and both of which suck ass (sorry; I'm not the one to use rude words all the time, but there are cases where it's impossible to restrain oneself). They made a thoroughly embarrassing record and didn't give a damn. And please don't worry if you don't see it in a record store. The early Kinks market - the real early Kinks market - is in singles. Recently, I finally managed to get hold of the recent Rhino re-release - an essential purchase nowadays, as it complements the original album with twelve bonus tracks, almost a mini-LP of its own worth. Unfortunately, first time around these tracks date from some really early sessions and can't serve as a reliable counterpoint for the weak original LP as, say, the essential bonus tracks for Kinda Kinks, so I don't feel it is really necessary to pump up the rating because of them. The two absolutely necessary tracks here are 'It's All Right', the flip side to 'You Really Got Me', and 'All Day And All Of The Night', the successful follow-up single. 'It's All Right' is a groovy, kinda grim rocker with a solid upbeat rhythm, impressive harmonica fills and a cool nasal vocal delivery from Ray, plus there's a trademark chaotic section in the solo and unexpected changes in tempo, making this a somewhat complex composition for this period. And 'All Day And All Of The Night' is basically just an absolute re-write of 'You Really Got Me', clearly oriented on further cashing in on its success: the riff has been increased to nine notes instead of the former four, but all the other things stay in place, including the verse structure (quiet line - loud line with backing vocals - rip-roaring chorus), the obligatory one-string chaotic solo and the abrupt ending. Nevertheless, if you love 'You Really Got Me' (like me) and can't get enough of it, the track is a must. I also somewhat favour the fast rocker 'I Gotta Move', because I've always loved a simple, memorable, solid acoustic riff propelling a song. And the previously unreleased alternate take on 'Too Much Monkey Business' kicks the original right in the guts - it's at least twice as fast and exciting! Why they didn't put this fast version instead of the slow one totally baffles me, seeing as they don't do that many playing mistakes on the fast take. And, just for fun, the previously unreleased 'I Don't Need You Any More' sounds exactly like the Dave Clark Five - probably the band's one and only attempt to cop the unabashed \"happiness\" of the \"Tottenham sound\", with its upbeat guitars and joyful, ecstatic, interweaving vocal harmonies. Not half bad, but it was probably a good thing they never tried something like it ever again. Let the DC5 cop the Kinks, but don't let it happen vice versa. The rest is dismissable. There's their first single, a feeble version of 'Long Tall Sally', for some strange reason set to the melody of 'Lucille' - was this a hidden attack on Little Richard indicating that all of his songs are the same? Anyway, they recorded that one in haste after they'd learned of the enormous success the song has gained when popularized by Paul McCartney, but Ray is no Paul when hurling out the vocals, and the single predictably and understandably flopped. Then there are some more early, primitive Beatlesque singles like 'You Still Want Me' and 'You Do Something To Me', plus a late 1964 EP in its entirety. It also sucks in its entirety: the cover of 'Louie Louie' (a song that was next only to 'Too Much Monkey Business' in its British coverage; but why is Davies marked as author in the liner notes?) drags without any energy at all, and tracks like 'I Gotta Go Now', with the title representing the only lyrics throughout, as far as I can remember, or the ridiculous 'Things Are Getting Better', don't do much honour to the Kinks. So sorry. Anyway, pretty few people will argue that twenty-six tracks on an album is worse than fourteen: so if you really really dig early Britpop in its entirety, with its flaws and excesses, feel free to raise the rating of this album as much as you would like to.

Major point in question: an absolute majority of the songs on this album are originals, something that wasn't yet quite the norm at the beginning of 1965. Not that Ray's attitude towards songwriting has changed all that much: he still views \"pop songs\" as two and a half minutes of simplistic teenage love sentiment, a long way to go to reach his \"socially conscious\" heights of the mid-Sixties. Same goes for Dave, except he's not much of a sentimentalist (you try to be a sentimentalist with that kind of voice now!) and sort of compensates for Ray's occasionally superfluous sap with occasionally superfluous raunchiness. His presence on the album is still rather inadequate, and Ray hasn't yet projected his superior dominion over the rest of the band; but he's slowly getting there.\n\nOne of the overall nice things to say is that, since by now they didn't have Jimmy Page kicking around anymore, they had little choice but to try and improve in the playing department. In general, the guitars sound a heck of a lot more interesting and entertaining; there's more diversity, as they successfully add acoustic-based tracks to the mix as well as combine different kinds of sound (like the brilliant mix of hard 'You Really Got Me'-type power chords with gentle Byrds-like jangle on 'Tired Of Waiting For You'). And the other thing is that the melodies are getting more interesting as well, not to mention more original: no more stealing and disguising, independence and creativity are on their way. Much of this stuff is still rough and crude, but it's safe to say that on each and every one of his compositions, Ray is at the very least trying to put his own distinct mark. 'You Really Got Me' might have been great in terms of sound and raw energy, but it's more or less universally understood that Ray's melodic skills always shone the brightest on the ballads; in accordance with that, the most striking songs on the original Kinda Kinks album are unquestionably 'Tired Of Waiting For You' (their third hit single) and 'Something Better Beginning'. Still a bit underarranged and underproduced (although the former is questionable for those who like it sparse and minimalistic), they're simply gorgeous. Easily the most gorgeous thing about them is Ray's singing. Obviously untrained, obviously unprofessional, obviously a little shaky and uncertain, obviously so much in violation of the general unwritten rules for pop singing - where did that come from? No way they'd let a singer like this ever break through the MTV walls of our time. Yet it is this exact kind of vocal delivery that goes best alongside these semi-developed melodies. I've already mentioned the trick combination on 'Tired...'; as for 'Something Better Beginning', after the intriguing \"guitar-as-wedding-bell\" intro, it dupes you into thinking it's simply gonna be one of those generic sugary Tin Pan Alley send-ups, all sweety romantic guitar chirruping and unmemorable atmospheric vocal cooing, and then it sends things right into the next dimension with the '...is this the start of another heartbreaker - or something better beginning?' chorus. And you're like, 'Wow! This guy's got class! I now give a solemn oath that I won't stop buying all of this band's albums right up to Phobia!' And you're gone forever. What else is new on the waterfront, Mr Postman? Well, Mr Postman also brings you a great Beatlesque rocker called 'Come On Now', the one where Dave Davies finally squeezes some convincing excitement out of his raspy set of voices, with extra assistance by means of weird female backing voices... female? Hmm. (I get a funny feeling the main riff is borrowed off 'I Feel Fine', although I hardly could prove that in court; I guess judges only rely on funny feelings when it comes to outlawing things like homosexual marriages). Dave also perfects his vocal cords on the hilarious boogie 'Got My Feet On The Ground' which is enjoyable for its highly... err... politicized lyrics. In other words, it's a brawny braggartish ditty which pictures Dave as a self-assured young Mod, quite unlike the future personal songs by brother Ray who would never picture himself as a strong or self-assured person. And yes, Dave somehow manages to pull it off decently - unlike the horrendous cover of 'Naggin' Woman' where he once again plays the part of a dying junkie; due to his powerful vocal cords, the song ranks among the worst offenders in the entire Kinks' catalog. The rest of the album doesn't look all that wonderful, but still most of the songs are an improvement over Kinks. Even if quite a few of these ballads are rather feeble, and Ray's overreliance on Beatlesque moods and tricks doesn't speak in his favour, they're still cozy. 'Nothin' In The World Can Stop Me Worryin' 'Bout That Girl' has a title that's about six or seven words too long, but it's interesting to see this purely acoustic, moderately dark solo turn from Ray, lending a whiff of introspectivity to the entire record. 'Wonder Where My Baby Is Tonight' (the one clear rip-off on the album, borrowing its piano stomp from Marvin Gaye's 'Can I Get A Witness', like so many other songs of its generation) and 'You Shouldn't Be Sad' are routine pop filler which can nevertheless become endearing after a few listens. Ah well, too bad the band's only hope for quality control came disguised as Shel Talmy. Let us, however, not forget that in early '65, the LP was still little more than a musical dustbin for leftovers and filler for most pop bands; which makes it all the more important to get this album in its present form - the Rhino CD re-issue with almost as many bonus tracks as there are on the album itself. These tracks, most of them former single A- and B-sides or only found on obscure EPs, could so far only be located on compilations like Kinkdom or Kinksize or whatever they used to issue back when being a true Kinks completist was a job reserved for oil magnates and media bosses. Today, they're all happily gathered in one place, and their conglomeration actually trumps the album itself. I need only mention 'See My Friends', for instance, which is so far the first example of an Indian-influenced drone I've managed to uncover in rock history. So it doesn't have an actual sitar, but the guitars sure sound a heck of a lot like one, and it was indeed the outcome of Ray's visit to India, so there's no coincidence. The relaxed, static, lazy character of the song might also own a wee bit to the Byrds and their brand of \"unhurrying\" folk-pop, but the Byrds were one hundred percent \"western\" in mid-'65. The Kinks, as it turns out, were not. And again, Ray's highly personal, oh-so-friendly vocals fit the atmosphere to a tee, making this one of the most outstanding compositions of the year. But there's more to it. One of the band's most energetic rave-ups ever in 'Everybody's Gonna Be Happy'. One of pop music's greatest pleads for \"release\" - 'Set Me Free', more exercising in the 'You Really Got Me' guitar sound but this time set to serve the needs of a gruesomely broken heart; that riff, coupled with Ray's complete desperation, practically invents the \"power ballad\" concept long before Jimi Hendrix put it to modern use with 'Little Wing', and way longer before the genre became so miserable through the evil deeds of arena rock/hair metal bands of the Seventies and Eighties. (You can find a real arena-rock version of the song on the live album To The Bone, where Dave 'embellishes' it with a few metallic guitar solos, and find out with surprise that the song loses none of its charm through that. It's all in the writing, man, all in the writing). There's the irrepressible catchiness of the repetitive, but never annoying 'Such A Shame'. There's Ray's initiation into the world of the Average British Commoner: 'A Well Respected Man' is the well respected bearded grandfather of all things social-Brit-pop related. Written nowhere near as breathtakingly as Ray's later successes (it would be much improved a little later when re-written as 'Dedicated Follower Of Fashion'), it's still interesting if only for historic reasons. I'm not going to name everything, or we might never get around to 1966, so I'll just finish by saying the only bonus track that doesn't really appeal to me at all is 'I Need You', simply because it's the third direct re-write of 'You Really Got Me/All Day And All Of The Night', and the least exciting of the three, because it somehow managed to lose the cocky aggression of the lucky pair while at the same time retaining their primitiveness, and primitiveness without aggression is like sophistication without Rick Wakeman. It's a good thing they stopped after the third one; a less talented band in their place might have spent the rest of its life churning one remake of 'You Really Got Me' after the other, as long as there still were unused three-note sequences in the world. On the positive side, the album gets a wonderful, moody conclusion with 'I Go To Sleep' - a previously unreleased demo recording of just Ray sitting with two fingers on the piano, weaving a simple, mournful melody that never materialized into anything \"bigger\". For the better, perhaps.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nTHE KINK KONTROVERSY\n\nYear Of Release: 1966\n\nRecord rating = 6\n\nOverall rating = 10\n\nEdgy.

You know why? Because of the opening chords. Most people would probably call the Kinks' take on Sleepy John Estes' 'Milk Cow Blues' generic, passable, and forgettable, but that ain't what you call perspective. Adding perspective would mean that it's the only song on the album that sounds \"that-a way\", and maybe the only song in the band's entire repertoire, too. Maybe it was like a conscious attempt to outstone the Stones - you know, full force concentration on one goal. They still get something different as a result, but that's the best of it. In any case, no Kinks album ever had that kind of bizarre start to it.\n\n'Milk Cow Blues' is crisp, dry, and as threatening and insinuating - for its time - as any garage classic from Nuggets. Even Dave's singing, normally one of the harder spots in your everyday life, fits it to a tee, and then there's the guitar assault which shows that the younger brother had been adding quite a bit of practice to the already overlapping spirit. For me, this is unquestionably the Kinks' highest point as competent R'n'B-rockers. From the subtle opening chuck-chuck-chuck guitar/bass interplay to the chaotic climaxes, it's all there. By the end of 1965, the Kinks were all set to outmatch the Pretty Things as Mother England's bloody wildest band. But then you hit upon the next eleven tracks and nothing of the sort happens. It's as if they finished recording the song, played the last chord, and then Ray said, 'okay, that's it. Now we're through with being rock stars and we're gonna concentrate on recording my misanthropic introspective ditties\". 'Milk Cow Blues' did remain in their live set for quite some time, perfect hellraiser as it is, but very little on the album sounds anything like it. It's all pop - half of it still hearkening back to the past, the other half boldly looking forward to the future. \"Kontroversy\" indeed. (And while we're at it, might I be right in suggesting that the album's title is a veiled hint at the first delicate rifts in Ray's and Dave's overall strategies?). I think the signs of \"rock star stress\" are already beginning to show in the album's big hit single. John Lennon always used to say that about 'Help!' (the song) - how, on the surface, the song's desperation might seem just a standard pop simulation of the \"she loves me, she loves me not\" type, but how it was actually quite a real thing, masked with a poppy sheen. Something similar could be said about 'Till The End Of The Day'. Here the lyrics are... well, it's probably best said in Michael Aldred's original liner notes: 'Ray's lyrics are very simple, to the point of being basic. They mask the complex characters that evolve them.' Empty promotional phrases, to be sure, but also - quite coincidentally - quite true. The basic contrast is between the minimalistic, superficially-happy words - 'baby I feel good, from the moment I rise, feel good from morning till the end of the day' - and the voice that sings them. And the music that guides 'em. Like, it's a song that more or less continues the distorted onslaught of 'You Really Got Me', but it's no longer a re-write. It's much more melodic and it's got subtle mood changes and Dave's solo is no longer a spontaneous barrage of one-string garage notes but cleverly constructed and soaring to high-pitched ecstasy levels. And Ray does not seem to be feeling so good at all - on the contrary, he sounds like someone standing with his back to the wall, no place to hide. That's the song's main attraction. Maybe \"you and me we're free, we do as we please\", but I, for one, get visions of armies of people in grey enclosing \"you and me\" in a tight ring, equipped with a pair of straightjackets. Why else would Ray be sounding so miserable? If anybody's still in doubt about the double entendre of the big hit, there will probably be no misunderstanding when it comes to the single's B-side. 'Where Have All The Good Times Gone' is Ray's first, and easily one of the best (at least, freshest) attempts at a direct social statement. It's clear that the man has done some extensive Dylan listening, like all good English lads in 1965, and that listening gone and done him real good. The melody is simple, folksy, unassuming, and catchy, just like Bob would like it, and the vocal delivery is snappy, poisonous, and uncompromising. 'Daddy didn't have no toys/Mommy didn't need no boys' - goddammit, Raymond Douglas of X-Ray fame, why the hell aren't you writing lyrics like that any more? The scepticism gets carried over to the lazy, apathetic 'The World Keeps Going Round'; musically, it's still in the old ballpark (sloppy, slow garage-rock), but lyrically a direct precursor to everything from 'Sunny Afternoon' to 'Sittin' By The Riverside'. A nice trick is included when they quiet the song down to almost complete inaudibility and then end it with an unexpected bang - not really necessary from a, um, philosophic point of view, but nevertheless indicating that they're still interested in technical experimentation as well. And although 'I'm On An Island' formally is about lost love, there's no fooling the audience: by now we certainly know the real reason you're planting yourself on an island, Mr Davies. Not to mention that the song's pseudo-innocence, naivete, and playfulness invite plenty of associations with 'Apeman', which wouldn't come out until four years later and would be about anything but lost love. In contrast, it's pretty funny to see Dave try his hand at introspective songwriting. At this point, the best he can squeeze out of himself is 'I Am Free', a derivative, musically primitive \"anthem\" whose oh so exaggerated cockiness stands so much at odds with the deeper, subtler vision of older brother. Maybe he was just envious of the Stones who'd already proclaimed their freedom in a song called 'I'm Free' at the time. Or envious of elder brother who was suddenly discovered to be writing songs that weren't about girls. Whatever be the circumstances, Dave sure had a long long way to go - not that 'I Am Free' is particularly offensive or anything, but it does look hopelessly amateurish to me. That said, what with all the progress, the Kinks were still standing with one foot firmly jammed in the past, and the better they get at their new style, the blander they look when doing the \"old\" stuff. Who the heck needs so-so rockers like 'Gotta Get The First Plane Home'? It was marginally better when it used to be called 'Everybody's Gonna Be Happy', but why leave us with an inferior version? The 'makes me wanna si-hi-a-hi-high' harmonies on 'When I See That Girl Of Mine' are cute, but they're so nineteen sixty-three, if you know what I mean. And while 'It's Too Late' is catchy and you can tap your foot and everything, something inside me tells the real reason they recorded it was to satisfy producer Shel Talmy's wish to play some guitar on a Kinks album and make history. They do land one achingly pretty acoustic ballad - 'Ring The Bells' - but it's anti-climactic position right after the smoking 'Milk Cow Blues' has always prevented me from enjoying it fully. The bonus tracks on the new Rhino edition don't really alleviate the situation. Of course, 'Dedicated Follower Of Fashion' is a timeless classic, a marking time single - proudly announcing that Ray has started his full-time job as the chief herald of socially-oriented Brit-pop - but two other tracks are just alternate mixes and one other, 'Sittin' On My Sofa', looks like a pointless blues jam trying to mask as an actual song. (I'd bet you anything that's Nicky Hopkins on piano out there, though, still very much in his 'Ox' mood, fresh from playing with the Who on their debut record). Maybe they should have spared a couple of the better bonus tracks from Kinda Kinks. Looks like a pretty discriminative situation to me. Still, when all is said and done, Kontroversy doesn't have any really really bad songs on it, and that's a plus - it's one thing to have forgettable, but agreeable filler, and another thing to subject the listener to cruel unstandard torture ('Naggin' Woman'? Anyone up for another take on 'Naggin' Woman'?). The Kinks have completed their arrival, and they have just finished unpacking their skills. With the next record, the real game would be about to begin.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nFACE TO FACE\n\nYear Of Release: 1966\n\nRecord rating = 9\n\nOverall rating = 13\n\nThe first truly timeless Kinks' album, and their first venture into the world of Great Britain.\n\nBest song: SUNNY AFTERNOON\n\nTrack listing: 1) Party Line; 2) Rosie Won't You Please Come Home; 3) Dandy; 4) Too Much On My Mind; 5) Session Man; 6) Rainy Day In June; 7) A House In The Country; 8) Holiday In Waikiki; 9) Most Exclusive Residence For Sale; 10) Fancy; 11) Little Miss Queen Of Darkness; 12) You're Lookin' Fine; 13) Sunny Afternoon; 14) I'll Remember; [BONUS TRACKS:] 15) I'm Not Like Everybody Else; 16) Dead End Street; 17) Big Black Smoke; 18) Mr Pleasant; 19) This Is Where I Belong; 20) Mr Reporter; 21) Little Woman.\n\nHeigh-ho! This is where The Kinks finally found a niche in which they were going to stay for at least ten years, and speaking frankly, they never ever got out of it totally - even after trading rock operas for heavy metal. The niche was that of a herald of the British empire, and Ray Davies, seeing as there'd been a vacancy or something like that, stepped up to the spot and led his band to explore the territory which had been previously explored by Charles Dickens and Jerome K. Jerome, but hardly by any rock musician. Unfortunately, the period of their huge musical growth also coincided with a steady decline in sales, and there can be no doubt considering the fact that Ray's musical decisions were often influenced by this commercial anti-success. Indeed. from then on The Kinks should probably hold the record for 'the most unsuccessful of all successful rock bands in the world'. Face To Face did chart, as far as I remember; but their obvious 'no' to psychedelia, acid and the groovy vibe in general proved to be fatal by 1967.\n\nAw, what the fuzz? To hell with it. Fact is, there's fourteen songs on this album, and if they were all great, I'd give this album a 10. Unfortunately, about a fourth part of them suck. The slow ballads 'Fancy' and 'Too Much On My Mind' (the former with its lack of memorable moments and the latter with its swooping and necessarily head-splitting bass line), for one, have never really captured my humble attention, as well as the closing 'I'll Remember'. The few rockers that are inherited directly from the garage period (by 1967 they'd correct this 'stupid mistake') are nice, but not spectacular: 'Party Line' boogies on modestly (the song's most notorious moment comes in the intro which features a ringing telephone for the first time), and 'Holiday In Waikiki' is an obvious rip-off of Chuck Berry's 'You Never Can Tell', even though nobody but me seems to notice. As well as nobody ever notices that the bass riff of 'You're Lookin' Fine' is remarkably similar to the one on 'Hey Bulldog'. Could John have ripped it off? I mean, c'mon - subconsciously? Just like he subconsciously ripped off The Who on 'Dear Prudence'? Eh? Never mind. Actually, I'm not at all displeased by the Chuck Berry rip-offs and so-so rockers, as they do a nice job of keeping the energy level at a relative high, a thing so badly lacked on their following record. Even so, it's not the rockers, which are already on the way out, but rather the little pictures of ordinary British life that really make this album: the mother lamenting for her long-lost daughter ('Rosie Won't You Please Come Home', one of the most wonderful numbers with Ray singing against a menacing bass line in the refrain), the dandy looking for girls ('Dandy'), the rich ('A House In The Country', 'Most Exclusive Residence For Sale'), the poor ('Sunny Afternoon'), the obscure and mystical ('Little Miss Queen Of Darkness'), and, of course, the weather ('Rainy Day In June'). Out of these, besides 'Rosie', I'd highly recommend 'Rainy Day In June', a slow, moody, threatening epic clearly influenced by Lennon's 'Rain', if only for that lazy, relaxed and simultaneously dark and ominous atmosphere, and nobody should bypass the great sing-along number that is 'Sunny Afternoon', with Ray adopting a sweet, lazy, idle tune which suits the lyrics one hundred percent and certainly transforms the songs into a great anthem of British life. There's also a serious advance in production values on this record. While the band was still working with Talmy, it's obvious that they were exploring the studio potential with far more zest than ever before: none of the songs sound like they were recorded in a leaking garage, and that's important: for such a 'serious' record the regular sloppy garage-band treatment would simply be a blasphemy. Numerous sound effects, like ringing phones, strikes of lightning, and swimming pool noises make their way on here, and all the instruments sound quite clear and sharp and tasty. Not to mention that the band has booked Nicky Hopkins into the studio, and he adorns many of the numbers with intricate piano and harpsichord parts; his help is so grandiose that Ray even dedicates an entire song to him, the sensitive, socially biting 'A Session Man'. A very convincing effort, indeed, and one of the most groundbreaking, blatantly 'artistic' rock records of 1966. Note that the album was supposed to be a concept one, with dialogue intermissions and far more sound effects than the actual number; however, the idiotic record company (or was it Mr Shel Talmy?) was against it, so all they have left are the telephone at the beginning of 'Party Line', the rain and thunder on 'Rainy Day In June' and a couple of other things. The bastards! They have deprived the Kinks of their Sgt Pepper! Who knows how rock music could have fared if... ah, forget it. Nobody would buy no stupid 'kinks' anyway. And anyway, this is still a concept album - it has a lot more concept than Sgt Pepper, for that matter. All the more amazing, as the great leap from Kontroversy still remains a mystery to be solved: the Beatles never advanced that fast. The new Rhino re-release is flabbergastingly great: besides a couple of fillers, it includes such great numbers of the time like the notorious singles 'I'm Not Like Everybody Else' and 'Dead End Street' (the former is the first appearance of self-exaltation on a rock record, the latter sounds like it could have been sung by Mr Alfred Jingle in prison), as well as one of my favourite Kinks songs of all time, 'Mr Pleasant' which is about a dude called Mr Pleasant whose wife goes out with another dude and 'things aren't so pleasant after all'. It has the most jabberwockingly great music hall melody of all time - full of subtle changes of key and charming harmonies, funny and sad at the same time. Rumour hath it that it was a single and it badly flopped. Well, what can I say? People are arguably idiots. ALL people. At least, ALL people who didn't buy that single in 1967. And hey, have you noticed how much Dave Davies' vocals have improved since the early days? When I listen to 'I'm Not Like Everybody Else', I actually like the way he sings: passionately, convincingly, and cleverly concealing the weaknesses of his vocal cords instead of exposing them. Oh, he also takes lead vocals on 'Party Line', and they're tolerable, too. His best hour was yet to come, of course, on the next record. Note, please, that my rating of 9 relates to the Rhino release. Without the bonus tracks it would only amount to 8 or maybe even 7 - unfortunately, the percent of filler on the original album is that great.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nSOMETHING ELSE BY THE KINKS\n\nYear Of Release: 1967\n\nRecord rating = 7\n\nOverall rating = 11\n\nA bit of a smudgy effort, but overall a fine successor to Face To Face. You gotta dig that style!\n\nBest song: WATERLOO SUNSET\n\nTrack listing: 1) David Watts; 2) Death Of A Clown; 3) Two Sisters; 4) No Return; 5) Harry Rag; 6) Tin Soldier Man; 7) Situation Vacant; 8) Love Me Till The Sun Shines; 9) Lazy Old Sun; 10) Afternoon Tea; 11) Funny Face; 12) End Of The Season; 13) Waterloo Sunset; [BONUS TRACKS:] 14) Act Nice And Gentle; 15) Autumn Almanac; 16) Susannah's Still Alive; 17) Wonderboy; 18) Polly; 19) Lincoln County; 20) There's No Life Without Love; 21) Lazy Old Sun (alternate stereo take).\n\nPeople often consider this as the Kinks' finest hour, but me, I must vehemently disagree. This is not the Kinks' finest hour. It's a good album, an essential album, it's an album that presents the Kinks in all their dreamy British glory; and yet, it's worse than Face To Face, in fact. And why? Well - because it sounds boring! Of course, I can't say that about all the songs, but the general atmosphere of the album is so lazy I usually have trouble trying to listen to it to the very end. See, by this point in their career they've abandoned all their pretensions to be a hard-rockin' band, leaving all that stuff to bands like the Stones and the Who, and concentrated entirely on the music-hall Victorian British music. The good side of this is that they're so highly professional and successful in this genre nobody can even come close: the bad side is that they're also starting to lose parts of their originality, repeating the same themes and chords over and over again.\n\nJust see for yourself: for every really good tune on the album you get a duffer or at least what I'd call a duffer. 'David Watts' opens the album on a highly optimistical note, moreover, it is the only real fast song on here (but do not fool yourself: this is NOT rock'n'roll, it's just fast retro piano pop), and you can't help singing along to all those silly 'fa-fa-fa-fa''s. Dave's 'Death Of A Clown' is, I confess, one of his best contributions to the entire catalogue, and he even manages to disguise the poorness of his vocals. But then we go off onto yet another set of Brit characters, just like on Face To Face; this time, however, the accent is mainly made on lyrics and 'concept'. What happened to the memorable melodies? 'No Return', 'Situation Vacant', and 'Funny Face' are all prime filler - neither do they have any memorable hooks nor well-structured and attractive melodies. Okay, after a lot of listens I take it back about 'Situation Vacant' - I at least love these little organ fills functioning as counterpoints to Ray's piercing vocals. But I stand by the statement that 'No Return' is just a sludgey sentimental ballad that hides the total lack of melody behind Ray's vocal charms, while 'Funny Face' may be a complex Dave tune, but it's also an insipid, bland Dave Davies tune. Slightly better are Ray's tale of two confronting sisters and his addiction to five o'clock tea (both 'Two Sisters' and 'Afternoon Tea' at least have a memorable and charming refrain). Dave contributes another weak ballad ('Love Me Till The Sun Shines'), and try as I might, I just can't understand why some critics who diss early Kinks' ballads love this one. Cuz it sounds just like the ones on the first album. In other words, it sucks. Hey, but calm down! Not all is lost! Ray's totally Anglicized ditties 'Tin Soldier Man' and especially 'Harry Rag' sound great, probably because they are the closest to British folk music on here, and God knows I love good British folk music. The strange martial rhythms on both of these songs, when combined with Ray's biting lyrics ('Harry Rag' seems to be about pot, for instance), produce a really strange, enthralling effect. 'Lazy Old Sun' is a significant half-Brit, half-psychedelic anthem which I just have trouble to listen to because it's so damn slooow and mooooody and booooring (I'd bet you anything this is a good song to listen to when you're stoned). And the final two tracks - the nostalgic, melancholic 'End Of The Season' with French pop influences and the magnificent ballad 'Waterloo Sunset' which pretty much defines the word 'beautiful' (in a way that you can say: 'What is beautiful? Ever heard 'Waterloo Sunset?' That's beautiful for you!') - are a great way to close the album. 'Waterloo Sunset', in fact, has really become an indisputable gauge of gorgeousness for almost anybody who's had the luck to hear it - ???? Wow! Opening and finishing the record on a high note and putting all the filler in between! Now that's the way to make an album!.. Of course, the album is almost unmatched if it's the lyrics, not the actual chords, that you're looking for. Ray's lyrical abilities have fully matured, and, while he'd go on to stun us with his word imagery for at least four or five more years and produce quite a fair share of equally impressive lyrics, he'd never top the great 'portrait gallery' that's hung out within the limits of this record. Teenage ambitions, sufferings of the low-classed, romantic feelings of the simple ordinary people, traditional British values, stereotypic British characters... the lyrics sheet can be a real revelation. Plus, the Rhino re-release has some cool bonus tracks, most notably the terrific single 'Autumn Almanac' which surprises me as being one of the first multipart compositions (kinda like an abbreviated version of Thick As A Brick or anything like that) where all the parts are great - tight, compact, charming and memorable. Nostalgic, too. British, too. One of their best Brit anthems, no doubt. The other tracks don't rise to that standard, though: there are some mediocre Dave songs like 'Susannah's Still Alive' (they flopped, so he decided not to have a solo career after all, even if he did have such plans at first). 'Act Nice And Gentle' sounds like an outtake from Face To Face, so it's fun, and both 'Wonderboy' and 'Polly' have their moments, but overall the bonuses aren't as strong as the ones on Face To Face or Kinda Kinks. Except for 'Autumn Almanac', of course.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nLIVE AT KELVIN HALL\n\nYear Of Release: 1968\n\nRecord rating = 6\n\nOverall rating = 10\n\nCould have been quite entertaining - but what could a live album from the mid-Sixties sound like?\n\nBest song: SUNNY AFTERNOON\n\nTrack listing: 1) Till The End Of The Day; 2) A Well Respected Man; 3) You're Lookin' Fine; 4) Sunny Afternoon; 5) Dandy; 6) I'm On An Island; 7) Come On Now; 8) You Really Got Me; 9) Milk Cow Blues/Batman Theme/Tired Of Waiting For You/Milk Cow Blues; [BONUS TRACKS:] 10) Till The End Of The Day (stereo); 11) A Well Respected Man (stereo); 12) You're Lookin' Fine (stereo); 13) Sunny Afternoon (stereo); 14) Dandy (stereo); 15) I'm On An Island (stereo); 16) Come On Now (stereo); 17) You Really Got Me (stereo); 18) Milk Cow Blues/Batman Theme/Tired Of Waiting For You/Milk Cow Blues (stereo).\n\nThe title should suggest that this is a live album - even to the most mentally deficient reader, that is.

Congratulations, Mr Davies!), most of the time they prefer to stick to general hysteria. The actual performance, if listened to with enough care, turns out to be great. Just as Live At Leeds was a hard-rock antidote for the artistic Tommy, this one's a garage-rock antidote for the Dickens-flavoured Face To Face (the performance was recorded well before the release of Something Else). Sure, it does contain 'Sunny Afternoon' and two Brit character descriptions (a good version of 'A Well Respected Man' and an almost unheard 'Dandy'), as well as the lightweight 'I'm On An Island' from Kontroversy. And it's somewhat strange to hear these quiet, psychological tunes, delivered in more or less the same arrangements as the studio originals, performed live amidst a sea of screaming girls. The very idea of the audience going wild and completely off its head to lyrics like 'He's a well respected man about town/Doing the best things so conservatively' seems kinda ridiculous to me, but what the hell, they could have sung 'It Was A Very Good Year' and received the same kind of reaction. And I'm positively torn over 'Sunny Afternoon', because the performance, immaculate and captivating as it is, stands so much at odds with the teenage frenzy that it almost spoils all the fun. It's a wonder, though, that as if by magic, at Ray's command the audience stops the screaming as one and launches into the anthemic refrain - something the Beatles could probably never have managed.\n\nThen again, the rest is gruff, in-yer-face rock-n-roll, bashed out with a considerable amount of force and self-assurance (at least, by that time they really managed to play their instruments on stage). Even if you cannot hear a single note, you're sure to be caught in the general frenzy, fury and fun from the very first chords of 'Till The End Of The Day', a fantastic show opener. 'You Really Got Me' hits almost harder than the original, and this is where the screaming comes in handy, the only thing spoiling the picture being the strange 'blooping' noises emitted by the bass. It's also great to hear a female backing vocals-free version of 'Come On Now' with Ray and Dave trading verses and singing backup to each other. And the final medley of a successful blues cover ('Milk Cow Blues'), the inevitable 'Batman' theme (just imagine that the Who did it too! What was that - a general obsession?), and 'Tired Of Waiting For You' even suggests me the horrendous idea that the band was sometimes going for a 'jammy' sound of the likes of Cream and the Who - after all, it's more than eight minutes long! They are no jammers, though, so the effort could be totally dispensable if not for the fact that the instrumental passages are not very long and the 'secondary' themes woven in very carefully. Of course, by the time the record appeared on the market, it was somewhat late - the show was recorded on April 1, 1967, and by 1968 neither the Kinks really sounded like that on stage nor the audiences were so wild. Blame the stupid Pye record company that not only delayed the release, but also mistook 'Till The End Of The Day' for 'All Day And All Of The Night', heh heh. You gotta keep that in mind; the record's sound quality should be compared to the 'first generation' of rock live albums, not to Leeds or Ya-Ya's. As usual, fate was kinda unjust to the poor band. The Rhino re-release has both the mono and stereo versions of the album, even though I don't consider this a very good idea. Essentially, this is just a poorly recorded album with loads of noise; without headphones, both versions sound about the same, and listening to it in headphones is simply not a very good idea cuz it just might cause permanent ear damage. Why couldn't they disinter some more good ol' tapes instead? The Who have done it for Leeds - what's the matter with this one? Do they really expect us to listen to the same album twice without pauses? OK, so some people might prefer the newly issued mono version; me, I don't give a damn - the girls' screams overshadow both of them. Which actually reminds me that the Stones' Got Live sounds a lot better (and I don't mean the two studio songs disguised as live cuts). Yeah, I know technology sucked back then, but still - this could have been a better job. Get it, still. And if you see an album entitled The Live Kinks - grab it as well, 'cause it's the name of the original American release. Apparently the American public wasn't supposed to enjoy the term 'Kelvin Hall'. Hmm. Were the American record people trying to hide the Kinks' Britishness from American audiences? Another point in pointing out that record people are a bunch of tasteless idiots...\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nTHE VILLAGE GREEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY\n\nYear Of Release: 1968\n\nRecord rating = 10\n\nOverall rating = 14\n\nCulmination of all the Britfest. Fantastic melodies, too.\n\nBest song: VILLAGE GREEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY\n\nTrack listing: 1) The Village Green Preservation Society; 2) Do You Remember Walter; 3) Picture Book; 4) Johnny Thunder; 5) The Last Of The Steam Powered Trains; 6) Big Sky; 7) Sitting By The Riverside; 8) Animal Farm; 9) Village Green; 10) Starstruck; 11) Phenomenal Cat; 12) All My Friends Were There; 13) Wicked Annabella; 14) Monica; 15) People Take Pictures Of Each Other.\n\nA series of overimportant firsts for the lads here: the first album without Shel Talmy (at last!), the first album to ensure Ray's absolute leadership in the band (no Dave vocals nor songs), the first totally transparent concept album (almost a mini-'rock opera'), the first album with almost no serious stinkers (not a single truly boring song on here). Ain't that enough to get a 10?\n\nNow, seriously speaking, I don't find this album as good as lots of people say it is. I still give it a 10 because I feel this is extremely close to the best the Kinks could ever have the possibility to come up with, but there are a couple of defects - lemme just mention them before I start praising every single note. The general drawback is that the album displays a rather limited choice of styles - in fact, it's even more limited than on Something Else. All of these tracks come from the British music hall (with the possible exception of the slightly more rockin' 'Last Of The Steam Powered Trains' and 'Wicked Annabella'), and the sound is somewhat monotonous - frankly speaking, I get a teeny-weeny bit bored toward the end. Even after a lot of listens, there's just something lacking about this record that often makes me reconsider the score. The monotonousness of the songs (hell, it's even reflected in song titles - we have 'Picture Book' vs. 'People Take Pictures Of Each Other' or 'The Village Green Preservation Society' vs. 'Village Green') sometimes gets me down. I do admit that monotonousness isn't always a serious defect - just look at George Harrison's All Things Must Pass, for instance - but when you deal with a sound as laid back, lazy, relaxed and un-rousing as the trademark Ray Davies style, it's very easy to get bored over forty minutes of this stuff. Very easy. So be warned - this stuff will seem great to you, but only if you have a penchant for the quiet country life. I still leave the ten, after months and months of reflexion, but it's definitely a weak ten as compared to the undoubtable, solid ten of Arthur. Oh, and there's a particular defect here, too: 'Big Sky' totally sucks because Ray recites his lyrics without singing them, and this immediately reminds me of Eric Burdon's style on Winds Of Change (yeah, follow that link and check out the rating). I mean, the melody of the song is all right, with a sharp, attractive acoustic track, but I'd really prefer Ray singing than reciting; leave that stuff for Preservation, please. But hey now, that's only one song out of fifteen, and that's OK. And, while the songs are lazy, this laziness hardly ever metamorphoses into complete lethargy or lack of memorable melody, like it often does on Something Else. All of the other tracks have at least a single hook, and most of them more than one. Like I said, the album is a concept one - the band is acting as a bunch of traditionalists protesting against the crumbling of traditional British (and, in a broader sense - all-human) customs and lifestyles; in fact, the true name of the album is The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society - so that nobody would doubt Ray Davies' sincere artistic impulses. It's no wonder, then, that the style is so peaceful and quiet, with 'idle' guitars and lax pianos swooping all around. If Face To Face was just selected pictures of English life and Something Else penetrated all kinds of social types, then Village Green is a more restricted effort: instead of diffusing himself all over the state, Ray chooses the quiet country life as his ideal, and most of the songs are devoted to this quiet and peaceful theme. The title track, a charming and very thought-provoking ode to British conservatism, is still my favourite on the record - and not only because of the wonderful allegories Ray is using to describe his 'tradition-saving program' ('We are the Office Block Persecution Affinity/God save little shops, china cups and virginity'), but also because of the melody and the wonderful aethereal vocal harmonies in the 'Waterloo Sunset' vibe. That doesn't mean that the others are throwaways - 'Do You Remember Walter' is nostalgia at its most romantic; 'Picture Book' is fun at its grooviest (don't you just love these imbecile 'NAAA-nah-nah-nah-nah'?); 'Johnny Thunder' is an entertaining boring song (truly, it has a refrain that sounds like a lot of bored people singing together, and it is entertaining); and 'Starstruck' is just a great song to dance to. I'll close my eyes on minor self-rip-offs - for instance, 'Village Green' borrows its melody from 'Harry Rag', though nobody seems to notice that, but that's a clever and unobtrusive rip-off in any case; and it's fully compensated by the wonderful ragtime rhythms of 'Sitting By The Riverside' or the totally unexpected elements of Latin music on 'Monica' (which you could possibly know as 'ai-ai shall die ai-ai shall die if I should lose Monica-a'...) Of course, those who like their Kinks loud and brash (that is, have lost the thread somewhere around 1966), will be seriously disappointed. The only track that comes close to 'menacing' is the parody number 'Wicked Anabella' which borrows so much from the Who's 'Boris The Spider' that it's practically impossible to view it as an independent serious effort (it's cute, though). The songs are predominantly acoustic - even when they do use electric guitars, they make them smooth and soft, and occasional bursts of stingin' electricity like the one in the already mentioned 'Last Of The Steam Powered Trains' really do not count. But the atmosphere that Ray tries to re-create here is really something unique in rock music: the Conservative Party must have been proud. The album sold miserably in the States, and that's perfectly understandable: it was totally, absolutely and undeniably unsuited to neither the American rock scene at the time nor the American lifestyle in general. Steam powered trains, strawberry jam and village green were not on everybody's number one list in 1968, and lines like 'picture yourself when you're getting old' were obviously aimed at anybody but the hip audiences of rock bands at the time. Fortunately, time heals all wounds, and it's good to see the album finally step into its rights and get due acknowledgement as of lately - thirty years after its release which is really a long time by the measures of modern history. One more proof to the fact that one has to work out of love for art - not of love for commercial success. And in that respect, the Kinks just couldn't fail. Sometimes I even wonder - you know, if Ray wasn't really making all this stuff with a hindsight - aiming at achieving success in retrospect, making something for his generation to enjoy not at the time, but several decades later. Probably not, but it still came out exactly that way. Funny, isn't it? P.S. I don't have the Rhino re-issue of the album, but I know that it includes both the mono and stereo versions of the album (doesn't sound like a great idea to me - I wish they'd dug out some more unreleased outtakes for it), plus the single 'Days' which is indeed a terrific song, one of Ray's most charming romantic ballads ever. The reissue is probably worth picking up for 'Days' alone, although any serious Kinks compilation should probably include the number as well.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nARTHUR (OR THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE)\n\nYear Of Release: 1969\n\nRecord rating = 10\n\nOverall rating = 14\n\nVictorian Punk. Ever wondered what such a thing could be? Well, here you are!\n\nBest song: SHANGRI-LA\n\nTrack listing: 1) Victoria; 2) Yes Sir No Sir; 3) Some Mother's Son; 4) Drivin'; 5) Brainwashed; 6) Australia; 7) Shangri La; 8) Mr Churchill Says; 9) She's Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina; 10) Young And Innocent Days; 11) Nothing To Say; 12) Arthur; [BONUS TRACKS:] 13) Plastic Man; 14) King Kong; 15) Drivin' (mono); 16) Mindless Child Of Motherhood; 17) This Man He Weeps Tonight; 18) Plastic Man (stereo); 19) Mindless Child Of Motherhood (stereo); 20) This Man He Weeps Tonight (stereo); 21) She's Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina (mono); 22) Mr Shoemakers Daughter.\n\nIf only I'd gotten this album before Village Green, there would be no doubt the latter would have been deprived of the 10 mark. As it is, I generously let both of them share the spot, but... Arthur is definitely better. Yet another in an endless string of concept albums, this one was originally envisioned by Ray as a soundtrack to some weird TV movie, but the project was scrapped at the last moment, so he was left with just the music. The subject is rather complicated, but you can read all about it in the liner notes. Suffice it to say that the lyrics on the album are among Ray's best ever poetical efforts: while lacking any signs of delicate intricacy (which is not that unusual for Mr Davies who usually avoids ambivalent expressions), it also offers a lot of thinking process to the listener - quite unlike the straightforward and rather banal lyrics of, say, Low Budget. It's about small people and their fates in general. Old people, too. Arthur must have been at least in his seventies. Do you understand now why nobody bought this record in 1969, with the title track going like 'Arthur we love you, want to help you'?\n\nBut enough of the lyrics. It's the melodies that are really captivating. Simple to the extreme, as usual, but unbelievingly catchy, funny and sincere, angry and raving at times, emotional and mystic at other times. Hell, since this is so great an effort, why not go over it track by track? The opening track, 'Victoria', is a punk's paradise: banal three-chord sequences, fast, pulsating rhythm, and shredded, muddy and exciting vocals. But the lyrics? 'Long ago, grass was green, sex was bad and obscene'. It's a dang classic! I love it! Then we go into the first of the anti-war hymns: the dreary 'Yes Sir No Sir' which manages to convey the army atmosphere of obeisance and horrible braindead discipline just fine. And 'Some Mother's Son' is a beautiful anti-war ballad whose psychologic depictions of 'two soldiers fighting in a trench' end up in a fantastic series of climaxes throughout the record. Then comes 'Drivin'' with its throbbing bass lines, beautiful vocal harmonies and words praising the beauty of picnicking on the grass - that's probably the only song that could have easily made it onto Village Green. The hidden gem on Side A, to my opinion, is 'Brainwashed' - a song which totally, uncompromisingly and absolutely eliminates the need for the existence of punk rock. 'Cause during its two minutes and three seconds it manages to encompass everything that's so important about punk (speed, simple guitar riff, angry vocals, hard-edged sound and anti-establishment lyrics) and much more (great embellishments provided by the horn section, memorability and originality). And, finally, the first side closes with the controversial 'Australia' which starts as an entertaining parody on TV commercials ('Australia, no class distinction, Australia, no drug addiction') and ends in a four-minute jam carried on by Dave Davies' interminable soloing. Most people hate it (in fact, all the reviews of the record that I've read punctuate this as the main defect), but I really can't get the point. It's not nasty or anything - it's just a bit too long. On the plus side, it's very moody and maybe if we knew what part of the movie it was bound to accompany we'd treat it better. I don't mind, really. Now the second side is just a teeny-weeny bit weaker than the first one, but you wouldn't know it from the opener. Because 'Shangri-La' gotta rank as one of the top three or four Kinks' songs ever. The way that Ray sings the opening verses, accompanied by just an acoustic and some horns in the background, is positively frightening and mystifying all at once. It invites a certain Gothic atmosphere which really isn't supposed to be there, but there it is: this old man, sitting in an armchair in his silent and gloomy 'Shangri-La' (which is actually the name of Arthur's mansion), pondering upon old times and looking back at his past life. Something's happening, really. Then this harpsichord enters the scene, and the spooky atmosphere is gone to give way to some mighty huge anthemic singing, then it goes off into a fast energetic part before reverting back to the harpsichord and one more refrain. In fact, the song might be the best ever hybrid of ballad and anthem I've ever heard: even the Who failed with such kind of things (see my review of Who's Next). Next comes 'Mr Churchill Says' with some more great melody-making: as is usual for this record, it is divided into a slow and a fast part, with the slow part being similar to 'Yes Sir No Sir' and the fast part being similar to 'Brainwashed'. Similar, but not identic. And this also means that you can either reflect on the song or just dance to it - or both, for that matter. 'She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina' is a charming piece of ragtime set to the most amusing social commentary on record. 'Young And Innocent Days' is the only really weak spot on the album: a quiet, acoustic ballad which doesn't have any real energy or force (rather like the kind of sloppy ballads Ray used to write years ago, like 'Ring The Bells' and stuff). It only has three short verses but manages to drag on for almost three minutes. Still, at least three minutes is not five or ten. Then one more average pop number - 'Nothing To Say' (with a catchy, but somewhat stupid melody, it was obviously written in order to fill in the concept), and the closing title track presents us with yet another great riff, some charming singing and these mighty lines: 'Arthur we love you, want to help you, somebody loves you, don't ya know it?' It leaves a real sense of accomplishment and even satisfaction. All's well that ends well. And have I told you how much I enjoy the arrangements and the playing? Because by that point the Kinks really knew how to use their instruments, and it shows, whether on Dave's competent and utterly enjoyable leads, or on Mick Avory's ferocious battle-style drumming - who'd ever believe this is the guy that kept being ushered out by session drummers in 1964! Just listen to his sticks on 'Shangri-La' or 'Princess Marina' and you'll understand that he's really responsible for a large part of the album's sound. So? Was this the best concept album of 1969? People usually compare it with Tommy, just because they came out at approximately the same time and were both 'rock operas'. If I followed suite, I'd have to admit that Arthur's concept is definitely higher. Not that I'm a great fan of Ray Davies' conceptualism: quite often it looks completely artificial, banal and even stupid. But this time, he'd got it right. He hit the bullseye. And he also strenghtened the concept with some incredible songs. Unfortunately, this would be the last album where music took on a higher priority than concept: starting with Lola, Ray would slowly abandon melody-making in favour of story writing. But right now and right here the balance is simply perfect. Also, this is definitely a rock album, unlike the quiet Village Green: the guitars roar, there's plenty o' solos and watch out for that speed! It never gets boring for me. Buy it now! Forgetting about the fact that nobody bought it back then, of course.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nLOLA VERSUS POWERMAN AND THE MONEYGOROUND, PART 1\n\nYear Of Release: 1970\n\nRecord rating = 7\n\nOverall rating = 11\n\nSome pseudo-melodic fully-conceptual filler and some ultra-fantastic semi-conceptual songs.\n\nBest song: LOLA, but APEMAN comes close\n\nTrack listing: 1) The Contenders; 2) Strangers; 3) Denmark Street; 4) Get Back In The Line; 5) Lola; 6) Top Of The Pops; 7) The Moneygoround; 8) This Time Tomorrow; 9) A Long Way From Home; 10) Rats; 11) Apeman; 12) Powerman; 13) Got To Be Free; [BONUS TRACKS:] 14) Lola (single version); 15) Apeman (demo); 16) Powerman (demo).\n\nOoh, how I hate these horrible album titles that tend to take up more space than the review itself...\n\nOkay, so the story goes that somewhere around the spring of 1970 Ray churned out the most popular and commercially successful song of all his career which I wouldn't even want to comment upon because everybody knows it. The song was 'Lola', the subject matter was the protagonist's brief acquaintance and flirt with a travestite, the melody was incredibly involving and memorable, the bombastic chorus ('lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-Lola') became the Kinks' arena signature, and the single was one of their biggest international smashes, reinstating them as major artists in the USA as well. The problem was with putting it on an album. The song itself, as is obvious, mostly deals with transsexuality and nothing else; there's not too much social philosophy going on in there unless one presumes that the lines about a 'muddled up mixed up shook up world' actually mean more than is obvious at first glance. But the album on which it was finally included is almost entirely dedicated to the concept of the ups and downs (mostly downs) of record industry and hitmaking, and how these two subjects manage to fit in is an absolute mystery known only to Mr Ray Davies. Lola Versus Powerman? Transsexualism against corporate industry? You tell me... Then again, maybe the Kinks weren't the 'kinks' for nothing: there's no better way to flee the pressures of commercial success than in the embrace of a loving travestite. That's merely a hypothesis, mind you. :) Anyway, in the musical sense this album is really a huge disappointment after such a great record as Arthur. It still gets a relatively high rating just because it contains two genuine Kinks classics. 'Lola' is a great song, of course, and so is the pretty evolution/ecology anthem 'Apeman', which by the way doesn't fit in with the general subject just as well. I can't even understand which song I dig the most - it's 'Lola' on one day and 'Apeman' on another one. The latter song is especially soothing when you're pissed off at the world - well, everybody's supposed to have his or her moment of wanting to 'make like an Apeman'. But the rest of the tracks fall into three different categories, none of which are very much enlightening and some of which are rather ominous, predicting the general twist the Kinks' career would take further on, albeit in a less easily perceivable form this time. The first one of these is the actual 'moneygoround' concept where Ray was clearly far more worried about the lyrics than the actual musical background. 'Denmark Street'; 'Top Of The Pops'; 'Moneygoround'; 'Powerman' - all of them deal with the protagonist's commercial success and his lamentations on being totally dependent on the big bosses, and all of them rely on basic chord sequences, used at least a trillion times before. In fact, this is the place where Ray openly begins stealing melodies, quietly initiating the general routine of appropriating other people's inventions: the riff in the mid section of 'Top Of The Pops' is an unashamed rip-off of the golden oldie 'Land Of A Thousand Dances' (which I only heard played by Bill Haley, but it must have been a jazz classic). Which makes me wonder: how many more melodies whose ancestors I can't identify did Davies steal, and how much of the assumed Kinks' (and other bands as well) merits are really owed to people who lived and created long before them? That's a serious artistic paradox to you, folks. In any case, when you really try to compare the 'conceptual' tracks on here to the ones on Arthur, the regress is obvious: the songs are still rather complex, with multi-part arrangements, but with not even a third of the original musical ideas Ray displayed on Arthur. That said, none of the songs are unpleasant - 'Denmark Street' and 'Moneygoround' are even funny, being based on generic barroom piano shuffles and thus somehow predicting Ray's style on Muswell Hillbillies (typical Brit satire set to American lounge music). 'Top Of The Pops' rocks pretty hard, and 'Powerman' is the best of these numbers, with an interesting riff and a very catchy chorus, but it still doesn't rank as a great song - put next to the blazing power of 'Brainwashed' or the righteous fury of 'Mr Churchill Says', it's flat out dull and bland. The second category are sulky and clearly uninteresting ballads, none of which can rank beyond 'cute' - the obvious legacy of 'Young And Innocent Days', with Ray going more for a 'dreamy atmosphere' than an actual memorable melody. 'Get Back In The Line' is the only one of the three that might try to qualify, as it moves from the dirgey verses to the pseudo-bombastic chorus with a certain conviction, but there's nothing about 'This Time Tomorrow' apart from the half-pleasant banjo and Ray's melancholic intonations to distinguish it from your average uninspired pop ballad by any average band, and 'A Long Way From Home' is 'Young And Innocent Days Part II' - a primitive piano melody and a Traffic-style folkish chant that starts and ends nowhere. Not even a single trace of the wonderful Britpop style of yore: it's almost as if Ray was consciously moving beyond his cherished genre of 1966-68 and sticking to playing as generically as possible. And while I did get used to that idea (you should, too: otherwise you'd have to judge the Seventies' Kinks by their Sixties efforts, and that would be a catastrophe), it was a mighty terrible shock at first, as if the entire world collapsed and a new one, a bland and edgeless one at that, had completely replaced it. Finally, the third category is represented by Dave Davies returning to form, and his efforts could have been passable and maybe even admirable if not for the usual horrid vocals. Come to think of it, 'Strangers' could have been a hit - if not for the utterly idiotic, but pretentious, lyrics ('if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die') and the murky tone evocating Dave's worst moments on the early Kinks' records. But I gotta admit that melodically, 'Strangers' is the best ballad on the whole album - there are certain twists to the vocal melody that make it catchy and make you want to sing along. And the rockin' 'Rats' isn't that encouraging, either, but if the main idea was just to present an atmosphere of complete paranoia and utter mental self-destruction, it's completely adequate - the wild rhythm of the song, Dave's garage guitar chops and crazy screaming convey the feeling well. This is still the Kinks, of course - just not vintage Kinks - and it still gets my praises rather than complete condemnation. But what actually happened is that by this time Ray had clearly become more interested in presenting explicit narrative subjects than in writing clever lyrics and setting them to pretty melodies. It's the down side of all conceptual albums and rock operas, in fact: chasing after the plot, one forgets about the actual musical side of the project. Not that this particular concept is that entertaining, as well; Lola is the far precursor to Ray's childish operas of the mid-Seventies that managed to significantly profanate his reputation as that of one of the most intellectual songwriters of his generation. Moreover, Lola seems highly hypocritic: even if Ray was an expert in the matter, having gone through a lot of commercial trouble himself, by now the band were forming a part of the musical business themselves, so going out and bashing it on the record was a highly strange thing to do. They far overdid the same theme on Everybody's In Show-Biz, of course, but even here it sounds somewhat comic and insincere. And, of course, bringing in 'Lola' and making it part of the concept is such an obvious put-on that it really makes one question Ray's geniality... And hey! Why is this 'Part One', I wonder? Was Ray going to do a 'Part Two'? And if so, where is it? On the other hand, maybe it would be better not to ask... The recent Rhino re-release has some bonus tracks, but this time they're not thoroughly entertaining: an alternate version of 'Lola' with the original line 'it tastes like Coca-Cola' replaced by 'cherry cola' on the insistance of some BBC thugs, and an alternate version of 'Apeman' with Dave throwing in some electric lines to bad effect; thank God it was not used on the original version. The demo of 'Powerman' doesn't really sound much different from the original version, either.\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nPERCY\n\nYear Of Release: 1971\n\nRecord rating = 6\n\nOverall rating = 10\n\nA weird movie soundtrack with the Kinks displaying some unusual musical... err... ideas.\n\nBest song: MOMENTS\n\nTrack listing: 1) God's Children; 2) Lola (instrumental); 3) The Way Love Used To Be; 4) Completely; 5) Running Round Town; 6) Moments; 7) Animals In The Zoo; 8) Just Friends; 9) Whip Lady; 10) Dreams; 11) Helga; 12) Willesden Green; 13) God's Children - The End.\n\nWhile this is definitely Ray's weakest moment in the entire \"glory period\" of 1966-72, I won't really be saying anything bad about this album: it's a soundtrack and it's supposed to be nothing else but a soundtrack, in the end. Of course, I haven't seen the movie and I wouldn't want to (it was about something like a penis transplant, as far as I've read and since the album cover suggests it, too). The music itself is quite good, in fact. About a half of it is instrumental, of course, but what can you expect from a soundtrack? Not to mention that it gives us a chance to witness Ray's inventiveness when it comes around to making real instrumental music, not just amusing drugged out jamming at the end of 'Australia' or something.\n\nSure enough, the instrumental bits are kinda weird - not particularly atmospheric or particularly well-played, but, well, just interesting in a special Kinky way. One of these instrumentals, by the way, is 'Lola', And it's played with gusto - with keyboards and guitars replacing Ray's voice to fair effect. The organ part sounds incredibly goofy to me, actually, but I suppose it's just an obligatory part of all the fun. The rest is a mind-boggling hodge-podge, with not a single number repeating the same style or ideas. Thus, 'Helga' has some good exercises in moody classical guitar; 'Completely' is a groovy blues number with a dark gritty edge, and 'Running Round Town' is a clear-cut rip-off of 'When The Saints Go Marching In' (at least, as far as that harmonica goes'. Not bad that, eh? Everything is fairly amateurish, but it sounds far more exciting than ninety-nine percent of \"professional\" soundtrack music that only bores you to death in all its moodiness and technical proficiency and slick production. In that way, even minor throwaway pieces like 'Whip Lady' are fun: just a very short one-minute instrumental that starts out with some tinkling pretty piano and then midway through is transformed into a rocker with special guitar effects and pounding drums. Forgettable, but kinda cute... As for the actual songs, they are OK, but it is obvious they were written specially for the film and Ray wasn't really very much interested in songwriting at the moment. This explains why, for example, the pretty but unoriginal 'Animals In The Zoo' is in fact 'Apeman No. 2', with both the melody and the lyrics following the same pattern; I don't say 'rip-off' or 'recycling' because that wouldn't be completely true, but the message and the atmosphere are basically the same, not to mention the similar 'bouncy' feel of the song. 'Willesden Green' is 'Village Green' (in case nobody has noticed): its country intonations, indeed, remind of that classic, but here it sounds more generic and conventional and consequently more dull. Also, the vocals are practically unrecognizable on this one. 'Dreams' and 'The Way Love Used To Be' are rather weak ballads (although, to be honest, I feel more true emotion and sincerity on the latter than on the pro forma ballads off Lola), and even the strongest tracks on here - the opening 'God's Children' and the trebly-vocalized 'Moments' really fall short of the standard once again. They essentially sound like outdated outtakes from the VGPS sessions with weaker lyrics and an unpleasant emphasis on preachiness: first signs of Ray's slow, but imminent degradation into simplistic banalities. I mean, couldn't 'God's Children' easily fit on Preservation? Even if in that case the song would still overshadow most of the material from that wretched 'opera'. That doesn't mean they're bad songs: Ray was still on a relatively high roll at the time, and no preachiness can overshadow the fact that the melodies of 'God's Children' and 'Moments' are oh so nice. I'm not entirely pleased with the overreliance on orchestration: understood, it's a soundtrack, but far too often Ray slips into corny Sinatrisms that are by no means acceptable from the Kinks. Oh well, so far there's really no need to worry. Remember, it's just a soundtrack. What do you expect? A miracle? Yes, this certainly is a recognizable Kinks album, but it's drenched in mediocrity, Hollywoodery, and melody-recycling; and it was probably released only to end their contract with Pye records - apparently, the record company didn't quite get the message of Lola and was milking the poor artists further, so they were only too glad to leave their long-time masters and begin their lengthy period of short-time associations with miriads of different labels. (Which for quite a long stretch of time was a tragedy for me - any of their 1971-75 RCA releases, including the last of their great classics, Muswell Hillbillies, are absolutely unavailable in Russia. So I had to wait until my trip to Italy (sic!) to lay my hands on the freshly released Velvel re-issues. And here they are!)\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nMUSWELL HILLBILLIES\n\nYear Of Release: 1971\n\nRecord rating = 9\n\nOverall rating = 13\n\nSuccessfully marrying pictures of Brit life with American ragtime tunes? Whoa!\n\nBest song: 20TH CENTURY MAN\n\nTrack listing: 1) 20th Century Man; 2) Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues; 3) Holiday; 4) Skin And Bone; 5) Alcohol; 6) Complicated Life; 7) Here Come The People In Grey; 8) Have A Cuppa Tea; 9) Holloway Jail; 10) Oklahoma USA; 11) Uncle Son; 12) Muswell Hillbilly; [BONUS TRACKS:] 13) Mountain Woman; 14) Kentucky Moon.\n\nThis is a hell of an important album, 'cause it heralds a series of firsts and lasts for the Kinks. First of all, it's the first album on their new record label, RCA, which had the grace to pick them up after they'd been thrown out of Pye. Unfortunately, the poor RCA guys didn't get what they wanted, which was a commercial hit single band. What they got was a total departure from everything the Kinks were known before. Indeed, at some point in his career Ray took on a specific Dylan-ish attitude towards the audiences, which is to say he didn't give a damn whether anybody liked his prolific musical output or not. This attitude lasted throughout all of his RCA period, so the 1971-1975 records are usually despised. With one exception. Muswell Hillbillies, the last universally acclaimed Kinks' classic album.\n\nWhat makes Hillbillies such a fascinating listen now, more than twenty-five years since its release? It's a far cry from Arthur, both lyrically and musically: the seriousness and philosophy, the deeply-penetrating social critique seems to have evaporated in favour of lightweight satire and plain, old-fashioned humour, while the fascinating guitar melodies have given way to a strangely out-of-place jazz/ragtime sound, with lots of songs being just minor variations on the themes of pop songs from the Twenties or around that time. But somehow it all seems to work and never gets boring - a little mystery on account of Mr Ray Davies, the Muswell Hillbilly boy. Maybe the greatest feature of this record is that it manages to make a really unique combination. Instead of setting his Britfest lyrics to English music hall tunes (like on Something Else) or to drivin' rock'n'roll (Arthur), Ray has suddenly hired a decent jazz band (three guys who were to accompany the regular band for a long time from now on) and put his grim descriptions of English working class people in the frame of American jazz and ragtime. In fact, the very title of the album symbolizes this 'marriage': Muswell Hill was the district where Ray lived in his childhood, while the 'Hillbillies' come from the Beverley Hillbillies, of course. Really weird. To conclude this little \"introduction\", let me just say that the combination of generic American melodies, biting British satire, Ray's sharp brand of black humour, and his inimitable vocal stylizations, make this a true classic - one of the most perfectly balanced \"lyrics-music-singing\" trios I've ever heard. In other words - a record that has basically no distinguishable parallels in the world of rock music. None at all. Most of the songs could have been described as 'nothing special', but almost all of them have at least something to capture your attention and settle themselves cozily in your memory. Thus, 'Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues', with its screeching New Orleanian brass licks, produces a fascinating contrast between the jolly melody and truly paranoid lyrics; the bebop 'Skin And Bone' is just great to tap your foot to; 'Complicated Life' and 'Have A Cuppa Tea' are terrific singalongs, the former having the most amusing lyrics Ray ever produced up to date, the latter being about Ray's grandmother; 'Here Come The People In Grey' is a shiveringly sincere picture of total mental deficiency; and just listen to what Ray does to his voice on 'Holiday' to get that genuine Twenties' radio sound - and it works (actually, what he is really doing is singing with a cigar in his mouth: try it and you'll understand)! The real weird song on here is the famous 'Alcohol' which goes even beyond jazz limits: it has something of a gypsy sound to it, or at least a very deep-lying folk sound, and you won't find anything else in the Kinks' catalogue (in fact, in any rock band catalogue) that resembles this lament for a boozer. However, if there is a real classic on the album, it's really the album opener. '20th Century Man' sounds completely out of place on the record (musically, of course; lyrically it's just another piece of social, anti-modernistic critique with the great lines 'you keep all your smart modern writers/give me William Shakespeare/you keep all your smart modern painters/I'll take Rembrandt, Titian, da Vinci and Gainsborough'), and if ever you heard it and liked it, don't rush out to buy the album. It's the only real piece of rock'n'roll on record, bouncing along at a fast tempo with vicious slide guitars, throbbing, almost genuinely paranoid drums and swirling Hammond organs. The real highlight, of course, is Ray's singing, going from a trembling, insecure, also paranoid tone and slowly mounting to a furious scream. The way the tension mounts on the song, from the opening acoustic strumming and up to the final instrumental thunderstorm, is simply unbelievable. Don't forget to check out a great live version on One For The Road. Oh, sure there's a little filler on record, somewhere near the end, I guess (I've never been a fan of 'Uncle Son', for one, and the title track is somewhat simplistic, even though catchy, intelligent and anthemic all at once), but it's passable and certainly inoffensive. And the gentle ballad 'Oklahoma U.S.A.' might seem sloppy, but in reality it's not: I've suddenly realized that this is as much of a highlight as all these other highlights, with its sad story of a girl's useless and psychic fantasies. The recent Velvel reissue which I had the luck to obtain has two bonus tracks, both unreleased outtakes, and it's easy to see why: even though the melodies on both of them seem quite fit for inclusion, the lyrics just don't fall into the scheme: 'Mountain Woman' lyrically is a sequel to 'Apeman' (even though the 'plot' is comparable to 'Here Come The People In Grey'), while 'Kentucky Moon' is sung from a purely 'American' point of view ('never been south of the Delaware'), so I guess Ray was just getting in the mood on these ones. Thanks to Velvel anyway for including them - they're certainly worth a listen. And may I mention here that these re-issues are terrific? They come with great packaging, extensive liner notes and clever bonus tracks. Is Velvel competing with Rhino, I wonder, for the title of 'best Kinks publisher', or is it just a friendly agreement?\n\nREADER COMMENTS SECTION\n\nEVERYBODY'S IN SHOW-BIZ\n\nYear Of Release: 1972\n\nRecord rating = 8\n\nOverall rating = 12\n\nMore of the same, really, but you know sequels tend to get a little worse...\n\nBest song: CELLULOID HEROES\n\nTrack listing: 1) Here Comes Yet Another Day; 2) Maximum Consumption; 3) Unreal Reality; 4) Hot Potatoes; 5) Sitting In My Hotel; 6) Motorway; 7) You Don't Know My Name; 8) Supersonic Rocket Ship; 9) Look A Little On The Sunnyside; 10) Celluloid Heroes; 11) Top Of The Pops; 12) Brainwashed; 13) Mr Wonderful; 14) Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues; 15) Holiday; 16) Muswell Hillbilly; 17) Alcohol; 18) Banana Boat Song; 19) Skin And Bone; 20) Baby Face; 21) Lola; [BONUS TRACKS;] 22) Till The End Of The Day; 23) She's Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina.\n\nThis is a double album, half-live, half-studio (oh boy, where are we?
