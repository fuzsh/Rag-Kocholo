Give the people what they want Well, it's been said before, the world is a stage A different performance with every age. Open the history book to any old page Bring on the lions and open the cage. Give the people what they want You gotta give the people what they want The more they get, the more they need And every time they get harder and harder to please The Roman promoters really did things right. They needed a show that would clearly excite. The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight Threw the Christians to the lions, sold out every night Give the people what they want You gotta give the people what they want The more they get, the more they need And every time they get harder and harder to please Give 'em lots of sex, perversion and rape Give 'em lots of violence, and plenty to hate Give the people what they want Give the people what they want When Oswald shot Kennedy, he was insane But still we watch the re-runs again and again We all sit glued while the killer takes aim\n\nWatch: New Singing Lesson Videos Can Make Anyone A Great Singer\n\n8 fans\n\nSheet Music PDF Playlist\n\nWritten by: RAY DAVIES\n\nLyrics © BMG Rights Management\n\nLyrics Licensed & Provided by LyricFind"
