Jimmy Page thinks he was the firstperson in the world to ever put a B string where a G string should be.And for me, that's his only claim to fame. Other than that, I thinkhe's an asshole. You see, when there was a new pop group like theKinks, you got all sorts of people coming to the sessions and wantingto sit in. There were a lot of groups going around at the time—theYardbirds, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones—and nobody had really crackedwith a sort of R&B number one record. The songs were always sort oflike the Beatles. When we first wanted to do a record, we couldn't geta recording gig. We were turned down by Decca, Parlophone, EMI and evenBrian Epstein came to see us play and turned us down. So I startedwriting songs like \"You Really Got Me\", and I think there was a sheerjealousy that we did it first. Because we weren't a greatgroup—untidy—and we were considered maybe a bit of a joke. But for somereason, I'd just had dinner, shepherd's pie, at my sister's house, andI sat down at the piano and played da, da, da, da, da. The funny thingis it was influenced by Mose Allison more than anybody else. And Ithink there was a lot of bad feeling. I remember we went to clubs likethe Marquee, and those bands wouldn't talk to us because we did it first\n\nYoumust know the story of \"You Really Got Me\". It was recorded first atPye with a producer who made it sound like Phil Spector, and there wasno way that I was going to let them put it out. I said I'd leave themusic business first because I'd never write another song like it. Inthe end, they gave us 200 pounds—which is like 400 bucks—to re-recordit. We went into a cheap little studio, and on the session was MickAvory on drums, Dave Davies playing lead guitar—playing a Harmonyguitar which was like a cheap version of a Gibson—I was playing a Matonwhich is a cheap version of a Harmony. I had a Wallace amplifier whichwas custom built. Dave was using a Vox and a little six watt pre-ampwith knitting needles stuck in it. We had Arthur Greenslade—a sessionpianist—on piano, and a guy named Vic who was doubling my part becauseI was singing lead. So there were three guitars and a piano doing theriff. And for all I know, Jimmy Page must have been having dinner withhis mother that night.\n\nJimmyPage and a lot of other people subsequently came to our sessions whenwe became hot, and I think he played rhythm 12-string on \"I'm A Lover,Not A Fighter\", and he played tambourine on \"Long Tall Shorty\". JonLord, the organist of Deep Purple, played organ on ‘Bald Headed Woman’.The curious thing is I wrote a song called \"Revenge\" which had a rifflike \"You Really Got Me\". Our publisher at the time was a man namedLarry Page. To get a part of the action—this was a real con trick—heregistered the song as a co-composer, and he wasn't even on the sessionfor the demo. So maybe the fact that Larry Page was credited asco-composer of Revenge\" adds some substantial evidence to Jimmy Page'sclaim.\n\nIremember Page coming to one of our sessions when we were recording \"AllDay And All Of The Night\". We had to record that song at 10 o'clock inthe morning because we had a gig that night. It was done in threehours. Page was doing a session in the other studio, and he came in tohear Dave's solo, and he laughed and he snickered. And now he says thathe played it! So I think he's an asshole, and he can put all the curseshe wants on me because I know I'm right and he's wrong. He's anasshole. Dave is a great guitar player. He's got his limitations, buthe's never been given justice for doing that. He made that when he was16-years-old. He created a sound, and after that came Jimi Hendrix andall the fuzz boxes.\n\nFrom http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/Kinks/UnravelsTheKinks001.html\n\nPagey, on the other hand has always shown his generosity, and spoke highly of Ray's skills as a musician.\n\nSHEL TALMY Shel Talmy was one of the most important and influential rock producers of the 1960s. Raised in Chicago and trained as a recording engineer in Los Angeles, he moved to Britain in 1962, bluffed his way into a producer position at Decca Records, and soon became one of the U.K.'s first independent producers. Most famous for his work on the earliest discs by the Kinks and the Who, he also produced dozens of other artists of the era, including the Pentangle, Manfred Mann, the Easybeats, David Bowie (when the singer was still known as David Jones), and cult acts such as the Creation and Rumpelstiltskin.\n\nHow did some of the groups you produced react to having sessionmen on their recordings? There's been a big controversy over whether Jimmy Page played solos on Kinks records, for example.\n\nYou know how many times I've answered that question? I wish I had a buck for each one. Jimmy Page did not play the solo on \"You Really Got Me,\" he played rhythm guitar. He never played anything but rhythm guitar on that plus [the Kinks'] first album session. On \"You Really Got Me,\" the Kinks had just added Mick [Avory], and I used Bobby Graham on drums. He played rhythm guitar because at the time Ray would not play rhythm guitar, he didn't think he was good enough. So I said, fine, let me get a rhythm guitarist, 'cause Dave [Davies] was playing the leads. We had Jon Lord on organ.\n\n...this from a 1977 interview with Jimmy Page conducted by Steven Rosen:\n\nYou were also doing all sorts of things with feedback?\n\nJP: You know, “I Need You” (Kinkdom) by the Kinks? I think I did that bit there in the beginning. I don’t know who really did feedback first; it just sort of happened. I don’t think anybody consciously nicked it from anybody else. It was just going on. But Pete Townshend (lead guitarist with the Who) obviously was the one, through the music of his group, who made the use of feedback more his style, and so it’s related to him. Whereas the other players like Jeff and myself were playing more single note things than chords.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSo far as I know Jimmy's never claimed to have performed the solo on 'You Really Got Me', but his involvement as a rhythm guitarist on that session and others is irrefutable. I seriously doubt The Kink's song 'Session Man' is a direct\n\nreference to Jimmy Page, rather it is a reference to session musicians in general. Interesting to note the 2007 release\n\nof Led Zeppelin's 'The Song Remains The Same' dvd had to be recalled because of copyright infringement - The Kink's\n\n'You Really Got Me' had not been removed as background music during the Cameron Crowe interview of Page done\n\naround the time of the film's original theatrical release. If I recall correctly, Jimmy's comments then are consistent with what Shel Talmy said more recently (in the post above) - that Jimmy was on rhythm guitar."
