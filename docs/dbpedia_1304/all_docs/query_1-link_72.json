        "text": "Yes, Word of Mouth and especially Dave's Living On a Thin Line rates right up there with their best, imo. I'm also tempted to add the Low Budget album to the list (even though it's technically 1979) just because it feels like the beginning of the 80s in Kinks land.\n\nInteresting how much opinions vary. I've always thought their Arista period was clearly a big step back up after falling down quite a bit during the RCA years. Arista is second only to the Reprise years, imo. But as always to each his own.\n\nExceptional albums, some of my favorite of their entire catalog. It causes me a little agony thinking that these will never get their rerelease due. Somehow The Kinks story has been rewritten in such a way that the only records we celebrate are Arthur and Village Green. Take a look at nearly any Kinks setlist, right through to 1996, and you will see that those albums were not recognized as classics even by the band. If they were to reunite, the audience would expect 3/4 of the setlist to be VGPS and Arthur. I'm glad The Kinks are remembered at all, but the revision means that these later works - because they don't sound like the end of the 60's will likely never get the reevaluation they deserves. Do it Again, Destroyer, and especially Come Dancing received vastly more radio attention than anything on the more revered albums.\n\nGive the People, State of Confusion, and Word of Mouth are often my go-to Kinks. Ray's writing was so incisive and, along with Low Budget, he dabbles with political content (which is rare for him) - but as always, he does it through the lens of the working classes. The production is forthright and direct, and the band plays with intensity. These really are incredible (near) hard rock songs.\n\nStrictly covering the two albums mentioned by the OP, they're typical of their Arista period. Arena-rock with just enough unique touches that they still sound like Kinks records, but the albums are kind of uneven.\n\nThere are some strong songs in there -- \"Around The Dial\", \"Add It Up\" (their most effective foray into new-wave), \"Better Things\", \"State of Confusion\", \"Come Dancing\", \"Heart Of Gold\", \"Young Conservatives\" are my favorites of the bunch.\n\nSome of them are tuneless sludge -- the title track to Give The People, \"Back To Front\", 'Definite Maybe\".\n\nThe rest are at least listenable. Not bad, overall.\n\n\"Destroyer\" was the first Kinks song I ever heard. When I first heard \"All Day And All Of The Night\" a few months later, I remember thinking, \"where have I heard that before?\""
