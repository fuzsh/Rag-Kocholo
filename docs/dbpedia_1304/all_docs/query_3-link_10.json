Don't say I didn't warn you!!\n\nIntroduction\n\nGustavo Rodriguez <rodblanc@webtv.net> (14.05.99)\n\nC'mon, George! Give 'em a five. Sure they haven't had a real triumph since Muswell Hillbillies but who cares? They still have a formidable body of work that to this day is not properly appreciated and recognized. For me, the Kinks are more important than the Who (give them a four instead) and rank only behind the Beatles and sometimes the Stones when it comes to my favorite Brit invasion bands.\n\nAnd also they are Rock's true survivors. Theirs is probably the only major 60's band whose original members are all still alive! The Kinks rule!\n\n<SSkanless@aol.com> (25.01.2000)\n\nI think your reviews of these Kinks albums are really misleading. You're obviously are not a fan of them. Just for the record, Ray Davies was one of the best songwriters ever. Not only did he inspire what would soon to be punk rock (re: David Bowie, Marc Bolan, two of punk's innovators, and many more to come...) , his songs are distinct, celebrating a most unique and innovative voice in rock and roll. The Kinks have always been shunned from the respectable eye by the likes of boring, unadventurous critics as yourself. It's critics like you, that have no dynamic tatse for the avante garde and originality, that have dismissed the Kinks all along. The Kinks were brilliant artists trapped in a time when everything else sucked (hippie-movement, make love, not war , 60's bullshit). The Kinks were the only good thing (besides Pink Floyd) to come from the 60's as far as many people everywhere are concerned. (Of course, I'm talking about the Kink's work 1964-1969). But that's all I have to say. After reading your outrageous reviews, it angered me a bit. I felt compelled to write. So please print this, because it's the only pointer to the truth about The Kinks.\n\n[Special author note: Sigh. Cough. Another sigh. Ladies and gentlemen, the defence rests its case.]\n\n<FMorri6969@aol.com> (15.03.2000)\n\nThe Kinks have a great knack at making songs that you like to listen to only after hearing the songs for a little while. There very personal and to the heart. To me there is no such thing as a Kinks greatest hits. The reason being that every album as such continuity that it takes you to a different place that worth repeat listening. I saw Dave Davies on June 22nd 1999 at a bar in Albany NY called Valentines. I was right up front and it was the best!\n\nLanny <Kinksfan64@aol.com> (30.04.2000)\n\nI started out as a BEATLES fan -- then something happen when I bought the KINK S KONTROVERSY album late in l965 -- the mood of that album, the voice of the lead singer -- to this day I dont know what happen - but thats when I became a DEDICATED KINKS FAN -- as of this moment I cant wait for the new solo cd by RAY DAVIES comes out -- ray, through the years has been like an older brother to me ( I was the oldest of 4 brothers) -- I remember back in the 70's when the radio stations werent playing kink songs -- songs from pres act 1 and 2, soap opera, schoolboys, and even sleepwalker -- at least to me, they werent getting the same respect as the who and stones, etc.... Ray came to San Antonio in l998 and saw the show and he sings better now than he did in the 60's -- anyway I got his autograph and shook his hand -- ticket stub is framed with an original yrgm album and a cd of vgps (hanging on my wall) -- awesome!!!!! -- I have a couple of beefs that have been bugging me for a long time -- first -- recently ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE listed the kinks as one of the greatest rock bands in the 20th century -- THATS COOL -- but then , why , in my mind, werent the kinks (as a group) EVER on the cover of rolling stone????? I realize that ray was on a cover , I believe in l974 ---- just doesnt make any sense to me at all --- and finally, why werent 'TO THE BONE' and 'ONLY A DREAM' radio hits?????? Again, to me they are both MODERN DAY KINK KLASSICS !!!!!! ---THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME --- Lanny\n\n<WhoJonGalt@aol.com> (12.06.2000)\n\nRay changed my life. Literally. His song 'NATIONAL HEALTH' and 'SKIN AND BONE' forced me to look at my life and change it. Every day now I excercise to work out the tension, and drop 90 pounds (six and a half stone to you English blokes) Kept it off for two years. This poet speaks to the human condition better than any songwriter before or since. Frank Zappa said 'Wisdom is not truth, truth is not beauty, beauty is not love, love is not music, music is the best!' and the best music is by the boys from north London. I had the unique chance to see Ray in Cleveland do his one-man show that ultimately became his STORYTELLER CD. I have read his book. Unique and well written. From the early stuff to the latest releases, it only gets better. Bravo, Mr. Davies! Next time in Cleveland I would love to buy you a beer and ask you about a thousand questions.\n\nRichard Hall <richard@jimhall.freeserve.co.uk> (09.07.2000)\n\nWell you've certainly put a lot of effort into reviewing all the albums, so well done for that, you're wrong nearly all the time, of course, but without people too venomously disagree with life would be plain dull, wouldn't it? I think some of your problems stem from the fact that you don't understand what some of the songs are actually about, not your fault, you're not English, but it does give you a somewhat inaccurate take in certain situations. I'll address the main ones when I send you individual comments for all of the albums. However, as a short thing 'Harry Rag' is about Cigarettes, not pot, Harry Rag is cockney rhyming slang for Fag, which, in turn, is British slang for cigarettes.\n\nPersonally I think you approach most of the 70's stuff from completely the wrong angle, you seem to want a certain type of Rock-and Roll and when you don't get it you just call things crap. Fair enough, it's your taste, and so, in your opinion, correct, however, you do seem to have a tendency of putting it forward as fact, which is a bit misleading. As I said I disagree with you on most things, where I don't though is your general opinions on VGPS and Arthur, though you seem to have got the plot somewhat confused on the later. They are definitely both my top two albums and do, in general, give a lot.\n\nIf you, or anyone, wanted to actually understand some of the songs more I would recommend getting X-Ray by Ray Davies, it does help to give a better perspective and lets you enjoy songs that much more. Richard Hall.\n\n<Ripley50@aol.com> (30.07.2000)\n\nI have always enjoyed the Kinks' music immensely. I lost out on the group somewhat when their music failed to crack the AM radio stations. I heard \"Dead End Street\" and \"Waterloo Sunset\" just a couple of times on the radio, which was quite frustrating. Then, I heard '20th Century Man.\" What a great record. I bought Muswell Hillbillies immediately. Unfortunately, no tunes with the high intensity of '20th Century,' but still a great album. Most of their albums, while musically frustrating at times, are still fun. Most of them take several listens, but then really grab me. (I'm still surprised at the weak Misfits-- 3 or 4 great songs (such as 'Get Up'), but nothing more). Even, Kinda Kinks, which our reviewer dismissed, is a great album. And I even like all those juvenile songs, such as 'Wonder Where My Baby is Tonight.' I loved the selection of 'Nothin' in The World Can Stop Me Worryin' Bout that Girl' for the Rushmore soundtrack. Finally, a word on Phobia. Am I the only person in the world who loved this album? Every song is rocking and fun. I played this record over and over. 'Over the Edge' immediately caught my attention and 'Surviving' is a great song. Oh, well, I guess if I actually love the Kinks' music, then my musical taste is somewhat suspect anyway.\n\n<Jabtot@aol.com> (09.08.2000)\n\nI guess I was looking for something a bit more in depth when I purchased my first Kinks LP.I had traveled the discography road of my beloved Fab Four four at least a decade.My attraction to the Kinks sees to come from the almost urban songwriting style of Ray Davies.It seemed much more plausable that I could sit at a bar and have a cold beer with Ray Davies,than with Paul McCartney.Although some of the early work was a bit weak,I enjoyed songs like\"People Taking Pictures Of Each Other\",I Remember Walter,and my favorite \" The Last Of The Steam Powered Trains\". Only after listening to the Kinks did I have a bigger appreaciation of the Fabs.The Kinks also opened my ears to The Who and other Brit bands for my enjoyment.God Save Ray Davies!!.......I still want to have that beer if he's interested!\n\nWarren Gray <warrengray@yahoo.com> (05.09.2000)\n\nray davies could be called the best songwriter ever. i dont understand why the kinks were never as famous as the beatles! i am only 17 years old and i try to learn more about this stuff so often. i have had the privlidge of seeing ray davies live 2 times (the first and second storyteller tours) my dad is a pretty big kinks fan. unfortunatly this was before i had even heard of the village green or aurthur. now i do remember him mentioning something about their album not being released in america, or maybe that they couldnt tour in america. and how popular were they in the UK in the 60's and 70's?\n\nhere's what i own- village green preservation society, arthur (both on cds), muxwell hillbillies and preservation act 1 (on record). what should i get next? i like village green more than aurthur. every song is amazing to me.\n\nVSDFV Klaipedos skyrius <klaipeda@sodra.lt> (15.09.2000)\n\nyeah, five for ray, no doubts. and you know what, george? i think ray deserves to be named a genius. that's why. he never repeat the same mood in his songs. i'm not talking about the same instrumental line or the same melody line. it's the mood. so. i'm living in lithuania (not far from you, George) and it's a shame that no one knows about ray in my basketball country.\n\nThomas M. Silvestri <cc3000@earthlink.net> (23.09.2000)\n\nI bought the singles of \"Dead End Street,\" \"Mr. Pleasant,\" and \"Waterloo Sunset\" back to back to back in late '66 and early '66 and summer '66, all of which bombed in America. At the time I couldn't understand it, being just a 12-year-old kid who loved all kinds of rock 'n' roll. In retrospect, the other thing that was happening at the time -- Hendrix and Cream -- simply made it hard for many other people to hear anything other than Sgt. Pepper. And of all the bands who suffered most obviously in commercial terms from the increase in sheer bass, treble, volume, and in many cases (most obviously Hendrix) brilliance, none suffered more than the Kinks. It wasn't until '72 or so when, yes, thanks very much to British progressive rock, English quirkiness became big business again in the U.S. and stuff like Muswell Hillbilly could not only get on the radio but also attract people at concert halls (even if the Kinks didn't entirely stop throwing away shows until a few years later).\n\nP.S. [Waterloo Sunset]: The U.S. release date on this 45 was, of course, around June of '67, not 66 as I previously said.\n\nEric Peltoniemi <production@redhouserecords.com> (01.11.2000)\n\nThe Kinks are one of the few bands that began in the 60s that I still enjoy. Like many others, I started that decade in the folk revival, a fan of the Kingston Trio & Pete Seeger, and gradually \"hippified\" myself and ended up a Dylan fan. I also loved the Beatles and Stones and thought they were the pinnacle. I bought the first Kinks album when it was first came out and loved it, but when Kontroversy came out a bell went off in my head...probably during \"Till the End of the Day.\" Since then I haven't been the same. Over the ensuing 36+ years, I have had less and less patience with purposely obscure lyrics and their pseudo-communication (goodbye Bob & scores of navel-gazing singer/songwriters)...and less and less attraction to the Beatles (smarmy, shallow, arrogant) and the Stones (perverse and in it for the money). The Kinks were and are the best. Human and clear. Great melodies, words, concepts and ideas. Their eye on the common man.\n\nRay may have not always polished a song to total perfection (although he frequently did), but give me that repertoire anytime. At 51 I am still listening to it...all of it. My chestnuts may be hey-day albums like Village Green or Something Else, but \"Lost and Found,\" \"Heart of Gold,\" and songs from the later albums are wondeful as well. I have enjoyed Ray's book and his one man show. I just plain love the Kinks. I love Ray's writing. My only suggestion to him at this stage of life is to record a complete album of his favorite 20th Century pop classics...the kind he and his dad used to sing in the front room. He just knocked me out with his rendition of \"Old Black Magic.\" Did anyone else notice how great that track was?\n\nrmpi <mostienr@pi.be> (17.11.2000)\n\nThat does it. Not only do you tear down the walls of the Kinkdom. You also fill the web with factless facts!\n\n'Session man' dedicated to N. Hopkins? Whatever gave you that idea? [The fact that Nicky Hopkins played as a session man on that particular album. Eh? - G. S.]\n\nWhere did you get the information on Jimmy Page playing on the songs on Kinks? [From the credits list - G. S.]. Dave was better all the way and cheaper to use in the studio, which was crucial at the time. He lacked some studioexperience at the beginning but he sounded great. The early Kinks sound an awful lot better than the yardbirds featuring Page ever did! Anyway, there's your real sessionman!\n\n'Mr. Pleasant' for your information didn't badly flop, as you put it. The single was directed towards the continent, where it was a hit more than a few countries.\n\nFirst do your research, then write!\n\nkind regards\n\nrm\n\nThomas M. Silvestri <cc3000@earthlink.net> (03.12.2000)\n\nWhile it's always good to see passion for great rock 'n' roll -- in this case \"rm\" re the Kinks -- I have to step in to defend George's responsible monitoring of this site. I've read more than a few articles over the years in which Ray himself says that Nicky Hopkins indeed inspired the song \"Session Man,\" the most recent being a column Ray wrote for, if memory serves, The New York Times Sunday Magazine shortly after Hopkins' death. As for the would-be correction on the commercial success of \"Mr. Pleasant,\" I do recall it was something of a minor hit \"on the continent,\" as rm puts it. But the key phrase in my comments was \"in America,\" where all three of the singles I mentioned most certainly bombed. My brother used to bring home Billboard magazine every week in those days and I read it voraciously. I don't think \"Mr. Pleasant\" even made the mag's \"Bubbling Under the Top 100\" chart back in Spring '67. (\"Dead End Street,\" I believe, stalled out in America somewhere around 60.) Those whose curiosity extends further on such things can always check Joel Whitburn's books, which compile the Billboard charts of those years. But there would seem to be no denying the failure of the three singles that I cited (and many more for years afterward) in America, even in Ray's mind: at a show in the U.S. just last year, when people called out for \"Big Black Smoke\" and \"Harry Rag\" (U.S. B-sides of \"Dead End Street\" and \"Mr. Pleasant\" respectively), Ray shot back, \"You people are INSANE! You're calling out for B-SIDES of SINGLES THAT FAILED!\"\n\nThomas McKeown <t.mckeown@cns.norfolk.sch.uk> (11.12.2000)\n\nJust thought I'd give my opinions on the effect of the Kinks on modern British music. Essentially, the Kinks are the most influential British band, ever. Oh, I know the Beatles should claim that title, but, just as you consider Hendrix appart from other guitarists, so it is with the Beatles; their prescence looms so large, we can put them to one side in a class of their own. The Kinks, however, created, as you say, a unique style no-one else at the time could do, and, as you also point out, this style had its roots in the very fact of being British, and thus made the Kinks the most British band ever. What this did was to show British musicians that they didn't have to be ashamed of being British (or rather I should say, English), and that rock music was not compatable with traditional British values. This legacy has been found cropping up throughout all pop movements since, and has made Bitain one of the few countries in the world (Germany is the other one) who've created avision of rock that differs substantially from the American ground plan. Because that this style is more about atitude and stance than musical technique, and because there hardly ever seems to be more than one band practising it at any one time, this style has been far from exhausted, and bands such as The Jam and Blur, with there own take on the Kinks formular, are just as fresh and original as the Kinks were in there heyday.\n\n<JJFSFTD68@aol.com> (06.05.2001)\n\nThese guys are probably my favorite band, next to the Stones. I think I like them even more than the Beatles. I've always had a soft spot for the folksy, dance hall style that Ray prefers. These guys aren't the best of musicians, although I do think they were pretty good. I think I'd rank them behind only Dylan, the Beatles and the Stones on a list of the greatest acts of Rock and Roll. I'm putting them ahead of the Who because, frankly, I think Ray Davies was a better songwriter than Pete Townshend. Nothing against Pete, his genius is not indispute but I do believe on the whole the Kinks had a superior catalog to the Who. I think the Kinks easily the most underrated band in Rock and Roll history. Their classic period of 66 to 71 is one of the greatest runs ever and there is a lot of great material from the 70s and even into the 80s.(Word Of Mouth from 84 is their best album since Muswell Hillbillies.) Overall, I think they deserve a 5.\n\nGuilherme Nettesheim <deyeomeedeez@yahoo.com> (10.02.2004)\n\nOh, come on now George. We know that deep down inside you want to see the Kinks get a 5. I mean, I understand why you'd wanna cut them down for adequacy and resonance because of the late seventies stuff, but come on, you can up originality up a point can't ya? Or how about upping resonance? Even with their crap albums their releasing now, I don't think it's fair to penalize them for it. Specially when you have albums ike Arthur, Muswell Hillbillies, Village Green, etc.\n\n\"Waterloo Sunset\", probably the most beatiful song I have ever heard, \"Some Mother's Son\" the most touching and melancholy song ever made, Village Green with all of it's small town looks and simple melodies, hell I could go on for ever. Don't you shed a tear upon hearing \"Death of a Clown\"? Or what about \"20th Century Man\", the best conservative anthem ever created? Man, if one band is resonant, then it's the Kinks, despise the shitty '70's albums. So please, reconsider the rating for The Kinks, either on Originality or Resonance. You kncoked Dylan up, you can do the same for Mr. Davies now can't you?\n\nSergey Zhilkin <z-h-i-l-k-i-n@yandex.ru> (24.03.2004)\n\nOk, so it's an anniversary today - 3 years ago I bought a 2CD Kinks EP collection. Since then I've been introduced to a great ammount of bands with genres ranging from shameless pop to industrial to electronica to grunge to whatever. But you know, looking back I realise that the most of catchy as hell songs I've heard during these years were written by Kinks. I remember that I used to get tired of Kinks, then, few months later, I again started listening to Arthur, Village green and Muswell hillbillies. Dunno, I think the Kinks is the band for me. And I admit - I have a strange passion for Kinks, call me fanatic if you want. I think I'm gonna buy new Ray Davies album (if it's gonna be released in this century) even at the price of $40. There're a lot of bands which have a lot of interesting things to offer, but the Kinks have something dear to my heart unlike the rest. This might sound stupid but even after hearing all of their 80s albums and Phobia I have to say that I still put Kinks at the second spot in my list of best bands ever. After the solo Dave Davies, of course!! Nah, The Beatles, I mean. (I'm not a big fan of 'best-of' lists, though, so you don't get any runner-ups.) Oh, these Kinks. London squares, fancy clothes, dedicated followers of fashion, yes sir, no sir, 20-th century men, schoolboys in disgrace, nostalgia, afternoon tea, music hall - this is my cup of tea, yes sir. Ray Davies could pull out witty lyrics without getting angry (a thing I hate about most young bands that spit on goverment). Also he wasn't a protest singer by any means. I mean, until the late 70s - early 80s when he started to act very straightforward, that's it (\"Sold out\" lyrics for sale! Anybody?).\n\nEven though all of 70s albums do have filler, I wouldn't rate any of them less than 10 or maybe 11, because man - I dig the image Ray created for himself (he's must be a total asshole in life, though). So yes, I'm happy to gobble down \"Soap opera\" and \"Preservation\", even realising that both have a lot of musical flaws.\n\nFortunately, the Kinks are not too overshadowed as you claim them to be. Damon Albarn from Blur must adore them. No, no, I meant Kinks, not Them! Suede and Elastica members probably like them, too, and hide singles collection underneath pillows. No, no, I meant Kinks again, forget about Them. Heck, even Van Morrison has a crush on them! And it's good to see quite a lot of people still remember Davies brothers (just look at this comments page!).\n\nAlexey Provolotsky <alpro@tut.by> (16.09.2005)\n\nThe Kinks have always been special to me. There is something about Ray Davies that is very humble and attractive. And warm. I absolutely adore his image: a simple, intelligent guy. A cute guy. Once a good friend of mine suggested that Mr. Davies must be a perfect bandleader. Yeah, I also feel that way. He is so damn charming! Besides that, hes a genius. I dont know if he was actually better than Lennon and McCartney rolled into one, but at some point he probably was. After all, we dont know what kind of an album McCartney would make alone in, say, 1966 or 1967. Probably an amazing one, but we can only guess. What we know is that from 1966 till 1971 Ray could not fail. Unforgettable melodies, wise lyrics, cozy and charming English voice. How can that fail? No way. He, together with Bob Dylan, was one of those rare artists who were always very close to you. Before I turn to the minor (sorry, guys, but thats a fact) members of the band, I would like to note that I consider Raymous Douglas Davies (very pompous, but I like how it sounds) the third greatest songwriter that music has been able to produce, after Pete Townshend and John Lennon.\n\nAs for the other guys, I would obviously mention Rays younger brother, Dave. Ive never heard his solo realeases, but his contributions to the Kinks catalogue were, for the most part, worthwhile. Death Of A Clown, Lincoln County, Susannahs Still Alive, Strangers. These songs are among the bands best. Also, he was a good guitarist (I love his Arthur solos) and clumsy (not a minus in this very case) singer.\n\nBoth Pete Quaife and John Dalton were quite decent bassists, but Mick Avory was a solid drummer (Wicked Annabella, Situation Vacant, etc.).\n\nI decided to cover their huge catalogue by getting almost all of their 60s output, a couple of the RCA releases (still have only one, though; nice to realize that Im looking for some Kinks records) and their late compilation Come Dancing With The Kinks (it is a must buy if youre not going to get any of their mid-to-late 70s and early 80s albums). Thats probably the best way of getting acquainted with their massive catalogue, but then again, maybe not. If youre new to the Kinks, I would suggest starting with one of their 60s' singles compilations.\n\nNeedless to say, they get the highest rating overall. They have to be given a 5 for resonance! God, I love this band!\n\n<jbrian1@houston.rr.com> (24.05.2006)\n\nI can't really put into words how much I love music in general. I play guitar, write songs, and know a few things on the bass and piano. Ever since I moved for the first time back in 2001 when I was about 12, music has become my right arm. Tapes of \"Who's Greatest Hits\" and \"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\" were my only companions. Thus, I absolutely love music that I can identify with on a personal level, and bands that focus all their energy on the wholeness and quality of the song itself, and also in Ray Davies' case, whole spectacular albums as well.\n\nSo the Kinks have earned a special place in my heart for almost everything about them. They really believed, they focused on the merit of songs/albums rather than virtuosity (which I do like, but don't demand), and they were themselves.\n\nAs you said, many don't like them either because they never jumped on anyone's bandwagon, and that their songs can almost be insipid in their simplicity and childishness. But to me, this allows them to brave all manners of musical disaster, including the worst offender of all: time.\n\nFinally, although I could probably write a doctoral thesis on the many things they do well and have done for me especially, I just completely identify/agree with how ol' Ray sees the world. Like me, he is anti-conflict, he is peaceful, he is conservative to himself but doesn't really care what other people do in the privacy of their own home, he values simplicity and general face-to-face interaction, and adores life. But at the same time, and this is a big clicker, he finds huge personal and societal problems with what can be seen here in America as the 20th and 21st American dream: dollar-driven, materialist, rush-rush, busy-as-a-bee bullshit that exhausts and ultimately ruins the simple pleasures in life. This is something that can only be classified as genius in the way he outlines and portrays it. I don't even think, while still being a true blue American (and kind of a Southerner at that, though not really), that his view is too English to translate into any country's predicament. He supports the \"stiff-upper-lip\" general badassness of British working class tradition, and values those who really work, even though he thinks they should take breaks once in a while. But damn, what a truly expansive musical palette Ray (and Dave, I love Dave too, its just that I'd have to do yet another long-winded aria in his tribute and I'm tired) has! He really knows his shit in A.) All forms of traditional American music and B.) His own native Britain's traditional humor. And shit, the music needs only to be given a good, solid 5 headphone listens at the most for their best period albums (in my humble opinion, '66-'72) to realize his poignancy, effectiveness, and brilliance in what we know in umbrella terms as rock music.\n\nBut really, as I've rambled on and on about, the very fact that they were unafraid to be who they were in all the music they put out and in all the ways that music was performed (even the silly stuff had its own self-effacing humor), defines them point-blank in the best way possible. Warts-and-all, they were the Kinks. And with all that that entails, what they did as the Kinks defined their approach, their music, and themselves to the bitter end for this humble minstrel. (I could show you some of my songs if you want, actually).\n\nTagbo Munonyedi <grimtraveller@hotmail.com> (03.08.2006)\n\nThere have been few artists that kept on going for as many years as the Kinks that remained both relevant, vibrant and creatively stimulating and to be honest, I'm not sure it's ever really happened much {U2, Bruce Cockburn and Larry Norman spring to my mind and even they had troughs}. Even in a genre like jazz which by it's very nature is constantly recreating itself, expanding and supposedly never standing still, the truth is that it's artists get stuck in a groove and get as safe and repetitive as anyone else, though maybe they take longer to get that way. Most artists have a classic phase where they were really on a roll for which they will probably always be revered, quite a few have more than one. Personally, I'm often torn between an artists classic phase and their desire to carry on {which artistically, I applaud} even though they be past their best. I think the Beatles made a tragic error reforming for that brief spell in the mid 90s coz their story was perfect up to that point. On the other hand, the Police did the right thing in splitting when they did. It's arguable whether some artists just go on too long, an argument that may or may not apply to the Kinks. The discovery of them and the heralding of their influence reminds me of the biblical story of ancient Israel's rediscovery of God's law; someone found a copy of it in the palace basement and when it was read, the people said \"Oh my, what have we done, ignoring all this for so many years !\". It is an amusing parallel. For what seemed like a long time, the Kinks were the great forgotten act of British rock, yet they were as fundamental to the changes that swept through the 60s as the Who, the Stones, Dylan or the Beatles, albeit in a different way....I think the years '64 to '70 were their truly classic phase, which shouldn't diminish what came thereafter, it's just that the world that they had been observing was such a different place after 1970 and new acts and moves were in the vanguard and they weren't a high level influence. Some could say that they weren't in the 60s either but I'd disagree vehemently. Because singles were the main highway on which to parade one's musical creativity until that shift which began about '66 saw the album become the main medium, one has to look at the singles that bands were putting out and the Kinks even pushed the Beatles in that department. I don't think the Kinks were a strong album band then, not really through any fault of their own because even the Who, Small Faces and Stones had their blips and unlike the Beatles' producer and record company, their \"employers\" {as they saw it} still flexed muscle. Neither were the Kinks particularly innovative in terms of studio technique but in my opinion, when it comes to brilliant, well written singles, then in the 60s, the Kinks pound for pound are the equals of the Beatles, the Stones and better overall than the Who. Lots of artists put out great singles in that decade {It's not nostalgic rose tinted bias when I say that more great singles came out in that decade~it was a singles market for most of it and singles weren't just a ploy to get you to maybe check out the album the way it later headed. They were an end and entity in themselves and it wasn't at all unusual for the singles not to be found on albums which is why compilations are actually so useful. Without them, unless you have access to 2nd hand shops, you're stuffed !} and while there were flops and dreck, I would say the general quality was pleasingly high. But equally, comparatively few artists put out high numbers of great singles and in my opinion, the Kinks put out at least 18, regardless of chart placing {only one of that number didn't chart} and there were some great album tracks and stuff on EPs {a medium that like the minidisc never really took off}. But the Kinks gave rock two wonderful gifts, one was that guitar sound that came through on their third single, YOU REALLY GOT ME. With TOBACCO ROAD by the Nashville Teens and I WANNA BE YOUR MAN by the Stones and Jimmy Page's use of fuzz boxes, you have the start of the evolution of what went on to be the heavy rock sound. The reason I wouldn't say the Kinks invented that genre is coz they basically never pursued and developed it; they were more expansive than that and what they did develop, their second great gift, was vocal Englishness which is not as cooky as it sounds. A number of groups started actually sounding vocally English after they did and I wonder if Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Wishbone Ash, the Small Faces and even the big three {Beats, Stones, Who} and others would have carried on in sub American accents had it not been for Ray Davies and songs like A WELL RESPECTED MAN, DEDICATED FOLLOWER OF FASHION and SUNNY AFTERNOON. It's revealing listening to Syd Barrett on LUCY LEAVE at the start of '66 and his singing on THE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN and Floyd's early singles~in the space of a year it's completely changed to an English accent and suddenly Englishness isn't just cool to write about, but to sing that way too. MOTHER'S LITTLE HELPER, PICTURES OF LILY, POLYTHENE PAM, LAZY SUNDAY AFTERNOON, and scores of others....I think you can credit the Kinks {and to a lesser extent George Harrison} for that wave and of course it later reached a point where sounding anything but was just passe {think punk, new wave and the British rock and pop of the 80s}. Of course they could be derivative too, taking in Dylan {WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD TIMES GONE ?}, Beatlesque harmonies and backing vocals {I think their underated harmonies are gorgeous}, Who wildness {even though they were around before} and song structures {the way they ape the Beatles' \"Ticket to ride\" ending on \"'til the end of the day\" is priceless !}. Also pretty unique for such an important group from such a tumultuous decade of change is the fact that psychedelia passed them by. It's just as well it did pass the Davies brothers by; Ray had already had a breakdown, long before even Syd Barrett and Brian Epstein; and when Dave did take acid many years later, he began a relationship with aliens from another planet......But they were an influence at the time on English psychedelia, which, in part thanks to them, was majorly concerned with looking backwards to the past and trying to get back to the innocence of the child's eye view. You can hear it in the instruments they used {mellotrons, trumpets} and words like 'almanac' and the pictures they painted of dead end streets, waterloo sunsets and memories of endless days.....if someone told me these were pastoral acid ditties a la Strawberry Fields and I didn't know different, I'd say 'yeah....'. No surprize then, that they're so beloved of Punks, Britpoppers and a whole international host in between.\n\nALBUMS KINKS\n\n<Ogdensgoneflake@aol.com> (28.12.2000)\n\nI guess I'm alone on this one but I kinda like this album. The bad parts are really bad but a handful of bright spots make the album worth a few listens. First there's 'You Really Got Me' and \"Stop Your Sobbin'\". \"I Took My Baby Home\" is a funny little tune, 'Just Can't Go To Sleep' is catchy and 'Revenge' is an OK Instrumental. But out of the original 14 nothing else is very fantastic, in fact anything Dave sings pretty much sucks and I won't even talk about Shel's songs. The bonus tracks make the album better thanks to 'All Day' ... and the others. The only bonus track that is really bad is 'Louie, Louie' because you understand the lyrics.\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (05.05.2002)\n\nThis album is mediocre at best, with few standout tracks. The biggie, of course, is \"You Really Got Me,\" which has been praised and analyzed into the ground. I agree with all the praise, and am tired of the analyses, so I'll just say that, after all these years, it's still an ass-kicker. Each of the remaining songs can fit into one of three basic styles: rockers, ballads and r &b. The only style the Kinks had really mastered at this point (not surprisingly) was rock 'n' roll. Listening to \"Beautiful Delilah\" and \"I'm A Lover Not A Fighter,\" I'm convinced that the Kinks played rock 'n' roll better than most of their British Invasion contemporaries. They were the masters of the rave-up, exemplified by the instrumental breaks in both of these songs. The other rockers are not quite as strong: \"I Took My Baby Home\" is harmless fun; \"Revenge\" is ultra-simple but energetic; \"Too Much Monkey Business\" suffers from a badly double-tracked vocal; \"So Mystifying\" is one-dimensional; and \"Cadillac\" is energetic and a bit odd. The ballad material is mostly '50s-oriented, indicating that Ray Davies hadn't really developed yet as a songwriter. \"Stop Your Sobbing\" is pleasantly catchy and so is \"Just Can't Go To Sleep,\" but both were rendered outdated by A Hard Day's Night (a month before they were even recorded). The r&b material is mostly below average. \"Got Love If You Want It\" is redeemed by some interesting percussion and a midsection rave-up; \"Long Tall Shorty\" is slightly amusing with its 17-year-old grizzled blues singer; \"Bald Headed Woman\" is somewhat dull with a badly double-tracked vocal; and \"I've Been Driving On Bald Mountain\" is virtually nondescript. Not a classic LP by any means.\n\nTo get the maximum number of bonus tracks (12), you'll need to get the Essential Records CD of this album (although, perhaps it's the Rhino CD in Russia? - the US Rhino CD has only three bonus tracks). \"All Day And All Of The Night\" is patterned directly after \"You Really Got Me\" and (miraculously) it's every bit as good. \"It's Alright\" (the B-side of \"You Really Got Me\") sports a jazzy verse with an absolutely frenetic instrumental break, and is one of my favorite early Kinks tracks. \"I Gotta Move\" (the B-side of \"All Day And All Of The Night\") has a good, driving rhythm. The first A-side, \"Long Tall Sally\" is energetic but lame, while the second A-side, \"You Still Want Me\" is Beatlesque and lame. \"You Do Something To Me\" (the B-side of \"You Still Want Me\") is also Beatlesque, but a little more interesting. The tracks from the Kinksize Session EP are mostly weak: \"I've Got That Feeling\" is a nice piano-based ballad; \"I Gotta Go Now\" is kind of cute, I guess, but a bit mundane; \"Things Are Getting Better\" is basically an upbeat throwaway; \"Louie Louie\" is amazingly lifeless. There's also two previously unreleased tracks: \"I Don't Need You Any More\" is an unexceptional pop tune, while the ultra-fast version of \"Too Much Monkey Business\" is downright exhilarating. Overall, the bonus tracks don't improve the picture much.\n\nmike noto <thepublicimage79@hotmail.com> (21.09.2006)\n\nDave used a hollowbody guitar, a Harmony Meteor, on \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night.\" The way he achieved that beautiful, scuzzy, and totally '60's distorted guitar tone on those songs was through buying a small and cheap Elpico amp, which was bright green, and plugging it into his Vox AC30, using it like a primitive preamp. Then he intentionally slashed the cone of the Elpico amp with a razor blade.\n\nActually, fuck it. I'll let Dave himself tell the story:\n\n\"I bought this in a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill in 1962. I couldn't afford a Watkins Dominator or a bigger posher amp! I went home and plugged the Elpico loudspeaker's output leads into the input of the AC 30, in effect using the smaller amp as kind of a pre-amp. It sounded great, but I wasn't satisfied. The crowning glory of my simple yet effective experiment was to slash the speaker cone of the Elpico with a razor blade so that the material, although now shredded, still remained intact with the outer side of the cone. As it vibrated it produced a distorted and jagged roar. In fact, the original set-up was so crude that the main amp's hum was almost as loud as the sound I had created. A sound was born, but I didn't know it at the time. Immediately I started using my set-up in live shows that I performed with Ray and our band, in the time leading up to the creation of the Kinks. Ironically, it was that sound, which we used on 'You Really Got Me,' that got the Kinks our first hit.\" - Excerpt from 'Kink' - An Autobiography by Dave Davies.\n\nFound that on Dave's site. Fun little story, isn't it?\n\nKINDA KINKS\n\nMorten Felgenhauer <Morten.Felgenhauer@kvaerner.com> (02.01.2001)\n\n\"See My Friends\" was released as a single A-side in England at the time of Kinda KInks, and as far as I can remember it made top 20. It's a brilliant song and of course it deserved a better fate. In addition to the \"Indian\" melody and sitar-imitating guitar it uses a bass-drone to good effect. (In Indian classical music there is usually no chords - just one basic bass-note onto which melody and instrumental improvisation is added). In the verses the bass guitar plays just one riff while the chords change around it. The Beatles used the same trick later on \"If I Needed Someone\" on Rubber Soul. I agree with your comments on the first two albums, by the way. It is possible to be a fan of a group and at the same time realize that not evereything the group did was pure genius. (Do you hear me, fanatics?)\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (05.05.2002)\n\nThe main problem with this album is that, while the Kinks' main strength was still in the area of straight rock, we're presented here with mostly ballads. Ray Davies simply wasn't up to scratch in the ballad department (not until later, anyway), and for me, this makes Kinda Kinks a notch or two lower than the first album. There are a couple of happy exceptions. While I'm not too blown away with \"Tired Of Waiting For You,\" I will say that the part of the song where the title is sung is simply sublime. My favorite track, however, is \"You Shouldn't Be Sad,\" which sounds like it could comfortably fit onto the next album. It's upbeat and catchy in a way no previous Kinks song had been, and is virtually the only sign on this release that Davies' songwriting skills had actually progressed. A couple of the other upbeat songs are fairly good, \"Got My Feet On The Ground\" and \"Come On Now,\" but somehow never reach the freneticism of earlier efforts. The two ultra-quiet tunes, \"So Long\" and \"Nothin' In This World Can Stop Me From Adding More Words To This Song Title,\" are both very simple but kinda charming, I guess. \"Look For Me Baby\" starts off reasonably well in a Motown kind of way, but gets really unfocused by the end. Okay, I've run out of good things to say, so here goes with the rest: \"Naggin' Woman\" is thankfully the only r&b song on here, and definitely doesn't redeem the Kinks in that category; \"Wonder Where My Baby Is Tonight\" is a thoroughly unexceptional pop song; \"Dancing In The Street\" is simply a mess; \"Don't Ever Change\" and \"Something Better Beginning\" are both unashamedly corny and I wince every time I hear them. J. Kordosh summed it up best: Kinda Kinks kinda stinks.\n\nThe bonus tracks (on the Essential CD) greatly improve this listening experience. \"Set Me Free,\" I think, is written the way a Britpop ballad is supposed to be written. \"I Need You\" (the B-side of \"Set Me Free\") miraculously copies \"You Really Got Me\" (again!) and succeeds in being an awesome track anyway. \"See My Friends\" is one the best listens on the CD, with its revolutionary raga influence. \"A Well Respected Man\" is also revolutionary, with its social commentary and folky sound (the tune doesn't grab me much, though). \"Don't You Fret\" (also from the EP) is, for me, a bigger signpost of things to come than either of the previous two, and a better song. There's something about it that makes it sound like it could have turned up on Face To Face or even Village Green and nobody would have thought anything of it. The previously unreleased demo version of \"I Go To Sleep\" is a definite highlight, and I consider it to be the best song Davies had written at the time of its recording. The rest don't do much for me: \"Ev'rybody's Gonna Be Happy\" is kinda fun, but a bit jerky;\"Who'll Be The Next In Line\" (the B-side) is one-dimensional; \"Such A Shame\" (from the EP) is moody and somewhat simplistic at the same time; \"Wait Till The Summer Comes Along\" shows that Dave Davies couldn't be Bob Dylan no matter how hard he tried; \"Never Met A Girl Like You Before\" (the B-side of \"See My Friends) is so dorky that it completely deserves its B-side status.\n\nAlexey Provolotsky <alpro@tut.by> (16.09.2005)\n\nKinda Kinks was the third thing by the band I bought, after VGPS and a singles collection. You can imagine my disappointment when I played the record for the first time But, frankly speaking, I got this mostly for a great number of bonus tracks. And I was rewarded.\n\nSpeaking about the album itself, Id say that its kinda good (in a bad sense of word). In fact, only two (!) tracks are essential to your collection: the great lazy ballad Tired Of Waiting For You and the gorgeous Something Better Beginning with a worthwhile hook and gentle guitar work. On the other hand, you wont find anything offensive here, with the exception of Dave-sung Nagging Woman, which is a bit annoying. The other tracks that I enjoy best of all are probably that nice folkish one with a long title and You Shouldnt Be Sad (what the hell? Its catchy!). The others are decent, but absolutely not interesting.\n\nSo, lets concentrate on the marvellous bonus tracks. The poppy Set Me Free, the oozy See My Friends (I dont quite see why it is psychedelic, but Ive had enough of arguing what IS psychedelic and what is NOT), the singalong Such A Shame, the catchy-as-heck A Well Respected Man are all definite early Kinks classics. Plus, the closing I Go To Sleep is a very emotional tear-inducing ballad. I love it.\n\n10/15 for the album and a 12/15 for the bonus tracks. Ray hasnt arrived yet.\n\nTHE KINK KONTROVERSY\n\n<Lanny1949@aol.com> (28.02.2001)\n\nI love Kink Kontroversy, its the album that made me ADDICTED to the kinks in l965 -- the mood of rays voice in each song was awesome -- \"flash to the future, TO THE BONE and ONLY A DREAM are kink klassics in my book\"\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (05.05.2002)\n\nThe Kinks at the Krossroads. Most of the highlights on this one point to the future, while most of the low points lean on the past. Perhaps the most solid-sounding thing on the album is \"Till The End Of The Day,\" which simultaneously echoes the power-chord hits of their past and injects a more melodic edge and jet-set guitar solo. It's excellent B-side, \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone,\" has a great two-part vocal harmony and with some interesting lyrics. I'm also very fond of \"The World Keeps Going Round,\" with its droll vocal delivery and strong bassline, as well as \"I'm On An Island,\" which almost sounds like a Village Green track. There's also something appealing about \"You Can't Win,\" with its snide vocal harmonies, but I think it leans towards the many lesser tunes here. \"Milk Cow Blues\" carries a certain amount of intensity, and tops every other R&B tune they did, but that's not saying much. \"Gotta Get The First Plane Home\" is enjoyable enough - mainly in the rhythm department. The rest of the songs are generally weak: \"When I See That Girl Of Mine\" is catchy, but sappy; \"It's Too Late\" is simplistic; \"Ring The Bells\" is achingly dull; \"What's In Store For Me\" is totally forgettable; and \"I Am Free\" is Dave Davies' second failed attempt at being Bob Dylan. I guess I'd rate this about as highly as the first album, so it's an improvement over the last one.\n\nThe bonus tracks on the Essential CD do nothing to improve the picture, partly because there's only four of them. \"Dedicated Follower Of Fashion\" is the second of the Kinks' folksy hits, and I've always found it to be a rather obnoxious song. The B-side, \"Sitting On My Sofa,\" is little more than a riff. The demo version of \"When I See That Girl Of Mine\" is not as good as the official version, so it ain't much. (It was actually recorded at about the time of \"I Go To Sleep\" from the previous CD and given to Bobby Rydell before the Kinks did it). For some reason, we also get a stereo mix of \"Dedicated Follower Of Fashion\" with a different vocal track, but I'm not sure why we needed it.\n\nBrian Donovan <RAILGUITAR@aol.com> (01.07.2005)\n\nLet's start with what some see as \"low points.\" \"When I See That Girl Of Mine\" is a favorite for me because I like songs that have that drive, where the guitars and rhythm section are just locked in sync. The song seems idiotically simple, but how many bands really were able to pull this sound off. (George, we also had this same disagreement over the Beatles' \"Hold Me Tight.\") I get a kick out of \"It's Too Late\" because of the perverse guitar that Shel Talmy insisted on playing, and dialing up in the mix so it crowds everything else out. It's so loudly and proudly amateurish, you wonder if this was a clever trick Ray was playing on Shel and Shel doesn't get it?\n\nAs I look over the song list, it strikes me that what seem to be other \"weak\" tunes actually have something going for them, usually a strong hook or that hard edge to the electric guitar that made the \"garage band\" era Kinks stand out (\"Gotta Get The First Plane Home,\" \"What's In Store For Me.\")\n\nThe really good stuff is clustered toward the middle. \"The World Keeps Going Round\" had that same laid back vocal that made \"Tired Of Waiting For You\" work. I like that sparkling piano that comes in on \"I'm On An Island\"...bet it's Nicky Hopkins, an old hero of mine. \"Where Have All The Good Times Gone?\" is a great punkish performance, and Dave's guitar soloing has improved drastically for \"Til The End Of The Day\" and the opener \"Milk Cow Blues.\" (incidently, check out the Ricky Nelson version of \"Milk Cow\" which had James Burton on lead guitar for an interesting contrast in style.)\n\nI only started collecting Kinks CDs in the last two years and a lot of this was a revelation to me even though it's 30-40 years old. Sounds like Kink Kontroversy was the end of the Kinks' initial garage band phase, especially in light of the subsequent Face To Face and its successors. Of course the later releases have their own highlights, but Kink Kontroversy has a kick to it that wasn't really revisited.\n\nAlexey Provolotsky <alpro@tut.by> (16.09.2005)\n\nIf youre going to buy one Kinks album from their early period, it has to be Kink Kontroversy. This album is good (in a good sense of word). Milk Cow Blues sounds rather sloppy, but really cool. Ring The Bells, I Am Free, Im On An Island are all charming ballads. The hit was Till The End Of The Day, which is extremely catchy and all, but its Where Have All The Good Times Gone that is the best here. The melody and the vocals simply rule. Ray creates some great pessimistic atmosphere with his slow vocal delivery. Its amazing! Finally, the last three tracks let the album down a bit, but theyre still decent enough to be enjoyable.\n\nWe dont have that many bonus cuts this time, but Dedicated Follower Of Fashion is a great melodic tune dealing with narcissism. And Sitting On My Sofa is just a typical early Kinks rocker.\n\nThe album shows some artistic growth (both in music and in lyrics), its obvious. A highish 11/15. Ray is already knocking on your door.\n\nFACE TO FACE\n\nIvan Piperov <zwetan@stud.uni-frankfurt.de> (01.03.2000)\n\nThis is the third album I bought of the year 1966. The other ones being The Mothers' Freak Out and the other Revolver. But Face To Face doesn't impress me like these aforementioned masterpieces as I hoped. Nearly half of the tunes are somewhat bland and unoriginal and the sound is too dated. Nevertheless I really like the first half plus the bonus tracks.\n\nBen Greenstein <bgreenstein@nctimes.net> (02.06.2000)\n\nMy favourite Kinks album - I'm sorry, but there's almost no filler on here. \"Too Much On My Mind,\" which bothers you so much, has got a truly classy melody, and it's not alone. I may have to call it a tie with Village Green, but it's even more fun. A ten.\n\nSergey Zhilkin <sergey_jilkin@mail.ru> (21.04.2001)\n\nOoh, that's a very long story! It all started back in my childhood when I was listening to radio and a 'dj'(I put this word in brackets cause in USSR we had no real djs) said: 'Ok, and now here's an old folk Britain song which, I hope, will please you' (in fact, it's an old dirty trick to put a good tune on air). 'Sunny afternoon' started. I really can't tell you what happened to me then. This lazy, a little bit jazzy melody caught me so much that I was replaying this song for weeks(!!!) in my head. My English really sucked and all I could understand from the lyrics was '...in summertime, in summertime...' It all happened 'bout 10 years ago and from that time I started collecting songs with word 'summertime' in a title. Great sum of money was wasted on covers of Gershwin's 'Summertime' so after seven years or so I gave up.\n\nUntil last week I didn't care about 'sunny afternoon' much. But just seven days ago it was played on air again and now dj (without brackets this time) explained that it were The Kinks. Who??? The Kinks??? These suckers that produced 'Phobia' and 'State of confusion'? Damn it! But next day I was holding 'Face to face' in my hands...\n\n'Too much on my mind' is great, too. 'Party line' was so beautiful that Stones ripped off some hooks from it. And do you expect that my rating will be somewhere about 11 or 12? Ha! Of course, no. I give it a high 13.\n\nFidel Juárez <fidelsjuarezg@hotmail.com> (25.04.2002)\n\nMy God. How could I ever subsiste without gettng a hold of such an incredible album? See... for some stupid reason, this hadn't been part of my small Kinks collection of essential albums, and was only familiar with two or three songs in the MP3 format. Just the classics, 'Sunny afternoon', 'Rosy won't you please come home, 'Dandy' (I don't mention the bonus tracks for now) and 'House in the country' -the later seemed kinda ordinary after two uninterested listens. I gave the entire deal a try out of curiosity, to be honest, as I firmly believed that Ray Davies had matured his artistic intentions only after Something Else and its successors... and because I used to hold the sad preconception that there was not an absolutely ideal Kinks record out there (speaking about official releases, of course: one could only imagine the possibilities in compilations.)\n\nArthur is a magnificent record, but it has that tiresome jamming in 'Australia' and there's a couple of songs that I think were unnecessarily stretched (title track, 'Mr. Churchill says\"); TVGPS is the poppiest thus the jolliest Kinks album, but not all of the songs live up to the expectations (though not \"Big Sky\"!: that refrain!) nor the track listing (all those details we appreciate when remembering an album we care about) and I believe the album misses a more dark, down-to-earth side that I appreciate in every record that I could be completely mad about (see: if I'm not blind with excitement over one of these pieces of sound every once in a while, my life would be undoubtedly duller), which leads logically to Muswell Hillbillies. For a while I believed this was my finest bet for a favourite Kinks record because of the beautiful flow that goes from despair to a certain nihilism ('Complicated life') and the familiar childlike songs in between ('Alcohol' is both funny and creepy, as singalongish is 'Have a cuppa tea')... and hell, because I'm a sucker for sentimental country as well. I learned to love Lola as well, because those ballads are so cute and because of the overall 70'ish atmosphere. Not a very strong argument, of course, but dammit if \"Strangers\" doesn't hold a soft spot for any admirer of the band.\n\nI believe George Starostin wrote something about the songs contained in Muswell Hillbillies having to be appreciated in the big picture, something of which I'm not convinced. He meant it though, I think, because of the retro eclecticism of that record, of which I wasn't bothered the least at the beginning. Now... Face To Face. Just taking the fact that there were supposed to be numerous dialogs and sound effects in the mix increases my admiration for this movie... I mean record. If Lou Reed took Cabaret, Ray Davies took (drumroll...) A star is born. You get it, one of those rags to riches (and down we go again) stories about making it in the music industry. Lola touched this particular theme but without enough boost and seemed almost a parody altogether (if it wasn't already, unless there's a Part 2 on the way sometime.) I can't forget the fact that Face to face narrates musically a \"simple\" story (that is, that the music is more important than the subject), but it is important to acknowledge since I don't know of any other record that does it with such fun, rapidity, being devoid of pseudo intellectual rubbish and almost unaware of its importance.\n\nForget about the \"simple\" remark: see, I haven't read absolutely any review of this record bar the one in this site, and I only did it once without paying too much attention, but I think that every one of the songs contained in this album would have made one of the greatest musical movies ever made. (Now, if you go and tell me to get the hell off and buy musical movies instead of talking about this album because we're discussing rock here... I'd say, why not having both things at once?) 'Party Line' is the coolest intro for any Kinks album, with the goofy speaking voice over a telephone and the reaping guitars and fast lyrics -it evokes a fun sixties atmosphere without sounding too overwelcoming or \"mistifying\", it's a good song and that's it, memorable, frantic but in control (adjectives that I can apply easily to the subsequent songs.) 'Rosy won't you please come home' and 'Dandy' were songs I knew already, as I stated before, but now both seem perfect following one another because of the coming of age and lost of innocence themes (nothing to be crazy about per se, the themes I mean, but the resolution is impeccable.) \"Too much on my mind\" and \"Rainy day in june\" are songs about tension and could very well function as backgrounds for anticipating sequences (I'm still imagining the musical, in case someone cares) of misfortune. And, yes, both songs are emotionally resonant, catchy and seemed to have been written with the minimum of effort. After exploring tacitly the subject of music industry with \"Session man\" and the wealth that we characteristicly relate to it, \"A house in the country\" follows the careless path established by \"Party Line\", passing through \"Holiday in Waikiki\" (you can almost picture bucolic images of youth) until \"Most exclusive residence for sale\".\n\nAs anyone can see, the songs are firmly established in the present while being part of a continuum. Youth-career-fame-bad weather-house in the country-holiday-residence for sale... and so. Thus the cinematic feeling reinforced with the effects that the record company tycoons of then were kind enough to let us appreciate. Assholes.\n\n\"Fancy\" is, ergh... overcooked, but still doesn't sound out of place with the twist of events that the previous songs contained. It's not spectacular but it's conveniently sad and... well... beautifully produced. (You can see I'm ready to deffend this album anytime, mister.) \"Little miss queen of darkness\" and \"You're lookin' fine\" not only mirror tracks two and three as time went on, again with apparently no effort at all, but are both cute (the way the girl looks in nightclubs and stuff), funny and pathetic (at least \"You're lookin' fine\" seems like a drunken effort, deliberately in the good sense by Davies, from the former Dandy to pick up a girl). What then? See, we've had thus far a constant feeling of good partying atmosphere (almost debauchery like), coming of age, stardom rising, with neverending humor (bar \"Fancy\", I guess) and charm. Oh, yeah. The closing \"Sunny afternoon\". No comments, since I think everybody should be acquaintanced with this song, which, believe me, sounds a ton stronger in the context of this album (I was going to say \"in the context of the big picture\" but I felt like sabotaging my own review).\n\nAfter the epilogue \"I'll remember\", I can only think of why I hadn't listened to this record before, as I think it is the perfect Kinks album. It doesn't contain my absolute favourite Ray Davies songs or anything, but it flows like the cold sip of a beer (you know at what time of the day). I was going to end with a bitter rethorical question about a supposed grandiose album that deals with angst problems because I could earn a negative vibe from George here but he should know I'm not trying to pick on him nor anybody else, and... oh hell... is Quadrophenia better than this? Maybe... NOT! I don't think that \"Buckets of rain\" isn't even a better closer for an album like this at the moment. Face to Face now enters my ongoing list to pursue rock heaven alongside Abbey Road (the only Beatles album I can't seem to get tired about... eventually), Tattoo You, Band On The Run, Murmur, and so. This is what I feel honestly. I wish I could relate better to albums that I know are both good and consistent (it's not only a matter of taste, I believe this because we simply follow the sounds and themes we care about and think are essential, and because... doesn't everybody hold some sort of irrational vendetta or allergy towards something or somebody?)- now (I'm paraphrasing): Sue me.\n\n5 stars on an MP3 page. A 10 and 15 points in the overall rating. Five stars anywhere. Original, listenable, resonant, even revoutionary, funny, unpretentious, and my favourite record from now on to serve as the basis of a film that was never made. Be gentle.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter reading George Starostin's review with full attention and the reader's comments I think everybody would agree with me... to some small extent. Good. I say tomato but my metabolism tells me to do it louder. I can't help if I'm too enthusiastic about it (otherwise, why the exposing). \"Hey Bulldog\"?? That's weird, man. Guess the Beatles were not all that original after all.\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (05.05.2002)\n\nYep, the progress between the last album and this one really is pretty amazing. In a way, this was the Kinks' answer to Revolver. Both albums are filled with an eclectic selection of tunes, each totally different from the last. What most people don't realize, though, is that the Kinks album would have been released in or around the same month as the Beatles album, but contract negotiations delayed it. So it came out a few months later. And most of the songs are good, too. \"Sunny Afternoon\" might be the only one that I would characterize as \"great,\" but several others are at least \"very good,\" such as \"Too Much On My Mind,\" and \"Rosy Won't You Please Come Home\" both of which indicate that Ray Davies had definitely arrived as a ballad writer. The humor on this album is very much in evidence, particularly on \"House In The Country\" (one of their best rockers), \"Holiday In Waikiki\" (that Hawaiian guitar always breaks me up), \"Most Exclusive Residence For Sale\" (not a big favorite, but close enough) and \"Session Man\" (a good little jibe at Nicky Hopkins, methinks). There's a couple of good mood pieces on here: \"Rainy Day In June\" conjures up a nice atmosphere and \"Little Miss Queen Of Darkness\" is both music-hallish and kinda dark-sounding. \"Fancy\" is, well, interesting I guess. For some reason, I've never been able to really connect with that one. \"Party Line\" and \"I'll Remember\" sound like they belong on the previous album, but would have been two of the better songs on that one. On this album, they don't stand out much. \"You're Lookin' Fine\" is a reasonable r&b tune, but nothing too special. I guess the one song that I really don't like is \"Dandy,\" which better suited the group that had the hit with it, Herman's Hermits. I've always found the melody to be just a tad lame. Overall, I think the Kinks got a little better over the next few years, but this is still one of their five or six best albums.\n\nThe bonus tracks, as usual, provide us with a few gems. The \"Dead End Street\" b/w \"Big Black Smoke\" single has to be one of the greatest 45s of all time. Both songs are among my all-time favorite Kinks tunes. \"I'm Not Like Everybody Else\" (the B-side of \"Sunny Afternoon\") is a definite highlight. \"Mister Pleasant\" sounds like a lesser tune to me, but that's only compared to the other great stuff the Kinks were releasing at this time. The B-side, \"This Is Where I Belong,\" is a strong pop tune left over from Face To Face. Previously unreleased are \"Mr. Reporter\" (a rather mediocre angry tune which is not the version recorded for this album, but the later version recorded for Dave's 1969 solo album) and \"Little Sister\" (which the vocals were never recorded for - seems it would have been better if they had been).\n\nBrian Donovan <RAILGUITAR@aol.com> (19.07.2005)\n\nPretty consistent as far as the original album cuts go. One great classic, \"Sunny Afternoon,\" and one clunker \"Rainy Day In June\" (they should leave the thunder sound effects to Phil Spector or the Four Seasons). I notice a jangle to the guitars in cuts like \"Party Line\" and \"Session Man\" that seems unique to this album. Also \"\"I'll Remember.\"\n\nMy CD does not have the bonus cuts you list, but I know 4 or 5 of them from The Kink Kronikles. \"Mr. Pleasant\" is an all time favorite, what hilarious lyrics, with Ray's smirking deadpan voice and Nicky Hopkins' keyboards all over the place. \"This Is Where I Belong\" is a very moving tune.\n\nAlexey Provolotsky <alpro@tut.by> (16.09.2005)\n\nHere starts their classic period. The big progression is evident only on the first half, though. But what an amazing stretch of songs the first half is! The 6 songs at the beginning are gems. The funny and catchy Party Line is a great slice of pop (yeah, the Stones did a rip-off, definitely). Its so great, its the Beatles. The sad charming Rosie is as beautiful as Ray could get. Dandy and Too Much On My Mind give us fantastic melodies and clever (well, Ray could do better, of course, but not yet) lyrics. Session Man is just another memorable pop song and Rainy Day In June features absolutely irresistible rainy atmosphere. Man, what a perfect album, - you want to shout. But, no. Even such a genius as Ray Davies couldnt be that fast in growing up. After that fab 6 we have three good, but rather generic rockers. Granted, they are better (undoubtedly!) than the generic material witnessed on the previous recordings, but really Well, lets move on. Fancy is very clumsy and vague, but I still like such stuff. Its amusing and different. Little Miss Queen Of Darkness is a nice gentle ballad, Youre Looking Fine is nothing special, Sunny Afternoon is one of the most beautiful and charming Ray Davies songs ever, of course! So dreamy, so wonderful. And Ill Remember is, although simplistic, very catchy.\n\nAnd the bonus tracks are superb! Dont even think of missing that new edition, for it contains such brilliant songs as Dead End Street, Big Black Smoke, Mr. Pleasant, Im Not Like Everybody Else (really, the titles speak for themselves). These are classics by any standards and should be in every collection. Ahhh, and This Is Where I Belong and Mr. Reporter also rule, Damn it, they all rule.\n\nThe album gets a 13/15 (unfortunately!), but the reissue\n\nTagbo Munonyedi <grimtraveller@hotmail.com> (15.10.2006)\n\nThe more I listen to this album, especially in the light of the bonus tracks that come on the CD, the more I'm convinced that the Kinks at this time were almost like two bands, one that made singles so strong and groundbreaking that they're up there with the Beatles in that dept - and one that just did not make strong albums at that point. One of the reviewers earlier makes the point that FACE TO FACE is the Kinks reply to REVOLVER but both albums were recorded between april and june of '66 and there was no Stones like friendship between the two bands so I'm not sure how much of an answer it could've been. To the Kinks' credit, they pursued their own path. This album pales alongside anything the Beats had released since their opening two albums......\n\nI think that there was a shift in attitudes towards what the main medium for presenting songs was to be {the single or the album ?} and the Beatles just happened to have cottoned on faster than any other British band. It was to be a while before Ray Davies and co did likewise. I find it interesting that the superb SUNNY AFTERNOON is far and away the standout track here.....and it was released as a single. And little else stands up to DEDICATED FOLLOWER OF FASHION or DEAD END STREET or their B sides. Hmm. Alot of the Kinks album work has a samey feel about it, there's that acoustic/electric sound, that same Mick Avory beat and that unimaginative bass ponking along. Sometimes it's hard to believe it's the same lot that put out such challenging singles.\n\nThat all said though, I think the Kinks were one of the most inventive bands of the 60s and I like the fact that once they'd put some of their early stuff behind them, they went in a unique direction for the times. They weren't beyond absorbing Dylan, the Beatles and the Who either; in fact, Dylan's mesmeric lyrical lead liberated Lennon, Townshend, Harrison, Jagger and in particular, Ray Davies. Just check out the lyric to the magnificent RAINY DAY IN JUNE. In fact, the song is one of my favourites of the Kinks and I think it's both psychedelic and Dylanesque at the same time. The 'worrying' use of sound effects is also brilliant.\n\nThe rockers on the LP {PARTY LINE, HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY, HOLIDAY IN WAIKIKI, MOST EXCLUSIVE, LOOKIN' FINE, I'LL REMEMBER} I find really irritating. It's not that they don't have melodies {I don't believe there is such a thing !}, it's that IMO the melodies are boring and unimaginative. Now, that isn't always a bad thing coz sometimes, there's enough going on musically to compensate and the melody becomes part of the whole sound {for example, HELP ! or I AM THE WALRUS}. But that doesn't happen with these songs. And DANDY starts off promisingly but ends up sounding like a hybrid rewrite of something by .........the Kinks !! There again, maybe what happened was that where this album's songs were headed just got refined over the next few years and rewritten better as Ray's craft got, um, craftier...\n\nTOO MUCH ON MY MIND is a good one, sounds like the writings of a man going through a nervous breakdown or something. Such were the times, if people had been listening to the Kinks with both ears, maybe they'd 've thought of them as trippy bretheren coz I find something rather Anglopsychedelic about some of their output circa '66-'69. SESSION MAN and FANCY are the other ones that stand out to me; the former I wouldn't be surprized if some of the Monkees writers had a good listen to that in '67, while I get the feeling that the latter found it's way into the consciousness of The Incredible String Band and Tyrannosaurus Rex, among others. By the way, the bass line in YOU'RE LOOKIN' FINE sounds like a variation on a bass riff that turned up on loads of pieces. It's the kind of thing that many bass players kind of stumble upon when learning or practicing and we think we're so cool when we first hit it !! Lennon had the good sense of Zeppelinesque thievery to convert it into a main guitar/piano riff for BULLDOG.\n\nOverall though, I'm rather disappointed though the good tracks are damn good.\n\nSOMETHING ELSE BY THE KINKS\n\nBen Greenstein <bgreenstein@nctimes.net> (29.01.2000)\n\nWow! Someone else who finds this album as boring as I do! Most people praise this one, but a lot of the songs sound very lacklustre to me. \"No Return\" is the worst - unique chord changes like an XTC song, but a truly hideous melody unlike XTC. Sure, \"Waterloo Sunset\" and \"David Watts\" (which is really just a ripoff of \"Let's Spend The Night Together\") along with a couple of others, are fantastic, but the album really doesn't intrest me that much. I could probably give it a seven, but am really tempted to go for a six.\n\njpcs <jpcs@xtra.co.nz> (09.06.2000)\n\n\"Harry Rag\" isn't about pot,it's just about cigarettes.\n\nIvan Piperov <zwetan@stud.uni-frankfurt.de> (24.08.2000)\n\nWhere the memorable tunes are? I bought this album recently, and \"Tin Soldier Man\", \"Harry Rag\" and of course \"Waterloo Sunset\" just won't get out of my head. I'm sure the other tunes will be stuck in my head before too long too. Though I can't imagine this with \"No Return\". This song has some tiny hooks within the lines and it shows what a musical mind Ray Davies once has had. And the chords...really complex! Now when you say that \"Love Me Till The Sun Shines\" sounds like their first records, I'll maybe buy them out of pure masochism: I've never heard a clumsier voice than Dave Davies', and that's kinda entertaining... I recommend not to buy the new CD-version, because it's in ugly mono. The old CD may not contain any bonus tracks, but comes in glorious '67 stereo!\n\nThomas M. Silvestri <cc3000@earthlink.net> (01.10.2000)\n\nWho's this soulful babe (sounds like Mary J. Blige or Lauren Hill -- not that I know their stuff that well) who's done a cover of \"Waterloo Sunset\"? (Don't know if it's brand new or out for awhile, but I just heard it in a bar the other night.)\n\nDidier Dumonteil <dbdumonteil@wanadoo.fr> (19.04.2001)\n\n\"David Watts\" is a song that deserves to be a perennial.:We all have known a \"David Watt\" the guy everybody envies,the guy who always succeeds,the guy to whom we feel like giving the lethal potion.And don't forget you're someone's David Watts too.\"Two sisters \" is some kind of female counterpart of \"Watts\".But all in all,the jealous sister realizes that her life is not that much bad after all and children isn't it the greatest gift?.\"Harry Rag\" is a direct son of \"dedicated follower of fashion\".\"Waterloo Sunset\" is now Ray Davies' song par excellence.Its inspiration(Julie Christie and Terence Stamp teaming in a Schlesinger film\"far from the madding crowd\",an almost forgotten fine but overlong rural melodrama)took strange ways to become an urban passing love affair.\"Afternoon tea\" ,the most English topic,will be improved over the years with the incredibly funny \"Have a cuppa tea\" on mushwell hillbillies.Something else is not a concept album,it's much better :a collection of English ordinary life vignettes.\n\n<Rael868@aol.com> (25.07.2001)\n\nI seriously do not understand George's review for this album. What makes this album any more boring than the ones surrounding it? The only difference I see is that this album is marginally better than the ones surrounding it! I love this album, and the band never wrote a song as good as 'Waterloo', or released an album as consistant and wonderful as this. 'Situation Vacant' is filler? Then that means that every single song the Beatles released until Sgt. pepper was filler. 'Afternoon Tea' is amazing...the opening line still gives me chills whenever I hear it, it's so simple, lovely, and catchy \"Tea Time won't be the same without my donna...\" George's review almost made me skip this album....thank god I didn't.\n\nFidel Juárez <fidelsjuarezg@hotmail.com> (18.04.2002)\n\nFunny how some of the things you mentioned could be stated through a more positive frame of mind. (\"Night is as dark as you feel it ought to be\". No wonder Lennon adored that one.) I don't see how this record sounds all that boring, and I couldn't say that the band began to lose their originality. However slow the music may sound or repetitive may the chords be (anyway, the Davies brothers could and did write catchier melodies throughout their career) every subsequent record was based on this moment of absolute confidence in which Ray Davies invented his trademark style (making it as important as Aftermath or Pet sounds for this matter.) I dig it not only because of this, but because I happen to believe this is a beautiful sounding album today. Every song has some redeeming feature (the organ at the end of 'Lazy old sun', the brief solo guitar in 'Situation vacant', the beautul lyrics in 'No return'), in spite of this one being, yes, a moody, empathic, even a 'stoner' album. 'Boooooooring'? It depends on the listener. 'I'd bet you anything this is a good song to listen to when you're stoned'? Sure, and the morning news and many of Dylan's songs too for that matter. Seriously now, besides the obvious classics, you're gonna either like or love this album depending on your level of 'nostalghia'.\n\nThank God I didn't skip it either.\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (05.05.2002)\n\nAt this point, the Kinks were firmly lodged into their \"Golden Age.\" The little songs about mundane English pastimes are just irresistible to me. Needless to say, I'll pick \"Waterloo Sunset\" as my favorite on this one. I have no qualms about describing it as a \"masterpiece.\" \"Lazy Old Sun\" is also one of my all-time favorites, and totally bizarre. I get a big kick out of \"End Of The Season,\" one of the funniest songs I've ever heard. Let's see . . . \"David Watts\" is thoroughly enjoyable, with its schoolboy backing vocals; \"Harry Rag\" works really well with its English folk leanings; \"Situation Vacant\" is a rare rocker from this period and very funny; \"No Return\" does a good job at capturing that Ipanema sound; \"Afternoon Tea\" is quintessential 1967 Kinks and \"Two Sisters\" is, too (neither is a huge favorite, but I like them). At least two of the Dave tunes on here sound good to me: \"Funny Face\" (which is really Ray-influenced, I think) and the slightly overrated \"Death Of A Clown.\" I'm not too impressed with \"Love Me Till The Sun Shines,\" which gets too redundant for me. The only other song that I find questionable is \"Tin Soldier Man,\" which has a rather annoying melody until it gets to that nice middle part. Anyway, I prefer this over the previous album, and would rank it as my fourth favorite Kinks album.\n\nThe bonus tracks are, as usual, mostly great. \"Autumn Almanac\" has so many great little sections that it amazes me. Big favorite there. \"Wonderboy\" is another favorite, though I wouldn't want certain friends to walk in on me while it's on, with all those \"la la las.\" The B-side, \"Polly,\" is very catchy and Who-like. I also enjoy the Kinks' first attempt at country, \"Act Nice And Gentle\" (the B-side of \"Waterloo Sunset\"). The Dave Davies material is particularly strong. There's no doubt in my mind that \"Lincoln County\" (their second attempt at country) is the best of his '60s tunes, and the B-side, \"There Is No Life Without Love\" is enjoyable and somewhat unique. The previous A-side, \"Susannah's Still Alive\" is also one of Dave's stronger efforts. The previously unreleased track, \"Lazy Old Sun\" is the one drawback here. It's basically the same recording as the official one, but Ray's voice is very sloppily double-tracked.\n\nBrian Sittinger <bsitting@mail.math.ucsb.edu> (27.02.2003)\n\nThis album took a few listens getting into, as the overall sound to this album is sooo laid back. (It's funny that I had the same initial reaction to Genesis' SEBTP and Foxtrot. Perhaps it's their \"Britishness\" in one way shape or form.) But, it was more or less worth it! I actually liked \"David Watts\" from the first listen, though it seems quite reminiscent of a certain Rolling Stones song (a quite good one at that). Most of the other Ray tunes are good, especially \"Harry Rag\", \"Tin Soldier Man\", \"Afternoon Tea\" (so definantly British!), and \"Waterloo Sunset\". Though I don't think \"Waterloo Sunset\" is the most beautiful song out there, it still is quite a pretty song. The Dave songs are alright, though not that impressive (\"Death of a Clown\" included). \"No Return\" is way too lethagic for me\", while the noises in \"Lazy Old Sun\" grate a bit, though the overall song is intriguing.\n\nI'd give a 9(12) for the \"basic album\". Although I don't have the reisssue, I do have a few of the bonus tracks from \"The Kink Knonikles\". \"Autumn Almanac\" is definitely a highlight, easily one of my favorite Kink songs. All the different mini-sections flow into one another so smoothly they may not be noticed on first listen, and in about three minutes! It also has a bit of tasty reverse guitar noises at the end.\n\nBrian Donovan <RAILGUITAR@aol.com> (02.08.2005)\n\nI think my reaction to this album is similar to yours....it's not as good as the albums that preceded it (Face To Face) or followed it (VGPS). Production and engineering are major culprits, at least on the CD I've got (Reprise Records #6279-2). The troubles begin with \"No Return\" in which Ray's vocal has a somewhat underrecorded, distant quality, and it sounds like background hiss on the tape. On \"Situation Vacant\" I have the opposite problem; here the vocal is too far out front in relation to the guitars and bass, which are buried in the mix. This could have been a number to recapture the classic early grungy Kinks sound, instead the guitars and bass get overwhelmed by the organ stabs, which sound too cute and gimmicky as a result. Then on \"Lazy Old Sun\" Ray's vocal gets buried again except on the chorus, when it practically leaps out of the speaker...sounds like a sloppy punch in.\n\nEven the albums masterpiece, \"Waterloo Sunset\" has one small quibble; wouldn't it be better if you could tell what notes or key the acoustic guitars are playing? They might as well be cymbals, you can't tell. Fortunately this is such a strong song that it doesn't matter. There are also some weak songs in the second half, like \"Love Me Til The Sun Shines\" (guitars buried again), \"Lazy Old Sun\" (Ray's attempt at getting a laid back boring effect succeeds too well), \"Afternoon Tea\" and \"Funny Face.\"\n\nOn the other hand \"David Watts\" and \"Death Of A Clown\" are good tunes and better produced too. \"Two Sisters\" was the \"find\" for me, since it isn't on Kink Kronikles like the other standouts.\n\nRegarding the bonus cuts, my fave of the ones I've heard is \"Wonderboy.\" Can't hear those background \"la-la-las\" without breaking into a smile. Indeed there are some great background vocals elsewhere, like on \"Waterloo Sunset\" and \"Death Of A Clown\"...I read somewhere the high female voice belongs to Ray's then-wife Rasa. And my keyboard hero Nicky Hopkins is around too.\n\nWith Ray's songwriting talent I can't say this is a bad album, in fact I probably listen to it more frequently these days than most Beatle albums, which I've only played a thousand times. But I bet it would have sounded a lot better with, say, George Martin producing and Norman Smith or Geoff Emerick engineering, just for example.\n\nAlexey Provolotsky <alpro@tut.by> (16.09.2005)\n\nEven better! I dont see why its boring, really. What I see is that Something Else is their most diverse album. It opens with such stunners as David Watts, Death Of A Clown (Daves best song ever and once my favourite Kinks song of all time; its so saaaaaad) and Two Sisters (absolutely breathtaking!). These three songs alone would guarantee Something Else a pretty high rating. No Return is probably a bit too plain and lazy, but it has a nice melody and is, in fact, a good song. Three straight classics (excuse me for the overusing of the word, but its Ray Davies writing songs!) follow. Yes, three, as Situation Vacant is fantastic. One of my favourites, actually. Great drumming from Mick and absolutely unforgettable organ breaks. Amazing lyrics, as usual. Daves songs are not that great, but Funny Face is very cleverly constructed and has, like, a bunch of quite solid melodies. Afternoon Tea is amusing and very English and Lazy Old Sun has the most brilliant moment on the whole album. I get shivers every time I hear Ray singing one ray of light through your lazy old suuuuuuuun. Its terribly gorgeous. Im not that keen on End Of The Season, but I cant deny its extremely funny. We close with the heaven-like beauty of Waterloo Sunset. The song is probably the best track here. Probably.\n\nThe reissue is more than recommendable. Just because Autumn Almanac is here. You know what the song sound like? No? What the hell are you thinking?! These bonus tracks are as solid as the ones on the Face To Face reissue. Two Daves singles of highest quality! What the hell are you thinking?!?!\n\n14/15 for the album and wait, but thats cheating!\n\nLIVE AT KELVIN HALL\n\n<WhoJonGalt@aol.com> (18.10.2001)\n\nThis is for anyone who wants to get a gauge of the intensity and the scream-fest that was a live show during the British Invasion. The selection of songs are wide and well-done, and there are other surprises. Worth adding to the pile...\n\nRobert Tally <BtheW@aol.com> (05.05.2002)\n\nThe Kinks' answer to Got Live If You Want It. I'm not too crazy about this release (I like it about as much as the Stones album), mainly because of the atrocious sound-quality. The vocals on the original recording were almost inaudible, so they went into the studio and overdubbed more vocals (and guitars as well). This actually helps on the mono version of the album, since the overdubbed vocals are pretty loud. However, the stereo version keeps them just as low in the mix as the original vocals. The Essential CD gives us both versions so we can compare. Anyway, there are some entertaining moments on this one, particularly the \"Milk Cow Blues\" medley. But mostly it's just kinda noisy and sloppy. Mostly, it returns the band to their pre-Face To Face style.\n\nIt should be noted that the version called The Live Kinks was released in the US before Something Else. This was to compensate for the Musicians Union ban on the Kinks then in effect. It was released in other parts of the world around that time, too, but with the familiar Live At Kelvin Hall title. The UK release was pretty much an afterthought.\n\n<nikita111@mail.ru> (28.10.2003)\n\nOh, shit. I have just listened this in headphones and all that I can say is crap. Disagree with you, George. Record quality is horrendous; audience noises are irritating as hell. May be the selection of songs is good (I don t know), but all I can hear are generic, stupid, boring rock-n-roll numbers. Boring and dated. Today nobody needs this stuff.\n\nMichael H. <ratboymike@hotmail.com> (26.11.2003)\n\nOk, I once found and still have, a store bought tape of Live At Kelvin Hall that is one of these cheap budget releases, and the tape appears to be an import. Just today I went to our new and improved library (they merged the college library with the main branch downtown-and the college library was/is loaded with all sorts of records-tons of them) and they have a copy of The Live Kinks (The album says \"Stereo\"). I will have to listen to both of them back to back and then give you my opinion. Its just that this vinyl LIVE KINKS has a mistake. They list in the song contents \"All day and all of the night\" which is NOT on the album. (the vinyl) its is \"Till The End Of The Day\" ect, Ill get back to you on this! Thanks.\n\nTHE VILLAGE GREEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY\n\nEric Feder <ejfeder@amherst.edu> (22.04.99)\n\n'big sky' is actually my favorite song on the kinks' Village Green Preservation Society. I'm a big fan of the velvet underground so i guess i don't mind speak-singing. But regardless, this song just ROCKS! Great lyrics, and i love the insistent acoustic guitar line underneat the sneering \"spoken\" vocal.\n\nBen Greenstein <bgreenstein@nctimes.net> (27.08.99)\n\nThis is the album that does it for me. Unlike some of the other Kinks albums, where most of the melodies took a bit of time to grow on me, this one has tunes that leap out and grab you right away, in a sort of Beatlesey way. At least, that's the way it feels to me.\n\nThere is one stinker, though - \"People Take Pictures Of Each Other\" is unmelodic, and hard to be seen as anything other than filler. And it's the closing track. They really, really, should have put \"Days\" at the end. That's a great song! And it would have fit in perfectly with \"Do You Remember Walter,\" the title track, my personal fave \"Picture Book,\" the goofy \"Phenomonal Cat,\" and the rest. A near perfect album. A perfect score.\n\nRich Bunnell <taosterman@yahoo.com> (18.04.2000)\n\nI felt a little guilty not having any albums by these guys considering that I'm a big fan of their numerous offspring, like XTC, the Jam, and Blur, so I got this one a few months ago for seven bucks. At first, it bored the living crap out of me-- I loved the title track a bit, but the rest of the songs all sounded the same. Then it started growing growing growing GROWING GROWING WOW THIS ALBUM IS REALLY REALLY FRIGGIN' GOOD! I like almost every song on it! \"Do You Remember Walter,\" \"Starstruck,\" \"Village Green,\" \"Big Sky,\" \"Johnny Thunder,\" \"Picture Book,\" and most of the rest of the songs are so utterly catchy. And well-written. None of it rocks at all, but it sits around and sounds really pretty, gentle, nice, and perfect. I'd give it a ten-- it's just as good as everyone says it is.\n\nFredrik Tydal <f_tydal@hotmail.com> (27.07.2000)\n\nRay Davies was a master of crafting melodies, for sure. I can look at any song title on the back of this album and immediately begin to hum the melody. And the lyrics ain't bad either; check out the title track for some really imaginative words. The album title might lead some people to believe the album is pretentious, but it's not. It's just a collection of great songs with great melodies. No, not those annoying melodies you want out of your head, but melodies you gladly tap your foot or hum along to. I think I'm gonna go listen to \"Starstruck\" right now...\n\nIvan Piperov <zwetan@stud.uni-frankfurt.de> (10.08.2000)\n\nMuch as I like the Preservation-thing, I just couldn't imagine this album would be better. The title track reminds me of \"Shepherds Of The Nation\" and \"Where are they now\" seems to be based around the bridge of \"johny Thunder... Apart from being the prelude, this CD is really better than Preservation, much better. Although I prefer stereo, the mono version on the remastered CD sounds better. The stereo version is awfully distorted and worn out...\n\nWard <Wardo68@aol.com> (11.08.2000)\n\nI've spent most of my life NOT understanding the Kinks. Just too English I guess. (And considering that my fave groups have been the Beatles, Who, Stones, Jam, Costello, etc. that says a lot) But I spent the last 10 days or so trying to 'get' Village Green. I'm amazed with the thoroughness your reviews run, you didn't say A WORD about 'Phenomenal Cat', perhaps Ray's only psychedelic song! A little Syd Barrett goes a long way. But then, I'm only 32. I wasn't there. Great reading. I'll have to get my own reviews up soon.\n\nmjcarney <mjcarney@netzero.net> (14.08.2000)\n\nWell this album is it, it is the most quintessential Kinks album out there bar none. Like you said, it doesn't really rock, or even move you, especially on the first few listens, but there are a ton of melodies, and strong/beautiful lyrics and arrangements to all of the songs. Also, there really isn't a stinker on the entire album, well maybe \"All of My Friends Were There\"--it is a little tiresome, but the rest of the album is just brilliant. Supposedly this album only sold 17,000 copies in the US when it was released, which is just awful for a major label band and especially one that was already somewhat established as the Kinks were just 2-3 years earlier. All I have to say is that the consumers missed out. Sure, the album's presence is flavored with British sentiments, but the basic themes and ideas can relate to anybody. This is most especially true in the albums best track \"Do You Remember Walter\". Everyone can relate to this song as you see your old friends change and grow away from you, it has a regretful tone, but it is honest and true plus with a melody that would make even Paul McCartney shudder. The other major highlights include the beatiful loss of innocence ode \"Animal Farm\". This song features all the lushness and beauty present in \"Waterloo Sunset\", but with perhaps even a better melody (which is saying a lot!!!). That is simply why this album works so well, Ray Davies has perfected the art of writing not just catchy/beautiful songs that you can hum too (like McCartney would do) but he has added some strong lyrics to these melodies to just make them stronger. Other strong tracks include the laid back anthemic title track and its flipside \"Village Green\", the jovial/regretful \"Picture Book\"--which has a very upbeat melody splashed with hints of regret, and the subdued beauty of \"Johnny Thunder\". Basically this album is just fun, and (strangely) rather lively considering its restrained sound. I have heard/read complaints about this album because all of its songs were written in the same key, but you know what with melodies and lyrics this great it is so hard to notice. Also, the similarities of \"Wicked Annabella\" and \"Boris the Spider\" are kind of a stretch. Sure they both have a slow power chord riff progression, feature vocals by the sideman of the band, and use some dry English humour, but they don't really sound much alike at all. I would've never drawn that conclusion--and I didn't. Still though, this is a tremendous album, unfortunately at least where I am from it was incredibly hard to find--it took me like a year of looking to buy it (well I didn't want to use the Internet). Believe me, if you don't own this album, you really are missing one of rock and roll's all time masterpieces. For years I always heard from other Beatle freeks that if you really like the Beatles, you'll also love the Kinks, and this is the album by them which could stand up to any Beatles album, it is just that good. 10/10!--Buy it today!\n\nDan Luban <dahelu@earthlink.net> (21.10.2000)\n\n10. I agree that the spoken parts of 'Big Sky' can be rather annoying, and 'Starstruck' seems a little bland to me. But everything else is phenomenal--special standouts for me are the title track, 'Do You Remember Walter?', and 'Sitting by the Riverside'. I will have to disagree with Ben and say that 'People Takes Pictures of Each Other' is the best song on the album, and maybe my favorite Kinks song ever. Wild, funny, but still quite moving. I think this is easily their pinnacle--nothing else came close to the songcraft and emotion they showed on this album.\n\nMorten Felgenhauer <Morten.Felgenhauer@kvaerner.com> (02.01.2001)\n\nVillage Green was originally released as a 12 track album. It was then withdrawn and later released with 15 songs. \"Mr. Songbird\" and \"Days\" were not on the latter version, but \"Steam-Powered Trains\", \"Big Sky\", \"Sitting By The Riverside\", \"Animal Farm\", \"All Of My Friend Were There\" were added. Both versions of the album along with the single version of \"Days\" are included on the new CD. I rate both versions of the album as a solid 9/10.\n\ndavid rubien <rubien@pacbell.net> (10.02.2001)\n\n'Big Sky' is perfection. Village Green PS is the greatest Kinks album ever, but the production is probably the worst ever.\n\nDidier Dumonteil <dbdumonteil@wanadoo.fr> (22.04.2001)\n\nAfter \"Waterloo sunset\" the Kinks' sales were tapering off.Village green and Arthur -arguably both their masterworks- were virtually ignored .Their value was reassessed a posteriori.Quite rightly so.\n\nArthur is urban (suburban,more like),village green is rural.The latter is gentler,more wistful than wicked.I've never thought the title track was a joke:the Kinks (Davies ) REALLY burn with a desire to preserve the apple pie,Donald Duck and the Draught beer.The characters Walter (Only Davis and MCCartney could find such a bouncy little tune) and Johnny Thunder (that was to reappear later alas) are credible local lads. \"Village green\" tackles a cliché (the-country-boy-attracted-by-city-lights-who-regrets-his-peaceful-past) and it works thanks to the irresistible tune.Because,tuneful,this album definitely is:\"all my friends were there\"and \"animal farm\" might sound obsolete in 1968 world but they stood the test of time better than ,say,any Moody Blues ' \"poetic\" ravings. Nevertheless,I think the kinks would surpass themselves with their next one,George ,you're absolutely right.\n\nSergey Zhilkin <sergey_jilkin@mail.ru> (12.06.2001)\n\nIn my opinion, Village green should get a smaller rating - something like nine or even eight. That's all due to the fact that there're not so many really rockin' pieces. I agree that other tracks are calm, atmospheric and very enjoyable but, you know, I start to like Ray being angry. I like '20-th century man', 'Shangri-la' and other tracks where he is really furious. But this album surely lacks it. Rockers, which are present here, rule, although, again, they are too soft for me. My faves are title track, its clone, 'The last of steam powered train', 'Big sky' and, sure enough, 'Picture book'. I can't see any defects in 'Big sky' - the music is great, and if you listen to it you'll understand that one just can't sing in harmony with this music.\n\nThe only problem in sight is that I simply can't sit through the record without a pause - it's getting too lazy and uninteresting for me to listen all these nearly the same songs. Besides, Village green can't get a 10 score rating because it's a inferior to Arthur. Don't believe me? Then check out how many tunes the latter have. At least 20! And all of them are unique, while here we face something about ten or so simple tunes. That's why I give Village green 12 scores.\n\n<leahcim110@aol.com> (15.09.2001)\n\nVillage Green is the kinks finest hour on record, A songbook so pretty you might not notice the acid dripping from the seemingly innocent melodies.The fact that many songs are similar both musicaly and in theme is what makes it a concept album, this is not a detriment.This album is so damn good you can listen to it backwards and it still makes its point. Rays singing on \"Animal Farm\", \"Johny Thunder\" and \"Sitting by the Riverside\" are passionate pleas for a world sliding into a sewer. Simultaneous catchy and thought provoking not to mention moving, Village Green Preservation Society is one of Rocks greatest hidden treasures.\n\nRoy Shpringer <talsr@hotmail.com> (03.12.2001)\n\nFirst of all, Yes - this album does deserve a 10 strickly because Dave Davies isn't singing or writing any songs here (thank god for that...). Secondly, this concept (?) album consists of 14 really great songs. And I say 14 and not 15 because of the boring and utterly unpleasent 'Johnny Thunder'. The album begins with three great songs: 'The Village Green Preservation Society' which is a memorable title song, 'Do You Remember Walter' which is my favourite (some nice electric guitar work in the chorus) and 'Picture Book' - a very catchy and lightweight song.\n\nHowever I don't agree with some of your remarks. You can't say that a song (like 'Big Sky') is awful just because the singer doesn't sing the lyrics (just look at most of Bob Dylan's career), and besides it has a great melody (though the lyrics themselves are kinda dumb). Another great song that is often overlooked is 'The Last Of The Steam Powered Trains'. It's a great blues number and has a beautiful melancholic lyrics which are conveyed with a nice metaphore.\n\nThis album's big problem is probably its lack of diversity of the songs. Sometimes it makes me reluctant to put it in my CD player and hear it all over again, But the aforementioned songs save the day.\n\n'Monica' and 'Wicked Annabella' are the songs that sound differently. 'Monica' is a latin song that tells the story of a woman who is literally a bimbo, while 'Wicked Annabella' is a weird psychodelic number that takes some time to get used to. Finally, I must say that it's nice to find an album that was released in 1967 and could even match Sgt. Pepper and The Who Sell Out. That means you can't afford not to have this album.\n\nDavid Goodwin <ksg1-2@yifan.net> (16.12.2001)\n\n...maybe I've just been wrong for a very, very long time, but isn't that Dave Davies on 'Wicked Annabella'? (i.e. meaning there IS a Dave sung song on Village Green?)\n\nThis album took a while to grow on me, but I now am able to appreciate it for what it is. I just wish it had better production, honestly...it's so understated and dirty that it sounds more amateurish than it is. And despite the fact that the Kinks are the ULTIMATE b"
