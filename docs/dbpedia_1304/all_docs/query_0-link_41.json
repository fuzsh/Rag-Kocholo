        "text": "The Invite\n\nIn the early days of my songwriting I joined the Guild of International Songwriters, it’s still an organisation in existence today. Every month I would receive a newsletter, and to be honest most times it would not be very exciting, that was until the month it advertised a week long songwriting retreat on the Suffolk coast in a converted water tower called ‘House in the Clouds’. The picture with the advert showed this weird looking house, but what really drew my attention was who was running it — Ray Davies from The Kinks.\n\nYou don’t hesitate with opportunities like this, and I booked myself on it. Looking back I regard this as a key moment in my songwriting journey.\n\nSet in the quaint seaside town of Thorpeness just down the coast from a Nuclear Power station about ten of us arrived at the converted water tower. This was to be our home for a week. Ray Davies stayed nearby and joined us to set the challenges and returned to listen to the outcomes and give feedback.\n\nThe First Evening\n\nFood was all provided so after our first evening meal I think we all wondered when the elusive character himself would show up. We moved up to the top of the converted water tower which was now a massive beautiful open space with a balcony around the edges. Ray arrived and introduced himself. It was all very normal but at the same time completely odd.\n\nThe First Challenge\n\nWe were to get used to this format, and his first challenge was to write a song about why we were there, and we had 1 hour. Now at this point I had never ever completed a full lyric, let alone put chords to a song, and certainly not considered singing the result of such an exercise in public. But when the frontman of The Kinks tells you to do something, you do it.\n\nI was totally outside my comfort zone. I wrote a song called ‘Inside Out’ which talked very simply about getting my feelings from inside me and expressing them in song. I’m fairly sure the song was appalling and probably the singing wasn’t great either being the first time I’d ever sung in public, but that didn’t matter — I had achieved it.\n\nTuesday night down at the local\n\nI think the next day we had to share something we had already written. This was a major challenge for me because I didn’t really have anything complete. I felt massively out of my depth but shared what I did like everyone else with the various song snippets and lyrics I had. At the end of the day it was decided to all go down to the local pub.\n\nThe pub was in the next town but really still very much in the middle of nowhere and I don’t think the locals were expecting ten strangers plus someone looking uncannily like Ray Davies turning up. People muttered and finally someone plucked up the courage to ask him if he was indeed who he looked like, but he denied it.\n\nOne to One with Ray\n\nOver the week we had the opportunity to have some one to one mentoring time with Ray. Showing this master of song, your fragile infantile lyrics was scary but also fantastic. When I arrived he talked about watching some birds flying and mused about it. It was like I could almost see how a song might be forming in his head about all those things. I sat there with the writer of Waterloo Sunset about to talk songwriting; it was quite an unreal situation.\n\nWe talked about the current song challenge he had set, which was to write a song using a story from a newspaper article. I said I had struggled with chord ideas. At this he grabbed my cheap acoustic guitar and played a chord riff as an idea. Again I sat there now watching the writer of “All day and all of the Night” (possibly one of the greatest chord riffs of all time) playing my guitar and effectively helping me write a song!\n\nCinderella and The Kinks\n\nOne of his challenges was for the group to rewrite Cinderella, each of us taking a character to tell their part in the story in song form. The short deadlines and restricted topics I think helped me get something written each time. Each time we played our creations for him face to face and he offered sage advice on them, how to improve them, what he might do. He told us that the Chorus needs to arrive like “a brick through the window”.\n\nAfter he disappeared for the evening we stayed up late and had an impromptu jam session playing a lot of the Kinks songs.\n\nWriting for others\n\nOne of the final challenges of the week was to write a song in the style of one of the other attendees. We had got to know each other really well in the short five days, so it felt achievable. Again it was a great exercise to make us think like another artist and come up with a song that could work for them. I think that was an invaluable lesson for future collaborations.\n\nParting personal advice\n\nIn my final one to one session we talked about my unfinished ideas and my literal carrier bag full of lyric scraps. He complimented some of my existing lyrics and said what he liked about some of the lines; massively encouraging.\n\nHis final advice to me was to go out and buy a 4 track, finish all the incomplete songs and set about recording them. I probably would never have done that without his direct instruction!\n\nI left with a songwriting antenna on ‘100% receive’ mode, it was like there were song titles and ideas in every direction and everywhere I went. The intense week had cured my procrastination (or perhaps fear to complete songs), and had firmly pointed me in a clear direction.\n\nScottish Debut\n\nLater that same year of the songwriting week I travelled with my guitar to Edinburgh on the train. Arriving at my friend’s flat, (one from that week) I had arrived at the city of my open mic debut. I learned that in Edinburgh you went out at 9pm and the pubs and music played until at least 3am or later.\n\nThe purpose of the trip was to play and sing 3 original songs to a packed pub. It was a buzz, probably a few slips and trips over words and chords but I did it. I think from that experience I decided although I was happy writing songs, maybe performing them was for someone else.\n\nThe journey had begun. I was to be a songwriter writing songs for others to sing."
