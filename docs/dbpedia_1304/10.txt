180g Audiophile Clear Vinyl!

Mastered For Vinyl by Friday Music's Joe Reagoso!

Pressed at RTI!

In 1981, the Kinks continued their winning streak with their stellar effort "Give The People What They Want." For this amazing release, Ray Davies, Dave Davies & Co. expand their arena rock sound into a unique brand of rock and storytelling like no other.

With 11 solid rockers including big radio hits like "Destroyer" "Around The Dial" and the huge title track, the entire LP has become an enduring masterwork.

Filled with even more favorites like "Art Lover" & "Better Things", The Kinks truly delivered one of the most important albums of the early '80s with the hard rockin' "Give The People What They Want."

It is with much pleasure to continue the lengthy reissue program with another fine installment in The Kinks/ Friday Music Series with their 18th hit album "Give The People What They Want" now for the very first time anywhere on stunning clear audiophile vinyl. The album, mastered impeccably by Joe Reagoso at Friday Music Studios and Capitol Mastering, features a first time gatefold cover, as well as an LP poster insert.
