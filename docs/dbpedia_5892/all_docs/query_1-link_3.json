You can change your cookie settings at any time.\n\nYou have rejected additional cookies. You can change your cookie settings at any time.\n\nYou can apply for citizenship if you’ve lived in the UK for 5 years and have had one of the following for 12 months:\n\nindefinite leave to remain in the UK\n\n‘settled status’ (also known as ‘indefinite leave to remain under the EU Settlement Scheme’)\n\nindefinite leave to enter the UK (permission to move to the UK permanently from abroad)\n\nYou do not need to wait 12 months to apply if you’re married to a British citizen.\n\nYou must also:\n\nbe over 18\n\nprove you were in the UK exactly 5 years before the day the Home Office receives your application\n\nprove your knowledge of English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic\n\nhave passed the life in the UK test\n\nintend to continue living in the UK\n\nbe of good character - read the naturalisation guidance\n\nResidency requirements\n\nYou must have lived in the UK for at least 5 years before the date of your application. You also should not have broken any UK immigration laws.\n\nIf you have indefinite leave to enter or remain, the Home Office will not usually check if you broke any immigration laws before then.\n\nYou cannot include any time spent in the UK when you’re exempt from immigration control as a:\n\ndiplomat\n\nmember of a diplomat’s staff or household\n\nmember of visiting armed forces\n\nTime you’ve spent outside the UK\n\nYou should not have:\n\nspent more than 450 days outside the UK during the 5 years before your application\n\nspent more than 90 days outside the UK in the last 12 months\n\nbroken any UK immigration laws (for example living illegally in the UK)\n\nYou may have lost your indefinite leave to remain or enter if you’ve been away from the UK for:\n\nmore than 2 years at any time since you got it (you’ll need to apply for a Returning Resident visa)\n\nmore than 5 years if you have settled status\n\nmore than 4 years if you are a Swiss citizen, or the family member of a Swiss citizen, and you have settled status\n\nThis is one way to apply for British citizenship. Check if you’re eligible another way.\n\nWhen to apply\n\nYou must have been physically present in the UK exactly 5 years before the Home Office receives your application.\n\nYour application may be rejected if you were not in the UK exactly 5 years before the Home Office received it. This depends on the reason why you were not in the UK. The Home Office will consider if there are special circumstances, for example:\n\nyou were not able to live in the UK at the start of the 5 year period because of health reasons or travel restrictions\n\nyou were told to leave the UK during the 5 years but this decision was later overturned\n\nExample\n\nIf the Home Office receives your application on 20 June 2022, but you left the UK on 10 June 2017 and returned to the UK on 25 June 2017, you will not qualify. You’ll need to wait until 24 June 2022 to apply.\n\nThe date the Home Office receives your application depends on how you apply. If you apply online, your application will be received on the same day. It will take longer if you apply by post.\n\nHow much it costs\n\nIt costs £1,630 to apply.\n\nYou’ll also need to have your biometric information (fingerprints and a photo) taken - there’s no fee for this. You’ll be told how to do this after you’ve applied."
