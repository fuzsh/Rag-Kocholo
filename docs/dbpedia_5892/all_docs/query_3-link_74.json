        "text": "The award-winning theatre and film actor Antony Sher has died aged 72 after suffering from cancer, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) announced on Friday.\n\nSouth Africa-born Sher was widely considered to be one of Britain’s finest contemporary actors, playing almost all the great Shakespearean roles from King Lear to Shylock.\n\nIn 1985, he won an Olivier Award for his energetic portrayal of Richard III as a villainous hunchback, propelling himself around the stage on crutches.\n\nWhile at the RSC, Sher -- once described by Prince Charles as his favourite actor -- met his husband, Gregory Doran, who would become the company’s artistic director.\n\nThey were one of the first gay couples to enter a civil partnership in Britain in 2005.\n\nIn September, Doran stepped back from his role to care for his husband after his condition was diagnosed as terminal.\n\nRSC executive director Catherine Mallyon and acting artistic director Erica Whyman, said they were “deeply saddened” at Sher’s death.\n\n“Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with Greg, and with Antony’s family and their friends at this devastating time,” they added.\n\nHe became “Sir Antony” after receiving a knighthood in 2000, and said having his mother in attendance at Buckingham Palace was one of his proudest moments."
