        "text": "In somber language, Section 349(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act details a U.S. citizen’s right to renounce his or her citizenship by voluntarily “making a formal renunciation of nationality before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in a foreign state, in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State,” and by signing an oath of renunciation.\n\nThe government maintains a federal register of individuals who have renounced their citizenship. In the report issued in July 2023 as well as October 2023, the list of names spanned 12 pages. However, the report published in January 2024 showed a spike in individuals leaving with the report now spanning 17 pages. Why would someone renounce their U.S. citizenship?\n\nThe Process and the Impact of Expatriation\n\nAbandoning citizenship has serious consequences: You give up the benefits granted to U.S. citizens, including the right to vote in U.S. elections, government protection, and assistance while traveling overseas, citizenship for children born abroad, access to federal jobs, and unrestricted travel into and out of the country.\n\nWhat's more, renunciation is not as easy as throwing out your passport. It’s a lengthy legal process that involves paperwork, interviews, and money. Because of the increase in the number of U.S. citizens seeking renunciation, the U.S. Department of State raised the fee for renunciation from $450 to $2,350, around five times more than the average cost in other high-income countries like the United Kingdom. In addition, some high-income citizens may owe a type of capital gains tax called an “exit tax” (officially called an expatriation tax).\n\nIt’s important to recognize that in nearly all cases, a renunciation is an irrevocable act, meaning you won’t be able to change your mind and regain U.S. citizenship. Despite these (and other) consequences, more and more people are choosing to renounce their U.S. citizenship. Here’s why.\n\nWhy So Many Renunciations?\n\nWhile the reasons for abandoning citizenship vary from one person to the next, the recent spike in numbers is largely due to newer tax laws, including the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) of 2010. According to the IRS, FATCA is “an important development in U.S. efforts to combat tax evasion by U.S. persons holding accounts and other financial assets offshore.” FATCA focuses on reporting by:\n\nU.S. taxpayers about their foreign financial accounts and offshore assets\n\nForeign financial institutions regarding financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers\n\nForeign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest\n\nUnder FATCA, certain U.S. taxpayers with financial assets outside the U.S. that total more than the reporting threshold must report their assets to the IRS, using Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets (the threshold varies based on your filing status and whether you live in the U.S. or abroad).\n\nThe IRS warns there are “serious penalties for not reporting these financial assets.” It should be noted the FATCA requirements are in addition to Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), the long-standing requirement for reporting foreign financial accounts. The penalties for failing to comply are significant, and, in some cases, involve criminal liability.\n\nIn addition to financial reporting requirements is the issue of double taxation. Unlike most countries, the U.S. has citizen-based taxation, meaning citizens are taxed regardless of where in the world they live and where they earned their income. While foreign tax credits can reduce the tax burden, they do not eliminate all double taxes, particularly for higher-income earners, who end up filing and paying taxes both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe current tax laws—and the reporting, filing and tax obligations that accompany them—have made many Americans choose to renounce their citizenship, not just because of the money, but because they find the tax compliance and disclosure laws inconvenient, onerous, and even unfair.\n\nOne other side effect of FATCA—and the requirement for foreign financial institutions to report information to the U.S. regarding U.S. citizens’ accounts—is that many foreign banks don’t want to deal with American clients at all. As a result, many U.S. citizens have been turned away by financial institutions abroad, a frustrating problem if you live overseas and want to pay your bills.\n\nRise of Nomadic Lifestyles\n\nThe lifestyle of global nomads, characterized by constant travel and residence in diverse countries, presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. Though the nomadic lifestyle existed prior to COVID-19, the pandemic brought about greater awareness and adoption to the lifestyle.\n\nA nomadic lifestyle poses some practical challenges, particularly in the context of citizenship. Some countries require citizens to maintain a permanent residence or fulfill specific residency obligations. For global nomads, renouncing citizenship may become a practical solution to navigate the complexities associated with constant travel.\n\nAccording to MBO Partners, the population of digital nomads in the U.S. rose dramatically from 2019 to 2020, increasing nearly 50%. Other sources cite there was nearly 17 million digital nomads in the United States alone during the pandemic. Though these statistics do not indicate those leaving the U.S. for this type of lifestyle, it does support the notion that nomadic lifestyle adoption has been on the rise and could perpetuate U.S. citizenship renouncement.\n\nDual Citizenship\n\nDual citizenship can also be a path that leads to one citizenship being renounced. One primary challenge is the potential conflict of laws and loyalties. Holding citizenship in two different countries may subject individuals to conflicting legal obligations. This could arise due to military service obligations, taxes, or legal policies.\n\nAnother critical consideration in the administrative angle. Managing multiple passports, dealing with tax implications in different jurisdictions, and navigating bureaucratic complexities can cause folks to renounce one of their citizenships. Keep in mind that in 2023, the United States welcomed 878,500 new citizens; though it's not directly known how many currently possess dual citizenship, each of these people could have retained citizenship in their home country only to later renounce of the two.\n\nOther Reasons for Renunciation\n\nHistorically, Americans have occasionally renounced their citizenship for other reasons. For example, opposition to U.S. policy during the Vietnam War. Certain acts can also cause an individual to lose U.S. citizenship without formally renouncing it. Under the Internal Revenue Code and/or the Immigration and Nationality Act (found in Title 8 of the United States Code), citizenship can be terminated (and therefore relinquished, not renounced) for several reasons, including:\n\nApplying for and becoming a naturalized citizen of another country (with exception of Dual Nationality)\n\nMaking an oath of allegiance to another country\n\nJoining the armed services of another country engaged in a war against the U.S., or joining the armed services of another country as an officer\n\nWorking for a foreign government while simultaneously a citizen of that county\n\nAccepting employment by a foreign government in a job where an oath of allegiance, affirmation, or other formal declaration of allegiance is required\n\nRenouncing U.S. citizenship in a time of war, with the U.S. Attorney General’s approval\n\nCommitting an act of treason or an attempt to overthrow the U.S. government by force (and being convicted by court-martial or a civil court)\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nToday, tax laws are resulting in record numbers of people renouncing their U.S. citizenship each year. However, it’s not as easy as putting your passport through the shredder. Because the law states that those wishing to renounce their U.S. citizenship must do so in person before a U.S. consular or diplomatic officer while in a foreign country, U.S. citizens cannot renounce their citizenship by mail, through a third party, or while in the United States.\n\nRenunciation has significant consequences. Aside from giving up the benefits granted to U.S. citizens, the U.S. Department of State advises that anyone considering renunciation of their U.S. citizenship should understand that, in almost all cases, the act is irrevocable. Renouncing one's citizenship is one of the most solemn decisions anyone can make. Carefully weigh the pros and cons for yourself and your family. It is also recommended that you consult with an experienced tax professional to understand the tax consequences of renunciation."
