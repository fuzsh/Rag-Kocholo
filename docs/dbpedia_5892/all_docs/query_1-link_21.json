        "text": "Are you thinking of applying to naturalise as a British citizen?\n\nOr were you born outside of the UK, and you are a child of a British national?\n\nOr are you a parent with limited leave to remain, and your child/children were born here, and want to know if they are British nationals by birth?\n\nWe regularly advise and assist clients with Successful Naturalisation and Registration applications.\n\nFind out how my Award Winning Service can help you\n\nto Naturalise / Register as a British Citizen Here.\n\nBecome a British Citizen\n\nBecoming a British citizen after having permanent residency/settlement in the UK is the usual route for some people. However, many people mistakenly believe that this is an automatic right, when in fact, becoming a British Citizen is at the discretion of the Home Secretary.\n\nWhat does being a British Citizen mean?\n\nIt means that you have the right to permanently live and work in the UK without any immigration restrictions, since you have what is otherwise known as a right of abode in the UK. Providing you meet all of the requirements under the British Nationality Act (1981) to become a British citizen, you may be able to apply for British citizenship through either the process of naturalisation or registration.\n\nIf you were born outside the UK, and have legally lived continuously in the UK for 5 years or more, and you have had had Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) or Settled Status as an EU National or as a dependant of an EU National, you may be eligible to apply for British Citizenship.\n\nThe requirements are: You must:\n\nAlternatively, you may be able to register as a British citizen instead of applying for naturalisation.\n\nThere are various complicated categories here including if you are a British Overseas citizen or Overseas Territory citizen, or you have previously given up your citizenship, or you are a person who is stateless.\n\nYou can also register if you were born in the UK and your parents are settled in the UK, or if you were born outside of the UK to British parent/s before the 1st of July 2006.\n\nEach category has different requirements that must be met.\n\nIf you would like to discuss your case properly, we recommend booking a consultation with us.\n\nThe current home office fee for Naturalisation is £1,630* and the fee for Registration (as an adult) is currently £1,481*. *Both include a citizenship ceremony fee of £130. It is important to note that Home Office Immigration and nationality fees are always subject to change. - You can find the latest Home Office fees published here.\n\nOther costs you may need to consider are the 'Life in the UK Test' which is £50 and the 'English Language Test' which is approximately £150.\n\nWhen To Apply:\n\nOnce you have obtained the British citizenship certificate, you will be able to apply for a British passport. This is the most acceptable evidence of British citizenship although, alternatively, you may be able to apply for a nationality status document if you do not have the right documentation to apply for a passport.\n\nWhen Not to Apply:\n\nMany people mistakenly believe that after they have had ILR or settlement status in the UK, that they can automatically apply for a British passport without first applying to naturalise as a British citizen.\n\nThis is a costly mistake to make, since the fees to the Home Office for such applications, once submitted, cannot be refunded.\n\nWant your Application to be completely managed by a Naturalisation Specialist?\n\n* Get Expert Advice and Support to submit your Naturalisation or Registration Application.\n\n* Get Full Guidance on Satisfying all of the Requirements and ensuring you have the correct Supporting Documents.\n\n* Have your Application processed Quickly and Efficiently.\n\n* Ensures your Application has the Highest Chance of Success."
