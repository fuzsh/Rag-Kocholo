        "text": "A person with dual citizenship is a citizen of two countries at the same time, which has both advantages and disadvantages because it is a complex legal status. One benefit of dual citizenship that is often cited is the ability of an individual to possess two passports. But one potential drawback is the possibility of double taxation. Below, we explore these and other pros and cons of being a citizen of two countries at once.\n\nWhat Is Dual Citizenship?\n\nDual citizenship, which is also called dual nationality, means holding citizenship of two countries at the same time. This means you can have citizenship through birth in one country and be naturalized in another. For instance, you may be a citizen of the United States and become a citizen of another country. This may happen automatically. For instance:\n\nA child born in the U.S. to parents who are residents of a foreign country may qualify for dual citizenship. Unless the parents are foreign diplomats, the child generally becomes a citizen of the U.S., in addition to any citizenship they inherit from their parents.\n\nSimilarly, if a child of U.S. citizens is born overseas, they may automatically become a citizen of both the U.S. and their country of birth (although this is situational because it depends on that specific countryâ€™s laws).\n\nDual citizenship can also be achieved through specialized legal processes, such as when a foreign national is naturalized as a U.S. citizen. In this case, that person would become a citizen of both countries, unless their home country does not allow dual citizenship.\n\nSome countries also allow people to become naturalized through investment. This means contributing to another country's economy or cultural development. For instance, you can secure citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis by making a minimum investment of $250,000 in the country.\n\nKeep in mind that not every country recognizes dual citizenship. For instance, Austria, India, Japan, and Norway are some of the countries that prohibit holding two passports. As such, you may need to renounce your birth citizenship to become a citizen of a new country.\n\nAdvantages of Dual Citizenship\n\nPolitical Rights\n\nDual citizens can participate fully in the political life of every country where they have citizenship. This includes the right to vote and make donations to political candidates.\n\nWork and Travel\n\nUnlike foreigners, dual citizens do not need a visa or permit to visit the countries where they have citizenship, and they can stay for as long as they like. They also have the right to seek work in both countries, while foreigners must pass through an at-times lengthy process to get a work permit. They are also exempt from any restrictions on foreign businesspeople.\n\nSocial Services\n\nDual citizens can receive the benefits and privileges offered by each country where they are a citizen. For example, they may travel to receive medical treatment or procedures that are not available in the other country where they are a citizen. They can also receive an education at the same price as domestic students.\n\nTwo Passports\n\nAs a dual citizen, you are allowed to carry passports from both countries. For example, if you are a citizen of the U.S. and New Zealand, you can travel more easily between these two countries. Having a citizen's passport eliminates the need for long-stay visas and any questions about the purpose of your trip during the customs process.\n\nHolding two passports also guarantees the individual the right to enter both countries, which can be beneficial if you have family members to visit in both countries or if you are a student or a businessperson who studies or conducts affairs in both countries.\n\nIt's important to note that people who are dual citizens of the U.S. and another country must use a U.S. passport when traveling to and from the United States. This is often the case with many other countries.\n\nProperty Ownership\n\nAnother benefit of dual citizenship is the ability to own property in either country. Some countries restrict land ownership to citizens only. As a legal citizen of two countries, you would be able to purchase property in either or both countries.\n\nIf you travel frequently between the two countries, this might be especially useful, since property ownership might offer a more economical way to live in two places.\n\nCultural Education\n\nAs a dual citizen, you'll reap the benefits of being immersed in the culture of two countries. Some government officials tend to be fond of dual citizenship because they see it as a way to promote the country's image as a prime destination for tourists.\n\nDual citizenship offers individuals the opportunity to learn about the history of both countries, learn two or more languages, and experience a different way of life.\n\nDisadvantages of Dual Citizenship\n\nDual Obligations\n\nAs a dual citizen, you are bound by the laws of both countries. For example, if you are a citizen of the U.S. and a country with mandatory military service, you can lose your U.S. citizenship under certain circumstances. This includes serving as an officer in a foreign military engaged in a war against the U.S.\n\nIn general, U.S. policy recognizes that dual citizens might be legally obligated to fulfill military obligations abroad, and many can do so without jeopardizing their U.S. citizen status, but it is important to research each situation carefully.\n\nDouble Taxation\n\nFor individuals who are dual citizens of the U.S. and another country, the U.S. imposes taxes on its citizens for income earned anywhere in the world. If you live in your country of dual residence that is not the U.S., you may owe taxes both to the U.S. government and to the country where the income was earned.\n\nHowever, income tax treaties between the U.S. and other countries serve to effectively reduce or eliminate an individual's tax liability to avoid double taxation.\n\nFor example, a treaty between the U.S. and New Zealand overrides the income tax laws of each country to avoid double taxation. Even so, dual citizens may be required to file U.S. tax returns even if they are living and earning income in New Zealand.\n\nBecause tax laws are complicated and can change from year to year, it's important for individuals facing this situation to consult with a qualified tax accountant.\n\nBarriers to Some Forms of Employment\n\nDepending on your career path, dual citizenship can be a disadvantage. If you want to work with the U.S. government or your job requires access to information that is considered classified by the U.S. government, having dual citizenship may bar you from gaining the security clearance you need for this type of employment. Those born into dual citizenship may encounter fewer problems than those who actively sought it out.\n\nA Complicated Process\n\nSometimes dual citizenship happens automatically, such as when a child is born in the U.S. to foreign parents. In other cases, the process can take many years and can be extremely expensive and complicated. This can deter some people from pursuing dual citizenship.\n\nHow to Gain Dual Citizenship in the United States\n\nThere are many requirements for gaining dual citizenship if you were not born in the U.S. and want to become a U.S. citizen. In addition, the requirements for gaining citizenship in the U.S. may be different for individuals based on their circumstances and their other country (or countries) of residence.\n\nTo apply for U.S. citizenship, you must generally have lived in the U.S. as a permanent resident and have a green card continuously for five years (or three years if you are filing as the spouse of a U.S. citizen). Other eligibility requirements include being at least 18 years old when you apply and being able to read, write, and speak basic English.\n\nYou must pay a fee to apply for permanent residency and then another fee to file a citizenship application. The fee depends on what application you use and your filing category. This fee is set by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nFor most people, the complicated process of gaining citizenship requires the help of an immigration lawyer. Immigration lawyers can help individuals achieve citizenship, although they also require fees for their services. To apply for permanent residency, most individuals file form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. To apply for naturalization, most individuals file form N-400, the application for naturalization.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
