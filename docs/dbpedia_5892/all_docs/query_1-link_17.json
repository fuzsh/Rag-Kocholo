If you were born inside the United Kingdom after 1 January 1983, you would be a British citizen by birth if at least one of your parents was a British citizen or settled in the UK when you were born.\n\nWhat are the mandatory British citizenship by descent requirements?\n\nA British citizen by descent is someone who was registered as a British citizen or who was born outside the UK to a British parent. If a British citizen by descent’s child is born overseas, they cannot normally pass their citizenship directly on, they may need to register the child for British citizenship, if eligible. If the other parent is a British citizen otherwise than by descent, for example, someone British by birth, naturalisation or adoption, then that parent should be able to pass their citizenship directly on to the child.\n\nWhat are the documents required to obtain British citizenship?\n\nYou will need to provide the following documents with your application (this is not an exhaustive list):\n\nYour passport/travel document and Biometric Residence Permit (if applicable)\n\nProof you have Indefinite Leave to Remain\n\nEvidence of your English language proficiency\n\nYour Life in the UK test pass certificate\n\nYour marriage or civil partnership certificate (if applicable)\n\nP60s (or other evidence of economic activity covering the period you have lived (and worked) in the UK)\n\nPayslips (or other evidence of finances)\n\nSelf-employed applicants require self-assessment statements for each year of the six /five years\n\nWhat documents do I need to register for British citizenship?\n\nThis depends on the basis of the claim to British citizenship. In some cases, you may need to provide evidence of residency in the UK.\n\nIs dual citizenship allowed in the UK?\n\nYes, British laws allow all citizens to hold another nationality or nationalities.\n\nWhat is the British citizenship fee?\n\nThe Home Office fee for naturalisation is £1,330 (including the £80 British citizenship fee). The biometric enrolment fee is £19.20.\n\nThe Home Office fee for adult registration is £1,206 (including the £80 British citizenship fee). The biometric enrolment fee is £19.20.\n\nThe Home Office fee for child registration is £1,012 (an additional £80 British citizenship fee would be charged if the minor turned 18 during the application process).\n\nThere are no priority services available for naturalisation.\n\nWhat is the British Citizenship Ceremony?\n\nTo complete the process of becoming a British citizen, you will need to attend a citizenship ceremony. At the ceremony, you will take an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Crown and a pledge of loyalty to the United Kingdom. This is a formal promise to His Majesty the King and the United Kingdom. Once you have taken the oath and given the pledge, you will be presented with your certificate of British citizenship, which is the legal evidence that you are a British citizen.\n\nThe cost of the Citizenship Ceremony is £80, which is paid when you submit your application for British Citizenship.\n\nYou must bring a copy of the Citizenship ceremony invitation to the ceremony. If you do not, your ceremony will be postponed. You must also bring photo ID to the ceremony, as the registrar may ask to see this.\n\nCan I become a British citizen?\n\nWhether you can become a British citizen depends on your circumstances. There may be more than one way for you to apply and if this is the case, you can choose which route to use.\n\nYou can apply for British citizenship if:\n\nyou have resided in the UK for five years or more; and\n\nyou have held Indefinite Leave to Remain for 12 months or more, or\n\nyou have held EU Settled Status for 12 months or more.\n\nSpouses of British citizens can apply for naturalisation having resided in the UK for three years if:\n\nthey have Indefinite Leave to Remain, or\n\nan EEA Settled Status.\n\nYou may also be eligible to apply for British citizenship if:\n\nyou have a British parent\n\nyou are stateless\n\nyou hold another type of British nationality\n\nat some stage, you renounced your British citizenship.\n\nIf you are a Commonwealth citizen, you may qualify for British citizenship under the Windrush scheme if:\n\nyou or your parents came to the UK before 1973\n\nyou live in the country and have not left the UK for more than two years\n\nHow do I apply for British citizenship?\n\nOverseas applicants can now apply online. You will need to fill out an online form and answer all questions that are relevant to your application. You can edit and download the application before it is submitted. Our team can provide you with advice on the best options available to you and your family.\n\nWho can be a referee for my British citizenship application?\n\nOne referee must be a person of any nationality who is a professional, such as a doctor or minister of religion. A lawyer can act as a referee, but this must not be the person representing you in your application. The second referee must be a British citizen and also either a Professional Person or over 25 years old.\n\nWhat are the immigration routes for British citizenship registration?\n\nIt may be possible for adults to register as a British citizen on the following basis:-\n\nBorn before 1 January 1983 to a British mother.\n\nYou have another form of British nationality.\n\nAdults and children may be eligible to register if:\n\nThey were born in the UK; and\n\nneither of their parents was British or settled; and\n\nthey lived the first 10 years of their lives in the UK; and\n\nin any of the first 10 years, they have not spent more than 90 days outside the UK.\n\nA non-British child (under 18) may become eligible to register as a British citizen if they were born in the United Kingdom and one of their parents has been granted Indefinite Leave to Remain/Settled status.\n\nA non-British child born outside the UK to a parent who has been granted ILR may also be able to apply for registration in limited circumstances.\n\nHow long does the British citizenship application process take?\n\nThe application can take as long as six months to move through the system but applications are often decided much sooner. Once approved, you will receive your approval letter and shortly after will receive a citizenship invitation letter. You will need to arrange a citizenship ceremony at your local registry office as soon as possible. Ceremonies are subject to availability. You will only become a British citizen once you have attended your ceremony and received your certificate of naturalisation. You can apply for your first British passport once the process of naturalisation is complete.\n\nHow can I track my British citizenship application status?\n\nOnce you have submitted your application and paid the relevant fee, you will have a unique reference number for your application. This reference will also be used when you upload your supporting documents and enrol biometric data. However, it is not normally possible to track your application directly. If any additional documents are required, the Home Office caseworker will contact you in writing. If the application falls outside the normal service standard, you should receive an email confirming this. When your application is decided, you will receive an email confirming the decision.\n\nWhat are the advantages of becoming a British citizen?\n\nThere are many advantages to becoming a British citizen. One of the most important is the emotional peace of mind of knowing you have as much right to remain in the UK as a person who was born here, regardless of future government policies.\n\nOthers include:\n\nYou can travel in and out of the UK freely and for as long as you want.\n\nYou can fully participate in all local and general elections and exercise your right to vote.\n\nYou will be eligible for all state benefits and healthcare.\n\nWhat is the British citizenship application form?\n\nThe application form for British citizenship depends on the type of citizenship application you are making. Most British citizenship applications are processed online. As an applicant, you should check the type of citizenship application you require and then complete the form online. Payment would also be processed online and you would be able to access a different portal to upload supporting documents and book a biometric appointment.\n\nForm AN is the correct form for naturalisation and form MN1 is the correct form to register a child.\n\nHow can I become a British citizen by naturalisation?\n\nYou will need to:-\n\nCheck you meet the requirements, including residency requirements and good character requirements.\n\nGather the necessary supporting evidence for your application.\n\nSeek references from two individuals who meet the requirements to act as referees for your application.\n\nComplete an online form.\n\nSubmit the form and pay the relevant fee.\n\nUpload scanned copies of your supporting documents to the correct online portal.\n\nBook and attend a biometric appointment.\n\nCooperate with the Home Office in case of any requests for additional information during the decision-making process, if applicable.\n\nOn receipt of your approval you will be issued with a citizenship invitation letter – you must arrange a citizenship ceremony as soon as possible and within three months of the letter. You will not be a British citizen until you have completed your ceremony.\n\nAttend your ceremony, where you will be required to swear an oath/affirmation of allegiance and you will be given your certificate of naturalisation.\n\nWhat is the application for British citizenship by naturalisation?\n\nThe application for British citizenship by naturalisation is the application process overseas nationals undertake to become a full citizen of Great Britain and the United Kingdom. All naturalisation applications made to the government are considered on a discretionary basis, which means that, although the requirements to be met for naturalisation are written in the law, no applicant is considered to have the “right” to citizenship by virtue of meeting these requirements. The requirements for naturalisation are clearly defined, but each and every case will be considered individually.\n\nHow can I acquire British citizenship by marriage?\n\nMarriage to a British citizen does not qualify you directly for British citizenship. To qualify for British citizenship, you must also have been granted Indefinite Leave to Remain, whether that ILR status was granted on the basis of a spousal visa or on another immigration route. In addition to being married to a British citizen and holding ILR status, you must have also resided in the UK for three years prior to your application.\n\nCan you renounce British Citizenship or nationality?\n\nYou do have an option to renounce (give up) your British Citizenship or nationality. If accepted, you’ll get a ‘declaration of renunciation’ that you can use to show that you’re no longer a British citizen.\n\nOne reason why someone may choose to renounce their British citizenship is if they want to become a citizen of another country that does not allow dual citizenship.\n\nThere are only two circumstances where you can renounce your British citizenship or nationality:\n\nyou already have another citizenship or nationality\n\nyou’re going to get another citizenship or nationality after giving up your British citizenship or status\n\nThe other requirements to be satisfied to renounce your British citizenship are:\n\nyou must be aged 18 or over (unless you’re under 18 and married).\n\nyou are of sound mind (unless it’s decided that it’s in your best interest).\n\nWhy Choose AY & J Solicitors while applying for British citizenship?\n\nThe British Nationality Act 1981 is complex and very challenging. It is essential to seek expertise from a British citizenship solicitor who specializes in this very technical field of law for a successful British citizenship application. The highly qualified lawyers at A Y & J Solicitors are passionate about helping clients to gain citizenship. They take the time needed to ensure you understand the process and will assist with all the details required for the application.\n\nCan EU or EEA nationals acquire British Citizenship, and how can your team assist with the immigration process?\n\nAcquiring British Citizenship offers a way for EU or EEA nationals to secure their residency status in the UK permanently. It provides certainty and stability in terms of rights and benefits, ensuring individuals can continue to live and work in the UK without any restrictions.\n\nOur team is dedicated to providing expert advice and representation to EU or EEA nationals seeking to obtain Permanent Residency status and British Citizenship. We understand the concerns and anxieties you may have and are here to guide you through the entire process, ensuring a smooth and successful application.\n\nWhat is the British citizenship 90-day rule?\n\nAs a qualifying condition for naturalisation as a British citizen, you cannot have been absent from the UK for more than 90 days in the 12 months prior to your naturalisation application.\n\nCan a refugee acquire British citizenship?\n\nI was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain. When can I apply for British citizenship?\n\nUnless you are married to a British citizen, you will need to wait 12 months from the date your ILR was granted to apply for naturalisation as a British citizen. You must also have lived in the UK for five years, prior to the application date to be eligible to apply.\n\nThose married to British citizens can apply for naturalisation as soon as they hold ILR status. They must also have lived in the UK for three years prior to the application date to be eligible to apply.\n\nWhat are the differences between British citizenship and ILR (Indefinite Leave to Remain)?\n\nIndefinite Leave to Remain status (ILR) grants the holder permission to stay in the UK without any time limit. Holders of ILR can live, work and study in the UK without seeking prior permission. They can access healthcare and benefits and also may qualify to sponsor certain family members to join them in the UK from overseas. Children born in the UK to those who hold ILR status would automatically be British by birth.\n\nNotably, someone with ILR status can be deported and their ILR status revoked.\n\nMost critically, if the ILR holder stays outside the UK continuously for two years or more, they would lose their ILR status (their status would lapse). If ILR status lapses, they may need to apply for a new visa to return to the UK. In contrast, British citizenship can be revoked under the most serious circumstances, but it cannot be lost through any period of absence from the UK.\n\nWhat can I do if my application for British citizenship is refused?\n\nApplications for British citizenship can be refused for many reasons. One of the most common is that the application form has been filled in incorrectly and/or the correct documentation has not been supplied.\n\nIf your application has been refused, our immigration lawyers will examine the reason why and provide expert advice on the best plan of action. This could include resubmitting the application or seeking a judicial review.\n\nWhat does the ‘good character’ requirement mean?\n\nThere is no statutory definition of good character and no statutory guidance on the interpretation or application of the requirement. There is, however, internal guidance to Home Office decision-makers in the form of the Nationality Guidance (NG) good character requirement, which provides information on how it is applied in practice in relation to all relevant applications for British citizenship.\n\nThings which may lead immigration officials to believe you are not of good character include (but are not limited to):\n\na criminal conviction\n\ndeception in your dealings with immigration officials\n\nfinancial matters including bankruptcy, debt, unlawful recourse to public funds, or non-payment of council tax\n\nnotoriety in the local or wider community.\n\nIf you believe that some aspect of your application may mean that you fail to meet the good character requirement, speak to one of our immigration lawyers."
