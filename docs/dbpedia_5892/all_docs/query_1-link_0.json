        "text": "There are different ways to apply for British citizenship (or ‘naturalisation’) based on your circumstances.\n\nIf you’re eligible in more than one way you can choose which way to apply.\n\nIf you’ve applied for citizenship, you’ll need permission to stay in the UK until you’re granted citizenship. Your permission needs to last until you have had your citizenship ceremony.\n\nIf you have indefinite leave to remain (ILR) or settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, this counts as permission to stay.\n\nIf you were born in the UK\n\nYou do not automatically get British citizenship if you were born in the UK. It depends on when you were born and your parents’ circumstances. You need to check if you’re a British citizen.\n\nYou may be eligible to apply for citizenship if you were born in the UK and are not automatically a British citizen.\n\nIf you’re married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen\n\nTo apply as the spouse or civil partner of a British citizen you must have lived in the UK for the last 3 years.\n\nYou’ll also need to have either:\n\nindefinite leave to remain (ILR)\n\nsettled status under the EU Settlement Scheme\n\nIf you do, you’ll be eligible to apply for citizenship immediately.\n\nIf you have indefinite leave to remain (ILR)\n\nYou can usually apply for ILR after you’ve lived in the UK for 5 years.\n\nTo apply for citizenship with ILR you must usually have lived in the UK for 12 months after getting it.\n\nIf you have ‘settled status’ under the EU Settlement Scheme\n\nTo apply for citizenship with settled status you must usually have lived in the UK for 12 months after getting it.\n\nIf you have not applied to the EU Settlement Scheme\n\nYou might still be able to apply for settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme. You can then use this to apply for citizenship.\n\nThe deadline to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme for most people was 30 June 2021. You can still apply if you have ‘reasonable grounds’ for not being able to apply by the deadline.\n\nOther ways you can be eligible\n\nYou may be eligible to apply for citizenship if:\n\nyou have a British parent\n\nyou have another type of British nationality\n\nyou have a parent with British overseas territories citizenship\n\nyou’re stateless\n\nyou previously gave up (renounced) your citizenship\n\nother special circumstances apply to you\n\nyou’re a Chagossian descendant (a direct descendant of someone born in British Indian Ocean Territory)\n\nIf you’re a Commonwealth citizen\n\nYou may be eligible to apply for citizenship under the Windrush Scheme if both:\n\nyou or one of your parents arrived in the UK before 1973\n\nyou’ve lived in the UK and not been away from it for more than 2 years\n\nIf your parent arrived in the UK before 1973, you must have either:"
