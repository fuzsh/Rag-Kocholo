Ireland is no different. So, how do you become an Irish citizen by naturalisation? There are three main ways you can apply for Irish citizenship by naturalisation:\n\n1\n\nYou have legally lived in Ireland for five years\n\n2\n\nYou are married to or in a civil partnership with an Irish citizen\n\n3\n\nYou are applying on behalf of a minor.\n\nIf you are in Ireland as a refugee, you can also become an Irish citizen after three years. We have a system in place to help you through the citizenship process.\n\nEach pathway to citizenship has its own specific requirements, which are explained below. However, generally you must:\n\nHave the correct identity documents to prove who you are\n\nHave the correct residency documents to prove that you have legally lived in Ireland for the correct number of years\n\nReach the correct total score on the citizenship scorecard system.\n\nAll citizenship applications are processed by the Citizenship Division in Immigration Service Delivery (ISD).\n\nWho is eligible for citizenship by naturalisation?\n\nA. You are an adult and have legally lived in Ireland for five years\n\nTo be eligible to apply for naturalisation based on residence, you must meet the following criteria:\n\nYou must be 18 years of age or over\n\nYou must be able to prove your identity\n\nYou must meet the relevant conditions for residence\n\nYou must have continuously lived in Ireland for a full one year period right before you apply. You can be away for up to 70 days during this year, with an extra 30 days allowed in exceptional cases, at the discretion of the Minister\n\nAdditionally, during the eight years immediately before that period, you must have a total residence in Ireland of four years\n\nYou must have proof of residency in Ireland for every year of residency claimed\n\nYou must intend to reside in Ireland after you become a citizen\n\nYou must be willing to attend a citizenship ceremony and make a declaration of fidelity\n\nYou must be of good character.\n\nPlease note: If you had permission to live in the State but you spent long periods of time abroad, you must provide as much detailed information as possible in support of your application.\n\nIn addition to proving your legal residence, you must show that you have built up enough reckonable residence in Ireland to be granted citizenship, specifically:\n\n1825 or 1826 days of reckonable residence based on your accumulated permission stamps. Calculate your reckonable residence here\n\nThis includes 365 or 366 days (1 year) of continuous residence immediately before the date you apply.\n\nYou can do this by showing your accumulated immigration permission stamps or documents from the Department of Justice indicating your permissions granted.\n\nMake sure you keep your immigration permission registered (with no gaps) during your residence. Gaps in your registration may lead to your application for citizenship being deemed ineligible.\n\nYou may apply for citizenship as a dependant young adult if you meet the eligibility requirements for an adult application and you:\n\nAre aged 18-23 when you apply\n\nEntered the State legally as part of a family unit\n\nAre currently attending secondary school in the State, or you went directly from secondary school into third level education in the State\n\nAre continuously dependent on your parents and you are not financially independent.\n\nTo apply as a UK, EU/EEA and Swiss national, you must have been a UK, EU/EEA or Swiss national for more than 5 years. If not, you must apply as a non-EU/EEA and non-Swiss national.\n\nB. You are married to – or in a civil partnership with – an Irish citizen\n\nYou may be applying for citizenship based on marriage to an Irish citizen. You may be applying based on civil partnership with an Irish citizen. To be eligible to apply in both cases, remember:\n\nYou must be 18 years of age or over\n\nYou must be able to prove your identity\n\nYou must be married to – or in a civil partnership with – an Irish citizen for three years or more. The marriage or civil relationship must be genuine and enduring\n\nYou must be living with your spouse or civil partner on the date you apply for citizenship and on the date you are granted citizenship\n\nYou must have lived legally on the island of Ireland for three out of the last five years before making your application. This must include one full year of continuous residence immediately prior to your application. Absences up to 70 days are permitted within this year, with an additional 30 in exceptional circumstances, at the discretion of the Minister\n\nYou must have proof of residency in Ireland for every year of residency claimed\n\nYou must intend to reside in Ireland after you become a citizen\n\nYou must be willing to attend a citizenship ceremony and make a declaration of fidelity\n\nYou must be of good character.\n\nPlease note: In addition to your own proof of residency documents, you will need to send us proof of residency for your Irish spouse or civil partner. These are outlined in the Citizenship Guidance Document.\n\nIn addition to proving your legal residence, you must show that you have built up enough reckonable residence in Ireland to be granted citizenship, specifically:\n\n1095 or 1096 days of reckonable residence based on your accumulated permission stamps. Calculate your reckonable residence here\n\nThis includes 365 or 366 days (1 year) of continuous residence immediately before the date you apply.\n\nYou can do this by showing your accumulated immigration permission stamps or documents from the Department of Justice indicating your permissions granted.\n\nMake sure you keep your immigration permission registered (with no gaps) during your residence. Gaps in your registration may lead to your application for citizenship being deemed ineligible.\n\nC. You were declared a refugee under the International Protection Act 2015\n\nYou must be 18 years of age or over\n\nYou must have a declaration as a refugee from the Minister for Justice in Ireland\n\nYou must be able to prove your identity. Special provisions for this are laid out in the Citizenship Guidance Document.\n\nYou must have proof of residency in Ireland for the past three years.\n\nD. You are applying on behalf of a minor (child)\n\nA minor cannot make their own application for citizenship. This can only be done by their parent, legal guardian or a person legally acting on the child’s behalf ‘in loco parentis’.\n\nThere are three ways to apply on behalf of a minor:\n\nIf you are an Irish citizen by naturalisation, you may submit an application for citizenship on behalf of your child. The child must:\n\nBe under 18 years of age\n\nMeet the relevant conditions for residence\n\nHave a naturalised parent.\n\nThere are specific documents that you must provide when applying for a child. Click here for more information on these documents.\n\nThe Minister for Justice has the discretion to grant citizenship to a child of Irish descent or association. Irish descent or association means that the child is related by blood or adoption to an Irish citizen. It can also mean that the child is related to someone who is entitled to be an Irish citizen.\n\nSection 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 (as amended) allows the Minister to waive or ignore certain requirements. However, this does not guarantee citizenship based on Irish descent or association.\n\nEach application will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. This will be done in accordance with Irish law in place at the time.\n\nThere are specific documents that you must provide when applying for a child. Click here for more information on these documents.\n\nFor more, see information on citizenship by Irish descent or association.\n\nThe people of Ireland voted to change the constitutional right to citizenship in the 27th Amendment to the Irish Constitution. This ended the automatic entitlement to citizenship by birth to everyone born in Ireland.\n\nIf the child was born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005, their entitlement to Irish citizenship depends on:\n\nYour residency history in Ireland as parent or guardian\n\nYour child’s residency history in Ireland. Your child must have lived continuously in Ireland for one year right before applying, and in the 8 years before that, they must have lived in Ireland for a total of two years.\n\nThere are specific documents that you must provide when applying for a child.
