        "text": "Republic Act 9225 otherwise known as the Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003 (more popularly known as the Dual Citizenship Law) enables former natural-born Filipinos who have become naturalized citizens of another country to retain/reacquire their Philippine citizenship by taking an oath of allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines before a Philippine Consular Officer. Upon retaining/reacquiring their Philippine citizenship, they shall enjoy full civil, economic and political rights as Filipinos.\n\nNatural-born Filipino citizens are citizens of the Philippines from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect their Philippine citizenship.\n\nIf they are born on and after 17 January 1973, their father or mother should be a Filipino citizen at the time of their birth.\n\nIf born before 17 January 1973, their father should be a Filipino citizen. If the father is not a Filipino citizen, the mother should be a Filipino citizen and the applicant should have elected Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority (18 years old).\n\nNOTE: The Consular Officer reserves the right to require additional documents from an applicant, to prove his/ her identity and/or citizenship, and ensure accurate and complete personal data entries, pursuant to the Philippine Passport Law (R.A. 8239) and the Foreign Service Act (R.A. 7157).\n\nNOTE: Under the principle of derivative citizenship, unmarried children below eighteen (18) years of age, whether legitimate, illegitimate, or adopted, of former Filipino parents who retained/reacquired their Philippine citizenship under this law, may also be deemed Filipino citizens, if they are included in the parentâ€™s application for retention/reacquisition of Philippine citizenship and the requisite fees paid.\n\nPlease note that a person who is born outside the Philippines on or after 17 January 1973 when either parent was still a Filipino citizen is considered a dual Filipino citizen from birth. There is no need to include the child as a derivative citizenship application. Such children should only have their births reported to the Philippine Embassy/Consulate with jurisdiction over the place of birth to be recognized as Filipino citizens. See Report of Birth for details."
