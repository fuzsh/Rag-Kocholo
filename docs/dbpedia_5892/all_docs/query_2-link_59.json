        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nThis is not a legal document. The explanations and definitions are not legal definitions. In case of a discrepancy between the language in this document and the relevant legislation or regulations, the legal text in the legislation and regulations prevails.\n\nFor legal information, see the:\n\nCitizenship Act\n\nCitizenship Regulations and Citizenship Regulations No. 2\n\nThis information will help you complete the forms and guide you through the application process.\n\nOverview\n\nThis application is for an adult Canadian citizen who wishes to renounce their Canadian citizenship. To renounce your Canadian citizenship you must prove you are a Canadian citizen. You must also prove that you are, or will become a citizen of a country other than Canada, if this application to renounce is approved.\n\nNote: If you acquired or reacquired Canadian citizenship as a result of changes to the Citizenship Act that took effect on April 17, 2009, you may be eligible to apply to renounce your citizenship under section 7.1 of the Citizenship Regulations. See the guide Application to Renounce Canadian Citizenship for certain persons who acquired citizenship on April 17, 2009 (R7.1).\n\nWhy you need to read this guide?\n\nThis guide provides all of the instructions necessary to complete this application. As a result of reading the guide, you should be able to:\n\ncomplete the application form, and\n\ndetermine what supporting documents need to be included.\n\nWhat happens if I renounce my Canadian Citizenship?\n\nIf you renounce your Canadian citizenship, you lose all the rights and privileges of being a Canadian citizen and will have no status in Canada. This means that if you wish to return to Canada permanently, you will have to apply for a permanent resident visa. If you wish to return to Canada temporarily (to visit, work or study), you will have to apply for a temporary resident visa, if applicable.\n\nBefore you apply\n\nRead the instructions carefully. They contain important information. Be sure you are eligible to apply before you submit your application. There is no refund of the processing fee.\n\nWhat are the requirements?\n\nTo be eligible to renounce your Canadian citizenship, you must:\n\nbe a Canadian citizen;\n\nprove that you are or that you will become a citizen of a country other than Canada if your application to renounce is approved;\n\nnot live in Canada;\n\nbe at least 18 years old;\n\nnot be a threat to Canada’s security or part of a pattern of criminal activity; and\n\nunderstand the significance of renouncing your Canadian citizenship.\n\nNote: The Minister has the discretion to waive some of the requirements aforementioned for compassionate reasons.\n\nWho cannot apply to renounce Canadian citizenship?\n\nYou are not eligible to renounce your Canadian citizenship if Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has begun the process of revoking your citizenship under section 10 or 10.1 of the Act. This measure will stay in effect until IRCC informs you of the decision on the revocation.\n\nWhat you must send with your application\n\nRefer to the Document Checklist (CIT 0402) (PDF, 295.62KB) to assist you in gathering the necessary documentation.\n\nYou need to provide clear and easy-to-read colour copies of your documents, unless otherwise stated.\n\nNote: If any of the required documents are missing, or the photocopies are of poor quality, your application may be returned to you.\n\nName change\n\nConsult the information below to determine the documents that are to be included with your application.\n\nIf you have legally changed your name within Canada\n\nThen you must submit a copy of the change of name document issued by a Canadian province or territory, or by the appropriate foreign-state authority.
