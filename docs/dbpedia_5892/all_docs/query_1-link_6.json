        "text": "You should check if you’re eligible to apply for citizenship - there are different routes to apply.\n\nMost adults who have migrated to the UK get citizenship by applying to ‘naturalise’.\n\nApplying for citizenship takes time and you will not get your money back if your application is refused.\n\nCheck how much it costs to apply\n\nYou usually pay £1,630 to apply for adult citizenship or £1,214 for children. If you’re applying for citizenship as an adult you’ll also have to pay:\n\n£50 to do the Life in the UK Test\n\naround £150 if you have to do an English test\n\nYou will not get most of your money back if your application is refused - for example, if you’re not eligible or you sent the wrong documents.\n\nYou can find out more about the fees for citizenship applications on GOV.UK.\n\nIf you’re applying for a child and you can’t afford the fee\n\nYou can apply for a ‘fee waiver’. If you get a fee waiver, you will not have to pay the fee.\n\nTo apply for a fee waiver, you have to show you don’t have enough income and savings to pay for both the fee and essential costs like food and rent. You’ll need to send documents showing your income and spending for the last 6 months, for example your:\n\npay slips\n\nbank statements for all your accounts\n\ntenancy agreement\n\nutility bills\n\nIf social services give you money to help you look after your child, you’ll automatically get a fee waiver - you’ll need to send documents to prove this.\n\nYou can apply for a fee waiver on GOV.UK.\n\nCheck what you need to apply\n\nBefore you apply for citizenship, it’s worth preparing what you’ll need.\n\nWhen you apply for citizenship through naturalisation, you’ll need to:\n\nprove how long you’ve lived in the UK\n\npass the Life in the UK Test\n\nprove you understand English\n\ncheck you’re of ‘good character’ - this means showing you haven't recently broken the law or gone bankrupt\n\ngive the names of 2 people who can help prove your identity - these are called ‘referees’\n\nIf you're applying for citizenship for your child\n\nYou’ll need to make a separate application for your child.\n\nIf your child is under 18 years old, you can apply to ‘register’ them as a British citizen. Registering is a way of applying for British citizenship.\n\nThe application process is easier for children - they don't have to:\n\npass the Life in the UK Test\n\nprove their knowledge of English\n\ndo the citizenship ceremony\n\nYou can check if your child can get British citizenship and what form you should use.\n\nProve how long you’ve lived in the UK\n\nYou usually need to prove how long you’ve lived in the UK - this is called the ‘residency requirement’.\n\nYou need to prove your residency even if you've done it before - for example, by applying for 'settled status'.\n\nThe length of time you need to prove will depend on your situation.\n\nThese are the steps you should follow:\n\n1. Work out when you were in the UK\n\nYou should work out exactly when you were in the UK during the last:\n\n3 years if you’re married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen\n\n5 years if you’re not married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen\n\nTo help with this, you could make a list of the dates you travelled outside the UK by:\n\nchecking old calendars\n\nchecking travel bookings\n\nlooking for exit and entry dates stamped in your passport\n\nYou also need to make sure you were in the UK on the same day 3 or 5 years ago as the day you’re applying. If you weren’t in the UK exactly 3 or 5 years ago, it’s usually best to wait until it’s been 3 or 5 years since the date you returned to the UK and then apply. If you were out of the UK for a long time, talk to an adviser.\n\n2. Check what absences from the UK are allowed\n\nYou should check how many days you were outside the UK - if it's over the limit you might be refused. You'll need to separately count these for the:\n\n3 or 5 years you’re providing evidence for in your application\n\n12 months before you apply\n\nYou can be out of the UK for up to 90 days in the year before you apply. If you were away for longer, you could delay applying. This would mean your absence is counted in the 3 or 5 years you’re using in your residence requirement.\n\n3. Check you have the evidence to show you were in the UK\n\nYou’ll need to give the Home Office your current passport and old passports that cover the time you’ve been in the country. If you have any entry and exit stamps in your passport, check they match the dates you’ve said you were in and out of the country on your application.\n\nCheck if your passport has an entry stamp for when you first entered the UK. You might not have one if for example you’re an EU citizen.\n\nIf you don’t have a passport with an entry stamp, you’ll need other evidence to show you were in the UK, for example:\n\npayslips and P60s\n\na letter from your employer or education provider with start and end dates\n\na letter from a benefits provider like the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) showing when you got benefits\n\nYou might also be able to use other evidence, like household bills.\n\nIf you don’t have a passport or travel documents because you’re a refugee, the Home Office should accept that you didn’t leave the UK after you arrived.\n\nPass the Life in the UK Test\n\nYou need to pass the Life in the UK Test before you apply for citizenship.\n\nThe test asks questions about UK laws and the legal system, working and other details of life in the UK.\n\nYou can do the test any time before you apply.\n\nCheck if you need to do the test\n\nYou don’t need to pass the Life in the UK Test if:\n\nyou’ve already passed it - for example, if you took the test when you applied for 'indefinite leave to remain'\n\nyou’re under 18 or over 65 years old\n\nIf you’re aged 60 to 64 and can show you’re unlikely to pass the test before you turn 65, the Home Office might agree you don’t have to do the test. For example, if you're receiving medical treatment for a serious illness.\n\nIf you have a physical or mental condition that stops you passing the test, you might not have to do it. You'll need to ask your doctor to confirm that your condition:\n\nis unlikely to change\n\nmakes it impossible for you to pass the test - for example, a learning disability or brain injury that stops you remembering facts\n\nYou can get a form for your doctor to fill in on GOV.UK.\n\nDoing the test\n\nYou can do the test as many times as you need to - but you have to pay a fee each time.\n\nYou need to study the official handbook to pass the test. You can also buy an app to practise - search for the official Life in the UK Test app by TSO (The Stationery Office).\n\nSome colleges offer short courses to help prepare for the test. You'll have to pay a fee to attend.\n\nYou can book the Life in the UK Test and buy the official handbook on GOV.UK.\n\nProve you understand English\n\nYou need to prove you understand English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic before you can apply for citizenship.\n\nCheck if you need to prove you understand English\n\nYou don’t need to prove you understand English if:\n\nyou’re from a country that’s exempt - check which nationalities don't have to prove they understand English on GOV.UK\n\nyou have a degree that was taught or researched in English - check how to show your degree was in English on GOV.UK\n\nyou’re under 18 or over 65 years old\n\nIf you’re aged 60 to 64 and can show you’re unlikely to learn English before you turn 65, the Home Office might agree you don’t have to prove your knowledge of English. For example, if you're receiving medical treatment for a serious illness.\n\nIf you have a physical or mental condition that stops you passing the test, you might not have to do it. You'll need to ask your doctor to confirm that your condition:\n\nis unlikely to change\n\nmakes it impossible for you to learn English - for example, a learning disability or brain injury that stops you learning the language\n\nYou can get a form for your doctor to fill in on GOV.UK.\n\nProving you understand English\n\nYou'll need to pass a speaking and listening test at an approved centre - you can find a secure English language test provider on GOV.UK.\n\nThe test costs around £150. Tests are usually valid for 2 years - if you’ve already done a test, you can check your English language test is still valid on GOV.UK.\n\nCheck you’re of good character\n\nYou usually need to prove you’re of good character before you can apply for citizenship.\n\nThe Home Office look at a range of things to decide this.\n\nFor example, the Home Office might decide you’re not eligible if you have:\n\nunpaid taxes in the UK\n\nan NHS debt\n\nbeen declared bankrupt\n\na criminal record\n\nbroken a condition of your leave in the last 10 years - for example working or claiming public funds without permission\n\nIf you have any points on your driving licence, you must print a summary of your record from the DVLA website and include it with your application.\n\nYou should say if you've received any fixed penalty notices in your application. Your good character won't be affected, as long as you've paid them.\n\nIt’s important to be honest and include anything that’s relevant to your application - for example, a criminal conviction. If the Home Office finds you've left something out, they might refuse to accept your application.\n\nIf you think you’ll have problems with proving you are of good character, you should talk to an adviser before you apply.\n\nProvide 2 referees\n\nYou’ll need to give the names of 2 referees on your application. These are people who know you and can help prove your identity.\n\nBoth of your referees should have known you personally for more than 3 years. They must not be:\n\nyour relative\n\nyour solicitor or agent\n\nemployed by the Home Office\n\nThey can't be a referee if they've had a criminal conviction in the last 10 years, unless a certain period of time has passed. This is called the ‘rehabilitation period’. For example, the rehabilitation period for a fine is 1 year. You can find the rehabilitation periods on GOV.UK.\n\nYour referees should include:\n\na person who has 'professional standing' - for example, a civil servant of any nationality\n\na person who is a British passport holder and either has professional standing or is over the age of 25\n\nThe Home Office has a list of people they accept as referees - they’re called ‘acceptable professional persons’.\n\nBefore you apply, check the list and the rest of the rules for referees in the nationality guidance on GOV.UK. The list of who can be a referee is under 'Commonly used terms'.\n\nCheck your application carefully\n\nIt’s important to check you have the right information and documents before you apply. If something is missing or wrong, the Home Office can refuse to accept your application and you will not get your money back.\n\nIf the Home Office decide you lied on your application, they might stop you applying again for 10 years.\n\nIf you need help preparing your application\n\nYou should talk to an adviser if you need help with completing your application or providing evidence.\n\nHow to apply\n\nYou can usually apply for citizenship online or by post.\n\nIf you’re from the Channel Islands, Isle of Man or a British Overseas territory, you must apply by post.\n\nIt's a good idea to send your paper application by recorded delivery, so you can make sure it's delivered.\n\nFind out more about applying if you’re married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen on GOV.UK.\n\nIf you're not married or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, the way you apply will depend on your current immigration status. You can find out how to:\n\napply if you have indefinite leave to remain or settled status on GOV.UK\n\napply if you have permanent residence status on GOV.UK\n\nSubmit your documents\n\nIf you’ve applied on a paper form, you’ll need to submit your documents - for example, send your passport with your application.\n\nIf you’ve applied online, you can scan your documents and upload them to your online application - you don’t have to physically send them to the Home Office.\n\nIt’s a good idea to download or print a copy of your finished application for your records.\n\nBook your biometric appointment\n\nYou’ll usually get an email asking you to book an appointment to have your photograph and fingerprints taken. These are called your ‘biometric information’.\n\nYou’ll need to book an appointment on the UK Visa and Citizenship Application Service website.\n\nYou can check what to bring and if anyone needs to go with you on GOV.UK.\n\nAfter you’ve applied\n\nYou need to tell the Home Office if you change your personal details during this time. For example, if you change your address.\n\nThe amount of time you wait for the Home Office’s decision will not affect your existing rights in the UK - for example, you can continue to work or claim benefits.\n\nThe Home Office will write to you if they need more details about your application. You should reply within 2 weeks if you can. If the Home Office doesn't hear from you by then, they might make a decision on your application based on the information they already have.\n\nUK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) will try to make a decision about your application within 6 months, but it might take longer. If you’re worried about a delay, you can:\n\ncontact UKVI to check if there’s a problem with your application - check how to contact UKVI on GOV.UK\n\nmake a complaint about the delay - check how to complain to UKVI on GOV.UK\n\nTravelling outside the UK before you get British citizenship\n\nYou can travel outside the UK if you’ve applied for British citizenship. You should make sure you can get emails and letters about your application while you’re away.\n\nOrganise a citizenship ceremony\n\nIf your application is successful, you must arrange a citizenship ceremony. These are usually held at your local council. Find out more about booking your citizenship ceremony on GOV.UK.\n\nReplace or correct a UK citizenship certificate\n\nYou’ll have to pay a fee to replace or correct a UK citizenship certificate. Find out more about replacing or correcting your citizenship certificate on GOV.UK.\n\nTravelling outside the UK after you get British citizenship\n\nIf you want to travel outside the UK after getting British citizenship, you’ll need to apply for a British passport.\n\nMake sure the details on your current passport are the same as your citizenship certificate. For example, check your name is spelled the same. If any of the details are different, you will not get a British passport.\n\nYou can find out more about how to apply for a British passport on GOV.UK.\n\nRegister to vote\n\nBecoming a British citizen means you can vote in all elections or referendums. You can register to vote on GOV.UK.\n\nIf your application is unsuccessful\n\nIf your application is unsuccessful, the Home Office will write to you and tell you why.\n\nIt will not affect your current right to stay in the UK."
