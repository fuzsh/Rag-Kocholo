        "text": "United States citizens living in the UK can acquire British citizenship either by birth or by registration. As a matter of registration, applicants may apply for naturalization if they are aged 18 or over. To be eligible to become a British national, applicants need to prove that they have been in the UK on Indefinite Leave to Remain or EU Settled Status for at least 5 years, and that they have never broken UK law, including immigration breaches.\n\nOnce their British citizenship request is approved, they can live, work and study in the UK permanently, without any immigration restrictions. Applicants will also be able to travel and spend time in the United States or anywhere else without the need to worry about losing their British citizenship status.\n\nRequirements\n\nBased on the British Nationality Act, those who wish to become British citizens must meet the following eligibility requirements:\n\nBe over the age of 18.\n\nHave held Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK for at least 12 months.\n\nMeet the B1 CEFR level English language requirements (unless exempt).\n\nPass the Life in the UK Test, to show that you are aware of the basics of the British customs, traditions and culture.\n\nNot have been in breach of any UK immigration rules.\n\nDemonstrate that they meet the Good Character requirement.\n\nHave spent at least 5 years of continuous residence in the UK, with no longer than 450 days outside the UK.\n\nIn proving your stay in the UK, you need to show that you were:\n\nLiving in the UK for the 5 years before you apply\n\nOutside the UK for no more than 270 days in those 5 years\n\nOutside the UK for no more than 90 days in the past 12 months\n\nYou also need to make sure you were in the UK on the same day 5 years ago as the day you’re applying.\n\nIf you weren’t in the UK exactly 5 years ago, it’s usually best to wait until it’s been 5 years since the date you returned to the UK and then apply.\n\nIntroduction\n\nYou need to provide the following documents when you apply for your UK citizenship:\n\nCurrent passport\n\nYou have to submit your current passport, and any other previous visas you may have held, either for the UK or other countries. Please note that you cannot submit a copy of your passport; it must be the original document\n\nBRP card\n\nBRP stands for Biometric Residence Permits, and this is a document that the Home Office issues if you stay in the UK for longer than 6 months. The BRP contains all your details, your immigration status, fingerprints and picture. You must have a valid BRP when you want to apply for British citizenship.\n\nNational insurance number\n\nIf your NI is not stamped in your BRP, you must apply for a national insurance number- you must be in the UK to apply for a NI.\n\nEvidence of the English language\n\nYou have to provide evidence that you have either completed a valid degree taught in English (or in the UK) or that you have completed one of the approved tests with an approved test provider in the UK:\n\nIELTS SELT Consortium\n\nLanguageCert\n\nPearson\n\nTrinity College London (PSI Services- UK, Ltd- if you are out of the UK)\n\nProof of citizenship test\n\nYou need to provide your test certificate, stamped and signed by the test supervisor if you passed the test before October 1st of 2019. If you passed the test after this date, provide your test reference number.\n\nTax records\n\nYou need to provide your tax reference number, which is usually found in your payslip.\n\nYour previous employment and living history\n\nYou need to provide details of your previous employment and living situation. This includes your previous, and current address. If you spent time out of the country, please provide the dates, the length of time, and the reason for your visit.\n\nEvidence of freedom from immigration time restrictions\n\nYou must provide evidence that you have freedom from immigration time restrictions at the time of application. This is particularly important if you are applying to join your partner. Usually, this information is found on your BRP, but you may also submit a letter from the Home Office saying that you are free from the immigration conditions.\n\nTwo referees\n\nYou have to provide the names, and personal details, of two referees who can prove your identity. Your referees must not be relatives, migration agents, or employees of the Home Office. Choose your referees carefully, as they cannot be a referee if they had a criminal conviction in the last 10 years. You can find more details about the eligibility criteria of your referees\n\nNaturalization is the legal process by which US citizens may become British citizens. Normally, the applicants are not British by birth. Those who become British citizens by the legal process of naturalization will be eligible to obtain a British passport. They will become entitled to the same rights and privileges as though they were British citizens by birth. They are able to work, live, and also claim public funds in the United Kingdom. They may also freely move in and out of the United Kingdom without being under immigration control.\n\nApplicants might be able to apply for British citizenship by ‘naturalization’ if they are:\n\nOver 18 years old and either:\n\nMoved to the UK\n\nNaturalization is the most common way to get citizenship if you were born outside the UK and don’t have a British parent.\n\nIndefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) is also known as “permanent residence” or Settlement. With ILR, you can live and work freely in the UK with no “expiry” date of the ILR status. However, British citizenship still has several advantages over ILR.\n\nSome of the key advantages include the following:\n\nThe Right to Vote in UK General Elections and Stand for Public Office: British citizens have the right to vote in all UK elections and stand for public office, whereas non-British citizens with ILR status do not necessarily have these rights.\n\nEligibility for a British Passport: Those holding UK ILR status are not eligible to apply for a British Passport. British passports allow visa-free travel to a large number of countries and so a British passport may be more beneficial, depending on the holder’s current nationality.\n\nSecure Immigration Status: British citizenship provides a more secure immigration status than ILR, as it cannot normally be taken away (in extreme cases the government may try to revoke Citizenship after it has been granted). ILR status, on the other hand, can be lost if the individual stays outside the UK for 2 or more years at a time.\n\nPotential Eligibility for Dual Citizenship: British citizenship allows an individual to hold dual or multiple citizenships, which can provide additional opportunities and benefits."
