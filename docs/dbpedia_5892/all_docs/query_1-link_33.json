        "text": "To become an Irish citizen through naturalisation, you must meet the conditions that are set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended (pdf). These are:\n\nAge\n\nYou must be 18 years or older.\n\nYou can apply on behalf of a child if:\n\nThe child was born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 and did not qualify for citizenship by birth, but has 3 years reckonable residence\n\nThe child has at least one parent who is already an Irish citizen by naturalisation\n\nThe child is of Irish descent or Irish associations\n\nA child is someone aged under 18 who is not married at the time of application. A child cannot make the application by themselves. The application must be made by their parent, legal guardian or a person acting on the child’s behalf ‘in loco parentis’.\n\nCharacter\n\nYou must be ‘of good character’. There is no exhaustive legal definition of what ‘good character’ means.\n\nThe Garda Síochána (Ireland's national police) provides a report about your background. As part of this, the Minister receives information about the following:\n\nYour criminal record\n\nDriving offences you may have committed\n\nOngoing investigations against you\n\nPending criminal cases (that haven’t been heard in court yet)\n\nCautions or other warnings you have received from the Gardaí\n\nCertain civil cases (for example, if you were subject to a barring order)\n\nYou are asked on the application form to declare any of the above and you are given the opportunity to explain the circumstances that led to the Garda or court action. Before a decision is made on your citizenship application, you will get an invitation to complete an e-vetting application so that the information on your character is as up to date as possible.\n\nIf you are applying for your child who is age 14 or over, they must demonstrate ‘good character’. The ‘good character’ test also applies if your child is under 14 and has been charged with, or convicted of, a serious violent or sexual crime.\n\nResidence in the State\n\nYou must have lived in the State for a certain length of time. The specific requirements are that you:\n\nHave a period of 1 year continuous reckonable residence in the State immediately before the date of your application for naturalisation and\n\nDuring the 8 years before that, have had a total reckonable residence in the State of 4 years\n\nYou can spend 70 days outside of Ireland in the year immediately before your application. The day you leave Ireland, and the day you arrived back in Ireland, are not counted as absences.\n\nAn additional period of up to 30 days may be allowed if you left Ireland due to exceptional circumstances, for example, health reasons, family circumstances, employment or study. You should explain this in your application.\n\nAltogether you must have 5 years reckonable residence out of the last 9 years.\n\nThe residency rules for children are different. You can find out more about the residency rules when applying for Irish citizenship for a child.\n\nSome other categories of applicant can apply after 3 years residence (see ‘The Minister’s power to waive conditions’ below).\n\nCalculating reckonable residence\n\nReckonable residence means residence in Ireland that counts towards becoming eligible to apply for naturalisation. If your application is based on your marriage or civil partnership with an Irish citizen, you can count legal residence in Northern Ireland too.\n\nIf you are from outside the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, certain periods of residence are counted towards the reckonable residence you need to qualify for naturalisation. Some examples of periods that are counted for reckonable residence include:\n\nTime spent in Ireland on an employment permit (usually with a Stamp 1 Irish Residence Permit)\n\nTime spent on a Stamp 4\n\nTime spent as the dependent of an employment permit or other legal resident (usually with Stamp 3)\n\nTime spent as the spouse or partner of a Critical Skills Employment Permit holder, General Employment Permit holder, Inter-Country Transfer employment permit holder or on the Third Level Graduate Scheme (with Stamp 1G)\n\nTime spent on a Stamp 5 (Without Condition as to Time)\n\nPeriods of residence that are not reckonable include:\n\nTime spent on a student visa (usually with a Stamp 2 or Stamp 2A IRP) unless you are making an application as a ‘young adult’ (see below)\n\nTime spent in Ireland while you were undocumented\n\nTime spent while you were an international protection applicant\n\nYou can use the online residency calculator on the Immigration Service Delivery website to check if you meet the naturalisation residency conditions. You must send a printout from the calculator with your application (along with other proofs of residence) unless you are a UK, Swiss or EEA citizen, or have refugee status in Ireland.\n\nRegistration with immigration is usually the evidence of legal residence which meets the residency requirements for naturalisation. You can count the time when your immigration permission was automatically extended during COVID-19 as reckonable if you had reckonable residence immediately before the first extension. For example, if you had a Stamp 4 in March 2020, your Stamp 4 permission was automatically extended until 31 May 2022. This period counts as reckonable residence. You must also prove that you were actually resident in Ireland during this time (see ‘scorecard system’ in the section ‘Documentation’ below).\n\nYoung adults\n\nYou can use your parent’s reckonable residence if you are a young adult and do not have the required reckonable residence yourself.\n\nYou are a young adult if:\n\nYou are aged between 18 and 23 when you make your application\n\nYou entered Ireland legally with your family\n\nYou are in school or you went straight from school to third level college in Ireland\n\nYou are dependent on your parents\n\nEEA, UK and Swiss nationals\n\nIf you are a citizen of an EEA country, Switzerland or the UK, you do not have to enclose a ‘reckonable residence’ calculation with your application. You have to show your residence by using documentary evidence of your history in Ireland. The online application form provides more information.\n\nThe EEA includes the EU and Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.\n\nIf you are a citizen of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, you do not have to register for an Irish Residence Permit. All periods of residence in Ireland are counted towards naturalisation.\n\nThe Minister's power to waive conditions\n\nThe Minister for Justice has the power to waive one or more of the conditions for naturalisation in the following circumstances:\n\nIf you are of Irish descent or of Irish associations\n\nIf you are a parent or guardian applying on behalf of a minor child of Irish descent or Irish associations\n\nIf you are a naturalised parent applying on behalf of a minor child\n\nIf you are the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen or a naturalised person\n\nIf you have been resident abroad in the public service\n\nIf you are recognised as a refugee (under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees) or a stateless person (under the 1954 UN Convention regarding Stateless Persons).\n\nFor spouses and civil partners of Irish citizens, you can apply for naturalisation after 3 years of marriage or civil partnership and 3 years of reckonable residence on the island of Ireland.\n\nA person granted refugee status can apply for citizenship through naturalisation once they have 3 years of residency. Residency is calculated from the date of arrival in the State. Note: This does not apply to people who have subsidiary protection status.\n\nFuture intentions\n\nYou must intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation. If your application is successful and you move away from Ireland you should complete Form 5 (pdf), which states your intention to keep your Irish citizenship while you are temporarily living abroad.\n\nIf your application is approved, you must make a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. You must also swear that you will observe the laws of Ireland and respect its democratic values. These declarations are usually made at a citizenship ceremony.\n\nThe supporting documents you need depend on your situation. If your documents are in a language other than English, you must get them translated by a professional translating service. The Irish Translators’ and Interpreters’ Association has a list of professional translators.\n\nIn all cases, you will need to provide evidence of your identity and nationality.\n\nFrom 20 April 2023, new applicants are only required to provide a certified colour photocopy of the biometric page of their current passport. Your photocopy must be certified by a solicitor, commissioner for oaths, peace commissioner or a notary public. The ISD can still ask you to submit your full passport – it is expected that 10% of applicants will be asked to submit their full passport.\n\nScorecard system\n\nISD now uses a ‘scorecard’ system for assessing identification and residence history. This means that you can use a wider variety of documents, and be sure that you have enough evidence to send with your application.\n\nYou must have 150 points in both identification and residency. The Citizenship Guidance Document explains how many points you get for different types of documents.\n\nIf your application for naturalisation is based on your marriage or civil partnership with an Irish citizen, you will have to send documents that show your spouse’s nationality and also evidence that you have been married for 3 years.\n\nSome of the documents you need to send must be certified as ‘true copies’ by a solicitor, notary, commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner. You can ask a solicitor to certify your documents when you are making your statutory declaration (see Step 4 below). These include:\n\nYour birth certificate\n\nYour spouse’s birth certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour passport\n\nYou can find a full list of the documents you need to send when you apply.\n\nProblems with documents\n\nIf you are unable to include documents that are listed and you have tried to get copies of the documents but are unable to, you should explain the reason why you cannot include the documents.\n\nIf you are unable to send your birth certificate or marriage certificate, you must use the affidavits below. An affidavit is only accepted if you can show that you are unable to get your certificate.\n\nBirth affidavit form\n\nMarriage affidavit form"
