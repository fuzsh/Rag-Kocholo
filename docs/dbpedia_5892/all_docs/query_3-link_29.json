        "text": "Veteran actor Sir Antony Sher has died of cancer aged 72, the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) has announced.\n\nHe was widely regarded as one of the country's finest contemporary classical actors, with a long association with the company.\n\nIts artistic director and Sir Antony's husband, Gregory Doran, had taken compassionate leave to care for him.\n\nThe company said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the news.\n\nRSC chair Shriti Vadera said the actor was \"beloved\" in the organisation \"and touched and enriched the lives of so many people\".\n\n\"Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with Greg, and with Antony's family and their friends at this devastating time,\" added Catherine Mallyon, RSC executive director and Erica Whyman, acting artistic director.\n\nSir Antony's film appearances included Shakespeare in Love and Mrs Brown, while his RSC credits included Richard III and Macbeth. He also appeared in TV series including The History Man and the BBC's Murphy's Law.\n\nOnce described by the Prince of Wales as his favourite actor, Sir Antony played many of the great Shakespearean roles, from King Lear to Shylock.\n\nBut it was his portrayal of Richard III as a villainous hunchback on crutches which won him an Olivier Award in 1985.\n\nPrince Charles, who is president of the Royal Shakespeare Company, said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the death of Sir Antony, who he described as \"a great man and an irreplaceable talent\".\n\n\"I had the great joy and privilege of knowing him for many years, and admired him enormously for the consummate skill and passion he brought to every role,\" Prince Charles said.\n\n\"My most treasured memory of him was as Falstaff in a brilliant production of Greg Doran's.\n\n\"I feel particularly blessed to have known him, but we have all lost a giant of the stage at the height of his genius.\"\n\nActor John Simm paid tribute on Instagram, sharing a memorable image of the Sir Antony as Richard III, while describing him as \"one of the greatest stage actors I've ever seen.\"\n\nSimm described Sir Antony as \"a huge inspiration, a huge talent\".\n\nScreenwriter and producer Russell T Davies, who created It's A Sin, commented: \"He's a wonderful man,\" while the National Theatre added, external: \"With the tragic passing of Antony Sher, one of the great theatre titans has left us.\"\n\nWriting on Twitter, choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne said:, external \"Terribly sadâ¦ My thoughts are with Greg and everyone who loved Sir Antony - a truly great loss.\"\n\nActor Samuel West said in a Twitter thread tribute, external that so many of his performances \"stay with me after decades - Macbeth, Stanley, Arturo Ui, Torch Song Trilogy, Cyrano - and today people are remembering dozens of others, in every genre and style. The mark of a true artist\".\n\nSinger Gary Kemp, of Spandau Ballet, said, external some of his \"most powerful theatre-viewing experiences\" had occurred while watching Sir Antony.\n\nSouth African-raised Sir Antony joined the RSC in 1982.\n\nIn his early teens he had elocution classes, which helped him to overcome the shyness he had felt as a boy.\n\nBut he almost gave up on his acting career after an early rejection from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London.\n\n\"That was my beginning in this country and I took the rejections very seriously,\" he told The Telegraph in 2018, external,\n\n\"I assumed the examiners knew best, but my mother, who was a very ambitious Jewish woman, was absolutely determined that they were wrong and kept me going. I honestly think I would have given up if it weren't for her.\"\n\nSir Antony was knighted in 2000, and in 2005, with Mr Doran, who he met at the RSC, became one of the first gay couples to enter into a civil partnership in the UK.\n\nThe RSC said Doran will remain on compassionate leave and is expected to return to work in 2022.\n\nFellow actor and playwright John Kani said in a tribute: \"Both Tony Sher and I were born when our country, South Africa, was the worst place a child could be born let alone to be raised by parents who worked very hard to prepare their children for a difficult future - Apartheid South Africa. By the grace of his God and my ancestors, like Romeo and Juliet we found each other in 1973.\n\n\"We travelled together as compatriots, comrades in the struggle for a better South Africa, as fellow artists... I am at peace with you my friend and myself. Exit my King. Your Brother.\""
