        "text": "Sir Antony Sher, leading light of theatre and one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of his generation, has died of cancer aged 72.\n\nBorn into a Lithuanian-Jewish family in South Africa, he moved to Britain in the late 60s and soon established himself on both stage and screen.\n\nHe attracted particular attention for his starring role in the 1981 BBC adaptation of Malcolm Bradbury’s ‘The History Man’.\n\nBut it was as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) that Sir Antony won his greatest critical plaudits, beginning with his remarkable Richard III in 1985, winning an Olivier Award for his unforgettable portrayal of the villainous king.\n\nHis many other leading Shakespearean roles included King Lear and Shylock in ‘The Merchant Of Venice’.\n\nSir Antony was described by Prince Charles as his “favourite actor”, and he was knighted for services to theatre in 2000.\n\nHis brilliant career had almost been stopped at the outset when he was rejected as a prospective student by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).\n\nHe recalled speaking to the Daily Telegraph in 2018: \"I assumed the examiners knew best, but my mother, who was a very ambitious Jewish woman, was absolutely determined that they were wrong and kept me going. I honestly think I would have given up if it weren't for her.\"\n\nHe leaves behind his husband, RSC artistic director Gregory Doran, who has been on compassionate leave to care for Sir Antony.\n\nActing artistic director Catherine Mallyon said: \"Our thoughts and sincere condolences are with Greg, and with Antony's family and their friends at this devastating time.”\n\nThe Holocaust Education Trust tweeted: \"Sir Antony Sher was one of the greats. Not only in the world of theatre but as a human being. We were so incredibly lucky to have his longstanding support and advice and even luckier to work with him on his masterpiece, Primo - his adaptation of Primo Levi’s ‘If This Is a Man’.\"\n\nThe National Theatre said: \"With the tragic passing of Antony Sher, one of the great theatre titans has left us.\"\n\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust said: \"We’re saddened by the passing of our longtime patron Sir Antony Sher. Sir Antony was deeply passionate about supporting people living with HIV and we’re grateful for his decades of involvement. Our thoughts are with his family and partner Greg.\""
