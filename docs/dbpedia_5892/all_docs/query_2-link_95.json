IHP assistance is not a substitute for insurance and cannot compensate for all losses caused by a disaster. The assistance is intended to meet your basic needs and supplement disaster recovery efforts.\n\nGraphic\n\nFEMA is committed to providing equal access to disaster recovery resources and assistance. Let FEMA know if you or anyone in your household has a disability or language need.\n\nIHP Assistance may include:\n\nFunds for temporary housing while you are unable to live in your home, such as rental assistance or reimbursement for hotel costs\n\nFunds to support the repair or replacement of owner-occupied homes that serve as the household’s primary residence, including privately-owned access routes, such as driveways, roads, or bridges\n\nA temporary housing unit, if approved for the disaster, when you are not able to use rental assistance due to a lack of available housing resources\n\nFunds for hazard mitigation assistance to help eligible homeowners repair or rebuild stronger, more durable homes\n\nFunds for other uninsured or under-insured disaster-caused expenses and serious needs\n\nThe Privacy Act requires FEMA to obtain written consent from the applicant in order to share their disaster assistance records with a third party. Applicants who wish to authorize FEMA to share their information with a third party must complete the FEMA FORM FF-104-FY-21-118: Authorization for the Release of Information Under the Privacy Act and return it to FEMA.\n\nGraphic\n\nRoad to Recovery\n\nWhile not all disaster survivors' path to recovery is the same, this interactive tool steps you through the typical processes and requirements to follow that can help get you the support you need after experiencing a disaster.\n\nGet Started on the Road to Recovery\n\nLearn About FEMA IHP Assistance\n\nHow to apply for assistance online, by phone or in person.\n\nUnderstand general eligibility criteria that need to be met to receive assistance.\n\nLearn about citizenship and immigration status requirements for federal public benefits.\n\nWhat to expect for a home inspection.\n\nLearn about proof of ownership and occupancy requirements.\n\nHow to appeal if you disagree with FEMA’s decision.\n\nApplicants in need of Continued Temporary Housing Assistance may request additional assistance by completing FEMA Form FF-104-FY-21-115: Application for Continued Temporary Housing Assistance and return it to FEMA along with supporting documentation.\n\nOther Assistance Programs\n\nGraphic\n\nIn addition to IHP assistance, FEMA has other Individual Assistance programs designed to support disaster survivors, such as Disaster Unemployment Assistance, Crisis Counseling, Disaster Legal Services and more."
