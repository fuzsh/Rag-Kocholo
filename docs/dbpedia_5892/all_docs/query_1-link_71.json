        "text": "What can the payment plan be used for?\n\nThe payment plan is exclusively for the citizenship application of eligible children (under 18) and will be paid directly to the Home Office as part of the standard application submission process\n\nHow much time will the process take?\n\nCompleting our online application takes 20 minutes and you can ask for support throughout the process. Once you submit, you will receive an automated email confirming that we have received your application. You will hear whether you have been verified within 3 working days. We may need to check some details with you before verification. If your application is successful the payment can be made quickly and directly as part of the child’s online citizenship application process with the Home Office. From that point onwards the timeline (and decision) for being granted citizenship will be in the hands of the Home Office.\n\nHow are decisions made?\n\nThe CPP is committed to a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory decision-making process. We will assess every payment plan application on the merits of the application. Sometimes applications for a payment plan will not be successful. In these cases, the applicant will be informed of the decision and the reasons behind it. It is important that we only provide payment plans to those that will be able to make repayments in full in order for us to recycle the plan and offer it to another family.\n\nHow are you able to offer interest-free loans?\n\nThe Citizenship Payment Plan is a social investment scheme meaning we use repayable finance to achieve social impact. We are able to provide interest-free payment plans thanks to the grant funding we receive from some of our partners. By keeping the costs of running CPP low using an online lending platform, we hope to achieve significant social impact that fulfills our funder’s strategic objectives.\n\nWhat happens if I miss a payment?\n\nThe payment plan is designed to be as low cost as possible with no fees or interest attached. We are only able to offer this on the basis that you ensure your monthly payment is available in your account to be collected by EdAid. Not doing so may have an impact on your child’s Home Office application.\n\n100% of payment plans are recycled to be paid forward enabling more children to secure their citizenship."
