        "text": "01 of 28\n\nGail Simmons\n\nOn May 19, 2022, Simmons celebrated her 46th birthday by officially becoming a U.S. citizen. The Canadian-born cookbook author, who moved from Canada to New York over two decades ago, posted the big milestone on her Instagram feed.\n\n\"Yesterday was BIG. Sure, I turned a year older (who's counting at this point?) but perhaps more importantly, after 23 years - almost to the day - as a New Yorker, I was sworn in as a US Citizen,\" she captioned the post.\n\nIn the selfie, Simmons is holding a mini American flag standing in front of the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building in New York City.\n\n\"Next stop, registering to #vote! Ready to finally participate fully,\" she added.\n\n02 of 28\n\nHelen Mirren\n\nThe British Oscar winner became a citizen of the United States in 2017, and opened up to PEOPLE about how witnessing the terrorist attacks of 9/11 while living in New York City inspired her to seek citizenship.\n\n\"I saw the second tower come down,\" Mirren said. \"I had an epiphany. I realized where my allegiance and my heart and my intellect lay in that confrontation between extremism, religiosity — all those things and everything that America represents.\"\n\n\"And I thought, 'I'm an American,' \" the actress, who is married to American director Taylor Hackford, continued. \"I got an American flag, and I put it outside my window.\"\n\n03 of 28\n\nEnes Kanter Freedom\n\nThe Boston Celtics player formerly known as Enes Kanter became a U.S. citizen in late November 2021 and changed his last name for the occasion.\n\nThe center, who was born in Switzerland and raised in Turkey, changed his name to \"Enes Kanter Freedom\" when he earned his U.S. citizenship.\n\n\"It's Official 🇺🇸 Mr. Freedom,\" Kanter Freedom wrote in an Instagram post on Tuesday with a picture showing him in a shirt that read, \"U.S. CITIZEN, EST. 2021.\"\n\nThe athlete has frequently used his platform in the NBA to scrutinize China and Turkey for human rights violations. Earlier in November, he shared pictures to social media of custom shoes that criticized surveillance and labor practices in China and called for the country to not host the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n\"Here [in the US] there is freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of expression, freedom of the press,\" Kanter Freedom told CNN of his decision to change his last name and become a citizen. \"I didn't have any of those with Turkey.\"\n\n\"Freedom is the greatest thing a human being can have,\" he added. \"That's why I wanted to make that word a part of me, and carry it wherever I go.\"\n\n04 of 28\n\nKallie Humphries\n\nHumphries is officially a United States citizen!\n\nThe Canada-born bobsledder will be eligible to compete for the U.S. at the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing, according to a December 2021 announcement from Team USA. She is expected to be named to the team in January.\n\n\"I'm more emotional than I thought I would be,\" said Humphries in a release from USA Bobsled/Skeleton. \"Even though you believe in your application and you know it meets the requirements, you don't know. When she came back in and said, 'Yes, I'm approving your application for citizenship,' then it was real.\"\n\nShe added, \"It was a long journey, this has been a team effort and feels amazing to have the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\"\n\n05 of 28\n\nTyler Labine\n\nThe Canadian comedian-actor opened up about his feelings — \"too many to go into\" — about becoming a U.S. citizen.\n\n\"I'm a proud immigrant to this great country. Are there problems here? Yes. Are there things that I take issue with? Yes,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Say what you will about this place, but it's one heck of an experiment. A never ending work in progress. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't after the American Dream. It's here. It's still Alive and I was in a room full of very grateful people today who felt the exact same way.\"\n\nHe added, \"So today is a great day. Thank you for accepting me America. For welcoming me. I'll always try my best to do right by you.\"\n\n06 of 28\n\nGleb Savchenko\n\nAfter 17 years, the Dancing with the Stars pro has achieved his \"impossible dream\" of becoming an American citizen, he revealed to E! News.\n\n\"It's a dream come true,\" Savchenko told the outlet of the momentous occasion, which took place on July 28, 2021. \"I grew up in Russia, in Moscow, and I'd always just read [about the States].\"\n\n\"It was like an impossible dream for me to live in America and one day become an American citizen,\" he added.\n\n07 of 28\n\nBrad Goreski\n\n\"Today I became an American citizen! 🇺🇸❤️ ,\" the Canadian-born TV personality shared on Instagram on July 28, 2021. \"I've been in this country for 20 years this month and I am so grateful for the life I have here.\"\n\n\"So happy @garyjanetti could be with me and yes those are tears in our eyes 😭,\" he added, along with a photo of the pair posing with the American flag.\n\n08 of 28\n\nSasha Farber & Emma Slater\n\nThe Dancing with the Stars couple commemorated their citizenship ceremony with a happy photo on Instagram. Farber was born in Russia but moved to Australia as a child, while Slater is from the United Kingdom.\n\n\"I've dreamed of this day ever since I was a little boy in Russia watching blockbuster movies. I came to America to try out for a show called @dancingabc and my whole life changed, I proposed to my beautiful wife @theemmaslater on the show, got married, bought our first house, rescued a dog, made so many incredible memories and so many new friends I call my family here in America, and now I get to call America my home!!!\" wrote Farber.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for DWTS for believing in me and giving me a chance. WE ARE OFFICIALLY CITIZENS!!! Now it's time to bring my mum and dad over to be with us thank you,\" he said.\n\n09 of 28\n\nTristan Thompson\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Twitter account shared a photo of the Canadian-born basketball star taking the Oath of Allegiance on Nov. 24, 2020.

I didn't feel it. Giving my name and getting the ballot, I didn't feel it. Scanning it into the machine and the machine saying, 'Your vote has been counted,' - I nearly burst into tears,\" he told Colbert. \"That is the truth. My eyes got misty, and I thought, I don't know if I can cry in a voting station.\"\n\n11 of 28\n\nYolanda Hadid\n\nThe former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, who is from the Netherlands, became a U.S. citizen \"just recently\" - and casted her first ballot in the U.S. 2020 election.\n\nCaptioning a series of photos of the pair, daughter Bella wrote, \"Took my mama to vote for the first time today!!!

Today, I will register to vote, and vote for the change I wish to see in OUR nation.\"\n\n15 of 28\n\nNeil Young\n\nThe singer-songwriter, who is originally from Canada, shared the news on his website on Jan. 22, 2020, writing, \"I'm happy to report I'm in!!\" The announcement was made along with a photo of Young saluting next to an American flag and a sign that reads, \"Democrats register to vote here.\"\n\n\"Vote your conscience,\" he added, along with an emoji of an American flag and a Canadian flag.\n\nHe also shared a video on Instagram, in which he waves a mini flag with the American stars and stripes on one side, as well as the Canadian maple leaf on the other.\n\n\"I'm proud to be a Cana-erican,\" he sings in the video, combining his two citizenships into one.\n\n16 of 28\n\nRobbie Amell & Italia Ricci\n\n\"3866 people from 116 different countries became American citizens today,\" the Canada-born Flash actor, 31, wrote on a photo of the American flag on his Instagram Story on Jan. 22, 2020. \"@italiaricci and I were two of them.

In an Instagram sharing photos from the day, she admitted the milestone made her emotional.\n\n\"I'm getting misty eyed writing this, because I haven't reflected on my life up until this point ... here I was sitting in an auditorium with 1000 people, with my Ukrainian/American husband and my American son....a girl from little Perth with a big dream of being 'someone',\" she wrote. \"I love the life I created, but it wouldn't be possible without the United States giving me the chance to succeed and live in the best country in the world ...This will always be home now.\"\n\n18 of 28\n\nMike Fisher\n\nThe former NHL star, who is married to country singer Carrie Underwood, is \"officially American,\" he announced on Instagram in March.

Urban described how he particularly eased into American life during a June 2014 interview with Rolling Stone.\n\nWhen asked how different Nashville felt after visiting to moving there permanently, the country star said: \"It instantly felt like home to me … Nashville felt very familiar to me because I grew up with so much American culture. I would say 95 percent, if not more, of all the television we watched growing up, my brother and I, was all American sitcoms, American movies, American dramas, everything. I just waltzed into Nashville and the way everyone talked sounded completely normal to me.\"\n\n24 of 28\n\nKumail Nanjiani\n\nThe Pakistan-born actor-comedian said it took him over a decade to get his U.S. citizenship. Nanjiani took to Twitter to open up about his challenging experience.\n\n\"I feel like people think immigrating to the US is super easy. The gates are wide open. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" he tweeted in July 2018, according to Business Standard. \"It took me 15 years to get my Green Card. Getting any kind of visa is difficult.
