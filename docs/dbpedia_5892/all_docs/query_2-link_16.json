        "text": "Dateline: Wroclaw, Poland\n\nObtaining a second citizenship is an important step in internationalizing your life so that no one country can control your freedom or your wealth.\n\nAnd here at Nomad Capitalist, we help people like you do just that.\n\nBut having a second passport isn’t ideal if you have to relinquish your original citizenship in order to get it. That’s just trading one passport for another. In some cases, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it all depends on which country you’re trading up to.\n\nWhile more and more countries are allowing dual citizenship, several dual citizenship countries are beginning to crack down on their citizens with multiple nationalities.\n\nAnd, of course, there are countries where dual citizenship is strictly forbidden. This list is updated for 2022 and takes into account several European countries which are taking on the prevailing trend of more liberal policies toward people holding multiple citizenships.\n\nHere is a list of countries that allow dual citizenship, as well as countries that do not allow dual nationality.\n\nCountries that Allow You to Hold Dual Citizenship\n\n*Countries with an asterisk allow dual citizenship under select conditions only.\n\nAlbania. The Albanian nationality law has been permitting dual citizenship since 1992.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda. Antigua and Barbuda does permit dual citizenship, which is great for business men who are looking for tax relief. The citizenship application gets processed within three to four months only and it doesn’t even require you to travel to the country to get it.\n\nArgentina*. Argentina allows dual citizenship with only Italy and Spain. Argentina has dual citizenship agreements with Italy and Spain. Individuals from other countries have to renounce their original citizenship before acquiring Argentinian citizenship.\n\nArmenia. The Armenian nationality law adopted in 1995 and amended in 2007 permits dual citizenship.\n\nAustralia. The Australian government claims that it is possible to hold citizenship for two or more countries as far as they’re concerned. This applies to those who obtain another nationality automatically, such as through marriage, or through being permanent residents or other application process.\n\nBarbados. Barbados not only allows Barbadian citizens to maintain a second nationality, they actually encourage those living overseas to keep this potential benefit in mind.\n\nBangladesh. In case you have the urge to become a naturalized citizen of this South Asian nation, be careful not to be sentenced to a long prison term or incur a criminal fine within five years of your new citizenship. Doing so could void your naturalization. Otherwise, Bangladesh citizens are not eligible to lose their citizens, including when obtaining another nationality.\n\nBelgium. Belgium used to be one of the easiest and best countries in which to obtain a second citizenship. In fact, it was possible to become a Belgian citizen in as quickly as three years if you established ties in the country and kept your nose clean. While it now takes five years at a bare minimum — and as many as nine — to become naturalized in Belgium, the good news is that existing Belgian citizens are eligible to hold dual citizenship as of 2008.\n\nBelize. Belize allows dual citizenship with any country that allows it, no restrictions.\n\nBolivia. Bolivia permits dual citizenship, and Bolivians who acquire other citizenships are not required to renounce it.\n\nBrazil. Dual citizenship has been permitted without restrictions in Brazil 1994. The fastest way to get Brazilian citizenship is by marriage.\n\nBulgaria*. Ethnic Bulgarians are entitled to maintain multiple nationalities without having to give up their Bulgarian passport. Those that did relinquish citizenship in the past may be able to get it back. However, those being naturalized as Bulgarians must renounce other nationalities upon becoming citizens.\n\nCanada. Canada is one of the more interesting case studies regarding dual citizenship. Due to its proximity to The Land of the Free, some Canadians were actually born in the United States and don’t know they hold a second nationality.. Canada seems to encourage its citizens to utilize their status of dual nationality, and certainly allows it. They do suggest you enter the country of your second citizenship using your Canadian passport, though, which may not be allowed under the second country’s rules.\n\nChile. Contrary to what other people might tell you, Chile allows dual nationality.\n\nCosta Rica. Costa Rica is one of the Americas’ hardest countries in which to become naturalized, but all Costa Rican citizens may maintain other nationalities without issue.\n\nCroatia*. Ethnic Croatians who obtained citizenship by birth or by descent from at least one parent may maintain other nationalities. However, those who become naturalized Croatians must renounce all other citizenships, or be prepared to do so, before receiving Croatian citizenship.\n\nCyprus. Considering that Cyprus markets its own (expensive) economic citizenship program, it only makes sense that Cyprus allows you to maintain additional citizenships.\n\nCzech Republic. Nationalists in the Czech Republic worked to uphold a long-standing tradition of forbidding citizens from having other allegiances. However, as of 2014, the Czech Republic allows for multiple nationalities. It is part of their effort to further align themselves with the policies of the EU. Former Czech nationals who lost their citizenship can apply for reinstatement.\n\nDenmark. For years, Denmark has restricted its citizens to be Danish… or choose to be something else. However, as of 2015 it allows dual citizenship.\n\nDominica. Dominica is one of the countries that recognize dual citizenship and will not ask its passport holders to give up their existing citizenship.\n\nEgypt. Egyptian citizens may obtain multiple nationalities. However, they must notify the “proper” Egyptian authorities first. There is no such thing as private second citizenship without jeopardizing Egyptian citizenship. Citizens must also inform the government of their intent to keep Egyptian citizenship within one year of obtaining the foreign citizenship. Egyptian dual nationals are exempt from military service and prohibited from enrolling in military and police academies, or from being elected to Egyptian Parliament. Sounds like a good deal to me.\n\nEl Salvador*. El Salvador allows for dual citizenship, but only for those who obtained El Salvador nationality by birth. Naturalized citizens may not hold multiple nationalities.\n\nFinland. As of 2003, Finnish citizens are entitled to hold dual citizenships and even multiple citizenships. Those naturalized as Finnish citizens are permitted to keep their original citizenship, as well. Foreigners who acquire a Finnish nationality will not be obliged to renounce their current nationality.\n\nFrance. French citizens are entitled to hold dual or multiple citizenships, and have been for several decades. In addition, France denounced a Council of Europe proposal that attempted to reduce cases of multiple nationalities.\n\nGermany*. The German cabinet just gave the go-ahead to allow Germans to maintain dual citizenship if they are born to a German and a non-German parent, or to parents with dual nationality, if they are ​ethnic German repatriates, if they can’t renounce their other citizenship and more. Historically, those with foreign-born parents had to choose between their parents’ nationality and German nationality once they became an adult. The law proposes to change that.\n\nGreece. Greek citizens are allowed to maintain dual citizenships unless they request to renounce Greek citizenship. Renunciation of Greek citizenship is subject to completion of any military service requirement. It’s possible to obtain second residency in Greece and work toward citizenship, but the government won’t be on your side.\n\nGrenada. Grenada recognizes dual citizenship, which means that the investors flocking in for the Grenada citizenship by investment program don’t have to renounce their original citizenship.\n\nHungary. Hungary flirted with its own economic citizenship program (as well as citizenship-based taxation) and does allow its citizens to maintain multiple citizenships.\n\nIceland. Much like Finland, Iceland overturned its ban on holding more than one citizenship in 2003 and offered those who lost Icelandic status under the old system four years to apply for reinstatement.\n\nIreland. Ireland does allow dual citizenship. Like Israel and Italy, Ireland allows those with Irish ancestors to claim an Irish passport. It’s one of the best citizenship by descent passports. In fact, there are some 14 million Irish passports in circulation, despite the country having a much, much smaller population. Ireland Golden Visa is also one of the most popular European Golden Visas.\n\nIsrael. In an attempt to increase the roster of Israeli citizens and Jews with Israeli passports, Israel has a very straightforward passport program through the Law of Return. Israel is more than happy to allow its citizens to maintain dual nationality.\n\nItaly. Italy considers anyone with Italian bloodlines an Italian citizen… even before you apply to claim an ancestral passport. As long as you can prove your Italian ancestry, you can become an Italian citizen. Italy does not require you to renounce other citizenships when you follow this procedure, or when you become a naturalized citizen through residence.\n\nJamaica. According to Jamaica’s own consulate websites, the country recognizes dual citizenship.\n\nKosovo. Many Kosovars have special, recognizable Serbian passports issued from a special passport unit in Belgrade, as Serbia still does not recognize Kosovo as an independent state. Due to many Kosovaars having Serbian citizenship, and even third citizenships in places they migrated to (such as Germany), Kosovo allows dual citizenship.\n\nLatvia. The Baltic country recently liberalized its laws to allow Latvians to hold another nationality (or more than one). This is a great opportunity for those who obtain Latvian residency by starting a business or investing in real estate or through other ways, and have the eventual goal of becoming Latvian citizens.\n\nLebanon. Lebanon permits dual citizenship. Nonetheless, the government can lawfully require a dual citizen to renounce the foreign citizenship.\n\nLiberia. As of November 11th, 2021, a dual citizenship bill was passed allowing Liberians to hold dual citizenship freely. Liberians cannot be rid of their citizenship unless they choose to renounce it.\n\nLuxembourg. Luxembourg allows dual citizenship or even multiple citizenships. Luxembourgian citizens who voluntarily either acquire or recover a foreign citizenship will not lose their citizenship.\n\nMalawi. Malawi amended its laws in November of 2021 to allow citizens to hold dual citizenships.\n\nMalta. Malta citizenship program allows anyone to become Maltese within one year without relinquishing their existing citizenships. This goes hand-in-hand with their favorable view on dual citizenships.\n\nMexico. A Mexican at birth may acquire other nationalities, but will always be considered Mexican by the Mexican government. Furthermore, all Mexican citizens must enter and leave the country on his or her Mexican passport. They may also be prohibited from partaking in certain investments within the country. Here’s how you can get second residency and citizenship in Mexico.\n\nMorocco. Moroccan law recognizes dual citizenship,but allegedly, you must be granted a permission from the government before you actually acquire your second citizenship.\n\nNew Zealand. New Zealand allows dual and even multiple citizenship. You can be a citizen of New Zealand and any other country that allows dual citizenship at the same time.\n\nNigeria. Nigerians may have more than one citizenship, despite some limited public pressure against the practice in the African country.\n\nNorway. Since early 2020, Norwegian citizens have been allowed dual citizenship. You can’t lose your Norwegian citizenship by becoming a citizen of another country.\n\nPakistan. Due to a growing number of Pakistan citizens living overseas, the government now recognizes dual citizenship for Pakistan citizens under most circumstances. However, dual citizens are forbidden from certain voting rights, serving in the military, or holding any number of public offices or even civil servant jobs. Not a bad trade-off.\n\nPanama. Panama allows dual citizenship. A second residence (and an eventual second passport) in Panama can be obtained rather easily by citizens of any of 50 “friendly nations” — namely most Western countries — making dual citizenship an important part of the country.\n\nPeru. Similar to some other Latin countries, Peru’s Constitution allows citizens of other Latin countries (including Spain) who become naturalized citizens to maintain their previous nationality. In practice, dual citizenship is allowed in many cases.\n\nPhilippines. Obtaining citizenship in the Philippines is nearly impossible for foreigners (although residency is easy), but Filipinos who obtain a second citizenship usually don’t lose their Filipino passport. If they do, however, there is a process to get it back.\n\nPortugal. Portugal allows dual citizenship, and also offers an easy residency program for those wishing to invest in the promising Portuguese real estate.\n\nRomania. Romania does not cancel the citizenships of those who obtain a second passport elsewhere, although it does not claim responsibility for other nationalities being lost as a result of keeping Romanian citizenship. There have been cases of people who have lost their multiple nationalities after re-applying for Romanian citizenship. Furthermore, Romania has a controversial practice of granting dual citizenship to Moldovans.\n\nRussia*. Russia officially allows dual citizenship only if there is a treaty on recognition of dual citizenship between Russia and the other country. Shocking? We know. Here’s the catch, Russia has dual citizenship treaties with just two countries: Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nSerbia. Located in southeast Europe, Serbia offers one of the least known citizenship by descent programs. As such, it allows Serbians to maintain other nationalities.\n\nSlovakia*. As part of a dispute with Hungary over its citizenship by descent policies, Slovakia limits dual citizenship in many cases. It does allow dual nationalities though for those that obtain its passport through birth or marriage.\n\nSlovenia. Slovenia, whose passport also confers European Union citizenship, may forbid those becoming naturalized citizens from keeping their existing nationalities. However, it does not prohibit native Slovenians from having a second passport in most cases.\n\nSouth Africa. Until 1995, South Africa forbade its citizens from traveling on foreign passports. A 2004 law changed that and eliminated a requirement that forced those seeking dual nationality to apply for permission. As with many other countries, South Africa requires its nationals to enter and leave the country with their South African travel documents. It is worth nothing that South Africans who wish to obtain new citizenships going forward must inform the government BEFORE doing so, or else they will lose South African nationality. South Africa has one of the most powerful passports in Africa.\n\nSouth Korea*. South Korea, while a great country, is a rather insular culture and long forbade its citizens from having another passport. However, as of 2011, a new law allowed those who became dual nationals at birth to retain both passports if they declared their intention to remain South Korean by age 22. The law does not allow South Koreans to obtain other citizenships as adults. However, expats living in South Korea who obtain citizenship — including through the country’s immigrant investor program — can retain their birth citizenship.\n\nSpain. Spain requires Spanish nationals to inform the government within three years if they obtain another nationality. It makes exceptions for those individuals who are natural citizens of an Iberoamerican country, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea or Portugal.\n\nSaint Kitts & Nevis. Not only does St Kitts & Nevis have no restrictions on dual citizenship, but it does not report citizenship information to other countries either. Great for all the global investors applying for its citizenship by investment program. Read more about citizenship by investment.\n\nSaint Lucia. Saint Lucia recognizes dual citizenship, which is great news to investors given that the country has one of the fastest citizenship by investment programs in the world.\n\nSweden. In 2001, Sweden abandoned a long-held policy of prohibited dual nationalities. Now, Swedish citizens may acquire other passports and foreigners applying for naturalization in Sweden may keep their existing citizenship.\n\nSwitzerland. An estimated 60% of Swiss citizens living abroad are dual nationals, and that’s just fine according to Switzerland. As of 1992, the country does not forbid having another passport, nor does it force naturalized Swiss citizens to relinquish their original nationality. (Although celebrities like Tina Turner have obtained Swiss nationality as a means to relinquish US citizenship.)\n\nSyria. Syrian citizenship is a complicated thing. You get it by being the child of a Syrian father, or a Syrian mother whose partner is of stateless or unknown origins. And obtaining Syrian citizenship is near impossible: you have to marry a Syrian and live in the country for ten years. However, Syria generally allows its citizens to have other passports, although the government itself advises that renouncing Syrian nationality is so difficult it’s best not to even bother.\n\nTurkey. Turkey allows multiple nationalities, but does require those obtaining them to provide a load of documents to Turkish officials during the process. Unlike many countries, Turkey does not require dual nationals to use their Turkish passport when entering or leaving the country.\n\nUnited Kingdom. Since the British Nationality Act of 1948, the UK has not restricted its citizens from having other nationalities. However, British Overseas Territories citizens (such as citizens of Anguilla) may lose their ability to obtain a British passport if they obtain another nationality.\n\nUnited States. In almost all circumstances, the United States allows dual citizenship. You may be required to declare “other allegiances” when applying for certain government programs or a US passport, but their request is more snooping than anything else.\n\nYou should be aware that taking up a foreign citizenship with the “intention” of relinquishing your US citizenship can cause you to lose US citizenship. So can fighting in a foreign military or working for a foreign government in any number of jobs.\n\nVanuatu. Vanuatu does allow dual citizenship, you can get the Ni-Vanuatu citizenship within 30 to 60 days. If you have a dual citizenship though, you will have minorly less voting rights and less political involvement.\n\nVenezuela. Venezuela recognizes dual citizenship. Also, Children born on Venezuelan soil are entitled to Venezuelan citizenship (regardless of their parents’ nationalities).\n\nZambia. Dual citizenship has been permitted in Zambia since 2016. Zambian citizens, by birth, will not lose their citizenship by acquiring that of another country.\n\nWant to Become a Dual Citizen?\n\nCountries that Don’t Allow Dual Citizenship\n\nAndorra. Andorrans who take up a foreign citizenship lose their Andorran nationality, but can apply to have it reinstated later if they are willing to renounce the citizenship they took up. Foreigners shouldn’t need to worry about this procedure, since becoming a naturalized citizen of Andorra takes twenty years of residence, one of the longest periods on earth.\n\nAustria. Austria severely limits dual nationality in the country. This is interesting, considering there is a “secret” citizenship by investment program that allows wealthy investors to become Austrian citizens in exchange for a donation of several million dollars — so long as they can prove they are “Austrian enough”. The only exceptions to these restrictions are 1) for children born to one Austrian and one foreign parent whose country confers citizenship to children, 2) to children given foreign citizenship by virtue of being born in a foreign country (like the United States), 3) to those unable by law to renounce their existing citizenship at home, or 4) to foreign professors who receive Austrian nationality. Read more about how to get second citizenship for children.\n\nBahrain. While the Kingdom of Bahrain has a long tradition of awarding citizenship to expats who make a substantial contribution to the tiny Middle Eastern country, Bahrain does forbid dual nationality, except for a few Gulf state passport holders.\n\nChina. China technically forbids dual nationality, but many Chinese tell me enforcement of this is weak. They also mention that China considers Chinese citizens to be only Chinese, but does not actually restrict them from holding other passports.\n\nDjibouti. Djibouti does not recognize its citizens’ ability to hold another passport, and any citizen who obtains another nationality will lose his or her Djibouti passport. Enforcement, however, is another matter.\n\nEstonia. Although not technically allowed, plenty of Estonians hold second passports, mainly from Russia. The Estonian government may allow naturalized citizens to keep existing citizenships, or may simply not check. However, naturalized citizens who obtain another citizenship after being naturalized will lose their Estonian nationality. Native born Estonians are not subject to this provision, however, because Estonian citizenship is determined “by blood” and cannot be taken away from anyone.\n\nIndia. Does India allow dual nationality? Sadly, the answer is “no”. However, due to demands from its diaspora, the country did introduce the Overseas Citizenship of India program. The program offers a document that looks like a passport, but does not serve as a substitute for a travel document, nor does it confer Indian citizenship.\n\nIndonesia. While Indonesian officials are working to allow citizens to hold multiple nationalities, no such law exists yet, and Indonesians may not hold other citizenships.\n\nJapan. Japan is one of the strictest immigration countries on earth. It does not allow citizens to maintain other allegiances and forces children who hold more than one passport to choose which one they wish to retain once they become adults.\n\nLithuania. Lithuania offers citizenship by descent to those with Lithuanian great-grandparents, but requires all Lithuanians to choose between their citizenship and another nationality. The only exception is those with ancestors who left during times of occupation for reasons of persecution.\n\nMalaysia. Although I recommend the MM2H visa program for residency, anyone holding Malaysian citizenship is disallowed from holding any other citizenship.\n\nMontenegro. While there have been talks to allow dual nationality between Serbians and Montenegrins (in light of the two countries’ being one until 2006), citizens of Montenegro are forbidden to hold other citizenships and will lose their citizenship if they are naturalized elsewhere.\n\nThe Netherlands. In general, Dutch citizenship forbids obtaining an additional nationality. However, there are exceptions for Dutch subjects — including those in the Dutch Antilles — who obtain other citizenships at birth or through marriage.\n\nPoland. Poland does not forbid its citizens from holding dual citizenship, but the country does not recognize it either. But there are cases where “exercising a second citizenship” is disallowed, such as identifying yourself to Polish authorities as a foreign citizen.\n\nSingapore. Singapore has been a much-ballyhooed second passport in the offshore world, with claims citizenship can be obtained in as little as two years. That opportunity is no longer available. Plus, Singapore citizenship confers mandatory military service on the citizens as well as their children. In an attempt to protect the “fabric” of their small country, Singapore aggressively forbids dual nationality.\n\nTanzania. While some officials in the African country have suggested loosening the policy, Tanzanians are currently not permitted to hold dual citizenship, except in the case of women who acquire a second nationality by marrying a foreigner. The country’s Asian immigrant population is often cited as a factor for “potential disloyalty” if the citizenship rules were to be loosened.\n\nThailand. As one of the most insular and imperious countries on earth, Thailand forbids dual nationality. A bit contradictory to the name, considering the word “Thailand” means “The Land of the Free”, after all.\n\nUkraine. Currently, Ukraine does not easily allow for dual citizenship. They even considered imposing prison sentences of up to ten years for having dual nationality.
