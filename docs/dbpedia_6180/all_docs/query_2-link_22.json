        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Democratic lawmakers are pushing to increase the Tennessee minimum wage to the highest in the country.\n\nAfter our original story was published on Thursday on the bill to raise the state’s minimum wage to $20 an hour, WSMV4 heard from a lot of viewers concerned it would lead to even more inflation.\n\nShannon Powell’s family has been serving customers at Dalts American Grill for more than 20 years, but he said inflation since the pandemic has really hurt his bottom line.\n\n“Eventually guests are going to dictate that restaurants are an expendable item,” Powell said. “They don’t have to go out to eat. It will definitely hurt us long term. If you raise your prices too much, the guests aren’t going to keep coming. Eventually, it is going to shut you down.”\n\nPowell said a $20 minimum wage would increase the price of a beer or bowl of soup by another 30% to 40%. Right now, his employees are making at least $15 per hour.\n\n“You can get labor, but if you want good people, you have to pay more,” Powell said. “It’s been a struggle in Nashville the past couple of years. Everybody fighting over, downtown is busy. They want all the good employees, but we want to keep some of them here in West Nashville.”\n\nRep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, who filed the bill, said families are struggling to put food on the table. She said Tennessee currently does not offer a livable minimum wage.\n\nTennessee is one of 20 states currently at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Washington state has the highest in the country, at $16.28 per hour, but cities like Seattle have even higher minimum wages at $19.97.\n\n“We are behind,” Johnson said. “People are struggling to keep the lights on and keep food on the table. Other states that have raised the wage are doing well with it.”\n\nWSMV4 wanted to compare prices in Seattle to what we see in Nashville right now to estimate the inflation people in Middle Tennessee would see with a $20 minimum wage. A simple black coffee from the Starbucks on Charlotte Avenue is currently $2.95. The same order from a location in Seattle is 50 cents more, plus Seattle has higher sales tax.\n\nPowell said he is concerned even his regulars would stop going to restaurants if they’re having to pay a lot more for necessities like groceries.\n\n“It affected every cost from a gallon of milk to a cheeseburger at Dalts,” Powell said about minimum wage increases in other states. “It was quite massive.”\n\nHe supports a minimum wage increase to keep people from paying their employees unfairly but believes the economy should be able to dictate what someone makes.\n\nA similar minimum wage increase bill failed in the Tennessee General Assembly two years ago. Johnson said she doesn’t have a lot of hope it will pass this time around."
