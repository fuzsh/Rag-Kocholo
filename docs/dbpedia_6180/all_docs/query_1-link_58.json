        "text": "SBA's VBOCs offer workshops, training, counseling, and mentorship opportunities in your area. VBOCs can also help you navigate SBAâ€™s extensive resource partner network and refer you to a community partner, lender, or SBA program.\n\nTransition Assistance Programs\n\nVBOCs work closely with SBA district offices and Transition Service Managers at military installations to conduct Boots to Business classes for service members and military spouses. VBOCs also help conduct B2B Reboot classes off installations for veterans of all eras, National Guard and Reserve members, and military spouses.\n\nPre-Business Plan Workshops\n\nVBOCs conduct entrepreneurial development workshops dealing specifically with the major issues of self-employment. An important segment of these workshops covers the usage of the Internet as a tool for developing and expanding businesses. Each client is afforded the opportunity to work directly with a business counselor.\n\nConcept Assessments\n\nVBOCs assist clients in assessing their entrepreneurial needs and requirements.\n\nBusiness Plan Preparation\n\nVBOCs assist clients in developing and maintaining a five-year business plan. The business plan includes such elements as the legal form of the business, equipment requirements and cost, organizational structure, a strategic plan, market analysis, and a financial plan. Financial plans include financial projections, budget projections, and funding requirements.\n\nComprehensive Feasibility Analysis\n\nVBOCs provide assistance in identifying and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the business plan to increase the probability of success. The results of the analysis are used to revise the strategic planning portion of the business plan.\n\nEntrepreneurial Training and Counseling\n\nVBOCs, working with other SBA resource partners, target entrepreneurial training projects and counseling sessions tailored specifically to address the needs and concerns of the veteran entrepreneur community, including service-disabled veterans, women veterans, and veterans interested in procurement.\n\nMentorship\n\nVBOCs conduct, as appropriate, on-site visits with clients to ensure adherence to their business plans. Additionally, VBOCs review monthly financial statements to determine whether a revision of the business plan is warranted or that desired results are being attained.\n\nOther Business Developmental Related Services\n\nVBOCs also provide assistance and training in such areas as international trade, franchising, internet marketing, accounting, and more."
