        "text": "We are America’s best friend, the voices 9 out of 10 people listen to every month. It is a great responsibility to give 276M listeners a trusted friend, whenever and wherever they need one.\n\nFraud Alert\n\nWe recently learned that dishonest individuals are impersonating members of the iHeartMedia recruiting team. These groups often offer fraudulent employment opportunities in attempt to obtain sensitive personal and financial information from the applicant. Please exercise extreme caution when sharing any personal or financial information.\n\nTo protect yourself and others from falling victim to these scams please note the following:\n\nApplicants should visit the iHeartMedia.com/Careers page to see all job postings and/or apply on this website only\n\nJob Postings on LinkedIn etc. will also route you to our careers page\n\niHeartMedia recruiters will arrange all interviews and job offers via an official “iHeartMedia.com” email address\n\niHeartMedia recruiters will never interview or provide job offers though text or messaging app (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc).\n\nApplicants should visit the iHeartMedia.com/Careers page to see all job postings and/or apply on this website only\n\nPlease exercise caution if you choose to provide personal information via email or other social media channels. And do not click any links that you do not recognize.\n\nIn addition, iHeartMedia will never ask for any financial commitment from a candidate as a pre-employment requirement. If you believe you have been contacted about a fraudulent job offer, please contact us at the following address: HR4U@iheartmedia.com\n\nWe should never feel uneasy about (politely, please) expressing dissenting opinions as we develop new products, services and processes. Dissent forces us to examine possible flaws; we want to find the holes we need to plug to make the new ideas or existing products even better, and dissenters tell us where to look.\n\nWorking as a team is always more powerful. Except for information we must keep confidential for competitive or legal reasons, let’s be transparent about what we’re doing. Additionally, take the time to use precise communications so that everyone will know what they need to do and why, which is the starting point for collaboration.\n\nWe should treat everyone as we’d like to be treated or how they would like to be treated and recognize that we are a company that serves all the diverse communities in America. We must both represent those communities internally and commit to serving them externally. As a company we value diversity and respect all voices, both inside and outside our company.\n\nWe need to make decisions as soon as we have enough information, not wait until we have “all the information.” Everything is better done sooner. This is a strong competitive advantage for us.\n\nMistakes are often the byproduct of innovation – when we try new things, we have to be prepared that many will not work and accept that some mistakes made in the pursuit of new ideas are inevitable. If we’re afraid to make mistakes, we will never take the chances necessary to achieve breakthrough ideas. When we invariably do make a mistake – yes, we will make some -- it’s critical to spot it quickly -- and then change or fix it as soon as we can, so a bias toward quick decision-making is also important because it will keep mistakes from becoming problems.\n\nOur stations and our company are integral parts of their local communities, as are each of us. We should remember that, even as we work to make our company stronger, we must think about what we can do to make our communities stronger, both on-air and off.\n\nThe only way to be great is to be reliable and the only way to make great decisions is to base them on truth. We must base everything we do, both internally and externally, on honesty and integrity."
