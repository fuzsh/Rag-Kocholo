        "text": "* Clients are urged to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of investing HSA funds versus holding them in their Pinnacle Health Savings Account. Investors should carefully read the prospectus from each mutual fund selected before investing. There are no guarantees that the investment will make money, and additional contributions above and beyond the yearly maximum HSA contributions cannot be made to an HSA account to replace any losses that result from investing. HSA investments are not deposits of or guaranteed by Pinnacle Bank, are not insured by the FDIC and may lose value. Please keep these factors in mind when considering this option.\n\n** Please refer to the individual fund prospectus for further performance, expense and fee information.\n\n*** We will deduct a custodial management fee from your investment account in an amount up to 1/16 of 1 percent (0.0625%) per quarter before the end of each calendar quarter. This equates to 0.25%, which is $2.50 per $1,000, annually."
