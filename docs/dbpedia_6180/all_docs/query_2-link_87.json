We focus on the resource areas of social support, economic opportunity, education, housing, and healthcare. Through strategic partnership and innovative programming, we envision people in marginalized communities living long, healthy, and wealthy lives.\n\nJustice begins where healing occurs.\n\n#justiceishealing\n\nAs a police officer, Raphah Institute founder and CEO Travis Claybrooks saw firsthand the limitations of government systems alone to solve the complicated challenges facing people experiencing social harm. As a pastor, Travis also saw how distant he and many other people of faith were from the people and communities broken by harm and trauma. These observations led him to take action and join the many other community leaders working to make Nashville a city of healing.\n\nTravis founded Raphah Institute to engage a larger work around addressing harm and trauma. Through this initiative, led by the vision of juvenile court judge Sheila Calloway and in partnership with District Attorney General Glenn Funk; then-public defender Dawn Deaner; police chief, Steve Anderson; and with the support of then-mayor Megan Berry; Raphah Institute launched its flagship program, the Restorative Justice Diversion Program, focused on using restorative practices as an alternative for resolving felony cases in juvenile court. The program has since supported over 150 people in their journey towards healing and positive transformation and serves as a testament to Raphah’s belief that #justiceishealing.\n\nYoung people -\n\nParents -\n\nHarmed party -\n\nResponsible party -\n\nJuvenile court -\n\nDistrict Attorney's office -\n\nYoung people - Parents - Harmed party - Responsible party - Juvenile court - District Attorney's office - Young people - Parents - Harmed party - Responsible party - Juvenile court - District Attorney's office -\n\nPublic Defender's office -\n\nPolice -\n\nTennessee Voices for Victims -\n\nEpic Girl -\n\nChoosing Justice Initiative -\n\nNotes for Notes -\n\nCafé Momentum -\n\nBeliever's Covenant -\n\nPublic Defender's office - Police - Tennessee Voices for Victims - Epic Girl - Choosing Justice Initiative - Notes for Notes - Café Momentum - Believer's Covenant - Public Defender's office - Police - Tennessee Voices for Victims - Epic Girl - Choosing Justice Initiative - Notes for Notes - Café Momentum - Believer's Covenant -\n\nChildcare providers -\n\nFamilies of children -\n\nMetropolitan Development Housing Authority -\n\nThe City of Nashville, TN -\n\nHome Grown -\n\nAll Our Kin -\n\nUniversity of Tennessee Department of Child and Family Studies -\n\nUnited Way of Middle Tennessee -\n\nThe City of Memphis, TN -\n\nChildcare providers - Families of children - Metropolitan Development Housing Authority - The City of Nashville, TN - Home Grown - All Our Kin - University of Tennessee Department of Child and Family Studies - United Way of Middle Tennessee - The City of Memphis, TN - Childcare providers - Families of children - Metropolitan Development Housing Authority - The City of Nashville, TN - Home Grown - All Our Kin - University of Tennessee Department of Child and Family Studies - United Way of Middle Tennessee - The City of Memphis, TN -\n\nA few of our partners\n\nIn the News\n\nThe Reality of our Justice System\n\nHave you seen the Max documentary Justice, USA? How does our justice system affect our society as a whole? On this episode of MorningLine, Nick Beres is joined by our CEO, Travis Claybrooks, Martesha Johnson Moore, the Nashville Metropolitan Chief Public Defender and Dawn Deaner, former Nashville Metropolitan Chief Public Defender and Founder and Executive Director of the Choosing Justice Initiative to discuss how our justice system works and where there are issues.\n\nRaphah Featured on NPR Affiliate Show\n\nExploring the transformative power of restorative practice within the legal system, this insightful piece from WPLN’s This Is Nashville delves into how a shift towards restorative justice can profoundly change communities, environments, and individuals. Featuring firsthand experiences from participants and experts at Raphah Institute, the interview illuminates the potential for restorative practices to address and heal the harm on both sides of a crime, fostering resolutions that satisfy all involved parties.\n\nJustice USA Documentary on Max features Raphah Institute\n\nJustice, USA: Go inside Nashville’s legal system, as citizens and law enforcement confront issues of incarceration, mental illness, and addiction. Raphah Institute’s restorative justice initiative is featured in episode 6, streaming beginning March 28.\n\nWPLN’s This is Nashville: To fight Nashville’s childcare crisis, residents may need to get into the childcare business\n\nThe solution to Nashville’s childcare shortage may be looking us in the mirror, say guests on This Is Nashville. There are simply more toddlers than there are spots in daycare centers. Many parents have limited affordable options or none at all. Travis Claybrooks, CEO of the Raphah Institute, says more parents should consider becoming home-based providers for their children and others.\n\nThe Tennessean: Inside Nashville's $7.5M endeavor to revolutionize access to childcare\n\nEquipped with $7.5 million in American Rescue Plan funds, United Way of Greater Nashville and Raphah Institute are embarking on a carefully considered two-year experiment aiming to revolutionize childcare in Nashville.\n\nThe Annie E. Casey Foundation: More Communities Exploring Restorative Justice for Youth\n\nJuve­nile jus­tice juris­dic­tions across the nation — in California’s Los Ange­les and Alame­da coun­ties, Philadel­phia and David­son coun­ty in Ten­nessee — are using restora­tive jus­tice to divert youth who have caused harm. The approach, which is gain­ing trac­tion in schools, com­mu­ni­ties and sys­tems, trades court pro­ceed­ings for com­mu­ni­ty-based responses. “I feel like every per­son harmed — and every young per­son respon­si­ble for harm — should have the oppor­tu­ni­ty to know there’s a restora­tive jus­tice process avail­able to them,” says Travis Clay­brooks.\n\nThe Annie E. Casey Foundation: What is Restorative Justice for Young People?\n\nThe Annie E. Casey Foun­da­tion invests in the pro­mo­tion and imple­men­ta­tion of restora­tive jus­tice prac­tices, which aim to build a sense of com­mu­ni­ty while respond­ing to con­flict and harm. These prac­tices are gain­ing trac­tion in schools and com­mu­ni­ties across the coun­try, among youth devel­op­ment and youth jus­tice experts as well as those who have expe­ri­enced crime.\n\nRecent grants\n\nMayor Cooper’s Community Safety Partnership Fund Advisory Board approves $820k in funding for 14 local nonprofits serving Napier & Sudekum. “I am excited about this life changing investment. Community safety requires community solutions,” said Mayor Cooper. “These small grants will have a big impact in helping to make our neighborhoods safer and meaningfully address violent crime in our communities.” Raphah to receive $237k to further the Restorative Justice Diversion Program work.\n\nA Special Thank You To Our\n\nLegacy Leader Corporate Sponsors"
