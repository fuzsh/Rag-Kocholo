If you are a California resident, you may be entitled to the following:\n\nRight to Access: to have access to your personal information upon simple request – that is, you may receive a copy of such information upon receipt of a verifiable request, along with other information related to the collection or processing.\n\nDisclosure of Direct Marketers: to have access upon simple request, and free of charge, the categories and names/addresses of third parties that have received personal information for direct marketing purposes.

Company will respond to an individual’s “verifiable request” to exercise his or her rights under the CCPA—that is, where Company has received a request purporting to be from a particular individual, and Company has been able to verify the individual’s identity.

An authorized agent may submit a request by following the steps outlined above. An authorized agent must identify the consumer he or she is submitting a request on behalf of, and provide the information requested by Company to verify the consumer’s identity. Company will also require the purported authorized agent to submit proof that he or she has been authorized by the consumer to act on the consumer’s behalf.\n\nBecause the security and privacy of your information is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your applicable rights under California law in such situations. This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information.
