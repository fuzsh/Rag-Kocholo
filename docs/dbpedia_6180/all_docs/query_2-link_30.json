        "text": "Business Valuations – Nashville (TN)\n\nMany business owners in Nashville and across Tennessee contemplate conducting a business valuation when it comes time for a transaction. While an independent determination of a company’s value is necessary before a transaction, a valuation has many other uses. The details contained within the report can provide important insight into how economic, competitive, global, and legal factors impact bottom-line value. These details can help management better understand the current market and the potential changes that can help drive value. Using a valuation as a planning tool can provide immense value before a transaction commences.\n\nThere are other situations when a valuation may be required. These include seeking new financing, updating shareholder or partnership agreements, conducting estate and gift tax planning during succession planning, and benchmarking purposes. Occasionally, Nashville attorneys will initiate a valuation to assist with litigation, including divorce, partner disputes, etc. Whatever the reason, working with a business appraiser with the needed experience is essential to meeting your needs.\n\nTennessee Business Valuation Experience\n\nBelfint, Lyons & Shuman works with business owners and attorneys in Nashville and Tennessee to conduct business appraisals.
