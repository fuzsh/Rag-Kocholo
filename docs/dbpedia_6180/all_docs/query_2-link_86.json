        "text": "WeGo Public Transit is currently undertaking a strategic planning effort to develop a long-term strategy for future investments and service scenarios for the WeGo Star, a commuter rail service which began operating in 2006.\n\nCurrently, the Star provides morning and evening commuter service to and from Lebanon and downtown Nashville. In addition, the Star offers special event trains to home Titans games and popular downtown events such as New Year’s Eve and July 4th celebrations. All service currently operates between high-demand freight times through a cooperative agreement with RJ Corman and the Nashville and Eastern Railroad Authority.\n\nOver the past several years, multiple planning studies have been conducted to look at transit service throughout Nashville and the broader region. This strategic planning effort is intended to identify changing ridership needs, impacts of current and projected population growth in the region, commuter and employment patterns, and pandemic related impacts on Star ridership. The result should provide options and opportunities to better utilize the Star to enhance regional livability, affordability, and quality of life for residents in Wilson and Davidson counties. It will also consider current and potential financial support structures and other means to improve the sustainability and long-term viability of the commuter train service.\n\nThroughout the strategic planning process, your feedback will help shape the future of the Star.\n\nWhat changes would you make to existing Star services?\n\nHow can the Star better serve your transportation needs?\n\nWhat are the things you love about the Start service?\n\nWhat kinds of things would you like to see in the future for Star service?\n\nSign up to get project updates here.\n\nOver the past several months the study team has continued their work looking at potential and viable short- and long-term service options. A potential short-term scenario was presented to the corridor mayors and the RTA Board for feedback in February. WeGo and the study team have engaged in on-going discussions with the freight operator to determine how any potential service changes might impact their operations and whether these can be accommodated under the current agreement.\n\nWith the recent announcement of a proposed transit referendum, the study team is coordinating with Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s office to determine how WeGo Star improvements may be impacted by any resulting referendum efforts. In the meantime, the team continues to further model and refine the potential short-term service option.\n\nThe next round of community meetings will be held along the corridor at the locations and times below:\n\nTuesday, July 16, 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., Fifty Forward, 108 Donelson Pike, Nashville, TN 37214\n\nWednesday, July 17, 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., City of Lebanon Administration Building, 200 North Castle Heights Ave., Lebanon, TN 37087\n\nThursday, July 18, 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., Mt. Juliet Community Center, 1075 Charlie Daniels Pkwy., Mount Juliet, TN 37122\n\nThe first round of public meetings were held at locations across the corridor in July of 2023.
