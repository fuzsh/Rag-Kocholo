        "text": "Strategies for Shippers & Logistics Professionals Rerouting Cargo in the Mid-Atlantic\n\nThe recent collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore has disrupted supply chains in the Mid-Atlantic region, severing a vital link to the bustling Port of Baltimore.\n\nIn this article, our team of experts offers practical insights and tips for shippers dealing with the impact on international freight shipments and drayage operations. We also discuss the importance of selecting the right third-party logistics provider (3PL) to help navigate these challenges.\n\nI have freight transiting through Baltimore – what is the first thing I should do?\n\nFirst and foremost, it is crucial to understand how your cargo that normally transits through Baltimore is being routed. Which ports are you rerouting to? Are your shipments being directed to nearby ports such as New York / New Jersey or Norfolk? Will you need to transload your freight?\n\nRemember: Even though your cargo may be destined for the Mid-Atlantic region, chassis will need to be returned to the port of entry and not the port of Baltimore (unless you have permission to return to an alternate port).\n\nKeep track of your containers to ensure a smooth transition and timely delivery. Being proactive and staying informed can help you mitigate further disruptions or issues.\n\nMake sure you understand your costs and keep track of them for any potential possible claims. Get everything in writing so you have proof and receipts in case any issues arise.\n\nInternational Shipments – What should I expect to deal with?\n\nAs expected, carriers are starting to invoke Force Majeure, meaning they will discharge at alternate ports and not be responsible for associated costs.\n\nSailing schedules are being adjusted for vessels en route and those not yet departed, expect this will continue for some time.\n\nExpect berthing delays at alternate ports, NY/NJ and Norfolk in particular.\n\nBe prepared to adjust shipping documents and Customs Entries to accommodate alternate ports of arrival.\n\nTrucking and Drayage Operations – What should I expect?\n\nTruck capacity will tighten as traditionally short-haul lanes transition to longer-haul regional runs due to diversions reducing the number of hauled loads per truck per day.\n\nPort/pier terminal and container depot congestion and wait time is expected to increase as diversions begin.\n\nReduced chassis availability is expected to impact congestion and capacity in these markets.\n\nCommunication to ocean carriers and chassis providers is encouraged to help mitigate potential charges and promote capacity fluidity as truckers move trucks from Baltimore to the diversion markets.\n\nHow do I quickly connect with a 3PL expert in the area?\n\nAlternate ports of call will be coordinated with the steamship line or NVOCC.\n\nYou’ll need to understand revised arrival timing and gather details of the freight you’ll move through alternate locations.\n\nDrayage costs, tolls, and timing will be different in alternate ports, understanding costs surrounding transload such as drayage will help with comparison. A 3PL option offering integrated drayage may offer more competitive costs and will help provide a more seamless invoicing experience.\n\nAsking within your network is a great place to start, the initial shipments will be urgent, and you’ll need a trusted partner, even if temporary.\n\nWhat should I look for in a temporary 3PL?\n\nLook for well-prepared subject matter experts who listen to your needs and are ready with solutions. Questions to ask potential partners:\n\nDoes the 3PL have a dedicated resource to support you, available when you need assistance?\n\nIs the facility a match for your needs and are they familiar with the type of work you’ll need performed?\n\nWhat, if any, certifications do you require and does the 3PL meet the necessary requirements?\n\nWhat is needed to get started – a credit application, delivery orders, freight details, etc.?\n\nBe prepared to discuss rates. You’ll need to understand not only the capabilities of the 3PL, but also the costs. Rates may look different across vendors, so it’s important to ask questions to confirm understanding.\n\nA prepared 3PL should be ready with a quick onboarding process to help make the last-minute transition seamless – what does that process look like?\n\nYou may not have time to visit the facility initially – can a same-day video conference call be set for a virtual face-to-face with the team and a video tour of the facility?\n\nI’ve selected my temporary 3PL solution, now what?\n\nYour temporary 3PL should be ready to arrange transload and processing of your freight (as well as drayage, if included).\n\nThe team supporting your account should maintain clear communication and provide timely & accurate invoicing.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nAs shippers and logistics professionals grapple with the fallout from the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, the road ahead remains uncertain but not insurmountable. By leveraging practical strategies and seeking out reliable third-party logistics partners, businesses can successfully navigate the challenges of disrupted supply chains and rerouted cargo flows.\n\nContributors: Bob Leef, SVP Commercial at CPG; TJ Frye, SVP Operations at CPG; Martin Karczewski, VP 3PL Solutions at UWL; and Brian Noonan, SVP at World Distribution Services contributed to this article.\n\nDive Deeper\n\nFor more information and updates on the situation in Baltimore, dive deeper into these resources:\n\nEast Coast ports say they are ready for Baltimore cargo (Supply Chain Dive)\n\nHow the Baltimore bridge disaster is impacting supply chains (Supply Chain Dive)\n\nBaltimore port closure presents unexpected challenges for mid-Atlantic trucking (JOC.com)\n\nBaltimore bridge collapse may cost billions, dramatically disrupt supply chains (FreightWaves)\n\nCranes move into place to remove Baltimore bridge debris (Splash247)\n\nTransportation & Transloading Solutions\n\nThe loss of the Francis Scott Key Bridge will be a complex challenge, with freight needing to be rerouted locally and across the Eastern seaboard.

Our close customer relationships allow us to deliver unique solutions combining our global logistics expertise, domestic warehouse and distribution platform with our customized technology platform.”\n\nWhen asked why he feels UWL has seen tremendous growth, Wright says: “One of the greatest keys to our success is our people, and the genuine heart at World Shipping. We have always operated as a customer centric organization, with unparalleled service at the local level. This a culture we are also pushing out into our regional expansion across the USA and we continue to operate as one company, not as a company of fragmented pieces.” UWL’s unique ethos is a driving force and will sustain them for many years to come.\n\nInnovation, client-centricity and a world-class team approach have defined the global 3PL NVOCC & freight forwarding company since its inception. The future for UWL is very bright, and the Cleveland-based company has seen tremendous growth over the last decade. UWL now has over 170 employees and continues to grow its team of supply chain professionals, working to stay one step ahead – WE’RE ON IT!\n\nSuccess metrics include:\n\nOffices across the U.S., Europe and Brazil\n\nFull Service, Licensed NVOCC\n\nLicensed & Bonded, Asset-Based Freight Forwarder\n\nOcean Freight (FLC & LCL)\n\nVessel Chartering Services\n\nAir Freight, IATA licensed\n\nCustoms House Brokerage\n\nGlobal Supply Chain Visibility\n\nNetwork of 8 owned and operated warehouses strategically located across the U.S\n\nRoad and Rail: Overweight Cargo Solutions, Domestic Truck Brokerage, FTL & LTL Services\n\nWarehousing & Distribution: Transloading, Nationwide Transportation Services, Heavy Lift & Out-of-Gauge Services, High Speed Crossdocking, Order Fulfillment\n\nBulk Liquid Logistics and its own, in-house FlexiTank product.\n\nAbout UWL\n\nUWL is a full service, asset-based global 3PL.

A customs house broker (CHB), is a critical service provided by logistics companies to ensure that import cargo is correctly cleared with US customs. They are licensed by the U.S. Treasury Department after passing a rigorous written examination and an extensive background investigation.\n\n“We are no longer just clearing traditional containerized imports and airfreight, but are now clearing the international bulk vessels coming into the Great Lakes today,” states Shannon Dillinger, licensed CHB at UWL. Dillinger, who offers 18 years of experience, utilizes her quality team of logistics professionals to remain competitive. “Where a traditional container vessel would require thousands of clearances, a single bulk vessel may only require a few or sometimes just one, if all the cargo is on one Bill of Lading. The main difference, however, is that you have to be on call 24 x 7 for these types of clearances and the vessels are not arriving in exact schedules like the liner vessels. This type of service takes on a whole new level for our brokerage team, as we now have to be a 24 x 7 operation.”\n\nIt is no surprise to observers that UWL would expand their comprehensive services, as World Shipping, Inc. has been in the vessel agency business for over 55 years and handles both saltwater and laker vessels in the Great Lakes. Jackie Csiszar, World Shipping’s Director-Vessel Operations, told us, “Today, we are the largest vessel agency in the U.S. and Great Lakes, with recent expansion into Lake Ontario, Canada. This new service allows the World Shipping Group of companies to expand our services to the customer. Our big advantage is that we work seamlessly internally, as we know the exact movement, berthing of the vessels and our customs brokerage team is just down the hall from my team, so we all work in unison.”\n\nWorld Shipping has continued to grow significantly in 2016 and has added many jobs locally at their corporate headquarters. Today, they are now the largest logistics company in the Cleveland area.\n\nCustoms House Brokerage business inquiries may be directed to Shannon Dillinger at s.dillinger@shipUWL.com or 440.895.8212.\n\nAbout UWL\n\nUWL is a full service, asset-based global 3PL.

There’s virtually no international logistics move that we can’t solve or perform with our group,” Hunger explains.\n\nThe typical World Shipping customer is focused on manufacturing and marketing products and needs a partner to provide shipping solutions. “They’re relying on us to provide a global, effective distribution system for them,” Hunger says of clients. World Shipping’s subsidiaries have offices in more than a dozen countries, allowing the company to provide customers with a local structure and to work closely with manufacturing clients to lessen the time it takes to deliver a product to market. “Our company has a proud history of providing world-class customer service. We now look to build on that legacy with key investments in technology and skin in the game in terms of assets to service clients,” Hunger adds. “[We are] growing globally while maintaining our continued focus on service and quality.”\n\nFred Hunger’s father, Jack Hunger, founded World Shipping in 1960 following the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway the year before. The series of canals and locks made the Atlantic Ocean accessible to Great Lakes communities and provided business opportunities for logistics companies, such as World Shipping, to coordinate the rising delivery of goods to the region. By the 1960s, containers had become a more significant part of the shipping industry and World Shipping transitioned its business to liner agents for steam ships to enter the global trade market. “Over time we have grown strategically into a complete international logistics company,” Hunger says.\n\nRead more below.\n\nCLEVELAND, OH (November 11th, 2015) – World Shipping, Inc. honored local veterans during a ceremony and celebration on Wednesday, November 11th, 2015 at 11:00am.
