        "text": "1 The 6-month introductory interest rate of 5.035% (5.15% Annual Percentage Yield [APY]) is available on new Market Monitor (money market) accounts opened between July 17 and August 31, 2024 with a minimum opening deposit of $10,000 in new money. New money is defined as funds not currently on deposit at Old National as of July 16, 2024. If the account is not funded with $10,000 in new money within 15 calendar days of account opening the promotional rate will be removed and standard market rates will apply. Rates and tiers for balances during the 6-month promotional period are: 5.035% (5.15% APY) if daily collected balance is $10,000 or more; 0.05% (0.05% APY) if daily collected balance is $9,999 or less. After the introductory term expires, rates will match the standard rate chart in effect at that time. For interest-bearing accounts, the interest rate and annual percentage yield (APY) may change periodically at our discretion. Interest begins to accrue no later than the business day we receive credit (collected funds) for the deposit of noncash items (for example checks). If account is closed within 180 days, a $25 fee will be assessed. Fees may reduce earnings on the account. If the account is closed before interest is credited, you will not receive the accrued interest. Market Monitor is a personal deposit account. This offer applies to personal accounts and personal trusts only; it is not available for business, public or institutional deposit funds. Personal trusts can only be opened in an Old National banking center. Old National reserves the right to extend or discontinue this offer at any time. We may refuse or return any deposit amount causing the combined balance of all your Old National accounts to exceed $3,000,000.\n\n2 Minimum deposit of $500 required to open. Rates, terms, and conditions accurate as of August 6, 2024, and are subject to change. Advertised interest rate of 4.91% (5.00% Annual Percentage Yield (APY)) is for a new 5-month certificate of deposit (CD) with balances of $500 or more. CD rates are fixed upon opening the account. APYs assume money stays on deposit until CD maturity date. An early withdrawal penalty may be assessed and may decrease earnings. If you close the account before interest is credited, you will not receive the accrued interest. Upon maturity the CD will automatically renew for a successive term equal to the original term at the standard rate/APY in effect on the maturity date and based on the same term, minimum balance, and other features of the original certificate. Public funds, institutional funds and brokered CDs are not eligible for advertised APYs.\n\n3 Rates, terms, and conditions effective 3/1/2024 for applications received through 9/30/2024. Subject to credit approval. Property insurance is required for all loans secured by real estate. Rates are subject to change daily. Contact your Old National Banker or Residential Lender for current loan rates. NMLS #459308. Other restrictions may apply, see bank for details. The line of credit has a draw period of 10 years, after which you will no longer have access to borrow funds and will be required to repay the borrowed balance within a 20-year term. During the draw period there is an introductory variable rate discount in effect for the first 6 billing cycles, based on a 1.50% discount resulting in an APR of 1.65% below the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal. After the introductory period expires, the variable rate for the account will be based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate (plus or minus a margin) which is currently 8.10%. During the repayment period the rate will be fixed based on the rate at the end of the draw period plus a margin which is currently 3.00%. APR examples provided above are based on the highest credit tier with an LTV of 60% or less and includes an optional 0.25% rate reduction available at origination for enrolling in automatic loan payments drawn from an ONB checking account. ONB associates may select the associate discount or Private Banking discount, not both, in addition to the promotional discount. Maximum APR is 21%, minimum APR is 0.99%. The initial $50 annual fee is waived. During the draw period the minimum monthly payment will be equal to the interest that accrued on the outstanding balance during the preceding billing cycle or $50, whichever is greater. During the repayment period the minimum monthly payment will be based on the balance at the end of the draw period amortized over 20 years or $50, whichever is greater. If you close or refinance your line of credit within 3 years, a Reimbursement fee will be assessed for the lesser of $300 or the amount paid to third parties to recover the closing costs paid on your behalf plus, in MN, the Mortgage Registry Tax (MRT) or Deed Stamp Tax paid on your behalf where applicable. Old National reserves the right to extend or discontinue this offer at any time. Equity Access Cards are not available to Kentucky residents.\n\n“Old National,” “Old National Bank,” “Old National Bancorp,” “ONB” and the Old National logo are registered trademarks of Old National Bancorp."
