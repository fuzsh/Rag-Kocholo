        "text": "Metro Water Services’ Cross Connection Control Program protects our community’s drinking water supply by preventing backflow contamination.\n\nBackflow can occur when a change in pressure in the water system causes water in the pipes to flow in the reverse direction. This change in pressure has the potential to pull contaminants into the drinking water distribution system.\n\nA cross-connection can occur when non-drinking water is unintentionally able to mix with drinking water.\n\nOur Cross Connection Control Program regulates and inspects both commercial and residential buildings for conditions that could put our community’s drinking water system at risk for contamination.\n\nYour participation in the Cross Connection Control Plan is critical in helping MWS protect the public water system from cross contamination and ensure safe drinking water for all its customers. Thank you for your efforts.\n\nRequired Annual Inspections\n\nIn order to meet state requirements, every backflow device must be inspected by Metro Water Services or our contractor annually. We schedule inspections geographically.\n\nAnnual Inspection Cost\n\nEach inspection costs $42* per device during normal business hours.\n\nAdditional charges will be applied for after-hour inspections.\n\nBackflow inspection charges will appear on your water bill.\n\nFailed inspections\n\nIf the backflow assembly fails inspection, we give the customer a timeline to address the issue.\n\nThe timeline will range from immediate disconnection to ninety days, depending on the level of hazard.\n\nRe-test visits will continue until the customer has taken all corrective action to ensure backflow protection.\n\nCustomers will be charged $42* for each re-test.\n\n*Price subject to change.\n\nCommercial Backflow Requirements and Inspections\n\nMetro Water Services inspects commercial locations and classifies them as either high hazard or low hazard.\n\nDepending on the level of hazard, Metro Water Services may require\n\nimmediate protection,\n\nimmediate disconnection,\n\nor customers may be given a certain amount of time to comply with regulations.\n\nHigh-hazard commercial locations\n\nExamples: restaurants, medical facilities, automotive industries, multi-story buildings, and multi-unit apartment complexes.\n\nHigh-hazard locations require backflow prevention measures.\n\nMetro Water Services will inspect and test the backflow device every twelve months.\n\nFor more examples of hazardous connections, see pages 9-10 of the Cross Connection Control Plan.\n\nLow Hazard commercial locations\n\nExamples: single-story buildings with no connection to an ice maker or any other device directly connected to a domestic water line. These locations could include a bank branch, an accounting office, a lawyers’ office.\n\nMetro Water Services will visit commercial locations that do not require a backflow device a minimum of once every five years. During this visit, we will determine if any new conditions exist that require a backflow device.\n\nResidential Backflow Requirements and Inspections\n\nPotential cross connections concerns at homes include:\n\nswimming pools,\n\nhot tubs, and jacuzzis,\n\nalternative water sources,\n\nunderground irrigation systems,\n\nfire protection systems.\n\nAny residence where a cross connection exists will be required to use proper backflow prevention measures. Metro Water Services will inspect and test the backflow device every twelve months.\n\nNote: Buildings with three or more units (i.e. triplex or apartment complex) are considered commercial properties.\n\nInstallation of Backflow Devices\n\nAll new units being installed in Tennessee for the protection of a public water system should be included on the latest listing of “Approved Backflow Prevention Assemblies” maintained by the University of Southern California Standards. This list is available through the Division of Water 25 Supply or the Fleming Training Center. The contact numbers to receive an approved list are 615- 532-9199 (Division of Water Supply) or 615-898-8090 (Fleming Training Center).\n\nUniversity of Southern California specifications.\n\nLocation of Backflow Devices\n\nBackflow prevention devices should be placed directly behind the meter so that any connections are past the backflow and therefore protected.\n\nAny other location will require a variance approved by Metro Water Services Variance Committee. If you would like to request a variance, please see the Minimum Variance Requirements and Variance Request Form.\n\nIf your device must be placed inside a building and its location has been approved by the MWS Variance Committee, it must be placed in an area with:\n\n7 feet head clearance\n\nProper lighting\n\nEasy accessibility\n\n3 feet clearance in front of device\n\nAll backflow devices must be placed in the same room, and the location of the room must be at a point of closest proximity to the meter.\n\nIf an existing backflow device requires replacement, it must be relocated to meet current Metro Water Services standards for installation and access requirements. This would apply to any \"grandfathered\" installation of a backflow device which had previously been inspected by MWS. Any remodeling project to the premises that adversely effects the access to the mainline backflow device would not be permitted and result in enforcement action for the customer connection.\n\nFire Service Installation Requirements\n\nIf more than twenty feet exists between the backflow prevention device and active water, an automatic flusher device must be installed to clear the water out of the water line periodically.\n\nFor a fire service, a backflow device can be put in vertically or horizontally.\n\nDomestic Service Installation Requirements\n\nFor a domestic service (water lines connected to bathrooms, kitchens) a backflow device must be put in horizontally.\n\nAdditional Installation Information\n\nDetails and drawings for various backflow device requirements\n\nMore information regarding the approval of new installations can be found on pages 7 and 8 of the Cross Connection Control Plan.\n\nBackflow Reports Search\n\nSearch Backflow Reports\n\nContact Information\n\n[email protected]\n\n615-862-4872\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIf I have a single family home, do I need a backflow device?\n\nGenerally, no, unless you have a fire or irrigation system connected to your water service. (Multi-story homes may require an assembly if backpressure creates an issue in the public water system.)\n\nHow do I know if I need a backflow prevention device?\n\nWhether or not you’ll need a backflow device is dependent on the level of hazard posed to the public water system. This is explained briefly with some examples under the New Development header above, but more information can be found on pages 9-10 of the Cross Connection Control Plan. For specific questions, contact [email protected], 615-862-4872.\n\nWhat type of materials can I use for my backflow device?\n\nCopper, brass, and ductile iron are acceptable materials approved by Metro Water Services. Anything currently not approved can be submitted to our approved materials list committee for possible acceptance.\n\nIf developing a duplex house, do I need a backflow device?\n\nDuplex homes are not considered commercial and therefore do not require a backflow assembly unless there is a fire sprinkler system or irrigation. However, buildings with three or more units are considered commercial and require a device. Additionally, buildings with more than two stories also require a device.\n\nWhat should I do if I think I see someone illegally hooking up to a fire hydrant?\n\nContact Metro Water Services at 615-862-4600."
