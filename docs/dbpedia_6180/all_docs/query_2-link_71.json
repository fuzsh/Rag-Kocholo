Please click HERE for full message.\n\nRaising the Flag on Iwo Jima by Joe Rosenthal / The Associated Press\n\nVeterans Day originated as \"Armistice Day\" on Nov. 11, 1919, the first anniversary of the end of World War I on the 11th hour of the 11th day in the 11th month in 1918. Congress passed a resolution in 1926 for an annual observance, and Nov. 11 became a national holiday beginning in 1938. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation in 1954 to change the name to Veterans Day as a way to honor those who served in all American wars. The day honors living military veterans with parades and speeches across the nation. A national ceremony takes place at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\n\nEmployment Law Roadshow Series November 5 2013\n\nChattanooga, Tennessee\n\nClick Here to RSVP http://tinyurl.com/kb3yq9u\n\nWaller and the NAHCC have partnered to host a series of employment law seminars across the state.

The NAHCC commends the leadership of Tennesseans for Immigration Reform in support of bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nThere are an estimated 11 million undocumented workers currently in the U.S. Without fear of deportation or prosecution, these individuals, if authorized to work or start a business, can help boost our American economy. More importantly, comprehensive immigration reform promises an end to the underground U.S. labor market in undocumented immigrants and will allow U.S. businesses to safely and reliably meet their labor demands.\n\nThe Latino community is united in wanting to fix our nation’s broken immigration policies. With 38 percent of Hispanics in the U.S. being foreign-born, this is an issue that impacts us, our families, and our neighbors.\n\n“Comprehensive immigration reform is long overdue as it compromises the economic growth potential and prosperity of our nation if not addressed in an expeditious matter. And it is good for business, as it facilitates a pathway for compliance and new opportunities for immigrant workers who are filling a critical gap in the U.S. workforce” says Yuri Cunza, NAHCC President and CEO.\n\nBy presenting a unified front with a single voice, business, civic and community leaders from across Tennessee can play a critical role in our national debate as we take the necessary steps to resolve this issue.\n\n\"As the chair of the Nashville Area Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, I support the growing movement and voices for immigration reform. Let’s continue working together towards that goal\" said Mario Ramos, NAHCC chairman.\n\nThe NAHCC is committed to promoting the economic development of our region and to continue fostering the intrinsic leadership potential of Hispanic entrepreneurs in Tennessee. Hispanic owned businesses are the fastest growing population of American business enterprises and are at the forefront of our nation's economic growth. Hispanic communities have an entrepreneurial spirit and lead the nation in small business start ups, presenting a potential source for future innovation, and job creation.

Each was a loss to our community and nation.\n\nToday, we must remember those that are not longer with us, our family members, neighbors, and friends who have offered the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nToday let us remember with gratitude and pride all those who served to protect our country, our freedom and the ideals that, despite our origin, unify us as a nation.....'One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all'.\n\n\"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\" -John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 - Nov. 22, 1963) 35th President of the United States.\n\nOn behalf of the NAHCC Board of Directors,\n\nYuri Cunza\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nNashville Are Hispanic Chamber of Commerce\n\nNAHCC Business After Hour Event\n\nWednesday June 2, 2010\n\n5:30 PM to 7:30 PM\n\nEnjoy Delicious Chef prepared Tacos, Shrimp Shooters, Margaritas and Chips With Homemade Salsa Bar.
