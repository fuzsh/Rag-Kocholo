Our EDM records data every 15 minutes. A “spill” is\n\ntriggered when the first 15-minute reading detects a discharge. The first\n\n“spill” in an event can be any number of readings within that first\n\n12-hour period after the first discharge is detected. Any subsequent\n\n“spill number” in an event is measured over the next, and any further\n\n24-hour period. Again, the “spill” can be any number of readings within\n\nthat period after the first discharge is detected. Column H in the “EDM\n\nSpill Block Data” tab gives the number of 15-minute reading within the\n\nindividual “spill” that were over the spill point.\n\nIncluding the volumes that were discharged in each event:\n\nWe do not record discharge volumes. Our EDM monitoring only records the\n\nnumber and duration of spill events and does not record the volume of a\n\nspill event.\n\nWe hope that this response is clear. Should you have any questions, please\n\ncontact us by email at [1][email address]\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the handling of your request, you have the\n\nright to ask for an internal review. Internal review requests should be\n\nsubmitted within 40 working days of the date of receipt of this response\n\nand should be addressed to Company Secretary, Linea, Fortran Road, St\n\nMellons, Cardiff CF3 0LT\n\nIf you are not content with the outcome of the internal review, you have\n\nthe right to apply directly to the Information Commissioner for a\n\ndecision.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDŵr Cymru Welsh Water\n\n_______________________________________________________ Dwr Cymru Welsh\n\nWater is firmly committed to water conservation and promoting water\n\nefficiency.
