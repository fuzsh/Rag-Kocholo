        "text": "Benefits to Work is now proud to be…WorkAbleTN.\n\nFor over 20 years, our team of qualified and experienced professionals have been showing Tennesseans with disabilities how they can make more money through working, all while taking the fear out of the benefits process.\n\nSince our original grant in 2000, the counselors at Benefits to Work have helped tens of thousands of individual Tennesseans better understand their possibilities, and welcomed thousands more to our group presentations held across the state.\n\nWe’re proud of the success the Benefits to Work program has accomplished, but our work is so much more.\n\nIt’s not just about understanding your benefits. And it’s not just about working. It’s about a passion for possibilities. It’s about independence, community, and helping clients not only understand their options, but gaining the confidence to advocate for their needs, and make their own choices.\n\nWhile understanding benefits and work options are crucial, our work is about providing clients with workable solutions to make their own decisions. With the clients’ best interest in mind, we help Tennesseans with disabilities understand how working could make sense for them, and improve their quality of life.\n\nOur personable, knowledgeable staff will help you understand your possibilities, keeping you in the driver’s seat of your choices, and your life. If knowledge is power, WorkAbleTN is a powerful partner.\n\nWith a passion for possibilities, WorkAbleTN helps clients think creatively about ways to do more than just get by. We’ll guide you to the right resources, and help you learn to successfully self-advocate for what you need - no matter where you are on your journey.\n\nWe’re more than benefits. And we’re more than work.\n\nWe are WorkAbleTN.\n\nWhat We Do:\n\nWorkAbleTN offers confidential one-on-one benefits counseling to empower you to make choices about your goals and chosen lifestyle. We provide information about how working may (or may not) impact your benefits. We have a passion for possibilities and will think creatively with you about ways to do more than just get by. WorkAbleTN will guide you to appropriate resources and help boost your confidence to advocate for what you want. Come to us with questions about working and we’ll brainstorm with you. We will be with you step by step on your journey.\n\nWhy Work?\n\nIndividuals with disabilities can make more money, find economic stability, purpose, meaning, and fulfillment through working. It’s not only about finding a job. It’s about self-empowerment, gaining independence and building relationships in the community.\n\nWhy Work With Us?\n\nWe provide accurate information based upon extensive training and decades of experience. We make this complex process easier and help you make decisions to avoid problems with your benefits.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nAlice L. Owens, J.D., Program Director\n\nPhone: (615) 383-9442\n\nToll-Free: 1 (888) 639-7811"
