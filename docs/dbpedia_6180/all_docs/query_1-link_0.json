        "text": "Incentives for a relocation or expansion project in the region come from three sources: the State of Tennessee, Tennessee Valley Authority, and the local community. The evaluation process is based on a variety of economic factors including capital investment, new jobs created, wages, etc. A qualified business that creates at least 25 net, new jobs and invests at least $500,000 in a 36 month period may qualify for an incentive package. Based on the project, the incentives could include job tax credits, infrastructure/training assistance, energy credits, low cost loans and grants, tax abatement (PILOT) or others.\n\nElectric power for the Nashville region is provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority and local distributors. TVA is the nation’s largest government-owned power provider, supplying energy needs to approximately 10 million people throughout Tennessee and six other southeastern states.\n\nTVA power is one of the most efficient and reliable systems in the country, offering numerous advantages to businesses and industry.
