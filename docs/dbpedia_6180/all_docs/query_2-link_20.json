        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn., Aug. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE: BKD) (\"Brookdale\" or the \"Company\") announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nSecond quarter consolidated revenue per available unit (RevPAR) increased 6.4% over the prior year quarter.\n\nSecond quarter consolidated weighted average occupancy grew 160 basis points over the prior year quarter representing a continuation of better than pre-pandemic growth trends.\n\nSame community operating margin, when excluding prior period grant income, increased 160 basis points over the prior year second quarter on 6.0% revenue growth and 3.6% facility operating expense growth.\n\nDelivered meaningful improvements in both leadership retention and associate turnover.\n\n\"Thanks to our incredible leadership teams and passionate associates, we are making meaningful progress in key areas that support the ongoing and future success of our communities,\" said Lucinda (\"Cindy\") Baier, Brookdale's President and CEO. \"We have demonstrated powerful positive progress toward full recovery from the impact of the pandemic, and with each quarter, we have and are continuing to deliver sustainable growth while building a significant runway for future revenue and operating income increases. Through careful and deliberate decisions and focused execution, we are strengthening Brookdale's foundation to create lasting benefits for our residents, associates, and shareholders for decades to come.\"\n\nSUMMARY OF SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nConsolidated summary of operating results and metrics:\n\nSame community(2) summary of operating results and metrics:\n\nRecent consolidated occupancy trend:\n\nOVERVIEW OF SECOND QUARTER RESULTS\n\nResident fees.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 2Q 2023:\n\nResident fees increased primarily due to the increases in RevPOR and occupancy, partially offset by the disposition of communities, primarily through lease terminations, since the beginning of the prior year period, which resulted in $14.4 million less in resident fees during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe increase in RevPOR was primarily the result of annual in-place rate increases effective January 1, 2024.\n\nThe increase in occupancy primarily reflects the impact of the Company's execution on key initiatives to rebuild occupancy lost due to the pandemic.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 1Q 2024:\n\nResident fees decreased primarily due to the decrease in RevPOR, due to an occupancy mix shift to more independent living residents and lower skilled nursing revenue, and the disposition of owned communities since the beginning of the prior period, which resulted in $1.6 million less in resident fees during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe decrease was partially offset by the 20 basis point increase in weighted average occupancy, an improvement from normal pre-pandemic seasonality trends.\n\nFacility operating expense.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 2Q 2023:\n\nThe increase in facility operating expense was primarily due to broad inflationary pressure and an increase in estimated insurance expense.\n\nThese increases were partially offset by the disposition of communities since the beginning of the prior year period, which resulted in $12.8 million less in facility operating expense during the second quarter of 2024, and by a decrease in the use of premium labor, primarily contract labor, and a decrease in estimated incentive compensation costs.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 1Q 2024:\n\nThe decrease in facility operating expense was primarily due to decreases in property repair expense primarily as a result of severe weather events in the prior period.\n\nAdditionally, the disposition of communities since the beginning of the prior period resulted in $1.5 million less in facility operating expense during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nCash facility operating lease payments: The increase compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a change in classification of lease payments as cash facility operating lease payments as a result of lease amendments in the prior year period.\n\nNet income (loss).\n\n2Q 2024 vs 2Q 2023: The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $36.3 million gain on sale of communities, net recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2023 for the sale of the Company's one remaining entrance fee community and the increase in facility operating expense, partially offset by the increase in resident fees.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 1Q 2024: The increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of interest rate derivatives in the prior period and a decrease in property insurance recoveries.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: The increase compared to the second quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the increase in resident fees partially offset by the increase in facility operating expense, a $4.1 million decrease in other operating income for state government grants recognized during the prior year period, and the change in classification of $2.5 million of lease payments for 35 communities as cash facility operating lease payments as a result of lease amendments in the prior year period.\n\nLIQUIDITY\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 2Q 2023: The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash received associated with government grants and credits, other changes in working capital, and the increase in facility operating expense, partially offset by the increase in resident fees.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 1Q 2024: The change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily due to decreases in payments under the Company's annual and long-term incentive compensation programs and annual insurance premium payments made in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nNon-development capital expenditures, net: The decrease compared to the second quarter of 2023 in non-development capital expenditures, net of lessor reimbursements, was primarily due to a decrease in remediation costs at the Company's communities resulting from natural disasters.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 2Q 2023: The change in Adjusted Free Cash Flow was primarily due to the decrease in non-development capital expenditures, net, partially offset by the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in property insurance proceeds.\n\n2Q 2024 vs 1Q 2024: The change in Adjusted Free Cash Flow was primarily due to the change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, excluding $30.9 million of changes in prepaid property insurance premiums financed with notes payable, partially offset by a decrease in property insurance proceeds.\n\nTotal liquidity. Total liquidity of $345.8 million as of June 30, 2024 included $290.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $19.7 million of marketable securities, and $36.1 million of availability on the Company's secured credit facility. Total liquidity as of June 30, 2024 decreased $9.2 million from March 31, 2024, primarily due to repayments of $9.7 million of mortgage debt and negative Adjusted Free Cash Flow, partially offset by $6.2 million of net proceeds from the sale of three communities.\n\nTRANSACTION UPDATE\n\nSubsequent to the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company and Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (\"Omega\") amended the existing master lease pursuant to which the Company continues to lease 24 communities (2,555 units) from Omega. The Company's amended master lease has an initial term to expire on December 31, 2037. As part of the amendment, Omega agreed to make available up to $80.0 million to fund costs associated with capital expenditures for the communities through December 31, 2037. The annual rent under the lease will not be adjusted upon reimbursements for capital expenditures in the aggregate amount of up to $30.0 million of the $80.0 million pool, which is available in certain tranches through June 30, 2028. With respect to the remaining $50.0 million of the $80.0 million pool, the annual rent under the lease will prospectively increase by the amount of each reimbursement multiplied by 9.5%. The $50.0 million will be available in certain tranches beginning January 1, 2025, subject to certain annual reimbursement caps specified in the lease. Under the terms of the amendment, rent will escalate annually per the terms of the existing lease escalator, with a potential minor contingent rent adjustment beginning in 2028 depending on lease performance.\n\n2024 OUTLOOK\n\nFor the third quarter 2024, the Company is providing the following guidance:\n\nIn the aggregate, the Company expects its full-year 2024 non-development capital expenditures, net of anticipated lessor reimbursements, to be approximately $180.0 million.\n\nThis guidance excludes future acquisition or disposition activity. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure included in the foregoing guidance to the most comparable GAAP financial measure is not available without unreasonable effort due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the timing or amounts of items required to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA from the Company's net income (loss). Variability in the timing or amounts of items required to reconcile the measure may have a significant impact on the Company's future GAAP results.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\nThe Company will post on its website at brookdaleinvestors.com supplemental information relating to the Company's second quarter results, an updated investor presentation, and a copy of this earnings release. The supplemental information and a copy of this earnings release will also be furnished in a Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC.\n\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\n\nBrookdale's management will conduct a conference call to discuss the financial results for the second quarter on August 9, 2024 at 9:00 AM ET.

Presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to aid investors in better understanding the factors and trends affecting the Company's performance and liquidity. However, investors should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, including net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. The Company cautions investors that amounts presented in accordance with the Company's definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner. The Company urges investors to review the following reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures from the most comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP performance measure that the Company defines as net income (loss) excluding: benefit/provision for income taxes, non-operating income/expense items, and depreciation and amortization; and further adjusted to exclude income/expense associated with non-cash, non-operational, transactional, cost reduction, or organizational restructuring items that management does not consider as part of the Company's underlying core operating performance and that management believes impact the comparability of performance between periods. For the periods presented herein, such other items include non-cash impairment charges, operating lease expense adjustment, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and transaction and organizational restructuring costs. Transaction costs include those directly related to acquisition, disposition, financing, and leasing activity, and are primarily comprised of legal, finance, consulting, professional fees, and other third-party costs. Organizational restructuring costs include those related to the Company's efforts to reduce general and administrative expense and its senior leadership changes, including severance.\n\nThe Company believes that presentation of Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure is useful to investors because (i) it is one of the metrics used by the Company's management for budgeting and other planning purposes, to review the Company's historic and prospective core operating performance, and to make day-to-day operating decisions; (ii) it provides an assessment of operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely revenues and the controllable cost structure of the organization, by eliminating items related to the Company's financing and capital structure and other items that management does not consider as part of the Company's underlying core operating performance and that management believes impact the comparability of performance between periods; (iii) the Company believes that this measure is used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the Company's operating results and to value companies in its industry; and (iv) the Company uses the measure for components of executive compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has material limitations as a performance measure, including: (i) excluded interest and income tax are necessary to operate the Company's business under its current financing and capital structure; (ii) excluded depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges may represent the wear and tear and/or reduction in value of the Company's communities, goodwill, and other assets and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures; and (iii) the Company may incur income/expense similar to those for which adjustments are made, such as gain/loss on sale of assets, facility operating lease termination, or debt modification and extinguishment, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and transaction and other costs, and such income/expense may significantly affect the Company's operating results.\n\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA from net income (loss).\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that the Company defines as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before: distributions from unconsolidated ventures from cumulative share of net earnings, changes in prepaid insurance premiums financed with notes payable, changes in operating lease assets and liabilities for lease termination, cash paid/received for gain/loss on facility operating lease termination, and lessor capital expenditure reimbursements under operating leases; plus: property and casualty insurance proceeds and proceeds from refundable entrance fees, net of refunds; less: non-development capital expenditures and payment of financing lease obligations. Non-development capital expenditures are comprised of corporate and community-level capital expenditures, including those related to maintenance, renovations, upgrades, and other major building infrastructure projects for the Company's communities and is presented net of lessor reimbursements. Non-development capital expenditures do not include capital expenditures for: community expansions, major community redevelopment and repositioning projects, and the development of new communities.\n\nThe Company believes that presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure is useful to investors because (i) it is one of the metrics used by the Company's management for budgeting and other planning purposes, to review the Company's historic and prospective sources of operating liquidity, and to review the Company's ability to service its outstanding indebtedness, pay dividends to stockholders, engage in share repurchases, and make capital expenditures, including development capital expenditures; and (ii) it provides an indicator to management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow has material limitations as a liquidity measure, including: (i) it does not represent cash available for dividends, share repurchases, or discretionary expenditures since certain non-discretionary expenditures, including mandatory debt principal payments, are not reflected in this measure; (ii) the cash portion of non-recurring charges related to gain/loss on facility lease termination generally represent charges/gains that may significantly affect the Company's liquidity; and (iii) the impact of timing of cash expenditures, including the timing of non-development capital expenditures, limits the usefulness of the measure for short-term comparisons.\n\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted Free Cash Flow from net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\n\nSOURCE Brookdale Senior Living Inc."
