Think again.\n\n0:44 Being golden is about putting in the hard work.\n\n0:50 It’s a rallying cry to believe in yourself.\n\n0:58 It’s searching for answers where others aren't looking.\n\n1:02 Rising before the sun, and staying up long after it sets.\n\n1:09 Launching technology and stepping into a new world.\n\n1:17 It's about balance, and making time to experience life.\n\n1:25 It’s defying expectations\n\n1:27 and making people look twice.\n\n1:33 At Oakland University, our students power Michigan.\n\n1:39 They get internships and jobs locally\n\n1:42 and give back to their community.\n\n1:50 Our nurses care for you when you’re sick.\n\n1:55 Our engineers drive the motor city into the future.\n\n1:58 Our business leaders propel the economy.\n\n2:03 Our educators teach your children,\n\n2:06 and inspire the next generation.\n\n2:11 We’re moving forward, but remembering where we came from."
