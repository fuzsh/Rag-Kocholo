        "text": "The Challenge\n\nFor many children, the path to adulthood is rough. Right now, more than 435,000 children are growing up in foster homes; 120,000 have been permanently separated from their parents and are waiting for adoption; 20,000 will turn 18 and “age out” without family support. We have a responsibility to do better. Preserving and strengthening families can allow children to grow up safely in their own homes without the trauma of family separation, and effective services can be the bridge to adulthood for young people who leave foster care alone.\n\nOur Approach\n\nDecades of experience and research have taught us this: a family does a better job of raising a child than the state. We provide and advocate for innovative, evidence-based, family-focused services designed to bring help and hope to children and their families, as well as proven services for young adults turning 18 in foster care.\n\nOur Impact\n\nWe’re changing the lives of thousands of children, families and young people every year through our direct services and partnerships with organizations and agencies around the country. Our work is to transform children’s systems, deepen our impact and deliver better results one child and one family at a time."
