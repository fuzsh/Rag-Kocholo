        "text": "In 2023, Atlanta-based Arrow Exterminators was recognized as a top workplace in Atlanta for the 6th year in a row by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Not only was Arrow ranked as a top workplace, but they received the distinguished honor of the #1 Top Workplace in Atlanta in the Large Companies category. Additionally, Arrow was named the #4 Top Workplace in the United States for the second year in a row in the largest category, companies with 2,500+ employees.\n\nThe Top Workplaces Award is based solely on team member feedback gathered through a third-party survey administered by Energage LLC. The survey measures several aspects of a workplace culture including alignment, execution, and connection, just to name a few. “Arrow Exterminators has a unique family-focused, entrepreneurial culture that is based on integrity and operating with transparency and a clear conscience,” said Shay Runion, Chief Human Resources Officer of Arrow Exterminators. “We want to partner with like-minded team members who are also focused on growth, who share our goals and principles, and our family culture. As our vision states, we want to hire, train, and retain the best people and we know that the Top Workplaces distinction will help propel our recruiting efforts, and further strengthen our presence in the Atlanta Metro Area.”\n\nAnother prestigious honor was awarded to Arrow’s Chief Executive Officer, Emily Thomas Kendrick, who received the Top Leadership Award in the large company category by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. This distinction not only highlights Kendrick's exceptional leadership, but also celebrates Arrow Exterminators' achievement as the #1 Top Workplace in Atlanta. Kendrick stated, “I am truly honored by this accomplishment, and I want to emphasize that it's a collective effort. This achievement is a testament to the entire leadership team at Arrow and the remarkable dedication of our 3,300+ Rock Stars who consistently excel day in and day out. They are an exceptional group of individuals, demonstrating unparalleled hard work and commitment. Their embodiment of true servant leadership is a constant source of inspiration for me, and I share this victory with all of them.”\n\nIn early August, Arrow Exterminators hosted its annual Fiscal Year Summit in Atlanta, GA, with more than 500 team members and partners in attendance. The event celebrated the company's impressive accomplishments from the previous fiscal year, including record-breaking achievements such as 13 consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth and surpassing $380 million in revenue. The summit also introduced the new internal fiscal year theme, “Culture Rules”.\n\nOver the past year, Arrow Exterminators has expanded into many different markets in the United States. The strategic mergers included Hutto Pest Services in northeast Austin, TX, Ideal Pest Solutions, LLC in Winter Garden, FL, and City Green Environmental, LLC in Fort Myers, Florida. In addition to the aforementioned mergers, Arrow also opened six additional offices in the following cities/areas to better support customers in those areas: NE Georgia, Eatonton, GA, Fayetteville, GA, North Florida, Nashville, TN, and Orlando, FL.\n\n“We are excited for the phenomenal growth we have seen in 2023. These new locations contribute to Arrow’s list of 176 service centers throughout the United States and is strategic to our growth objective of $400 million and beyond,” said Tim Pollard, President and Chief Operating Officer. “We eagerly anticipate what lies ahead in 2024.”\n\nArrow's growth initiatives also led to internal promotions within the Leadership team. In 2023, Mark Cassell was promoted to Senior Vice President of Operations, Glenn Glover to Vice President of Sales, and Lee Binns and Dave Massey both ascended to the position of Regional Vice President of Operations for their respective regions. These developments position Arrow Exterminators for a promising future in 2024 and beyond."
