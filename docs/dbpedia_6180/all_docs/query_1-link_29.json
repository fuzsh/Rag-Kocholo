        "text": "+ What does my adoption fee include?\n\nYour $450 adoption fee includes spay/neuter, microchip, and vaccines current to the age of the dog/puppy. We offer a $50 training reimbursement with proof of training when completed within the first six months of adoption.\n\n+ Do you adopt out of state?\n\nWe do! We require out of state adopters to travel to Nashville to meet and pick up their pup. We Understand that's tricky and may be a deal breaker for most.\n\n+ How long does the process take?\n\nIt varies depending on the dog and the amount of applications our team has to review. The first step in the process is to submit an online application, which is non-binding. After that we'll coordinate a phone or in-person interview, and set up a meet and greet at our Adoption Center. We are typically able to process applications within a week of completion so we advise people to apply once they know they're ready to take home that same week.\n\n+ Can you hold a dog for me?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot hold dogs. We plan meet and greets based on when the applications arrive. If you are interested in a dog, fill out the application right away. If we are having an adoption event, arrive early for the best chance to adopt. The same is true at our Adoption Center.\n\n+ Do you offer a trial period?\n\nWe don't offer trials. As a primarily foster-based organization, we do our best to keep transitions to a minimum for the dogs. It's in their best interest to have a stable environment and we try to avoid bouncing them around so they have consistency and routine. We offer meet and greets as the final step of the adoption process so applicants can meet and spend time with the dog of interest.\n\n+ Do you offer discounted rates?\n\nWe do not offer discounted adoption rates. We are a nonprofit organization and our adoption fees go directly towards saving more dogs in need. We have large medical bills, training, food, and other costs that add up. Each rescued dog costs us an average of $500.\n\n+ How long does it take to hear back?\n\nWe receive a high number of emails daily and do our best to respond to them as quickly as we can. We will be in touch as soon as possible and aim to respond within 1-3 business days.\n\n+ I've applied in the past, do I have to re-apply?\n\nIf you've submitted an application within the past six months, you can email adoptnash@wagsandwalks.org stating that you've submitted an application in the past. Please be sure to note the name of the dog you'd like to potentially adopt and one of our counselors will be in touch via email.\n\n+ I recently applied but haven't heard anything. How do I follow up?\n\nSometimes our emails go to Spam folders, be sure to check there to make sure there's not any missed communication. If you've completed an application and haven't heard from our team after three days, you can inquire about the status at adoptnash@wagsandwalks.org.\n\n+ Do you know the history of my dog?\n\nUnfortunately, many dogs that we save entered the shelter as strays or were surrendered by their owners with little or no information. We do our best to include any information about their history in their profile if it is known. Otherwise, we will always share information about their personalities, health, and training based on how they've done in our program.\n\n+ Is my dog microchipped?\n\nYes, we microchip all of our dogs. We will send you information about adding your contact information to the microchip in your adoption details email.\n\n+ Is my dog potty trained?\n\nWe do our best to disclose the dog's training status in their profile or during the interview process based on how they've done in the foster's home. There may be some accidents when a dog transitions to your home as they adjust to a new environment and routine. We expect adopters to extend extra patience during the first two weeks of ownership as your dog may take some time to get accustomed to your space and schedule."
