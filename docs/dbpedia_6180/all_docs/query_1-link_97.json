        "text": "With the Ashton Real Estate Group, you get access to listings you WON'T find anywhere else. THAT'S the Ashton Advantage.\n\nLearn More About the Ashton Advantage\n\nEXISTING CLIENTS ACCESS ONLY\n\nAt The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage, we've created a marketing system that maximizes the exposure of your home and allows you to get the top dollar when selling your home.\n\nWe have a number of ways that we can either find your next home with our insight and access to Off Market and Coming Soon Properties. We maximize your time, profit, and convenience as well as providing the best possible customer experience.\n\nInsider Advantage\n\nCLIENT ONLY INSIDER MARKET INFORMATION\n\nWe have a large number of clients that are looking to buy homes as well as sell their current home. This means that we know about properties that are about to be listed before anyone else. We also work with some of the biggest real estate investors in North America, and when they sell their properties, again we are the first to know.\n\nThese homes we can then promote to our database of buyers as an additional \"advantage\" of listing or buying with The Ashton Real Estate Group.\n\nTo get updates on these listings you will need to be a client of one of our team agents, and they will be able to provide you with the most up-to-date password.\n\nGuaranteed Offer\n\nCLICK TO SUBMIT FOR YOUR GUARANTEED OFFER\n\nThis is a program that we are making available to our clients to see if they qualify to receive an offer from one of our investors. Terms and conditions do apply but this is a way of allowing someone to sell their home without having to go through the traditional route of selling their home.\n\nThis is a program that may not appeal to everyone but if you don't want to deal with the open houses, showings by agents, and uncertain timelines then this could be the program for you.\n\nDon't Sell Without The Intel!\n\nCLICK TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR A HOME LIKE YOURS\n\nIf you live in Nashville, chances are that you have heard of Gary Ashton and his team on the radio, seen one of his many billboards, seen how he promotes homes at TopGolf and at the Predators games, and now the recent Don't Sell Without the Intel and Guaranteed Nashville commercials (featuring Gary's client Bobby Bones).\n\nIn addition to this, we have a site that ranks extremely well for real estate-related search terms and as a result of this and other nationally ranking websites, we are able to generate well over 100 inquiries per day about homes for sale.\n\n\"Your Dream Address Without The Stress\"\n\nIf you have found the home of your dreams but you still have a home to sell, our Buy Before You Sell Program could be exactly what you need. If you are interested in talking to one of our listing specialists just let us know and we will arrange an appointment to come and visit you at your home at a mutually convenient time. Click HERE for more information on this program\n\nThe Ashton Auction Advantage\n\nClients Only Auction Coming Soons\n\nWith our contacts in the auction world, we can now make this sales and marketing system available to our clients. This is a process that is no longer associated with distressed sales but is another efficient way for the seller to dictate the closing date and compress potentially weeks of advertising and marketing into one specific date.\n\nThere are lots of benefits to using the auction method and in fact, some properties have traditionally sold for more at auction than their previous list price.\n\nFor more information about The Ashton Auction Advantage click HERE\n\nThe Ashton Advertising Advantage!\n\nYou may have seen the billboards all around Nashville or heard us on the radio stations, including Bobby Bones from the Big 98, Jonathon on the River, Mike Keith on 104.5 The Wake-Up Zone, etc. All of this advertising drives more traffic to GaryAshton.com which in turns sends more traffic to our flagship site NashvillesMLS.com\n\nThe branding and awareness of our sites help to generate daily traffic of around 5-8,000 visitors a day. This helps our client's properties to be seen by more people than any other real estate agent in Nashville.\n\nOur in house media department can produce world-class images and drone video\n\nWeb Site Traffic\n\n2019 saw a 40% increase from the chart below and 2020 saw another 40% increase until the outbreak of the Coronavirus, but we still are seeing traffic of 8,000 to 10,000 people a day.\n\n2018\n\nIn addition, Gary Ashton is a Zillow Premier Agent, and you will your home prominently positioned on Zillow, as well as our REMAX.com site, Homes.com. Realtor.com and numerous other sites.\n\nWe also use very targeted advertising techniques to ensure that we reach the very people who would be interested in your home through special techniques on FaceBook, USA Today, New York Times, ESPN etc\n\nOur Partner Advantage:\n\nMortgage Advantage\n\nAs we have helped hundreds of thousands of people over the years move and sell, as well as buy homes, we have developed a number of strong business relationships with other real estate-related businesses. One of the most obvious is the mortgage companies, and so over the past 18 years, it has become obvious to Gary that to serve the client at the highest level, we need to have strong relationships with the top people and decision-makers. As a result, we have worked very closely with the VP's and Presidents at AmerisBank, Pinnacle, and 5th 3rd Bank. This gives our clients the \"Ashton Advantage\" in terms of speed of processing and ability to get things done quickly and efficiently, which is a huge factor when it comes to making a quick and strong offer.\n\nMoving Company Advantage\n\nLikewise, when it comes to actually moving your personal possessions, we have partnered with our Titan's official moving company, Black Tie Moving. This gives you the added bonus of improved coverage, as well as access to the CEO and founder of the company Dustin Black."
