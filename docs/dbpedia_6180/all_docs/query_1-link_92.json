More opportunities will be added as they become available.\n\nGuest Ambassador\n\nVolunteers serve as one of the first points of contact with patients. They demonstrate Vanderbilt's commitment to patient and family-centered care by providing compassionate and individualized welcoming services. Guest Ambassadors collaborate with Guest Services staff to help with general wayfinding. They provide a calming guide as they help navigate visitors through detours around campus construction. This placement is ideal for those who are mobile and active and have a good sense of direction.\n\nVolunteers needed:\n\nVanderbilt University Hospital, 7 days a week, 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nThe Vanderbilt Clinics, weekdays, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nOne Hundred Oaks, weekdays, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nVolunteer shift: 2 hours\n\nEmergency Department Ambassador\n\nVolunteers assist Emergency Department personnel by providing patients and families with general information, and directions to hospital service areas. They also help patients, families and staff with non-clinical needs. Vanderbilt is the only Level 1 Trauma Center in the region, and thus very busy most of the time.

If you do not sew but are willing to help cut materials we can provide them. On-site and at-home opportunities are available."
