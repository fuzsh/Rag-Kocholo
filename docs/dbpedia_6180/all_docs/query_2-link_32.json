        "text": "Application Window:\n\nClosed\n\nProgram Application Period:\n\nCompleted applications for grants must be submitted electronically by no later than 11:59 a.m. Eastern Time (ET), February 20, 2024.\n\nImportant\n\nThe next application window is expected to open in early 2023.\n\nWhat does this program do?\n\nThe Community Connect provides financial assistance to eligible applicants that will provide broadband service in rural, economically-challenged communities where service does not exist.\n\nWho may apply?\n\nEligible applicants include:\n\nIncorporated organizations\n\nFederally-recognized Tribes\n\nState and local units of government\n\nAny other legal entity, including cooperatives, private corporations, or limited liability companies organized on a for-profit or not-for-profit basis\n\nWhat is an eligible area?\n\nRural areas that lack any existing broadband speed of at least 10Mbps downstream and 1Mbps upstream are eligible.\n\nThe Application Guide provides guidance on rural areas currently eligible for Community Connect Grants.\n\nThe Rural Utilities Service publishes all Community Connect Proposed Funded Service Areas (PFSAs) through its Public Notice Filing (PNF) process. Incumbent service providers may challenge the eligibility of a PFSA by filing a Public Notice Response (PNR). More information on the PNF/PNR process can be found by visiting the Rural Development Public Notice Filings Portal User Guide. For a demonstration on how to search for PNFs, submit a PNR, subscribe to PNF notifications, and more, watch the PNF Demonstration of the Public Filing Tool video. Those interested in receiving email notifications whenever a new application has been submitted and the PNF has been published can do so by signing up for our Public Notice Filing Subscription Service.\n\nHow may the funds be used?\n\nThe construction, acquisition, or leasing of facilities, spectrum, land or buildings used to deploy broadband service for:\n\nAll residential and business customers located within the Proposed Funded Service Area (PFSA)\n\nAll participating critical community facilities (such as public schools, fire stations, and public libraries)\n\nThe cost of providing broadband service free of charge to the critical community facilities for 2 years.\n\nLess than 10% of the grant amount or up to $150,000 may be used for the improvement, expansion, construction or acquisition of a community center that provides online access to the public.\n\nAre there other grant requirements?\n\nBuildings constructed with grant funds must be located on property owned by the awardee\n\nLeasing expenses will only be covered through the advance of funds period included in the award documents\n\nGrantees must have legal authority to provide, construct, operate and maintain the proposed facilities or services\n\nPartnerships with other federal, state, local, private and non-profit entities are encouraged\n\nFor additional detail see Code of Federal Regulations 7 CFR, Part 1739\n\nAre there any other grant requirements?\n\nMatching funds of at least 15% from non-federal sources are required and can be used for operating costs\n\nWho can answer questions about this program?\n\nFor questions about the Community Connect Grant Program, please email Community Connect or call the Loan Origination and Approval Division at (202) 720-0800.\n\nYou may also contact one of our General Field Representatives (GFR). To find a GFR, visit our GFR contact map at https://rd.usda.gov/contact-us/telecom-gfr.\n\nWhat governs this program?\n\n7 CFR, Part 1739 Subpart A\n\nWhy does USDA Rural Development do this?\n\nThe Community Connect program helps rural communities extend access where broadband service is least likely to be commercially available, but where it can make a tremendous difference in the quality of life for people and businesses. The projects funded by these grants help rural residents tap into the enormous potential of the Internet for jobs, education, healthcare, public safety, and community development.\n\nPreliminary Actions Required\n\nTo complete an application for this program, you must be pre-registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) and also have a Unique Entity ID (UEI) number. Neither of these applications cost money, but they can take time so be sure to get this taken care of immediately. If you are already registered with these systems, you do not need to register again.\n\nResources:\n\nCommunity Connect Program Webinar (Jan 11, 2024)\n\nWebinar Presentation FY2023 Extended Window\n\nCommunity Connect Program Map\n\nARR Resolution Instructions and Samples\n\nCommunity Connect Correction Notice & FAQs\n\nSF 424 (pdf)\n\nCommunity Connect Application Checklist\n\nCommunity Connect Application Guide\n\nSchedule H-1 | Pro Forma 5-Year Financial Forecast Single Application\n\nSchedule F1 & F2\n\nCommunity Connect Grant Program Standard Grant Agreement (pdf)\n\nCommunity Connect Portal User Guide\n\nTelecommunications Program Funded Service Areas Map\n\nAdditional information about submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request is available on the USDA FOIA website at: http://www.dm.usda.gov/foia.htm\n\nCorporations that have been convicted of a felony (or had an officer or agent acting on behalf of the corporation convicted of a felony) within the past 24 months are not eligible.
