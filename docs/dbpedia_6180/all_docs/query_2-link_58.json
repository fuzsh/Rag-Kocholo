        "text": "Black and Latino Achievers at the YMCA Community Action Program\n\nIn 2019, AB made an investment in the Black and Latino Achievers program at the YMCA of Middle Tennessee, which focuses on helping under-resourced students access a college education. Our grant provided dedicated funding for a new Pathway Navigator role. It enabled the YMCA staff to transform its approach, increasing the amount of scholarships earned by 10 times year over year. From 2019 to 2024, students have secured more than $6 million in funds to help them succeed in college.\n\nHelping Meet Our Communities' Most Pressing Needs\n\nAB employees in our new Pune office organized their first AB Gives Back volunteering initiative, supporting a local orphanage. The Dharmaveer Shambhuraje Anathalaya has aided orphan children and their families since 1996, and its unsafe playground required major renovation. Volunteers worked in two shifts to excavate, cement and beautify the playground area, helping create a space for children to learn, play and grow. Colleagues finished the day by joining the children in music, dance and drawing."
