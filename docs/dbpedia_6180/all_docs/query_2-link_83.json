        "text": "The Covenant School Fosters\n\nCuriosity, Intentionality, and Authenticity\n\nAt The Covenant School, we value and celebrate the curiosity embedded in the heart and mind of every child. In the classroom, teachers are dedicated to knowing each child and differentiating instruction in order to successfully teach every student. We are a community of families and professionals committed to being authentic in the pursuit of their relationship with God.\n\nGet To Know Us\n\nTestimonials\n\nFrom Our Community\n\nFrom the moment you step onto The Covenant School campus, you will witness the strong sense of community that exists here. The welcoming atmosphere created by our devoted faculty and staff working together with invested families has been recognized as a defining trait of our school throughout its history. Together, we work toward a common goal: to shepherd, empower, and celebrate your children.\n\nBecause we’re a small school, people know you. Not just your name, but what you like, what you don’t like, your talents, your weaknesses, how to make you feel good about yourself, how to challenge you to reach new heights. And it doesn’t stop with our students; parents are known too. Families here benefit from a level of individual attention that isn’t possible at a large school. Our parents, faculty, staff, and students are friends, all loving, supporting, and encouraging each other in a community that puts Christ first.\n\nDiscover Covenant\n\nFrom the moment you step onto The Covenant School campus, you will witness the strong sense of community that exists here.

We begin with PreSchool because the early years encompass some of the most rapid learning and growth any of us ever experience. It’s an exciting time, full of wonder and joy, and Covenant fully taps into the potential of those years.\n\nEnding in sixth grade also has many advantages. Our sixth grade students experience the transition to adolescence in a community where they’re known and loved and where they feel safe to try new things. Unlike a school that continues into the high-school years, at The Covenant School, our sixth grade students are the leaders at a time when being a leader is an important part of a young person’s development. They lead Chapel, walk-in younger students at morning drop-off, take charge of community service activities, mentor their little PreSchool and PreK buddies, and become role models for the younger students.\n\nAnd even though they’re entering puberty, sixth grade students are still basically kids. So we let them be kids without the pressure to grow up too fast. They still dress up, use their imaginations, sing silly songs, and belly laugh, all in a school where there is no pressure from older students to grow up before their time.\n\nOur Mission"
