        "text": "Our very own Sunny Bray is featured in Nashville Business Journal's list of diverse leaders you need to know! The Nashville Business Journal published \"Celebrating Diverse Leadership: Nashville Leaders You Need to Know\" last week, highlighting 25 minority leaders across Nashville's vibrant business community. These leaders reflect the diversity often missing from \"the room where it happens\" and we are encouraged by the recognition of leaders looking to break barriers for themselves and future leaders. In her Q&A, Sunny shares more about the underlying concerns of our city that deserve a little more attention and her hopes for Catalyst Collective as a support to our community's nonprofits. One of our favorite answers (that was a little too long for the final cut!) discusses the legacy she hopes to leave: What do you want to be known for in Nashville and its business community? → \"Simply? Impact and disruption. I feel that I can have a positive impact in many ways. I can set an example as a role model for young women, especially minority women. I want to show that you can have it all: Be a business owner yet still prioritize family and mental health. I want people to know that you can learn from the challenges you've faced or obstacles you've had to overcome rather than letting them define you. Related to that is disruption; I want to speak up about things many are often afraid to talk about. I really feel if people are vulnerable and authentic, there will be more community and connection. We are all battling challenges and they do show up at work. For example, I lost my mom in December and before that I was in and out of the ICU with her for two months. I was a caretaker all while being pulled in multiple directions: mom, wife, running a business. We often talk about mentorship, but what's really needed for people to succeed are sponsors and advocates. Who is already in these rooms and at the tables during conversations? At those tables, how are they mentioning others — especially people of color? I want to challenge those in positions of power and privilege where their actions don't align with their words. When I think about my legacy, I want to be known for impacting nonprofits, equipping them with the tools and resources for them to transform our community. I would love to scale Catalyst Collective to a 7-figure company and be a connector that helps people new to Nashville feel welcomed, included and able to grow professionally and personally.\" Change occurs when we come together; let's continue to be #changemakers together. https://lnkd.in/e3ACeNKc #CatalystCollective #NashvilleLeaders #NashvilleEntrepreneurs #Entrepreneurship\n\nNonprofits in the U.S. fill basic and essential needs for our communities and lead social change efforts, so this is an important piece, based on the most recent Building Movement Project (BMP) report. The finding that leaders of color are more likely to move into leadership roles out of dissatisfaction with current state of work (rather than a desire to become a leader) really resonates with my experience and that of the dozens of (particularly women of color) leaders have shared with me. Because the leadership approaches I was exposed to early in my career were often not values-aligned with me and presumed traits and experiences most likely possessed by White and male individuals, I did not imagine myself as an organizational leader. I took on leadership roles because of my values and the desire to change workplace culture to be more equitable, caring, and effective at serving communities. When combined with the fact that people of color have less opportunities for mentorship, are paid less than their White peers, are expected to carry the equity and inclusion work whether it is their job to do so or not, and that leaders of color experience less support and more microaggressions at work, it is not at all surprising that there is less interest in leadership (as it is traditionally envisioned). How do we change this? How do we make sure that nonprofits have leadership that is supported and values-aligned? We have to work on changing workplace culture and structures. #culturechange #leadership #leadersofcolor\n\nHiring and nurturing diverse teams has never been more important. Despite strides in supporting new nonprofit leaders, a recent report from Building Movement Project notes a decline in interest, particularly among people of color, in taking on leadership roles. Especially troubling is \"that aspiring leaders, especially those of color, weren’t being pulled into leadership through support and positive role models but were more often pushed into top positions to escape difficult work circumstances and improve the situation for themselves and others.\" This aligns so closely with my presentation at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education last year with Myrna Bizer, Derreasha Jones, and Donald Phan discussing what organizations could do to better support young, diverse fundraisers. One of the ways I know works is an \"advancement fellows\" program model that creates opportunities for young people to experience fundraising as a potential career. It helps our organizations build and develop a skilled, homegrown talent pipeline, and it encourages nonprofits to provide support systems that will help attract and keep people rising through the ranks. The co-executive directors of the Building Movement Project, Frances Kunreuther and Sean Thomas-Breitfeld, suggest several other ways leaders can help those who are moving into nonprofit leadership roles: 1. Ensure the job is doable. 2. Increase support from exiting leaders and other executive directors. 3. Cultivate younger staff with leadership aspirations. 4. Remain open to, and fund, alternative leadership approaches. What else would you add to this list to nurture a more inclusive fundraising team of aspiring leaders? #NonprofitLeadership #DiversityInLeadership #philanthropyinnovators\n\nA new study in the Race to Lead series by the Building Movement Project finds that aspiring leaders, especially those of color, aren’t being pulled into leadership through support and positive role models but are more often pushed into top positions to escape difficult work circumstances. The study showed the percentage of respondents of color aspiring to lead organizations has dropped to the lowest level in three surveys conducted since 2016. This decline, from 52% in 2019 to 46% in the latest report (2022 data), is particularly alarming as previous surveys showed an increase in interest among nonprofit staff of color for leadership roles. To address these challenges and make leadership roles more attractive, the report suggests the following actions for grantmakers and current nonprofit leaders to consider: # Ensure the job is doable by providing funding to address challenges in running a nonprofit, such as concerns about pay equity, work-life balance, and pushback from local government officials. # Increase support from existing leaders and other executive directors by providing funding for formal and informal gatherings where leaders can share information and support each other. # Cultivate younger staff with leadership aspirations by providing mentoring opportunities and highlighting the benefits of leading. # Remain open to and fund alternative leadership approaches, such as co-executive director arrangements, to support those in top roles.

It definitely resonates with me in my experiences as a Black Women in leadership positions with the Arts, Culture, & Service organizations. Specifically, There is a need for creating a Pipeline for Black Women and Women of Color in executive leadership roles. There’s this strong stigma that only one Black perosn or woman can be in a leadership role at any given organization, institution or company. I’d like to also toss in this discussion. A supportive environment from stakeholders, board members & staff for a new leader of color to have the anonomy to doing their job without racial, social and equity barriers. Many institutions need to address the power dynamics these people have or hold within the organization that prevents leaders of color from being successful in their work! This work is more than listening sessions and strategic plans it’s Work Environment, Office Vibes, and Collaborative Learning Development for Change! This is beyond this article a little but in the same realm. I would love to hear more discussion centered in this question. How are stakeholders, recruiting firms, search agencies, and current leaders creating a non-bias plan for new founder(s) or executive leadership transitions, clear ED/MD/COO/President, & other executive roles job descriptions with full transparency, providing support during the transition phase (strategically what does this look like?) and creating a pathway for a Black Women & Women of Color opportunities in executive leadership positions??"
