        "text": "Attend a Lowdown\n\nLowdowns are fun, casual in-person events for prospective members to learn more about BrainTrust and have their questions answered by BrainTrust members and staff. Hosted quarterly, Lowdowns are a great way for you to meet other women business owners, build your network, and determine if now is the right time for you to apply for membership.\n\nApplication & Interview\n\nFollowing your attendance at a Lowdown, you’ll be invited to submit your application for membership. Be sure to have your Profit & Loss Statement (P&L) ready to attach to your application. If your application is approved, we will schedule a follow-up interview. We use this time to get to know you so we can find the Vault™ that is right for you. If your application does not move forward, BrainTrust will notify you and connect you with other resources that we believe are better suited to your current business needs.\n\nNew Member Training\n\nIf you are accepted into BrainTrust, you will attend a mandatory training to ensure you get the most value out of your BrainTrust membership. This 3-hour session for new members gives you a sneak peek into how Vault™ sessions function and gives you tips on how to actively engage peers and enjoy your Vault experience while growing your business.\n\nVault™ Placement\n\nWithin 30 days of your training, our team will carefully curate a Vault™ that we believe is perfect for you. Each of the members of the prospective Vault™ will receive the bios of the other prospective members to determine if any conflicts of interest would prevent you from fully engaging with your fellow Vault™ members. A conflict might include a competitor, primary suppliers or customers, or someone with whom you’ve had a history of contention. Once potential conflicts are addressed, the first Vault™ meeting is scheduled. The idea of being vulnerable around people you don’t know may seem scary but don’t worry. We’ve got you. Our team will be there to guide you every step of the way so you’ll feel confident and at ease walking into your first meeting."
