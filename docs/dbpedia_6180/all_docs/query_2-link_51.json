Our organization's unwavering commitment to fostering collaboration and alignment ensures that we are collectively working towards a brighter future for all our citizens, particularly our youth. Through shared goals and innovative strategies, Alignment Nashville empowers our community to tackle its most pressing challenges and create lasting positive change.\n\nKent Oliver, Chair - Board of Directors\n\nNashville is rich with people who are eager to support public education, and Alignment Nashville does an excellent job channeling that enthusiasm into the strategic direction of the district as we work to make Every Student Known. Alignment has a multiplying effect on other nonprofits that support MNPS. We deeply value the partnerships and resources MNPS is able to access thanks to Alignment Nashville. The issues facing our students, teachers, and families are complex, and we need to collaborate with the community to address them effectively. Alignment Nashville makes that collaboration easy and efficient.\n\nDr. Adrienne Battle, Superintendent, Metro Nashville Public Schools"
