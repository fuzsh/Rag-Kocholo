In 2022-23 alone, 760,000 people used a food bank for the first time. And food banks in the Trussell Trust network distributed almost 3 million food parcels. That‚Äôs one every 8 seconds. After raising ¬£340,000 for the charity last year, we want to go even further. We‚Äôre aiming to raise over ¬£366,000, for a combined total of over ¬£1 million raised for the Trussell Trust in three years. Food banks in the Trussell Trust network provide nutritionally balanced emergency food parcels through over 1,300 food bank centres nationwide to individuals and families who can‚Äôt afford the essentials. In short, the Trussell Trust is a lifeline to millions. Find out more: https://lnkd.in/g_53z5Bh #Trussell Trust #Community #WeArePostOffice"
