        "text": "“I initially created a fake brand and campaign for my project, but after graduation, I decided that I really wanted to try and make EARTHLY a real thing,” says Jordan. “EARTHLY: For The Planet has become a business that allows me to express my creativity and my love for people, the planet, and fashion. I want EARTHLY to be a brand that not only sells cute clothing but actually cares about its customers and the environment.”\n\nSince graduating, Jordan has been working on all aspects related to the brand; ranging from social media, to website development, and even to potential clothing designs, it’s been a whirlwind to get everything up and running. Jordan has been creating all of the content for the website and social media herself, so she has been constantly booked with socially distanced photoshoots that have allowed her to meet, and work with, some incredible people. That way, they can further spread the word about EARTHLY and, essentially, build the brand.\n\nAll of the clothing and materials (pillowcases, bedsheets, napkins, etc) for EARTHLY: For The Planet are pre-owned/pre-worn. So far, the first two collections have been mostly made from items in Jordan’s own closet, things she found around the house, clothing from her aunt and boyfriend, and clothing from a few friends who went through their closets. “My goal is to avoid thrifting to find items to upcycle and to only use things that people already own,” says Jordan. “I haven’t worked out all of the details yet, but my ultimate goal is to have customers donate their clothing directly to EARTHLY, either to have it made into something new and sent back to them or to have it transformed and sold to someone else, while getting a discount code in the process.”\n\nSince launching, there have been 50+ items featured on the website, and nearly 20 items were included in the Instagram sale. “Everyone I talk to about EARTHLY seems to love the idea, so I’m really just trying to expand my audience and reach more people,” says Jordan. “For only having two item launches so far, I’m really proud of the progress I’ve made and I can’t wait for what’s to come.”\n\nIn just a few months, there’s no denying that EARTHLY: For The Planet has had noticeable success; it’s grown from an idea and an Instagram account, to a full-fledged website and online shopping platform. “I never want EARTHLY to be an isolating brand; I want it to be diverse and inclusive so that everyone can feel comfortable and welcome shopping the brand,” says Jordan. “I’m just genuinely excited to see where things go from here. I’m really appreciative of the support I’ve received so far and really hope that once I can reach more people, they love EARTHLY: For The Planet as much as I do.”\n\nConnect and keep up to date with EARTHLY: For The Planet online:\n\nCheck out their website https://www.earthlyfortheplanet.com/ for the latest unique recycled pieces\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/earthlyfortheplanet/\n\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/earthlyfortheplanet\n\nEARTHLY: For The Planet strives to close the clothing loop at every step in our production process, with the ultimate goal of reducing the amount of clothing waste in landfills. We take the clothing you don't want to make it into something beautiful (and recycled). All of our packaging materials are made out of recycled materials as well, so you can recycle and reuse them instead of tossing them out."
