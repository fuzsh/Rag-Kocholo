        "text": "Creating our energy future\n\nWe’re finding solutions for the sustainable energy future you want and sharing our insights and ideas on the current issues and challenges that are shaping the energy industry.\n\nOur leadership\n\nGuided by our values of safety, integrity, collaboration, innovation and responsibility, our leaders ensure that we develop and operate our facilities, safely, reliably and with minimal impact on the environment.\n\nEnergy Solutions\n\nWe are a leader in developing and operating energy infrastructure. We aim to leverage the size and scale of our energy network and trading platform to be the most trusted and reliable source of low carbon energy for the North American industrial, natural gas and oil sectors.\n\nNatural Gas\n\nOur network of natural gas pipelines supplies more than 25 per cent of the clean-burning natural gas consumed daily across North America to heat homes, fuel industries and generate power.\n\nOil and Liquids\n\nTC Energy builds and operates safe and reliable energy infrastructure. This includes our network of oil & liquids pipelines, which supplies and delivers North American crude oil to help meet growing energy needs in Canada and the U.S.\n\nPower and Storage\n\nTC Energy’s owns or has interests in seven power generation facilities with a combined generating capacity of approximately 4,200 megawatts (MW) – enough to power more than 4 million homes. Our power assets are located in Canada and more than 75 per cent of the power we provide is generated from emission-less sources.\n\nReport on Sustainability\n\nOur annual Report on Sustainability offers a comprehensive overview of our sustainability-related endeavours and summarizes the progress we have made towards our commitments and targets. This Report underscores our ongoing commitment to transparency and accountability for our shareholders, stakeholders and rightsholders.\n\nSafety\n\nOur goal is for our pipeline and energy facilities to operate safely every day so that the public, our workforce and the environment aren’t affected by an incident involving our assets. Safety is, and always will be, our number one value.\n\nWorking with Indigenous groups\n\nFor more than 40 years, TC Energy has been engaging with Indigenous groups. We recognize Indigenous groups as rights holders who have a distinct relationship to the land. We understand that our business activities have the potential to affect these groups in tangible ways.\n\nBuild Strong\n\nOur community giving program, Build Strong, invests in organizations that are integral to local communities, and our business. Whether we are providing grants to organizations, awarding scholarships to students or sponsoring a local event that brings community members together, our goal is to help build strong, vibrant communities through mutually beneficial relationships.\n\nScholarships\n\nOur scholarships are an easy way to get financial support for school. Now with close to 800 scholarships available across Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, you could receive a scholarship valued at up to $5,000.\n\nEmployee participation\n\nThrough the employee participation component of our Build Strong program, we support and encourage our employees to give back to their communities in ways that resonate with them personally through fundraising, donating, volunteering, or even simple acts of kindness that help make the world a better place.\n\nLiquids Spinoff\n\nOur shareholders have endorsed the spin off of our Liquids Pipelines business, accelerating disciplined growth and supporting global energy security. The separation will result in two high-quality, highly focused energy industry leaders.\n\n2023 letter to shareholders\n\nCEO François Poirier and Chair John Lowe share their views on the outlook for our business following a transformational year executing on 2023's priorities.\n\nEnvironment, social and governance\n\nTC Energy strives to be a leader in the delivery of energy in a safe, responsible and sustainable manner, ensuring we are positioned to maximize long-term value creation."
