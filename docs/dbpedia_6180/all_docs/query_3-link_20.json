Is it just some interference, or is it some old abandoned mysterious creepy russian radio station like UVB-76 (the buzzer)? The signal covers a lot, roughly 4447-4503 kHz, so it makes it even more mysterious. I don't know what is it's name if it's a radio station, so I can't do research on it. But, all I know is that my poor EFHW antenna can't receive it. I'm looking for what is it's name, if it has one, and what does it do. Hopefully it's not a creepy radio station, because I have dealt with enough of those radio stations in my life. There hasn't been information on it (yet) on priyom.org.\n\nUPDATE: Now, there is another smaller one at the WTWW station."
