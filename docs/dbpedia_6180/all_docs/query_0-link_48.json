The longer people have them, the greater the chances are that they will develop complications, some of which will require more surgery.\n\nBreast implants have been associated with the development of a cancer of the immune system called breast implant–associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). This cancer occurs more commonly in patients with textured breast implants than smooth implants, although rates are not well defined. Some patients have died from BIA-ALCL.\n\nPatients receiving breast implants have reported a variety of systemic symptoms, such as joint pain, muscle aches, confusion, chronic fatigue, autoimmune diseases, and others. Individual patient risk for developing these symptoms has not been well established. Some patients report complete resolution of symptoms when the implants are removed without replacement.\n\nWho can get breast implants?\n\nNatrelle® Breast Implants are approved for the following:\n\nBreast augmentation for women at least 22 years old for silicone-filled implants and for women at least 18 years old for saline-filled implants. Breast augmentation includes primary breast augmentation to increase the breast size and revision surgery to correct or improve the result of a primary breast augmentation\n\nBreast reconstruction. This includes primary breast reconstruction to replace breast tissue that has been removed due to cancer or trauma or that has failed to develop properly due to a severe breast abnormality. This also includes revision surgery to correct or improve the result of a primary breast reconstruction\n\nWho should NOT get breast implants?\n\nBreast implant surgery should NOT be performed in:\n\nWomen with active infection anywhere in their body\n\nWomen with existing cancer or precancer of their breast who have not received adequate treatment for those conditions\n\nWomen who are currently pregnant or nursing\n\nWhat should I tell my doctor?\n\nTell your doctor if you have any of the following conditions, as the risks of breast implant surgery may be higher:\n\nAutoimmune diseases (eg, lupus and scleroderma)\n\nA weakened immune system (eg, taking medications to decrease the body’s immune response)\n\nPlanned chemotherapy or radiation therapy following breast implant placement\n\nConditions or medications that interfere with wound healing and blood clotting\n\nReduced blood supply to breast tissue\n\nClinical diagnosis of depression or other mental health disorders, including body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders\n\nThose with a diagnosis of depression or other mental health disorders should wait for resolution or stabilization of these conditions prior to undergoing breast implantation surgery\n\nWhat else should I consider?\n\nThere is a Boxed Warning for breast implants. Please see bold text at beginning\n\nMany changes to your breasts following implantation are irreversible. If you later choose to have your implants removed and not replaced, you may experience dimpling, puckering, wrinkling, or other cosmetic changes, which may be permanent\n\nBreast implantation is likely not a one-time surgery. The longer implants are in place, the greater the potential risk for complications. You will likely need additional surgeries on your breasts due to complications or unacceptable cosmetic results. Thus, you should also consider the complication rates for later (revision) surgery since you may experience these risks in the future\n\nCancer treatments and surgery will affect the outcome and timing of breast reconstruction\n\nBreast implants may affect your ability to breastfeed, either by reducing or eliminating milk production\n\nRupture of a silicone-filled breast implant is most often silent. Even if you have no symptoms, you should have your first ultrasound or MRI at 5 to 6 years after your initial implant surgery and then every 2 to 3 years thereafter regardless of whether your implants are for augmentation or reconstruction. If you have symptoms of or uncertain ultrasound results for breast implant rupture, an MRI is recommended. Additional imaging may be required depending on your medical history and status. The health consequences of a ruptured silicone gel-filled breast implant have not been fully established\n\nRoutine screening mammography for breast cancer will be more difficult, and implants may rupture during the procedure. Perform self-examination every month for cancer screening and ask your surgeon to help you distinguish the implant from your breast tissue. Lumps, persistent pain, swelling, hardening, or changes in implant shape should be reported to your surgeon and possibly evaluated with imaging\n\nWhat are key complications with breast implants?\n\nKey complications include reoperation, implant removal with or without replacement, implant rupture with silicone-filled implants, implant deflation with saline-filled implants, and capsular contracture (severe scar tissue around the implant). Other complications include breast pain, swelling, asymmetry, wrinkling/rippling, implant malposition nipple complications, hypertrophic scarring, and implant palpability/visibility.\n\nTalk to your doctor about other complications.\n\nFor more information, see the patient brochures at www.allergan.com/products.\n\nTo report a problem with Natrelle® Breast Implants, please call Allergan® at 1-800-624-4261.\n\nThe sale and distribution of Natrelle® Breast Implants is restricted to licensed physicians who provide information to patients about the risks and benefits of breast implant surgery.\n\nREVOLVE™ and REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 ADVANCED ADIPOSE SYSTEM\n\nCONSUMER INDICATIONS AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nHow is REVOLVE™ System or REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 System used?\n\nThe REVOLVE™ Advanced Adipose System (REVOLVE™ System) and REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 Advanced Adipose System (REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 System) are used for aspiration, harvesting, filtering, and transferring of fat for aesthetic body shaping. The REVOLVE™ System and REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 System are intended for use in the following surgeries when drawing fat is desired: plastic and reconstructive surgery, gastrointestinal and affiliated organ surgery, urological surgery, general surgery, bone or muscle surgery, gynecological surgery, thoracic surgery, and minimally invasive surgery.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWhen should REVOLVE™ System or REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 System NOT be used?\n\nThe device should not be used by your physician if you currently have any disease that adversely affects wound healing, and poor overall health status.\n\nWhat should I discuss with my doctor before my procedure?\n\nThe device will not, in and of itself, produce significant weight reduction. The device should be used by your physician with extreme caution if you have a chronic medical condition such as diabetes, heart, lung, or circulatory system disease, or obesity.\n\nWhat else should I know?\n\nThe device is designed to remove localized deposits of excess fat through a small incision and subsequently transfer the tissue back to you. Use of the device is limited to those physicians who have the appropriate level of medical education and surgical experience in the appropriate surgical procedures. Results of the procedure will vary depending upon your age, surgical site, and experience of your physician. Results of the procedure may or may not be permanent.\n\nWhat are possible side effects of the procedure?\n\nSome common adverse effects associated with use of the REVOLVE™ System or REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 System and/or autologous fat transfer procedures are unevenness, over- and/or under-correction, tissue lumps, bleeding, scarring, fat cell death, formation of cysts, chronic immune system response, allergic reaction, infection and inflammation of various levels.\n\nThis information is not intended to replace a discussion with your surgeon and does not describe all the potential risks associated with fat transfer procedures. Please consult with your surgeon to determine if the use of REVOLVE™ System is right for you.\n\nREVOLVE™ System and REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 System are for use only by a licensed physician.\n\nFor more information, please see the Instructions for Use (IFU) and User Manual for REVOLVE™ System available at www.allergan.com/RevolveIFU and Instructions for Use (IFU) for REVOLVE ENVI™ 600 System at www.allergan.com/RevolveENVI-IFU or call 1.800.678.1605.\n\nTo report an adverse reaction, please call Allergan at 1.800.367.5737.\n\nSkinMedica®\n\nMost of the SkinMedica® products described on this website are intended to meet the FDA’s definition of a cosmetic product, an article applied to the human body to cleanse, beautify, promote attractiveness, and alter appearances.
