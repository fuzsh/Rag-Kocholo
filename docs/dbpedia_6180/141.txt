An alliance between 9Paths, and the Urban League of Middle Tennessee offers a holistic strategy on bridging the gap in advancement and visibility of African Americans in two business areas; in Corporate America and the small business community.

Nashville, nicknamed the “It City,” is a fast-growing city and desirable market that is catching the eyes of high-profile individuals and corporate executives who are looking for an opportunity to increase their diversity and inclusion goals. Equity in Action offers Corporate-America the methodology to improve diversity and inclusion through an equitable lens. Nashville is also home to a growing entrepreneurial community of African American small business owners. Equity in Action offers African American small business owners the opportunity to partner with influential business leaders to increase procurement and visibility within the community. A 12-month program aimed at addressing systemic racism and inequalities in Corporate America.

Fostering inclusion in organizations is invaluable to business sustainability. EIA is a tangible way for Nashville business

leaders to not just give back to our local Black-owned business owners but to have the potential to change their lives for the better while, in turn, becoming a more self-aware person. Participants will receive a certificate in fostering
