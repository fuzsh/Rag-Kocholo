Wislawa Szymborska was a Polish poet, essayist, translator and recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Literature, for “poetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human reality”. “I think she would have liked it very much, it is remarkable that her poetry will be found next to the constitutions of many countries and the greatest digitized works of art in the world,” said Michal Rusinek, the president of the Wislawa Szymborska Foundation.
