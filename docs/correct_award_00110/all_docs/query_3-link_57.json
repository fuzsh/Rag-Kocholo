        "text": "Wisława Szymborska\n\nDarkness\n\nStreaming services: three thousand series, that you won’t watch.\n\nSome shows have abandoned any hope: social dramas from developing nations slashers for enthusiasts (no, not you) yet another culinary show with a transparent title podcasts by hosts you haven’t heard of, about people you had no idea existed a few athlete biographies, oh, none will make it from bottom to top of the catalogue. Decades of training for nothing.\n\nSad shows, poorly-funded shows, all crowded into lower levels of the corridors of code, they will never escape the zeros and ones. Not for these the algorithm, which awards prime spots on the screen or – distant dream – a trailer to top, for half a week, the homepage. The shows with trailers have a chance, those at the bottom none, ever.\n\nThey hear you logging-in far above their heads. “Me! Me! Watch me! It’ll be great! Me!”,!! they call out of duty, yet without conviction.\n\nIn “Two families”, a sitcom duplicating hundreds of more famous sitcoms, in the middle of a scene the actress pauses suddenly, halfway through her line, and before delivering her, well, mediocre punchline, sits on the couch and stares, dazed, at the fourth wall, beyond which you are not.\n\nTranslated by Daria Badger\n\nDaria Badger\n\nCulture Section Editor\n\nNorth Carolina, United States\n\nCo-founder of Harbingers’ Magazine\n\nBorn in 2004, Daria Badger is a student from the United States, currently attending high school in North Carolina. She is studying Polish and Mandarin Chinese, and plans to study linguistics in the future.\n\nDaria is interested in film and literature, in particular science fiction and high fantasy. Music is another great interest as she has played the flute for seven years and is a member of the band at school. Other major leisure pursuits are both classic and video games, especially chess and Minecraft.\n\nAt Harbingers’ Magazine, Daria is a writer and edits the Culture section."
