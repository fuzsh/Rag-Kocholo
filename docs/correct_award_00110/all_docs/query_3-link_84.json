        "text": "Czeslaw Milosz (b. 1911) is Poland's first poet to win the Nobel Prize in literature (1980). Before him, the world's most prestigious literary award was given to novelists Henryk Sienkiewicz (1905) and Wladyslaw Reymont (1924). Milosz, already a recognized poet before World War II and, initially, a diplomat for the Polish post-war communist government, defected to the West in 1951. The Royal Swedish Academy honored him as a poet \"who with uncompromising clear-sightedness voices man's exposed condition in a world of severe conflicts.\" A long-term inhabitant of Berkeley, he now shares his year between California and the much more historic Kraków, Poland.\n\nHis poem Bypassing Rue Descartes could be seen as yet another reaction to Paris and the imposing wealth of its traditions and culture; Mi³osz, however, presents this all-too-frequent theme with a recognizably Eastern-European tinge.\n\nWislawa Szymborska (b. 1923) was too young to make her debut before the war. After an early short socialist-realist episode, she gradually worked her way into the Pantheon of modern Polish poetry. As a result, her Nobel Prize in 1996, awarded for \"poetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human reality\" came as a surprise only to the nominee. Szymborska's Kraków address makes that city a true capital of poetry.\n\nFuneral is a good example of her the casual, conversational tone of many of her works.\n\nZbigniew Herbert (1924 -1998), freedom fighter in the Polish Resistance during World War II, never dabbled in collaboration. His intransigence made him a non-person at times; of the great trio of Polish poets, he also by far the most philosophical and intellectual. His poetry, including the famous Cogito cycle, was certainly worth another Nobel Prize. It is, sadly, too late for that now: Herbert died recently, after a long and debilitating disease, in a Warsaw hospital.\n\nIn Elegy of Fortinbras, Herbert appropriates and reinterprets Hamlet, that most Polish of Shakespeare's plays. Hamlet the intellectual is dead; he is replaced by Fortinbras, \"the strong-arm-man.\"\n\nKrzysztof Koehler (b. 1963) is one of the new generation of poets who came of age at the very end, or already after the collapse, of communist rule. These 'New Barbarians,' as they like to call themselves, believe in the need to find a new idiom that would eschew the Polish (post-)Romantic tradition, and have been especially outspoken in influential quarterlies BruLion [Sketchbook] and NaGlos [Aloud]. Koehler's connection with this course is of a particular nature: he taught it twice at Rice, in 1997 and 2000.\n\nHis Kraków is perhaps one of the best modern poems on Poland's most magical city.\n\nMarcin ¦wietlicki (b. 1961) is another New Barbarian, perhaps the most barbaric of them all. He certainly drives that point home by leading his own rock band, ¦wietliki (Polish for glow-worms, but of course the joke is on a possible English pronunciation of his name). As a result, he is popular with two separate audiences: the intellectual and the teenager, for two different aspects of his activity.\n\nThe Work Ethic is a good example of his ironic style. McDonald's, on the other hand, is an instance of ¦wietlicki's music."
