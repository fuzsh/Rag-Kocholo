        "text": "STOCKHOLM (AP) â The Latest on the awarding of the 2019 Nobel Prizes (all times local):\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nPolish novelist Olga Tokarczuk is the first woman this year to be awarded a Nobel Prize â although strictly speaking her prize is for 2018. The nine winners of this year's science prizes were all men.\n\nTokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the Nobel literature prize in more than a century and the first since Belarusian journalist Svetlana Alexievich in 2015.\n\nLast year, three women received prizes â Donna Strickland in physics; Frances H. Arnold in chemistry; and Nadia Muras won the Nobel Peace Prize. With Tokarczuk, that number has been raised to four for 2018.\n\nAccording to the official website of the Nobel Prize, 53 women have been honored in all categories since 1901. The first woman to get the literature prize was Swedish author Selma Lagerlof in 1909.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nPoland's president and culture minister have congratulated writer Olga Tokarczuk for winning the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda called it a \"great day for Polish literature\" on Twitter and said: \"Another Polish writer, after the poet Wislawa Szymborska, receives the literary Nobel Prize. Bravo!\"\n\nSzymborska received the prize in 1996.\n\nTokarczuk, 57, is one of Poland's best-known authors. But she has also been criticized by Polish conservatives â and received death threats â for criticizing aspects of the country's past, including its episodes of anti-Semitism. She is also a strong critic of Poland's right-wing government.\n\nCulture Minister Piotr Glinski, who only days ago confessed to having tried reading her works but not making it through any of them, also congratulated her. On Thursday he said he would try harder now and claimed her accomplishment for Poland. He said: \"A Nobel Prize is a clear sign that Polish culture is well appreciated in the world.\"\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nPeter Handke is known as a provocative author who hasn't shied away from courting controversy or, as one of his works is titled, \"Offending the Audience,\" in a career spanning more than five decades.\n\nHandke's debut novel in 1966 was \"The Hornets.\" Also that year, \"Offending the Audience\" made its debut in a Frankfurt theater, confronting elegantly dressed theatergoers as \"good-for-nothings.\"\n\nHis 1970 novel \"The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,\" the story of a former sportsman, was filmed by Wim Wenders.\n\nHandke was an opponent of NATO's airstrikes against Serbia in the Kosovo war of the late 1990s and spoke in 2006 at the funeral of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic.\n\n___\n\n2:10 p.m.\n\nAustria's president is congratulating Peter Handke on winning the Nobel Prize in literature, praising his \"fascinating\" works and declaring it a great day for literature.\n\nAlexander Van der Bellen wrote on Twitter that Handke's \"quiet and intense voice has for decades designed worlds, places and people who couldn't be more fascinating.\"\n\nHe described Handke's tone as \"unfussy and unique,\" and said that \"we have a lot to thank Peter Handke for. I hope he knows that.\"\n\n___\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nThe chair of the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy says the 18-member Academy picked four members from own its ranks and five \"externals\" to select the shortlist for the 2018 and 2019 literature prizes.\n\nThe academy has reformed itself after sex abuse allegations that led to a mass exodus of committee members and the ouster of then-Permanent Secretary Sara Danius, resulting in no prize being awarded last year for the first time since 1943 at the height of World War II.\n\nAnders Olsson, the chair, says the list of the candidates, whose names are secret, is boiled down by the group of nine to a shortlist of eight people to be considered by the Academy.\n\nHe added that in early October, the Academy chooses the laureates, and that a candidate must receive more than half of the votes cast.\n\nWhen asked whether the Swedish Academy really makes the decision, Olsson said \"We are not ready yet to evaluate the process,\" and declined to elaborate on the internal line of work.\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nThe announcement that the 2018 Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded to Polish author Olga Tokarczuk provides a morale boost to liberal-minded Poles only three days before a nationalist populist party taking the country down an illiberal path seems headed for re-election.\n\nTokarczuk was honored by the Swedish Academy on Thursday for what it said was \"a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.\"\n\nTokarczuk has celebrated the ethnic melting pot that Poland was in the past in her works. That has not made her universally admired by the nationalists in power in Poland.\n\nEven Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said in recent days that he has tried to read her works but never managed to finish any of them.\n\nThe last Pole to win the Nobel literature prize was poet Wislawa Szymborska in 1996.\n\n___\n\n1 p.m.\n\nThe 2018 Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded to Polish author Olga Tokarczuk \"for a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life,\" while the 2019 prize went to Austrian author Peter Handke.\n\nMats Malm, the Swedish Academy's permanent secretary, says Handke was honored \"for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\"\n\nThe shortlist was made of eight names of which two were picked for the 2018 and 2019 awards, said Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy.\n\nWith the glory comes a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award to be shared a gold medal and a diploma. The laureates receive them at an elegant ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10 the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 together with five other Nobel winners. The sixth one, the peace prize, is handed out in Oslo, Norway on the same day.\n\n___\n\n8:15 a.m.\n\nTwo Nobel Prizes in literature â one for 2019 and one for last year â will be announced Thursday after the 2018 literature award was postponed following sex abuse allegations that had rocked the Swedish Academy.\n\nThe chemistry prize went Wednesday to three scientists for their work leading to the development of lithium-ion batteries. That was a day after the physics award was given to a Canadian-American and two Swiss, and on Monday the Physiology or Medicine award went to two Americans and one British scientist.\n\nSo far, nine Nobel prizes have been awarded this week and all the laureates are men.\n\nThe coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\n___\n\nRead more stories on the 2019 Nobel Prizes by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/NobelPrizes\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
