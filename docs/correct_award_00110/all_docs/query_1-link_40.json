        "text": "(1923–2012). The Polish poet Wisława Szymborska was one of the preeminent European poets of the 20th century. Her ironic and imaginative poems earned her the Nobel prize in literature in 1996.\n\nWisława Szymborska was born in a town near Poznań in 1923. When she was eight, she moved with her parents to the southern city of Kraków. World War II raged around her during her secondary school years.\n\nSzymborska studied sociology and Polish literature at Jagiellonian University, and by the time she was 22 she had published her first poem, Szukam słowa (I Seek the Word), in a Kraków newspaper. Three years later, in 1948, she was prepared to publish her first volume of poetry, but the communist government deemed the material unfit for publication. Although there was nothing specifically anticommunist in the poems, they were not sufficiently procommunist and anticapitalist in the eyes of the censors.\n\nThe young poet revised her writing style and in 1952 published her first collection, Dlatego żyjemy (That’s Why We Are Alive). These poems pleased the political powers with their anti-Western tone. Szymborska later denounced Dlatego żyjemy, along with a 1954 collection entitled Pytania zadawane sobie (Questions Put to Myself), as misguided attempts to conform to socialist realism.\n\nSzymborska’s true potential was first evident in Wołanie do Yeti (Calling Out to Yeti), a collection published in 1957. These poems dealt with political and historical themes as well as more personal topics of love and relationships. With Sól (1962; Salt) and Sto pociech (1967; No End of Fun), Szymborska established her place in the Polish poetry tradition.\n\nIrony and an existentialist tone characterized Szymborska’s work, which continued in the next decade with the publication of Wszelki wypadek (1972; Could Have) and Wielka liczba (1976; A Large Number). Her poetry defied classification: it probed the nature of love and loss without being sentimental, satirized politics without seeming cynical, and asked philosophical questions without pretension. Although Szymborska’s themes were weighty, she approached them with an extraordinary freshness and even humor.\n\nIn addition to critical acclaim, Szymborska earned popular support, especially in her own country. The 10,000 copies of Wielka liczba printed in its first edition were sold out in one week. In part because of the difficulty of translating her writing style, however, Szymborska’s poetry was not readily available in other languages until later in her career.\n\nIn 1986 Szymborska’s Ludzie na moście (translated into English as People on a Bridge, 1990) was published, followed by Koniec i początek (The End and the Beginning) in 1993. In 1996, at the age of 73, Szymborska won the Nobel prize in literature. With characteristic modesty, she commented that she was “very happy, stunned, and frightened” when she heard the news. Szymborska died on February 1, 2012, in Kraków, Poland."
