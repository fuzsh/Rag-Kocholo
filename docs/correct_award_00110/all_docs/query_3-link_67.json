        "text": "The sonnet, or ‘small song,’ arose in 13th-century Italy. It was successfully transplanted into English, through the supple voice of Thomas Wyatt, well before the birth of William Shakespeare. In Eastern Europe, however, the sonnet flowered much later. In Polish in particular, when it finally appeared, it met both popular acclaim and stiff-necked critical resistance. So the sonnet in Polish is, or can be, even now, a contentious and lively form. Tomasz Rózycki’s sonnet sequence Kolonie (Colonies), first published in Polish in 2006, demonstrates this clearly. In Mira Rosenthal’s translation of this work, English-speaking readers can themselves confront the sonnet as something supple, fresh and a little bit strange. Rózycki’s quirky and self-deprecating humour permeates the poems. So does his sense of the fundamental homelessness of 21st-century human beings. Nine of these 77 sonnets begin with some variation on the line ‘When I began to write, I didn’t know …’ and blossom into wry and hilarious reflections on the writing life. Others exude a heart-rending nostalgia for a world that is constantly being translated from meaning into money, and thus constantly destroyed.\n\nWhen I began to write, I didn’t know\n\nwho would be waiting for it. In the window,\n\na curtain hangs unmoved, a mess spreads on the floor:\n\nloose change, CDs, an unmade bed, the entrails\n\nof night. Signs of a struggle, deserted.\n\nSomeone left traces on these cups, this carpet,\n\nsomeone bled out from self-inflicted wounds,\n\nsigned his name backwards, backwards. At this mirror,\n\na face, a face bit someone, a world leapt\n\nfrom the other side, whole, identical\n\nbut in reverse. It occupied the best\n\nplaces tonight and settled back to rest,\n\nand no one sees it’s false. Winter comes slowly,\n\nfrost pricks the window, pricks it and draws blood.\n\nSince it is lucky you are strange and I\n\nam strange, together we will shock the world.\n\nFamilies strolling by will stare and point,\n\nand we’ll be famous, quite mysterious.\n\nThey’ll even make up complicated plots\n\nin films about us, all untrue. At night,\n\nin mid-December, we will find ourselves\n\na hiding place where we’ll make love and have\n\nno other worries. We were meant to meet\n\nin such a huge world, we are singled out\n\nby language. Stick out your tongue for me, kitten.\n\nI’ll tell you a story. Luckily we’re\n\ntogether now, but language will betray us\n\nand kill our world, turn it to dew and ash.\n\nTo Barbara\n\nHow lightly we live! Just beyond the horizon\n\nan old volcano, thought inactive, lets off smoke.\n\nThey tell us time’s about to burst, same as before,\n\nneighbors are packing, they’re closing the roads,\n\nwe wake to find signs painted on our doors,\n\nbut we keep living lightly. Time so many times\n\nwould’ve caught us but couldn’t, we kept changing form.\n\nWhen time surged forth like lava, we became outlines,\n\nwhen it blew up, we crawled into the earth,\n\nwhen it turned trainlike, we became ash cloud,\n\nwhen it turned sniper, we became but breath,\n\na feather above the rubble heap, a voice calling out\n\nfor the kids to come home. We’re the letter excised\n\nfrom a verdict already passed. The slow dance of flecks\n\nwhen furniture is moved, the joyful subsiding\n\nof dust as it falls, we are the star of its journey.\n\nI took a trip to Ukraine. It was June.\n\nI waded in the fields, all full of dust\n\nand pollen in the air. I searched, but those\n\nI loved had disappeared below the ground,\n\ndeeper than decades of ants. I asked\n\nabout them everywhere, but grass and leaves\n\nhave been growing, bees swarming. So I lay down,\n\nface to the ground, and said this incantation —\n\nyou can come out, it’s over. And the ground,\n\nand moles and earthworms in it, shifted, shook,\n\nkingdoms of ants came crawling, bees began\n\nto fly from everywhere. I said come out,\n\nI spoke directly to the ground and felt\n\nthe field grow vast and wild around my head.\n\nAt night three elements enjoy our bodies.\n\nFire, water, air. One moment you’re water\n\nthen air the next, but flame encircles all.\n\nAt night we are reduced, small bits of tar,\n\nsoot on our skins, in cups. A storm enters\n\nthe room and clouds the mirror. There are others\n\nfrom far away who look on us as food,\n\nthey eat and drink. They find each orifice\n\nand enter us. Our bodies then become\n\nthe final element of earth and turn\n\nto ash, dust, coal, compost where insects live\n\nand snails leave tracks you ask about at dawn.\n\nOnce, at the world’s end, I threw a stone into\n\nthe open mouth of hell; I can’t complain."
