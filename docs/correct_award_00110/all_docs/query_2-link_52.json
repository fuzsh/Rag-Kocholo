        "text": "The Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, who won the 1996 Nobel Prize in literature, is a canny ironist and rapturous skeptic. She writes a poetry of sardonic individualism, and comes at common\n\nexperiences from her own angle, with her own perspective. \"Four billion people on this earth,/but my imagination is still the same,\" she confesses in her poem \"A Large Number\"; \"It’s bad with large numbers./It’s still taken by particularity.\" Szymborska is all too aware of how the world keeps escaping our various formulations about it: \"But even a Dante couldn’t get it right,\" she admits, \"Let alone someone who is not./Even with all the muses behind me.\"\n\nDespite her modesty, Szymborska has mounted in her work a witty and tireless defense of individual subjectivity against collectivist thinking, and her poems are slyly subversive in a way that compels us to reconsider received opinion. No sooner does a familiar idea come her way than she starts turning it around to see what it will look like from different directions. She manages to question herself even as she exposes general assumptions and undermines political cant. Indeed, the rejection of dogma becomes the premise of a thoughtful personal ethics.\n\nSzymborska was born in 1923 in the small town of Bnin in the Pozman area of western Poland. She moved with her family to Kraków when she was eight years old and has lived there ever since. She attended school illegally during the German occupation, when the Nazis banned Polish secondary schools and universities, and after the war studied Polish literature and sociology at Jagiellonian University. From 1952 to 1981, she worked on the editorial staff of the cultural weekly Zycie Literackie (Literary Life). She has published nine collections of poems and several editions of her selected verse, as well as a volume of newspaper reviews and columns. She is also known to Polish readers as a distinguished translator of French poetry, mostly of the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nSzymborska came of age during World War II, and spent much of her life under Stalinism. Thus she saw her country twice destroyed. She shares with Zbigniew Herbert and Tadeusz Rózewicz—the two other major Polish poets of the half-generation after Czeslaw Milosz—an absolute distrust of rhetoric, of false words and sentiments, of political creeds and ideologies, of general ideas and philosophies. The war was such a traumatic event for the writers of this generation that it called all moral and aesthetic values into question and, in a sense, poetry had to be rebuilt from the ground up, like the country itself. Hence, these poets have deliberately cultivated a cool, economical, and antirhetorical style, writing a stripped-down poetry of drastic simplicity. For these poets, stylistic clarity became a matter (and a form) of ethics, a response to ideological obfuscations, political double talk.\n\nSzymborska is a philosophically oriented poet who raises universal subjects nonchalantly, with an offhand charm. She typically begins a poem with a question or a simple paradoxical assertion which the poem breezily sets out to explore. Her strategy is to run through all the ramifications of an idea to see what it will yield. Often she begins by seeming to embrace a subject and ends by undercutting it with a sharp, disillusioned comment. For example, in the poem \"Children of Our Age,\" she takes a common assertion—\"We are children of our age,/it’s a political age\"—and examines it until it begins to leak and fall apart. She tries to find the human being— the human reality—obscured by political dogma.\n\nMeanwhile, people perished,\n\nanimals died,\n\nhouses burned,\n\nand the fields ran wild\n\njust as in times immemorial\n\nand less political.\n\nOne key to Szymborska’s style may be the way she works subversive variations on familiar rhetoric.\n\nSzymborska’s poems—wise, funny, and personal—have the sting of long experience. She looks at the world with the eye of a disabused lover and understands something fundamental about our century. In the poem \"Hatred,\" she writes, \"See how efficient it still is,/how it keeps itself in shape—/our century’s hatred.\" In \"The Century’s Decline,\" she writes, \"Our twentieth-century was going to improve on the others\":\n\nA couple of problems weren’t going\n\nto come up anymore:\n\nhunger, for example,\n\nand war, and so forth.\n\nThere was going to be respect\n\nfor helpless people’s helplessness,\n\ntrust, that kind of stuff.\n\nAnyone who planned to enjoy the world\n\nis now faced\n\nwith a hopeless task.\n\nYet Szymborska’s bitterness about human fallibility—human cruelty— mingles with her sense of the world’s unfathomable richness. Despite the odds, she finds herself enjoying the world after all, revitalized by commonplace miracles, by what she calls in one poem \"miracle fair\": fluttering white doves, a small cloud upstaging the moon, mild winds turning gusty in a hard storm, the inescapable earth. In the end, she pits her dizzying sense of the world’s transient splendor against unbearable historical knowledge. Or, as she puts it: \"My identifying features/are rapture and despair.\"\n\nThe Joy of Writing\n\nWhy does this written doe bound through these written woods?\n\nFor a drink of written water from a spring\n\nwhose surface will xerox her soft muzzle?\n\nWhy does she lift her head; does she hear something?\n\nPerched on four slim legs borrowed from the truth,\n\nshe pricks up her ears beneath my fingertips.\n\nSilence—this word also rustles across the page\n\nand parts the boughs\n\nthat have sprouted from the word \"woods.\"\n\nLying in wait, set to pounce on the blank page,\n\nare letters up to no good,\n\nclutches of clauses so subordinate\n\nthey’ll never let her get away.\n\nEach drop of ink contains a fair supply\n\nof hunters, equipped with squinting eyes behind their sights,\n\nprepared to swarm the sloping pen at any moment, s\n\nurround the doe, and slowly aim their guns.\n\nThey forget that what’s here isn’t life.\n\nOther laws, black on white, obtain.\n\nThe twinkling of an eye will take as long as I say,\n\nand will, if I wish, divide into tiny eternities,\n\nfull of bullets stopped in mid-flight.\n\nNot a thing will ever happen unless I say so.\n\nWithout my blessing, not a leaf will fall,\n\nnot a blade of grass will bend beneath that little hoof’s full stop.\n\nIs there then a world\n\nwhere I rule absolutely on fate?\n\nA time I bind with chains of signs?\n\nAn existence become endless at my bidding?\n\nThe joy of writing.\n\nThe power of preserving.\n\nRevenge of a mortal hand."
