        "text": "From Women on War:\n\nWislawa Szymborska (b. 1923) received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996. Born in Kornik, in Western Poland, where she continues to live, she was educated at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, in Polish literature and sociology. She is poetry editor of the prominent weekly journal Literary Life and has received many coveted awards for her 16 collections of poems. Szymborska is also a translator of French poetry. This poem answers all who suppose it is possible to be apolitical in precarious times.\n\nChildren of the Epoch\n\nby Wislawa Szymborska\n\nWe are the children of the epoch.\n\nThe epoch is political.\n\nAll my daily and nightly affairs,\n\nall your daily and nightly affairs,\n\nare political affairs.\n\nWhether you want it or not,\n\nyour genes have a political past,\n\nyour skin a political tone,\n\nyour eyes a political color,\n\nWhat you say resounds,\n\nwhat you don't say is also\n\npolitically significant.\n\nEven coming through the rye,\n\nyou walk with political steps\n\non political ground.\n\nApolitical poems are also political,\n\nand in the sky there's a moon\n\nthat's no longer moonlike.\n\nTo be or not to be, that is a question.\n\nOh darling, what a question, give a suggestion.\n\nA political question.\n\nYou don't have to be human\n\nto acquire a political meaning.\n\nIt's enough to be petroleum,\n\ncattle fodder, raw material.\n\nOr just a conference table whose shape\n\nwas disputed for months.\n\nIn the meantime, people were killed.\n\nAnimals died,\n\nhouses burned,\n\nfields grew wild,\n\nas in distant\n\nand less political epochs.\n\nTranslation Â© 1986 by Austin Flint"
