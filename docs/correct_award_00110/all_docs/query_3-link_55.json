Please join us for a poetry reading and discussion about the role of literature in dealing with the global crises that loom over our present and future!\n\nThe event “The Voice of ‘Nature Poetry’: A Meeting with Julia Fiedorczuk” will take place on Tuesday, February 20, in Ingraham Hall on the UW–Madison campus.
