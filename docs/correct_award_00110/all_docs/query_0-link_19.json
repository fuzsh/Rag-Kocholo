        "text": "A pair of glasses, a pen and a thank you card will now be added to the Nobel Prize Museum’s growing collection of artefacts related to the laureates. The museum already has such items as a handwritten manuscript from Albert Einstein and the shawl that peace prize laureate Malala Yousafzai wore when she gave a speech to the UN General Assembly.\n\nâWe always ask laureates who visit us to bring along an object that has meant something special to them. It helps us to convey their stories. Sometimes we also receive donations that are connected to laureates who are no longer alive,â says Erika Lanner. Director of the Nobel Prize Museum.\n\nDuring the ceremony the story behind the glasses was told. Szymborska did not use the glasses to read. Instead, she wore them to disguise herself when she went out. She was never photographed with her glasses on, so when she wore them she was difficult to recognise. They became a good form of protection against autograph hunters and admirers.Â\n\nThe objects have been selected by the WisÅawa Szymborska Foundation. PaweÅ Ruszkiewicz, Director of the Polish Institute in Stockholm, who hands over the artefacts shares the statement from the President of the WisÅawa Szymborska Foundation, MichaÅ Rusinek, who was also secretary to WisÅawa Szymborska from 1996 to 2012: “We are honoured that the Nobel Prize Museum will contain mementoes of WisÅawa Szymborska. We hope that they will attract the attention of visitors and perhaps make them interested in the poetry of the Nobel Prize laureate.”\n\nThe other two artefacts being donated to the museum are a ballpoint pen that Szymborska used to make corrections in her manuscripts and a thank you card. Szymborska spent a lot of time sending out thank you cards to everyone who congratulated her on the Nobel Prize.\n\nOn 19 November, the artefacts will be on display during an evening programme at the museum. Author Agneta Pleijel and cultural writer Stefan Ingvarsson will converse with Carin Klaesson of the Nobel Prize Museum about Szymborska. Their Swedish-language conversation will be followed by a concert featuring award-winning Polish pianist and composer Hania Rani, whose debut album âEsjaâ has attracted worldwide acclaim. The programme is made in cooperation with the Polish Institute in Stockholm.\n\nMore information is available at: https://nobelprizemuseum.se/en/a-poetic-tribute-to-wislawa-szymborska-a-concert-featuring-hania-rani/\n\nWisÅawa Szymborska was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature âfor poetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human realityâ. Szymborska was born in the city of Bnin (now KÃ³rnik), Poland in 1923 and died in KrakÃ³w in 2012. The WisÅawa Szymborska Foundation was established in April 2012 in accordance with the will of the laureate.\n\nÂ\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nRebecka OxelstrÃ¶m, Head of Press, Nobel Foundation\n\nrebecka.oxelstrom@nobelprize.org, +46 73 412 66 75"
