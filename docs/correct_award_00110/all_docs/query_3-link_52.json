        "text": "American poet Louise Glück has won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nThe award was announced by the Swedish Academy on Thursday at a news conference in Stockholm.\n\nThe Academy praised Glück ‘for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal’.\n\nGlück will receive 10 million Swedish kronor in prize money (over R18 million) along with a gold medal, courtesy of a bequest left 124 years ago by the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nDuring the announcement, the Academy’s permanent secretary Mats Malm confirmed he had spoken to Glück just before. ‘The message came as a surprise, but a welcome one as far as I could tell, early in the morning as it was,’ he said.\n\nGlück is the first woman poet to win the prize since the late Polish writer Wislawa Szymborska won the award in 1996. She becomes the sixteenth woman to win the Literature Nobel, and the first American woman since Toni Morrison’s win in 1993, twenty-seven years ago.\n\nGlück was born 1943 in New York and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She made her poetry debut in 1968 with Firstborn, and has since received several prestigious awards, among them the Pulitzer Prize (1993) and the National Book Award (2014). She is the author of twelve collections of poetry and several volumes of essays on poetry, and is professor of English at Yale University.\n\nThe Nobel Committee called Glück ‘a poet of radical change and rebirth, where the leap forward is made from a deep sense of loss’, and quoted from her poem ‘Snowdrops’, from her Pulitzer Prize-winning collection The Wild Iris (1992), in which she describes the miraculous return of life after winter:\n\nI did not expect to survive,\n\nearth suppressing me. I didn’t expect\n\nto waken again, to feel\n\nin damp earth my body\n\nable to respond again, remembering\n\nafter so long how to open again\n\nin the cold light\n\nof earliest spring—\n\nafraid, yes, but among you again\n\ncrying yes risk joy\n\nin the raw wind of the new world.\n\nAnders Olsson, Chairman of the Nobel Committee, notes of her books:\n\nAll are characterised by a striving for clarity. Childhood and family life, the close relationship with parents and siblings, is a thematic that has remained central with her. In her poems, the self listens for what is left of its dreams and delusions, and nobody can be harder than she in confronting the illusions of the self. But even if Glück would never deny the significance of the autobiographical background, she is not to be regarded as a confessional poet. Glück seeks the universal, and in this she takes inspiration from myths and classical motifs, present in most of her works. The voices of Dido, Persephone and Eurydice—the abandoned, the punished, the betrayed—are masks for a self in transformation, as personal as it is universally valid.\n\nWith collections like The Triumph of Achilles (1985) and Ararat (1990) Glück found a growing audience in USA and abroad. In Ararat three characteristics unite to subsequently recur in her writing: the topic of family life; austere intelligence; and a refined sense of composition that marks the book as a whole. Glück has also pointed out that in these poems she realized how to employ ordinary diction in her poetry. The deceptively natural tone is striking. We encounter almost brutally straightforward images of painful family relations. It is candid and uncompromising, with no trace of poetic ornament."
