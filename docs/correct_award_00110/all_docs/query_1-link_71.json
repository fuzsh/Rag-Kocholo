        "text": "Nobel-winning Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska died this week in her home city of Krakow at the age of 88.\n\nLittle known outside her home country, she was an intensely private person, unaccustomed to the spotlight, even called \"reclusive.\"\n\n\"Contemporary poets are skeptical and suspicious even, or perhaps especially, about themselves,\" she said during a lecture she gave in 1996 in Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize. \"They publicly confess to being poets only reluctantly, as if they were a little ashamed of it. But in our clamorous times it's much easier to acknowledge your faults, at least if they're attractively packaged, than to recognize your own merits, since these are hidden deeper and you never quite believe in them yourself.\"\n\nHer poetry was strongly influenced by the tumultuous events of her lifetime, from World War Two to Stalinism.\n\nHer poem, \"The End and the Beginning\" begins:\n\nAfter every war\n\nsomeone has to clean up.\n\nThings won't\n\nstraighten themselves up, after all.\n\nSomeone has to push the rubble\n\nto the sides of the road,\n\nso the corpse-laden wagons\n\ncan pass.\n\nSomeone has to get mired\n\nin scum and ashes,\n\nsofa springs,\n\nsplintered glass,\n\nand bloody rags.\n\nSomeone must drag in a girder\n\nto prop up a wall,\n\nSomeone must glaze a window,\n\nrehang a door.\n\nPhotogenic it's not,\n\nand takes years.\n\nAll the cameras have left\n\nfor another war.\n\nYet for all the gravity of her subjects, she remained \"an ironist,\" in the words of author David Orr, writing about life's ordinary things from sea cucumbers, house cats, and onions.\n\nShe ended her speech in Stockholm with a meditation on humanity's cosmic significance.\n\n\"The world - whatever we might think when terrified by its vastness and our own impotence, or embittered by its indifference to individual suffering, of people, animals, and perhaps even plants, for why are we so sure that plants feel no pain; whatever we might think of its expanses pierced by the rays of stars surrounded by planets we've just begun to discover, planets already dead? still dead? We just don't know; whatever we might think of this measureless theater to which we've got reserved tickets, but tickets whose lifespan is laughably short, bounded as it is by two arbitrary dates; whatever else we might think of this world - it is astonishing.\""
