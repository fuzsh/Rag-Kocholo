        "text": "Some People a poem by Wislawa Szymborska was referenced in my most recent read, The Far Field by Madhuri Vijay. The epigraph used the final stanza of the poem.\n\nPoem Hunter allowed me to read the poem in it’s entirety.\n\nSome people fleeing some other people.\n\nIn some country under the sun\n\nand some clouds.\n\nThey leave behind some of their everything,\n\nsown fields, some chickens, dogs,\n\nmirrors in which fire now sees itself reflected.\n\nOn their backs are pitchers and bundles,\n\nthe emptier, the heavier from one day to the next.\n\nTaking place stealthily is somebody's stopping,\n\nand in the commotion, somebody's bread somebody's snatching\n\nand a dead child somebody's shaking.\n\nIn front of them some still not the right way,\n\nnor the bridge that should be\n\nover a river strangely rosy.\n\nAround them, some gunfire, at times closer, at times farther off,\n\nand, above, a plane circling somewhat.\n\nSome invisibility would come in handy,\n\nsome grayish stoniness,\n\nor even better, non-being\n\nfor a little or a long while.\n\nSomething else is yet to happen, only where and what?\n\nSomeone will head toward them, only when and who,\n\nin how many shapes and with what intentions?\n\nGiven a choice,\n\nmaybe he will choose not to be the enemy and\n\nleave them with some kind of life.\n\nTranslated by Joanna Trzeciak.\n\nBut then I realised there were more translation options thrown up by my search.\n\nWhich was exciting, as it led me to the 1996 translation by Stanislaw Baranczak and Clare Cavanagh in the New Republic Magazine, December 30, 1996 issue.\n\nThere are subtle differences between the two, but I find the second translation below more graphic, grittier somehow. The aggression and menace feels smoothed over in the version above.\n\nI’m fascinated by the different meaning given to the line about the mirror. One mirror merely reflects – passively, while the other preens – showing off the fire in a far more active way.\n\nIn the final stanza we have the choice between someone coming at us (aggressive choice of words) or someone heading towards us (which sounds calmer and less threatening). But is this final choice ‘given’ or only an ‘if’? The first poem assume a choice is possible, the second poem is less certain that any choice will be possible.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the translation below.\n\nSome people flee some other people.\n\nIn some country under a sun\n\nand some clouds.\n\nThey abandon something like all they’ve got,\n\nsown fields, some chickens, dogs,\n\nmirrors in which fire now preens.\n\nTheir shoulders bear pitchers and bundles.\n\nThe emptier they get, the heavier they grow.\n\nWhat happens quietly: someone’s dropping from exhaustion.\n\nWhat happens loudly: someone’s bread is ripped away,\n\nsomeone tries to shake a limp child back to life.\n\nAlways another wrong road ahead of them,\n\nalways another wrong bridge\n\nacross another oddly reddish river.\n\nAround them, some gunshots, now nearer, now farther away,\n\nabove them a plane sort of circles.\n\nSome invisibility would come in handy,\n\nsome grayish stoniness,\n\nor, better yet, some nonexistence\n\nfor a shorter or a longer while.\n\nSomething else will happen, only where and what.\n\nSomeone will come at them, only when and who,\n\nin how many shapes, with what intentions.\n\nIf he has a choice,\n\nmaybe he won’t be the enemy\n\nand will let them live some sort of life.\n\nMaria Wisława Anna Szymborska was born in Poland on the 2nd July 1923. She died on the 1st February 2012. Maria lived most of her life in Kraków. She published her first poem in March 1945. Her early work supported the official Socialist Realism ideology, of all art serving the revolutionary cause, she also became a member of the Polish United Workers Party (PZPR).\n\nBy the late 50’s though, Maria had become disillusioned by communist politics and sought out new friendships with dissidents, officially leaving the Communist Party in 1966. She later renounced all her Stalin-era work.\n\nIn 1996 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature “for poetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human reality.” War and terrorism were her most common themes.\n\nAfter her death, the Wisława Szymborska Award (an annual international literature prize presented by the Wisława Szymborska Foundation) was established in 2013. It is awarded to authors for the best poetry work published the previous year.\n\nIn Oct 1998 Helen Vendler in NY Books, Staring Through the Stitches, wrote that Szymborska’s poem, Some People,\n\nIs a list; she likes lists. It is rigorous; she believes in facing the truth. It involves social experience; life for her is rarely one of individual isolation…. It is both objective and subjective, both documentary and empathetic…. Her restless skepticism questions a categorical statement even as she makes it.\n\nAnd finally, a note on the translation, also from NY Books. Edward Hirsch’s Subversive Activities, 18th April 1996:\n\nSzymborska comes through well in translation, but Baranczak and Cavanagh are the first to convey the full force of her fierce and unexpected wit. Their versions reproduce the rhythm and rhyme schemes of some of her early poems. They have come up with deft equivalents for her pervasive wordplay, and have recreated the jaunty, precise, deceptively casual free verse of her late work.\n\nI agree with Ed!"
