        "text": "Way of Life (of Poetry)\n\n“Wisława Szymborska didn’t like anniversaries,” says Michał Rusinek, “but we simply must commemorate her being awarded the Nobel Prize 20 years ago.” How should we do it? Modestly and elegantly, of course.\n\nCelebrations of the 20th Anniversary of Wisława Szymborska winning the Nobel Prize start with the opening of the exhibition of works by Joanna Helander Joy of Writing/Joy of Photography on 3 October. The Wyspiański Pavilion presents a collection of rarely seen photos revealing moments behind the scenes during the poet’s visit to Sweden in 1996, and her portraits from different years. On 11 and 12 October, the venue hosts the academic conference Szymborska. Twenty Years After the Nobel Prize co-organised by the Faculty of Polish Studies at the Jagiellonian University and the Wisława Szymborska Foundation. Guests will attempt to summarise the poet’s incredible mark on culture and common imagination, not just in Poland. She is incredibly popular in Italy, as revealed in the exhibition Wisława Szymborska. Life in Pictures organised by the Italian Institute at Pracownia Pod Baranami. We will see watercolours illustrating Alice Milani’s graphic novel dedicated to the Nobel laureate. Meeting with the author and the exhibition vernissage are held on 19 October.\n\nIgor Kuranda, Karnet magazine\n\nAdmission free to all events"
