        "text": "Wisława Szymborska (born July 2, 1923, Bnin [now part of Kórnik], Poland—died February 1, 2012, Kraków) was a Polish poet whose intelligent and empathic explorations of philosophical, moral, and ethical issues won her the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996.\n\nSzymborska’s father was the steward on a count’s family estate. When she was eight, the family moved to Kraków, and she attended high school there. Between 1945 and 1948 she studied literature and sociology at Kraków’s Jagiellonian University. Her first published poem, “Szukam słowa” (“I Seek the Word”), appeared in a Kraków newspaper in March 1945. Dlatego żyjemy (1952; “That’s Why We Are Alive”), her first volume of poetry, was an attempt to conform to Socialist Realism, the officially approved literary style of Poland’s communist regime. In 1953 she joined the editorial staff of Życie Literackie (“Literary Life”), a weekly magazine of intellectual interests, and remained there until 1981. During this period she gained a reputation not only as a poet but also as a book reviewer and translator of French poetry. In the 1980s she wrote for the underground press under the pseudonym Stanczykówna and also wrote for a magazine in Paris.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPoetry: First Lines"
