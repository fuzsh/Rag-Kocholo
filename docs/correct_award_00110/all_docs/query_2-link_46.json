        "text": "Transcript:\n\nHello, and welcome to Poetry Soup! I’m your host, Emma Catherine Hoff. Each episode, I’ll discuss a different poem and poet. In this episode, I’ll be talking about the human race — which is, apparently, no end of fun.\n\nThe great Polish poet, Wisława Szymborska, once said, “I prefer the absurdity of writing poems to the absurdity of not writing poems.” Lucky for her, she has written many amazing poems, and today I’ll be talking about one of her best works, titled “No End of Fun.”\n\nWisława Szymborska was born on July 2, 1923 in Prowent, Poznań Voivodeship, Poland, which is now Kórnik, Poland. When her father died, her family moved to Torun and then Krakow, where she spent the rest of her life. Wisława Szymborska was a staff member of a literary review magazine called Życie Literackie (which means Literary Life). She was a poet, essayist, and translator. In 1996, she was given the Nobel Prize in Literature. Much of her work is centered around history and war, for example, in her poem “Hitler’s First Photograph,” she ironically uses ultra-sweet language to describe Adolf Hitler as a baby.\n\nNow I’m going to read “No End of Fun.” In this satirical poem, you learn how strange humans are, and how, in some cases, we are to be pitied.\n\nSo he's got to have happiness,\n\nhe's got to have truth, too,\n\nhe's got to have eternity\n\ndid you ever!\n\nHe has only just learned to tell dreams from waking;\n\nonly just realized that he is he;\n\nonly just whittled with his hand né fin\n\na flint, a rocket ship;\n\neasily drowned in the ocean's teaspoon,\n\nnot even funny enough to tickle the void;\n\nsees only with his eyes;\n\nhears only with his ears;\n\nhis speech's personal best is the conditional;\n\nhe uses his reason to pick holes in reason.\n\nIn short, he's next to no one,\n\nbut his head's full of freedom, omniscience, and the Being\n\nbeyond his foolish meat—\n\ndid you ever!\n\nFor he does apparently exist.\n\nHe genuinely came to be\n\nbeneath one of the more parochial stars.\n\nHe's lively and quite active in his fashion.\n\nHis capacity for wonder is well advanced\n\nfor a crystal's deviant descendant.\n\nAnd considering his difficult childhood\n\nspent kowtowing to the herd's needs,\n\nhe's already quite an individual indeed—\n\ndid you ever!\n\nCarry on, then, if only for the moment\n\nthat it takes a tiny galaxy to blink!\n\nOne wonders what will become of him,\n\nsince he does in fact seem to be.\n\nAnd as far as being goes, he really tries quite hard.\n\nQuite hard indeed—one must admit.\n\nWith that ring in his nose, with that toga, that sweater.\n\nHe's no end of fun, for all you say.\n\nPoor little beggar.\n\nA human, if ever we saw one.\n\n“No End of Fun” is the last poem in Szymborska’s 1967 collection by the same name. Szymborska begins her poem by talking about how humans desire so much. She writes how humans want everything — happiness, truth, and eternity. The ironic outside narrator, who is both Szymborska and some sort of extraterrestrial being, uses the words “did you ever!” three times throughout the poem to express disgust and surprise. This narrator appreciates the humans in the confines of their foolishness. The humans are like the country bumpkins of the universe, born beneath one of the “more parochial stars.”\n\nSzymborska repeats the exclamation of “did you ever!” three times in her poem. Then, in the end, she switches to, “if ever we saw one,” reinforcing the feeling of shock that we feel in the poem — how is it possible for us to even exist? She also comments on how young the human race really is, how quickly it will end, and how ignorant it is. According to Szymborska, man has “only just learned to tell dreams from waking.” Szymborska also writes, “a flint, a rocket ship;/easily drowned in the ocean’s teaspoon,/not even funny enough to tickle the void.” She shows that we’ve evolved so quickly, and yet we have so much more to explore and to do. She skips quickly through time here, and in the line, “with that ring in his nose, with that toga, that sweater.” Primitive man, ancient man, and modern man. The narrator uses this line to prove how old and wise it is. According to this cynical creature, human life spans are so short — you almost feel bad for them.\n\nThe title of this poem is “No End of Fun,” and yet, the poem is about how the human race will end. It is almost like humanity is judging itself, and Szymborska is judging us, too. This poem makes us feel uncomfortable — most people would rather not think about these things. The poem is funny, but it’s also depressing. Szymborska shows that, compared to the rest of the universe, we’re really small and young — and that there could always be something out there that’s laughing at us.\n\nThat was “No End of Fun” by Wislawa Szymborska. Maybe one day, you’ll meet a cynical alien just like the one she describes. I hope you enjoyed this episode of Poetry Soup, and I’ll see you soon with the next one!"
