        "text": "Szymborska was born in Poland on July 2, 1923--one of the 20th Century's most inauspicious times and places. When living in Krakow at age sixteen, the armies of Nazi Germany invaded. Szymborska survived World War II working as a railroad employee to avoid deportation to Germany. After living through the biggest conflagration of the century, it is not surprising that history is a central theme in her work. But her oeuvre is not one of a typical World War II writer. Szymborksa's life was also defined by existing on the outside of the war, whether taking classes in secret or hiding from Nazi attention.\n\nThis life of ironic contradiction, living at once in the epicenter of a tempest and on its fringes, informs Szymborska's delicate treatment of frequently neglected poetic subjects. When the world and its apparent order become disturbed, simple and everyday matters are the most comforting. In her poetry, Szymborska writes from the voice of a cat whose owner has left, and finds an artistic muse in the splitting of a sea cucumber.\n\nA preoccupation with the overlooked distinguishes Szymborska's career. Not only is her attention turned to contemplative house pets, but to the souls neglected by memory and textbooks. In her collection Miracle Fair, in one of the finest lines about war in 20th Century literature, she writes: \"History counts its skeletons in round numbers. / A thousand and one remains a thousand, / As if the one had never existed.\""
