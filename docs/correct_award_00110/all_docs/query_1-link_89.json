Critics say she is both deeply political and witty, using humor in unexpected ways.\n\nThe citation described her as a ``Mozart of poetry,'' a woman who mixed elegance of language with ``the fury of Beethoven'' and who was not afraid to tackle serious subjects with levity.\n\nSzymborska's later poetry is revenge of sorts against her first two books, published in 1952 and 1954, both attempts to conform to social realism at a time when Communist censorship held sway over Poland.\n\nShe later disclaimed both books and became a critic of Josef Stalin.\n\nSzymborska's (sheem-BOR-skah) books which are available in English include ``View With a Grain of Sand,'' ``People on a Bridge'' and ``Sounds, Feelings, Thoughts: Seventy Poems.''\n\nby CNB"
