        "text": "Here is the last of my forays into Polish literary history. Like the pieces previously posted in this space (on Wisława Szymborska and Biernat of Lublin), and published in The Polish Review, this was written as a course work for my Harvard professor in Polish language and literature, Stanisław Barańczak. (An interview I did with Barańczak on his work as a poet is also posted in this blog space.) If I did succeed in saying anything of value here, it is surely due to Barańczak’s tutelage. If I did not, he is obviously not to blame. Surely any deep context I provide originated in Barańczak’s lectures or personal comments to me. That does not mean I invested nothing in the piece – I did. I thoroughly enjoyed my work on Polish literature, and, in all my papers (Szymborska was still a long way from her Nobel Prize at that time), I purposefully sought to shine light on figures of some interest who are most often left in the shadows. That’s kind of a professional hobby I have had my entire life.\n\nJOHN FREEDMAN\n\nA PERIOD OF TRANSITION: BAROQUE HUMOR\n\nIN THE FRASZKI OF DANIEL NABOROWSKI1\n\nDaniel Naborowski, who lived from 1573 to 1640, belonged to one of the first generations of Polish poets to feel the complete weight of Jan Kochanowski’s influence. At the same time, the years of his maturity belonged to an age in which Poland had already entered a political decline. This development was reflected in an increasingly disharmonious poetic style which is known loosely in the history of Polish literature as the period of the Baroque. Like Kochanowski before him, Naborowski was the product of a liberal European education: he studied philology, medicine and law in such cities as Strasbourg, Heidelberg, Paris, and London, to name just a few, and for a short while, he was a student of Galileo in Padua. In Latin he published two articles on medicine in 1593 and 1594, and his first poetic work appears to have been an ode in Latin written for the benefit of an early benefactor, Rafał Leszczyński. Throughout his adult life, however, Naborowski was employed in the service of the Radziwiłł brothers, Janusz and Krzysztof, who were well-known political figures during the period of the counter-reformation. Naborowski’s poetry reflects the different atmospheres which reigned in these two court households. Janusz Radziwiłł, who died in 1620, presided over a court which was more colorful than that of his brother Krzysztof, who was something of an aesthete and religious fanatic. While the Polish scholar Jan Dürr-Durski held that Naborowski followed a logical path of evolution from a relatively care free, humorous writer in his younger days to a more philosophically oriented writer in his middle and late years, one might argue justifiably that Naborowski’s poetry was also influenced by more practical concerns. His work appears to have taken on the personality of his benefactor of the moment, perhaps revealing a man who, not entirely unlike the proverbial Chinese wise man, was a Taoist in his youth and a Confucian in his waning years. This is not to say that the change which occurred in Naborowski’s style as he developed over the years was insincere, for it was indeed also a poetic response to the worsening fate of the Calvinists, of whom he was an outspoken and devoted member late in his life.\n\nNaborowski’s humorous verses tend to answer to the common definition of a baroque poem in that they are, to use Dürr-Durski’s words, dynamic, painterly, and sensual. It is not until his later poetry that a sense of moralism mixed with metaphysical dissonance reminiscent of that found in the poetry of Mikołaj Sęp-Szarzyński becomes predominant. It is this latter element which prompted Dürr-Durski to call Naborowski the consummate mannerist and which caused him to place Naborowski as a transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque. It is, however, the poetry primarily from the earlier period which will concern us here.2\n\nNaborowski published almost nothing during his lifetime, and it was not until the 19th century that isolated verses began to appear in collections and anthologies. The literary scholar Józef Plebański had plans to do a collection of his poetry in the late 1880s, but died before he could begin the project. The first large-scale collection of his poems appeared in 1910 and 1911 during the period which came to be known as the “era of manuscripts” when Aleksander Brückner edited the two volumes of Wirydarz poetycki (A Garden of Poetry). This book largely duplicated a personał manuscript which had been compiled by Jakub Trembecki in the mid-1600s and which was maintained for many years after that in personal libraries.vWith a few exceptions, critical attention paid to Naborowski’s verse has been slight. It would appear that the first published critical reference to him was that of H. Klimaszewski in Noworocznik Litewski (Lithuanian New Year Publication) in 1831, after which his name began to show up occasionally in anthologies, and encyclopedic and bibliographical entries. The publication of Wirydarz poetycki in 1910-11 apparently did not stir any great interest in his work, and it was not until Wiktor Weintraub discussed him in two articles published in the 1930s that his work began to be considered in serious scholarly studies.3 Dürr-Durski published the first complete collection of his verse in 1961, and in 1966 he published a book entitled, Daniel Naborowski: Monografia z dziejów manieryzmu i baroku w Polsce (Daniel Naborowski: A Monograph on the History of Mannerism and the Baroque in Poland).4 Aside from this, Jarosław Rymkiewicz devoted a chapter to Naborowski in his work, Czym jest klasycyzm? (What is Classicism?),5 and Czesław Hernas devotes four pages to him in his book Barok (The Baroque).6 Most other studies either give Naborowski a token nod, or ignore him altogether. Of those few critics who have tackled Naborowski’s work, the primary focus has usually been on his letters, his translations, or his “serious” poetry, while little has been said about his short, humorous fraszki (occasionally referred to in English as “trifles”), some of which were clever and pithy enough to enter the common stock of Polish folklore.7\n\nMuch of the humor in Naborowski’s fraszki is of an erotic nature, although Dürr-Durski reminds us that the mores of the society in which they were written were such that the verses were certainly not viewed as obscene or pornographic either by Naborowski or by his courtly audience, and that such poetry had not yet been classified as unaesthetic or sinful. This was not the case with succeeding generations, during which unknown prudish hands saw fit to destroy several of his fraszki over the years. Some of this censorship was probably also due to Arian hostility for the works of a Calvinist author. Even Aleksander Brckner felt compelled to edit him when preparing Wirydarz poetycki for print.8 Naborowski tends to rely on a limited range of themes and situations to achieve his comic effects. Love and sex—both explicit and implicit—drinking bouts and haggard old women are popular starting points. There are occasional barbs poked at friends or rivals, and poetry itself is an infrequent theme of his humor. Naborowski expressed his attitude on the nature of fraszki in the short epigrammatic poem appropriately entitled “O fraszkach” (On Fraszki):\n\nWłaśnie jakby też chciał mieć kto bez dusze ciało,\n\nKto chce, by się nic złego w wiersze nie pisało.9\n\n(A man who thinks that rhymes should never smart\n\nis like the man who wants a body with no heart.)\n\nIn fact, Naborowski’s humor—not unlike Mikołaj Rej’s, whose sensibilities were firmly rooted in the medieval tradition—is frequently homespun andrough-hewn, both thematically and structurally. Naborowski’s fraszki, like Kochanowski’s, are situational, but his work nonetheless differs from that of the great renaissance poet in that it is more rooted in the reality of the immediate present and it is more overtly self-conscious. We find an example of this in the poem “Żart dworski” (A Court Joke). The punch line of this “joke,” to use Naborowski’s wording, relies on a rather clumsy, forced pun which arises in the interchangeability of a female character’s last name, Pieczonka, with a diminutive of the Polish word for roast meat. When a guest invited to a feast arrives late, he is asked what he’d like to have. Without hesitating, he replies, “I’d be happy to take that pieczonka there,” and then quickly takes a piece of meat from the serving dish. This poem is typical of Naborowski’s output for several reasons. First, the humor depends on word play. Second, the play on words involves a proper noun which doubles as a significant word at some crucial point in the poem. This device can be observed frequently in other of Naborowski’s poems, such as “Droga z Litwy do Prus” (The Road from Lithuania to Prussia), “Data” (which in the Polish language of the 17th century could have meant either “The Date” or “The Bribe”), “Na pana Sledzia” (about Mr. Herring) and others. Third, as in many of his fraszki, the milieu is nearly always recognizable as that of the petty Polish gentry. Themes are almost always earthy, not necessarily in an erotic sense, but in the sense that there is usually no effort made to touch on transcendent themes. While this is not true in a few isolated cases,10 the exceptions form a distinct minority in the bulk of Naborowski’s humorous verse. On the other hand, the poetry which was written later during Naborowski’s tenure at the court of Krzysztof Radziwiłł, is frequently moralistic and judgmental of mundane, everyday concerns. His humorousfraszki tend, in large part, to be celebrations of common human concerns and earthly pleasures.\n\nThere is in this vein a delightful series of epigrams about the simple pleasures of the bathhouse. The humor here derives from a sort of absurd obviousness in the poet’s observations which reminds one of the repetitive epigrams by the Russian composite author Koz’ma Prutkov in the 19th century. The series consists of a single quatrain entitled “Na nagie obrazy w łaźni” (On Naked Figures in a Steam Bath), followed by four couplets entitled “Item,” all of which elaborate on the original point. In these epigrams the poet stubbornly defends his right to lie about naked in his own bathhouse, regardless of what this may cause others to think of him. At one point a guest is shocked to happen upon the nude poet, who responds in the following way:\n\nGościu, chciej mi powiedzieć, proszę, swoje zdanie,\n\nCo byś wolał, czy żyw, czy to malowanie?\n\n(So tell me, guest, your thinking on this matter:\n\nDo you prefer the real thing or something in a picture?)\n\nWe find in such poems elements of an emerging archetype of the simple and conservative mentality which would come to flourish during the Sarmatian Baroque, and which was so colorfully expressed in Jan Pasek’s Pamiętniki (Memoirs). We can easily picture many of the boisterous scenes from Naborowski’s verse as episodes in Pasek’s account of Polish life in the 17th century.\n\nSome poems, such as “Smaczny kąsek” (A Tasty Morsel) or “Na kucharkę” (About a Cook), are merely descriptive of a mood or scene, while others, such as “Sąd Parysów” (The Trial of the Parises), describe ribald situations. This latter poem describes an evening of revelry among soldiers who spend a night at a tavern. When the tavern-keeper learns the next morning that the soldiers have seduced his wife with drink and have taken advantage of her, he demands that justice be done. But one of the soldiers steps forward and pleads his comrades’ case before their superior, using his quick wit to absolve them of guilt. Following is this advocate’s dubious, but successful, defense:\n\nJa powiem, kto był winien, a kogo nie winić.\n\nPrzyszedł Szmuklerz, dał złoty, nie mógł nic uczynić.\n\nDziurdzi dał pół złotego, raz seremak sprawił,\n\nPeter Dyjak nic nie dał, a siedmkroć odprawił.\n\nCzy Peter Dyjak winien, rozsądźcie to sami.\n\nProsim, panie rachmistru, daj dekret za nami.\n\n(I’ll tell you who is guilty and who is not:\n\nOne soldier, Szmuklarz, gave a złoty; got for naught.\n\nAnother, Dziurdzi, paid her less but took her more;\n\nPeter Dyjak gave her nil for seven rolls across the floor.\n\nThere’s the story, captain, tell us true,\n\nCan you say that Peter’s broken any rules?)\n\nIt is ultimately decided that the soldiers have taken nothing that wasn’t offered them, that the wife has suffered nothing from this crime, and that the only thing to do is add three notches to the cuckolded husband’ s horns. The enduring value of this verse, and others similar to it, is not be found in the stereotyped plot, but in the intellectual gymnastics performed by the poet. The plot here, such as it is, merely provides Naborowski with an opportunity to engage in sophistry and the manipulation of words to create a clever turn of phrase. In such poems Naborowski gives a greater significance to the telling of the tale than to the actual tale itself.\n\nThe poem “About a Cook” is little more than a clever joke in which a group of men at table debate which is better, a male or a female cook. It is shortly resolved that a female cook is best, since after she has served the food, she still has something to offer. The poem “A Tasty Morsel” is perhaps more interesting in that it maintains a certain poetic tension by attempting to express something which the poet does not want to address openly: that is, the beauty of a certain element of a young woman’s body. Although young women hide this “tasty morsel,” as he calls it, the poet states that he has “seen the one that Anna has.” He then goes on to say:\n\nŻeby był czarką, piłbym pewnie z niego,\n\nBył towarzyszem, nie puszczałbym się go.\n\n(And if it were a goblet, I’d drink it to the lees,\n\nAnd if it were a comrade, I’d never let him leave.)\n\nNaborowski’s erotic poetry is notable for its natural acceptance of themes which would come to be considered uncouth by subsequent generations. “A Tasty Morsel,” in fact, was blackened out in the manuscript of Wirydarz poetycki, though fortunately, in such a way that it could be restored. One senses the same earth-bound sensibility in these erotic poems that is present in the senes about the bathhouse: that is, these are common, acceptable elements of everyday life which require no false modesty.\n\nNot all of Naborowski’s erotic poems repeat a traditional male-oriented point of view and in such cases the poet displays the same tolerance for several themes that is evident in his other work. The short poem “Pani” (A Lady) describes the aftermath of an interrupted love tryst between a society woman and her servant. The servant, who has been condemned to be drowned, calls out for his lover’s help, but she calmly refuses him:\n\nPani: “Już idź, boć moja łaska nie poradzi.\n\nPo smacznym kąsku wody napić się nie wadzi.”\n\n(Go on your way, my favor is no help to you.\n\nYou’ve had your treat, now have a drink of water, too.)\n\nIt is telling that Wacław Potocki later reworked and expanded this theme in a poem entitled “Smaczny kęsek” (A Tasty Morsel—not to be confused with Naborowski’s fraszka of the same name) in the collection Jovialities, where he exploited the opportunity to provide a moral lesson. Naborowski, however, avoids moralizing. The sexual act is not encumbered by thoughts of morality, and the woman’ s detachment from the role she has played in her lover’s demise is presented without comment on the part of the poet. It should not be forgotten, of course, that her behavior may well have been presented differently had her partner also been a member of the gentry.\n\nAnother poem with a similar point of view is a reworking of an epigram by the English poet, John Owen, whose work Naborowski plumbed for material on more than one occasion. Entitled “O paniej” (About a Lady), the poem describes a woman’s visit to the doctor:\n\nJedna pani a młoda pytała doktora,\n\nKiedyby … z rana czy z wieczora?\n\nDoktor niewiele myślc tak paniej odpowie:\n\nZ wieczora miłość—radość, a po ranu—zdrowie.\n\n(A certain young lady once queried her doctor:\n\n“When is the best time, is it morning or after?”\n\nThe doctor replied after thinking a spell:\n\n“At night for pleasure and love; and morning for health.”)\n\nNaborowski’s tolerance does not preclude his also exercising a sharp satirical tongue. His long poem “Do złej baby” (To an Evil Old Woman) chooses a common object of scorn, and reads much like the school-yard insults of the type, “May a thousand bees nest in your bonnet.” It is a rambling piece consisting of 429 words in 66 lines of insults which ends by ironically stating, “Straighten up old woman, or I’ll write 1000 evil words about you.” Though hardly a great work of poetic art, the poem is interesting for its self-conscious nature: The lines consist almost exclusively of lists of insults, more than half of which begin repetitively with the words “old woman.” Naborowski employs a similar technique of word repetition in the service of creating irony in a far shorter poem entitled “Zła żona” (Evil Wife). He would continue to use this poetic device of lists and repetitions in his later, more sophisticated, poetry as wel1.11 One of the finest and best-known examples of Naborowski’s poetry which is based on such poetic conceits is “Na oczy królewny angielskiej…” (On the Eyes of the English Queen), in which Naborowski stacks up descrip­tions of brilliant objects before concluding that the queen’s eyes are the most brilliant of them all. While this poem does not belong to his series of fraszki, there is a structural cross-current here which acts as a link between the different genres represented in Naborowski’s poetry. Words in such poems as these are often used more for achieving a visceral impact than for conveying real meaning. This kind of an attempt at word-play—that is, the elevation of words themselves to a primary role in the poem—will be brought to a much finer level of perfection in Jan Andrzej Morsztyn’s poetry.\n\nThe two poems about old women notwithstanding, Naborowski’s well-developed sense of fair play could extend even to this common object of scorn in his poetry. One delightful poem entitled “Odpowiedź baby” (Old Woman’s Reply) tells of a man in church who has finished his prayers and is preparing to kiss the earth, but is unable to because an old woman is standing so close to him. At his request to give him some room, the old woman pulls her dress over her back-side and says, “Tu mię całuj… i to ziemia, panie” (“Kiss me there, young man, this is earth, too”).\n\nThe poem “Łowy” (The Hunt), which has been described by Dürr-Durski as a love elegy, is one of the finest examples of Naborowski’s poetry. In terms of style and execution, it serves as a transition point in Naborowski’s work; it is not so much humorous as it is light-hearted. The poem derives its strength from the poet’s sense of irony and from the naïveté of the poem’s character which allow the verse to achieve a subtlety rarely present in Naborowski’s humorous poetry. Pastoral in nature, the tale recounts the adventures of a young man on a hunt in the woods with Cupid, the god of love. The hunters stalk their game until the young man finally tells Cupid to let fly his arrow. But rather than shoot the wild beast they are after, Cupid shoots his hunting partner instead. Although the poem is obviously about a young man falling in love, there is never any mention of the object of his affections, or even of love, save the symbolic role played by Cupid. The poem’s vocabulary consists almost exclusively of hunting terms and words describing the beauty of nature. As is the case in the best of Naborowski’s poems, the poetic tension is created by a turn of phrase, and by leaving the most important observations unspoken. When the poet returns home, he laments:\n\nJaz łowu, łowczy ubogi,\n\nW sercu niosę postrzał srogi.\n\n(I return from hunting, my game-bag bare,\n\nAnd carry in my heart a wound severe.)\n\nThough not in agreement about the ultimate significance of Naborowski’s work, Wiktor Weintraub and Jan Dürr-Durski showed that in his “serious” poetry, Naborowski relied heavily on models which had been created by Rabelais, Jan Kochanowski, Maciej Sarbiewski, and others. Jarosław Rymkiewicz, writing about Naborowski’s poem “On the Eyes of the English Queen,” pointed out that Naborowski “repeated” the poems of Honorat Laugier de Porchres, but he also went on to say that “repetition is not the same thing as imitation. Repetition is conscious in the 17th century, and Naborowski doesn’t hide the model because this is not what interests him.”12 Such a statement may also be applied to Naborowski’s humorous verse, for his place in the history of Polish literature is not determined by his thematic or structural innovations. Dürr-Durski has shown that Naborowski not only relied heavily on Kochanowski for his themes, but that his poetic execution was frequently derivative as well.11 Naborowski’s individuality—at least in his fraszki—is to be found in his slightly cruder tone of voice and poetic sensibility. It is here in his unassuming approach to common themes and homespun poetic style—referring back to the medieval tradition—and his penchant for word play, that fledgling elements of the Baroque can be discerned. As Poland’s international stature declined, its poets, Naborowski included, began to turn their poetic eye to more immediate, more enduring, elements of everyday life, whether it be the simple pleasure of enjoying one’s own bathhouse, or the self-conscious pursuit of manipulating words to create a pun. In the context of the development of Polish poetry over the course of the next century, we can see that Naborowski’ s poetry carried the seeds of a literature that would emerge later with a style of its own. In his fraszki Naborowski created a solid handful of cleverly constructed verses whose ability to capture vignettes of universal experience and whose importance in serving as a link between literary traditions has allowed them to withstand the test of time. Despite total neglect by readers and scholars for nearly three centuries, one now must recognize that Naborowski’s contribution to Polish literature was a valuable and permanent one.\n\n_________________\n\n1 This is a revised version of a paper delivered at the AAASS convention in New Orleans, November 22, 1986. I would like to acknowledge a debt of gratitude to Patricia Perrault for her valuable critical commentary of an early draft.\n\n2 For a brief look at Dürr-Durski’s definition of mannerism, see his posthumously published “Od manieryzmu do baroku,” Przeglqd Humanistyczny, z. 1 (1917) 1-17.\n\n3“Z dziejów Rabelais’go w Polsce” in Prace historyczno-literackie.

Any student of Naborowski’s poetry must acknowledge the importance of Dürr-Durski’s pioneering work. Despite the scholar’s occasional exaggeration of Naborowski’s importance, his study will remain the most fundamental of its kind for some time to come.\n\n5 (Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy: 1967). The chapter is entitled “Naborowski.”\n\n6 (Warszawa: Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1973).\n\n7 Cf. Czesław Miłosz, The History of Polish Literature (Berkeley: University of California, 1983) 134.\n\n8 Dürr-Durski notes in his monograph that while Bruckner apparently gathered together some of Naborowski’s previously uncollected verses and added them to his published text of Wirydarz poetycki, he also felt compelled to cut several of the verses which he perceived to be pornographic.\n\n9 This and subsequent quotations from Naborowski’s poetry may be found in Daniel Naborowski: Poezje (Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy: 1961) ed. Jan Dürr-Durski. All translations are my own.\n\n10 One exception of note is the epigram “Mądrość i rozkosz” (Wisdom and Pleasure) which draws parallels between pleasure and the pale light of the moon, and wisdom and the brightness of the sun.\n\n11 See for example “Krótkość żywota” (The Shortness of Life), “Cnota grunt wszytkiemu” (Virtue: The Foundation for Everything) and others.\n\n12Rymkiewicz, pp. 27, 29.\n\n13The final chapter of Dürr-Durski’s monograph is devoted in large part to discussing the parallels between Kochanowski’s and Naborowski’s fraszki.\n\nAn old-fashioned scholarly close reading, of which kind I have not written for about 30 years. I must say these old pieces make me somewhat uncomfortable these days. They are, in part, why I found a way out of academia way back when – it just wasn’t the way I wanted to respond to the world around me. That said, I put a lot into these pieces, I believed in them at the time that I wrote them. This article, published in The Polish Review, began its life as a course paper for one of Stanisław Barańczak’s courses in Polish literature at Harvard. He surely must take some credit for any kind of broad knowledge expressed about Polish culture and literature – I surely was leaning on his expertise in making generalized claims. Obviously, any mistakes or idiocies in my interpretation of Wisława Szymborska’s poem “A Great Number” are my own doing. This article was probably one of the first scholarly explorations of Szymborska’s poetry published in English – in any case, I didn’t find any others when I looked for commentary at the time of writing. Ten years later, in 1996, Szymborska was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.\n\nAs this was a scholarly article, there was no need to print the poem about which I wrote alongside what I wrote. The assumption (I guess) is that everyone interested would have access. If a stray reader has found their way to this page and wants to see the full poem in English, an anonymously translated version can be accessed on the Inward Bound Poetry blogsite. In preparing this text for publication here, I corrected several typos, reworded a sentence here and there, and moved the notes to the end of the text.\n\nTHE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF POETRY:\n\nWISLAWA SZYMBORSKA’S WIELKA LICZBA\n\nBy JOHN FREEDMAN\n\nThe Polish Review, Vol. XXXI Nos. 2-3, 1986: 137-147\n\n© 1986 The Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences\n\nWisława Szymborska’s poetry is — above all — marked by a striking universality which allows for widely variant readings. In his review of Szymborska’s 1976 collection, (1) A Great Number (Wielka liczba), Stanisław Barańczak primarily stressed the sociological aspect of her poetry as it is revealed in her use of language. Her language and images, he argues, are nearly always concrete and situational. In his introduction to her 1977 Poetry (Poezje), a retrospective collection, Jerzy Kwiatkowski, relying heavily on a vocabulary sprinkled with philosophical terminology, presents her primarily as an existentialist poet, though he does admit, (2) “…that doesn’t mean at all that Szymborska’s poetry is some kind of theoretical treatise on the various possibilities of the means of being laid out in verse.’’ Czesław Miłosz, who once wondered whether she might be a poet of limited range, now also ranks her as a philosophical poet whose “conciseness is matched only by Zbigniew Herbert.” (3) Szymborska maintains a much more modest appraisal of her own works. When asked in a 1975 interview to comment on the critics’ naming of her as an existential poet, she replied, “The label is flattering, but also disconcerting. I do not engage in great philosophy, only modest poetry.” (4) In fact, poetry itself — or to be more exact, the paradox of poetry’s possibilities and limitations — is frequently the focus of Szymborska’s work. She stated her creative approach to this in the same interview. After concurring with a dialog from Tacitus in which he claims that poetry has exhausted itself and its further development is impossible, she indicates — one detects an ironic glint of a smile in the comer of her eye — that much poetry is now being written on this very subject. She goes on to say, ‘‘When I hear about a crisis in art or music or the theater, I am inclined to believe it. But in poetry, where I myself endeavor to do something, there is still a great deal to be said.” (5) We will see that Szymborska has a great ability to create something of substance out of what seems to be nothing. Additionally, at least in her early work, she can also be a very personal poet. Such poems as “I Am Too Near” (“Jestem za blisko”), “Returns” (“Powroty”), and especially “Unexpected Meeting” (“Niespodziane spotkanie”), and “Born of Woman” (“Urodzony”) are examples of her lyrical poetry at its best, yet other such poems which are presumably “personal” in nature such as “Family Album” (“Album”) and “Laughter” (“Smiech”) (6) reach beyond the boundaries of the personal and acquire a universal significance.\n\nThe title poem from Szymborska’s A Great Number is a central work in her oeuvre for in it she combines many of the elements which characterize her poetic output as a whole. Despite Szymborska’s own concerns that the themes of her poetry may be too diverse, (7) there are certain poetic concerns which recur in most of her best work. A close reading of her poem “A Great Number” will illuminate some of the most important of these.\n\nThe primary theme which we will focus on is the role of poetry itself, that is, on its capabilities and limitations. The poet selects isolated elements of reality for poetic illumination, discovering fresh perceptions of the world, in essence, giving meaning to the world by recreating it in verse. Her limitations consist primarily in the fact that the nature of poetry requires that it be selective in its choices of subject, thereby condemning to oblivion all that the poet either refuses or is unable to see. The poet’s power, then, is also her major weakness.\n\nThe first eight lines of “A Great Number” serve in one way or another to reveal the fundamental dichotomy which exists between masses and individuals. Such a contrast, as we will see, can be understood to exist on several levels. As Barańczak has shown, this may be seen as a discussion of the individual’s struggle to protect his or her individuality against the deadening effects of society. From a different point of view it may be seen to be the poet’s appraisal of her own artistic powers, limitations, and the very nature of what her art can do. Or it may be seen on a more abstract philosophical level where uniqueness and individuality are shown to be the only things that can stimulate imagination and intellect. Szymborska creates repeated images, both linguistic and imagistic (“[imagination] flitting through darkness like a flashlight beam” “[moja wyobraźnia] Fruwa w ciemnościach jak światło latarki”), or conceptual (“[my imagination] does not do well with great numbers” “źle sobie radzi z wielkimi liczbami’’), which deepen the perception of duality and contrast between the disparate elements. 1.1 and 1.2 establish this opposition immediately by contrasting the four billion inhabitants of the earth with the individuality of the lyrical “I’s” imagination. 1.3 and 1.4 further develop the gulf between them by indicating the inscrutability of great numbers and the fact that uniqueness or particularity is the only thing capable of moving the poet’s imagination. Her use of the word “touch” to indicate the effect that uniqueness has on imagination implies a two-fold significance. Not only does uniqueness have the ability intellectually to touch imagination, but it also has the capability to “touch” it emotionally. Thus, while imagination “does badly with great numbers,” it may become intimately involved with individual elements that are isolated and extracted out of them.\n\nWhile this ability of imagination to comprehend uniqueness and individuality at least to some degree is perceived to be “positive” (i.e., productive), it is also greatly limited. Of all the potential “particularities” that exist unilluminated in the darkness, the imagination, like a flashlight, is capable of illuminating only the first face it comes upon at the edge of the crowd. A random choice, as it were. Many of Szymborska’s poems deal with the nature of random selection as a concept important not only in poetry, but in every day life as well. Such poems as “The Terrorist, He Watches” (“Terorysta, on patrzy”), “Wonderment” (“Zdumienie”), and “There But for the Grace” (“Wszelki wypadek”) all focus on this problem. (8) As 1.7 and 1.8 indicate, the remaining “faces” in the crowd must remain in total obscurity. The poet’s flashlight, her ability to illuminate, is weak (“fruwa”) and can neither bring life to, nor give meaning to all those faces which remain somehow incomplete and unrealized since they cannot be incorporated into the poet’s recreated world. By repeating the basic theme of these eight lines in different circumstances, the poet creates an organic set of correspondences which imbue certain words with added meaning within the framework of the poem. The world is divided into two disparate parts: the one vs. the many, and individual areas of illumination vs. darkness. Using the images which have been employed to this point, we can draw up the following correspondences:\n\nmass individual\n\ndark light\n\noblivion, non-thought, unregret illumination\n\nEach of these words carries a metaphorical meaning over and above its common lexical meaning. Thus, as we will see subsequently, poetry and memory will take their places in the second set of correspondences.\n\nThese first eight lines set the stage for a sort of internal polemic that will be waged within the poet’s consciousness. Despite the fact that the poet’s imagination “does badly with great numbers” and has the capability to “illuminate” individual manifestations of those great numbers, there has, as yet, been no judgmental implication on her part. However, the final three lines of the first stanza indicate that there is a dilemma in this dichotomous relationship which, if it does not go as far as a genuine moral struggle, at least takes on the character of mild regret.\n\nIn 1.9 the poet invokes the memory of Dante, telling us that even that poet was unable to do more than be selective. This is a sort of apology from the lyrical “I” which supports the idea that there is no intent to imply good or bad to what is written, but that such a breakdown begins to force itself on the poet and reader alike. Included in this apology is the poet’s regret—and self-justification—that imagination is unable to illuminate more, that it can only rely on happenstance and its own weak powers to bring to light what little it can. The invocation of Dante serves a two-fold purpose: First, that even a poet of Dante’s supreme stature was subject to this law of randomness and limitation (i.e., so the present poet cannot be held morally or artistically responsible for this same insufficiency); and second, it is, of course, a thematic reference to Dante’s Divine Comedy, in which throughout Hell, Purgatory and Paradise the medieval poet literally selects at random the faces which he will illuminate in poetic form, while leaving the vast majority of the rest to continue wandering lost in oblivion. He too, after all, occasionally apologizes to those souls he must pass over, knowing that each in his own way is worthy of poetic attention.\n\n1.10 and 1.11 address this inadequacy with a rhetorical question. If even Dante was powerless before this illumination of poetry, and if one (presumably the poet) is not a Dante, what more can be expected even if one has the support of all the muses? The lines serve to heighten the sense of precariousness of the poet’s role and the powers of imagination, which we may now begin to understand as a metonymical replacement for poetry. There is, then, a sense of powerlessness on the part of the poet which co-exists with the very real power of being able to recreated the world by perceiving it anew.\n\nThe first lines of the second stanza are an indirect and inconclusive reply to the rhetorical question which has preceded. 2.1 implies that the self-comparison with Dante is not of primary importance. The poet’s aspirations to literary immortality through poetic recreation of the world is a premature concern, for, as she asks in 2.2, a more pressing matter is first to determine whether she is fully participating in life, and if so, is that itself sufficient. She does not define what she means by “sufficient,” but it seems clear enough that the question posed here is whether living a full life is enough to give life meaning. 2.3 responds immediately: It has never been enough and it is even less so in the context of the modern world (Szymborska more laconically says “now”). Poetry, then, is not written to achieve immortality for the author, but is written to flesh out and give meaning to the life that the poet and her readers lead. Poetry is an integral part of life, for without it, life is impoverished of meaning. Szymborska has spoken of this in part in “Travel Elegy” (“Elegia podróżna”). Here the exotic wonders of the world encountered by a traveler are nearly inscrutable because the viewer has no way of preserving the experience. She writes:\n\nAll is mine but nothing owned,\n\nnothing owned for memory,\n\nand mine only while I look.\n\nNo sooner remembered than uncertain\n\nare the goddesses of their heads.\n\n(Wszystko moje, nic własnóscią,\n\nnic własnóscią dla pamięci,\n\na moje, dopóki patrzę.\n\nLedwie wspomniane, już niepewne\n\nboginie swoich głów.)\n\nMemory alone, then, is not enough. As we see in “A Great Number,” it is poetry—a form of creatively organized memory—which serves to preserve these elements of reality by recreating them in a new context, in a poem.\n\nAfter establishing the primary function of poetry, the poet returns to her original theme of poetry’s selective nature. 2.4-2.6 continue the poet’s recognition of her limitation and echo her “apology” in the Dante line above. Although “choosing by rejecting” is the only possible way in which a poet can observe life, and thus hope to give it meaning, that does not absolve her of the “guilt” of omission forced upon her by random selection of subjects and objects for description which are far too great in number to all be included in her work. Ironically, by openly stating this limitation, and by mentioning the density, numerousness and insistency of that which is omitted, she does succeed to a certain degree in including that which she claims is beyond her powers to include. (9)\n\nThe overall implication of these lines is that life cannot become fully realized until it has been perceived by an artistic eye. This is the cause of the poet’s remorse, since she realizes she is able only to give meaning to very small, randomly selected elements of the world. All that she is unable to incorporate into her poetic vision remains in a Dantean Limbo of unrealized being. Whether she means that all these “black masses” do not exist for her personally, but may exist for themselves, or whether she means that anything she cannot incorporate into her poetic vision does not exist at all is not clear. Presumably she intends to say that she is incapable of speaking for anyone but herself—her extreme subjectivity has already been well-established—and therefore her concern is with the world as it exists (or does not) in her own perceptions.\n\n2.7 echoes 2.4, where the poet indicated that “there is no other way” to write verse but to select by rejecting. Here she recognizes the undesirability of her limitations (“losses indescribable” [“neopisanych strat”]) but still, these indescribable losses bring her a “little verse, a sigh” (“wierszyk, westchnienie’’). Her use of the diminutive for “verse” has a possible twofold interpretation. If we are to keep in mind the apologetic vision she has sometimes expressed to this point, her use of “wierszyk” here may be intended to minimize the importance of her poetic work in relation to all that she must leave unsaid. On the other hand, if we are to keep in mind that only through poetry is the poet able to attribute meaning to her world, the diminutive could be interpreted here as an endearing term. Similar is the case of “a sigh,” which may be seen as a spontaneous expression on one hand of sorrow or regret, or on the other of relief. It would seem that both interpretations are not only possible, but necessary within the framework of the poem.\n\n2.8 and 2.9 continue the same ambiguity since both contain equally possible variant readings. In 2.8 the poet tells us that her response to a “clamorous calling” is a whisper. The Polish “gromkie powołanie” may mean “calling” both in the sense of vocation, or in the sense of a “call to arms.” Once again, in reference to the Dante lines, the former possibility is perfectly permissible. In terms of the second possibility, this line would seem to contain a rather overt sociological statement that the poet will not heed boisterous demands to choose as subjects for her poetry that which is demanded by fashion, culture, ideology, etc. Her insistence on answering in a whisper would seem to be her refusal to join Majakovskij’s intemperate oath to “shout at the top of my voice” about subjects which have been chosen for her. This line may be read in still a third way on the more abstract level which has been noted previously: Against the thunderous call of seemingly endless reality which remains hidden in oblivion, the poet’s response is barely but a whisper. This may be the poet’s further recognition that she is unable to do anything but resurrect infinitesimally small amounts of that reality from oblivion, and must leave the vast majority to wallow in unknowing. In 2.9 the poet maintains a characteristic ambiguity about whether she is unwilling or unable to give expression to everything she must pass over in silence: “tego nie wypowiem’’ may be translated as “I will not say” (cf. Krynski/Maguire) or “’I cannot say.”\n\n2.10 invokes the Polish proverb of the mountain which gives birth to a mouse. Once again the poet repeats the major visual and conceptual image of the poem: the great and the small. But for the first time she recognizes the positive, or at least necessary, qualities of the “great.” That is, while only in the minuscule, the separate elements, chipped off from the enormous block of “mass” (oblivion) is life comprehended and given meaning, its existence in turn is unthinkable and even impossible apart from the massive, overwhelming whole.\n\n2.11 continues, but transforms, the image which is created in the previous line. Sand, here has three functions: 1) an endless, unbroken expanse; 2) the enormity of numbers of grains of sand in comparison to the size of a paw’s scratch in them; 3) the impermanence of sand, it’s changeability. For the first time the poet introduces the word “life” into the poem. Significantly, rather than compare it with something great and exalted, she equates it with the minuscule, temporary, incomplete images that have predominated in the poem to this point.\n\nThere now arises another paradox in the images and concepts of the poem, the two sides of which do not necessarily cancel each other out. Earlier, smallness and individuality were portrayed as “positive” in relation to enormity and mass. Here, however, one tends to see the image of life as merely a scratch or two in sand as a “negative” quality that is characterized by insignificance, temporality and impermanence. It would seem that both elements are present and intended by the poet. In other words, it is just that very smallness and temporality of life which allows it to become a subject of art, thereby achieving for it an “immortality” or “permanence” that is not naturally a part of it. Meaning can be imparted to this wistful thing (life) because of its very smallness, isolation, and individuality, since it is capable of being isolated from the ungraspable mass of which it is a part. Nonetheless, the primary impression left by this line is a sense of frustration and perhaps loss, brought on by a realization of the smallness of life.\n\nUntil this point in the poem all images with the exception of the reference to Dante have been either strictly poetic or abstract. In the third stanza, however, the first “realistic” or tangible images are introduced. But they are not presented in a realistic manner, for they are introduced by means of a dream-state.\n\nOnce again, 3.1 repeats the basic theme of isolation/individuality. The poet’s dreams—like her imagination, and thus her poetry—are not peopled “as they should be.” (Compare the “lack of population” in her dreams with the four billion people on the earth in 1.1). Again the poet has created a poetic image which justifiably may be interpreted in more than one way. This confusion is caused by her use of “as they should be.” It 1s conceivable that this is a reference to 2.8 where she insisted that she is not susceptible to the pressures of a “great call” or “calling.” If this is so, 3.1 is a further statement of rebelliousness on the poet’s part. But the “should be” may also be interpreted as an expression that even that level of poet’s “creativity” (dreams), which one might expect to be free from the selectivity of her “waking” talent, is subordinate to that primary principle. That even her subconscious and unconscious thoughts must be selective implies that the necessity of limitation in any sort of perceptive process is fundamental. The concept of dreams certainly is a reference to the idea of imagination in the first lines of the poem, and now by extension and allegory, to poetry.\n\n3.2 repeats the main theme in different terms and also furthers the possible sociological reference, which has been noted above, by pitting the masses against individuality.\n\nThe remainder of stanza three (3.3—3.7) examines the poet’s dreamworld and relates the primary elements of a single dream, all the while continuing the themes that have been established in the first two-thirds of the poem. 3.3 not only begins the “narration” of the dream, but is also a reference to the powers of dream (and thus as we have noted, of poetry as well) to overcome reality. That is, dream, memory, poetry and imagination all have the power to reverse or overcome the logical demands of life as we know it. They have the power to violate natural laws, thus creating their own new natural laws and a universe unto themselves. (10)\n\n3.4-3.5 continue the theme of isolation and individuality in the images of the single hand and the empty house. The hand is even further isolated in that the poet does not give us the slightest clue as to whom it belongs. This hand has been severed from the whole organism, so to speak, just as the poet must always perceive only incomplete elements of reality broken off from the whole. Whether this is a hand of the long dead visitors trying to enter the empty home or the hand of the poet who will exit that house two lines later is unclear and probably beside the point. What is important is that the “handle” signifies a door handle which allows access to this “empty house, overgrown with the attachments of an echo” (“Obrasta pusty dom przybudówkami echa’’). Echo here is certainly a metonymical replacement for memory and in turn, we can probably say, for poetry.\n\n3.6-3.7 continue the dream image and make a final statement of the poet’s freedom and independence. The valley into which she runs is “no one’s” because it is empty, unpopulated, unlike the modern world in which she must live (a reference again to the poem’s first line). And being quiet and unpopulated as it is, it is anachronistic because its emptiness has an almost primordial quality to it. One senses that the poet runs into this quiet, empty valley with a sense of joy if not even relief. The valley seems to symbolize for her escape even from her own past (the long dead visitors of 3.3) and her own poetic work (assuming we are correct in calling “echo” of 3.5 a replacement for poetry). On one level, this quiet empty valley, then, is for her the clean slate on which she has the opportunity to create a new poetic universe. On a more realistic level it is a place where she can go to be away from expectation, prejudice and the cumbrances of her past and the modern populated world.\n\nThe final two lines transfer us back to the poet’s waking state. Now, instead of subjectively perceiving the dream-state, she objectively views it from the outside. The quiet valley into which she ran while in the dream-state is reflected in the expanse (“przestrzeń”) of 4.1. This idea of reflection is even graphically illustrated in the final words of the poem which are phonological mirror-images of each other: “we mnie—nie wiem.” Both the expanse of the waking state and the valley of the dream-state are reminiscent of the darkness of 1.5 which is vast, amorphous and unformed until its minute component parts are illuminated by the poet’s meager flashlight. Thus, the darkness which existed outside the poet earlier, now exists within. There has occurred a rapprochement between the outer and inner universes. But, as she states in the poem’s final words, she does not know where this inner space comes from. The mystery of her raw creative material remains, despite the fact that she has succeeded earlier in giving it at least a certain meaning through selective perception of it through poetry.\n\nWe have seen that “A Great Number,” representative of much of Szymborska’s work, touches upon several of her common themes: 1) The element of chance or fate, that is, the random quality of the universe, and, more importantly, the random quality of the poet’s perception of it; 2) The potential endlessness of the universe, it’s vastness which cannot be comprehended in its entirety, but can only be comprehended by perceiving selected minor elements of it; 3) As a corollary, the importance that microscopic elements of the universe play in making up reality: Thus, at least on perceptual grounds, meaning is possible only because of smallness, individuality and solitude; 4) Poetry as a means to achieving what understanding is possible. Poetry is a repository for and preserver of life’s individual elements. Consequently, poetry is the surest element for giving meaning to the things and experiences of life, at least insofar as meaning can be found to exist at all, and insofar as it can be grasped by the poet.\n\nSuch qualities make Szymborska in many ways an heir to the tradition of Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, both in terms of his concept of “the concrete entity” (“istnienie poszczególne”) and his attitude toward the illuminating capabilities of art. The opening lines from her “Wonderment” are a striking rephrasal of Witkacy’s own wonderment as to “Why am I this and not another being, why am I in this time and not another?”\n\nWhy to excess then in one single person?\n\nThis one not that? And why am I here?\n\nOn a day that’s a Tuesday? In a house not a nest?\n\nIn skin not in scales? With a face not a leaf?\n\n(Czemu w zanadto jednej osobie?\n\nTej a nie innej? I co tu robię?\n\nW dzień co jest wtorkiem? W domu nie gnieździe?\n\nW skórze nie łusce? Z twarzą nie liściem?)\n\nSzymborska, however, is content to ask the questions alone, content to phrase them in such a way that they take on a significance of their own, content to make of them art and poetry. As Witkacy perceived art to be the final means to self-understanding after the collapse of religion and philosophy, Szymborska seems to say in her poetry that only the artist’s eye has the capability to make sense of the world construct. While there may be no hidden a priori meaning to be discovered in the phenomena that surround us, meaning can be attributed to the things and experiences of the world by questioning and rephrasing them in a clever and “beautiful” way. It is at this point that Szymborska’s poetry achieves a certain affinity with that of her contemporaries, Tadeusz Różewicz and Miron Białoszewski, perhaps even more so than with Zbigniew Herbert and the other “moralists.” Like Różewicz, she is skeptical of her powers at the very same time that she recognizes their importance. Echoing the same apology that she expresses in the Dante lines of “A Great Number” she writes in “Under a Certain Little Star” (“Pod jedną gwiazdką)”\n\nI apologize to coincidence for calling it necessity.\n\nI apologize to necessity just in case I’m mistaken.\n\nLet happiness be not angry that I take it as my own.\n\nLet the dead not remember they scarcely smolder in my memory.\n\nI apologize to time for the muchness of the world overlooked per second.\n\n(Przepraszam przypadek, że nazywam go koniecznością.\n\nPrzepraszam konieczność, jeśli jednak się mylę.\n\nNiech się nie gniewa szczęście, że biorę je jak swoje.\n\nNiech mi zapomną umarli, że ledwie tlą się w pamięci.\n\nPrzepraszam czas za mnogość przeoczonego świata na sekundę).\n\nLike Różewicz, she both affirms and negates at the same time: negates by what she says, and affirms by the fact that she says it. But in such lines she goes beyond Różewicz’s minimalism and achieves something akin to Białoszewski’s latent spiritualism, wherein the barebones images of stoves reduced to ĺgrey naked holesĺ seem to grow out of Różewicz’s bankrupt world of ruin, somehow renewed and imbued with a new significance. Szymborska’s is a poetry of healing which, while understanding the unpleasant nature of the disease, nevertheless finds reason to rejoice.\n\n_________________________________\n\nNOTES\n\n1 Stanisław Barańczak, ‘‘Posążek z soli,”’ in Etyka i poetyka (Paris: Instytut Literacki, 1979).\n\n2 “…To jednak nie znaczy wcale, że poezja Szymborskiej jest jakimś—rozpisanym na wiersze—teoretycznym traktatem o różnych mozliwościach sposobu istnienia,” in Jerzy Kwiatkowski, Introduction to Poezje (Warsaw: Panstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1977), 13.

[…] Po prostu bardzo wiele rzeczy mnie interesuje’’). See note 4, page 302.\n\n8 This concern of Szymborska’s is not limited to her poetic work alone. She is also the author of numerous reviews of books on widely varying themes, and when asked whether she approaches her critical reading according to any organized plan, she replied, “‘No. Sometimes I select a book about butterflies or dragonflies, sometimes a brochure about renovating the home, while still other times I might pick up a school textbook.” (“Nie. Czasem biorę książke o motylach czy ważkach, innym razem broszurę o odnawianiu mieszkania, a jeszcze kiedy indziej sięgam po podręcznik szkolny”). See note 4, page 304.\n\n9 Artur Sandauer has touched on this in his article, “Reconciled with History” (Pogodzona z historią) in Poeci czterech pokoleń (Kraków: Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1977): “Affirming that a subject doesn’t exist, we give it an imaginary existence and reveal the process of its manifestation in imagination. [. . . ] Even her individual sentences are so constructed that they negate, while simultaneously affirming,” and, “A real entity may become literature, just as a literary entity may materialize in reality.” (“Twierdząc, że przedmiot nie istnieje, powotujemy go do istnienia imaginacyjnego i ukazujemy proces jego powstawania w wyobrazni. [. . . ] Nawet poszczegolne jej zdania są tak skonstruowane, ze negując, jednocześnie afirmuja [295),’’ and, “Postać rzeczywista może wkraczać do literatury albo też—literacka materialozować się w rzeczywistości [297]”).\n\nSzymborska herself has eloquently elaborated on the theme in other of her poems. “Gratitude” (“Podziękowanie”) is a poem of “love” for those whom the poet does not love: “Atlantis” (“Atlantyda”) describes a place of which the author knows nothing, but which, through poetry, acquires a perceptible existence; “Station” (“Dworzec”) (see The New Polish Poetry, ed. Milne Holton and Paul Vangelisti [University of Pittsburgh 1978]) recounts everything that “happened” at a meeting that never took place.\n\n10 Szymborska elaborated on this idea in an earlier poem, “Memory at Last” (Pamięć nareszcie”), in which she wrote: “Memory at last has what it sought. / My mother has been found, my father glimpsed. / I dreamed up for them a table, two chairs. They sat down. / Once more they seemed close, and once more living for me.” (Pamięć nareszcie ma, czego szukała./Znalazła mi się matka, ujrzał mi się ojciec. / Wyśniłam dla nich stół, dwa krzesła. Siedli. / Byli mi znowu swoi 1 snowu mi żyli’’). Memory and dream, then, have the power to create, or at least recreate, life. To bring into being a new world, a new reality. Not only are memory and dream related to art in that the poem itself serves as the medium for expressing the dream memory, but the final two lines of the poem draw a direct correlation with the art of painting: “I woke up. I opened my eyes. / I touched the world as if it were a carved frame.” (“Zbudziłam się. Otwarłam oczy. / Dotknęłam świata jak rzeźbionej ramy”). The “real” world, then, is only the frame which holds within it the greater reality of dream, memory, art and poetry.\n\nI studied Polish language and literature with Stanislaw Baranczak as a grad student at Harvard in the mid-1980s. He arrived at Harvard in 1981 after the Polish government declared martial law. I arrived at Harvard in 1983 and probably began taking courses with him in 1984. He was already an internationally-known scholar, poet and translator, which explains why Harvard snapped him up when he, as we might say in a baseball environment, became available. I mention baseball with a purpose. For, as awed as all Baranczak’s students were with his accomplishments, his prowess and his place in history, no one was cowed by the man. For the man was one of the kindest, gentlest, most approachable humans you could ever hope to meet. So it happened one day as I passed through Harvard Square that I saw my professor and shouted out in jest, “Stasiek! How are you! What do you think about the Red Sox?!” Hailing Professor Baranczak by his personal diminutive was pretty brutal of me, but he was the kind of person who got a kick out of things like that. He laughed and said, “The Red Sox? I don’t know! I’ve never been to a Red Sox game! I would love to go!” Over the next year or two we went twice, once sitting just beyond first base back up under Fenway’s creaking roof and behind one of those age-old posts, the other time enjoying the boisterous freedom of seats out in the right field bleachers. As far as I know, Professor Baranczak never quite caught on to baseball, but he clearly had a blast at both games we attended, spending as much time gazing at the spectators as at the field. We had a couple of good beers, a couple of good hot dogs and Stasiek – as I never called him again after that first time! – had a big smile on his face the whole of both times. It was probably some time around those two visits to Fenway that I asked him if he would sit down for an interview with me. I didn’t have a place to put it yet, but that kind of thing never stopped me (or Baranczak, for that matter). He said sure and one weekend afternoon, I think it was, he came by my apartment and we sat down in my tiny living room in a row house on Beacon Street to chat. I taped it, transcribed it, took a shot at sending it to the Southwest Review, which I dug up out of some list, and they took it immediately. The interview ran with translations of three of Baranczak’s poems, which I do not include here, for I have no right to them. You can get to them online on the JSTOR site if you can fight your way past all the locked doors they throw up at you. It’s quite something for me to read now – Baranczak talking about just finishing his first book of poems since moving to the United States – as I think about the fact that he died and left us almost five years ago, at the tail end of 2014. I’d like to focus especial attention on our last exchange in this interview, Baranczak’s response after I asked him if religion and/or God played a role in his life. He winced visibly and said, “Maybe you don’t need to ask that question?” Trusting that some of the simplest, most naive questions bring some of the best answers, I pushed ahead. I said, “No, I’d really like you to answer that.” This little exchange was edited out of the printed interview. What was left was Baranczak’s brilliant answer, one I have quoted over and over again over the last 30-odd years. The photo above – depicting the poet in Harvard Yard – is pulled from an obituary that ran in The Boston Globe.\n\nJOHN FREEDMAN\n\nSouthwest ReviewVol. 71, No. 4 (AUTUMN 1986), pp. 422-435\n\n“Stanislaw Baranczak. An Interview and Three New Poems”\n\nThe Polish poet Stanislaw Baranczak, born in 1946 in Poznan, is a leading figure of the “Generation of 68” who has been called by Victor Erlich “one of the most significant Polish men of letters of his generation.” When still in Poland he was an active member of KOR—the Social Self-Defense Committee. He has published in Polish some nineteen books of poetry, literary criticism, and translations from English, Polish, and Russian. In English he has published two chapbooks, Where Did I Wake Up! and Under My Own Roof (Mr. Cogito Press: Forest Grove, Oregon), and his poetry is represented in the anthologies Humps & Wings (Invisible City: San Francisco), The New Polish Poetry (University of Pittsburgh Press), Witness out of Silence (Poets and Painter’s Press: London}, and Postwar Polish Poetry (University of California Press). He is currently Alfred Jurzykowski Professor of Polish Language and Literature at Harvard University.\n\nFREEDMAN: Czeslaw Milosz has described you as primarily a political poet, though you have said you prefer the term public. Can you elaborate? Is there such a thing as a political poet, strictly speaking?\n\nBARANCZAK: Well, to begin with, what Milosz says in the little introduction to my poems in his anthology is that my poetry has been predominantly political. I may even agree with that from a certain point of view. There is an element of at least political life in the majority of my poems. What I mean is that in a country such as Poland almost everything tends to be political including even, I don’t know, erotic writing… The most private affairs of your life are tainted by politics if we mean by politics everything that is imposed on you by the system. The best example I can give you is a sequence of my poems devoted mainly to the problem of housing, which probably sounds silly, but the point is that I see it as a metaphysical sequence of poems. The place where you live is a kind of metaphor for your place in life, which is merely translated into a language of space and walls and ceilings. So poems about housing are political, too, since housing is a political problem.\n\nFREEDMAN: Political in the sense that it’s perceived as political by readers?\n\nBARANCZAK: And by me. The very notion of having an apartment includes having to wait for it. The average Polish citizen waits twenty years for an apartment, so the act of one’s finally finding his or her own place to live is not just an element of everyday life but is something almost sacred. On the other hand it usually brings disappointment since you expect to get a nice place to live but you probably get something shabby instead. You see how a poem that starts from a metaphysical or philosophical vantage point turns out to be political. What I am trying to say more generally is that in Poland you cannot avoid political engagement. Even if in the most abstract sense you are on the side of humanity, on the side of the individual or whatever—which every poet surely is—at the same time you take a political stance since the system in which you live is anti-human and anti-individual. In other words, by simply being a poet you turn out to be a political beast.\n\nFREEDMAN: Now that you’ve spent a year looking for and buying a home here, does that provide you with any new possibilities for making metaphysical and philosophical statements?\n\nBARANCZAK: Yes, in fact it does.\n\nFREEDMAN: Are you going to write a new series on buying a home in America?\n\nBARANCZAK: No, no, that would be rather boring since it doesn’t provide me with any dramatic situations. And banking terms wouldn’t really sound very good in poetry. But seriously, the problem of my being here in America does provide me with certain poetic motifs. Still, I’ve got the feeling that, as is usual with every displaced person, whether displaced forcefully or by his own choice, my mind occupies two worlds at once. It constantly compares them and the comparison is a process, the consequence of which is rather hard to grasp. The sheer fact that America is a better place to live than Poland doesn’t mean that I don’t miss certain things that can be found only in Poland. I have just entered into what might be called the poetry of my American phase. It’s still too complicated and too early to discuss in more detail, but what I’m writing now seems to be based on a counterbalancing of those two worlds and experiences, which are astonishingly different. The only thing that makes them similar is perhaps an element of some universally human strivings that can be found both here and there. Everything that’s more specific, from the material features of everyday life to the most philosophical or social notions, is completely different so that sometimes even the same word means something entirely different in the two systems. I recently completed my first book of poems, Atlantis, which was written entirely in the United States. It is important that it is a unit, a whole, as opposed to individual poems published in journals. I use the metaphor of Atlantis to refer to a lost land that may or may not have existed. But it is in any case something that can be yearned for as a lost place. Of course it can be seen as a physical reference to Atlantis the mythical city, which bridged two continents, but I see it rather as leading into a different dimension. That is, exile as an inexorable fate. This notion of exile is a far broader concept than merely being in one or another place in the physical sense, although the word can have that connotation also. For example in the poem “Curriculum Vitae” I refer to actual physical exile whereby an émigré brings his essentially useless luggage of experience to his new home. That is, his ability to stand in lines, outwit the censor, and so on. But the overriding sense of the collection is exile as a state of mind.\n\nFREEDMAN: You talk of the importance of seeing the poems in Atlantis as a unified whole. Do you always perceive what you’re writing as a whole? Or do separate poems accumulate and then give you an idea for—\n\nBARANCZAK: I think the beginnings are usually very chaotic and accidental, and the poems just arrive. They appear without any connection among them although there’s always a certain point when you realize—or don’t realize, and that means that you still have to wait—that there are inner connections between them which demand that you group them in a certain way. Then you complement certain poems with others, which adds something else. Virtually all my books of poetry as far as I can remember originated that way, by writing individual poems first. Only later does some configuration appear. Recently I have been very conscious of trying to create books in the full sense of the word, especially the one that included the housing poems I was just discussing. It is constructed on the principle of a triptych. Two wings, so to speak, frame the center of the volume and these two outer wings are sequences about housing on the one hand and shopping and standing in lines on the other. This makes for two very quotidian subjects between which there is wedged a kind of poetic diary of a certain winter. What’s important is that on the higher level of the book’s construction you have to do the same as you would on the lower level of a single poem. You’ve got to counter chaos with a certain inner organization in your utterance.\n\nFREEDMAN: In these poems of your Polish period, you often write about parts of wholes; body parts, parts of guns. You speak about the muzzle, but not the whole gun. It seems to me that the result in this poetry is faceless in many ways. Your lyrical I resembles an escapee from an Orwellian novel. Does this sound like your poetry to you?\n\nBARANCZAK: That’s very interesting. I’ve always realized this particular feature of my style, but I’ve always thought about it in different terms. I would call it cognitive minimalism. I mean the act of confining oneself to what is tangible, to what’s as specific as possible, so that you give up the whole in favor of the part. Since the part is more tangible, it can be grasped. The part of the gun you usually see is the muzzle, because it’s what draws your attention. In terms of the human body, you normally have an awareness of your body as a sum of parts. You feel a pain in this or another part of your body. That’s my particular way of expressing what some other Polish poets, such as Herbert or Bialoszewski, expressed through material objects rather than ideas. Especially in early Bialoszewski it’s almost programmatic in that he only speaks about stoves, or chairs, or closets. He has to confine himself strictly to what’s specific and material precisely because he’s so disappointed in grand ideas. I did it perhaps in a more far-reaching way by speaking not only of objects but specifically of their parts. But still you may be right to say that the effect can be a certain facelessness, a certain lack of personal unity or integrity in these poems.\n\nFREEDMAN: Of course my point is that I assume that is intended.\n\nBARANCZAK: It’s not intended, but rather a side effect of what I was just talking about. But I think I at least try, especially in my later poetry, to counterbalance this disintegration of personality by using a very personal voice. That way the subject you are revealing by speaking about yourself may be disintegrated, but it still has a certain continuity. By continuity I mean I’m trying to reconcile two very different principles in a poem, the principle of forma! organization and the principle of colloquialness, and a certain fluidity or flexibility of the speaking voice, so that it changes emotions, points of view, and so on. This is not only my own voice, of course. It may be a borrowed voice. Sometimes the poem is a dramatic monologue of sorts. But the point is that it has to be a living voice.\n\nFREEDMAN: So some of your poems may be dramatic monologues; they certainly have a persona. That makes me think of a possible connection between your N. N. and Herbert’s Mr. Cogito.\n\nBARANCZAK: That’s a point many critics made, as a matter of fact. But when I was writing the first drafts of the poem “Artificial Respiration” in the early seventies, only the first several poems from Herbert’s sequence of Mr. Cogito had appeared, so it was still too early to guess that he intended to make of him a constant, literary persona. I simply thought it was just a temporary effect he was using.\n\nFREEDMAN: You thought perhaps he was copying you?\n\nBARANCZAK: No, no. Don’t be kidding. No no. Herbert doesn’t copy anybody, and especially not a younger poet who is relatively unknown as I was then. He physically wasn’t able to know about my poem. It was still in manuscript. But aside from chronology, the very concept of his hero differs from mine. The distance between the I of the author and the I of the speaker is different. In Herbert I would say it’s much more complicated and much more consciously manipulated than in my case. The distance between him and his Mr. Cogito can change. Sometimes he almost identifies with him. Sometimes he distances himself from him. In such poems there is identification, but identification colored with self-irony. In my case it’s clear from the very beginning that N. N. is not me. There are certain physical marks that distinguish us. He was much older, thirty-three, in the poem. He is a character who doesn’t fit my image. But the most important point is that N.N. is the type of average Polish citizen whom I actually abhorred, at least at that time. I was actually frightened by him, because he was an especially characteristic figure of the early seventies—he represented a kind of degeneration of people’s integrity and their ability to recognize who they really were. I don’t know if I’m making myself clear…\n\nFREEDMAN: Not only are you making yourself clear, but it reminds me of my previous comment that your lyrical I is faceless. This N. N., simply by virtue of his name, is a faceless character.\n\nBARANCZAK: Yes, I would agree, but with the correction that N. N. is not my lyrical I. He is a literary character. It’s not my voice that is speaking. But still you’re right that he’s faceless and that’s his most basic characteristic. He’s an anonymous element of the human mass and as such he lacks integrity, he lacks self-realization, he lacks any kind of conscious effort to change his life or make anything valuable of it. This is his drama, in fact this is his tragedy. He gradually realizes that and finally comes to the verge of suicide. But even that proves futile, and he doesn’t do it in the end. He remains entirely faceless. But Mr. Cogito is anything but faceless. He is a human character with his own peculiarities and attitudes. Of course he is internally divided, but he is more or less able to think, while my character is rather anonymous. I think my poems can even be criticized on that score since my vision was actually much more pessimistic and despairing than reality itself.\n\nFREEDMAN: That brings up a related point. In comparison with many of your contemporaries, Krynicki, Zagajewski, Kornhauser, and others, you don’t seem to be quite as angry. I get the feeling that you’re much more—sympathetic isn’t the best word—but you’re much easier on your subjects. For instance, when talking about N. N. you say he is the type of person you abhorred, yet you also say that you weren’t able to make him as negative a character as you had intended. I wonder if this is something in your personal style,that you tend to be more lenient, more sympathetic to your subjects?\n\nBARANCZAK: I don’t know. I wouldn’t see it in terms of sympathy, but in terms of an indirect way of expressing an attitude. In fact I don’t see any significant difference between me and some of my colleagues, Krynicki, Zagajewski. They also tend to be indirect and use a lot of irony in a very subtle way. There was in my generation a very strong current of what I would call an expressionistic attitude. The poet’s task was to “accuse reality in full voice,” so to speak. But this was always my generation’s weakest current. It was an artistic error on the whole, while what’s most valuable is based on a very intricate play of irony and indirectness. There are some exceptions to that of course. Krynicki, for instance, underwent a dramatic change in the years of martial law. The pressure of historic reality was so enormous that he started writing absolutely transparent poems, which in fact consist of a single, very simple utterance—\n\nFREEDMAN: Statement—\n\nBARANCZAK: Statement, yes. For instance, one poem comes down—I can’t quote it exactly—but it comes down to the appeal, “Soldiers, don’t shoot at us. We are the same as you.” It is very moving in fact because he shakes off all poctic adornments, as Rozewicz did in his first post-war poems, and he lets us know that there are certain situations in which the only thing a poet can do is speak simply and directly. I personally think this is wrong. Even the most terrible circumstances don’t eliminate the role of poet as poet, because poetry is not just decoration or embellishment, but is also a more concise and more meaningful way of discourse than normal speech. As such it has its role to play even in difficult times, although I can understand Krynicki’s impulse. But this is an exception and, to return to my point, what has been most valued in the poetry of my generation was always based on some complication, some indirectness, some specifically poetic way of saying something.\n\nFREEDMAN: When I was struggling for the right word and used “lenient” and “sympathetic,” perhaps “ironic” is what I should have used. It does seem I detect more irony in your poetry than I do in the others. But…\n\nBARANCZAK: Well, I would say that sympathetic can also be a good word in the sense that I never tried to kid myself that I was a poet apart from the rest of the people. It was an attitude that I really hated in some poets. The example I always tried to follow in this particular respect—which might amaze you—was Bialoszewski, with whom I would seem to have little in common. He’s so unique that he can’t be imitated. But when I was working on a dissertation on his poetic language I think I grasped the essence of his attitude toward people in his poetry. He was not only a poet of language, but also a poet of society. His point is that the individual is condemned to be unique and specific, and so is isolated and lonely, but at the same time he must strive toward society and he mustn’t put himself above other people. I took that attitude to heart, and I tried to incorporate it into my poetry. This had certain poetic and political consequences. What I mean is that when I criticize a certain attitude, indirectly that is, by ironizing it, I see it also as self-irony. The speaker and I are compromised together in a certain sense. It’s much more convincing if you demonstrate on your own example how the human condition can be distorted by, for instance, propaganda.\n\nFREEDMAN: Since we’re talking about language here, I notice you’ve been speaking primarily in the past tense. Is it different now?\n\nBARANCZAK: In this instance it was quite deliberate. I no longer write poems dealing with the language of propaganda, for instance. Very many of my earlier poems written in Poland were variations on worn-out phrases of the language of propaganda. Theoretically I could continue in this way. I still read Polish newspapers, I see all the distortions of language they make and so on, but I don’t feel [ have the right to do that because this is a reality in which I no longer live. I see it only from a geographical and cultural distance, so I would only write a kind of make-believe poetry, while neglecting what really concerns me now. Maybe I will return to it eventually, but I don’t think so.\n\nFREEDMAN: What do you think about an American poetry arising on the basis of your own linguistic barbs at the petrification—putrifaction?—of official language? In recent times we’ve heard President Reagan say such things as “Those jackals,” “Those barbarians,” “Americans are a family,” and “When we reach the gates of heaven it will be guarded by marines.” I’m certainly not making fun of the incidents that have given rise to the comments, but the comments themselves seem just as idiotic as anything General Jaruzelski himself might utter.\n\nBARANCZAK: I agree more or less. The point is that what we can call official language, any language that aspires to be a kind of artificial myth intended to unify people, is used in all systems from democracies to tyrannies. Even more so in modern political systems where mass society and mass media are a constant factor. A certain mass use of a very simplified language, the lowest common denominator of language, will always refer to popular stereotypes. This is obvious. So, in a sense, this kind of language can be found in American society, in the mass media particularly. There has already been some use made of that in American poetry, in fact, if you remember E. E. Cummings. He has a lot of poems that refer to this kind of reduced relationship. When I was translating him into Polish, I had a funny feeling of commonality of experience even though Cummings lived in a completely different society. I don’t particularly respect him as a very profound philosopher, because he’s not. But he’s a very witty and funny poet, and a master of language.\n\nFREEDMAN: Do you… no, I don’t even want to ask that question. I was going to ask whether you could imagine yourself writing parodies of Reagan’s speeches, but I shouldn’t even ask that.\n\nBARANCZAK: I can answer that. The thing is chat in order to move freely within a language it must be your own native language, and there’s no way of bypassing that. The only example known to me of a poet who has transplanted himself successfully is Joseph Brodsky. But his kind of poetry is very visibly different from mine. His concept of poetry, for all its greatness—I mean he’s a great poet, and I don’t mean to criticize him—is much closer to the traditional vision of poetry. While it’s very innovative, it’s based solidly in the universal poetic tradition. As such it can find common ground in both national traditions. As I have said, however, 1 tend to be moving away from linguistically oriented poetry and toward a more transparent, anecdotal style. The title poem from Atlantis takes its origin from my recollection of a real incident that occurred in Poland. I was sitting in the barber’s chair getting a haircut and listening to the barber talk about his adventures in the military when it suddenly occurred to me that I wasn’t at all interested in what he was telling me. It was one of those moments when you realize just how difficult communication between two people really is. From the vantage point of my life in America, I realized that exile, then, is not physical, but psychological. The poem “Setting the Hand Brake” is another which emerged from a real situation. This is something very new for me, since I never wrote such poems in Poland. It is a description of some minor, real incident that gives rise to a revelation of much broader implications. The setting of the brake seems to be a random image at first, but is subsequently shown to be something that plays a significant role in the poem. The character is thinking of several things simultaneously. Exile. The fact that he is someplace other than where he should be. The idea of movement and displacement. He is compelled to realize that unstoppable movement is an attribute of even his own body. His veins are full of movement just as the universe is full of movement. In fact, the displacement of exile is no different from what takes place ceaselessly in the macrocosm of the universe or in the microcosm of a man’s corporeal interior. But to return to your question, you have to remember that in order to write the kind of linguistic poetry I used to in Polish in another language would be virtually impossible since you have to be born into a language, you have to live through your childhood and your adolescence with it.\n\nFREEDMAN: On that note, you like to mention the Milosz poem where he says that his only potential readers are some football players in Milwaukee. Who do you perceive your audience to be? Football players in Milwaukee? Do you need an audience? Does your audience have to be Polish? Do you think about an audience when you’re writing?\n\nBARANCZAK: That’s many questions at once.\n\nFREEDMAN: Don’t answer all of them. . .\n\nBARANCZAK: Let me begin with this. First, if we compare my situation with Milosz’ when he arrived in America in 1961, the most striking thing is that he had no Polish audience in America, or even in the West in general. The Polish émigré community in the early sixties consisted mostly of people who had cither emigrated very long ago around the turn of the century, or as a result of the Second World War. They were people whose mainstream literary tastes were fossilized in the tastes of interwar Poland. Milosz was just too advanced, too modem, too individual a poet to appeal to them. Meanwhile, literary sensibilities in Poland had developed by the early sixties so that Milosz did have an audience there. But the barrier of censorship meant that only smuggled-in copies could circulate, which is another matter altogether. But among the émigré community in the West he virtually had no audience. I can understand his bitterness. He had a right to say ironically that his only readers were those football players with Polish names. On the other hand, I arrived in the West after several waves of emigration had occurred. Many intellectuals left Poland around ’68, and around the time of martial law there was another enormous wave of emigration. This formed a relatively new and worldwide Polish audience that is interested in reading poetry. But this sounds too idyllic, because in fact I don’t consider myself a poet who either requires, wants, or in fact has, a large audience. Even though, indeed—to be immodest—many people know my name. But they know my name because I was a member of KOR and I was politically involved in Poland and perhaps they hear me now on the radio. But not that many people read my poetry. That’s only natural. Poetry always has a limited readership. There’s a kind of myth in the West about poetry’s popularity in the Eastern European countries. It’s popular, within a relatively limited circle of readers, more popular than in the West, but still it’s not as popular as, say, detective novels. I realize that and I quite deliberately write for that limited audience which enjoys spending time with a poem, which takes pleasure in sitting down to decipher its complexities. For instance, it would be a gross error if a reader were to misconstrue the poem “Small Talk” as a satire on Americans engaging in empty patter. My purpose is much broader. What I am aiming at is something along the lines of a kind of dialogue with the whole of the external world. Cities. Streets. Windows. Cracks in floor-boards. The possibility for communication exists, but your interlocutor isn’t interested.\n\nFREEDMAN: You mean in the same way that you weren’t interested in what your barber had to say to you?\n\nBARANCZAK: Exactly. In the circumstance described in the poem, it would be genuinely inappropriate and tasteless to impose on your friendly host—that is, the world—by saying anything substantial. But an opportunity for real communication has been squandered.\n\nFREEDMAN: It seems that in a sense there is a certain similarity between this poem and the poems you wrote in Poland in that it relies heavily on a very banal, mundane element of a given culture for its genesis. While you wrote about getting apartments and standing in lines in Poland, now you are seizing on a somewhat similar aspect of American life as a springboard to achieving more far-reaching, universal conclusions.\n\nBARANCZAK: Not merely American culture, however, because I really am not singling out Americans, but the more generic, omnipresent phenomenon of small talk. The inability to break through the incredibly tough, superficial barrier of human discourse in order to get at something more substantial in order to really communicate. If dialogue is a central notion of the poem, then it’s a dialogue with the whole world. The poem wants to communicate both with the inanimate worlds by describing it, and with the animate world by expressing something intelligible to it. While it’s difficult for me to call my own poems universal, I would say that this one has a universal quality to it.\n\nFREEDMAN: I would like to return for a moment to your poetic fate in America, so to speak. How much do you lose in translation and can you describe the process of one of your poems making the transition from Polish to English?\n\nBARANCZAK: It depends on the poem. Some of my poems are “untranslatable,” although I actually believe that every poem can find a foreign home if the translator is good. Speaking about my own poems I use the term in the sense that I have not found a translator who is willing and able—whatever the reasons—to undertake the prodigious and time-consuming task of working to find the proper correspondences, both thematic and structural, which I try to put into my work. So the term untranslatable in this case means the lack of a person who can devote untold hours of labor and frustration to work that is not their own. I am very happy with the translations Reginald Gibbons does. He is very meticulous and insists on exhausting all the possibilities for every single word in a poem. Since he does not know Polish, I supply him with a rough translation that may consist of several variants of each line, and even on occasion, full descriptions of what I am striving for. He then returns to me a polished—no pun intended—version, after which we exchange emerging variants until we arrive at a final conclusion. He has helped me a lot and has discovered many idiomatic correspondences that capture what I’m looking for. Sometimes we come up with new subtleties in the English version that do not exist in the original. For example, the line “the land of the free and the home of quartz-watch precision” in “Curriculum Vitae” was a very pleasant surprise. The Polish original read something like “here there’s freedom and quartz-watch precision.” The interlingual play is not always so unequivocally successful, however. Gibbons was very skeptical about the final lines of the poem because he thought they sounded too naively optimistic for an American audience and that they were too reminiscent of that television Army slogan, “Be all that you can be.” Now, I’m not so shallow as to think that everyone in America can be what he wants to be, but there is an openness here to every possibility which immediately strikes a newcomer. I think it is a good metaphor if not a reality.\n\nFREEDMAN: What are your thoughts on some of the American poets you know? How have they affected your own poetry, if at all?\n\nBARANCZAK: My knowledge of American poetry is still very sketchy. Unfortunately, perhaps, I spend most of my time teaching Polish poetry and I don’t have the time I need to study yours. It’s a healthy tradition that—despite its natural ups and downs—has been written under a system chosen by the majority, and so has developed in a fairly normal way. This allows poets to spend more time and energy on universal matters. I read an essay by a poet recently, a relatively unknown writer, Baron Wormser, who published two volumes of poetry relatively late in life. He’s taken very much from Eastern European poetry. He discusses the nature of poetry in a society such as America’s, and he touches on some very fundamental issues. In his view the twentieth century is marred by the first person; too much concentration on ego. Anne Sexton and Lowell he doesn’t like; in that he’s very close to my own view. I also value more the kind of poetry in America that makes the fullest use of the conditions of elemental freedom, in the sense that it seeks to reach an audience not only through the ego. I don’t mean poetry has to be politically engaged all the time, of course. But it has to make a certain effort to reach its reader, even if there is only one, since that’s a reader, after all. From that point of view American poetry can be seen to have developed along two parallel lines; that of Walt Whitman and that of Emily Dickinson. They have more in common than it seems, though. Whitman is a very open poet, an open personality, whereas Dickinson is more closed and concentrates on her inner world. But this is only in appearance. She speaks of universal human problems that are applicable to anyone. So these two lines actually converge. Poets of the confessional school, such as Sexton and Lowell, don’t belong to that tradition. I translated the early Robert Lowell, but I don’t understand his later stuff at all; he is too bizarre, too chaotic. Still, I tend to be quite tolerant of different poetic attitudes.\n\nFREEDMAN: One of the recurrent themes in your poetry seems to me to be a sense of empty space that needs to be filled, that is, potentiality, emptiness, isolation, somewhat as might be found in Wislawa Szymborska, who frequently gives meaning to things by negation. In “Setting the Hand Brake” the image of a man enclosed “in the circumference of this and not another skin, planet, suburban parking lot” sounds very much like Szymborska. It occasionally reminds me at some paintings by Miro or Klee.\n\nBARANCZAK: I don’t know. I don’t think of it in those terms. The Polish critic Artur Sandauer sees in Szymborska an existentialist, whereas I think hers is more a creative method than a method of philosophy. Her poetry owes as much to Polish reality as to universal problems. And if we’re talking about my poems, I think I am even more devoted to reality, to real situations, than to abstract concepts or universal concepts. Even more connected to Polish reality than Szymborska. Polish reality is a place where anything can happen. Nothing is stable. At all. Much more so than in American life. I mean comparatively speaking, of course. You feel a certain emptiness, or perhaps, instability, around you as well as a kind of inner mood. Every single poem is full of semantic ambiguity because nothing is stable.\n\nFREEDMAN: As a caveat, I would like to ask you about a poll I saw sometime last year that indicated that ninety percent of Poles have religious beliefs. Do you think this “religious” feeling among Poles is simply an opportunity to be anti-communist?\n\nBARANCZAK: It’s not that simple. It is indeed a certain outlet, but I would say among the majority it is a very genuine feeling. It is a religious belief in the sense that there must be some sense in the world. In other words, to believe means to have some very fundamental attitude toward life. The pressures of the system make you feel that life is actually senseless, so for people to believe in this order in a religious sense is a sort of self defense. It doesn’t come down only to anti-communism, but becomes a moral matter. It can be a valid thing as well. The most basic thing you can believe in is the existence of a certain order in the world. Some of the people I know are very religious while actually being atheists. That is, they don’t really believe in God, but they believe that they should behave as if they believe.\n\nFREEDMAN: Does it play any role in your life?\n\nBARANCZAK: Well, I would roughly describe my position this way: I’m not religious in the sense that I go to church. But I think that one must behave as though he believes in God."
