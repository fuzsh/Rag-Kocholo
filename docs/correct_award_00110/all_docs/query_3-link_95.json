Because\n\nis dying to dream dreams which seem sort of not your own,\n\nor is it more like two thousand\n\nminute black pearls rolling behind us\n\ninto the chute? Keep dying, said my husband,\n\nyou’ll find out. Sail on, bright lump of earth,\n\nI added to myself, don’t think just now\n\nabout the leaky eye through which they’re spying on you\n\nas they prepare to swarm aboard. But it frightened me\n\nthat small dog’s duel with a tram\n\nas my husband said: don’t look. Behind the screen\n\nof my hand the dog rose. He was so great,\n\ninviting us all into his\n\nsplit open belly, where already waited\n\na priest, bare trees and a city buried in sand.\n\nTHE ZOO IN OO\n\nAn orgasm has to hurt, said the controller\n\nbecause a woman without a crisis is not a woman,\n\nshe’s a spinning mule. Oh just once give me\n\nrubble instead of an orgasm, the right amount of rubble\n\nwill fill any hole.\n\nI’m currently working on the life of another woman,\n\none who doesn’t think different is beautiful at all.\n\nWhen asked if she knows Italian, she says: not today.\n\nOn a forest path she mistakes her heart\n\nfor a tart wearing crocs. On a road with no right of way\n\nshe mistakes her heart for the heart of Merciful Jesus.\n\nOn the motorway she mistakes her heart for the heart of a corpse\n\nwhich nothing will dissolve.\n\nGive me some rubble for once, as much as I need\n\nor, I don’t know, shall we do it together?\n\nBorn in Warsaw in 1977, Justyna Bargielska has published eight poetry collections and two works of fiction. She is twice winner of the Gdynia Literary Prize – in 2010 for her poetry collection Dwa fiaty [Two Fiats] and in 2011 for her short fiction, Obsoletki [Born Sleeping] – and, among many other awards, winner of the Rainer Maria Rilke poetry competition in 2001.

Nobody\n\nhad watches on their wrists. This was our only food.\n\nBesides, ice that could not be moved,\n\nthe wall of ice, on it my breath swaying at dawn.\n\nWojciech Bonowicz (b.1967), Polish poet, journalist, editor, non-fiction and children’s writer, has published six collections of poetry. His first book, Majority’s Choice (1995), one of the most important debuts of the 1990s, won two awards in major poetry competitions. His fourth volume, High Seas (2006), was awarded the prestigious Gdynia Literary Prize in 2007 and shortlisted for the most important literary award in Poland, the Nike Prize. Another volume Polish Signs (2010) was nominated for the Silesius Poetry Award. Echoes (2013) was shortlisted for the Nike Prize, the Wisława Szymborska Award and the K.I.Gałczyński-Orpheus Award.

It’s time the lights went out.\n\nQuite soon he’ll go to bed, but first, just as he is,\n\nwith no costume or powder, he dances tap in the kitchen doorway\n\nto the beat of the bone-hard rattle of castanets.\n\nTranslated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones\n\nCITY OF THE DEAD\n\nOn clotheslines stretched between the tombstones\n\na woman hangs out her freshly laundered linen.\n\nHer arms are raised as if in mute lament\n\nto peg up a pair of panties or a T-shirt.\n\nPetticoats and bed sheets dance among the graves.\n\nAround stand mausolea, with people living in them:\n\nthe lodgers of the dead and sentries of their repose.\n\nA non-stop patter of children\n\nplaying soccer, with tombs as their goalposts.\n\nA mother calls them to dinner, and her voice\n\nmixes with the praying carried on in the chapel.\n\nSunlight. Dust of the desert. The clothes dry quickly,\n\nwafting the dregs of moisture onto the graveyard earth,\n\nIn the doorways of mausolea neighbors sit at tea,\n\nspending their afternoons in the meager shade of tombs,\n\ntethered to them just like the clotheslines.\n\nTranslated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones\n\nTEN DOUBLE EAGLE GOLD COINS\n\nA young doctor’s first earnings,\n\nfirst expense of a young poet,\n\nambitious boy from New Jersey—\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams.\n\nHe’ll remember that stack of gold coins\n\nhanded to him on the ground floor\n\nof a Mexican villa, while upstairs,\n\nsurrounded by relatives, an old man died.\n\nFor four days they had traveled by train:\n\nSeñor Gonzales, sick of lung, wishing to reach home\n\nbefore death, and his roving guardian angel,\n\nthe tense, fledgling doctor.\n\nPerhaps they’re best portrayed as two\n\nsides of the same coin: one, a veteran\n\nof life, breeder of sheep, head of the railroad,\n\ncovered with a blanket in a seat by the window,\n\nthe other, someone peeking through that window,\n\nbetween the giving of injections and the massaging of legs,\n\ncurious about an unknown landscape.\n\nIn Williams’ Autobiography, he recounts\n\nhow he feared Gonzales would not last the journey,\n\nand before the express could cover the distance\n\nfrom New York to San Luis Potosi,\n\nthe patient’s heart would stop, and then\n\nthe son who was travelling with them,\n\ndistrustful from the start, so full of anger\n\nat a doctor from a country that had spurned him,\n\nwould arrange to have the bungler lynched.\n\nBut then, in turn, Williams also describes\n\nthe Señor’s benevolence, how he repeated gracias\n\neach time the doctor tried to help him,\n\nand how he was supportive, the patient, gray-haired\n\ntough guy determined to win the race.\n\nThe poet ends with this: they won, it turned out\n\nwell—by some miracle; Gonzalez at home\n\nsaid goodbye with a smile and a handshake.\n\nAnd the money that Williams received?\n\nWhat happened to it? He muses to himself.\n\nAs if he could forget that he used it\n\nfor the printing of his very first book.\n\nTranslated by Mira Rosenthal\n\nBED\n\nToday in his apartment everything has changed.\n\nThe horrible empire furniture is all\n\nbut imitation, though more or less correct—\n\nthose pieces he used were sold when he died.\n\nThe rooms of his flat, once filled\n\nwith phantom voices pleading for a poem,\n\nnow total silence. Nothing but the brass bed\n\ncan claim to be authentically Cavafy’s.\n\nLikewise in his city everything is different.\n\nHe could no longer find those dark taverns,\n\nGreek and Egyptian faces mingling within,\n\nas many languages as found at the Tower of Babel—\n\nnow only Arabic remains, the one so foreign to him.\n\nLining the street, where boys for hire once lingered,\n\nnow theaters and fast food joints extend. Only the sea\n\nhums like it used to hum between two headlands,\n\nand like hands amid sheets flicker two small boats.\n\nTranslated by Mira Rosenthal\n\nA VISIT AFTER MANY YEARS\n\nThere were several of us in that second-floor workshop\n\nin a prewar building with a garden.\n\nWe painted flowers, fruit, the old\n\nwoman Marta from around town.\n\nI also remember a stuffed pheasant\n\n(sheet made to resemble a snowy field)\n\nand of course the skull: changing with the light,\n\nmocking my attempts at drawing.\n\nThe walls were covered to the ceiling\n\nwith our teacher’s oil paintings full\n\nof animals in surreal, vivid colors.\n\nShe lived with her parents,\n\nan attractive mother in a wheelchair, a taciturn father,\n\nand lots of cats and dogs around.\n\nOur Saturday lessons lasted two hours,\n\nbut she often allowed us to stay past.\n\nIn spring we went outdoors.\n\nOnce, at the lake, instead of painting the landscape\n\nwe made a woman out of sand\n\nwith red clay hair.\n\nShe wore braids back then,\n\nsaid what she thought, smiled rarely.\n\nSolitude, lack of success she masked with sarcasm\n\nbut treated us twelve-year-olds with gravity\n\nand a gruff warmth in our debates about art.\n\nHer sadness seemed to us very romantic\n\nlike her garden, overgrown with clumps of irises\n\nand blue delphinium in abundant grass.\n\nToday—the grass is mown.\n\nBuilding largely remodeled.\n\nParents no longer living.\n\nNo more lessons.\n\nShe is painting and selling.\n\nShe emphasizes the selling.\n\nOnly at the gate\n\nas we say goodbye, does she ask:\n\nDo you remember that woman of sand?\n\nTranslated by Mira Rosenthal\n\nKrystyna Dąbrowska (b. 1979) studied graphic art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. She translates poetry from English (including the work of W.C. Williams, W.B. Yeats, Thomas Hardy and Thom Gunn) and writes radio plays.

Hortus conclusus\n\n(us at ten and twelve)\n\nto my brother\n\nOur garden gathered in a tight-knit square\n\neast, west, north, and south: house to the east,\n\nto the west a fence, which faced a black ice forest,\n\nto the north the road, a neighbor to the south.\n\nWe lived as in a herd yet separate, our sphere\n\nsplit into “by the fence,” “walnut tree,” “out of bounds,”\n\nand “on Jurkowska’s side.” Each spring we found\n\nfresh uses for wilted shoots of lupine\n\n(they made good bullets), pods of columbine,\n\nspongy jasmine sprouts, and massive stones\n\noppressing nations of beetles. The pond\n\netched by thin ice. The breadth of loam\n\nand crown of air. Our remoteness seemed\n\ncomplete—sturdy fence, locked gate,\n\nsky propped on trees, all in fixed frames\n\nwrought from parents’ and grandparents’ commands.\n\nWe grew. At the gate, a secret pulse beamed,\n\nwhich sought to steal us. On the gold expanse\n\nof sky, the first cracks went undetected.\n\nIn the end, no cherubim or flaming swords:\n\nwe left on our own. Beyond the dandelion yard\n\nstood a foreign world: sharp in sight and sound,\n\nboundless if not cost-free, its house constructed\n\nof some different brick, open like a wound.\n\nTrain Gdańsk – Warsaw, 2 November 2004\n\nII. Cameo\n\n(me at sixteen and a half)\n\nHe held a locket with a tuft of hair\n\nfrom his nineteenth-century Europe,\n\nthat capricious lover—\n\nand, in truth,\n\nhe sought the pinnacle of art\n\nwhen he opined, pursing his lips:\n\n“Alas, I’ll never look like the boy,\n\ncameo profile in a wine-dark frame,\n\nfrom the time of Augustus—”\n\nand with a knife he slowly peeled a pear.\n\nWarsaw, 19 February 2001\n\nIII. Figure\n\n(me at seventeen)\n\nNo anatomical figures exist from that atlas:\n\npainstakingly etched with notes and diagrams,\n\ntransparent overlays of fossilized skeletons,\n\nso now I can’t assemble all these bones:\n\nfresh outline of a cheek, nights spent\n\nwith sketchpad and books, their endings then\n\na mystery to me, though I knew\n\nhow they began. We’d to to Oliwa Park\n\ndifferently than as children, differently than now.\n\nI can’t recall, I’m so distant from myself\n\nat seventeen as if I were an archaeopteryx,\n\nwhich if it existed no one can be sure,\n\nthough we believe it could have from watching birds.\n\nWarsaw, 9 February 2003\n\nIV. Mappa mundi\n\n(me at twenty-one and a half)\n\nEverything’s begun, but incomplete:\n\nthe first wrinkles, shadows, and spots\n\nare not flaws on a frame of film, but contours\n\nof a map with border and legend\n\non broad parchment.\n\nOne can’t tell\n\nwhich scars will heal, subside, get overgrown\n\nwithout a trace, mere memory\n\nof an ancient wound, and which will last\n\nand spread, break open to reveal\n\nthe lining of the skin’s coarse grain.\n\nFrom surface signs one can’t foresee\n\nwhen the deep descent will begin,\n\nwhen after fifty, one will plunge down\n\nwith wrinkled hands, a hernia,\n\nbunion-contorted feet, asthma, dry skull\n\nwhich for a second more will drift\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xbubble\n\non the surface like a xxxxxxxxxxof air and thought.\n\nWarsaw, 6 December 2004\n\nJacek Dehnel, born in 1980, is a poet, novelist and translator.

AUDEN\n\nin one of the photographs in The Oxford\n\nAnthology of English Literature.\n\nI’m not sure how to address him\n\nto remind him of that which\n\nhe doesn’t know. He shields his face\n\nfrom the sun, yet I read on,\n\nlook between the letters, the blank void.\n\nSomething’s always falling in there: a flower, a yell.\n\nThe echo carries further than the sense.\n\nRÓŻEWICZ: A FAREWELL\n\nI abandon poetry without regret\n\nAs if pushing off the shore\n\nImagination is silent\n\nWords lag\n\nTo walk away from poetry\n\nIs poetry, too.\n\nJacek Gutorow is an award-winning Polish poet, critic, and translator. A selection of his poetry translated into English, The Folding Star and Other Poems, was published in 2012 by BOA Editions, as a Lannan Translations Series Selection.

But I wanted\n\nthe picture to say more – a woman at the window\n\nbehind her lace curtains, a pensive man watching\n\nthe piglets feasting on last year’s apples by the sty.\n\nKalina drawing a heart that has its eyes tight shut,\n\nwiping her cheek clean of my kiss.\n\nI used to think in pictures; I’d see the doctor running\n\nfrom the patient and someone sending for the priest. The eyes of the snake\n\nthat’s been stretched across my shoulders to have our photo taken.\n\nThe boy who’s hidden in a man, the woman concealed\n\nin a mother: a young couple and their grubby, sated child\n\ndaily devouring their time, their money and their sex.\n\nTHE MARSH\n\nWith my parents I’m cleaning my grandparents’ grave.\n\nI’m using a rice-root brush to rub off foaming moss.\n\nI take the buckets to fetch water, I stand in line\n\nfor a tap that’s finished with a piece of hose.\n\nBy the gravestone, as they’re praying, I hold my thumbs for luck\n\nin the belt loops of my pants. I sensed that a thought would lead me here.\n\nIt’ll push me the right way towards feeling relief, for at last\n\nI’ve been found, like in a game of hide-and-seek.\n\nI’m cleaning the marble, I’m carrying water.\n\nIn the real world a tall spruce, a hand brush. In the dream world\n\nsomeone’s felling an apple tree I often gaze at from the kitchen window.\n\nŁukasz Jarosz (b. 1978) is a percussionist, vocalist and lyricist for bands including Lesers Bend, Chaotic Splutter, Panoptikum and Katil Ferman.

Light is only just mounting its installations,\n\ndepositing from the dark our folded clothes, books\n\nand the salt\n\nof a seashore daybreak\n\nis spilling on the inner window-sill. Clouds stronger and stronger,\n\ncomplicated: a rejuvenated massif, overhung\n\nwith cauldrons of dales, and days; avalanches weathering in mid-leap\n\nabove the seagull wings, a rockslide of the dark,\n\nof memory, which – like plotting paper – has arrested details,\n\nnervate particles; this gesture,\n\nthe way you unstrap your watch and slip it off\n\nyour wrist, is merely a black box record found\n\nin the shallows of night, in the runnels\n\nof sleep; touch like an opening\n\nof a syllable, drawing it out into whisper…\n\nTo wake up, to listen –\n\nhow tendons of those hours break, the minutes return\n\nand lead, deprived of chronology,\n\nan autonomous life (the magnetic needle quivers:\n\nmemory)\n\nAT BREAKFAST\n\nyou brought the newspaper and for the first time we could\n\ninspect these photographs: chain links, warped,\n\nof dying galaxies, ammonites sinking into the silt\n\nof a cosmic trench. Above us, still of the night,\n\nthe labyrinth of steep cataracts, ledges\n\ndamming up light: mercurial watercourses were carving a slope\n\nand sun, like a karstic spring, was spilling over a small glen\n\ninto the sea. Splattering on the paper, through the sieve\n\nof a yellowing plum tree, on the table set for breakfast;\n\ncoffee steamed, the cat sniffed at the wire rack for smoking fish,\n\nhe stretched under your hand. Through the galaxies,\n\nas if through damaged shells,\n\ndarkness was flowing, rinsing their chambers\n\nof planetary sediment.\n\nSHE\n\nThe one who is – inside me – a house with double skin of glass.\n\nWho puts me, a frozen river, to her lips.\n\nLicks the sweat from stones.\n\nThe one who has lips whitened from gathering squalls;\n\nin her eyes steely light, up to the horizon.\n\nThe one who has wolf’s fur, finishes her wounded young off, watches\n\nme crawl towards water –\n\nglinting, sharp sea pounds against the coast\n\nand the shreds of life, like foam, settle on the granite heads;\n\nmemory, the storm surge, carries in her hulk loose rubble: debris, shards,\n\ndust.\n\nClouds\n\nabove this blood.\n\nSky that happens and goes by, washes out in a void and frost.\n\nThe one who has my face before birth.\n\nThe one who chokes the flow of oxygen.\n\nOpens me up along the healed stitch,\n\nclears the snow inside me – she who dreams me. Knife without a handle.\n\nBreath of the avalanche which brings me forth.\n\nShe. It.\n\n(These poems are reprinted from Marzanna Kielar’s Salt Monody, trans.

Stop. Time to look at that white house, what\n\nlurks behind that bench, how that beetle wanders\n\nthe very edge of the curb, as many worlds as you can find\n\nin the fractured shadows of a window smeared with grime.\n\nYes exactly. Here. Now. Each wall around me so beautiful,\n\nthough each wall in time becomes riddled with such sadness.\n\nWrzeszcz Beauty! Or whatever Beauty you might be,\n\nthe grayness of Sosnowiec or the art deco of Gliwice,\n\nthe harshness of neo-gothic, a tapestry of styles, the stitches\n\nclosing together in every place you look, the beginnings of fairy tales,\n\nthe symbols of nothing and everything.\n\nThis world, which abides here with me.\n\nArtur Nowaczewski, born in 1978 in Gdańsk, teaches at the University of Gdańsk in the Institute of Polish Philology.

Proportions\n\noff, a frog’s perspective. And the man who acted\n\nlike a giant back home, who walked with his head\n\nin the clouds with the birds, here is kind of small\n\nand has to jump to reach, must whine, clear his throat,\n\nrub his sore neck. Hello! I’m here! I’ve come all\n\nthe way from the country of Gulliver, a Jew,\n\nstrange wherever he goes, and this beard\n\nis a thousand years of customs—maybe you\n\nwill find it useful that I can distill spirits\n\nfrom water, sugar, blood, time, and any kind of fruit.\n\nSUMMERTIME\n\nRemember those wild days in the dorm—how\n\ndid time evaporate? Driven from bed\n\nonly from such great hunger as results\n\nfrom a hundred amorous acts till we lost count\n\nof days, hours, nights. And on the only working burner\n\nin the shared kitchen, we reheated pasta\n\nand tried to divine from the darkness outside\n\nthe window whether it was Wednesday still or yet\n\nanother Thursday. And along the way time changed\n\nto summer, all our small eternities got lost\n\nat the movie’s last showing. In the Avenues, fumes\n\nand then the scent of spring: forsythia and dogwood—\n\nis that your hair? I do not know if what\n\nhas happened comes from making love, the body’s\n\nexhaustion, or the tricks of that small death\n\nwhen time, the operator, is just a number. NO END\n\nThis world, it has no end—I know, I checked:\n\nacross the ocean, a new land and people\n\nlooking to the horizon for perspective\n\nas it sags and as it lifts. And places full\n\nof other dreams in a weekend city, festive\n\ncafes and cinemas glowing with collective\n\nheads. No end to crying in dim waiting rooms,\n\nno end to the journey, even when sleeping.\n\nThis world, it’s ending—I know because I checked:\n\nacross the bed where you toss and turn again\n\nat half past five in the morning—light’s numb fleck\n\ncoming through the window—and you stretch your wet\n\nhand out but meet nothing, nothing’s there again.\n\nNot a warm body, not even any walls.\n\nAnd this is when I want to tell you, I am.\n\nIn this unimaginable way, I am.\n\nTomasz Różycki is the author of eight volumes of poetry and two prose collections.
