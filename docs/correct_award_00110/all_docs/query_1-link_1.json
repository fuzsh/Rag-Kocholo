        "text": "Wisława Szymborska\n\nPoetry\n\nEnglish\n\nPolish\n\nSwedish\n\nUtopia\n\nIsland where all becomes clear.\n\nSolid ground beneath your feet.\n\nThe only roads are those that offer access.\n\nBushes bend beneath the weight of proofs.\n\nThe Tree of Valid Supposition grows here\n\nwith branches disentangled since time immemorial.\n\nThe Tree of Understanding, dazzlingly straight and simple,\n\nsprouts by the spring called Now I Get It.\n\nThe thicker the woods, the vaster the vista:\n\nthe Valley of Obviously.\n\nIf any doubts arise, the wind dispels them instantly.\n\nEchoes stir unsummoned\n\nand eagerly explain all the secrets of the worlds.\n\nOn the right a cave where Meaning lies.\n\nOn the left the Lake of Deep Conviction.\n\nTruth breaks from the bottom and bobs to the surface.\n\nUnshakable Confidence towers over the valley.\n\nIts peak offers an excellent view of the Essence of Things.\n\nFor all its charms, the island is uninhabited,\n\nand the faint footprints scattered on its beaches\n\nturn without exception to the sea.\n\nAs if all you can do here is leave\n\nand plunge, never to return, into the depths.\n\nInto unfathomable life.\n\nBy Wisława Szymborska\n\nFrom “A large number”, 1976\n\nTranslated by S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nCopyright © Wisława Szymborska, S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nOn Death, without Exaggeration\n\nIt can’t take a joke,\n\nfind a star, make a bridge.\n\nIt knows nothing about weaving, mining, farming,\n\nbuilding ships, or baking cakes.\n\nIn our planning for tomorrow,\n\nit has the final word,\n\nwhich is always beside the point.\n\nIt can’t even get the things done\n\nthat are part of its trade:\n\ndig a grave,\n\nmake a coffin,\n\nclean up after itself.\n\nPreoccupied with killing,\n\nit does the job awkwardly,\n\nwithout system or skill.\n\nAs though each of us were its first kill.\n\nOh, it has its triumphs,\n\nbut look at its countless defeats,\n\nmissed blows,\n\nand repeat attempts!\n\nSometimes it isn’t strong enough\n\nto swat a fly from the air.\n\nMany are the caterpillars\n\nthat have outcrawled it.\n\nAll those bulbs, pods,\n\ntentacles, fins, tracheae,\n\nnuptial plumage, and winter fur\n\nshow that it has fallen behind\n\nwith its halfhearted work.\n\nIll will won’t help\n\nand even our lending a hand with wars and coups d’etat\n\nis so far not enough.\n\nHearts beat inside eggs.\n\nBabies’ skeletons grow.\n\nSeeds, hard at work, sprout their first tiny pair of leaves\n\nand sometimes even tall trees fall away.\n\nWhoever claims that it’s omnipotent\n\nis himself living proof\n\nthat it’s not.\n\nThere’s no life\n\nthat couldn’t be immortal\n\nif only for a moment.\n\nDeath\n\nalways arrives by that very moment too late.\n\nIn vain it tugs at the knob\n\nof the invisible door.\n\nAs far as you’ve come\n\ncan’t be undone.\n\nBy Wisława Szymborska\n\nFrom “The People on the Bridge”, 1986\n\nTranslated by S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nCopyright © Wisława Szymborska, S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nThe Three Oddest Words\n\nWhen I pronounce the word Future,\n\nthe first syllable already belongs to the past.\n\nWhen I pronounce the word Silence,\n\nI destroy it.\n\nWhen I pronounce the word Nothing,\n\nI make something no non-being can hold.\n\nBy Wisława Szymborska\n\nTranslated by S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nCopyright © Wisława Szymborska, S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nPossibilities\n\nI prefer movies.\n\nI prefer cats.\n\nI prefer the oaks along the Warta.\n\nI prefer Dickens to Dostoyevsky.\n\nI prefer myself liking people\n\nto myself loving mankind.\n\nI prefer keeping a needle and thread on hand, just in case.\n\nI prefer the color green.\n\nI prefer not to maintain\n\nthat reason is to blame for everything.\n\nI prefer exceptions.\n\nI prefer to leave early.\n\nI prefer talking to doctors about something else.\n\nI prefer the old fine-lined illustrations.\n\nI prefer the absurdity of writing poems\n\nto the absurdity of not writing poems.\n\nI prefer, where love’s concerned, nonspecific anniversaries\n\nthat can be celebrated every day.\n\nI prefer moralists\n\nwho promise me nothing.\n\nI prefer cunning kindness to the over-trustful kind.\n\nI prefer the earth in civvies.\n\nI prefer conquered to conquering countries.\n\nI prefer having some reservations.\n\nI prefer the hell of chaos to the hell of order.\n\nI prefer Grimms’ fairy tales to the newspapers’ front pages.\n\nI prefer leaves without flowers to flowers without leaves.\n\nI prefer dogs with uncropped tails.\n\nI prefer light eyes, since mine are dark.\n\nI prefer desk drawers.\n\nI prefer many things that I haven’t mentioned here\n\nto many things I’ve also left unsaid.\n\nI prefer zeroes on the loose\n\nto those lined up behind a cipher.\n\nI prefer the time of insects to the time of stars.\n\nI prefer to knock on wood.\n\nI prefer not to ask how much longer and when.\n\nI prefer keeping in mind even the possibility\n\nthat existence has its own reason for being.\n\nBy Wisława Szymborska\n\nFrom “Nothing Twice”, 1997\n\nTranslated by S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nCopyright © Wisława Szymborska, S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nThe Joy of Writing\n\nWhy does this written doe bound through these written woods?\n\nFor a drink of written water from a spring\n\nwhose surface will xerox her soft muzzle?\n\nWhy does she lift her head; does she hear something?\n\nPerched on four slim legs borrowed from the truth,\n\nshe pricks up her ears beneath my fingertips.\n\nSilence – this word also rustles across the page\n\nand parts the boughs\n\nthat have sprouted from the word “woods.”\n\nLying in wait, set to pounce on the blank page,\n\nare letters up to no good,\n\nclutches of clauses so subordinate\n\nthey’ll never let her get away.\n\nEach drop of ink contains a fair supply\n\nof hunters, equipped with squinting eyes behind their sights,\n\nprepared to swarm the sloping pen at any moment,\n\nsurround the doe, and slowly aim their guns.\n\nThey forget that what’s here isn’t life.\n\nOther laws, black on white, obtain.\n\nThe twinkling of an eye will take as long as I say,\n\nand will, if I wish, divide into tiny eternities,\n\nfull of bullets stopped in mid-flight.\n\nNot a thing will ever happen unless I say so.\n\nWithout my blessing, not a leaf will fall,\n\nnot a blade of grass will bend beneath that little hoof’s full stop.\n\nIs there then a world\n\nwhere I rule absolutely on fate?\n\nA time I bind with chains of signs?\n\nAn existence become endless at my bidding?\n\nThe joy of writing.\n\nThe power of preserving.\n\nRevenge of a mortal hand.\n\nBy Wisława Szymborska\n\nFrom “No End of Fun”, 1967\n\nTranslated by S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nCopyright © Wisława Szymborska, S. Baranczak & C. Cavanagh\n\nPoems selected by the Nobel Library of the Swedish Academy, and Michal Bron."
