        "text": "Poetry Dispatch No. 97 | August 23, 2006\n\nPERSPECTIVE by Wislawa Szymborska\n\nThey passed like strangers,\n\nwithout a word or gesture,\n\nher off to the store,\n\nhim heading for the car.\n\nPerhaps startled\n\nor distracted,\n\nor forgetting\n\nthat for a short while\n\nthey’d been in love forever.\n\nStill, there’s no guarantee\n\nthat it was them.\n\nMaybe yes from a distance,\n\nbut not close up.\n\nI watched them from the window,\n\nand those who observe from above\n\nare often mistaken.\n\nShe vanished beyond the glass door.\n\nHe got in behind the wheel\n\nand took off.\n\nAs if nothing had happened,\n\nif it had.\n\nAnd I, sure for just a moment\n\nthat I’d seen it,\n\nstrive to convince you, O Readers,\n\nwith this accidental little poem\n\nthat it was sad.\n\nfrom THE NEW YORKER, January 2, 2006, translated, from the Polish, by Stanislaw Baranczak and Clare Cavanagh.\n\nPolish poet and translator, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996, at the age of seventy-three. Szymborska is one of the few woman poets who have received the prize. Her early works were born more or less within the straitjacket of the Socialist Realism. Later she has expressed her pessimism about the future of mankind. While skepticism has marked Szymborska’s views of the human condition, its has not stopped her from believing in the power of words and the joy arising from imagination. Szymborska often uses ordinary speech and proverbs but gives them a fresh and arresting meaning.\n\nIs there then a world\n\nwhere I rule absolutely on fate?\n\nA time I bind with chains of signs?\n\nAn existence become endless at my bidding?\n\nThe joy of writing.\n\nThe power of preserving.\n\nRevenge of a mortal hand.\n\nfrom ‘The Joy of Writing,’ 1967\n\nWislawa Szymborska was born in Bnin (now part of Kornick) in western Poland. In 1931 her family moved to Krakow. They lived near the railway station. From the kitchen window Szymborska watched trains with enthusiasm. However, she never left Poland… After the war, from 1945 to 1948, Szymborska studied Polish literature and sociology at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. From 1953 to 1981 she worked on the Krakow literary magazine Zycie Literacia as poetry editor and columnist. As a poet Szymborska made her debut with the poem Szukam slowa which was published in the newspaper Dziennik Polski in 1945. Three years later she finished her fist collection of poems, but the book was not published. The Communist had gained power tightening their cultural policy and Szymborska’s work was considered too complex and bourgeois. She returned to the work, made it more political and her first collection DLAGTEGO ZYJEMY, appeared in 1952.\n\nLike many Poles, Szymborska became disillusioned with communism. ‘I looked back in terror where to step next…’ Her later work have been more personal and relatively apolitical, although he has noted “Apolitical poems are political too” in ‘Children of This Age’. The 1957 collection of poems, WOLANIE DO YETI (calling out to Yeti), marks her first break with socialist-realist literature. In ‘Still Life with Toy Balloon’ she wrote: “Fly off through the open window, / fly off into the wide world, / let someone cry out: Oh! / so I can weep.”\n\nSzymborska has been married twice. Since the early 1990s she has been a widow and lived in Krakow. After the Nobel award she retrested to Zakopane to escape reporters and well-wishers and to write her acceptance speech. “I’m a private person,” she told in a telephone conversation to Czeslaw Milosz, her countryman, who had won the prize in 1980, and emigrated to the United States. “… inspiration is not the exclusive privilege of poets or artists generally. There is, has been, and will always be a certain group of people whom inspiration visits. It’s made up of all those who’ve consciously chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination… Whatever inspiration is, it’s born from a continuous “I don’t know.”‘(from Nobel Lecture, 1996) Szymborska’s two poems published in the magazine Orda (1/2000) expressed her feelings of aging and strangeness – she sees that we are only visitors in a cosmic party."
