We're tryingeach of the variations on ourselves,tasting each plant that sprouts up in the yard—we should be dead already. But this jealousyis a thorn in the side—despite the fact that you'renot here, we've made a lot of progress in the artof fashioning your phantom, and we're good at it,through power failures and the animalswho come to howl at the planet. In a certain wayit's good that you're not here. Your singularitywould grow immense—since each of us still carriesa hole for you inside our hearts, so we just multiplyand gaze at the sky, at the void above the high-rise."
