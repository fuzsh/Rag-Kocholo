        "text": "This article was first published on Huffington Post as contributed content.\n\nOut of 109 Nobel Prize Winners in Literature Only 14 Have Been Women\n\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Wislawa Szymborska being awarded the Noble Prize in Literature. She was the ninth woman to win the Noble Prize for literature, and is still one of only fourteen female laureates in literature. Perhaps even more inspiring is that her reputation rests on a relatively small body of work. Asked once why she published fewer than 250 poems, she replied, “I have a trash can in my home.” That self-effacement was typical of Szymborska, who was often described as private and modest. When told she had won the Nobel Prize, she is famously said to have put her head in her hands and wailed, “Why me?” Szymborska’s diffidence towards having this honor bestowed on her might bear some similarity to the reaction by this year’s winner, Bob Dylan.\n\nIn their award citation, the Swedish Academy answered Szymborska’s question by citing her “poetry that with ironic precision allows the historical and biological context to come to light in fragments of human reality.” Her poems may have been few, but they are unforgettable.\n\nBorn in 1923, Szymborska spent most of her life in Cracow. She began writing short stories and songs as a child, and made her poetic debut in 1945. Her poems are noted for their use of wit and irony, and display an empathetic, but decidedly unsentimental, viewpoint. The Nobel Prize Committee, in their award citation, described her “as the Mozart of poetry, not without justice in view of her wealth of inspiration and the veritable ease with which her words seem to fall into place.”\n\nHer poems frequently display a poignant urgency, such as in “Conversation with a Stone,” where the speaker‘s pleas to be let inside the stone are met with growing resistance. “Even if you break me to pieces,/ we’ll all still be closed. You can grind us to sand, we still won’t let you in,” the stone replies. To which the speaker implores, “I don’t have much time/ my mortality should touch you.” When the stone dismisses the speaker with a final devastating, “I don’t have a door,” it is clear how impossible it was for the speaker to ever enter into, and understand, let alone become one with, the stone.\n\nWe all have “stones” in our lives, people or things that don’t want to understand us and want to shut us down. The “stone” in our lives may be political, religious, or personal, our immigration status, our boss, or our partner. It is our attempts at conversation, and our attempts to understand our “stones” as well as get them to understand us, that results in dialogue, and hopefully, knowledge for both us speakers and our stones."
