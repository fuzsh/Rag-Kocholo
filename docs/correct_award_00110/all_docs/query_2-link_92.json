        "text": "Here is a marvellous poem by the Nobel Prize winning Polish poet Wisława Szymborska. It is called “View with a Grain of Sand.” Never before have I seen a poem about things written from the decidedly non-human stance of the things themselves. See what you think:\n\nView with a Grain of Sand\n\nWe call it a grain of sand, but it calls itself neither grain nor sand. It does just fine without a name, whether general, particular, permanent, passing, incorrect, or apt. Our glance, our touch mean nothing to it. It doesn’t feel itself seen and touched. And that it fell on the windowsill is only our experience, not its. For it, it is no different from falling on anything else with no assurance that it is finished falling or that it is falling still. The window has a wonderful view of a lake, but the view doesn’t view itself. It exists in this world colorless, shapeless, soundless, odorless, and painless. The lake’s floor exists floorlessly, and its shore exists shorelessly. Its water feels itself neither wet nor dry and its waves to themselves are neither singular nor plural. They splash deaf to their own noise On pebbles neither large nor small. And all this beneath a sky by nature skyless in which the sun sets without setting at all and hides without hiding behind an unminding cloud. The wind ruffles it, its only reason being that it blows. A second passes. A second second. A third. But they’re three seconds only for us. Time has passed like a courier with urgent news. But that’s just our simile. The character is invented, his haste is make-believe, his news inhuman.\n\nRate this:\n\nThe beginning of this year has introduced me to two great Eastern European poetesses. I think I will be reading a lot of their poems in the months to come. I have already written a couple of postings about Marina Tsvetaeva—and I am just getting started! Earlier, I posted a poem by Wisława Szymborska, but now I am starting to get serious about her as well, what with her curious mixture of humor and profundity. You can find an example of those two traits in this poem:\n\nIn Praise of Self-Deprecation\n\nThe buzzard has nothing to fault himself with.\n\nScruples are alien to the black panther.\n\nPiranhas do not doubt the rightness of their actions.\n\nThe rattlesnake approves of himself without reservations.\n\nThe self-critical jackal does not exist.\n\nThe locust, alligator, trichina, horsefly\n\nlive as they live and are glad of it.\n\nThe killer-whale’s heart weighs one hundred kilos\n\nbut in other respects it is light.\n\nThere is nothing more animal-like\n\nthan a clear conscience\n\non the third planet of the Sun.\n\nI am still working in the smug self-satisfaction of Republicans, but I am nowhere near Wisława in poetic ability, so I’ll just let her have her say. If you are interested in reading more of her poetry, I suggest you find a copy of Sounds, Feelings, Thoughts: Seventy Poems by Wisława Szymborska (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981). Szymborska won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1996.\n\n34.052234\n\n-118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nEvery once in a while, the Nobel Prize Committee makes a correct choice, and Polish poet Wisława Szymborska is certainly one—one of the few in recent years who is deserving of the honor. Here is a poem entitled “Lot’s Wife,” about a woman who, while fleeing with her husband Lot from the destruction soon to overcome Sodom, was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back:\n\nThey say I looked back from curiosity.\n\nBut I could have had reasons other than curiosity.\n\nI looked back from regret for a silver bowl.\n\nFrom distraction while fastening the latchet of my sandal.\n\nTo avoid looking longer at the righteous neck\n\nof Lot my husband.\n\nFrom sudden certainty that had I died\n\nhe would not even have slowed his step.\n\nFrom the disobedience of the meek.\n\nAlert to the pursuit.\n\nSuddenly serene, hopeful that God had changed His mind.\n\nOur two daughters were almost over the hilltop.\n\nI felt old age within me. Remoteness.\n\nThe futility of our wandering. Sleepiness.\n\nI looked back while laying my bundle on the ground.\n\nI looked back from fear of where next to set my foot.\n\nOn my path appeared serpents,\n\nspiders, field mice, and fledgling vultures.\n\nBy now it was neither the righteous nor the wicked—simply all living creatures\n\ncrept and leapt in common panic.\n\nI looked back from loneliness.\n\nFrom shame that I was stealing away.\n\nFrom a desire to shout, to return.\n\nOr just when a sudden gust of wind\n\nundid my hair and lifted up my garment.\n\nI had the impression they watched it all from the walls of Sodom\n\nand burst out in loud laughter time and time again.\n\nI looked back from anger.\n\nTo relish their great ruin.\n\nI looked back for all the reasons I have mentioned.\n\nI looked back despite myself.\n\nIt was only a rock that turned back, growling under foot.\n\nA sudden crevice that cut my path.\n\nOn the edge a hamster scampered up on his two hind feet.\n\nIt was then that we both glanced back.\n\nNo. No. I ran on.\n\nI crept and clambered up,\n\nuntil the darkness crashed down from heaven,\n\nand with it, burning gravel and dead birds.\n\nFor lack of breath I spun about repeatedly.\n\nIf anyone had seen me, he might have thought me dancing.\n\nIt was not ruled out that my eyes were open.\n\nIt could be that I fell, my face turned toward the city.\n\nPerhaps Szymborska’s beloved and much beleaguered Poland was that Sodom, unjustly punished by history for being positioned between two ogres that alternately and in combination devoured it for no good reason.\n\n34.052234\n\n-118.243685\n\nRate this:"
