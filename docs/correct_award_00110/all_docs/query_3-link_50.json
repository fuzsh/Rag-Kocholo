        "text": "Polish author Olga Tokarczuk ​​​​​and Austrian writer Peter Handke have won the Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nThe 8 million Swedish kronor (about $1.2 million CAD) prize, which has been given out since 1901, recognizes authors who have \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.\"\n\nTwo prizes were awarded in 2019, as no Nobel Prize for literature was given out in 2018.\n\nTokarczuk won the 2018 prize and Handke won the 2019 prize.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 literature awards were chosen by the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee, a new body made up of four academy members and five \"external specialists.\"\n\nNobel organizers said the committee suggests two names that then must be approved by the Swedish Academy.\n\nOlga Tokarczuk, an imaginative writer\n\nTokarczuk is being recognized \"for a narrative imagination that with encyclopedic passion represents the crossing of boundaries as a form of life.\"\n\nTokarczuk, born in 1962, is one of Poland's most popular and successful authors, known for celebrating the cultural diversity of Poland.\n\nShe has won the Nike Literary Award, Polish's most prestigious literary prize, twice, in 2008 and 2015. Her novel Flights, which was translated by Jennifer Croft, won the International Booker Prize in 2018.\n\nHer most recent novel is Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead, which was a finalist for the 2019 International Booker Prize.\n\nIn 2015, she received the International Bridge Prize, A German-Polish Prize that recognizes people dedicated to the promotion of peace and democracy in Europe.\n\nTokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the literature prize in more than a century.\n\nShe is also the first female Nobel recipient so far in 2019.\n\nThe last Polish writer to win the Nobel Prize for literature was poet Wislawa Szymborska in 1996.\n\nPeter Handke, a controversial novelist and filmmaker\n\nHandke is an accomplished novelist, playwright, filmmaker and translator, who has written dozens of works since first being published in 1966.\n\nHe is being recognized \"for an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\"\n\nHe wrote the experimental 1966 play Offending the Audience and the 1972 novel The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, but may be best known for writing the 1987 novel Wings of Desire.\n\nHandke was born in Austria in 1942. He was raised by a single mother, who committed suicide in 1971. Handke would write about her suicide and reflect on her life in the 1972 novel A Sorrow Beyond Dreams.\n\nHis 1978 film The Left–Handed Woman, which was based on his own novel, was nominated for the Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival. He would go on to direct a second film based on another one of his books, The Absence in 1992, and was heavily involved in the adaptation of Wings of Desire.\n\nHe would collaborate with German filmmaker Wes Wenders on four films, The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty (1972), The Wrong Move (1975), Wings of Desire (1987) and The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez (2016).\n\nHandke has previously won the Franz Kafka Prize in 2006 and the International Ibsen Award in 2014.\n\nSome jury members resigned after Handke won the Ibsen award because of Handke's political views.\n\nHandke produced a travelogue in 1996 that showed sympathy for the Serbs as victims of the Balkan wars.\n\nHe famously won the Heinrich Heine Prize in 2006, only to have the prize rescinded. The prize is awarded by the city Duesseldorf, and the city council must vote to approve prize recipient. They did not approve Handke because of his pro-Serbian statements and writings.\n\nThe last Austrian to win the Nobel Prize for literature was Elfriede Jelinek in 2004.\n\nNo Nobel Prize awarded in 2018\n\nThe prize was cancelled in 2018 after a mass exodus at the Swedish Academy following sex abuse allegations.\n\nJean-Claude Arnault, husband of a former academy member, was convicted in 2018 for two rapes in 2011.\n\nArnault allegedly also leaked the name of Nobel Prize for literature winners seven times.\n\nThe academy announced on May 4, 2018 that the prize would be not awarded that year \"in view of the currently diminished academy and the reduced public confidence.\"\n\nIt was the first time since 1943 that the award was not handed out.\n\nIn his will, Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel specifically designated the Swedish Academy as the institution responsible for the Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nThe winners are always announced in October and the Nobel Prizes are presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.\n\nThe last recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature was Kazuo Ishiguro in 2017.\n\nTwo Canadians have won the Nobel Prize for literature: Saul Bellow (a Canadian-born American) in 1976 and Alice Munro in 2013.\n\nOther past winners include American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, Russian historian and essayist Svetlana Alexievich, Irish poet Seamus Heaney and American novelist Toni Morrison.\n\nTwo prizes yet to be awarded\n\nThe other 2019 Nobel Prize winners include three scientists who discovered how cells use oxygen, three scientists contributed to the development of lithium-ion batteries, Canadian James Peebles \"for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology,\" and to Swiss physicists for discovering an exoplanet.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday, Oct. 11.\n\nThe economics prize will be awarded on Monday, Oct. 14. Officially known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, it wasn't created by Nobel, but by Riksbanken, Sweden's central bank, in 1968.\n\nWith files from the Associated Press."
