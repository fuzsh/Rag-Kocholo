        "text": "Volodymyr-Volynskyy, city, northwestern Ukraine. The city is situated on the Luha River where it is crossed by the Kovel-Lviv railway. It was founded by Vladimir I, grand prince of Kiev, in the 10th century and became the capital of one of the chief princedoms of Kievan Rus. After coming under Lithuanian rule in the 14th century and Polish rule in 1569, it passed to Russia in 1795 and back to Poland in 1919. In 1939 the area was annexed by the Soviet Union, which formalized the annexation in 1945. Among the cityâ€™s architectural monuments is the Cathedral of the Assumption, built in 1160. One of its principal industries has been the processing of agricultural products. Pop. (2001) 38,256; (2005 est.) 38,111."
