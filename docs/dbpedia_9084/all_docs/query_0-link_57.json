There is now a link at the bottom to the entire Mongol Empire & Rus’ series.]\n\n1241 Central Europe invasion, movement, and exit routes; Josef Szabo.\n\nSource: Academia – Mongol Invasion of 1241\n\nThe Strategy for Conquering Hungary\n\nFollowing the fall of Kyiv on 6 December 1240, the Mongol armies moved west into Galicia-Volhynia. They took additional cities, particularly Volodymyr-Volynskyi [Vladimir-in-Volhynia], despite any submission agreement they may have made with Prince Danylo Romanovich of Galicia-Volhynia. Mongol submission agreements were total: We will allow you to live if you supply us without resistance whatever we request. Details of what happened are sketchy; it may be that Danylo didn’t understand the total nature of a submission agreement he may (or may not) have accepted; he may not have communicated the details of the agreement to his officers, boyars and subjects; the city of Volodymyr may have known the details but chose to resist anyway, forcing the Mongols to storm the city which then took quite a beating. The upshot was that Batu’s army took whatever they needed from Galicia-Volhynia as a whole and moved on.\n\nAs usual, General Subutai had not been sleeping and had sent spies westward in all directions. The formidable range of the Carpathian Mountains surrounded Hungary on all sides but the west, providing a protective barrier against armies from Rus’ and the steppe. The mountains are not towering as are the Caucasus — the highest point, Gerlachovský Štít is 8,711 ft. (2855 m) — but they are rugged. Passes through the mountains must be located, pass defenses and fortifications must be assessed, the cities, rivers, forests and plains of Hungary must be understood, and any Hungarian allies must be discovered and neutralized. The last item required similar spying, particularly on the Poles, the Slavic on-and-off-again allies of both Rus’ and Hungarians who occupied the plains and forests north of the Carpathians.\n\nCity of Przemyśl located in Poland 55 miles west of Lviv, Ukraine.\n\nGoogle Map snapshot.\n\nThe Mongol armies crossed the Galician border into Poland and took up positions around Przemyśl, located on the San River, just west of the modern-day border between Poland and Ukraine. Here they organized their forces, and in late December 1240 or January 1241 held a kurultai. They sent a final ultimatum to King Béla IV of Hungary which included: “Word has come to me that you have taken the Cumans, our servants, under your protection. Cease harboring them, or you will make of me an enemy because of them. They, who have no houses and dwell in tents, will find it easy to escape. But you who dwell in houses within towns—how can you escape me?” Béla rejected the ultimatum and sent heralds throughout Hungary carrying a bloody sword, the traditional symbol for a national emergency, to rally the nobles and vassals to the kingdom’s defense. He called upon the tens of thousands of Cumans who had taken refuge in Hungary: it was now time for them to return the favor.\n\nPrzemyśl Castle North Wing in 2015, now a café.\n\nSource: Wikipedia – Przemyśl\n\nDivide and Conquer\n\nThe primary strategy was concentration of force to defeat in detail — commonly known as “divide and conquer.” The Mongol army would be split into many smaller forces. The largest division, commanded by Batu and Subutai, would take the direct route through the Carpathian Mountains towards Hungary through the “Russian Gate,” or Verecke Pass. Once the gate was passed, Shayban‘s force would speed directly to Pest and there harass the Hungarians with minor attacks and taunting. If they were counter-attacked, they would avoid engagement and flee, relying on their speed, maneuverability and their disinterest in “honorable” battle for glory. This would help engender the belief in the Hungarians that the Mongols were essentially cowardly and could be pursued with little danger to oneself. Meanwhile, Batu and Subutai would move more slowly towards the town of Mohi on the Sajó River, a tributary of the Danube. The site Subutai selected had a narrow bridge over the Sajó. On the east side were extensive forests to provide cover for tens of thousands of Mongol cavalry. Here the main battle with the Hungarians would take place. Meanwhile, another army would go north of the Carpathians into Poland and create sufficient havoc to deter the Poles from sending any support to the Hungarians. At the same time, a third force would travel down the east side of the Carpathians, split into three smaller forces, cross the Carpathians through three separate passes, spread terror and disorder throughout Transylvania and prevent them from supporting the Hungarian king when he sought their help.\n\nPicture above. Concentration of force, one location at a time, to defeat in detail the enemy. Napoleon (blue) is outnumbered 20,000 to 12,000 in the Italian campaign, yet by concentrating 88% of his force at one location, he faces only smaller forces, defeating them one-by-one until the enemy flees. Organization and rapid maneuverability are necessary. The Mongols (12,000-20,000 men to start with) were vastly outnumbered by the total of Polish forces, yet by moving quickly and facing them city by city, they always had the numerical advantage, until Legnica, the final Polish battle.\n\nSource: YouTube video – Montemayor Defeat in Detail\n\nThe overall result was three major armies, each splitting into two or more smaller divisions, simultaneously attacking across a broad front from northern Poland to Transylvania (now part of Romania). Each army would be large enough to defeat any of the relatively small and disorganized armies of the cities and towns they chose to engage. At the same time, they would create a vast circle around the main Hungarian army while spreading terror and bloodshed everywhere. In the 13th century, only the Mongols would think of such an enormous plan; only the Mongols, with their speed, communication, weaponry, battle tactics, siege equipment, firebombs, gunpowder and ability to spread terror all around could carry it off.\n\nBefore attacking Hungary proper they would make certain that none of Hungary’s neighbors sent reinforcements. The Poles, Germans and Bohemians might help the Huns, as might the Austrians, Croats, Bulgarians or Cumans to the east, south and southwest. If the Mongols threatened and terrorized them a bit, these neighbors would be reluctant to endanger any of their own (or remaining) troops or leave their own citizens defenseless in order to help their often annoying and belligerent Hungarian neighbor. Let the Hungarians take a beating, they might conclude; perhaps the Mongols will ignore us.\n\nPrzemyśl Cathedral, city in background.\n\nSource: Wikipedia – Przemyśl\n\nRashīd al-Dīn’s Invasion Narrative\n\nRashīd al-Dīn’s version of the invasion of Central Europe following the Mongol conquest of the lands of the Rus’ is brief. In his Successors of Genghis Khan it covers pages 69-72, about half of which are footnotes. Items in [brackets] are translations, explanations or corrections from the translator or myself.\n\nIn the hüker yül [year of the Ox, 1241] Qa’an died, and in the middle of the spring month they crossed the *Qazaq-Taq [Carpathian] mountains in the direction of the Bular and the Bashghïrd [colloquial for “the Hungarians”].\n\nOrda, setting out on the right, passed through the land of the Ïla’ut [Poles]. [Prince Boleslaw of Sandomierz, perhaps] came against them with an army, but they defeated him.\n\nQadan and Büri took the field against the Sasan [Saxons of Transylvania] people and defeated that people after three battles.\n\nBōchek proceeded by way of the Qara-Ulagh [Moldavia] crossing the mountains of those parts and defeating the Ulagh [Vlach: Walachian, non-Slav] peoples. From thence, through the forests and mountains of *Qazaq-Taq [Carpathians] they reached the territory of Mishlav [Mieczyslaw, Duke of Opole, possibly] and attacked the rebels who were standing in readiness there.\n\nThe princes, proceeding by these five routes, seized all the territories of the Bashghïrd, Majar [both are Hungarians], and Sas, [Saxons] and put their king, Keler [Béla], to flight. They spent the summer on the Tisa [Tisza] and Tanha [Danube] rivers.\n\nQadan now took the field with an army, captured the territories of the Taqut, [possibly Croatians] Arbaraq [unknown] and Asraf [Serbs, perhaps] and pursued Keler [Béla], the king of those countries, to the seacoast. When [Béla] embarked on a ship in the town of [Split or Trogir] which lies on the coast, and put to sea, Qadan turned back and after much fighting captured Qïrqïn and Qïla [possibly Turks, Kipchaks or Cumans] in the town of the Ulaqut [Vlachs].\n\nThe news of Qa’an’s death had not yet reached them. Then in the Year of the Leopard, [1242] a number of Qïpchaq had come to fight with Köten and Shingqur [probably should be emended to read: “… a number of Koten’s Qipchaq had come to fight with Shinqur], the son of Jochi. They gave battle and the Qïpchaq were defeated. In the autumn they returned again and passed into the region of Temür-Qahalqa [Darband] and the mountains of those parts. They gave an army to Ïla’udur [unknown] and dispatched him against them. He proceeded thither and defeated the Qïpchaq, who had fled to that region. They subjugated the Urungqut and Badach [possibly Kipchaks or Turks] and brought [back] their envoys.\n\nThe whole of that year was passed in that region. In the beginning of the taulai yïl, that is, the Year of the Hare, corresponding to the months of the year 640/1242-1243 [1243], having completed the task of conquering that country, they turned back. Traveling throughout the summer and winter, they reached their ulus [home country, villages, etc.] in the mogha yïl, that is, the Year of the Snake [error, the Snake was 1244-1245], corresponding to the months of the year 641/1243-1244, and alighted in their own ordos. And God best knows the truth.\n\n— Successors of Genghis Khan pgs 69-72\n\nFrankly, Rashid al-Din’s description is of little help: little detail, a bit disjointed with some sequence errors.

The following paragraphs draw from his book’s argument on pages 85-86 and 109-112.\n\nWhen the Mongols took Chernigov in October 1239, they did not execute the city’s Bishop Porfiry, but took him to the nearby, previously conquered town of Glukhov [Hluxiv, Hlukhiv]. According to the Sofiyskiy First Chronicle, the Novgorod Fourth Chronicle, and the Hypatian Chronicle (in an adulterated form under the incorrect year 1234 CE), from there (i.e., Chernigov or Glukhov) the “Tatars came to Kiev in peace and negotiated a settlement with ‘Mstislav and Vladimir and Daniil.'” That would be 1) Mstislav Glebovich, the unsuccessful defender of Chernigov and second in seniority/authority among the Olgovichi after Mikhail; 2) Vladimir Ryurikovich, the senior Rostislavichi, former prince of Smolensk (1213-1219) and Grand Prince of Kyiv (1223-1235), and cited by many sources as died 3 March 1239 (a date which creates a problem); and 3) Daniil Romanovich, the prince of Galicia-Volyn’. Significantly, Mikhail Vsevolodovich of Chernigov and Kyiv was not included in this settlement.\n\nThese sources do not state the nature of the settlement. But a peace agreement could only mean that the Rus’ agreed to Mongols’ demands. The rulers of Smolensk and Chernigov had no choice but to unconditionally sign due to their defeated circumstances. Volhynia and Galicia had not yet been invaded, yet Danylo apparently accepted the Mongols’ terms, and thereby became the only major Rus’ prince to submit prior to invasion. A careful reading of the various texts brings Dimnik to the following scenario.\n\nDimnik’s Scenario\n\nAfter the fall of Chernigov the Mongols sent emissaries, led by Möngke, to Kyiv to negotiate with Mikhail. Mikhail would not agree to submit. It is possible that he was intellectually and emotionally influenced by the discussions that took place during the 1223 Mongol exploration/invasion — discussions which he had attended — when the princes rejected peace offerings from the Mongols and executed their emissaries. But this time the three princes Mstislav, Vladimir and Danylo did agree to submission. It may be after a second visit by Mongol envoys seeking his submission that Mikhail had them killed. After Mikhail fled Kyiv for Hungary during the winter of 1239-40, Rostislav Mstislavich of Smolensk occupied Kyiv for a while until he was ejected by Danylo who installed some of his own troops under the leadership of his voivode Dmytro.\n\nLater in 1240, with the adjacent principalities of Pereyaslavl and Chernigov fallen, Kyiv under dire threat and the Mongols apparently readying themselves to move west towards his own lands, Danylo strangely chose to leave his lands leaderless and ride off to Hungary, intending to persuade King Béla to accept his son Lev as husband for Béla’s favorite daughter, Anna of Hungary, later Baness of Macsó. Danylo didn’t seem too concerned that the Mongols might suddenly press west. He was still in Hungary when Kyiv fell on 6 December 1240.\n\nLands of Volyn’ and Galicia, Map 4.\n\nShowing Mongol battle sites following fall of Kyiv.\n\nSource: Chtyvo.Org – Dimnik, Martin/Mikhail Prince of Chernigov\n\n[I was relieved to see that author Dimnik had as much trouble and uncertainty finding these locations on a map as I did.]\n\nBatu learned that Danylo was in Hungary and set out with his armies toward Volhynia. On the way he captures Kolodyazhen and Kamenets, fails to take Kremenets and Danilov, then takes Vladimir by storm and devastates Galich as well as “many other towns.” Finally, Dmytro, who is now accompanying Batu, counseled Batu to move on to Hungary, warning the khan that if he remained in the land of Rus’, the people would rise up against him and they would never be able to return home. Dmytro advised Batu in this manner, says the chronicler, because he saw that the people of Rus’ were perishing under the Tatar onslaught.\n\nStill in Hungary, Danylo does not hear of Kyiv’s fall, but when Béla rejects his offer, Danylo leaves for home. Along the way “he met fugitives fleeing before the advancing enemy [and learned] of the calamity which had befallen his principality. Since he had a small druzhina [personal guard] accompanying him he could not pass through the land of Rus’ and so he returned to Hungary.”\n\nMosaic of Daniel of Kyiv and Galicia-Volhynia.\n\nSource: Wikipedia – Daniel of Galicia\n\nDimnik writes:\n\nThe episode concerning Dmitry’s relations with the Tatars is enigmatic; it appears that the chronicler attempted to whitewash the voevoda’s complicity with the enemy. He claims that after the Tatars captured Kiev they did not kill Dmitry ‘because of his bravery.’ This explanation is not convincing since no other commander or prince who opposed the Tatars was spared for his courage.\n\n— Mikhail, Prince of Chernigov and Grand Prince of Kyiv, 1224-1246, Dimnik, Martin; Pontifical Institute of Midiaeval Studies, Toronto, Canada, 1981. Pg. 110.\n\nDimnik points out that the Mongols executed the defending prince of Ryazan’. At Rostov-Suzdal’ they tried to persuade Prince Vasil’ko Konstantinovich to “capitulate to their terms and to fight with them,” (pg. 110) and when he refused, they executed him. When Mstislav, Vladimir and Danylo came to terms with the Mongols at Kyiv, they were not killed. It is more reasonable to conclude that Dmytro’s life was spared at Kyiv not because of his bravery, but because he agreed to cooperate with them in accordance with Danylo’s agreement of a year earlier. The fact that Dmytro accompanied Batu into Volyn’ supports this interpretation.\n\nThe Mongols leave Kyiv and head west. They take Kolodyazhen and Kamenets, which are in the Principality of Kyiv, not part of Danylo’s lands. They enter the Principality of Volyn’, Danylo’s lands, and when Batu “saw that he could not take Kremenec and the city of Danilov he left them…” (Galician-Volynian Chronicle Pg. 49). It’s exceedingly hard to believe that Batu believed the entire Mongol army, catapults, battering rams and all, could not take two small towns. Far more likely he passed them by due to his agreement with Danylo. Batu then takes Vladimir (city) which as of 1241 Danylo no longer considered his capital. They take Galich [Halych] and “innumerable other towns.”\n\nDimnik observes that the Mongols undoubted ransacked and pillaged Galicia and Volhynia to gather provisions for their coming winter battles in Poland and Hungary. The cities of Volodimer and Halyč may have put up an argument despite Danylo’s agreement with the Mongols, and had to be stormed, with resulting loss of life. Dimnik is suspicious of the claim that the Mongols destroyed “many other cities,” for if they had, the names of the cities would certainly have been listed by the usually diligent writer of the Galician-Volynian Chronicle.\n\nInteractive Google MyMap.

Submission meant full cooperation with whatever the Mongols asked, when they asked it, in exchange for sparing the lives of most citizens. Danylo was likely expecting something more lenient, more appreciative of all that he was doing for the Mongols, more rewarding. If so he was sadly mistaken, as were nearly all of the people of the Rus’ throughout these battles stretching over five years. They never understood just who and what they were dealing with, these mysterious barbarians from beyond the eastern steppe. General Subutai, on the other hand, always spent a great deal of time, energy and manpower gathering information on his next foes, and all his important battles were planned out in advance. Whether or not he knew of Sun Tzu’s dictum, he lived by it.\n\nIn war the successful strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.\n\n— Sun Tzu, circa 450 BCE\n\nTraditional 16th century Ukrainian wooden church in Old Halych.\n\nSource: Wikipedia – Halych\n\nThe next few years were very difficult for Danylo and his lands. He spent a great deal of his time in Hungary, Mazovia and elsewhere in Poland, afraid to return to Galicia and Volhynia as long as the Mongols were present.\n\nEntire Mongol Empire & Rus’ Series: Click Here\n\nFirst Installment: Why didn’t the Mongols Conquer Europe in the 13th Century?\n\nPrevious Installment: Galicia & Volhynia || Mongol Empire LXXIII\n\nNext Installment: Central European Invasion Strategy || Mongol Empire LXXV\n\nThis Installment: Danylo’s Separate Peace || Mongol Empire LXXIV\n\nSources\n\nThe Galician-Volynian Chronicle; Perfecky, George A., translator; Harvard Series in Ukrainian Studies Volume 16, II, 1973.

The eldest son of Roman II Mstislavich “the Great” who united and ruled Volhynia and Halych, his troubles began early when — at the age of four — his father died. The boyars [powerful elite] of Galicia quickly forced him, his mother Anna of Byzantium and younger brother Vasylko into exile. In 1213 the boyars elected a prince from among themselves, whereupon the Polish and Hungarians joined forces and invaded Galicia, purportedly to put the Romanovichi back in power, but in reality to divide the principality between themselves. In 1219 Danylo renounced his claim to Galicia in favor of his father-in-law Mstislav Mstislavich the Bold.\n\n15th century Duchy of Belz in center, Lviv to south, Lutsk to northeast, Lublin in Poland to northwest. Source: Wikipedia – Duchy of Belz\n\nIn 1221, now all of twenty years old, Danylo took control of Volhynia, the principality north of Galicia, whose boyars and people had remained loyal to the Romanovich dynasty. In 1234 he took control of the adjacent Duchy of Belz by defeating Alexander Vsevolodovich. By 1238 he had defeated the Order of Dobrzyń Knights, a Mazovian Polish group. He now controlled most of Galicia including Halych, the capital. During the following year he attempted to conquer the Yotvingians, a Baltic tribe encroaching on the northern border of Galicia-Volhynia. In the winter of 1239-40 the Mongol presence entered his life when his brother-in-law, Mikhail of Chernigov and Kyiv, called on him for help.\n\nA map of the Baltic Tribes, circa 1200 AD.

On their second visit Mikhail ordered the emissaries executed, following which he fled Kyiv for Hungary. There he offered his son Rostislav Mikhailovich as husband for Hungarian King Béla IV’s daughter Anna, hoping to create an alliance with Hungary against the Mongols. In his absence, Danylo took control of Kyiv and installed his voivode Dmytro, who remained to defend the city against the Mongols. Damytro was wounded by an Mongol arrow when the city was taken on 6 December 1240.\n\nKing Béla IV of Hungary (b.1206-d.1270) in Chronica Hungarorum, 1488, artist Johannes Thuróczy. Source: Wikipedia – Béla IV of Hungary\n\nAfter King Béla ejected them from Hungary, Mikhail and Rostislav went to Mazovia in Poland to see Mikhail’s uncle Conrad, the local ruler. From there Mikhail sent envoys to Danylo seeking reconciliation, promising to cease antagonizing him and to stop trying to seize Halych from Danylo. Danylo suggested that Mikhail come to Volhynia to discuss the situation and Mikhail accepted. There Danylo greeted him and gave him back his wife who had been kidnapped from Chernigov in 1239 by Yaroslav Vsevolodovich of Vladimir-Suzdal, and from whom Danylo extracted her. Danylo also gave the city of Lutsk to Rostislav, apparently to offset his taking the throne of Halych from Mikhail in 1237. Mikhail stayed on with Danylo until he learned of the siege and fall of Kyiv in December 1240, with great destruction and loss of life. Mikhail then returned to Mazovia, perhaps to take his wife to a safer location.\n\nLands of Volyn’ and Galicia, Map 4\n\nShowing Mongol battle sites following fall of Kyiv.\n\nSource: Chtyvo.Org – Dimnik, Martin/Mikhail Prince of Chernigov\n\nThe Galician-Volynian Chronicle\n\nThe Galician-Volynian Chronicle goes into an enormous amount of detail to cover the next few years following the fall of Kyiv, integral for the history of the Rus’ but not for the history of the Mongols. We will satisfy ourselves with a few brief excerpts, picking up where we left off with the Mongols sparing Dmytro’s life at Kyiv.\n\nAt that time Danilo had gone to Hungary to the king and had not heard yet of the attack of the heathen Tatars on Kiev. When Batyj took Kiev, he heard that Danilo was in Hungary and set out in person toward Volodimer’. He came to the city of Kolodjažen and set up twelve catapults, but could not make a breach in the walls. He began persuading the people [to surrender]. They listened to his evil advice, surrendered and were slaughtered [by the Tatars. Then Batyj] came to Kamenec and Izjaslavl’ and took them [also]. When he saw that he could not take Kremenec and the city of Danilov he left them, came to Volodimer’ and took it by storm. He slaughtered its inhabitants without mercy as well as the inhabitants of Halyč and of many other cities whose number cannot be determined. [Then] Dmitro, Danilo’s tysjackij [General] in Kiev, addressed Batyj “You cannot tarry long in this land; it is time you marched against Hungary, for if you delay, this land is strong: its people will mass against you and will not let you return to your own land”. He told him this because he saw that the land of Rus’ was perishing at [the hands of] the infidel. Batyj heeded Dmitro’s advice and went to Hungary. King Béla and Koloman (12. IV. 1241) met [the Tatars] on the river Sajo. The armies came to blows, and the Hungarians fled; the Tatars pursued them up to the Danube. After their victory they remained three years [in Hungary].\n\n— The Galician-Volynian Chronicle; Perfecky, George A., translator; Harvard Series in Ukrainian Studies Volume 16, II, 1973 Pg. 49.\n\nThe above quote contains what seems to be an example of 13th-century public relations spin, something that has certainly been around for a very long time: Dmytro tells Batu that he should move on to Hungary, for if he lingers in Rus’, the people will unite and kill them all (“not let them return to your own land”). That Batu would listen to and follow this suggestion seems absurd; the Mongols move when they are good and ready, and the likelihood the Rus’ could unite and defeat the Mongols was nil. There may be more here than meets the eye.\n\nThe next mention of the Mongols in this Chronicle comes a few years later, when the Mongols — after vacating Hungary — re-enter Galicia from the west.\n\n(Spring 1242) While Danilo and Vasilko were pursuing him [Rostislav Mikhailovich from Halyč to Ščekotov], news came to them that the Tatars left Hungary and were marching into the Galician land. And this news saved [Rostislav, but] several of his boyars were captured.\n\n— Galician-Volynian Chronicle, Pg. 49.\n\nEntire Mongol Empire & Rus’ Series: Click Here\n\nFirst Installment: Why didn’t the Mongols Conquer Europe in the 13th Century?\n\nPrevious Installment: Storming Kyiv || Mongol Empire LXXII\n\nNext Installment: Danylo’s Separate Peace || Mongol Empire LXXIV\n\nThis Installment: Galicia & Volhynia || Mongol Empire LXXIII\n\nSources\n\nThe Galician-Volynian Chronicle; Perfecky, George A., translator; Harvard Series in Ukrainian Studies Volume 16, II, 1973.

When the Dnieper River finally froze sufficiently solid, the Mongol army crossed. Batu’s army easily overran the Black Hat border guards. Möngke’s army may have already been waiting across the river from Kiev, and on 28 November 1240, the armies united outside the gates of Kyiv. A line of trees extended almost to the city walls near the “Ljadskije Vorota” [Polish Gate], one of Kyiv’s three gates and located on the northwest quarter of the city wall. The Mongols used these trees as cover while they brought forward their catapults and ballistae.\n\nChurch of the Tithes in Kyiv, 19th Century.\n\nSource: Wikipedia – Church of the Tithes\n\nThe bombardment began, lasting several days. Large stones were hurled to break the walls and crush city buildings. Ballistae and catapults flung flaming spear-sized arrows and balls of naphtha-soaked cotton, setting fires within the city. On 6 December the walls were breached. The Galician-Volynian chronicler writes: “…here one could see lance break against lance, shield scrape against shield as the besiegers met the besieged in mortal combat. Then a barrage of arrows eclipsed the light of the defeated.” Hand-to-hand combat followed in the streets. The Kyivans suffered heavy losses; Voivode Dmytro was wounded by a Mongol arrow. As night fell the Kyivans retreated to their city center. The Church of the Tithes [Church of the Dormition [death] of the Virgin] became packed with terrified crowds.\n\nRuin of Church of the Tithes in 1857, by Erazm Fabijański.\n\nSource: Wikipedia – Church of the Tithes\n\nThe final assault came the following morning. So many Kyivans crowded onto the church’s balcony (or dome) that it collapsed from the weight and many were crushed. The battle soon ended, the Mongols plundered the city, and the massacre of the citizens began. None of the texts say whether it was in retribution for Mikhail’s execution of the Mongol emissaries, or for their refusal to surrender. The Galician-Volynian Chronicle cites several examples of the Mongols slaughtering citizens elsewhere for no particular reason. Out of 50,000 inhabitants before the invasion, reportedly only 2,000 survived. Only six out of forty major buildings survived the fires. The Chronicle says that voivode Dmytro’s bravery and determination to fight on despite his wounds won admiration from the Mongols and they granted him mercy. Occasionally they did honor a foe’s bravery, but this particular instance is in dispute, as we shall see.\n\nCapture of Kyiv by the Mongols in 1240, 16th century.\n\nSource: Wikipedia – Siege of Kyiv\n\nIn February 1246, the Pope’s envoy to the Mongol Great Khan, Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, traveled through Kyiv on his way to Karakorum in Mongolia and wrote:\n\nWhich being done, they set forward against Russia, and made foule hauocke there, destroying cities and castles and murthering the people. They layd siege a long while vnto Kiow the chiefe citie of Russia, and at length they tooke it and slue the citizens. Whereupon, traueiling through that countrey, wee found an innumerable multitude of dead mens skulles and bones lying vpon the earth.

In the quote below, the “town of Üch-Oghul-Üledemür” refers to the three children [“üch Oghul”] — Danylo, Vasylko and a daughter (Elena or Fedora] — of Roman the Great who ruled Volhynia (1170-1205) and Halych (1198-1205); the town itself is Volodymyr-in-Volhynia [Volodymyr-Volynskyi] or possibly Halych. The quote below indicates that the armies spread out as they did in northern Rus’ in 1238, once again taking as many cities as they could as quickly as they could. Central Europe awaited.\n\nThen they proceeded in a hunting ring, tümen by tümen, against all the towns of Üledemür [Vladimir] seizing the castles and lands that lay across their path.

A hand-powered trebuchet flings a naphtha bomb; the Khan has a mobile ger-on-a-cart.\n\nSource: OnThisDay – Mongol Siege of Kyiv\n\nA Brief Recapitulation\n\nFollowing the fall of Chernigov on October 18, 1239 CE, Batu Khan sent at least two sets of emissaries with polite requests to Mikhail Vsevolodovich in Kyiv, requesting the city’s complete submission. Möngke Khan accompanied one or both of them. The first emissaries returned alive but without success. The second set were equally unsuccessful and were executed by Mikhail. Möngke admired the buildings of Kyiv from the east bank of the Dnieper River and probably from within the city as well. During the winter of 1240 Möngke would return several times as spy to examine the city, its approaches and its walls. Apparently Möngke really did fall in love with Kyiv and loathed to see it destroyed, much like his uncle Jochi who — fifteen years earlier — fell in love with the city of Urgenchi in the northern Khwarazmid Empire.\n\nWithin Kyiv Mikhail’s remaining reliable forces were the city’s militia and his own druzhina [personal guards], obviously utterly insufficient to fend off a besieging Mongol army. He took his son Rostislav, who was 25-30 years old, and fled to Hungary where he attempted to convince King Béla IV that his son would make a fine husband for the king’s favorite daughter, Anna. In his absence, Danylo Romanovich of Halych took control of Kyiv and installed his voivode Dmytro to defend the city. Dmytro was still in charge when the Mongols arrived at the city gates in November 1240. In Hungary King Béla declined Mikhail’s offer of his son and ejected the two from Hungary. Mikhail and Rostislav then went to see Mikhail’s uncle Conrad, ruler of Mazovia [northeast Poland around Warsaw], then to Halych to make amends with Danylo Romanovich, his brother-in-law, promising Danylo he would stop trying to oust him from his throne. He returned to Mazovia, then went to Volodymyr-in-Volhynia, then to Pinsk, and finally to a river island near Kyiv where he kept out of sight of the Mongols.\n\nMongolian gers — pack it up in 15 minutes, erect in 30.

The three were ordered to see Grand Khan Ögedei in Karakorum for reprimand and/or execution. Ögedei sent Güyük and Harqasun back west to Batu for his decision as field commander, while Büri was sent onward to his grandfather Chagatai, Ögedei’s elder brother, who would decide how to deal with him. Summer turned to fall; the Mongols waited for rivers to freeze. Kyiv, on the west bank of the Dnieper River, awaited their arrival. By November 1240, ice was beginning to form.\n\nChinese drawing of young Batu Khan (14th century).\n\nSource: Wikipedia – Batu Khan\n\nHistorical Reports of the Fall of Kyiv\n\nFragment of page from the Galician-Volynian Chronicle, from 15th-century Hypatian Codex.

Pg. 69.\n\nAccording to Rashīd al-Dīn, Büri was present at the siege of Kyiv and not off at Karakorum or with his grandfather Chagatai. When he states “…when Güyük Khan and Möngke Qa’an had, in accordance with the yarlïgh of Qa’an, returned from the Qïpchaq Steppe…”, he’s probably writing from the Karakorum viewpoint, so “returned from” means Güyük came from the west to Karakorum. Elsewhere it is stated that Güyük had not yet returned from Karakorum in time for the storming of Kyiv, but rejoined the army later and farther west; we’ll go with that. “Blackcaps” [Chorni Klobuky, Black Hats, Black Hoods] was a generic name for semi-nomadic Turkic tribes — Berendei, Torki, Kovui, Pechenegs and others — who at the end of the 11th century settled along the southern borders of Kyiv and Pereyaslavl principalities. Their main town was Torchesk [“city of the Torks”]. Their Turkic name, “Karakalpak”, referred to their traditional black headgear. They acted as border guards on behalf of the Rus’ along the Ros and Dnieper Rivers. Successors is very skimpy on useful information about the actual storming of Kyiv.\n\nFor the northern Rus’ view of this catastrophic event, the Chronicle of Novgorod says at the end of their entry for 1242 AD:\n\nThe same year Knyaz Yaroslav Vsevolodich summoned by the Tartar Tsar Baty, went to him to the Horde.\n\n— The Chronicle of Novgorod, 1016-1471; Translation by Michell, Robert & Forbes, Nevill; Camden Third Series XXV; London 1914.

The Galician-Volynian Chronicle reports on the fall of Kyiv [occasional words/phrases in the text are absent/obscured]:\n\n(1240) 6748 (1240). Batyj approached Kiev in great force; [he came] with a mighty host of soldiers and surrounded the city. It was encircled by the Tatars and a close siege began. Batyj pitched camp outside the city while his men besieged it. And one could not hear anything as a result of the great din [caused by] his screeching carts, countless bleating camels and neighing herds of horses. And the land of Rus’ became filled with soldiers. [The Rus’ians] captured a Tatar called Tovrul’ from their camp and he described the [Tatars’] vast army to the Rus’ians: [it was led by] Batyj’s brothers – the strong voyevodas Urdju, Bajdar, Birjui, Kajdan, Becak, Mengu, and Kjujuk, who [had] returned home upon learning of [the Grand] Khan’s death and although not related to him [became] a khan [because] he [had been] his chief voyevoda, and the bagatyr Sebedjaj, the bagatyr Burundaj, who conquered the Bulgar and Suzdal’ lands, and other countless voyevodas [whose names] we did not write down here. Batyj set up his catapults [for firing] against the city in a line parallel with the Ljadskije Vorota [in Kiev], for the sloping land covered with foliage had extended up to them. The catapults hurled their missiles day and night without cessation and breached [the city’s] walls. Its inhabitants climbed up on the breached walls and here one could see lance break against lance, shield scrape against shield [as the besiegers met the besieged in mortal combat. Then a barrage of] arrows eclipsed the light of the defeated [Kievans]. Dmitro was wounded. The Tatars climbed up on the ramparts and remained there that day and [through the] night. The inhabitants threw up new fortifications around the Church of the Blessed Virgin. The next day [the Tatars] attacked them and a great battle ensued. The people fled with their belongings to the top of the church to its vault, but the church walls collapsed with (6.

It also references Kjujuk’s “returning home,” but says it was “upon learning of [the Grand] Khan’s death,” adding erroneously that Kjujuk was not related to the Khan. However, Ögedei is widely held to have died 11 Dec. 1241, more than a year later. So something is in error; it’s probably this chronicle.

The interactive map at the bottom may not work in your email.\n\nThe Golden Horde Appears\n\nThe Mongols continued to rule the lands of the Rus’ and areas west, east, north, and south. In 1259 due to internecine fighting among the offspring of Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire fragmented into four khanates, eventually becoming known as: Golden Horde in Northwestern Asia/Eastern Europe, Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, Ilkhanate in Southwest Asia, and Yuan dynasty in East Asia. Batu Khan died in 1255, but his ulus, also known as the Ulus of Jochi (Batu’s father and the eldest son of Genghis Khan) continued and flourished until 1359, becoming known as Ulug Ulus (“Golden Horde). Violent political upheavals then destabilized the Golden Horde. [“Horde” comes from the Mongolian word “ordu” for camp or headquarters.]\n\nUnder Tokhtamysh the khanate briefly reunited during 1381–1395. The 1396 invasion from the southeast by Timur [Timur the Great, Tamerlane] who claimed direct descent from Genghis Khan, broke the Golden Horde into numerous small “Tatar” states, all of which dwindled in power at varying rates. By 1466, what remained of the Mongol presence was being referred to simply as the “Great Horde“, centered on Sarai on the lower Volga River. Throughout this period the Golden and Great Hordes extracted tribute from the conquered peoples, but otherwise did not meddle in the affairs of the Rus’ to the extent they did elsewhere.\n\nSouthern Rus’ never really recovered from the 1169 sacking of Kyiv by the northern Rus’ Principalities, and remained subservient to the now-permanent continuing dominance by the northern Rus’ initially centered in Vladimir-Suzdal. When the Mongols showed up again in 1237, they began their attack on the northern principalities of the Rus’ and finished with the obliteration of Kyiv. Again, southern Rus’ never really recovered. Over the following centuries, the northern Rus’ grew in power, finally ousting the Mongols from the northern lands. Mongols and “Tatars” remained in the south well into the 18th and 19th centuries, always happy to harass their northern neighbors. The Russian Empire emerged to dominate the entire area. When the Soviets seized power in 1917, the dominance of the north and subservience of the south continued.\n\nStarvation during the Holodomor, 1933, by Alexander Wienerberger (1891–1955). Source: Wikipedia – Holodomor\n\nArguably the lowest point in the twelve centuries of relationship between the north and south of Rus’-Russia-Soviet territory, was the Holodomor of 1932-1933. This largely-man-made catastrophe resulted when the Soviet Union under Stalin essentially confiscated all the grain produced by their most productive agricultural region, Ukraine, redistributed it elsewhere, and allowed many millions of Ukrainians to starve to death. Some historians think this was at least in part to suppress a suspected separatist movement in Ukraine. Since 2006, the Holodomor has been recognized by Ukraine, the European Parliament, and 22 other countries as a genocide by the Soviet regime upon the Ukrainian people, resulting in the death of 7-10 million people, or 21-31% of the 1932 Ukrainian population of 32.7 million people.\n\nThe northern Rus’, under the leadership of Vladimir-Suzdal and later the Grand Duchy of Moscow, fared far better. The Rurikid Alexander Nevsky appeared and became instrumentally important in the foundation of their future growth.\n\nAlexander Nevsky: The Greatest Russian Ever\n\nPrince Alexander Nevsky. Miniature from the Tsarskiy titulyarnik (Tsar’s Book of Titles), painted 1672, from the Collective of Kremlin Armory artists. Source: Wikipedia – Alexander Nevsky\n\nAlexander Yaroslavich Nevsky: [May 1221 – November 1263; Prince of Novgorod 1236–1240, 1241–1256, 1258–1259; Grand Prince of Kiev 1246–1263; Grand Prince of Vladimir-Suzdal 1252–1263; “Nevsky” means “of Neva,” the river where Alexander won a major battle against an invasion of the Swedes.] Alexander was the son of Yaroslav II Vsevolodovich and grandson of Vsevolod III Yuryevich “the Big Nest,” the very successful ruler of Vladimir for 36 years until 1212. In addition to fighting off German and Swedish invaders, Alexander kept the Mongols happy by ensuring payment of the required tributes and he won their support through good politics and realpolitik acceptance of their presence and power. In 1252, Alexander’s older brother Andrey II Yaroslavich refused to travel to the Golden Horde’s capital of Sarai on the Volga in order to be affirmed in his receipt of rulership of the duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal. The Mongols — never ones to tolerate bad attitudes among the conquered — booted Andrey out of Vladimir-Suzdal, exiled him to Sweden and gave the rulership of Vladimir-Suzdal to Alexander Nevsky. In 1259 Alexander led a Vladimir-Suzdal army to Novgorod and forced them to bring their payment of tribute to the Mongols up to date. This was the sort of subservient and loyal relationship the Mongols — practitioners par excellence of realpolitik themselves — greatly appreciated and rewarded.\n\nMiracle of the Icon “Virgin of the Sign” (Battle of Novgorod and Suzdal), painted 2nd half of 15th century. Source: Wikipedia – Battle Novgorod Suzdal\n\nIn 1263 Alexander raised the status of the former fishing village when he created the Grand Principality of Moscow [Grand Duchy of Moscow, Muscovy] as an appanage for his son Daniel I. Later that year, in November, while on the return to Vladimir-Suzdal from one of his frequent visits to the Mongol’s capital at Sarai, Alexander died. Almost immediately after he was buried in the Church of the Monastery of the Nativity of the Holy Mother of God in Vladimir, his veneration by the people began. In 1380, following a vision prior to the Battle of Kulikovo, his remains were exhumed and found to be incorrupt [incorruption of remains — perhaps due to unexpected mummification — occurs infrequently around the world and has never been fully explained beyond exclaiming, “It’s a miracle!”]. In 1547 he was canonized a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church, receiving three feast days. In a September 2008 newspaper poll Alexander was voted the main hero in Russian history; three months later in a television poll he was voted the greatest Russian of all time. [The greatest “Russian;” not the greatest Rus’ or greatest Rus’-Russian.]\n\nAlexander’s offspring continued to rule for centuries in Rus’, Vladimir-Suzdal, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and finally the Tsardom of Russia. Notable among them are, according to their family tree:\n\nIvan I Danilovich: Grand Prince of Moscow 1325-1340; G.P of Vladimir; grandson of Alexander\n\nIvan II Ivanovich: G.P. of Moscow 1353-1359; G.P of Vladimir; son of Ivan I\n\nDmitry Ivanovich Donetsk: G.

Moscow 1533-47; grandson of Ivan III\n\nDmitri Donskoi (1350-1389), Grand Prince of Moscow (1359-1389). Source:Wikipedia – Dmitry Donskoy\n\nIn the Battle of Kulikovo in September 1380, the combined forces of the Rus’ under the leadership of Prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow (1350-1389) won a major victory over the Mongol Golden Horde. This did not completely end Mongol rule, but is widely regarded by Russian historians as the turning point when Mongol influence began to wane and Moscow’s power began to rise. Moscow absorbed Vladimir-Suzdal in the 1320s; annexation of other neighbors continued, including the Novgorod Republic in 1478 and the Principality of Tver in 1485.\n\nIvan III Vasilyevich “the Great”1440 – 1505. Source: Wikipedia – Ivan III of Moscow\n\nIvan III Vasilyevich “the Great”: [1440 – 1505; Grand Prince of Moscow 1462-1505.] Ivan III was the first to refer to himself as “Tsar” although it was never an official title for him, and he promoted the idea of Moscow as the “Third Rome.” [“Tsar” is a contraction from the Latin “Caesar.”] He expanded Russian territory through war and seizures of land from the other Rurikid princes and dukes. He renovated the Moscow Kremlin, introduced a new legal code and laid the foundations for the centralized Russian state. Not least of his accomplishments was the ending of the rule by the Mongols and the end of paying them tribute. This was accomplished following the Great Stand on the Urga River in October 1480, when the troops of the Golden Horde and the troops of Moscow fought a four-day battle near the confluence of the Urga and Oka Rivers. Neither side could successfully cross the water while under the eyes and arrows of their foe, so they stared at each other across the river for over a month until finally both sides withdrew. As usual, historians still debate the importance or lack thereof of this battle-not-battle in ending the rule of the Golden Horde, but most traditional Russian historians view it as the end of the “Tatar yoke” in Russia.\n\nThe Final Two Mongol States Fold\n\nThe Great Stand did not end Mongol — now called “Tatar” — rule everywhere within what later became Russia. The Crimean Khanate — located on and expanding outward from the Crimea Peninsula — warred against the Golden Horde for several decades, finally achieving independence from them c.1441-1449. For centuries thereafter they harassed their Rus’ and other northern neighbors. At the same time they fell under the control of the Ottoman Turks, and beginning in 1524 Crimean khans were appointed by the Ottoman sultan. The Khanate’s main source of income was slavery; over the period 1500-1700 they captured over two million people from “the Russias” [by which I mean what is today Ukraine, Belarus and Russia], Poland and Lithuania and sold them to the Ottoman Turks and elsewhere in the Middle East. Egyptians found northern slaves to be an especially desirable commodity and were important customers of the Crimeans. In 1783 Catherine the Great of Russia sent her armies to annex Crimea, putting an end to this infuriating nuisance and population drain.\n\nThe Kazakh Khanate began as the Mongolian White Horde in 1227 and separated from the Golden Horde in 1361. Rulership and autonomy was variable until 1459 when the people comprising the “Great Migration” fled the Uzbek Khanate and created an independent state on the edge of Moghulistan, later merging with them. They eventually gained control over much of what is now Kazakhstan. By the mid-19th century the Russian Empire had taken full control of their territory. The Kazakhs were banned from electing their own leader, lost control of all taxation, and were denied any representation within the empire’s government. With the death in 1847 of Kenesary, their last Khan, they lost the final remnants of their autonomy.\n\nA Dynastic Change?\n\nMikhail Feodorovich Romanov is summoned to the Russian throne on March 14, 1613. Painting by Grigory Ugryumov (1764–1823) circa 1800. Source: Wikipedia – Michael of Russia\n\nIn 1613, after the succession crisis known as the “Time of Troubles,” Michael I Fyodorovich Romanov was elected Tsar of Russia by the Zemskiy Sobor, and ruled until 1645. During the period 1619-1633 he co-ruled with his father Feodor Nikitich Romanov (1553-1633) who had become the Patriarch Philaret of Moscow. This was the beginning of the House of Romanov which continued to rule Russia until 1917.\n\nMichael I was actually distantly related to the main Rurikid line which ran from Alexander Nevsky through male descendants and down through Ivan the Terrible. Michael I’s great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather (9 greats), Andrey II Yaroslavich (c.1222-1264), was the younger brother of Alexander Nevsky. Andrey, if you recall, had been booted out of Vladimir-Suzdal and exiled to Sweden by the Mongols. Andrey and Alexander’s father was Yaroslav II, the fourth son of Vsevolod “the big nest,” the fecund and long-serving Prince of Vladimir-Suzdal whom we’ve mentioned previously. However, not all of Michael I’s Rurikid ancestors were male. His Rurikid grandmother Eudoxia Gorbataya-Shuyskaya (c.1535-1581) married Nikita Romanovich (c.1522–1586) and gave birth to Feodor Nikitich Romanov who later became Patriarch Philaret of Moscow and Michael I’s father. This insertion of a male Romanov into an otherwise unbroken line of Rurikid male ancestors is the reason that father Feodor and son Michael I are considered the founders of a new Romanov Dynasty, rather than a continuation of the Rurikid Dynasty.\n\nWhen people say that the peoples of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine have a long, intertwined common history, it’s absolutely true. This blog series covered the 360-year period 862-1223 CE in varying detail, and for most of that period the Rus’ were one people. But their relations were exceedingly fractious and fratricidal throughout almost the entire period. “Things fell apart; the center could not hold; mere anarchy was loosed.” [W.B. Yeats paraphrase] If you’ve read this entire blog series, you know that by the mid-12th century, the northern Rus’ no longer considered the southern Rus’, centered in Kyiv, to be the same people as themselves, and when they sacked Kyiv in 1269, they treated their cousins and their cousins’ subjects far worse then ever had the Cumins or Kipchaks or any other peoples of the steppes or other surrounding nations. They treated them as strangers and invaders and put them to the sword without compunction or regret. The following 850 years of dominance by the north over the south continuated that attitude: the southerners — the Kyivans — were strangers, foreigners, to be used as laborers and chattel; whatever the northerners wished to have, they took. The northerners owned the south and owed it as little as possible. Whenever the southerners made a step towards separation, it was ruthlessly suppressed. This brings us to today; still nothing has changed.\n\nRurik, founder of the Rurikid Dynasty circa 862, ruled in Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod 862-879 CE.

That’s a very long time for a motley crew of Swedes who began their careers by rowing eastward across the Baltic Sea and up a few rivers to Staraya Ladoga, as likely as not simply to sell a few furs and have an adventure. It’s too bad that this family fell so easily into internecine feuding and warfare, power grabs and assassinations, a mode of behavior still practiced today. Brotherhood and cousinhood do not ensure peaceful and prosperous relations.\n\nInvitation of the Varangians: Rurik and his brothers arrive in Staraya Ladoga. Date: Pre-1913.

The interactive map at the bottom may not work in your email.\n\nMusical Thrones\n\nFor the next few decades, the princes of Rus’ played musical thrones with the throne of Kyiv. Beginning the sacking of Kyiv in 1169, we have the following Grand Princes:\n\n1169-1169 1st reign: Gleb Yuryevich, formerly of Pereyaslavl\n\n1170-1170 2nd reign: Mstislav II Iziaslavich.\n\n1170-1171 2nd reign: Gleb Yuryevich.\n\n1171-1171: Vladimir III Mstislavich, formerly of Triploye.\n\n1171-1171: Mikhalko I Yuryevich, formerly of Vladimir.\n\n1171-1173: Roman I Rostislavich, formerly of Smolensk.\n\n1173-1173: Vsevolod III Yuryevich “the Big Nest”, later of Vladimir 1176-1212 during its zenith.\n\n1173-1173 1st of 7 Kyivan reigns: Rurik II Rostislavich, formerly & afterwards of Ovruch.\n\n1174-1174 1st reign: Sviatoslav III Vsevolodovich, formerly of Chernigov.\n\n1174-1175 1st reign: Yaroslav II Iziaslavich, formerly of Lutsk.\n\n1175-1177 2nd reign: Roman I Rostislavich.\n\n1177-1180 2nd reign: Sviatoslav III Vsevolodovich.\n\n1180-1180 2nd reign; Yaroslav II Iziaslavich.\n\n1180-1182 2nd of 7 Kyivan reigns: Rurik II Rostislavich.\n\nComplete list of Grand Princes of Kyiv 980-1239 CE\n\nSvyatoslav III Vsevolodovych, Grand Prince of Kyiv 1174, 1177–1180, 1182–1194. Source: Google Images\n\nThat’s fourteen reigns in thirteen years. After that it settled down for a while, first with the 3rd reign of Sviatoslav III Vsevolodovich (an Olgovichi) 1182-1194, followed by the 3rd of 7 reigns of Rurik II Rostislavich 1194-1202.\n\nRyurik II Rostislavich, Grand Prince of Kyiv five to seven times: 1173, 1180–1182, 1194–1202, 1203–1205, 1206, 1207–1210. Source: Wikidata – Rurik Rostislavich\n\nThen it again went wild, with at least ten reigns 1202-1223, depending partly on how many different times — perhaps five, six, seven, perhaps more — Rurik II Rostislavich sat on the throne of Kyiv.\n\nIn 1223 the Mongols appeared for the first time, seemingly out of nowhere, and massacred an uncoordinated coalition of Rus’ forces at the Battle of the Kalka River (Rus’ XLV, Rus’ XLVI). After that thrashing, the Rus’ settled down again and had only three more Grand Princes of Kyiv over the next fourteen years before the Mongol army reappeared in 1237. Not long thereafter all Rus’ internecine confusion and disagreement about who should be or actually was in charge and where they would rule came to an end. But that story is yet to come.\n\nThe First Muscovite Prince\n\nWhat happened among the Rus’ during this period of intensive musical thrones?\n\nIn 1170 Andrei I Bogolyubsky sent a force led by his son Roman to Novgorod, in a dispute over the “Dvina duty,” tribute that Novgorod received from the Finno-Ugric countries which, beginning in 1169, was paid directly to Suzdal. After a six-month siege Novgorod sued for peace.\n\nBattle between Novgorod and Suzdal in 1170 as shown on a Novgorodian icon from the mid-15th century, the miracle of the Icon “Virgin of the Sign.” Source: Wikipedia – Battle Novgorod & Suzdal.\n\nIn 1171-1172 Andrei I transferred the Rus’ capital from now-ruined Kyiv to his favorite city of Vladimir, located halfway between Nizhny Novgorod on the confluence of the Volga and Oka rivers, and the still-little-more-than-a-fishing-village Moscow, 250 miles to the west, located on a bend in the Moskva river. He built fortifications around Vladimir, built churches and monasteries including the Assumption Cathedral and the Church of the Intercession on the Nerl. Andrei “made Vladimir the center of the grand principality,” and Vladimir-Suzdal principality became the strongest and most important of all the Rus’ principalities.\n\nIn 1173 Andrei I Yuryevich Bogolyubsky sent south a huge (for the Rus’) army of 50,000 soldiers. At Vyshgorod, ten miles upriver from Kyiv, on 10 December 1173, they met an army of southern Rus’ led by Mstislav Rostislavich “the Brave,” prince of Smolensk and Novgorod, and Yaroslav II Iziaslavich Prince of Lutsk. Andrei’s army was obliterated, much to their surprise, and Yaroslav II found himself occupying the throne of Kyiv for several years during 1174-1175.\n\nPrince Andrei I Yuryevich Bogolyubsky (c.1111-1174), sacker of Kyiv, “first prince of the future Muscovites.” Painting 1885-1896, by Viktor Vasnetsov. Source: Wikipedia – Andrey Bogolyubsky\n\nIn June 1174, a conspiratorial group of twenty Suzdal boyars and courtiers burst into his bedroom and murdered Andrei I in his bed. The expansion of his princely power and his dictatorial approach towards them in particular had grown too much for them to tolerate. Several years of citywide struggles followed until Vsevolod III Yuryevich “the Big Nest” took the throne of Vladimir in 1176 and reigned until 1212, a stunning 36 years. Although Vsevolod III took good care of his people and city of Vladimir, ensuring his continuation on their throne, like his father Yuri I and older brother Andrei I he stayed involved in family intrigues, often inciting his numerous cousins against one another.\n\nVsevolod III Yuryevich “the Big Nest:” 1154-1212; Grand Prince Kyiv 1173; Grand Prince of Vladimir 1176-1212.\n\nSource: FamilyPedia – Vsevolod III Yuryevich\n\nHistorian Vasily Klyuchevsky called Andrei I Yuryevich Bogolyubsky the first prince of the future Muscovites: “With Andrey Bogolyubsky, velikoros [the Russian, as opposed to the Rus’] had entered the historical arena.” The fact that he quickly left Kyiv and did not take the Kyivan throne after his ruinous conquest of 1169 supports the view that he was building a new state in the north, separate from Kyiv, separate from the southern Rus’. The various chronicles too support this view: they call Galician-Volyn prince Roman Mstislavich “the Great” “the autocrat of all Rus‘”, but call Andrei I the “the autocrat of the whole Suzdal land.” Thereafter, as one prince after another seized the throne of Kyiv, they argued and intrigued and traded with other princes and gradually ceded Kyivan cities and lands to one another until finally Kyiv was left almost bereft of territory outside whatever was left of its walls.\n\nThe Fourth Crusade\n\nIn 1203 while en route to Jerusalem on what came to be almost laughingly referred to as the 4th Crusade, and at the request of Byzantine prince Alexios Angeles, the Crusade leadership diverted their main force to Constantinople to restore the prince’s deposed father Isaac II Angelos to the throne. In return Isaac II promised to support the crusade’s invasion of Jerusalem. Following the siege of Constantinople, father Isaac II and son Alexios were duly crowned co-emperors. But the citizens then rose up and deposed the pair, and no one could or would raise the fee promised to the “crusaders.” After Alexios was murdered in February 1204, the Crusaders decided to take direct action, collect their fee personally, and they conquered and plundered the city for themselves. Constantinople’s vast wealth made these “crusaders” so astoundingly wealthy that very few of them felt the need to continue on to Jerusalem. For all practical purposes, this put the nail in the coffin of the eastern-western Christian schism and spelled the end of the Byzantine Empire; every city, tribe, society and state in the region was permanently affected, including the Rus’; they lost a frequent ally, a source of beautiful, intelligent and educated wives, and a centuries-old trading partner. All of Rus’ immediately lost trade and revenue as the routes to the south through the lands of the Rus’ became less traveled. East-west routes began to supplant the centuries-old north-south river routes. Harder times were coming for the Rus’.\n\nStrangers from the East\n\nIn the spring of 1223 CE, a new problem appeared out of the Polovtsian steppe. It was an army of strange-looking men, not quite Turkic or Polovtsian, on rather small horses, clad in odd armor, carrying bows and spears. They had just badly beaten an army of the Rus’ southeastern neighbors, the Cumans, who fled to the Rus’ and reported that these Mongols — despite whatever their envoys said — intended to kill them all if they were not immediately repelled by the combined forces of the Rus’ and the surviving Cumans. When a ten-member delegation of envoys from the Mongols arrived at the court of Kyiv, asking for peace and suggesting that the Rus’ not support the Cumans whom they had just soundly defeated, the Rus’ did not trust or believe them and murdered the lot. What happened in the decades that followed probably would have in the main happened anyway, but the execution of the envoys from Mongol generals Jebe and Subutai sealed the fate of the Rus’, if not immediately, then soon.\n\nIn the next and final installment of this short history of the Rus’, we’ll take an abbreviated look at what happened in Rus’ and “the Russias” following the Mongolian conquest. Following that we return to our look at the Mongolian Empire.\n\nInteractive Google MyMap. Important locations during the years 882-1223 CE.
