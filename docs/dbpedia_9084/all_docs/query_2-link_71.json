        "text": "Foreign ministers discuss special tribunal to punish Russia for atrocities in Ukraine\n\nIn a meeting moderated by human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, foreign ministers of Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Ukraine on Thursday discussed allegations of atrocities committed in the conflict in Ukraine and the possible establishment of a special international tribunal to judge the crime of aggression.\n\n“Russia has to pay,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said during the event, which was held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nHe called for the establishment of a special tribunal, echoing a call made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last night.\n\nClooney, who is advising Kyiv on finding accountability for Ukrainian victims, called for world leaders to help Ukrainians rebuild by supporting a draft UN resolution to establish a framework for a compensation commission.\n\n“Ukraine may need up to $1 trillion to repair the damage. Documenting losses should start now,” she said.\n\nA compensation fund proposed by Ukraine would draw on Russian assets abroad that had been seized and appropriated by foreign governments, according to Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Justice Iryna Mudra, who was also in attendance.\n\nSeveral other foreign ministers were in the audience and took the podium to voice support for Ukraine, including representatives from the UK, Poland, Canada and Estonia.\n\nZelensky encourages Russians to protest against Putin's \"partial mobilization\" order\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called on Russians to protest against the “partial mobilization” ordered this week by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn his daily video address to Ukraine, Zelensky said that thousands of Russian soldiers have already died in the nearly seven-month-old war.\n\nBetween 70,000 and 80,000 Russians have been killed or wounded during the war in Ukraine, according to an August estimate from the Pentagon.\n\nAddressing the ongoing anti-war protests across Russia, the Ukrainian leader said, “(Russian people) understand that they have been cheated.”\n\nThe protests in Russia are an indicator of the mood among the public in the country, he said.\n\n“For men in Russia, this is a choice to die or live, to become a cripple or to preserve health. For women in Russia, the choice is to lose their husbands, sons, grandchildren forever, or still try to protect them from death, from war, from one person,” Zelensky said.\n\nNATO condemns \"sham\" referendums in Ukraine and says alliance will never recognize them\n\nNATO on Thursday condemned plans to hold referendums in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, calling them a “sham” that the alliance will not recognize.\n\n“We condemn in the strongest possible terms the plan to hold so-called ‘referenda’ on joining the Russian Federation in the Ukrainian regions partly controlled by the Russian military,” the North Atlanta Council, NATO’s principle decision-making body, said in a statement.\n\nThe referendums were called suddenly at the beginning of this week by pro-Russian officials in occupied regions of Ukraine. They will ask the people of the occupied areas whether they wish to join the Russian Federation.\n\n“These lands are Ukraine. We call on all states to reject Russia’s blatant attempts at territorial conquest,” according to the statement.\n\nThe council also accused Russia of escalating its “illegal war” by ordering what Russian President Vladimir Putin called a “partial mobilization” of its military.\n\n“We continue to reject Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric,” it added, referring to Putin’s speech on Wednesday in which he threatened the use of nuclear weapons and warned he was “not bluffing.”\n\n“NATO Allies remain resolute in providing political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russia’s aggression,” the council said.\n\nVoting begins Friday in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine on referendums widely considered shams by West\n\nVoting begins Friday in referendums called in four regions of Ukraine that are occupied by Russian forces and their militia allies.\n\nThe votes take place over five days through Sept. 27, and in Donetsk and Kherson regions, in-person voting will only take place on the last day.\n\nObservers say it seems unlikely that such a rushed process, in areas where many voters live close to the front lines of the conflict, can be successful or fair. Additionally, because of widespread internal displacement since the beginning of the conflict, voting databases are likely out of date. In Kherson, for example, Ukrainian officials have said that about half the pre-war population have left.\n\nThe plans have been condemned by both the government of Ukraine and its allies in the West as “illegitimate” and “a sham.” The European Union has said it won’t recognize the results and has indicated it is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia.\n\nIn Donetsk, the question will only be presented in Russian. The chair of the People’s Council — an unelected body — in the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, Vladimir Bidyovka, called Russian is the “state language.”\n\nThe questions on the ballot vary slightly depending on the region.\n\nIn the Donetsk People’s Republic, the question will be: “Are you in favor of joining of the DPR to the Russian Federation on the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation?” The self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic uses the same phrasing.\n\nIn Kherson, the question will be: “Are you in favor of the secession of the Kherson region from state of Ukraine, the formation of an independent state by the Kherson region and its joining the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?” In occupied Kherson, Marina Zakharova — who chairs the election commission — said about 750,000 are expected to vote.\n\nAnd in occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia, the question is in both Russian and Ukrainian, and it reads: “Do you vote FOR the secession of Zaporizhzhia Oblast from Ukraine, the formation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast as an independent state and its accession to the Russian Federation as a sub-entity of the Russian Federation?”\n\nThe Central Election Commission of Russia said it will take part in monitoring the referendums in all four areas.\n\nIn both Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, local authorities have urged people to vote from home, saying that ballot boxes can be brought to them. A video from the Luhansk election commission says, “You can vote directly from home! From 23 to 27 September you can vote at home.”\n\nAhead of the votes, pro-Russian authorities are trying to enthuse voters. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti showed a poster being distributed in Luhansk, which read “Russia is the future.”\n\n“We are united by a 1,000-year history,” it says. “For centuries, we were part of the same great country. The break-up of the state was a huge political disaster. … It’s time to restore historical justice.”\n\nPartial mobilization is underway in Russia. Here is a snapshot of the tearful goodbyes.\n\nSocial media videos show the first phase of Russia’s partial mobilization getting underway in several Russian regions, especially in the Caucasus and the Russian Far East.\n\nTelegram videos showed one newly mobilized group of men awaiting transport, purportedly in Amginskiy Uliss in the region of Yakutiya, a vast Siberian territory — where the caption on one video read, “50 mobilized guys are going to the special operation zone.”\n\nStill in the Russian Far East, in the city of Neryungri, a community video channel posted video of families saying goodbye to a large group of men, as they board buses. The video shows a woman crying and hugging her husband goodbye, while he reaches for his daughter’s hand from the bus window.\n\nNeryungri is six time zones east of Ukraine.\n\nCNN has not been able independently to geolocate or date all the videos posted.\n\nThe republic of Buryatia has already supplied hundreds of volunteers to the conflict in Ukraine. The central Asian region may be about to send many more. According to a community Telegram channel called The People of Baikal, “they might mobilize up to 6-7 thousand people in Buryatia. The authorities do not name the exact number.”\n\n“Buses with mobilized people are arriving in Ulan-Ude [Buryatia’s capital] in the morning. The men are taken to the assembly point of the Military Commissariat…,” it said.\n\nThe channel, which has just under 5,000 subscribers, describes itself as independent. It quotes a local official as saying, “we were given a verbal order to raise the mobilized from their beds, put them in cars and immediately bring them to the military registration and enlistment office.”\n\nIt’s not possible to verify the channel’s reporting.\n\nIn Dagestan in the Caucasus, a furious argument broke out at one enlistment office, according to one video. A woman said her son had been fighting since February. Told by a man that she should not have sent him, she replied, ” Your grandfather fought so that you could live,” to which the man responded: “Back then it was war, right now it is politics.”\n\nMuch nearer the Ukrainian border, a crowd was gathered near the city of Belgorod to see off a batch of newly mobilized men. As they get on a bus, a boy shouts out, “Bye, Daddy!” and starts crying.\n\nOther moves are underway to increase the flow of troops.\n\nThe Human Rights Council of Russia has proposed that immigrants from central Asian countries who have had Russian citizenship for less than 10 years will undergo compulsory military service in Russia for a year, according to the Russian news agency TASS.\n\nRussian foreign minister dismisses Western condemnation and blames Ukraine for the war\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday dismissed Western condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, instead accusing Ukraine of being the country violating international law.\n\nSpeaking to the United Nations Security Council session on Ukraine, Lavrov claimed Ukrainian forces made “illegal” attacks on the “peaceful citizens of Donbas.”\n\nHe also accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the “Kyiv regime” of “racist” and “anti-Russian” motivated aggression.\n\nLavrov claimed Zelensky made “Russo-phobic” comments in an August interview and that they motivated people living in Russian occupied areas of Ukraine to hold referendums on the prospect of joining Russia.\n\n“I think the decisions that have been adopted by a whole range of the regions of Ukraine about conducting referendums are the result of his [Zelensky’s] comments,” Lavrov said.\n\nLavrov also condemned the “cynical” way Western nations are supplying weapons to Ukraine and said the “policy means the direct involvement of the West in the conflict and makes them a party to the conflict.”\n\nIn his speech, Lavrov claimed the West was primarily motivated to supplying weapons to Ukraine in order to “drag out the fighting as long as possible in spite of the victims and destruction in order to wear down and weaken Russia.”\n\nLavrov ended his speech by dismissing the legitimacy of the International Criminal Court, “We have no confidence in the work of his body,” he said, adding, “and we don’t expect anything more from this institution or a whole range of other international institutions.”\n\n“Everything I’ve said today simply confirms that the decision to conduct the ‘special military operation’ was inevitable,” Lavrov added.\n\nSome context on those referendums: This week, Russian-appointed leaders in the occupied regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and the self-declared Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic all said they planned to hold “votes” beginning Friday.\n\nThe expected referendums run counter to international law upholding Ukraine’s sovereignty. Ukrainian officials dismissed the announcement as a “sham” stemming from the “fear of defeat.”\n\nUS ambassador to Ukraine Bridget A. Brink echoed that sentiment on Twitter Wednesday.\n\nUS official criticizes Russian foreign minister for short stay during UN meeting about Ukraine\n\nA US official criticized Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for only being at the United Nations Security Council meeting on Ukraine for a short time and skipping the Russian criticism from Western diplomats.\n\n“Lavrov apparently couldn’t bear to hear the clear and repeated messages of condemnation of Russia’s war against Ukraine. He walked into the chamber just before his speaking slot and left shortly after,” the US official said.\n\nThe official said it was a sign of Russian weakness.\n\nCNN has reached out to Russian officials to explain why Lavrov was only in the chamber for his own remarks.\n\nChina refuses to place blame on war in Ukraine and calls for \"neutrality\" in war crimes probe\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke more vaguely than his counterparts at the United Nations Security Council Thursday, calling for “neutrality” from UN agencies and adding that any investigation into war crimes in Ukraine be “based on facts, not assumption of guilt.”\n\nHe laid out several proposals, calling for Russia and Ukraine to commit to “dialogue without preconditions,” and for all parties to prevent attacks on civilians and civilian facilities (an accusation levied by Russia, as well as by Ukraine and the West).\n\nWang Yi also said that China supports the International Atomic Energy Agency amid concerns over nuclear posturing in the conflict and over the safety of the Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\n\n“There is no room for trial and error” when it comes to nuclear issues, he said.\n\nSome context: In recent months, China has offered Russia tacit support and stepped up economic assistance to its neighbor, boosting bilateral trade to a record high.\n\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin conceded last week that Beijing had “questions and concerns” over the invasion, in what appeared to be a veiled admission of their diverging views on the military assault.\n\nBlinken says Russia \"shredded\" international order and the world \"can't let President Putin get away with it\"\n\nAt a United Nations Security Council meeting Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “the very international order we’ve gathered here to uphold is being shredded before our eyes” by Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nThe world “can’t let President (Vladimir) Putin get away with it,” Blinken told his fellow diplomats.\n\nHis remarks came amid a week of escalatory actions by Moscow, including the mobilization of tens of thousands of troops and planned “sham referenda” in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.\n\n“That President Putin picked this week, as most of the world gathers at the United Nations, to add fuel to the fire he started shows his utter contempt and disdain for the UN Charter, the UN General Assembly, and this Council,” Blinken said.\n\nBlinken said the areas of Ukraine that were occupied by Russia offered a view into that “less peaceful world,” noting, “wherever the Russian tide recedes, we’ve discovered the horror that’s left in its wake” — Bucha, Irpin, Izyum, where mass graves have been discovered, survivors have recounted acts of torture.\n\nThe top US diplomat called on Russia to cease its nuclear saber rattling, calling Putin’s threat to use “all weapon systems available” to Russia “all the more menacing given Russia’s intention to annex large swaths of Ukraine in the days ahead.”\n\nBlinken also stressed the impact the war was having globally on food security, and called out Russian disinformation on WHO-approved vaccine effectiveness.\n\nLavrov arrives to Security Council meeting about Ukraine nearly 1.5 hours after it started\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov walked into the UN Security Council meeting at approximately 11:30 a.m. ET and took his seat at the table, nearly 1.5 hours late.\n\nThe council is discussing the maintenance of peace and security in Ukraine.\n\nLong lines of traffic seen at some of Russia's land borders\n\nSocial media video from Russia’s land borders with several countries shows long lines of traffic trying to leave the country on the day after President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization.”\n\nThere were queues at border crossings into Kazakhstan, Georgia and Mongolia. One video showed dozens of vehicles lining up at the Zemo Larsi/Verkhny Lars checkpoint on the Georgia-Russia border overnight Wednesday. That line appears to have grown longer Thursday. One video showed a long queue stretching into the mountains behind the crossing, with a man commenting that it was five to six kilometers long.\n\nAnother posted Thursday showed long lines at the Khaykhta crossing into Mongolia.\n\nOne man spoke over video recorded at the Troitsk crossing into Kazakhstan, where dozens of cars were lined up Thursday morning. “This is Troitsk, queues of trucks and passenger vehicles … you can’t see the start or the end of this queue … everyone, everyone is fleeing Russia, all sorts.”\n\nA senior Kazakh official, Maulen Ashimbaev, had said Kazakhstan could not restrict the entry of Russian citizens into the country, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported earlier Thursday. But Ashimbaev, the speaker of the upper house of the Kazakh parliament, said that in order to obtain a residence permit, applicants must have a set of documents that comply with the law.\n\nIt is difficult to compare the current flow of traffic to the average in the absence of official data.\n\nFlights from Russia to countries that do not require visas continue to be very busy and frequently sold out. A search on the Aviasales website showed there were no seats available on Moscow-Istanbul one-way economy flights until Sunday — with the lowest price almost $2,900.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Thursday dismissed reports of airports crowded with people trying to leave Russia following the announcement, calling it “exaggeration” and “fake news.”\n\nIt's mid-afternoon in Kyiv. Here's what you need to know\n\nMore than 1,300 anti-war demonstrators have been arrested across Russia following President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilization Wednesday, according to OVD-Info, an independent protest monitoring group. Some detainees have been directly conscripted into the Russian military, OVD-Info spokeswoman Maria Kuznetsova told CNN.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK government has confirmed the release of five British nationals who were freed alongside two US veterans, as more details of the Ukraine-Russia prisoner swap emerge.\n\nHere are the latest headlines:\n\nPrisoner swap: The UK government confirmed that five British nationals have been released as part of the prisoner swap between the Ukraine and Russia. Brokered by Saudi Arabia, the deal also saw nationals from the United States, Morocco, Sweden and Croatia leave detention by Russian-backed forces.\n\nMore than half of anti-war demonstrators are women: Over 1,300 anti-war protesters were detained in Russia Wednesday, according to the independent monitoring group OVD-Info. The watchdog said 51% of the publicly named detainees were women, with nine journalists and 33 minors also among those held.\n\nPartial mobilization still a ‘special military operation,’ Kremlin insists: The protests followed President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilization, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisting Russia’s actions in Ukraine remain a “special military operation” as opposed to a “war.”\n\nKremlin denies reports of people crowding airports to leave Russia: Flight sales websites and Google trends have indicated a spike in people seeking to fly out of Russia following the partial mobilization announcement. On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called reports of citizens crowding airports to leave the country an “exaggeration” and “fake news.”\n\nInternational officials voice fears over Ukrainian nuclear facilities: Foreign ministers and senior officials from Europe, North America and South Korea expressed “grave concern” regarding threats to the safety of Ukrainian nuclear facilities. In a joint statement, the officials criticized Russia for their seizure of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, as well as their “sham referenda.”\n\n\"I am the happiest woman in the world,\" says wife of Azovstal fighter who was freed in prisoner swap\n\nWives of some of the scores of Ukrainian fighters released by Russia in a prisoner swap have described to CNN the disbelief and joy of hearing their loved ones had been released.\n\nAlina Volovyk, speaking with CNN via WhatsApp, described getting a phone call from a man she did not recognize at first as her husband, Artem Volovyk, a Ukrainian Marine who fought at the Azovstal Steel Plant earlier this year, before all of Mariupol was captured by Russian forces.\n\nRussia on Wednesday released 215 people from its custody, including some foreign nationals who had been fighting for Ukraine. In exchange, Ukraine released 55 people, as well as Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician and oligarch, whose daughter is goddaughter to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAmong the 215 people released by Russia were “188 heroes of Azovstal and Mariupol,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said overnight.\n\nThe release of the Azovstal and Mariupol fighters is a major coup for Ukrainian morale, given the huge role the defense of Mariupol played in the Ukrainian psyche early in the war.\n\nThis is the largest single release of fighters from Mariupol. In a June prisoner swap, Russia released 144 soldiers, among whom 95 had defended the Azovstal plant.\n\nRuslana Volynska, whose husband Serhii “Volyna” Volynskyi, was acting commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, told CNN via text message that she found out about the swap on the Internet.\n\n“Later Serhii called himself, and I heard him. It was boundless joy, shock, happiness! All emotions were mixed! I cried with happiness, and could not believe that this day had come,” she said.\n\nAn advisor to Mariupol’s Ukrainian mayor, Petro Andriushchenko, who was forced to leave his city as Russia advanced, said on Telegram that Mariupol “rejoices the return of its Heroes to Ukrainian soil. Even in the occupation!”\n\n“Only two hours ago, when I was doing some shopping, I realized that my husband was at home and started to cry. The only thing I want now is to hug him as soon as possible,” she added.\n\nPutin's partial mobilization only strengthens support for Ukraine in Berlin, German defense minister says\n\nRussia’s “partial mobilization” and planned referendums in occupied parts of Ukraine will not deter Germany’s military support for Ukraine, the country’s Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced Thursday.\n\n“Rather, this reaction from Putin to Ukraine’s successes spurs us on to continue to support Ukraine and send this clear signal,” Lambrecht told reporters in Berlin following a meeting with her French counterpart.\n\n“We see that Ukraine has achieved great successes,” she said, highlighting the support it received from Germany and France.\n\nLambrecht also said the announced referendums by Kremlin-backed officials in Ukraine ”will have no impact on us,” noting they will not change the level of support Ukraine will receive from Germany.\n\nFrench Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said France will also continue its support for Ukraine in terms of arms and training, adding that France needed cooperation within NATO to do so.\n\nFive British nationals released as part of Ukraine prisoner swap, UK government confirms\n\nFive British nationals have been released as part of a prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia, the UK government confirmed on Thursday.\n\nAiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner, John Harding, Dylan Healy and Andrew Hill have all been released, according to the government.\n\nTwo American veterans and three further nationals from Morocco, Sweden, and Croatia have also been released as part of a deal brokered by Saudi Arabia.\n\nAll five citizens are “back safely in the UK”, non-profit organization the Presidium Network – which has been supporting Healy’s family – told the BBC Thursday.\n\nThe Presidium Network’s co-founder Dominik Byrne added that the released Brits – captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces – were “looking forward to normality with their families after this horrific ordeal.”\n\nThe UK government has not yet confirmed the process that brokered the group’s release, the report from the BBC added.\n\nThe confirmation follows British Prime Minister Liz Truss announcement of the group’s release on Wednesday.\n\n“Hugely welcome news that five British nationals held by Russian-backed proxies in eastern Ukraine are being safely returned, ending months of uncertainty and suffering for them and their families,” she said in a tweet.\n\nTruss thanked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for “for his efforts to secure the release of detainees” and Saudi Arabia for its “assistance.”\n\nRead more here:\n\nKremlin insists Russia's actions in Ukraine are still \"special military operation\"\n\nRussia continues to call its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” following the announcement of partial mobilization, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.\n\nWhen asked by CNN during a daily call with journalists whether the actions carried out by Russia in Ukraine should be referred to as a “special military operation” or a “war” in view of the partial mobilization announced by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Peskov said, “No, this is a special military operation.”\n\nWhen asked whether, in this sense, the status of hostilities has changed, Peskov said, “No, it hasn’t.”\n\nZaporizhzhia shelled early Thursday, city official says\n\nThe Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia was shelled early Thursday, a city council official has reported.\n\nZaporizhzhia City Council Secretary Anatoliy Kurtiev said on his Telegram Channel that “civil infrastructure has been destroyed” and that “there are casualties.”\n\nThere have been claims of five explosions from both pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian media, but CNN cannot independently verify the claims.\n\nThe shelling comes on the heels of a turbulent 24 hours for the region, after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would back a referendum for Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia to join the Russian Federation.\n\nAnalysis: Biden's new mission is heading off any possibility of a nuclear crisis with Russia\n\nUS President Joe Biden’s historic mission is now clear — shepherding the world through the most alarming nuclear brinkmanship since the darkest days of the Cold War.\n\nAll of Biden’s other challenges – from high inflation, Covid-19, climate change and the building showdown with China – pale against the peril posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fresh escalation of the war in Ukraine.\n\nPutin’s implied threat that he could use nuclear weapons, delivered in a speech on Wednesday – and his warning that he was not bluffing – made Biden’s own speech at the UN General Assembly seem all the more grave.\n\n“That should make your blood run cold,” he added.\n\nPutin’s announcement of a partial national mobilization is being seen outside Russia as an admission of failure for his Ukraine operation so far, and of rising domestic political pressure. But forthcoming referendums in captured Ukrainian territory on joining Russia, that are described by the West as a sham, take the war to a tense new stage.\n\nIf these areas do join Russia, Ukrainian attacks on them using Western arms could in theory be interpreted as an assault on the Russian motherland itself.\n\nThis potentially makes Putin’s threat to use nuclear arms to defend Russian territory a significant escalation.\n\nThe Russian leader is clearly seeking to scare Western publics and to make Washington and allied capitals think again about their support for Ukraine, which has helped turn his invasion into such a disaster.\n\nPutin could well be bluffing about the possible use of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. But then again, maybe he’s not.\n\n\"We exchanged one fan of Russia for 200 warriors,\" Ukrainian President Zelensky says\n\nPro-Kremlin Ukrainian opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk, who was captured back in April, is being exchanged with Russia as part of a prisoner swap, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky said 200 Ukrainian prisoners had returned home in exchange for Medvedchuk.\n\nVasyl Maliuk, the acting head of the Ukrainian security service, said Medvedchuk “is not just a godfather to Putin’s child, but also a documented by us as a traitor.”\n\n“Moreover, while working on the Medvedchuk case, we have neutralized multiple agent networks, detained multiple traitors, and received a lot of valuable information that we are using for counterintelligence and will bring us closer to our victory,” Maliuk added.\n\nFive Ukrainian commanders were included in the prisoner swap, as were 55 prisoners to be sent to Russia, according to Zelensky.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the 55 prisoners are all Russians or pro-Russians, but Zelensky described them as people “who fought against Ukraine, and those who betrayed Ukraine.”\n\nAccording to Andrii Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, a total of 215 prisoners of war have been released as part of an exchange of POWs between Russia and Ukraine, including ten foreign prisoners.\n\nYermak also said 10 foreigners were among those swapped.\n\n“Based on the requests of our international partners, we have also returned 10 foreign defenders of Ukraine. These are the representatives of those countries, who assist us the most – the United States, Great Britain, Croatia, Sweden and Morocco,” Yermak said.\n\nThe head of the State Property Fund, Rustem Umerov, said, “They are safe and liberated from captivity. We are currently in the Saudi Arabia capital – Riyadh. The further safe transfer is planned from here to their countries with our partners.” Yermak added.\n\nThe Coordinating Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (CHTPW), a government institution under the Defense Intelligence, said five British and two Americans are among the ten foreign prisoners.\n\nIn speech to the UN, Zelensky calls for special tribunal to punish Russia\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday called for a special tribunal to be created to punish Russia for invading Ukraine during his pre-recorded speech to the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“This will become a signal to all would be aggressors, that they must value peace or be brought to responsibility by the world,” Zelensky said in his speech.\n\nZelensky calls for Russia to be stripped of UN veto power\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday addressed the United Nations, urging world leaders to unite against Russia’s war in Ukraine and strip Moscow of its veto power on the UN Security Council, among other actions.\n\n“A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand punishment,” Zelensky said, wearing his now-customary fatigues in a prerecorded message that was met with a standing ovation from scattered delegates in the hall in New York.\n\nRussia’s invasion of a fellow member state had upturned the world order, he said, echoing assessments made by several world leaders on the same stage earlier that day, including US President Joe Biden.\n\nIn his speech to the UN General Assembly, Zelensky said:\n\n“So long as the aggressor is party to decision making in the international organization, you must be insulated from them, at least until aggression stops.\n\nSome context: Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is one of five countries that have the right to veto.\n\nRead more\n\nSome detainees rounded up in Russia protests are being conscripted directly into military: monitoring group\n\nSome of the protesters being arrested following nationwide protests against the Ukraine war and Putin’s announcement Wednesday of a partial mobilization are being drafted directly into Russia’s military, according to the independent monitoring group OVD-Info.\n\nProtesters detained by Russian riot police on Wednesday, and who were being held in at least four police stations, were being conscripted directly, said spokeswoman Maria Kuznetsova of OVD-Info, an independent monitoring group, in a phone call with CNN.\n\nOne of the detainees has been threatened with prosecution for refusing to be drafted, she said.\n\nThe government has said that punishment for refusing the draft is now 15 years in jail.\n\nMore than 1,000 people detained for anti-war protests: monitoring group\n\nAt least 1,045 people have been detained across Russia in a crackdown on anti-war protests across two dozen cities in Russia, according to the independent monitoring group OVD-Info on Wednesday.\n\nArrests took place in Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Novosibirsk, Ulan-Ude, Tomsk, Ufa, Perm, Belgorod and Moscow, according to the OVD-info tally.\n\nMoscow prosecutor’s office published a statement on Wednesday warning citizens against participation in protests, threatening them with up to 15 years in jail.\n\nAlmost one hundred people were detained in St Petersburg on Wednesday after President Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilization to increase the availability of troops for the war in Ukraine.\n\nPhotos released on OVD-Info’s Telegram channel showed police in Saint Petersburg using batons against protestors. Videos show police attempting to contain behind barriers a crowd gathering at Isakiivskiy Cathedral, amid chants of “no mobilization.”\n\nVideos from Moscow show several protesters being carried away by the police at a demonstration in the center of the city.\n\nOne video posted by a journalist from the Moscow internet publication The Village shows dozens of people in Arbatskaya street chanting “Let him go” as one man is carried away.\n\nThere was also video from the city of Yekaterinburg of a struggle between police officers and protesters.\n\nAs of 8 p.m. Moscow time, 535 people had been detained in 30 cities across Russia, according to OVD-Info.\n\nMost protests appear to have attracted a few dozen people.\n\nTim Lister, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Anastasia Graham-Yooll contributed reporting."
