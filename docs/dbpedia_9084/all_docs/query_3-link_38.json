The Ukrainian territory was attached to the Soviet Union until 1991, when it became an independent state.\n\nIn 2014, after a few months of internal crisis after the then president Yanukovych rejected the agreement of association with the European Union, Russia took the opportunity to occupy and annex the strategically important Crimean peninsula, opening a conflict that has never been closed.\n\nCulture and interests\n\nUkrainian culture is very rich and diverse. Ukrainian traditions are hundreds of years old and most of them stem from Orthodox Christianity, which is the dominant religion in the country.\n\nOne of the most typical Ukrainian customs is Easter eggs, known as pÃ½sankys, which at this time of year are covered with wax and then painted with bright colours. This tradition goes back thousands of years.\n\nThe sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine. Brought from North America, it is known as sunyashniki, and for the Slavic peoples it represented the power of the Sun. These days it is becoming a symbol of the Ukrainian people's resistance."
