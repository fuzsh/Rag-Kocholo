Russian Federation). My\n\ntask is to assess, whether Second Expert Report of Professor Paul Robert Magocsi\n\nadequate and scientifically sound describes the way of Ukraine and Ukrainians to their\n\nindependent national-state existence.\n\nAnnex 21\n\nPage 5 out of 19\n\nII. SUMMARY\n\n4. As a result of the analysis of the available materials provided by Ukraine in support of its\n\nallegations as well as of publicly available sources I have come to the following\n\nconclusions.\n\n5. General conclusions:\n\n(a) The Second Expert Report of Professor P.R. Magocsi aims to form an idea\n\nof the struggle of Ukraine and Ukrainians for their independent nationalstate\n\nexistence as a deterministic and noncontradictory process without\n\nalternatives. However, the external consistency of the author's constructions\n\ncomes at the expense of significant simplifications and sometimes\n\ndistortions, which in the end give a wrong picture.\n\n(b) The Ukrainian lands were under different sovereignties, and the people who\n\nlived there participated in different state projects and were bearers of\n\ndifferent loyalties and identities. For a considerable part of historical time,\n\nthe Russian and Ukrainian peoples were in unity, which led to their mutual\n\ncultural enrichment and development. Up until the nineteenth century,\n\ndebates about identity options and different interpretations of the\n\nproximity/differences between the Great Russians and the Little Russians\n\nwere debates that took place within a narrow elite educated stratum. In the\n\nsecond half of the 19th century, we observe the first, extremely limited in\n\ntheir numbers Ukrainian nationalist associations - the Kirill and Mefodiy\n\nSociety of the 1840s and the Kiev Hromada of the 1860s. However, neither\n\nthey, nor the associations that followed, both in the Russian Empire and in\n\nAustria-Hungary, built their plans according to a single design. Some of\n\nthem promoted the idea of the particular Ukrainian statehood but some\n\nsupported federalist, democratic or socialist values, not looking for the\n\nbreakup with the Russian people. Anti-Russian sentiments manifested\n\nthemselves, largely fuelled from outside, during the two World Wars and\n\nthe civil wars, but were not deterministic until the beginning of the twentyfirst\n\ncentury.\n\nAnnex 21\n\nPage 6 out of 19\n\n(c) In the current context, it is crucial not to use the historical past as a tool to\n\ndeepen the confrontation. Unfortunately, attempts to simplify and distort the\n\nnarratives of Ukraine, to reduce them to the Galician-Diasporan myth (with\n\nthe important caveat that ‘Russophile sentiment’ was not something\n\nmarginal in the eastern regions of Austria-Hungary until the early 20th\n\ncentury, which is what P. R. Magocsi does, have not only academic, but also\n\npolitical consequences. It has formed the basis of educational policy which\n\nlargely consisted of the closing of Russian schools and narrowing of the\n\nsphere of the Russian language use. Attempts to homogenise the Ukrainian\n\nidentity on the basis of this narrative resulted in the loss of Crimea and the\n\nsouth-eastern regions of the country.\n\n6. I describe my findings in more detail below.\n\nAnnex 21\n\nPage 7 out of 19\n\nIII. NONCONTRADICTORY HISTORICAL NARRATIVE AND ITS COSTS\n\n7. In the introductory part of his report, P.R. Magocsi clearly formulates his super-objective\n\nas a study of the historical experience of Ukrainian nation-state-building. From his point\n\nof view, the Declaration of Independence adopted by the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament)\n\nof Ukraine on August 24, 1991, did not open anything fundamentally new in the history\n\nof that country. According to Magocsi, “in fact, during the twentieth century alone,\n\nindependence was proclaimed for all or part of Ukrainian territory no less than five times\n\nbefore 1991. Nor was the idea of statehood in Ukraine limited to the twentieth century.\n\nThree centuries earlier Ukrainians created a state which existed in some form from the\n\nmid-seventeenth to late eighteenth centuries”.\n\n8. Thus, the author offers a coherent and noncontradictory historical narrative, according to\n\nwhich the struggle for an independent state has been consistently waged by the bearers of\n\na separate Ukrainian identity for at least three and a half centuries. A kind of continuity\n\nline is constructed from the Zaporozhian Army led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky and the\n\nHetmanate (among its leaders Magocsi gives special prominence to Ivan Mazepa) to the\n\npost-Soviet Ukrainian state project.\n\n9. However, the other side of that noncontradictory historiographical construct tends to\n\noversimplify the historical past of Ukraine. The author ignores a number of fundamental\n\nfeatures of Ukrainian history.\n\n10. First, the very concepts of Ukraine, Ukrainian, as well as the geographical scope of their\n\napplication have evolved over the centuries.1 They also coexisted with other selfidentifications\n\n– Maloross (Little Russian), Russian, Rusyn and Cossack. Until the middle\n\nof the 16th century, in the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the\n\nlocal population of the former Rus (present-day Ukraine) was referred to as ‘Rusyns’.\n\nThen new forms appeared Latin Ruthenia/Ruthenians and Roxolania/Roxolanus, as well\n\nas Hellenized ‘Russia’ (Rosia) and ’Russian people‘. From the fourteenth century the\n\nterm ’Malorossia’ (Little Russia) appears, first to denote the Polish part of the Kiev\n\nmetropolis, and after 1648 the territory of the Cossack Hetmanate. In the Moscow State,\n\nthe inhabitants of the Orthodox lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth were\n\n1 F. Gaida, BORDERS AND BOUNDARIES: NOTIONS OF “UKRAINE” AND “UKRAINIANS” IN THEIR HISTORICAL\n\nDEVELOPMENT. (Moscow: Modest Kohlerov. 2019).\n\nAnnex 21\n\nPage 8 out of 19\n\ncalled ’Lithuanians‘ or ’Cherkasses‘, and only later ’Little Russians‘ or ’Cossacks‘. The\n\nterm ’Ukrainians‘, ’Ukrainian people‘ was originally used not as an ethnonym, but as a\n\ncharacteristic of near-the-border (‘u krainy’) population.\n\n11. Politicians and intellectuals of different eras and different countries put different\n\nmeanings into the concept of ‘Ukrainian’ (local, ethnic, national, civil). While for a Soviet\n\ncitizen the regions of Donbas were parts of the Ukrainian SSR, for a resident of the\n\nRussian Empire or the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth of the first half of the 18th\n\ncentury they were perceived as ‘Wild Fields’, disputed and undeveloped areas with no\n\nclear connection to a particular state.2\n\n12. Secondly, all attempts to create a special statehood in the period from the XVII to the XX\n\ncenturies in the territory of post-Soviet Ukraine were realized in different geographical\n\nconfigurations. The same Zaporizhian Host or Hetmanate did not have in its composition\n\nnot only Crimea and Donbas, the regions about which Professor Magocsi writes as\n\nunconditionally Ukrainian, but also the territories on the right bank of the Dnieper. By\n\nthe way, the famous project of Ivan Mazepa's closest associate Philip (Pylyp) Orlyk\n\n(1710), which in post-Soviet Ukrainian historiography is defined as the ‘first\n\nConstitution’ of Ukraine, was called ‘The Treaties and Resolutions of the Rights and\n\nFreedoms of the Zaporozhian Army’.3\n\n13. However, even in the twentieth century we can speak rather of Ukrainian projects than of\n\na single Ukrainian project. A striking example is the (co)existence of the Ukrainian and\n\nWest Ukrainian republics, which, despite their proclaimed unification into a ‘single\n\nsovereign’ state, in practice never managed to fully integrate.4\n\n14. Thirdly, P.R. Magocsi underestimates the obvious collision between the current nationalterritorial\n\nambitions of Kiev (which he consistently defends) and the historical process of\n\n2 Danilevsky I.N., Tairova-Yakovleva T.G., Shubin A.V., Mironenko V.I.

The state is\n\ndefined in the document as ‘Little Russia, our Fatherland’ (Article 2), ‘Ukraine’ (Article 14), and the inhabitants\n\nare referred to as ‘the people of Little Russia’, ‘the sons of Little Russia’.\n\n4 Borysenok E.Y.

On the one hand, he agrees that the current ‘territorial\n\nintegrity’ of Ukraine (within the 1991 borders) has been shaped by other political forces\n\nrather than fighters for a national Ukrainian idea. He emphasizes that after the victory of\n\nthe USSR in World War II ‘for the first time in history, the vast majority of ethnic\n\nUkrainian-inhabited lands (as defined by Ukrainian scholars) were within the borders of\n\na single Ukrainian, albeit Soviet, state. Moreover, these were the lands (especially historic\n\nGalicia) where the Ukrainian national movement had its earliest beginnings and where\n\nethnic national identity was still at its strongest and most widespread’.\n\n15. Indeed, it was the Soviets who incorporated Galicia, Volhynia, Transcarpathia, Northern\n\nBukovina and Southern Bessarabia into the Ukrainian SSR. But the process did not end\n\nin 1945; in 1954 it was followed by Crimea. It is also worth adding to this picture that in\n\nthe pre-revolutionary period it was not the Ukrainian movement but the Russian imperial\n\nauthorities who had formed the territorial predicates of the future independent Ukraine,\n\nincluding the Northern Black Sea coast (1760-1770s), the territory of the former Crimean\n\nKhanate (1783), the southern lands between the Dnieper and Bug rivers (1791) and the\n\nlands of Right-bank Ukraine as a result of the partitions of the Commonwealth of Poland\n\nand Lithuania.\n\n16. Thus, both the Ukrainian SSR and present-day Ukraine have a multi-ethnic population\n\nwith different ideas about identity, statehood and different ideals for the past and the\n\nfuture.\n\n17. Fourth, P.R. Magocsi's historiographical constructs almost completely ignore the loyalist\n\nsentiments among the ancestors of modern Ukrainians. Meanwhile, existing within the\n\nframework of various state projects (Rzeczpospolita, the Moscow state and the Russian\n\nEmpire, the Austrian Empire/Austro-Hungary, the interwar Poland, Czechoslovakia,\n\nRomania, the Soviet Union-UkrSSR), they were involved in the socio-political and socioeconomic\n\nprocesses in these countries, promoted their interests and ensured their security.\n\nThere is no reason to consider Ukrainians (Little Russians, Ruthenians) as immanent\n\nseparatists, aiming only at the implementation of their national project. The Polish-\n\nLithuanian Commonwealth was supported by the ‘Russian families’ of the Ostrozhskis\n\nand Vishnevetskis, while the Russian imperial military and diplomatic elite was\n\nreinforced by such figures as Alexander Bezborodko, Ivan Paskevich and Viktor\n\nKochubey. In the USSR of Leonid Brezhnev's time, the so-called ‘Dnepropetrovsk clan’\n\nAnnex 21\n\nPage 10 out of 19\n\nwas the basis of power, and even the Secretary General defined himself in the 1926 census\n\nas ‘Ukrainian’.5\n\n18. Fifth, Magocsi's work is based on the conclusions of almost exclusively English-speaking\n\nhistoriography (American-Canadian researchers of Ukrainian origin). The arguments\n\n(with which the author could have disagreed) of Soviet Marxist historians, representatives\n\nof the ‘Russians abroad’, pre-revolutionary Russian researchers and contemporary\n\nspecialists from Russia and Ukraine have been left without any attention.6\n\n5 LITTLE RUSSIANS VS UKRAINIANS: THE UKRAINIAN QUESTION IN THE SCIENCE, STATE AND CULTURAL POLICY\n\nOF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE AND THE USSR.

UKRAINIAN PROJECTS: PROBLEMS OF REPRESENTATIVENESS\n\n19. One of the ideologues of contemporary Ukrainian nationalism and well-known historian\n\nMikhail/Mykhailo Hrushevsky presented his programmatic socio-political pamphlet in\n\nthe form of the question ‘Who are the Ukrainians and what do they want?’7 In answering\n\nit, perhaps the key issue is the question of representativeness. Who can we consider to be\n\nthe spokesman for the will of Ukraine and its people? Magocsi mentions Bohdan\n\nKhmelnitsky as one of the founding fathers of Ukrainian statehood, and makes the\n\nCossacks look almost identical to the Ukrainians. However, the ‘free Cossacks’ opposed\n\nnot only nobles and magnates of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but also\n\nRegistered Cossacks (the same Little Russians, like the famous hetman, who received\n\nfunding for their service from the Polish-Lithuanian state). That project was not supported\n\nby the elite Little Russian groups either, which were defined in the sources as ‘Ruthenian\n\nby origin, Polish by nationality’. And it is no coincidence that the period of 1650-1680s\n\nin the history of Ukraine was called ‘Ruina’ (the Ruin).8 At the same time such a notion\n\nas ‘multi-Hetmanship’ came into use. It was an order when some hetmans were oriented\n\nto Moscow, some to Warsaw, some to Bakhchisarai and Istanbul while some even to\n\nSweden that did not share the common border with the Little Russian lands but actively\n\nintervened the Eastern European politics. It is by no means an idle question which of them\n\ncan be considered the bearers of the ‘true’ idea of Ukrainian statehood. Not to mention\n\nthe considerable social distance between the Cossack nobility (who dreamed of rights and\n\nprivileges similar to those of the Polish-Lithuanian nobility) and the peasants of Little\n\nRussia. Thus, we can not speak of any single image of a ‘free Ukraine’; on the contrary,\n\nwe can speak of a competition among a variety of projects (the pro-Polish choice of Ivan\n\nVygovsky, pro-Ottoman of Pyotr/Petro Doroshenko, and pro-Russian of Ivan\n\nBriukhovetsky, who was the first Moscow boyar - a Cossack of Zaporozhye). It should\n\nbe noted that all the aforementioned hetmans and some other Cossack leaders changed\n\ntheir ‘geopolitical vector’ more than once.9\n\n7 Hrushevsky M.S.

Magocsi, describing the Little Russian Hetmanate as ‘a largely self-governing entity\n\nin central Ukraine for well over a century until it was abolished in the 1780s by the\n\nRussian imperial authorities under Catherine II’, gives special prominence to the figure\n\nof Ivan Mazepa. However, the number of his supporters, who arrived with him in the\n\nvicinity of Poltava to the Swedish King Karl XII’s positions, is estimated by the sources\n\nas 3-4 thousand people, while about 16 thousand ‘loyal Cossacks’, headed by hetman\n\nIvan Skoropadsky, gathered under the banners of Peter I. Why then should not\n\nSkoropadsky (as well as other figures of Hetmanate, such as Daniel Apostol), but Mazepa\n\nin this case be considered the spokesman of the Ukrainian people?10\n\n21. In his report, Magocsi draws a comparison between the policies of St Petersburg and\n\nVienna on the ‘Ukrainian track’ in favour of the latter. According to him (referring to his\n\nown work!), ‘the rulers of Habsburg Austria tolerated and even encouraged the national\n\nmovement among Ukrainians (officially called Ruthenians at the time) based in the\n\n”western” city of Lviv, while the tsarist Russian authorities aggressively attempted to\n\nsuppress the Ukrainian national movement among Ukrainians (officially called Little\n\nRussians) based in the ”eastern” city of Kyiv.’ However, one should not forget the\n\nexistence of a powerful ‘Moscowphile’ (‘Russophile’) social movement in Austria-\n\nHungary. The situation was interesting and at times paradoxical, when the Little Russians,\n\nsubjects of the Russian Empire, were striving for cooperation with the Austrians, while\n\nthe Ruthenians, subjects of Emperor Franz Joseph, were dreaming of unity with Russia.\n\nConsequently, there was no Galician monopoly on the Ukrainian project, nor was there\n\nany anti-Russian predetermination.\n\n22. The pro-Russian Ruthenian movement in Austria-Hungary, on the other hand, was\n\ngradually suppressed by Vienna from the moment the anti-Russian alliance with Germany\n\nwas concluded. With the beginning of the First World War it created two concentration\n\ncamps for these people in Tallerhof and Terezin, where 30,000 people were held. They\n\nwere, incidentally, the first such camps in Europe. By the way, in 1914-1918 the\n\nUkrainians found themselves on both sides of the ‘barricades’ and were forced to fight\n\n10 Pavlenko N.I. PETER THE GREAT. Moscow, Mysl. 1990. - 670 p.\n\nAnnex 21\n\nPage 13 out of 19\n\nagainst each other. Three and a half million Ukrainians (Little Russians) were in the\n\nRussian army, 250 thousand served in the Austrian army.11\n\n23. The desire to ensure the noncontradictory character of the expert narrative also leads the\n\nauthor away from considering the competition of various national projects in Ukraine\n\nthroughout its history. P.R. Magocsi is trying to brush aside the article by Russian\n\nPresident V.V. Putin ‘On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians’.12 According\n\nto him, it is ‘denying the historical right of the Ukrainian people to a state of their own,\n\nand even denying that the Ukrainian people are ethnically distinct from their Russian\n\nneighbours.’ However, such an approach is not scientific and the conclusion of the author\n\nis incorrect. The question of the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians was the\n\nsubject of study as early as in the 70s of the XVII century, soon after the left bank of the\n\nDnieper became part of the Kingdom of Moscow after the revolt of Bohdan Khmelnitsky\n\nand the war with the Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania. It was reflected in the\n\nSynopsis ‘about a single Slavic-Russian people, part of which were both Little Russians\n\nand Great Russians’, compiled in Pechersk Lavra in Kiev.13 At that time, the terms ‘Little\n\nRussia’ and ‘Great Russia’, as well as the terms ‘Little Poland’ and ‘Great Poland’,\n\ndenoted a ‘small’ - in the sense of ‘original’ - and a ‘great’ - in the sense of ‘extended’ -\n\npart.\n\n24. The idea of an all-Russian nation resonated with a significant number of Little Russians.\n\nThe struggle for identity in the region was between Russian-oriented Little Russians and\n\nUkrainians, who shared the idea of a separate Ukrainian nation. For instance, the Union\n\nof the Russian People, even in Volhynia, had far more than 100,000 members at the\n\nbeginning of the 20th century before World War I. Large Russian organizations that\n\nunited upper classes flourished in Kiev and Odessa. The monument to Pyotr Stolypin in\n\nKiev, unveiled in 1913 in front of the opera house where he was assassinated in 1911,\n\nbears the words of the Prime Minister engraved on it: ‘I firmly believe that the light of\n\n11 Miller A.I.

Moreover, a number of prominent historical figures of science and culture born in Ukraine\n\nheld views about the unity of Russians and Ukrainians (Little Russians). Nikolai Gogol,\n\nin particular, pointed out: ‘Russian and Little Russian are twin souls, complementing each\n\nother, related and equally strong. It is impossible to give preference to one over the\n\nother’.15\n\n26. Ukrainian historian and public figure Mikhail Dragomanov (by the way, a harsh critic of\n\nnational policy of the Russian Empire) wrote: ‘...The real Ukrainian policy in Russia must\n\nexclude any thought of state separatism and, therefore, have as its goal only political\n\nreform of the entire state on the basis of regional and communal autonomy’.16 Reviewing\n\nDragomanov's work, the Galician-born prominent writer Ivan Franko developed these\n\ntheses: ‘No intelligent man with even a shred of political common sense, much less\n\nDragomanov, could even in the most exuberant imagination paint himself the possibility\n\nof separating or fencing off the Ukrainian land from Russia. Whoever knows at least a\n\nlittle bit about the ethnographic borders between the Ukrainian, Great Russian and other\n\nadjacent peoples can only wonder at the naivety of a publicist who presents such a fantasy\n\nas a postulate of an intelligent politician’.17\n\n27. The world-renowned philosopher Grigory/Hryhorii Skovoroda was a proponent of the\n\nLittle Russian identity and a single Russian nation of three branches. Several research\n\ninstitutes in Ukraine still bear his name and his image is on the 500 hryvnia banknote.\n\n28.

Thus, over several centuries, Ukrainians (Little Russians, Cossacks) have had a wide\n\nspectrum of views as to their identity. Some defended the version of Ukrainian\n\nindependence; a significant part of the population rejected it, supporting the idea of a\n\ntriune Russian nation under the aegis of an Orthodox monarch. Some saw Ukraine as an\n\nOrthodox entity, while others fought for a ‘Church Union’ (going back to the transfer the\n\necclesiastical jurisdiction in the Ruthenian lands of the Polish–Lithuanian\n\nCommonwealth from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to the jurisdiction\n\nof the Holy See of 1596).\n\n30. Ukrainians were subjects of different states and were prepared to defend them, not just\n\ntheir own particular ethno-national interests. In this respect, one of the main flaws of P.R.\n\nMagocsi's report is the neglect of Ukrainian multi-component nature, identity/loyaltybased\n\nmulti-culturalism.\n\n18 Tolochko P.P.

The author pays particular attention in his report to the twentieth century, a time when\n\nempires were being replaced by nation-states. He focuses on the Ukrainian People's\n\nRepublic. However, between 1917 and 1920, a dozen or so different republics emerged\n\non the territory of the future Ukrainian SSR. In addition to several Ukrainian People's\n\nRepublics, the establishment of the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Republic, the Odessa Soviet\n\nRepublic, the Socialist Soviet Republic of Taurida, the Crimean Regional Government,\n\nthe West Ukrainian People's Republic, the Galician Socialist Soviet Republic and the\n\nCrimean Soviet Socialist Republic was announced.\n\n32. And it would be quite wrong to present the processes of ‘Sovietisation’ as something\n\ndirected solely by Moscow. At the time there was a civil war within Russia itself between\n\nthe Bolsheviks and the ‘white’ counter-revolutionary forces, and there was no single\n\ncentre for decision-making. Of particular note was the Ukrainian State, a project of former\n\nTsarist Adjutant-General Pavel Skoropadsky, who had proclaimed himself Hetman.\n\nWhile supporting the idea of Ukrainian independence, his government did not rule out a\n\nfederation with Russia on the basis of the fight against the Bolshevik threat. Nestor\n\nMakhno's anarchist movement, centred in what is now Zaporozhye and\n\nDnepropetrovsk/Dnieper Oblasts, also played a significant role in determining the\n\noutcome of the civil war on the ruins of the Russian Empire.\n\n33. All this shows that different parts of Ukraine had different visions of the country's future\n\ndevelopment due to historical factors. However, all of them envisaged isolation within\n\nthe boundaries of those territories that encompassed the new entities. Thus, we can say\n\nthat the territory of Ukraine in 1917-1920 was a mosaic of different formations, which\n\nwere often the result of the ambitions of individual politicians, a situational reaction to\n\nchanges in Moscow, Petrograd or Kiev, rather than a deliberate implementation of some\n\nclear national-state programme.19\n\n34. Magocsi's report does not actually consider the events of the Second World War and their\n\nimpact on the projects of Ukrainian statehood. The author's analysis is limited to the\n\nterritorial increments of the Ukrainian SSR (due to victory of the Soviet Union in the\n\n19 Zhiltsov S.S.

Meanwhile, in today's Ukraine the activities of the Organization of Ukrainian\n\nNationalists, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which are part of the phenomenon of\n\ncollaboration with Nazi - Hitler Germany, are glorified at the state level, which leads to\n\nan internal division of Ukraine.20 To no small extent, the popularisation and imposition\n\nof the Galician myth throughout Ukraine after 1991 has contributed to the internal\n\ndivisions in that country, first predominantly in electoral terms and then, during the\n\nOrange Revolution and Second Maidan, region-wise. Meanwhile, according to Soviet\n\nhistorians' calculations, over 16% of the Red Army personnel were of Ukrainian origin\n\n(about 7 million people). Dozens of partisan detachments operated behind the Germans'\n\nlines. As many as 2,021 Ukrainians were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.21\n\n35. The sections of the report dealing with the post-Soviet period look more like a\n\npresentation of Ukrainian ‘civic nationalism’. Indeed, the post-1991 situation in the\n\ncountry is paradoxical. By and large, the historical events of the early 1990s were not the\n\nlogical conclusion of a protracted and heroic national liberation struggle but rather an\n\nagreement reached between the Ukrainian communist nomenklatura and Ukrainian\n\nnationalists. Against the background of the beginning of the USSR’s collapse, the\n\ncommunist apparatchiks in Kiev realised that the only way to remain in power was to get\n\nrid of the power of Moscow, retaining full political and economic control on the basis of\n\na new legitimization, i.e. fight for independence.\n\n36. This allowed the well-known Ukrainian journalist Aleksandr Krivenko to characterise the\n\nnew national elite of post-Soviet Ukraine as ‘a product (fusion) of communists and\n\nnationalists.’22 The conglomerate nature of the post-Soviet Ukrainian elite has kept the\n\ncountry's political system running for years. It was a consequence of maintaining a\n\ncomplex balance of interests between different political, financial and economic groups,\n\nwith none of them gaining complete dominance. It is a rhetorical question, whether it had\n\nanything to do with the declared principles of ‘unity in diversity’. Rather, it was the\n\n20 Bakanov A. I. ‘NO KATSAP, NO KIKE, NO LYAKH’.

And the attempts of Ukrainian politicians to homogenise the\n\nidentity space by prioritising the ‘escape from Russia’ contributed to the internal crises\n\nthat erupted during the Orange Revolution, the Second Maidan and the Russian Spring.\n\n37. P.R. Magocsi speaks about the ‘unification’ of the ‘Ukrainian civic nation’ during the\n\nevents of 2014-2022. ‘The newest war with Russia (February 2022) has shown how\n\nstrong and widely shared the Ukrainian identity, whether ethnic or civic, has become,’ he\n\nconcludes. Magocsi is not alone in this; representatives of the Western expert community\n\nconsider the Russian factor to have ‘consolidated’ Ukrainian society.23 This assessment\n\ndoes not take into account that, first of all, the Ukrainian national project has significantly\n\nchanged since February 2014. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it represented a\n\ncompromise between a modification of the Ukrainian SSR and the nationalism nurtured\n\namong intellectuals in the western part of the country and in the diaspora with an outside\n\ninfluence. After the 'second Maidan', the national project began to develop as a 'sanation',\n\ni.e. a serious 'clean-up' of those forces that proved unprepared for the new post-Maidan\n\nstatus quo.24 Secondly, while Western authors consider Crimea and Donbas the territories\n\nof Ukraine, the homogenisation of the ‘civic Ukrainian nation’ has been achieved through\n\nthe withdrawal of residents of the peninsula and significant parts of the Donetsk, Lugansk,\n\nZaporozhye and Kherson Oblasts. Western authors may not agree with their motivation,\n\nbut it is clear that these people do not want to participate in the ‘renewed’ Ukrainian\n\nproject after the two Maidans. Thirdly, according to the UN, as of the end of February,\n\n2023 the number of refugees from Ukraine was more than 8 million, with 2.8 million\n\npeople moving to Russia, more than in any of the European Union countries.25\n\n23 Motyl A.

I, Alexei Gayarovich Zhafyarov, submit this witness statement in relation to the issues of\n\ncountering extremism in the Russian Federation that were raised in Ukraine’s Reply to\n\nthe Counter-Memorial of the Russian Federation in the proceedings before the\n\nInternational Court of Justice.\n\n2. Since 2006, I have been deputy head of the department for supervising the\n\nimplementation of the law on federal security, inter-ethnic relations and combating\n\nextremism and terrorism of the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation.\n\nBefore 2006, I held various positions in the bodies of the Ministry of Justice of the\n\nRussian Federation and the Judicial Department of the Supreme Court of the Russian\n\nFederation. For most of my career I have dealt with issues directly related to countering\n\nextremist organisations.\n\nA. LAWS ON EXTREMISM\n\n3. In the Russian Federation, Federal Law No. 114-FZ “On Countering Extremist Activity”\n\ndated 25 July 2002 (hereinafter the “Law No. 114-FZ”) has been in force since 2002. I\n\nwas not among the drafters of the original text of the aforementioned law, but I am very\n\nwell familiar with the practice of its application since 2002 and actively participated in\n\nthe formation of this law enforcement practice by the Prosecutor General’s Office of the\n\nRussian Federation.\n\n4. Law No. 114-FZ is a framework law: its provisions are further developed through the\n\napplication of other legislative acts, including the Code of Administrative Offences of the\n\nRussian Federation (hereinafter the “CAO”) and the Criminal Code of the Russian\n\nFederation (hereinafter the “Criminal Code”). Most of the measures taken by the state\n\nauthorities to implement this law are prophylactic and preventive. They are primarily\n\naimed at eliminating the causes and conditions leading to manifestation of extremism. I\n\nconsider the preventive measures of extremism legislation in more detail below.\n\n5. Direct prosecution of those involved in extremism is not regulated by Law No. 114-FZ\n\nbut by criminal legislation, whose provisions have been substantially relaxed by the\n\nlegislator since 2002. For example, criminal prosecution for incitement to extremism is\n\ncurrently only permissible where softer preventive measures fail to produce the desired\n\neffect, for instance, when violence, threats of violence or the offender is a repeater.\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 4 out of 22\n\n6. Since the beginning of the application of the Law No. 114-FZ, it was primarily members\n\nof neo-Nazi and radical nationalist movements, including radical Russian nationalists,\n\nand members of radical pseudo-religious organisations who were held criminally liable\n\nfor extremism. Criminal proceedings were generally brought under article 282 of the\n\nRussian Criminal Code (Incitement of Hatred or Enmity). In the early years of the\n\napplication of the Law No. 114-FZ, a number of Russian nationalist organisations were\n\ndeclared extremist, such as the Religious group Krasnodar Orthodox Slavic Community\n\n“VEK RA” (Vedic Culture of Russian Aryans) of the Scythian Vesi Russeniya”, Ryazan\n\ncity non-governmental patriotic organisation “Russian National Unity”, International\n\nPublic Association “National Socialist Society”, Primorye Region Human Rights Non-\n\nGovernmental Organisation “Union of Slavs”, “Interregional Social Movement “Slavic\n\nUnion”, Interregional Public Association “Spiritual and Patrimonial Power of Rus” and\n\nothers.\n\n7. Thanks to the effective work of law enforcement agencies, the number of crimes covered\n\nby this article has decreased substantially. As I pointed out above, in 2018 article 282 of\n\nthe Criminal Code were partially decriminalized: actions aimed at inciting hatred or\n\nenmity, as well as at disparagement of a person or group of persons on the grounds of\n\ngender, race, nationality, language, origin, attitude towards religion or membership of any\n\nsocial group, committed in public, are now by default an administrative offence under\n\nArticle 20.3.1 of the CAO. Criminal prosecution for such an act under Article 282 of the\n\nCriminal Code remains possible only in the presence of aggravating circumstances:\n\n(a) if the offender has already been held administratively liable for incitement to\n\nextremism but then reoffends within a year thereafter;\n\n(b) if the acts involved the use or threat of violence; or\n\n(c) if the acts were committed through abuse of official position or by an organized\n\ngroup.\n\nB. THE YEAR 2013 CHANGES\n\n8. In December 2013, Article 280.1 was added to the Criminal Code, which prohibited calls\n\nfor violation of the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. I was involved in the\n\ndrafting of this article and I know the purpose of this provision: it was combating acts\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 5 out of 22\n\naimed at infringing on the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. This article could\n\nin no way be related to Crimea in 2013.\n\n9. The law introducing Article 280.1 into the Russian Criminal Code was adopted in an\n\nexpedited manner because of a sudden and serious threat to the security of the Russian\n\nstate. In 2013, separatist groups that advocate the violation of the territorial integrity of\n\nthe Russian Federation began to appear en masse on various internet sites, mainly on\n\nsocial networks.\n\n10. The most prominent were the so-called social movements:\n\n(a) “Free Idel-Ural”, whose members had a mission that consisted in unlawful seizure\n\nof the territories of the Republics of Tatarstan, Udmurtia, Bashkortostan, Mari-El,\n\nChuvashia and Mordovia from the Russian Federation;\n\n(b) “Crimson Wedge – Independent Kuban”, whose members had a mission that\n\nconsisted in unlawful seizure of the territories of Krasnodar Krai, Rostov Oblast,\n\nAdygea, Stavropol Krai and Karachay-Cherkessia from the Russian Federation and\n\nwho were hiding their intentions behind discussions regarding the creation of a\n\ncertain “Kuban People’s Republic”;\n\n(c) “March for the Federalisation of Siberia” whose participants sought to illegally\n\nalienate a number of Siberian regions from the Russian Federation, disguising their\n\nillegal activities by organising supposedly peaceful rallies and marches in Siberian\n\ncities; and\n\n(d) “Stop Feeding Moscow” movement, whose participants sought to illegally alienate\n\na number of regions of the Urals and Siberia from the Russian Federation, under\n\nthe guise of pseudo-socialist slogans.\n\n11. These movements were coordinated via relevant Internet portals and communities in\n\nsocial networks by a small group of activists who had previously left the territory of the\n\nRussian Federation and may have been recruited by special services of foreign states\n\ninterested in destabilising the situation in the Russian Federation.\n\n12. The emergence of these groups, whose activities posed a serious threat to the public order\n\nand security, as well as the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, required urgent\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 6 out of 22\n\namendments to the laws on extremism. Given the absence of an article in the Criminal\n\nCode that would directly prohibit calls for violation of the territorial integrity of the\n\nRussian Federation, the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Russian Federation did not\n\nhave the necessary authority to prohibit the dissemination of information about these\n\ngroups on the Internet, including ordering the owners of web resources and social\n\nnetworks to remove the relevant information, or ordering telecommunications operators\n\nto restrict access to the relevant web pages. This was a real threat to the territorial integrity\n\nof the Russian Federation and required the adoption of measures, including preventive\n\nones. In other words, Article 280.1 of the Criminal Code was necessary to counter\n\nextremist activities and block access to the relevant web sites and groups in social\n\nnetworks, which pose a significant threat to the public order and the security of the\n\nRussian Federation.\n\n13. In practical terms, the criminalisation of calls for violation of the territorial integrity has\n\nyielded positive results to the Russian Federation. In the early years of the rule\n\napplication, the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Russian Federation successfully\n\nmanaged to remove several thousand links to web resources per year. Currently, the\n\nnumber of links that are removed every year is much lower.\n\n14. The law enforcement practice of the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian\n\nFederation in the area of blocking Internet resources is organised in full accordance with\n\nthe requirements of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, in particular that\n\nany measures of state coercion must:\n\n(a) on the one hand, differentiate legal responsibility according to the gravity of the act,\n\nthe amount and nature of the damage caused, the degree of culpability of the\n\noffender and the nature and degree of public danger of the offences;\n\n(b) on the other hand, have a reasonable deterrent effect necessary to ensure compliance\n\nwith the precepts protected by administrative tort law.\n\n15. For example, if calls to violate the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation were\n\ncontained only on one page of an Internet resource, the Prosecutor General’s Office of\n\nthe Russian Federation demanded that access to that particular page, and not to the entire\n\nInternet resource, be blocked.\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 7 out of 22\n\n16. Thanks to the preventive and proactive measures taken, extremist movements whose\n\nactivities were aimed at violating the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation have\n\nbeen prevented from gaining popularity in the Russian segment of the Internet: the\n\nblocking has prevented search for like-minded individuals for these movements, cut off\n\ncommunications and stopped the spread of the movements in the Russian media space\n\nand prevented the transformation of such groups into organisations with an established\n\nhierarchy.\n\n17. The adoption of this amendment, as well as the systematic combating of extremist\n\nactivities, has significantly reduced the number of people involved in extremist activities.\n\nThis is clearly demonstrated by official statistics. According to statistics from the\n\nProsecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation, by 2015, the law enforcement\n\nagencies managed to stop the “explosive” growth (25% per year) in the number of those\n\nwho committed extremism crimes in the Russian Federation:\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 8 out of 22\n\n* Number of persons who committed extremism crimes\n\nMoreover, official statistics show that even after the reunification of Crimea with the\n\nRussian Federation, there has not been a significant increase in extremist crimes.\n\n18. With regard to the criminal prosecution, the number of prosecutions initiated and brought\n\nto trial under Article 280.1 of the Criminal Code was rather low. From 2013 to 2022, only\n\n121 crimes under Article 280.1 of the Criminal Code were registered, while in 2021 and\n\n2022 there were none.\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 9 out of 22\n\nC. PREVENTIVE MEASURES\n\n19. In terms of the correlation between prevention measures and criminal prosecution\n\nmeasures, Russia’s model of countering extremist activity differs from the American one.\n\nThis model to which the Russian Federation adheres focuses on both prevention and\n\nsuppression of the spread of radical ideas. This helps prevent the transition from nonviolent\n\nforms of extremism to violent ones and reduces the need for criminal measures.\n\n20. For example, the Russian law on extremism grants the bodies of the General Prosecutor’s\n\nOffice of the Russian Federation the power to issue the following to non-governmental\n\nand religious organisations:\n\n(a) warnings not to engage in extremist activities, if there is information about unlawful\n\nacts being prepared; and\n\n(b) a written warning on the discovery of facts demonstrating that the organisation’s\n\nactivities show signs of extremism.\n\n21. These preventive measures are much less severe than the instantaneous ban of the\n\norganisation concerned and do not involve criminal prosecution of its members and\n\nleaders. Subsequent measures are only taken if the organisation fails to comply with the\n\nwarning or commits other acts showing signs of extremism within one year from the date\n\nof receipt of the warning. Accordingly, such measures are aimed at preventing the\n\ncommission of extremist offences.\n\n22. Furthermore, issuing a warning or commits balances the interests of the society as a whole\n\nand those of the specific organisation, as bona fide organisations are granted the\n\nopportunity to bring their activities into line with the laws on extremism and to appeal the\n\nwarning or commits in court in order to ensure an independent and transparent check of\n\nthe reasonableness of them. Thus, the lawfulness and validity of warnings and commits\n\nissued by officials of the Procurator-General’s Office of the Russian Federation and the\n\nprocurator’s offices of the entities of the Russian Federation may be reviewed by courts\n\nof several instances: in the trial court, in the court of appeal, in the court of cassation and\n\nin the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation under the supervisory procedure.\n\n23. Given that an appeal can be lodged, the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Russian\n\nFederation carefully reviews all the evidence before issuing a warning or commits in each\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 10 out of 22\n\nparticular case and ensures strict compliance with the procedural rules in their issuing.\n\nThe addressees of warnings and commits on the impermissibility of extremist activity\n\nhave the possibility of appealing against them in court.\n\nD. PROHIBITION OF AZOV REGIMENT\n\n24. As a recent example of the fight against extremism in the Russian Federation, I can cite\n\nthe prohibition of the Ukrainian paramilitary nationalist association Azov, also known as\n\n“Azov Battalion” or “Azov Regiment”.\n\n25. Azov association was established in May 2014 by members of various radical groups who\n\nheld radical far-right and neo-Nazi views. The ideology of this association was based on\n\nNazi ideology prohibited by judgments of the International Military Tribunal in\n\nNuremberg. In particular, members of Azov used Nazi paraphernalia and symbols,\n\nincluding swastika tattoos, chevrons similar to the German Wolfsangel, and the books\n\nMein Kampf:\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 11 out of 22\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 12 out of 22\n\n26. In addition, members of the Azov association have publicly expressed racist slogans, held\n\nanti-Russian marches, including with torches similar to Nazi marches in the Third Reich\n\nand modern neo-Nazi events, and committed other actions aimed at inciting hatred against\n\nthe Russian and Russian-speaking population of Donbas.\n\n27. For example, on 22 October 2015 and on 20 October 2015, Azov fighters held processions\n\nand ceremonies that looked similar to the “roll call of the dead” or “last roll call”\n\nceremonies held by members of the Nazi Party on the Memorial Day of the Fallen Heroes\n\nof the Nazi Party in Germany (on the day the “beer putsch” began – 08 November 1923).\n\nThe number of participants in these marches was over a thousand and five thousand\n\nfighters respectively. In particular, during the first procession, the fighters of Azov lined\n\nup on the football field and then moved with torches, flags and symbols of Azov, finishing\n\nthe procession in front of the regiment’s base, where a memorial sign to the dead Azov\n\nsoldiers in the form of a mound with three swords stuck in it was erected. Then in front\n\nof it were lined up 33 Azov fighters, symbolising the 33 dead, with shields on which the\n\ncall sign of the dead was written in runic script, and after his name was called, the fighter\n\nraised his shield and said “In formation!”.\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 13 out of 22\n\n28. During its marches, rallies and concerts, Azov unashamedly replicated the vocabulary,\n\nsymbols and rituals of the Third Reich, broadcasting videos of German stormtroopers\n\ndiving, firing tanks decorated with runes and German crosses, videos of SS marches\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 14 out of 22\n\nincluding fighters from their eastern units, alternating with images of wolves and\n\nwerewolves. Participants in such actions often displayed Nazi salutes with their right\n\nhands raised. There are obvious similarities between this symbolism and rituals of the\n\nAzov regiment and those of the contemporary neo-Nazi movements:\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 15 out of 22\n\n29. Finally, Azov members have staged fights and pogroms against fans with a black skin,\n\nCommunist party supporters and the pro-Russian population of Ukraine. It is not\n\nuncommon for them to post video recordings of their actions. For example, Azov activists\n\nare known to have been involved in the 20 October 2015 beating of two fans with a black\n\nskin who entered the stands of the Dynamo stadium in Kyiv during a match between FC\n\nDynamo (Kiev) and Chelsea. On 17 March 2016, members of the Azov Civil Corps\n\nattacked a picket of the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine in central Kiev, whose\n\nparticipants were mostly elderly people.\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 16 out of 22\n\n30. Instead of suppressing the activities of Azov association, the Ukrainian law-enforcement\n\nauthorities and security agencies supported it and turned it into a paramilitary unit by\n\nincorporating the Azov Regiment into the Ukrainian National Guard and providing it with\n\nmilitary equipment and heavy weaponry for use against the population of Donbas. Highranking\n\nUkrainian law enforcement officials spoke flatteringly of Azov: in particular, the\n\nhead of the Department for Combating Drug Crimes of the National Police of Ukraine,\n\nIlya Kiva, called it “a fighting regiment for the purity of the Ukrainian nation”.\n\n31. During combat activity since 2014 by the armed forces of the Kiev regime against\n\nresidents of south-eastern Ukraine, fighters of the Azov Regiment committed mass crimes\n\nagainst the Russian-speaking population, persecuting them on the basis of their language.\n\nThe commission of such crimes by the Azov Regiment continues, unfortunately, to this\n\nday. Thus, the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Russian Federation has documented\n\nnumerous instances where civilians were held hostage and used as human shields.\n\n32. In addition, Azov leaders attempted to commit terrorist acts in Crimea and organised\n\nattacks at governmental and religious institutions of the Republic of Crimea.\n\n33. In 2016, one of Azov’s leaders, Andriy Biletsky, formed the political party National\n\nCorps for the direct participation of the Azov association in Ukraine’s popularly elected\n\nbodies. Leaders of the National Corps party organise and carry out recruitment of\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 17 out of 22\n\nindividual Azov regiment battalions across Ukraine (e.g. Azov-Prykarpattya and Azov-\n\nPoltava), as well as public rallies of nationalists taking the “oath”.\n\n34. In addition, Azov has attempted to recruit Russian citizens in the Russian Federation to\n\njoin its ranks for combat operations in the Donbass. For this purpose, Azov activists\n\norganized an extremist group “Mizanthropik Division” in the Internet messenger\n\n“Telegram”, which sanctified actions in support of the Azov regiment and organized the\n\nposting of flyers and banners in the Russian Federation. In August 2022, the Supreme\n\nCourt of the Russian Federation examined an application of the General Prosecutor’s\n\nOffice of the Russian Federation and the facts referred to above and on their basis declared\n\nthe organisation a terrorist organisation and prohibited its activity on the territory of the\n\nRussian Federation.1\n\nE. NO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE FIGHT AGAINST EXTREMISM\n\n35. As part of my work at the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Russian Federation, I have\n\nbeen involved in international cooperation on countering extremism. Specifically, I was\n\na member of the Russian Federation delegations at meetings of the Organisation for\n\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. At no such platform for international cooperation\n\nhas the issue ever been raised that the Russian model for countering extremism is\n\nallegedly discriminatory in general or with regard to any ethnic or national group or\n\notherwise violates the prohibition of racial discrimination imposed by the Convention on\n\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. I am not aware of any instances\n\n1 Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, Decision, No. AKPI22-411S, 2 August 2022.\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 18 out of 22\n\nin which the Russian practice of combatting extremism has been criticized internationally\n\nas discriminatory, including in relation to Ukrainians or Crimean Tatars living on the\n\nterritory of the peninsula of Crimea.\n\n36. One of the key objectives of Russian legislation on extremism is the prevention of social,\n\nracial, national or religious discord. Any possible restrictions on rights, including the right\n\nto freedom of movement or freedom of expression under Law No. 114-FZ are aimed at\n\nensuring national security of the Russian Federation and preventing manifestations of,\n\ninter alia, racial or other discrimination. Accordingly, it would be highly incorrect to view\n\nthe anti-extremist restrictions in Law No. 114-FZ as violating the prohibition of racial\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n37. The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation has repeatedly pointed out that Law\n\nNo. 114-FZ complies with the Constitution of the Russian Federation and the standards\n\nfor the protection of human and civil rights and freedoms as its application takes into\n\naccount the rights and freedoms guaranteed by international legal acts:\n\n(a) The need to legally restrict freedom of expression, assembly and association for the\n\npurpose of countering extremism is also highlighted in the Parliamentary Assembly\n\nof the Council of Europe Resolution 1344 (2003) on “Threats to Democracy by\n\nExtremist Parties and Movements in Europe”, stressing that, regardless of its nature,\n\nextremism is a form of political activity which denies, explicitly or implicitly, the\n\nprinciples of parliamentary democracy and is based on ideologies and practices of\n\nintolerance, exclusion, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and ultra-nationalism (para 3),\n\nand the tendency of some extremist movements to find justification for their actions\n\nin religion carries a double danger: on the one hand, it fosters intolerance, religious\n\nfanaticism and fundamentalism and, on the other hand, leads to the isolation of\n\nentire religious communities because of individuals who abuse the universal values\n\nof religion (Ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation dated 2\n\nJuly 2013 No. 1053-O).\n\n(b) If a citizen, while exercising his constitutional rights and freedoms (including\n\nfreedom of thought and speech, freedom of creativity, the right to hold and\n\ndisseminate beliefs and to act in accordance with them), violates the rights and\n\nfreedoms of others and such violation (whether directed against specific individuals\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 19 out of 22\n\nor against public order in general) is socially dangerous and unlawful, the offender\n\nmay be held liable under public law (including criminal law), which aims to protect\n\npublic interests (Ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation dated\n\n27 October 2015 No. 2450-O).\n\n(c) Court-ordered confiscation of information materials deemed extremist by a\n\nprosecutor is not linked to liability, is not a sanction (punishment) for the offence,\n\nbut is essentially a special measure of state counteraction to extremism aimed at\n\npreventing extremist activity, including by identifying and subsequently\n\neliminating the causes and conditions that contribute to it (Ruling of the\n\nConstitutional Court of the Russian Federation dated 02 July 2013 No. 1053-O).\n\n(d) Extremist activities, being addressed to the mass consciousness or the attention of\n\ncertain segments of society, segmented by religious, ethnic and other\n\ncharacteristics, and aimed at forming an environment of acceptability of terrorist\n\nideology and even desirability of its implementation in public practice, also create\n\na need for adequate and effective measures of preventive nature (Ruling of the\n\nConstitutional Court of the Russian Federation dated 21 September 2017 No. 1797-\n\nO).\n\n38. Although the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (hereinafter the\n\n“Committee”) expressed general concern that the provisions of the Law No. 114-FZ were,\n\nin their view, broad and can potentially be used randomly, this comment was hypothetical\n\nand the Committee did not state that the law was applied in such way, nor did the\n\nCommittee mention that the law in question has ever been applied against any ethnic\n\ngroups or national minorities.\n\n39. In my view, the Committee expressed only general concern, as it was not aware the direct\n\nimplementation of Law No. 114-FZ in practice, with a focus primarily at prevention while\n\nthe sanctions for breaches of the law are primarily administrative in nature (e.g. a fine)\n\nwithout the imposition of criminal liability. Furthermore, the Committee had probably\n\nnot been informed that the wording of the Law No. 114-FZ it analysed is subsequently\n\nmade more specific in other laws, including the CAO and the Criminal Code and in law\n\nenforcement practice, which precludes broad and the more so arbitrary interpretation of\n\nthe law.\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 20 out of 22\n\n40. Thus, between 2016 and 2018, the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian\n\nFederation provided a number of clarifications on the practice of application of the\n\nlegislation on extremism, which further specified its wording and its correlation with\n\nhuman and civil rights and freedoms:\n\n(a) Considering criminal cases on extremism-related crimes, courts shall take into\n\naccount the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian\n\nFederation and international legal acts, such as freedom of conscience and religion,\n\nfreedom of thought, speech and mass information, the right to freely seek, receive,\n\ntransmit, produce and disseminate information by any lawful means, the right to\n\nassemble peacefully, without weapons, to hold meetings, rallies and\n\ndemonstrations, marches and pickets (para. 1 of the Resolution of the Plenum of the\n\nSupreme Court of the Russian Federation dated 28 June 2011 No. 11 as amended\n\nby the Resolution dated 20 September 2018 No. 32).\n\n(b) The said rights and freedoms may only be restricted in exceptional cases expressly\n\nset out in federal law to the extent necessary in a democratic society in order to\n\nprotect the foundations of the constitutional order, morality, health, rights and\n\nlawful interests of other persons, to ensure the country’s defence and security,\n\npublic order and territorial integrity (para. 1 of the Resolution of the Plenum of the\n\nSupreme Court of the Russian Federation dated 28 June 2011 No. 11, as amended\n\nby the Resolution dated 20 September 2018 No. 32).\n\n(c) Courts must proceed from the nature and degree of public danger of the act and take\n\ninto account that an act, although formally containing elements of a criminal\n\noffence, does not constitute a crime, but does not pose a public danger due to its\n\ninsignificance, for example, taking into account the size and composition of the\n\naudience, the number of views and the influence of extremist information on the\n\nbehaviour of the persons comprising that audience (para. 8.1 of the Resolution of\n\nthe Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated 28 June 2011 No.\n\n11, as amended by the Resolution dated 20 September 2018 No. 32).\n\n(d) Courts must ensure that sentences imposed on persons found guilty of extremist\n\noffences are individualised, for example, by ascertaining and taking into account\n\nthe conditions of the minor’s life and upbringing, the level of mental development,\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 21 out of 22\n\nother personal characteristics, and the influence of older persons on the minor (para.\n\n24 of the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation\n\ndated 28 June 2011 No. 11).\n\n41. The Russian laws on extremism are applied uniformly on the territory of all constituent\n\nentities of the Russian Federation. They began to take shape long before the reunification\n\nof Crimea with Russia in 2014 and continue to be developed now, having a delayed\n\npositive effect in guaranteeing a stable rule of law and development of justice. That said,\n\nafter the reunification of Crimea with the Russian Federation, the organisations who were\n\noperating in the territory of Crimea were even provided with more favourable conditions\n\ncompared to organisations operating in other Russian regions, to ensure their smooth\n\ntransition to the legal framework of the Russian Federation.\n\n42. One significant extremist threat in Crimea came from Hizb ut-Tahrir and Tablighi Jamaat\n\norganisations, which are banned in a number of states but have not been banned in\n\nUkraine. For example, Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in Bangladesh, Germany, Indonesia and\n\na number of Arab states. The ideological basis of these organisations is radical pseudoreligious\n\nideas falsely presented as branches in Islam. These organisations are, in turn,\n\nbreeding grounds for recruiters of terrorist organisations, including ISIS which is a\n\nterrorist organisation banned in the Russian Federation. As the majority of Crimean\n\nTatars in Crimea are Muslims, measures to combat such organisations may legitimately\n\naffect the Crimean Tatars who, along with other persons, profess Islam and are members\n\nof such organisations.\n\n43. However, given that these organizations were not banned when Crimea was part of\n\nUkraine, after the accession of the peninsula to the Russian Federation, members of these\n\norganizations living in Crimea were not prosecuted for participation in the activities of\n\nan extremist organization for a long time. They were given a year to voluntarily renounce\n\nparticipation in the banned organizations. There was also a moratorium on the seizure of\n\nextremist materials by law enforcement agencies in Crimea, so that their owners could\n\nvoluntarily surrender the banned literature and avoid prosecution.\n\n44. As for the Mejlis, which is banned in the Russian Federation, they, as stated in the\n\nAppellate Ruling of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated 29 September\n\n2016, were declared an extremist organisation in view of the fact that they organised and\n\nAnnex 22\n\nPage 22 out of 22\n\nperformed acts of violence to block the operation of the border control post on 03 May\n\n2014 and were carrying out the blockade of Crimea, which resulted in power supply and\n\ncommunication equipment disconnection on the peninsula. Despite this, the Russian law\n\nenforcement authorities have not yet initiated any criminal proceedings on the grounds of\n\nmembership of the said organisation.\n\nF. CONCLUSION\n\n45. Thus, it can be concluded that Russian laws on extremism do not discriminate against any\n\nethnic or national group and do not allow for excessive or arbitrary criminal prosecution;\n\nthey provide primarily preventive and proactive measures and are driven exclusively by\n\nthe fight of the State against radical manifestations of extremism, such as terrorist\n\nactivities of the Azov organisation.\n\n46.

I, , have previously given witness statement in the\n\nproceedings initiated by Ukraine before the International Court of Justice (hereinafter,\n\n“First Witness Statement”). I covered in them, among others, the following topics:\n\n(a) The process of listing the Khan’s Palace as a UNESCO World Heritage Site;\n\n(b) The state of the Khan's Palace, which required urgent restoration work;\n\n(c) Progress of repair and restoration works at the Khan’s Palace.\n\n2. I have familiarized myself with the content of the Ukraine Reply to the Counter-Memorial\n\nof the Russian Federation (hereinafter, “Reply”). I believe that Ukraine has not presented\n\nany arguments or evidence that would refute my witness statement. Moreover, Ukraine\n\nhas simply ignored a significant number of the facts I mentioned, and with regard to the\n\nrest it makes unsubstantiated or contradictory allegations.\n\n3. I have prepared a new witness statement (hereinafter, “Second Witness Statement”) in\n\norder to give detailed comments on Ukraine's arguments.\n\nB. INTERACTION WITH UNESCO\n\n4. Ukraine claims that UNESCO representatives are allegedly unable to enter the territory\n\nof the Khan’s Palace ensemble.1\n\n5. I have read excerpts from the UNESCO document2 to which Ukraine refers as supporting\n\nthe above argument, and must note that the information about the inability to enter Crimea\n\nrelates to the activities of another organization, namely the UN Human Rights Monitoring\n\nMission in Ukraine,3 but not UNESCO.\n\n6. Therefore, my explanation that the Bakhchisaray Historic, Cultural and Archeological\n\nMuseum and Reserve (hereinafter, “Museum-Reserve”) does not restrict UNESCO\n\n1 Reply, ¶648.\n\n2 Implementation of decisions and resolutions adopted by the Executive Board and the General Conference at\n\nprevious sessions thereof, Doc.

Ukraine refers to this document in ¶648\n\nof the Reply.\n\n3 See Ibid., ¶21.\n\nAnnex 23\n\nPage 4 out of 9\n\nrepresentatives’ access to the Khan’s Palace4 has not been refuted. On the contrary, as I\n\npointed out in my First Witness Statement, not only do we not prevent UNESCO\n\nrepresentatives from visiting the Khan’s Palace, but we would be happy to see them and\n\ncontinue our cooperation5.\n\nC. STATUS OF RESTORATION WORKS AT THE KHAN’S PALACE FACILITIES BEFORE 2014\n\n7. Ukraine’s claims that there were active restoration works going on in the Khan’s Palace\n\nbefore 2014 are quite unsubstantiated. Ukraine has not commented in any way on the\n\ndocuments I quoted indicating the unsatisfactory condition of the Khan’s Mosque in\n\n1989, 2003, 2010, and 2013.6 I managed to find only a reference to the letter of the\n\nnational (Ukrainian) coordinator of the International Centre for the Study of the\n\nPreservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (hereinafter, “National Coordinator\n\nLetter”).7 According to Ukraine, he allegedly studied the materials of scientific research\n\nof the Khan’s Palace for 1960, 1962, 1965, 1987, 1988, 1994 “and subsequent years”,\n\nprepared by the UkrNIIproyektrestavratsia Institute, as well as a large number of\n\nphotographs and description of works in progress 8 (here I must note that I do not\n\nunderstand how it conforms with the statement of Ukraine that it is denied the opportunity\n\nto obtain detailed information about the progress of such works).9\n\n8. From the contents of the letter, which draws general conclusions regarding the “high level\n\nof decisions taken” on the conservation, restoration and rehabilitation of historic building\n\nelements, it is not possible to ascertain what specific work was carried out, in what year,\n\nor on what grounds. Even the aforementioned scientific research materials are not\n\nattached to either the letter or the Reply, so I cannot comment on them substantively.\n\nHowever, I find it difficult to imagine what kind of high level we are talking about here.\n\nFor example, the author points out that he got acquainted with the research performed by\n\n4 First Witness Statement, ¶14.\n\n5 Crimean Newswire, Crimean Ministry of Culture Invites UNESCO Experts to Personally Assess Cultural\n\nDevelopment on Peninsula (18 September 2017), available at: https://crimeanews.\n\ncom/culture/2017/09/18/324396 html (Exhibit A).\n\n6 See First Witness Statement, ¶¶21-26.\n\n7 Letter of the National Coordinator of the ICCROM in Ukraine No.12 (27 April 2018). Annex 1030 to the\n\nMemorial.\n\n8 Ibid.\n\n9 Reply, ¶648\n\nAnnex 23\n\nPage 5 out of 9\n\nUkrNIIproyektrestavratsia in 1988. However, documents prepared by the same\n\norganisation in the following, 1989, year, clearly indicate the poor condition in which the\n\nmosque found itself then: they observed roof beam deflection, rotten lining, systematic\n\nwetting of wooden structures of the east façade, etc.10\n\n9. Claims of “active work” by UkrNIIproyektrestavratsia on the Khan’s Palace are in turn\n\nsupported only by a link to an internet resource that repeats the arguments of Ukraine\n\n(with the content of which I strongly disagree), but provides no real evidence\n\nwhatsoever.11\n\n10. Accordingly, the claims of a “high level of decision-making” regarding the restoration\n\nand preservation of the Khan’s Mosque in the pre-2014 period appear unsubstantiated to\n\nme.\n\nD. PROGRESS OF REPAIR AND RESTORATION WORKS AT THE KHAN’S PALACE FACILITIES\n\n11. Ukraine has made a number of statements regarding the progress of restoration works at\n\nthe Khan’s Palace facilities that I would also like to comment on, as I do not consider\n\nthem to be corresponding to reality.\n\n12. First, Ukraine claims that only a small part of the beams of the Khan’s Mosque needed to\n\nbe replaced.12 I cannot assess this claim due to the fact that, as far as I can see, Ukraine\n\nhas been unable to back it up in any way. This is particularly surprising in light of the fact\n\nthat, judging by the Letter of the National Coordinator, the documents on the study of the\n\nKhan’s Mosque have not been lost and the National Coordinator himself, as confirmed\n\nby publicly available data,13 was UkrNIIproyektrestavratsia’s director from 1983 to 2010.\n\n13. Second, as I pointed out in the First Witness Statement, the decision to replace the beams\n\nwas prompted by their infestation with rot, fungi and insects (which could spread to the\n\nrest of the wooden structures of the Khan’s Mosque) as well as their substantial wear and\n\n10 First Witness Statement, ¶21.\n\n11 Reply, ¶654.\n\n12 Reply, ¶654.\n\n13 Wikipedia, Antoniuk, Anatoly Evdokimovich, available at:\n\nhttps://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Антонюк,_Анатолий_Евдокимович (Exhibit B)\n\nAnnex 23\n\nPage 6 out of 9\n\ndeterioration in strength.14 That is why it was decided to dismantle the beams, remove the\n\ndamaged elements from them and, if possible, use that material in the restoration of other\n\nobjects. At present, the beams are stored on the territory of the Salachik historical and\n\narchaeological complex under round-the-clock guard.\n\n14. Third, I am also surprised that Ukraine has ignored the considerations I made in the First\n\nWitness Statement about the primary need to ensure the safety of people. The mosque is\n\na functioning facility and regularly visited by believers, as well as by Museum-Reserve\n\nemployees and tourists. It would be inadmissible to endanger their lives and health.\n\n15. Fourth, as far as I can judge, Ukraine has completely ignored my claim that the original\n\n“Tatarka” roof tiles covering the Khan’s Mosque were completely replaced as early as in\n\n1967. Also, despite the fact that I pointed out in the First Witness Statement that all the\n\ntiles removed from the roof had been transferred to the funds of the Museum-Reserve,\n\nUkraine claims that they were destroyed.15 This is obviously untrue. They were used in\n\nthe reconstruction of other facilities of the Khan’s Palace ensemble: The Sary-Guzel\n\nBathhouse, The Stable Pavilion, and The Library Pavilion.\n\n16. Fifth, Ukraine claims that the interior of the Khan’s Mosque was damaged due to the lack\n\nof protection from the weather.16 In fact, however, the interior of the Mosque was\n\nprotected by a temporary shelter during the works. The only incident of weather-related\n\nwetting was when rain fell inside the mosque through an installation opening made in the\n\ntemporary shelter above the central part of the mosque. I described that incident in the\n\nFirst Witness Statement.17 However, only the floor got soaked, while the inside of the\n\nmosque walls was not affected and waterproof insulation was restored in less than three\n\ndays.\n\n17. Sixth, it is worth pointing out separately that Ukraine does not provide any support for\n\nthe claim that restoration works are not usually carried out in winter time. As I already\n\nnoted in the first witness statement, the works were carried out in accordance with the\n\nagreed schedule. I am not aware of the extent to which it constitutes standard practice in\n\n14 First Witness Statement, ¶¶32-34.\n\n15 Reply, ¶649.\n\n16 Ibid.\n\n17 First Witness Statement, ¶43.\n\nAnnex 23\n\nPage 7 out of 9\n\ngeneral; however, I have read news reports that, for example, restoration works of the\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral were due to start in winter time.18\n\n18. Seventh, Ukraine claims that due to the use of improper cleaning technology using high\n\npressure washing equipment cracks formed on the wall.19 This claim is unsubstantiated.\n\nAs far as I know, during the works at the Khan’s Palace only gentle low-pressure water\n\ncleaning methods were used, only fragmentarily at that and only on the Soviet-era plaster\n\nlayer whose microcracks had been identified earlier due to partial deformation of the\n\nfoundations and walls.\n\nE. OTHER OBSERVATIONS\n\n19. To conclude my Second Witness Statement, I would like to share a few observations.\n\n20. First, I noticed that in the Reply, Ukraine alleges the “destruction” of the Khan’s Palace,\n\nalthough almost all of its claims refer to the works carried out on the Khan’s Mosque.\n\nHowever, as I pointed out in my first witness statement, the ensemble of the Khan’s\n\nPalace includes 17 facilities, many of which have been undergoing repair and restoration\n\nworks up to this time, including the Stable Pavilion, the Library Pavilion, the Falcon\n\nTower, the Main Building, the Harem Pavilion, the Khan’s Kitchen, the Gardens and the\n\nPark Structures. The works on the Khan’s Mosque have not been completed either. Some\n\nfacilities are awaiting commissioning, works on some more have been completed.\n\nMoreover, as far as I am aware, prior to 2014 in the USSR and Ukraine only isolated\n\nrepairs were made to some of facilities at Khan’s Palace, while a full-scale complex\n\nrestoration work was only commenced for the first time after reunification of Crimea with\n\nthe Russian Federation. Clearly, works of such scale cannot but face some problems, but\n\nby now mechanisms of internal and public control have been implemented that allow to\n\nquickly react to, and resolve issues as they arise.\n\n21.

Kryminform. Arina\n\nNovoselskaya, Minister of Culture of Crimea, invited\n\nUNESCO representatives to personally visit the peninsula for\n\nan objective assessment of the state of its cultural and\n\nhistorical heritage sites. She did so in response to an Ukrainian\n\nreport describing the condition of the Crimean cultural sites\n\npresented to UNESCO.\n\n“We are open. If there is such an initiative (for UNESCO representatives to visit Crimea), we\n\nwill be happy to open the doors of our museums and nature reserves, to show how much they\n\nhave improved, how they have become better off, what salaries museum staff get, and what\n\nadditions have been made to museum collections. We will be happy to do so to help them make\n\nan objective decision,” Mrs Novoselskaya said.\n\nEarlier, Ukraine presented a report describing the condition of the cultural heritage sites in\n\nCrimea for the first half of 2017 at a session of the UNESCO Executive Board. The report says\n\nit was prepared on the basis of materials obtained “from human rights defenders and other\n\nreliable sources” who were not disclosed. However, it is obvious that the authors of the report\n\nhave no idea about the current state of cultural and historical heritage sites in Crimea.\n\nIn particular, the Ukrainian side complains about some “illegal” geological work near the\n\nSwallow’s Nest, about the renovation of the Bakhchysarai Palace, archaeological excavations\n\nat the construction sites of the Tavrida highway and the access roads to the Crimean Bridge.\n\n“I think our colleagues need to come and see just how much our sites have improved. The rock\n\nbase of the Swallow’s Nest had to be reinforced because it could have collapsed being\n\nthreatened by water and storm winds. The Bakhchysarai Palace, one of the major UNESCO\n\nsites in the Republic of Crimea, is also being renovated and becoming more and more beautiful\n\nas we speak. Preventive maintenance work on the famous Divan Hall is near completion,” Mrs\n\nNovoselskaya said.\n\nA major complaint of the Ukrainian side was that the repair and renovation work takes place\n\nwithout their consent. “I worked in the cultural governance system under the Ukrainian rule, so\n\nI can tell you what Ukraine did,” said Mrs Novoselskaya. “No funding at all was provided for\n\nthe Vorontsov, Livadia, Massandra palaces, the Swallow’s Nest, and Chekhov’s Dacha.\n\nAnnex 23 Exhibit A\n\nAdministrations of the Palaces barely made ends meet to pay their staff a meagre salary. What\n\nkind of renovation, or collection enlargement, or facility improvement could we talk about\n\nthen? They were simply stricken off from the budget of the Republic! This is a good example\n\nof how Crimean cultural heritage sites were treated during the Ukrainian time”.\n\nAccording to the Minister, the citizens of Ukraine have not been banned from accessing cultural\n\nheritage sites in Crimea and they do visit them while spending their vacations there.\n\nExhibit B\n\nWikipedia, Antoniuk, Anatoly Evdokimovich\n\n(translation)\n\nAnnex 23 Exhibit B\n\n▪ in Moscow – the Cultural Centre of Ukraine;\n\n▪ in Sevastopol – St. Vladimir’s Cathedral, etc.\n\nFrom 1983 to 2010, Mr. Antonyuk was the Director of UkrNIIproektrestavratsiya Design\n\nInstitute under the State Committee on Construction of Ukraine.\n\nIn 1992, Mr. Antonyuk was an adviser to the Director General of the International Centre for\n\nthe Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property at UNESCO (Rome).\n\nSince 2013, Mr. Antonyuk has been working at the National Kyiv-Pechersk Historical and\n\nCultural Reserve.\n\nSince 2016, Mr. Antonyuk has been the National Coordinator of the ICCROM of Ukraine\n\n(International Centre for Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property)\n\nHe has 55 printed works and four copyright certificates for inventions.\n\nSelected publications:\n\n▪ Enclosing Structures in Rural Civil Buildings.

Work to secure and reinforce the Notre-Dame Cathedral,\n\nheavily damaged by fire more than two years ago, has been completed, and reconstruction is\n\nscheduled to commence this winter, according to a press release by the public institution in\n\ncharge of the restoration of Notre-Dame.\n\n“The work to secure and reinforce the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral that began on the 16th of\n\nApril 2019, has been successfully completed in accordance with the established schedule,” the\n\npress release says as quoted by BFM TV.\n\nIn particular, scaffolding has been removed, wooden framework has been installed, and leadcontaminated\n\nareas have been cleaned up.\n\nThe press release stresses that restoration works are scheduled to begin this winter.\n\nThe largest fire in the history of the Notre-Dame Cathedral broke out on the 15th of April 2019.\n\nThe spire of the cathedral collapsed, and the supporting structure was engulfed in flames. The\n\nfire destroyed the unique wooden roof framework made of 800-year old oak beams, each from\n\nAnnex 23 Exhibit C\n\na single tree trunk. According to firefighters, the overall structure of Notre-Dame and the main\n\nrelics kept at the cathedral have survived. French President Emmanuel Macron has announced\n\nan ambitious goal to restore Notre Dame in five years, although many experts say that the\n\nreconstruction will take 10 to 15 years.\n\nExhibit D\n\nSBI RC Bakhchisaray Historical, Cultural and Archeological Museum-Reserve, Letter to the\n\nHead of the Republic of Crimea S.

The first founding meeting was led by Sergey Aksyonov, Head of the Republic\n\nof Crimea. “The Khan’s Palace is not only a pearl of Crimea, it is a unique and one-of-a-kind\n\nmonument to traditions and culture of the Crimean Tatar people. It is planned that the\n\nrestoration work will bring the palace back to its historical appearance, to what it looked like\n\nwhen it was built,” Mr. Aksyonov said.\n\nThe Public Advisory Panel consists of Dmitry Rudnitsky, Chairman of the Union of Restorers,\n\nan archaeologist, Head of the Department of History at the Fevzi Yakubov Crimean\n\nEngineering & Pedagogical University, Emil Seidaliev, a historian, Andrey Malgin, a regional\n\nethnographer, construction engineers Eldar Yayachik and Enver Emirdjiev, architects and\n\nrestorers Valery Borisov and Shukri Khalilov.\n\n“The efforts of this Panel will be aimed at helping the restoration workers and at keeping the\n\npublic informed to avoid any potential speculations around the restoration of the Khan’s\n\nPalace,” said Crimean Mufti Hadji Emirali Ablayev.\n\nSergey Aksyonov noted that the Public Advisory Panel will also provide monitoring at other\n\nfuture cultural heritage work sites.\n\n“Given that we have more than 4,000 various cultural monuments in the Republic of Crimea, I\n\nsuggest that we should identify the most significant cultural heritage sites that are unique and\n\nsymbolise Crimean historical milestones. These should include the main palace ensembles and\n\nmonuments associated with the culture of all the ethnicities who have inhabited the peninsula.\n\nA specification of requirements will be issued by the Panel every time repair and restoration\n\nwork is to be carried out at such sites. This will help avoid unnecessary expenses and ensure\n\nthat the sites preserve their original appearance,” Mr. Aksyonov said.\n\nThe meeting was also attended by Mikhail Nazarov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of\n\nMinisters of the Republic of Crimea, Karlen Petrosyan, Minister of Construction and\n\nArchitecture of the Republic of Crimea, Tatiana Manezhina, Minister of Culture of the Republic\n\nof Crimea, and Ayder Tippa, Chairman of the State Committee for Interethnic Relations of the\n\nRepublic of Crimea.\n\nAnnex 23 Exhibit E\n\nPress Service of the Spiritual Direction of the Muslims of Crimea, based on the information\n\nprovided by the Information and Press Office of the Head of the Republic of Crimea.\n\nExhibit F\n\nNational University of Kiev-Mohyla Academy, Dr Kateryna Busol\n\nExhibit G\n\nKateryna Busol, Crimea's Occupation Exemplifies the Threat of Attacks on Cultural Heritage,\n\nChatham House (4 February 2020)\n\nAnnex 23 Exhibit G\n\n— ‘The destructive reconstruction of the 16th-century Bakhchysarai Palace is being conducted by a team\n\nwith no experience of cultural sites, in a manner that erodes its authenticity and historical value.’ Photo:\n\nGetty Images.\n\nViolations against cultural property – such as archaeological treasures, artworks,\n\nmuseums or historical sites – can be no less detrimental to the survival of a nation\n\nthan the physical persecution of its people.
