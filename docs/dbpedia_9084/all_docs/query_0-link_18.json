        "text": "Lodomeria is the Latinized name of Volodymyr[1] (Old Slavic: Володимѣръ, Volodiměrŭ; Ukrainian: Лодомерія, Lodomeriia; Polish: Lodomeria; Slovak: Lodomeria; Hungarian: Lodomeria; Czech: Vladiměř; German: Lodomerien; Romanian: Lodomeria), a Ruthenian principality also referred to as the Principality of Volhynia, which was founded by the Rurik dynasty in 987[citation needed] in the western parts of Kievan Rus'. It was centered on the region of Volhynia, straddling the borders of modern-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. The Principality of Volodymyr arose in the course of the 12th century along with the Principality of Halych.[1]\n\n\"Vladimir\" is the Russian form of the name of the city now called Volodymyr, which was the capital of the Principality.\n\nUpon the first partition of Poland in 1772, the name \"Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria\" (probably[original research?] in reference to the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia) was given by the Habsburg monarchy to the Polish territories which they acquired, while most of Volhynia (including the city of Vladimir) remained as part of rump Poland until eventually being annexed in 1795 by the Russian Empire in the Third Partition of Poland - though the Habsburgs did receive the small city of Belz.\n\nLodomeria - together with Galicia - provided one of the many titles of the Emperor of Austria, \"the ruler of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria\". However, Lodomeria existed only on paper, had no territory and could not be found on any map.[2]"
