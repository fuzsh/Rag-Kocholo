        "text": "History of Galicia – Volhynia Kingdom\n\nGalicia – Volhynia Kingdom - Rurik dynasty’s principality - was created as a result of the unification of the Volhynia and Galicia principalities by Roman Mstislavich and existed from 1199 to 1392.\n\nThe principality pursued an active foreign policy in Eastern and Central Europe. The Kingdom of Poland, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Polovtsy were its main neighbors and competitors, as well as the Golden Horde and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania starting from the middle of the 13th century. To protect its territories, the Galicia – Volhynia kingdom repeatedly signed agreements with the Catholic Rome, the Holy Roman Empire and the Teutonic Order. At the same time, political, economic and cultural ties with other Russian lands weakened.\n\nGalicia – Volhynia kingdom of Kievan Rus’ fell into decay under the influence of a number of factors. After the simultaneous death of the princes Lev and Andrei Yuryevich (1323), the lands of the principality began to be seized by its neighbors - the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.\n\nCulture of Galicia – Volhynia Kingdom\n\nLittle is known about the architecture of the principality. Written sources describe mainly the churches. The visual arts of the principality were strongly influenced by the Byzantine. Galicia – Volhynia icons were especially valued in Western Europe, many of them ended up in Polish temples when the kingdom was the conquered."
