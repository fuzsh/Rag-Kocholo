        "text": "The cat’s-eye, while artistically attractive, is lacking in historical interest, and little can be gathered as to any romance of early history connected with it. However, I know from personal experience that the following tale is true, and so the good or evil effects of the stone must be judged on its own merits.\n\nA friend, deeply interested in all superstitions concerning jewels, said that her husband was one of those men who seem born with the proverbial golden spoon at hand to minister to their wants. Everything he touched turned to money: if he bought land, it inevitably happened to be a piece that some one must have immediately at any price asked, shares in companies rose fabulously, and he never failed to back the right horse!\n\nHe constantly speculated in mining ventures, and it was from a friend, who had been able, through “inside information” to sell at the critical moment and realise a tidy fortune, that he received the first scarf-pin which appears in this story. It was a round stone, set in very tiny but brilliant diamonds, and though her husband hated jewellery, he took to this pin, which he wore so constantly that it became quite a joke among his friends. Luck still came his way, and then — she could not quite remember the circumstance — he had another pin given to him, strangely enough, again a cat’s-eye, but of oval shape and not so brilliant as the first, and he seldom wore it. Again, several years passed, finally ending in his long, painful illness and death, at a comparatively early age, and the widow declared he had never been lucky since the second pin came into the house. Not that he was unlucky, but time after time, just at the point of success, presto! failure appeared, or, if not actual failure, impossibility of making a brilliant coup. Some of the real estate which had promised so well decreased alarmingly in value, and he was harassed by several lawsuits, his health failed unexpectedly, and with one thing and another it seemed as if the luck which had so conspicuously stood his friend was about to desert him. There were endless trivial details told in confirmation of the story.\n\nSome years after, the widow died, leaving no will, and the jewels came to the daughters, the elder of whom knew her mother’s superstition in regard to the oval cat’s-eye. Now, sad as it is to relate, this excellent family, like most other families, had its black sheep, in the person of the eldest son, who, with the eager assistance of a doting mother, had done his best to ruin the family, and had got hold of large sums of money to which he had not the slightest right, as they were the property of his brothers and sisters, and the patience of the family had long been exhausted.\n\nWe are all human, thank goodness! and therefore liable to err, but the sisters resolved to obey their mother’s oft-expressed wish, “that dear __ is to have his father’s cat’s-eye pin if anything happens to me.” They determined that he should, and, no size or shape being specified, he was sent, and duly acknowledged, the oval cat’s-eye, the round one being bestowed on the younger brother.\n\nNow this is an astonishing truth, but, since receiving that stone, he has gone from bad to worse. He has borrowed enormous sums at ruinous rates of interest, and is being sued on all sides by tradesmen, servants and employees whose bills he calmly ignores. He is in very bad health, and being hourly made a fool of by his wife, who is following in the footsteps of those gay ladies from whose ranks she was caught up and married by the young fool! Last of all, he is in the clutches of six shark-like and utterly unscrupulous lawyers, and the naughty brothers and sisters are watching with interest the end of the little drama. And here is the moral, for the young brother, with his round stone, is steadily going up in the world and seems to share the luck of his father — so, after all, there may be something in the influence of the two cat’s-eyes. Who knows?\n\nPeeps Into the Psychic World, M. MacDermot Crawford, 1915\n\nMrs Daffodil’s Aide-memoire: Mrs Daffodil does not generally believe in talismans or curses—she believes that the best curses are home-made—but is charmed by the ingenuity of the brothers and sisters in ridding themselves of a noxious sibling.\n\nFor a story of a cursed royal ring, see here. And see here, for a story of royal talismans, or here, for a haunted mummy necklace.\n\nMrs Daffodil invites you to join her on the curiously named “Face-book,” where you will find a feast of fashion hints, fads and fancies, and historical anecdotes\n\nYou may read about a sentimental succubus, a vengeful seamstress’s ghost, Victorian mourning gone horribly wrong, and, of course, Mrs Daffodil’s efficient tidying up after a distasteful decapitation in A Spot of Bother: Four Macabre Tales.\n\nHOODOO RING ADORNS IMAGE\n\nPut Away Because It Proved Fatal To Each Royal Possessor\n\nAt last the unlucky ring which has been the cause of so much superstition in the court of Spain has been placed by Queen Maria Christina in what she considers safe keeping, where the “evil eye” will have no more power over it. Attached to a golden chain, this valuable ring…can be seen hanging to the neck of the image of the virgin of the Almudena in the crypt for the future Cathedral, where the remains of the first wife of her late husband, Alfonso XII, will shortly be transferred from the Escorial.\n\nA well-known story is that of the Spanish opal; and many are the Spaniards who believe that the long series of misfortunes that has befallen Spain and the present dynasty comes of a cursed opal ring that a neglected beauty spitefully bestowed upon Alfonso XII. The opal is of a very large size and of brilliant colouring. It is set in filigree gold, and has no other jewels about it. The ring belonged to a famous beauty and adventuress, the Comtesse de Castiglione, who was in the glory of her beauty and power during the reign of Napoleon III. Among her most ardent admirers was Alfonso XII., then an outcast and a pretender. When he became King and married one of his own royal blood, the jealousy of the Comtesse was aroused, and her hatred was terrible. A few months after the King’s marriage he received a package from the Comtesse, containing a beautiful opal ring of rare colouring. It was called a wedding-gift and a memento of the friendship the King had held for the Comtesse. The King showed it to his wife Queen Mercedes, who was charmed with its beauty and begged to keep it. Alfonso gave it to her readily, and she slipped it on her finger. From that moment she commenced to ail, and in a few months she died. The ring fell from her dead hand, and the King gave it to his grandmother Queen Christina, who died a few months later. Next, the ring was given to Alfonso’s sister the Infanta Maria del Pilar, who wore it but a few days before she died of a mysterious sickness. The sister-in-law then came into possession of it, the youngest daughter of the Duc and Duchesse de Montpensier, and in three months the young Princess was dead. After this series of fatalities the King determined to keep the ring himself, and he slipped it on his little finger [other accounts say he put it into his jewelry box with his cuff-links and studs]; but he did not wear it long, as his unhappy life shortly came to an end.\n\nThe Power of Gems and Charms, George H. Bratley, 1907\n\nQueen Maria Christina, widow of Alfonso XII had heard from the King himself how unlucky the ring was, and when she found it among his jewels she decided that no one should wear it; and when the Cathedral showed signs of being the future Cathedral of Madrid, she decided to put an end to the legend of the unlucky ring by hanging it to the Virgin’s neck.\n\nPerhaps if the unlucky ring had been given to the present Queen of Spain [Victoria Eugenie, wife of Alfonso XIII] she would wear it. She does not believe in the “evil eye,” and she adores jewels. She is never seen, even in the most simple attire, without earrings, pearl chain, &c., quite a contrast to her grandmother Queen Victoria, who went most simply attired except on great occasions. Cincinnati [OH] Enquirer 8 July 1913: p. 4\n\nMrs Daffodil’s Aide-memoire: A few more details on this ring which brought appallingly bad luck to all its owners. The article above says that it had been the property of the fascinating and beautiful Countess de Castiglione, mistress of Napoleon III and she of the infamous Queen of Hearts fancy dress costume, of semi-transparent fabric, worn with a large jewelled heart on the girdle. Empress Eugenie (who was notoriously superstitious about opals) remarked of this accessory: Quels beaux bijoux, metis le coeur est place bien bas. It was said of the Countess that while she had a heart, it was mostly kept at her banker’s.\n\nThe sister-in-law mentioned above was Infanta Maria Cristina de Orléans, sister to the late Queen Mercedes. She and the King became engaged shortly after the Queen’s death from typhoid fever (after only 5 months of marriage) in 1878. However, the Infanta contracted tuberculosis and died before they could be wed. King Alfonso XII next married Maria Christina of Austria in 1879. He died of dysentery in 1885, just before his 28th birthday. His posthumous son, later King Alfonso XIII (who lost his throne to the Second Spanish Republic), was born in May 1886. The most recent photogravures of the statue of the Virgin and Child in Madrid’s Almudena Cathedral do not appear to show the necklace. Mrs Daffodil is struck both by the extraordinarily rapid succession of royal fiancées/wives and the apparent hygienic deficiencies of the royal residences.\n\nMrs Daffodil invites you to join her on the curiously named “Face-book,” where you will find a feast of fashion hints, fads and fancies, and historical anecdotes\n\nYou may read about a sentimental succubus, a vengeful seamstress’s ghost, Victorian mourning gone horribly wrong, and, of course, Mrs Daffodil’s efficient tidying up after a distasteful decapitation in A Spot of Bother: Four Macabre Tales."
