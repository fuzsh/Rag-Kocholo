        "text": "MADRID, Feb. 3 (Reuters)—Prince Alfonso of BourbonSicily died here tonight at the age of 62. The Prince, a nephew of the late King Alfonso XIII of Spain, underwent an operation last week.\n\nPrince Alfonso, a son of Prince Charles of Bourbon‐Sicily and the Infanta Maria, eldest sister of King Alfonso, was a cavalry officer.\n\nIn 1927 it was reported that the Spanish National Consulative Assembly would adopt a provision giving the Spanish National Council the right to\n\npick the heir to the throne, and that Prince Alfonso would be favored rather than the King's four sons, who were not considered physically fit.\n\nIn 1930, Gen. Primo de Rivera, the dictator who had convened the Consulative Assembly, was forced to resign. King Alfonso, whom he had protected, was outlawed in the Republican electoral victory of 1931. Thus the question of a successor became academic.\n\nPrince Alfonso married Princess Alice of Bourbon‐Parma in 1936 in Vienna. His full title was His Royal Highness the Infant Alphonso Maria of Spain, Knight of the Golden Fleece."
