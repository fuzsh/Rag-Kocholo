The Habsburgs were relatively finicky about equal status, and with the exception of Bavaria, all the girls married German princes of relatively lesser status (Parma doesn't count, since AFAIK morganatic matches don't affect them) who would be only too glad to get a Habsburg archduchess for a wife.\n\nI find it hard to believe that Sophie Chotek was a lower match for FF but one of Isabella (who was the daughter of a Croy and a Ligne) and Friedrich's daughters is fine.
