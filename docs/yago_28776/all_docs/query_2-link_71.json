        "text": "Spanish-Philippines\n\nReign of Queen Isabella II\n\n1854  1864\n\nNigel Gooding Collection\n\nThe Issued Stamps and Their Forgeries\n\nThe Philippines holds the distinction of being the first country in Asia to produce postage stamps for use across the Islands, with the first set issued on February 1, 1854. This Spanish-Philippine collection focuses on stamps and covers issued during the reign of Queen Isabella II. Eleven separate issues, with a total of 22 different stamps, were produced over an eleven year period. All stamps profile Isabella's portrait in a multitude of different designs.\n\nThis collection also focuses on the extensive array of forgeries which plagued every issue prepared during Isabella's reign  just over five times the number of genuine stamps issued. Out of a total of 116 different forgeries recorded to date, 112 of these forgeries are included in this collection, making it the most comprehensive assemblage of forgeries recorded from this period.\n\nOutline and Key Features of the Collection\n\nThis collection is arranged in chronological order of stamp issues. These issues are represented by unused and used stamps, multiples and covers. Additionally, the forgeries produced for each issue, including those by such well known forgers as Jean de Sperati, Engelhardt Fohl, Oswald Schrőder, Senf Brothers, and Miguel Sequi are illustrated immediately thereafter to demonstrate not only the very well made and dangerous forgeries which have seriously confounded and troubled collectors over the years, but also those poorly made forgeries which were obviously not genuine issues, but which nonetheless caused concerns, in some instances, for less experienced collectors. The collection includes a number of die proofs and forgeries in largest recorded multiples.\n\nQueen Isabella II of Spain\n\nReign Between September 29, 1833 and September 30, 1868\n\nIsabella was born in Madrid on October 10, 1830. She was the eldest daughter of King Ferdinand VII and his fourth wife, Maria Cristina, a Neapolitan Bourbon. Maria Cristina became Queen-Regent on September 29, 1833, when her daughter Isabella, at the age of three years, was proclaimed queen on the death of her father.\n\nQueen Isabella II succeeded to the throne as a result of King Ferdinand VII inducing the Spanish Cortes to assist him in setting aside the Spanish Salic law of Philip V, introduced by the Bourbons in the early 18th century, which declared that only the male line should succeed to the Spanish throne. Instead, he convinced the Spanish Cortes to re-establish the older succession law of Spain, allowing Isabella II rightful succession to the throne.\n\nThis change meant that Carlos V, the brother of King Ferdinand VII, was denounced as king and became the Pretender. Don Carlos disputed Isabella's right to succeed to the throne and her accession precipitated seven years of civil war. During this time, Don Carlos, with the help of the Holy See, Austria, Russia, Prussia and the Italian Kingdoms organised a coalition aimed at seizing power. Civil war dragged on until August 31, 1839, when the Agreement of Vergara, ratified between General Baldomero Esparto and the Carlist General Rafael Maroto was put into effect, whereby Isabella II was recognised as Queen of Spain.\n\nIsabellas rights were only maintained through the support of the army, the Cortes and the Liberals and Progressists, who at the same time established constitutional and parliamentary government, dissolved the religious orders, confiscated the property of the orders including the Jesuits, and attempted to restore order in finances.\n\nMaria Cristina remained Queen-Regent until a secret marriage to an ex-sergeant from the royal guard, Don Fernando Muñoz, which took place on December 28, 1833, shortly after the death of the king, became public knowledge. The Queen-Regents position was undermined by news of her re-marriage and concerns that Maria Cristina was not actually supportive of her liberal ministers and their policies. Eventually, the army, which was the backbone of Isabella IIs support, and the liberal leadership in the Cortes combined to demand that Maria Cristina stand aside from her Regency, where she was forced to leave Spain. On October 12, 1840, the most successful and most popular general of the Isabelline armies, General Baldomero Espartero, replaced her as Regent.\n\nA military revolt was instigated by Maria Cristina from exile in Paris, supported by noted generals, started on September 27, 1841 and continued with a serious rebellion a year later with bombardment of Barcelona. In May 1843, Espartero was turned out by a military and political pronunciamiento, led by Generals Leopoldo ODonnell and Ramón María Narvaez, who formed a cabinet, presided over by Joaquin Maria Lopez. This government induced the Cortes to declare Isabella, who at the time was thirteen, of age to rule Spain. On November 10, 1843, she swore loyalty to the Constitution and began her personal rule as Queen Isabella II. After an unsuccessful attempt to return to power, Maria Cristina retired permanently to exile in France after 1844.\n\nThe Queen, at age sixteen, was married on October 10, 1846 to her cousin, Francisco de Asis de Borbon (Duke of Cadiz), then twenty-four years of age. The King Consort was not of Isabellas own choice nor her liking and in fact lived mainly separate from him. The Queen was believed to have had a constant string of lovers, most notably her Prime Ministers.\n\nThe period of Isabella's personal rule (1843-1868) was characterized by political unrest and a series of uprisings. She showed most favour to her reactionary generals and statesmen, to the Church and religious orders, and was constantly the tool of corrupt and profligate courtiers and favourites who gave her Court a bad name. Her government was dominated by military politicians, most notably General Ramón María Narváez and the somewhat more liberal General Leopoldo O'Donnell. Liberal opposition to the regime's authoritarianism became increasingly directed at the Queen. Scandalous reports on the private conduct of Isabella, as well as her arbitrary political interference, further damaged the monarchical cause. The abortive uprising of 1866, and the deaths of O'Donnell (1867) and Narváez (1868), weakened her position further, and gave wide support to the military rising against Isabella. Her Moderado generals had made a slight show of resistance that was crushed at the battle of Alcolea by Marshals Serrano and Prim. On September 30, 1868, at the age of thirty-seven, Isabella was forced from her throne and joined her mother in exile in France.\n\nIsabella was persuaded to abdicate her throne in Paris on June 25, 1870 in favour of her eldest surviving son, Alfonso XII. She returned to Spain for a time after King Alfonso XII's accession in 1874 but was unsuccessful in influencing political affairs, returning to Paris, where she resided for the rest of her life, seldom travelling abroad except for a few visits to Spain. During her exile she grew closer to her husband, with whom she maintained an ambiguous friendship until his death in 1902. She died on April 10, 1904, aged seventy-three, and is entombed in El Escorial in Madrid."
