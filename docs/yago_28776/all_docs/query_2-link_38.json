        "text": "On 4 May 1898, Lord Salisbury gave a controversial speech dividing ‘the nations of the world as the living and the dying’.Footnote 1 The former were those great countries ‘growing in power every year, growing in wealth, dominion, and the perfection of their organization’, whereas the latter were states characterised by disorganisation, decay, misgovernment and corruption. ‘Decade after decade,’ he said, ‘they are weaker, poorer, and less provided with leading men or institutions in which they can trust.’ In his opinion, ‘the inevitable result’ was quite obvious. Amidst his colleagues’ laughter and cheers, he stated, ‘the living nations will gradually encroach on the territory of the dying’. Thus, they would cure or cut up ‘these unfortunate patients’, removing ‘desolation and sterility by means of this aggrandisement’. Nobody was unaware that the prime minister was alluding to Spain.Footnote 2 Just a fortnight earlier, US ships had attacked Spanish possessions in America and Asia to consummate its ‘manifest destiny’.\n\nThat conflict exposed the definitive retreat of Spain to second-class power status,Footnote 3 but it also confirmed the end of an era when sovereigns claimed the right to play a leading diplomatic role. As monarchs throughout the century had done, Maria Cristina of Habsburg–Lorraine promptly corresponded with her royal cousins to request their support. The Spanish queen regent thus invoked a sort of monarchic, supranational fraternity to oppose the republican United States. Months before the war broke out, in 1898, she wrote to Queen Victoria ‘to expose my complicated situation’ to her but also to seek ‘her powerful support and great advice’.Footnote 4 Maria Cristina went into all the outrages committed by the United States in financing the Cuban independence fighters to provoke a war and exclaimed, ‘I can no longer allow my country to be humiliated.’ Appealing for peacekeeping, she begged Victoria ‘not to deny me her powerful protection’. Victoria's response foreshadowed the kind of tensions her grandson, George V, would be exposed to sixteen years later. After consulting her government, Victoria responded in terms of the strictest neutrality. However, in her journal, she wrote: ‘it is monstrous of America’.Footnote 5 Informal contacts between monarchs might continue, but their personal preferences were already outweighed by state interest.\n\nIn 1898, Spain was reduced to a ‘dying nation’, a lesser and decayed country that had lost its former powerful international presence. However, the same certainly did not apply to its monarchy and dynasty.Footnote 6 The Bourbons restoration in 1874 succeeded in stabilising the Spanish monarchy with the explicit support of other European sovereigns.Footnote 7 Fears, after the Paris Commune, of revolutionary excesses and the republic undoubtedly helped. The Spanish monarchy now participated as one of the cosmopolitan European royal families in a way that had never been seen before. In 1906, Alfonso XIII actually married Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, one of Queen Victoria's most cherished granddaughters. This was far from the previous image of the Bourbon monarchy. In 1857, Victoria and Albert urged the young newly crowned Pedro V of Portugal to marry, avoiding especially the Bourbons. In their opinion, the dynasty ‘had not only a simple education’, but ‘it was also corrupted by the Court's incest’.Footnote 8 Four years later, Albert again advised him not to marry a Spanish princess. Her blood, he claimed, ‘promised little spiritual, moral, and physical health’.Footnote 9 The Neapolitan branch of the family was not spared censure either. In 1857, Pedro wrote to the Portuguese ambassador in London discussing possible marriage alliances for his sister. In his opinion, they had to reject the proposal of the duke of Calabria because ‘it would make us, through the bond of kinship, partners in the intrigues that fly from Naples to Madrid and from Madrid to Naples’.Footnote 10 Political reasons strongly discouraged the match. As he wrote, ‘we are one of the few princes who have accepted the representative regime wisely and sincerely’, while the Bourbons ‘represent diametrically opposed principles’. Their counterpoint was ‘the house of Savoy which, since 1848, has given highly regarded proof of its adherence to the constitutional regime’.Footnote 11"
