        "text": "On December 1, 1874, Alfonso issued the Sandhurst Manifesto, where he set the ideological basis of the Bourbon Restoration. It was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy.\n\nAt the end of 1874, Brigadier Martínez Campos, who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to Sagunto, rallied the troops sent against him to his own flag, and entered Valencia in the king’s name.\n\nThereupon the President resigned, and his power was transferred to the king’s plenipotentiary and adviser, Cánovas. The December 29, 1874 military coup of Gen. Martinez Campos in Sagunto ended the failed republic and meant the rise of the young Prince Alfonso.\n\nWithin a few days after Canovas del Castillo took power as Premier, the new king, proclaimed on December 29, 1874, arrived at Madrid, passing through Barcelona and Valencia and was acclaimed everywhere (1875). In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the Carlists, in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of Don Carlos and the Duke’s abandonment of the struggle.\n\nInitially led by Canovas del Castillo as moderate prime minister, what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political-administrative positions of power, in reality ushered in a civilian regime that lasted until Primo de Rivera’s 1923 coup d’état. Cánovas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration.\n\nIn order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of Isabel II, the single party and its destabilizing consequences, the Liberal Party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics, and the ‘turnismo’ or alternation was to become the new system. Turnismo would be endorsed in the Constitution of 1876 and the Pact of El Pardo (1885). It meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles.\n\nThis led to the end of the Carlist revolts and the victory over the New York-backed Cuban revolutionaries, and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso. His government continued the operations of the Ministry for Overseas Affairs which began under his mother’s reign.\n\nThe ministry was responsible for the theft of indigenous human remains and artifacts throughout colonized lands from 1863 to 1899. To this day, the majority of the stolen bodies of indigenous peoples, some still displayed in Spanish museums, have yet to be returned to their ancestral lands.\n\nAlfonso XII’s short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of Spain after the 1808–1874 crisis. Both European (the coastal regions, such as the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Asturias) and Overseas – Antilles and Pacific were able to grow steadily.\n\nCuba and Puerto Rico prospered to the point that Spain’s first train was between Havana and Camagüey, and the first telegraph in Latin America was in Puerto Rico, established by Samuel Morse, whose daughter lived there with her husband. Upon the American invasion of Puerto Rico, ten US dollars were needed to buy one Puerto Rican peso.\n\nFirst marriage\n\nOn January 23, 1878 at the Basilica of Atocha in Madrid, the 22 year old Alfonso XII married his 17 year old first cousin, Princess María de las Mercedes of Orléans.\n\nPrincess María de las Mercedes of Orléans (June 24, 1860 – June 26, 1878) was the daughter of Prince Antoine of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier, the youngest son of King Louis Philippe of France and his wife Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain the younger sister of Alfonso XII’s mother, Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nAlthough Mercedes was patrilineally a French princess, she was also a Spanish infanta and spent the first eight years of her life in Spain.\n\nShortly after their honeymoon, it became evident that Queen Mercedes suffered from typhoid fever. The marriage would last only six months, during which she reportedly had a miscarriage. She died due to the fever on June 26, 1878, at 18 years old.\n\nSecond marriage and rule\n\nOn 29 November 1879 at the Basilica of Atocha in Madrid, Alfonso married his double third cousin, Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria, daughter of Archduke Charles Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria.\n\nDuring the honeymoon, a pastry cook named Otero fired at the young sovereign and his wife as they were driving in Madrid.\n\nThe children of this marriage were:\n\n1. María de las Mercedes, Princess of Asturias, (1880 – 1904), titular heir from the death of her father until the posthumous birth of her brother.\n\n2. María Teresa, (1882 – 1912),\n\n3. Alfonso XIII (1886 – 1941). Born posthumously.\n\nAlfonso XII had two sons by Elena Armanda Nicolasa Sanz y Martínez de Arizala (1849 – 1898):\n\n1. Alfonso Sanz y Martínez de Arizala (1880 – 1970)\n\n2. Fernando Sanz y Martínez de Arizala (1881– 1925)\n\nIn 1881 Alfonso XII refused to sanction a law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of 18 months. Upon the consequent resignation of Canovas del Castillo, he summoned Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, the Liberal leader, to form a new cabinet.\n\nDeath and impact\n\nOn November 25, 1885, Alfonso XII died, just three days short of his 28th birthday, at the Royal Palace of El Pardo near Madrid. He had been suffering from tuberculosis, but the immediate cause of his death was a recurrence of dysentery.\n\nSuccession\n\nThe marriage of King Alfonso XII and Archduchess Maria Christina was unhappy. Alfonso had married Maria Christina in order to secure the succession to the throne. He did not love his wife and was disappointed after she gave birth to two daughters, while he already had two extramarital sons. In July 1883, Maria Christina left the Spanish court and traveled with her daughters to visit her own family in Austria.\n\nBy the summer of 1884, Alfonso XII’s health had deteriorated and he had tuberculosis. After a brief improvement, the 27-year-old king died on November 25, 1885, leaving behind the widowed Queen Maria Christina who was three months pregnant.\n\nAt the death of King Alfonso XII his heir was his eldest daughter InfantavMaría de las Mercedes (September 11, 1880 – October 17, 1904) She was Princess of Asturias, the heir presumptive to the Crown of Spain, for all 24 years of her life.\n\nMercedes was not declared queen upon the death of her father because she would be displaced if a son was born, or had the pregnancy been lost. However had the pregnancy or resulted in another daughter, Mercedes would have become queen regnant and been retroactively recognized as such during the interregnum.\n\nThe sibling proved to be a boy, Alfonso XIII, and on his birth in 1886, Mercedes turned out not to be queen.\n\nHis successor King Alfonso XIII was born at Royal Palace of Madrid on May 17, 1886. He was the posthumous son of Alfonso XII of Spain and became King upon his birth. Just after he was born, he was carried naked to the prime minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta on a silver tray.\n\nThe infant King’s sister, Infanta María de las Mercedes\n\nresumed the position of heir presumptive, which she held until her own death in October 1904 at the tender age of 24.\n\nMaría de las Mercedes had married in Madrid on February 14, 1901, her second cousin, Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a nephew of King Francesco II of the then-defunct Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, who was elevated to the rank of Infante of Spain. The marriage was highly controversial due to her father-in-law’s ties with the Carlists.\n\nAfter the death of María de las Mercedes in 1904 she was succeeded as heir to the Spanish throne by her own infant son, Prince Alfonso of the Bourbon-Two-Sicilies, because Alfonso XIII having not yet married and fathered a legitimate child.\n\nKing Alfonso XII of Spain\n\nIn examining the lineage of King Alfonso XII of Spain I mentioned that most of us commoners have eight unrelated great-grandparents. Alfonso XII only had four great-grandparents, and even then they were all from the House of Bourbon. These four individuals were his paternal great-grandparents as we have seen:\n\nCarlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies and his his first cousin María Isabel of Spain\n\nIn examining his maternal great-grandparents we find these same four individuals:\n\nCarlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies and his his first cousin María Isabel of Spain\n\nThe difference of course is in who their children were and whom they were married to. For example, paternally Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma had Infante Francisco de Paula, Duke of Cádiz who married his niece Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies daughter of Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabel of Spain.\n\nHowever, on Alfonso XII’s maternal side, Carlos IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma had King Fernando VII of Spain who married, as his fourth wife his, niece Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, (her mother wife, Maria Isabella of Spain’s older brother).\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies\n\nTherefore, maternally, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, parents were of Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabel of Spain.\n\nThis means that these two sisters of the House of Bourbon-Two Siclies (below) each married their uncles (who were brothers) of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon.\n\n* Luisa Carlotta (1804–1844), who married her mother’s younger brother Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain.\n\n* María Cristina (1806–1878), who married firstly her uncle Ferdinand VII of Spain (her mother’s older brother);\n\nThey were King Alfonso XII’s grand parents.\n\nHis paternal grand parents were Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies and they were the parents of King Alfonso XII’s father…Infante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz.\n\nFrancisco married Queen Isabella II of Spain, his double first cousin, on October 10, 1846. There is evidence that Isabella would rather have married his younger brother, Infante Enrique, Duke of Seville, and complained bitterly about her husband’s effeminate habits after their first night together.\n\nInfante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz\n\nAlfonso XII’s maternal grandparents (his maternal side is where he derived his claim to the throne) were King Fernando VII of Spain Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies and they were the parents of his mother, Queen Isabella II of Spain.\n\nIsabella II, was Queen of Spain from 1833 until 1868. She came to the throne as an infant, but her succession was disputed by the Carlists, whose refusal to recognize a female sovereign led to the Carlist Wars. After a troubled reign, she was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1868, and formally abdicated in 1870. Her son, Alfonso XII, became king in 1874.\n\nIsabella II, was Queen of Spain\n\nWith Alfonso XII being the result of multiple first cousin marriages and two uncle-niece unions, he should have been as inbred as his predecessor King Carlos II of Spain. The fact that Alfonso XII did not suffer from the curse of inbreeding like Carlos II has given rise to the speculation that Infante Francisco de Asís, Duke of Cádiz was not the real father of King Alfonso XII. That will be the topic of the next post on the lineage of King Alfonso XII.\n\nI did a post many years ago about the lineage of Carlos II of Spain and how inbreeding resulted in his physical and mental state. Unable to father any children with his two wives, this resulted in the Spanish Habsburg Dynasty being replaced by a branch of the French Bourbon Dynasty, with Philippe, Duke of Anjou, a grandson of King Louis XIV of France (also a great grandson of Felipe IV of Spain) who became the first Spanish king of the House of Bourbon as King Felipe V. Felipe V’s accession provoked the 13-year War of the Spanish Succession, which continued until the Treaty of Utrecht forbade any future possibility of unifying the French and Spanish crowns while confirming his accession to the throne of Spain.\n\nAlfonso XII of Spain\n\nFelipe V was King of Spain from November 1, 1700 to his abdication in favour of his son Luis on January 14, 1724, and from his reaccession of the throne upon his son’s death, September 6, 1724 to his own death on July 9, 1746. The sum of his two reigns, 45 years and 21 days, is the longest in modern Spanish history.\n\nAlthough the Spanish Bourbons didn’t intermarry at first, once this branch obtained the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily (later the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies) and the Duchy of Parma, along with Spain, they then began inbreeding at an alarming rate.\n\nOne of the members of the Spanish Bourbons who seems to be as inbred as Carlos II was King Alfonso XII of Spain. If you look at Alfonso XII’s official genealogy it’s very startling. Most of us commoners have eight unrelated great-grandparents. Alfonso XII only had four great-grandparents, and even then they were all from the House of Bourbon. Let’s dissect this.\n\nI will begin with Alfonso XII’s first set of four paternal great-grandparents. His first paternal great-grandfather was Carlos IV of Spain, who’s father and mother were King Carlos III of Spain, Naples and Sicily and his wife Maria Amalia of Saxony.\n\nCarlos IV of Spain\n\nMaria Louisa of Parma\n\nCarlos IV of Spain married his first cousin Maria Luisa of Parma in 1765. Maria Luisa of Parma was the youngest daughter of Felipe of Spain Duke of Parma (also a son of Carlos III of Spain) and his wife Louise Élisabeth of France. This makes Maria Luisa of Parma Alfonso XII’s paternal great-grandmother. Therefore, the father of Carlos IV of Spain and the father of his wife, Marie Louise of Parma, were brothers, Carlos III of Spain, and Felipe of Spain, Duke of Parma, respectively.\n\nCarlos IV and Maria Louisa had three children that were ancestors of Alfonso XII. The only one we’re concerned with at this moment is Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain, their youngest son.\n\nAlfonso XII’s next paternal great-grandfather was Francesco I of the Two Sicilies and his his first cousin María Isabel of Spain the daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain. Francesco I was the son of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies who himself was the son of King Carlos III of Spain, Naples and Sicily. Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies was the younger brother of Carlos IV of Spain.\n\nCarlos III was granted the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily after his father, Felipe V conquered the two kingdoms in 1734. His elder half-brother, Fernando VI of Spain, died in 1759 without an heir so Carlos succeeded as King of Spain. Naples and Sicily went to his second son, Infante Ferdinand, and Carlos III’s eldest son became Carlos IV of Spain. On March 8, 1816 Ferdinand merged the thrones of Sicily and Naples into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. This created the Bourbon-Two Siclies branch of the Spanish Bourbons.\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies and his first cousin María Isabel of Spain, the youngest daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. had many children and the one that concerns us here at this moment is Infanta Louisa Carlotta, Princess of the Two Sicilies.\n\nFrancesco I of the Two Sicilies\n\nMaría Isabel of Spain\n\nOn June 12, 1819 in Madrid, Luisa Carlotta married Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain, the youngest son of King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma. This meant Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain was his wife’s maternal uncle. He was ten years older than Luisa Carlotta.\n\nInfante Francisco de Paula of Spain and his wife Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies were the paternal grandparents of King Alfonso XII of Spain. Their son, Infante Francisco de Asís Duke of Cádiz, was the father of King Alfonso XII.\n\nThis completes Alfonso XII’s paternal ancestry. Coming soon is his maternal ancestry.\n\nBelow is a simplified chart of his paternal ancestry.\n\nOne of the more notable royals with questionable parentage was King Alfonso XII of Spain. Alfonso was born in Madrid as the eldest son of Queen Isabella II. Officially, his father was her husband, Infante Francisco de Bourbon, Duke of Cadiz. The Duke of Cadiz was given the title of King Consort, one of the few in history, upon his marriage to his double first cousin, Queen Isabella II of Spain, on October 10, 1846. There is evidence that Isabella desired to marry the Duke of Cadiz’ younger brother, Infante Enrique de Bourbon, Duke of Seville. Shortly after their wedding night Queen Isabella II bitterly complained about her husband’s effeminate habits and mannerisms.\n\nThese facts had lead to considerable speculation that some or all of Isabella’s children were not fathered by Francisco; this speculation has been bolstered by rumors that Francisco was either homosexual or physically unable to complete the sex act. With Alfonso XII’s biological paternity uncertain, there has been speculation that his biological father may have been Enrique Puigmoltó y Mayans (a captain of the guard). This rumor was put forth by the Carlists as part of their propaganda against the queen.\n\nLet provide some background on Carlism. In 1701 the French Bourbon prince, Philippe, Duc d’Anjou, grandson of France’s king, Louis XIV, inherited the Spanish throne. What the new King Felipe V brought with him to Spain was the ancient Salic Law which barred woman from inheriting the throne as well as passing along succession rights. This law was foreign to the Spaniards because there had been many queen regnants in Spain prior to the accession of the House of Bourbon. This law was not tested in Spain because between the reigns of Felipe V and Fernando VII each monarch successfully produced a male heir.\n\nKing Fernando VII, despite multiple marriages, had not fathered a male heir and this lead to a succession crisis in 1833 with the Salic Law being rescinded in Spain. In 1827 King Fernando VII’s third wife, Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, died. This forced the aging king into a hasty fourth marriage in order to father a male heir. His bride was Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The awkwardness of this union was that not only were they cousins multiple times over, King Fernando VII was also her uncle by both birth and marriage. Maria Christina’s mother, Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain, was King Fernando VII’s sister; both were born to King Carlos IV of Spain and his wife, Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma. Fernando VII did, however, have two daughters, with Infanta Isabella being the eldest and Infanta Luisa Fernanda being the youngest.\n\nWhen Fernando VII lay dying his queen had him set aside the Salic Law, which thus made their young daughter succeed him as Queen Isabella II upon his death. Under the old Salic Law the late King Fernando VII’s brother, Don Carlos, Duke of Molina, was heir to the throne instead of any female. Don Carlos revolted and proclaimed he was the legitimate and rightful king and styled himself King Carlos V of Spain. Needing support, Queen Maria Christina (acting as Regent for her daughter) turned to the liberals. She issued a decree of amnesty on October 23, 1833. Liberals, who had been in exile, returned and dominated Spanish politics for decades. The liberals threw their support behind Isabella II and the Carlist Wars resulted. It was in this context that the rumors began flooding in years later that the future Alfonso XII was not fathered by Francisco, Duke of Cadiz, the legitimate husband of Queen Isabella II.\n\nAfter a tumultuous reign, Isabella II and her husband went into exile with his wife in France in 1868 and adopted the incognito title of Count of Moratalla. In 1870 Francisco and Isabella were amicably separated but in time they actually became good friends. This friendship, which they had certainly not been while she was Queen regnant, was new. The 1874 restoration placed his son Alfonso XII on the throne.\n\nSo was Alfonso XII really fathered by Francisco, Duke of Cadiz, or was he really fathered by Enrique Puigmoltó y Mayans, or was this merely a rumor spread by Carlist enemies? From what I understand after reading about this issue from many historians is that the evidence does seem to point to the Duke of Cadiz being a homosexual and although that doesn’t rule out the possibility he could be the father of Alfonso XII, but given the fact that the promiscuity of Isabella II is also well documented, it is reasonable to doubt that Alfonso XII was really fathered by Francisco, Duke of Cadiz."
