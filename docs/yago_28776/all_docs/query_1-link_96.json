        "meta_description": "Oct 5, 2015 - Archduchess Maria Christina Johanna Josepha Antonia of Austria, known to her family as ‘Mimi’. She was the fifth child and fourth daughter of the Empress Maria Theresa and her consort Franz Stephen.\n\nMimi was born on her mother’s twenty fifth birthday, 13th May 1742, a fact that almost certainly contributed to the fact that she was to be Maria Theresa’s favourite child, with the Empress believing her to be the one who was most like herself in every way.\n.
