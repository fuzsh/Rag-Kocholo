        "text": "Maria Christina of Austria (1742-1798) was an Austrian princess, daughter of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and Emperor Francis I. Born in Vienna, Maria Christina, affectionately known as \"Mimi\" by her family, was one of the sixteen children of the imperial couple and one of her mother Maria Theresa's favorites.\n\nMaria Christina was distinguished by her intelligence, beauty, and artistic talent. She was a talented amateur painter, studied under renowned masters, and developed a refined taste for art. Unlike her sisters, who were often involved in political marriages, Maria Christina had the rare fortune of marrying for love. In 1766, she married Duke Albert of Saxony-Teschen, governor of the Austrian Netherlands. The marriage was a happy union, and the couple shared common interests, especially in art and culture.\n\nThe couple resided in Brussels until the French invasion of the Austrian Netherlands, after which they moved to Vienna. There, Maria Christina and Albert founded the Albertina, one of the world's most important collections of graphic art, housing works by DÃ¼rer, Rubens, and many other masters.\n\nMaria Christina was very close to her family, but her life was marked by personal tragedy. Despite their happy marriage, their attempts to have children were unsuccessful, and the couple had no descendants. Her health declined in her later years, and she died in 1798 in Vienna.\n\nMaria Christina is remembered for her intelligence, artistic talent, and her role as a patron of the arts. Her art collection, the Albertina, remains a lasting testament to her love for culture and art, solidifying her significant contribution to European cultural heritage."
