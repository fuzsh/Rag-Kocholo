        "text": "“By mutual agreement we have decided to break off our marriage. Our commitment to our children remains intact. Since this is a private decision, we ask the utmost respect of all those around us,” as the two jointly announced in a statement, according to The Times.\n\nWhile Princess Cristina is distancing herself from the separation news, here we take a look back at her roller coaster life that has seen embezzlement, divorce and becoming a royal outcast.\n\nHer ex-husband’s embezzlement case\n\nIn 2018, Urdangarin, an Olympic handball bronze medallist, was found guilty of tax fraud, embezzlement and influence peddling for money laundering over six million euros (US$7.06 million) siphoned through his non-profit organisation, the Noos Institute in Majorca.\n\nAccording to his case’s prosecutor, Urdangarin used his family ties with the royal family to score sports-related public contracts, overcharged for events, and hid the money abroad between the years 2004 and 2006.\n\nHowever, last June, he was put on day release that allowed him to leave the prison and work as a consultant in an accounting firm.\n\nThe highly controversial case split the Spanish royal family and was believed to be one of the reasons behind King Juan Carlos’ abdication in 2014.\n\nThe princess was charged then acquitted\n\nPrincess Cristina was also charged with tax fraud as part of the embezzlement scheme involving her husband and 16 other defendants, but was acquitted in the case after the court found her not guilty. However, she was ordered to pay a 265,000 euro (US$300,000) fine as a beneficiary of her husband’s scheme.\n\nAfter the allegations first came about in 2012, the 56-year-old matriarch and her then-husband relocated with their four children to Geneva. She reportedly still lives in Switzerland with her younger children.\n\nShe is no longer a duchess\n\nThe younger daughter of former King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia of Spain was stripped of her title by her brother, the reigning King Felipe VI of Spain, after she went on trial charged with tax evasion in 2015.\n\nShe was granted the Duchess of Palma title when she tied the knot with Urdangarin, but during the trial she asked her brother to remove it, according to her lawyer’s report. However, the palace then issued a statement saying that the king had made the decision before her letter arrived.\n\nPrincess Cristina is sixth in line of succession to the throne and was the first Spanish royal family member ordered to stand on trial.\n\nShe divorced her husband of 24 years\n\nThe announcement came after Spanish tabloid Lecturas reported on Urdangarin’s affair. The newspaper published several photos of him holding hands with an unnamed woman, who was later revealed as his colleague, in southern France.\n\nWhen asked about the alleged affair, Urdangarin told reporters that, “These things happen. It is a difficulty that we will manage with the utmost tranquillity and together as we have always done.”\n\nAccording to a source from ¡Hola! magazine, the princess was not “surprised” by the photograph and “she already knew”.\n\nThe estranged couple were last seen together just last month enjoying a family holiday in Baqueira Beret, as reported by the same publication.\n\nThey met at the Olympics and had a lavish wedding\n\nInfanta Cristina de Borbón, as she is known in Spain, met Urdangarin at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games where he was a bronze medal winner in handball. The two were married a year later in Barcelona. During their lavish wedding, she wore a beautiful wedding gown designed by Lorenzo Caprile with a princess line silhouette, an off-the-shoulder neckline and an embroidered silver detail sitting at the waistline. Her wedding dress also had a three-metre train and a lace veil that was once worn by her great grandmother, Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain.\n\nHowever, the stand out piece of her ensemble was the historic Spanish Floral Tiara that was commissioned by Alfonso XII from British jewellers J.P. Collins in 1879 as a wedding gift for his second wife Maria Christina of Austria. The diamond tiara is set in a gold and silver floral motif and is also convertible, as it can be worn as a necklace and a brooch.\n\nThe princess and Urdangarin relocated to Washington in 2009 before moving back to Barcelona in 2012 where they lived in a six-million-euro mansion."
