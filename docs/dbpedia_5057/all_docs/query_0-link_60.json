        "text": "About Us\n\nTribute Film Classics was created with a mission to record deserved scores in complete renditions - including music that may have been omitted or edited in the final film - that have been either ignored or survive in less than pristine condition. The label is dedicated to the preservation of classic film scores, and our goal is to create a collection of new recordings that we hope will perpetuate the specialized art of film composition.\n\nWILLIAM T. STROMBERG - Grammy nominated conductor William Stromberg has composed and conducted music for many films, including the documentary Trinity and Beyond, Starship Troopers 2, Bugs and Army of the Dead for the Sci-Fi Channel, and most recently the documentary film The Battle of Bunker Hill. He has conducted and orchestrated regularly for many Hollywood composers such as Rolfe Kent, Joseph LoDuca, Elia Cmiral, and Marco Beltrami, including the scores for Legally Blonde, Nurse Betty, The Triangle, The Messengers, and Mimic. William composed and orchestrated music for Steven Spielberg's Tiny Toon Adventures and Batman: The Animated Series. In the summer of 2001 he toured with the rock group Yes for the Yes Symphonic Tour across America, composing the overture for the show and conducting the orchestra onstage with the band.\n\nWilliam has also been heavily involved in performing classic film music, conducting scores by such eminent composers as Max Steiner, Bernard Herrmann, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold. He has conducted much Americana concert music by such composers as Ferde Grofé, Robert Russell Bennett, and Meredith Willson.\n\nJOHN MORGAN is a film composer based in Los Angeles, California. After receiving his Masters Degree in Music at San Diego State University, and studying composition with David Ward-Steinman, he stayed on at the University and taught orchestration, music theory and various film music courses.\n\nIn the late 70s, Morgan moved to the Los Angeles area and secured work orchestrating for such composers as Fred Steiner, Bruce Broughton and Alex North. In 1979, Morgan composed and orchestrated his first feature film score and in the ensuing years composed music for more than 30 feature films, as well as many television, radio and cable projects including Starship Troopers II, Trinity and Beyond, Ray Harryhausen-The Early Years, Cinerama Adventure, Demon in the Bottle, Tiny Toon Adventures, and others...many in collaboration with his music partner and life long friend, William Stromberg.\n\nMorgan's love and passion for the great scores of Hollywood's golden age has led him to the arena of arranging and reconstructing many classic scores for new recordings. He has embarked on a long series of film music recordings for Marco Polo (Naxos), BMG Classics his own label with Anna Bonn and William Stromberg, Tribute Film Classics.\n\nAmong the scores he has reconstructed and orchestrated for new recordings are: Max Steiner's The Charge of the Light Brigade, King Kong; Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Captain Blood, Escape Me Never, The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Sea Hawk; Roy Webb's scores for the Val Lewton films, Hans Salter and Frank Skinner's The Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein, Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein as well as scores by Hugo Friedhofer and Victor Young.\n\nANNA BONN STROMBERG - After earning her Bachelors Degree in Music Composition at the University of Southern California, Anna Bonn continued her studies by completing the program of Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television headed by legendary Disney composer, Buddy Baker. At USC she proudly had the opportunity to study with film composers such as, David Raksin, Christopher Young, Fred Karlin, John Parker, and Joe Harnell among others.\n\nAfter college, Anna went to work for Christopher Young as an assistant and orchestrator. While working with Chris, she orchestrated cues for Murder at 1600, Hard Rain, and The Man Who Knew Too Little. She then went to work at Warner Brothers to be part of the music team for Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, and many Warner Bros. films. She became the head proofreader at Warner Bros. and soon after became the head proofreader for Sony Pictures Entertainment. Anna has composed music with her husband, William Stromberg for the feature films, The Inner Circle, Dismembered, Army of the Dead, and Sasquatch Hunters for the Sci-Fi Channel. Most recently, working with Eric Stonerook Music, she has been a co-superviser for the music preparation for Public Enemies, Fast and Furious, Dragonball Evolution, Gran Torino, and Changeling.\n\nTribute Film Classics wishes to give special thanks to all the people who have been invaluable in making our record label a success: Craig Spaulding and the Screen Archives gang, Jim Titus, James D'Arc (Brigham Young University), Steven Skaggs, Dan Goldwasser, Curt Hardaway, Ryan Brennan, Marina Levine, Ellen Levine, Alexander Volkov, The Moscow Symphony Orchestra and Choir, Vadim Davydov, Scott MacQueen, Charles Johnston, Ray Harryhausen, Ray Bradbury, Albert K.
