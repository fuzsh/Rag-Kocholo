        "text": "As a Gold City fan, I attended the debut both hopeful and nervous, change is always hard and Gold City has had a lot of change lately. As they stepped up to do sound check everyone in the place stopped to listen, everyone was wondering ‘is it going to work’, ‘how will they sound’? I was standing by Karen Peck when they started and she was listening intently. As they finished Karen and several others broke into applause!\n\nLater when they stepped on the stage they opened with ‘One Scarred Hand’ and the harmony was great. By the end of the song most of the crowd was on their feet to welcome a new decade of continued gospel music excellence from Gold City. This was followed by rousing renditions of ‘Cast My Bread Upon The Water”, “When He Blessed My Soul’ and “I’m Not Giving Up’.\n\nNext Danny ‘explained’ to the group and audience that his dad’s requirement for coming back was they had to go back and so some ‘old stuff’ and that they were going to do ‘Rainbow of Love’ with just the piano. The interaction between Roy and Tim here was perfect comedic timing along with an awesome rendering of the song.\n\nDanny called Josh out front to do a solo on a song Josh knew well ‘Hallelujah I have Found Him’ and he showed the vocal abilities that made Danny and Tim sure he was the right man for the job. The crowd was again on their feet.\n\nThey closed out the first half with ‘Midnight Cry’ and ‘When He Calls Me’ and left the crowd clamoring for more.\n\nIn a 30 minute set they got 5 standing ovations! They demonstrated harmony, comic relief, enthusiasm, as well as how to have fun on stage and bring your audience with you!\n\nJosh and Roy are awesome additions, Tim is still one of the best, if not the best, bass in the business and Bruce & Danny seemed to be having fun and nailing their parts with ease!\n\nOn the second half they sang ‘I’m Rich’ and ‘When the Glory Rolls’ before stepping back. Danny Jones quickly brought them back for a ‘by request song’ ‘Under Control’ and I’ll go on record again as say ‘no one can sing that song like Tim Riley’. It is his signature song and last night when it was called you could tell Josh had not practiced that one, not by his performance but by the look on his face.\n\nAll through the program Bruce and Danny make sure that Josh was queued if he seemed uncertain on a song and again the uncertainty showed on his face, not in his vocals. In 1980 I had the privilege of attending the first Gold City concert in Gainesville, GA and even with some rough edges I believed that group was going to a force to be ‘reckoned with’. As 2010 came rolling in, I had the privilege of hearing what I consider to be a group that SGM fans will be talking about and going to hear as this year progresses and a new decade proceeds!"
