        "text": "Gold City is excited to announce two new members: Roy Webb and Joshua Cobb are joining one of Southern Gospel music’s most awarded quartets, effective immediately. “Words cannot express the excitement Gold City has about the addition of these two extremely talented men,” states Daniel Riley. “It’s no secret that we have had our share of changes in the past several months. We want to publicly thank the fans for their encouragement and prayers during our time of transition. We feel those prayers have been answered, and God has assembled a great team of talented men, ready to carry on the legacy that was started 30 years ago.” Roy Webb is no stranger to Southern Gospel music fans, having traveled with Ernie Haase & Signature Sound for nearly four years. With his quick wit and incredible piano ability, he has won the hearts of fans all over the world. “I have been a Gold City fan since I first heard them in 1984,” says Roy. “I have always loved their music and I consider it an honor to be able to play for them!” While Roy is NOT giving up his solo status, he will be playing for Gold City on numerous dates. “I absolutely LOVE being a soloist, and I will ALWAYS do solo ministry. However, on those dates where I am not scheduled for a solo concert, you will find me at the piano playing for this incredible quartet.” Joshua Cobb is no newcomer to Southern Gospel music. Most fans will remember him as the original tenor for the group Legacy Five and a former Horizon Individual Singing News Fan Award Winner. “Its hard to believe that I have been away from this great music for almost 10 years,” states Joshua. “It has always been my first love and it feels great to be able to join forces with such a heralded quartet that will no doubt continue to have great success in this industry.” “We knew Joshua was singing we just didn’t know where,” adds Daniel. “So we tracked him down, and learned that he had a solo ministry and has turned down numerous recording deals and incredible offers in the past few years, and with a voice like his, I’m not surprised that he was in such demand.” Joshua is looking forward to reuniting with friends and fans all across the country and is ready to step on stage with Tim Riley. “Tim has always been one of, if not, my favorite bass singers,” says Joshua, “and to be able to stand on stage and watch this legend hit those low notes is going to be a thrill in itself!” Speaking of Tim, the legendary bass singer has committed to a return to the full-time world of Southern Gospel music and he looks forward to seeing all of his friends at a concert soon."
