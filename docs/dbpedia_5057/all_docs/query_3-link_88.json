        "text": "This weekend I had the privilege and honor of attending and serving as a judge for the 2024 Leonard Falcone International Euphonium and Tuba Festival. We heard students from all over the World, as young as 15, making music like they've been doing it for decades. While at the festival I got to perform a solo w/ piano and play the 2 tuba-euphonium ensembles.\n\nMiles Davis' solo with Charlie Parker's Now's the Time recorded in 1945. Early be-bop is a perfect place for beginning jazz students to start transcribing due to time constraints. Records could only hold approximately 20 minutes and artist desired to fit as many songs as they could on a record, they took shorter improvised solos sometimes only 1 or 2 choruses. Davis also doesn't get enough credit being one of the early bebop instrumentalist. When someone says bebop trumpet, Dizzy Gillespie comes to mind. But thanks to Gillespie's being a multi-instrumentalist A 19 year old Davis was able to be on landmark recordings while Diz played piano."
