        "text": "TheatreWorks Community Players are set to perform “The Shape of Things” starting tomorrow evening.\n\n“The Shape of Things” is a show by Neil Labute that tells a story of boundaries, love, art and subjectivity. The story follows Adam, Evelyn, Jenny and Fiona as they live their lives in a small, college town.\n\nAdam is an English major who works part-time as a security guard for the school’s museum which is where he meets Evelyn, an art major. Jenny and Fiona are engaged classmates and friends of Adam.\n\nOver the course of the story, the spring semester unfolds and the intricacies of the quartet’s relationships with each other are explored. The show has themes of comedy, betrayal and social expectations while detailing how far someone is willing to go for love.\n\nOwen Amos will play Adam. He started acting in shows at Magna Vista High School and has since been in improve shows and plays with TheatreWorks Community Players as well.\n\n“I didn’t know anything about this show,” Amos said. “I didn’t know anything really about the script until I got the role. I knew that it was an R rated show, I knew that it was a more serious piece — and I think that’s what drew me to it.”\n\nWhen he got the role, he said, he was excited to see how a more serious role would be a great way to push himself and his acting skills.\n\n“I saw a lot of myself in Adam, but it was the me that I am glad that I got through,” he said. “In a way I had to revert a little bit to get myself into that character.”\n\n“The thing I love about the show is that it feels like a movie but the emotions that are portrayed, everybody can relate to it,” he said.\n\nSarah Beth Webb will play Evelyn. She has been involved in theater since childhood and has been doing community shows starting at 14. She did shows in high school and one in undergrad before taking a break. This will be her first show in around seven years.\n\nHer favorite thing about her character is her style and her intellect.\n\n“She is extremely smart,” Webb said.\n\nHer favorite thing about the story the show tells is the imperfectness of every one of its characters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n“There honestly aren’t any good characters,” she said. “They all suck but just in different ways and I think that’s part of what makes the ending so confusing.”\n\n“There’s not a hero and a villain,” she added.\n\nEmma Hutchins will play Jenny. She has mostly always done film or screen acting and typically doesn’t do stage performances except for at TheatreWorks. Stage Manager Zach McPeak reached out to her when auditions were coming up and though she is living in Charleston, South Carolina right now for college, she was able to make it work.\n\n“I was just like, I’ll give it a go and see how it works and it all just aligned perfectly,” she said.\n\nHutchins hadn’t heard of the play before but knew of the 2003 movie by the same name.\n\n“It’s actually really cool,” Hutchins said of the show. “This was a lot like acting for the screen which is much more natural and getting into method acting … It was a really happy medium between live acting and acting for the screen.”\n\nShe said the most challenging thing about her role was embodying the different aspects of her character, while some other aspects may hide ulterior motives.\n\n“The cast is so small yet so much happens,” she said. “There’s a lot of interacting between each character and I don’t think I’ve ever worked, especially in a theater show, where I’m working with the same actors over and over again.”\n\nMadison Maverick will play Fiona. Maverick started performing at around 15 years old at Patrick County High School. She went on to do theater at Magna Vista High School, Patrick & Henry Community College Productions and with TheatreWorks Community Players.\n\nThe role of Fiona was originally written as a Phillip but was changed to Fiona for this production. The character is intense and aggressive throughout the show in her interactions with other characters.\n\nMaverick said to prepare for that mindset she would sit in front of her bathroom mirror to make sure her facial expressions reflected her words.\n\n“Because I don’t do that,” she said. “Pretty much everything about Fiona is about a power dynamic … So, when I really have to ramp it up … It took me some fine tuning but I’m really happy with where I’ve gotten.”\n\n“A lot of hard work has been put into this,” she said. It’s come together really well … Everything kind of fell into place. Things just for us, it just meshed and I was like ‘this is really going to be something good.’”\n\nShow times are Aug. 9, 10, 16 and 17 at 7 p.m. and Aug. 11 and 18 at 2 p.m. at 44 Franklin St. Tickets are $15 and can be purchased at twcp.net.\n\nMonique Holland (276)-734-9603\n\nmonique.holland@martinsvillebulletin.com\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nMonique Holland\n\nReporter\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
