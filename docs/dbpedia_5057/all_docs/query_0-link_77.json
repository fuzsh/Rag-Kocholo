        "text": "Biography\n\nAva Roberts is a lyricist-composer, book writer, and early-career producer in the theatrical space.\n\nShe studied Musical Theater Songwriting with the New York Youth Symphony for three years, where she honed her craft under the mentorship and criticism of a different Broadway professional every week. Her work composed in this program also received annual debut opportunities in Joe’s Pub. As an English major at Columbia University, Roberts explores language of theater from an analytical perspective on the daily. She supplements her studies through campus theater initiatives that produce student-written work. Roberts was the lyricist for the The 129th Annual Varsity Show, Columbia’s oldest and most renowned performing arts tradition. Notable alumni from the canon of creative team members that Roberts joined through this opportunity include Greta Gerwig, Oscar Hammerstein II, Roy Webb, Tom Kitt, Richard Rogers, Edward Kleban, and Lorenz Hart. The four-performance run attracted over 2500 students and community members in the audience. An excerpt of Roberts’ debut production with completely original music, lyrics, and book, Inner Styles, received a workshop reading at the Glicker-Milstein Theater in fall 2023. There will likely be a full 24-hour reading of the show in mid summer 2024.\n\nAs an aspiring producer, Roberts has honed her managerial skills through studying Business Management at Columbia, and with internships at Broadway Crew in theatrical accounts, and Park Pictures in film production. Throughout summer 2024, she will be interning with NBCUniversal with NBC News/the TODAY Show in entertainment booking."
