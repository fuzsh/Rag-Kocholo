I feel that Gold City is losing a great stage presence/personality albeit from the piano bench in losing Roy. But this is a chance for Gold City to turn what may be perceived as a negative and turn it into a positive. I personally believe Gold City have always produced the best albums when they have a piano player that also doubles as an arranger/producer ala Garry Jones, Tim Parton, and Channing Eleton… So this is their chance in my humble opinion to go after a guy with similar producing/arranging skills of the aforementioned piano players. I would love to see them bring back Garry or Channing, but I am not sure that will happen. Here is a name that I feel would fit them well in the role that I mentioned, he is Greg Howlett (plays for the Daybreak Quartet) he has produced albums of his own and I believe has helped produce some of Daybreak’s stuff. I am sure there are many other qualified pianists out there that are interested in singing for the prestigious Gold City Quartet…"
