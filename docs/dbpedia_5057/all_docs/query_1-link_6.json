Ernie told Roy to go home and reconcile with his father\n\nbefore his dad passed away.\n\nIt appears that Roy has decided not to come back.\n\nThis is not a surprise seeing how Roy will be picking up his masters degree\n\nin jazz piano this year from college. I had expected him to leave anyway.\n\nPost by dodger\n\nThe announcement of Roy Webb's departure from Signature Sound sure\n\ndidn't give much in the way of detail. Why did he\n\nleave????????????????\n\nDodger- Hide quoted text -\n\n- Show quoted text -\n\nThanks....the announcement really didn't say much of anything. Usually\n\nit is said so and so will be leaving such and such group in order to\n\netcv etc etc. This said basically nothing.\n\nDodger"
