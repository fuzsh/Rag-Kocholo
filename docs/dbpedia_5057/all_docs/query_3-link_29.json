        "text": "5 years, 5 months ago by Jim Dewey\n\nSays it was a mistake to continue class\n\nThe following is the full statement from QPS 172 Superintendent Roy Webb, regarding a music theory class taught at Quincy High School:\n\nMany of you have viewed or read articles, news items, and social media posts on the Quincy Senior High\n\nMusic Theory Class. I would like to respond:\n\nFirst, one positive item that has come out of this controversy, is opportunity I’ve had to get to know many\n\nof our music students, mostly seniors. I have admired their work ethic and talent on stage, but recently, I\n\nhave spoken with them in person. They are amazing young people. They have analyzed this situation with\n\nmaturity and thoughtfulness. They have great passion for music, our music program, and they care a\n\ngreat deal for each other. While they’ve been a bit split on this topic, both sides talk about the other with\n\ncare and respect. They are a family in “A” Building. They want that legacy to remain for incoming Blue Devils.\n\nAbout twenty-five years ago the orchestra and band were losing their best and brightest students because\n\nthey could not take music classes and still compete for high honors at Quincy High School. The principal,\n\nband director, and orchestra director met and developed an invitation only, honors music course that\n\ncould be weighted for high-functioning music students. The class would require the student to be heavily\n\ninvolved in music with concerts, contests, and private lessons. The rigor was designed, but not in the\n\nclassroom. The intent was to solve a problem that was restricting highly intelligent music students. It was\n\na good solution at the time.\n\nThat is how the class has operated for the last 25 years. To our generation of students, teachers, and\n\nadministrators, it is the way it has always been. That does not make it right and it is not meant to be an\n\nexcuse. But sometimes things just continue, and you do not really think about it. I could not spell music\n\ntheory until a couple months ago. It was a mistake to continue the class as is for this many years. As\n\nsuperintendent, I sign off on the validity of all classes, so I am responsible for the course. I take full\n\naccountability of my action and will accept any disciplinary action the board of education requires.\n\nThis year we had a parent raise concern about the class. We reviewed what the parent said, analyzed the\n\nsituation, and agreed with her on many points. The course description in our course catalogue did not\n\nmatch the actual class. The weighting of the course was not fair to all Quincy Senior High students.\n\nTherefore, the principal, the music director, and I decided to eliminate the class. We may not have moved\n\nas fast as some would want, but there is a lot to weigh when making decisions for all students. A few\n\nstudents in the class had completed many of the requirements. We did eliminate the class well before any\n\nmedia or social media was involved. There is no cover up.\n\nNo teacher has gained monetarily from the course. It is done outside of the school day, and there are no\n\nstipends or pay associated. It has always been voluntary and an additional unpaid duty. It was done for\n\nthe good of the music department.\n\nI have seen words like fraud and cover-up to describe this issue. Those are strong words to throw around.\n\nFirst, there has been no cover up. We did not eliminate the class because of media. It was closed well\n\nbefore any media was involved. Continuation of this class was a mistake. Again, I am responsible for the\n\nmistake and take complete accountability."
