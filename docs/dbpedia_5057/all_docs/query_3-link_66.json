        "text": "Chick Webb (born February 10, 1905?, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.—died June 16, 1939, Baltimore) was an American jazz drummer who led one of the dominant big bands of the swing era. Its swing, precision, and popularity made it the standard of excellence to which other big bands aspired.\n\nSources vary on Webb’s birth year; 1909 appears on his death certificate and grave marker, while census records suggest that he was born in 1905. He went to New York City in 1924 and formed his own big band in 1926; in its early years it included such players as alto saxophonists Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges. Throughout the 1930s, steady engagements at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem helped Webb maintain a stable roster of band personnel and develop ensemble discipline."
