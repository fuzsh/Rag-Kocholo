        "text": "The colorful individual behind the “Nudie suit”—a universal name for the outrageously embellished stage costumes that became status symbols in country music circles in the 1950s and beyond—embodied the American Dream. Born Nutya Kotlyrenko in Kiev, Russia, in 1902, he became a tailor’s apprentice at age eight. At eleven, his parents sent him to the United States to escape anti-Jewish pogroms in Czarist Russia. Like many immigrants, the Kotlyrenko family shortened their name, and according to the Cohn family, Nutya went by “Nudie” after a customs agent at Ellis Island misunderstood his name.\n\nIn 1934, Cohn and his wife, Bobbie, opened Nudie’s for the Ladies in Manhattan, where he designed rhinestone-embellished costumes for chorus girls and strippers. Within a few years of relocating to Los Angeles in the 1940s, Cohn began making stage wear for western swing musicians he and Bobbie befriended at local nightspots. In 1950, the couple opened Nudie’s Rodeo Tailors, the North Hollywood storefront and tailoring shop where Cohn would cultivate a celebrity clientele that included country and rock royalty—ranging from Hank Williams and Johnny Cash to Elvis Presley and Elton John. Cohn, who died in 1984, left a sparkling legacy, which is carried on through the bespoke Western wear created by protégés and acolytes such as Manuel Cuevas, Jaime Castaneda, and Union Western’s Jerry Lee Atwood.\n\nPut On Those Rhinestones!\n\nLefty Frizzell\n\nNudie Cohn’s signature design innovation was inspired by singing sensation Lefty Frizzell, who dominated the country charts in the early 1950s with #1 hits such as “If You’ve Got the Money (I’ve Got the Time).” The first time he met Frizzell, in 1951, Cohn thought the handsome crooner would look terrific wearing rhinestones and made him an outfit with a smattering of the reflective crystals. Frizzell was delighted with the audience response to his shimmering new stage costume. From then on, every time he ordered a suit, Lefty instructed Cohn to “put on a few more rhinestones, Nudie, put on those rhinestones!”\n\nHank Snow, “I’m Moving On”\n\nDecorated with rhinestones and embroidered locomotives and lanterns, this themed Nudie suit illustrates Hank Snow’s 1950 chart-topping hit “I’m Moving On.” Snow, who insisted that “clothes are fifty percent of anybody’s act,” took an active role in designing his wardrobe. He detailed the look he wanted for this suit in a letter to Nudie Cohn, writing, “Hey there Ole Buddy…I would like a color something between an amber and a cream…and on the front of this coat, I would like a train on each side, preferably the old-time steam type…the smoke should be brown or black. On the two breast pockets should be a brakeman’s lantern.”\n\nRay Price, “Cherokee Cowboy”\n\nIn 1954, singer Ray Price parted with the Drifting Cowboys—the band he inherited from his friend Hank Williams after his death—and put together the first lineup of a group that would rank as one of the hottest road bands in country music for more than a decade. Recruiting members of a Texas band called the Western Cherokees, Price combined the two names to come up with the Cherokee Cowboys. In the hands of Nudie Cohn, the band’s name inspired dozens of stage suits for Price and his band that used depictions of Native Americans and their cultural objects and imitated Native American art.\n\nGram Parsons, “Sin City”\n\nIn 1968, trailblazing country-rock band the Flying Burrito Brothers went to Nudie’s Rodeo Tailors to be outfitted in the style of outrageous, rhinestone-studded suits they associated with real country music. The group’s front man, Gram Parsons, collaborated with Nudie’s head designer, Manuel Cuevas, to conjure this themed outfit that symbolizes the duality of sin and salvation. The sleeves, front, and lapels of the motorcycle jacket are embellished with chain-stitched marijuana leaves, pills, poppies and cartoonish pinup girls; the flames down the split-seam legs of the hip-huggers signify hellfire; and the embroidered cross gleaming on back represents redemption.
