Can it be a roadmap for new entertainment formats around the globe? It only opened a few months ago and it’s breaking record after record. The most impressive one, I think, is how it is quickly turning itself into a huge cash machine. It is rumored that its cost of around 2.3B USD is amortized within 4-5 years. I rarely see any big entertainment project that has such a steep curve to break even. Naturally, the owner of The Sphere (MSG) is already pondering new venues around the globe and it is no surprise that places like Abu Dhabi rank high as a next stop. People are flying specially to Las Vegas for attending events in the Sphere and they will do so with other destinations. Hence, the interest in getting the „globe“ onto you backyard is big with many forward-thinking locations. What is also impressive is how much people are willing to pay for an immersive video-live blended event. Again, the pandemic probably has elevated that need of live, in person experiences with other people. Yet there is something else here. People love the bonding element of such campfire experiences and video is the ultimate emotional media to create and transport that. Combined with music it is an irresistible mixture of senses, emotions and community. There are similar projects around the world that try to play on this kind of experiences: Adele will give a series of concerts in Munich in what is called a „pop up arena“. ABBA has also build its own „residency“ for its Voyage Show in London and is planning to take it to other towns. Now, what does it mean for a broadcaster or TV business: you should indeed ponder the idea of creating your own immersive experience. It does not need to be a big shiny globe or giant arena - even a small café will do or your version of a living room. You need to find a way to merge your content with an analogue setting that has digital features. It will take you a long way and not only creates brand loyalty but also a revenue stream. Any ideas or experiences what little or big spheres you are gonna build? #thesphere #entertainment #broadcastTV #television #strategy\n\nWelcome to the entertainment world where passion meets profession, and the stars align for those in favor of the extraordinary. Embarking on this journey a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to connect with industry experts (Gaming, Streaming, Music, Cinema, Theme park) and discuss their views on the sector’s evolution in 2024. These insights offer a unique window into the intricacies of this vibrant world. From technological advancements to shifting consumer behaviours, our discussions highlighted the multiple challenges that are shaping the entertainment landscape and underscore the importance of innovation and strategic planning in navigating the road ahead. Here’s a little recap of my conversations so far : 1. It’s all about the experience - Immersive and interactive experiences will continue to captivate the public. People crave interactive storytelling and physical events to connect, share laughter, and create lasting memories. So how to make iconic experiences in 2024? https://lnkd.in/eHdMGSgB 2. AI, to infinity and beyond - AI integration could play a larger role in content creation, from specific recommendations to enhancing special effects. It will become more sophisticated and might appear in some of the most anticipated games. Will GTA 6 be the first of its kind? https://lnkd.in/eBAbqKwB 3. Strategy roadmap for localisation? - Allowing for cultural differences and considering contextual relevance is still very much a challenge. Companies struggle to find the right balance between efficiency, cost management, and cultural nuances. Does everything need to be localised? What process should we apply to maximise efficiency without creating cultural bias? Navigating these challenges will require a comprehensive understanding of the target audience, a good collaboration between content creators and localizers, and a commitment to delivering content that feels both authentic and resonates in the local context. 4. There will be disturbances - External factors like economic downturns, strikes, and geopolitical events can significantly impact the entertainment industry, affecting production schedules, distribution, and consumer spending. So, how much impact should we expect? https://lnkd.in/eYyxvSfG Without surprise, these challenges underscore the need for innovation, adaptability, and strategic planning within the entertainment industry and it will be my great privilege to be a part of the solution in 2024. Who knows? I might be able to showcase some of the positive impact strategies I have been practising over the past few years and add it into the mix, to truly explore meaningful experiences. Should we discuss? I look forward to continuing to engage in conversation with passionate individuals within the industry and I’d like to thank everyone whom I’ve had the chance to speak to in the past few days. Adventure awaits, stay tuned! #entertainmentindustry #gaming #2024treds #immersiveexperience #storytelling Anaïs experiences ©\n\nHarmonizing the Past and Future In the landscape of live entertainment, a seismic shift is underway, heralded by the confluence of technological innovation and unparalleled musical talent. As we stand on the cusp of a new era marked by the launch of Apple Vision Pro, a state-of-the-art augmented reality headset, the Taylor Swift Eras Tour and Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour emerge as monumental events that redefine what it means to experience music. These tours, akin to the legendary Woodstock for the past generation, represent the zenith of live performances, marrying the visceral thrill of in-person concerts with the boundless possibilities of digital augmentation. Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is not just a concert; it's a journey through the evolution of an artist who has defined a generation. Each show is a mosaic of different phases of Swift's career, offering fans a rare opportunity to witness the transformation of an icon. Similarly, Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour is a celebration of artistic rebirth, showcasing her unparalleled ability to innovate and captivate. Both tours are more than live events; they are cultural phenomena that encapsulate the spirit of their times. But what sets these tours apart in the annals of live entertainment history is not just the star power of their headliners. It's the integration of technologies like the Apple Vision Pro, which promises to redefine the concert-going experience. Imagine experiencing the ethereal visuals of Swift's \"Folklore\" era or the electrifying energy of Beyoncé's \"Break My Soul\" with enhanced reality, where the line between the performer and the audience blurs, creating an immersive experience that transcends physical boundaries. This technological revolution comes at a pivotal moment, as the world gradually moves away from live events in their traditional form. The Apple Vision Pro represents a leap towards a future where live performances can be augmented or even fully experienced in virtual reality, offering an alternative that preserves the essence of live entertainment while making it accessible to anyone, anywhere. It's a testament to how far we've come since the days of Woodstock, where being physically present was the only way to truly \"be\" at a concert. As we look to the future, it's clear that the legacy of these tours will be far-reaching. In this golden age of live entertainment, as we navigate the transition from purely live events to hybrid experiences enriched by technology, these tours stand as beacons of what is possible. They remind us that, even as the world changes, the power of music to bring people together remains constant, evolving with us into new forms but always retaining its soul. Live Music should not just be a concert; they are the bridge to the next chapter of live entertainment, where every note, every beat, resonates through both time and technology, connecting us in ways we've only begun to imagine.\n\nGreat review yesterday about Phantom Peak's new season, \"Starlit Summer\" with the author identifying what makes Phantom Peak unique and successful: \"Where other immersive experiences may fall short by feeling too prescriptive, promising freedom yet guiding you into a pre-decided path, Phantom Peak truly excels. Guests have the option to take on quests—interconnected storylines to be completed at their own pace—or attend scheduled events like the ‘Phantom Peak Olympics.’ The village also features a restaurant, allowing you to take as many breaks as you'd like. Your journey is yours to choose.\" Research shows that immersive entertainment customers seek themed environments, shared or communal experiences, and compelling narratives that allow them to jump into the story. Phantom Peak excels in these areas while maintaining financial discipline in its design, build, and operations through in-house capabilities and proprietary show-tech. Oh, it's also a heck of a lot of fun. After succeeding in the world's most competitive immersive entertainment market (London), and among the highest rated, we're getting close to announcing the locations of our first U.S. sites. Stay tuned!"
