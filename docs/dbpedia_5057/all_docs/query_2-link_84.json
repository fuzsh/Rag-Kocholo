        "text": "Carmen is a C-U-N-T!!!\n\nWhile in college I worked at Magic Mountain and he would always perform concerts there during the summer. Actually the only concerts we could have there were shitty gospel shows since the TLC riot a few seasons earlier.\n\nAnyways, this asshole demanded everything under the sun. Air conditioned limo to drive him around the back of the park (everyone else used vans), no one was to dare speak to him, no other music could be heard within a certain distance of his presence, etc...\n\nHere's the kicker though...the only food he demanded was... fresh baked cookies from our lot cafeteria!\n\nActually now that I think about it, we could only book two acts in the park...gospel shit and WEIRD AL YANKOVIC. Somehow he was deemed \"safe.\"\n\nAl was the polar opposite of Carmen. No frills, no outrageous demands (except one case of bottled water, no brand preference) and just an all around nice guy. I got to escort him around the park and when we rode in the van we would make up crazy lyrics to songs that came on. DO YOU KNOW HOW FUCKING COOL THAT WAS???\n\nMy all-time favorite reformed christian singer - RAY BOLTZ!! He was a huge christian singer, came out in his 50s, and has the most wonderful album out with songs he wrote after coming out. If you've ever watched Mark Lowry's web videos, he toured with one guy that was over the top (ala Paul Lynde). Can't remember his name, but he made me cringe (because he was a buffoon).\n\nMark Lowry. Stan Whitmire (brilliant gospel pianist) is probably gay (toured with Lowry). Roy Webb (piano player for Ernie Haase) was rumored to have been fired because he was gay. I went to a Gaither concert and was cruised by Ryan Seaton who was also fired by Ernie a year or so later. Michael Hopper. Kirk Talley (they did a GQ article on him).\n\nTHese guys have great talent - but I have to say it's time they stop supporting the industry that doesn't support them. Gaither and Lowry were \"crucified\" for taking a picture with the lesbian who wrote one of the most popular christian songs of the 70s. They capitulated and issued statements acknowledging homosexuality as a sin.\n\nI used to find comfort in southern gospel - until one day I realized how depressing it is. It's all \"I am not worthy\" and \"I am nothing\" and \"my life is filled with shame\". Seriously sad shit. Their concerts are nothing but sales events. The singers all run up to their tables before and after the concert to sell their CDs, their T-shirts, and their autographs. They make money off of people's fear and superstition.\n\nI read Dawkins' book, THe God Delusion, and have been an extremely happy atheist ever since.\n\nI'd also heard about Jonathan Pierce coming out. There are a few videos of him on Youtube from his Gaither days and also an interview from a show on TBN. I always thought he was hot when on the Gaither programs, but when I saw him on his HGTV show (Interiors, Inc.) he'd lost his boyish looks and gained weight. He still sported a pair of tight jeans quite well! Jonathan's former wife/beard, Denise Hildreth (Hildreth is Pierce's actual last name) has written a book about how she got through their divorce with God's help, but doesn't mention Jonathan's homosexuality, nor is it mentioned on his Wikipedia page. I have seen his story discussed on other websites, and I've also read interviews where his ex talks about how he and she tried to make their marriage work, but were always dealing with an \"elephant in the room\". Still, I've never seen her out him publicly, which is classy of her IMO. To my knowledge, Jonathan has never appeared on any Gaither reunions, but I'm unsure if that's by his choice, or Bill's.\n\nRyan Seaton is married with 2 daughters, but it wouldn't surprise me if he was bi. especially when he was with Ernie Haase and Signature sound with his tan face, whitened teeth and highlights in his hair . Yum!\n\nWes Hampton also pings my gaydar, but again, is married with kids.\n\nI guess I am somewhat of a closeted Gaither Homecoming Friends fan, especially the old ones with Vestal and Howard, Jake, Eva Mae, The Speers and some of the old members of various groups like the Statesmen and the Catherdals. I have always loved Sue Dodge and her energy.\n\nI have NEVER and WILL NEVER take a liking to Bill Gaither. I think he is bright composer, producer and probably a megamillionaire, but I think he is a fake. I saw somewhere he is very clean, but I do appreciate what he does.\n\nI once contacted the Gaither Cruises to see where they stood on gays being on the cruise. Their reply was not good at all.\n\nI must admit a guilty pleasure I recently subscribed to the Gaither Network, and must say I have watched a lot, especially the older ones.\n\nAre the \"how darez U slander the right-chuss!!!!1\" replies on this thread for real? Like, for REAL, real? I can't believe there's people who actually talk like that.\n\nAnyway, my vote is Vicki Yohe. She posts the worst homophobic shit on her Instagram account. The type of person who rails against something so much, you just KNOW they are so deep in the closet, they're crapping mothballs.\n\nPersonally, I found this site by googling \"is mark lowry gay\". I like him as a person and once in the late 90s he thrilled teenage me by featuring me in one of his \"reMarkable\" newsletters.\n\nBut as I got older, I was so sad to see the type of institutions and politicians some of my favorite Christian/gospel artists aligned themselves with. I used to be a huge MWS fan. (By the by- don't think he is gay nor bi) But no more. And I STILL love tobymac's music...but lately every time I listen, I have the thought \"he likes and respects Falwell. He LIKES and RESPECTS Falwell\" running through my head.\n\nI just really don't know where it all came from. Even if one were to agree with the school of thought that being gay is an \"abomination\"...one cannot disregard the other scriptural \"abominations\"; in the same chapter where homosity is named as abominable to god, so is \"men who cut their beard hair\". I mean seriously. Where are the protests about beard trimmers not being able to get married or adopt in certain states? It's asinine.\n\nThere has long been a proliferation of gay rumors in the southern gospel arena. In this particular scenario, I feel that yes- where's there's smoke, there's big flaming fire. What a shame so many feel they cannot show their true selves even as they worship a god who loves them as much as the next guy.\n\nit has been rumored for years that lanny wolfe is gay. and it is my inclination to believe it. he always surrounded himself with young attractive bible-school guys, traveling about the country and sharing hotel rooms with them. his ultimate undoing, as i understand it, came as a result of an encounter with an underage male in a public restroom. somehow he managed to avoid serious legal consequences but it destroyed his marriage. his wife, marietta, was said to be on the verge of divorcing him several times throughout their marriage but when this incident happened, she promptly divorced him and moved back to ohio where she married an african-american minister she had known and dated before marrying lanny. lanny now lives in houston. also, many people (myself included) believe andrae crouch and his twin sister, sandra, are both gay. other names that come to mind, as previously stated, are mark lowry and his pianist, stan whitmire and also jake hess from the gather videos. (don't know if he is even still alive)\n\nJesus said He came for the sick. A lot of these people lived straight lives until they started listening to the lies of the Devil saying it is not wrong to be in love with who you love. God is very clear that there will be no homosexuals, drunks, prostitusts, people living together having a sexual relationship. There is a lot more but I don't have my Bible next to me. Jesus said to come follow Him and to take up our cross everyday. We are not suppose to follow after our own flesh but we are to deny it and followe after Jesus and if we trust in Him and believe everything He says we shall be set free of our sins. He covered them on the cross. But we must love all pleople and pray for their sins to turh from them. Jesus said go and sin nomore\n\nI know Vestal Goodman. My mom used to do her hair. She was from Fyffe Alabama and had her hair done at least twice a week or if she went on a long trip before she finally cut it my mom would travel with them in their bus. I can tell you that about 5 years before she died she and I had a long sit down talk about my lifestyle and being gay. So I truly do know Vestal and she did love everybody. I also knew Hap as he was called only by Vestal because she loved and cared for him so much. You can’t bash the man for being gay and having that nickname that’s just what Vestal called him and it was just a nickname not assuming he was gay because he showed more love for Vestal than anyone I know. I’m not a vain man but I was a late teen when I got to really knownhim I enemy foshing and stuff with him and he knew I was gay but neither him or Vestal thought any less of me for being who I was. I remember exactly what she told me oenof the last days I saw her when mom was doing her hair. She said and I quote this verbatim “son of you go through life and people hate you just like they do Mark, (knowing this meant Mark Lowery) then you’ll have waisted the best years of your life with hate in your heart”. She asked me who the civil rights leader from Mississippi was that they made the movie about and she was talking about Medgar Evers she quoted him word for word. When you hate you only hurt yourself because when you hate half the people you hate don’t know and the other half don’t care” -Medgar Evers/ -Vestal Goodman. She told me that if chose “to love another man to love him with my whole heart and don’t worry about others condemning me to hell for it”. She said she was “sure more gay people most likely made it to heaven, than hating cristians who lied about their sons and tried to hide them from the world”: So my take away its better to give that love god gave you in your heart to share with another man than to live a lie and share false love with a woman when that’s not who I was born to be! Better to be a happy gay man than be a pissed off christian who does exactly what the Bible says not to do and that’s cast stones, judge, and hate others for what they do on their bedroom. I actually am really good friend s with a gay priest who has another gay priest for his partner. They will never marry because that’s just something a priest does. They are married to god. But they can love whoever they want while here on earth and take their chance on judgment day."
