        "text": "Queen Margrethe will abdicate on January 14, 2024, ending her 52 year long reign and handing the throne over to her son, Crown Prince Frederik. When he rules, he will use the regnal name of King Frederik X.\n\nIn Denmark, since 1513, kings are named (alternating) Frederik and Christian. Queen Margrethe II became the first female monarch since Queen Margrethe I (who ruled from 1376 to 1412), and because her father was King Frederik IX, she decided to be the \"Christian\" name cycle, and named her eldest Frederik. Prince Frederik, then, named his eldest son Prince Christian, in following with royal tradition. Upon his father's accession, he will become Crown Prince Christian, and one day, he will be King Christian XI.\n\nCrown Princess Mary (who was born Mary Donaldson) will become Queen Mary upon Queen Margrethe's abdication. No other titles will change.\n\nThere were some title changes last year, however; As of January 1, 2023, four of Queen Margrethe's grandchildren—the children of her second son, Prince Joachim—no longer had the \"prince and princess\" title. (They remain in the line of succession.)"
