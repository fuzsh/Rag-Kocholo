Filled with history, stunning landscapes, breathtaking architecture, and diverse cultures, Europe offers experiences that last a lifetime.\n\nApart from cultural immersion, Europe offers tons of educational and career opportunities. Europe is one of the largest hosts of international students, receiving over a million students yearly. If you plan to study or work in Europe, you’re on the right track!\n\nOne of the most important barriers when it comes to moving abroad is Language! The good news is there are tons of English speaking countries in Europe.\n\nEnglish is one of the dominant languages worldwide, and the same is true for European countries such as Germany, Sweden, Ireland and the Netherlands.\n\nFun fact: English is a West Germanic language that originated in England!\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the top 10 English speaking countries in Europe and the interesting range of opportunities they offer in terms of education and career.\n\nLet’s begin!\n\nList of English Speaking Countries in Europe 2024\n\nEvery region of Europe has its own official language. However, due to Europe’s active global involvement in providing international education and career opportunities for people worldwide, English is one of the primary languages.\n\nThe EF English Proficiency Index recently released a list of 113 countries, ranking them based on their English proficiency. Undoubtedly, European countries dominated the list of the top 50, with most of them ranking under the top 10.\n\nBelow is a list of the best English speaking countries in Europe!\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nThe Netherlands has been placed at the top of the list by the EF English Proficiency Index 2023 for a reason! 90-93% of the Dutch can speak excellent English, making blending in with the locals incredibly easy.\n\nThe Netherlands has a thriving economy and is home to many Multinational companies. The Netherlands is also a picturesque country, attracting thousands of tourists every year. Undeniably, these factors have influenced the English language proficiency of the Dutch.\n\nAustria\n\nAustria lies at the heart of Europe and is known for the incredible quality of life it offers. The country has historic castles, majestic palaces, and splendid gardens. Though German is the country’s national language, Austrians speak fluent English.\n\nAustrians learn English as early as in school, making it one of the best English speaking countries in Europe.\n\nDenmark\n\nDenmark is a part of the Scandinavian region of Europe, and full of scenic beauty! Over 86% of Denmark’s population can speak English. Therefore, it’s easy to live in Denmark as an international student or traveller.\n\nDenmark has one of the strongest economies in the world, and its education system has an international reputation. Known for its innovation and open, art-of-state research facilities, Denmark is truly a country that has it all.\n\nNorway\n\nNorway is known for its natural beauty. The official language of Norway is Norwegian. However, they still use English as their second language, which is why it makes it to our list of best English speaking countries in Europe!\n\nNorway welcomes students and tourists from all over the world and naturally has over 4 million English speakers! The country is bustling with career opportunities for foreigners.\n\nSweden\n\nSweden stands as one of the world’s most picturesque countries and is full of scenic beauty and friendly wildlife. Sweden is a tourist hub but is also especially important for its thriving global community and education system.\n\nSweden is increasingly connected with the world through businesses and education. As an influence, Sweden’s population has excellent English proficiency and was ranked 6 (out of 113 countries in the world) by EF EPI 2023.\n\nHere’s a list of the Top 15 English Speaking Countries in Europe\n\nEnglish Speaking Countries in Europe for International Students\n\nEurope is a great study destination and is full of high-ranking universities offering plenty of English courses. Europe welcomes millions of students worldwide every year, with the UK being the most popular European country for international students, especially Indians.\n\nEurope is home to some of the oldest universities in the world, such as Oxford University (UK), University of Cambridge (UK), Sorbonne University (France), and University of Heidelberg (Germany).\n\nEuropean universities are known for their quality education and offer some of the best technologies, equal learning opportunities for all students, well-rounded curriculums, and innovative learning strategies!\n\nSome European regions, such as Norway, Denmark and Finland, are particularly affordable for international students.\n\nBelow is a list of top countries in Europe for studies.\n\nTop Universities in Europe for International Students\n\nUniversities in Europe dominate the list of top universities in the world. European universities not only provide an excellent standard of education and internationally recognised degrees but also have exceptional employment outcomes.\n\nThough English is widely spoken throughout the continent, it’s important to understand that countries like France, Norway, and Germany prioritise their national languages along with English. Therefore, some of these universities may have fewer English-taught courses.\n\nEuropean universities accept students in two or three intakes, typically in September, January and May.\n\nTo get into European universities, you must exhibit good English proficiency. During the admissions, you must provide proof of your language proficiency. Most countries also need your language proficiency scores for Visa purposes.\n\nIELTS is a commonly accepted English proficiency test. Some countries also accept TOEFL, Duolingo, and PTE. The IELTS score requirement for undergraduate courses is 6, and for postgraduate courses, you will need a 6.5. This can vary depending on the university and your course.\n\nAlso Read: IELTS Score for UK\n\nHere’s a list of the top 10 universities in Europe.\n\nWant to explore your study options in the UK and Ireland?
