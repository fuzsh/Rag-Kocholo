        "text": "The first thing newcomers notice about Denmark is that things just seem to work. Streets are clean and bicycle-friendly, locals give directions in near-perfect English, and services from train tickets to healthcare are bilingual and digitised on easy-to-use apps.\n\nYou’ll also see people living well – many clocking off at work before 5PM, spending time together and indulging in meals at a leisurely pace. The Danish way of living is so good it’s basically award-winning – with Denmark routinely ranking as one of the world’s happiest nations, home to some of the world’s most liveable cities.\n\nNestled between central Europe and the Nordics, think of Denmark as a gateway to the best of both worlds. To the south, we share a border with Germany, while our capital, Copenhagen, is only a 20-minute train ride from Sweden.\n\nDenmark isn’t so much one landmass as a collection of islands strung together (which might be why the Danish Vikings got so good at sailing from place to place.) In Denmark, you’ll always be a maximum of 52 kilometres from the sea. And we swim all year round.\n\nWe’ll let you in on a discovery that may not surprise you: happier employees are more efficient. That’s convenient for us in Denmark, where well-being and flexibility are a big part of the culture. Most people in Denmark enjoy a 37.5-hour work week with lots of flexibility and social benefits – and Denmark still has a thriving economy.\n\nIn fact, the job market in Denmark is booming - and we’d love more international talent to come our way! So, if you’re looking for a healthier relationship with work and an exciting new career step, we think you should try Denmark."
