        "text": "With a total area of 10,186,000 km² (3,932,836 mi²), Europe is actually smaller than every other continent except Australia/Oceania. However, it is also one of the most densely populated and contains at least 50 countries (depending upon how one counts) as well as several dependent territories. One of those countries, in fact, is the largest in the world. What are the largest countries in Europe? Let's find out:\n\nTop 10 Largest Countries in Europe (by total area):\n\nThe largest country in Europe is easily Russia, and by a large margin. This ranking is made more impressive by the fact that Russia is a transcontinental country, with land in both Europe and Asia. In fact, in terms of land area, Russia is also the largest country in Asia and also the largest country in the world. Russia’s population is more than 145.9 million people, which puts it in ninth place on the list of the world's most populous countries.\n\nTerritories and transcontinental countries\n\nRussia is not the only country to straddle the line between Europe and Asia. Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cyprus, Turkey, and even Kazakhstan are all considered European by some agencies and Asian by others. When counted as European, Kazakhstan ranks as the second-largest country in Europe at 2,724,900 (1,052,100). Dependent territories are another gray area. Many European countries embraced expansionist policies during the Age of Exploration, and some of those countries oversee external territories to this day. The most relevant of these territories in terms of area is Greenland, whose actual size isn't quite what it appears to be on most maps, but which would still add 2,166,086 km² (836,330 mi²) of area to tiny Denmark 43,094 km² (16,639 mi²). this would make Denmark the second- or third-largest country in Europe (depending upon whether Kazakhstan was included)—despite the fact that Greenland is actually located in North America. However, territories are typically left out of official measurements of a country's area. Europe is also home to many of the world's smallest countries. While most continents include tiny island nations, none but Europe have so many land-locked and/or coastal micronations.\n\nTop 10 Smallest Countries in Europe (by total area):"
