        "text": "The University of Copenhagen has a policy of Danish/English parallel language use. The aim of the language policy is to ensure a good learning environment and a good workplace with fewer language barriers for both staff and students - regardless of language and cultural background. All information on the UCPH website is in both English and Danish. Your contract and your payslips will be in English and any administrative help is available in English. In addition to English, the people working for International Staff Mobility speak several languages, so if you are lucky they can even help you in your own language.\n\nAt your department\n\nThe use of language can vary from one department to another. However, most departments have an international workforce and in your daily work you will be able to express yourself in English. Some departments choose to have staff meetings in Danish, whereas others switch to English if international employees are present. The use of parallel language is managed locally and therefore varies from department to department. You can talk to your colleagues if you have any doubts of how to go about this.\n\nLong-term career\n\nIf you are considering a long-term career at University of Copenhagen you should consider whether your language skills will have an impact on your possibilities. Some departments at The University of Copenhagen will require that you obtain a certain level of Danish.\n\nLanguage policy\n\nThe language policy is a general set of rules for how we work with Danish and English at UCPH. The Board adopted the policy in January 2021, which further expands the University's practice of parallel-language use. You can read more about the ten principles of the language policy if you follow the link below. They describe, among other things, the language skills UCPH expects its staff to have, how to hold meetings when there are non-Danish speaking staff present and how to accommodate an international workplace.\n\nhttps://kunet.ku.dk/employee-guide/Pages/Communication/Language-policy.aspx\n\nDanish courses at the University of Copenhagen; Centre for Internationalisation and Parallel Language Use (CIP)\n\nCIP provides language skills development primarily targeted staff and students at the University of Copenhagen. The majority of the courses are Danish or English courses tailored to meet the needs and language level of the participants. CIP also offer courses in other languages, e.g. German, French or Spanish for staff at the University of Copenhagen upon request.\n\nThese courses come with a fee. Because of the costs assigned to the faculty, department or local institute, you need consent from your manager prior to registration.\n\nYou can find more information about all courses and registration here:https://cip.ku.dk/english/course-catalogue/\n\nCourses in Danish outside UCPH\n\nAs a foreigner with an official Danish address (folkeregisteradresse), you are offered publicly funded Danish lessons. Danish education at recognized language schools is free from 1st July 2020 onwards. You have to pay a fully refundable deposit of DKK 2,000 per person, when you sign up for Danish language lessons.\n\nOfficial Danish language schools in and around Copenhagen:\n\nUCPlus\n\nStudieskolen\n\nSPEAK\n\nPlease be aware of the voucher system regarding free Danish lessons, read more below.\n\nMany other private language schools also offer Danish language lessons, but for those lessons you have to pay fees. As opposed to the recognized schools as exemplified above, the private language schools do not require you have a CPR number in order to sign up for lessons. Moreover, there is no voucher scheme (read more below) or deposit required at the private schools. Please be aware that if you sign up for Danish lessons at some of the private language schools, you will not receive an official licensed diploma, when you finish a module at one of these language schools. If you wish to learn Danish at a private language school that is not recognized at a local municipality in Denmark, please contact them directly.\n\nIf you take Danish language classes at a recognized language school as mentioned above, the lessons are free, but please be aware of the voucher system.\n\nNew citizens in Denmark will receive a letter from the municipality where they take residence in their electronic mailbox (e-Boks) – the so-called referral letter. As soon as possible and no later than one month after receiving the referral letter, you should contact the language school where you wish to begin your Danish lessons, regardless of when you plan to start. The voucher system commences automatically after that amount of time.\n\nThe voucher holds up to six units, each corresponding to one module of Danish language courses, if classes are attended according to schedule.\n\nIt is essential that you familiarize yourself thoroughly with all aspects of the voucher system, in order to understand the consequences of the choices you make. If you want to postpone the start of your Danish language lessons or take a break, the voucher system might still spend your units. In particular, remember to inform your language school if you intend to take breaks in the middle of a module or in between modules.\n\nNote: before 1st July 2020, Danish language classes at recognized schools were not free. Therefore, you may still come across outdated information about fees for publicly funded Danish lessons."
