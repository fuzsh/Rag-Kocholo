        "text": "The Northern European countries are leading the world in terms of digitalization and were one of the first who introduced Internet technologies into trade. The pandemic has only increased the preference for online shopping in this region, so that their level remains consistently high, without booming. More features and trends of e-commerce in Northern Europe in the article.\n\nIn 2023, the total turnover of e-commerce in Northern Europe exceeded 40 billion US dollars. By 2027, it is projected to reach almost 56 billion US dollars.\n\nThe share of Northern Europe in total European e-commerce turnover is 9%. But it does not reflect the level and quality of e-commerce in these countries and is associated with lower population density than in other regions of Europe.\n\nThe recent European Ecommerce Foundation report of 2022 reveals that Northern European countries consistently excel in important e-commerce metrics across Europe. Denmark, for instance, ranks fourth in terms of ease of doing business and takes the lead in e-government development within Europe. Additionally, Sweden boasts the highest Internet penetration rate. Northern European countries, including Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, also demonstrate excellent performance in global logistics, securing spots in the top 10 of the logistics performance index.\n\nNorthern Europe emerges as a frontrunner in internet usage, with a significant share of the population, such as 97% in most countries. In Iceland, the internet adoption rate reaches an impressive 100%. Moreover, this region demonstrates the highest proportion of online shoppers, with approximately 86% of users engaging in online purchasing activities in 2021.\n\nNorthern Europe is notable for having the highest per capita spending among online shoppers. On average, individuals in these countries spend approximately 2045 euros per year. In contrast, the average expenditure of online shoppers across Europe in the previous year was €1,346 and is expected to reach €1,464 by the end of this year.\n\nIn the year 2022, Sweden stood out as the top performer in e-commerce revenue, generating a substantial amount of over US$13 billion. Norway followed closely, generating $8.7 billion, while Denmark recorded $8.1 billion and Finland achieved $6.8 billion in e-commerce revenue.\n\nIn Northern Europe, there is a preference for purchasing from local websites. However, an exception to this trend is observed in Iceland, where buyers are often compelled to show loyalty to sellers from other countries.\n\nDuring the pandemic in 2020, all countries in the region experienced a significant rise in the proportion of online shopping, which was followed by a modest increase in subsequent periods.\n\nIf we evaluate all the e-commerce indicators in the region, the ranking of countries would be as follows:\n\nSweden.\n\nDenmark.\n\nFinland.\n\nNorway.\n\nEstonia.\n\nLithuania.\n\nIceland.\n\nLatvia.\n\nFrom 30 to 60% of consumers in Northern Europe prefer to use a bank card to pay for their online purchases. Electronic wallets come in second place as a popular choice. On the other hand, cash payments constitute a minor share, making up less than 1% of the total.\n\nOver the past few years, in Northern Europe, cashless payments have become very popular among all age groups due to the development of payment systems. The most popular mobile applications for online purchases in 2022 were Swish, Vipps and MobilePay and payment systems Klarna, Trustly, Paysafecard, Zimpler.\n\nIn 2020, Amazon extended its presence to Northern Europe by launching its first store in Sweden. Prior to that, online shoppers in this region mainly placed orders on Amazon in Germany and the UK. Amazon now has a significant user base in Denmark, Finland and Sweden. However, despite Amazon’s presence, Northern Europeans still uphold a preference for shopping on their own respective e-commerce platforms.\n\nAs per eCommerceDB and Statista’s rankings for 2022, the top-3 leading online platforms by countries are:\n\nThe region has a robust C2C (consumer-to-consumer) market, where C2C marketplaces are highly popular among online shoppers in terms of visitor numbers. In Finland, Tori.fi dominates the C2C marketplace, while Finn.no is the leading platform in Norway. In Sweden, Blocket.se holds the top position, and in Denmark, DBA.dk is the most prominent C2C marketplace. These platforms contribute significantly to the thriving C2C market in the region."
