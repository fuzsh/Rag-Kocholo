        "text": "The Kingdom of Denmark has, despite its relatively small size, punched above its weight internationally.\n\nVikings raiding from Denmark and the other Nordic nations changed the course of 9th and 10th Century European history; in the Middle Ages, the Union of Kalmar united all of Scandinavia under Danish leadership.\n\nIn more recent times, Denmark has developed a highly-competitive service-based economy with high employment levels and a generous social security system.\n\nThe Social Democrats led coalition governments for most of the post-war period until the 1980s, consolidating the country's liberal reputation, although concerns at high taxation levels and tension over immigration have put the centre-right in office for several long periods since then.\n\nThe Kingdom of Denmark includes the territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n\nKing Frederik X succeed his mother, Margrethe II, to the Danish throne in January 2024. Margrethe, who reigned for 52 years, became the first Danish monarch to voluntarily abdicate in over 800 years.\n\nIn his first speech to Danes, King Frederik said his task of becoming \"a unifying king of tomorrow\" was something he had approached all of his life.\n\n\"It's a task I've taken on with pride, respect and joy.\"\n\nQueen Margrethe became monarch only because a change in the law in 1953 allowed a woman to ascend to the throne. She succeeded on the death of her father, King Frederik IX, in 1972.\n\nPrime Minister: Mette Frederiksen\n\nSocial Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen led her party back to power in the June 2019 general election, ending four years of centre-right rule.\n\nShe campaigned on a combination of traditional centre-left calls for stronger welfare policies, combined with a promise to be tough on immigration.\n\nShe took over the party leadership in 2015, when her predecessor and Denmark's first woman prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, lost power.\n\nTaking office at the age of 41, she is the youngest prime minister in Danish history."
