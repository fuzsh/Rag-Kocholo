        "text": "Denmark has been an active member of the EU since 1973. Denmark has worked for an efficient and well functioning internal market, transparent decision-making, and clear and visible results for the individual citizens.\n\nDenmark will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union during the second half of 2025. Information about the Danish priorities and programme will follow. Member states holding the presidency work together closely in groups of three, called 'trios'. Denmark will hold the trio together with Poland and Cyprus"
