        "text": "Central Denmark EU Office – the Central Danish gateway to the EU\n\nAt Central Denmark EU Office, we work hard to make sure that the Central Denmark Region along with\n\nits 19 municipalities, Aarhus University and VIA University College play an active part in the EU, thus\n\nmaximizing the outcome of the many opportunities that the EU-cooperation presents.\n\nWe have brought home close to 100 million euros in funding\n\nWe facilitate collaboration between Central Danish institutions and their counterparts abroad in order to\n\nboost innovation and cooperation across borders. Furthermore, since 2007, we have helped to bring home close to 100 million euros in EU-funding to directly benefit enterprises, organizations and higher learning institutions in the Central Denmark Region. But funding is just one side of the successful story.\n\nNetworking is key\n\nFrom our office in the heart of Brussels, we continue to expand and deepen our network within the EU,\n\nthereby staying updated on the newest developments regarding e.g. EU-funding and structural changes\n\nthat might influence a given area of policy. In this way, we can help all of our collaborators in Central Denmark gain that all-important early knowledge that is often essential when wanting to seek funding or find the right European partners.\n\nWe help companies and institutions to make their voice heard\n\nWe also help Central Danish companies and institutions to make their voice heard in the EU, thereby hopefully inspiring others.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, two of the female founders behind the Central Danish start-up CAPSULE were invited to Brussels to speak about being a female entrepreneur in tech at a European conference on entrepreneurship and skills,\n\nYou can read the whole story on the link right here:\n\nCAPSULE: Female entrepreneurs went to Brussels to inspire others.\n\nOur door is always open\n\nWe very regularly welcome visitor’s groups wishing to learn more about the EU and our work for Central\n\nDenmark abroad, leading to hundreds of visitors at our Brussels office each year from a wide range of\n\nhigher education institutions, municipalities and organisations.\n\nIf you would like to get in touch, you will find the contact info of all of our consultantes right here.\n\nA little geography\n\nThe Central Danish region comprises the central part of Jutland from coast to coast and is home to\n\nAarhus, which is the second largest city in Denmark.\n\nKey areas of work within the Central Denmark Region"
