        "text": "Groundwater-Flow Simulations\n\nGiven the complex nature of the Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer and multiple potential hydrologic stressors in the system (for example, groundwater pumping and groundwater and surface-water interactions) it was necessary to apply a groundwater-flow model to simulate and predict groundwater movement. In this setting, a groundwater-flow model may be used to evaluate conceptual groundwater recharge models and discharge sources, quantify changing groundwater budgets under transient conditions, and quantitatively predict groundwater-flow paths. A numerical groundwater-flow model was constructed for the Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer using the finite-difference code MODFLOW with the Newton formulation solver (MODFLOW-NWT; Niswonger and others, 2011). The model was spatially discretized into individual cells whose size and properties were specified through user input, with user-specified time steps for temporal discretization of the MODFLOW model. Discretization of the groundwater-flow model and application of boundary conditions are described in detail in the following paragraphs and illustrated in figure 5. The numerical groundwater-flow model and all associated input files are included as a USGS data release associated with this report (Russell and Newman, 2024).\n\nThe numerical model of the Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer has 1 layer of 291 rows and 254 columns of 200-ft by 200-ft size cells, with a total of 17,610 active cells (fig. 5). A one-layer model was used because the alluvium overlies Upper Cretaceous Pierre Shale with low permeability, which serves as a vertical no-flow boundary for the groundwater-flow system. The model grid was projected and aligned relative to the Colorado State Plane Coordinate System (North American Datum of 1983, units: feet, zone: Colorado Central Zone).\n\nThe active model grid extent was based on the extent of the Quaternary alluvium deposits that compose the Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer. The active extent of the model grid did not include the paleochannels present to the northeast of the primary aquifer. The paleochannels were excluded because of transient unsaturated conditions and thin saturated thickness, as indicated by groundwater-level monitoring, though these paleochannels may be dominant sources of chemical constituents to the aquifer (Newman and others, 2021). To evaluate groundwater flow from the paleochannels, the General-Head Boundary (GHB) package (Harbaugh and others, 2000) was used to represent flow originating in the Broadway and Windmill Gulch paleochannels.\n\nThe model simulates time periods as model stress periods, and during each model stress period, hydrologic stressors were specified and held constant for the stress period duration. The Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer model contains 241 stress periods. Of these 241 stress periods, the initial stress period represents a steady state period, and the other 240 stress periods were transient, simulating each month from 2000 to 2019. For the initial stress period of the numerical model, hydrologic stressors and groundwater-flow rates were assumed to be constant, and the stress period represents mean annual data throughout the transient stress periods. The outputs from the steady-state model stress period were used as inputs for the subsequent transient stress period.\n\nThe Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer system numerical groundwater-flow model is composed of multiple hydrologic boundaries representing areas of inflow or outflow. These hydrologic boundaries were simulated through MODFLOW packages (fig. 5). The hydrologic boundaries simulated in this numerical model were separated into two different types: head-dependent and specified-flux boundaries. Head-dependent boundaries allow flow into or out of the model based on differences between user-specified groundwater levels. Specified-flux boundaries allow flow into or out of the model based on user-specified flux rates. Recharge and well withdrawals were simulated in the model using specified-flux boundaries, and evapotranspiration, streams, reservoirs, and lateral groundwater flow were simulated using head-dependent boundaries.\n\nRecharge for the numerical model was simulated using the Recharge (RCH) package (Harbaugh and others, 2000) and precipitation data from the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset from Oregon State University (PRISM Climate Group, 2020). The PRISM data were modified using the ArcGIS Resample tool (Esri, 2021), which interpolated the precipitation data to fit the model grid cell size. Distributed recharge is caused by infiltration of precipitation (rain and snow) into the aquifer system. The amount of water infiltrating the land surface is affected by several factors, such as precipitation rates, evapotranspiration rates, unsaturated-zone permeability and moisture capacity, and land surface slope; therefore, only a fraction of the amount of precipitation from the PRISM dataset recharges the aquifer. This fraction is applied to the recharge arrays as a multiplier for each simulated stress period.\n\nTo determine the recharge amount applied to the aquifer, the RORA program (Rutledge, 2000) was applied to USGS streamgage streamflow data from the NWIS database (USGS, 2021) throughout and nearby the active model area. RORA is a program that estimates recharge for the drainage basin of a specified streamgage using a recession-curve displacement method. This method uses the upward displacement of the streamflow-recession curve during groundwater recharge periods, such as storms, to determine the rate of groundwater recharge to an idealized, homogenous aquifer (Rutledge, 2000). Estimation of recharge using the RORA program differs from the point estimates of recharge used as inputs to the TFN model because RORA estimates spatially integrated recharge rates for a drainage basin above a streamgage, whereas point estimates of recharge at wells used in the TFN model are not spatially integrated but vary through time. The RORA program was used for 11 USGS streamgages from 2000 to 2019 (fig. 5). The recharge estimates output by RORA ranged from 2.14 to 3.47 inches per year (in/yr). These outputs were then weighted based on the basin size and period of record of the streamflow data, with the mean weighted estimate of recharge being 2.53 in/yr, or about 13.72 percent of the mean annual precipitation (18.48 in/yr) from the PRISM dataset. The recharge multipliers within the recharge package were constrained so recharge for the numerical model would not deviate too far from the mean weighted estimate of recharge, with a final mean annual recharge rate of 2.68 in/yr used for the numerical model transient stress periods.\n\nEvapotranspiration is the process by which water is directly transferred into the atmosphere through evaporation and through plant transpiration; evapotranspiration represents a water-budget outflow from the alluvial aquifer. The Evapotranspiration (EVT) package (Harbaugh and others, 2000) was used to simulate this process in the numerical model. Evapotranspiration within the model was limited to cells with cottonwood trees identified based on satellite imagery from Google Earth (Russell and Newman, 2024) and found mostly along the main reach of Fountain Creek (fig. 5). A simulated root-zone depth of 0.40 ft was used, and the simulated ET rate varied each month based on seasonal ET rates from remotely sensed imagery showing cottonwood trees in the lower Colorado River Basin by Jetton (2008).\n\nGiven the evidence of groundwater and surface-water interactions in the aquifer as indicated by previous studies (Edelmann and Cain, 1985; Cain and Edelmann, 1986; Lewis, 1995), it is hypothesized streamflow losses may be a substantial groundwater recharge source. A detailed water-quality analysis of groundwater and surface water, carried out in conjunction with this study, indicated wells near Fountain Creek displayed water-quality signatures consistent with streamflow recharge (Newman and others, 2021). To evaluate exchanges between groundwater and surface water, streams within the active model area were simulated using the Streamflow-Routing (SFR) (Niswonger and Prudic, 2005), the Drain (DRN) and the River (RIV) (Harbaugh and others, 2000) packages. Concrete-lined streams within the active model area, as shown on satellite imagery from Google Earth (Russell and Newman, 2024), were not simulated, as the concrete acts as an impermeable boundary between the stream and the underlying aquifer. An example of a concrete-lined stream not simulated as interacting with the aquifer is Windmill Gulch between Canal 4 and Fountain Creek (fig. 1). The main reach of Fountain Creek and its tributaries were simulated using the SFR package. The SFR package uses Darcy’s Law, streambed conductance, groundwater-table elevation, and stream stage to determine flow between the stream and the surrounding aquifer. Specified inflows within the SFR package allow for base flows from tributaries outside the model active area to be incorporated into the model, allowing for more accurate simulated streamflows. SFR calculates the simulated base flows along specified segments and routes the base flows downstream until they were outside of the active model area or captured by a different hydrologic boundary.\n\nAll SFR stream segments had a thickness of 1.0 ft and a Manning’s roughness coefficient of 0.025, based on common assumptions for the SFR package (Niswonger and Prudic, 2005). Streambed conductivity for each stream segment ranged from 0.01 to 50.0 ft/d. This wide range of conductivity is because of the Pierre Shale outcropping in some parts of the stream, whereas the rest of the streambed is predominantly fine to coarse sand. Simulated stream widths ranged from 20.0 to 95.0 ft and were estimated using satellite imagery from Google Earth (Russell and Newman, 2024). Streambed elevations were modified using USGS 5-meter digital elevation model values to allow for accurate simulated base flows (USGS, 2020). Monthly base flow inflows from outside the active model area included Fountain Creek, Shooks Run, Spring Creek, Sand Creek, B Ditch Drain, and Clover Ditch and were input using the SFR package. Data gaps in the monthly base flow data were filled with the mean base flow for the corresponding month and location. The main reach of Fountain Creek has several points of artificial inflows and diversions (Kuhn and Arnold, 2006). However, these points were not simulated in the numerical model, because they were determined to be minor components of the water budget.\n\nThe SFR package routes flow downstream to connected stream reaches. Because of this functionality, streams can only be simulated within the package if the upstream reaches were higher than or equal in elevation to the downstream reaches. This elevation requirement can cause an issue with artificial canals, such as Canal 4. Therefore, the canals and other streams not included in the SFR package were simulated using the DRN and RIV packages (fig. 5). The difference between the two packages is the RIV package allows for flow into and out of the groundwater systems to a simulated surface-water feature, whereas the DRN package only allows for outflow from the groundwater system to the simulated surface-water feature. Flow between the aquifer and surface-water features in the RIV package is dependent on stage of the surface-water feature, hydraulic conductivity of the feature-aquifer interconnection, and the head at the node in the cell underlying the surface-water feature. Flow in the DRN package is dependent on the feature’s conductance, elevation, and head in the cell. Flow from the aquifer into the drain feature will only be simulated if the head in the drain cell is above the drain elevation. Because the DRN package only allows for flow out of the aquifer and into surface-water features, the RIV package was predominantly used for streams and canals. However, in areas where the numerical model experienced hydraulic heads above land surface, the DRN package was implemented.\n\nAll the RIV and DRN package cells were channelized, meaning the cell elevations were set below land surface to simulate a stream channel. For the RIV package, the cell elevations were set to 4 ft below land surface, and the DRN package cell elevations were typically set to 1.0 ft above the bottom of the model (representing the interface between the alluvial aquifer and the Pierre Shale). The DRN cells have the potential to remove water from the alluvial aquifer based on the gradient between the aquifer and DRN in each cell location. However, because the aquifer is typically thin in the vicinity of most DRN cells (AECOM, 2017), the DRN package is limited in its ability to cause unrealistic water budget outflows from the model. The ability for the RIV and DRN packages to transmit water is governed by hydraulic conductivity values. The hydraulic conductivity values for the RIV package varied based on location and ranged from 107 to 17,500 feet per day (ft/d). The hydraulic conductivity values for the DRN package also varied based on location and ranged from 2,978 to 44,800 ft/d. For the RIV package, a stage elevation of 1.0 ft above the streambed was set for all simulated streams.\n\nLateral inflows into the model from external water sources (Big Johnson Reservoir and the Broadway and Windmill Gulch paleochannels) were simulated using the GHB package (Harbaugh and others, 2000). Flow between the GHB and aquifer is the product of hydraulic conductivity of the boundary and the difference between the head in the aquifer and head in the GHB. Big Johnson Reservoir, an approximately 300-acre artificial lake and one of the major surface-water features in the active model area (fig. 5), was simulated using a GHB head of 5,800 ft and a hydraulic conductivity of 15.0 ft/d. Water-quality data indicated leakage from Big Johnson Reservoir may recharge the aquifer (Newman and others, 2021). Although water levels in Big Johnson Reservoir declined beginning in 2016 when draining the reservoir began for repairs (Steiner, 2017), noble gas data in groundwater from wells downgradient from the reservoir indicated recent equilibrium with the atmosphere, whereas other nearby groundwater wells did not (Newman and others, 2021). Recent atmospheric equilibrium indicates the reservoir is a source of recharge to the aquifer.\n\nLateral inflow and outflow were other substantial components of the modeled water budget, because the paleochannels were not directly simulated in the active model area and because the alluvial aquifer continues to the south, outside of the active model domain. Groundwater flow from paleochannels to the part of the aquifer simulated in the numerical model was simulated using several GHBs (fig. 5), and a GHB was used to represent the southern end of the model domain. Based on a previous water budget for the aquifer, Edelmann and Cain (1985) found groundwater flow likely exits the study area to the south. Head elevations for the GHBs were set using data from nearby USGS groundwater-level observation wells 384653104451901 and 383952104405601. The monthly means of observed groundwater levels, recorded in feet below land surface for 384653104451901 were used for the GHB heads in the Broadway and Windmill Gulch paleochannels, and the monthly means of observed groundwater levels for 383952104405601 were used for the GHB heads at the southern boundary. Hydraulic conductivity of 15.0 ft/d was used, and model inputs were compiled into the GHB package (Russell and Newman, 2024).\n\nA primary hydrologic stressor in the Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer is groundwater pumping for municipal use. Several water-supply districts in the area operated pumping wells, prior to the PFAS compounds discovery (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2018a; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2018b; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 2018c; McDonough and others, 2021). The distribution of 38 known pumping wells in the study area is illustrated in figure 6A, along with reported groundwater pumpage through time (fig. 6B). Groundwater pumping data are included in the data release associated with this study (Russell and Newman, 2024). Most pumping wells were located in the central part of the alluvial aquifer, near Fountain Creek. Total groundwater pumpage, for 2000 to 2018 (fig. 6B) varied, but trends in specific water-supply districts are apparent, with groundwater pumpage from the Security district decreasing beginning in 2013, coinciding with an increase in pumping from the Widefield district. The effect of groundwater pumping on specific wells was assessed via the TFN groundwater-level model (as discussed in the “Groundwater Hydrology” section of this report), and the variation in groundwater pumping was used to inform the transient calibration of the groundwater-flow model, as described in the next paragraph. Groundwater pumping wells were simulated in the model using the Well (WEL) package (Harbaugh and others, 2000). The mean value of all well pumping during the transient stress period was used in the steady-state stress period.\n\nFollowing initial parameterization, the numerical model was calibrated to achieve better agreement between groundwater-level observations and base flows. This model calibration process includes manual and automated calibration steps. Manual calibration was done by changing input parameter values until a user specified and subjective reasonable fit for groundwater-level elevations was achieved, after which automated calibration using computer programs was used to complete the calibration process based on quantitative criteria. The computer programs used in the automated calibration step continuously change user-specified parameters to minimize the differences between simulated and observed groundwater-level elevations and base flows. These user-specified parameters were set within a predetermined range that conceptually match the properties of the Fountain Creek alluvial aquifer. To complete this parameter estimation, the program PEST++ iterative ensemble smoother (PEST++IES) was used, which applies an iterative ensemble smoother algorithm to minimize a user-defined objective function that describes discrepancies between the model simulations and observations (White and others, 2020).\n\nThe automated calibration process for the alluvial aquifer used groups of input parameters and groups of observations. Input parameters were split into 8 groups of 477 total parameters, and observations were split into 5 groups of 2,100 total observations. Of the 477 parameters, there were 241 parameters for recharge, 93 parameters for horizontal hydraulic conductivity (Kh), 93 parameters for the vertical to horizontal hydraulic conductivity ratio (Kv/h), 21 parameters for SFR streambed conductance, 14 parameters for ET, 4 parameters for SFR stream widths, 4 parameters for RIV riverbed conductance, 3 parameters for GHB conductance, and 1 parameter each for Ss, Sy, SFR stream thickness, and DRN conductance. The recharge parameters were multipliers applied to each recharge array for every stress period within the numerical model, and the range of the recharge multipliers were limited to only allow realistic rates of recharge to the simulated groundwater system. The 93 parameters for Kh were evenly spaced points throughout the active model domain using a pilot points approach (Doherty, 2003), and the range of Kh was based on aquifer testing data collected as part of this study. The 93 parameters for Kv/h were fixed, meaning they were not changed during the automated calibration process. Most ET parameters were multipliers (13 of 14) used similarly to recharge array multipliers. Twelve of the multipliers represented monthly ET rates, and the other multiplier represented the ET rate for the steady-state stress period of the numerical model. The last evapotranspiration parameter adjusted the root-zone depth in the EVT package. All boundary conductance parameters were limited to realistic boundary conductance values calculated using K values and area of model cells.\n\nOf the 2,100 total observations used in the automated calibration process, 1,136 groundwater-level elevation were observations from 42 wells and 964 were base flow observations from 4 USGS streamgages (Fountain Creek below Janitell Road below Colorado Springs, CO, 07105530; Sand Creek above Mouth at Colorado Springs, CO, 07105600; Fountain Creek at Security, CO, 07105800; and Clover Ditch Drain near Widefield, CO, 07105820; fig. 5). All groundwater-level elevation data were retrieved from the USGS NWIS database (USGS, 2021). The 964 base flow observations were obtained from the USGS NWIS database and processed using the USGS Groundwater Toolbox (Barlow and others, 2017). Base flow was estimated for the two streamgages located along Fountain Creek (07105530 and 07105800; fig. 5) throughout the entire transient stress period of the numerical model, 2000–19. Base flow was estimated for the streamgage along Sand Creek (07105600) seasonally for the months April–September between 2003 and 2014 and transitioned to estimates for each month throughout the year between 2014 and 2019. Base flow was estimated monthly for the streamgage along Clover Ditch Drain (07105820) beginning in November 2017 and extending through 2019. Any periods of missing base flow estimates were filled with the mean monthly base flow for the site using the available data (USGS, 2021). Most of the streamflow measurements made at these streamgages, during the transient period of the numerical model, were rated as fair by the hydrographer conducting the measurement, meaning streamflow measurements were within 8 percent of true streamflow (Turnipseed and Sauer, 2010).\n\nThese observations were categorized into five groups, one group for the groundwater-level elevation observations and a separate group for each of the four streamgages. The contribution of the observation groups to the objective function were adjusted to maintain a balance between the observation groups during the calibration process. The base flow observations accounted for 81 percent of the observation group contribution to the objective function, meaning the model was most sensitive to changes in base flow.\n\nThe ability of the model to emulate observed groundwater-level elevations was assessed quantitatively using the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and the normalized RMSE (nRMSE) calculated according to\n\nwhere and where\n\nThe RMSE and nRMSE were useful model calibration indicators, because they quantitatively indicate the ability of the model to simulate the hydrologic system. The calibration goal is to reduce both the RMSE and nRMSE. An nRMSE less than or equal to 10 percent is generally considered to represent a well-calibrated model (Anderson and others, 2015). All results of model calibration and simulations are described in the “Groundwater-Flow Simulations” section of this report."
