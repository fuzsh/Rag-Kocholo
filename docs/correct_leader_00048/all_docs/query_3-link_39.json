        "meta_description": "Abstract. This study aims to understand the hydrologic responses to wildfires in\nmountainous regions at various spatial scales. The Soil and Water Assessment\nToolÂ (SWAT) was used to evaluate the hydrologic responses of the upper Cache la\nPoudre Watershed in Colorado to the 2012Â High Park and Hewlett wildfire\nevents. A baseline SWAT model was established to simulate the hydrology of\nthe study area between the yearsÂ 2000 andÂ 2014. A procedure involving land\nuse and curve number updating was implemented to assess the effects of\nwildfires. Application of the proposed procedure provides the ability to\nsimulate the hydrologic response to wildfires seamlessly through mimicking\nthe dynamic of the changes due to wildfires. The wildfire effects on curve\nnumbers were determined comparing the probability distribution of curve\nnumbers after calibrating the model for pre- and post-wildfire conditions.\nDaily calibration and testing of the model produced âvery goodâ results.\nNo-wildfire and wildfire scenarios were created and compared to quantify\nchanges in average annual total runoff volume, water budgets, and full\nstreamflow statistics at different spatial scales. At the watershed scale,\nwildfire conditions showed little impact on the hydrologic responses.\nHowever, a runoff increase up to 75â% was observed between the scenarios in\nsub-watersheds with high burn intensity. Generally, higher surface runoff and\ndecreased subsurface flow were observed under post-wildfire conditions.\nFlow duration curves developed for burned sub-watersheds using full\nstreamflow statistics showed that less frequent streamflows become greater in\nmagnitude. A linear regression model was developed to assess the relationship\nbetween percent burned area and runoff increase in Cache la Poudre Watershed.\nA strong (R2â>â0.8) and significant (pâ<â0.001) positive\ncorrelation was determined between runoff increase and percentage of burned\narea upstream. This study showed that the effects of wildfires on hydrology\nof a watershed are scale-dependent. Also, using full streamflow statistics\nthrough application of flow duration curves revealed that the wildfires had a\nhigher effect on peak flows, which may increase the risk of flash floods in\npost-wildfire conditions.",

From the multitude of methods that have been developed for this so-called hydrograph separation, a specific, frequently used one is singled out here. It is shown to be derived from plausible physical principles.

It is, however, not yet highly accessible to many students of hydrology in Central Asia. One big hurdle for new learners is the preparation of relevant data prior to the actual modelling.

Sci., 27, 191–212, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-191-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-191-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPatchy snow cover during spring impacts mountainous ecosystems on a large range of spatio-temporal scales. A hydrological model simulated such snow patchiness at 10 m resolution. Slope and orientation controls precipitation, radiation, and wind generate differences in snowmelt, subsurface storage, streamflow, and evapotranspiration. The snow patchiness increases the duration of the snowmelt to stream and subsurface storage, which sustains the plants and streamflow later in the summer.\n\nTechnical note: Extending the SWAT model to transport chemicals through tile and groundwater flow\n\nHendrik Rathjens, Jens Kiesel, Michael Winchell, Jeffrey Arnold, and Robin Sur\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 159–167, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-159-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-159-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe SWAT model can simulate the transport of water-soluble chemicals through the landscape but neglects the transport through groundwater or agricultural tile drains. These transport pathways are, however, important to assess the amount of chemicals in streams. We added this capability to the model, which significantly improved the simulation. The representation of all transport pathways in the model enables watershed managers to develop robust strategies for reducing chemicals in streams.\n\nLong-term reconstruction of satellite-based precipitation, soil moisture, and snow water equivalent in China\n\nWencong Yang, Hanbo Yang, Changming Li, Taihua Wang, Ziwei Liu, Qingfang Hu, and Dawen Yang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6427–6441, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6427-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6427-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe produced a daily 0.1° dataset of precipitation, soil moisture, and snow water equivalent in 1981–2017 across China via reconstructions. The dataset used global background data and local on-site data as forcing input and satellite-based data as reconstruction benchmarks. This long-term high-resolution national hydrological dataset is valuable for national investigations of hydrological processes.\n\nDisentangling scatter in long-term concentrationâdischarge relationships: the role of event types\n\nFelipe A. Saavedra, Andreas Musolff, Jana von Freyberg, Ralf Merz, Stefano Basso, and Larisa Tarasova\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6227–6245, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6227-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6227-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrate contamination of rivers from agricultural sources is a challenge for water quality management. During runoff events, different transport paths within the catchment might be activated, generating a variety of responses in nitrate concentration in stream water. Using nitrate samples from 184 German catchments and a runoff event classification, we show that hydrologic connectivity during runoff events is a key control of nitrate transport from catchments to streams in our study domain.\n\nSimulating the hydrological impacts of land use conversion from annual crop to perennial forage in the Canadian Prairies using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform\n\nMarcos R. C. Cordeiro, Kang Liang, Henry F. Wilson, Jason Vanrobaeys, David A. Lobb, Xing Fang, and John W. Pomeroy\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5917–5931, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5917-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5917-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study addresses the issue of increasing interest in the hydrological impacts of converting cropland to perennial forage cover in the Canadian Prairies. By developing customized models using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling (CRHM) platform, this long-term (1992–2013) modelling study is expected to provide stakeholders with science-based information regarding the hydrological impacts of land use conversion from annual crop to perennial forage cover in the Canadian Prairies.\n\nHow can we benefit from regime information to make more effective use of long short-term memory (LSTM) runoff models?\n\nReyhaneh Hashemi, Pierre Brigode, Pierre-AndrÃ© Garambois, and Pierre Javelle\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5793–5816, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5793-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5793-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrologists have long dreamed of a tool that could adequately predict runoff in catchments. Data-driven long short-term memory (LSTM) models appear very promising to the hydrology community in this respect. Here, we have sought to benefit from traditional practices in hydrology to improve the effectiveness of LSTM models. We discovered that one LSTM parameter has a hydrologic interpretation and that there is a need to increase the data and to tune two parameters, thereby improving predictions.\n\nOn the value of satellite remote sensing to reduce uncertainties of regional simulations of the Colorado River\n\nMu Xiao, Giuseppe Mascaro, Zhaocheng Wang, Kristen M. Whitney, and Enrique R. Vivoni\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5627–5646, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5627-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5627-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs the major water resource in the southwestern United States, the Colorado River is experiencing decreases in naturalized streamflow and is predicted to face severe challenges under future climate scenarios. Here, we demonstrate the value of Earth observing satellites to improve and build confidence in the spatiotemporal simulations from regional hydrologic models for assessing the sensitivity of the Colorado River to climate change and supporting regional water managers.\n\nAssessing runoff sensitivity of North American Prairie Pothole Region basins to wetland drainage using a basin classification-based virtual modelling approach\n\nChristopher Spence, Zhihua He, Kevin R. Shook, John W. Pomeroy, Colin J. Whitfield, and Jared D. Wolfe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5555–5575, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5555-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5555-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe learnt how streamflow from small creeks could be altered by wetland removal in the Canadian Prairies, where this practice is pervasive. Every creek basin in the region was placed into one of seven groups. We selected one of these groups and used its traits to simulate streamflow. The model worked well enough so that we could trust the results even if we removed the wetlands. Wetland removal did not change low flow amounts very much, but it doubled high flow and tripled average flow.\n\nA large-sample investigation into uncertain climate change impacts on high flows across Great Britain\n\nRosanna A. Lane, Gemma Coxon, Jim Freer, Jan Seibert, and Thorsten Wagener\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5535–5554, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5535-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5535-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study modelled the impact of climate change on river high flows across Great Britain (GB). Generally, results indicated an increase in the magnitude and frequency of high flows along the west coast of GB by 2050–2075. In contrast, average flows decreased across GB. All flow projections contained large uncertainties; the climate projections were the largest source of uncertainty overall but hydrological modelling uncertainties were considerable in some regions.\n\nEffects of passive-storage conceptualization on modeling hydrological function and isotope dynamics in the flow system of a cockpit karst landscape\n\nGuangxuan Li, Xi Chen, Zhicai Zhang, Lichun Wang, and Chris Soulsby\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5515–5534, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5515-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5515-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a coupled flow–tracer model to understand the effects of passive storage on modeling hydrological function and isotope dynamics in a karst flow system. Models with passive storages show improvement in matching isotope dynamics performance, and the improved performance also strongly depends on the number and location of passive storages. Our results also suggested that the solute transport is primarily controlled by advection and hydrodynamic dispersion in the steep hillslope unit.\n\nTechnical note: Data assimilation and autoregression for using near-real-time streamflow observations in long short-term memory networks\n\nGrey S. Nearing, Daniel Klotz, Jonathan M. Frame, Martin Gauch, Oren Gilon, Frederik Kratzert, Alden Keefe Sampson, Guy Shalev, and Sella Nevo\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5493–5513, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5493-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5493-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen designing flood forecasting models, it is necessary to use all available data to achieve the most accurate predictions possible. This manuscript explores two basic ways of ingesting near-real-time streamflow data into machine learning streamflow models. The point we want to make is that when working in the context of machine learning (instead of traditional hydrology models that are based on bio-geophysics), it is not necessary to use complex statistical methods for injecting sparse data.\n\nAttribution of climate change and human activities to streamflow variations with a posterior distribution of hydrological simulations\n\nXiongpeng Tang, Guobin Fu, Silong Zhang, Chao Gao, Guoqing Wang, Zhenxin Bao, Yanli Liu, Cuishan Liu, and Junliang Jin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5315–5339, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5315-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5315-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we proposed a new framework that considered the uncertainties of model simulations in quantifying the contribution rate of climate change and human activities to streamflow changes. Then, the Lancang River basin was selected for the case study. The results of quantitative analysis using the new framework showed that the reason for the decrease in the streamflow at Yunjinghong station was mainly human activities.\n\nA time-varying distributed unit hydrograph method considering soil moisture\n\nBin Yi, Lu Chen, Hansong Zhang, Vijay P. Singh, Ping Jiang, Yizhuo Liu, Hexiang Guo, and Hongya Qiu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5269–5289, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5269-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5269-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn improved GIS-derived distributed unit hydrograph routing method considering time-varying soil moisture was proposed for flow routing. The method considered the changes of time-varying soil moisture and rainfall intensity. The response of underlying surface to the soil moisture content was considered an important factor in this study. The SUH, DUH, TDUH and proposed routing methods (TDUH-MC) were used for flood forecasts, and the simulated results were compared and discussed.\n\nFlood patterns in a catchment with mixed bedrock geology and a hilly landscape: identification of flashy runoff contributions during storm events\n\nAudrey Douinot, Jean FranÃ§ois Iffly, Cyrille Tailliez, Claude Meisch, and Laurent Pfister\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5185–5206, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5185-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5185-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe objective of the paper is to highlight the seasonal and singular shift of the transfer time distributions of two catchments (≅10 km2). Based on 2 years of rainfall and discharge observations, we compare variations in the properties of TTDs with the physiographic characteristics of catchment areas and the eco-hydrological cycle. The paper eventually aims to deduce several factors conducive to particularly rapid and concentrated water transfers, which leads to flash floods.\n\nA graph neural network (GNN) approach to basin-scale river network learning: the role of physics-based connectivity and data fusion\n\nAlexander Y. Sun, Peishi Jiang, Zong-Liang Yang, Yangxinyu Xie, and Xingyuan Chen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5163–5184, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5163-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5163-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHigh-resolution river modeling is of great interest to local governments and stakeholders for flood-hazard mitigation. This work presents a physics-guided, machine learning (ML) framework for combining the strengths of high-resolution process-based river network models with a graph-based ML model capable of modeling spatiotemporal processes. Results show that the ML model can approximate the dynamics of the process model with high fidelity, and data fusion further improves the forecasting skill.\n\nImproving hydrologic models for predictions and process understanding using neural ODEs\n\nMarvin HÃ¶ge, Andreas Scheidegger, Marco Baity-Jesi, Carlo Albert, and Fabrizio Fenicia\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5085–5102, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5085-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5085-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNeural ODEs fuse physics-based models with deep learning: neural networks substitute terms in differential equations that represent the mechanistic structure of the system. The approach combines the flexibility of machine learning with physical constraints for inter- and extrapolation. We demonstrate that neural ODE models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance while keeping full interpretability of model states and processes in hydrologic modelling over multiple catchments.\n\nResponse of active catchment water storage capacity to a prolonged meteorological drought and asymptotic climate variation\n\nJing Tian, Zhengke Pan, Shenglian Guo, Jiabo Yin, Yanlai Zhou, and Jun Wang\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4853–4874, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4853-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4853-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMost of the literature has focused on the runoff response to climate change, while neglecting the impacts of the potential variation in the active catchment water storage capacity (ACWSC) that plays an essential role in the transfer of climate inputs to the catchment runoff. This study aims to systematically identify the response of the ACWSC to a long-term meteorological drought and asymptotic climate change.\n\nMachine learning based streamflow prediction in a hilly catchment for future scenarios using CMIP6 data\n\nDharmaveer Singh, Manu Vardhan, Rakesh Sahu, Debrupa Chatterjee, Pankaj Chauhan, and Shiyin Liu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-339,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-339, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study very first time examines the potential of various machine learning models in streamflow prediction over the Sutlej River Basin (rainfall dominated zone) in western Himalaya during the period 2041–2070 (2050s) and 2071–2100 (2080s) and its relationship to climate variability. The mean ensemble of model results show that the mean annual streamflow of the Sutlej River is expected to rise between 2050s and 2080s by 5.51 to 6.04 % for SSP585 and by 6.65 to 6.75 % for SSP245.\n\nHESS Opinions: Participatory Digital eARth Twin Hydrology systems (DARTHs) for everyone â a blueprint for hydrologists\n\nRiccardo Rigon, Giuseppe Formetta, Marialaura Bancheri, NiccolÃ² Tubini, Concetta D'Amato, Olaf David, and Christian Massari\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4773–4800, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4773-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4773-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Digital Earth (DE) metaphor is very useful for both end users and hydrological modelers. We analyse different categories of models, with the view of making them part of a Digital eARth Twin Hydrology system (called DARTH). We also stress the idea that DARTHs are not models in and of themselves, rather they need to be built on an appropriate information technology infrastructure. It is remarked that DARTHs have to, by construction, support the open-science movement and its ideas.\n\nDevelopment of a national 7-day ensemble streamflow forecasting service for Australia\n\nHapu Arachchige Prasantha Hapuarachchi, Mohammed Abdul Bari, Aynul Kabir, Mohammad Mahadi Hasan, Fitsum Markos Woldemeskel, Nilantha Gamage, Patrick Daniel Sunter, Xiaoyong Sophie Zhang, David Ewen Robertson, James Clement Bennett, and Paul Martinus Feikema\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

The methodology is tested for 100 catchments to learn the characteristics of different NWP rainfall forecasts, the effect of post-processing, and the optimal ensemble size and bootstrapping parameters. Forecasts are generated using NWP rainfall products post-processed by the CHyPP model, the GR4H hydrologic model, and the ERRIS streamflow post-processor inbuilt in the SWIFT package\n\nFuture snow changes and their impact on the upstream runoff in Salween\n\nChenhao Chai, Lei Wang, Deliang Chen, Jing Zhou, Hu Liu, Jingtian Zhang, Yuanwei Wang, Tao Chen, and Ruishun Liu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4657–4683, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4657-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4657-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work quantifies future snow changes and their impacts on hydrology in the upper Salween River (USR) under SSP126 and SSP585 using a cryosphere–hydrology model. Future warm–wet climate is not conducive to the development of snow. The rain–snow-dominated pattern of runoff will shift to a rain-dominated pattern after the 2040s under SSP585 but is unchanged under SSP126. The findings improve our understanding of cryosphere–hydrology processes and can assist water resource management in the USR.\n\nTechnical note: Do different projections matter for the Budyko framework?\n\nRemko C. Nijzink and Stanislaus J. Schymanski\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4575–4585, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4575-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4575-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMost catchments plot close to the empirical Budyko curve, which allows for the estimation of the long-term mean annual evaporation and runoff. The Budyko curve can be defined as a function of a wetness index or a dryness index. We found that differences can occur and that there is an uncertainty due to the different formulations.\n\nRepresentation of seasonal land use dynamics in SWAT+ for improved assessment of blue and green water consumption\n\nAnna Msigwa, Celray James Chawanda, Hans C. Komakech, Albert Nkwasa, and Ann van Griensven\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4447–4468, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4447-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4447-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStudies using agro-hydrological models, like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to map evapotranspiration (ET) do not account for cropping seasons. A comparison between the default SWAT+ set-up (with static land use representation) and a dynamic SWAT+ model set-up (with seasonal land use representation) is made by spatial mapping of the ET. The results show that ET with seasonal representation is closer to remote sensing estimates, giving better performance than ET with static land use.\n\nLarge-sample assessment of varying spatial resolution on the streamflow estimates of the wflow_sbm hydrological model\n\nJerom P. M. Aerts, Rolf W. Hut, Nick C. van de Giesen, Niels Drost, Willem J. van Verseveld, Albrecht H. Weerts, and Pieter Hazenberg\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4407–4430, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4407-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4407-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn recent years gridded hydrological modelling moved into the realm of hyper-resolution modelling (<10 km). In this study, we investigate the effect of varying grid-cell sizes for the wflow_sbm hydrological model. We used a large sample of basins from the CAMELS data set to test the effect that varying grid-cell sizes has on the simulation of streamflow at the basin outlet. Results show that there is no single best grid-cell size for modelling streamflow throughout the domain.\n\nAn algorithm for deriving the topology of belowground urban stormwater networks\n\nTaher Chegini and Hong-Yi Li\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4279–4300, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4279-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4279-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBelowground urban stormwater networks (BUSNs) play a critical and irreplaceable role in preventing or mitigating urban floods. However, they are often not available for urban flood modeling at regional or larger scales. We develop a novel algorithm to estimate existing BUSNs using ubiquitously available aboveground data at large scales based on graph theory. The algorithm has been validated in different urban areas; thus, it is well transferable.\n\nAssessing the influence of water sampling strategy on the performance of tracer-aided hydrological modeling in a mountainous basin on the Tibetan Plateau\n\nYi Nan, Zhihua He, Fuqiang Tian, Zhongwang Wei, and Lide Tian\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4147–4167, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4147-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4147-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTracer-aided hydrological models are useful tool to reduce uncertainty of hydrological modeling in cold basins, but there is little guidance on the sampling strategy for isotope analysis, which is important for large mountainous basins. This study evaluated the reliance of the tracer-aided modeling performance on the availability of isotope data in the Yarlung Tsangpo river basin, and provides implications for collecting water isotope data for running tracer-aided hydrological models.\n\nFlood forecasting with machine learning models in an operational framework\n\nSella Nevo, Efrat Morin, Adi Gerzi Rosenthal, Asher Metzger, Chen Barshai, Dana Weitzner, Dafi Voloshin, Frederik Kratzert, Gal Elidan, Gideon Dror, Gregory Begelman, Grey Nearing, Guy Shalev, Hila Noga, Ira Shavitt, Liora Yuklea, Moriah Royz, Niv Giladi, Nofar Peled Levi, Ofir Reich, Oren Gilon, Ronnie Maor, Shahar Timnat, Tal Shechter, Vladimir Anisimov, Yotam Gigi, Yuval Levin, Zach Moshe, Zvika Ben-Haim, Avinatan Hassidim, and Yossi Matias\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4013–4032, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4013-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4013-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarly flood warnings are one of the most effective tools to save lives and goods. Machine learning (ML) models can improve flood prediction accuracy but their use in operational frameworks is limited. The paper presents a flood warning system, operational in India and Bangladesh, that uses ML models for forecasting river stage and flood inundation maps and discusses the models' performances. In 2021, more than 100 million flood alerts were sent to people near rivers over an area of 470 000 km2.\n\nPrecipitation fate and transport in a Mediterranean catchment through models calibrated on plant and stream water isotope data\n\nMatthias Sprenger, Pilar Llorens, Francesc Gallart, Paolo Benettin, Scott T. Allen, and JÃ©rÃ´me Latron\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 4093–4107, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4093-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4093-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur catchment-scale transit time modeling study shows that including stable isotope data on evapotranspiration in addition to the commonly used stream water isotopes helps constrain the model parametrization and reveals that the water taken up by plants has resided longer in the catchment storage than the water leaving the catchment as stream discharge. This finding is important for our understanding of how water is stored and released, which impacts the water availability for plants and humans.\n\nHigh-resolution satellite products improve hydrological modeling in northern Italy\n\nLorenzo Alfieri, Francesco Avanzi, Fabio Delogu, Simone Gabellani, Giulia Bruno, Lorenzo Campo, Andrea Libertino, Christian Massari, Angelica Tarpanelli, Dominik Rains, Diego G. Miralles, Raphael Quast, Mariette Vreugdenhil, Huan Wu, and Luca Brocca\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3921–3939, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3921-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3921-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work shows advances in high-resolution satellite data for hydrology. We performed hydrological simulations for the Po River basin using various satellite products, including precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture, and snow depth. Evaporation and snow depth improved a simulation based on high-quality ground observations. Interestingly, a model calibration relying on satellite data skillfully reproduces observed discharges, paving the way to satellite-driven hydrological applications.\n\nAnalysis of high streamflow extremes in climate change studies: how do we calibrate hydrological models?\n\nBruno Majone, Diego Avesani, Patrick Zulian, Aldo Fiori, and Alberto Bellin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3863–3883, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3863-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3863-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work, we introduce a methodology for devising reliable future high streamflow scenarios from climate change simulations. The calibration of a hydrological model is carried out to maximize the probability that the modeled and observed high flow extremes belong to the same statistical population. Application to the Adige River catchment (southeastern Alps, Italy) showed that this procedure produces reliable quantiles of the annual maximum streamflow for use in assessment studies.\n\nA conceptual-model-based sediment connectivity assessment for patchy agricultural catchments\n\nPedro V. G. Batista, Peter Fiener, Simon Scheper, and Christine Alewell\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

When eroded sediments are transported out of the agricultural fields by surface runoff, these features can influence sediment connectivity. By use of measured data and a simulation model, we demonstrate how a dense road network (and its drainage system) facilitates sediment transport from fields to water courses in a patchy Swiss agricultural catchment.\n\nThe Great Lakes Runoff Intercomparison Project Phase 4: the Great Lakes (GRIP-GL)\n\nJuliane Mai, Hongren Shen, Bryan A. Tolson, Ãtienne Gaborit, Richard Arsenault, James R. Craig, Vincent Fortin, Lauren M. Fry, Martin Gauch, Daniel Klotz, Frederik Kratzert, Nicole O'Brien, Daniel G. Princz, Sinan Rasiya Koya, Tirthankar Roy, Frank Seglenieks, Narayan K. Shrestha, AndrÃ© G. T. Temgoua, Vincent Vionnet, and Jonathan W. Waddell\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3537–3572, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3537-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3537-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModel intercomparison studies are carried out to test various models and compare the quality of their outputs over the same domain. In this study, 13 diverse model setups using the same input data are evaluated over the Great Lakes region. Various model outputs – such as streamflow, evaporation, soil moisture, and amount of snow on the ground – are compared using standardized methods and metrics. The basin-wise model outputs and observations are made available through an interactive website.\n\nSpatial extrapolation of stream thermal peaks using heterogeneous time series at a national scale\n\nAurÃ©lien Beaufort, Jacob S. Diamond, Eric Sauquet, and Florentina Moatar\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3477–3495, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3477-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3477-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed one of the largest stream temperature databases to calculate a simple, ecologically relevant metric – the thermal peak – that captures the magnitude of summer thermal extremes. Using statistical models, we extrapolated the thermal peak to nearly every stream in France, finding the hottest thermal peaks along large rivers without forested riparian zones and groundwater inputs. Air temperature was a poor proxy for the thermal peak, highlighting the need to grow monitoring networks.\n\nRevisiting parameter sensitivities in the variable infiltration capacity model across a hydroclimatic gradient\n\nUlises M. SepÃºlveda, Pablo A. Mendoza, Naoki Mizukami, and Andrew J. Newman\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3419–3445, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3419-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3419-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper characterizes parameter sensitivities across more than 5500 grid cells for a commonly used macroscale hydrological model, including a suite of eight performance metrics and 43 soil, vegetation and snow parameters. The results show that the model is highly overparameterized and, more importantly, help to provide guidance on the most relevant parameters for specific target processes across diverse climatic types.\n\nDeep learning rainfallârunoff predictions of extreme events\n\nJonathan M. Frame, Frederik Kratzert, Daniel Klotz, Martin Gauch, Guy Shalev, Oren Gilon, Logan M. Qualls, Hoshin V. Gupta, and Grey S. Nearing\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3377–3392, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3377-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3377-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe most accurate rainfall–runoff predictions are currently based on deep learning. There is a concern among hydrologists that deep learning models may not be reliable in extrapolation or for predicting extreme events. This study tests that hypothesis. The deep learning models remained relatively accurate in predicting extreme events compared with traditional models, even when extreme events were not included in the training set.\n\nDiel streamflow cycles suggest more sensitive snowmelt-driven streamflow to climate change than land surface modeling does\n\nSebastian A. Krogh, Lucia Scaff, James W. Kirchner, Beatrice Gordon, Gary Sterle, and Adrian Harpold\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3393–3417, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3393-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3393-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new way to detect snowmelt using daily cycles in streamflow driven by solar radiation. Results show that warmer sites have earlier and more intermittent snowmelt than colder sites, and the timing of early snowmelt events is strongly correlated with the timing of streamflow volume. A space-for-time substitution shows greater sensitivity of streamflow timing to climate change in colder rather than in warmer places, which is then contrasted with land surface simulations.\n\nTeaching hydrological modelling: illustrating model structure uncertainty with a ready-to-use computational exercise\n\nWouter J. M. Knoben and Diana Spieler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3299–3314, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3299-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3299-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper introduces educational materials that can be used to teach students about model structure uncertainty in hydrological modelling. There are many different hydrological models and differences between these models impact their usefulness in different places. Such models are often used to support decision making about water resources and to perform hydrological science, and it is thus important for students to understand that model choice matters.\n\nRiver hydraulic modelling with ICEsat-2 land and water surface elevation\n\nMonica Coppo Frias, Suxia Liu, Xingguo Mo, Karina Nielsen, Heidi Randall, Liguang Jiang, Jun Ma, and Peter Bauer-Gottwein\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-377,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-377, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper uses remote sensing data from ICESat-2 to calibrate a 1D hydraulic model. With the model, we can make estimations of discharge and water surface elevation, which are important indicators in flooding risk assessment. ICESat-2 data gives an added value thanks to its 0.7 meters resolution, which allows for measuring narrow river streams. In addition, ICESat-2 provides measurements on the river dry portion geometry that can be included in the model.\n\nEffects of spatial and temporal variability in surface water inputs on streamflow generation and cessation in the rainâsnow transition zone\n\nLeonie Kiewiet, Ernesto Trujillo, Andrew Hedrick, Scott Havens, Katherine Hale, Mark Seyfried, Stephanie Kampf, and Sarah E. Godsey\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2779–2796, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2779-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2779-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change affects precipitation phase, which can propagate into changes in streamflow timing and magnitude. This study examines how variations in rainfall and snowmelt affect discharge. We found that annual discharge and stream cessation depended on the magnitude and timing of rainfall and snowmelt and on the snowpack melt-out date. This highlights the importance of precipitation timing and emphasizes the need for spatiotemporally distributed simulations of snowpack and rainfall dynamics.\n\nQuantifying multi-year hydrological memory with Catchment Forgetting Curves\n\nAlban de Lavenne, Vazken AndrÃ©assian, Louise Crochemore, GÃ¶ran LindstrÃ¶m, and Berit Arheimer\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2715–2732, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2715-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2715-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA watershed remembers the past to some extent, and this memory influences its behavior. This memory is defined by the ability to store past rainfall for several years. By releasing this water into the river or the atmosphere, it tends to forget. We describe how this memory fades over time in France and Sweden. A few watersheds show a multi-year memory. It increases with the influence of groundwater or dry conditions. After 3 or 4 years, they behave independently of the past.\n\nOn constraining a lumped hydrological model with both piezometry and streamflow: results of a large sample evaluation\n\nAntoine Pelletier and Vazken AndrÃ©assian\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2733–2758, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2733-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2733-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA large part of the water cycle takes place underground. In many places, the soil stores water during the wet periods and can release it all year long, which is particularly visible when the river level is low. Modelling tools that are used to simulate and forecast the behaviour of the river struggle to represent this. We improved an existing model to take underground water into account using measurements of the soil water content. Results allow us make recommendations for model users.\n\nInfluences of land use changes on the dynamics of water quantity and quality in the German lowland catchment of the StÃ¶r\n\nChaogui Lei, Paul D. Wagner, and Nicola Fohrer\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2561–2582, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2561-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2561-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe presented an integrated approach to hydrologic modeling and partial least squares regression quantifying land use change impacts on water and nutrient balance over 3 decades. Results highlight that most variations (70 %–80 %) in water quantity and quality variables are explained by changes in land use class-specific areas and landscape metrics. Arable land influences water quantity and quality the most. The study provides insights on water resources management in rural lowland catchments.\n\nImpact of spatial distribution information of rainfall in runoff simulation using deep learning method\n\nYang Wang and Hassan A. Karimi\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2387–2403, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2387-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2387-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe found that rainfall data with spatial information can improve the model's performance, especially when simulating the future multi-day discharges. We did not observe that regional LSTM as a regional model achieved better results than LSTM as individual model. This conclusion applies to both one-day and multi-day simulations. However, we found that using spatially distributed rainfall data can reduce the difference between individual LSTM and regional LSTM.\n\nTowards effective drought monitoring in the Middle East and North AfricaÂ (MENA) region: implications from assimilating leaf area index and soil moisture into the Noah-MP land surface model for Morocco\n\nWanshu Nie, Sujay V. Kumar, Kristi R. Arsenault, Christa D. Peters-Lidard, Iliana E. Mladenova, Karim Bergaoui, Abheera Hazra, Benjamin F. Zaitchik, Sarith P. Mahanama, Rachael McDonnell, David M. Mocko, and Mahdi Navari\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2365–2386, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2365-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2365-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region faces significant food and water insecurity and hydrological hazards. Here we investigate the value of assimilating remote sensing data sets into an Earth system model to help build an effective drought monitoring system and support risk mitigation and management by countries in the region. We highlight incorporating satellite-informed vegetation conditions into the model as being one of the key processes for a successful application for the region.\n\nThe effects of spatial and temporal resolution of gridded meteorological forcing on watershed hydrological responses\n\nPin Shuai, Xingyuan Chen, Utkarsh Mital, Ethan T. Coon, and Dipankar Dwivedi\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2245–2276, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2245-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2245-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing an integrated watershed model, we compared simulated watershed hydrologic variables driven by three publicly available gridded meteorological forcings (GMFs) at various spatial and temporal resolutions. Our results demonstrated that spatially distributed variables are sensitive to the spatial resolution of the GMF. The temporal resolution of the GMF impacts the dynamics of watershed responses. The choice of GMF depends on the quantity of interest and its spatial and temporal scales.\n\nHydrological response of a peri-urban catchment exploiting conventional and unconventional rainfall observations: the case study of Lambro Catchment\n\nGreta Cazzaniga, Carlo De Michele, Michele D'Amico, Cristina Deidda, Antonio Ghezzi, and Roberto Nebuloni\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2093–2111, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2093-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2093-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRainfall estimates are usually obtained from rain gauges, weather radars, or satellites. An alternative is the measurement of the signal loss induced by rainfall on commercial microwave links (CMLs). In this work, we assess the hydrologic response of Lambro Basin when CML-retrieved rainfall is used as model input. CML estimates agree with rain gauge data. CML-driven discharge simulations show performance comparable to that from rain gauges if a CML-based calibration of the model is undertaken.\n\nAssessing hydrological sensitivity of grassland basins in the Canadian Prairies to climate using a basin classification-based virtual modelling approach\n\nChristopher Spence, Zhihua He, Kevin R. Shook, Balew A. Mekonnen, John W. Pomeroy, Colin J. Whitfield, and Jared D. Wolfe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1801–1819, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1801-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1801-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe determined how snow and flow in small creeks change with temperature and precipitation in the Canadian Prairie, a region where water resources are often under stress. We tried something new. Every watershed in the region was placed in one of seven groups based on their landscape traits. We selected one of these groups and used its traits to build a model of snow and streamflow. It worked well, and by the 2040s there may be 20 %–40 % less snow and 30 % less streamflow than the 1980s.\n\nThe value of satellite soil moisture and snow cover data for the transfer of hydrological model parameters to ungauged sites\n\nRui Tong, Juraj Parajka, BorbÃ¡la SzÃ©les, Isabella Greimeister-Pfeil, Mariette Vreugdenhil, JÃ¼rgen Komma, Peter Valent, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 1779–1799, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1779-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-1779-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe role and impact of using additional data (other than runoff) for the prediction of daily hydrographs in ungauged basins are not well understood. In this study, we assessed the model performance in terms of runoff, soil moisture, and snow cover predictions with the existing regionalization approaches. Results show that the best transfer methods are the similarity and the kriging approaches. The performance of the transfer methods differs between lowland and alpine catchments.\n\nCited articles\n\nAhmadi, M., Arabi, M., Ascough, J., Fontane, D. G., and Engel, B.
