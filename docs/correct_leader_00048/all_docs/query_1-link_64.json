        "text": "Career moment this week, hosting my first major conference, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce' and BusinessEurope's Transatlantic Business Works Summit. The event underscored the transatlantic partnership’s resilience and critical need for economic collaboration amidst global uncertainty. Rewatch it here: https://shorturl.at/emvSU 'Driving #Competitiveness in a Changing World' was our theme. Highlighting the importance of the $8.7 trillion transatlantic relationship that supports 16 million jobs and represents one-third of global GDP, at a time of significant geopolitical shifts from the war in Ukraine to pivotal elections in the U.S., UK, EU, and more... Insights from so many leaders began with Marjorie Chorlins and Luisa Gradim Santos setting a tone of unity, Ambassador of Ireland to the United States Geraldine Byrne Nason emphasized the partnership’s strength. Panel discussions ranged from the state of transatlantic business, led by CEOs Suzanne Clark, Markus Beyrer, and Susan Danger with John Murphy, to member companies discussing digital transformation with Sean Heather, and green transition strategies with Ivana Zuzul, advocating for joint action towards a brighter future. I was honored to moderate a fireside chat on the UK's present and future with James Roscoe, and Eleonora Catella did the same on China and the transatlantic relationship with Lord Peter Mandelson. Former Italian Prime Minister and author of the EU Single Market Report Enrico Letta, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and White House Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer delivered powerful keynotes, focusing on strength, unity, innovation, and our shared commitment to global challenges. Adding a touch of creativity, our collaboration with Embassy of France in the United States, Pierre Leonard, Baudouin Carrard, and Lena Wolfe brought the Palace at Versailles and the Paris Summer Games to our Great Hall. Massive thanks to our sponsors Amazon, Emergent BioSolutions, and Google. Thanks to our U.S. and European government colleagues for joining, and of course to our member companies, we do this for you! Same for my indispensable partner on this project Eleonora Catella, and to my amazing team, Marjorie Chorlins for trusting in my creativity and ability to deliver big, Ivana Zuzul and Tim Bradley for being the best coworkers ever, and Tara Galloway and Josephine Sylvestre for saying yes to any task. Executing an event experience like this takes a village, and one that only the Chamber can deliver. Huge thanks to all involved, deeply grateful to Hannah Kim, Greg Kundolf, Alexis Saunders, Jayna Champeau, Ian Wagreich, Michelle Koepp, and so many others Brian Dalton, Anne Collett, Micky Ronis, Ronald Macklin, Peter Dowsett, Joe Neary, Isaiah Gibson, Nick Malczewski, Dalton Kendall, Hector and Hassani, Luis Benitez, Bob Phillips, Diego Ibanez, Johnny Ibanez, Charles Lawson, Jerry Marshall, Ollie Perkins, Jeff Lourinia, Isabel Boyd, Jeff Ohlson, Eileen Trayan."
