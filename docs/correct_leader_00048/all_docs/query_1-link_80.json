        "text": "The Book of Lost Names (to be released 7/21/20)\n\nby Kristin Harmel\n\n5 stars\n\nAnother excellent WWII historical fiction read by Kristin Harmel! Harmel became a favorite of mine when I picked up When We Meet Again in summer of 2016. I quickly placed her other titles on hold at my library and devoured them. If you haven’t checked out Sweetness of Forgetting or The Life Intended, please do so! Her latest releases have not disappointed either! This book follows Eva, a young Jewish woman, who flees to a small town in France after her father is arrested. Using her talents as an artist, she meets a small group of people and begins forging identity papers for Jewish children to help them to flee to safety. She wants the children’s names to be preserved for after the war, so she begins keeping a code in a religious text that becomes The Book of Lost Names. I love how the book is based on a true story and I appreciate that Harmel always digs into subjects that aren’t as familiar to us, like the topic of forgery. The story has alternate timelines, 1940’s (Eva in the past) and 2005 (Eva in the present) Like Harmel’s previous books, I enjoy this jump back in forth in time. A great book about bravery, heartbreak, war, and even a love story. Highly recommend! Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for an ARC of this book!\n\nRead-alikes\n\nAll the Ways We Said Goodbye by Beatriz Williams, Lauren Willig, and Karen White\n\nEchoes by Danielle Steele\n\nThe Lost Vintage by Ann Mah\n\nI tend to be one of those people who often question when something is getting a lot of hype. Is it really as good as everyone says? The Broadway musical Hamilton was no exception for me. A few years ago I saw that the soundtrack was available through hoopla for free (sadly it doesn’t seem to be anymore), so I decided to see what all the hype was about. I have to say, I was blown away! I’ve been a HUGE fan of the show ever since.\n\nI’ve been anxiously awaiting the release of the recording of the original Broadway cast of Hamilton, and I’m so excited it’s being released today on Disney+! The mix of American history with modern music, and references to issues such as immigration and racial equality are wonderfully done and make for a memorable show. I highly recommend listening to the soundtrack if you haven’t already. If you’re already a fan, like me, I’ve put together a list of nonfiction books, fiction books, and musical soundtracks that you may enjoy.\n\nNonfiction Books\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nby Ron Chernow\n\nThis is the book that inspired Lin-Manuel Miranda to write the musical, and definitely the one most recommended for fans of the show.\n\nWashington’s Immortals\n\nby Patrick K. O’Donnell\n\nThe little-known story of the Washington-led “Immortal 400” who found in several battles during the Revolutionary War.\n\nLouisa: The Extraordinary Life of Mrs. Adams\n\nby Louisa Thomas\n\nA biography of Louisa Catherine Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams.\n\nLafayette in the Somewhat United States\n\nby Sarah Vowell\n\nA humorous and insightful account of the Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette.\n\nFounding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation\n\nby Joseph Ellis\n\nA look at the intertwined lives of the founding fathers – John Adams, Aaron Burr, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington.\n\nHamilton: The Revolution\n\nby Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jeremy McCarter\n\nA look into the creation of the musical, including emails, photographs, and notebook entries.\n\nFiction Books\n\nAmerica’ First Daughter\n\nby Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie\n\nA historical novel about Thomas Jefferson’s oldest daughter inspired by original letters.\n\nThe Hamilton Affair\n\nby Elizabeth Cobbs\n\nA fictional account of the love story of Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler.\n\nAlex & Eliza\n\nby Melissa de la Cruz\n\nYoung adult novel following the tale of Hamilton and Eliza.\n\nThe Traitor’s Wife\n\nby Allison Pataki\n\nAn historical novel about Peggy Shippen Arnold, wife of treasonous Benedict Arnold.\n\nNew York\n\nby Edward Rutherfurd\n\nSpanning centuries, this novel explores the history of the city of New York.\n\nMusical Soundtracks\n\nIn the Heights\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway debut.\n\nJesus Christ Superstar\n\nA cultural icon of a show that has a controversial history while delivering some solid rock numbers. Both Hamilton and Jesus Christ Superstar are narrated by the sympathetic antagonist.\n\nNatasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812\n\nWhile not rap, this show uses modern music to tell a historical tale, much like Hamilton.\n\nDear Evan Hansen\n\nLike Hamilton, this show tells the story of an underdog who rises in success and fame only to make a big mistake.\n\nThe Last Five Years\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda actually directly quotes this show including the line “nobody needs to know.” Both shows have a theme of infidelity.\n\nPlus, if you haven’t already watched the documentary on the making of Hamilton, be sure to check out Hamilton, One Show to Broadway, which is available on hoopla.\n\nWho Speaks for the Damned\n\nby C.S. Harris\n\n5 stars\n\nWho Speaks for the Damned is C.S. Harris’ fifteenth entry in the Sebastian St. Cyr historical mystery series. Set in the Regency Era, the series centers around the aforementioned Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin. Devlin is a nobleman who was once accused of murder and in the process of proving himself innocent, discovered he has rather a knack for ferreting out the truth. Thus, he now investigates murder in the ranks of the nobility, always seeking justice for the dead.\n\nThis time Devlin is investigating the murder of Nicholas Hayes. Hayes is the third son of the Earl of Seaforth, and was tried and convicted of a noblewoman’s murder 20 years ago. Transported to Australia soon after his conviction, he was believed to be dead. What, then, is his corpse doing turning up in Pennington’s Tea Gardens in the heart of London? Why did he risk hanging by returning to England’s shores? Who went to the trouble to murder Hayes, when all they needed to do was turn him in to the Crown to be hanged?\n\nAs Devlin investigates, several possibilities emerge as to why Hayes felt it necessary to return. Did he seek to clear his name of a murder he did not commit? Could he have sought revenge on those men he believed instrumental in helping to secure his murder conviction? Perhaps he returned seeking to punish those he believed drove his brother to suicide just days before his sentence was passed. Or was his return due to his wish to secure the future of the child traveling with him, a child believed to be his son and heir but who has now gone missing?\n\nAs Devlin unravels the intricacies of Hayes’ past and his present demise, the reader is immersed once again into the world of early 1800s London thanks to Harris’ excellent plotting, strong attention to detail, and character-driven writing. Devlin, while a man of moral rectitude, is as human and as flawed a protagonist as you will find, which endears him to the reader all the more for it. Hero, Devlin’s wife, is a strong, capable woman whose work among the poor of London’s streets attempts to highlight and correct the gaping chasm between the rich and the poor of the times, serving to illustrate them for the modern reader. Jarvis, adviser to kings, Hero’s father, and Devlin’s constant nemesis, doesn’t disappoint in his constancy as a man of questionable morals who does whatever is necessary to ensure that no hint of scandal tarnishes the throne of England or besmirches the nobility. I think of Jarvis as the Dolores Umbridge of the Regency Era—you love to hate him.\n\nThis series is one of the best historical mystery series being written today, and this fifteenth entry to the series is a most enjoyable read. Harris’ plotting is fast-paced yet never formulaic. The characters are likable and relatable, and the story-line unfolds with twists and turns aplenty. Readers of this series will not be disappointed, and those new to the series will be delighted with their discovery of such a well-crafted, devour-able novel. I never miss a Sebastian St. Cyr novel, and once you read one, you won’t want to miss one either. They just keep getting better, and Who Speaks for the Damned is no exception. A riveting read.\n\nRead alikes:\n\nA Murder in Time by Julie McElwain\n\nSilent in the Grave by Deanna Raybourn\n\nThe Inheritance by Charles Finch\n\nWritten by Casey, a member of our Patron Services department.
