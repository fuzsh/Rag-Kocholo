        "text": "Increasing support for Ukraine will be a top priority at the Nato summit from 9 to 11 July, at which Luxembourg will be represented by Prime Minister Luc Frieden and Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel (a broken tibia prevents Defence Minister Yuriko Backes from travelling).\n\nBut the summit will also be a celebration of Nato’s 75th anniversary. The North Atlantic Treaty, which forms the legal basis of, and is implemented by, Nato was signed in April 1949 in Washington, DC.\n\nLuxembourg was one of 12 founding members and even though its spending commitment has not always met Nato targets (and it will - sort of - by 2030) it has been active in the organisation throughout the last 75 years.\n\n1949: North Atlantic Treaty\n\nFollowing the end of WWII, Luxembourg Prime Minister Joseph Bech helped engineer a collective defence agreement, signed in Brussels in 1948, with the Benelux countries plus France and the United Kingdom.\n\nA year later, Luxembourg and 11 other states - the Western Union plus the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland - sign the North Atlantic Treaty that created Nato.\n\nThe country counted just under 300,000 citizens at the time. “Though much smaller than most of its new allies, Luxembourg’s population had something that many of its larger counterparts lacked: a near-unanimous consensus to join Nato and play its part in uniting Western Europe in a defensive alliance,” Nato states on its website. “All three of Luxembourg’s major political parties supported Nato accession, with only the Communists offering token opposition.”\n\n1954: Steel for Nato HQ\n\nLuxembourg provided 3,500 tons of steel for the construction of Nato’s purpose-built headquarters - Porte Dauphine - in Paris.\n\nThe headquarters had originally been in London until moving to Paris in 1952. French architect Jacques Carlu, who designed the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, was nominated to draw up the plans for the future HQ. Construction on the 16,000 square metre plot of land began in 1955 and Nato moved into its new facility in 1960.\n\nIn 1966, France decided to withdraw from Nato’s integrated military command structure, which called for another move - this time to Brussels. The new site in Belgium was constructed in a record time of six months and was inaugurated on 16 October 1967. Since then, HQ moved to a new building opposite the old one in 2018.\n\n1967: Nato meetings\n\nOne of the most significant Nato meetings in Luxembourg took place in June 1967, when US Secretary of State Dean Rusk attended a meeting of Nato ministers. The Middle East situation, relations with the Soviet Bloc and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons were hot topics.\n\nThe Nato Maintenance and Supply Agency (Namsa), which was established in 1961, moved into a former Luxembourg Army garrison in Capellen, some 12km west of Luxembourg City. In 2012 it became the Nato Support Agency (NSPA) following a merger with the Central Europe Pipeline Management Agency (Cepma) and the Nato Airlift Management Agency (Nama).\n\n1982: Awacs registration\n\nLuxembourg is the Nato registration state for the E-3A component of the Nato Airborne Early Warning fleet. The E-3A component consists of 17 Awacs, which are modified Boeing 707s equipped with long-range radar and passive sensors capable of detecting air and surface contacts over large distances.\n\nLuxembourg airport also served as a staging ground for allied troops participating in Nato exercises, notably during the Reforger exercises, which would be held once a year during the Cold War to test Nato’s ability to deploy forces to West Germany quickly in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact.\n\n1992: Peace-keeping missions law\n\nLuxembourg adopts a law that allows its troops to participate in peace-keeping missions under the auspices of international organisations - not just Nato, but also the European Union and the United Nations.\n\n1996: Mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina\n\nAfter taking part in the UN Protection Force during the Croatian War of Independence from April 1992 to August 1993, Luxembourg joins the 60,000 strong Nato Ifor (Implementation Force) peace-keeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Luxembourg contingent consists of 22 soldiers, with four Hummer Humvee vehicles and six trucks.\n\nThey operate under the command of a Belgian unit and are attached to a multinational transport company stationed in Visoko, north of Sarajevo, from January to December 1996, when the Ifor mission concluded its mandate.\n\nIn 1997 the Nato Stabilisation Force (SFOR) replaces Ifor, and Luxembourg again joins under the wing of the Belgian army as the Belgian-Luxembourg Battle Group (BELUBG). They transfer to Tomislavgrad.\n\nA year later, Belgium and Luxembourg redeploy and join the SFOR Multinational Division South West under British command. In total, the Grand Duchy sends nine rotations of soldiers to Bosnia between January 1997 and January 2000\n\n1998: Madeleine Albright\n\nLuxembourg, under foreign minister Jacques Poos, hosts the Nato Ministerial Meeting in May, which lays the groundwork for the accession to the alliance of Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland in April the following year. The meeting’s final statement even speaks of close ties with the Russian Federation: “Our aim is to work with Russia to achieve the early opening of a Nato Military Liaison Mission in Moscow.” Notable delegates include British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.\n\n1999: Kosovo mission\n\nNato calls into action the Kosovo Force (KFOR), which at its height numbers some 50,000 troops from members as well as supporting countries. Its mission was to build a secure environment and guarantee the freedom of movement through all Kosovo territory for all citizens. Luxembourg sends a reconnaissance platoon that is integrated into the Belgium-Luxembourg Kosovo Battalion (Belukosbat) stationed with the northern multinational brigade in Leposavic.\n\n2003: Afghanistan assistance\n\nFrom July 2003 to September 2012, Luxembourg was part of the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) that Nato sent to Afghanistan following a mandate from the United Nations. Isaf’s primary objective was to “enable the Afghan government to provide effective security across the country and develop new Afghan security forces to ensure Afghanistan would never again become a safe haven for terrorists.”\n\nLuxembourg sent nine soldiers who were integrated into a Belgian detachment that was providing security for the military zone at Kabul airport, and later also helped a mission at Kandahar airport. In 2011, Luxembourg also sent four Dingo 2 armoured patrol vehicles. A total of 35 rotations were sent to Afghanistan.\n\n2009: Strategic Concept summit\n\nIn October, the first of four main seminars to guide the development of Nato’s new Strategic Concept and work towards defining the alliance’s fundamental security tasks, was held in Luxembourg. It was presided by Madeleine Albright as a chair of Nato’s Group of Experts.\n\n2012: Kabul laboratory\n\nThe Luxembourg army sent a non-commissioned officer from its de-mining service to join a criminology analysis laboratory under French command. Located in Camp Warehouse, some 10km east of Kabul, the laboratory’s purpose was to combat improvised explosive devices (IEDs).\n\n2014: Wales Pledge\n\nLuxembourg signs the Wales Pledge that commits Nato members to spending 2% of their GDP on defence. In 2023 Luxembourg negotiated an agreement that it would use calculations based on gross national income (GNI), which strips out the contribution of cross-border workers to the economy, rather than GDP.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHow Luxembourg plans to reach defence spending target by 2030\n\n2015: Resolute Support Mission\n\nA new Resolute Support Mission begins in January 2015 with the aim of providing training, advice and assistance to Afghan forces and security institutions. From June 2015 to May 2021, Luxembourg takes part with personnel deployed in Mazenod under German command. At the same time, demining specialists from Luxembourg are deployed in Mazar-i-Charif.\n\n2017: Lithuania Enhanced Forward Presence\n\nFollowing the invasion of parts of Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, Nato in 2016 set up the Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) with forces in four frontline countries - Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Luxembourg joined a contingent under German command in Rukla, Lithuania in 2017, providing satellite transmission and logistics capabilities.\n\nCurrently six army personnel are station in Lithuania, though the mission permits a maximum of ten soldiers. Luxembourg troops in rotation will be stationed in Lithuania until at least the end of 2025.\n\n2018: military satellite & Bettel hits back\n\nDefence Minister Étienne Schneider presents a bill to parliament for a military satellite project. But poor planning meant that Luxeosys went more than 80% over budget and ended up costing an estimated €382 million. Luxembourg’s budget auditors published a damning report in July 2022 blaming a lack of feasibility and impact studies and poor communication between all involved for the overspend.\n\nIn February 2024, new Defence Minister Yuriko Backes said that the satellite would be launched - using Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket - sometime between October 2024 and January 2025.\n\nAlso read:\n\nLuxembourg military satellite to finally launch end of year\n\nAccording to an FT report on the July 2018 Nato summit, then Prime Minister Xavier Bettel was the only leader to hit back at US President Donald Trump’s tirade accusing the other members of the alliance of negligent defence spending. The “polyglot with a theatrical flair”, as the FT describes Bettel, stood up and told Trump that he objected to the president’s characterisation of Luxembourg as a freeloader.\n\n2020: A400M aircraft\n\nLuxembourg takes delivery of an A400M transport aircraft, part of a Belgium-Luxembourg fleet of eight planes. The Grand Duchy had budgeted €420 million to buy and operate its plane.\n\nAlso read:\n\nLuxembourg receives its new military transport plane\n\n2021: Afghanistan withdrawal\n\nIn 2021, Nato withdrew from Afghanistan and the Luxembourg Army took part in an evacuation operation using the A400M aircraft aimed at removing people with links to the Grand Duchy and Belgium, nationals of Western countries as well as Afghan citizens with links to allied forces or international organisations.\n\n2023: Belgian battalion\n\nIn June, Defence Minister François Bausch signed a co-operation with Belgium for the establishment of a binational reconnaissance battalion.\n\nThe 700-strong battalion will be formed and equipped to conduct national or multinational missions or operations in support of international or regional organisations.\n\n2024: NSPA HQ & spending commitment\n\nIn March, Minister of Defence Yuriko Backes, together with NSPA General Manager Stacy Cummings, leads a ground-breaking ceremony to inaugurate the construction of two administrative buildings for the NSPA headquarters in Capellen.\n\nLuxembourg Minister of Defence Yuriko Backes tells Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a meeting in Brussels in June that she will present an “ambitious but realistic plan” to get the Grand Duchy’s defence spending to meet the target of 2% of GNI by 2030 - rising from €696 million in 2024 to €1.46 billion over the next seven years."
