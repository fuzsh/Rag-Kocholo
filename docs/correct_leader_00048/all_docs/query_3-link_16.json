The WT is centred on self-initiated projects and assignments with meetings, lectures, excursions, seminars, and readings geared towards self-accountable and independently motivated work and research.\n\nWerkplaats Typografie is directed by graphic designer Armand Mevis and educator Anniek Brattinga. Additional regular teaching staff includes Danny van den Dungen (Experimental Jetset), Batia Suter, Jungmyung Lee, and Paul Elliman. Robert Milne assists in the general coordination of the WT.\n\nGuests are regularly invited for studio visits, to review work, give presentations or supervise a workshop. The WT is frequently asked to contribute to national and international events, manifestations or site specific projects. Part of the WT programme is reserved for collaborating with external clients.\n\nThe Werkplaats Typografie programme stimulates and practices critical reflection on the basis of a broad cultural perspective. Participants engage in research in and through arts, involving content and form, text and image, theory and practice, in relation to oneâ€™s intended professional design and art practice.\n\nAlongside individually driven research and collective projects, participants can work on commissioned assignments for external clients. Assignments can be instigated by the Werkplaats Typografie, external clients, or by the participants themselves. The various outcomes of these can be found, and bought, in the WT Shop."
