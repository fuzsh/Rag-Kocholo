        "text": "10. Further privacy policy content\n\n10.1. Contact Form\n\nYou can contact us via a web form. To use our contact form we need your name, country and e-mail address. You can provide further information, but you do not have to. The information provided by users will be stored in a customer relationship management system (\"CRM system\") or of a comparable enquiry organisation so that we can properly process your enquiry.\n\nThe legal basis for the processing is Article 6 (1)(f) of GDPR. Your data will only be processed to answer your enquiry and deleted after the processing purpose has ceased to apply. This data is not passed on to third parties.\n\n10.2. Salesforce CRM system\n\nWe use the CRM system of the provider salesforce.com Germany GmbH, Erika-Mann-Str. 31, 80636 Munich, Germany, in order to be able to process user inquiries faster and more efficiently (legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f. DSGVO ).\n\nSalesforce uses user data only for technical processing of the inquiries and does not pass them on to third parties. To use salesforce, you must provide, at least, a correct email address. A pseudonymous use is possible. In the course of processing service requests, it may be necessary to collect further data (name, address).\n\nIf users do not consent to the collection and storage of data by salesforce’s external system, we will provide them with alternative contact options for submitting service requests by email, telephone, fax, or mail.\n\nPlease note that the use of third-party content and functions may result in your data being processed outside the EU/EEA. In some countries, there is a risk that authorities may access the data for security and monitoring purposes without you being informed or having the right to appeal. If we use providers in unsafe third countries and you give your consent, the transfer to an unsafe third country is carried out on the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.\n\nProvider: salesforce.com, Inc.\n\nTechnical function or content: CRM system\n\nAdequate level of data protection: No adequate level of data protection. The transmission is based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.\n\nRevocation or consent: If you no longer agree with the processing, please do not use our site any more.\n\n10.3. CustomerNet Restricted Area\n\nIf you would like to use our CustomerNet special customer service, you must first register. Data that you transmit to us for registration will only be used to the extent necessary for CostumerNet. You can change or delete your profile at any time within your account. The data will then be automatically removed from our system.\n\n10.4. Social Media Plugins\n\nOn our website you will also find social media plug-ins. These are social network features you can use to share the content of our website with your friends in social networks or recommend this content to others. The responsibility for data-protection-compliant operation is to be guaranteed by the respective providers. For these plugins, we use the two-click method to protect visitors to our website in the best possible way. We currently use social plug-ins from the following providers:\n\nLinkedIn\n\nOur website uses features of the LinkedIn network. The oeprator is LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Each time you access one of our pages that contains LinkedIn features, a connection is established to LinkedIn servers. LinkedIn will be informed that you have visited our website with your IP address. If you click the LinkedIn Recommend button and are logged into your LinkedIn account, LinkedIn will be able to associate your visit to our website with you and your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by LinkedIn. You can find more information about this in LinkedIn’s privacy policy: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy. Opt-Out: https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out. Privacy Shield: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000L0UZAA0&status=Active.\n\nTwitter\n\nOur website uses features from Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. When you access our website with Twitter plug-ins, a connection is established between your browser and the Twitter servers. Data is transferred to Twitter at this point. If you have a Twitter account, this data can be linked to it. If you do not want this data to be associated with your Twitter account, please log out of Twitter before visiting our site. Interactions, especially clicking a retweet button, are also forwarded to Twitter. You can find more information about this in Twitter’s privacy policy: https://twitter.com/privacy. Opt-Out: https://twitter.com/personalization. Privacy Shield: https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&status=Active.\n\nYouTube\n\nOur website uses features from Youtube.de/Youtube.com, which – represented by Google Inc. – is operated by Youtube, LLC, Cherry Ave., USA. If you visit our website and the page you visit has one of these plugins, a connection to Youtube’s servers is established and the plugin is displayed on the webpage by notification to your browser. Information about the site you visited is then transmitted to the Youtube server. If you are logged in to Youtube, Youtube assigns this information to your personal user account on these platforms. When using these plugins, e.g. the click/start buttons for a video or leaving a comment, this information is assigned to your Youtube user account. You can only prevent this by logging out before using the plugin. You can find more information about this in YouTube’s privacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. Opt-Out: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.\n\nXing\n\nOur website uses features provided by XING AG, Dammtorstraße 29-32, 20354 Hamburg, Germany. If you click the XING Social Share button from XING, you will be redirected to your XING account in a separate browser window – provided you are logged into your XING user account – and you can share the electronic publication stored on our website and add a comment. The plug-in establishes a direct connection between your browser and the XING server. XING receives the information that you have visited our website with your IP address. We would like to point out that we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted (personal) data or its use by XING. For more information, please refer to XING's Privacy Policy: https://privacy.xing.com/en\n\nFacebook\n\nOur website uses features provided by Facebook Inc, 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. When you click a Facebook Social Share button, Facebook automatically assigns your IP address to your user account and allows you to link to our Facebook website on your profile. This process can only take place if you are logged into Facebook at the same time. Unfortunately, we have no knowledge about the use and nature of the data collected. If you do not want Facebook to associate the data gathered via your visit to our website with your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before you visit our website. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as your related rights and settings options for the protection of your privacy, can be found in Facebook’s privacy policy: www.facebook.com/policy.php\n\nGoogle +1\n\nOut website uses social media features provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. When you access our pages and they feature Google plug-ins, a connection is established between your browser and the Google servers. Data is transferred to Google at this point. If you have a Google account, this data can be linked to it. If you do not want this data to be associated with your Google account, please log out of Google before visiting our site. Interactions such as the use of a comment feature or clicking on a +1 or Share button are also passed on to Google. Further information on the use of data by Google, settings and opt-out options can be found in Google’s privacy policy (https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) and in the settings for the display of advertising by Google (https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated).\n\n10.5. Google Maps\n\nWe use Google Maps, provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. The data processed may include users’ IP addresses and location data. This data is not collected without user consent (usually via the settings of their mobile devices). The data may be processed in the United States. Privacy Policy https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. Opt-Out: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en\n\n10.6. Newsletter\n\nVia our website, you can subscribe to our newsletter. If you have given us explicit permission to inform you by email about our products and services, we will process your data per Article 6 (1)(a) of GDPR. We send newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications with advertising information (the “newsletter”) only with the consent of the recipient or a legal permit. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure to confirm your registration. This means that we will send you a confirmation email before the first newsletter is sent. In this email, you can confirm your newsletter subscription by clicking on the link provided. Only after confirmation will you receive our newsletter.\n\nThe newsletters contain a so-called “webbeacon”. This is a file the size of a pixel and which, when the newsletter is opened, is retrieved from our server (or, if we use a dispatch service provider, from its server). During this data retrieval, technical information such as information about the browser, your system, your IP address and time of retrieval are then collected.\n\nThis information is used for the technical improvement of services on the basis of technical data or target groups and their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval points (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or access times. Statistical data gathering also include determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. It is, however, neither our endeavour nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations are rather used by us to determine the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users. Opt-out of this performance measurement is unfortunately not possible; instead, the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled.\n\nYour consent may be withdrawn at any time without prejudice to the lawfulness of the processing carried out to date. You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. You will find a link to unsubscribe from the newsletter at the end of each newsletter. If the consent is revoked, we stop the corresponding data processing.\n\n11. Further Privacy Policy Content\n\n11.1. Google Retargeting\n\nRetargeting Technologies\n\nWe use Google retargeting technologies to offer you advertising on other websites that is as tailored as possible to your interests. Data processing is based on your consent per Article 6 (1)(a) of GDPR.\n\nWhen you visit our website, either identifiers are retrieved from your device or browser, your IP address is evaluated, or a recognition feature is stored as a small text file (e.g. so-called third party cookie) on your device. Your usage behaviour is recorded when you visit various websites. The identifiers are pseudonymous. If you are logged in to your Google account, these identifiers can be associated directly with your profile. Google may associate and store your visits to our websites with your identifiers to show you targeted advertising on other websites. Google can thus also see that you have previously visited our website. Your device and your browser can be recognised by Google in various ways, e.g. when you visit a page that displays advertising on behalf of Google.\n\nRemarketing\n\nWe can add keywords to our websites. These keywords contain statements about the content of the website, such as products offered. Google receives these keywords, which do not contain personal or sensitive information. If you visit a page with certain keywords about products, Google stores a record of your visit and matches it with your pseudonymous identifier. Google can use this link to determine whether our advertisements have been displayed to you, and if so, which ones.\n\nCross Device Remarketing\n\nGoogle can link the pseudonymous identifiers on your devices (tablet, smartphone and email) with each other (cross device marketing). It is assumed that you have agreed to this data processing with Google in the past. This allows Google to target advertising campaigns to your various devices.\n\nYour data is transmitted to Google and stored in the USA. There is an adequate level of data protection per Article 45 (1) of GDPR due to Google’s participation in the Privacy Shield. We have also concluded a contract with Google Inc. (USA) for data processing in accordance with Article 28 of GDPR. Google will therefore use all information strictly and only for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website and compiling reports on website activity.\n\nRight to Object\n\nYou can object to retargeting per Article 21 of GDPR at any time. Please click on the following link: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated\n\nTo opt out of cross device remarketing, please go to the Google website at https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922 and change your personalised advertising preferences. Please keep in mind that these settings may not affect all of your devices. If you use a device with your Google account, pseudonymous identifiers may be assigned to your account. If you do not want this to happen, please log out.\n\n11.2. Online Applications\n\nWe process your personal data in accordance with the applicable data protection regulations and based on Article 26 of the German Data Protection Act. When you apply for a job with us online, we process the data that you disclose to us exclusively for the purpose of selecting applicants. Your data is not processed for any other purpose.\n\nYou yourself decide how much data you wish to send us in your online application. Online applications are transferred electronically to our personnel department where they are processed as quickly as possible. All data transfer is encrypted. As a rule, applications are forwarded to the relevant heads of department in our company. Your data is not transferred to anyone else. Your data will be treated confidentially in our company. If your application is unsuccessful, your documents will be deleted after [6 months].\n\nIf you want us to consider your application for other or future job opportunities, please include a note to this effect in your application. We will then process your data based on Article 6 (1)(a) of GDPR."
