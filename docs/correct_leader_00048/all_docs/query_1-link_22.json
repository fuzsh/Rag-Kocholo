        "text": "Thrilled that my colleagues from The Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM) launched the Canada-Poland Strategic Dialogue with our friends at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. Topics included future transatlantic cooperation, threat perception toward China and Russia (including in the Arctic), and NATO security. Thanks to Balkan Devlen, PhD and Jonathan Berkshire Miller for hosting in Ottawa and looking forward to continue the dialogue in Warsaw soon. Hoping to also see the dialogue mature to a track 1.5 and on to a high-level political one soon.\n\nAnd that's a wrap. The second edition of The Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM) Transatlantic Lookout conference - which took place at the historic Mayflower Hotel in Washington DC - is in the books. Thank you to our panelists Rachel Rizzo, Daniel Fried, Elbridge Colby, Andrew A. Michta, Mark Cozad, Alexander Vershbow, Seth G. Jones, Gen. Rajmund Andrzejczak, Matthew G. Boyse, and Dalibor Rohac for your expertise. Huge thanks to my PISM colleagues Gabriela Surmacz, Patrycja Sasnal, Marcin Terlikowski, Mateusz Piotrowski, Justyna Szczudlik 诗丽娜, Anna Maria Dyner, and Daniel Szeligowski, PhD, and Pawel Burdzy for your insights and for all the hard working in pulling this all together. Now it's on to preparing for the next edition. Here are some key takeaways from the discussions: * For Poland, the bilateral relationship with the USA is key, but Poland also plays a critical role in U.S. foreign policy. In other words, the success of Poland is the success of the United States and vice versa * Victory in Ukraine requires 'political will', not fear about Russia defeated * More Western European countries 'should be like Poland, Baltics, Finland, Romania' and invest more in their own defenses * Europe has to provide the core force in NATO * NATO allies must stop being afraid and prepare a winning strategy * Bilateral energy and defence industrial cooperation can help solve crucial security and climate-change related challenges, but also create jobs in the U.S. and Poland\n\nAnother busy, intense week at the The Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM) Washington DC Office - * experts Tomasz Żornaczk, Kinga Dudzińska, Łukasz Ogrodnik, and Jakub Pieńkowski of the Central Europe program presented their report \"Regional Cooperation in Central Europe after Russia's Aggression against Ukraine\" to local experts and diplomats, including at the United Nations headquarters in New York City * The Atlantic Council's Luka Ignac and Edward P. Joseph of Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) joined Tomasz Żornaczuk for a fascinating discussion on the prospects for EU integration in the Balkans * Dr. Iulia-Sabina Joja - director of the Black Sea Program at the Middle East Institute - joined Kinga Dudzińska and Jakub Pieńkowski to discuss the strategic changes, challenges and threats in the Baltic and Black Sea regions * in addition to meetings with experts and analysts, head of PISM's Central Europe program Tomasz Żornaczuk preented Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) students with key take aways from the report on regional cooperation in Central Europe * PISM expert on European security Aleksandra Kozioł also held consultations with local counterparts, including Jason C. Moyer of the Wilson Center | Global Europe Program\n\nThe Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM) is coming back to Washington for the the second installment of the Polish-U.S. #TransatlanticLookout. Over 4 panels, my PISM colleagues will take the stage with their American counterparts to discuss critical issues impacting the US and Europe, which will undoubtedly frame the transatlantic partnership in the near- and long-term. Conference program and agenda can be found below - more detailsto drop soon. https://lnkd.in/dFrNRcwn\n\nWith Central Europe and the dynamics of regional political cooperation among those states through the many sub-formats getting more and more attention, experts from The Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM) will present key finding from their recent report at the PISM Washington DC Office. Important to the discussion will be how regional cooperation changed following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and possible directions for the future development of deeper cooperation in the context of NATO and the European Union"
