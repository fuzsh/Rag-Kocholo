A proud history

The FAIB was founded in 1949 at the initiative of the leaders of the UIA (Union of International Associations) to draw attention to the existence of international associations in Belgium and to the need of facilitating their activities.

The FAIB has been chaired by great men of State such as Paul Van Zeeland, Albert Théatre and Pierre Harmel, whose objective was to promote the development of international life in Belgium.

While preserving its initial denomination, the word “European” was added to its name in 2004 to emphasize the European nature of the majority of its members.
