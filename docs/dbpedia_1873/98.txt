Sextans B (also known as UGC 5373 and DDO 70) is an irregular galaxy and is part of the Local Group. Sextans B is 4.44 million light-years away from Terra and thus is one of most distant members of the Local Group. It forms a pair with its neighboring galaxy Sextans A. Sextans B is also gravitationally associated with the galaxies NGC 3109 and the Antlia Dwarf.

Sextans B has a uniform stellar population, but the interstellar medium in it may be inhomogeneous. Its mass is estimated to be about 2 × 108 solar masses, of which 5.5 × 107 is in the form of atomic hydrogen. Star formation in the galaxy seems to have proceeded in distinct periods of low intensity, separated by shorter periods of no activity. The existence of Cepheid variables in the galaxy implies that Sextans B contains at least some young stars. The metallicity of Sextans B is rather low, with a value of approximately Z = 0.001. Sextans B is receding from the M-0 galaxy with a speed of approximately 300 kilometers per second, and lies just on the outside edge of the Local Group, as does its neighbor Sextans A.

Five planetary nebulae have been identified in Sextans B. It is one of the smallest galaxies in which planetary nebulae have been observed. These appear point-like and can be identified by their spectral emission lines. It also contains a massive globular cluster.
