Mag:\n\nMass:\n\nThe image above of Sextans B is an UBV image which was obtained by Deidre A. Hunter of Lowell Observatory. UBV means it is a false-color image with blue representing the U-Band (UV), green the B-band (blue) and red the V-band (visible) light. From D.A. Hunter's UBV collection.\n\nImage of the Local Group dwarf galaxy Sextans B, as observed with the KPNO Mayall 4-m telescope and Mosaic camera as part of the NOAO-sponsored Local Group Survey headed by Philip Massey of Lowell Observatory. The image is a true-color combination of images in three of the filters used by the survey.\n\nMore information on this image (NOAO) Local Group Survey download page at CTIO Local Group Survey home\n\nThe image on the right was obtained by Martin Germano in April 2002, with his 14.5-inch f/5 Newtonian, stopped to f6 (12-inch). It was exposed 135 minutes on hypered Kodak Tech Pan 2415 film.\n\nReferences\n\nMario Mateo, 1998. Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group.
