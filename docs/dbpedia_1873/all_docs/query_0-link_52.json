        "text": "Using the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, a Program of NSFâ€™s NOIRLab, astronomers captured the image of dwarf galaxy Sextans B. Located around 4.5 million light-years from Earth, the universe contains the collection of astronomical objects such as bright stars, cradles and the graves of stars.\n\nThe galaxy has a mass of around 200 million times the mass of the Sun. It also contains ruby-red clouds of atomic hydrogen that give birth to brilliant new stars.\n\nSextans B is also known to have several planetary nebulae."
