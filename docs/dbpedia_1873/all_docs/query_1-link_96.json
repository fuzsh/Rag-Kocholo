        "text": "The transition to summer observing, with its planetary nebulae and globular star clusters in abundance, accompanied several changes at ground level for me and the others in the EAS Irregulars. Being generally exhausted from work, I had time only to observe on the weekends; with sunsets being so late in the summer, observing couldn’t even really begin until 11 PM, and I needed to be awake for work by 5:30 to monitor the conditions of my digestive tract before spending the day at an injection press. This meant that at best, I got four nights a month to observe. So many targets, so little time.\n\nThe bigger transition was one of convenience. The great old Caveman-Mobile, which had served me so well for the last eight years in hauling telescopes up mountains and families cross country, had finally developed a chronic-but-incurable ailment; having put several hundred more dollars into replacing nearly everything on the dear old thing that could be replaced, we could no longer justify another $600 repair. It was time to retire the poor beast from active service while its dignity remained intact.\n\nEnter the new Caveman-Mobile, a 2011 Ford Flex—an odd-looking beast that nonetheless somehow had room for the 20” Obsession and all of its paraphernalia and still drove like a luxury vehicle. Mrs. Caveman and her father tracked the monster down near Seattle and flew up to get it, taking it for a high-speed sojourn on the way home. Although I was somewhat dubious of this vaguely station-wagon-looking thing being an adequate replacement—-it seemed too pristine for the kind of heavy lifting needed to get to our sites of night-sky communion—there was no real turning back.\n\nThe Flex’s first excursion to an observing site actually occurred during the day, checking out a site that Dan B had been monitoring for some time. We had been searching for a site closer to town that could serve as a short-night site (i.e. one that we could conveniently use for a couple of hours, as opposed to hauling everything out to Linslaw for a full night’s work), and Dan had found this one—on rural Fisk Road—that appeared to pass muster. It was like a closer, mostly-paved Eagle’s Ridge, an intersection of a couple of gravel roads with a convenient widening to the side of the intersection where several telescopes could be set up. There were a few trees partially blocking the southern view, and the full light-pollution dome of Eugene/Springfield would be mostly visible, but the site seemed adequate for nights when we didn’t want the full drive time to and from Linslaw.\n\nTwo panoramas of the new Fisk site, directions added.\n\nThe weekend after our initial recon of the Fisk site, we headed there for a christening of sorts. With (waning gibbous) Moonrise coming shortly after astronomical darkness, we made it a casual evening; Dan and Alesha, Loren and Donna, and Jerry and Kathy and Dan R joined Mrs. Caveman and I for an on-site potluck to kick off the late May-early June Moondark phase. It was also a night for trying out a couple of recently-donated telescopes: a 130mm Celestron something-or-other that wasn’t a dreaded Bird-Jones-type scope, but was actually rather fine optically, and a really old (1976 vintage) 8” Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain with the classic orange tube and all original accessories. I brought along my own black-tube 8” Celestron—my first telescope—to give it some dark-sky time.\n\nIt was a thoroughly enjoyable evening, with no expectations of serious observing to be done, but lots of high-spirited talk and telescope evaluation. (The 130mm Celestron has since been introduced into the EAS telescope-lending library, while the orange-tube classic 8” still needs some adjustments and fine tuning.) We left after Moonrise, with surprisingly strong winds howling up the road and plans to return the next night for somewhat more serious observing.\n\nI. Jerry, Dan, and I arrived at Fisk well before sunset; Dan and I got there first and did some more exploring of the site, including climbing over one of the berms and checking out a large open field (which was slightly overgrown in patches) that lay beyond the accessible road. We’d never be able to haul larger scopes over the berm, but it was certainly a tempting possibility.\n\nJerry arrived a bit later, bringing with him one of his latest projects: a homemade electric guitar. He and Dan exchanged a few songs (Jerry had an amplifier running off of one of his 12-volt batteries), no doubt annoying some of the neighbors; I had visions of some of the nearby rustics trying to figure out where that rock-n-roll was coming from in the middle of the woods.\n\nDan B in concert. No Stairway!\n\nThe wind howled all night, apparently funneled up the road by the trees. Huddled into a corner of the clearing that was blocked from the brunt of the wind, we still had to deal with its effects, often hanging onto telescopes to prevent them from being buffeted about. The roaring of the wind made my audio recordings a chore to transcribe; in some ways it was fortunate that I only had three sets of notes from the evening. Conditions otherwise weren’t great, either; several intruding waves of cirrus caused temporary havoc as they passed through, and the seeing was particularly poor until after midnight.\n\nIn addition to working on the AL Planetary Nebula program, I’ve also undertaken to take notes on all of the 2450 objects that William Herschel catalogued during his spectacular and unequaled career. With the Herschel 400 and Herschel II programs already under by belt, and a number of others beyond those, I had at least 900 of Herschel’s discoveries in my repertoire. What was particularly welcome about the remainder of Herschel’s objects was that there were hundreds in every season; if I was stuck on another program, or didn’t have the motivation for, say, a list of flat galaxies on a given night, there were always more Herschels to dig into.\n\nTonight’s agenda consisted of both “the remaining 1600” of Herschel’s galaxies, clusters, and nebulae, and several of the planetaries on the Astronomical League’s program list. But I spent the first part of the night (and some time between Herschel objects and waiting for some of the needed planetary nebulae to rise) observing globular clusters, enjoying views of M13, M92, and NGC 6229 in Hercules, along with NGC 5634 in Virgo, M80 in Scorpius, and M71 in Sagitta. When all else is exhausted, globular clusters-—my first and ultimately foremost favorite type of deep-sky object— are a source of unending wonder and cosmic glory.\n\n05/30-31/21\n\nFISK ROAD\n\nSUNSET: 8:47 PM\n\nMOON: 20 days (rose at 12:44 AM; 71% illuminated)\n\nSEEING: 4, 6\n\nTRANSPARENCY: 5, 6\n\nSQM: 21.33\n\nNELM: not checked\n\nWEATHER CONDITIONS: temps to mid-50s; no dew due to strong winds; some cirrus waves throughout the night\n\nOTHERS PRESENT: JO, DB\n\nAll observations: 12.5″ f/5 Discovery Dob, 14mm ES 82˚ eyepiece (112x, 0.7˚ TFOV) or 7mm TeleVue Nagler (225x, 0.36˚ TFOV) unless otherwise noted\n\n10:55\n\nNGCs 5468, 5472 (Vir):This is a Herschel object, while I’m waiting for planetaries to rise in Cygnus, Aquila, Lyra, and Draco; this is NGC 5468 in Virgo, seen in very variable transparency and strong wind. The galaxy is extremely diffuse; there’s no core to speak of, although in averted vision there’s a substellar nucleus that pops into view every now and then (or possibly a very tiny core). The galaxy is round, about 2.0’ diameter, very diffuse and poorly defined. It’s unevenly bright; the interior of the glow is kind of irregular; it appears that there may be a bar or something in it that’s just a touch brighter than the rest of it, oriented almost P-F; it’s hard to hold this for certain, but it’s always the same direction. NF the galaxy by 2’ is a threshold (14.5-magnitude) star. The brightest star in the field is only 4.25’ S slightly F the galaxy and is 8.5 magnitude. Due F the galaxy by 5.5’ is a 13th-magnitude star that has just P it by a couple of arcseconds a tiny faint glow (NGC 5472) that comes and goes with the variable transparency. It’s hard to get a fix on it; it may have a stellar nucleus, as there’s a hint of another stellar object there. From the star just F that galaxy, NP by 0.75’ is a 14.5-mag star. S very slightly F the 8.5/9th-magnitude star by 8’ is a 9.5-magnitude star; then S very very slightly P that star by 4.5’ is an 11.5-magnitude star that has a 14th-magnitude star 0.75’ S very slightly P it. From the 11.5-magnitude star P very slightly N by 6.5’ is an 11th-magnitude star.\n\n11:07\n\nNGCs 5427, 5426 (Vir): This is a really fine interacting pair in the back end of Virgo, NGCs 5427 and 5426, with -27 being due N and considerably larger; there’s a very faint (14th magnitude?) star right between the two of them. NGC 5427 is quite diffuse and not really well defined; it does have a distinctly brighter interior. It’s roughly round, with maybe a tiny bit of P-F elongation; this is indeterminate enough that I’m not going to say anything beyond the fact that it’s 1.67’ round. It’s roughly the same size as NGC 5468, actually, but considerably brighter. As with 5468, there is some inner irregularity to the brightness, if not outright mottling; there’s a very, very slightly brighter core that’s also very small; this is obviously a face-on galaxy. I’m actually going to say this is 1.75’ x 1.67’, very slightly elongated P-F. Every so often, there’s a flicker of a tiny, faint nucleus. (Immediately due S of the galaxy, exactly between the two galaxies, is a 14th-magnitude star that distracts from whether either galaxy has a visible nucleus, but I think they both do.) NGC 5426 is elongated N-S and has a brighter core that’s also elongated N-S within a 1.5’ x 0.75’ halo. The outer edges are pretty unevenly defined, but appear better defined to the S. It almost appears as if the two galaxy’s haloes are trailing slightly to the P, as if they’ve had material pulled off of them in that direction, but this is just an impression and I wouldn’t say anything about it with certainty. This would be a stunning pair in the 20”! At moments, with 5427, I get a feeling like the F edge has a little better definition, or a little more brightness, like there’s a subthreshold spiral arm on the F edge. 5426 also has the occasional flash of a nucleus. The core is 18” long (i.e. between 0.25’ and 0.3’). There is dark space between the two galaxies where the star lies, so they’re two distinct and discrete objects. Some very faint stars lie to the S; there’s a 14th-magnitude star S very slightly F 5426 by 7’; S very very slightly F 5426 by 7’ is another 14th-magnitude star. NF the pair, 11’ from 5427, is a 12th-magnitude star. SP 5427 by 12’ is an 11.5-magnitude star that’s the NP of a very thin flat scalene triangle, with a 12.5-magnitude star F somewhat S by 1.75’; from that star S very very slightly F by 1’ is a 13.5-magnitude star. There’s a very flat isosceles triangle F very very slightly S of 5426, actually a diamond, with the NF vertex very faint compared to the others; the point star in the isosceles triangle, the “roof-top” star, is a very close pair.\n\nWe took SQM readings about midnight, and were surprised to get 21.33s (on average) between us. The sky didn’t really seem quite that dark, due in large part to the unshielded light dome from the cities taking up most of the eastern half of the sky. The trees to the south weren’t a dealbreaker, at least.\n\nWith Cygnus and the higher-declination summer constellations well above the trees to the east now, I stopped by the Veil Nebula, the Dumbbell (which I’d already taken notes on), and the Ring Nebula (which I hadn’t, but I wasn’t willing to take notes on it in less than excellent conditions, as befitting its showpiece status). I also skipped taking notes on NGC 7027 in Cygnus, as it looked somewhat diminished from even my previous observations of it from the Giant City State Park visitor center parking lot. I didn’t want to go home empty-handed on the planetary-nebula front, though, so I revisited an object that I’d recently observed from The Oxbow. It, too, was diminished from its previous apparition, but for reasons unbeknownst to me, I pressed on with the observation.\n\n12:09\n\nNGC 6742 (Abell 50; Dra): After a huge amount of searching (it was a tough starhop from 16 Lyrae), this is the difficult (more difficult than it needed to be anyway) NGC 6742. I had found this previously at the Oxbow under apparently much better conditions, because here it’s a difficult object, really requiring averted vision to pick out at first, and that was not the case at the Oxbow when I saw the first time. It’s about 0.3’ across, round, just on the border between direct and averted vision (depending on the moment-to-moment sky conditions). It’s mostly just above the averted vision threshold, so it is visible in direct, but it’s not easy. It’s just a very round, very faint nebula with no obvious annularity, although the S rim in good moments looks to be a fair bit sharper than the rest. In the moments of much better seeing and transparency that we’re getting through here, the nebula looks substantially bigger; it might be 0.5’. There’s no central star, but it does have a faint star F slightly N of it by 0.75’; that star really interferes with the nebula, and is 13.5 magnitude. Also distracting from the nebula is the 8.5-magnitude star SP it by 3.5’; that star is the N end of a small zigzag of fainter stars; this zigzag is about 3.67’ long and has its second-brightest star (which is 11th magnitude) at the S end. There are a number of brightish stars in the field but the 8.5 to the SP is the brightest. N of the nebula by 9’ is the S end of another asterism of somewhat brighter stars, including a couple in the 9th/10th-magnitude range. With the UHC, the nebula is substantially “better” but pretty small, more like 0.3’ again (how does that work?). It’s significantly brighter now, a solidly direct-vision object. There’s still no annularity, but the S rim definitely seems a little brighter than the rest; it almost seems like the brighter part of the rim lies slightly inside the nebula and there’s some fringe around the S edge. The O-III filter really brings out the nebula! There’s a dramatic difference between the view in the two filters: now, the nebula’s substantially brighter again than in the UHC, which I didn’t expect based on the previous work I’ve done on the AL planetaries. The impression that the S end of the rim is brighter isn’t seen in this filter. Again, the nebula is distinctly round, and still 0.3’ diameter. The seeing’s gone to crap again, but I’ll throw in the 7mm Nagler anyway. Seeing is terrible at this magnification, but the nebula still pops right into view. I’m constantly amazed at how much just increasing the magnification is better than just adding a filter to the 14mm. With the 7mm, I’m still not getting a central star, but the nebula’s yet again much brighter. Adding the O-III makes the nebula almost unviewable in combination with the 7mm. Back to the UHC: it’s at least observable with this filter in the 7mm. The S rim still looks slightly more obvious and brighter than the rest; it’s obviously a UHC feature, and not merely a figment of my imagination. This is not a bad little nebula with the right combo; the 7mm and the UHC work pretty well.\n\nSeveral times during the observation, a curiously warm (almost hot) breeze blew through, wiping out the seeing, drowning out my voice on my notes, and feeling as if—in Dan B’s words—we had “waded into someone’s pee spot in a swimming pool.”\n\nAbout halfway through my notes on NGC 6742, Dan witnessed a brilliant fireball traveling west from Scorpius. As so often happens (to most of us!) during an observing session, Jerry and I were looking in the opposite sides of the sky, missing the meteor entirely.\n\nThe Moon crested the horizon, washing out the Milky Way entirely, completing the job the Eugene/Springfield light-pollution dome had started. We packed up our scopes, unsure of the long-term viability of the site due to the persistent winds, biding our time until weekend nights, Moonless hours, and clear skies coincided again.\n\nII. The next weekend provided a better opportunity for observing, at least on the eastern side of the Valley (i.e. the Eagle’s Rest amphitheater, the only one of our Eagle’s sites that I was willing to drive to). Oddly, only Robert was willing to join me for observing; Jerry had his Friday book club, and Dan and Loren also had other plans. On this particular night, having some extra comrades would’ve likely made a big difference in how the night turned out.\n\nThe “amphitheater” was a roadside pullout big enough for perhaps four cars. Until two years ago, it had been hemmed in by trees to the north and west, and by hills to the east; only the southern horizon—the direction of greatest astronomical interest—was clear, overlooking a steep drop into the valley. Now, though, timber and real estate interests had combined to clear-cut the entire northern quadrant, exposing stargazers to the glare of the double city. In place of the trees, some company had installed a large metal gate, for keeping out anyone who might venture past the roadside and into the clearings they had made. Wind frequently blew from the north and through the gate, adding to the nuisance of the light pollution; to remedy this, we often (as tonight) parked near the fence and parallel to the road, using our vehicles as simultaneous windbreaks and light blockers.\n\nMy agenda was the same as the previous session: Herschels (mostly galaxies) until target planetaries rose. Most of the Herschels were chosen from Alvin Huey’s guide to the Herschel III list, an unofficial list compiled by Thom Lorenzin from the best of the remaining 1600+ objects not included in the Herschel 400 or Herschel II programs. The sky was a cirrusy mess, but was clearing fairly quickly. And exactly two hours after sunset, I got started with my notetaking.\n\n06/04-05/21\n\nEAGLE’S REST (amphitheatre)\n\nSUNSET: 8:52 PM\n\nMOON: 26 days (rose at 3:22 AM; 20% illuminated)\n\nSEEING: 7\n\nTRANSPARENCY: 6\n\nSQM: 21.26\n\nNELM: not checked\n\nWEATHER CONDITIONS: temps to upper 50s; no dew; mild breeze; cool but not particularly cold; considerable haze at sunset which cleared off by 11:30\n\nOTHERS PRESENT: RA\n\nAll observations: 12.5″ f/5 Discovery Dob, 14mm ES 82˚ eyepiece (112x, 0.7˚ TFOV) or 7mm TeleVue Nagler (225x, 0.36˚ TFOV) unless otherwise noted\n\n10:52\n\nNGC 5690 (Vir): While waiting for some of my planetaries to get into a good observing position, we’re looking at some Herschel IIIs in the meantime; this one is NGC 5690 in Virgo, a nice edge-on spiral– not really a flat galaxy because it doesn’t have the right dimensional ratio; it’s about 2.5’ long and 0.67’ wide, elongated due NP-SF (so about 135˚ position angle) and has a very faint (I’m going to say 14.5 magnitude) star on the SF end inside the halo. Observing the galaxy is very difficult because it has a 6.5-magnitude star 3.25’ due P that’s hugely disruptive to the observing. I can’t really get that star outside the field enough to get a good eye on the details here; I can’t tell if the galaxy is mottled and irregularly bright along the length of it, or if it appears that way because it has that threshold star on the end. It’s a pretty fine galaxy, with a pretty well-defined halo. NP the galaxy by 7’ is a 10.5-magnitude star that’s also 5.5’ N slightly P the 6.5-magnitude star. Due SF the galaxy by another 6.5’ is the right-angle vertex of a small triangle; that star is 12th magnitude and has N slightly F it by 1.5’ an 11.5-magnitude star; and then F somewhat S of the right-angle vertex by 2’ is a 13.5-magnitude star. N slightly F the galaxy by another 6.5’ (so almost forming an equilateral triangle with the galaxy and the 10.5-magnitude star) is a 12.5-magnitude star; and F the galaxy by another 7’ is another 12.5-magnitude star that has 0.5’ due P it a 14th-magnitude star.\n\n11:07\n\nNGC 5792 (Lib): NGC 5792 is apparently in Libra, but it’s actually very, very close to the Virgo border; it’s also in the very close vicinity of a distractingly bright star which happens to be P very slightly N of the galaxy by 1.0’. The galaxy is elongated P-F; it’s about 2.0’ x 1.0’, and has a much brighter core region that’s 0.67’ across; every so often there’s a very very brief flash of an extremely faint substellar nucleus. The P-F extensions of the galaxy are very poorly defined and diffuse; they are revealed primarily with averted vision. That core region is pretty bright, though. The star that’s P very slightly N of the galaxy is 9.5 magnitude; there’s another 9.5-magnitude star NF the galaxy by 6’, and that star has a 13.5-magnitude star N very slightly F it by 0.3’, and also has NP it by 1.5’ an 11th-magnitude star. 3.25’ NP the galaxy (so between the galaxy and the 9.5-magnitude star) is a 14th-magnitude star. Also NF the galaxy by 12’ is a 9th-mag star. N slightly F the galaxy by 14’ is a 10th-magnitude star.\n\nAs I was observing NGC 5792, I watched a pair of brightish satellites cross the field, both on the exact same trajectory—most likely some of Elon’s Folly.\n\n11:28\n\nNGC 5921 (SerCap): This is our third Herschel III object while we’re waiting for Aquila and the tail of Scorpius to rise; this is NGC 5921 in Serpens, and it is definitely a more interesting galaxy than should be limited to the 14 mm; I tried the 7mm Nagler, but the sky’s just not good enough for it really; I think this one needs a bigger aperture for a good look. It’s in a pretty crowded field; there is an arc of four stars to the south of it, and the galaxy is also bracketed on the P very slightly N and F very slightly S by stars almost equidistant from the galaxy. The galaxy itself is elongated S very very slightly P-N very very slightly F, about 1.75’ x 1.0’. It has a brightish stellar nucleus and a core somewhat brighter than the halo; the core is extended N-S… I don’t want to say that that’s a bar, but (especially in averted vision) there are definitely hints that that’s the case. The halo is reasonably bright and fairly well defined, and that inner region here is fairly complex; this is one that really would deserve a good look with the 20-inch. (They all do, really.) The number of bright stars in the area of the galaxy makes it a little bit harder to get a focus on it as well: here in the 7mm, the brightest of those stars in the galaxy’s immediate vicinity is F very slightly S of the galaxy by 2.75’ and is 10th magnitude; there’s a 12.5-magnitude star the same distance P very very slightly N of the galaxy, and that star also has between it and the galaxy (so about 0.75’ F very very very slightly S of the star) is a 14th-magnitude star. The arc of four S of the galaxy begins due S of the galaxy by 4’ with an 11th-magnitude star; NP that star by 1’ is a 13th-magnitude star; N very very very slightly P that star by 1.67’ is a 12.5-magnitude star; from the 12.5 magnitude star NF by 1.3’ is a 12th-magnitude star; and that 12th-magnitude star is halfway between the previous star and the galaxy, in a perfect line with those. The brightest star in the field is SP the galaxy by 12’ and is 8.5 magnitude.\n\n12:03\n\nNGC 5962 (SerCap): NGC 5962 in Serpens Cauda is a bright little galaxy, and a pretty impressive one as these things go. It’s elongated P very slightly N-F very slightly S (about 100 degrees position angle) and spans 1.5’ x 1.0’. This one is actually more diffuse than most of the ones I’ve looked at tonight, at least halo-wise, and not particularly well-defined, but it does have a fairly small (0.67’) but gradually much brighter core to it and more than just a hint of a stellar nucleus—in averted vision, anyway; it’s not easy to lock it down, as it’s quite faint. The galaxy lies within a pretty attractive starfield, featuring a wide magnitude range. Due N of the galaxy by 3’ is a 12th-magnitude star; there’s a 13th-magnitude star 4.5’ N somewhat F the galaxy and a 10th-magnitude star 13’ NF. 11’ S slightly P the galaxy is a 10.5-magnitude star, and then F slightly S of the galaxy by 16’ is a 7th-magnitude star that’s kind of in the middle of a N-S oriented asterism; this asterism is about 12’ long and vaguely rectangular. 6.25’ P very very slightly N of the galaxy is the more S of a pair; that star is 11.5 magnitude, and it has a 12th-magnitude star almost due N of it by 1’. This is kind of a nice little galaxy to be relegated to the “other” 1600 Herschel objects.\n\nBy the time I finished with NGC 5962, Scorpius and Sagittarius had risen into a decent position for working through the remainder of their planetary nebulae. I had seen my target planetaries in those constellations numerous times before—especially the Bug Nebula, one of Scorpius’ showpiece objects—but either had no notes on them, or had notes that were inadequate for the fulfillment of the AL program. Whatever the case, it certainly wasn’t a chore to reobserve them (even though I had to be sitting on the ground at the roadside in order to catch them). The only negative was their extremely low declination; the Bug Nebula was only 6˚ or 7° off the horizon, and the two I had on my list after that were of similar declinations. The lousy seeing that low made the observation a challenge, but there was little chance of being able to do better at a future date; I could always observe them again if the seeing in the deep south was better at Linslaw, where we planned to be on Saturday night. Getting these low objects would enable me to work on the several I had remaining in Cygnus the next night. And I didn’t have much time for the Bug anyway, as it would be disappearing into a bank of trees in less than an hour.\n\nRobert left just before I started taking notes on the Bug.\n\n12:59\n\nNGC 6302 (Sco): This is a difficult look way down low at the Bug Nebula, NGC 6302 in Scorpius, down here in the really poor seeing close to the horizon. The nebula is 1.75’ P-F by not quite 0.67’ N-S. It looks very much like a galaxy with a bright core that’s about the central 0.3’ and what looks like a central star visible as a nucleus in the galaxy analogy. The central star is hard to tweeze out from the rest of the brighter central region. The nebula’s very indistinct on the ends; on the P end it looks as if there’s something of a slightly brighter knot present. There’s no color to the nebulosity. SP the nebula by 10’ is what seems to be—it’s truly hard to tell because of the inevitable atmospheric extinction—a 9th-magnitude star. Due N of the nebula by 4.75’ is the N-most vertex of a scalene triangle composed of 12th-magnitude stars; there’s another SP the first by 1.25’ and a third 2.67’ due P from that first vertex. SF the nebula by 3.25’ is yet another 12th-magnitude star, and P somewhat N of the nebula by 2.5’ is an 11.5-magnitude star. Let’s try the UHC; I don’t know that the 7mm is going to be much use down here with the seeing, but we’re eventually going to try it anyway; I want to start with the UHC. The UHC really brightens the nebula. The supposed “central star” seems to be just a point in the brightness of the nebulosity, because it’s very, very bright now in the filter, and that shouldn’t be the case if it’s merely a star. The filter also helped to define the diffuse ends of the nebula: the P end has much better definition now; it’s much more distinct and tendril-like, while the F side is a little more diffuse and doesn’t really come to a distinct “sharpening” like the P side does. In fact, the P side seems a little bit longer, more extended, so the central region is kind of offset to the F. It really does look like a galaxy in this seeing. I think the view with the O-III filter is going to be roughly the same as in the UHC, given how low we are in the sky. With the O-III, the bright tendril on the P end twists N-ward a tiny bit; but the filter really brings out the F side too, the diffuse end which kind of fans out a bit, almost like a guppy’s tail. Again, that central region is almost glaringly bright, but that would imply that there’s not a central star that’s the visual driver of that, because it wouldn’t have brightened that much. So we’re gonna try the 7mm Nagler here. In the 7mm Nagler, that impression that the tendrils on the P end hook N-ward is well enhanced at this magnification. Adding the UHC first to the 7mm, that tendril to the P still gives that impression that there’s a tiny brighter knot at the end of it. It almost reminds me of NGC 772 in Aries, the way the one arm sweeps out, because that’s really dramatic how much more it is on the P than the F. In the O-III, the impression that I had in the UHC that there is more N-S depth along the middle, like there’s a vertical “stripe” there along the middle, is a little enhanced, but it’s really hard to get a focus on anything here. There also seems to be (and I noticed this earlier, both in the 14mm and the 7mm with the UHC) from the bright center NF, there’s just a tiny jut of brighter material out the top of the nebula heading NF, just a couple of arcseconds long; it’s not perfectly P-F and confined to that axis; it’s heading a little bit NF from there. That is a really fantastic planetary, even though the seeing’s not very good for it!\n\nI wasn’t a fan of the amphitheater site as a lone observer. There was too much potential for an encounter with the locals; I was generally not afraid of observing alone, but close encounters of the two-legged kind always made me a bit leery, especially out in the hinterlands like this.\n\nI had previously observed NGC 6563 at the Brothers Star Party in 2017, under much better conditions. Here, again, I had to sit on the ground in order to observe my target, while staring through the densest part of the atmosphere as seen from my vantage point.\n\n1:25\n\nNGC 6563 (Sgr): This one is right in the Teapot spout, and it is NGC 6563, a.k.a. the Southern Ring, although in the 14mm and this low in the sky, there is no real annularity to be had; certainly not in this seeing. (I should say, though, that the seeing really steadies down well, and when it does, even this low, it definitely makes a difference.) The nebula is about 0.67’ round… well, it’s elongated a little bit P-F, so 0.75’ x 0.67’, just a very very slight bit of elongation roughly P-F. Knowing that this is an annular nebula, I’m surprised at how evenly illuminated it is; it’s not like the Cheerio or anything… there may be a a very very very faint rim around the periphery; it’s very hard to hold that impression steady. There’s no central star, no color, but it’s an obvious nebula when you hit the field. A couple of very bright stars are in the field: about 12’ due S is a 7th-magnitude star, while 15’ P somewhat N is a 6th-magnitude star, and from the 6th-magnitude star due SP by 8’ is another 7th-magnitude star—\n\nThe galloping happened before the crash; I didn’t have enough time to get to my feet before something smashed into the metal gate with a loud CLANG. It was a full two seconds before I was able to focus enough to yell at whatever it was, which was my usual tactic when confronted by unwelcome wildlife (skunks aside; I usually just whistle when I know skunks are nearby… for obvious reasons). With the new Caveman-Mobile between me and the gate, I couldn’t see what had collided with the gate, or if it was still there… it seemed to have run off, but what if it hadn’t? It sounded large—bigger than me, anyway—and its footfalls had sounded more than a little like hooves. Perhaps a deer or an elk. But (as Jerry noted after I shared the incident with the other Irregulars) if it was indeed some sort of local ungulate, what had spooked it enough to cause it to run into the gate? Nor did I know, with the Flex in the way, which side of the gate said animal had run into.\n\nRattled by the incident, I lost both focus and interest in NGC 6563. I had no plans to leave, but I certainly wasn’t going to put myself at the disadvantage of sitting on the ground if the same creature—or its pursuer, had there been one—came back for a second engagement. I scrolled through my list via Sky Safari until I found a target that would keep me off the ground, one in good observing position and in an area of sky where the seeing was much better… an object that had bedeviled me the last couple of times I’d searched for it.\n\n1:46\n\nNGC 6807 (Aql): Here we have the utterly-stellar-and-completely-indistinguishable-from-a-star NGC 6807 which, at least in the 14mm at 112x, gives no hint whatsoever as to its identity; you have to really stare at this thing in order to realize it’s not a star, and in a crowded field like this there’s no way you would. It’s roughly the equivalent of a 12th-magnitude star, maybe 11.5, with very, very little to look at; it has just the tiniest bit—I mean, almost imperceptible—of non-stellarness; I had to flicker with the O-III filter in order to make anything out of it. It has a 10th-magnitude star N very slightly F it by 1.5’; there’s an 8.5-magnitude star F somewhat N by 11’. 18’ SP the nebula is the brightest star in the field, which is 6.5 magnitude, and F somewhat S by 20’ are a couple of clumps that could possibly be open clusters; I’m not gonna really do much with those, because I’m here with the nebula and I don’t want to lose it. So let’s go with the UHC, although I don’t think filters are going to have much effect other than brightening it, because it’s so tiny. So with the filter, the nebula is now the equivalent of the 10th-magnitude star N of it, but that’s it; there’s no fringe, no central star, anything, just a faint tiny stellar point. With the O-III, the nebula’s now brighter, considerably brighter, than the star N of it. So upward we go, to the 7mm Nagler, to see if there’s any detail or any improvement in size or anything to distinguish this planetary from a star. With the 7mm, focus is still really problematic; there’s still no distinct means of identifying this as a nebula; it’s just stellar. So we add the O-III… still nothing; still no identifying features; I can’t really focus it sharp enough to tell if there is a disk visible, but it’s now considerably brighter than the star next to it… but that’s all I get with the O-III in the 7mm.\n\nMy stomach rumbled while I was taking notes on NGC 6807. Or perhaps it was a cougar or a ravenous Bugblatter Beast or a sandworm or something. (It was loud enough to register on my audio notes.) Whatever the case, I was distracted enough by the earlier incident that further observing had lost its appeal.\n\nI packed up earlier than I’d intended, leaving my agenda for the evening only half-finished.\n\nIII. I don’t recall (at this remove) why only Dan and I went out to Linslaw the next night; it might have been that the others went out to the amphitheater, or perhaps they just stayed home. Whatever the case, I needed to get out again, if only to put the previous night’s events behind me.\n\nLinslaw was the perfect place to do so. I had no qualms about observing there alone, if need be; the sandstone crag at Linslaw was the only one of our active sites that was unlikely to be encroached on by other people during the night, and we had yet to encounter any wildlife there aside from the tiny, scampering lizards whose scamperings we heard but never saw (and the occasional bat, nighthawk, or owl). Dan was there, anyway, although I also knew that should a Smilodon or some such apex predator choose to add astronomer to its diet, Dan could outrun me by a substantial margin.\n\nBut none of that intruded on the evening as much as the mediocre conditions. By the time astronomical twilight officially ended and the “real” observing began, the SQM was reading a surprising 21.33 (better than the sky appeared), but the transparency and seeing were only passable. The air was cool and damp and clammy. And the sky was lousy with satellites, both to the naked eye and in the eyepiece, as I prowled among the early summer showpiece objects, waiting for darkness to finish falling.\n\nLittle matter, though—galaxies awaited.\n\n06/5-6/21\n\nLINSLAW POINT\n\nSUNSET: 8:52 PM\n\nMOON: 27 days (rose at 3:42 AM; 9% illuminated)\n\nSEEING: 6-8\n\nTRANSPARENCY: 6-4\n\nSQM: 21.33-21.54\n\nNELM: not checked\n\nWEATHER CONDITIONS: temps to mid-40s; heavy dew; air still; cold and clammy\n\nOTHERS PRESENT: DB\n\nAll observations: 12.5″ f/5 Discovery Dob, 14mm ES 82˚ eyepiece (112x, 0.7˚ TFOV) or 7mm TeleVue Nagler (225x, 0.36˚ TFOV) unless otherwise noted\n\n10:58\n\nNGC 5669; PGC 51945 (Böo): I’m working on Herschel IIIs for the time that we have available to us tonight, because I don’t think the conditions are great for doing “serious” stuff; I’m currently looking at NGC 5669 in southern Böotes, which is a large diffuse round glow of irregular brightness. The galaxy’s really poorly defined and large, at about 2.5’ diameter. It has just the barest hint of a core, which is largish but just slightly brighter than the halo; no nucleus is present, but there’s some SP-NF glow in the interior of the galaxy that could be a bar; there could be spiral structure here. The galaxy isn’t bright, certainly, but I’ve been tracking it for a while, and we’re about still about 10-15 minutes from full astronomical darkness; it showed up identifiably fairly early on and I’ve just been following it since then. It’s bracketed to the N somewhat P and due NF by field stars; the star on the N somewhat P is somewhat brighter at 11.5 magnitude and is about 6’ from the galaxy; the one to the NF is about 12.5 magnitude and is 7’ NF the galaxy, and is also the N-most vertex in a small right triangle: the right angle vertex is P somewhat S of that star by 1’ and the third vertex is about 1.3’ almost due S of the first; the right-angle vertex is 14th magnitude; the third vertex is also of 14th magnitude. NF the galaxy by 15’ is a 10.5-magnitude star; there’s also a 10.5-magnitude star P somewhat S of the galaxy by 17’. This galaxy is an impressive sight; I’ll have to re-observe it with the 20 inch. I had an impression that there’s another galaxy [PGC 51945], a really small one, SP of the star to the N slightly P the galaxy by 3.75’ and P somewhat N of 5669 by 6; there’s just a very very very difficult diffuse spot, and that’s really all it is; it’s just a spot that really comes and goes. Averted vision really helps bring it out; I thought I’d seen it early on, but I kind of dismissed it because I couldn’t replicate it, but now it definitely seems like there’s something there.\n\nIn planning for the evening, I had flipped through Alvin Huey’s free PDF guide to the Herschel III objects, a subset of the brightest Herschel objects remaining after the Herschel 400 and Herschel II programs. Due to the unpredictability of the lower altitudes at Linslaw, I planned to stay higher in the sky; this led to wandering the galaxy fields of Boötes and Canes Venatici for the night, rather than trying immediately to finish my planetary-nebula wanderings in the lower reaches of the sky.\n\nMy next target, although I had forgotten so until I actually had it in the eyepiece, was popularly known as the Heron Galaxy, due to its obvious appearance on photographs.\n\n11:34\n\nNGCs 5394, 5395 (CVn): I’ve gone off the path a little bit, because my SkySafari doesn’t have the entire Herschel III in it, but this is the interesting interacting pair NGC 5394 and 5395; 5395 is kind of dominant here because of its size and brightness compared to 5394. This is a really excellent pair of interacting galaxies this has got to be an Arp [Arp 84]. I’ve discovered that a lot of these Herschel IIIs are really kind of crying out for the 20” Obsession to do a little more investigating on them. NGC 5395 is a long N-S slash that’s pretty well defined and has a 13.5-magnitude star just off the S end; it’s about 2.0’ x 0.75’, with a long streak of central brightening down the major axis. There’s nothing really resembling a standard core or nucleus, though. It seems as though the F side is a little better defined than the rest; it’s not a poorly-defined galaxy, but the F edge seems a little sharper, and it’s more diffuse on the P. The central brightening seems offset to the F edge as well. NGC 5394 is 1.75’ N slightly P from the center of NGC 5395. 5394 has a much more concentrated, very small core and a probable substellar nucleus. It’s only 0.3’ diameter. I don’t see actual contact between the galaxies, although I suspect it’s there, just out of reach in the 12.5”. (All field-star distances are from NGC 5395.) N somewhat P NGC 5395 by 10’ is a 10.5-magnitude star; there’s another almost due N of the galaxies, 15’ from NGC 5395. SP the galaxy by 17’ is another 10.5-magnitude star; there’s a 9.5-magnitude star SF the galaxy by 18’. SP the galaxy by 5.75’ is an 11th-magnitude star. S very slightly P the galaxy by 11’ is the N-most of a line of three; that star is 11th magnitude and has an 11.5-magnitude star S very very slightly F it by 0.75’, and then from the 11.5-magnitude star S slightly F by 2’ is a 12th-magnitude star.\n\nI should’ve observed this one with the 7mm Nagler, or at least the 10mm Delos (the best eyepiece I own), but didn’t do so; the excuse I gave myself was that the transparency wasn’t good enough. What really wasn’t good enough was my list of excuses.\n\nI stayed in Canes Venatici the rest of the night. The seeing improved even as the humidity—an infrequent problem up on the crag—increased; the stars shone with a rare steadiness through a visibly-apparent haze.\n\n12:04\n\nNGCs 5112, 5107 (CVn): NGC 5112 is another very diffuse, large, probably close to face-on spiral. (There’re probably a lot of unknown extra galaxies up there in that region that didn’t make it in the Herschel 400 or the Herschel II.) This is a big one, but still fairly bright; it’s elongated F somewhat N-F somewhat S and covers 2.25’ x 1.25’, with a very very diffuse halo and a somewhat-brighter core but no nucleus. It is brighter along the minor axis as well, but in a much more diffuse manner, which is odd for a face-on or inclined spiral and may mean there’s a bar there. (Right now, the seeing’s sharp as a tack.) The galaxy is really poorly defined; its light just falls away into space with no clear boundary to it. The galaxy has a distracting star about 1.75’ S slightly F the center, and that star is 13th magnitude; there are a number of other bright stars in the field that are difficult on the observing. F very very slightly N of the galaxy by 6.5’ is a 9th-magnitude star that has a 10.5-magnitude star F very very slightly N of it by 2.25’ and a 12.5-magnitude star S slightly F the 9th-magnitude star by 3’, and that star has NF of it by 1.5’ a 13.5-magnitude star. N slightly P the galaxy by 10’ is a yellowish 7th-magnitude star that has P very very slightly S of it by 6’ a 10th-magnitude star. P very very slightly S of the galaxy by 17’ is a 9th-magnitude star. Almost due S of the galaxy by 12’ is a 13th-magnitude star, and due P that 13th-magnitude star by 4’ is another galaxy [NGC 5107] which has almost the same orientation as NGC 5112 but is much smaller and somewhat more concentrated; it’s 1.25’ x 0.25’, oriented P slightly N-F slightly S, a thin little short streak of a galaxy. This smaller galaxy is much better defined and fairly faint but still reasonably obvious; it’s well-defined and fairly even in brightness. The 13th-magnitude star that’s due F the second galaxy also has a 13.5-magnitude star F it by 2.75’.\n\nWith the transparency failing, I checked the SQM, expecting no better than a 21.2. The 21.52 it registered was far beyond both what I expected and what the sky appeared to show. I then shone a red light on my scope’s secondary mirror, expecting it to be covered with dew; that too exceeded my expectations by being perfectly clear.\n\nThe sky was clearly diminished from its usually summer clarity, and even from the level it had been as it got dark. I flipped through Huey’s Herschel III guide for another—likely final—target in the vicinity of NGC 5112, something to close out my notetaking for this Moon-dark phase, finding several to choose from and picking the best of the lot.\n\n12:35\n\nNGC 5301 (CVn): This is the interesting not-quite-flat galaxy NGC 5301, which I saw in Alvin Huey’s guide to the Herschel III and assumed would be super easy, but it’s surprisingly… it’s relatively easy, but it’s not quite as impressive as one would expect from the photograph, which kind of gives the lie to the idea of photographs as good indicators, although it’s still a fine sight. The galaxy’s elongated N slightly P-S slightly F, about 2.5’ x 0.75’, so pretty much an edge-on galaxy, but not quite flat; based on the strict definition of a flat galaxy, I don’t think it qualifies. But it’s reasonably bright; there’s no straining to see it. The galaxy is a little brighter on the N end than the S. It’s well defined and not at all diffuse; it has just a strip of central brightening, with a faint substellar nucleus but no core. Due S of the galaxy by 2.75’ is a 12.5-magnitude star; there’s an 11.5-magnitude star SF the galaxy by about 2.5’. The S and slightly brighter of a pair lies NF the galaxy by 4.25’; that star is 12th magnitude and has a 13th-magnitude star N of it by 0.75’. There’s also a 14.5-magnitude star NP the galaxy by 2.67’. The brightest star in the field is 18’ F somewhat N of the galaxy and is 9th magnitude, and it has a 10th-magnitude star due P it by 2.75’. There’s a bright isosceles triangle P the galaxy: P somewhat S of the galaxy by 9’ is a 9.5-magnitude star; there’s a 10th-magnitude star P somewhat S of that star by 5’, and those two form the base of the triangle, and then from the first star NP by 6’ is another 10th-magnitude star; that one’s maybe just a touch fainter than the others.\n\nI checked in on some of the summer globulars, then tore down my gear. Dan was already loaded up, starting down the mountain. I followed a few moments later, the galaxies still wheeling above, their feeble light crossing the vast expanse of space to fall unseen on the sandstone crag.\n\nMay was a busy month, both personally and astronomically. I had ended up starting yet another new job—one much more physically demanding than I’m probably capable of at this point in time, and one that has ended up confining my observing sessions to weekends (generally no more than two per month, given the lunar cycle). Meanwhile, the night skies above transitioned from nearly-endless galaxy fields to the advent of the summer Milky Way and its plethora of “nearby” galactic objects (star clusters and nebulae). This was a chance at some last few flat galaxies until the fall, and the relatively-few planetary nebulae that dotted the spring skies before the rich hunting grounds of the summer took hold of the night.\n\nI. The second weekend in May brought with it our first observing opportunity. Although several members of our group-within-a-group (which we’ve sort-of informally dubbed “The EAS Irregulars”) had plans, those were quickly adapted to allow for some guerilla astronomy on the familiar sandstone crag at Linslaw. With my now-truncated observing schedule, every opportunity was one to be taken. Jerry would arrive after his book club meeting was finished, while Loren and Robert arrived at roughly the same time I did. Feet aching from a week on cement floors, I stayed with the old workhorse Bob the (12.5”) Dob, rather than standing on the ladder beside the 20” Obsession all night.\n\n05/07-08/21\n\nLINSLAW POINT\n\nSUNSET: 8:24 PM\n\nMOON: 26 days (set at 4:29 PM; 11% illuminated)\n\nSEEING: 6, 7\n\nTRANSPARENCY: 6,7\n\nSQM: 21.64 (did not look as good to the naked eye)\n\nNELM: not checked\n\nWEATHER CONDITIONS: temps to upper 40s; some dew; cool and clammy\n\nOTHERS PRESENT: JO, LR, RA\n\nAll observations: 12.5″ f/5 Discovery Dob, 14mm ES 82˚ eyepiece (112x, 0.7˚ TFOV) or 7mm TeleVue Nagler (225x, 0.36˚ TFOV) unless otherwise noted\n\n10:25\n\nNGCs 3501, 3507 (Leo): We’re starting off what may not be a short night with NGC 3501; I wasn’t going to bring the 12.5” scope to do flat galaxy work, but at the end of a long workday I also wasn’t about to bring the 20” and then spend the whole night on the ladder murdering my feet. This is a pretty fine flat specimen here: it’s about 2.75’ x 0.25’, elongated in PA 30˚. The galaxy has fairly even low surface brightness along its major axis. There’s an occasional trace of a nucleus, but not much in the way of a core; in better moments, the nucleus has some distinct presence. It has a neighboring galaxy in the field with it, which I’ll expound on in a bit. There are also some very faint threshold-level stars (as opposed to bright threshold level stars, I guess) F it and NF the galaxy, but they’re very difficult to pin down. NP the galaxy by 7’ is the brightest star in the field, which is 9th magnitude and has N somewhat P it by 3.25’ a 12th-magnitude star. NF the galaxy by 10’ is a 10th-magnitude star that has an 11th-magnitude star N of it by 3’, and that star has just P it the second galaxy (NGC 3507); that star is in the halo of this smaller galaxy, very close to the core. This second galaxy is 1.5’ across, with a very diffuse halo and a somewhat brighter core; in averted vision, it looks like it’s got a stellar nucleus to it, but the nucleus is hard to hold, due in part to the 11th-magnitude star there.\n\nJerry had arrived while I was working on NGC 3501; he and Robert were in the background discussing Elon Musk (and his SNL hosting gig) while Jerry was setting up his scope. The temperature had already plummeted after sunset, becoming surprisingly cool for May, and it was already more humid than usual at Linslaw. With the clammy weather, it was already time for gloves.\n\n11:00\n\nNGCs 3454, 3455 (Leo): NGC 3454 is not an easy target here in the 12.5”; the neighboring galaxy is much, much brighter and much more obvious. The two galaxies bracket an 11th-magnitude star. 3454 is a little needle; it’s pretty small, only 1.25’ long and maybe 10” wide at center, angled in PA 110˚. It has pretty even and low surface brightness; it’s fairly obvious when you know it’s there, but…. The galaxy is about 1.67’ N very very slightly P that 11th-magnitude star. There’s really not a nucleus or a core, anything that flashes out; it’s a fairly evenly bright (evenly dim is more like it) galaxy. Due S of that 11th-magnitude star, by 1.75’, is the companion galaxy (NGC 3455), which is considerably easier to see. It’s 1.0’ round and diffuse; it seems to have some P very very slightly S-F very very slightly N extension, like a bar in it, with a very slightly brighter core in the middle. This extension is slight, and the galaxy spans 1.25’ x 1.0’. F very very slightly N of this galaxy by 5.5’ is an 11.5-magnitude star, and from NGC 3545 N very very very slightly P by another 4.0’ is a 13.5-magnitude star. I like that S-more galaxy a lot; it’s an interesting target, maybe even more so than the galaxy that’s actually on my list. I’ll need to revisit these with the 20” when Leo rolls around again.\n\nAlthough I often reached for the 7mm Nagler for higher-power views of my targets (more often with planetary nebulae, but frequently with galaxies as well), the chill, damp weather helped squelch my interest in doing so this particular night. Even though I was taking notes, I was more inclined to keep my gloves on and my equipment arsenal minimal than I was to be as thorough as I usually was. Obviously, I’ll want to revisit some of these galaxies under better conditions and greater aperture. I could complete the AL’s Flat Galaxy program entirely with the 12.5-inch scope, certainly, but that wouldn’t really do justice to the galaxies I was observing.\n\n11:15\n\nNGC 4019; PGC 37931 (Com): Just following Denebola here with NGC 4019, which may actually be over the border in Coma. It’s not a bright galaxy, but it has some presence in the field. It’s in position angle 135˚, pretty much due NP-SF. It’s fairly small; 1.0’ x 7” or so (these are all so infinitesimally thin… all less than 0.25’, so I might as well just give the major axis on some of them). It’s fairly evenly dim; there’s not much going on visually here regarding core, nucleus, or any distinctive features.. S slightly F the galaxy by 3.5’ is a 14th-magnitude star that has due S of it by 2.5’ a 10th-magnitude star, and every so often in averted vision I get a flash… yeah it’s definitely there, F very very slightly N of the 9.5-magnitude star by 2’ is another tiny faint fuzzy spot [PGC 37931] that forms an almost equilateral triangle with the two stars, the 13th and the 9.5. It’s just a speck. Also P 4019 by 3.5’ is a 12.5-magnitude star.\n\n11:26\n\nNGC 4517 (Vir): A great contrast with the previous, this is the very impressive NGC 4517, inside the arms or the head of Virgo, and it’s a massive galaxy compared to what I’m usually after with these flat galaxies. It’s not a super-bright galaxy, but it’s very, very diffuse and long, elongated in PA… 90˚ (?); it almost reminds me of NGC 3109, the “other” (disputed) Local Group spiral. This is no less than 8.0’ x 1.25’; it’s tapered at the ends, especially the F end, and seems to peter out more in the F half. It’s brighter in the center, but there’s not really what I would actually call central brightening; there’s no core or nucleus or anything. The galaxy shows hints of being irregular in brightness; the S edge is much more distinct and cut off (is this a possible dust lane?). The most noteworthy feature, aside from its hugeness and flatness, is the 11th-magnitude star on the N edge just F center, just on the edge of the halo. Just P the 11th-magnitude star is a kind of a darker vein that runs more P-F (?). That P end, from the 11th-magnitude star P-ward is very irregularly bright or mottled; it seems to have a brighter patch just on the P end before it fades out. Just inside the P end is a threshold star. There are several other noteworthy stars here; F that star, toward the F end of the galaxy and very very slightly N (also outside the halo but by a bit more than the 11th-mag) is a 13.5-magnitude star; those are separated by 3’; 3’ F very slightly S from the second star (so just past the end of the galaxy) is a 14.5-magnitude star. From the 11th-magnitude star due S by 4.5’ is a 12th-magnitude star that is the right-angle vertex of a triangle with the 11th; F very very slightly N of the right-angle vertex by 3.5’ is a 13th-magnitude star; from the right-angle vertex N very very slightly F by 1.3’ is a star of 14th magnitude. That’s a fantastic galaxy!\n\nAlthough these are good notes on NGC 4517—yet another galaxy that needs the extra aperture of the Obsession (really, they all do)—I managed to somehow miss NGC 4517A in the field. Perhaps its surface brightness was too low, or perhaps I rushed too much in my observations.\n\nBy midnight, we’d all had our fill of photons. It had been a fine night’s observing, but the weather won out. I took time for a final object before joining the others in tearing down and heading back to our light-swamped city.\n\n12:19\n\nNGC 4197 (Vir): Remaining up here in the head region of Virgo with NGC 4197, and it’s back to the relatively-smaller galaxies like those I was looking at earlier. This one is pretty faint but fairly unmistakable; it’s immediately noticeable in the field. Position angle about 40-45˚; 1.75’ x 0.2’. There’s not a lot of central brightening but what there is is more toward the S end; the NF end, is much more diffuse than the rest. It’s somewhat-irregularly bright, but not what I would call “mottled.” 1.5’ S of the galaxy is a 14.5-magnitude star; due F the galaxy by 3.75’ is a 12.5-magnitude star that has due S of it by 3.75’ an 11th-magnitude star. Even further due S of the galaxy by 9’ is an 11.5-magnitude star. There’s also a small right triangle whose 12.5-magnitude right-angle vertex is P very slightly S of the galaxy by 6.5’. This is a fairly faint but fairly obvious flat galaxy for this aperture.\n\nII. A week later, it was back to planetary nebulae; these would turn out to be among the most difficult planetaries I needed for the AL Planetary Nebula list owing to their deep-southern declinations. I hadn’t realized, when I initially went through the AL’s list, how many of these there were lurking among the crowded, horizon-hugging fields of Lupus and southern Scorpius; they were a challenge not only because of their low altitude but for the brief period of time each of them remained observable. I had just a month or so for NGC 5873 in Lupus, for example. With opportunities limited, there was no time to waste.\n\nNeeding flat, low southern horizons, Linslaw was the only choice to observe from. (Had we not been effectively banned from using Eureka Ridge, it would’ve served just as well, if dewier.) I gave Alan a lift out; Jerry was setting up as we arrived. Mark, of course, was already set up, and was running his imaging rig through some preliminary paces as I parked the Caveman-Mobile, while Loren was on his way over after work.\n\nConditions weren’t great. The transparency—the clarity of the air—was average at best, with strands of cirrus drifting through; this also affected the seeing (the steadiness of the air). One of these cirrus tides went through as I was taking notes on my first object. The temperature wasn’t unpleasant, though, especially compared to the previous excursion. The waxing crescent Moon was still in the sky, too, and would be until past midnight.\n\nI had my old phone with me, rather than the newer one with the better battery. This meant that I needed to conserve battery power in order to get through the list of objects I’d assembled. And I needed a good run of planetaries tonight, to keep on pace with the AL list; as I intended to reobserve all 110 of the planetaries on the list with the 20” (giving me multiple observations of each), I really needed to get through all of them in the 12.5” scope this year.\n\nIronically, although my first target was indeed a planetary nebula, it wasn’t actually on the AL list.\n\n05/15-16/21\n\nLINSLAW POINT\n\nSUNSET: 8:33 PM\n\nMOON: 4 days (set at 12:32 AM; 16% illuminated)\n\nSEEING: 5 (3)\n\nTRANSPARENCY: 6\n\nSQM: 21.58\n\nNELM: not checked\n\nWEATHER CONDITIONS: temps to mid-40s; no dew; mild breeze, cool to cold\n\nOTHERS PRESENT: JO, AG, LR, MW\n\nAll observations: 12.5″ f/5 Discovery Dob, 14mm ES 82˚ eyepiece (112x, 0.7˚ TFOV) or 7mm TeleVue Nagler (225x, 0.36˚ TFOV) unless otherwise noted\n\n10:15\n\nIC 972 (Vir): IC 972 here, in Virgo, is the first one of what hopefully is a productive evening of planetary nebula hunting here at Linslaw. The Moon is still being a bit of a problem right now. This is a very indistinct not quite 1’ diameter glow with some slightly uneven brightness. It’s very diffuse and quite difficult here in direct vision in the 14mm unfiltered, with the Moon still being problematic; averted vision helps a great deal. I suspect this is actually not a bad little nebula when the moon isn’t a problem. The nebula has NP it by 3.67’ a 12th-magnitude star, and it has 2.5’ N very very very slightly F it another 12th-magnitude star; continuing 6.5’ N very very slightly F the nebula is a 9.5-magnitude star that has an 11.5-magnitude star SF it by 1’. NP the 9.5-mag star by 5’ is an 11th-magnitude star; from the 9.5-magnitude star 6.5’ almost due N is another 9.5-magnitude star, and there’s a 10th-magnitude star NF that star by 3’. Going to go ahead and throw the UHC in the UHC pops the nebula out well, but it’s still diffuse and undetailed. Maybe 0.67’ or 0.75’ diameter. Every now and then in averted, it looks like there’s some “shape” to it other than just being round. There’s no central star or anything at this magnification. The O-III definitely bumps the contrast on the nebula way up: the edges of the nebula in the O-III have more distinctiveness or definition to them; I’m still not 100% sure of annularity, color, or any other detail. This is the only view where the nebula is a little “crisp” around the edge. Averted vision still really helps. There seems to be something at threshold level on the NP edge, even in the filter (so it wouldn’t be a threshold star), a little stellaring of nebulosity that’s very tentative.\n\nThe International Space Station made a spectacular pass overhead as I was observing IC 972; earlier, the Chinese equivalent had made a scene itself, traveling in a roughly-perpendicular trajectory. Jerry tracked the ISS in his scope, announcing that the solar panels were quite visible on this pass. (In fact, the number of naked-eye satellites visible on the night was kind of ridiculous… and would become even moreso quickly.)\n\nI wandered about the sky for a while, waiting for my next target to reach a favorable position. With Ophiuchus well placed, I took a tour through some of its globular clusters, also stopping by its brightest galaxy, NGC 6384. I also paid a visit to an old friend, NGC 5894, a small, visually-unremarkable globular cluster in the tail of Hydra. One of the Milky Way’s most distant globulars, NGC 5894 was also one of the prized observations from my early days as an observer, when I found it from the garishly-overlit skies of Cincinnati with a “mere” 8-inch scope.\n\nI heard a shout—from Robert, I think—and turned toward the direction the shouter had indicated. It took no time at all to see what the commotion was about: across the northern sky wormed a greenish glow, at least three, maybe four, degrees long, changing shape as it crawled from east to west. Although it was dark, I didn’t need light to tell that all eyes on the crag were glued to the weird, squirming green coil making its way through the sky.\n\nThe telescope wasn’t necessary to identify this particular flying object—or series of flying objects, as we all knew it to be. This was a chain of Starlink satellites, recently launched, the folly of our recent Saturday Night Live host. Bob the Dob split them with ease, a whole string of fast-moving starlike specks flashing through the eyepiece field. I lost count; there were sixty in the chain, but I didn’t stay with them that long in the scope. The naked-eye view was the most compelling; we followed the chain until it faded from sight behind the small copse of trees atop the bluff and into the dome of the city, blocked from our view by the sandstone crag.\n\nFifteen minutes later, we had only just gotten back to our individual tasks when a glorious meteor fireball gashed its way across the southern sky, almost completely east to west, leaving a persistent smoke trail behind it. I’m pretty sure we applauded; whatever successes we each had on the night, just being at Linslaw for the night’s fireworks was enough. We’d hit the most dramatic man-made and natural sights imaginable in the night sky—how could those be topped?\n\nWe followed up with an observation of the brilliant nova in Cassiopeia. Not as spectacular to our eyes as what we’d witnessed already, but even moreso when the astrophysics involved were weighed in. It was astonishing that this nova was still a going concern to such a degree; discovered in March, the nova had continued to flare, reaching naked-eye brightness the week before this.\n\nThen it was back to my list, and an object far off the beaten path. The Moon was still present, low in the west. More intrusive was the flickering screen on the back of Alan’s camera, a neon-sign glow straight ahead that (albeit dimly) lit up the ground in front of me every few seconds.\n\n12:40\n\nNGC 5873 (Lup): This is one of the more difficult sightings I’ve done, ever: a planetary in Lupus, NGC 5873, which is tiny and faint and difficult in the poor seeing down this low… and we are really low, a couple of degrees above the horizon tops [8˚ from the horizon, 6˚ from the mountaintops], about a Telrad and a half diameter off the horizon. The nebula is faint, but it’s also identifiable fairly quickly as being just barely non-stellar. The nebula serves as the NF vertex of a diamond having a star of equal magnitude (and I’m actually gonna say that equal magnitude is 11th) P very very very slightly S of it by 1.75’; S very very very slightly P by 2’ is a 12th-magnitude star, and from the nebula SP by 3.25’ is a 12.5-magnitude star; those stars comprise the diamond. Due N of the planetary by 4.25’ is a 12th-magnitude star, and then from the nebula due NF by 5.5’ is a 9th-magnitude star. F very slightly S of the nebula by 15’ is the N-most of a pair of nearly equal-magnitude stars oriented N very very slightly P-S south very very slightly F to each other, separated by 0.5’, with the N one the brighter; those are 9.5 and 10.5 magnitude; SP the brighter one by 2.75’ is another 9.5-mag star. I suspect that with the filters, there still won’t be much to look at, and this is a very difficult object anyway; it’s so far south to be notable as a planetary of the stellar variety, and I don’t think anything’s going to be much useful for it. Wow, did the UHC filter just blow that up! The nebula’s a rival for the brightest thing in the field now. There’s still no detail, but it’s definitely a remarkably bright little thing with the filter in.. I don’t think I would’ve ever known that this was down here (or bothered with it) without it being on the AL list. I’m not even going go to the O-III; I’m just going to put the 7mm in here and see what happens. The seeing is just terrible down here… OK… there’s almost no way to get a focus on anything down here with the 7mm; still, it’s slightly larger than stellar. It may be a little bit elongated, maybe, with some SP-NF elongation. Adding the UHC in here with the 7mm… with the UHC, it’s still really bright, but anything detail-wise is washed out by the low altitude and crappy seeing.\n\nJerry and I took SQM readings with the Moon now set; it was useful to occasionally use both his SQM and the one owned by EAS (currently in my possession) to keep track of their calibration with each other. We each had several readings of 21.57 and 21.58 over in the vicinity of Corona Borealis (a useful part of the sky for such readings, due to the relative sparseness of the starry background there), the close agreement likely demonstrating that both meters were in good working order.\n\n1:40\n\nNGC 6072 (Sco): After a side detour to poke around with M5 and Seyfert’s Sextet, this is NGC 6072, again way down scraping the horizon, and it’s a much more impressive specimen that it has any right to be down that low. It’s about 0.75’ around and irregularly bright across its dimensions; it’s brighter more N-S than P-F, with the F edge especially kind of vague and ill-defined. The nebula is very irregularly round, and not well defined at all (this is with no filter); it’s very obvious even with no filter, and even down this low (it’s less than 8° from the mountaintops here). It’s surrounded to the roughly P and roughly F by a bunch of fainter stars in the 12th/13th magnitude range. Due N of the nebula by 7’ is an 8.5-magnitude star (I probably need to account for extinction more than I am). That 8.5-magnitude star is actually the point of a narrow isosceles triangle, and has F somewhat N of and NF it by 6.5’ each a pair of 10th-magnitude stars, and those are themselves separated by 2.5’. P slightly N of the nebula by 2.25’ is a 12.5-magnitude star that has another 12.5-magnitude star almost due P it by 1.5’. F by 4’ is a 12.5 magnitude star that has NF it by 1.67’ a star that looks to be an actual double and has a fainter companion S very very slightly F by 15”; those are 12th and 13.5 magnitude; and the brighter of that pair has a 12.5-magnitude star N very very slightly P it by 1.25’. This seems well worth taking the time to examine; it’s by far the best planetary of the night so far, so we’ll go ahead with the UHC: it’s hard to get focus down here, but the filter provides a nice contrast boost, although the seeing’s still so poor. This planetary almost resembles a small, very distant globular, not like a galaxy like some of these other fainter, mid-sized ones do. The O-III really brings out the brightness of that N-S axis in a way that the UHC did not. I want to say that it’s elongated that direction, but it isn’t; it’s almost like the Dumbbell, round but much brighter in one axis, almost like a bar across the middle of a rounder general glow. Aside from that, there’s just not much else coming through, so we’re going to head on to the 7mm. [Going to pass on Ton 2, which I’d hoped to scout for, because the sky isn’t good enough. The advantage to working this low in the sky: I can use my chair as a table, as I’m sitting on the ground.] So the 7mm… seeing is crap down there, and I don’t know that the 7mm is bringing out any more detail. (I feel like these notes are poor quality, but I can’t do much with nebulae this low.) The S edge seems more well delineated, a little sharper than the rest of the nebula; the interior brightness is quite irregular. 1/3 of the way from N-S, there’s a roughly P-F kind of dark slash or occlusion against the brighter part of the nebula. I don’t know at this point if filters even have any use, what with the terrible seeing this far south. There’sa kind of vaguely Dumbbell-ish impression in terms of overall shape, but… it’s really, really hard to make out anything in the way of detail, other than the fact that there’s detail to be had that I can’t make out.\n\nOn some of these nebulae, I feel like I have to wrack my brain to come up with enough of a description, particularly when the sky conditions won’t support the observation. This is how I end up with long sets of notes on some of the tiny, stellar objects like NGC 5873. NGC 6072 was a considerably more impressive object, but I still found myself sometimes grasping at barely-relevant thoughts while trying to make this one seem more memorable than it might have really been.\n\nNote to self: get a new, better O-III filter. It’s past time.\n\n2:06\n\nNGC 6153 (Sco): NGC 6153 is showing up really well considering its closeness to the horizon; I would be willing to say it’s less than 4° above the horizon here, because we’ve got a couple of hills that rise a couple of degrees above the actual horizon. (I starhopped from NGC 6139, the globular up there, to find it; we’ve hit this nebula right at the meridian by sheer luck.) The nebula is very obvious; it’s smallish, roughly 0.3’ around, maybe 0.4’, but it’s the southern vertex of a very compressed diamond which is longer in the P-F axis than the N-S axis, at the S end of which is the nebula. The middle of this nebula is pretty nicely bright, but there’s no central star to speak of, although it kind of hints that there may be. The F side of the nebula’s a little bit sharper defined, but that’s all relative down in this muck. The N-S axis on this diamond is about 2.75’, and the star at the N end of that axis, again with no accounting for extinction, looks to be of 10th magnitude. The P-F axis is about 4.25’; the star at the F end of that axis is the brightest not just in the field, but certainly the brightest in the diamond at 8th magnitude; there’s a 10th magnitude star at the P end of the P-F axis. The 8th-magnitude star is NF the nebula by 2.67’ and the star at the P end of the axis is 2.75’ from the nebula. The 8th-magnitude star is also the primary of a pair/double, with a 14th-magnitude star FvvsS by 15”. From the P end of the diamond, P slightly S by 3.75’, is an 11th-magnitude star that may be double, but I can’t tell in the seeing, and SP that star (the supposed double) by 2’ is an 11.5-magnitude star. The UHC filter does basically nothing; the field looks almost unchanged. So out with that filter and in with the O-III; I think this nebula will shine a bit in the 7mm, as I’m still impressed with how good the nebula looks despite the conditions. In the O-III, it’s really bright, but the focus just isn’t happening. It’s more evenly illuminated with the O-III. The 7mm Nagler doesn’t let me focus at all down here, but it does show some irregularity to the outside of the nebula’s rim; it’s definitely more indistinct. No central star is visible at either magnification; the seeing is so poor I’d never be able to focus on it if there was one. The S arc of the nebula is a little brighter than the rest, but only very vaguely; certainly the S half is a bit brighter and better defined than the N. I’m sure this would be a really nice object even from 10˚ farther south.\n\nLoren began packing up for the drive home, citing the wounded pride that comes with difficulty in finding some of one’s targets for the evening. He was doing far better than I was at the same stage of our observing careers, having completed the Herschel 400 only two years after getting involved with astronomy, and currently working on carbon stars; finding an individual, specific star in an out-of-the-way starfield in some obscure constellation takes a lot more skill than one might think.\n\n“The Universe is a harsh mistress,” I replied, citing a much-loved (and very true) aphorism on amateur astronomy.\n\nI’ve often likened astronomy to fishing—sometimes the process is the only reward a session provides. The fish aren’t biting; the faint glimmer of a galaxy just eludes even a skilled observer. There’s the enjoyment of the search, or of being on the water, but the fisherman or observer ends up with an empty bucket, and the communion with nature is the only takeaway. Regardless, it’s a more-rewarding pursuit than being blasted with televised nonsense or frittering away slivers of one’s lifespan (and intelligence) on Internet detritus.\n\nTime and energy were running low. All that remained on my agenda for the evening was a re-observation of a planetary I’d caught before from Eureka, but on a much better night than this one; unsatisfied with my notes from that (seemingly-ancient) session, I’d resolved to do better. The results were mixed, to say the least. I’d hoped to also get the Bug Nebula, NGC 6302, only a few degrees away from my current target, but my phone battery had also dwindled to a minimum.\n\n2:29\n\nNGC 6337 (Sco): This is not an easy find compared to the last two, but it’s there and distinctly so; it’s much better in averted version. This is NGC 6337, the Cheerio Nebula, and with the greyness of the sky down there and the poor seeing, it’s a tough catch. It’s a very ill defined… I shouldn’t say ill-defined, because the edges are decently defined, but the glow itself is not really an easy one to hang on to. Moving the field, or moving the scope, helps a great deal, but it’s still pretty ghostly; you can barely see it in direct vision, and averted helps a great deal—in averted vision, it’s quite apparently round. But it’s just a ghostly disk about 0.75’ across. It’s relatively easy to see that there’s a nebula there; it just might catch the attention without knowing that it’s there, as it’s fairly obvious though quite faint. A number of faint field stars are nearby and detract from the view; the brightest of these are SF and NF, with the one to the SF the brightest in the field at 10th magnitude, while the one to the NF is 11.5 magnitude. The 10th-magnitude star is 3.5’ from the nebula, and the 11.5-magnitude star 2.75’, and those are separated by 4.25’. There’s a very, very thin scalene triangle of stars to the N slightly F of the nebula by 13’; the brighter of the two P stars is the brightest in the field, 18’ N slightly F the nebula, and it has SP it by 0.3’ the second star; those are 8th and 10th magnitude respectively; there’s a 9th-mag F very very slightly N of the brighter star by 2’, and that triangle is the signpost for finding the nebula. In the poor seeing, all of the stars look like they’re all underwater. The UHC just pops this sucker right out! The nebula is 0.75’ across, and with the UHC one can definitely suspect the annularity. The ring itself seems to stand out a bit more from the darker interior. Averted vision is still a big help in observing the nebula. There seems to be a star on the SP just outside the nebula that wasn’t possible to separate from the glow of the nebula without the filter; that’s unusual. But the central star and the other stars that I know are “within” the nebula aren’t visible at all. With the O-III, the view is roughly similar to that in the UHC, but the O-III brightens the center of the nebula to an extent that the annularity is harder to pick out. There’s no color, no central star… but in averted the annularity seems reasonably strong. The rim seems strongest on the NP. Using the 7mm Nagler, unfiltered, it’s still visible. There’s definitely a star on the SP just outside the nebula; there’s also one on the N very very slightly F as well. With the UHC/7mm, the nebula’s barely visible. The annularity now seems as if the F edge is better defined than the rest. The O-III doesn’t do a good job with it; especially in the poor seeing, although it does make the annularity stand out.\n\nLoren left first, with some trepidation. Living in Springfield, he had a longer drive home than any of us. And none of us knew of any 24-hour gas stations along the way. I always made sure to keep the van at least ¾ full when driving out to Linslaw, but I’d also run afoul of the fuel gods while observing. It wasn’t a comfortable feeling. We only half-kiddingly promised to give him a lift home if he ran out of gas along the way; I offered to let him spend the rest of the night at the Caveman Cave if he didn’t think he could make it all the way home. My voice was thoroughly hoarse from all of the notetaking and chatter of the evening, and the need to talk above the considerable breeze that rumbled in the background (and frequently the foreground) of my audio notes.\n\nAnd so closed May’s first Moon-dark phase. When we reconvened at month’s end, it would be under significantly-different circumstances.\n\n(Loren made it home; the gas station on the far west outskirts of Eugene was indeed a 24-hour stop.)\n\nOur first observing session of the April Moon-dark phase happened without me; Robert and Jerry stopped by the Eagle’s Rest “amphitheater” on the 9th to catch a few photons before the clouds rolled in. It was two nights later, on Sunday the 11th, that I was able to come down from the trees and gather up some starlight. Of the rest of the EAS Irregulars (as we dubbed our little group-within-a-group), only Jerry was undeterred by the weather forecast.\n\nI.The Clear Sky Chart forecast called for clear, mostly-transparent skies with poor seeing and 12-16 MPH winds, but that wasn’t quite what we got. Some high clouds drifted through during the early part of the session; this was common at Linslaw, with the ocean less than a half-hour’s crow flight away. The seeing wasn’t great, but wasn’t as terrible as expected, although the transparency wasn’t quite as good as the prediction, either—at least early on. The wind was another matter, though; it rumbled and roared on my audio recordings of the session, and occasionally drowned out my voice. It also made it difficult to work on planetary nebulae, as I had to let go of the scope at times in order to swap out eyepieces and nebula filters, leaving the scope at the mercy of the wind. (You wouldn’t think a 75-pound telescope would be vulnerable to a 20MPH wind, but such a finely-tuned and –balanced instrument is easy to blow off course in an unexpected gust.)\n\nBut we prevailed, as we had to in order to glean ancient starlight from the sky we were given.\n\n04/11-12/21\n\nLINSLAW POINT\n\nSUNSET: 7:52 PM\n\nMOON: New\n\nSEEING: 6, 7\n\nTRANSPARENCY: 6, 8\n\nSQM: 21.78\n\nNELM: not checked\n\nWEATHER CONDITIONS: temps to upper 30s; no dew; very windy; high clouds early\n\nOTHERS PRESENT: JO\n\nAll observations: 12.5″f/5 Discovery Dob, 14mm ES 82˚ eyepiece (112x, 0.7˚ TFOV) or 7mm TeleVue Nagler (225x, 0.36˚ TFOV) unless otherwise noted\n\n9:06\n\nStruve 742 (Tau): Up here at Linslaw with Jerry on what’s turning into a breezy night, looking at a Struve double star I’ve stumbled across between the Crab Nebula and the outer horn of Taurus: the two are not quite equal magnitude; the preceding of the two (they’re roughly P-F) is a little bit fainter. I’m gonna say those are 7th and 7.3 magnitude, separated by about 7” [actually 4”].\n\nI don’t normally take notes on double stars, unless they’re on the Astronomical League’s double-star list, and then there’s a sketch involved with the note-taking. But this one was pretty striking, and well worth the effort; I swept over it while looking at the Crab Nebula. And then it was on to planetary nebulae, and one that I’d started back in March only to give up for a better night; tonight wasn’t great, but was better than my previous attempt.\n\nThe wind and the cold combined to make the observing rather uncomfortable; I was already stopping to put my gloves on.\n\n10:01\n\nAbell 21 (Gem): Abell 21 is the first object on tonight’s agenda here at Linslaw, on a not horrendously cold, but very gusty, windy night so far on the crag. Seeing and transparency are a little bit iffy, or a little bit variable, rather, so things have come and gone a little bit; at the current moment it looks a bit better than it did earlier, so we’re gonna presumptively go ahead and start the notes here. The nebula is a very, very indistinct gossamer glow some 12’ roughly SP-NF, and is definitely weakest on the NP. I unfortunately know a little bit more about this nebula visually than I like to know before I find something, but it is definitely distinctly not a full annulus—rather a crescent—with the opening to the P, especially the NP. The brightest portions of the nebula are those to the F and SP. The F-most (and brightest) portion lies between a 10.5-magnitude star 7’ S very very slightly F the nebula’s center and an 8th-magnitude star 18’ N very very slightly F the center. Those two stars are about 24’ apart. 9’ N of the 10.5 magnitude star (so between the two stars) is an 11.5-magnitude star, and one of the brightest portions of the nebula is 4’ N slightly P that star; it’s a very ill-defined slightly-brighter patch roughly 1.25’ diameter; it’s very very very indistinct and tenuous. Running from that brighter patch and through the 11.5-magnitude star for 8’ is one of the brighter arcs of the nebula, helping to define the nebula’s F edge. 6’ NP the 10.5-magnitude star is the middle of a 6’ long spray of ten 13th/14th-magnitude stars; that spray runs NP-SF. N of the middle of that spray by 3.67’ is another very ill-defined patch of nebulosity; it’s on the nebula’s SP quadrant and due N of the middle of the spray, and is roughly 1.67’ diameter. There’s not really anything that could be identified as the central star; it’s so poorly-defined that it’s hard enough just to identify the center of the nebula. At the moment, the F arc of the nebula is a little bit more apparent, running along through the 11.5-magnitude star.\n\nWith the UHC… that’s really impressive! One would expect the glow of the nebula to pop out more, and it really does; the arc on the F side, in particular, takes on a whole new life. The filter almost completes the arc of the whole nebula, from the F side all the way around; the brighter patches I’d noted previously are considerably brighter still. In averted vision, the whole area of the nebula seems filled with nebulosity, as opposed to being a crescent shape; it seems more completely filled-in than it is in reality. The arc to the SP is substantially brighter and runs 3’ x 1’ P slightly N-F slightly S. It’s gained a lot of “bulk”; this is the area the filter improves the most, even more than the F-most. From the 11.5-mag star on the F arc up to the brighter node on the NP is significantly brighter as well—not quite as much as the SP portion, but it makes the whole F arc of the nebula substantially more impressive. Rocking the scope back and forth really brings out the interior of the glow, where the annulus should be. (Got a lot to talk about for something so indistinct and vague.) This is really impressive with the UHC. The NP quadrant, where the nebula’s kind of broken open, almost has a straightish edge across it, that edge of the really faint nebulosity; it’s not razor-straight but generally so from the N edge down to the SP. The O-III really brings the whole nebula into view. Those two brighter chunks are quite obvious now, especially for an Abell planetary. The F (outer) rim of the F arc, between the 10.5- and 11.5-magnitude stars, is a little better defined, a little bit sharper than the rest of it (I didn’t notice this with the UHC). This is not at all an obvious object, but averted vision and rocking the scope make it stand out from the background.\n\nWhile I was taking notes, Jerry and I also discussed a couple of extragalactic supernovae that were currently visible: one in NGC 3310—which Jerry looked for with his 12” binoscope, but couldn’t find; and the one in IC 3322A, which he did find, and which I would visit later.\n\nAnd then it was off on an extensive hunt for another planetary rather similar to Abell 21. The wind continued to rage (somewhat mildly, admittedly, but it felt like rage to those of us on the sandstone crag).\n\n11:05\n\nJnEr1 (Lyn): After a great deal of searching and having to start over a couple of times during the search, using 27 Lyncis as the “home star,” I have finally—and only through the use of the UHC filter—been able to extract Jones-Emberson 1, the Headphones Nebula, from the background. It’s being very difficult tonight; I’ve seen it before, under slightly worse conditions darkness-wise, and it appeared better than this, but we’re gonna take what we’ve got. The nebula–and I have the UHC in at present–is a glow of approximately 6’ diameter. It has a couple of embedded stars in it: a 13th-magnitude star just outside the N edge of the nebula, and a 13.5-magnitude star to the S that’s somewhat inside the nebula. F slightly N of the nebula by 7.5’ is a 10.5-magnitude star that serves as the F-most vertex of a small isosceles triangle, the N and S sides of which are 2.25’ and the P side of which is 1.67’; the NP vertex is 12.5 magnitude and the SP vertex is 14th. N very slightly P the nebula by about 9’ is an 11th-magnitude star. Due P the nebula by about 6.5’ is an 11.5-magnitude star, and then almost due S of that star is another 11.5-magnitude star which lies 8’ from the middle of the nebula. Every so often the transparency seems to improve a little bit, and in averted vision a hint of annularity to the nebula becomes visible, with brighter portions along the rim to the NP and SF; these are very indistinct though—this nebula’s actually worse than Abell 21 in that regard; the outer edges here are much less distinct than they were in the Medusa. With no filter, I’d be really hard-pressed to tell there’s anything in the field, even in averted vision. [There’s a bright asterism that I’ve used as “home” for the nebula, consisting of an almost-equilateral triangle of 9.5/10th-mag stars, and that is 1.3/1.75’ on a side; S and SP that triangle is an arc of three, the N-most of which is the brightest in the field at 9th magnitude, and then P very very slightly S of that by 4’ is an 11.5-mag star; from that star P somewhat N by 2.67’ is a 10.5-mag star.] With the O-III, the disk of the nebula is visible in direct vision, but there’s not even the sense of annularity there was in the UHC; I’m still getting a little more definition on the NP and SF arcs, where the “headphone cups” must be, although this is in part an averted-vision thing. Even though it doesn’t show a regular annulus, there’s definitely irregularity in the interior brightness, but it’s very indistinct as to discreet details. (Rocking the scope helps.)\n\nJerry was currently observing one of the many galaxies dubbed “The Needle Galaxy,” this one NGC 4424 in Canes Venatici. I turned my attention to an object I’d attempted to find several times over the years, unsuccessfully, and one not on any of the AL lists I’d been working on. It had been discussed recently online, and that discussion had refueled my determination to find it. With clear(ish) skies and some extra time, I wasn’t going to let it go this time, even with the wind howling in the background.\n\n11:34\n\nFrosty Leo (IRAS 09371+1212; Leo): One that’s not on the Astronomical League list, but has been much discussed on CloudyNights this week; this is Frosty Leo, IRAS 09371+1212, and boy, is it a tiny little bastard, but one that’s considerably bright. Even in the 14mm it’s clearly non-stellar: it actually looks extended N very very very slightly P-S very very very slightly F and perhaps 8” x 5”. N slightly F this protoplanetary by 0.75’ is a 12.5-magnitude star, and that star is the S-most vertex of a diamond that consists of two other 12.5-magnitude stars and a 14th-magnitude star: N slightly P that first 12.5-magnitude star by 2.5’ is another of the same magnitude, and then NF the first star by 2.75’ is yet another of magnitude 12.5, and then 3.5’ N slightly F from the first 12.5-magnitude star is the 14th-magnitude star. The brightest star in the field is N slightly P the nebula by 12’ and is 8th magnitude, and it has 2.5’ N slightly P it an 11.5-magnitude star, and then S of the nebula is a line of four stars that’s about 10’ long and consists of three 12th/13th-magnitude stars (actually two more of magnitude 12.5 and a pair that’s almost due S of the nebula; the pair consists of 13th- and a 14th-magnitude stars, separated SP-NF each other by 10”, with the SP star the brighter), and an 11.5-magnitude star which is at the SP end of that line; the line is actually angled P somewhat S-F somewhat N and the F-most star (one of the 12.5-mags) is F somewhat S of the nebula by 5.75’. This nebula definitely needs the 7mm Nagler, but first… I know it’s a protoplanetary but I’m going to try the UHC anyway, even though I don’t think it’ll do much of anything. And my suspicions are confirmed; the UHC doesn’t really do much of anything to improve the view. It’ll be a function of magnification to make any difference. So because the UHC did nothing, I’m going to skip trying the O-III and just plop the 7mm in here. In the 7mm, every so often the transparency clears, giving the nebula a distinctly bilobed character. It’s clearly elongated NsP-SsF, and big enough that I might’ve given this a second look while sweeping the field. The N lobe looks a little smaller than the S one, and in moments of great clarity, there’s a (possibly illusory?) trace of space between the two lobes.\n\nJerry had somewhat miraculously tracked down Hoag’s Object—a perfect ring galaxy in Serpens, and a difficult target even in much larger scopes—in his binoscope while I’d been taking notes, but he did stop over to check out Frosty Leo. (It’s called “Frosty Leo,” by the way, because of the amount of water ice that’s been detected within the nebula.)\n\nOne character flaw that had been bothering me in my recent observations was my unwillingness to use more of my eyepiece arsenal in observing some of these difficult objects. In addition to the 14mm and 7mm eyepieces (the latter belonging to EAS), I had at my disposal a 6mm Radian, a 4.8mm Nagler, and my prized 10mm Delos… none of which I used with any regularity, and all of which would be useful on these varied planetaries. Why wasn’t I using the 4.8 Nagler on these tiny objects? Why didn’t I use the 10mm Delos on the larger ones like Abell 21, where the 7mm was too much power but where the 158x the Delos offered might be perfect? Part of this was the constant worry of having to clean the prized Delos if it was to get dirty somehow, but that didn’t explain my reluctance to use, say, the 4.8 Nagler, which would be eminently useful in gleaning extra detail from the stellar and barely non-stellar objects I was running across. I made a mental note to do so in the future, as there was no good reason not to.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time searching for Abell planetaries 35 and 36—the former in Hydra, the latter in Virgo. These are huge nebulae, among the biggest in the sky, but devilishly faint and vulnerable to imperfect sky conditions. Neither was able to grant me even the faintest trace of their existence, even using my 24mm Meade SWA eyepiece. Of all of the planetary nebulae on the AL list, these were proving to be beyond the 12.5” scope and my eyes; it wouldn’t be until my sojourns in Cygnus that I would strike out again so thoroughly to find one of these dead star remnants.\n\nJerry had already observed the bright nova in Cassiopeia, which was remarkably still visible, and had moved on to another extragalactic supernova—this one in NGC 5018. Meanwhile, I was aiming my own scope at the previously-noted IC 3322A, which in addition to currently hosting a supernova was also a member of the Flat Galaxies Catalogue.\n\n12:32\n\nIC 3322A; SN2021hiz; NGCs 4365, 4370 (Vir): Having struck out with the last couple of planetaries that I needed (Abells 35 and 36), I’m taking a bit of a detour to get a couple of nice flat galaxies in, starting with a really impressive one that is hosting at the moment a very bright supernova. We’re in the head of Virgo, where everything is of course galaxies; this is IC 3322A. The galaxy is 2.67’ long by about 10” wide, and the supernova is very much at the N tip, possibly 8” from the N end of the galaxy on the inside of the galaxy’s halo. The galaxy is elongated 150˚ PA. It has the classic flat-galaxy brightness profile to it: little in the way of nucleus or central bulge; arms fading out at the ends. There’s mottling evident along the galaxy’s length, which isn’t often enough the case with these flat galaxies. The S end is much less distinct than the N, but it could just be the supernova drawing attention to that side; the supernova is as bright as 12th magnitude. This is definitely one of the more impressive extragalactic supernovae I’ve seen. There’s no nucleus, but 1.67’ F the middle of the galaxy is a 14.5-magnitude star; that star has another of the same brightness due P by 0.75’. NP the galaxy by 5.5’ is a 10th-magnitude star, and then P very slightly S of the galaxy by 4’ is a 13th-magnitude star. 20’ P somewhat N of the galaxy is a much larger, brighter galaxy [NGC 4365]; very bright and unmistakable, with a stellar nucleus and brighter core; the core is 0.3’ diameter but gradually arrived at; the halo is 2.75’ x 1.75’ and is elongated P slightly S-F slightly N. That galaxy is bracketed by a 12th-magnitude star to the N slightly P by 3.3’ and an 11th-magnitude star S somewhat F of the galaxy by 5.75’. The larger galaxy doesn’t come to a crisp halo/core distinction and is not well defined; the edges just fade out into the background. NF that galaxy by 10’ (and therefore NP IC 3322A by 18’) is a smaller, much more diffuse galaxy [NGC 4370], with a very poorly-concentrated core, a diffuse poorly-defined halo and no visible nucleus. This galaxy is elongated P very slightly N-F very slightly S, 1.67’ x 1.0’. [I could probably go on for hours about all the galaxies up here!] In the 7mm, the large galaxy doesn’t show much more detail. The smaller one is a little irregular in brightness across its halo. IC 3322A is just a really nice edge-on galaxy, although the supernova kind of overshadows the rest of it. At this magnification, the galaxy extends N a little bit beyond the SN. A nice flat galaxy for the 12.5-inch scope!\n\nI had previously observed NGCs 4365 and 4370 before, but had made no mention of IC 3322A; I had either not seen it, or had ignored it because it wasn’t part of my agenda that week. This time, I missed IC 3322 to the due N of IC 3322A, which was also in the field, despite panning around looking for other galaxies. So much for being observant!\n\nHaving had a productive observing session, and having had enough of the cold and the wind, we decided to save some energy for the next night (i.e. later that day), which also boasted a clear forecast, albeit with somewhat better seeing… and even more wind. We called it a night, having seen multiple extragalactic supernovae and a few of the larger planetary nebulae that I was already late in getting to.\n\nII. Frank joined Jerry and I later that night at Linslaw. I think we might have bailed on the night—or gone elsewhere—had we anticipated the even stronger winds that awaited us when we got to the crag, although the conditions weren’t enough to deter us from setting up.\n\nI had brought along the 20” Obsession this time, having decided to take a break from planetary nebulae to focus on flat galaxies (and other objects, some just for the hell of it). You might expect the 20” to be more stable in the wind than the 12.5”, but this doesn’t account for the amount of surface facing the wind and the even-greater smoothness of the 20” azimuth bearings. Several times I had to hold onto the scope to avoid it blowing around in circles. Jerry’s binoscope was heavier and less-slick in azimuth; it also didn’t have a wind-catching shroud around it like the Obsession did. Frank’s own binoscope (which he had brought of his myriad scopes) was similarly more solid in the wind, although Frank himself was fairly displeased with the conditions on the crag.\n\n04/12-13/21\n\nLINSLAW POINT\n\nSUNSET: 7:53 PM\n\nMOON: 1 day (set at 8:41 PM; 1% illuminated)\n\nSEEING: 7\n\nTRANSPARENCY: 7\n\nSQM: 21.58\n\nNELM: not checked\n\nWEATHER CONDITIONS: temps to upper 40s; no dew; very windy; wind eventually drove us off mountain\n\nOTHERS PRESENT: JO, FS\n\nAll observations: 20″f/5 Obsession Dob, 14mm ES 82˚ eyepiece (181x, 0.45˚ TFOV) or 7mm TeleVue Nagler (363x, 0.21˚ TFOV) unless otherwise noted\n\n10:16\n\nIC 2531 (Ant): We’re back at Linslaw for Round Two and starting off with an obscure one way down low in Antlia, IC 2531. The seeing is pretty crummy down here—it of course has moments where it’s a little bit better; the scope collimation isn’t great, either, as this is the first session since we cleaned the mirror and disassembled the scope. This galaxy is a huge kind-of-a little-brother to NGC 891 in Andromeda. Certainly in the pictures that’s what we’re looking at here; it’s a long thin streak with a noticeable central hub. (I actually “discovered” this one first on photographs and decided that I had to look at it.) But the dust lane that helps make it a clone of 891 is nowhere near visible… or at least obvious; the seeing down that low is no better than a 4, so it’s not the best of conditions, but this may be the best chance I get at it, given how low it is and how briefly it’s visible from this far north. The galaxy is no less than 5’ long; it’s 0.5’ wide at the hub. It looks as though there’s texture to it that should be visible but is just out of reach, because of the seeing and transparency at this altitude; it kind of hints, especially in averted vision, that there’s more detail that’s just below the threshold of visibility right now. It’s situated in a surprisingly active field for being in Antlia, which is always thought to be pretty desolate (Luginbuhl and Skiff refer to it as “the astral Empty Quarter”). The galaxy is pretty close to due P-F in elongation; might be 85° position angle, maybe even 90°. It’s really hard to get a fix on because of the altitude/declination and the poor seeing. There are several notable groupings of stars around the galaxy, starting just off the P end, 3.5’ P very very slightly S of the Galaxy’s center, at a 13.5-magnitude star with another of the same magnitude P very very slightly S of it by 0.67’. NP the central hub by 2.25’ is a 14th-magnitude star with another of the same magnitude N slightly P it by 0.75’. There’s another 14th magnitude star FsS of the hub of the galaxy by 2’, and there’s also, 3.3’ F very very slightly N of the galaxy’s central hub (so just north of the F end of the galaxy from the central hub) a 14.5-magnitude star. 6.5’ due N of the galaxy by is the middle star of a roughly N-S arc of three stars; that star is 12th ma"
