        "text": "Key Takeaways:\n\nIntroduced in the 17th century by Johannes Hevelius, Sextans sits in the sky’s south, near Hydra, Crater, and Leo.\n\nAmong its features are the Spindle Galaxy and several other galaxies, a distant galaxy cluster, and a notable galaxy called Cosmos Redshift 7.\n\nIt boasts the bright star Alpha Sextantis, the closest star to us, and hosts planets beyond our solar system too.\n\nThe constellation is quite large, easy to spot at certain latitudes, and is a known part of ancient tales, adding to its mystique.\n\nLearn about Sextans’ stories, its role in the night sky, and the special things linked to this part of the stars.\n\nThe Mythological Origins of Sextans Constellation\n\nSextans is different from other constellations. It doesn’t come from any specific myth. Its name comes from a historical link to scientific tools. Johannes Hevelius named it after the sextant, an instrument for measuring stars.\n\nHevelius used it to find star positions. The original name was Sextans Uraniae. But his observatory burned down, and it got the simpler name Sextans.\n\nThis name was accepted by the International Astronomical Union. It’s part of the list of modern constellations today.\n\nIf you’re interested to know more, check these resources:\n\nFind detailed information on constellation Sextans at Wikipedia.\n\nExplore the universe with a guide to the Sextans constellation provided by Universe Guide.\n\nDiscover the celestial wonders of Sextans through the constellation guide on Sea and Sky.\n\nNotable Stars in Sextans Constellation\n\nSextans constellation has stars that draw in astronomers and fans of the night sky. One bright star stands out, known as Alpha Sextantis. It glows with a magnitude of 4.49, making it the most shiny one in Sextans.\n\nOnly 10 parsecs (about 32.6 light years) away, Sextans has five close stars. Bibhā (HD 86081) and Gnomon (WASP-43) are two stars with special names. They make Sextans extra interesting.\n\nSextans boasts five stars that host exoplanets, sparking more interest. Exoplanets circle around these stars, including one hot Jupiter near WASP-43 found in 2011.\n\nNotably, there’s a unique dance in Sextans with two planets around 24 Sextantis. These planets have a special 2:1 orbit rhythm.\n\nEven though Sextans lacks Messier objects, it has other heavenly delights. The Spindle Galaxy (NGC 3115) is bigger than the Milky Way and has a supermassive black hole. William Herschel found it on February 22, 1787.\n\nFor more on Sextans stars, check out the Sextans constellation guide.Wikipedia’s star list for Sextans also has detailed data.\n\nThe constellation Sextans is a beautiful part of our night sky, full of different and exciting stars.\n\nDeep Sky Objects in Sextans Constellation\n\nSextans constellation has many cool deep sky objects. The Spindle Galaxy (NGC 3115) is a favorite. It’s a lenticular galaxy that’s about 31.6 million light years away. It has a unique shape and a clear bulge in the middle. This makes it a great find for anyone looking at the stars.\n\nBesides the Spindle Galaxy, there are others in Sextans. Two spiral galaxies, NGC 3166 and NGC 3169, catch the eye. They’re part of the Leo I Group. NGC 3169 has spiral arms wrapped tightly. NGC 3166 is different, with an off-balance look. Looking at these can teach us about how galaxies change over time.\n\nSextans also has irregular galaxies like Sextans A and B. Sextans A, or LEDA 36252, is small and not shaped like a normal galaxy. Sextans B, known as LEDA 3087792, is shaped by stars still forming. They help us learn how bigger galaxies and smaller ones might work together.\n\nThere’s a big group of galaxies here too – CL J1001+0220. It has many galaxies all pulled close together by gravity. Studying clusters like this one helps us see how the universe’s structure and the life of galaxies change over time.\n\nSextans is also where we found the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy (CR7). It’s about 12.9 billion light years away, making it one of the oldest and farthest galaxies we know. Finding CR7 has told us a lot about how the universe began, including the birth of the first stars and galaxies.\n\nIf you’re curious about Sextans’ deep sky objects, you can look up images. They show just how amazing and complex these celestial wonders in Sextans are.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Spindle Galaxy (NGC 3115) is a lenticular galaxy and one of the most famous objects in Sextans constellation.\n\nOther notable deep sky objects in Sextans include the spiral galaxies NGC 3166 and NGC 3169, the irregular galaxies Sextans A and Sextans B, the galaxy cluster CL J1001+0220, and the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy.\n\nExploring these objects offers fascinating opportunities for observation and study, providing insights into galaxy evolution, large-scale structure, and the early universe.\n\nOnline Sextans constellation images showcase the captivating beauty and complexity of these celestial wonders.\n\nLocating Sextans in the Night Sky\n\nTo see the Sextans, know where to look in the night sky. Look for it in summer from both hemispheres. It is near the celestial equator, so everyone can spot it easily.\n\nFind Sextans near the Hydra, Crater, and Leo stars. Use just your eyes or add binoculars or a telescope. These tools help reveal its beauty since it is quite dim.\n\nThe best time to see Sextans is in summer when it’s high in the sky. Keep an eye out for when it’s at its top. This boosts your chance of enjoying its beauty.\n\nReady for your stargazing trip? Get a star map or an astronomy app. They show where to find the Sextans. Now you’re all set to explore the universe.\n\nSpotting Sextans leads you to an amazing universe journey. Its mystery will amaze you, showing what’s beyond our world.\n\nInternational Star Registry and Naming a Star in Sextans Constellation\n\nWant to celebrate the beauty of Sextans constellation?
