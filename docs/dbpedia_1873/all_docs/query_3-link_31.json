        "text": "About Our Program\n\nNorthern Arizona University (NAU) in Flagstaff, Arizona, has been a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site sponsored by the National Science Foundation since 1991. Undergraduates (typically, upper level) are paid a stipend to work on a research project during the summer months. Our REU pays well and is a great opportunity to, get an idea of what doing research is like, gain knowledge, enhance your skill-sets, research outside of your home institution, meet other like-minded students who are interested in astronomy, planetary science and explore Flagstaff and Arizona. Applications are highly competitive. The research projects available vary from year to year, and have included planetary science, astrogeology, stellar astrophysics, instrumentation work, and extragalactic research. Our program is in person and runs from early June through early August.\n\nAccommodations can usually be made for students on the quarter system who cannot start that early. Students will be enrolled at Northern Arizona University and receive one hour of credit; tuition and fees will be covered by the program. The total stipend is $7000, and each student will be eligible to receive up to $1000 in travel expense reimbursement. Housing is included with the program, and room choices are based on availability at the NAU dorms (i.e. single or shared rooms).\n\nAlthough most of the students’ time will be spent on research, participants are required to attend a seminar series that will meet twice weekly. Some of the seminars will be on observational techniques, but the majority will be talks by Flagstaff astronomers and visitors on their research. We will also visit some of the local scientific facilities. Each student will have an opportunity to observe on local telescopes. Funds are also available for each student to present the results at a scientific meeting during the following year.\n\nAstro REU Locations\n\nNAU Research Experiences for Undergraduate in Astronomy and Planetary Science internship opportunities are offered at several locations across Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nNAU Dept. of Astronomy and Planetary Science\n\nNAU Dept. of Applied Physics and Materials Science\n\nNAU Center for Ecosystem Science and Society\n\nUSGS Astrogeology Science Center\n\nUSGS Southwest Biological Center\n\nLowell Observatory\n\nNaval Observatory Flagstaff Station\n\nStudent Frequently Asked Questions\n\nQ: How are the participants selected?\n\nA: Each mentor chooses their own student. Mentors read as many of the applications as they wish, and submit a ranked list of acceptable students to Dr. Trilling, who then juggles these lists and makes the actual offers to students.\n\nQ: How many students are selected into the program?\n\nA: The NAU REU program anticipates selecting around 10 interns for the Summer 2021 program.\n\nQ: Do I need to be a U.S. citizen to apply?\n\nA: Students must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or its possessions per NSF requirements.\n\nQ: How do I contact the NAU REU program?\n\nA: Send correspondence to reu@nau.edu.\n\nTo check on the status of your application (complete/incomplete), please go to the Login Site and use your email address/password to access your application. Please note, once you have submitted your application, you cannot make any changes to it or upload additional information.\n\nQ: What is the deadline for applications?\n\nA: Please click the previous tab for updated dates/deadlines for our program.\n\nQ: Do you require official transcripts?\n\nA: You can provide an official or unofficial copy of your transcripts that is in digitized format (pdf or text). We prefer that transcripts are uploaded to your application directly, however, if your university is forwarding an official transcript to us, it should be sent to:\n\nDr. David Trilling\n\nNorthern Arizona University\n\nDepartment of Astronomy and Planetary Science\n\nNAU Box 6010\n\nFlagstaff, AZ 86011-6010\n\nQ: Do I need to have previous research experience in order to apply to this program?\n\nA: No previous research experience is required.\n\nQ: What types of computer skills are required?\n\nA: Computer programming skills are important for most internships, however, specific languages and skills are unique to each research project and mentor, and that information is not known in advance of the application process.\n\nQ: When are acceptance notices sent out?\n\nA: We will begin contacting successful applicants in early March but it can take several weeks before the acceptance list is finalized.\n\nIf you have not heard from us during the first two weeks of March, it is likely that you are not on the initial offer list. All applicants will receive an email regarding our decision by the of March to early April.\n\nQ: My school is on the quarter system, and I won’t be finished with my final exams until after your REU program starts. Is it still possible for me to participate?\n\nA: In most cases the answer is yes. We really prefer all the students to start at the same time, but we often make exceptions. The only real problem is housing; the program dates are based on the NAU ten-week summer session, and the dorms close down at the end of that session. Some students have been able to arrange alternate housing and stay in Flagstaff for a longer time. Some students have been able to make up the missing week of work by working on weekends. Generally, these arrangements are made between the student and the mentor.\n\nQ: I am married and wish to bring my spouse along. Is different housing available?\n\nA: Yes, it is easy to bring a spouse. NAU has married student housing, although generally in the summer there are no apartments available. Typically, a regular dormitory will be set aside for couple/family housing. In this case, the program would contribute the cost of “normal” housing towards your housing bill. For more information on housing, see the web page for NAU’s Residence Life."
