        "text": "Here is a list of NGC object observations, including Caldwells. Other observations, from comets, dark nebulae, asteroids, and objects from other catalogs are at the bottom. Also at the bottom of the page are objects I have viewed in scopes other than my own, so they don’t count toward my official observation log. NGC objects are now listed in numerical order.\n\nNGC objects:\n\nNGC40/Caldwell 2: Bowtie Nebula. Not much of a bowtie. More of a rectangle at 141x (17mm/2x) and 300x. Visible central star. Imperfect halo. Barely discernible nebulosity at ~31x. UHC showed minimal improvement, but central star was lost. OIII was worse.\n\nNGC80: Really small galaxy in Andromeda near Pegasus. Difficult to see. Very tiny triangle of stars point at it. Gx visually the same diameter as those stars. Additional power obliterates view. Better seen at low power (26mm).\n\nNGC147: Caldwell 17. Small galaxy near NGC185. Oval smudge. Smaller and slightly dimmer than 185. Same FOV as 185. No core. Averted vision helps.\n\nNGC185: Caldwell 18. From M31 to 3rd star of 3 – 185 is first before NGC147. 147 is in same FOV. NGC185 is round with a noticeable bright core. Faint halo between two brighter stars. 185>147 in terms of visual size. Additional power did not improve view.\n\nNGC188: Caldwell 1. Open cluster in Ursa Minor near Polaris. Seen at HGSP 2013. Difficult cluster to see. Very faint. Brighter stars along outer edge. Faint stars in main part of cluster. Resembled a square or slightly larger rectangle.\n\nNGC205 (Messier 110): Galaxy in Andromeda. Slight core. Angled toward and away from M31. Ill defined edges. Central brightness improves with averted vision. Fans out more toward set of stars above than below.\n\nNGC225: Open cluster in Cassiopeia. Near Navi. W shaped cluster. East side bows out away from other 3rd of the cluster.\n\nNGC246: Caldwell 56. Skull Nebula. Planetary nebula in Cetus. I could elicit some nebulosity, but I could not make out anything that resembled a skull. I could make out three circles inside the nebulosity, though. I suspect the skull-like image is a task only achievable with astrophotography. As part of the Cetus Pair, next to NGC246 sat NGC255, a galaxy. UHC/OIII helps somewhat.\n\nNGC247: Caldwell 62. Spiral galaxy in Cetus. Appeared elongated and narrow. Vertically oriented with a star at one end. Foreground star interferes with view of that edge. Diffuse core.\n\nNGC253: Caldwell 65. The Sculptor Galaxy/Silver Coin Galaxy. Intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Sculptor. Easy to find at low power. Just a round fuzzy with a core about the size of an average globular cluster. Easily visible.\n\nNGC255: Galaxy in Cetus near the Skull Nebula. Small. Just a faint round fuzzy.\n\nNGC288: Globular cluster. Sculptor. Near 253. Large/med size glob with core and resolving stars. Almost as big as 253’s core and about 1/4 as wide.\n\nNGC381: Open cluster in Cassiopeia. Faint at low power. Pentagon shape with brighter stars on left. Top is an easy seen triangle. Bottom left (South) has concentration of fuzziness around three stars.\n\nNGC404: Mirach’s Ghost. Just outside glow of Mirach. 1/2 way between two faint stars. Small round fuzz with slight core. 8mm without Mirach in field – Averted vision shows dot. Possible core or foreground star. West/WNW side or center.\n\nNGC436: Open cluster. Cassiopeia. Small cluster in C shape with diagonal line of three stars on left side. Top of C has a close line of three stars which have a glow, but no other stars around them resolve, except for a triangle. Near ET/Owl Cluster (457).\n\nNGC457: Caldwell 13. The Owl Cluster – Stick figure cluster just outside of Cassiopeia. Several white stars. Some orange. Some blue. One prominent orange star at chest-level. Eyes are white. Feet are yellow-orange.\n\nNGC520 (Pisces Pair): Actually not one, but two galaxies. These two are located in Pisces and are in close proximity to one another, so close in fact, that visually, they appear to overlap, forming a V. They were small, but visible. They reminded me a lot of some of the galaxies in Virgo. Aside from that, they were not very impressive.\n\nNGC559: Caldwell 8. Open cluster. Cassiopeia. Square of five stars in averted vision. Clockwise around bright to dim pair at far right. Not much at low power. Small fuzz with bright center. 17mm: Not much different. Top half has more fuzz. 7-10 stars below cluster resolve. 8mm: Not improved. Fuzzy still there. Loss of focus (Condition dependent – seeing).\n\nNGC598: Messier 33. Binocular view. Faint fuzz inside a triangle of stars. Edges not defined. Core is to right and above leftmost star in triangle. Seems to have a diagonal vs round appearance. Under good conditions at home, three spiral arms have been observed at low power in XT8.\n\nNGC637: Open cluster. Cassiopeia. Y shaped cluster. Small. Central cluster has 7-8 stars in an arrow configuration. Slight haze around that cluster of central stars.\n\nNGC651: Messier 76. Little Dumbbell. Bilobed haze top to bottom with gap between which comes and goes in intensity, but always there. Top is dimmer than bottom, but equal in size. OIII dimmer than UHC, but both better than without filter.\n\nNGC654: Open cluster in Cassiopeia. Cluster with one bright foreground star and right sided concentration that is difficult to resolve. Haze extends over right side and around to rightmost stars like a hook.\n\nNGC659: Open cluster. Cassiopeia. Pentagon shaped cluster of 8-9 stars. Right side has small line of three stars which appear as two until averted vision used. Two bright stars are on left side of cluster (East). Bright star at bottom of field is 44 Cassiopeia.\n\nNGC663: Cluster near Cassiopeia & M103. Large. Two bright stars are orange. Concentration of white stars. Faint in center of this concentration. Near NGC654. Between Ruchbah and Segin.\n\nNGC720: Galaxy. Cetus. Very faint. Hardly any core. Oval shape. Edges are diffuse. Angled N-S.\n\nNGC752: Caldwell 28. Open cluster in Andromeda, located between the star Almach and the Triangulum. Faintly visible cluster in my 8x finder. Observed at 78 degrees off the horizon. Seeing and transparency both good. Two bright stars located on one side with a reddish orange hue. Vertical line of stars on another side. About 20 stars in the middle are spread out evenly. Right side of the cluster is more sparse. Viewed at 31x.\n\nNGC772: Spiral galaxy in Aries. Faint round fuzzy. Bright core. Ill defined edges.\n\nNGC884 and NGC869: Double cluster in Perseus next to Stock 2. Visible to the naked eye under dark skies at the HGSP. 869 is the more tightly packed cluster with more white stars than 884. 884 is the cluster with more orange stars and sparse arrangement. Smiling Cyclops is in 869.\n\nNGC891: This galaxy is in Andromeda just below Almach and, aside from being a fairly decent size, it has a unique dark lane right down the middle. I could not see this dark patch in my 8″ scope, but I could see it just fine in a 20″, a 16″, and the big 25″. NGC891 is long and spindle shaped, but the conditions were such that I could not see the galaxy on my first pass. I found it using my 38mm SWA 2″ eyepiece on the second run through the area. I tried using my Zhumell Skyglow filter to increase the contrast and bring out the center dark lane, but that did not work. I have been unable to find this galaxy at home, only Okie Tex.\n\nNGC1023: Galaxy. Perseus. Just north of 16 Perseus. Thin with white core at low power in 26mm. Needle-like. Short across field. Edges somewhat easy to see. Tough at low power. Line of stars point toward it from East side. 150x resolves core well and extends the visibility of the galaxy’s edges somewhat.\n\nNGC1318A & B.Part of Stephan’s Quintet. (See Other Objects section below.)\n\nNGC1499: California Nebula. Viewed in a 4.5″ reflector at HGSP 2013 with HBeta filter at 14x and 17x. Most of the nebula visible. Thicker nebulosity toward end near Menkib until it widened out. Center can appear hollow.\n\nNGC1514: PN in Taurus. Teeny tiny planetary. Resembles star. No halo. Difficult to focus. Did not attempt with filters. 150x – Still star-like. Must revisit with filters.\n\n(NGC1528: Open cluster – Found after meandering around Perseus. Find Mirphak. Then find the faint group of stars that resembles a 5 side of a die. After that, 1528 is easy, but another NGC cluster should also be nearby, so I might have confused the two. Must revisit.)\n\nNGC1788: Nebula in Orion. Very faint haze around star in W shaped cluster. Nebulosity on mostly eastern side of a star in W. Goes in and out with averted vision. Possible dark patch next to star on East side. UHC and OIII not helpful. No filter>UHC>OIII>HBeta\n\nNGC1907: Open cluster – Low magnitude cluster visible inside Auriga near M38. Compact. Fuzzy. Stands out as something extra vs background, but stars are difficult to discern.\n\nNGC1931: Small open cluster in Auriga.\n\nNGC1973/5/7: Nebula above M42. Barely visible in home skies, but easily visible at the HGSP (Bortle 5-6). Faintly visible under new moon skies at home. Also observed 1975 at Okie Tex 2012. NGC1975 was visible behind M42/M43, but the bright star affected just how much of the nebulosity I could see.\n\nNGC1980: Nebula/Open cluster in Orion. (Note: 44 Orionis double). Brightest star is pair with faint companion (PA 100 deg). Two other pairs at SW end. Southernmost is brighter, but equally bright pair. Dimmer pair is at W edge. Sparse. Bright star lets off a glow. No nebulosity seen. Just a cluster.\n\nNGC1999: Dim glow around faint star (V380). Averted vision shows a gap to the left with another faint patch next to that. Averted vision helps. UHC/OIII offers no help. Skyglow filter may help slightly by adding contrast. Viewed at 150x. Should benefit from high power, large aperture attempts.\n\nNGC2022: Planetary nebula. Orion. Round, small, uniform fuzzball without a central star. Averted vision only improves periphery. Attempted OIII in 8mm because 4.8mm Ortho made view too difficult. OIII only brightened the view slightly. Visible in 25mm as faint fuzzy spot near star HD37786.\n\nNGC2024: Flame Nebula – Around Alnitak, the Flame Nebula could barely be seen. IC434 was visible, extending out to the side, but I didn’t look for the Horsehead. The nebulosity stretched far out away from Alnitak. I probably could have seen the Horsehead if I tried. UHC helped.\n\nNGC2071: Small nebula in Orion above Alnitak and M78. Faint and small gray spot.\n\nNGC2129: Open cluster in Gemini. Near 1 Gem and M35/2158. Two main white stars form the side of a four sided arrangement of faint stars near other main parts of cluster, but center is a black void.\n\nNGC2158: Open cluster in M35. Easily seen at the HGSP. Faint object which resembles a nebula or a globular object because it is so far away at 11,000 ly, yet it is really an open cluster. Can be difficult to resolve any stars inside this cluster. Hazy circle beneath one bright star at outer edge of M35. Four faint stars resolve with averted vision at 150x (horizontal line across bottom of haze).\n\nNGC2169: The 37 Cluster – Cluster located in Orion below Xi Orionis and Nu Orionis. Easily visible. Looks like the number 37. 17mm eyepiece (~70x) was a comfortable view. 2x barlow (~140x) left the unmistakable 37 dominating the field. I visualized ten stars in the 3 and six stars in the 7. A bright closely arranged double was just adjacent to the corner star in the 3. I was inclined to think that double might have been Struve 848.\n\nNGC2186: Open cluster in Orion. Faint small cluster at 150x with two bright stars and a double in between as part of the main cluster mixed with a wide Y shaped haze. 4.8mm Ortho accentuates haze only slightly at 250x.\n\nNGC2194: Open cluster in Orion. X shaped faint clyster with nine obvious stars and the rest of the cluster is a haze. Tail off to West seen as hazy and part of the Y. Main cluster haze almost appears as oval. Most of the haze is along the western edge of the main cluster.\n\nNGC2244 and NGC2237: The Rosette Nebula was on our Okie Tex twofer list. I could see a faint nebulosity separating it from the background on the edges when viewing at very low power with either a UHC or OIII filter (mostly helped with UHC). NGC2244 and NGC2237 are the cluster and the emission nebula. In a wide field 4.5″ reflector at HGSP 2013, the entire Rosette was visible as a nebulous gray circle with nebulosity decreasing in intensity from the inside, out. In my 8″, only one portion was visible along the rectangle of ten central stars. Low power only shows 7-8 stars. Possibly visible to the naked eye at HGSP 2013. OIII filter was required with eyepiece. HBeta showed some nebulosity as well.\n\nNGC2261: Hubble’s Variable Nebula. Small nebula adjacent to the Christmas Tree Nebula. Resembled a comet at low power. Non-distinct spot of nebulosity at 70-150x.\n\nNGC2264: Christmas Tree Cluster – Group of stars that appear arranged like a tree. Located below the foot of Gemini. HBeta under dark skies revealed nebulosity around many of the stars in the cluster. No Cone Nebula has been seen as of yet. Bright star at base might be a double with a faint companion.\n\nNGC2359: Duck Nebula/Thor’s Helmet. Found at 46x with UHC filter. OIII filter brings out more nebulosity. Wings not visible with UHC. Wings visible with OIII. Bulk of nebula angled toward two stars.\n\nNGC2360: Caldwell 58. Open cluster in Canis Major. Down and to the left of Sirius. Low in the sky. Starhopped from Sirius to Iota and then to Muliphein. From there, I hopped to some doubles and found the cluster. Faint. Small. Viewed at 31x first. Viewed about 20 stars in the center, one bright star at the bottom, two bright stars at the top. The cluster is narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. At 70x, it fills about 1/4 of the field. One leg of the cluster extends out to the left. Probably 50 or more stars in the bottom half.\n\nNGC2362: Caldwell 64. Small open cluster in Puppis. Difficult to distinguish from background. One bright star and faint stars nearby. No color. No shapes. Viewed at 31x and 70x. All white stars.\n\nNGC2392: Eskimo Nebula – Planetary nebula adjacent to Gemini on the Pollux side of the constellation.Bright central star. Pronounced halo. Visible central star. OIII can improve the view in good conditions. I wrote a post on finding the Eskimo Nebula using nearby landmarks off of Gemini.\n\nNGC2403, a mag 8.4 spiral galaxy in Camelopardalis discovered by Herschel was only at 12 degrees, but I could still see it, despite the muck. There were two bright spots inside the fuzz. I wasn’t sure if they were merely overlapping stars or if they were contained within the galaxy itself.\n\nNGC2419: Intergalactic Wanderer – Globular cluster that was comparable to M71 in terms of intensity. Could not resolve many stars, but a few popped out. This one was on my hit list for a long time. Finally found it at Okie Tex. Decent size. I need to now find this one at home to compare views.\n\nNGC2438: Planetary nebula in the open cluster M46. Although I’ve seen M46, I didn’t stop and take the time to look around. The nebula is there, easily visible, even in my home sky, but thanks to a friendly nudge from someone at a star party, I found this one. It has a nice halo and a central bright star. A UHC filter brings out the halo, but dims the central star.\n\nNGC2467: Nebula/open cluster associated with nebulosity in Puppis. Near M93. At 37.5x, it had some fuzzy qualities. UHC filter brought out more nebulosity. Round faint fuzzy at 70x. Also viewed at 150x. Note: Should revisit with HBeta.\n\nNGC3632: Caldwell 40. Spiral galaxy in Leo. Small. Faint. At low power, it looked like a planetary nebula. 8mm didn’t help. Lost with magnification.\n\nNGC2477: Caldwell 71. Open cluster in Puppis. Sparse open cluster outlined by 10-12 bright stars with a Y shaped concentration of stars, or perhaps a seagull distribution. Arched from the top, left to the middle, thickened, and then curved back to the left and down. Big E or a cross in the cluster. Filled the field in my 17mm. Way too many stars to count inside of this cluster.\n\nNGC2506: Caldwell 54. Open cluster in Monoceros. Faint fuzzy cluster at 70x. Resembled an H or a square. Extended out to the right like it had a tail. Possible nebulosity associated with central stars. Two bright stars at top left. Bright triangle on right. Rectangle at bottom.\n\nNGC2775: Caldwell 48. Small unimpressive galaxy. Faint core, visible with persistence. Easy to lose in the FOV.\n\nNGC2841: Galaxy in Ursa Major – Very small faint galaxy located just to the right and below the two stars Talitha and Talitha Australis.\n\nNGC3034: Messier 82. Elongated vertical galaxy in FOV with broad core and needle ends. Slight spiral arm detail at top. SN2014J observed at West end oriented by nearby star at South.\n\nNGC3115: Caldwell 53. Spindle Galaxy in Sextans. Elliptical galaxy. At low power in a 32mm, it was very small, elongated, and narrow with a pinpoint core. Bright compared to the stars around it. Averted vision showed brighter fuzziness extending out away from the core, hence its name.\n\nNGC3132: Caldwell 74. Eight-Burst Nebula. Planetary nebula in Vela. Clean cut planetary with a central star and small halo, very similar to the Eskimo, albeit larger in size.\n\nNGC3201: Caldwell 79. Glob in Vela. Similar to Messier 71. Faint at low power. Difficult to resolve stars. Outermost stars resolved at 109x. Asymmetrical. R>L.\n\nNGC3242: Ghost of Jupiter – Planetary nebula in the constellation Hydra. In home skies, the nebula appeared bright and was easily found, but lacked any sort of real detail. Must revisit under better viewing conditions. Attempted views with UHC and OIII filters with only minor enhancement seen. Bright, but round and blurry.\n\nNGC3384: Elliptical galaxy in Leo near M105. Easily seen, but lacked definition. Just a faint fuzzy galaxy with no obvious central brightness.\n\nNGC3626: Caldwell 40. Galaxy in Leo. At 48x, small and faint. Resembled PN at low power. 8mm worsens view (condition dependent?). No core. slight fuzz.\n\nNGC3628: Third galaxy as part of the Leo Trio. Easier to see with averted gaze and/or Skyglow filter and dark adapted eyes. Barely visible under moonlit skies when viewing from under the helpful shadow of a cedar tree, implying that a dew shield might help you see this object. Use the star HIP 55262 to help locate this galaxy adjacent to M65 and M66. Very bright under Bortle 6 skies without a filter, almost as bright as neighboring M65 and M66. Slightly longer under darker skies as well.\n\nNGC3953: A barred spiral galaxy near M109 off of Phad in Ursa Major, located up and out away from the star. In my home sky, this galaxy is also easy to find.\n\nNGC4038/NGC4039: Caldwell 60 & 61. Antenna Galaxies. One was larger than the other. Nothing more than two close fuzzy spots which formed a V. No tails. Visible, yet vague cores.\n\nNGC4102: Spiral galaxy near M109 off of Phad in Ursa Major. A brief sketch I made at the HGSP showed a central star, an elongated fuzzy ring, and a bright dot at the top.\n\nNGC4236: Caldwell 3. Irregular galaxy in Draco. Large and faint. Averted vision needed. Above an arc of five stars. Fuzzy part of galaxy was a decent size, spanning almost from one end of the arc of stars to the other, diagonally.\n\nNGC4244: Caldwell 26. Silver Needle Galaxy. Elongated and needle-like. Reminded me of NGC891 in Andromeda. Not much of a core. Tips dissolved into the background. Viewed at 37.5x and 70x.\n\nNGC4438 & 4435: Eyes galaxies in Virgo. Part of the Markarian Chain. Not visualized as individual galaxies, but appeared more like one elongated fuzzy object.\n\nNGC4449: Caldwell 21. Irregular galaxy in Canes Venatici. Small galaxy. Bright core. Elongated. Not much fuzz.\n\nNGC4473 & 4477: Two separate galaxies in Virgo as part of the Markarian Chain. Easily visible, but if viewing the chain, count the galaxies you can see in order to correctly ID all of them.\n\nNGC4485: Galaxy in Canes Venatici adjacent to NGC4490. Angled in the opposite direction away from the star Chara. Forms a V with NGC4490. Core and slight fuzz visible.\n\nNGC4490: Cocoon Galaxy: Not a very distinct galaxy. Odd edges at low power. Sits in the constellation Canes Venatici. Visually about the same size as the Black Eye Galaxy. Angled toward the star Chara. Forms a V with NGC4485. Nice bright core. Simple gray smudge. Thin sliver of galaxy fuzz. Comfortably viewed at 37x.\n\nNGC4559: Caldwell 36. Spiral galaxy in Coma Berenices. At low power, it really did not resemble a regular galaxy. Irregularity to it on the right side. Very difficult to discern edges. Two stars on the bottom of the field that bordered the outer edges of the galaxy. Averted vision improved visualization of the core, but not by much. Although small, it was much wider in the center and longer from end to end than many other unimpressive small galaxies\n\nNGC4565: Caldwell 38. Needle Galaxy. Very, very, very thin galaxy. The core almost bulged out away from the galaxy it was so thin. Averted vision helped to better visualize either end, but the core was the more interesting area to stay focused on.\n\nNGC4594: Messier 104. Sombrero. Very small horizontal galaxy with white appearance and slight darkening along bottom. Difficult to resolve under average seeing. Core visible, but largely uniform across end to end. Power necessary. 70x not enough.\n\nNGC4631: Caldwell 32. Whale Galaxy. Galaxy in Coma Berenices. Very needle-like. broad white center with faint edges. Not a very concise core.\n\nNGC4697: Caldwell 52. Galaxy in Virgo. At 150x, it was more oval in shape. Visible core. Outer edges were visible with direct vision.\n\nNGC4874: Galaxy in Coma Berenices. Adjacent to NGC4889. Small. Faint. Dark skies were absolutely required to see this galaxy. Formed an L with 4889 and two stars. No core. Same size as 4889. Seen at 37.5x.\n\nNGC4889: Caldwell 35. Galaxy in Coma Berenices. Together with two stars, it formed an L along with NGC4874, another galaxy. In the eyepiece, it was to the right of the two stars. Faint and small. No core. Seen at low power (37.5x).\n\nNGC5005: Caldwell 29. Spiral galaxy in Canes Venatici. Just another one of those small, unimpressive galaxies. Appeared to be spindle shaped with a very simple core and faint edges which did not extend out very far.\n\nNGC5128: Caldwell 77. Centaurus A/Hamburger Galaxy – Galaxy in Centaurus above Omega Centauri. Once this galaxy rises above the horizon high enough, a dark line down its mid-section can be seen. I observed this object at the HGSP 2012 and had to wait late into the night to see the black line down the middle. Very neat galaxy. At HGSP 2013, the dark lane was visible at 70x and the fuzzy sides were prominent. At 150x, the dark lane down the middle came out more, but the sides were lost.\n\nNGC 5139: Omega Centauri – Huge globular cluster in the constellation Centaurus. Visible to the naked eye. Seen at the HGSP at about 10°-12° in the southern sky in the lower right portion of the constellation. At home, 5139 is low on the horizon and affected by skyglow from Shreveport, although still visible in the telescope as a large smudge, but also faintly visible in my 8×40 finder scope.\n\nNGC5195: companion galaxy of M51. Fuzzy halo and discernible core, but beyond that, it’s difficult to view. Taken to 150x and 300x. Ideal for great sky conditions.\n\nNGC5248: Caldwell 45. Spiral galaxy in Boötes. At low power, it had a round appearance. Still quite small. I couldn’t visualize its core, but the surrounding fuzziness was a dim smudge and its edges were ill-defined. I noticed a widely spaced pair of stars at 10 o’clock, another pair at 4:30, a star at 3, one at 3:30, and a few others.\n\nNGC5694: Caldwell 66. Glob in Hydra. 0.8arcmin in size. Below a tight double and to the left. Difficult at 37.5x. Obvious at 150x. Iffy visualization of core. Fuzzy halo. No discernible stars.\n\nNGC5820: Galaxy in Bootes. Difficult to find due to wind. 17mm: Gx mixed in with stars. Small oblique galaxy with at least two foreground stars, one bright, one faint. Bright was located toward the top half.\n\nNGC5907: Diagonal thin smudge. Barely visible in 35mm. 5907 is to the NE side of an arc near Iota Draconis and a vertical pair. Thin. About 1/5th of field at 70x end to end. White fuzz improves with averted vision and scope nudging. Core resolves with same techniques. Dark adaptation is required!\n\nNGC6124: Caldwell 75. Open cluster in Scorpius. Sparse cluster with faint concentration of stars in center inside a square pattern. Arc of ten prominent stars along bottom edge.\n\nNGC6144: Small glob just above Antares and near M4. Faint. Resembled M71, only smaller. One small bright star at superior edge.\n\nNGC6207: Tiny galaxy below M13 in Hercules. Barely visible in dark skies. Didn’t even know it was there until someone showed it to me at HGSP. It sits down and to the left of the glob above two brighter stars. Needle-like. No core. Small. Can be seen in wide field view with M13.\n\nNGC6210: PN in Hercules. Really small at low power (26mm) and bluish in color. Forms triangle with two other stars. Not easily resolved at 150x, but maintains color and illustrates blinking effect when staring at visible central star. (10/1/2013)\n\nNGC6229: Globular cluster in Hercules. Tiny glob. Core is all I can see. No resolving stars at low power. Fuzzy star appearance. Confirmed at 70x without improvement.\n\nNGC6284: Small globular cluster located to the left of M19 in Ophiuchus, another globular cluster.\n\nNGC6287: a pretty decent sized globular cluster at the bottom of a dark nebula, Barnard 51.\n\nStars resolved well without much effort.\n\nNGC6293, a 1.8 arcmin globular cluster in Ophiuchus located just adjacent to M19, another glob. I boosted the power with an 8mm eyepiece for the sake of being thorough. I could see a very bright central core, but only the stars on the outer edge would resolve well. It was a really really small glob. Faint, too. Resembled a small planetary. Difficult catch.\n\nNGC6304: I ended up finding NGC6304 as I searched for 6316. Same sort of glob. Small. Not fun.\n\nNGC6302: Caldwell 69. Bug Nebula. Planetary nebula in Scorpius. Fuzzy “star.” Boosted to 150x. Side to side haze with central star. Bow tie with nebulosity. Difficult to discern edges.\n\nNGC6316: Small 1.3 arcmin globular cluster in Ophiuchus. Core visible.\n\nNGC6366. Tiny glob in Ophiuchus. Faint. Stars would not resolve.\n\nNGC6453: Globular cluster near M7. Nothing but a faint fuzzy in my view, as if it were a galaxy instead of a cluster.\n\nNGC6416: The Butterfly Cluster was actually visible to the naked eye, so it didn’t take very long to find this one. 6416 is an open cluster above the Butterfly in Scorpius. Nothing special about 6416, as far as I could tell.\n\nNGC6520: Open cluster in Sagittarius – Found by accident one night at a star party just after I looked at Lagoon/Trifid. The cluster, in great skies, appears bright, as if it is a nebula, but it is just a very tightly packed cluster of stars. Next to it is a slightly less obvious dark nebula, Barnard 86.\n\nNGC6522 & NGC6528: Pair of globs just off of Alnasi, a star in Sagittarius. 6528 is closer to Alnasi. Difficult to see. Very small. All core. Little, if any haze.\n\nNGC6541: Caldwell 78. Globular cluster in Corona Australis. 13° off horizon. Faint fuzzy. Visible core at low power (38mm). At 150x, just a bright center with no noticeable surrounding stars.\n\nNGC6543: Cat’s Eye Nebula – Planetary nebula in Draco. After a lot of searching, I finally located this planetary nebula. The images online are amazing, but through my XT8 and other even more powerful telescopes, it is nothing more than a very bright object that is slightly larger than stars around it. A noticeable taper can be seen on either side like an out line of an eye. The inner portion of the nebula is very bright, but the very center is a brighter circle, filling out the perception that it resembles an eye. No outer ring is visible, making this planetary nebula look different from others I’ve seen so far.\n\nNGC6544: Tiny globular cluster in Sagittarius, adjacent to M8, the Lagoon Nebula. Easily seen at low power against the background. Really small. Faint. The core was still bright at low power. Did not attempt to resolve stars at higher power. Near 6553.\n\nNGC6553: Small glob, second one to the left of the Lagoon Nebula. Unimpressive, but easily spotted near NGC6554. Similar globs.\n\nNGC6603: Open cluster within the larger open cluster, M24, in Sagittarius. The Milky Way serves as the background for both clusters. Observed under dark skies at the HGSP.\n\nNGC6624: Tiny globular cluster below Kaus Media in Sagittarius between M69 and M70. Unimpressive glob, but the core was very bright.\n\nNGC6638: Small glob adjacent to Kaus Borealis in Sagittarius. Difficult to resolve. Questionable core.\n\nNGC6712: Glob in Scutum near M26 and the Wild Duck Cluster. Fairly concise glob, right in line with the Milky Way. Decent size at low power. In 8mm, becomes fuzzy, patchy, and stars do not easily resolve. Ill defined halo borders. Nebulous at 150x. A few bright stars resolve in center with averted vision going horizontally across glob.\n\nNGC6726: Bright nebula seen below Sagittarius in the constellation Corona Australis. Easily seen without a filter. Didn’t try using a filter. I used high power to confirm it was not a globular cluster, although it did resemble one at low power. Size-wise, it was about as big as M27, the Dumbbell. I need to revisit this area to verify everything and look for other nearby objects, as illustrated in this image.\n\nNGC6751: Small PN in Aquila. Low power is star like with faint halo and maybe a little blue color. Halo goes in and out with direct vision.\n\nNGC6755: Open cluster in Aquila. Sparse dim cluster. A lot of low magnitude stars. Edges of cluster not defined against background. Brighter stars at SW end of FOV. Viewed at 48x.\n\nNGC6756: Open cluster in Aquila near 6755. Dim spot at low power. Resolves to brighter vertical smudge at 70-150x. Three stars come out with averted vision alone. Smudge and one dim star below and left (N). Possible bright star with averted vision in lower half of smudge. Additional power kills view.\n\nNGC6760: Glob in Aquila. Really faint. Core barely visible. The peculiar thing about this observation was how the glob was surrounded by a dark area. It made me wonder if a dark nebula happened to be either behind or in front of this object. What made it even more strange was how the glob sat right in the center of that dark circle. I entertained three explanations, the first being that a dark nebula was in that spot. The second, and more likely reason, was that the stars in that area were beyond the resolving power of my scope, so I saw nothing where very faint stars were. The third was that a dwarf galaxy surrounds the glob, much like the Sagittarius Dwarf. Astrophotography supports explanation #2.\n\nNGC6781: Planetary nebula in Aquila, about the same size as the Owl Nebula. Faint. Not distinct. Central star was visible under darker skies, but not at home. Round haze. UHC or OIII needed in home skies. Not there without filter. Not uniform. Dimmer core. Brighter at periphery, especially along NW edge as an arch. Southern edge blown out and faint which can be seen in astrophotography images. OIII>UHC, but not by much.\n\nNGC6818: Little Gem Nebula. Planetary nebula in Sagittarius. Obvious planetary at low power. Bright at 150x. Similar to M57. Central darkness. No discernible central star. Difficult to focus. Cottony appearance. No color.\n\n(NGC6823: Open cluster in Vulpecula. Near 6830. Line of brighter stars vertically arranged next to the outer edge. Cluster itself has 3 bright stars in a line on the left and 3 faint stars in a triangle on the right with slight fuzz/nebulosity. Bright star at top. Beyond that, boundary is difficult to discern. Small cluster in a rich star field.) Must revisit to confirm I did not simply observe the wider star field around the cluster itself.\n\nNGC6826: Blinking Planetary Nebula – Located in Cygnus with a pair of very bright stars nearby. Found with 17mm eyepiece. Similar to Eskimo and Blue Snowball. I could easily see the central star at high power (8mm), so I stared and stared for a few moments and then noticed the sides dim (a blink). The structure of the halo around the central star was a little more discernible at high power.\n\nNGC6879: Mag 11 PN in Sagitta. Difficult at low power. Haze noticeable at 70x 17mm. 8mm: Haze more apparent, especially with averted vision. Partnered with neighboring star visually. At 17mm, looks like two stars, one with fuzz. Halo overlaps neighboring star. Difficult to discern edges.\n\nNGC6882: Open cluster in Vulpecula. Three visible stars with the brightest of the three in the middle. It apparently is visually inseparable from C37, having fifty mag 9-13 stars in it. I could not see any of that.\n\nNGC6885: Caldwell 37. Open cluster in Vulpecula. Obvious at low power in 32mm. Located next to NGC6882, another open cluster. Clear gap between the two. Resembled a broad X without a center star. Brightest of six was on right (20 Vulpecula). Concentration of stars in middle of W. Wings of W were mainly faint stars. Five to six stars at top portion. Five bright stars form the bottom halves of the W. Two on left. Three on right.\n\nNGC6891: Mag 10.5 PN in Delphinus. Not difficult to find. Showed up as bluish star at low power. At 150x, resembled distant PN with halo and central brightness. Not sure if that was its central star.\n\nNGC6905: Blue Flash nebula – Planetary nebula in Vulpecula. Larger than expected. Easily found at low power. Tapered fuzzy halo surrounded by a few bright stars. One side was more prominent than the other. No discernible central star. An Urban Skyglow filter helped darken the background and both a UHC/OIII filter made things more apparent.\n\nNGC6907: Faint galaxy in Capricorn. Difficult to see. Halfway between two stars. Small smudge. Barely there in 26mm. 17mm obliterates view and requires averted vision to see. Fuzzy glow. Diagonally oriented pointing 11 o clock to 5 o clock. SW to NE. No core. Halfway between a triangle of stars and a double.\n\nNGC6934: Caldwell 47. Globular cluster in Delphinus. Right next to a fairly bright star. Smaller than C78. In 46x, noticeable bright core, but just fuzzy at 150x.\n\nNGC6939: Open cluster in Cepheus. Not impressive. Sparse. Small. Near Fireworks Galaxy. Brighter 5 stars with concentration of stars inside a fuzzy collection. One batch trails to a corner star and the rest are along the bottom half of the cluster (SSW). Fireworks Gx in same FOV.\n\nNGC6946: A galaxy in Cygnus. Mag 8.9. It is also called the Fireworks Galaxy. To me, it only looked like a fuzzy ball. I noticed an open cluster adjacent to it (NGC6939).\n\nNGC6960: Western Veil Nebula – Viewed using an OIII filter and a UHC filter (OIII>;UHC). Top edge easily visible coming away from the star 52 Cyg. The nebulosity had a very wispy tail-like appearance. I was able to follow the nebula down to its southern tip. Under darker skies, it was visible without a filter and the bottom portion below the main star was even more visible with a filter.\n\nNGC6974: Bright nebula in Cygnus – In between the Western and Eastern Veil nebulae, this nebula is quite large in star maps, but using an OIII filter, I was only able to see the top part as a faint smudge.\n\nNGC6995: Eastern Veil Nebula – Easily seen with an OIII filter, but also viewed with a UHC filter (OIII>;UHC). Viewed at low power. Same wispy nebulosity as the Western Veil. Barely fits in my 32mm EP, but easily fits in my 38mm SWA 70. Under darker skies, it was visible without a filter, but lacked the fuzzy nebulosity a filter shows.\n\nNGC7000: Caldwell 20. North America Nebula in Cygnus. Visualized in a 4.5″ reflector and an HBeta filter. Nebulosity easier to see in the Mexico region. Arches around into the US section and decreases in brightness. No additional detail to the nebula. Just fuzz in a wide field. Increased nebulosity along middle line of five stars as C shaped arc, two of which are a close double. Fades to the NNE across the field.\n\nNGC7006: Caldwell 42. Globular cluster in Delphinus. Faint and sparse. Resembles a planetary nebula. No discernible core. No stars resolved.\n\nNGC7008: Fetus Nebula. Planetary nebula in Cygnus. Navigated from Mu Cephei. Without a filter, there was a faint glow around one or two stars stars in an arc. With the OIII filter, a kidney bean shape was more noticeable at 92x, but at 150x, it was still visible. In poor conditions, 150x and an OIII filter wipes out the view.\n\nNGC7009: Saturn Nebula – Planetary nebula in Aquarius. Easily visible at low power (32x). Lines sticking out at either side resemble rings like Saturn. Round ends seen in online photos were not visible. No central bright core was observed. Object is very near M72 and M73. Easily distinguishable object among other stars as it appears slightly larger than a star.\n\nNGC7023: Iris Nebula. In my home skies, I could only ever see the bright star, but very little nebulosity, if at all. The reason why I landed on it was because I stumbled across some dark patches (dark nebulae). In my 38mm without a filter, I could discern a little more nebulosity around that bright star and perhaps a line coming off to its right. I could see dark patches on all sides, but predominately extending off to the right. A UHC filter didn’t help.\n\nNGC7026: Planetary nebula in Cygnus. Faint fuzzy halo at low power next to an orange star and below an arc of stars, not separated from a neighboring star. At higher power, it was a distinct fuzzy from that star. At 300x, it had a black notch at the top and two white specs on either side of the halo.\n\nNGC7027: Planetary nebula in Cygnus. At low power in the 4.5″, it was a flickering blue star with a slight halo. At 300x, it was a white planetary with a diagonal line across from left to right and a vertical line across the middle.\n\nNGC7177: Galaxy in Pegasus. Spotted in 26mm as fuzzy area. Really small. 17mm showed same small galaxy. No core. No direction apparent. Reminds me of M77. Round and diffuse faint galaxy, albeit much smaller.\n\nNGC7243: Caldwell 16. Open cluster in Lacerta. Two patches of stars separated by a gap. Smaller patch was pentagon shaped and contained six or seven prominent stars. The other patch had 10-12 prominent stars with many faint stars scattered in between them. When viewed together, it resembled a snail. Viewed at 37.5x.\n\nNGC7293: Helix Nebula – Appeared like a big version of the Ring nebula. Tails were noticeable on bottom end more than the top. A central area of darkness was somewhat apparent. Adjacent to a bright star, likely Upsilon Aquarii. Detail improved 20 degrees above horizon.\n\nNGC7319, NGC7320: Part of Stephan’s Quintet. (See Other Objects section below.)\n\nNGC7331: Spiral galaxy in Pegasus, located between Pegasus and Lacerta. I was actually hunting for Stephan’s Quintet. 7331 was just an incidental smudge.\n\nNGC7479: Galaxy in Pegasus. Near Markab. Two stars point to the galaxy. Visible at 38mm. Looks like a splinter/sliver. Small. Up and down arrangement. Core is bright. Essentially a needle with a halo.\n\nNGC7662: Blue Snowball Nebula – Planetary nebula in Andromeda, no bigger than a star, but only a short hop from Iota Andromedae. At low power, it looks blue. At high power, it does not. Viewed at low power (32mm) and then 13mm, followed by a 2x barlow to give about a 185x magnification. At that power, the nebulosity was easily seen, but no central star was visible. One side looked darker than the other. Averted vision made no difference at all. Added an Urban Sky filter to make the high power view a little easier on my eyes.\n\nNGC7789: Caroline’s Rose. Open cluster in Cass. I didn’t quite understand the name until I realized it wasn’t a rose with a stem, but rather a flowering rose. I still couldn’t see it as a rose, but I found it. There was an M shaped line of bright stars on one side of the cluster. The cluster itself was a closely knit group of stars arranged in a circle. Together, it looked like a cluster of stars sitting on the letter M. Predominant stars are along NW edge. 150x yields additional faint stars in haze of cluster, but difficult.\n\nNGC7790: Open cluster in Cassiopeia. Small cluster with three stars at West trailed by a haze in a cone shape. Very few stars resolve at 150x. Clouds impeded view.\n\nNGC7814: Caldwell 43. Galaxy. Pegasus. From Algenib, up. Fuzzy spot. No core, but bright center. Very small. Not visible at low power. Obvious at 150x.\n\nOther Objects:\n\nStephan’s Quintet: Just looks like a fuzzy spot. I could only ID three of the five galaxies with any certainty, but the fourth was probably visible. It just blended together with the third middle galaxy. I couldn’t see a fifth. So what I saw included NGC7319, NGC7320, NGC1318A & B.\n\nComet Garradd – Near M92 cluster, seen on 2/6/2012. No wispy tail. Just a gray circle, as if it were only a diffuse globular cluster. Observed again on 3/21 – 3/23 2012. Larger gray circle of hydrogen cloud with good coma. Visible wide tail on the bottom, confirmed by images in a magazine article.\n\nStock 2: Open cluster between Perseus & Cassiopeia\n\nSN2012aw: Supernova in M95 that was recently discovered. In darker skies where M95 is more apparent, the SN was visible, but I am unable to find it again in my home sky.\n\nMilky Way arched across the eastern sky at the HGSP from around 3:30am until 4:30am. Very puffy cloud-like appearance spanning from Sagittarius into the northeast.\n\nBarnard 86: Dark nebula next to NGC6520. No detail is seen similar to what has been posted in online photos (like how it almost envelops NGC6520), but it is easy to see next to the cluster.\n\nCB 158/159: dark nebula in Scutum near M11, the Wild Duck Cluster. Easy to spot at Okie Tex.\n\nBarnard 72, a dark nebula in Ophiuchus. It’s called the Snake. Why? It snakes around the sky in a kind of S shape. The extra contrast was easy to spot and follow. The dark lane was really neat to me.\n\nKemble’s Cascade (K-1) & NGC1502: I needed some help with this. I wasn’t quite sure what I needed to see with this one. Kemble’s Cascade is an asterism consisting of a long line of stars and NGC1502 is a small open cluster in Camelopardalis. Very fun object to find if you have a moment.\n\nBarnard 51: a dark nebula near NGC6287, a decent sized globular cluster. B51 was located above the glob and really only resembled a small dark circle.\n\nBarnard 142 & 143 – Barnard’s E: Two dark nebulae in Aquila near Altair. Together, they form an E shaped object. Very neat. Low power wide field kind of object.\n\nComet 168/P Hergenrother: Observed on a few different nights in October of 2012. Viewed on October 8, 2012 and followed up on its location on October 15, 2012. It was located in Pegasus, on its way across from Psi Pegasi to 78 Pegasi. Sometimes difficult to see. Decent coma. Not much of a tail. Definite bias to one side. Easier to find the night it was near 78 Peg. Better view was in my 17mm (70x) over high power.\n\nAsteroid 4179 Toutatis at 6:53pm and at 7:06pm on December 12, 2012. It was located near Xi Piscium and HR527. It only appeared as a small dot and no live movement was discernible. I had to observe changes in between views. I even drew a small sketch of its path. Found it at 37x. Viewed it at 70x.\n\nComet C/2012 K5 LINEAR: Observed on December 20, 2012 in the constellation Ursa Major along the edge of the spoon of the dipper. Not impressive, but still low at 23 degrees. Not much of a coma. Slight tail. Small object. Faint. Easier to view at low power. Almost not visible at high power and next to impossible to find.\n\nAbell 21: Medusa Nebula. Planetary nebula in Gemini. Starhopped to this object from Alkibash in Gemini using a few different pairs of stars. Very difficult object to see. OIII/UHC filter was required, along with moving the scope back and forth. Even then, a blurry fuzz was all I could see and within an instant, it would be gone. Vertically oriented fuzzy spot. No definite edges. No discernible characteristics.\n\nComet C/2011 L4 (PANSTARRS): Viewed in March of 2013. First spotted in binoculars low on the horizon above the sunset. Briefly observed in the 8″ scope on that same day. Spotted days later in binoculars and a 4.5″ reflector. Good orange core. Thin coma. Decent tail extending outward. Video on YouTube. Photos on blog, Instagram, and my Google album.\n\nIC 434: Emission nebula in Orion. Visible, extending out to the side from Alnitak. Horsehead dark region not visualized. Seen at Okie Tex 2012.\n\nIC 432: Faint nebulosity around the star adjacent to Alnitak. Asymmetrical nebulosity. Seen at HGSP 2013.\n\nIC 405. Caldwell 31. Flaming Star Nebula in Auriga. UHC filter/32mm ep. Nebulosity inside six stars in a C shape. Brightest star located at bottom of C. Will revisit in darker skies.\n\nIC 342: Caldwell 5. Galaxy in Camelopardalis. Low surface brightness. Viewed at 46-48x. One spiral arm visualized adjacent to a triangle of stars. Possible visualization of core (hazy star) at 48x.\n\nIC 4634: PN in Ophiuchus. Small fuzzy object in 38mm (32x). Somewhat easier to visualize in 13mm (92x). Central star indeterminate, but likely observed. Not well defined. Fuzzy circle with non-distinct borders. Observed at OkieTex 2013.\n\nIC 4593: PN in Hercules. Star-like with flicker at low power in 26mm (46x). Flicker not as apparent at higher power (13mm), but PN quality is obvious. Difficult to focus. Small symmetrical halo.\n\nIC 1805: Heart Nebula in Cassiopeia. OIII filter – Vertical line bottom up more apparent than top half. Top comes out after adaptation. Dark lanes possibly there, but could just be my imagination. UHC filter – No easy way to distinguish views between UHC and OIII aside from being easier to spot.\n\nIC 1848: Soul Nebula in Cassiopeia. OIII filter – More pronounced nebulosity across the field. Wider than Heart Nebula. Difficult to distinguish sections. Harder to visualize than Heart Nebula. UHC filter – No easy way to distinguish views between UHC and OIII aside from being easier to spot.\n\nNova Delphinus 2013: A star in Delphinus went nova and brightened to anywhere between mag +4 and +5. I observed this star on 8/18/2013 when it was probably around mag +5. It was not visible to the naked eye, mainly thanks to some light pollution and extra moonlight. I took photos, both at low power in four second exposures and in the eyepiece.\n\nSN2014J observed at West end of Messier 82 oriented by nearby star at South. SN is halfway between core and end of western needle edge.\n\nUnconfirmed finds/Seen in other telescopes\n\nDraco Dwarf\n\nI noticed a fuzzy area around a bright star, more of a faint glow really, that barely came out against the background sky. The area looked elongated as an elliptical galaxy might, and the landmarks corresponded to what was in SkySafari. I am 60% certain I found the Draco Dwarf.\n\nObserved NGC1999 in an 18″ Obsession. The owner of that 18 told me he’s the one who pestered the folks at SkySafari to include this object. What I saw resembled a donut, but apparently the rest of the nebula was not visible. It was located adjacent to M42.\n\nEinstein’s Cross – David Kreige (Obsession Telescopes) wanted to see this object in his 25″ scope. I saw 2 or 3 (3 and 6 o’clock). He thought he saw something at 3 and 12. The object is such a difficult thing to see anyway, so if we did see two or three parts of it, I suppose we should consider ourselves lucky.\n\nBarnard 33: Horsehead Nebula. Visualized this hard to find object in an 18″ Obsession. The shape took up most of the field, but it didn’t take much effort to draw out its shape.\n\nObserved some galaxies in Draco in a 16″, a line of three galaxies, something commonly referred to as the Draco Group (NGC5981, NGC5982, and NGC5985), although there was a fourth and fifth, NGC 5976 and 5976A. I could see 5976A, 5981, and 5982, but not 5985. Of course, some of this was a little bit of guessing on my part.\n\nNGC2024: Flame Nebula. Observed in high end refractor at HGSP 2013. Flame tree-like appearance was obvious as it spread out away from Alnitak."
