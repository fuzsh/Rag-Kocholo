        "text": "The oxygen abundances for four dwarf spiral galaxies have been determined using long-slit spectroscopy. The abundances of these galaxies have not previously reported in the literature. Several HII regions were detected in each galaxy. The electronic temperature method could be used only in one region because of the lack of the auroral lines of oxygen or sulfur. Therefore, four different semi empirical methods were used in the abundance determinations and a weighted-average abundance is obtained. The abundances of three of the galaxies are sub solar for all the regions, one of them having a very low metallicity. Only three HII regions in the fourth galaxy show slightly over solar abundances. Three of the HII regions might have a PN embedded. A comparison with the oxygen abundances among different types of late-type galaxies (BCG, LSBG, dI, Sm) is made. The conclusion is that all of them show the same range in metallicity. Also, the log(N/O) is similar, showing a secondary behaviour for abundances larger than 8.2 dex in spite of the morphological type of the mother galaxy.\n\nRecent studies of the near-infrared (NIR) properties of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIs) and blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) have provided improved estimates for the NIR luminosity of old stellar populations in these galaxies. These can be used to derive gas fractions, and thereby to evaluate how BCDs have evolved with respect to dIs. Oxygen abundances have been derived for four BCDs in the Virgo Cluster from a run at Gemini-North in 2003. Combining these new abundances with published values, we study the correlations among the metallicity, Ks luminosity, gas mass, baryonic mass, and gas fraction. Within errors, the two types of dwarfs appear to share a common relation between the oxygen abundance and the luminosity in Ks. The correlation between metallicity and the gas fraction is the same for BCDs as for dIs, indicating that BCD evolution has been similar to dIs. Since dIs appear to have evolved as isolated systems, the BCD bursts are unlikely to be a consequence of gas infall or merging."
