        "text": "New CO and H alpha observations of Magellanic-type irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDettmar, Ralf-Jurgen; Becker, Renate; Shaw, Martin\n\nIn order to study the star-forming regions in Magellanic-type irregular galaxies and their relation to molecular cloud complexes, we obtained hydrogen alpha images of several southern objects. In addition, we detected and mapped some of these objects in the J = 1-0 CO line. The weak CO emission of most irregulars made it necessary to integrate for 2-8 hours per position. We describe some preliminary results for IC 4662, DDO 70 (Sex B), and IC 5052.\n\nHubble Spotlight on Irregular Galaxy\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nThis delicate blue group of stars â actually an irregular galaxy named IC 3583 â sits some 30 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo (The Virgin). It may seem to have no discernable structure, but IC 3583 has been found to have a bar of stars running through its center. These structures are common throughout the Universe, and are found within the majority of spiral, many irregular, and some lenticular galaxies. Two of our closest cosmic neighbors, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, are barred, indicating that they may have once been barred spiral galaxies that were disrupted or torn apart by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way. Researchers at the University of Leicester, England note there are two types of irregular galaxy. Type I's are usually single galaxies of peculiar appearance. They contain a large fraction of young stars, and show the luminous nebulae that are also visible in spiral galaxies. Type II irregulars include the group known as interacting or disrupting galaxies, in which the strange appearance is due to two or more galaxies colliding, merging or otherwise interacting gravitationally. Something similar might be happening with IC 3583. This small galaxy is thought to be gravitationally interacting with one of its neighbors, the spiral Messier 90. Together, the duo form a pairing known as Arp 76. Itâs still unclear whether these flirtations are the cause of IC 3583âs irregular appearance â but whatever the cause, the galaxy makes for a strikingly delicate sight in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image, glimmering in the blackness of space.

The known distance of these galaxies can help us easily categorize the luminosity of the pulsars and their age difference can be helpful for for studying the origin and evolution of compact objects. Therefore, a complete archive of 116 XMM-Newton PN, 151 Chandra (Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer) ACIS, and 952 RXTE PCA observations for the pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) were collected and analyzed, along with 42 XMM-Newton and 30 Chandra observations for the Large Magellanic Cloud, spanning 1997-2014. From a sample of 67 SMC pulsars we generate a suite of products for each pulsar detection: spin period, flux, event list, high time-resolution light-curve, pulse-profile, periodogram, and X-ray spectrum. Combining all three satellites, I generated complete histories of the spin periods, pulse amplitudes, pulsed fractions and X-ray luminosities. Many of the pulsars show variations in pulse period due to the combination of orbital motion and accretion torques. Long-term spin-up/down trends are seen in 28/25 pulsars respectively, pointing to sustained transfer of mass and angular momentum to the neutron star on decadal timescales. The distributions of pulse detection and flux as functions of spin period provide interesting findings: mapping boundaries of accretion-driven X-ray luminosity, and showing that fast pulsars (P<10 s) are rarely detected, which yet are more prone to giant outbursts. In parallel we compare the observed pulse profiles to our general relativity (GR) model of X-ray emission in order to constrain the physical parameters of the pulsars.In addition, we conduct a search for optical counterparts to X-ray sources in the local dwarf galaxy IC 10 to form a comparison\n\nStar Formation in Irregular Galaxies.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHunter, Deidre; Wolff, Sidney\n\n1985-01-01\n\nExamines mechanisms of how stars are formed in irregular galaxies.

Spatially Resolved Star Formation History of the Magellanic Irregular NGC 4449\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSacchi, E.; Cignoni, M.; Aloisi, A.; Tosi, M.; Calzetti, D.; Lee, J. C.; Adamo, A.; Annibali, F.; Dale, D. A.; Elmegreen, B. G.; Gouliermis, D. A.; Grasha, K.; Grebel, E. K.; Hunter, D. A.; Sabbi, E.; Smith, L. J.; Thilker, D. A.; Ubeda, L.; Whitmore, B. C.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe present a detailed study of the Magellanic irregular galaxy NGC 4449 based on both archival and new photometric data from the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3. Thanks to its proximity (D = 3.82 Â± 0.27 Mpc), we reach stars 3 mag fainter than the tip of the red giant branch in the F814W filter. The recovered star formation history (SFH) spans the whole Hubble time, but due to the ageâmetallicity degeneracy of the red giant branch stars, it is robust only over the lookback time reached by our photometry, i.e., â¼3 Gyr. The most recent peak of star formation (SF) is around 10 Myr ago. The average surface density SF rate over the whole galaxy lifetime is 0.01 M â yrâ1 kpcâ2. From our study, it emerges that NGC 4449 has experienced a fairly continuous SF regime in the last 1 Gyr, with peaks and dips whose SF rates differ only by a factor of a few. The very complex and disturbed morphology of NGC 4449 makes it an interesting galaxy for studies of the relationship between interactions and starbursts, and our detailed and spatially resolved analysis of its SFH does indeed provide some hints on the connection between these two phenomena in this peculiar dwarf galaxy. Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.\n\nThe Nature of Turbulence in the LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMaier, Erin; Chien, Li-Hsin; Hollyday, Gigja\n\nWe present probability density functions and higher order (skewness and kurtosis) analyses of the galaxy-wide and spatially resolved distributions of H i column density in the LITTLE THINGS sample of dwarf irregular galaxies. This analysis follows that of Burkhart et al. for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). About 60% of our sample have galaxy-wide values of kurtosis that are similar to that found for the SMC, with a range up to much higher values, and kurtosis increases with integrated star formation rate. Kurtosis and skewness were calculated for radial annuli and for a grid of 32 pixelÂ ÃÂ 32 pixel kernels acrossmoreÂ Â» each galaxy. For most galaxies, kurtosis correlates with skewness. For about half of the galaxies, there is a trend of increasing kurtosis with radius. The range of kurtosis and skewness values is modeled by small variations in the Mach number close to the sonic limit and by conversion of H i to molecules at high column density. The maximum H i column densities decrease with increasing radius in a way that suggests molecules are forming in the weak-field limit, where H{sub 2} formation balances photodissociation in optically thin gas at the edges of clouds.Â«Â less\n\nPhotometry of resolved galaxies. V - NGC 6822\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHoessel, J. G.; Anderson, N.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThree-color CCD frames of the local group irregular galaxy NGC 6822 have been reduced to GRI photometry for 3475 stars using RICHFLD point-spread function fitting techniques. The data are compared with earlier work on this galaxy, particularly with Kayser (1966) on a star-by-star basis. Color-magnitude diagrams are constructed from the data and compared with both theoretical stellar model tracks and the expected foreground star contamination. A luminosity function for the blue stars is derived; comparison of this luminosity function with those of 10 other irregular galaxies indicates that NGC 6822 has a typical young star population. The stellar birthrate and initial mass function are estimated for this galaxy. The slope at the bright end of the mass function looks similar to recent results for the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and the irregular galaxy Sextans A. NGC 6822 appears to be presently forming stars at a slower rate for its mass than Sextans A or the Magellanic Clouds.\n\nStar Formation in Galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1987-01-01\n\nTopics addressed include: star formation; galactic infrared emission; molecular clouds; OB star luminosity; dust grains; IRAS observations; galactic disks; stellar formation in Magellanic clouds; irregular galaxies; spiral galaxies; starbursts; morphology of galactic centers; and far-infrared observations.\n\nSolo dwarfs I: survey introduction and first results for the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHiggs, C. R.; McConnachie, A. W.; Irwin, M.; Bate, N. F.; Lewis, G. F.; Walker, M. G.; CÃ´tÃ©, P.; Venn, K.; Battaglia, G.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe introduce the Solitary Local dwarfs survey (Solo), a wide-field photometric study targeting every isolated dwarf galaxy within 3 Mpc of the Milky Way. Solo is based on (u)gi multiband imaging from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam for northern targets, and Magellan/Megacam for southern targets. All galaxies fainter than MV â -18 situated beyond the nominal virial radius of the Milky Way and M31 (â³300 kpc) are included in this volume-limited sample, for a total of 42 targets. In addition to reviewing the survey goals and strategy, we present results for the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy (Sag DIG), one of the most isolated, low-mass galaxies, located at the edge of the Local Group. We analyse its resolved stellar populations and their spatial distributions. We provide updated estimates of its central surface brightness and integrated luminosity, and trace its surface brightness profile to a level fainter than 30 mag arcsec-2. Sag DIG is well described by a highly elliptical (disc-like) system following a single component SÃ©rsic model. However, a low-level distortion is present at the outer edges of the galaxy that, were Sag DIG not so isolated, would likely be attributed to some kind of previous tidal interaction. Further, we find evidence of an extremely low level, extended distribution of stars beyond Ë5 arcmin (>1.5 kpc) that suggests Sag DIG may be embedded in a very low-density stellar halo. We compare the stellar and H I structures of Sag DIG, and discuss results for this galaxy in relation to other isolated, dwarf irregular galaxies in the Local Group.\n\nGas and Dust Properties in Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJones, A. P.; Madden, S. C.; Colgan, S. W. J.; Geis, N.; Haas, M.; Maloney, P.; Nikola, T.; Poglitsch, A.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe present a study of the 158 (micron)meter [C II] fine structure emission line from a sample of 11 low metallicity irregular galaxies using the NASA Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO). Our preliminary results demonstrate that the ratio of the 158 (micron)meter [C II] emission to the CO-12(1 yields 0) emission ranges from 6,000 to 46,000. These ratios are significantly enhanced relative to clouds within the Galaxy and to normal metallicity galaxies, which typically have values in the range 2,000 to 6,300. We also find that the [C II] emission in dwarf irregular galaxies can be up to 5% of the far-infrared (FIR) emission, a higher fraction of the FIR than in normal metallicity galaxies. We discuss these results for the dwarf irregular galaxies and compare them to those observed in normal metallicity galaxies. The enhanced 158 (micron)meter [C II] emission relative to CO-12(1 yields 0) emission can be understood in terms of the increased penetration depth of ultraviolet (UV) photons into the clouds in low metallicity environments.\n\nExploring Properties of HI Clouds in Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBerger, Clara; Hunter, Deidre Ann\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDwarf Irregular galaxies form stars and maintain exponential stellar disks at extremely low gas densities. One proposed method of maintaining such regular outer disks is scattering stars off of HI clouds. In order to understand the processes present in dwarf irregular stellar disks, we present a survey of atomic hydrogen clouds in and around a subset of representative galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey. We apply a cloud identification program to the 21 cm HI line emission cubes and extract masses, radii, surface densities, and distances from the center of the galaxy in the plane of the galaxy of each cloud. Our data show a wide range of clouds characterized by low surface densities but varied in mass and size. The number of clouds found and the mass of the most massive cloud show no correlation to integrated star forming rates or luminosity in these galaxies. However, they will be used as input for models of stars scattering off of HI clouds to better understand the regular stellar disks in dwarf Irregular galaxies.We acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation grant AST-1461200 to Northern Arizona University for Research Experiences for Undergraduates summer internships.\n\nPresent-day Galaxy Evolution through Baryon Flows in the Circumgalactic Medium of the Galactic-Magellanic System\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarger, Kathleen Ann\n\nGalaxy evolution is governed by an intricate ballet of gas flows. To sustain star formation over many billions of years, more gas must inflow than outflow. Although numerous gas clouds surround the Milky Way, their attributes, origins, destinations, and responses to their surroundings need thorough investigation on an individual basis to realize how the entire population affects Galactic evolution. This dissertation hones in on two circumgalactic gas structures near the Milky Way: Complex A and the Magellanic Bridge. Complex A is an elongated gas structure that is traversing the hot Halo of the Milky Way, plummeting towards the Galaxy's disk. The Magellanic Bridge is a bridge of gas and stars that connects the Magellanic Clouds, created by galaxy interactions. In this thesis, I present the results of the highest sensitivity and kinematically resolved Halpha emission-line survey of Complex A and Halpha, [S II], and [N II] surveys of the Magellanic Bridge using the Wisconsin Halpha Mapper to explore their properties, surroundings, origins, and fates to unravel how circumgalactic structures influence galaxy evolution. I find that the observational properties of Complex A closely match with radiative transfer model predictions of a cloud ionized by the Milky Way and extragalactic background, implying a 5% escape fraction of ionizing photons from the Galactic disk. The multiline observations and modeling place the cloud's metallicity below solar. These results combined with other studies suggests the cloud has an intergalactic medium origin. I find that the global distribution of the warm ionized gas traces the neutral gas in the Magellanic Bridge. These observations place the ionized gas mass between (0.7 -- 1.6) x 108 solar masses, implying an ionization fraction of 25 -- 33% and a 5% maximum escape fraction of ionizing photons from the Magellanic Clouds. The line ratios reveal that the physical state of the the SMC-Tail and the LMC-Bridge interface regions differ\n\nCannibalization of Dwarf Galaxies by the Milky Way: Distance to the Leading Arm of the Magellanic Clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAntwi-Danso, Jacqueline; Barger, Kathleen; Haffner, L. Matthew\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTidal interactions between two dwarf galaxies near the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, have caused large quantities of gas to be flung into the halo of the Milky Way. Much of this tidal debris, known as the Magellanic System, is currently headed towards the disk of the Milky Way, spearheaded by the Leading Arm, with the Bridge connecting the two dwarf galaxies, and the trailing Magellanic Stream at the end. Estimates for the amount of gas that the Magellanic System contains are in the range of (2 - 4) Ã 109 Mâ and this could supply our Galaxy with (3.7 - 6.7) Mâ yr-1 (Fox et al. 2014). Although this is higher than the present star-formation rate of the Galaxy, the position of the tidal debris predisposes it to ionizing radiation from the extragalactic background and Galactic disk, as well as ram-pressure stripping from the halo, hindering gas accretion. Some parts of the Leading Arm, however, appear to have already survived the trip to the disk as their morphology is indicative of interaction with the interstellar medium of the Galaxy. The exact amount of gas that this structure contains is uncertain because of weak constrains in its distance. In this study, we made seven pointed HÎ± observations using the Wisconsin HÎ± Mapper Telescope and then compared the HÎ± intensity we obtained to models of the anticipated ionizing flux from the Milky Way and extragalactic background. From this, we calculated the distance from the Sun to the Leading Arm of the Magellanic System at the locations of our observations.\n\nA Dwarf Galaxy Star Bar and Dusty Wing\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2012-01-10\n\nIn combined data from ESA Herschel and NASA Spitzer telescopes, irregular distribution of dust in the Small Magellanic Cloud becomes clear. A stream of dust extends to left, known as the galaxy wing, and a bar of star formation appears to right.\n\nBlue compact dwarfs - Extreme dwarf irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nThuan, Trinh X.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nObservational data on the most extreme members of the irregular dwarf (dI) galaxy class, the blue compact dwarfs (BCDs), are characterized, reviewing the results of recent investigations. The properties of the young stellar population, the ionized gas, the older star population, and the gas and dust of BCDs are contrasted with those of other dIs; BCD morphology is illustrated with sample images; and the value of BCDs (as nearby 'young' chemically unevolved galaxies) for studies of galaxy formation, galactic evolution, and starburst triggering mechanisms is indicated.\n\nMassive Star Cluster Populations in Irregular Galaxies as Probable Younger Counterparts of Old Metal-rich Globular Cluster Populations in Spheroids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKravtsov, V. V.\n\n2006-09-01\n\nPeak metallicities of metal-rich populations of globular clusters (MRGCs) belonging to early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral galaxies (spheroids) of different mass fall within the somewhat conservative -0.7<=[Fe/H]<=-0.3 range. Indeed, if possible age effects are taken into account, this metallicity range might become smaller. Irregular galaxies such as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with longer timescales of formation and lower star formation (SF) efficiency, do not contain old MRGCs with [Fe/H]>-1.0, but they are observed to form populations of young/intermediate-age massive star clusters (MSCs) with masses exceeding 104 Msolar. Their formation is widely believed to be an accidental process fully dependent on external factors. From the analysis of available data on the populations and their hosts, including intermediate-age populous star clusters in the LMC, we find that their most probable mean metallicities fall within -0.7<=[Fe/H]<=-0.3, as the peak metallicities of MRGCs do, irrespective of signs of interaction. Moreover, both the disk giant metallicity distribution function (MDF) in the LMC and the MDFs for old giants in the halos of massive spheroids exhibit a significant increase toward [Fe/H]~-0.5. That is in agreement with a correlation found between SF activity in galaxies and their metallicity. The formation of both the old MRGCs in spheroids and MSC populations in irregular galaxies probably occurs at approximately the same stage of the host galaxies' chemical evolution and is related to the essentially increased SF activity in the hosts around the same metallicity that is achieved very early in massive spheroids, later in lower mass spheroids, and much later in irregular galaxies. Changes in the interstellar dust, particularly in elemental abundances in dust grains and in the mass distribution function of the grains, may be among the factors regulating star and MSC formation activity in galaxies. Strong interactions and mergers\n\nMagnetic field evolution in dwarf and Magellanic-type galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSiejkowski, H.; Soida, M.; ChyÅ¼y, K. T.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAims: Low-mass galaxies radio observations show in many cases surprisingly high levels of magnetic field. The mass and kinematics of such objects do not favour the development of effective large-scale dynamo action. We attempted to check if the cosmic-ray-driven dynamo can be responsible for measured magnetization in this class of poorly investigated objects. We investigated how starburst events on the whole, as well as when part of the galactic disk, influence the magnetic field evolution. Methods: We created a model of a dwarf/Magellanic-type galaxy described by gravitational potential constituted from two components: the stars and the dark-matter halo. The model is evolved by solving a three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic equation with an additional cosmic-ray component, which is approximated as a fluid. The turbulence is generated in the system via supernova explosions manifested by the injection of cosmic-rays. Results: The cosmic-ray-driven dynamo works efficiently enough to amplify the magnetic field even in low-mass dwarf/Magellanic-type galaxies. The e-folding times of magnetic energy growth are 0.50 and 0.25 Gyr for the slow (50 km s-1) and fast (100 km s-1) rotators, respectively. The amplification is being suppressed as the system reaches the equipartition level between kinetic, magnetic, and cosmic-ray energies. An episode of star formation burst amplifies the magnetic field but only for a short time while increased star formation activity holds. We find that a substantial amount of gas is expelled from the galactic disk, and that the starburst events increase the efficiency of this process.\n\nObservations of CO in the Magellanic irregular galaxy NGC 55\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHeithausen, Andreas; Dettmar, Ralf-Juergen\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe content of molecular gas in galaxies, mainly H2, is one of the key observations necessary for the understanding of star formation processes and history. As the CO molecule is the most widely distributed molecule after H2 and has easily observable mm lines, it is used as a tracer for the molecular gas. CO was detected towards the direction where the H alpha and 6 cm radio continuum emission is strongest (Hummel et al. 1986). Here, researchers present the Gaussian line parameters in tabular form. The distribution of CO corresponds well with the intense HI cloud near the bar of NGC 55. The extent of the CO cloud is about 975 pc perpendicular to the major axis. As the radio continuum and the H alpha emission also peaks in this region, it is most probably associated with the star forming region in NGC 55. Assuming that the molecular gas is in virial equilibrium, researchers derive a mass of about 8 times 10(exp 7) solar magnitude. The molecular mass found indicates that the conversion factor for the molecular mass in Irr galaxies as inferred from CO line emission is indeed higher by up to a factor of 20 compared to the canonical value for the Galaxy.\n\nFar-infrared line images of dwarf galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPoglitsch, A.; Geis, N.; Herrmann, F.; Madden, S. C.; Stacey, G. J.; Townes, C. H.; Genzel, R.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nIrregular dwarf galaxies are about ten times more widespread in the universe than regular spiral galaxies. They are characterized by a relatively low metallicity, i.e., lower abundance of the heavier elements (metals) with respect to hydrogen than in the solar neighborhood. These heavier elements in the form of molecules, atoms, or ions, which have radiative transitions in the infrared play a decisive role in the energy balance of the ISM and thereby for the formation of stars. Dwarf galaxies are thus model cases for the physical conditions in the early phase of the universe. Large Magellanic Cloud: 30 Doradus. The two nearest dwarf galaxies are the Magellanic clouds at a distance approximately 50 kpc. The LMC contains 30 Dor, a region with young, extremely massive stars which strongly interact with the surrounding ISM on account of their stellar winds and intense UV radiation. 30 Dor is the brightest object in the LMC at almost all wavelengths.\n\nMass Loss from Dusty AGB and Red Supergiant Stars in the Magellanic Clouds and in the Galaxy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSargent, Benjamin A.; Srinivasan, Sundar; Meixner, Margaret; Kastner, Joel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAsymptotic giant branch (AGB) and red supergiant (RSG) stars are evolved stars that eject large parts of their mass in outflows of dust and gas. As part of an ongoing effort to measure mass loss from evolved stars in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds, we are modeling mass loss from AGB and RSG stars in these galaxies. Our approach is twofold. We pursue radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of AGB and RSG stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and in the Galactic bulge and in globular clusters of the Milky Way. We are also constructing detailed dust opacity models of AGB and RSG stars in these galaxies for which we have infrared spectra; e.g., from the Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). Our sample of infrared spectra largely comes from Spitzer-IRS observations. The detailed dust modeling of spectra informs our choice of dust properties to use in radiative transfer modeling of SEDs. We seek to determine how mass loss from these evolved stars depends upon the metallicity of their host environments.

Richard, III; Schneider, Stephen E.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nA complete (with the the exception of one) redshift sample of 58 galaxies in the Nilson catalog classified as dwarf, irregular, or Magellanic irregular is used to investigate the large-scale clustering properties of these low-surface brightness galaxies in the CfA slice of the universe (alpha in the range of 8-17 h, delta in the range of 26.5-32.5 deg). It is found that the low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies also lie on the structures delineated by the high-surface brightness normal galaxies and that they do not fill in the voids. This is inconsistent with a class of biased galaxy formation theories which predict that dwarf galaxies should be present everywhere, including the voids.\n\nTRANSIENT X-RAY SOURCE POPULATION IN THE MAGELLANIC-TYPE GALAXY NGC 55\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJithesh, V.; Wang, Zhongxiang, E-mail: jithesh@shao.ac.cn\n\n2016-04-10\n\nWe present the spectral and temporal properties of 15 candidate transient X-ray sources detected in archival XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the nearby Magellanic-type, SB(s)m galaxy NGC 55. Based on an X-ray color classification scheme, the majority of the sources may be identified as X-ray binaries (XRBs), and six sources are soft, including a likely supernova remnant. We perform a detailed spectral and variability analysis of the data for two bright candidate XRBs. Both sources displayed strong short-term X-ray variability, and their X-ray spectra and hardness ratios are consistent with those of XRBs. These results, combined with their high X-raymoreÂ Â» luminosities (â¼10{sup 38} erg s{sup â1}), strongly suggest that they are black hole (BH) binaries. Seven less luminous sources have spectral properties consistent with those of neutron star or BH XRBs in both normal and high-rate accretion modes, but one of them is the likely counterpart to a background galaxy (because of positional coincidence). From our spectral analysis, we find that the six soft sources are candidate super soft sources (SSSs) with dominant emission in the soft (0.3â2 keV) X-ray band. Archival Hubble Space Telescope optical images for seven sources are available, and the data suggest that most of them are likely to be high-mass XRBs. Our analysis has revealed the heterogeneous nature of the transient population in NGC 55 (six high-mass XRBs, one low-mass XRBs, six SSSs, one active galactic nucleus), helping establish the similarity of the X-ray properties of this galaxy to those of other Magellanic-type galaxies.Â«Â less\n\nWide-field Imaging of the Environments of LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHunter, Deidre A.; Melton, Casey; Leshin, Stephen; Wong, Alson; Clark, Maurice; Kamienski, Jerald; Moriya, Netzer; Packwood, Burley; Birket, Bob; Edwards, William; Millward, Mervyn; Wheelband, Ian\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe have obtained wide-field images of 36 of the 41 LITTLE THINGS (Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey) nearby (<10.3 Mpc) dwarf irregular and blue compact dwarf galaxies. Although the LITTLE THINGS galaxies were chosen to be non-interacting and no companions were found in H I imaging, the purpose of this imaging was to search for optical companion galaxies that had been missed in imaging with smaller fields of view and that might indicate an external factor in ongoing star formation. The limiting magnitudes of the images range from 19.7 to 28.3 mag arcsecâ2, with a median value of 25.9 mag arcsecâ2. We did not find any unknown companions. Two of the LITTLE THINGS galaxies, NGC 4163 and NGC 4214, and the fainter dwarf, UGCA 276, lie potentially within 100 kpc of each other, but our imaging does not reveal any stellar bridge between the galaxies. This project was part of the Lowell Amateur Research Initiative.\n\nStar Formation Histories of Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSkillman, Evan\n\n1995-07-01\n\nWe propose to obtain deep WFPC2 `BVI' color-magnitude diagrams {CMDs} for the dwarf irregular {dI} Local Group galaxies GR 8, Leo A, Pegasus, and Sextans A. In addition to resolved stars, we will use star clusters, and especially any globulars, to probe the history of intense star formation. These data will allow us to map the Pop I and Pop II stellar components, and thereby construct the first detailed star formation histories for non-interacting dI galaxies. Our results will bear on a variety of astrophysical problems, including the evolution of small galaxies, distances in the Local Group, age-metallicity distributions in small galaxies, ages of dIs, and the physics of star formation. The four target galaxies are typical dI systems in terms of luminosity, gas content, and H II region abundance, and represent a range in current star forming activity. They are sufficiently near to allow us to reach to stars at M_V = 0, have 0.1 of the luminosity of the SMC and 0.25 of its oxygen abundance. Unlike the SMC, these dIs are not near giant galaxies. This project will allow the extension of our knowledge of stellar populations in star forming galaxies from the spirals in the Local Group down to its smallest members. We plan to take maximum advantage of the unique data which this project will provide. Our investigator team brings extensive and varied experience in studies of dwarf galaxies, stellar populations, imaging photometry, and stellar evolution to this project.\n\nExtended Schmidt law holds for faint dwarf irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoychowdhury, Sambit; Chengalur, Jayaram N.; Shi, Yong\n\n2017-12-01\n\nContext. The extended Schmidt law (ESL) is a variant of the Schmidt which relates the surface densities of gas and star formation, with the surface density of stellar mass added as an extra parameter. Although ESL has been shown to be valid for a wide range of galaxy properties, its validity in low-metallicity galaxies has not been comprehensively tested. This is important because metallicity affects the crucial atomic-to-molecular transition step in the process of conversion of gas to stars. Aims: We empirically investigate for the first time whether low metallicity faint dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs) from the local universe follow the ESL. Here we consider the \"global\" law where surface densities are averaged over the galactic discs. dIrrs are unique not only because they are at the lowest end of mass and star formation scales for galaxies, but also because they are metal-poor compared to the general population of galaxies. Methods: Our sample is drawn from the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS) which is the largest survey of atomic hydrogen in such galaxies. The gas surface densities are determined using their atomic hydrogen content. The star formation rates are calculated using GALEX far ultraviolet fluxes after correcting for dust extinction, whereas the stellar surface densities are calculated using Spitzer 3.6 Î¼m fluxes. The surface densities are calculated over the stellar discs defined by the 3.6 Î¼m images. Results: We find dIrrs indeed follow the ESL. The mean deviation of the FIGGS galaxies from the relation is 0.01 dex, with a scatter around the relation of less than half that seen in the original relation. In comparison, we also show that the FIGGS galaxies are much more deviant when compared to the \"canonical\" Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Conclusions: Our results help strengthen the universality of the ESL, especially for galaxies with low metallicities. We suggest that models of star formation in which feedback from previous generations\n\nAn Ultra-faint Galaxy Candidate Discovered in Early Data from the Magellanic Satellites Survey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDrlica-Wagner, A.; Bechtol, K.; Allam, S.; Tucker, D.

P.; Yanny, B.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe report a new ultra-faint stellar system found in Dark Energy Camera data from the first observing run of the Magellanic Satellites Survey (MagLiteS). MagLiteS J0644-5953 (Pictor II or Pic II) is a low surface brightness (Î¼ ={28.5}-1+1 {mag} {arcsec}{}-2 within its half-light radius) resolved overdensity of old and metal-poor stars located at a heliocentric distance of {45}-4+5 {kpc}. The physical size ({r}1/2={46}-11+15 {pc} ) and low luminosity ({M}V=-{3.2}-0.5+0.4 {mag} ) of this satellite are consistent with the locus of spectroscopically confirmed ultra-faint galaxies. MagLiteS J0644-5953 (Pic II) is located {11.3}-0.9+3.1 {kpc} from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and comparisons with simulation results in the literature suggest that this satellite was likely accreted with the LMC. The close proximity of MagLiteS J0644-5953 (Pic II) to the LMC also makes it the most likely ultra-faint galaxy candidate to still be gravitationally bound to the LMC.\n\nMAJOR MERGERS WITH SMALL GALAXIES: THE DISCOVERY OF A MAGELLANIC-TYPE GALAXY AT z = 0.12\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKoch, Andreas; Frank, Matthias J.; Pasquali, Anna\n\nWe report on the serendipitous discovery of a star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.116 with morphological features that indicate an ongoing merger. This object exhibits two clearly separated components with significantly different colors, plus a possible tidal stream. Follow-up spectroscopy of the bluer component revealed a low star-forming activity of 0.09 M{sub â} yr{sup â1} and a high metallicity of 12Â +Â log(O/H) = 8.6. Based on comparison with massâstar formation-rate and massâmetallicity relations, and on fitting of spectral energy distributions, we obtain a stellar mass of 3 Ã 10{sup 9} M{sub â}, which renders this object comparable to the LargemoreÂ Â» Magellanic Cloud. Thus our finding provides a further piece of evidence of a major merger already acting on small, dwarf-galaxy-like scales.Â«Â less\n\nMassive stars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcia, Miriam\n\n2018-02-01\n\nLow metallicity massive stars hold the key to interpret numerous processes in the past Universe including re-ionization, starburst galaxies, high-redshift supernovae, and Î³-ray bursts. The Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy [SagDIG, 12+log(O/H) = 7.37] represents an important landmark in the quest for analogues accessible with 10-m class telescopes. This Letter presents low-resolution spectroscopy executed with the Gran Telescopio Canarias that confirms that SagDIG hosts massive stars. The observations unveiled three OBA-type stars and one red supergiant candidate. Pending confirmation from high-resolution follow-up studies, these could be the most metal-poor massive stars of the Local Group.\n\nMetallicity of Young and Old Stars in Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTikhonov, N. A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBased on archived images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, stellar photometry for 105 irregular galaxies has been conducted. We have shown the red supergiant and giant branches in the obtained Hertzsprung-Russel diagrams. Using the TRGB method, distances to galaxies and metallicity of red giants have been determined. The color index ( V - I) of the supergiant branch at the luminosity level M I = -7 was chosen as the metallicity index of red supergiants. For the galaxies under study, the diagrams have been built, in which the correlation can be seen between the luminosity of galaxies ( M B ) and metallicity of red giants and supergiants. The main source of variance of the results in the obtained diagrams is, in our opinion, uncertainty inmeasurements of galaxy luminosities and star-forming outburst. The relation between metallicity of young and old stars shows that main enrichment of galaxies with metals has taken place in the remote past. Deviations of some galaxies in the obtained relation can possibly be explained with the fall of the intergalactic gas on them, although, this inconsiderably affects metallicities of the stellar content.\n\nMetals and dust in the neutral ISM: the Galaxy, Magellanic Clouds, and damped Lyman-Î± absorbers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Cia, Annalisa\n\n2018-05-01\n\nContext. The presence of dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) dramatically changes the metal abundances that we measure. Understanding the metal content in the neutral ISM, and a direct comparison between different environments, has been hampered to date because of the degeneracy to the observed ISM abundances caused by the effects of metallicity, the presence of dust, and nucleosynthesis. Aims: We study the metal and dust content in the neutral ISM consistently in different environments, and assess the universality of recently discovered sequences of relative abundances. We also intend to assess the validity of [Zn/Fe] as a tracer of dust in the ISM. This has recently been cast into doubt based on observations of stellar abundances, and needs to be addressed before we can safely use it to study the ISM. Methods: In this letter we present a simple comparison of relative abundances observed in the neutral ISM in the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and damped Lyman-Î± absorbers (DLAs). The main novelty in this comparison is the inclusion of the Magellanic Clouds. Results: The same sequences of relative abundances are valid for the Galaxy, Magellanic Clouds, and DLAs. These sequences are driven by the presence of dust in the ISM and seem \"universal\". Conclusions: The metal and dust properties in the neutral ISM appear to follow a similar behaviour in different environments. This suggests that a dominant fraction of the dust budget is built up from grain growth in the ISM depending of the physical conditions and regardless of the star formation history of the system. In addition, the DLA gas behaves like the neutral ISM, at least from a chemical point of view. Finally, despite the deviations in [Zn/Fe] observed in stellar abundances, [Zn/Fe] is a robust dust tracer in the ISM of different environments, from the Galaxy to DLAs.\n\nHow Common are the Magellanic Clouds\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLiu, Lulu; Gerke, Brian F.; Wechsler, Risa H.\n\n2011-05-20\n\nWe introduce a probabilistic approach to the problem of counting dwarf satellites around host galaxies in databases with limited redshift information. This technique is used to investigate the occurrence of satellites with luminosities similar to the Magellanic Clouds around hosts with properties similar to the Milky Way in the object catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our analysis uses data from SDSS Data Release 7, selecting candidate Milky-Way-like hosts from the spectroscopic catalog and candidate analogs of the Magellanic Clouds from the photometric catalog. Our principal result is the probability for a Milky-Way-like galaxy to host N{sub sat} closemoreÂ Â» satellites with luminosities similar to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that 81 percent of galaxies like the Milky Way have no such satellites within a radius of 150 kpc, 11 percent have one, and only 3.5 percent of hosts have two. The probabilities are robust to changes in host and satellite selection criteria, background-estimation technique, and survey depth. These results demonstrate that the Milky Way has significantly more satellites than a typical galaxy of its luminosity; this fact is useful for understanding the larger cosmological context of our home galaxy.Â«Â less\n\nChemical evolution in spiral and irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTorres-Peimbert, S.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA brief review of models of chemical evolution of the interstellar medium in our galaxy and other galaxies is presented. These models predict the time variation and radial dependence of chemical composition in the gas as function of the input parameters; initial mass function, stellar birth rate, chemical composition of mass lost by stars during their evolution (yields), and the existence of large scale mass flows, like infall from the halo, outflow to the intergalactic medium or radial flows within a galaxy. At present there is a considerable wealth of observational data on the composition of HII regions in spiral and irregular galaxies to constrain the models. Comparisons are made between theory and the observed physical conditions. In particular, studies of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances are reviewed. In many molecular clouds the information we have on the amount of H2 is derived from the observed CO column density, and a standard CO/H2 ratio derived for the solar neighborhood. Chemical evolution models and the observed variations in O/H and N/O values, point out the need to include these results in a CO/H2 relation that should be, at least, a function of the O/H ratio. This aspect is also discussed.\n\nAn ultra-faint galaxy candidate discovered in early data from the Magellanic Satellites Survey\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nDrlica-Wagner, A.; Bechtol, Keith; Allam, S.; ...\n\n2016-11-30\n\nHere, we report a new ultra-faint stellar system found in Dark Energy Camera data from the first observing run of the Magellanic Satellites Survey (MagLiteS).

Thus, although the galactic LMXB greatly outnumber the MXRB, they are much less well understood. The X-ray binaries in the Magellanic Clouds in many ways make an ideal laboratory because they are all at the same, known distance. However, at the present time only a handful of X-ray binaries are known with certainty in these galaxies -- 7 in the LMC and 1 in the SMC. Only 3 of the LMC sources are low-mass X-ray binaries, and their properties are quite different from ``typical\" galactic LMXB. In this review we will outline the general properties of X-ray binaries and summarize what types of information we have learned from their study over a wide range of wavelengths. An overall comparison of the global properties of X-ray binaries in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds will be given.\n\nThe Magellan Evolution of Galaxies Spectroscopic and Ultraviolet Reference Atlas (MegaSaura).

D.; Chisholm, J.; Dahle, H.; Johnson, T.; Paterno-Mahler, R.; Wuyts, E.; Kelson, D. D.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe introduce Project MEGaSaURA: the Magellan Evolution of Galaxies Spectroscopic and Ultraviolet Reference Atlas. MEGaSaURA comprises medium-resolution, rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopy of N = 15 bright gravitationally lensed galaxies at redshifts of 1.68 < z < 3.6, obtained with the MagE spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes. The spectra cover the observed-frame wavelength range 3200 < Î» o < 8280 Ã the average spectral resolving power is R = 3300. The median spectrum has a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 21 per resolution element at 5000 Ã . As such, the MEGaSaURA spectra have superior S/N and wavelength coverage compared to what COS/HST provides for starburst galaxies in the local universe. This paper describes the sample, the observations, and the data reduction. We compare the measured redshifts for the stars, the ionized gas as traced by nebular lines, and the neutral gas as traced by absorption lines; we find the expected bulk outflow of the neutral gas, and no systemic offset between the redshifts measured from nebular lines and the redshifts measured from the stellar continuum. We provide the MEGaSaURA spectra to the astronomical community through a data release.\n\nFIGGS 2: An HI survey of extremely faint irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPatra, N. N.; Chengalur, J. N.; Karachentsev, I. D.; Sharina, M. E.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nWe present observations and first results from the FIGGS2 survey. FIGGS2 is an extension of the earlier Faint Irregular Galaxies GMRT survey (FIGGS) towards faint luminosity end. The sample consists of 20 galaxies, 15 of which were detected in HI 21 cm line using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The median blue band magnitude of our sample is approximately -11.m 6, which is more than one magnitude fainter than earlier FIGGS survey. From our GMRT observations we found that, for many of our sample galaxies, the HI disks are offset from their optical disks. The HI diameters of the FIGGS2 galaxies show a tight correlation with their HI mass. The slope of the correlation is 2.08 Â± 0.20 similar to what is found for FIGGS galaxies. We also found that for almost all galaxies, the HI disks are larger than the optical disks which is a common trend for dwarf or spiral galaxies. The mean value of the ratio of HI to optical diameter is about 1.54.\n\nThe inclination of the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSÃ¡nchez-Salcedo, F. J.; Hidalgo-GÃ¡mez, A. M.; MartÃ­nez-GarcÃ­a, E. E.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nWe provide constraints on the inclination angle of the H I disk of the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II (Ho II) from a stability analysis of the outer gaseous disk. We point out that a mean inclination angle of 27(Â°) and thus a flat circular velocity of â 60 km s(-1) , is required to have a level of gravitational stability similar to that found in other galaxies. Adopting this inclination angle, we find that Ho II lies on the right location in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Moreover, for this inclination, its rotation curve is consistent with MOND. However, the corresponding analysis of the stability under MOND indicates that this galaxy could be problematic for MOND because its outer parts are marginally unstable in this gravity theory. We urge MOND simulators to study numerically the non-linear stability of gas-rich dwarf galaxies since this may provide a new key test for MOND.\n\nWing galaxies: A formation mechanism of the clumpy irregular galaxy Markarian 297\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTaniguchi, Yoshiaki; Noguchi, Masafumi\n\n1990-01-01\n\nIn order to contribute to an understanding of collision-induced starburst activities, the authors present a detailed case study on the starburst galaxy Markarian 297 (= NGC 6052 = Arp 209; hereafter Mrk 297). This galaxy is classified as a clumpy irregular galaxy (CIG) according to its morphological properties (cf. Heidmann, 1987). Two major clumps and many small clumps are observed in the entire region of Mrk 297 (Hecquet, Coupinot, and Maucherat 1987). The overall morphology of Mrk 297 is highly chaotic and thus it seems difficult to determine possible orbits of galaxy-galaxy collision. However, the authors have serendipitously found a possible orbit during a course of numerical simulations for a radial-penetration collision between galaxies. The radial-penetration collision means that an intruder penetrates a target galaxy radially passing by its nucleus. This kind of collision is known to explain a formation mechanism of ripples around disk galaxies (Wallin and Struck-Marcell 1988). Here, the authors show that the radial-penetration collision between galaxies successfully explains both overall morphological and kinematical properties of Mrk 297. The authors made two kinds of numerical simulations for Mrk 297. One is N-body (1x10(exp 4) particles) simulations in which effects of self gravity of the stellar disk are taken into account. These simulations are used to study detailed morphological feature of Mrk 297. The response of gas clouds are also investigated in order to estimate star formation rates in such collisions. The other is test-particle simulations, which are utilized to obtain a rough picture of Mrk 297 and to analyze the velocity field of Mrk 297. The techniques of the numerical simulations are the same as those in Noguchi (1988) and Noguchi and Ishibashi (1986). In the present model, an intruding galaxy with the same mass of a target galaxy moves on a rectilinear orbit which passes the center of the target.\n\nExploring the Origin of Kinematically Irregular Galaxies with MaNGA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStark, David Vincent; Bundy, Kevin; Westfall, Kyle; Bershady, Matthew; Cheung, Edmond; Soler, Juan; Brinchmann, Jarle; Abraham, Roberto; Bizyaev, Dmitry; Masters, Karen; Weijmans, Anne-Marie; Chen, Yanmei; Jin, Yifei; Drory, Niv; Lopes, Alexandre Roman; Law, David\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDeviations from normal rotation in galaxies may have a number of potential drivers, including tidal interactions, gas inflows/outflows, spiral structure, bar/oval distortions, or other internally generated instabilities. Thanks to new massive IFU surveys like MaNGA, we can now characterize the gas and stellar kinematics of thousands of galaxies in the local universe, enabling statistical analyses on the frequency of disturbed kinematics, their origin, and their impact on their host galaxies. We present a census of kinematics in MaNGA using a modified version of the Radon transform to map radial variations in kinematic position angles (PA). We discuss the frequency of kinematically irregular disks, and describe commonly observed patterns in radial PA profiles. In order to constrain the drivers of these kinematic signatures, we analyze how they correlate with galaxy mass, environment, star formation history, and gas-phase metallicity.\n\nUGC 4703 Interacting Pair Near the Isolated Spiral Galaxy NGC 2718: A Milky Way Magellanic Cloud Analog\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaudel, Sanjaya; Sengupta, C.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe present an analysis of physical and morphological properties of an interacting pair of dwarf galaxies, UGC 4703, located in the vicinity of an isolated Milky Way (MW) type spiral galaxy NGC 2718. Based on the comparison of physical and morphological properties with that of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), we report that the UGC 4703 pair-NGC 2718 system is probably an LMC-SMC-MW analog. Located at a sky-projected distance of 81 kpc from NGC 2718, we find that UGC 4703 is clearly interacting with its nearby lower-mass companion UGC 4703B, forming a bridge of stellar stream between them. Total B-band luminosity of UGC 4703 and its companion is -17.75 and -16.25 mag, respectively. We obtained H I 21 cm line data of UGC 4703 using the GMRT to get a more detailed view of neutral hydrogen (H I) emission. The H I image revealed evidence of interaction between the dwarf galaxy pair but no extended emission, such as the Magellanic Stream. We also detected star-forming regions along the UGC 4703/4703B bridge with stellar mass exceeding 107 M â. While comparing the optical and H I morphology of the interacting dwarf pairs (UGC 4703-4703B and LMC-SMC), we discuss possible differences in interaction histories of these systems.\n\nIUE observations of luminous blue star associations in irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLamb, S.

The spectra indicate that the massive star content is similar in these regions and is best fit by massive stars formed in a burst and now approximately 2.5 to 3.0 million years old.\n\nOld Stellar Populations as Structural Tracer of the Magellanic Cloud Complex\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaha, A.; Olszewski, E. W.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nWe present results from the the NOAO Outer Limits Survey (OLS) in the context of the new paradigm that the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are approaching the Galaxy for the first time, and are not, as previously thought, orbiting quasi-periodically. The OLS identifies old and intermediate stellar populations associated with the LMC and SMC to unprecedented distances outside these galaxies. The distribution of these older stars are a fossil record of the interaction history of both Magellanic Clouds, both between themselves and with the Milky Way. A stable extended disk to beyond 12 scale lengths has been identified in the LMC, which is unlikely to have survived multiple approaches to the Galaxy. An extra-tidal distribution of stars around the SMC, however, are consistent with tidal disruption due to interactions with the LMC. We show that the Magellanic Bridge contains old stars, consistent with it being a tidal feature due to LMC-SMC interaction.\n\nOGLE-ing the Magellanic system: stellar populations in the Magellanic Bridge\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSkowron, D. M.; Jacyszyn, A. M.; Udalski, A.\n\nWe report the discovery of a young stellar bridge that forms a continuous connection between the Magellanic Clouds. This finding is based on number density maps for stellar populations found in data gathered by OGLE-IV that fully cover over 270 deg{sup 2} of the sky in the Magellanic Bridge area. This is the most extensive optical survey of this region to date. We find that the young population is present mainly in the western half of the MBR, which, together with the newly discovered young population in the eastern Bridge, form a continuous stream of stars connecting both galaxies alongmoreÂ Â» Î´ â¼ â73.5 deg. The young population distribution is clumped, with one of the major densities close to the SMC and the other fairly isolated and located approximately mid-way between the Clouds, which we call the OGLE island. These overdensities are well matched by H I surface density contours, although the newly found young population in the eastern Bridge is offset by â¼2 deg north from the highest H I density contour. We observe a continuity of red clump stars between the Magellanic Clouds which represent an intermediate-age population. Red clump stars are present mainly in the southern and central parts of the Magellanic Bridge, below its gaseous part, and their presence is reflected by a strong deviation from the radial density profiles of the two galaxies. This may indicate either a tidal stream of stars, or that the stellar halos of the two galaxies overlap. On the other hand, we do not observe such an overlap within an intermediate-age population represented by the top of the red giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch stars. We also see only minor mixing of the old populations of the Clouds in the southern part of the Bridge, represented by the lowest part of the red giant branch.Â«Â less\n\nPhotometric Metallicities of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiller, Amy Elizabeth\n\n2018-06-01\n\nIn the field of astronomy, the study of galaxies is vitally important to understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. Within the study of galaxies, of particular interest are the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC, respectively), two of the Milky Wayâs closest and most massive satellite galaxies. Their close proximity make them ideal candidates for understanding astrophysical processes such as galaxy interactions. In order to fully understand the Magellanic Clouds, it is imperative that the metallicity of the clouds be mapped in detail. In order to accomplish this task, I will use data from the Survey of Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) which is a deep, multi-band (ugriz) photometric survey of the Magellanic Clouds that contains approximately 400 million objects in 197 fully-calibrated fields. SMASH is an extensive and deep photometric data set that enables the full-scale study of the galactic structure in the Clouds. The SMASH u-band is sensitive to metallicity for main-sequence turn-off stars which we calibrate using SDSS spectroscopy in overlapping regions (mainly standard star fields). The final steps will be to make metallicity maps of the main bodies and peripheries of the LMC and SMC. Ultimately, these metallicity maps will help us trace out population gradients in the Clouds and uncover the origin of their very extended stellar peripheries.\n\nGalaxies clustering around QSOs with z = 0.9-1.5 and the origin of blue field galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHintzen, Paul; Romanishin, W.; Valdes, Francisco\n\n1991-01-01\n\nDeep CCD images were obtained in Mould-Cousins R and I passbands of 16 radio quasars with z values between 0.9 and 1.5 and absolute values of b above 35 deg, chosen from the Veron-Cetty and Veron (1984) catalog. Results indicate that, in this population of radio quasars, there is a statistically significant excess of galaxies within 15 arcsec of the quasars and brighter than R = 23 and I = 22. However, contrary to the report of Tyson (1986), no excess was found of galaxies with R less than 21 lying within 30 arcsec of quasars in this redshift range. Data were also obtained for very blue galaxies seen among objects in the general field, all of which are bluer in R-I than Magellanic irregulars at any redshift less than 3. It is suggested that this population might be comprised of low-redshift low-luminosity (H II region) galaxies of the type studied by French (1980) and/or higher redshift galaxies with strong cooling flows and forbidden O II lines.\n\nLBT/MODS spectroscopy of globular clusters in the irregular galaxy NGC 4449\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAnnibali, F.; Morandi, E.; Watkins, L.

P.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe present intermediate-resolution (R Ë 1000) spectra in the Ë3500-10 000 Ã range of 14 globular clusters in the Magellanic irregular galaxy NGC 4449 acquired with the Multi-Object Double Spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope. We derived Lick indices in the optical and the Ca II triplet index in the near-infrared in order to infer the clusters' stellar population properties. The inferred cluster ages are typically older than Ë9 Gyr, although ages are derived with large uncertainties. The clusters exhibit intermediate metallicities, in the range -1.2 â² [Fe/H] â² -0.7, and typically sub-solar [Î±/Fe] ratios, with a peak at Ë-0.4. These properties suggest that (i) during the first few Gyr NGC 4449 formed stars slowly and inefficiently, with galactic winds having possibly contributed to the expulsion of the Î±-elements, and (ii) globular clusters in NGC 4449 formed relatively `late', from a medium already enriched in the products of Type Ia supernovae. The majority of clusters appear also underabundant in CN compared to Milky Way halo globular clusters, perhaps because of the lack of a conspicuous N-enriched, second generation of stars like that observed in Galactic globular clusters. Using the cluster velocities, we infer the dynamical mass of NGC 4449 inside 2.88 kpc to be M(<2.88 kpc) = 3.15^{+3.16}_{-0.75} Ã 10^9 M_{\\\\odot }. We also report the serendipitous discovery of a planetary nebula within one of the targeted clusters, a rather rare event.\n\nAnalog of the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKohler, Susanna\n\n2017-11-01\n\nA hunt for merging dwarf galaxies has yielded an intriguing result: 180 million light-years away, a galaxy very similar to the Milky Way with two dwarf-galaxy satellites just like our own Magellanic clouds.Unusual SatellitesThe Large and Small Magellanic clouds, as observed from Earth. [ESO/S. Brunier]The Large and Small Magellanic clouds (LMC and SMC), the only bright and star-forming satellite galaxies around the Milky Way, have proven unusual in the universe: satellite pairs of LMCSMC mass are neither common in observation nor typically produced in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.Since the probability of having such an interacting pair of satellites in a massive halo is so low, this raises questions about how our system came about. Did the Magellanic clouds form independently around the Milky Way and then interact? Were they more recently captured as an already-merging pair of dwarf galaxies? Or is there some other explanation?If we could find other systems that look like the LMCSMCMilky-Way system, we might be able to learn more about pairs of dwarf galaxies and how they interact near the halos of large galaxies like the Milky Way. Conveniently, two researchers from Yonsei University in South Korea, Sanjaya Paudel and Chandreyee Sengupta, have now identified exactly such a system.The UGC 4703 pair of dwarf galaxies show a stellar bridge connecting them a sign of their past interaction, when tidal forces stripped material from them as they passed each other. [Adapted from Paudel Sengupta 2017]An Interacting PairHunting for merging dwarf galaxies in various environments, Paudel and Sengupta found UGC 4703, an interacting pair of dwarf galaxies that are located near the isolated spiral galaxy NGC 2718. This pair of satellites around the massive spiral bear a striking resemblance to the LMCSMC system around the Milky-Way.The authors performed a multi-wavelength study of the system using archival images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, The\n\nA Search for Binary Systems in the Magellanic Clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrown, Cody; Nidever, David L.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are two of the closest dwarf galaxies to our Milky Way and offer an excellent laboratory to study the evolution of galaxies. The close proximity of these galaxies provide a chance to study individual stars in detail and learn about stellar properties and galactic formation of the Clouds. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), part of the SDSS-IV, has gathered high quality, multi-epoch, spectroscopic data on a multitude of stars in the Magellanic Clouds. The time-series data can be used to detect and characterize binary stars and make the first spectroscopic measurements of the field binary fraction of the Clouds. I will present preliminary results from this project.\n\nA Study of Two Dwarf Irregular Galaxies with Asymmetrical Star Formation Distributions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHunter, Deidre A.; Gallardo, Samavarti; Zhang, Hong-Xin; Adamo, Angela; Cook, David O.; Oh, Se-Heon; Elmegreen, Bruce G.; Kim, Hwihyun; Kahre, Lauren; Ubeda, Leonardo; Bright, Stacey N.; Ryon, Jenna E.; Fumagalli, Michele; Sacchi, Elena; Kennicutt, R.

We use data on the H I distribution and kinematics and stellar images and colors to examine the properties of the environment in the high star formation rate (HSF) halves of the galaxies in comparison with the low star formation rate halves. We find that the pressure and gas density are higher on the HSF sides by 30%â70%. In addition we find in both galaxies that the H I velocity fields exhibit significant deviations from ordered rotation and there are large regions of high-velocity dispersion and multiple velocity components in the gas beyond the inner regions of the galaxies. The conditions in the HSF regions are likely the result of large-scale external processes affecting the internal environment of the galaxies and enabling the current star formation there.\n\nRadial Color and Mass Profile Trends of Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerrmann, Kimberly A.; Hunter, D. A.; THINGS, LITTLE\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRadial stellar surface brightness (SB) profiles of spiral galaxies can be classified into three types: (I) single exponential, (II) truncated: the light falls off with one exponential out to a break radius and then falls off more steeply, and (III) anti-truncated: the light falls off with one exponential out to a break radius and then falls off less steeply. Stellar SB profile breaks are also found in dwarf disk galaxies, but with an additional sub-category of Type II profiles: (FI) flat-inside: the light is roughly constant or increasing and then falls off beyond a break. Additionally, Bakos, Trujillo, & Pohlen (2008) showed that for spirals, each profile type has a characteristic color trend with respect to the break location which can be combined with color mass-to-light ratio relationships to examine radial mass profiles as well. Here we show radial color and mass profile trends for the three main SB types from a large multi-wavelength photometric study of dwarf irregular galaxies (the 141 dwarf parent sample of the LITTLE THINGS galaxies). We explore the similarities and differences between spirals and dwarfs and also between different colors.\n\nA study of the H I and optical properties of Low Surface Brightness galaxies: spirals, dwarfs, and irregulars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoney, M.; van Driel, W.; Das, M.; Martin, J.-M.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe present a study of the H I and optical properties of nearby (z â¤ 0.1) Low Surface Brightness galaxies (LSBGs). We started with a literature sample of Ë900 LSBGs and divided them into three morphological classes: spirals, irregulars, and dwarfs. Of these, we could use Ë490 LSBGs to study their H I and stellar masses, colours, and colour-magnitude diagrams, and local environment, compare them with normal, High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies and determine the differences between the three morphological classes. We found that LSB and HSB galaxies span a similar range in H I and stellar masses, and have a similar M_{H I}/Mâ-Mâ relationship. Among the LSBGs, as expected, the spirals have the highest average H I and stellar masses, both of about 109.8 Mâ. The LSGBs' (g - r) integrated colour is nearly constant as function of H I mass for all classes. In the colour-magnitude diagram, the spirals are spread over the red and blue regions whereas the irregulars and dwarfs are confined to the blue region. The spirals also exhibit a steeper slope in the M_{H I}/Mâ-Mâ plane. Within their local environment, we confirmed that LSBGs are more isolated than HSB galaxies, and LSB spirals more isolated than irregulars and dwarfs. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical tests on the H I mass, stellar mass, and number of neighbours indicate that the spirals are a statistically different population from the dwarfs and irregulars. This suggests that the spirals may have different formation and H I evolution than the dwarfs and irregulars.\n\nThe Abundances of the Fe Group Elements in Early B Stars in the Magellanic Clouds and Our Galaxy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPeters, Geraldine Joan; Adelman, Saul Joseph\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThe abundances of the Fe-peak elements (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) are of interest as they are important for assessing opacities for stellar evolution calculations, confirming theoretical calculations of explosive nucleosynthesis, and inferring the past history of supernova activity in a galaxy. FUSE FUV spectra of early B stars in the LMC and SMC and HST/STIS FUV/NUV spectra of nearby B stars in our galaxy are analyzed with the Hubeny/Lanz programs TLUSTY/SYNSPEC to determine abundance for the Fe group elements and produce a map of these abundances in the Magellanic Clouds (MC) and Magellanic Bridge (MB). Except for four weak multiplets of Fe III there are no measurable lines from the Fe group in the optical region. The Fe group species found in the FUV spectra of early B stars are primarily in the second stage of ionization. The best set of lines in the FUSE spectral region are Fe III (UV1), V III 1150 Ã , and Cr III 1137 Ã . Analysis of the galactic B stars provides a good assessment of the reliability of the atomic parameters that are used for the MC calculations. Twenty-two early B stars in the MC and MB and five in our galaxy were analyzed. In general the Fe group abundances range from solar to slightly below solar in our region of the galaxy. But in the MCs the abundances of V, Cr, and Fe tend to be significantly lower than the mean metal abundances for the galaxy. Maps of the Fe group abundances and their variations in the LMC and SMC, tracers of recent enrichment of the ISM from supernova activity, are shown. Support from NASA grants NAG5-13212, NNX10AD66G, STScI HST-GO-13346.22, and USCâs Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) program is greatly appreciated.\n\nVenus - Multiple-Floored, Irregular Impact Crater\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n1996-09-26\n\nNASA' sMagellan imaged this multiple-floored, irregular impact crater at latitude 16.4 degrees north, longitude 352.1 degrees east, during orbits 481 and 482 on 27 September 1990. This crater, about 9.2 kilometers in maximum diameter, was formed on what appears to be a slightly fractured, radar-dark (smooth) plain. The abundant, low viscosity flows associated with this cratering event have, however, filled local, fault-controlled troughs (called graben). These shallow graben are well portrayed on this Magellan image but would be unrecognizable but for their coincidental infilling by the radar-bright crater flows. This fortuitous enhancement by the crater flows of fault structures that are below the resolution of the Magellan synthetic aperture radar is providing the Magellan Science Team with valuable geologic information. The flow deposits from the craters are thought to consist primarily of shock melted rock and fragmented debris resulting from the nearly simultaneous impacts of two projectile fragments into the hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit) surface rocks of Venus. The presence of the various floors of this irregular crater is interpreted to be the result of crushing, fragmentation, and eventual aerodynamic dispersion of a single entry projectile during passage through the dense Venusian atmosphere. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00462\n\nPhysical properties and evolution of GMCs in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOnishi, Toshikazu\n\n2015-08-01\n\nMost stars are born as clusters in Giant Molecular Clouds (hereafter GMCs), and therefore the understanding of the evolution of GMCs in a galaxy is one of the key issues to investigate the evolution of the galaxy. The recent state-of-the-art radio telescopes have been enabling us to reveal the distribution of GMCs extensively in the Galaxy as well as in the nearby galaxies, and the physical properties and the evolution of the GMCs leading to cluster formations are actively being investigated. Here we present a review of studies of spatially resolved GMCs in the Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming at providing a template of GMC properties. For the Galactic GMCs, we will focus on the recent extensive survey of GMCs along the Galactic plane; the recent studies suggest cloud-cloud collision as mechanism of massive star formation. For the extra galactic GMCs, we will present recent high-resolution observations of GMCs in the LMC.The LMC is among the nearest star-forming galaxy (distance ~ 50kpc) and is almost face-on. From these aspects, it is becoming the most popular region for studying interstellar medium over an entire galaxy. For molecular gas, the NANTEN covered the entire LMC with a spatial resolution of 40 pc, revealing 272 molecular clouds whose mass ranges from ~104 to ~107 Mâ, which is the first uniform sample of GMCs in a single galaxy. Our Spitzer SAGE and Herschel HERITAGE surveys show that the interstellar medium has much smaller scale structures; full of filamentary and shell-like structures. In order to resolve the filamentary distributions and pre-stellar cores we definitely need to resolve clouds at sub-pc resolutions with ALMA and to cover regions of active cluster formation which are to be selected based on the Spitzer and Hershel data. Our ALMA targets in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 include N159, which is the most intense and concentrated molecular cloud as shown by the brightest CO J=3-2 source in the LMC, and GMCs with different\n\nWhat's Old is New in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2006-01-01\n\n[figure removed for brevity, see original site] Poster Version Large Magellanic Cloud This vibrant image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shows the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to our own Milky Way galaxy. The infrared image, a mosaic of 300,000 individual tiles, offers astronomers a unique chance to study the lifecycle of stars and dust in a single galaxy. Nearly one million objects are revealed for the first time in this Spitzer view, which represents about a 1,000-fold improvement in sensitivity over previous space-based missions. Most of the new objects are dusty stars of various ages populating the Large Magellanic Cloud; the rest are thought to be background galaxies. The blue color in the picture, seen most prominently in the central bar, represents starlight from older stars. The chaotic, bright regions outside this bar are filled with hot, massive stars buried in thick blankets of dust. The red color around these bright regions is from dust heated by stars, while the red dots scattered throughout the picture are either dusty, old stars or more distant galaxies. The greenish clouds contain cooler interstellar gas and molecular-sized dust grains illuminated by ambient starlight. Astronomers say this image allows them to quantify the process by which space dust -- the same stuff that makes up planets and even people -- is recycled in a galaxy. The picture shows dust at its three main cosmic hangouts: around the young stars, where it is being consumed (red-tinted, bright clouds); scattered about in the space between stars (greenish clouds); and in expelled shells of material from old stars (randomly-spaced red dots). The Large Magellanic Cloud, located 160,000 light-years from Earth, is one of a handful of dwarf galaxies that orbit our own Milky Way. It is approximately one-third as wide as the Milky Way, and, if it could be seen in its entirety, would cover the same amount of sky as a grid of about 480 full moons\n\nOGLE ATLAS OF CLASSICAL NOVAE. II. MAGELLANIC CLOUDS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMrÃ³z, P.; Udalski, A.; Poleski, R.\n\n2016-01-15\n\nThe population of classical novae in the Magellanic Clouds was poorly known because of a lack of systematic studies. There were some suggestions that nova rates per unit mass in the Magellanic Clouds were higher than in any other galaxy. Here, we present an analysis of data collected over 16 years by the OGLE survey with the aim of characterizing the nova population in the Clouds. We found 20 eruptions of novae, half of which are new discoveries. We robustly measure nova rates of 2.4Â Â±Â 0.8 yr{sup â1} (LMC) and 0.9Â Â±Â 0.4 yr{sup â1} (SMC) and confirm that the K-band luminosity-specific novamoreÂ Â» rates in both Clouds are 2â3 times higher than in other galaxies. This can be explained by the star formation history in the Magellanic Clouds, specifically the re-ignition of the star formation rate a few Gyr ago. We also present the discovery of the intriguing system OGLE-MBR133.25.1160, which mimics recurrent nova eruptions.Â«Â less\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: LITTLE THINGS dwarf irregular galaxies FUV regions (Hunter+, 2016)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHunter, D. A.; Elmegreen, B. G.; Gehret, E.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe sample of galaxies is taken from LITTLE THINGS (Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey, Hunter et al. 2012, J/AJ/144/134). This is a multi-wavelength survey of nearby (<10.3 Mpc) dIrr galaxies and BCDs, which builds on the THINGS project, whose emphasis was on nearby spirals (Walter et al. 2008, J/AJ/136/2563). The galaxies and a few key parameters are listed in Table 1. We used FUV (1516 Ã ) images obtained by GALEX (Melena et al. 2009, J/AJ/138/1203; Hunter et al. 2010AJ....139..447H, 2011AJ....142..121H; Zhang et al. 2012AJ....143...47Z) to identify knots of emission in the outer disks of each galaxy. In order to better distinguish knots from the wide-spread diffuse emission, we subtracted the stellar continuum from each FUV image using the V-band image.

Being an isolated dwarf, as opposed to the dwarfs around the Milky Way, it is likely to be subjected to fewer strong environmental effects. As a result, it serves as a good prototype for the study of the structure and evolution of dwarf galaxies. We present g- and i- band photometry from deep imaging of four fields around IC1613, that resolved stars up to ~ 4 magnitudes fainter than the tip of the RGB. This photometry was obtained using Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) on the Subaru Telescope. The large (1.5o) field-of-view of HSC provides us with a unique opportunity to study the wide-field structure of this dwarf galaxy. This project explores the structure of IC1613 to radii of about ~ 25 kpc using different types of stellar tracers. The aim is to search for evidence of a stellar halo or stellar over-densities around IC1613. The relative contributions of the different stellar populations as a function of position in IC1613 are also shown.\n\nThe Distribution and Ages of Star Clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud: Constraints on the Interaction History of the Magellanic Clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBitsakis, Theodoros; GonzÃ¡lez-LÃ³pezlira, R. A.; Bonfini, P.; Bruzual, G.; Maravelias, G.; Zaritsky, D.; Charlot, S.; RamÃ­rez-Siordia, V. H.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe present a new study of the spatial distribution and ages of the star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). To detect and estimate the ages of the star clusters we rely on the new fully automated method developed by Bitsakis et al. Our code detects 1319 star clusters in the central 18 deg2 of the SMC we surveyed (1108 of which have never been reported before). The age distribution of those clusters suggests enhanced cluster formation around 240 Myr ago. It also implies significant differences in the cluster distribution of the bar with respect to the rest of the galaxy, with the younger clusters being predominantly located in the bar. Having used the same setup, and data from the same surveys as for our previous study of the LMC, we are able to robustly compare the cluster properties between the two galaxies. Our results suggest that the bulk of the clusters in both galaxies were formed approximately 300 Myr ago, probably during a direct collision between the two galaxies. On the other hand, the locations of the young (â¤50 Myr) clusters in both Magellanic Clouds, found where their bars join the H I arms, suggest that cluster formation in those regions is a result of internal dynamical processes. Finally, we discuss the potential causes of the apparent outside-in quenching of cluster formation that we observe in the SMC. Our findings are consistent with an evolutionary scheme where the interactions between the Magellanic Clouds constitute the major mechanism driving their overall evolution.\n\nOn a connection between supernova occurrence and tidal interaction in early type galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKochhar, R. K.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThere are three types of supernovae: two subtypes SNIa and Ib; and SNII. Late type galaxies produce all types of SN, whereas early types (E, SO, and non-Magellanic irregulars IO) have hosted only SNIa. The recently identified SNIb, like SNII, have massive stars as their progenitors. Reviving Oemler and Tinsley's (1979) suggestion that SNIa also come from short-lived stars, the author asserts that they need not occur in all early-type galaxies. SNIa occur only in those galaxies that have access to gas and can form stars in their main body. (SN in nuclear regions are a different matter altogether). In this model, SNIa are not associated with typical stellar population of E/SOs but with regions of localized star formation. Note that data on SNIa from spirals is already consistent with this model.\n\nCCD photometry of Andromeda IV - Dwarf irregular galaxy or M31 open cluster?\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJones, Joseph H.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nCCD photometry of Andromeda IV was obtained during discretionary time in August of 1989 at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea and the data were reduced at CFHT during the summer of 1991. And IV has been catalogued both as a dwarf galaxy and as an open star cluster in M31. The color-magnitude diagrams presented indicate that this object has a young population of stars with a narrow age range, consistent with the characteristics of an open star cluster or stellar association. A radial velocity measurement taken from the literature and analyzed with respect to the rotation curve of M31 indicates this object resides in the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy, strengthening the conclusion that it is indeed a very large open star cluster or a densely populated stellar association rather than a dwarf irregular galaxy.\n\nLuminous clusters of Wolf-Rayet stars in the SBmIII galaxy NGC 4214\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSargent, Wallace L. W.; Filippenko, Alexei V.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nObservations are reported of strong broad emission lines attributed to WR stars in the spectra of several bright knots in the nearby Magellanic irregular galaxy NGC 4214 (classified as type SBmIII), in addition to the emission produced by the more prevalent WN stars). Data are presented on measurements of the line fluxes, the line equivalent widths, and continuum flux densities in the four observed knots, showing that the strongest WR lines generally appear in knots having the most luminous stellar continuum. The significance of this observation is discussed.\n\nON THE STAR FORMATION LAW FOR SPIRAL AND IRREGULAR GALAXIES\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nElmegreen, Bruce G., E-mail: bge@us.ibm.com\n\n2015-12-01\n\nA dynamical model for star formation on a galactic scale is proposed in which the interstellar medium is constantly condensing to star-forming clouds on the dynamical time of the average midplane density, and the clouds are constantly being disrupted on the dynamical timescale appropriate for their higher density. In this model, the areal star formation rate scales with the 1.5 power of the total gas column density throughout the main regions of spiral galaxies, and with a steeper power, 2, in the far outer regions and in dwarf irregular galaxies because of the flaring disks. At the same time, theremoreÂ Â» is a molecular star formation law that is linear in the main and outer parts of disks and in dIrrs because the duration of individual structures in the molecular phase is also the dynamical timescale, canceling the additional 0.5 power of surface density. The total gas consumption time scales directly with the midplane dynamical time, quenching star formation in the inner regions if there is no accretion, and sustaining star formation for â¼100 Gyr or more in the outer regions with no qualitative change in gas stability or molecular cloud properties. The ULIRG track follows from high densities in galaxy collisions.Â«Â less\n\nA Cosmic Zoo in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2010-06-01\n\nAstronomers often turn their telescopes to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), one of the closest galaxies to our own Milky Way, in their quest to understand the Universe. In this spectacular new image from the Wide Field Imager (WFI) at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile, a celestial menagerie of different objects and phenomena in part of the LMC is on display, ranging from vast globular clusters to the remains left by brilliant supernovae explosions. This fascinating observation provides data for a wide variety of research projects unravelling the life and death of stars and the evolution of galaxies. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is only about 160 000 light-years from our own Milky Way - very close on a cosmic scale. This proximity makes it a very important target as it can be studied in far more detail than more distant systems. The LMC lies in the constellation of Dorado (the Swordfish), deep in the southern sky and well placed for observations from ESO's observatories in Chile. It is one of the galaxies forming the Local Group surrounding the Milky Way [1]. Though enormous on a human scale, the LMC is less than one tenth the mass of our home galaxy and spans just 14 000 light-years compared to about 100 000 light-years for the Milky Way. Astronomers refer to it as an irregular dwarf galaxy [2]. Its irregularity, combined with its prominent central bar of stars suggests to astronomers that tidal interactions with the Milky Way and fellow Local Group galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud, could have distorted its shape from a classic barred spiral into its modern, more chaotic form. This image is a mosaic of four pictures from the Wide Field Imager on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The image covers a region of sky more than four times as large as the full Moon. The huge field of view of this camera makes it possible to see a very wide range of objects in the LMC in a single picture, although only a small part of the entire\n\nDWARF IRREGULAR GALAXY LEO A: SUPRIME-CAM WIDE-FIELD STELLAR PHOTOMETRY\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStonkutÄ, Rima; Narbutis, Donatas; VanseviÄius, Vladas\n\n2014-10-01\n\nWe have surveyed a complete extent of Leo Aâan apparently isolated gas-rich low-mass dwarf irregular galaxy in the Local Group.

The wide-field (20' Ã 24') photometry catalog of 38,856 objects (V â¼ 16-26 mag) is presented.

Because they are nearby, the Clouds are well suited to careful examination by measurement of resolved stellar populations and other techniques, yet the scientific under- standing of the Clouds is only beginning to come into focus. Now, study of the Magellanic Clouds is particularly timely, in part because of the recent realization that the Clouds are only recently entering the halo of the Milky Way. Close examination of the structure and history of the Clouds has the potential to offer insights in the nature of hierarchical merging of galaxies, and study of the dynamics of the MCs and their passage through the halo of the Galaxy may yield hints about the nature of the dark matter halos generally, currently an important area of research in astronomy. The Clouds present a unique opportunity for study of stellar populations, because they are near enough that individual stars can be re- solved to depths well past the main sequence turnoff. This permits analysis of stellar age and metallicity with common distance determinable by independent means. In 2005 - 2011, Saha et al. conducted observations for the Outer Limits Survey (OLS) of the Magellanic Clouds, an extensive survey designed to probe the outskirts of these galaxies to fainter limits than any previous survey. In collaboration with the OLS team I have developed methodology for obtaining high precision photometry from OLS data, and deriving star formation history and age-metallicity relations from the measurements. Detailed determination of the star formation history and age-metallicity relation in these fields requires synthesis of artificial stars and CMD fitting, and these processes will be discussed in this thesis. I present the star formation history of fields in the OLS project and confront predictions from current models of the Magellanic System.\n\nThe Most Metal-poor Stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchlaufman, Kevin C.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe chemical abundances of the most metal-poor stars in a galaxy can be used to investigate the earliest stages of its formation and chemical evolution. Differences between the abundances of the most metal-poor stars in the Milky Way and in its satellite dwarf galaxies have been noted and provide the strongest available constraints on the earliest stages of general galactic chemical evolution models. However, the masses of the Milky Way and its satellite dwarf galaxies differ by four orders of magnitude, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the early chemical evolution of intermediate mass galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds. To close that gap, we have initiated a survey of the metal-poor stellar populations of the Magellanic Clouds using the mid-infrared metal-poor star selection of Schlaufman & Casey (2014). We have discovered the three most metal-poor giant stars known in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and reobserved the previous record holder. The stars have metallicities in the range -2.70 < [Fe/H] < -2.00 and three show r-process enhancement: one has [Eu II/Fe] = +1.65 and two others have [Eu II/Fe] = +0.65. The probability that four randomly selected very metal-poor stars in the halo of the Milky Way are as r-process enhanced is 0.0002. For that reason, the early chemical enrichment of the heaviest elements in the LMC and Milky Way were qualitatively different. It is also suggestive of a possible chemical link between the LMC and the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies nearby with evidence of r-process enhancement (e.g., Reticulum II and Tucana III). Like Reticulum II, the most metal-poor star in our LMC sample is the only one not enhanced in r-process elements.\n\nA Neighboring Dwarf Irregular Galaxy Hidden by the Milky Way\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMassey, Philip; Henning, P. A.; Kraan-Korteweg, R. C.\n\n2003-11-01\n\nWe have obtained VLA and optical follow-up observations of the low-velocity H I source HIZSS 3 discovered by Henning et al. and Rivers in a survey for nearby galaxies hidden by the disk of the Milky Way. Its radio characteristics are consistent with this being a nearby (~1.8 Mpc) low-mass dwarf irregular galaxy (dIm). Our optical imaging failed to reveal a resolved stellar population but did detect an extended HÎ± emission region. The location of the HÎ± source is coincident with a partially resolved H I cloud in the 21 cm map. Spectroscopy confirms that the HÎ± source has a similar radial velocity to that of the H I emission at this location, and thus we have identified an optical counterpart. The HÎ± emission (100 pc in diameter and with a luminosity of 1.4Ã1038 ergs s-1) is characteristic of a single H II region containing a modest population of OB stars. The galaxy's radial velocity and distance from the solar apex suggests that it is not a Local Group member, although a more accurate distance is needed to be certain. The properties of HIZSS 3 are comparable to those of GR 8, a nearby dIm with a modest amount of current star formation. Further observations are needed to characterize its stellar population, determine the chemical abundances, and obtain a more reliable distance estimate.\n\nWhat Old is New in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2006-09-01\n\nThis vibrant image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shows the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to our own Milky Way galaxy. The infrared image, a mosaic of 300,000 individual tiles, offers astronomers a unique chance to study the lifecycle of stars and dust in a single galaxy. Nearly one million objects are revealed for the first time in this Spitzer view, which represents about a 1,000-fold improvement in sensitivity over previous space-based missions. Most of the new objects are dusty stars of various ages populating the Large Magellanic Cloud; the rest are thought to be background galaxies. The blue color in the picture, seen most prominently in the central bar, represents starlight from older stars. The chaotic, bright regions outside this bar are filled with hot, massive stars buried in thick blankets of dust. The red color around these bright regions is from dust heated by stars, while the red dots scattered throughout the picture are either dusty, old stars or more distant galaxies. The greenish clouds contain cooler interstellar gas and molecular-sized dust grains illuminated by ambient starlight. Astronomers say this image allows them to quantify the process by which space dust -- the same stuff that makes up planets and even people -- is recycled in a galaxy. The picture shows dust at its three main cosmic hangouts: around the young stars, where it is being consumed (red-tinted, bright clouds); scattered about in the space between stars (greenish clouds); and in expelled shells of material from old stars (randomly-spaced red dots). The Large Magellanic Cloud, located 160,000 light-years from Earth, is one of a handful of dwarf galaxies that orbit our own Milky Way. It is approximately one-third as wide as the Milky Way, and, if it could be seen in its entirety, would cover the same amount of sky as a grid of about 480 full moons. About one-third of the entire galaxy can be seen in the Spitzer image. This picture is a composite of infrared\n\nChemical Abundances and Physical Parameters of H II Regions in the Magellanic Clouds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReyes, R. E.
