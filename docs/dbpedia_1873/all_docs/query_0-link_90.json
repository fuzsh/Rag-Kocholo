        "text": "Hi all\n\nLast friday my wife Conchi and me enjoyed an humid but decently dark (21.6 SQM) observing night at our observatory in La Alcarria region, about 150 Km NE from Madrid, Spain.\n\nAfter observing with the 24\" f/4 several well known galaxies the first night hours, it was time to try some more challenging deep sky objects. My planetary software (SkyMap 11) showed a pretty DSS image of MCG-01-24-001, a galaxy in Hydra.\n\nMCG-01-24-001.jpg\n\nAt first, I thought it was a mislabeling in the software, since such bright galaxy deserves a NGC entry but, when the telescope aimed at the correct coordinates, the field showed a bright 9mag star in the center, so that it was clear that the relative bright galaxy was almost fully obscured into the star glare.\n\nDirect vision throught an Ethos 13 (220x) hardly ever shows a very faint asymmetrical halo around the star; with averted vision, the galaxy appears easily as a luminous band 6' long just over the star. Changing between DV and AV makes the galaxy blinks as the well known Cygnus planetary; a very curious \"Blinking Galaxy\".\n\nThe second faint object was UGC 5373, the Sextan's Dwarf.\n\nUGC5373.jpg\n\nIn this case the DSS image shows what you get at the eyepiece: a very faint glow, but several faint knots were detected at the very vision limit. Indeed, Sextan's Dwarf looks me more like a faint Palomar cluster than a galaxy.\n\nIf any of you have seen these galaxies, what is your impression about their blinking and globular appearance?\n\nI didn't notice a blinking effect with UGCA 150 = MCG-01-24-001, but it's still a cool galaxy\n\n18\" (2/23/06): this unusual galaxy appears as a fairly faint edge-on oriented SW-NE, ~2.0'x0.4'. Mag 9.0 HD 78953 is strikingly superimposed just southwest of the center and detracts from viewing. Still, the galaxy is easily visible as a fairly faint streak extending mostly to the NE of the star! A 13\" pair of mag of 14/15 stars is superimposed on the NE extension. Located 19' ESE of mag 5.5 20 Hydrae.\n\nI can see the see the similarity, though, with UGC 5373 and a low surface brightness globular cluster.\n\n18\" (2/19/09): easily visible at 175x as a large, low surface brightness, oval patch, extended 3:2 NW-SE, ~3.0'x1.9'. The glow is nearly parallel to two mag 13 stars off the NE side and extends roughly the separation of these stars (3'). This dwarf galaxy has only a broad, weak concentration with a slightly brighter core and an ill-defined edge to the halo as it fades at the periphery. Still, the surface brightness is slightly irregular with a hint of mottling. Located 8' NE of mag 7.7 HD 86610."
