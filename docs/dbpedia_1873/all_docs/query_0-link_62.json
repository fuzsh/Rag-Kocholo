        "text": "IC 549 is a Irregular Galaxy in the Sextans constellation. IC 549 is situated close to the celestial equator and, as such, it is at least partly visible from both hemispheres in certain times of the year. Given its B magnitude of 14.8, IC 549 is visible with the help of a telescope having an aperture of 20 inches (500mm) or more.\n\nThe image below is a photograph of IC 549 from the Digitized Sky Survey 2 (DSS2 - see the credits section) taken in the red channel. The area of sky represented in the image is 0.5000x0.5000 degrees (30.00x30.00 arcmins).\n\nCelestial Coordinates\n\nApparent\n\nRight Ascension 09h 41m 59s\n\nDeclination +03° 50’ 49”\n\nHour Angle 04h 28m 32s\n\nSideral Time 14h 10m 31s\n\nJ2000\n\nRight Ascension 09h 40m 42s\n\nDeclination +03° 57’ 35”\n\nFinder Chart\n\nThe simplified sky charts below show the position of IC 549 in the sky. The first chart has a field of view of 60° while the second one has a field of view of 10°.\n\nPhotometric Information\n\nThe following table lists the magnitude of IC 549 in different bands of the electomagnetic spectrum (when available), from the B band (445nm wavelength, corresponding to the Blue color), to the V band ( 551nm wavelength, corresponding to Green/Yellow color), to the J, H, K bands (corresponding to 1220nm, 1630nm, 2190nm wavelengths respectively, which are colors not visible to the human eye).\n\nMagnitude B (Blue, 445nm) 14.8\n\nMagnitude J (IR 1220nm) 13.81\n\nMagnitude H (IR 1630nm) 13.05\n\nMagnitude K (IR 2190nm) 12.54\n\nFor more information about photometry in astronomy, check the photometric system article on Wikipedia.\n\nThe surface brightess reported below is an indication of the brightness per unit of angular area of IC 549.\n\nApparent Size\n\nThe following table reports IC 549 apparent angular size. The green area displayed on top of the DSS2 image of IC 549 is a visual representation of it.\n\nMajor Angular Size 0.6 arcmin\n\nMinor Angular Size 0.37 arcmin\n\nPosition Angle 180°\n\nMorphological Classification\n\nIC 549 - Irregular Galaxy in Sextans is classified as Irregular (I) according to the Hubble and de Vaucouleurs galaxy morphological classification. The diagram below shows a visual representation of the position of IC 549 - Irregular Galaxy in Sextans in the Hubble de Vaucouleurs sequence.\n\nRise and Set Times\n\nToday's IC 549 - Irregular Galaxy in Sextans rise, transit and set times from Greenwich, UK are the following (all times relative to the local timezone Europe/London):"
