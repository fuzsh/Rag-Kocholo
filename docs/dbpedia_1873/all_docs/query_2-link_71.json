        "text": "Irregular Galaxies Are Very Large\n\nTypes Of Irregular Galaxies\n\nIrregular Galaxies Images\n\nAt the other end of the scale, the larger irregulars can be up to 10 kiloparsecs across and contain 10 10 masses of material. Their luminosities range from 10 7 to 10 9 solar, making them generally fainter than. The best known examples of irregular galaxies are the Small and clouds. These are companion galaxies to our own, and can be easily seen at dark sites in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nAstronomers observe galaxies and categorize them according to four different kinds of shapes: elliptical, spiral, barred-spiral, and irregular. In addition to shape, each of the four different galaxy types can be described by other common characteristics. Match the following characteristics with their corresponding galaxy type. Drag the appropriate items to their respective bins.Round, no disk, very little gas and dust, only old stars.Central bulge, flattened disk, spiral arms, gas, dust, young stars.Elongated central structure, flattened disk, spiral arms, gas and dust, young stars.Asymmetric, often with gas, dust, and young stars. Since the time of Hubble, astronomers have learned that the blue color observed in some galaxies is the result of recent star formation. The blue regions can be seen in the following figure, where the color differences are schematically depicted. This interpretation has been confirmed by multiwavelength observations that have revealed the presence of star-forming gas clouds in galaxies hosting newly formed O-and B-type stars.\n\nMiami soccer set for machines. Sort the galaxy types according to their level of star-forming activity. Drag the appropriate items to their respective bins.Elliptical galaxies -Barred-spiral galaxies -Irregular galaxies -Spiral galaxies. Hubble's law is a relationship between galaxy speeds and galaxy distances. This relationship can be shown as a line on a graph of speed versus distance. Each of the following four graphs shows a possible relationship expressing Hubble's law. Rank the graphs based on their predictions of the speed, from fastest to slowest, for a galaxy located 400 million light-years away from Earth.Speed away from Earth (km/s) 30000, Distance from Earth (millions of light-years) 400 -Speed away from Earth (km/s) 30000, Distance from Earth (millions of light-years) 600 -Speed away from Earth (km/s) 20000, Distance from Earth (millions of light-years) 1000 -Speed away from Earth (km/s) 15000, Distance from Earth (millions of light-years) 1200.\n\nThe following four graphs are the same as those from Part D, with each showing a possible relationship for Hubble's law. Rank the graphs based on the prediction they each would make for the current age of the universe, from oldest to youngest.Speed away from Earth (km/s) 15000, Distance from Earth (millions of light-years) 1200 -Speed away from Earth (km/s) 20000, Distance from Earth (millions of light-years) 1000 -Speed away from Earth (km/s) 30000, Distance from Earth (millions of light-years) 600 -Speed away from Earth (km/s) 30000, Distance from Earth (millions of light-years) 400.\n\nImagine that when we looked out into the universe we found that the light from all galaxies was blueshifted (rather than redshifted) and that the light from the most distant galaxies was blueshifted by the greatest amount. Which statement best describes what we would conclude about the motions of galaxies in this case? A) All are moving toward Earth, with nearby galaxies moving faster than distant galaxies. B) All are moving toward Earth, with distant galaxies moving faster than nearby galaxies. C) All are moving away from Earth, with nearby galaxies moving faster than distant galaxies. D) All are moving away from Earth, with distant galaxies moving faster than nearby galaxies.\n\nThe age of the universe is related to the slope of the graph of Hubble's law, and current data put the age of the universe at about 14 billion years. Suppose that future observations showed that the slope of Hubble's law on the graph is actually steeper than that shown. In that case, the age of the universe would be than 14 billion years because the universe is expanding than current data suggest.\n\n(Each choice gives words to fill in the two blanks, separated by a slash.) A) younger / more rapidly B) younger / more slowly C) older / more rapidly D) older / more slowly. Active galactic nuclei can produce electromagnetic radiation from low-frequency radio wavelengths to high-frequency X-ray wavelengths.\n\nSome of this radiation comes from 'thermal' sources involving material that has been heated to some characteristic temperature. Other radiation comes from 'nonthermal' sources involving charged particles spiraling around magnetic field lines at speeds close to the speed of light. Here, the radiation that is emitted has nothing to do with the temperature of the source.\n\nScientists have been able to reproduce this latter type of radiation in particle accelerators known as synchrotrons. For this reason, nonthermal radiation is often called 'synchrotron radiation.' Identify which emission properties relate to thermal and synchrotron (nonthermal) radiation. Drag the appropriate labels to their respective targets.Thermal -Synchrotron 1. Radiation peaks at a characteristic frequency. Radiation is consistently stronger at lower frequency (longer wavelength). Radiation depends on the temperature of the source.\n\nRadiation depends on the presence of magnetic fields.\n\nStellar systems that are distinguished from spiral or elliptical galaxies by their lack of orderly structure and their patchy shape. Sometimes irregular galaxies that are amorphous and have no clear form are encountered. These consist of stars and dust, whereas the majority of irregular galaxies also contain gas and a large number of very bright, hot blue giants. Clusters of the latter create the appearance of patchiness. There are irregular galaxies that have traces of spiral structure, in particular, the stellar systems closest to our galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds. Only a small number of galaxies are irregular.

These galaxies have little symmetry in their structure and are termed irregular galaxies (abbreviated Irr). Properties of Irregular Galaxies Irregular galaxies contain 10 8-10 10 solar masses, have diameters from 1-10 kpc, and absolute blue magnitudes -13 to -20. Thus, they are often faint and hard to see relative to the brighter spirals and elliptical galaxies.\n\nIrregular galaxies contain both young and old stars, and substantial gas and dust. The fainter irregular galaxies are sometimes called dwarf irregulars. Although dwarf irregulars and dwarf elliptical galaxies are very difficult to see because they are so faint, we have reason to believe that they may be the most common types of galaxies in the Universe. Example: The Magellanic Clouds Two of the best known irregular galaxies are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (often designated as the LMC and SMC, respectively), which are visible to the naked eye as small bright clouds in the Southern Hemisphere sky.\n\nThe LMC and SMC are shown in the top right figure. They get their names because they were observed by Magellan in 1521 while on his voyage around the world. The Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud are satellites of our own galaxy, lying only 50-60 kpc away. In fact, as we note in the right panel, they are sufficiently nearby that they are interacting tidally with the Milky Way. They are much smaller than the Milky Way, with diameters of only several kpc and masses about 100 times smaller for the LMC and 1,000 times smaller for the SMC. Example: Sextans A Another example of an irregular galaxy is Sextans A, shown in the image on the left.\n\nThis irregular galaxy is also a neighbor of our own galaxy, at a distance of only about 10 million light years. The blue regions in the image are clusters of young stars. The brighter stars are in the foreground, much closer to us than Sextans A. They are members of our own Milky Way galaxy. Peculiar Galaxies Hubble's original classification lumped all galaxies that are not spirals or ellipticals into the irregular category.\n\nIt is common today to make further distinction between more 'normal' irregular galaxies and peculiar galaxies, which are galaxies that look unusual in some respect. For example, some peculiar galaxies are objects that have been tidally distorted by interaction with another galaxy. Others are active galaxies with some evidence of violent internal processes taking place. Still others may be more normal galaxies, but given an unusual appearance because of obscuring dust. We shall discuss these special kinds of irregular galaxies separately later.\n\nMost galaxies can be categorized by their shape. Our own Milky Way is a spiral galaxy, for example, and the largest galaxies in the Universe are. But some galaxies defy categorization. These are the irregular galaxies, and each one is unique in shape, age and structure. Irregular galaxies are often chaotic in shape, with no central bulge or spiral arms.\n\nTypes Of Irregular Galaxies\n\nAlthough they used to have a more familiar shape, a dramatic collision with another galaxy has distorted their shape. Astronomers maintain two classifications of irregular galaxies.\n\nIrr-I galaxies have some structure, but they’re still distorted enough that they can’t be classified as spiral, elliptical or lenticular shaped. Irr-II galaxies don’t have any structure at all.\n\nThe nearby Magellanic Clouds were once thought to be irregular galaxies. Although astronomers have detected a faint barred spiral shape. There’s only one irregular galaxy in the Messier catalog of objects, and that’s M82; also known as the Cigar Galaxy. It’s located in the constellation Ursa Major about 12 million light-years away, and is famous for its heavy amounts of star formation.\n\nIrregular Galaxies Images\n\nIn fact, in infrared light, M82 is the brightest galaxy in the sky. Even in visible light, it’s 5 times brighter than the Milky Way. We have written many articles about galaxies for Universe Today. Here’s an article about Hubble’s."
