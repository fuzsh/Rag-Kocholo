        "text": "Wide-Field Structure of Local Group Dwarf Irregular Galaxy IC1613\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPucha, Ragadeepika; Carlin, Jeffrey; Willman, Beth; Sand, David J.; Bechtol, Keith\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIC1613 is a typical dwarf irregular galaxy in the Local Group. Being an isolated dwarf, as opposed to the dwarfs around the Milky Way, it is likely to be subjected to fewer strong environmental effects. As a result, it serves as a good prototype for the study of the structure and evolution of dwarf galaxies. We present g- and i- band photometry from deep imaging of four fields around IC1613, that resolved stars up to ~ 4 magnitudes fainter than the tip of the RGB. This photometry was obtained using Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) on the Subaru Telescope. The large (1.5o) field-of-view of HSC provides us with a unique opportunity to study the wide-field structure of this dwarf galaxy. This project explores the structure of IC1613 to radii of about ~ 25 kpc using different types of stellar tracers. The aim is to search for evidence of a stellar halo or stellar over-densities around IC1613. The relative contributions of the different stellar populations as a function of position in IC1613 are also shown.\n\nHubble Spotlight on Irregular Galaxy\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nThis delicate blue group of stars â actually an irregular galaxy named IC 3583 â sits some 30 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo (The Virgin). It may seem to have no discernable structure, but IC 3583 has been found to have a bar of stars running through its center. These structures are common throughout the Universe, and are found within the majority of spiral, many irregular, and some lenticular galaxies. Two of our closest cosmic neighbors, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, are barred, indicating that they may have once been barred spiral galaxies that were disrupted or torn apart by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way. Researchers at the University of Leicester, England note there are two types of irregular galaxy. Type I's are usually single galaxies of peculiar appearance. They contain a large fraction of young stars, and show the luminous nebulae that are also visible in spiral galaxies. Type II irregulars include the group known as interacting or disrupting galaxies, in which the strange appearance is due to two or more galaxies colliding, merging or otherwise interacting gravitationally. Something similar might be happening with IC 3583. This small galaxy is thought to be gravitationally interacting with one of its neighbors, the spiral Messier 90. Together, the duo form a pairing known as Arp 76. Itâs still unclear whether these flirtations are the cause of IC 3583âs irregular appearance â but whatever the cause, the galaxy makes for a strikingly delicate sight in this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image, glimmering in the blackness of space.

P.; Geha, Marla; JÃ¡chym, Pavel\n\nWe present optical imaging and spectroscopy and H I imaging of the Virgo Cluster galaxy IC 3418, which is likely a 'smoking gun' example of the transformation of a dwarf irregular into a dwarf elliptical galaxy by ram pressure stripping. IC 3418 has a spectacular 17 kpc length UV-bright tail comprised of knots, head-tail, and linear stellar features. The only HÎ± emission arises from a few H II regions in the tail, the brightest of which are at the heads of head-tail UV sources whose tails point toward the galaxy ('fireballs'). Several of the elongated tail sources have HÎ± peaksmoreÂ Â» outwardly offset by â¼80-150 pc from the UV peaks, suggesting that gas clumps continue to accelerate through ram pressure, leaving behind streams of newly formed stars which have decoupled from the gas. Absorption line strengths, measured from Keck DEIMOS spectra, together with UV colors, show star formation stopped 300 Â± 100 Myr ago in the main body, and a strong starburst occurred prior to quenching. While neither HÎ± nor H I emission are detected in the main body of the galaxy, we have detected 4 Ã 10{sup 7} M {sub â} of H I from the tail with the Very Large Array. The velocities of tail H II regions, measured from Keck LRIS spectra, extend only a small fraction of the way to the cluster velocity, suggesting that star formation does not happen in more distant parts of the tail. Stars in the outer tail have velocities exceeding the escape speed, but some in the inner tail should fall back into the galaxy, forming halo streams.Â«Â less\n\nNew CO and H alpha observations of Magellanic-type irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDettmar, Ralf-Jurgen; Becker, Renate; Shaw, Martin\n\nIn order to study the star-forming regions in Magellanic-type irregular galaxies and their relation to molecular cloud complexes, we obtained hydrogen alpha images of several southern objects. In addition, we detected and mapped some of these objects in the J = 1-0 CO line. The weak CO emission of most irregulars made it necessary to integrate for 2-8 hours per position. We describe some preliminary results for IC 4662, DDO 70 (Sex B), and IC 5052.\n\nStar Formation in Irregular Galaxies.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHunter, Deidre; Wolff, Sidney\n\n1985-01-01\n\nExamines mechanisms of how stars are formed in irregular galaxies. Formation in giant irregular galaxies, formation in dwarf irregular galaxies, and comparisons with larger star-forming regions found in spiral galaxies are considered separately.

Our search for extended H I emission revealed a large complex of H I clouds near IC 1459, likely to be the debris from tidal interactions with neighbouring galaxies. The total H I mass (â¼109 Mâ) in the detected clouds spans 250 kpc from the north-east of the gas-rich spiral NGC 7418A to the south-east of IC 1459. The extent and mass of the H I debris, which shows rather irregular morphology and kinematics, are similar to those in other nearby groups. Together with H I clouds recently detected near two other IC 1459 group members, namely IC 5270 and NGC 7418, using phased-array feeds on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the detected debris make up a significant fraction of the group's intergalactic medium.\n\nExploring the making of a galactic wind in the starbursting dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 with LOFAR\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHeesen, V.; Rafferty, D. A.; Horneffer, A.; Beck, R.; Basu, A.; Westcott, J.; Hindson, L.; Brinks, E.; ChyÅ»y, K. T.; Scaife, A. M. M.; BrÃ¼ggen, M.; Heald, G.; Fletcher, A.; Horellou, C.; Tabatabaei, F. S.; Paladino, R.; Nikiel-WroczyÅski, B.; Hoeft, M.; Dettmar, R.-J.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nLow-mass galaxies are subject to strong galactic outflows, in which cosmic rays may play an important role; they can be best traced with low-frequency radio continuum observations, which are less affected by spectral ageing. We present a study of the nearby starburst dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 using observations at 140 MHz with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), at 1580 MHz with the Very Large Array (VLA), and at 6200 MHz with the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg telescope. We find that IC 10 has a low-frequency radio halo, which manifests itself as a second component (thick disc) in the minor axis profiles of the non-thermal radio continuum emission at 140 and 1580 MHz. These profiles are then fitted with 1D cosmic ray transport models for pure diffusion and advection. We find that a diffusion model fits best, with a diffusion coefficient of D = (0.4-0.8) Ã 1026(E/GeV)0.5 cm2 s-1, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than estimates both from anisotropic diffusion and the diffusion length. In contrast, advection models, which cannot be ruled out due to the mild inclination, while providing poorer fits, result in advection speeds close to the escape velocity of â 50 km s- 1, as expected for a cosmic ray-driven wind. Our favoured model with an accelerating wind provides a self-consistent solution, where the magnetic field is in energy equipartition with both the warm neutral and warm ionized medium with an important contribution from cosmic rays. Consequently, cosmic rays can play a vital role for the launching of galactic winds in the disc-halo interface.\n\nGas and Dust Properties in Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJones, A. P.; Madden, S. C.; Colgan, S. W. J.; Geis, N.; Haas, M.; Maloney, P.; Nikola, T.; Poglitsch, A.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe present a study of the 158 (micron)meter [C II] fine structure emission line from a sample of 11 low metallicity irregular galaxies using the NASA Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO). Our preliminary results demonstrate that the ratio of the 158 (micron)meter [C II] emission to the CO-12(1 yields 0) emission ranges from 6,000 to 46,000. These ratios are significantly enhanced relative to clouds within the Galaxy and to normal metallicity galaxies, which typically have values in the range 2,000 to 6,300. We also find that the [C II] emission in dwarf irregular galaxies can be up to 5% of the far-infrared (FIR) emission, a higher fraction of the FIR than in normal metallicity galaxies. We discuss these results for the dwarf irregular galaxies and compare them to those observed in normal metallicity galaxies. The enhanced 158 (micron)meter [C II] emission relative to CO-12(1 yields 0) emission can be understood in terms of the increased penetration depth of ultraviolet (UV) photons into the clouds in low metallicity environments.\n\nX-ray pulsars in nearby irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYang, Jun\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Irregular Galaxy IC 10 are valuable laboratories to study the physical, temporal and statistical properties of the X-ray pulsar population with multi-satellite observations, in order to probe fundamental physics. The known distance of these galaxies can help us easily categorize the luminosity of the pulsars and their age difference can be helpful for for studying the origin and evolution of compact objects. Therefore, a complete archive of 116 XMM-Newton PN, 151 Chandra (Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer) ACIS, and 952 RXTE PCA observations for the pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) were collected and analyzed, along with 42 XMM-Newton and 30 Chandra observations for the Large Magellanic Cloud, spanning 1997-2014. From a sample of 67 SMC pulsars we generate a suite of products for each pulsar detection: spin period, flux, event list, high time-resolution light-curve, pulse-profile, periodogram, and X-ray spectrum. Combining all three satellites, I generated complete histories of the spin periods, pulse amplitudes, pulsed fractions and X-ray luminosities. Many of the pulsars show variations in pulse period due to the combination of orbital motion and accretion torques. Long-term spin-up/down trends are seen in 28/25 pulsars respectively, pointing to sustained transfer of mass and angular momentum to the neutron star on decadal timescales. The distributions of pulse detection and flux as functions of spin period provide interesting findings: mapping boundaries of accretion-driven X-ray luminosity, and showing that fast pulsars (P<10 s) are rarely detected, which yet are more prone to giant outbursts. In parallel we compare the observed pulse profiles to our general relativity (GR) model of X-ray emission in order to constrain the physical parameters of the pulsars.In addition, we conduct a search for optical counterparts to X-ray sources in the local dwarf galaxy IC 10 to form a comparison\n\nExploring Properties of HI Clouds in Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBerger, Clara; Hunter, Deidre Ann\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDwarf Irregular galaxies form stars and maintain exponential stellar disks at extremely low gas densities. One proposed method of maintaining such regular outer disks is scattering stars off of HI clouds. In order to understand the processes present in dwarf irregular stellar disks, we present a survey of atomic hydrogen clouds in and around a subset of representative galaxies from the LITTLE THINGS survey. We apply a cloud identification program to the 21 cm HI line emission cubes and extract masses, radii, surface densities, and distances from the center of the galaxy in the plane of the galaxy of each cloud. Our data show a wide range of clouds characterized by low surface densities but varied in mass and size. The number of clouds found and the mass of the most massive cloud show no correlation to integrated star forming rates or luminosity in these galaxies. However, they will be used as input for models of stars scattering off of HI clouds to better understand the regular stellar disks in dwarf Irregular galaxies.We acknowledge support from the National Science Foundation grant AST-1461200 to Northern Arizona University for Research Experiences for Undergraduates summer internships.\n\nBlue compact dwarfs - Extreme dwarf irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nThuan, Trinh X.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nObservational data on the most extreme members of the irregular dwarf (dI) galaxy class, the blue compact dwarfs (BCDs), are characterized, reviewing the results of recent investigations. The properties of the young stellar population, the ionized gas, the older star population, and the gas and dust of BCDs are contrasted with those of other dIs; BCD morphology is illustrated with sample images; and the value of BCDs (as nearby 'young' chemically unevolved galaxies) for studies of galaxy formation, galactic evolution, and starburst triggering mechanisms is indicated.\n\nIC 5181: An S0 Galaxy with Ionized Gas on Polar Orbits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPizzella, A.; Morelli, L.; Corsini, E. M.; Dalla BontÃ¡, E.; Cesetti, M.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe nearby S0 galaxy IC 5181 is studied to address the origin of the ionized gas component that orbits the galaxy on polar orbit. We perform detailed photometric and spectroscopic observations measuring the surface brightness distribution of the stars (I band), ionized gas of IC 5181 (HÎ± narrow band), the ionized-gas and stellar kinematics along both the major and minor axis, and the corresponding line strengths of the Lick indices. We conclude that the galaxy hosts a geometrically and kinematically decoupled component of ionized gas. It is elongated along the galaxy minor axis and in orthogonal rotation with respect to the galaxy disk. The result is suggesting that the gas component is not related to the stars having an external origin. The gas was accreted by IC 5181 on polar orbits from the surrounding environment.\n\nAGB stars as tracers to IC 1613 evolution.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHashemi, S. A.; Javadi, A.; van Loon, J. Th.\n\nWe are going to apply AGB stars to find star formation history for IC 1613 galaxy; this a new and simple method that works well for nearby galaxies. IC 1613 is a Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy that is located at distance of 750 kpc, a gas rich and isolated dwarf galaxy that has a low foreground extinction. We use the long period variable stars (LPVs) that represent the very final stage of evolution of stars with low and intermediate mass at the AGB phase and are very luminous and cool so that they emit maximum brightness in near-infrared bands. Thus near-infrared photometry with using stellar evolutionary models help us to convert brightness to birth mass and age and from this drive star formation history of the galaxy. We will use the luminosity distribution of the LPVs to reconstruct the star formation history-a method we have successfully applied in other Local Group galaxies. Our analysis shows that the IC 1613 has had a nearly constant star formation rate, without any dominant star formation episode.\n\nGalaxy IC 3639 with Obscured Active Galactic Nucleus\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-01-07\n\nIC 3639, a galaxy with an active galactic nucleus, is seen in this image combining data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory. This galaxy contains an example of a supermassive black hole hidden by gas and dust. Researchers analyzed NuSTAR data from this object and compared them with previous observations from NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory and the Japanese-led Suzaku satellite. The findings from NuSTAR, which is more sensitive to higher energy X-rays than these observatories, confirm the nature of IC 3639 as an active galactic nucleus that is heavily obscured, and intrinsically much brighter than observed. http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA21087\n\nThe remarkable infrared galaxy Arp 220 = IC 4553\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSoifer, B. T.; Neugebauer, G.; Helou, G.; Lonsdale, C. J.; Hacking, P.; Rice, W.; Houck, J. R.; Low, F. J.; Rowan-Robinson, M.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nIRAS observations of the peculiar galaxy Arp 220 = IC 4553 show that it is extremely luminous in the far-infrared, with a total luminosity of 2 x 10 to the 12th solar luminosities. The infrared-to-blue luminosity ratio of this galaxy is about 80, which is the largest value of the ratio for galaxies in the UGC catalog, and places it in the range of the 'unidentified' infrared sources recently reported by Houck et al. in the IRAS all-sky survey. Other observations of Arp 220, combined with the luminosity in the infrared, allow either a Seyfert-like or starburst origin for this luminosity.\n\nWide-field Imaging of the Environments of LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHunter, Deidre A.; Melton, Casey; Leshin, Stephen; Wong, Alson; Clark, Maurice; Kamienski, Jerald; Moriya, Netzer; Packwood, Burley; Birket, Bob; Edwards, William; Millward, Mervyn; Wheelband, Ian\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe have obtained wide-field images of 36 of the 41 LITTLE THINGS (Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey) nearby (<10.3 Mpc) dwarf irregular and blue compact dwarf galaxies. Although the LITTLE THINGS galaxies were chosen to be non-interacting and no companions were found in H I imaging, the purpose of this imaging was to search for optical companion galaxies that had been missed in imaging with smaller fields of view and that might indicate an external factor in ongoing star formation. The limiting magnitudes of the images range from 19.7 to 28.3 mag arcsecâ2, with a median value of 25.9 mag arcsecâ2. We did not find any unknown companions. Two of the LITTLE THINGS galaxies, NGC 4163 and NGC 4214, and the fainter dwarf, UGCA 276, lie potentially within 100 kpc of each other, but our imaging does not reveal any stellar bridge between the galaxies. This project was part of the Lowell Amateur Research Initiative.\n\nStar Formation Histories of Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSkillman, Evan\n\n1995-07-01\n\nWe propose to obtain deep WFPC2 `BVI' color-magnitude diagrams {CMDs} for the dwarf irregular {dI} Local Group galaxies GR 8, Leo A, Pegasus, and Sextans A. In addition to resolved stars, we will use star clusters, and especially any globulars, to probe the history of intense star formation. These data will allow us to map the Pop I and Pop II stellar components, and thereby construct the first detailed star formation histories for non-interacting dI galaxies. Our results will bear on a variety of astrophysical problems, including the evolution of small galaxies, distances in the Local Group, age-metallicity distributions in small galaxies, ages of dIs, and the physics of star formation. The four target galaxies are typical dI systems in terms of luminosity, gas content, and H II region abundance, and represent a range in current star forming activity. They are sufficiently near to allow us to reach to stars at M_V = 0, have 0.1 of the luminosity of the SMC and 0.25 of its oxygen abundance. Unlike the SMC, these dIs are not near giant galaxies. This project will allow the extension of our knowledge of stellar populations in star forming galaxies from the spirals in the Local Group down to its smallest members. We plan to take maximum advantage of the unique data which this project will provide. Our investigator team brings extensive and varied experience in studies of dwarf galaxies, stellar populations, imaging photometry, and stellar evolution to this project.\n\nExtended Schmidt law holds for faint dwarf irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRoychowdhury, Sambit; Chengalur, Jayaram N.; Shi, Yong\n\n2017-12-01\n\nContext. The extended Schmidt law (ESL) is a variant of the Schmidt which relates the surface densities of gas and star formation, with the surface density of stellar mass added as an extra parameter. Although ESL has been shown to be valid for a wide range of galaxy properties, its validity in low-metallicity galaxies has not been comprehensively tested. This is important because metallicity affects the crucial atomic-to-molecular transition step in the process of conversion of gas to stars. Aims: We empirically investigate for the first time whether low metallicity faint dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs) from the local universe follow the ESL. Here we consider the \"global\" law where surface densities are averaged over the galactic discs. dIrrs are unique not only because they are at the lowest end of mass and star formation scales for galaxies, but also because they are metal-poor compared to the general population of galaxies. Methods: Our sample is drawn from the Faint Irregular Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS) which is the largest survey of atomic hydrogen in such galaxies. The gas surface densities are determined using their atomic hydrogen content. The star formation rates are calculated using GALEX far ultraviolet fluxes after correcting for dust extinction, whereas the stellar surface densities are calculated using Spitzer 3.6 Î¼m fluxes. The surface densities are calculated over the stellar discs defined by the 3.6 Î¼m images. Results: We find dIrrs indeed follow the ESL. The mean deviation of the FIGGS galaxies from the relation is 0.01 dex, with a scatter around the relation of less than half that seen in the original relation. In comparison, we also show that the FIGGS galaxies are much more deviant when compared to the \"canonical\" Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Conclusions: Our results help strengthen the universality of the ESL, especially for galaxies with low metallicities. We suggest that models of star formation in which feedback from previous generations\n\nMassive stars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcia, Miriam\n\n2018-02-01\n\nLow metallicity massive stars hold the key to interpret numerous processes in the past Universe including re-ionization, starburst galaxies, high-redshift supernovae, and Î³-ray bursts. The Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy [SagDIG, 12+log(O/H) = 7.37] represents an important landmark in the quest for analogues accessible with 10-m class telescopes. This Letter presents low-resolution spectroscopy executed with the Gran Telescopio Canarias that confirms that SagDIG hosts massive stars. The observations unveiled three OBA-type stars and one red supergiant candidate. Pending confirmation from high-resolution follow-up studies, these could be the most metal-poor massive stars of the Local Group.\n\nA Twisted Star-Forming Web in the Galaxy IC 342\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2011-07-20\n\nLooking like a spider web swirled into a spiral, galaxy IC 342 presents its delicate pattern of dust in this infrared light image from NASA Spitzer Space Telescope. The very center glows especially brightly in the infrared.\n\nMetallicity of Young and Old Stars in Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTikhonov, N. A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBased on archived images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, stellar photometry for 105 irregular galaxies has been conducted. We have shown the red supergiant and giant branches in the obtained Hertzsprung-Russel diagrams. Using the TRGB method, distances to galaxies and metallicity of red giants have been determined. The color index ( V - I) of the supergiant branch at the luminosity level M I = -7 was chosen as the metallicity index of red supergiants. For the galaxies under study, the diagrams have been built, in which the correlation can be seen between the luminosity of galaxies ( M B ) and metallicity of red giants and supergiants. The main source of variance of the results in the obtained diagrams is, in our opinion, uncertainty inmeasurements of galaxy luminosities and star-forming outburst. The relation between metallicity of young and old stars shows that main enrichment of galaxies with metals has taken place in the remote past. Deviations of some galaxies in the obtained relation can possibly be explained with the fall of the intergalactic gas on them, although, this inconsiderably affects metallicities of the stellar content.\n\nChemical evolution in spiral and irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTorres-Peimbert, S.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA brief review of models of chemical evolution of the interstellar medium in our galaxy and other galaxies is presented. These models predict the time variation and radial dependence of chemical composition in the gas as function of the input parameters; initial mass function, stellar birth rate, chemical composition of mass lost by stars during their evolution (yields), and the existence of large scale mass flows, like infall from the halo, outflow to the intergalactic medium or radial flows within a galaxy. At present there is a considerable wealth of observational data on the composition of HII regions in spiral and irregular galaxies to constrain the models. Comparisons are made between theory and the observed physical conditions. In particular, studies of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances are reviewed. In many molecular clouds the information we have on the amount of H2 is derived from the observed CO column density, and a standard CO/H2 ratio derived for the solar neighborhood. Chemical evolution models and the observed variations in O/H and N/O values, point out the need to include these results in a CO/H2 relation that should be, at least, a function of the O/H ratio. This aspect is also discussed.\n\nFIGGS 2: An HI survey of extremely faint irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPatra, N. N.; Chengalur, J. N.; Karachentsev, I. D.; Sharina, M. E.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nWe present observations and first results from the FIGGS2 survey. FIGGS2 is an extension of the earlier Faint Irregular Galaxies GMRT survey (FIGGS) towards faint luminosity end. The sample consists of 20 galaxies, 15 of which were detected in HI 21 cm line using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The median blue band magnitude of our sample is approximately -11.m 6, which is more than one magnitude fainter than earlier FIGGS survey. From our GMRT observations we found that, for many of our sample galaxies, the HI disks are offset from their optical disks. The HI diameters of the FIGGS2 galaxies show a tight correlation with their HI mass. The slope of the correlation is 2.08 Â± 0.20 similar to what is found for FIGGS galaxies. We also found that for almost all galaxies, the HI disks are larger than the optical disks which is a common trend for dwarf or spiral galaxies. The mean value of the ratio of HI to optical diameter is about 1.54.\n\nThe inclination of the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSÃ¡nchez-Salcedo, F.

E.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nWe provide constraints on the inclination angle of the H I disk of the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II (Ho II) from a stability analysis of the outer gaseous disk. We point out that a mean inclination angle of 27(Â°) and thus a flat circular velocity of â 60 km s(-1) , is required to have a level of gravitational stability similar to that found in other galaxies. Adopting this inclination angle, we find that Ho II lies on the right location in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Moreover, for this inclination, its rotation curve is consistent with MOND. However, the corresponding analysis of the stability under MOND indicates that this galaxy could be problematic for MOND because its outer parts are marginally unstable in this gravity theory. We urge MOND simulators to study numerically the non-linear stability of gas-rich dwarf galaxies since this may provide a new key test for MOND.\n\nWing galaxies: A formation mechanism of the clumpy irregular galaxy Markarian 297\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTaniguchi, Yoshiaki; Noguchi, Masafumi\n\n1990-01-01\n\nIn order to contribute to an understanding of collision-induced starburst activities, the authors present a detailed case study on the starburst galaxy Markarian 297 (= NGC 6052 = Arp 209; hereafter Mrk 297). This galaxy is classified as a clumpy irregular galaxy (CIG) according to its morphological properties (cf. Heidmann, 1987). Two major clumps and many small clumps are observed in the entire region of Mrk 297 (Hecquet, Coupinot, and Maucherat 1987). The overall morphology of Mrk 297 is highly chaotic and thus it seems difficult to determine possible orbits of galaxy-galaxy collision. However, the authors have serendipitously found a possible orbit during a course of numerical simulations for a radial-penetration collision between galaxies. The radial-penetration collision means that an intruder penetrates a target galaxy radially passing by its nucleus. This kind of collision is known to explain a formation mechanism of ripples around disk galaxies (Wallin and Struck-Marcell 1988). Here, the authors show that the radial-penetration collision between galaxies successfully explains both overall morphological and kinematical properties of Mrk 297. The authors made two kinds of numerical simulations for Mrk 297. One is N-body (1x10(exp 4) particles) simulations in which effects of self gravity of the stellar disk are taken into account. These simulations are used to study detailed morphological feature of Mrk 297. The response of gas clouds are also investigated in order to estimate star formation rates in such collisions. The other is test-particle simulations, which are utilized to obtain a rough picture of Mrk 297 and to analyze the velocity field of Mrk 297. The techniques of the numerical simulations are the same as those in Noguchi (1988) and Noguchi and Ishibashi (1986). In the present model, an intruding galaxy with the same mass of a target galaxy moves on a rectilinear orbit which passes the center of the target.\n\nExploring the Origin of Kinematically Irregular Galaxies with MaNGA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStark, David Vincent; Bundy, Kevin; Westfall, Kyle; Bershady, Matthew; Cheung, Edmond; Soler, Juan; Brinchmann, Jarle; Abraham, Roberto; Bizyaev, Dmitry; Masters, Karen; Weijmans, Anne-Marie; Chen, Yanmei; Jin, Yifei; Drory, Niv; Lopes, Alexandre Roman; Law, David\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDeviations from normal rotation in galaxies may have a number of potential drivers, including tidal interactions, gas inflows/outflows, spiral structure, bar/oval distortions, or other internally generated instabilities. Thanks to new massive IFU surveys like MaNGA, we can now characterize the gas and stellar kinematics of thousands of galaxies in the local universe, enabling statistical analyses on the frequency of disturbed kinematics, their origin, and their impact on their host galaxies. We present a census of kinematics in MaNGA using a modified version of the Radon transform to map radial variations in kinematic position angles (PA). We discuss the frequency of kinematically irregular disks, and describe commonly observed patterns in radial PA profiles. In order to constrain the drivers of these kinematic signatures, we analyze how they correlate with galaxy mass, environment, star formation history, and gas-phase metallicity.\n\nIdentifying Ranges of Stellar Ages and Metallicities for Blue Supergiants in the Starburst Galaxy IC 10\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBordwell, Baylee; Ho, N.; Geha, M. C.; West, M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDwarf galaxies transition from active star formation to relative quiescence after entering a dense environment such as a galaxy cluster. However, the mechanism behind this change is not fully understood. The problem is complicated by its heavy dependence on the initial conditions of the galaxy in question. To investigate the conditions of a galaxy prior to transition, we chose one of the best and nearest examples of a dwarf with active star formation, the Local Group member IC 10. We have obtained DEIMOS spectra of blue supergiants in this galaxy and determined the range of metallicities and ages for these stars using the equivalent width of the calcium triplet feature and isochrone fitting to photometry. By looking at the distribution of these metallicities in space and time we are able to gain insight into IC 10's recent evolutionary history and to get a clearer picture of the physical state of a dwarf galaxy prior to transition.\n\nIUE observations of luminous blue star associations in irregular galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLamb, S.

The spectra indicate that the massive star content is similar in these regions and is best fit by massive stars formed in a burst and now approximately 2.5 to 3.0 million years old.\n\nThe Evolution of Dwarf-Irregular Galaxy NGC 1569: A Kinematic Study of the Stars and Gas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJohnson, Megan C.\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe evolution and formation of dwarf galaxies has great importance to our knowledge of cosmological history from the Big Bang through the present day structure we observe in our local universe. Dwarf galaxies are believed to be the \"building blocks\" of larger galaxies, which implies that interactions and mergers of these small systems must have occurred frequently in the early universe. There is a population of starburst dwarf irregular (dIm) galaxies that seem to have characteristics indicative of interactions or mergers. One of these dIm galaxies is the nearby post-starburst NGC 1569. This dissertation project explores the stellar and gas kinematics of NGC 1569 as well as examines a deep neutral Hydrogen (HI) map made using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). From these observations, this dissertation analyzes the evolution of NGC 1569 by understanding the three-dimensional shape of this dIm system for the first time. The structure of dIm galaxies is an important fundamental, physical property necessary to understand the evolution and formation of these common systems. However, the intrinsic shape of dIm galaxies remains controversial. Projected minor-to-major axis ratios provide insufficient data to determine the shapes of dIm galaxies. Fortunately, there is another method by which accurate structures can be measured. The stellar velocity dispersion, coupled with the maximum rotational velocity derived from HI observations, gives a measure of how kinematically hot a system is, and, therefore, indicates its structure. In this dissertation, we present the stellar kinematics, including the stellar velocity dispersion, of NGC 1569 obtained using the Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) Mayall 4-m+Echelle spectrograph. These data are combined with an in depth analysis of high resolution HI data and a discussion of the nature of this starburst dwarf system. The dissertation concludes with a deep HI map of NGC 1569 and three of its nearest neighbors in the\n\nA remarkable oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch variable in the Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWhitelock, Patricia A.; Menzies, John W.; Feast, Michael W.; Marigo, Paola\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe report and discuss JHKS photometry for Sgr dIG, a very metal-deficient galaxy in the Local Group, obtained over 3.5 years with the Infrared Survey Facility in South Africa. Three large amplitude asymptotic giant branch variables are identified. One is an oxygen-rich star that has a pulsation period of 950 d, which was until recently undergoing hot bottom burning, with Mbol â¼ -6.7. It is surprising to find a variable of this sort in Sgr dIG, given their rarity in other dwarf irregulars. Despite its long period the star is relatively blue and is fainter, at all wavelengths shorter than 4.5 Î¼m, than anticipated from period-luminosity relations that describe hot bottom burning stars. A comparison with models suggests it had a main-sequence mass Mi â¼ 5 Mâ and that it is now near the end of its asymptotic giant branch evolution. The other two periodic variables are carbon stars with periods of 670 and 503 d (Mbol â¼ -5.7 and -5.3). They are very similar to other such stars found on the asymptotic giant branch of metal-deficient Local Group galaxies and a comparison with models suggests Mi â¼ 3 Mâ. We compare the number of asymptotic giant branch variables in Sgr dIG to those in NGC 6822 and IC 1613, and suggest that the differences may be due to the high specific star formation rate and low metallicity of Sgr dIG.\n\nA Study of Two Dwarf Irregular Galaxies with Asymmetrical Star Formation Distributions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHunter, Deidre A.; Gallardo, Samavarti; Zhang, Hong-Xin; Adamo, Angela; Cook, David O.; Oh, Se-Heon; Elmegreen, Bruce G.; Kim, Hwihyun; Kahre, Lauren; Ubeda, Leonardo; Bright, Stacey N.; Ryon, Jenna E.; Fumagalli, Michele; Sacchi, Elena; Kennicutt, R.

We use data on the H I distribution and kinematics and stellar images and colors to examine the properties of the environment in the high star formation rate (HSF) halves of the galaxies in comparison with the low star formation rate halves. We find that the pressure and gas density are higher on the HSF sides by 30%â70%. In addition we find in both galaxies that the H I velocity fields exhibit significant deviations from ordered rotation and there are large regions of high-velocity dispersion and multiple velocity components in the gas beyond the inner regions of the galaxies. The conditions in the HSF regions are likely the result of large-scale external processes affecting the internal environment of the galaxies and enabling the current star formation there.\n\nRadial Color and Mass Profile Trends of Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerrmann, Kimberly A.; Hunter, D. A.; THINGS, LITTLE\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRadial stellar surface brightness (SB) profiles of spiral galaxies can be classified into three types: (I) single exponential, (II) truncated: the light falls off with one exponential out to a break radius and then falls off more steeply, and (III) anti-truncated: the light falls off with one exponential out to a break radius and then falls off less steeply. Stellar SB profile breaks are also found in dwarf disk galaxies, but with an additional sub-category of Type II profiles: (FI) flat-inside: the light is roughly constant or increasing and then falls off beyond a break. Additionally, Bakos, Trujillo, & Pohlen (2008) showed that for spirals, each profile type has a characteristic color trend with respect to the break location which can be combined with color mass-to-light ratio relationships to examine radial mass profiles as well. Here we show radial color and mass profile trends for the three main SB types from a large multi-wavelength photometric study of dwarf irregular galaxies (the 141 dwarf parent sample of the LITTLE THINGS galaxies). We explore the similarities and differences between spirals and dwarfs and also between different colors.\n\nA study of the H I and optical properties of Low Surface Brightness galaxies: spirals, dwarfs, and irregulars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoney, M.; van Driel, W.; Das, M.; Martin, J.-M.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe present a study of the H I and optical properties of nearby (z â¤ 0.1) Low Surface Brightness galaxies (LSBGs). We started with a literature sample of Ë900 LSBGs and divided them into three morphological classes: spirals, irregulars, and dwarfs. Of these, we could use Ë490 LSBGs to study their H I and stellar masses, colours, and colour-magnitude diagrams, and local environment, compare them with normal, High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies and determine the differences between the three morphological classes. We found that LSB and HSB galaxies span a similar range in H I and stellar masses, and have a similar M_{H I}/Mâ-Mâ relationship. Among the LSBGs, as expected, the spirals have the highest average H I and stellar masses, both of about 109.8 Mâ. The LSGBs' (g - r) integrated colour is nearly constant as function of H I mass for all classes. In the colour-magnitude diagram, the spirals are spread over the red and blue regions whereas the irregulars and dwarfs are confined to the blue region. The spirals also exhibit a steeper slope in the M_{H I}/Mâ-Mâ plane. Within their local environment, we confirmed that LSBGs are more isolated than HSB galaxies, and LSB spirals more isolated than irregulars and dwarfs. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical tests on the H I mass, stellar mass, and number of neighbours indicate that the spirals are a statistically different population from the dwarfs and irregulars. This suggests that the spirals may have different formation and H I evolution than the dwarfs and irregulars.\n\nNew insights into the interstellar medium of the dwarf galaxy IC 10: connection between magnetic fields, the radio-infrared correlation and star formation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBasu, Aritra; Roychowdhury, Sambit; Heesen, Volker; Beck, Rainer; Brinks, Elias; Westcott, Jonathan; Hindson, Luke\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe present the highest sensitivity and angular resolution study at 0.32 GHz of the dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10, observed using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, probing Ë45 pc spatial scales. We find the galaxy-averaged radio continuum spectrum to be relatively flat, with a spectral index Î± = -0.34 Â± 0.01 (SÎ½ â Î½Î±), mainly due to a high contribution from free-free emission. At 0.32 GHz, some of the H II regions show evidence of free-free absorption as they become optically thick below Ë0.41 GHz with corresponding free electron densities of Ë 11-22 cm- 3. After removing the free-free emission, we studied the radio-infrared (IR) relations on 55, 110 and 165 pc spatial scales. We find that on all scales the non-thermal emission at 0.32 and 6.2 GHz correlates better with far-infrared (FIR) emission at 70 Î¼m than mid-IR emission at 24 Î¼m. The dispersion of the radio-FIR relation arises due to variations in both magnetic field and dust temperature, and decreases systematically with increasing spatial scale. The effect of cosmic ray transport is negligible as cosmic ray electrons were only injected â²5 Myr ago. The average magnetic field strength (B) of 12 Î¼G in the disc is comparable to that of large star-forming galaxies. The local magnetic field is strongly correlated with local star formation rate (SFR) as B â SFR0.35 Â± 0.03, indicating a starburst-driven fluctuation dynamo to be efficient (Ë10 per cent) in amplifying the field in IC 10. The high spatial resolution observations presented here suggest that the high efficiency of magnetic field amplification and strong coupling with SFR likely sets up the radio-FIR correlation in cosmologically young galaxies.\n\nThe Nature of Turbulence in the LITTLE THINGS Dwarf Irregular Galaxies\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMaier, Erin; Chien, Li-Hsin; Hollyday, Gigja\n\nWe present probability density functions and higher order (skewness and kurtosis) analyses of the galaxy-wide and spatially resolved distributions of H i column density in the LITTLE THINGS sample of dwarf irregular galaxies. This analysis follows that of Burkhart et al. for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). About 60% of our sample have galaxy-wide values of kurtosis that are similar to that found for the SMC, with a range up to much higher values, and kurtosis increases with integrated star formation rate. Kurtosis and skewness were calculated for radial annuli and for a grid of 32 pixelÂ ÃÂ 32 pixel kernels acrossmoreÂ Â» each galaxy. For most galaxies, kurtosis correlates with skewness. For about half of the galaxies, there is a trend of increasing kurtosis with radius. The range of kurtosis and skewness values is modeled by small variations in the Mach number close to the sonic limit and by conversion of H i to molecules at high column density. The maximum H i column densities decrease with increasing radius in a way that suggests molecules are forming in the weak-field limit, where H{sub 2} formation balances photodissociation in optically thin gas at the edges of clouds.Â«Â less\n\nSolo dwarfs I: survey introduction and first results for the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHiggs, C. R.; McConnachie, A. W.; Irwin, M.; Bate, N. F.; Lewis, G. F.; Walker, M. G.; CÃ´tÃ©, P.; Venn, K.; Battaglia, G.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe introduce the Solitary Local dwarfs survey (Solo), a wide-field photometric study targeting every isolated dwarf galaxy within 3 Mpc of the Milky Way. Solo is based on (u)gi multiband imaging from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam for northern targets, and Magellan/Megacam for southern targets. All galaxies fainter than MV â -18 situated beyond the nominal virial radius of the Milky Way and M31 (â³300 kpc) are included in this volume-limited sample, for a total of 42 targets. In addition to reviewing the survey goals and strategy, we present results for the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy (Sag DIG), one of the most isolated, low-mass galaxies, located at the edge of the Local Group. We analyse its resolved stellar populations and their spatial distributions. We provide updated estimates of its central surface brightness and integrated luminosity, and trace its surface brightness profile to a level fainter than 30 mag arcsec-2. Sag DIG is well described by a highly elliptical (disc-like) system following a single component SÃ©rsic model. However, a low-level distortion is present at the outer edges of the galaxy that, were Sag DIG not so isolated, would likely be attributed to some kind of previous tidal interaction. Further, we find evidence of an extremely low level, extended distribution of stars beyond Ë5 arcmin (>1.5 kpc) that suggests Sag DIG may be embedded in a very low-density stellar halo. We compare the stellar and H I structures of Sag DIG, and discuss results for this galaxy in relation to other isolated, dwarf irregular galaxies in the Local Group.\n\nModeling the spectral energy distribution of the radio galaxy IC310\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFraija, N.; Marinelli, A.; GalvÃ¡n-GÃ¡mez, A.; Aguilar-Ruiz, E.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe radio galaxy IC310 located in the Perseus Cluster is one of the brightest objects in the radio and X-ray bands, and one of the closest active galactic nuclei observed in very-high energies. In GeV - TeV Î³-rays, IC310 was detected in low and high flux states by the MAGIC telescopes from October 2009 to February 2010. Taking into account that the spectral energy distribution (SED) up to a few GeV seems to exhibit a double-peak feature and that a single-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model can explain all of the multiwavelength emission except for the non-simultaneous MAGIC emission, we interpret, in this work, the multifrequency data set of the radio galaxy IC310 in the context of homogeneous hadronic and leptonic models. In the leptonic framework, we present a multi-zone SSC model with two electron populations to explain the whole SED whereas for the hadronic model, we propose that a single-zone SSC model describes the SED up to a few GeVs and neutral pion decay products resulting from pÎ³ interactions could describe the TeV - GeV Î³-ray spectra. These interactions occur when Fermi-accelerated protons interact with the seed photons around the SSC peaks. We show that, in the leptonic model the minimum Lorentz factor of second electron population is exceedingly high Î³e â¼ 105 disfavoring this model, and in the hadronic model the required proton luminosity is not extremely high â¼1044 erg/s, provided that charge neutrality between the number of electrons and protons is given. Correlating the TeV Î³-ray and neutrino spectra through photo-hadronic interactions, we find that the contribution of the emitting region of IC310 to the observed neutrino and ultra-high-energy cosmic ray fluxes are negligible.\n\nFast Outflow of Molecular Gas in the Seyfert Galaxy IC 5063\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorganti, Raffaella; Oosterloo, T.; Oonk, R.; Tadhunter, C.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAGN-driven gas outflows may play an important role in the evolution of galaxies, as they impact on the growth on the central supermassive black hole as well on the star formation of the host galaxy. Much of the detailed physics of these gas outflows, and their actual impact on the host galaxy, is still not well understood. We present a detailed analysis, using ALMA observations, of the radio-jet driven outflow of molecular gas in the nearby radio-loud Seyfert galaxy IC 5063 which allows to derive important physical parameters of the gas and the outflow which, in turn, provide crucial input to numerical models. In recent years, a surprising result in the field of AGN-driven outflows has been that the cold phases of the gas (atomic and molecular) in some galaxies are the massive components of these outflows, despite the huge amounts of energy involved in driving these outflows. However, why most of the outflowing gas should be molecular/atomic, and in general, what are the physical conditions of the gas in the outflows and what really drives them, are still open questions. We present the results obtained from ALMA observations of multiple CO transitions and other molecules of what appears to be a textbook case of a jet-driven multi- phase outflow in the central regions of the Seyfert galaxy IC 5063. The data on multiple transitions allow us to derive the physical conditions in the different regions of the outflowing molecular gas. The signature of the impact of the radio jet is clearly seen in the spatial distribution of the excitation temperature and pressure of the outflowing gas, with the highest excitation and pressure found for the gas with the highest outflow velocities. We obtain a detailed three- dimensional picture of the outflow, and its kinematics, and find that outflowing molecular gas is present across the entire region co-spatial with the radio plasma, providing unambiguous evidence that the radio jets/cocoon are responsible for the outflow.

We want to take advantage of the revolutionary capabilities of the Herschel Space Observatory and the special geometry of edge-on spiral galaxies to derive accurate gas and dust mass profiles in the edge-on spiral galaxy IC2531, the only southern galaxy from a sample of large edge-on spirals observed with Herschel. We already have a wealth of ancillary data and detailed radiative transfer modelling at our disposal for this galaxy, and now request CO observations to map the molecular gas distribution. With our combined dataset, we will investigate the radial behaviour of the gas-to-dust ratio, compare it with the properties of the stellar population and the dark matter distribution, and test the possibility to use the far-infrared emission from dust to determine the total ISM mass in galaxies.\n\nThe H I chronicles of little things BCDs II: The origin of IC 10's H I structure\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAshley, Trisha; Simpson, Caroline E.; Pokhrel, Nau Raj\n\nIn this paper we analyze Very Large Array (VLA) telescope and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) atomic hydrogen (H I) data for the LITTLE THINGS (Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey; https://science.nrao.edu/science/surveys/littlethings) blue compact dwarf galaxy IC 10. The VLA data allow us to study the detailed H I kinematics and morphology of IC 10 at high resolution while the GBT data allow us to search the surrounding area at high sensitivity for tenuous H I. IC 10's H I appears highly disturbed in both the VLA and GBT H I maps with a kinematicallymoreÂ Â» distinct northern H I extension, a kinematically distinct southern plume, and several spurs in the VLA data that do not follow the general kinematics of the main disk. We discuss three possible origins of its H I structure and kinematics in detail: a current interaction with a nearby companion, an advanced merger, and accretion of intergalactic medium. We find that IC 10 is most likely an advanced merger or a galaxy undergoing accretion.Â«Â less\n\nInterferometric CO observations of the ultraluminous IRAS galaxies ARP 220, IC 694/NGC 3690, NGC 6420 and NGC 7469\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSargent, A. I.; Sanders, D. B.; Scoville, N. Z.; Soifer, B. T.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nHigh resolution CO observations of the IRAS galaxies Arp 220, IC 694/NGC 3690, NGC 6240 and NGC 7469 were made with the Millimeter Wave Interferometer of the Owen Valley Radio Observatory. These yield spatial information on scales of 1 to 5 kpc and allow the separation of compact condensations from the more extended emission in the galaxies. In the case of the obviously interacting system IC 694/NGC 3690 the contributions of each component can be discerned. For that galaxy, and also for Arp 220, the unusually high lumonisities may be produced by nonthermal processes rather than by intense bursts of star formation.\n\nSubmillimeter Observations of the Low-Metallicity Galaxy NGC 4214\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKiuchi, Gaku; Ohta, Kouji; Sawicki, Marcin; Allen, Michael\n\n2004-12-01\n\nResults of submillimeter (450 and 850 Î¼m) observations of a nearby dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 4214 with SCUBA on JCMT are presented. We aimed at examining the far-infrared-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) and properties of dust thermal emission in a low-metallicity environment by choosing NGC 4214, in which the gas metallicity (logO/H+12) is 8.34. We found that the SED is quite similar to those of the IRAS Bright Galaxies Sample (IBGS), which are local bright star-forming galaxies with metallicities comparable to the solar abundance. The dust temperature and emissivity index for NGC 4214 obtained by a fitting to the single temperature graybody model are Td=35+/-0.8 K and Î²=1.4+/-0.1, respectively, which are typical values for IBGS galaxies. Compiling the previous studies on similar nearby dwarf irregular galaxies, we found that NGC 1569 shows similar results to those of NGC 4214, while NGC 4449 and IC 10 SE show different SEDs and low emissivity indices. There seems to be a variety of SEDs among metal-poor dwarf irregular galaxies. We examined the dependence on the intensity of interstellar radiation field, as well as a two-temperature model, but the origin of the difference is not clear. Some mechanism(s) other than metallicity and the interstellar radiation field must be responsible for controlling dust emission properties.\n\nRadio Jets Clearing the Way Through a Galaxy: Watching Feedback in Action in the Seyfert Galaxy IC 5063\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorganti, R.; Oosterloo, T. A.; Oonk, J. B. R.; Frieswijk, W.; Tadhunter, C. N.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nHigh-resolution (0.5 arcsec) CO(2-1) observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array have been used to trace the kinematics of the molecular gas in the Seyfert 2 galaxy{IC 5063}. Although one of the most radio-loud Seyfert galaxy, IC 5063 is a relatively weak radio source (P1.4GHz=3 Ã1023 W Hz-1). The data reveal that the kinematics of the gas is very complex. A fast outflow of molecular gas extends along the entire radio jet (Ë 1 kpc), with the highest outflow velocities about 0.5 kpc from the nucleus, at the location of the brighter hot-spot in the W lobe. All the observed characteristics can be described by a scenario of a radio plasma jet expanding into a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds and inflating a cocoon that drives a lateral outflow into the interstellar medium. This suggests that most of the observed cold molecular outflow is due to fast cooling of the gas after the passage of a shock and that it is the end product of the cooling process.\n\nVizieR Online Data Catalog: LITTLE THINGS dwarf irregular galaxies FUV regions (Hunter+, 2016)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHunter, D. A.; Elmegreen, B.

This is a multi-wavelength survey of nearby (<10.3 Mpc) dIrr galaxies and BCDs, which builds on the THINGS project, whose emphasis was on nearby spirals (Walter et al. 2008, J/AJ/136/2563). The galaxies and a few key parameters are listed in Table 1. We used FUV (1516 Ã ) images obtained by GALEX (Melena et al. 2009, J/AJ/138/1203; Hunter et al. 2010AJ....139..447H, 2011AJ....142..121H; Zhang et al. 2012AJ....143...47Z) to identify knots of emission in the outer disks of each galaxy. In order to better distinguish knots from the wide-spread diffuse emission, we subtracted the stellar continuum from each FUV image using the V-band image.

And IV has been catalogued both as a dwarf galaxy and as an open star cluster in M31. The color-magnitude diagrams presented indicate that this object has a young population of stars with a narrow age range, consistent with the characteristics of an open star cluster or stellar association. A radial velocity measurement taken from the literature and analyzed with respect to the rotation curve of M31 indicates this object resides in the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy, strengthening the conclusion that it is indeed a very large open star cluster or a densely populated stellar association rather than a dwarf irregular galaxy.\n\nON THE STAR FORMATION LAW FOR SPIRAL AND IRREGULAR GALAXIES\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nElmegreen, Bruce G., E-mail: bge@us.ibm.com\n\n2015-12-01\n\nA dynamical model for star formation on a galactic scale is proposed in which the interstellar medium is constantly condensing to star-forming clouds on the dynamical time of the average midplane density, and the clouds are constantly being disrupted on the dynamical timescale appropriate for their higher density. In this model, the areal star formation rate scales with the 1.5 power of the total gas column density throughout the main regions of spiral galaxies, and with a steeper power, 2, in the far outer regions and in dwarf irregular galaxies because of the flaring disks. At the same time, theremoreÂ Â» is a molecular star formation law that is linear in the main and outer parts of disks and in dIrrs because the duration of individual structures in the molecular phase is also the dynamical timescale, canceling the additional 0.5 power of surface density. The total gas consumption time scales directly with the midplane dynamical time, quenching star formation in the inner regions if there is no accretion, and sustaining star formation for â¼100 Gyr or more in the outer regions with no qualitative change in gas stability or molecular cloud properties. The ULIRG track follows from high densities in galaxy collisions.Â«Â less\n\nThe new semi-analytic code GalICS 2.0 - reproducing the galaxy stellar mass function and the Tully-Fisher relation simultaneously\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCattaneo, A.; Blaizot, J.; Devriendt, J. E. G.; Mamon, G. A.; Tollet, E.; Dekel, A.; Guiderdoni, B.; Kucukbas, M.; Thob, A. C. R.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nGalICS 2.0 is a new semi-analytic code to model the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cosmological context. N-body simulations based on a Planck cosmology are used to construct halo merger trees, track subhaloes, compute spins and measure concentrations. The accretion of gas on to galaxies and the morphological evolution of galaxies are modelled with prescriptions derived from hydrodynamic simulations. Star formation and stellar feedback are described with phenomenological models (as in other semi-analytic codes). GalICS 2.0 computes rotation speeds from the gravitational potential of the dark matter, the disc and the central bulge. As the rotation speed depends not only on the virial velocity but also on the ratio of baryons to dark matter within a galaxy, our calculation predicts a different Tully-Fisher relation from models in which vrot â vvir. This is why, GalICS 2.0 is able to reproduce the galaxy stellar mass function and the Tully-Fisher relation simultaneously. Our results are also in agreement with halo masses from weak lensing and satellite kinematics, gas fractions, the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass, the evolution of the cosmic SFR density, bulge-to-disc ratios, disc sizes and the Faber-Jackson relation.\n\nRevealing the nebular properties and Wolf-Rayet population of IC10 with Gemini/GMOS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTehrani, Katie; Crowther, Paul A.; Archer, I.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe present a deep imaging and spectroscopic survey of the Local Group irregular galaxy IC10 using Gemini North and GMOS to unveil its global Wolf-Rayet (WR) population. We obtain a star formation rate (SFR) of 0.045 Â± 0.023 Mâ yr-1, for IC10 from the nebular H Î± luminosity, which is comparable to the Small Magellanic Cloud. We also present a revised nebular oxygen abundance of log(O/H) + 12 = 8.40 Â± 0.04, comparable to the LMC. It has previously been suggested that for IC10 to follow the WR subtype-metallicity dependance seen in other Local Group galaxies, a large WN population awaits discovery. Our search revealed three new WN stars, and six candidates awaiting confirmation, providing little evidence to support this claim. The new global WR star total of 29 stars is consistent with the Large Magellanic Cloud population when scaled to the reduced SFR of IC10. For spectroscopically confirmed WR stars, the WC/WN ratio is lowered to 1.0; however, including all potential candidates, and assuming those unconfirmed to be WN stars, would reduce the ratio to â¼0.7. We attribute the high WC/WN ratio to the high star formation surface density of IC10 relative to the Magellanic Clouds, which enhances the frequency of high-mass stars capable of producing WC stars.\n\nSurvey of Water and Ammonia in Nearby Galaxies (SWAN): Resolved Ammonia Thermometry and Water and Methanol Masers in IC 342, NGC 6946, and NGC 2146\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGorski, Mark; Ott, JÃ¼rgen; Rand, Richard; Meier, David S.; Momjian, Emmanuel; Schinnerer, Eva\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe Survey of Water and Ammonia in Nearby galaxies (SWAN) studies atomic and molecular species across the nuclei of four star-forming galaxies: NGC 253, IC 342, NGC 6946, and NGC 2146. As part of this survey, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array molecular line observations of three galaxies: IC 342, NGC 6946, and NGC 2146. NGC 253 is covered in a previous paper. These galaxies were chosen to span an order of magnitude in star formation rates and to select a variety of galaxy types. We target the metastable transitions of ammonia NH3(1, 1) to (5, 5), the 22 GHz water (H2O) (616â523) transition, and the 36.1 GHz methanol (CH3OH) (4â1â30) transition. We use the NH3 metastable lines to perform thermometry of the dense molecular gas. We show evidence for uniform heating across the central kiloparsec of IC 342 with two temperature components for the molecular gas, similar to NGC 253, of 27 and 308 K, and that the dense molecular gas in NGC 2146 has a temperature <86 K. We identify two new water masers in IC 342, and one new water maser in each of NGC 6946 and NGC 2146. The two galaxies NGC 253 and NGC 2146, with the most vigorous star formation, host H2O kilomasers. Lastly, we detect the first 36 GHz CH3OH masers in IC 342 and NGC 6946. For the four external galaxies the total CH3OH luminosity in each galaxy suggests a correlation with galactic star formation rate, whereas the morphology of the emission is similar to that of HNCO, a weak shock tracer.\n\nDWARF IRREGULAR GALAXY LEO A: SUPRIME-CAM WIDE-FIELD STELLAR PHOTOMETRY\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStonkutÄ, Rima; Narbutis, Donatas; VanseviÄius, Vladas\n\n2014-10-01\n\nWe have surveyed a complete extent of Leo Aâan apparently isolated gas-rich low-mass dwarf irregular galaxy in the Local Group. The B, V, and I passband CCD images (typical seeing â¼0.''8) were obtained with the Subaru Telescope equipped with the Suprime-Cam mosaic camera. The wide-field (20' Ã 24') photometry catalog of 38,856 objects (V â¼ 16-26 mag) is presented. This survey is also intended to serve as ''a finding chart'' for future imaging and spectroscopic observation programs of Leo A.\n\nThe beautiful side of IC 335\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nHubble sees a galaxy 60 million light-years away This new NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows the galaxy IC 335 in front of a backdrop of distant galaxies. IC 335 is part of a galaxy group containing three other galaxies, and located in the Fornax Galaxy Cluster 60 million light-years away. As seen in this image, the disk of IC 335 appears edge-on from the vantage point of Earth. This makes it harder for astronomers to classify it, as most of the characteristics of a galaxyâs morphology â the arms of a spiral or the bar across the center â are only visible on its face. Still, the 45 000 light-year-long galaxy could be classified as an S0 type. These lenticular galaxies are an intermediate state in galaxy morphological classification schemes between true spiral and elliptical galaxies. They have a thin stellar disk and a bulge, like spiral galaxies, but in contrast to typical spiral galaxies they have used up most of the interstellar medium. Only a few new stars can be created out of the material that is left and the star formation rate is very low. Hence, the population of stars in S0 galaxies consists mainly of aging stars, very similar to the star population in elliptical galaxies. As S0 galaxies have only ill-defined spiral arms they are easily mistaken for elliptical galaxies if they are seen inclined face-on or edge-on as IC 335 here. And indeed, despite the morphological differences between S0 and elliptical class galaxies, they share some common characteristics, like typical sizes and spectral features. Both classes are also deemed \"early-type\" galaxies, because they are evolving passively. However, while elliptical galaxies may be passively evolving when we observe them, they have usually had violent interactions with other galaxies in their past. In contrast, S0 galaxies are either aging and fading spiral galaxies, which never had any interactions with other galaxies, or they are the aging result of a single merger between two spiral galaxies\n\nThe size and structure of the spheroid of IC 1613\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBattinelli, P.; Demers, S.; Artigau, Ã.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nContext: Nearby galaxies, spirals as well as irregulars, have been found to be much larger than previously believed. The structure of the huge spheroid surrounding dwarf galaxies could give clues to their past gravitational history. Thanks to wide field imagers, nearby galaxies with diameter of dozens of arcmin can be effectively surveyed. Aims: We obtain, from the CFHT archives, a series of i' and g' MegaCam images of IC 1613 in order to determine the stellar surface density of the field and determine the shape of its spheroid. Methods: From the colour magnitude diagram we select some 36 000 stars, in the first three magnitudes of the red giant branch. The spatial distribution of these stars is used to establish the structure of the spheroid. Results: The position angle of the major axis of the stellar spheroid is found to be â90Â°, some 30Â° from the major axis of the HI cloud surrounding IC 1613. The surface density profile of the spheroid is not exponential over all the length of the major axis. A King profile, with a core radius of 4.5' and a tidal radius of 24' fits the data. The tidal truncation of the spheroid suggests that IC 1613 is indeed a satellite of M 31. Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.\n\nEvolved stars in the Local Group galaxies - II. AGB, RSG stars and dust production in IC10\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDell'Agli, F.; Di Criscienzo, M.; Ventura, P.; Limongi, M.; GarcÃ­a-HernÃ¡ndez, D. A.; Marini, E.; Rossi, C.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe study the evolved stellar population of the Local Group galaxy IC10, with the aim of characterizing the individual sources observed and to derive global information on the galaxy, primarily the star formation history and the dust production rate. To this aim, we use evolutionary sequences of low- and intermediate-mass (M < 8 Mâ) stars, evolved through the asymptotic giant branch phase, with the inclusion of the description of dust formation. We also use models of higher mass stars. From the analysis of the distribution of stars in the observational planes obtained with IR bands, we find that the reddening and distance of IC10 are E(B - V) = 1.85 mag and d = 0.77 Mpc, respectively. The evolved stellar population is dominated by carbon stars, that account for 40% of the sources brighter than the tip of the red giant branch. Most of these stars descend from Ë1.1 - 1.3 Mâ progenitors, formed during the major epoch of star formation, which occurred Ë2.5 Gyr ago. The presence of a significant number of bright stars indicates that IC10 has been site of significant star formation in recent epochs and currently hosts a group of massive stars in the core helium-burning phase. Dust production in this galaxy is largely dominated by carbon stars; the overall dust production rate estimated is 7 Ã 10-6 Mâ/yr.\n\nA Neighboring Dwarf Irregular Galaxy Hidden by the Milky Way\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMassey, Philip; Henning, P. A.; Kraan-Korteweg, R. C.\n\n2003-11-01\n\nWe have obtained VLA and optical follow-up observations of the low-velocity H I source HIZSS 3 discovered by Henning et al. and Rivers in a survey for nearby galaxies hidden by the disk of the Milky Way. Its radio characteristics are consistent with this being a nearby (~1.8 Mpc) low-mass dwarf irregular galaxy (dIm). Our optical imaging failed to reveal a resolved stellar population but did detect an extended HÎ± emission region. The location of the HÎ± source is coincident with a partially resolved H I cloud in the 21 cm map. Spectroscopy confirms that the HÎ± source has a similar radial velocity to that of the H I emission at this location, and thus we have identified an optical counterpart. The HÎ± emission (100 pc in diameter and with a luminosity of 1.4Ã1038 ergs s-1) is characteristic of a single H II region containing a modest population of OB stars. The galaxy's radial velocity and distance from the solar apex suggests that it is not a Local Group member, although a more accurate distance is needed to be certain. The properties of HIZSS 3 are comparable to those of GR 8, a nearby dIm with a modest amount of current star formation. Further observations are needed to characterize its stellar population, determine the chemical abundances, and obtain a more reliable distance estimate.\n\nMassive Star Cluster Populations in Irregular Galaxies as Probable Younger Counterparts of Old Metal-rich Globular Cluster Populations in Spheroids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKravtsov, V. V.\n\n2006-09-01\n\nPeak metallicities of metal-rich populations of globular clusters (MRGCs) belonging to early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral galaxies (spheroids) of different mass fall within the somewhat conservative -0.7<=[Fe/H]<=-0.3 range. Indeed, if possible age effects are taken into account, this metallicity range might become smaller. Irregular galaxies such as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with longer timescales of formation and lower star formation (SF) efficiency, do not contain old MRGCs with [Fe/H]>-1.0, but they are observed to form populations of young/intermediate-age massive star clusters (MSCs) with masses exceeding 104 Msolar. Their formation is widely believed to be an accidental process fully dependent on external factors. From the analysis of available data on the populations and their hosts, including intermediate-age populous star clusters in the LMC, we find that their most probable mean metallicities fall within -0.7<=[Fe/H]<=-0.3, as the peak metallicities of MRGCs do, irrespective of signs of interaction. Moreover, both the disk giant metallicity distribution function (MDF) in the LMC and the MDFs for old giants in the halos of massive spheroids exhibit a significant increase toward [Fe/H]~-0.5. That is in agreement with a correlation found between SF activity in galaxies and their metallicity. The formation of both the old MRGCs in spheroids and MSC populations in irregular galaxies probably occurs at approximately the same stage of the host galaxies' chemical evolution and is related to the essentially increased SF activity in the hosts around the same metallicity that is achieved very early in massive spheroids, later in lower mass spheroids, and much later in irregular galaxies. Changes in the interstellar dust, particularly in elemental abundances in dust grains and in the mass distribution function of the grains, may be among the factors regulating star and MSC formation activity in galaxies. Strong interactions and mergers\n\nThe Star Cluster System in the Local Group Starburst Galaxy IC 10\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLim, Sungsoon; Lee, Myung Gyoon\n\n2015-05-01\n\nWe present a survey of star clusters in the halo of IC 10, a starburst galaxy in the Local Group, based on Subaru R-band images and NOAO Local Group Survey UBVRI images. We find five new star clusters. All of these star clusters are located far from the center of IC 10, while previously known star clusters are mostly located in the main body. Interestingly, the distribution of these star clusters shows an asymmetrical structure elongated along the east and southwest directions. We derive UBVRI photometry of 66 star clusters, including these new star clusters, as well as previously known star clusters. Ages of the star clusters are estimated from a comparison of their UBVRI spectral energy distribution with the simple stellar population models. We find that the star clusters in the halo are all older than 1 Gyr, while those in the main body have various ages, from very young (several Myr) to old (\\\\gt 1 Gyr). The young clusters (\\\\lt 10 Myr) are mostly located in the HÎ± emission regions and are concentrated on a small region at 2\\\\prime\\\\prime in the southeast direction from the galaxy center, while the old clusters are distributed in a wider area than the disk. Intermediate-age clusters (â¼100 Myr) are found in two groups. One is close to the location of the young clusters and the other is at â¼ 4\\\\prime\\\\prime from the location of the young clusters. The latter may be related to past mergers or tidal interaction.\n\nCarbon monoxide in clouds at low metallicity in the dwarf irregular galaxy WLM.\n\nPubMed\n\nElmegreen, Bruce G; Rubio, Monica; Hunter, Deidre A; Verdugo, Celia; Brinks, Elias; Schruba, Andreas\n\n2013-03-28\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is the primary tracer for interstellar clouds where stars form, but it has never been detected in galaxies in which the oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen is less than 20 per cent of that of the Sun, even though such 'low-metallicity' galaxies often form stars. This raises the question of whether stars can form in dense gas without molecules, cooling to the required near-zero temperatures by atomic transitions and dust radiation rather than by molecular line emission; and it highlights uncertainties about star formation in the early Universe, when the metallicity was generally low. Here we report the detection of CO in two regions of a local dwarf irregular galaxy, WLM, where the metallicity is 13 per cent of the solar value. We use new submillimetre observations and archival far-infrared observations to estimate the cloud masses, which are both slightly greater than 100,000 solar masses. The clouds have produced stars at a rate per molecule equal to 10 per cent of that in the local Orion nebula cloud. The CO fraction of the molecular gas is also low, about 3 per cent of the Milky Way value. These results suggest that in small galaxies both star-forming cores and CO molecules become increasingly rare in molecular hydrogen clouds as the metallicity decreases.\n\nQuantitative Spectroscopy of Supergiants in the Local Group Dwarf Galaxy IC 1613: Metallicity and Distance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBerger, Travis A.; Kudritzki, Rolf-Peter; Urbaneja, Miguel A.; Bresolin, Fabio; Gieren, Wolfgang; PietrzyÅski, Grzegorz; Przybilla, Norbert\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe present a spectral analysis of 21 blue supergiant stars of spectral types late B to early A within the Local Group dwarf galaxy IC 1613, based on VLT Focal Reducer and Low Dispersion Spectrograph 2 low-resolution spectra. Combining our results with studies of early B-type blue supergiants, we report a wide bimodal distribution of metallicities with two peaks around [Z] â¼ â0.50 dex and [Z] â¼ â0.85 dex. The bimodal distribution correlates with spatial location, when compared with column densities of neutral hydrogen in IC 1613. While the low [Z] objects appear in regions of relatively high ISM H I column densities or close to them, the high [Z] supergiants are found in the central H I hole that is almost devoid of hydrogen. This suggests there are varied chemical evolution histories for the young stellar populations in IC 1613. Utilizing the flux-weighted gravityâluminosity relation, we determine IC 1613's distance modulus as m â M = 24.39 Â± 0.11 mag. This value is in agreement within previous distance measurements using the near-infrared periodâluminosity relationship of Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch.\n\nChemistry and Kinematics of the Late-forming Dwarf Irregular Galaxies Leo A, Aquarius, and Sagittarius DIG\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKirby, Evan N.; Rizzi, Luca; Held, Enrico V.; Cohen, Judith G.; Cole, Andrew A.; Manning, Ellen M.; Skillman, Evan D.; Weisz, Daniel R.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of individual stars in the relatively isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies Leo A, Aquarius, and the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy. The three galaxiesâbut especially Leo A and Aquariusâshare in common delayed star formation histories (SFHs) relative to many other isolated dwarf galaxies. The stars in all three galaxies are supported by dispersion. We found no evidence of stellar velocity structure, even for Aquarius, which has rotating H I gas. The velocity dispersions indicate that all three galaxies are dark-matter-dominated, with dark-to-baryonic mass ratios ranging from {4.4}-0.8+1.0 (SagDIG) to {9.6}-1.8+2.5 (Aquarius). Leo A and SagDIG have lower stellar metallicities than Aquarius, and they also have higher gas fractions, both of which would be expected if Aquarius were further along in its chemical evolution. The metallicity distribution of Leo A is inconsistent with a closed or leaky box model of chemical evolution, suggesting that the galaxy was pre-enriched or acquired external gas during star formation. The metallicities of stars increased steadily for all three galaxies, but possibly at different rates. The [Î±/Fe] ratios at a given [Fe/H] are lower than that of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which indicates more extended SFHs than Sculptor, consistent with photometrically derived SFHs. Overall, the bulk kinematic and chemical properties for the late-forming dwarf galaxies do not diverge significantly from those of less delayed dwarf galaxies, including dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M.

ALMA CO observations of masses, column densities, and velocities are combined with HI, HÎ±, optical, and 24 micron data to study the star formation rates and efficiencies. The close encounter of the galaxies produced in-plane tidal forces in IC 2163, resulting in a large shock with high molecular velocity gradients and both radial and azimuthal streaming (100 km/s) that formed a pile-up of molecular gas in the resulting cuspy-oval or ``eyelid'' structure at mid-radius. The encounter also produced forces nearly orthogonal to the plane of NGC 2207, resulting in a warp. By comparing with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for star formation, we find that some regions of NGC 2207 with unusually high turbulent speeds (40-50 km/s) and high star formation rates (>0.01 Mo/pc2/Myr) have gas that is predominantly atomic with high density cores. Half of the CO mass is in 300 clouds each more massive than 4.0x105 Mo. The mass distribution functions for the CO clouds and star complexes in the eyelid in IC 2163 both have a slope similar to what is observed in Milky Way clouds; the CO slope is steeper in NGC 2207. The CO distribution in NGC 2207 also includes a nuclear ring, a mini-bar, and a mini-starburst region that dominates the 24 micron, radio, and HÎ± emission in both galaxies. Dust extinction, molecular column densities, and slightly negative molecular velocities indicate the mini-starburst region has ejected a jet of molecular gas nearly perpendicular to the plane of NGC 2207 on the near side with a kinetic energy of 1052 ergs. The large scale star formation efficiency, measured as the ratio of the summed masses of the star complexes near molecular clouds to the combined star complex and cloud masses, is 7% overall; it is 23% in the mini-starburst. The maximum age of star complexes in the galactic-scale shock front at the eyelid is about the same as the time since closest\n\nGHASP: an HÎ± kinematical survey of spiral galaxies - XI. Distribution of luminous and dark matter in spiral and irregular nearby galaxies using WISE photometry.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKorsaga, M.; Carignan, C.; Amram, P.; Epinat, B.; Jarrett, T. H.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe present the mass distribution of a sample of 121 nearby galaxies with high quality optical velocity fields and available infra-red WISE 3.4 Î¼m data. Contrary to previous studies, this sample covers all morphological types and is not biased toward late-type galaxies. These galaxies are part of the Fabry-Perot kinematical GHASP survey of spirals and irregular nearby galaxies. Combining the kinematical data to the WISE surface brightness data probing the emission from the old stellar population, we derive mass models allowing us to compare the luminous to the dark matter halo mass distribution in the optical regions of those galaxies. Dark matter (DM) models are constructed using the isothermal core profile and the Navarro-Frenk-White cuspy profile. We allow the M/L of the baryonic disc to vary or we keep it fixed, constrained by stellar evolutionary models (WISE W1-W2 color) and we carry out best fit (BFM) and pseudo-isothermal maximum disc (MDM) models. We found that the MDM provides M/L values four times higher than the BFM, suggesting that disc components, on average, tend to be maximal. The main results are: (i) the rotation curves of most galaxies are better fitted with core rather than cuspy profiles; (ii) the relation between the parameters of the DM and of the luminous matter components mostly depends on morphological types. More precisely, the distribution of the DM inside galaxies depends on whether or not the galaxy has a bulge.\n\nKINEMATICS OF SUPERBUBBLES AND SUPERSHELLS IN THE IRREGULAR GALAXY, NGCÂ 1569\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSÃ¡nchez-Cruces, M.; Rosado, M.; RodrÃ­guez-GonzÃ¡lez, A.\n\nWe present observations in the optical lines of HÎ± and [S II]Â (Î»Î»6717, 6731 Ã ) and in X-rays of the irregular galaxy, NGCÂ 1569. The observations in HÎ± and [S II] were made with the UNAM scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer (PUMA) and the X-ray data were obtained from the Chandra data archive. We detected several superbubbles, filaments, and supershells in NGCÂ 1569 for which we determined size as well as their kinematic properties. We present a catalog of expansion velocities of 12 superbubbles, listing their positions, diameters, and physical parameters. Likewise, we present a catalog of 15 filaments and 4 supershells. In order tomoreÂ Â» identify possible X-ray emission from the superbubbles in this galaxy, we analyzed the X-ray emission of NGCÂ 1569 in two energy bands: 0.2-2.0 keV (soft X-rays) and 2.0-8.0 keV (hard X-rays). Based on X-ray images, we detected X-ray emission that could possibly be related to some of the superbubbles. The spectrum of the X-ray superbubbles can be described by an optically thin thermal plasma model. In order to identify the possible coexistence of galactic super winds and superbubbles we have performed adiabatic three-dimensional N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to follow the evolution of the most important stellar clusters in this galaxy, SSCÂ A and SSCÂ B, using the GADGET-2 code. Those simulations demonstrate that depending on the specific initial conditions, the formation of superbubbles or a galactic superwind can result in NGCÂ 1569.Â«Â less\n\nDeep g'r'i'z' GMOS Imaging of the Dwarf Irregular Galaxy Kar 50\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDavidge, T. J.\n\n2002-11-01\n\nImages obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) are used to investigate the stellar content and distance of the dwarf irregular galaxy Kar 50. The brightest object is an H II region, and the bright stellar content is dominated by stars with g'-r'<0. The tips of the main sequence and the red giant branch (RGB) are tentatively identified near r'=24.9 and i'=25.5, respectively. The galaxy has a blue integrated color and no significant color gradient, and we conclude that Kar 50 has experienced a recent galaxy-wide episode of star formation. The distance estimated from the brightest blue stars indicates that Kar 50 is behind the M81 group, and this is consistent with the tentative RGB-tip brightness. Kar 50 has a remarkably flat central surface brightness profile, even at wavelengths approaching 1 Î¼m, although there is no evidence of a bar. In the absence of another large star-forming episode, Kar 50 will evolve into a very low surface brightness galaxy.

The main results are: (i) the rotation curves of most galaxies are better fitted with core rather than cuspy profiles; and (ii) the relation between the parameters of the DM and of the luminous matter components mostly depends on morphological types. More precisely, the distribution of the DM inside galaxies depends on whether or not the galaxy has a bulge.\n\nThe dwarf galaxy UGC 5272 and its small companion galaxy\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHopp, U.; Schulte-Ladbeck, R. E.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe present study of optical images and spectroscopy of the dwarf irregular galaxy UGC 5272 notes the presence, at 3.6 kpc, of a small neighboring galaxy which is also of irregular type and has a Holmberg diameter of 0.6 kpc. Attention is given to the possibility that the two galaxies, which are resolved into single stars, may form a physical pair. It is suggested that the blue-to-red supergiant ratio of UGC 5272 is high due to its low metallicity. While its extremely blue colors are suggestive of a recent starburst, the structural parameters of the galaxy are surprisingly normal. The gas contribution to total mass is high.\n\nThe Search for Wolf-Rayet Stars in IC10\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTehrani, Katie; Crowther, Paul; Archer, Isabelle\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe present a deep imaging and spectroscopic survey of the Local Group starburst galaxy IC10 using Gemini North/GMOS to unveil the global Wolf-Rayet population. It has previously been suggested that for IC10 to follow the WC/WN versus metallicity dependence seen in other Local Group galaxies, a large WN population must remain undiscovered. Our search revealed 3 new WN stars, and 5 candidates awaiting confirmation, providing little evidence to support this claim. We also compute an updated nebular derived metallicity of log(O/H)+12=8.40 +/- 0.04 for the galaxy using the direct method. Inspection of IC10 WR average line luminosities show these stars are more similar to their LMC, rather than SMC counterparts.\n\nThe jet-ISM interactions in IC 5063\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMukherjee, Dipanjan; Wagner, Alexander Y.; Bicknell, Geoffrey V.; Morganti, Raffaella; Oosterloo, Tom; Nesvadba, Nicole; Sutherland, Ralph S.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe interstellar medium of the radio galaxy IC 5063 is highly perturbed by an AGN jet expanding in the gaseous disc of the galaxy. We model this interaction with relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and multiphase initial conditions for the interstellar medium and compare the results with recent observations. As the jets flood through the intercloud channels of the disc, they ablate, accelerate, and disperse clouds to velocities exceeding 400 km s-1. Clouds are also destroyed or displaced in bulk from the central regions of the galaxy. Our models with jet powers of 1044 and 1045 erg s-1 are capable of reproducing many of the observed features in the position velocity diagram of IC 5063, and confirm the notion that the jet is responsible for the strongly perturbed gas dynamics seen in the ionized, neutral, and molecular gas phases. In our simulations, we also see strong venting of the jet plasma perpendicular to the disc, which entrains clumps and diffuse filaments into the halo of the galaxy. Our simulations are the first 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the jet and interstellar matter of IC 5063.\n\nMeasuring star formation rates in blue galaxies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGallagher, John S., III; Hunter, Deidre A.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe problems associated with measurements of star formation rates in galaxies are briefly reviewed, and specific models are presented for determinations of current star formation rates from H alpha and Far Infrared (FIR) luminosities. The models are applied to a sample of optically blue irregular galaxies, and the results are discussed in terms of star forming histories. It appears likely that typical irregular galaxies are forming stars at nearly constant rates, although a few examples of systems with enhanced star forming activity are found among HII regions and luminous irregular galaxies.\n\nStar Formation Properties of Irregular Galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHunter, D. A.; Elmegreen, B. G.\n\n2003-12-01\n\nWhat regulates star formation in gas-rich dwarf galaxies on global and local scales? To address this question, we have conducted a survey of a large sample of reasonably normal, relatively nearby, non-interacting galaxies without spiral arms. The sample includes 94 Im galaxies, 26 Blue Compact Dwarfs, and 20 Sm systems. The data consist of UBV and HÎ± images for the entire sample, and JHK images, HI maps, CO observations, and HII region spectrophotometry for a sub-sample. The HÎ± , UBV, and JHK image sets act as probes of star formation on three different times scales: HÎ± images trace the most recent star formation (â¤10 Myrs) through the ionization of natal clouds by the short-lived massive stars; UBV, while a more complicated clue, integrates over the past Gyr; and JHK integrates over the lifetime of the galaxy where even in Im galaxies global JHK colors are characteristic of old stellar populations. These data are being used to determine the nature and distribution of the star formation activity, to characterize the interstellar medium out of which the clouds and stars are forming, and to develop models that describe the important processes that drive star formation in these tiny systems. Here we present the HÎ± data: integrated star formation rates, azimuthally-averaged HÎ± surface brightnesses, and extents of star formation, and explore the relationship of the star formation properties to other integrated parameters of the galaxies. One TI CCD used in this work was provided to Lowell by the National Science Foundation and another was on loan from the U. S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff. The HÎ± filters were purchased with funds provided by a Small Research Grant from the American Astronomical Society, National Science Foundation grant AST-9022046, and grant 960355 from JPL. Funding for carrying out this work was provided by the Lowell Research Fund and by the National Science Foundation through grants AST-0204922 to DAH and AST-0205097 to BGE.\n\nRapid and multiband variability of the TeV bright active nucleus of the galaxy IC 310\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nAleksiÄ, J.; Antonelli, L. A.; Antoranz, P.; ...\n\n2014-03-14\n\nRecently the radio galaxy IC 310 was identified as a Î³-ray emitter based on observations at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT and at very high energies (VHE, E > 100 GeV) with the MAGIC telescopes. Originally classified as a head-tail radio galaxy, the nature of this object is subject of controversy since its nucleus shows blazar-like behavior. In order to understand the nature of IC 310 and the origin of the VHE emission, we studied the spectral and flux variability of IC 310 from the X-ray band to the VHE Î³-ray regime. The light curve of IC 310 above 300 GeVmoreÂ Â» has been measured with the MAGIC telescopes from 2009 October to 2010 February. Contemporaneous Fermi-LAT data (2008-2011) in the 10-500 GeV energy range were also analyzed. In the X-ray regime, archival observations from 2003 to 2007 with XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Swift-XRT in the 0.5-10 keV band were studied. The VHE light curve reveals several high-amplitude and short-duration flares. Day-to-day flux variability is clearly present (>5Ï). The photon index between 120 GeV and 8 TeV remains at the value Î ~ 2.0 during both low and high flux states. The VHE spectral shape does not show significant variability, whereas the flux at 1 TeV changes by a factor of ~7. Fermi-LAT detected only eight Î³-ray events in the energy range 10 GeVâ500 GeV in three years of observation. Moreover, the measured photon index of Î = 1.3 Â± 0.5 in the Fermi-LAT range is very hard. The X-ray measurements show strong variability in both flux and photon index. The latter varied from 1.76 Â± 0.07 to 2.55 Â± 0.07. The rapid variability measured in Î³-rays and"
