        "text": "A Survey of the Resolved Stellar Content of Nearby Galaxies Currently Forming Stars\n\nTwo of our 10 M31 fields mosaiced together; color based upon our BVR images.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe galaxies of the Local Group serve as our laboratories for understanding star formation and stellar evolution in differing environments: the galaxies currently active in star-formation in the Local Group cover a factor of 10 in metallicity and span a range of Hubble types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc. We are conducting a uniform survey (UBVRI, Halpha, [SII], and [OIII]) of nearby galaxies selected on the basis of current star formation. In the Local Group, this sample includes M31, M33, NGC 6822, IC 1613, IC 10, WLM, Pegasus, and Phoenix; we exclude the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, which are being surveyed separately by seve ral groups. We also include Sextans A and Sextans B, located just beyond the Local Group (van den Bergh 1999a, 1999b). Using the new, wide-field Mosaic cameras, we are producing catalogs of UBVRI photometry of roughly a million stars, using Halpha, [SII], and [OIII] to distinguish bona fide stellar members from compact HII regions. This on-line catalog will answer a number of scientific questions directly, but we believe that the real strength of this survey will be in the science we will enable with 8-10-m class telescopes and the capability of follow-u p spectroscopy. In addition, the calibrated images will provide a detailed, uniform atlas of both the stellar and ionized gas components of these galaxies, which will certainly prove useful for a host of other projects.\n\nThe Team\n\nThe following compose our Survey Team:\n\nPhil Massey, Lowell Observatory\n\nPaul Hodge, University of Washington\n\nShay Strong (Holmes), Univ of Texas\n\nGeorge Jacoby, WIYN\n\nKnut Olsen, CTIO/NOAO\n\nAbhijit Saha, KPNO/NOAO\n\nWayne Schlingman, University of Arizona\n\nChris Smith, CTIO/NOAO\n\nNEW COLOR IMAGES (February 2007)\n\nCTIO has kindly put nice versions of our images as downloads; go to http://www.ctio.noao.edu/images/download_pict/local_group_survey.htm\n\nIn addition....

The stacked images can be downloaded either from ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/massey/lgsurvey or from http://www.archive.noao.edu/nsa/ The individual images can be obtained from http://www.archive.noao.edu/nsa/ Tell them Phil send you.\n\nOur UBVRI photometry is complete. The first paper ``A Survey of Local Group Galaxies Currently Forming Stars. I. UBVRI Photometry of Stars in M31 and M33 was published in Massey et al. 2006 AJ 131, 2478.\n\nThe second paper, ``...II. UBVRI Photometry of Stars in Seven Dwarfs and a Comparison of the Entire Sample\" has now also come out: Massey et al. AJ, 133, 2393.\n\nThe third paper, \"...III. A Search for Luminous Blue Variables and Other Halpha Emission-Lined Stars\" is heavily in prep.\n\nThe UBVRI data files can be downloaded here:\n\nIC10\n\nNGC 6822\n\nWLM\n\nSextans B\n\nSextans A\n\nPegasus Dwarf\n\nPhoenix Dwarf\n\nM31\n\nM33\n\nPLEASE send me (phil.massey at lowell.edu) a note giving publication information if you use our data or photometry so we can include it when we are bugged by NOAO to give them this information each year.\n\nWhat about the emission-line data (not covered in the above? We are preparing a separate paper on those, but for now let me note that the following conversions between 1 count/sec and emission-line fluxes: (in ergs/sec/cm^2/A) for our stacked images. (Northern data)\n\nHalpha: 1.79E-16\n\n[SII]: 1.84E-16\n\n[OIII]: 3.92E-16\n\nFor continuum sources one instead needs to use: (in ergs/sec/cm^2/A):\n\nHalpha: 2.14E-18, or m_nu=22.68\n\n[SII]: 2.21E-18, or m_nu=22.59\n\n[OIII]: 6.41E-18, or m_nu=22.08\n\nThe numbers for the October 2000 run are almost exactly the same as these averages; those for the Sept 01 run about about 5% lower, while those for Feb 01 are about 5% higher. In other words, these numbers should be good to (more or less kind of 5%). Got it?\n\nMy 2006 REU student, Taylor McNeill (Smith) has now measured the spectrophotometric standards for the southern data (WLM, NGC 6822, and Phoenix) and comes up with the following numbers:\n\nHalpha: 1.80E-16\n\n[SII]: 1.71E-16\n\n[OIII]: 2.75E-16\n\nFor continuum sources:\n\nHalpha: 2.18E-18, or m_nu=22.66\n\n[SII]: 2.02E-18, or m_nu=22.69\n\n[OIII]: 5.11E-18, or m_nu=22.32\n\nPUBLICATIONS (Ours and Others)\n\nMcNeill, R.
