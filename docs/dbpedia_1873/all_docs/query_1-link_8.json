We also discuss star formation feedback, gas accretion, and mergers with other dwarfs that connect the ISM to the circumgalactic and intergalactic media.

Rev. Astronomy and Astrophysics\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe interstellar medium (ISM) is a dynamic part of galactic ecosystems. Baryons are cycled from the ISM into stars through star formation processes and are returned to the ISM, circumgalactic medium (CGM), and even intergalactic medium (IGM) through feedback from stellar winds and explosions. With stellar feedback in the weak gravitational potential of a dIrr, the products of stellar nucleosynthesis are only partially redistributed throughout the ISM; significant quantities escape into the halo, leaving the disk relatively metal-poor. Overall the ISM is complex, dynamic, and multi-faceted.\n\nIn this review, we concentrate on the ISM of dwarf Irregular (dIrr) galaxies. dIrrs are tiny but they are not just small versions of spiral galaxies. dIrrs are, in fact, dominated by their ISM (see, for example, Figure 1). Their ISMs are primarily atomic hydrogen and helium but the inner regions could also contain substantial amounts of molecular hydrogen (H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT), and they most often have star formation. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph), on the other hand, are primarily devoid of an ISM, believed to have been stripped. Thus, we will not discuss dSphs.\n\n{marginnote}\n\n[] \\entryISMThe interstellar medium is the gas and dust mixed with the stars of a galaxy. \\entryCGMThe circumgalactic medium is the gas in the outer halo of a galaxy. \\entryIGMThe intergalactic medium is the gas beyond and between galaxies.\n\nDwarf galaxies were first studied in detail by Reaves (1956) in a survey for them in the Virgo Cluster. Unfortunately, the class was never truly defined; Reaves refers to them simply as ‚Äúunderluminous.‚Äù In subsequent decades some researchers defined samples based on luminosity, some on surface brightness, and some on baryonic mass. Furthermore, 50 years ago the dwarfs were labeled as Irr-I or Im (Magellanic-type irregulars) or Irr-II (amorphous). However, in recent decades, as dwarfs became better known, those terms have been dropped and researchers rarely define ‚Äúdwarf‚Äù. Here we will define what we mean by ‚ÄúdIrr‚Äù by two galaxies that represent the extremes to us.\n\nDwarf irregulars are generally faint, small, low in total mass, low in metallicity, low in dust, and blue in optical colors. However, as a class they exhibit a range in these properties (see lists of dIrrs in Mateo, 1998, Hunter et al., 2012). In the Local Group, for example, Leo T has an absolute VùëâVitalic_V magnitude MVsubscriptùëÄùëâM_{V}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of ‚àí77-7- 7 (de Jong et al., 2008), a total baryonic mass of only 6√ó1056superscript1056\\times 10^{5}6 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT, a half-light radius of 170 pc, and a metallicity 0.025ZùëçZitalic_Z‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT(Irwin et al., 2007, Ryan-Weber et al., 2008, Adams & Osterloo, 2018).

A typical nearby dIrr is shown in Figure 1 and others are shown in figures throughout the text.\n\n{marginnote}\n\n[] \\entrydIrrDwarf irregular galaxies are small and intrinsically chaotic in appearance. They lack spiral arms and bulges. \\entrydSphDwarf spheroidal galaxies have a smooth, elliptical appearance. \\entryBCDBlue Compact Dwarfs are centrally concentrated, high surface brightness, and actively forming stars.\n\nAlthough they are tiny compared to spiral and elliptical galaxies, dwarf systems have had an outsized cosmological impact. Simulations of galaxy formation show spirals forming from merging small dark-matter halos, which are essentially dwarf galaxies (see Tosi, 2003). The remnants of such accretions are sometimes visible today as stellar streams in galaxy halos (e.g., Ibata et al., 1994). Dwarfs are also likely to have formed the first stars (see review in Bromm & Larson, 2004). Lyman-alpha emitters at high redshift have low masses like dwarfs (Ouchi et al., 2020) and may have some properties in common with local dIrrs. Their relatively high escape fraction for Lyman continuum radiation suggests they contributed to the reionization of the Universe (e.g., Asada et al., 2023).\n\nBelow we discuss the various components of the ISM of dIrrs, the processes that take place there, exchange of gas from the CGM and IGM, and outstanding questions. Major surveys related to this topic are listed in Table 1. Related reviews include those on the cold ISM in galaxies (Saintonge & Catinella, 2022), dust in galaxies (Galliano et al., 2018), the ISM in dwarfs (Henkel et al., 2022), chemical properties of dwarf galaxies (Annibali & Tosi, 2022), warm and hot diffuse gas in dwarfs (Bomans, 2001), ultra-faint dwarfs (Simon, 2019), the structure and evolution of irregular galaxies (Gallagher & Hunter, 1984), and star formation in dwarfs (Hunter, 2008, Bolatto, 2019).\n\n2 ATOMIC GAS\n\n2.1 Large-scale Distribution\n\nAtomic hydrogen gas densities in dIrr galaxies are generally lower than in giant spirals. Surface densities in the central regions have peaks of order 1-8 M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTpc‚àí22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, which are comparable to those in the main disk of spirals, 5-10 M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTpc‚àí22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT (Brinks & Portas, 2016, Hunter et al., 2021b). However, spiral galaxies have much higher surface densities closer to the center, while dIrrs have lower surface densities everywhere else. Fits of a Sersic function (I‚Å¢(R)=I0‚Å¢e‚àí(R/R0)1/nùêºùëÖsubscriptùêº0superscriptùëísuperscriptùëÖsubscriptùëÖ01ùëõI(R)=I_{0}e^{-(R/R_{0})^{1/n}}italic_I ( italic_R ) = italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - ( italic_R / italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 1 / italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT) to the H i radial (RùëÖRitalic_R) profiles of dIrrs find n‚àº0.2‚àí1similar-toùëõ0.21n\\sim 0.2-1italic_n ‚àº 0.2 - 1, where an n=1ùëõ1n=1italic_n = 1 is exponential; n<1ùëõ1n<1italic_n < 1 has a slightly flatter central profile and a faster fall-off outside (Hunter et al., 2021b).\n\nFigure 1 shows that most dIrrs are gas-rich compared to their stellar mass. The gas associated with galaxies usually extends further than the stars, but it may extend much further than previously realized. Deep H i surveys such as MHONGOOSE, with column density sensitivities better than 1018superscript101810^{18}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 18 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm‚àí22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, find up to 25% of a galaxy‚Äôs gas in the far outer regions at very low column densities (see, for example, Sardone et al., 2021). It is not clear what role this outer disk gas plays in galactic evolution.\n\nGas in all but the smallest dIrrs exhibits regular circular rotation, often with a near-linear rise in rotation speed away from the center (Lo et al., 1993a, b, Oh et al., 2015, Iorio et al., 2017). Observations of the H i kinematics of the low-mass end of dIrrs show the difficulties in fitting a rotation curve to these galaxies (e.g. Oh et al., 2015, McNichols et al., 2016). Simulations also suggest that at the lowest masses (<108absentsuperscript108<10^{8}< 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT), dIrrs should be dispersion-dominated because of heating by the cosmic UV background, which suppresses high angular momentum accretion, and high turbulence from stellar feedback (El-Badry et al., 2018). For those galaxies with regular rotation, the ISM does not undergo the levels of shear that occur in spirals with flat rotation curves, and this low shear means that ISM structures, such as shells and holes, can last longer than in the highly sheared regime of spiral disks.\n\n2.2 Structures\n\nThe ISM of dIrr galaxies is not smoothly distributed. It contains clouds, holes, and shells. There is also flaring of the H i disk and turbulence throughout the gas. Here we discuss the various structures in the ISM and the relationship of the ISM to star formation and the stellar disk.\n\n2.2.1 Clouds\n\nAtomic gas consists of cool and dense clouds, often in filaments, and lower-density, warmer gas between them. Power spectra of H i emission from the SMC and LMC actually show a hierarchy of structures, so the cloud-intercloud model is oversimplified (Stanimiroviƒá et al., 1999, Elmegreen et al., 2001). Dense regions that might be identified as discrete clouds several 100 pc in size were identified in 9 dIrrs by Lo et al. (1993a, b). Kim et al. (2007) identified 468 H i clouds with masses of 103superscript10310^{3}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to 105superscript10510^{5}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTin the LMC and Hunter et al. (2019) identified 814 H i clouds with masses of 103superscript10310^{3}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to 107superscript10710^{7}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTin 40 nearby dIrrs. In the Hunter et al. study, the clouds constitute 2% to 53% of the total H i mass of the host galaxy. Many of these clouds are in the outer regions, beyond one disk scale length, and not all of them are self-gravitating unless they contain significant amounts of molecular or cold atomic gas.\n\n{marginnote}\n\n[] \\entrySMC and LMCThe Small and Large Magellanic Clouds are two dIrrs that are gravitationally interacting with each other and with the Milky Way. The LMC is at the massive end of dwarfs, and the SMC has been significantly disturbed by the interaction.\n\n2.2.2 Holes, Shells, and Outflows\n\nThe ISM of dIrrs is especially characterized by holes, giving them a high porosity (Dimaratos et al., 2015, Cormier et al., 2019). In 41 gas-rich dIrrs from LITTLE THINGS, Pokhrel et al. (2020) identified 306 holes in H i ranging in diameter from the resolution limit of 40 pc up to 2.3 kpc with expansion speeds up to 30 km s‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT. The H i surface porosity (ratio of total area covered by holes to total area covered by H i out to a column density of 5√ó10195superscript10195\\times 10^{19}5 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 19 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT atoms cm‚àí22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT) is as high as 15%. In another sample of nearby spirals and dwarfs, Bagetakos et al. (2011) detected more than 1000 holes in 20 galaxies with sizes of 0.1 kpc to 2 kpc and ages of 3 Myr to 150 Myr; 23% of these fell beyond the optical radius. Relatively low shear, reduced disk gravity, and a relatively large scale height in dIrrs enables feedback-driven shells to grow larger compared to the disk scale length than in spirals (Brinks et al., 2002).\n\nGiant shells in dwarf galaxies often contain secondary star formation triggered by the compression of gas in the surrounding region. Examples are in IC 2574 (Walter et al., 1998, Egorov et al., 2014), DDO 47 (Walter & Brinks, 2001), Haro 14 (Cair√≥s & Gonz√°lez-P√©rez, 2017a), Tololo 1937-423 (Cair√≥s & Gonz√°lez-P√©rez, 2017b), Holmberg I (Ott et al., 2001, Egorov et al., 2018), and Holmberg II (Puche et al., 1992, Egorov et al., 2017, see Figure 3 below). (See Zucker et al., 2022, for a solar neighborhood example.) Simulations of this process are in Kawata et al. (2014) and Lah√©n et al. (2019). Constellation III in the LMC is a spectacular region that formed stars 12‚Äì16 Myrs ago and blew a 1.4-kpc hole in the ISM. Stars have formed in the surrounding shell over the past 6 Myrs (Dolphin & Hunter, 1998). Some holes in dIrrs are large enough to dominate the entire galaxy. In DDO 88 there is a 2-kpc hole centered on the optical galaxy with a radius of half of the optical size of the galaxy. The shell surrounding the hole contains 30% of the total H i (Simpson et al., 2005). The impact of giant shells on total star formation is not known. Only a small fraction of the star formation (<<<15%) is in obvious shells (Bolds, 2020), and the star formation rate (SFR) does not correlate with the porosity (Pokhrel et al., 2020).\n\nBeyond the immediate shells with triggered star formation, the porosity caused by holes allows far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons from young stars to travel throughout a galaxy, heating the ISM and inhibiting more star formation (Silk, 1997, Forbes et al., 2016). Another consequence of this porosity is that star formation moves around the galaxy on long time and spatial scales as regions are hollowed out by stellar feedback and take time to fill back in. Combined with relatively rapid motions from feedback and aggravation from outside, the effects can be severe, as in DDO 187 and NGC 3738, which have a blue star-forming half and a redder half with only older stars (Hunter et al., 2018). Heating and dynamical perturbations can also lead to ‚Äúgaspy‚Äù star formation (Lee et al., 2007) where the star formation rate increases and decreases as conditions periodically favor and then inhibit star formation on a large scale. This can even lead to a reshuffling of the H i relative to the stars where the gas becomes more centrally concentrated (Simpson & Gottesman, 2000) or of the stars themselves as stellar feedback forces radial migration of stars outward (El-Badry et al., 2016).\n\nHoles are generally believed to be formed by feedback from massive stars. These stars dump copious quantities of mechanical energy into the ISM from stellar winds and supernovae (Tenorio-Tagle & Bodenheimer, 1988, Vorobyov & Basu, 2005). However, the story may sometimes be more complicated than holes resulting from a single star formation event. Multi-age stellar populations are inside the H i holes in Holmberg II, suggesting feedback over a period of 100 Myrs (Weisz et al., 2009). Kepley et al. (2007) suggested that the central H i depression in WLM could have formed by feedback over the past 130 Myr. Multiple generations including triggered star formation were found to enlarge the holes in 5 dIrrs by Warren et al. (2011). Starbursts occasionally last for 500 Myr (McQuinn et al., 2010).\n\nIntense stellar feedback can result in very large holes that break out of the disk and sometimes result in outflows into the CGM (Marasco et al., 2023). NGC 1569 is a good example of a nearby (2 Mpc) dwarf irregular with massive star clusters (Hunter et al., 2000), energetic feedback, a kiloparsec-scale hole, and outflow in a hot wind. Large-scale (up to several kpc) HŒ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± filaments extend out of the plane of the galaxy (Hunter et al., 1993a, b). (See Figure 2.) Spectral analysis by Hunter & Gallagher (1997) shows that the large-scale filaments are photoionized, probably by photons escaping H ii regions located up to a kpc away. The implied escape fraction is of order 25%. Heckman et al. (1995) observed that about half of the X-ray flux from this galaxy originates in a ‚àº2similar-toabsent2\\sim 2‚àº 2 kpc halo, with X-ray spurs along the galaxy minor axis adjacent to the long HŒ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± filament. The outflow speed reaches 200 km s‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT (see also Westmoquette et al., 2008), and the outflow age is comparable to the starburst age of ‚àº107similar-toabsentsuperscript107\\sim 10^{7}‚àº 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT years. Heckman et al. (1995) and Martin (1998) suggest that the expanding material could eventually blow out into the halo. Spectroscopic observations by Martin et al. (2002) found that the X-ray wind is metal-enriched, having a solar abundance of Œ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± elements, which requires nearly all of the oxygen made in the starburst to go into the wind, whereas the disk H ii regions are 0.2ZùëçZitalic_Z‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT. The dust-to-gas ratio (DGR) is higher on the periphery of the H i hole (Lianou et al., 2014). The magnetic pressure in NGC 1569 is approximately in equilibrium with the other ISM components (Kepley et al., 2010).\n\nNGC 1705 (Hensler et al., 1998), I Zw 18 (Martin, 1996, Hunt et al., 2005), NGC 5253 (Martin & Kennicutt, 1995), IC 2574 (Walter et al., 1998), NGC 4214 (Hartwell et al., 2004), and IC 10 (Heesen et al., 2015) are galaxies similar to NGC 1569 with massive star-forming regions and large bubbles of soft X-ray emission. In some cases, the energy and momentum in the bubble is enough to push the hot gas and local ISM out of the galaxy (Marlowe et al., 1995). This ‚Äúblow-out‚Äù can remove a significant fraction of the metals produced in the starburst (Dekel & Silk, 1986), as shown by numerical simulations (De Young & Heckman, 1994, for recent work see Emerick et al. 2019 and references therein) and suggested by observations of NGC 1569 (Martin et al., 2002), NGC 625 (Cannon et al., 2005), I Zw 18 (Martin, 1996, Hunt et al., 2005), and Holmberg I (Ott et al., 2001). Outflows have also been observed in the LMC (Ciampa et al., 2021) and SMC (Di Teodoro et al., 2019). McQuinn et al. (2019) observed winds in 6 star-bursting dwarf galaxies using deep HŒ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± observations, and Grimes et al. (2005) observed X-rays from winds in 7 dwarfs.\n\nOutflows into the CGM, such as seen so dramatically in NGC 1569 and NGC 1705, allow Lyman continuum photons to escape from the cavities (Fujita et al., 2003) and may carry the magnetic field out with it too (Chy≈ºy et al., 2016). In 43 low-mass galaxies (108‚Å¢M‚äô<Mstars<1010‚Å¢M‚äôsuperscript108subscriptùëÄdirect-productsubscriptùëÄstarssuperscript1010subscriptùëÄdirect-product10^{8}M_{\\odot}\\;<M_{\\rm stars}<10^{10}M_{\\odot}\\;10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_stars end_POSTSUBSCRIPT < 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 10 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT), Bordoloi et al. (2014) observed halo carbon masses exceeding the carbon masses in the ISM and stars, implying that considerable quantities of heavy elements are expelled into the CGM in these events. A metal-rich halo in IC 1613 is also shown by Zheng et al. (2020). Cosmological simulations that include the multiphase ISM, star formation, and stellar feedback find large inflow and outflow rates in the CGM of dwarfs, with a net inflow of gas from the IGM (Li et al., 2021). The inflow rates are comparable to the SFRs in the disks (see Section 6.2), suggesting that the two are coupled. Significant blow-out can also change the gravitational potential in the disk as gas outflows redistribute mass, causing stars and dark matter to scatter outward (El-Badry et al., 2016) and converting a cuspy dark matter center to a core (Governato et al., 2012).\n\n2.2.3 Thickness\n\nDwarf irregular galaxies are generally considered to be disk galaxies, but their disks are thicker relative to their sizes than in spirals by a factor of 2 to 5 (Brinks et al., 2002, Patra, 2020). This is true for stars (Hodge & Hitchcock, 1966, Johnson et al., 2017), gas and dust (Walter & Brinks, 1999, Dalcanton et al., 2004, Roychowdhury et al., 2010, Elmegreen & Hunter, 2015), and particularly for dwarfs supported more from turbulence than rotation (Kaufmann et al., 2007, Wheeler et al., 2017). Less massive dwarfs are apparently puffier than more massive dwarfs (Johnson et al., 2017). In a study of H i power spectra, Zhang et al. (2012a) found that LITTLE THINGS dwarfs with absolute magnitudes MVsubscriptùëÄùëâM_{V}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUBSCRIPT brighter than ‚àí14.514.5-14.5- 14.5 are relatively thinner than lower mass dwarfs.\n\nThe H i in dIrrs also flares or warps more than in spirals (Kepley et al., 2007, Patra et al., 2014, Szotkowski et al., 2019, Patra, 2020). For example, Banerjee et al. (2011) determined H i scale heights for four dIrrs in the THINGS sample. One of the dwarfs has a scale height of about 450 pc throughout the disk, while the other three flare beyond 3‚Äì4 disk scale lengths to as high as 1 kpc scale height. Flaring is to be expected in most galaxies because the gas velocity dispersion remains approximately constant at large radii while the disk surface mass density declines exponentially. Deep H i and HŒ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± mapping of an edge-on dwarf by Kamphuis et al. (2011) found both neutral atomic and ionized gas well above the plane of the galaxy: HŒ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± gas extends to 655 pc and H i to 1.8 kpc. In a study of 23 LITTLE THINGS dwarfs, Patra (2020) found that scale heights rise exponentially with radius from a few hundred parsecs around the centers to a few kpc at the edges. These thicknesses yield a median axial ratio that is three times that of the Milky Way and allow stellar radiation to transfer more effectively through the disks of dIrrs than in denser spirals.\n\nPower spectra of the LMC H i reveal a slope transition at ‚àº100similar-toabsent100\\sim 100‚àº 100 pc scale that suggests an H i disk of this thickness, with two-dimensional turbulence on larger scales having a shallow slope and three-dimensional turbulence on smaller scales having a steeper slope (Elmegreen et al., 2001). The steep part goes to larger scales in the outer regions, suggesting a flare (Szotkowski et al., 2019).\n\nThere are consequences of a thick gas disk on the ability of the dIrrs to form stars. Relatively thick disks diminish radial instabilities by diluting the radial component of the gravitational force per unit surface density (Vandervoort, 1970). Three-dimensional processes should be relatively more important (Elmegreen & Hunter, 2015, Bacchini et al., 2020). For example, Elmegreen (2011) note that, for a given column density, a thick disk inhibits the instabilities that can lead to cloud formation, and Elmegreen & Hunter (2015) developed a star formation law based on 3D gaseous gravitational processes and molecule formation that is more appropriate to dIrrs.\n\n2.3 Turbulence\n\nH i linewidths are the result of thermal and bulk motions from turbulence and massive stellar feedback. Characterization of the H i motions have used third and fourth-order moments, i.e., skewness and kurtosis of the line profiles. Burkhart et al. (2010) compared observations of the SMC to simulations and determined that 90% of the H i motions are sub- or transonic. The exception is for supersonic motions around the edges of the bar. Maier et al. (2017) applied this technique to the LITTLE THINGS galaxies and found that turbulent speeds were close to sonic. In a study of 6 dwarfs using H i power spectra, Dutta et al. (2009) found that several showed 2D turbulence on scales larger than the scale-height and others showed 3D turbulence.\n\nWhat drives turbulence in galaxies? Given the obvious energetic feedback from massive stars, turbulence might be expected to come from this feedback energy. Inversely, we might expect turbulence to compress the gas and initiate new star formation. The hierarchical clustering in both space and time of young stars, associations, and clusters in the LMC and nearby spiral galaxies suggests that turbulence helps make star-forming clouds (Efremov & Elmegreen, 1998, Grasha et al., 2017, Miller et al., 2022). The velocity dispersion in the ionized gas seems to be the result of thermal motions combined with young stellar feedback (Moiseev et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, spatial correlations between star formation and the kinetic energy density (KED) of the neutral ISM are not obvious. For example, Hunter et al. (2021a) cross-correlated KED images with SFR density Œ£SFRsubscriptŒ£SFR\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_SFR end_POSTSUBSCRIPT images of LITTLE THINGS dwarfs and found no correspondence. They further compared the excess KED above the radial average with the excess Œ£SFRsubscriptŒ£SFR\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_SFR end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and again found no correlation. In addition, the excess velocity dispersion in star-forming regions is small. A similar study of THINGS spirals found the same result (Elmegreen et al., 2022). Their conclusion was that stellar feedback energy mostly disrupts molecular clouds without affecting H i turbulence on large scales. Similarly, Stilp et al. (2013b) compared H i KED measures to time-resolved star formation histories and concluded that the KED correlates only with star formation from 30‚Äì40 Myrs ago, the lifetime of the lowest mass supernova progenitor. On the other hand, L. Hunter et al. (2022) found in four nearby dIrrs that on scales of 400 pc, H i turbulence correlates with star formation from 100‚Äì200 Myrs ago.\n\nThere are other candidates to drive turbulence in the ISM of galaxies, this being an issue for all disk galaxies, not just dwarfs. Klessen & Hennebelle (2010) suggest from simulations that radial accretion is able to drive turbulent motions in spiral galaxies if the accretion rate is comparable to the SFR, especially in the outer disk. However, in dwarfs the accretion rate would have to be much larger than the SFR, so other sources of turbulence are needed. Stilp et al. (2013a) examined various potential drivers, such as star formation, gravitational instabilities, magneto-rotational instabilities, and accretion and concluded that none is capable of driving turbulence in low Œ£SFRsubscriptŒ£SFR\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_SFR end_POSTSUBSCRIPT regions, such as dIrrs.\n\n2.4 Cold HI\n\nThe ISM of dIrrs, like that of spirals, is multiphase with a cold neutral medium (CNM, T‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº40‚Äì200 K in the Milky Way) embedded in a warm neutral medium (WNM, T‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº5000‚Äì8000 K) (e.g., Andersen & Burkert, 2000). Bialy & Sternberg (2019) show, however, that the characteristics of the multiphase medium depend on the metallicity. At very low metallicities of 10‚àí3superscript10310^{-3}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT‚Äì10‚àí2superscript10210^{-2}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPTZùëçZitalic_Z‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTthe cooling rate decreases as metallicity decreases while the heating rate is nearly independent of the metallicity, resulting in a need for higher pressures and densities to form a CNM phase.

Interestingly, at moderate metallicities >0.1‚Å¢Zabsent0.1ùëç>0.1Z> 0.1 italic_Z‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT, the CNM may be colder.\n\nCold H i may be more important to a galaxy than the total H i since the cold H i is more directly connected to star formation (Ianjamasimanana et al., 2012). Even the tiny dIrr Leo T has a cool H i component in its ISM (Ryan-Weber et al., 2008). However, observationally there are differences between the cold H i contents in dIrrs and spirals. In a study of the cold H i in the SMC through absorption spectra, Dickey et al. (2000) found that it constitutes only 15% of the total H i, which is about half that in the solar neighborhood. However, much of this gas is in dense, ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº10‚Äì40 K, clouds that would be molecular if they were in the Milky Way. Dempsey et al. (2022) found a cold gas fraction of 11% in the SMC. We return to this point in Section 4.1.4.\n\nSeveral studies have examined cold H i in dIrrs by deconvolving the H i line profiles into broad (œÉ‚àº10similar-toùúé10\\sigma\\sim 10italic_œÉ ‚àº 10 km s‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT; warm) and narrow (œÉ‚àº2‚àí5similar-toùúé25\\sigma\\sim 2-5italic_œÉ ‚àº 2 - 5 km s‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT; cold) components. Young & Lo (1996, 1997) and Young et al. (2003) examined the H i in 7 nearby dIrrs and found that the cold component was generally concentrated in a few 106superscript10610^{6}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTclumps. One dwarf, LGS 3, which is notable for having no H ii regions, lacked a cold phase altogether. However, no correlation was found between the quantity of cold H i and the SFR, and not all cold H i is associated with star forming regions (see also Begum et al., 2006). Park et al. (2022) fit cool and warm, bulk (i.e., following the rotation curve) and non-bulk H i to the line profiles in NGC 6822 and found fractions of only 3.8% and 0.8% for the cool-bulk and cool-non-bulk components, the rest being warm H i. Using H i power spectra applied to channel maps of LITTLE THINGS dIrrs, Zhang et al. (2012a) found that most of the cool H i is in the inner disks, although the thermal dispersion of the coolest H i component is smaller than 1.8 km s‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, the channel resolution of the data, making this gas hard to detect (see Section 4.1.4). Cold H i has even been found in the Magellanic Bridge from absorption studies (Kobulnicky & Dickey, 1999).\n\n2.5 Relationship of H i to Star Formation and the Stellar Disk\n\nIn dIrrs the azimuthally-averaged surface density of star formation follows the drop with radius of the stellar surface density better than the gas surface density, even though the gas is the material for star formation (Hunter & Elmegreen, 2004, Leroy et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the general relationship between atomic H i and star formation is captured in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relationship Œ£SFR‚àù(Œ£gas)nproportional-tosubscriptŒ£SFRsuperscriptsubscriptŒ£gasùëõ\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}\\propto(\\Sigma_{\\rm gas})^{n}roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_SFR end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àù ( roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_gas end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_n end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT with n‚àº1.3¬±0.3similar-toùëõplus-or-minus1.30.3n\\sim 1.3\\pm 0.3italic_n ‚àº 1.3 ¬± 0.3 (Schmidt, 1959, Kennicutt, 1989) where surface density is measured globally or in kpc-size regions. This relationship was established for spiral galaxies, but Bigiel et al. (2010) extended it to the outer parts of spirals and dwarfs, regimes of lower SFR and lower gas densities. They found that the relationship in these extreme regimes is steeper (n‚àº1.7similar-toùëõ1.7n\\sim 1.7italic_n ‚àº 1.7) than in the inner parts of spirals and the star formation efficiency (the rate per unit gas) is lower. On the other hand, a molecular version of the Kennicutt-Schmidt Law shows that Œ£SFR‚àùŒ£H2proportional-tosubscriptŒ£SFRsubscriptŒ£subscriptùêª2\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}\\propto\\Sigma_{H_{2}}roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_SFR end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àù roman_Œ£ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in both spirals and dwarfs (Schruba et al., 2011).\n\nHow far out in radius and how low in gas density can the SFR go? Hunter et al. (2016) identified the most remote young stellar regions, observable as FUV knots, in 37 LITTLE THINGS galaxies. They found regions with ages under 20 Myrs out to 1‚Äì8 disk scale lengths, where the minimum H i surface density was about 1 M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTpc‚àí22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT. Taylor & Webster (2005) suggested that galaxies with masses >106absentsuperscript106>10^{6}> 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTin gas will form stars until the radiation field heats and stabilizes it (but see J0139+++4328 with 8√ó1078superscript1078\\times 10^{7}8 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 7 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTof gas and no observed stellar component, Xu et al., 2023).

The problem with star formation in dIrrs is that the gas densities are low, even in the central regions, and there are no spiral density waves to pile gas up. What mechanisms could make density enhancements in order to form clouds? An important way to make clouds in spiral galaxies is through gravitational instabilities, which are quantified in terms of the ratio of a critical gas density to the actual gas density, QùëÑQitalic_Q (Toomre, 1964). QùëÑQitalic_Q is a function of the epicyclic frequency, and so a function of the rotation curve. Gas densities above the critical gas density on large scales are unstable and will break up into clouds; gas below the critical gas density is stable. Hunter et al. (1998) found that the H i gas is stable almost everywhere in dIrrs. In NGC 2366, for example, the star-forming regions are associated with H i peaks that are close to the critical density even though the average surrounding gas density is below it (Hunter et al., 2001). However, unseen molecular gas, i.e., gas that is not clearly associated with CO emission (see Section 4.1.4), could make the ISM more unstable (Hunter et al., 2019).\n\nThere are other processes for producing gas density enhancements that could be important in dwarfs: stellar feedback, turbulence, and external gas accretion. As discussed in Section 2.2.2, feedback from massive stars can pile gas into shells and trigger the formation of a next generation of stars (see Figure 3). This process does take place in dIrrs, but only a small percentage (<15absent15<15< 15%) of the star formation in each galaxy is located in obvious shells (Bolds, 2020). Turbulence is another way to make density enhancements that become self-gravitating, but there is no direct evidence for particular star-forming events triggered in this way (see Section 2.3). On the other hand, cloud-cloud collisions may be considered a form of turbulence, and there are many examples suggesting cloud collisions trigger star formation (see review in Fukui et al., 2021). It has also been proposed that accretion of gas from the CGM or IGM furthers star formation (see, for example, simulations by Li et al., 2021), but, again, there is no observational evidence for wide-spread accretion of this sort onto dwarfs (or spirals; however, see the example of tadpole galaxies in Section 6.2). Star formation is a local process that depends on global conditions (Hunter, 2008) but aside from the formation of giant shells, we have yet to find observational evidence for what processes are most important in initiating the local conditions that are the first step to making star-forming clouds. Perhaps cloud formation is from a combination of processes that are difficult to recognize at the initial stages.\n\nBecause stars form out of the gas, we expect that features in the stellar disk would be accompanied by changes in the gas disk. One feature of stellar disks of both spirals and dwarfs is that the stellar surface brightness profiles frequently show a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù, where the exponential fall-off with radius abruptly changes slope (for example, in dwarfs see Herrmann et al., 2013). In most disks the bend is downward (Type II) but in some it is upward (Type III). Few disks show no break (Type I). For dIrr galaxies these surface brightness breaks are also present in stellar mass density profiles. So what happens at the break? There is no correlation between the H i surface density or features of the gas rotation curves and the location of the break (Hunter et al., 2021b). Currently, we do not understand the connection between the breaks in stellar exponential disks and the star formation and gas characteristics.\n\n3 STAR-FORMING REGIONS AND IONIZED GAS\n\nMost dIrr galaxies have H ii regions where star formation takes place and dense clouds are ionized by young massive stars. The H ii region luminosity function is a power law for dIrrs as it is for spirals, but the power law is shallower in dIrrs (slope‚àº‚àí1.5¬±0.1similar-toabsentplus-or-minus1.50.1\\sim-1.5\\pm 0.1‚àº - 1.5 ¬± 0.1 for those with turnovers or ‚àº‚àí1¬±0.1similar-toabsentplus-or-minus10.1\\sim-1\\pm 0.1‚àº - 1 ¬± 0.1 for those without) than in spirals (‚àº‚àí1.9similar-toabsent1.9\\sim-1.9‚àº - 1.9) (Youngblood & Hunter, 1999, Thilker et al., 2002, Oey et al., 2003). Also, the upper luminosity cutoffs are lower in dIrrs, which do not often have supergiant H ii regions. However, nearby dIrrs do frequently have complexes of smaller H ii regions compared to nearby spiral galaxies. In fact most of the HŒ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± luminosity from H ii regions comes from regions that are smaller than 10 times the Orion nebula. Fourier transform power spectra of dIrr HŒ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± emission, taken along the major axes, have revealed a universal slope inside H ii regions that is consistent with Kolmogorov turbulence (Willett et al., 2005). Cormier et al. (2015) also found that H ii regions in dwarfs have harder radiation fields than in spirals due to the impact of lower metallicity on stellar emission, specifically main sequence temperatures are hotter due to reduced line blanketing and blocking in stellar atmospheres (Madden et al., 2006).\n\nIn addition, dIrrs, like spirals, contain diffuse ionized gas (DIG) outside of H ii regions. Analysis of the DIG in 14 dIrrs by Martin (1997) showed that most of the DIG is photoionized by massive stars in star forming regions and is a result of the porosity of the ISM in these galaxies (see also Polles et al., 2019, Hidalgo-G√°mez, 2007). Choi et al. (2020) showed that the fraction of ionizing photons escaping the galaxy is about 25% for NGC 4214. Multiphase modeling of the ISM of dwarfs by Ramambason et al. (2022) (see also Cormier et al., 2019) showed that the structure and porosity varies with metallicity. The escape fraction of ionizing photons goes up as the metallicity goes down, with escape fractions reaching as high as 60%. This suggests that dIrrs and similar systems could provide ionizing photons to the IGM to be a source of reionization in the early universe (Enders et al., 2023).\n\nIn some dIrrs there are also embedded star-forming regions that radio continuum or IR observations have revealed (for example Hindson et al., 2018). NGC 5253 contains a large H ii region and massive star cluster with thousands of O-type stars that are detected in 7 mm continuum and near-IR (Turner & Beck, 2004). Mid-IR observations of NGC 1569 have revealed an embedded compact source that is optically thick in the radio and may contain nearly a thousand O-type stars (Tokura et al., 2006). Centimeter radio observations of NGC 4449 have revealed numerous thermal radio sources with ages less than 5 Myr and stellar masses of order 104superscript10410^{4}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT(Reines et al., 2008, Calzetti et al., 2023). These are all large star-forming regions found in small galaxies with high SFRs.\n\nCoronal line emission has been found in dwarfs as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with the dwarfs preferentially having emission lines with the highest ionization potentials (Reefe et al., 2022). These emission lines could come from central black holes with hotter accretion disks than those around supermassive black holes in spiral galaxies. Bohn et al. (2021) identified 5 galaxies at the massive end of the dwarf range with coronal line emission that is likely due to AGNs accompanied by outflows, and Hatano et al. (2023) have found the signature of a dust torus around a massive black hole in the dwarf SBS0335-052E. The relative population of AGNs in dwarfs and the effect of AGN activity on their ISM are not known.\n\n4 MOLECULAR GAS\n\n4.1 Observations\n\nIn the Milky Way we see that star formation takes place in clouds of molecular gas. For that reason, molecular gas is crucial to the evolution of galaxies. For the reasons outlined below, observations of molecular gas in dIrrs have been very difficult.\n\n4.1.1 Early Discoveries\n\nCO is weak in low metallicity galaxies. It took over a decade longer to detect CO in the SMC (Israel et al., 1986) than in the LMC (Huggins et at., 1975) with metallicities of 0.2‚Å¢Z‚äô0.2subscriptùëçdirect-product0.2Z_{\\odot}0.2 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and 0.5‚Å¢Z‚äô0.5subscriptùëçdirect-product0.5Z_{\\odot}0.5 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, respectively. Early low-resolution surveys (Cohen et al., 1988, Rubio et al., 1991) and high resolution maps (Israel et al., 1993, Rubio et al., 1993a, b) of the Magellanic Clouds eventually demonstrated the influence of metallicity, dust, and UV radiation on CO emission. Lequeux et al. (1994) concluded that the CO parts of dense cloud complexes in the SMC shrink to the inner cores while H i and possibly H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT surround them. This is still the primary model at low metallicity, discussed now in terms of elevated ratios of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT column density to integrated CO line strength, XCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, and molecular surface density to integrated CO line strength, Œ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, or, equivalently, molecular mass to CO luminosity.\n\nThe third dIrr detection, NGC 1569, was made with the 14-m telescope at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory by Young et al. (1984). This galaxy was soon followed by NGC 3738, NGC 4214, and NGC 4449 (Tacconi & Young, 1985), and six more, including 3 BCDs, in a survey of 15 dIrrs by Tacconi & Young (1987). At the same time, CO in IC10 was discovered by Henkel et al. (1986) with the 7-m telescope at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and mapped in 5 points by Ohta et al. (1988) with the 45-m telescope of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO). The first detection in a galaxy smaller than the LMC (other than the SMC), NGC 3077, was made with the 30-m IRAM telescope by Becker et al. (1989).\n\n{marginnote}\n\n[] \\entryXCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPTRatio of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT column density to integrated CO line strength. \\entryŒ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPTRatio of average molecular surface density to integrated CO line strength or molecular mass to CO luminosity for unresolved clouds.\n\nLarger early surveys included NGC 6822 by Wilson (1992), who used the NRAO 12-m telescope, 13 BCDs and 2 dIrrs by Sage et al. (1992) with IRAM, NGC 6822 and NGC 4214 by Ohta et al. (1993) with NRO, He 2-10 by Baas et al. (1994) with the 15-m SEST telescope and by Kobulnicky et al. (1995) with the first CO interferometry using Owens Valley Radio Observatory. A few more dIrrs by Israel et al. (1995) with SEST and NRAO telescopes, in addition to [C ii] observations of IC 10 by Madden et al. (1997) with NASA‚Äôs Kuiper Airborne Observatory, led these authors to conclude that significant H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT in dIrrs was unseen.\n\nIn the two decades since these early discoveries, there have been many observations of molecules of various types in dIrrs. In the first large survey, Leroy et al. (2005) searched for CO(1-0) in 121 galaxies of average dynamical log mass ‚àº9.6similar-toabsent9.6\\sim 9.6‚àº 9.6 (in M‚äôsubscriptùëÄdirect-productM_{\\odot}italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and detected 28; the lowest-mass detections were NGC 5338 (Hubble type SB0) and NGC 3913 (Sc). Schruba et al. (2012) observed 16 local dwarfs in CO(2-1) and detected 5 by stacking the spectra. Cormier et al. (2014) surveyed 6 dwarfs in several CO transitions and detected 5, all with metallicities above that of the SMC; their one galaxy with SMC-type metallicity, NGC 4861, was undetected.\n\nThe most recent SMC surveys are in Salda√±o et al. (2023) at 9 pc resolution and Ohno et al. (2023) at 2 pc. Ohno et al. found that molecular clouds in the SMC have a mass spectrum similar to that of the Milky Way, with a slope for d‚Å¢N/d‚Å¢MùëëùëÅùëëùëÄdN/dMitalic_d italic_N / italic_d italic_M equal to ‚àº‚àí1.7similar-toabsent1.7\\sim-1.7‚àº - 1.7, and they have slightly narrower linewidths for their size, œÉv‚àº0.5‚Å¢R0.5similar-tosubscriptùúéùë£0.5superscriptùëÖ0.5\\sigma_{v}\\sim 0.5R^{0.5}italic_œÉ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_v end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àº 0.5 italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for radius RùëÖRitalic_R in pc and velocity dispersion œÉùúé\\sigmaitalic_œÉ in km s‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, compared to ‚àº0.7‚Å¢R0.5similar-toabsent0.7superscriptùëÖ0.5\\sim 0.7R^{0.5}‚àº 0.7 italic_R start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 0.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT in the Milky Way.

These are larger than in the Milky Way by factors of 2.4 and 6.5.\n\n4.1.2 The Lowest Metallicities\n\nCO has been mapped in only a few galaxies with metallicities comparable to or lower than that of the SMC. The observations are summarized in what follows with an emphasis on unique features for each galaxy. Generally, pc-scale observations are necessary to resolve individual CO clouds, which tend to be much smaller than their CO-dark envelopes and generally a few pc in size. If we consider the large-scale gas concentrations to be composite clouds, then the ratio of this cloud mass to the mass of the CO-luminous part can be in the hundreds for dIrrs ‚Äì even larger for the lowest metallicities, suggesting extensive peripheral gas unobserved in H i, H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT, or CO. This peripheral gas is still visible in other forms, such as dust or [C ii] emission (see below), but it is not as prominent in CO as it is in the Milky Way. Nevertheless, the CO parts of low-metallicity clouds are very similar to scaled-down versions of CO clouds elswehere: they have comparable densities and extinctions, and they are close to virialized.\n\nShrinking CO cores inside dense cloud complexes can be characterized by variations in the CO(1-0)-to-H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT conversion factor.

The first way allows one to consider undetected gas surrounding the CO source, as in a cloud envelope with CO in the core.\n\nDerivations and caveats with the conversion factors are discussed in Section 4.2. These factors tend to increase with decreasng metallicity, clumpiness, and increasing physical scale, as the CO-emitting gas becomes a smaller fraction of the total. They also increase with specific star formation rate (sSFR), as the excess FUV photons penetrate further into the cloud envelopes, disassociating the molecules more (Sect. 4.2.3).

(2020), the ratio of the CO luminosity to the SFR is consistent with the others for its metallicity.\n\nAmong these nine dIrrs, four have been observed with a spatial resolution of several parsecs (NGC 6822, NGC 2366, WLM, Sex B), three have clear detections on spatial scales of several hundred pc, and two have marginal detections on these larger scales. For the high resolution observations, the CO clouds have sizes of only a few parsecs; in three of them, the average CO cloud mass is several √ó103‚Å¢M‚äôabsentsuperscript103subscriptùëÄdirect-product\\times 10^{3}\\;M_{\\odot}√ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and in the fourth (NGC 2366) the average mass is ‚àº105‚Å¢M‚äôsimilar-toabsentsuperscript105subscriptùëÄdirect-product\\sim 10^{5}\\;M_{\\odot}‚àº 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Also for the high-resolution observations, the CO cloud densities and extinctions are adequate for molecular excitation and survival, and the cloud sizes and linewidths lie close to the relationship for the Milky Way.\n\nIt is not clear from these observations how small clouds in the more quiescent dIrrs make massive stars, which must be present to explain the HŒ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ± emission and the feedback that produces giant shells. Small clouds apparently also make star clusters up to several hundred solar masses, which are present in these galaxies as well. The much larger molecular mass in Kiso 5639 is presumably what allows such regions to make super star clusters and perhaps globular clusters in the early universe.\n\n4.1.3 Molecules in Other Dwarf Galaxies\n\nDwarf galaxies with metallicities higher than that of the SMC tend to have more CO emission per unit molecular mass and cloud structure approaching that in the Milky Way, where the CO parts of most clouds have relatively small molecular envelopes and H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT is present without CO in the denser diffuse regions (Lee et al., 2012).\n\nIn the LMC, the Columbia (Cohen et al., 1988), NANTEN (Fukui et al., 2008), and MAGMA (Hughes et al., 2010) CO(1-0) surveys at resolutions of 130 pc, 40 pc, and 8 pc, cataloged 40, 272, and 175 GMCs, respectively, finding XCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT factors from 3 to 6 times higher than in the Milky Way using the virial theorem. The clouds have slightly narrower linewidths for their sizes than in the Milky Way but the mass spectrum is the normal power law (see also Brunetti & Wilson, 2019). Herrera et al. (2013) measured XCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT more precisely by converting the dust emission into a gas mass in the N11 star-forming region and comparing that to CO luminosity and cloud virial mass. Chevance et al. (2020) mapped the FIR lines toward 30 Doradus and applied a photodissociation region (PDR) model to determine the total molecular gas mass. They found that 75% of the molecular gas mass is not traced by CO.\n\nIndividual clouds in the LMC are not much different from Milky Way clouds. Naslim et al. (2018) used ALMA to observe clouds in the N55 region at 0.67 pc resolution and found them to be in virial equilibrium with an XCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT factor about twice the Milky Way value. Wong et al. (2019) showed that the CO linewidths in 6 LMC clouds increase with 8Œºùúá\\muitalic_Œºm radiation intensity and surface density for a given size. Dense gas emission from HCO+{}^{+}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT + end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT and HCN correlates with star formation as in other galaxies (Galametz et al., 2020, Nayana et al., 2020). In the 50 pc region around the 30 Doradus star-forming complex, Wong et al. (2022) mapped CO(2-1) and 1313{}^{13}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPTCO(2-1) with ALMA at 0.4 pc resolution and found virialized clumps in filamentary structures (see also Indebetouw et al., 2013, Anderson et al., 2014). In the southern part of the molecular ridge below 30 Doradus, Finn et al. (2021) observed quiescent CO clumps and found a correlation between cloud density and the presence of young stars.\n\nIn other local dwarfs with metallicities of a few tenths solar or higher, especially in dwarf starbursts and mergers, CO is a good diagnostic for interstellar pressure and star formation feedback. Dwarf mergers (Section 6.1) can have bright CO emission with higher localized star formation activity than normal spirals. For example, Kepley et al. (2016) mapped CO(3-2) and CO(2-1) in the merger II Zw 40 (0.25‚Å¢Z‚äô0.25subscriptùëçdirect-product0.25Z_{\\odot}0.25 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, 10 Mpc) at 24 pc resolution and found several clouds with one containing significant star formation. The clouds have higher linewidths for their sizes than Milky Way clouds, corresponding to higher gas surface densities and pressures from the merger. Consiglio et al. (2016) also mapped CO(3-2) and CO(1-0) in II Zw 40 at 20 pc resolution, and they mapped 870Œºùúá\\muitalic_Œºm dust emission. They found that the DGR varies with position by a factor of ‚àº4similar-toabsent4\\sim 4‚àº 4, with higher values closer to the starburst as a result of dust production by large numbers of massive stars. Gao et al. (2022) studied CO(1-0) and [C i] in the merger starburst Haro 11 (‚àº0.27‚Å¢Z‚äôsimilar-toabsent0.27subscriptùëçdirect-product\\sim 0.27Z_{\\odot}‚àº 0.27 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, 87.2 Mpc) at 460 pc resolution, and measured elevated sSFRs and star formation efficiencies in the active clumps, with values comparable to those in high redshift galaxies and local ULIRGS. In the starburst Haro 2 (0.3‚Å¢Z‚äô0.3subscriptùëçdirect-product0.3Z_{\\odot}0.3 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, 21 Mpc), which may not be a recent merger, Beck et al. (2020) observed CO(2-1) at 200 pc resolution and found that half the molecules are in two large clumps with embedded star formation and the other half are in an expanding X-ray bubble.\n\nThe large impact that gas accretion can have on dwarf galaxies (Section 6.2) is also evident in CO observations. Beck et al. (2018) observed He 2-10 (0.8‚Å¢Z‚äô0.8subscriptùëçdirect-product0.8Z_{\\odot}0.8 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, 8.7 Mpc) in CO(3-2) with ALMA at 12 pc resolution, finding filaments that seem to be feeding the starburst and another region 25 pc in size with an outflow energy in excess of 1053superscript105310^{53}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 53 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT erg. Imara & Faesi (2019) observed the same galaxy in CO(1-0) and identified 119 virialized clouds with deconvolved sizes of ‚àº26similar-toabsent26\\sim 26‚àº 26 pc and surface densities of ‚àº180similar-toabsent180\\sim 180‚àº 180 MùëÄMitalic_M‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPTpc‚àí22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, resembling Milky Way clouds but with 50% larger linewidths for their size, indicating larger pressures. Miura et al. (2018) observed the nearest starburst dwarf NGC 5253 (Z‚àº0.3‚Å¢Z‚äôsimilar-toùëç0.3subscriptùëçdirect-productZ\\sim 0.3Z_{\\odot}italic_Z ‚àº 0.3 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, 3.15 Mpc) in CO(2-1) at 3 pc resolution with ALMA. NGC 5253 is also accreting molecular gas (Miura et al., 2015). They found 118 molecular clouds with an average radius of 4.3 pc and obtained an XCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT factor about twice the Milky Way value using the virial theorem. Cloud velocity dispersions are a factor of ‚àº3√ó\\sim 3\\times‚àº 3 √ó larger for their size than in the Milky Way in the starburst region, and surface densities are ‚àº3√ó\\sim 3\\times‚àº 3 √ó higher as well, reflecting ‚àº10√ó\\sim 10\\times‚àº 10 √ó higher pressures from cloud gravity.\n\n4.1.4 CO-Dark Gas\n\nAn important uncertainty is the atomic or molecular state of the CO-dark gas that shows up in dust emission or other tracers in the envelopes of CO clouds. It takes about 1 magnitude of optical dust extinction to shield molecular gas from photodissociation (Lee et al. 2018, but see Hunt et al. 2023), and for Milky Way metallicity, this magnitude corresponds to a gas surface density of ‚àº20‚Å¢M‚äôsimilar-toabsent20subscriptùëÄdirect-product\\sim 20\\;M_{\\odot}‚àº 20 italic_M start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT pc‚àí22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT. At lower metallicity, the dust column for one magnitude stays constant, but the gas surface density increases, making a relatively thick photon-dominated region (PDR) (Lee et al., 2015, Schruba et al., 2018) with prominent [C ii] emission (Cormier et al., 2019).\n\nFor example, one can see the large PDR and tiny CO cores in WLM, a Local Group dIrr with an oxygen abundance of 0.13‚Å¢Z‚äô0.13subscriptùëçdirect-product0.13Z_{\\odot}0.13 italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (see Figure 4, Rubio et al., 2015, see also Cormier et al. 2014). The expected reservoir of CO-dark gas at low metallicity compared to a molecular cloud at solar metallicity is sketched in Figure 5.\n\nBecause the envelope is not easily observed in H i, it is usually assumed to be H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT. However, if the mean density is low and feedback photo-dissociation is fast, as Hu et al. (2016, 2021) suggest in their models, or the dissociating radiation comes in through a few low-opacity sightlines (Seifried et al., 2022), then H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT may not have time or opacity to form completely before it is destroyed by young stellar radiation. That would imply much of the peripheral gas is cold H i and hard to detect in H i emission line profiles. Seifried et al. (2022) suggest further that the CO-rich regions also have significant amounts of cold H i, based on simulations of turbulent molecular clouds with time-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer.\n\nH i line profiles in dwarf galaxies have been fit to cool and warm components without finding much cool H i (see Section 2.4). For example, Koch et al. (2021) suggested that optically thick (‚Äútop hat‚Äù) profiles in M31 and M33 result from multiple components and not cold H i self-absorption. There is little systematic evidence for H i self-absorption from local cold H i either, i.e., surrounding molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood (Reach et al., 2017, Murray et al., 2018). An exception is in Hayashi et al. (2019), who suggest on the basis of total gas observations through Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaitalic_Œ≥-ray emission that local CO-dark gas may in fact be optically-thick H i. For the LMC, the ratio of cold H i from self-absorption to total cloud mass, using XCO=4√ó1020subscriptùëãCO4superscript1020X_{\\rm CO}=4\\times 10^{20}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 4 √ó 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 20 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm‚àí22{}^{-2}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 2 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT (K km s‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT)‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT to get the cloud mass from CO, is only ‚àº10‚àí3similar-toabsentsuperscript103\\sim 10^{-3}‚àº 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (Liu et al., 2019).\n\nUsing a different method, Togi & Smith (2016) found that the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT excitation temperature is reasonably approximated by a power law and then NIR observations of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT emission, which sample only the high-excitation lines, can be extrapolated to total H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT content. With this method applied to 5 dIrrs, they found agreement between the extrapolated H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and the total gas masses inferred from dust emission and SFRs, which implies the CO-dark envelopes are H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT.\n\nEvidently, the molecular state of the CO-dark envelopes in dwarf galaxies is uncertain. Possibly, the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT fraction changes with spatial scale (Seifried et al., 2022), being lower for poorly resolved CO envelopes in dwarf galaxies than highly resolved CO envelopes in the local ISM. Alternatively, the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT formation rate could be higher than assumed in the simulations as a result of additional processes on grain surfaces (Wolfire et a., 2022) or a larger dynamic range for density.\n\n4.2 Molecular Conversion Factor\n\nIn the Milky Way CO is used as a tracer of the H2subscriptùêª2H_{2}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT which makes up the bulk of molecular clouds. A conversion factor has been determined which, when applied to the CO measurement, gives the total molecular gas mass. Unfortunately, this conversion factor is expected to be a function of metallicity and possibly other environmental factors, and has been very hard to pin down for dwarf galaxies. Here we discuss the methods for determining the conversion factor at low metallicity and the problems with those values.\n\n4.2.1 Methods\n\nAs illustrated in Section 4.1.2, various strategies have been developed to quantify the reservoir of CO-dark gas. One method assumes the observed CO represents the whole cloud and the mass is given by the virial theorem for the observed size and velocity dispersion. This virial mass is then divided by the luminosity to produce Œ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (Wilson, 1995). This method cannot determine the envelope mass if it is not observed in CO and the envelope radius and velocity dispersion are not known. However, one might be able to assume that the CO cloud boundary pressure is determined by the weight of the overlying (invisible) envelope and derive the envelope column density from that. Contributions to the virial theorem from magnetic energy should be included too.\n\nIn another method, the dust mass in a cloud is derived from a fit of dust temperature, emissivity, and luminosity to multi-band FIR observations, and combined with a DGR previously calibrated for the appropriate metallicity from other observations. The observed cloud is presumably defined by the region of high FIR emission, so the ratio of the dust mass in this region to the DGR is the total gas mass in the cloud. Then the H i and ionized gas masses should be subtracted from the total cloud mass to determine the molecular part, which would include the CO part in the core.\n\nThere are several uncertainties with the dust mass method. The dust emissivity depends on the grain composition, size, and temperature distributions, which may vary between dense and diffuse gas, and the fit to dust mass depends on the completeness of the SED and the applied SED model. The DGR depends linearly on metallicity for values near the Milky Way, but becomes non-linear at low metallicity (see also Section 5.4, and Meixner et al., 2013, Jameson et al., 2016, 2018, for issues associated with dust-based estimates of total H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT). DGR measurements done elsewhere also have uncertainties about dark gas, and the DGR may vary from place to place in a galaxy (e.g., Hu et al., 2023).\n\nAlternatively, one can use [C ii] to infer Œ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. [C ii] comes from PDRs where far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons ionize weakly bound atoms like Carbon, which has an ionization potential of 11.3 eV (Nordon & Sternberg, 2016). In a typical cloud, the CO core that traces the densest H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT is surrounded by a PDR, which grows in size with decreasing metallicity (e.g. Bolatto et al., 2013). Early KAO observations of the [C ii]Œª‚Å¢158ùúÜ158\\lambda 158italic_Œª 158Œºùúá\\muitalic_Œºm line in IC 10 and the LMC found high L[C‚Å¢II]delimited-[]Cnormal-II{}_{\\mathrm{[C\\,{\\sc II}]}}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT [ roman_C smallcaps_II ] end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT/LCO‚Å¢(1‚àí0)CO10{}_{\\mathrm{CO(1-0)}}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT roman_CO ( 1 - 0 ) end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ratios, suggesting substantial CO-dark gas (Poglitsch et al., 1995, Madden et al., 1997, Israel & Maloney, 2011). Herschel and SOFIA extended these results, highlighting the diagnostic capabilities of [C ii] as a tracer of CO-dark gas in the LMC, SMC (e.g., Requena-Torres et al., 2016, Jameson et al., 2018, Lebouteiller et al., 2019, Chevance et al., 2020) and NGC 4214 (Fahrion et al., 2017). With Herschel [C ii] and ALMA CO observations of the SMC, Jameson et al. (2018) found that CO emission with the Milky Way value of Œ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT traces only 5% ‚Äì 60% of the gas associated with CO; CO/[C ii] increases with AVV{}_{\\mbox{{\\tiny V}}}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT V end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT, confirming that [C ii] emission extends beyond the CO cores.\n\nThe Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS; Madden et al., 2013) observed a suite of FIR and MIR fine structure emission lines, including [C ii], in 50 star-forming dwarf galaxies. These observations allowed detailed PDR and photoionization modeling (Cormier et al., 2015, 2019), setting up a strategy to quantify the total dark gas using [C ii]. For example, Cormier et al. (2019) showed that the PDR covering factor increases with metallicity, and [C ii] is mainly in the PDRs. Madden et al. (2020) and Ramambason et al. (2023) used this strategy to conclude that CO traces a small fraction of the star-forming gas in dwarf galaxies, while [C ii] traces more than 70% of the total molecular gas, most of it being the CO-dark gas.\n\nAs for the dust method, there is an uncertainty with the [C ii] method in that the emission can come from diffuse H i and ionized gas as well as the envelopes of CO cores (Ramambason et al., 2023). If particular clouds are to be measured, such as the clouds associated with CO, then maps of the dust or [C ii] concentrations are needed to define the cloud boundaries. If the total dark gas mass is desired instead, i.e., regardless of association with CO or star formation, then the total mass from dust minus the mass of the CO cores derived from the Milky Way value of Œ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT should give about the same result as the total mass from [C ii], which is presumably not present in CO cores because of their high opacity to FUV. The [C ii] method is currently used for high-zùëßzitalic_z galaxies to infer the total H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT mass (e.g., Zanella et al., 2018).\n\nA related method is to observe carbon in all of its important forms, i.e., [C i], [C ii] and CO, and to use the abundance of carbon relative to hydrogen to get the total hydrogen mass. Subtracting the H i mass then gives H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT. Pineda et al. (2017) do this for the Magellanic Clouds and find substantial amounts of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT without CO, and that in H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT-dominant regions, most of the carbon is in the form of [C ii].\n\n4.2.2 Observations\n\nCO-dark molecular envelopes have been observed in dust emission, [C ii], and [C i], and they have been inferred from the virial theorem using the size and CO linewidth in the region. For a resolved CO cloud, the mass derived by these methods divided by the CO luminosity should be similar to the Œ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT of the Milky Way (Rubio et al., 1993a), i.e., independent of metallicity down to at least the SMC value (Bolatto et al., 2008). This similarity arises because the CO-dark envelope is mostly avoided when the CO cloud core is measured directly, and CO cores at low metallicity resemble CO clouds in the Milky Way (Section 4.1.2).\n\nRecent observations of the increase in Œ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with decreasing metallicity for local dwarf galaxies are in Leroy et al. (2011), Schruba et al. (2012), Hunt et al. (2015), Amor√≠n et al. (2016), Shi et al. (2016), Accurso et al. (2017), Hunt et al. (2020), Madden et al. (2020), Hunt et al. (2023) and Ramambason et al. (2023). Similar studies at high redshift show the same inverse relationship, although not generally to such low metallicities (Genzel et al., 2012). Of these studies, only Hunt et al. (2015, 2020), Shi et al. (2016) and Ramambason et al. (2023) apply their modeling to observations of galaxies with metallicities as low as ‚àºsimilar-to\\sim‚àº 0.1 Z‚äôsubscriptùëçdirect-productZ_{\\odot}italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. Considering the small number of such galaxies with CO detections, the scaling of Œ±CO‚Å¢(Z)subscriptùõºCOùëç\\alpha_{\\rm CO}(Z)italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_Z ) is not well constrained (see review in Bolatto et al., 2013).\n\nUsing the DGS observations and single Cloudy models, Madden et al. (2020) found an Œ±COsubscriptùõºCO\\alpha_{\\rm CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT well-correlated with metallicity and very steeply rising toward low ZùëçZitalic_Z. Also using the DGS data but with a statistical Bayesian framework to account for the structure of the unresolved gas with multiple components and a clumpy distribution of CO, Ramambason et al. (2023) found a wide scatter of Œ±C‚Å¢Osubscriptùõºùê∂ùëÇ\\alpha_{CO}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_C italic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT that is correlated with CO clumpiness also. A steep relationship for Œ±C‚Å¢O‚Å¢(Z)subscriptùõºùê∂ùëÇùëç\\alpha_{CO}(Z)italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_C italic_O end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_Z ) corresponds to a more diffuse CO source while a flatter relationship found for some dwarf galaxies corresponds to more clumpy CO structures.\n\nSubmm transitions of [C i] have also been used as tracers of CO-dark gas in observations as well as theory and simulations (e.g., Papadopoulos et al., 2004, Offner et al., 2014, Li et al., 2018, Jiao et al., 2019). Glover & Clark (2016), Heintz & Watson (2020) and Ramambason et al. (2023) show that [C i] is an excellent tracer of total MH2H2{}_{\\mbox{{\\tiny H${}_{2}$}}}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT H start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT in their models and that the conversion factor depends on metallicity approximately as Z‚àí1superscriptùëç1Z^{-1}italic_Z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.\n\n4.2.3 Theory\n\nTheoretical discussions and models of Œ±CO‚Å¢(Z)subscriptùõºCOùëç\\alpha_{\\rm CO}(Z)italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_Z ) in Wolfire et al. (2010) and Krumholz et al. (2011) consider uniform spherical clouds with dust extinction and grain-surface formation of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT to derive an envelope opacity and from this the CO-to-H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ratio. The resulting fractional abundance of CO depends on the fractional abundance of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT.

A magneto-hydrodynamical simulation of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT and CO formation by Glover & MacLow (2011) finds a comparably strong scaling of Œ±CO‚àùAV‚àí3.5proportional-tosubscriptùõºCOsuperscriptsubscriptùê¥V3.5\\alpha_{\\rm CO}\\propto A_{\\rm V}^{-3.5}italic_Œ± start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚àù italic_A start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_V end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 3.5 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT down to Z/Z‚äô=0.03ùëçsubscriptùëçdirect-product0.03Z/Z_{\\odot}=0.03italic_Z / italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.03. These results agree with observations in Hunt et al.

Additional hydrodynamic simulations are in Shetty et al. (2011); a recent detailed non-equilibrium chemical model of the ISM is in Katz (2022).\n\nBialy & Sternberg (2015) determined the relative abundances of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT, CO and other important molecules from a detailed chemical network. Bialy & Sternberg (2016) then examined dust opacity at the molecular transition, which is where the rate of H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT formation, typically on dust, balances the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT photo-dissociation rate in the Lyman Werner bands. Because the radiation field is attenuated by both H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT photo-dissociation and dust, metallicity plays a role in determining the fraction of the incident photons that dissociate H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT. The mass surface density of the shielding layer has an additional dependence on the inverse of metallicity from the DGR, making the H i envelopes of the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT regions even more massive at lower metallicity. Schruba et al. (2018) found good agreement between these models and observations of H i in metal-poor galaxies.\n\nHu et al. (2016) modeled cold and warm H i and cold H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT in a whole dwarf galaxy with metallicity Z/Z‚äô=0.1ùëçsubscriptùëçdirect-product0.1Z/Z_{\\odot}=0.1italic_Z / italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.1. They found large H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT fractions, 25% to 70%, in diffuse (non-star-forming) gas for the models with feedback, and small H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT fractions for these models in the star-forming gas, defined to be where the density exceeds 100 cm‚àí33{}^{-3}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT. The cold gas lies 3 to 10 times closer to the midplane than the warm gas because of its higher density and radiative shielding closer to the plane. Much of the gas with density >100absent100>100> 100 cm‚àí33{}^{-3}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT is cold H i because feedback disrupts the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT in their models. In further studies, Hu et al. (2021) simulated the ISM with star formation in collapsing clouds for a galaxy patch 1 kpc square and 10 kpc high using metallicities ranging from 0.1 to 3 ZùëçZitalic_Z‚äôdirect-product{}_{\\odot}\\;start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT. They found that the SFR is independent of metallicity, and, like their previous result, the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT is often out of equilibrium and at low relative abundance because of its long formation time. CO is less affected by the low H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT abundance, however, making the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT-to-CO ratio low in the cloud envelopes. Whereas the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT fraction was high in the CO regions, it decreased to low values, <0.1absent0.1<0.1< 0.1, in the CO-free molecular cloud periphery. At Z/Z‚äô=0.1ùëçsubscriptùëçdirect-product0.1Z/Z_{\\odot}=0.1italic_Z / italic_Z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ‚äô end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = 0.1, more than 40% of the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT was in peripheral cloud gas with minimal CO and an H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT fraction less than 10%. Hu et al. (2022) discussed these results explicitly in terms of the XCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT factor: on large scales surrounding CO cores, molecular H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT exists but with lower XCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT than calculated from equilibrium models, and on the small scale of the CO region, dust opacity is high enough to make the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT fraction high regardless of metallicity, and then XCOsubscriptùëãCOX_{\\rm CO}italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT approaches the Milky Way value.\n\nHirashita & Harada (2017) and Hu et al. (2023) calculated XCO‚Å¢(Z)subscriptùëãCOùëçX_{\\rm CO}(Z)italic_X start_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_CO end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_Z ) for various metallicities, including dust evolution in the DGR. While Hu et al. continue to model non-equilibrium chemistry, Hirashita & Harada (2017) note that the H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT formation time can be less than the free fall time for densities exceeding ‚àº103similar-toabsentsuperscript103\\sim 10^{3}‚àº 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm‚àí33{}^{-3}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, and thus H22{}_{2}start_FLOATSUBSCRIPT 2 end_FLOATSUBSCRIPT is assumed to reach equilibrium in their models. This difference arises because the formation time scales inversely with density for a given DGR, being a collisional process, while the free fall time scales inversely with the square root of density, driven by self-gravity.
