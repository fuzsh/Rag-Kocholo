In an earlier section, it was explained how astronomers first accomplished this exceedingly difficult task for the nearby galaxies during the 1920s. Until the late decades of the 20th century, progress was discouragingly slow. Even though increased attention was being paid to the problem around the world, a consensus was not reached. In fact, the results of most workers fell into two separate camps, in which the distances found by one were about twice the size of the other’s. For this reason, shortly after its launch into Earth orbit in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was assigned the special task of reliably determining the extragalactic distance scale. Led by the Canadian-born astronomer Wendy Freedman and the American astronomer Robert Kennicutt, the team used a considerable amount of the HST’s time to measure the properties of the Cepheid variable stars in a carefully selected set of galaxies. Their results were intermediate between the two earlier distance scales. With subsequent refinements, the scale of distances between the galaxies is now on fairly secure footing.\n\nThe HST distance scale project established the scale of distances for the nearby universe. Establishing the distances to galaxies over the entire range of present observations (several billion light-years) is an even more difficult task. The process involved is one of many successive steps that are all closely tied to one another. Before even the nearby galaxy distances measured by the HST can be established, distances must first be determined for a number of galaxies even closer to the Milky Way Galaxy, specifically those in the Local Group. For this step, criteria are used that have been calibrated within the Milky Way Galaxy, where checks can be made between different methods and where the ultimate criterion is a geometric one, basically involving trigonometric parallaxes, especially those determined by the Hipparcos satellite. These distance criteria, acting as \"standard candles,\" are then compared with the HST observations of galaxies beyond the Local Group, where other methods are calibrated that allow even larger distances to be gauged. This general stepwise process continues to the edge of the observable universe.\n\nThe Local Group of galaxies is a concentration of approximately 50 galaxies dominated by two large spirals, the Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy (see table). For many of these galaxies, distances can be measured by using the Cepheid P-L law, which has been refined and made more precise since it was first used by American astronomer Edwin Hubble. For instance, the nearest external galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, contains thousands of Cepheid variables, which can be compared with Cepheids of known distance in the Milky Way Galaxy to yield a distance determination of 160,000 light-years. This method has been employed for almost all galaxies of the Local Group that contain massive-enough stars to include Cepheids. Most of the rest of the members are elliptical galaxies, which do not have Cepheid variables; their distances are measured by using Population II stars, such as RR Lyrae variables or luminous red giants.\n\nMembers of the Local Group of galaxies\n\n*Naked-eye object; known since antiquity.\n\nname of galaxy type dimensions\n\n(light-years) distance\n\n(106 light-\n\nyears) year of\n\ndiscovery WLM Irr 11,000 x 3,600 3.1 1909 IC 10 Irr 4,600 x 4,000 2.15 1889 Cetus dwarf E4 3,700 x 3,200 2.54 1999 NGC 147 E5 9,400 x 5,900 2.15 1829 Andromeda III E 3,200 x 2,200 2.48 1970 NGC 185 E3 9,100 x 7,800 2.15 1787 M110 E5 14,000 x 9,000 2.48 1773 Andromeda VIII dSph 35,000 x 7,900 2.7 2003 M32 E2 7,900 x 5,300 2.48 1749 Andromeda Galaxy Sb 200,000 2.48 964 Andromeda I E 1,900 2.64 1970 Small Magellanic Cloud Irr 16,000 x 9,100 0.20 * Andromeda IX dSph 4,200 2.90 2004 Sculptor dwarf E3 3,400 x 2,600 0.29 1937 LGS 3 Irr 1,500 2.64 1978 IC 1613 Irr 13,600 x 12,600 2.35 1906 Andromeda X dSph 5,900 2.90 2005 Andromeda V dSph 1,800 2.64 1998 Andromeda II E 2,300 x 1,600 2.22 1970 M33 Sc 60,000 2.58 1654 Phoenix dwarf Irr 1,900 x 1,600 1.30 1976 Fornax dwarf E3 1,600 x 1,400 0.46 1938 UGCA 92 Irr 2,700 x 1,400 4.70 1974 Large Magellanic Cloud Irr 31,000 x 26,000 0.16 * Carina dwarf Irr 2,200 x 1,500 0.33 1977 Canis Major dwarf Irr 5,200 0.03 2003 Leo A Irr 3,300 x 2,000 2.25 1966 Sextans B Irr 7,000 x 4,800 4.70 1966 NGC 3109 Irr 21,000 x 3,800 4.50 1835 Antila dwarf E3 2,700 x 2,000 4.60 1985 Leo I E3 2,300 x 1,800 0.82 1950 Sextans A Irr 6,900 x 5,800 4.00 1942 Sextans dwarf E3 7,700 x 5,500 0.29 1990 Leo II E0 2,400 x 2,200 0.69 1950 GR 8 Irr 2,800 x 2,200 7.90 1946 Ursa Minor dwarf E5 2,300 x 1,500 0.20 1954 Draco dwarf E3 3,900 x 2,400 0.26 1954 Milky Way Galaxy Sb/c 144,000 * SagDEG E7 5,400 x 14,000 0.10 1994 SagDIG Irr 3,200 x 2,300 3.85 1977 NGC 6822 Irr 7,300 x 6,400 1.63 1884 Aquarius dwarf Irr 2,100 x 1,100 3.10 1966 Tucana dwarf Irr 2,400 x 1,000 2.84 1990 UKS 2323-326 Irr 2,100 x 1,600 4.70 1978 Andromeda VII dSph 1,600 x 1,300 2.25 1998 Pegasus dwarf Irr 3,600 x 1,900 2.48 1958 Andromeda VI dSph 8,300 x 2,600 2.54 1998\n\nBeyond the Local Group are two nearby groups for which the P-L relation has been used: the Sculptor Group and the M81 Group. Both of these are small clusters of galaxies that are similar in size to the Local Group. They lie at a distance of 10 to 15 million light-years.\n\nOne example of an alternate method to the Cepheid P-L relationship makes use of planetary nebulae, the ringlike shells that surround some stars in their late stages of evolution. Planetary nebulae have a variety of luminosities, depending on their age and other physical circumstances; however, it has been determined that the brightest planetary nebulae have an upper limit to their intrinsic brightnesses. This means that astronomers can measure the brightnesses of such nebulae in any given galaxy, find the upper limit to the apparent brightnesses, and then immediately calculate the distance of the galaxy. This technique is effective for measuring distances to galaxies in the Local Group, in nearby groups, and even as far away as the Virgo Cluster, which lies at a distance of about 50 million light-years.\n\nOnce distances have been established for these nearby galaxies and groups, new criteria are calibrated for extension to fainter galaxies. Examples of the many different criteria that have been tried are the luminosities of the brightest stars in the galaxy, the diameters of the largest H II regions, supernova luminosities, the spread in the rotational velocities of stars and interstellar gas (the Tully-Fisher relation), and the luminosities of globular clusters. All of these criteria have difficulties in their application because of dependencies on galaxy type, composition, luminosity, and other characteristics, so the results of several methods must be compared and cross-checked. Such distance criteria allow astronomers to measure the distances to galaxies out to a few hundred million light-years.\n\nBeyond 100 million light-years another method becomes possible. The expansion of the universe, at least for the immediate neighbourhood of the Local Group (within one billion light-years or so), is almost linear, so the radial velocity of a galaxy is a reliable distance indicator. The velocity is directly proportional to the distance in this interval, so once a galaxy’s radial velocity has been measured, all that must be known is the constant of proportionality, which is called Hubble’s constant. Although there still remains some uncertainty in the correct value of Hubble’s constant, the value obtained by the HST is generally considered the best current value, which is very near 25 km/sec per one million light-years. This value does not apply in or near the Local Group, because radial velocities measured for nearby galaxies and groups are affected by the Local Group’s motion with respect to the general background of galaxies, which is toward a concentration of galaxies and groups of galaxies centred on the Virgo Cluster (the Local Supercluster). Radial velocities cannot give reliable distances beyond a few billion light-years, because, in the case of such galaxies, the observed velocities depend on what the expansion rate of the universe was then rather than what it is now. The light that is observed today was emitted several billion years ago when the universe was much younger and smaller than it is at present, when it might have been expanding either more rapidly or more slowly than now.\n\nTo find the distances of very distant galaxies, astronomers have to avail themselves of methods that make use of extremely bright objects. In the past, astronomers were forced to assume that the brightest galaxies in clusters all have the same true luminosity and that measuring the apparent brightness of the brightest galaxy in a distant cluster will therefore give its distance. This method is no longer used, however, as there is too much scatter in the brightness of the brightest galaxies and because there are reasons to believe that both galaxies and galaxy clusters in the early universe were quite different from those of the present."
