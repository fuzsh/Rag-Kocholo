        "text": "You ask:\n\nhow did quantum leap come to mean a sudden and conspicuous change?\n\nIn physics, a quantum jump is an instantaneous1 change of a quantum system from one state to an entirely different2 state. So the meaning of \"sudden and conspicuous\" is not very much of a leap at all from the scientific definition.\n\nThe meaning of \"large\" really isn't justified by the scientific meaning, but it's easy to see how \"sudden and conspicuous\" could acquire the implication of \"large\".\n\n1 If you're a philosopher of quantum mechanics, you can argue over whether a quantum jump is really instantaneous, or whether it just appears to be so.\n\n2 Here, the technical term in quantum mechanics for entirely different is orthogonal.\n\nQuantum does not mean \"small and discrete\", it only means \"discrete\", as in \"quantisation\" - fitting values into a discrete defined set. For instance in mathematics the operation of \"rounding\" quantises fractions into the set of integers.\n\nSimilarly in electronics, sampling signals quantises them into a discrete digital value.\n\nYou have the connotation of \"small\" because quantum physics coincidentally mostly deals with very small things - the smallest divisions (or quanta) of matter.\n\nA quantum leap, however, has the connotation of large, because a leap covers a large distance. However it is quantum, so cannot be further divided within the context that it is used.\n\nFor instance the United States could have all its coordinates quantised to within the individual states. A step from the center of one state to the center of a neighbouring state is quite a large distance, but it is only a change of one quanta.\n\nSo a quantum leap is a discrete change from one state (not a US state now) to the next state, with the connotation that the states involved are big and cover a large \"area\".\n\nAnother good way of thinking about it is a staircase. Each step is a quanta. The bigger the steps the bigger the leap to get to the next one.\n\nA good synonym is also \"step change\"."
