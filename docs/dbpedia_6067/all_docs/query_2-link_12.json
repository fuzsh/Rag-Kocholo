        "text": "This is a (perhaps surprisingly) complex question. The short answer is that it's a widely-held axiom that no naturally-spoken languages are more or less complex than others, but solid proof of this is lacking.\n\nThe earliest mention of this principle I've been able to find comes from Wilhelm von Humboldt in the 1800s, who claimed that \"all [languages] contain all that is rigorously needed not only for the correctness, but the perfection of expression\". Since then it's gradually spread, reaching the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1955 and now appearing in all the introductory linguistic textbooks I've checked; Chomsky takes this as a tenet of some of his theories (that languages \"ought to\" have the same budget for markedness even if they spend it in different ways), and that certainly hasn't hurt its popularity. (See Joseph and Newmeyer 2012 for more historical details here.)\n\nA persistent difficulty, though, is defining what exactly \"complexity\" means. Various studies have tried and generally failed. Shosted 2006 says equal complexity is \"a claim that has been, until fairly recently, more a matter of dogma than of science\", while Maddieson 2005 suggests that \"[s]uch a view seems to be based on the humanistic principle that all languages are to be held in equal esteem and are equally capable of serving the communicative demands placed on them. In rejecting the notion of 'primitive' languages linguists seem to infer that a principle of equal complexity must apply.\"\n\nPellegrino et al 2011 conclude that \"the assumption of an 'equal overall complexity' is ill-defined\" and try to find an alternative. Specifically, they suggest that \"[l]anguage is actually a communicative system whose primary function is to transmit information. The unity of all languages is probably to be found in this function, regardless of the different linguistic strategies on which they rely.\" There are mathematical ways to measure information density, so this is much easier to actually quantify, and indeed Coupé et al 2019 had a striking breakthrough in this regard—they were able to show what Pellegrino et al weren't, that languages do seem to transmit the same amount of information per second, even if they do so in different ways.\n\nBut…you've mentioned several things that, intuitively, seem to make a language more complex, and it's easy to see things that cause difficulty for second-language learners. Is information transmission rate really the same thing as complexity? Unclear. Coupé et al's result has been popularly taken as evidence of equal complexity, but studies that try to actually quantify this complexity have generally failed to get decisive results. Studies suggest that infants learn all languages at about the same rate (though I don't have a good citation on hand), but does that actually have anything to do with the complexity of the language? The jury is still out.\n\nPersonally, I would say that Coupé et al's information transmission rate results are telling. These results suggest that evolutionary pressures push all languages to transmit information at the optimal rate for the communication channel they use. I suspect if there were really dramatic differences in complexity between languages, these same evolutionary pressures would smooth them out—after all, languages need to be learned in order to be used. But without a good, quantitative measure of \"complexity\", it's hard to actually put these claims to the test.\n\nAlso the English language has changed a lot in the past 50 years, do we included grammar from the past into our current analysis? I don't know?\n\nEnlgish has not changed much in a fundamental way in the last 50 years (what language has?). It has some new words and some influence from substrates such as AAVE that aren't yet widely accepted as standard. But anyway, no need to complicate the analysis by including historical versions of the languages. :)\n\nFrench verbs can be very difficult. You have to account for gender inflection and verb conjugations which seem to inflect with every pronoun.\n\nYou don't have to account for gender in French verbs, except for participles probably 5% of the time (90% of all statistics being made up on the spot). But yes, you do have to account for number and, in the plurals, you have to account for person. Most verbs have 4 audibly different forms: singular and 1st, 2nd, 3rd person plural.\n\none thing that is nice is that French doesn't have as many irregular verbs as English so there is a lot of consistency\n\nEnglish irregulars are not very irregular. Usually they have different past participle and/or preterite (e.g. drive/drove/driven). French irregulars tend to obscure the original form, which can be hard for learners, but there are certainly patterns (e.g. in the classic pouvoir/vouloir/devoir series). Funny enough, English and French each have two suppletive verbs and they have parallel meanings: go and be in English and aller and être in French.\n\nEnglish past tense is highly irregular with bizarre conjugations like \"sit\" and \"sat\"\n\nArguably not more bizarre than pouvoir / pu. But it should be noted that in both languages, these are a tiny minority of the verbs.\n\nphrasal verbs that you practically need to memorize (\"stand in/stand up/stand out\" all mean completely different things, \"stand up\" specifically has multiple meanings.)\n\nThis is a good point; English prepositions do a lot of work. While both languages are very particular about which prepositions are most natural, in English there's a much greater risk of them dramatically changing the meaning.\n\nFrench nouns and adjectives conjugate with gender while English adjectives don't\n\nOne might argue that as long as a language has any agreement, its complexity is at a certain level. English actually has more genders (3) than French (2). But we apply them to very few words; just about all inanimate nouns are neuter. This makes the memorization burden much greater in French.\n\nAs Draconis pointed out, one has to define complexity before one can know whether \"I have to memorize the gender of 20,000 words, or at very least a dozen endings that allow me to predict most words\" makes the language itself more complex; but I would argue that it does add quite a lot to the list of things a non-native speaker has to acquire.\n\nOne remark to make in response is that a mistake in gender almost never changes the meaning, whereas number does. Number agreement is present in both English and French, but is actually not marked in spoken French most of the time. That this presents a difficulty can be seen in the fact that French speakers who learn English frequently make mistakes in number.\n\nThat also raises a core question about complexity. Which is more complex: If a language has two different forms for two different concepts, requiring the speaker to know how to use both? Or if a language has only one form, requiring the listener to deal with the ambiguity? Is the fact that je serai and je serais are pronounced the same a help or a hindrance to learners of French?\n\nEnglish has more words and synonyms than in French and there seem to be more ways to creatively and specifically express oneself.\n\nIndeed, English has a much larger vocabulary by standard counts. While one can easily communicate with a subset of either language, this variety can make reading more of a challenge.\n\nI find advanced sentence structures seems to be difficult in English, both have strict and inflexible word order systems but English goes overboard with things like adjective order and the use of when to use articles feels almost random in English.\n\nMost of the syntax is surprisingly parallel. Adjective order is not more complex in either language, to my knowledge. One thing that's used more often by English speakers than by French speakers is the passive voice.\n\nI agree that articles can be pretty difficult in English, and like prepositions, they can change the meaning in interesting ways. For example, in French, « Les ours grondent » serves equally well for a statement about particular bears and for bears in general. But in English you need to express these differently: \"The bears are growling\" vs. \"Bears growl\". A French speaker in our French SE chatroom remarks that knowing when to use the zero-article in English is a challenge.\n\nEnglish has more ways to express possesion ( 'S genitive/Of/Mine) than French.\n\nTrue, and we can construct some quite difficult phrases (not always universally accepted), such as \"the king of England's territory\" where a learner might perceive ambiguity in parsing. That said, you can construct similar phrases in French.\n\nFrench's uses reflexive pronouns way more than in English.\n\nReal semantic reflexives (translatable by \"self\") are probably about as common in both languages. But French has a lot of pronominal verbs like se rendre or s'en aller. This is another case where it's not really more complex, because the pronoun is just built into the lexical item like any other verb to a French speaker, but at the same time it poses a problem for learners because the analysis is harder.\n\n(This one may be bias) I have heared better French as second language speakers than English as second language speakers on average. This could be due to a lot of reasons though.\n\nYeah, that probably is bias. How much more likely are we to notice errors in people speaking our native language than in people speaking our second language?\n\nAlso, I find that most native speakers place a lot of weight on accent in their evaluation of someone else's skill, even though accent is a tiny part of learning a language (that is, producing the sounds just right; you certainly have to be able to distinguish them). Accent is also one of the hardest things to perfect and one of the easiest things to be oblivious to in your second language. It takes almost no time for a native speaker to judge someone non-native because of tiny differences in articulation.\n\nEnglish has a progressive verb tense that French lacks.\n\nYeah, and this also visible in the example with \"The bears are growling\" vs. \"Bears growl\". On the other hand, French can insist on progressive aspect with « être en train de » or « en ce moment », which are pretty easy to use, and the English rules for using and conjugating progressive are also easy to explain. (Meanwhile, the difference in meaning between imparfait and passé composé is nigh impossible to pin down!)\n\nBoth have difficult subjunctive moods but French's is way more difficult.\n\nOrally it's not too bad. For most verbs, just pronounce the final consonant for je/tu/il or insert an \"i\" into nous/vous. But combined with other tenses you can get some very difficult ones (which French speakers themselves don't always employ perfectly), such as eusse + participe passé. Also, the English subjunctive is in much greater danger of disappearance. So I think this is more of a challenge in French.\n\nthere are so many pronouns in French and they change so often\n\nAnother case (no pun intended) where we do at least have the foundations of the distinction being made: he/him vs. il/le/lui and so forth. French does have more unique forms, but the total is still fairly low. I find that after a year, students are more tripped up by the sentence order of pronouns than by the choice of pronoun.\n\nFrench spelling has its issues but is still much more logical and consistant than English.\n\nYes, French spelling is much more regular, although English speakers have a hard time with all the silent letters. English is not as bad as people think, as for example in Shaw's \"ghoti\" joke which only works as a joke because its point is wrong (we all know it can't be pronounced as he says, and we know that because English is regular). The worst thing in English is not cough/through/bough, which are very much a finite and memorizable set, but multi-character vowels with ambiguous readings, like tear/tear/fear/bear, read/read/bead/bread and so on. Extremely few French words or combinations of letters have unpredictable pronunciations; the exceptions, like fils, tous, est, ville, are just that, exceptions.\n\nBoth languages have very difficult forms of formality, both are generally pretty similar (light sentence inversion etc.)\n\nNotably, we don't have a tu/vous distinction, which affects a lot of things in every sentence. Remembering to call someone \"Mr. Lastname\" is technically easier than switching between tu/vous. This is more of a cultural thing, though; a culture could come up with any number of complex ways to use its language to express formality.\n\nthe difference seems to be all over the place between English and French.\n\nYup.\n\nI have found that many English as a second language speakers like to flex about how \"easy\" English is when in reality I personally find that both languages are easy and hard in their own ways. In terms of learning French is a harder language to start with\n\nThis is probably true. To add to Draconis' answer, I think that while we can theoretically argue about the complexity of a language till the cows come home, the question of how hard a language is to learn is easier to answer — if only because Western culture has given us a rich corpus of language tests that provide the criteria for us! But yes, linguists tend to concede that there are differences in ease of acquisition of a given target language based on which source language you're coming from.\n\nAnd why is the language's complexity so tied to its worth.\n\nGood question, with the possibility of a deep and broad answer looking into attitudes towards language superiority dating from the 16th century onward in the West. The question of expressivity, poeticness, regularity, subtlety, sophistication, etc. has been endlessly asked, and the answer is always subjective and almost always motivated by politics.\n\nThis is my own perception as a non-native speaker of French, but: One thing unique to French is that it is one of the most normative languages in the world. If a language is a dialect with an army and a navy, French has a nuclear arsenal protecting it. It has the Académie française; it has draconian language laws in Canada (where restaurant owners have been known to be legally forced to write \"poisson cru\" instead of \"sushi\"); it has the organization of the Francophonie; it has comparison to « la langue de Molière », whereas we English speakers don't compare ourselves with Shakespeare when evaluating our eloquence...\n\nThe culture of France and many former colonies has been imbued with the idea of the language's perfection and the need to keep it so. What's incredible is how much impact it has in people's self-correction and social correction. While English speakers have similar prescriptivist thoughts, e.g. in Johnson's preface to his dictionary, we don't tend to reach for \"sophisticated\" as the first way to describe our language (we'd probably prefer \"expressive\"), and many people regard those who make it their duty to correct others not as people saving the language, but as \"grammar Nazis\" (to use an outdated term). This difference is corroborated by the Francophone jlliagre's answer.\n\nSimilarly, the many accents of England are celebrated as part of its charm (cf. Pygmalion) whereas the Académie worked hard to stamp out the various « patois » of France.\n\nBoth languages have plenty of pedants, but French culture normalizes the idea of a correct language in a way that, I think, reaches the average person more deeply than English culture does for us. This probably contributes to your friend's sense that he can get along fine in his broken English, while even minor mistakes in French are flagrant offences."
