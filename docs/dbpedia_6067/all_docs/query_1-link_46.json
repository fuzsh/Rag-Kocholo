These courses offer students an opportunity to explore scientific and engineering domains that can influence their effectiveness as computer scientists upon graduation.\n\nRequirements for this component of the degree are listed under the SCS main page under General Education Requirements.\n\nHumanities and Arts\n\nAll candidates for the bachelor's degree in Computer Science must complete a minimum of 63 units offered by the College of Humanities & Social Sciences and/or the College of Fine Arts. Some courses from the Tepper School of Business also qualify for this requirement. These courses offer students breadth in their education and perspectives and provide students with a better appreciation of social, artistic, cultural, political and economic issues that can influence their effectiveness as computer scientists upon graduation.\n\nRequirements for this component of the degree are listed under the SCS main page under General Education Requirements.\n\nRequired Minor or Concentration\n\nStudents completing the bachelor's degree in Computer Science must complete either a minor outside of SCS or a concentration within SCS. A minor is a sequence of (typically 5-6) courses within a particular department to give students a core of a specific discipline but not an entire major of study. Refer to the sections for other CMU colleges for details about available non-SCS minors. An SCS concentration is a sequence of (typically 4-5) courses within an SCS department to give students further depth in specific areas of research important to SCS. SCS concentrations are available only to SCS students and assume that these students have a significant core knowledge in Computer Science including 15-210, 15-213 and 15-251. See the SCS Concentrations section for a list of available concentrations and their requirements. Completion of an additional major (or dual degree) also satisfies this requirement. Students should consult with their academic advisor to plan for their desired minor or concentration starting in the sophomore year.\n\nDouble Counting\n\nIn general, courses taken in satisfaction of the minor or additional major may also count toward any general education category in the CS major (i.e. courses outside of the Computer Science and Mathematics requirements). Double counting toward Computer Science and Mathematics courses in the CS major is strictly limited and depends on the chosen minor (or additional major). In general, students may double count at most 5 of the 12 core Computer Science requirements toward all other declared additional majors and minors. Additional majors and minors have their own double counting rules as well. Consult with a CS undergraduate advisor and an advisor from the department of the minor (or additional major) for specific restrictions on double counting.\n\nComputing @ Carnegie Mellon (1 course)\n\nThe following course is required of all students to familiarize them with the campus computing environment:\n\n99-101Computing @ Carnegie Mellon3\n\nFree Electives\n\nA free elective is any Carnegie Mellon course. However, a maximum of nine (9) units of Physical Education and/or Military Science (ROTC) and/or Student-Led (StuCo) courses may be used toward fulfilling graduation requirements.\n\nSummary of Degree Requirements:\n\nAreaCoursesUnitsComputer Science (core courses, constrained electives, and SCS electives)12125Mathematics658Technical Communication19Science/Engineering436Humanities/Arts763Minor or Concentration Requirement/Free electivesVaries63Computing @ Carnegie Mellon13First Year Seminar13360\n\nSample Course Sequence\n\nThe sample given below is for a student who already has credit for introductory programming and one semester of calculus. Students with credit for two semesters of calculus may start with a more advanced math class (e.g. 21-241) in their first year. Students with no credit for introductory programming and/or one semester of calculus will take 15-112 and/or 21-120 in their first semester and shift a few courses to later semesters after consulting with their academic advisor; these students should still be able to complete their degree in four years. It is recommended that students keep their academic load lighter for their Senior Fall semester to account for offsite job interviews or for their Senior Spring semester to account for visits to graduate schools.\n\nFreshman Year:\n\nFall Units 07-128First Year Immigration Course3 07-131Great Practical Ideas for Computer Scientists\n\n(optional, not required for CS major)2 15-122Principles of Imperative Computation12 15-151Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science\n\n(if not offered, substitute 21-127)12 21-122Integration and Approximation10 76-101Interpretation and Argument9 99-101Computing @ Carnegie Mellon3 51\n\nSpring Units 15-150Principles of Functional Programming12 15-213Introduction to Computer Systems12 21-259Calculus in Three Dimensions10 9 9 52\n\nSophomore Year:\n\nFall Units 15-210Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms12 21-241Matrices and Linear Transformations11 9 9 9 50\n\nSpring Units 15-251Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science12 9 9 9 9 48\n\nJunior Year:\n\nFall Units 15-451Algorithm Design and Analysis12 9 9 10 9 49\n\nSpring Units 12 9 9 9 9 48\n\nSenior Year:\n\nFall Units 9 9 9 9 36\n\nSpring Units 9 9 9 9 36\n\nMinimum number of units required for the degree:360\n\n*The flexibility in the curriculum allows many different schedules, of which the above is only one possibility. Some elective courses are offered only once per year (Fall or Spring). Constrained electives (probability, logic/languages, software systems, artificial intelligence and domains) may be taken in any order and in any semester if prerequisites are met and seats are available. Constrained electives are shown in the specific semesters in the schedule above as an example only. Students should consult with their academic advisor to determine the best elective options depending on course availability, their academic interests and their career goals.\n\nUndergraduate Research Thesis\n\nCS majors may use the SCS Honors Research Thesis as part of their degree. The SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis (07-599) typically starts in the fall semester of the senior year, and spans the entire senior year. Students receive a total of 36 units of academic credit for the thesis work, 18 units per semester. Up to 18 units can be counted toward CS elective requirements (9 per semester for 2 semesters maximum). Students interested in research may also consider using Research and Innovation in Computer Science (07-300, 9 units) as their technical communications requirement in their junior year since this course will introduce students to various research projects going on in the School of Computer Science that may lead to a senior thesis. This course leads to a subsequent Research Practicum in Computer Science (07-400, 12 units) that allows students to complete a small-scale research study or experiment and present a research poster. Students who use 15-400 to start their senior thesis can use these units toward the required 36 units.\n\nFor more information about the SCS Honors Research Thesis, refer to the SCS Honors Research Thesis section for learning objectives, application requirements and expected outcomes.\n\nDual Degree in Computer Science\n\nStudents wishing to pursue a Dual Degree in Computer Science are required to apply in the same way as students wishing to transfer into the Computer Science major. Details are given in the SCS Policies section. Besides the student's primary degree requirements, a student accepted for Dual Degree in CS is required to complete at least 450 units in total and meet all requirements for the CS major including all general education requirements (humanities/arts and science/engineering). Dual degree students do not need to complete 15-128, and these students will replace 15-151 with either 21-127 or 21-128. Since the CS major requires at least a minor or concentration in another area, the student's primary major will substitute for this requirement. Note that the primary major must be completed prior to or at the same time as the dual degree in CS to satisfy the minor requirement; a dual degree in CS cannot be certified if the primary degree is not completed. Students should consult with the Assistant Dean in the CS Undergraduate Office and/or their CS academic advisor to review all requirements, once approved.\n\nDouble-Counting Restriction"
