        "text": "Australia is a vast continent with subtle differences in language, use of phrases and pronunciation across the country.\n\nSome South Australians can give themselves away by their pronunciation of certain words (dance, grant) as can some West Australians (beer).\n\nSo, is there a Tasmanian way of speaking?\n\nAn anonymous inquirer posed that question to Curious Hobart and we set out to investigate (you can pose your own question, at the end of this story).\n\nTasmanians tricky to pick\n\nPam Allen, adjunct associate professor in global cultures and languages with the University of Tasmania, said she was of the belief Taswegians \"fit in to a broader kind of Australian accent, which is a kind of slower drawl\".\n\nProfessor Allen said while it \"might be a bit of a stereotype\", she thought Tasmanians tended towards a generic, rural Australian accent.\n\n\"I can't pick a Tasmanian by their accent,\" she said, adding she could often pin other Australians to their home states.\n\n\"Sometimes I can pick a Queenslander, Victorian or South Australian because there are a few inflections.\"\n\nThe differences in dialects between Australian states and territories were reasonably subtle, Professor Allen said: \"Certainly not like accents you'll find when you'll go from one county to the other in England for example.\"\n\n\"It's a pretty big generalisation, but I've been thinking about this for some time as to why British accents remain so strong, even if people move to other parts of England or move to Australia, retaining distinctive Geordie (Newcastle) or Brummie (Birmingham) accents.\n\n\"I wonder if it's because the English or British are less mobile as Australians.\"\n\nA number of distinct Aboriginal dialects existed in Tasmania prior to British settlement, none surviving European colonisation completely intact — however the Palawa kani project has developed a reconstructed composite language, based on recordings and documents.\n\nDrawl among the dipthongs\n\nAs for the refined accents featured in many 1950s and 1960s Tasmanian television and movie reels, Professor Allen attributed those mainly to the reporters and voiceover performers, rather than those interviewed.\n\n\"But the people being interviewed did have quite plummy accents, whether it's because the people being interviewed were largely middle class, who had access to new media,\" she said.\n\nBruce Moore, former director of the Australian National Dictionary Centre, noted in his essay Towards a History of the Australian Accent, Tasmanian peculiarities were noticed as early as 1861, with visitors from New South Wales reporting the \"drawling of the diphthongs … as in maountain for mountain, taown for town, and so on'.\"\n\nDeloraine can do posh, too\n\nDonald Reid, media lecturer at the University of Tasmania, said any discernible modern-day Tasmanian accent was probably more associated with socio-economic status.\n\n\"I'm not an expert on this, but the more affluent and established suburbs of both Hobart and Launceston would have similar accents … probably the working-class suburbs of both cities have similar accents too,\" he said.\n\n\"A Sandy Bay accent has almost a tinge of Englishness about it, I think I would describe it as sort of 'Malcolm Turnbull cadence' to a voice,\" he said.\n\n\"Whereas if you go to the northern suburbs, it's maybe more of a classically Australian accent.\"\n\nDr Reid said in his day-to-day dealings with students on the UTAS campus, he was able to detect subtle differences — but added there were anomalies.\n\nPeople from regional areas could speak \"in a slightly slower\" manner, but others from the same area could have \"quite a posh accent\", Dr Reid said.\n\nHimself a relative newcomer to the island, Dr Reid said colleagues of his, also a mix of long-term Tasmanians and more recent migrants, had noted there was \"something almost, I don't want to say archaic as it sounds a bit pejorative, but something more classically Australian in the Tasmanian accent that might be getting lost in the more contemporary mainland accent\".\n\nHe pointed to American hip-hop culture as influencing the way a lot of young people talk worldwide.\n\n\"Migrant communities, their English has taken on a slightly American twang, and this just doesn't happen in Anglo countries, it happens in Asia as well,\" he said.\n\nBeware the hoop snake\n\nWayne Smith, a Tasmanian historian and toponymist — student of place names — said his view was the manner in which locals pronounce the name of their own town is the \"correct\" pronunciation, irrespective if it varied from the original intent.\n\nHe pointed out the common way of saying Tasmania as differing from the Dutch pronunciation of Tasman (Tuh-smun).\n\n\"I have noticed that the Australian accent is similar to accents currently spoken in Southern England and that is probably because most of the original convicts came from London prisons and prison hulks,\" he said.\n\nMr Smith said the bushfires across Tasmania has led to some in the media fumbling over place names, citing Waddamana (wodda-marna, not wodda-mannah), Miena (my-eena, not my-ennah) and Glendevie (glen-devvie, not glen-deevee) as examples.\n\nLike many places, Tasmania has its own set of colloquialisms, the use of which may assist those keen to identify someone as being from the island.\n\nThe Macquarie Dictionary lists 400 \"regionalisms\" for the Tasmanian area, including:\n\nArks: a corruption of the word \"ask\", which is phonetically spelled \"arsk\"; as in: \"I arksed him where he lived\"\n\nAttack of the flying axe handles: a severe and sudden onset of diarrhoea\n\nBag of death (or death bag): cheap cask wine\n\nBig island: mainland Australia\n\nBridgewater Jerry: the occasional low-lying fog which snakes its way down the River Derwent, past the Tasman Bridge, towards the ocean\n\nCordial: a term which, confusingly, can be applied to both non-carbonated and carbonated flavoured drinks\n\nHoop snake: as with the mythical drop bear, the hoop snake is a non-existent threat used to startle visitors; typically, the hoop snake is described as a reptile with the ability to grab its tail in its mouth and roll after its prey at speed\n\nMainlander: a person from the big island\n\nRum'un: an odd, eccentric person\n\nWith the Tasmanian Government aiming to increase the population by 50,000 by 2050, Professor Allen said it was possible accents could change, but added there needed to be a \"fairly quantum leap in migration numbers for it to have that kind of impact on language\".\n\n\"The impact tends to be the other way, that the incoming population are the ones that adapt their language, rather than the other way round,\" she said."
