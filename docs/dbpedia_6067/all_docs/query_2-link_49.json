        "text": "The status of English as a global language has played a significant role in contemporary language education policies across the world. In East Asia, the hegemony of English has been reflected in a number of central governments&#39; policies of recruiting native English-speaking teachers (NESTs) to participate in English language education. This paper focuses on the NESTs recruitment policies in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan with the aim of examining how teacher professionalism is represented in these policy discourses and how this conceived teacher professionalism impacts on English teaching and learning in these countries. Through the analysis of policy texts and documents, we argue that teacher professionalism has been assigned a different agenda by the governments who subscribe to &quot;native speaker norms&quot; and legitimise unqualified and inexperienced NESTs in the profession of English language teaching (ELT). These anti- professionalism policies have not achieved the ...\n\nIn English language classrooms, students use different approaches to carry out English learning tasks. Language learning styles, which generally refer to learners' preferred modes of language learning, have been widely researched and discussed in the fields of second language acquisition (SLA) and educational psychology. Understanding the learning style preferences of students can help teachers cope with students' course-related learning difficulties and ultimately help alleviate their frustration levels. Another related concept is teaching styles, which refers to teachers' classroom behaviour based on their teaching beliefs, is commonly associated with learning styles in language education research. Many educationalists (Giles, Ryan, Belliveau, De Fritas & Casey, 2006; Razak, Ahmad & Shad, 2007) point out that teaching style is vital for providing students with good learning experiences and improving students' academic outcomes. A number of researchers (Oxford, Holloway & Horton-Murrilo, 1992; Peacock, 2001; Reid, 1987) suggest that learning styles and teaching styles should be matched in order to enhance students' learning motivation. However, some other scholars (Giles et al., 2006; Razak, Ahmad & Shad, 2007; Soliven, 2003) advocate that this may limit students' opportunities to develop their learning styles. This chapter first provides an overview of theories and models related to learning styles and teaching styles in English language classrooms. It then discusses the controversial relationship between learning styles and teaching styles in SLA literature. The chapter concludes with educational implications for enhancing learning experiences in English language classrooms.\n\nNon-native speakers (NNS) of English outnumber native speakers (NS) in the 21 Century (Crystal 2003). This shift points to increasing opportunities for the speaker of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) to use English to communicate not only with NS, but also with NNS of English. How does this globalised phenomenon affect people’s attitudes towards the different varieties of English? This research examines the attitudes of Taiwanese people to different varieties of English: Australian English (AE), General American English (GAE), Indian English (IE), Japanese English (JE), Spanish English (SE), Standard Southern British English (SSBE) and Taiwanese English (TE). Analysis of 317 responses showed an overwhelming preference for the native variety GAE in terms of both status and solidarity, which might result from the fact that GAE is the most commonly used ELT model in Taiwan. Additionally, participants demonstrated different evaluations on the dimensions of status and solidarity: wher..."
