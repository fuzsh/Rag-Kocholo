        "text": "Overview\n\nBiofeedback is a type of mind-body technique you use to control some of your body's functions, such as your heart rate, breathing patterns and muscle responses. During biofeedback, you're connected to electrical pads that help you get information about your body.\n\nYou may not realize it, but when you have pain or are under stress, your body changes. Your heart rate may increase, you may breathe faster, and your muscles tighten. Biofeedback helps you make slight changes in your body, such as relaxing muscles, to help relieve pain or reduce tension. You may be able to decrease your heart rate and breathing, which can make you feel better. Biofeedback can give you the skills to practice new ways to control your body. This can improve a health problem or help make daily activities easier.\n\nTypes of biofeedback\n\nYour health care provider might use different kinds of biofeedback depending on your health problems and goals. Biofeedback types include:\n\nBreathing. During breathing biofeedback, bands are placed around your stomach and chest. Sensors on the bands check your breathing rate and patterns. You can control your breathing and feel better.\n\nBrain waves. During this type of biofeedback, an electroencephalograph (EEG) uses scalp pads to monitor your brain waves. There are certain brain waves that show different mental states, such as relaxation, wakefulness and sleep. With biofeedback training, you can see a change in the brain waves that improve your health.\n\nHeart rate. In this type of biofeedback, pads are placed on your chest, lower trunk or wrists. These pads are connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG) that measures your heart rate and how your heart rate changes. A sensor also can be placed on your finger to measure your heart rate. When you are relaxed, your heart rate may decrease.\n\nMuscle activity. A machine called an electromyograph (EMG) uses sensors to measure muscle tightening. This helps make you aware of muscle tension so you can take steps to control it.\n\nSweat gland activity. Pads attached to the fingers, palm or wrist measure the activity of the sweat glands. The amount of perspiration on your skin warns you of nervousness.\n\nTemperature. Pads attached to your fingers or feet measure blood flow to your skin. Because your temperature often drops when you're under stress, a low reading can prompt you to begin relaxation methods. As you become more relaxed, your fingers and toes may become warmer.\n\nBiofeedback machines\n\nYou can receive biofeedback training in physical therapy clinics, medical centers and hospitals. A growing number of biofeedback machines and programs are being marketed for home use, including:\n\nInteractive computer programs or mobile devices. Some types of biofeedback machines measure physical changes in your body. Changes in your heart rate and skin are measured with pads attached to your fingers or your ear. The measuring pads plug into your computer.\n\nUsing computer pictures and cues, the machines then help you control nervousness by helping you:\n\nManage your breathing.\n\nRelax your muscles.\n\nThink positive things about your power to deal with stress.\n\nStudies show that these types of machines might help in dealing with stress and make you calmer.\n\nAnother type of biofeedback treatment involves wearing a headband that tracks your brain activity while you meditate. It uses sounds to let you know when your mind is calm and when it's active. This may help you learn to control your stress. Every time you do this, the information is stored on your computer or mobile device so you can track your progress over time.\n\nWearable devices. One type involves wearing a measuring pad on your waist that monitors your breathing patterns using a downloadable app. The app can let you know if you're tense and give you breathing activities to restore calm.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a biofeedback machine, Resperate, for decreasing stress and lowering blood pressure. Resperate is a portable electronic machine that helps you have slow, deep breathing.\n\nThe FDA doesn't control many biofeedback machines made for home use. Before trying biofeedback therapy at home, talk about the different machines you can use with your health care team to find the best fit.\n\nBe aware that some items might be falsely sold as biofeedback machines. Also, some people who teach biofeedback may not be certified or have enough training to help you.\n\nWhy it's done\n\nBiofeedback, sometimes called biofeedback training, helps many physical and mental health problems, including:\n\nNervousness or stress.\n\nAsthma.\n\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nSide effects from drugs to treat cancer.\n\nLong-lasting pain.\n\nConstipation.\n\nLoss of bowel control, also known as fecal incontinence.\n\nFibromyalgia.\n\nHeadache.\n\nHigh blood pressure.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome.\n\nRaynaud's disease.\n\nRinging in the ears, also called tinnitus.\n\nStroke.\n\nTemporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ).\n\nUrinary incontinence and trouble passing urine.\n\nDepression.\n\nBiofeedback appeals to people for a variety of reasons:\n\nThere's no surgery involved.\n\nIt might lower or end the need for medicines.\n\nIt might make medicines work better.\n\nIt might help when medicines can't be used, such as in pregnancy.\n\nIt helps people feel more in control of their health.\n\nRisks\n\nBiofeedback is generally safe, but it might not be right for everyone. Biofeedback machines might not work on people with some medical problems, such as heartbeat issues or some skin diseases. Be sure to talk with your health care provider first.\n\nHow you prepare\n\nIt's not hard to start biofeedback.\n\nTo find a person who teaches biofeedback, ask your health care provider to recommend someone who has experience treating your problem. Many biofeedback experts are licensed in another area of health care, such as psychology, nursing or physical therapy.\n\nState laws regulating biofeedback teaching vary. Some biofeedback experts choose to become certified to show their extra training and experience in the practice.\n\nBefore starting treatment, consider asking the biofeedback expert a few questions, such as:\n\nAre you licensed, certified or registered?\n\nWhat is your training and experience?\n\nDo you have experience teaching biofeedback for my problem?\n\nHow many biofeedback treatments do you think I'll need?\n\nWhat's the cost and is it covered by my health insurance?\n\nCan you give me a list of references?\n\nWhat you can expect\n\nDuring the treatment\n\nDuring biofeedback, a therapist connects electrical pads or sensors to different parts of your body. These pads might be used to:\n\nMonitor your brain waves.\n\nCheck the temperature of your skin.\n\nMeasure muscle tightness.\n\nMonitor your heart rate.\n\nMonitor your breathing rate and patterns.\n\nThe pads send information to a nearby screen. The therapist uses that information and makes suggestions to help you control your body's responses. For example, if the pads sense tight muscles that may be causing headaches, you then learn how to relax those muscles.\n\nA typical biofeedback treatment lasts 30 to 60 minutes. How many treatments you have and how long they last depend on your health problem and how quickly you learn to control your body's responses. The goal of biofeedback is to learn to use these methods at home on your own without a machine or sensors.\n\nInsurance companies may not pay for biofeedback.\n\nResults\n\nIf biofeedback works for you, it might help your health problem or decrease how much medicine you take. In time, you can practice the biofeedback methods you learn on your own. Don't stop the medical treatment for your problem without talking to your health care provider."
