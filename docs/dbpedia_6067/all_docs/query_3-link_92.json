        "text": "The application period for the UTokyo GUC 2024 has now closed.\n\nWe greatly appreciate the large number of applications we have received from all of you!\n\n- The selection process is solely based on the documents and information submitted via TAO before the deadline. Documents for the selection process are only accepted through TAO, and TAO closed at 16:00 on Friday, March 15th.\n\n- The GUC Office neither accepts nor considers any documents or information for the selection process if they are sent via means other than TAO until the selection results are announced.\n\n- Please be aware that the screening process for all applications will commence collectively on our end after the application deadline, independent of TAO, based on the information provided via TAO. It is normal for the status on TAO to continue displaying \"Application completed\" during this period, so there is no need to worry.\n\n--\n\nThe deadline for the application is 16:00 Japan Standard Time on Friday, March 15th.\n\nWe strongly recommend applying well in advance to allow sufficient time based on the following reasons:\n\nAfter the application deadline, the online application system (TAO) will automatically close, and late submissions cannot be accepted under any circumstances.\n\nThe GUC Office may not respond to inquiries promptly.\n\nThe GUC Office will not be responsible for any consequences resulting from applicants' failure to receive, read, and/or reply to messages sent from our office, as well as any malfunctions of networks, PCs, or other devices that may prevent applicants from submitting applications in time.\n\nEven if an application is not successfully submitted, the application fee, once paid, will not be refunded.\n\nFor the main courses, applicants have the flexibility to select from the list and can choose any number of courses from any terms, as long as there is no time conflict.\n\nRefer to the timetable and course options for double-checking.\n\nAdditionally, please note that Japanese Language Courses are exclusively available to students registered for at least one of the main courses mentioned above. International Security of the Asia-Pacific (In-person course) Syllabus\n\nJapan’s 2022 National Security Strategy warned that the country is at a “historical inflection point and in the face of the most severe and complex security environment since the end of WWII”. How can we understand regional security challenges that range from war, “de-risking” and great power competition, to climate change, infectious diseases, and terrorism? This course will analyze key drivers that shape the complex security agenda confronting Japan and Asia, through a combination of theory and practical cases. Each session will encourage interactive student-designed class exercises combined with group discussions and lectures. This course draws from the instructor’s experience teaching international security over twenty years at universities in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, and Japan. I look forward to vibrant discussions with GUC students on how we can best make sense of an increasingly dangerous world.\n\nProf. Yee Kuang HENG Resource Management, Efficiency and Social Justice: Both Perspectives from Economics and Sociology (Online course) Syllabus\n\nThis course addresses the issue of resource management by asking three questions: i) What are common pool resources? ii) For whom are common pool resources important? iii) How can we effectively manage common pool resources? Resource management is often considered a local issue as they are managed by local communities and stakeholders; however, it is also a global issue, as resource management impacts biodiversity and the ecosystems which is critical for us to stay in the planetary boundaries. One of the key difficulties in designing policies for biodiversity and ecosystems stems from this locality in resource management, especially compared to climate change mitigation and global warming. This lecture, by focusing on resource management at a local level, seeks to reveal some of the cutting edge policy on biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management.\n\nAssoc. Prof. Hiroe ISHIHARA Tissue Engineering and Stem Cell Technologies for Neuroscience (In-person course on Komaba) Syllabus\n\nCan we build a brain-like tissue in the near future? This introductory course invites you to explore the exciting realm of tissue engineering and stem cell technologies in neuroscience, tailored for students at the early stages of their scientific training. We will delve into the fundamentals of neural tissue engineering and stem cell biology, uncovering how these disciplines converge to advance our understanding of the brain. Engaging lectures and interactive discussions will guide you through the latest research, bioengineering strategies, and ethical considerations in neuroengineering. This course offers a unique glimpse into the potential future of neuroscience, making it an ideal starting point for students keen on exploring the frontiers of brain science and regenerative medicine.\n\nAssoc. Prof. Yoshiho IKEUCHI AI and Social Justice (In-person course) Syllabus\n\nMy teaching and research at the University of Tokyo has been motivated on the inclusion of minorities in society, whether the marginalization is due to their race, class, gender, linguistic ability or otherwise. I am very excited to be thinking about artificial intelligence with the GUC participants, particularly about how this technology can be examined using the lens of social justice. By welcoming students from various parts of the world, I believe we will be able to see just how varied our understandings are when it comes to our concerns about AI and how it can be used for social justice.\n\nProf. Yuko ITATSU Modern Japanese History (In-person course) Syllabus\n\nHistory is not just about the past, and it’s definitely not just about memorizing dates and names. History tries to understand how and why societies change and tells stories about the lives of other human beings. As such, it’s very useful for understanding yourself and the contemporary world on a deeper level, and it’s endlessly fascinating for the window it offers into the experience of those that came before us. Japanese modern history is both rich in its own right, and a great case study to think about how what is often called modernity, for better or worse, has shaped our world. Join me in this course and let’s explore together! Assoc. Prof. Michael FACIUS\n\nEarly Language Acquisition: How Human Infants Learn Language Within Their Social Environment (In-person course) Syllabus\n\nChildren learn language all around the world, no matter what linguistic or cultural background they are born into. In this course, we will tackle questions such as: Do babies really learn in the womb? Why is it so hard for speakers from some languages to distinguish sounds like “l” and “r”? How should we talk to bilingual children? We will also learn about early language impairments, the central role of the social environment for learning, and what lessons artificial intelligence can draw from baby studies. Understanding the mechanisms behind their learning is of high societal relevance, since early language skills are the single best predictor for later academic success. In my lab, drawing on observational, experimental, and interventional methods, we focus on the role of the linguistic environment and social context for advancing learning.\n\nAsst. Prof. Sho TSUJI Law in Transnational East Asia (In-person course) Syllabus\n\nThis course is for anyone interested in how such an internally diverse region as East Asia became a somewhat coherent region in the past, and how it might relate to the rest of the world in the future. Tokyo is one of the best places in the world to study East Asian cultures and societies (I would argue the best, but of course I’m biased). My area of expertise is in the Legal History and Comparative Law involving East Asian societies. After completing my LL.B. in Tokyo and D.Phil. in Oxford, I have held research and teaching posts in Columbia Law School, Hong Kong University, the National University of Singapore, and Yale University.\n\nThe GUC has been providing a wonderful opportunity for students with diverse backgrounds to come together, and to learn from each other. I am excited to participate again this year, especially as it is the second time it will be conducted In-Real-Life. I look forward to learning from the vibrant exchanges myself, and to begin a long-term exchange of ideas and experiences with each one of my students.\n\nProf. Kentaro MATSUBARA The application period for the UTokyo GUC 2024 has now closed.\n\nWe greatly appreciate the large number of applications we have received from all of you!\n\nPlease be aware that the screening process for all applications will commence collectively on our end after the application deadline, independent of TAO, based on the information provided via TAO. It is normal for the status on TAO to continue displaying \"Application completed\" during this period, so there is no need to worry.\n\nFor the schedule, please refer to the GUC website under the \"Application\" section.\n\n--\n\nThe deadline for the application is 16:00 Japan Standard Time on Friday, March 15th.\n\nWe strongly recommend applying well in advance to allow sufficient time based on the following reasons:\n\nAfter the application deadline, the online application system (TAO) will automatically close, and late submissions cannot be accepted under any circumstances.\n\nThe GUC Office may not respond to inquiries promptly.\n\nThe GUC Office will not be responsible for any consequences resulting from applicants' failure to receive, read, and/or reply to messages sent from our office, as well as any malfunctions of networks, PCs, or other devices that may prevent applicants from submitting applications in time.\n\nEven if an application is not successfully submitted, the application fee, once paid, will not be refunded.\n\n*Usage of Artificial Intelligence*\n\nPreparing your application documents is the first step towards your study at UTokyo. In doing so, you will think about what to study there and imagine what the experience may mean to you. In fact, this is indispensable to a successful UTokyo life.\n\nThe recent development of generative artificial intelligence has made it possible to generate essays with a simple command. However, you should not rely on such technology in preparing your application. Instead, it is important that you write about yourself in your own words. <Note>\n\nBy creating an account on TAO, you agree to the \"Terms of Use\" and \"Handling of Personal Information\" provided by Samadhi Co., Ltd., the service provider for TAO.\n\nThe GUC Office will not be responsible for any consequences resulting from applicants' failure to receive, read, and/or reply to messages sent from our office, as well as any malfunctions of networks, PCs, or other devices that may prevent applicants from submitting applications in time. Furthermore, in the event that an application is not successfully submitted, the application fee, once paid, will not be refunded. We strongly recommend applying well in advance to allow sufficient time.\n\nPlease regularly check your registered email and the application status on TAO, as we may contact you regarding your application.\n\nPlease note that the GUC Office will not be able to provide feedback on screening status and admissions decisions."
