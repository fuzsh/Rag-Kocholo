        "text": "This episode of the Physics World Weekly podcast features an interview with Margaret Arakawa. She is chief marketing officer at IonQ – which makes trapped ion quantum computers. An economist by training, Arakawa spent 25 years in the (classical) computing industry before joining IonQ. We chat about why she made the move to the quantum sector and about the wide range of opportunities for non-physicists in the quantum-technology industry.\n\nArakawa also talks about the challenges of marketing quantum technology to customers who might not understand the underlying physics and explains why the quantum industry must avoid hype.\n\nOur second guest is Nat Mendelsohn, who represents the English Midlands on the Institute of Physics’ Student Community Panel. He talks to Physics World’s Katherine Skipper about the student experience – what is good and what can be improved. He also explains how the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a profound impact on higher education."
