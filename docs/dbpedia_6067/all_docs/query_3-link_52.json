        "text": "Brilliant. Speaking one's mother tongue in business settings is crucial for authentic communication and confidence. It ensures the essence of your message is fully conveyed, breaking the colonial mindset that English is necessary for importance. Embracing your native language fosters a more genuine connection and understanding, reflecting the principle that effective communication is about clarity and authenticity, not just the language used. --- I did not write this commentary shared above. It's Linkedin AI generated...a new ChatGPT like AI feature which pops under each post so you can know more. Try it! (If I use AI to write my posts, I will give that disclaimer. Until then, all posts are written by me, warts and all) #linkedinai\n\nWhile it is true that English is a global language, we should not forget that the goal of communication in a social or professional is to be precise, informative, and to clearly demonstrate your point across. As long as clear communication is being taken place between both the parties, how does it matter what language the message is being conveyed in? It is long engraved within us since colonial times that English is the superior language, that if one shall deliver a present a formal presentation, it should be in English. I highly believe that restricting ourselves to one language, especially in a country as culturally and linguistically diverse as India, would only limit our efficiancy when it comes to communication. Whether it be English or a native language, one should expand their horizons and learn multiple languages, in order to be able to adapt to the circumstances. That should be the goal.\n\nAbsolutely! Language serves solely as a conduit for communication, devoid of any power to dictate outcomes. Its sole purpose lies in facilitating the transmission of ideas from one individual to another in the most optimal manner possible. What holds paramount importance is the substance and significance of the message, rather than the language in which it is conveyed. In essence, I firmly believe that content and value supersede any considerations related to the English language.\n\nI am curious to know if Kunal Bahl's reply would have been the same if the founder had requested to pitch in Tamil, Gujrat, Marathi or any other language than Hindi! 🤔 🤔 My POV is simple: Hindi is my mother tongue, and English is my work language! In today's world when we are communicating with audiences globally, knowing to read, write and speak in English is a must. Now, whether this is a good thing as it helps us get an edge over non-English speaking people OR whether it's a bad thing as this is a result of colonialism; well, that's a rabbit hole I don't want to go in. PLUS I don't think I am intelligent enough for that debate. This Hindi vs English debate is Endless! My point is simple: If you know how to communicate in English, it will unlock new opportunities for you. Just like knowing how to code, write cold emails, make great presentations, or knowing Excel will! Treat English as a TOOL! Simple :) Founders can operate and communicate in their mother tongue, but they should learn skills that help them to take their business global. As a founder DO what's BEST for your business! Comment your take on this!\n\n\"𝘾𝙖𝙣 𝙄 𝙥𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙞𝙣 𝙃𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙞?\" I was surprised when a startup founder sheepishly asked me a few days ago whether he can walk me through his startup's presentation in Hindi because he would be more comfortable. Obviously I replied with a resounding \"𝙔𝙚𝙨, 𝙤𝙛𝙘𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙨𝙚!\". It seemed strange that two people, who understand and speak the same native language fluently, are having to discuss whether they can have a business presentation in their own language, which they know best 🙃 But I presume many founders may be thinking that investors expect them to be very suave and fluent in English. At least from my standpoint, it absolutely doesn't matter. Zero. Getting your point across, the complete and authentic essence of it, is much more important than having a colonial mindset that if it's an important business presentation, it must be done in English. Irrespective of whether we are fluent in English or not, we should feel absolute confidence in speaking our mother tongue in business settings just like we do in social settings. 𝙊𝙪𝙧 𝙎𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙪𝙥, 𝙊𝙪𝙧 𝘾𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙩𝙧𝙮, 𝙊𝙪𝙧 𝙇𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙪𝙖𝙜𝙚. 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳\n\nHey Kunal I have asked the same question to many investors while pitching because I find myself more confident in Hindi compared to English. It's good that you do not judge people based on their language, but sadly, most people in the investor community do. They measure you less when you're not speaking very fluent English. People in the investor community and corporate world, in general, expect very fluent English from individuals in leadership positions. There's nothing wrong with that expectation, but it's very wrong when people judge you and measure you less when you're speaking in Hindi. I have posted about the same multiple times on LinkedIn, questioning why people speak in English on stage when addressing an audience that speaks and understands Hindi as well. If we can remove language barriers from the Indian corporate world, I am sure it can be more inclusive, productive, and innovative. I am hopeful that people will understand one day that English is just a language to communicate, not a skill.\n\nKunal Bahl your immediate response beautifully highlights the importance of embracing one's language and cultural identity, especially in professional settings. Unfortunately, some entrepreneurs may feel pressured to present in English due to perceived expectations from investors or industry norms. However, true communication effectiveness lies in conveying ideas authentically and clearly, regardless of the language used. Encouraging entrepreneurs to feel confident in presenting their ideas in their native language fosters inclusivity and empowers them to express themselves more genuinely. It also emphasizes the richness and diversity of languages and cultures within the business world. By championing the use of local languages, we not only break down language barriers but also promote a more inclusive and equitable business environment where everyone feels valued and understood. Overall, this serves as a reminder of the importance of cultural diversity and linguistic inclusivity in entrepreneurship and beyond.\n\nYou know that feeling of being kept in the dark? We all know it feels like shit. But, here's the thing: If you're not communicating, you’re creating distrust. Repeat that one out loud. If you are not communicating, you’re creating distrust. Trust is your earliest currency. The currency that gets things moving at your #startup. When people trust you, they're more likely to: - Fund you - Work with you - Promote you - Refer you But that trust is fragile. It's easy to lose. Much harder to gain. Communication accelerates trust. Here are 3 things to consider: 1. Be Transparent (say what you can say) 2. Be Consistent (say it regularly) 3. Be Human (show you care) Do this and you'll be closer to being the founder people trust. And the businesses of these types of founders flourish. Its really that simple. ———— Video: The sound of humpback whales singing off the coast of Maui.
