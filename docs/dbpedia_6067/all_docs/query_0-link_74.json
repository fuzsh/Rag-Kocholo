        "text": "It's the title of a short story and the newest 007 movie. I thought it's well known.\n\nI found this Wiki summary of Quantum of Solace by Ian Fleming. On the basis of this summary, I suspect that here quantum means \"a small but measurable amount.\" However, although I have an idea about whose \"solace\" the title refers to, I may be wrong. Maybe others could take a look at the summary and see what they think.\n\nI have not read the short story by this name, so perhaps my interpretation of the meaning of the title is wrong.\n\nMy interpretation is based on the fact that this is the second of the \"early Bond\" films, which star Daniel Craig. In the first film, he suffered greatly by losing the woman he loved. It is my impression, from seeing the trailers for the upcoming film (\"Quantum of Solace\") that he is seeking to exact revenge for her death. He might find a small measure of consolation (or \"solace\") in that. Hence the name.\n\nOf course, I've been wrong before!\n\nI have not read the short story by this name, so perhaps my interpretation of the meaning of the title is wrong.\n\nMy interpretation is based on the fact that this is the second of the \"early Bond\" films, which star Daniel Craig.

It is my impression, from seeing the trailers for the upcoming film (\"Quantum of Solace\") that he is seeking to exact revenge for her death. He might find a small measure of consolation (or \"solace\") in that. Hence the name.\n\nThe title is the title assigned by Ian Fleming to the short story. As noted, Bond is only a minor character in the short story, and the plot of that story seems to have nothing to do with the tale you described above. Any analysis of the title assigned to a story written nearly fifty years ago based on the plot of an entirely different film is unlikely to be correct -- and in this case, the interpretation is wrong.\n\nThe meaning of the title is explained here.\n\nIn the Bahamas he [James Bond] attends a dull dinner party at the Governorâ€™s Mansion, where the elderly governor tells him a story about a man named Masters who married an air hostess. The marriage started well but soon the wife began a torrid and very public affair with the son of a wealthy island family.\n\nIt is at this point that the governor explains his theory: the quantum of solace, he says, is a precise figure defining the comfort, humanity and fellow feeling required between two people for love to survive. If the quantum of solace is nil, then love is dead\n\nThe title is the title assigned by Ian Fleming to the short story. As noted, Bond is only a minor character in the short story, and the plot of that story seems to have nothing to do with the tale you described above. Any analysis of the title assigned to a story written nearly fifty years ago based on the plot of an entirely different film is unlikely to be correct -- and in this case, the interpretation is wrong.\n\nWell, it's my understanding (which, again, could be wrong) that Cubby Broccoli and the others who have adapted Fleming's Bond stories to film have often taken liberties with the story-lines while still using the titles.\n\nYou state, flat out, that my interpretation is wrong. But you have yet to offer an interpretation of your own. Do you believe this is just the random assignation of a title to a film that has nothing to do with a work by the same name?\n\nIf not, I will stand by my interpretation.\n\nAnd, incidentally, here is a trailer for the film that supports my thesis that \"solace,\" as used in the title of this film, refers to the revenge Bond seeks. (This trailer runs on the Quicktime media player.)\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/quantumofsolace/\n\nFor those learning English, a \"trailer\" for a film is the 1-2 minute preview that is shown in theaters and on television before a film is released. I believe that in most parts of the U.S. it's called a \"preview,\" but in Los Angeles (and within the film industry in general) it's called a \"trailer.\"\n\nThe meaning of the title is explained here.\n\nSorry to intrude where I don't belong, but I came here from the English-Spanish forum looking for clarification, and I am now more confused that at the beginning.\n\nShould I take the article cited above to mean that \"quantum of solace\" is an invention of Ian Fleming and not a previously existing construction? If the answer is positive,shouldn't it then only be used with the meaning given in the short story of the same name?\n\nNow, in my opinion, the plot of the recent 007 film with this same title has little or nothing to do with that of the original Fleming's short story. Before visiting this thread, my interpretation of the title of the film -I didn't know of the existence of the short story- coincided with the one given here by anothersmith. Now I am doubtful, even though I think that the perhaps one of the few relantionships between the story and the film is the name Quantum of Solace.\n\nSo, how should we interpret the name of the film?\n\nShould I take the article cited above to mean that \"quantum of solace\" is an invention of Ian Fleming and not a previously existing construction?\n\nThat is correct.\n\nIf the answer is positive,shouldn't it then only be used with the meaning given in the short story of the same name?\n\nA phrase may have more than one meaning -- but I think that in this case, since Fleming invented both the phrase and then defined what he meant by it, Fleming's meaning should be considered the primary one.\n\nThanks, GreeWhiteBlue.\n\nI know a phrase may have more than one meaning, but in my opinion not when it has been specially coined with a very precise definition attached. Unless usage has given it additional meanings, which does not seem to be the case. At least, Cagey's initial posts seem to show it is not even widely known -or it was not widely known before the film.\n\nWhich brings me back to the question that brought me here: how should we interpret the name of the film? Without having read the story or seen the film, but gathering they have very little in common, and remembering that the film is the sequel of another in which 007's lover had been killed, I tend to think anothersmith is right. Could it be that the writers used the title without reading the story?"
