        "text": "The Nexus Scholars Program in the College of Arts & Sciences provides undergraduate students with summer opportunities to be mentored with faculty from all across the college (humanities, social sciences, and STEM) on their research projects. Along with the summer research experience, the program offers professional development workshops, career exploration events, and the chance to be part of a cohort from throughout the college who are passionate about learning.\n\nRecipients may conduct research in any discipline in the College of Arts & Sciences and will be compensated an hourly wage for their participation during the course of the program on the Cornell campus in Ithaca this summer. Nexus Scholars are selected based on their interest in research, their ability to work collaboratively, and their potential to contribute to the field. Students who are early in their academic careers and from a variety of backgrounds are encouraged to apply. The Nexus Scholars Program is intended to be an entry point into undergraduate research and we prioritize applicants who do not have significant experience in this area.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nFor questions regarding the program please email nexusscholars@cornell.edu.\n\nBelow is information about the 2024 application process. More information regarding the 2025 application will follow later in the fall semester.\n\nThere are 2 parts of the application:\n\nApply via Cornell Experience site\n\nApply via Workday\n\nStudents, please read all the directions below before you apply in either system. Failure to complete both applications will result in you not being considered.\n\nBefore you apply, download the application guide that will walk you through the process and what to expect and help you get all your application materials in order. To apply, you will need to be prepared to provide the following:\n\nYour resume\n\nEssay question responses\n\nUp to two projects you’d like to work on and your reasoning - see the full list of projects and faculty mentors below.\n\nTip: Our career advisors can help you prep your application materials. Schedule an appointment today!\n\nThe application process requires you to apply in two locations. You can read more about what is required for each portion of the application process below.\n\nStep 1: Cornell Experience Site Application\n\nCornell Experience Site\n\nApplication sections and requirements:\n\nAcademic and Personal Information\n\nEssay Questions – you will need to answer the following questions in under 1,500 characters (between 210-380 words) for each response:\n\nWhy are you interested in doing research next summer at Cornell and what do you hope to gain?\n\nWhat ideas do you have for your future career?\n\nTell us about a time you overcame an obstacle and what you learned through the process?\n\nThink about a time when you worked on a group project that went well. What do you think was most important in achieving that success? Please explain.\n\nFaculty/Project Selection & Explanation: Using the faculty project descriptions listed below, choose 1-2 projects that align with the research and experience you hope to gain this summer. You will need to explain why you selected that faculty member and their project.\n\nResume Upload\n\nStep 2: Workday Application\n\nWorkday\n\nYou will need to apply to the Workday job posting that corresponds with the correct Student Research, Field, and Lab Assistant Job Classification Level classification level for the project(s) you wish to participate in.\n\nFor example, if one project is classified as a Level 1 and the other as a Level 3, you should apply to the two positions separately.\n\nWorkday application links:\n\nNexus Scholars - Summer Student Research Assistant I - Level 1\n\nNexus Scholars - Summer Student Research Assistant II - Level 2\n\nNexus Scholars - Summer Student Research Assistant III - Level 3\n\nNexus Scholars - Summer Student Research Assistant IV - Level 4\n\nTemplate and Resume Upload - you can upload both the documents below on the 'resume and cover letter' upload section of the Workday application.\n\nUpload your completed application template as a PDF with your full name saved in the file name.\n\nTip: If you have to apply to two Workday postings, you can delete the project description for the other level. If they are both the same level, please keep both responses on the template.\n\nUpload the same resume you uploaded on the experience site."
