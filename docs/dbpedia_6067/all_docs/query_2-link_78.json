        "text": "I strive to tutor with a patient, courteous and professional demeanor. I encourage students to develop their knowledge and take a step back and think about how much they have already learned. I would say working with students who transform in the course of a few short weeks from feeling intimidated and helpless to empowered and capable has been the most rewarding aspect of this job. As an inquisitive, creative person and a lifelong learner, another favorite is taking courses online or staying fit by competing in various sports.\n\nMy tutoring experience includes ten years of tutoring. Many local students and hundreds of students online have chosen to work with me. I have met many great and inspiring students through Wyzant.\n\nI am well qualified to tutor virtually all of the math and physics courses available to high school students. I tutor test-prep for SAT|ACT|GRE quantitative sections and can help students who wish to prepare themselves for the SAT Physics, Math I or Math II subject tests. My general and inorganic chemistry knowledge is adequate to help most struggling high school students and some college freshmen. I tutor a lot of introductory engineering courses like circuit analysis (I and II), statics, dynamics, assembly|MATLAB|C++|C|LabVIEW, digital logic, etc. I consider tutoring for other situations on a case-by-case basis.\n\nI recommend students interested in STEAM careers to take as much math as they feel like they can handle. There are a lot of great opportunities for a student with linear algebra, calculus or other advanced skills to gain an distinct advantage in a lot of different college, technical school, or specialized post-secondary courses. So many programs have certain math courses as a pre-requisite, each time you master a new math skill you are opening doors of opportunities for yourself. Give each math course a chance, you might like it.\n\nTo check my availability calendar (must allow pop-ups) please see https://tinyurl.com/ksp8evzz\n\nTalk to you soon!"
