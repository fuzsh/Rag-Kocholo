        "text": "Fallacies\n\nA fallacy is a kind of error in reasoning. The list of fallacies below contains 231 names of the most common fallacies, and it provides brief explanations and examples of each of them. Fallacious reasoning should not be persuasive, but it too often is.\n\nThe vast majority of the commonly identified fallacies involve arguments, although some involve only explanations, or definitions, or questions, or other products of reasoning. Some researchers, although not most, use the term “fallacy” very broadly to indicate any false belief or cause of a false belief. The long list below includes some fallacies of these sorts if they have commonly-known names, but most are fallacies that involve kinds of errors made while arguing informally in natural language, that is, in everyday discourse.\n\nA charge of fallacious reasoning always needs to be justified. The burden of proof is on your shoulders when you claim that someone’s reasoning is fallacious. Even if you do not explicitly give your reasons, it is your responsibility to be able to give them if challenged.\n\nA piece of reasoning can have more than one fault and thereby commit more than one fallacy. If it is fallacious, this can be because of its form or its content or both. The formal fallacies are fallacious only because of their logical form, their structure. The Slippery Slope Fallacy is an informal fallacy that has the following form: Step 1 often leads to step 2. Step 2 often leads to step 3. Step 3 often leads to…until we reach an obviously unacceptable step, so step 1 is not acceptable. That form occurs in both good arguments and faulty arguments. The quality of an argument of this form depends crucially on the strength of the probabilities in going from one step to the next. The probabilities involve the argument’s content, not merely its logical form.\n\nThe discussion below that precedes the long alphabetical list of fallacies begins with an account of the ways in which the term “fallacy” is imprecise. Attention then turns to some of the competing and overlapping ways to classify fallacies of argumentation. Researchers in the field of fallacies disagree about which name of a fallacy is more helpful to use, whether some fallacies should be de-emphasized in favor of others, and which is the best taxonomy of the fallacies. Researchers in the field are also deeply divided about how to define the term “fallacy” itself and how to define certain fallacies. There is no agreement on whether there are necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing between fallacious and non-fallacious reasoning generally. Analogously, there is doubt in the field of ethics regarding whether researchers should pursue the goal of providing necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing moral actions from immoral ones.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nTaxonomy of Fallacies\n\nPedagogy\n\nWhat is a Fallacy?\n\nOther Controversies\n\nPartial List of Fallacies\n\nReferences and Further Reading\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe first known systematic study of fallacies was due to Aristotle in his De Sophisticis Elenchis (Sophistical Refutations), an appendix to his Topics, which is one of his six works on logic. This six are collectively known as the Organon. He listed thirteen types of fallacies. Very few advances were made for many centuries after this. After the Dark Ages, fallacies again were studied systematically in Medieval Europe. This is why so many fallacies have Latin names. The third major period of study of the fallacies began in the later twentieth century due to renewed interest from the disciplines of philosophy, logic, communication studies, rhetoric, psychology, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe more frequent the error within public discussion and debate the more likely it is to have a name. Nevertheless, there is no specific name for the fallacy of subtracting five from thirteen and concluding that the answer is seven, even though the error is common.\n\nThe term “fallacy” is not a precise term. One reason is that it is ambiguous. Depending on the particular theory of fallacies, it might refer either to (a) a kind of error in an argument, (b) a kind of error in reasoning (including arguments, definitions, explanations, questions, and so forth), (c) a false belief, or (d) the cause of any of the previous errors including what are normally referred to as “rhetorical techniques.”\n\nRegarding (d), being ill, being hungry, being stupid, being hypercritical, and being careless are all sources of potential error in reasoning, so they could qualify as fallacies of kind (d), but they are not included in the list below, and most researchers on fallacies normally do not call them fallacies. These sources of errors are more about why people commit a fallacy than about what the fallacy is. On the other hand, wishful thinking, stereotyping, being superstitious, rationalizing, and having a poor sense of proportion also are sources of potential error and are included in the list below, though they would not be included in the lists of some researchers. Thus there is a certain arbitrariness to what appears in lists such as this. What have been left off the list below are the following persuasive techniques commonly used to influence others and to cause errors in reasoning: apple polishing, ridiculing, applying financial pressure, being sarcastic, selecting terms with strong negative or positive associations, using innuendo, weasling, and using other propaganda techniques. Basing any reasoning primarily on the effectiveness of one or more of these techniques is fallacious.\n\nThe fallacy literature has given some attention to the epistemic role of reasoning. Normally, the goal in reasoning is to take the audience from not knowing to knowing, or from not being justified in believing something to being justified in believing it. If a fallacy is required to fail at achieving this epistemic goal, then begging the question, which is a form of repeating the conclusion in the premises, does not achieve this goal even though it is deductively valid—so, reasoning validly is not a guarantee of avoiding a fallacy.\n\nIn describing the fallacies below, the custom is followed of not distinguishing between a reasoner using a fallacy and the reasoning itself containing the fallacy.\n\nReal arguments are often embedded within a very long discussion. Richard Whately, one of the greatest of the 19th century researchers into informal logic, wisely said “A very long discussion is one of the most effective veils of Fallacy; …a Fallacy, which when stated barely…would not deceive a child, may deceive half the world if diluted in a quarto volume.”\n\n2. Taxonomy of Fallacies\n\nThe importance of understanding the common fallacy labels is that they provide an efficient way to communicate criticisms of someone’s reasoning. However, there are a number of competing and overlapping ways to classify the labels. The taxonomy of the fallacies is in dispute.\n\nMultiple names of fallacies are often grouped together under a common name intended to bring out how the specific fallacies are similar. Here are three examples. (1) Fallacies of relevance include fallacies that occur due to reliance on an irrelevant reason. There are different kinds of these fallacies. Ad Hominem, Appeal to Pity, and Affirming the Consequent are all fallacies of relevance. (2) Accent, Amphiboly and Equivocation are examples of fallacies of ambiguity. (3) The fallacies of illegitimate presumption include Begging the Question, False Dilemma, No True Scotsman, Complex Question and Suppressed Evidence.\n\nThe fallacies of argumentation can be classified as either formal or informal. A formal fallacy can be detected by examining the logical form of the reasoning, whereas an informal fallacy usually cannot be detected this way because it depends upon the content of the reasoning and possibly the purpose of the reasoning. So, informal fallacies are errors of reasoning that cannot easily be expressed in our standard system of formal logic, the first-order predicate logic. The long list below contains very few formal fallacies. Fallacious arguments (as well as perfectly correct arguments) can be classified as deductive or inductive, depending upon whether the fallacious argument is most properly assessed by deductive standards or instead by inductive standards. Deductive standards demand deductive validity, but inductive standards require inductive strength such as making the conclusion more likely.\n\nFallacies of argumentation can be divided into other categories. Some classifications depend upon the psychological factors that lead people to use them. Those fallacies also can be divided into categories according to the epistemological factors that cause the error. For example, arguments depend upon their premises, even if a person has ignored or suppressed one or more of them, and a premise can be justified at one time, given all the available evidence at that time, even if we later learn that the premise was false. Also, even though appealing to a false premise is often fallacious, it is not if we are reasoning about what would have happened even if it did not happen.\n\n3. Pedagogy\n\nIt is commonly claimed that giving a fallacy a name and studying it will help the student identify the fallacy in the future and will steer them away from using the fallacy in their own reasoning. As Steven Pinker says in The Stuff of Thought (p. 129),\n\nIf a language provides a label for a complex concept, that could make it easier to think about the concept, because the mind can handle it as a single package when juggling a set of ideas, rather than having to keep each of its components in the air separately. It can also give a concept an additional label in long-term memory, making it more easily retrievable than ineffable concepts or those with more roundabout verbal descriptions.\n\nFor pedagogical purposes, researchers in the field of fallacies disagree about the following topics: which name of a fallacy is more helpful to students’ understanding; whether some fallacies should be de-emphasized in favor of others; and which is the best taxonomy of the fallacies.\n\nIt has been suggested that, from a pedagogical perspective, having a representative set of fallacies pointed out to you in others’ reasoning is much more effective than your taking the trouble to learn the rules of avoiding all fallacies in the first place. But fallacy theory is criticized by some teachers of informal reasoning for its over-emphasis on poor reasoning rather than good reasoning. Do colleges teach Calculus by emphasizing all the ways one can make mathematical mistakes? Besides, studying fallacies will make students be overly critical. These critics want more emphasis on the forms of good arguments and on the implicit rules that govern proper discussion designed to resolve a difference of opinion.\n\n4. What is a Fallacy?\n\nResearchers disagree about how to define the very term “fallacy.” For example, most researchers say fallacies may be created unintentionally or intentionally, but some researchers say that a supposed fallacy created unintentionally should be called a blunder and not a fallacy.\n\nCould there be a computer program, for instance, that could always successfully distinguish a fallacy from a non-fallacy? A fallacy is a mistake, but not every mistake is a fallacy.\n\nFocusing just on fallacies of argumentation, some researchers define such a fallacy as an argument that is deductively invalid or that has very little inductive strength. Because examples of false dilemma, inconsistent premises, and begging the question are valid arguments in this sense, this definition misses some standard fallacies. Other researchers say a fallacy is a mistake in an argument that arises from something other than merely false premises. But the false dilemma fallacy is due to false premises. Still other researchers define a fallacy as an argument that is not good. Good arguments are then defined as those that are deductively valid or inductively strong, and that contain only true, well-established premises, but are not question-begging. A complaint with this definition is that its requirement of truth would improperly lead to calling too much scientific reasoning fallacious; every time a new scientific discovery caused scientists to label a previously well-established claim as false, all the scientists who used that claim as a premise would become fallacious reasoners. This consequence of the definition is acceptable to some researchers but not to others. Because informal reasoning regularly deals with hypothetical reasoning and with premises for which there is great disagreement about whether they are true or false, many researchers would relax the requirement that every premise must be true or at least known to be true. One widely accepted definition defines a fallacious argument as one that either is deductively invalid or is inductively very weak or contains an unjustified premise or that ignores relevant evidence that is available and that should be known by the arguer. Finally, yet another theory of fallacy says a fallacy is a failure to provide adequate proof for a belief, the failure being disguised to make the proof look adequate.\n\nOther researchers recommend characterizing a fallacy as a violation of the norms of good reasoning, the rules of critical discussion, dispute resolution, and adequate communication. The difficulty with this approach is that there is so much disagreement about how to characterize these norms.\n\nIn addition, all the above definitions are often augmented with some remark to the effect that the fallacies need to be convincing or persuasive to too many people. It is notoriously difficult to be very precise about these notions. Some researchers in fallacy theory have therefore recommended dropping the notions altogether; other researchers suggest replacing them in favor of the phrase “can be used to persuade.”\n\nSome researchers complain that all the above definitions of fallacy are too broad and do not distinguish between mere blunders and actual fallacies, the more serious errors.\n\nResearchers in the field are deeply divided, not only about how to define the term “fallacy” and how to define some of the individual fallacies, but also about whether there are necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing between fallacious and non-fallacious reasoning generally. Analogously, there is doubt in the field of ethics whether researchers should pursue the goal of providing necessary and sufficient conditions for distinguishing moral actions from immoral ones.\n\n5. Other Controversies\n\nHow do we defend the claim that an item of reasoning should be labeled as a particular fallacy? A major goal in the field of informal logic is provide some criteria for each fallacy. Schwartz presents the challenge this way:\n\nFallacy labels have their use. But fallacy-label texts tend not to provide useful criteria for applying the labels. Take the so-called ad verecundiam fallacy, the fallacious appeal to authority. Just when is it committed? Some appeals to authority are fallacious; most are not. A fallacious one meets the following condition: The expertise of the putative authority, or the relevance of that expertise to the point at issue, are in question. But the hard work comes in judging and showing that this condition holds, and that is where the fallacy-label-texts leave off. Or rather, when a text goes further, stating clear, precise, broadly applicable criteria for applying fallacy labels, it provides a critical instrument [that is] more fundamental than a taxonomy of fallacies and hence to that extent goes beyond the fallacy-label approach. The further it goes in this direction, the less it need to emphasize or even to use fallacy labels (Schwartz, 232).\n\nThe controversy here is the extent to which it is better to teach students what Schwartz calls “the critical instrument” than to teach the fallacy-label approach. Is the fallacy-label approach better for some kinds of fallacies than others? If so, which others?\n\nOne controversy involves the relationship between the fields of logic and rhetoric. In the field of rhetoric, the primary goal is to persuade the audience, not guide them to the truth. Philosophers concentrate on convincing the ideally rational reasoner.\n\nAdvertising in magazines and on television is designed to achieve visual persuasion. And a hug or the fanning of fumes from freshly baked donuts out onto the sidewalk are occasionally used for visceral persuasion. There is some controversy among researchers in informal logic as to whether the reasoning involved in this nonverbal persuasion can always be assessed properly by the same standards that are used for verbal reasoning.\n\n6. Partial List of Fallacies\n\nConsulting the list below will give a general idea of the kind of error involved in passages to which the fallacy name is applied. However, simply applying the fallacy name to a passage cannot substitute for a detailed examination of the passage and its context or circumstances because there are many instances of reasoning to which a fallacy name might seem to apply, yet, on further examination, it is found that in these circumstances the reasoning is really not fallacious.\n\nAbusive Ad

is a fallacy of ambiguity due to the different ways a word or syllable is emphasized or accented. Also called Accentus, Misleading Accent, and Prosody.\n\nExample:\n\nA member of Congress is asked by a reporter if she is in favor of the President’s new missile defense system, and she responds, “I’m in favor of a missile defense system that effectively defends America.”\n\nWith an emphasis on the word “favor,” her response is likely to be for the President’s missile defense system. With an emphasis, instead, on the word “effectively,” her remark is likely to be against the President’s missile defense system. And by using neither emphasis, she can later claim that her response was on either side of the issue. For an example of the Fallacy of Accent involving the accent of a syllable within a single word, consider the word “invalid” in the sentence, “Did you mean the invalid one?” When we accent the first syllable, we are speaking of a sick person, but when we accent the second syllable, we are speaking of an argument failing to meet the deductive standard of being valid. By not supplying the accent, and not supplying additional information to help us disambiguate, then we are committing the Fallacy of Accent.\n\nAccentus\n\nSee the Fallacy of Accent.\n\nAccident\n\nWe often arrive at a generalization but don’t or can’t list all the exceptions. When we then reason with the generalization as if it has no exceptions, our reasoning contains the Fallacy of Accident. This fallacy is sometimes called the “Fallacy of Sweeping Generalization.”\n\nExample:\n\nPeople should keep their promises, right? I loaned Dwayne my knife, and he said he’d return it. Now he is refusing to give it back, but I need it right now to slash up my neighbors who disrespected me.\n\nPeople should keep their promises, but there are exceptions to this generalization as in this case of the psychopath who wants Dwayne to keep his promise to return the knife.\n\nAd Baculum\n\nSee Scare Tactic and Appeal to Emotions (Fear).\n\nAd Consequentiam\n\nSee Appeal to Consequence.\n\nAd Crumenum\n\nSee Appeal to Money.\n\nAd Hoc Rescue\n\nPsychologically, it is understandable that you would try to rescue a cherished belief from trouble. When faced with conflicting data, you are likely to mention how the conflict will disappear if some new assumption is taken into account. However, if there is no good reason to accept this saving assumption other than that it works to save your cherished belief, your rescue is an Ad Hoc Rescue.\n\nExample:\n\nYolanda: If you take four of these tablets of vitamin C every day, you will never get a cold.\n\nJuanita: I tried that last year for several months, and still got a cold.\n\nYolanda: Did you take the tablets every day?\n\nJuanita: Yes.\n\nYolanda: Well, I’ll bet you bought some bad tablets.\n\nThe burden of proof is definitely on Yolanda’s shoulders to prove that Juanita’s vitamin C tablets were probably “bad”—that is, not really vitamin C. If Yolanda can’t do so, her attempt to rescue her hypothesis (that vitamin C prevents colds) is simply a dogmatic refusal to face up to the possibility of being wrong.\n\nAd Hominem\n\nYour reasoning contains this fallacy if you make an irrelevant attack on the arguer and suggest that this attack undermines the argument itself. “Ad Hominem” means “to the person” as in being “directed at the person.”\n\nExample:\n\nWhat she says about Johannes Kepler’s astronomy of the 1600s must be just so much garbage. Do you realize she’s only fifteen years old?\n\nThis attack may undermine the young woman’s credibility as a scientific authority, but it does not undermine her reasoning itself because her age is irrelevant to quality of her reasoning. That reasoning should stand or fall on the scientific evidence, not on the arguer’s age or anything else about her personally.\n\nThe major difficulty with labeling a piece of reasoning an Ad Hominem Fallacy is deciding whether the personal attack is relevant or irrelevant. For example, attacks on a person for their immoral sexual conduct are irrelevant to the quality of their mathematical reasoning, but they are relevant to arguments promoting the person for a leadership position in a church or mosque.\n\nIf the fallacious reasoner points out irrelevant circumstances that the reasoner is in, such as the arguer’s having a vested interest in people accepting the position, then the ad hominem fallacy may be called a Circumstantial Ad Hominem. If the fallacious attack points out some despicable trait of the arguer, it may be called an Abusive Ad Hominem. An Ad hominem that attacks an arguer by attacking the arguer’s associates is called the Fallacy of Guilt by Association. If the fallacy focuses on a complaint about the origin of the arguer’s views, then it is a kind of Genetic Fallacy. If the fallacy is due to claiming the person does not practice what is preached, it is the Tu Quoque Fallacy. Two Wrongs do not Make a Right is also a type of Ad Hominem fallacy.\n\nThe intentional use of the ad hominem fallacy is a tactic used by all dictators and authoritarian leaders. If you say something critical of them or their regime, their immediate response is to attack you as unreliable, or as being a puppet of the enemy, or as being a traitor.\n\nAd Hominem, Circumstantial\n\nSee Guilt by Association.\n\nAd Ignorantiam\n\nSee Appeal to Ignorance.\n\nAd Misericordiam\n\nSee Appeal to Emotions.\n\nAd Novitatem\n\nSee Bandwagon.\n\nAd Numerum\n\nSee Appeal to the People.\n\nAd Populum\n\nSee Appeal to the People.\n\nAd Verecundiam\n\nSee Appeal to Authority.\n\nAffirming the Consequent\n\nIf you have enough evidence to affirm the consequent of a conditional and then suppose that as a result you have sufficient reason for affirming the antecedent, your reasoning contains the Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent. This formal fallacy is often mistaken for Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of reasoning also using a conditional. A conditional is an if-then statement; the if-part is the antecedent, and the then-part is the consequent. The following argument affirms the consequent that she does speak Portuguese. Its form is an invalid form.\n\nExample:\n\nIf she’s Brazilian, then she speaks Portuguese. Hey, she does speak Portuguese. So, she is Brazilian.\n\nNoticing that she speaks Portuguese suggests that she might be Brazilian, but it is weak evidence by itself, and if the argument is assessed by deductive standards, then it is deductively invalid. That is, if the arguer believes or suggests that her speaking Portuguese definitely establishes that she is Brazilian, then the argumentation contains the Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent.\n\nAgainst the Person\n\nSee Ad Hominem.\n\nAll-or-Nothing\n\nSee Black-or-White Fallacy.\n\nAmbiguity\n\nAny fallacy that turns on ambiguity. See the fallacies of Amphiboly, Accent, and Equivocation. Amphiboly is ambiguity of syntax. Equivocation is ambiguity of semantics. Accent is ambiguity of emphasis.\n\nAmphiboly\n\nThis is an error due to taking a grammatically ambiguous phrase in two different ways during the reasoning.\n\nExample:\n\nTests show that the dog is not part wolf, as the owner suspected.\n\nDid the owner suspect the dog was part wolf, or was not part wolf? Who knows? The sentence is ambiguous, and needs to be rewritten to remove the fallacy. Unlike Equivocation, which is due to multiple meanings of a phrase, Amphiboly is due to syntactic ambiguity, that is, ambiguity caused by multiple ways of understanding the grammar of the phrase.\n\nAnecdotal Evidence\n\nThis is fallacious generalizing on the basis of a some story that provides an inadequate sample. If you discount evidence arrived at by systematic search or by testing in favor of a few firsthand stories, then your reasoning contains the fallacy of overemphasizing anecdotal evidence.\n\nExample:\n\nYeah, I’ve read the health warnings on those cigarette packs and I know about all that health research, but my brother smokes, and he says he’s never been sick a day in his life, so I know smoking can’t really hurt you.\n\nAnthropomorphism\n\nThis is the error of projecting uniquely human qualities onto something that isn’t human. Usually this occurs with projecting the human qualities onto animals, but when it is done to nonliving things, as in calling the storm cruel, the Pathetic Fallacy is created. It is also, but less commonly, called the Disney Fallacy or the Walt Disney Fallacy.\n\nExample:\n\nMy dog is wagging his tail and running around me. Therefore, he knows that I love him.\n\nThe fallacy would be averted if the speaker had said “My dog is wagging his tail and running around me. Therefore, he is happy to see me.” Animals do not have the ability to ascribe knowledge to other beings such as humans. Your dog knows where it buried its bone, but not that you also know where the bone is.\n\nAppeal to Authority\n\nYou appeal to authority if you back up your reasoning by saying that it is supported by what some authority says on the subject. Most reasoning of this kind is not fallacious, and much of our knowledge properly comes from listening to authorities. However, appealing to authority as a reason to believe something is fallacious whenever the authority appealed to is not really an authority in this particular subject, when the authority cannot be trusted to tell the truth, when authorities disagree on this subject (except for the occasional lone wolf), when the reasoner misquotes the authority, and so forth. Although spotting a fallacious appeal to authority often requires some background knowledge about the subject matter and the who is claimed to be the authority, in brief it can be said we are reasoning fallacious if we accept the words of a supposed authority when we should be suspicious of the authority’s words.\n\nExample:\n\nThe moon is covered with dust because the president of our neighborhood association said so.\n\nThis is a Fallacious Appeal to Authority because, although the president is an authority on many neighborhood matters, you are given no reason to believe the president is an authority on the composition of the moon. It would be better to appeal to some astronomer or geologist. A TV commercial that gives you a testimonial from a famous film star who wears a Wilson watch and that suggests you, too, should wear that brand of watch is using a fallacious appeal to authority. The film star is an authority on how to act, not on which watch is best for you.\n\nAppeal to Consequence\n\nArguing that a belief is false because it implies something you’d rather not believe. Also called Argumentum Ad Consequentiam.\n\nExample:\n\nThat can’t be Senator Smith there in the videotape going into her apartment. If it were, he’d be a liar about not knowing her. He’s not the kind of man who would lie. He’s a member of my congregation.\n\nSmith may or may not be the person in that videotape, but this kind of arguing should not convince us that it’s someone else in the videotape.\n\nAppeal to Emotions\n\nYour reasoning contains the Fallacy of Appeal to Emotions when someone’s appeal to you to accept their claim is accepted merely because the appeal arouses your feelings of anger, fear, grief, love, outrage, pity, pride, sexuality, sympathy, relief, and so forth. Example of appeal to relief from grief:\n\n[The speaker knows he is talking to an aggrieved person whose house is worth much more than $100,000.] You had a great job and didn’t deserve to lose it. I wish I could help somehow. I do have one idea. Now your family needs financial security even more. You need cash. I can help you. Here is a check for $100,000. Just sign this standard sales agreement, and we can skip the realtors and all the headaches they would create at this critical time in your life.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with using emotions when you argue, but it’s a mistake to use emotions as the key premises or as tools to downplay relevant information. Regarding the Fallacy of Appeal to Pity, it is proper to pity people who have had misfortunes, but if as the person’s history instructor you accept Max’s claim that he earned an A on the history quiz because he broke his wrist while playing in your college’s last basketball game, then you’ve used the fallacy of appeal to pity.\n\nAppeal to Force\n\nSee Scare Tactic.\n\nAppeal to Ignorance\n\nThe Fallacy of Appeal to Ignorance comes in two forms: (1) Not knowing that a certain statement is true is taken to be a proof that it is false. (2) Not knowing that a statement is false is taken to be a proof that it is true. The fallacy occurs in cases where absence of evidence is not good enough evidence of absence. The fallacy uses an unjustified attempt to shift the burden of proof. The fallacy is also called “Argument from Ignorance.”\n\nExample:\n\nNobody has ever proved to me there’s a God, so I know there is no God.\n\nThis kind of reasoning is generally fallacious. It would be proper reasoning only if the proof attempts were quite thorough, and it were the case that, if the being or object were to exist, then there would be a discoverable proof of this. Another common example of the fallacy involves ignorance of a future event: You people have been complaining about the danger of Xs ever since they were invented, but there’s never been any big problem with Xs, so there’s nothing to worry about.\n\nAppeal to Money\n\nThe Fallacy of Appeal to Money uses the error of supposing that, if something costs a great deal of money, then it must be better, or supposing that if someone has a great deal of money, then they’re a better person in some way unrelated to having a great deal of money. Similarly it’s a mistake to suppose that if something is cheap it must be of inferior quality, or to suppose that if someone is poor financially then they’re poor at something unrelated to having money.\n\nExample:\n\nHe’s rich, so he should be the president of our Parents and Teachers Organization.\n\nAppeal to Past Practice\n\nSee Appeal to the People.\n\nAppeal to Pity\n\nSee Appeal to Emotions.\n\nAppeal to Snobbery\n\nSee Appeal to Emotions.\n\nAppeal to the Gallery\n\nSee Appeal to the People.\n\nAppeal to the Masses\n\nSee Appeal to the People.\n\nAppeal to the Mob\n\nSee Appeal to the People.\n\nAppeal to the People\n\nIf you suggest too strongly that someone’s claim or argument is correct simply because it’s what most everyone believes, then your reasoning contains the Fallacy of Appeal to the People. Similarly, if you suggest too strongly that someone’s claim or argument is mistaken simply because it’s not what most everyone believes, then your reasoning also uses the fallacy. Agreement with popular opinion is not necessarily a reliable sign of truth, and deviation from popular opinion is not necessarily a reliable sign of error, but if you assume it is and do so with enthusiasm, then you are using this fallacy. It is essentially the same as the fallacies of Ad Numerum, Appeal to the Gallery, Appeal to the Masses, Argument from Popularity, Argumentum ad Populum, Common Practice, Mob Appeal, Past Practice, Peer Pressure, and Traditional Wisdom. The “too strongly” mentioned above is important in the description of the fallacy because what most everyone believes is, for that reason, somewhat likely to be true, all things considered. However, the fallacy occurs when this degree of support is overestimated.\n\nExample:\n\nYou should turn to channel 6. It’s the most watched channel this year.\n\nThis is fallacious because of its implicitly accepting the questionable premise that the most watched channel this year is, for that reason alone, the best channel for you. If you stress the idea of appealing to a new idea held by the gallery, masses, mob, peers, people, and so forth, then it is a Bandwagon Fallacy.\n\nAppeal to the Stick\n\nSee Appeal to Emotions (fear).\n\nAppeal to Unqualified Authority\n\nSee Appeal to Authority.\n\nAppeal to Vanity\n\nSee Appeal to Emotions.\n\nArgument from Ignorance\n\nSee Appeal to Ignorance.\n\nArgument from Outrage\n\nSee Appeal to Emotions.\n\nArgument from Popularity\n\nSee Appeal to the People.\n\nArgumentum Ad ….\n\nSee Ad …. without the word “Argumentum.”\n\nArgumentum Consensus Gentium\n\nSee Appeal to Traditional Wisdom.\n\nAvailability Heuristic\n\nWe have an unfortunate instinct to base an important decision on an easily recalled, dramatic example, even though we know the example is atypical. It is a specific version of the fallacy of Confirmation Bias.\n\nExample:\n\nI just saw a video of a woman dying by fire in a car crash because she was unable to unbuckle her seat belt as the flames increased in intensity. So, I am deciding today no longer to wear a seat belt when I drive.\n\nThis reasoning commits the Fallacy of the Availability Heuristic because the reasoner would realize, if he would stop and think for a moment, that a great many more lives are saved due to wearing seat belts rather than due to not wearing seat belts, and the video of the situation of the woman unable to unbuckle her seat belt in the car crash is an atypical situation. The name of this fallacy is not very memorable, but it is in common use.\n\nAvoiding the Issue\n\nA reasoner who is supposed to address an issue but instead goes off on a tangent is properly accused of using the Fallacy of Avoiding the Issue. Also called missing the point, straying off the subject, digressing, and not sticking to the issue.\n\nExample:\n\nA city official is charged with corruption for awarding contracts to his wife’s consulting firm. In speaking to a reporter about why he is innocent, the city official talks only about his wife’s conservative wardrobe, the family’s lovable dog, and his own accomplishments in supporting Little League baseball.\n\nHowever, the fallacy isn’t used by a reasoner who says that some other issue must first be settled and then continues by talking about this other issue, provided the reasoner is correct in claiming this dependence of one issue upon the other.\n\nAvoiding the Question\n\nThe Fallacy of Avoiding the Question is a type of Fallacy of Avoiding the Issue that occurs when the issue is how to answer some question. The fallacy occurs when someone’s answer doesn’t really respond to the question asked. The fallacy is also called “Changing the Question.”\n\nExample:\n\nQuestion: Would the Oakland Athletics be in first place if they were to win tomorrow’s game?\n\nAnswer: What makes you think they’ll ever win tomorrow’s game?\n\nBad Seed\n\nAttempting to undermine someone’s reasoning by pointing our their “bad” family history, when it is an irrelevant point. See Genetic Fallacy.\n\nBald Man\n\nSee Line-Drawing.\n\nBandwagon\n\nIf you suggest that someone’s claim is correct simply because it’s what most everyone is coming to believe, then you’re are using the Bandwagon Fallacy. Get up here with us on the wagon where the band is playing, and go where we go, and don’t think too much about the reasons. The Latin term for this Fallacy of Appeal to Novelty is Argumentum ad Novitatem.\n\nExample:\n\n[Advertisement] More and more people are buying sports utility vehicles. It is time you bought one, too.\n\nLike its close cousin, the Fallacy of Appeal to the People, the Bandwagon Fallacy needs to be carefully distinguished from properly defending a claim by pointing out that many people have studied the claim and have come to a reasoned conclusion that it is correct. What most everyone believes is likely to be true, all things considered, and if one defends a claim on those grounds, this is not a fallacious inference. What is fallacious is to be swept up by the excitement of a new idea or new fad and to unquestionably give it too high a degree of your belief solely on the grounds of its new popularity, perhaps thinking simply that ‘new is better.’ The key ingredient that is missing from a bandwagon fallacy is knowledge that an item is popular because of its high quality.\n\nBegging the Question\n\nA form of circular reasoning in which a conclusion is derived from premises that presuppose the conclusion. Normally, the point of good reasoning is to start out at one place and end up somewhere new, namely having reached the goal of increasing the degree of reasonable belief in the conclusion. The point is to make progress, but in cases of begging the question there is no progress, and the arguer is essentially arguing by repeating the point.\n\nExample:\n\n“Women have rights,” said the Bullfighters Association president. “But women shouldn’t fight bulls because a bullfighter is and should be a man.”\n\nThe president is saying basically that women shouldn’t fight bulls because women shouldn’t fight bulls. This reasoning isn’t making any progress.\n\nInsofar as the conclusion of a deductively valid argument is “contained” in the premises from which it is deduced, this containing might seem to be a case of presupposing, and thus any deductively valid argument might seem to be begging the question. It is still an open question among logicians as to why some deductively valid arguments are considered to be begging the question and others are not. Some logicians suggest that, in informal reasoning with a deductively valid argument, if the conclusion is psychologically new insofar as the premises are concerned, then the argument isn’t an example of the fallacy. Other logicians suggest that we need to look instead to surrounding circumstances, not to the psychology of the reasoner, in order to assess the quality of the argument. For example, we need to look to the reasons that the reasoner used to accept the premises. Was the premise justified on the basis of accepting the conclusion? A third group of logicians say that, in deciding whether the fallacy is present, more evidence is needed. We must determine whether any premise that is key to deducing the conclusion is adopted rather blindly or instead is a reasonable assumption made by someone accepting their burden of proof. The premise would here be termed reasonable if the arguer could defend it independently of accepting the conclusion that is at issue.\n\nBeside the Point\n\nArguing for a conclusion that is not relevant to the current issue. Also called Irrelevant Conclusion. It is a form of the Red Herring Fallacy\n\nBiased Generalizing\n\nGeneralizing from a biased sample. Using an unrepresentative sample and overestimating the strength of an argument based on that sample.\n\nSee Unrepresentative Sample.\n\nBiased Sample\n\nSee Unrepresentative Sample.\n\nBiased Statistics\n\nSee Unrepresentative Sample.\n\nBifurcation\n\nSee Black-or-White.\n\nBlack-or-White\n\nThe Black-or-White fallacy or Black-White fallacy is a False Dilemma Fallacy that limits you unfairly to only two choices, as if you were made to choose between black and white.\n\nExample:\n\nWell, it’s time for a decision. Will you contribute $20 to our environmental fund, or are you on the side of environmental destruction?\n\nA proper challenge to this fallacy could be to say, “I do want to prevent the destruction of our environment, but I don’t want to give $20 to your fund. You are placing me between a rock and a hard place.” The key to diagnosing the Black-or-White Fallacy is to determine whether the limited menu is fair or unfair. Simply saying, “Will you contribute $20 or won’t you?” is not unfair. The black-or-white fallacy is often committed intentionally in jokes such as: “My toaster has two settings—burnt and off.” In thinking about this kind of fallacy it is helpful to remember that everything is either black or not black, but not everything is either black or white.\n\nCaricaturization\n\nAttacking a person’s argument by presenting a caricaturization is a form of the Straw Man Fallacy and the Ad Hominem Fallacy. A critical thinker should attack the real man and his argument, not a caricaturization of the man or the argument. Ditto for women, of course. The fallacy is a form of the Straw Man Fallacy because Ideally an argument should not be assessed by a technique that unfairly misrepresents it. The Caricaturization Fallacy is the same as the Fallacy of Refutation by Caricature.\n\nChanging the Question\n\nThis is another name for the Fallacy of Avoiding the Question.\n\nCherry-Picking\n\nCherry-Picking the Evidence is another name for the Fallacy of Suppressed Evidence.\n\nCircular Reasoning\n\nThe Fallacy of Circular Reasoning occurs when the reasoner begins with what he or she is trying to end up with.\n\nHere is Steven Pinker’s example:\n\nDefinition: endless loop, n. See loop, endless.\n\nDefinition: loop, endless, n. See endless loop.\n\nThe most well known examples of circular reasoning are cases of the Fallacy of Begging the Question. Here the circle is as short as possible. However, if the circle is very much larger, including a wide variety of claims and a large set of related concepts, then the circular reasoning can be informative and so is not considered to be fallacious. For example, a dictionary contains a large circle of definitions that use words which are defined in terms of other words that are also defined in the dictionary. Because the dictionary is so informative, it is not considered as a whole to be fallacious. However, a small circle of definitions is considered to be fallacious.\n\nIn properly-constructed recursive definitions, defining a term by using that same term is not fallacious. For example, here is an appropriate recursive definition of the term “a stack of coins.” Basis step: Two coins, with one on top of the other, is a stack of coins. Recursion step: If p is a stack of coins, then adding a coin on top of p produces a stack of coins. For a deeper discussion of circular reasoning see Infinitism in Epistemology.\n\nCircumstantial Ad Hominem\n\nSee Ad Hominem, Circumstantial.\n\nClouding the Issue\n\nSee Smokescreen.\n\nCommon Belief\n\nSee Appeal to the People and Traditional Wisdom.\n\nCommon Cause\n\nThis fallacy occurs during causal reasoning when a causal connection between two kinds of events is claimed when evidence is available indicating that both are the effect of a common cause.\n\nExample:\n\nNoting that the auto accident rate rises and falls with the rate of use of windshield wipers, one concludes that the use of wipers is somehow causing auto accidents.\n\nHowever, it’s the rain that’s the common cause of both.\n\nCommon Practice\n\nSee Appeal to the People and Traditional Wisdom.\n\nComplex Question\n\nYou use this fallacy when you frame a question so that some controversial presupposition is made by the wording of the question.\n\nExample:\n\n[Reporter’s question] Mr. President: Are you going to continue your policy of wasting taxpayer’s money on missile defense?\n\nThe question unfairly presumes the controversial claim that the policy really is a waste of money. The Fallacy of Complex Question is a form of Begging the Question.\n\nComposition\n\nThe Composition Fallacy occurs when someone mistakenly assumes that a characteristic of some or all the individuals in a group is also a characteristic of the group itself, the group “composed” of those members. It is the converse of the Division Fallacy.\n\nExample:\n\nEach human cell is very lightweight, so a human being composed of cells is also very lightweight.\n\nConfirmation Bias\n\nThe tendency to look for evidence in favor of one’s controversial hypothesis and not to look for disconfirming evidence, or to pay insufficient attention to it. This is the most common kind of Fallacy of Selective Attention, and it is the foundation of many conspiracy theories.\n\nExample:\n\nShe loves me, and there are so many ways that she has shown it. When we signed the divorce papers in her lawyer’s office, she wore my favorite color. When she slapped me at the bar and called me a “handsome pig,” she used the word “handsome” when she didn’t have to. When I called her and she said never to call her again, she first asked me how I was doing and whether my life had changed. When I suggested that we should have children in order to keep our marriage together, she laughed. If she can laugh with me, if she wants to know how I am doing and whether my life has changed, and if she calls me “handsome” and wears my favorite color on special occasions, then I know she really loves me.\n\nUsing the Fallacy of Confirmation Bias is usually a sign that one has adopted some belief dogmatically and isn’t willing to disconfirm the belief, or is too willing to interpret ambiguous evidence so that it conforms to what one already believes. Confirmation bias often reveals itself in the fact that people of opposing views can each find support for those views in the same piece of evidence.\n\nConjunction\n\nMistakenly supposing that event E is less likely than the conjunction of events E and F. Here is an example from the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose you know that Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice. Then you are asked to choose which is more likely: (A) Linda is a bank teller or (B) Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement. If you choose (B) you commit the Conjunction Fallacy\n\nConfusing an Explanation with an Excuse\n\nTreating someone’s explanation of a fact as if it were a justification of the fact. Explaining a crime should not be confused with excusing the crime, but it too often is.\n\nExample:\n\nSpeaker: The German atrocities committed against the French and Belgians during World War I were in part due to the anger of German soldiers who learned that French and Belgian soldiers were ambushing German soldiers, shooting them in the back, or even poisoning, blinding and castrating them.\n\nRespondent: I don’t understand how you can be so insensitive as to condone those German atrocities.\n\nConsensus Gentium\n\nFallacy of Argumentum Consensus Gentium (argument from the consensus of the nations). See Traditional Wisdom.\n\nConsequence\n\nSee Appeal to Consequence.\n\nContextomy\n\nSee Quoting out of Context.\n\nConverse Accident\n\nIf we reason by paying too much attention to exceptions to the rule, and generalize on the exceptions, our reasoning contains this fallacy. This fallacy is the converse of the Accident Fallacy. It is a kind of Hasty Generalization, by generalizing too quickly from a peculiar case.\n\nExample:\n\nI’ve heard that turtles live longer than tarantulas, but the one turtle I bought lived only two days. I bought it at Dowden’s Pet Store. So, I think that turtles bought from pet stores do not live longer than tarantulas.\n\nThe original generalization is “Turtles live longer than tarantulas.” There are exceptions, such as the turtle bought from the pet store. Rather than seeing this for what it is, namely an exception, the reasoner places too much trust in this exception and generalizes on it to produce the faulty generalization that turtles bought from pet stores do not live longer than tarantulas.\n\nCover-up\n\nSee Suppressed Evidence.\n\nCum Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc\n\nLatin for “with this, therefore because of this.” This is a False Cause Fallacy that doesn’t depend on time order (as does the post hoc fallacy), but on any other chance correlation of the supposed cause being in the presence of the supposed effect.\n\nExample:\n\nLoud musicians live near our low-yield cornfields. So, loud musicians must be causing the low yield.\n\nDefinist\n\nThe Definist Fallacy occurs when someone unfairly defines a term so that a controversial position is made easier to defend. Same as the Persuasive Definition.\n\nExample:\n\nDuring a controversy about the truth or falsity of atheism, the fallacious reasoner says, “Let’s define ‘atheist’ as someone who doesn’t yet realize that God exists.”\n\nDenying the Antecedent\n\nYou are using this fallacy if you deny the antecedent of a conditional and then suppose that doing so is a sufficient reason for denying the consequent. This formal fallacy is often mistaken for Modus Tollens, a valid form of argument using the conditional. A conditional is an if-then statement; the if-part is the antecedent, and the then-part is the consequent.\n\nExample:\n\nIf she were Brazilian, then she would know that Brazil’s official language is Portuguese. She isn’t Brazilian; she’s from London. So, she surely doesn’t know this about Brazil’s language.\n\nDigression\n\nSee Avoiding the Issue.\n\nDistraction\n\nSee Smokescreen.\n\nDivision\n\nMerely because a group as a whole has a characteristic, it often doesn’t follow that individuals in the group have that characteristic. If you suppose that it does follow, when it doesn’t, your reasoning contains the Fallacy of Division. It is the converse of the Composition Fallacy.\n\nExample:\n\nJoshua’s soccer team is the best in the division because it had an undefeated season and won the division title, so their goalie must be the best in the division.\n\nAs an example of division, Aristotle gave this example: The number 5 is 2 and 3. But 2 is even and 3 is odd, so 5 is even and odd.\n\nDomino\n\nSee Slippery Slope.\n\nDouble Standard\n\nThere are many situations in which you should judge two things or people by the same standard. If in one of those situations you use different standards for the two, your reasoning contains the Fallacy of Using a Double Standard.\n\nExample:\n\nI know we will hire any man who gets over a 70 percent on the screening test for hiring Post Office employees, but women should have to get an 80 to be hired because they often have to take care of their children.\n\nThis example is a fallacy if it can be presumed that men and women should have to meet the same standard for becoming a Post Office employee.\n\nEither/Or\n\nSee Black-or-White.\n\nEquivocation\n\nEquivocation is the illegitimate switching of the meaning of a term that occurs twice during the reasoning; it is the use of one word taken in two ways. The fallacy is a kind of Fallacy of Ambiguity.\n\nExample:\n\nBrad is a nobody, but since nobody is perfect, Brad must be perfect, too.\n\nThe term “nobody” changes its meaning without warning in the passage. Equivocation can sometimes be very difficult to detect, as in this argument from Walter Burleigh:\n\nIf I call you a swine, then I call you an animal.\n\nIf I call you an animal, then I’m speaking the truth.\n\nTherefore, if I call you a swine, then I’m speaking the truth.\n\nEtymological\n\nThe Etymological Fallacy occurs whenever someone falsely assumes that the meaning of a word can be discovered from its etymology or origins.\n\nExample:\n\nThe word “vise” comes from the Latin “that which winds,” so it means anything that winds. Since a hurricane winds around its own eye, it is a vise.\n\nEvery and All\n\nThe Fallacy of Every and All turns on errors due to the order or scope of the quantifiers “every” and “all” and “any.” This is a version of the Scope Fallacy.\n\nExample:\n\nEvery action of ours has some final end. So, there is some common final end to all our actions.\n\nIn proposing this fallacious argument, Aristotle believed the common end is the supreme good, so he had a rather optimistic outlook on the direction of history.\n\nExaggeration\n\nWhen we overstate or overemphasize a point that is a crucial step in a piece of reasoning, then we are guilty of the Fallacy of Exaggeration. This is a kind of error called Lack of Proportion.\n\nExample:\n\nShe’s practically admitted that she intentionally yelled at that student while on the playground in the fourth grade. That’s verbal assault. Then she said nothing when the teacher asked, “Who did that?” That’s lying, plain and simple. Do you want to elect as secretary of this club someone who is a known liar prone to assault? Doing so would be a disgrace to our Collie Club.\n\nWhen we exaggerate in order to make a joke, though, we do not use the fallacy because we do not intend to be taken literally.\n\nExcluded Middle\n\nSee False Dilemma or Black-or-White.\n\nFalse Analogy\n\nThe problem is that the items in the analogy are too dissimilar. When reasoning by analogy, the fallacy occurs when the analogy is irrelevant or very weak or when there is a more relevant disanalogy. See also Faulty Comparison.\n\nExample:\n\nThe book Investing for Dummies really helped me understand my finances better. The book Chess for Dummies was written by the same author, was published by the same press, and costs about the same amount. So, this chess book would probably help me understand my finances, too.\n\nFalse Balance\n\nA specific form of the False Equivalence Fallacy that occurs in the context of news reporting, in which the reporter misleads the audience by suggesting the evidence on two sides of an issue is equally balanced, when the reporter knows that one of the two sides is an extreme outlier. Reporters regularly commit this fallacy in order to appear “fair and balanced.”\n\nExample:\n\nThe news report of the yesterday’s city council meeting says, “David Samsung challenged the council by saying the Gracie Mansion is haunted, so it should not be torn down. Councilwoman Miranda Gonzales spoke in favor of dismantling the old mansion saying its land is needed for an expansion of the water treatment facility. Both sides seemed quite fervent in promoting their position.” Then the news report stops there, covering up the facts that the preponderance of scientific evidence implies there is no such thing as being haunted, and that David Samsung is the well known “village idiot” who last month came before the council demanding a tax increase for Santa Claus’ workers at the North Pole.\n\nFalse Cause\n\nImproperly concluding that one thing is a cause of another. The Fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa is another name for this fallacy. Its four principal kinds are the Post Hoc Fallacy, the Fallacy of Cum Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc, the Regression Fallacy, and the Fallacy of Reversing Causation.\n\nExample:\n\nMy psychic adviser says to expect bad things when Mars is aligned with Jupiter. Tomorrow Mars will be aligned with Jupiter. So, if a dog were to bite me tomorrow, it would be because of the alignment of Mars with Jupiter.\n\nFalse Dichotomy\n\nSee False Dilemma or Black-or-White.\n\nFalse Dilemma\n\nA reasoner who unfairly presents too few choices and then implies that a choice must be made among this short menu of choices is using the False Dilemma Fallacy, as does the person who accepts this faulty reasoning.\n\nExample:\n\nA pollster asks you this question about your job: “Would you say your employer is drunk on the job about (a) once a week, (b) twice a week, or (c) more times per week?\n\nThe pollster is committing the fallacy by limiting you to only those choices. What about the choice of “no times per week”? Think of the unpleasant choices as being the horns of a bull that is charging toward you. By demanding other choices beyond those on the unfairly limited menu, you thereby “go between the horns” of the dilemma, and are not gored. The fallacy is called the “False Dichotomy Fallacy” or the “Black-or-White” Fallacy when the unfair menu contains only two choices, and thus two horns.\n\nFalse Equivalence\n\nThe Fallacy of False Equivalence is committed when someone implies falsely (and usually indirectly) that the two sides on some issue have basically equivalent evidence, while knowingly covering up the fact that one side’s evidence is much weaker. A form of the Fallacy of Suppressed Evidence.\n\nExample:\n\nA popular science article suggests there is no consensus about the Earth’s age, by quoting one geologist who says she believes the Earth is billions of years old, and then by quoting Bible expert James Ussher who says he calculated from the Bible that the world began on Friday, October 28, 4,004 B.C.E. The article suppresses the evidence that geologists (who are the relevant experts on this issue) have reached a consensus that the Earth is billions of years old.\n\nFar-Fetched Hypothesis\n\nThis is the fallacy of offering a bizarre (far-fetched) hypothesis as the correct explanation without first ruling out more mundane explanations.\n\nExample:\n\nLook at that mutilated cow in the field, and see that flattened grass. Aliens must have landed in a flying saucer and savaged the cow to learn more about the beings on our planet.\n\nFaulty Comparison\n\nIf you try to make a point about something by comparison, and if you do so by comparing it with the wrong thing, then your reasoning uses the Fallacy of Faulty Comparison or the Fallacy of Questionable Analogy.\n\nExample:\n\nWe gave half the members of the hiking club Durell hiking boots and the other half good-quality tennis shoes. After three months of hiking, you can see for yourself that Durell lasted longer. You, too, should use Durell when you need hiking boots.\n\nShouldn’t Durell hiking boots be compared with other hiking boots, not with tennis shoes?\n\nFaulty Generalization\n\nA fallacy produced by some error in the process of generalizing. See Hasty Generalization or Unrepresentative Generalization for examples.\n\nFaulty Motives\n\nAn irrelevant appeal to the motives of the arguer, and supposing that this revelation of their motives will thereby undermine their reasoning. A kind of Ad Hominem Fallacy.\n\nExample:\n\nThe councilman’s argument for the new convention center can’t be any good because he stands to gain if it’s built.\n\nFormal Fallacy\n\nFormal fallacies are all the cases or kinds of reasoning that fail to be deductively valid. Formal fallacies are also called Logical Fallacies or Invalidities. That is, they are deductively invalid arguments that are too often believed to be deductively valid.\n\nExample:\n\nSome cats are tigers. Some tigers are animals. So, some cats are animals.\n\nThis might at first seem to be a good argument, but actually it is fallacious because it has the same logical form as the following more obviously invalid argument:\n\nSome women are Americans. Some Americans are men. So, some women are men.\n\nNearly all the infinity of types of invalid inferences have no specific fallacy names.\n\nFour Terms\n\nThe Fallacy of Four Terms (quaternio terminorum) occurs when four rather than three categorical terms are used in a standard-form syllogism.\n\nExample:\n\nAll rivers have banks. All banks have vaults. So, all rivers have vaults.\n\nThe word “banks” occurs as two distinct terms, namely river bank and financial bank, so this example also is an equivocation. Without an equivocation, the four term fallacy is trivially invalid.\n\nGambler’s\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the gambler falsely assumes that the history of outcomes will affect future outcomes.\n\nExample:\n\nI know this is a fair coin, but it has come up heads five times in a row now, so tails is due on the next toss.\n\nThe fallacious move was to conclude that the probability of the next toss coming up tails must be more than a half. The assumption that it’s a fair coin is important because, if the coin comes up heads five times in a row, one would otherwise become suspicious that it’s not a fair coin and therefore properly conclude that the probably is high that heads is more likely on the next toss.\n\nGenetic\n\nA critic uses the Genetic Fallacy if the critic attempts to discredit or support a claim or an argument because of its origin (genesis) when such an appeal to origins is irrelevant.\n\nExample:\n\nWhatever your reasons are for buying that gift, they’ve got to be ridiculous. You said yourself that you got the idea for buying it from last night’s fortune cookie. Cookies can’t think!\n\nFortune cookies are not reliable sources of information about what gift to buy, but the reasons the person is willing to give are likely to be quite relevant and should be listened to. The speaker is committing the Genetic Fallacy by paying too much attention to the genesis of the idea rather than to the reasons offered for it.\n\nIf I learn that your plan for building the shopping center next to the Johnson estate originated with Johnson himself, who is likely to profit from the deal, then my request that the planning commission not accept your proposal without independent verification of its merits wouldn’t be committing the genetic fallacy. Because appeals to origins are sometimes relevant and sometimes irrelevant and sometimes on the borderline, in those latter cases it can be very difficult to decide whether the fallacy has been committed. For example, if Sigmund Freud shows that the genesis of a person’s belief in God is their desire for a strong father figure, then does it follow that their belief in God is misplaced, or is Freud’s reasoning committing the Genetic Fallacy?\n\nGroup Think\n\nA reasoner uses the Group Think Fallacy if he or she substitutes pride of membership in the group for reasons to support the group’s policy. If that’s what our group thinks, then that’s good enough for me. It’s what I think, too. “Blind” patriotism is a rather nasty version of the fallacy.\n\nExample:\n\nWe K-Mart employees know that K-Mart brand items are better than Wall-Mart brand items because, well, they are from K-Mart, aren’t they?\n\nGuilt by Association\n\nGuilt by Association is a version of the Ad Hominem Fallacy in which a person is said to be guilty of error because of the group he or she associates with. The fallacy occurs when we unfairly try to change the issue to be about the speaker’s circumstances rather than about the speaker’s actual argument. Also called “Ad Hominem, Circumstantial.”\n\nExample:\n\nSecretary of State Dean Acheson is too soft on communism, as you can see by his inviting so many fuzzy-headed liberals to his White House cocktail parties.\n\nHas any evidence been presented here that Acheson’s actions are inappropriate in regards to communism? This sort of reasoning is an example of McCarthyism, the technique of smearing liberal Democrats that was so effectively used by the late Senator Joe McCarthy in the early 1950s. In fact, Acheson was strongly anti-communist and the architect of President Truman’s firm policy of containing Soviet power.\n\nHasty Conclusion\n\nSee Jumping to Conclusions.\n\nHasty Generalization\n\nA Hasty Generalization is a Fallacy of Jumping to Conclusions in which the conclusion is a generalization. See also Biased Statistics.\n\nExample:\n\nI’ve met two people in Nicaragua so far, and they were both nice to me. So, all people I will meet in Nicaragua will be nice to me.\n\nIn any Hasty Generalization the key error is to overestimate the strength of an argument that is based on too small a sample for the implied confidence level or error margin. In this argument about Nicaragua, using the word “all” in the conclusion implies zero error margin. With zero error margin you’d need to sample every single person in Nicaragua, not just two people.\n\nHeap\n\nSee Line-Drawing.\n\nHedging\n\nYou are hedging if you refine your claim simply to avoid counterevidence and then act as if your revised claim is the same as the original.\n\nExample:\n\nSamantha: David is a totally selfish person.\n\nYvonne: I thought we was a boy scout leader. Don’t you have to give a lot of your time for that?\n\nSamantha: Well, David’s totally selfish about what he gives money to. He won’t spend a dime on anyone else.\n\nYvonne: I saw him bidding on things at the high school auction fundraiser.\n\nSamantha: Well, except for that he’s totally selfish about money.\n\nYou do not use the fallacy if you explicitly accept the counterevidence, admit that your original claim is incorrect, and then revise it so that it avoids that counterevidence.\n\nHooded Man\n\nThis is an error in reasoning due to confusing the knowing of a thing with the knowing of it under all its various names or descriptions.\n\nExample:\n\nYou claim to know Socrates, but you must be lying. You admitted you didn’t know the hooded man over there in the corner, but the hooded man is Socrates.\n\nHyperbolic Discounting\n\nThe Fallacy of Hyperbolic Discounting occurs when someone too heavily weighs the importance of a present reward over a significantly greater reward in the near future, but only slightly differs in their valuations of those two rewards if they are to be received in the far future. The person’s preferences are biased toward the present.\n\nExample:\n\nWhen asked to decide between receiving an award of $50 now or $60 tomorrow, the person chooses the $50; however, when asked to decide between receiving $50 in two years or $60 in two years and one day, the person chooses the $60.\n\nIf the person is in a situation in which $50 now will solve their problem but $60 tomorrow will not, then there is no fallacy in having a bias toward the present.\n\nIgnoring a Common Cause"
