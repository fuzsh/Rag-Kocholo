        "text": "Oakland Voices is sad to share that one of our longtime Oakland Voices alumnus members, Gerald Green, has passed away. Gerald was an active Oakland Voices correspondent, graduating from the community journalism academy as part of the 2014 class.\n\n“He was thoughtful, wise, insightful, knowledgeable and deeply concerned about the stories of Oakland,” said Martin Reynolds, co-founder of Oakland Voices and co-director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education. “He took pride in his writing and was a very important member of the 2014 cohort.”\n\nGerald had battled several forms of cancer, and wrote about health issues for Oakland Voices. He published a memoir, Life Constricted: To Love, Hugs and Laughter (2010) about surviving tongue cancer in 1995, neck cancer in 1997, and prostate cancer in 2008. His wife, Monica Green, is also an Oakland Voices alum.\n\nA retired mechanical engineer, Gerald was also a member of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College Radiology Imaging Network, where he served as an advocate on the Head and Neck Committee. Much of his writing for Oakland Voices shared information about early detection of cancer, particularly among Black men. The last article he wrote for Oakland Voices, published in January, talks about his travels through Europe where he shared his cancer journey with others.\n\nBrenda Payton, former Oakland Voices coordinator, remembers that Gerald made significant contributions to Oakland Voices. “He kept us all on point. He was generous in sharing his lessons of survival and resilience in fighting cancer. RIP Mr. Green and condolences to his wife Monica and their son.”\n\nSara Rowley, who was in the 2014-2015 training academy with Gerald, recalls working with him. “His ability to call out what bothered him was unparalleled. He had a clear-eyed view of what was fair and unfair in the world and wasn’t afraid to say what he thought about it. The last time I worked with Gerald, we were talking about writing a series of pieces on LUSTs [leaking underground storage tanks in abandoned gas stations]. Gerald, true to form, saw a direct line from the environmental hazard to the impact it had on Black and brown communities, and inspired our cohort to research the issue. Gerald was an unforgettable man with the heart of a lion. I am sad to hear of his passing, but his life and his legacy made our community all the better.”\n\nOn behalf of Oakland Voices, we send condolences to his family, friends, and community."
