        "text": "Gerald Green, the NBA’s 2007 Slam Dunk champion, has announced his retirement after a 12-year playing career. After playing the last two seasons of his career with the Houston Rockets, the organization announced he is joining the coaching staff as a player development coach.\n\nA foot injury kept Green, now 35, off the floor in 2019-20, and he was waived by Houston in Dec. 2020. In 658 career games, he averaged 9.7 points, 2.5 rebounds and 0.9 assists for eight teams: the Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, Miami Heat, Indiana Pacers, Dallas Mavericks, the New Jersey Nets and Minnesota Timberwolves. Green was part of the July 2007 trade that sent Kevin Garnett from Timberwolves to the Celtics in exchange for five players and two future first-round draft picks.\n\nThe Celtics drafted Green with the 18th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. He was one of the last players to enter the NBA directly from high school before the collective bargaining agreement between the NBA owners and Players Association changed draft eligibility.\n\nThe Houston native had two stints with the Rockets. Minnesota traded him to Houston in Feb. 2008 but waived him after just one game played, then he returned from 2017-19.\n\nAfter winning the Slam Dunk championship, he finished runner-up in 2008, when the fan vote was introduced.\n\n(Photo: Melissa Majchrzak / NBAE via Getty Images)\n\nGreen's NBA legacy\n\nKelly Iko, Rockets beat writer: When people think of Green, the high-flying dunks come to mind — whether it be the infamous 2012 windmill against Houston ironically enough or his 2008 cupcake Dunk Contest. But Green ends his 12-year NBA career as a talented scorer, shooter and team-first player. Green has always been Houston-centric, whether through his unselfishness on the court or his work in the community off of it.\n\nWhat does he bring to the Rockets' staff?\n\nIko: Green has long been angling for a return to the organization, pushing especially hard this past offseason. Green strongly felt the need to connect with the younger players on the roster and help develop them into true professionals. Green brings a different angle to the development staff now having been through it all as a player. As one of the best shooters this franchise has ever seen, there’s no doubt he’ll be able to impact the team in a positive way from Day 1. Good signing for the Rockets."
