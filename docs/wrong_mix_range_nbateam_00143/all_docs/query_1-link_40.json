        "text": "James Harden had 43 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists in his fourth straight 40-point game, leading the Houston Rockets over the Memphis Grizzlies 113-101 on Monday night for their fifth consecutive victory.\n\nHarden set an NBA record with his eighth straight game with at least 35 points and five assists, besting Oscar Robertson, who twice had seven-game streaks. Harden finished with his fourth triple-double this season and 39th overall.\n\nHouston has won 10 of its last 11 to improve to 21-15.\n\nHarden continued his incredible run that has powered Houston's surge up the Western Conference standings after a slow start, making six 3-pointers and 21 of 27 free throws. He has made at least four 3-pointers in eight straight games has finished with 30 points or more in 10 games in a row.\n\nThe Grizzlies cut the lead to nine with about 90 seconds left. But P.J. Tucker made a free throw for Houston before Austin Rivers added a layup to make it 113-101 and seal the victory with about 35 seconds left.\n\nHarden grabbed his 10th rebound seconds after that to complete his triple-double.\n\nKyle Anderson had 20 points and Mike Conley added 19 for the Grizzlies, who lost for the seventh time in nine games.\n\nHouston was up by 13 to start the fourth and back-to-back baskets by Clint Capela made it 93-77 with about 9 minutes left. Harden made four straight free throws for the Rockets later in the fourth to leave them up 98-83.\n\nBut the Grizzlies scored four quick points, with the last basket coming when Anderson stole the ball from Harden, to cut it to 98-87 with 5 1/2 to go.\n\nGerald Green answered with a 3-pointer and Houston stretched the lead to 103-87 with about 4 minutes left.\n\nThe Rockets led by double digits for most of the night and were up by 23 after two free throws by Harden midway through the third quarter. Memphis closed out the third with a 14-3 run to get within 86-73 entering the fourth. Marc Gasol led the way in that stretch, scoring five points.\n\nThe Rockets led 61-38 at halftime behind 28 points from Harden. He capped his huge first half by making two 3s in the last 31 seconds of the half, capped by one that was well behind the line with Anderson in his face.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nGrizzlies: Gasol has at least one 3-pointer in 13 straight games, which ties a career high.\n\nRockets: James Ennis missed his 10th straight game with a strained right hamstring. Coach Mike D'Antoni said he should return for Houston's next game. ... Chris Paul missed his fifth game with a strained left hamstring. He said Monday that he's doing better but doesn't know when he'll return. ... Green made four 3-pointers in the first quarter and finished with 18 points and six 3s. ... Eric Gordon sat out with a bruised right knee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGrizzlies: Host Detroit on Wednesday night.\n\nRockets: Visit Golden State on Thursday night."
