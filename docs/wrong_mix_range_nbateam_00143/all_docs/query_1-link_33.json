        "text": "Larry Hughes and I have continually said on the Bleav in Wizards podcast that the Washington Wizards could use a competent, veteran small forward as they make their playoff push. With Deni Avdija likely done for the year with an ankle fracture, small forward seems like even more of a need now.\n\nHere’s a quick look at some of the available names they could ponder if they were adamant about trying to bolster their depth.\n\nC.J. Miles, 6-6. Career averages: 9.6 points, 2.4 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 36% from 3\n\nMiles last played for the Washington Wizards before being cut due to injuries. I don’t see him making an NBA roster again.\n\nAllen Crabbe, 6-6. Career averages: 9.1 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.1 assists, 39% from 3\n\nCrabbe last played for the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2020 but didn’t contribute much since playing for Brooklyn in 2019.\n\nMario Hezonja, 6-8. Career averages: 6.9 points, 3.1 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 32% from 3\n\nHezonja last played for the Memphis Grizzlies. He offers some size and athleticism but it’s a hard pass from me.\n\nCaleb Homesley, 6-6, 2021 G League averages: 9.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 35% from 3\n\nHomesley played for the Wizards in training camp and the team sent him to the G League bubble to play for the Erie BayHawks. They might be interested enough in his development to consider him.\n\nJordan McRae, 6-6. Career averages: 6.9 points, 1.8 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 36% from 3\n\nMcRae recently wrapped up his season in China and has familiarity with the organization as a former Wizard. He could provide some scoring off the bench.\n\nAndre Roberson, 6-7. Career averages: 1.2 points, 3 rebounds, .8 assists, 25% from 3\n\nRoberson played 5 games for Brooklyn Nets earlier this season. He’s long and used to be a good defender prior to multiple injuries. At this point, I think I’d rather see Hutchison get those minutes as a non-shooting defender.\n\nGerald Green, 6-7. Career averages: 9.7 points, 2.5 rebounds, .9 assists, 36% from 3\n\nGreen last played with the Houston Rockets in 2019 and I was honestly surprised he got let go at the time. If he’s been staying in shape since then, I wouldn’t totally hate this option.\n\nKyle Korver, 6-7. Career averages: 9.7 points, 3 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 43% from 3\n\nKorver wasn’t much of a factor for the Milwaukee Bucks last season but he’s a veteran shooter and the Wizards need shooting. I still think I’d rather see the minutes go to Garrison Mathews though.\n\nThabo Sefolosha, 6-7. Career averages: 5.7 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.4 assists, 35% from 3\n\nSefolosha last played for the Houston Rockets. He’s in a similar boat to Roberson as a defender who has been derailed by multiple injuries.\n\nJustin Anderson, 6-6. Career averages: 5.2 points, 2.5 rebounds, .7 assists, 30% from 3\n\nAnderson played for the Wizards in the preseason once before so the team has some familiarity with him. He would add toughness and defense but not much shooting. He’s probably comparable to Hutchison.\n\nDeMarre Carroll, 6-8. Career averages: 8.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 36% from 3\n\nAnother one of the many wings whose careers appeared ended in Houston. Carroll is big, physical and a decent enough shooter. At this point he might be one of the better options available.\n\nMichael Kidd-Gilchrist, 6-7. Career averages: 8.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, 1.2 assists, 27% from 3\n\nHe’s long, tough and a good defender but a total non-factor offensively. If you wanted a veteran though he might not be the worst guy to consider.\n\nGlenn Robinson III, 6-6. Career averages: 5.3 points, 2 rebounds, .9 assists, 37% from 3\n\nRobinson last played for the Sacramento Kings and I’m a little surprised no one else gave him a chance this season. I’m not entirely sure what he does well at this point but he’s not really terrible at anything so maybe that’s enough?\n\nSam Dekker, 6-8. Career averages: 5.5 points, 3 rebounds, .8 assists, 29% from 3\n\nDekker’s season in Turkey is currently wrapping up, the coaching staff knows what to expect from him, he has size and athleticism, and he’s seemingly improved as a shooter over the last two seasons. He’s shooting 49% from 3 in the Turkish League and 42% in the Basketball Champions League.\n\nVerdict\n\nDekker seemed like he was a three-point shot away from sticking in the league before and he's worked hard to address that area of his game. If I were Sheppard, this is one of the first calls I would make.\n\nI also think Robinson III, Carroll, and McRae could all bring something to the table. Homesley could be a dark horse as someone the team spoke highly of during training camp and has young, fresh legs.\n\nI’m sure this isn’t an exhaustive list. Who did I miss? If you had to pick someone, who would it be?"
