        "meta_description": "BOSTON – Gerald Green’s presence on the basketball court over the last month and a half can best be described as “inconspicuous,” at least from a playing perspective.

In between the lines, however, he has not shown face often, having registered 15 DNPs during Boston’s last 21 games.",
