        "text": "With the season still a few months away and the roster changes in place for the start of the new season, Nets fans anxiously wait to see how their Brooklyn Nets will do. Fans from the Brooklyn Nets News & More fan page and the Brooklyn Nets Basketball group submitted a lot of great questions for me to answer. Without further ado…. Brooklyn Nets Mailbag: Part 2:\n\n1. How will Lionel Hollins help the team’s style of play and how he will make D-Will into the player he used to be? – Ramon Castro\n\nAnswer: Lionel Hollins believe that players are people, not robots. His old school coaching style has let him to success in the NBA, but also led to his departure from Memphis. Lionel Hollins believes in two main this: style and identity. What can we expect from him next season? We can expect a coach that will help his players build character and run a more up-beat offense. Hollins made Conley into one of the better point guards in the league during his tenure with the Grizzlies. With Deron Williams finally healthy, I have no doubt he can bring back Deron Williams to his former form.\n\n2. With This New Brooklyn Nets Team Do You Believe This Team Will Finish The Season With 50+ Wins Or -45 Wins? – Stephen L. Dawson\n\nAnswer: We got younger, but we also lost a few key players in our rotation from last season. A healthy Brook Lopez and Deron Williams could help the Nets exceed their wins from the first two seasons in Brooklyn. However, with there being too many questions looming around the Nets, I believe they will win around 45 games.\n\n3. Will Markel Brown be the new Highlight reel? – Jay WavyLife\n\nAnswer: He is no Vince Carter or Gerald Green, but he should be able to thrown down some exciting dunks this season. His dunks from the preseason and college gives Nets fans something to look forward to.\n\nWith the season still a few months away and the roster changes in place for the start of the new season, Nets fans anxiously wait to see how their Brooklyn Nets will do. Fans from the Brooklyn Nets News & More fan page and the Brooklyn Nets Basketball group submitted a lot of great questions for me to answer. Without further ado…. Brooklyn Nets Mailbag: Part I:\n\nQ: Do you think Mirza Teletovic can start this season? – Mido\n\nA: Last season Mirza Teletovic made the most of his playing time, putting up the best numbers of his NBA career. After averaging 8.6 points and 3.7 rebounds, Teletovic looks to build upon his current success in the NBA. Although we know Mirza can be a starter one day, I do not see starting in the beginning of the season. Seasoned veteran Kevin Garnett and Mason Plumlee are currently slightly above Teletovic on the depth chart. With Brook Lopez coming back from injury and Garnett’s limited minutes, Teletovic should have the minutes he needs to shine. Who knows, maybe he can take his game to a whole new level and be a starter by the end of the season.\n\nQ: Will the new European players be a big factor in this upcoming season? – Kenry Taylor\n\nA: This offseason, the Brooklyn Nets signed Bojan Bogdanovic and landed Sergey Karasev in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Bojan Bogdanovic averaged 14.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 30.6 minutes per game in the Adriatic League. After months of speculation, Bogdanovic has agreed to sign with Brooklyn and play in the NBA. However, don’t expect him to make a big impact right away. It will take time for him to adjust to his new teammates and coach. Sergey Karasev is a young swingman with great upside. I don’t think he is close to a polished player just yet, but being mentored by Andrei Kirilenko will help the young player improve his game. The new European players can be a big factor for the Nets by the end of the season. Let’s see how quickly they can adjust playing for a new team.\n\nQ: How much of a change can we expect from Plumlee compared to his rookie season? – Rob Cosgrove\n\nA: Selected 22nd overall in the 2013 NBA Draft, Mason Plumlee was an absolute steal for the Brooklyn Nets. Last season, he led all rookies in Player Efficiency Rating (19.0) and Win Shares (4.7). After a solid rookie season, Plumlee should be even better for the Nets this season. With Kevin Garnett getting older and Lopez returning from injury, there will be plenty of opportunities for the former-Duke power forward to shine.\n\nProjected stat-line: 12 points, 7 rebounds, 1 block (25 minutes a game)\n\nHere is a quick summary of the 2014 offseason for the Brooklyn Nets:\n\nAdded: Markel Brown* (R), Cory Jefferson* (R), Xavier Thames* (R), Jarrett Jack, Sergey Karasev, Bojan Bogdanovic\n\nRe-signed: Kevin Garnett, Alan Anderson\n\nLost: Shaun Livingston, Paul Pierce, Marcus Thornton\n\nUn-signed: Andray Blatche\n\nNote: Rookies have not been signed to contracts yet.\n\nWith the NBA season less than three months away, here is a look at some way-to-early predictions for the Brooklyn Nets’ 2014-2015 NBA season. After finishing in sixth place in the Eastern Conference (44-38) last season and advancing past the first round, the Brooklyn Nets hope to make more noise next season with a more experienced coach and a few key additions to the team.\n\n5. The Brooklyn Nets Will Win the Atlantic Division\n\nAfter finishing second in the Atlantic Division two years in a row now, you know the Brooklyn Nets will try to claim the Atlantic Division title for the first time since moving to Brooklyn. However, it is not going to be easy. The Toronto Raptors have re-signed Kyle Lowry, Carmelo Anthony has decided to keep his talents in New York, and the Nets have lost Paul Pierce, one of the most consistent players on the team last season. However, with the additions of rookies Markel Brown, Cory Jefferson, and Xavier Thames along with Bojan Bogdanovic and Jarrett Jack, the Nets have added talent and deepened their roster while getting younger. The Brooklyn Nets may have stiff competition, but will ultimately be able to take the division title in Hollins’ first season as head coach.\n\n4. Mason Plumlee Will Be a Starter by the End of the Season\n\nAfter being the first Nets player to be selected to the All-Rookie first team since Brook Lopez (2008-2009), Mason Plumlee has proved to be a steal for the Nets in the draft last season. Although his stats of 7.4 points and 4.4 rebounds per game may not jump off the page, look no further than his 67% true shooting percentage to see the impact Plumlee played on a playoff team last season. After being snubbed of the Rookie of the Year award, Plumlee will continue to improve his game and will ultimately start for the Nets by the end of the season.\n\n3. Deron Williams Will Have the Best Season of his Career\n\nBrooklyn Nets Point Guard Deron Williams has been a shell of his former self the past few seasons. After coming of arguably his worst season as a pro last year, Deron Williams is no longer considered the best point guard in the league as he once was. It is difficult to even put Williams among the top 10 point guards in the NBA today.\n\nAfter the ankle surgery, Deron Williams should be pain-free and have one of the best, if not the best seasons of his career. With Brook Lopez back on the court and the addition of a few key players who can spread the floor, Deron Williams will once again be able to establish himself as one of the best point guards in the league.\n\n2. Lionel Hollins Will Win Coach of the Year\n\nAfter coming of a sub-par season and making underrated additions and changes this offseason, no one is expecting the Brooklyn Nets to win it all this year. However, Hollins will add the toughness that Pierce left and transform the talented Brooklyn Nets roster into a championship contender. If the Brooklyn Nets are able to continue playing the way they finished last season and win 50-55 games, it will be difficult for Hollins not to win Coach of the Year. This man should have never been fired, and hopefully his wealth of experience will lead the Nets to a successful 2014-2015 campaign.\n\n1. The Brooklyn Nets Will Advance to the Eastern Conference Finals\n\nIn my eyes, the Brooklyn Nets are currently the third best team in the Eastern Conference, behind the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls. With Wiggins, James, and Irving teaming up in Cleveland and Gasol, Noah, and Rose forming a “Big 3” this season, both teams will be difficult to beat. However, the Nets will have a coach that will force them to play with the passion they lacked last season. With Deron Williams and Brook Lopez playing their best basketball, the Nets will be difficult to beat. Look for the Nets to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. Ultimately, the Bulls or Cavaliers will likely be too much for the Nets this season, but an Eastern Conference Finals playoff run leaves a lot for Nets fans to cheer about."
