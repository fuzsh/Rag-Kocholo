He serves as the head coach of the Stockton Kings in the NBA G League, the development affiliate of the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nCollege[]\n\nIn 1992, Bobby graduated from Salisbury High School. He went to Western Nebraska CC during 1993-1995 and Minnesota during 1995-1997. In Minnesota, he led the Golden Gophers to the Final Four as they lost to the Kentucky Wildcats.\n\nNBA[]\n\nJackson entered the 1997 NBA Draft, and was selected with the 23rd pick by the Seattle SuperSonics (now the Oklahoma City Thunder). His draft rights were traded to the Denver Nuggets. After his rookie season with Denver, he went to the Minnesota Timberwolves where he played for two seasons. Then, he went to the Sacramento Kings for five seasons, the longest he played for a team one time in his career. He was known as \"Action Jckson\". Jackson sustained an abdominal strain early in the 2004–05 season that forced him to miss 51 games.\n\nAfter he left Sacramento, he played for the Memphis Grizzlies in 2005-06 season, New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets in 2006-08, and the Houston Rockets during 2008. On July 29, 2008, Bobby was traded back to the Kings for one more season, 2008-09 season. He retired on October 24, 2009.\n\nAfter playing[]\n\nAfter retirement as a player, Jackson became an assistant coach for the Kings. On June 5, 2013, new Kings coach Michael Malone announced that the 2012–13 assistant coaches would not be retained for the 2013-14 season. On September 9, 2013, Jackson was hired by the Minnesota Timberwolves as a player development coach. In 2021, Jackson was named the head coach of the Stockton Kings in the NBA G League.\n\nNBA career statistics[]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high\n\nRegular season[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1997–98 Denver 68 53 30.0 .392 .259 .814 4.4 4.7 1.5 .2 11.6 1998–99 Minnesota 50 12 18.8 .405 .370 .772 2.7 3.3 .8 .1 7.1 1999–00 Minnesota 73 10 14.2 .405 .283 .776 2.1 2.4 .7 .1 5.1 2000–01 Sacramento 79 7 20.9 .439 .375 .739 3.1 2.0 1.1 .1 7.2 2001–02 Sacramento 81 3 21.6 .443 .361 .810 3.1 2.0 .9 .1 11.1 2002–03 Sacramento 59 26 28.4 .464 .379 .846 3.7 3.1 1.2 .1 15.2 2003–04 Sacramento 50 0 23.7 .444 .370 .752 3.5 2.1 1.0 .2 13.8 2004–05 Sacramento 25 0 21.4 .427 .344 .862 3.4 2.4 .6 .1 12.0 2005–06 Memphis 71 15 25.0 .382 .389 .733 3.1 2.7 .9 .0 11.4 2006–07 NO/Oklahoma City 56 2 23.8 .394 .327 .774 3.2 2.5 .9 .1 10.6 2007–08 New Orleans 46 0 19.4 .392 .368 .816 2.4 1.7 .7 .1 7.1 2007–08 Houston 26 5 19.2 .419 .341 .750 2.7 2.4 .5 .1 8.8 2008–09 Sacramento 71 10 20.9 .398 .305 .851 2.8 2.0 .9 .1 7.5 Career 755 143 22.2 .417 .354 .793 3.1 2.6 .9 .0 9.7\n\nPlayoffs[]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1999 Minnesota 4 0 6.8 .200 .000 .000 1.0 .5 .0 .0 1.0 2000 Minnesota 3 0 10.0 .500 .333 1.000 1.7 1.3 .7 .3 5.0 2001 Sacramento 8 0 22.8 .438 .286 .714 3.3 2.3 1.0 .0 7.0 2002 Sacramento 16 1 23.4 .445 .256 .791 3.3 2.0 .9 .2 10.9 2003 Sacramento 12 0 27.6 .457 .349 .886 4.5 3.3 1.0 .1 14.3 2005 Sacramento 5 0 15.8 .270 .167 1.000 1.2 1.8 .2 .2 5.2 2006 Memphis 4 0 25.0 .414 .364 .714 2.0 1.3 .3 .0 8.3 2008 Houston 6 2 23.0 .286 .208 .636 1.7 1.5 .8 .0 8.7 Career 58 3 21.7 .405 .270 .807 2.8 2.1 .7 .1 9.2\n\nSee also[]"
