        "text": "Editor's note: The Grizzlies don't own a pick in the June 22 NBA draft. That could change but there is no rewriting the team's draft history. We'll take a look back and analyze the the Grizzlies' participation in the past 16 drafts.\n\nThe 2005 draft wasn’t a particularly important one in franchise history, but it looms large in Grizzlies draft lore.\n\nWhat went down\n\nAfter finishing 45-37 the prior season and securing the West’s final playoff spot by a single game, the Grizzlies were picking at No. 19 in the first round and eagerly watching a couple of wing players who were slipping toward them – University of New Mexico star Danny Granger and high-schooler Gerald Green. Legend has it, when Granger and Green went at No. 17 and No. 18, right before the Grizzlies pick, a disgusted Jerry West, who was fixated on Green, left the team’s draft room. A scrambling staff, led by assistant GM Tom Penn, has been credited with the selection of Syracuse star Hakim Warrick.\n\nWarrick was generally considered the best prospect on the board and not a controversial pick. A dunk-happy forward, he was also considered a replacement for incumbent big man Stromile Swift, who was an unrestricted free agent that summer.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to playing in an up-tempo system,\" Warrick said after being picked by the Grizzlies, apparently unaware that halfcourt guru Mike Fratello was the team’s coach.\n\nThe Grizzlies didn’t have their own second-rounder, at No. 48, trading it away the previous summer to secure Andre Emmett. But after failing to land his man in the first round, West was determined to secure a favorite in the second and ended up dealing two future second-round picks (in 2006 and 2007) and cash to Seattle to acquire Mississippi State power forward Lawrence Roberts at No. 55.\n\nIn draft night interviews, West was more effusive about Roberts, who had led the SEC in rebounding that season, than about Warrick, and made a claim that would become too familiar to Grizzlies fans over the years as the team hunted players in the second round only to have them fail to pan out:\n\n\"We were shocked that he was still available,\" West said.\n\nDraft grade: C\n\nDraft analysis\n\nWarrick ended up being a respectable pick in a fairly weak draft. The player taken immediately after him, ACC wing Julius Hodge, didn’t pan out. Some of the guards taken in the next few picks (Jarrett Jack, Nate Robinson, Francisco Garcia) had better careers than Warrick, but all were essentially career bench players.\n\nWarrick played half of his eight seasons in Memphis, where he averaged better than 10 points per game on 50 percent shooting. An electric leaper with decent touch out to mid-range, Warrick was an extreme tweener. He had a big man’s game in a very slight frame, which kept him from demanding a more consistent role.\n\nIf the Warrick pick was fine, considering the options, the trade for Roberts is quietly among the Grizzlies’ worst transactions. In theory, trading two future picks and cash for the No. 55 pick in a bad draft is questionable asset management, but that wouldn’t matter if you get the right player. The undersized, underskilled Roberts didn’t translate to the NBA. He was a tenacious rebounder, but struggled to finish in the paint against bigger NBA opponents and didn’t shoot well enough to make up for it. He averaged fewer than 4 points a game across only two NBA seasons.\n\nThe two players taken immediately after Roberts in the 2005 draft? High schooler Amir Johnson and Euro Marcin Gortat. Both were still frontcourt starters on teams – Boston and Washington, respectively – that advanced in the playoffs this summer. Those picks traded to get Roberts? The 2007 pick ended up being No. 31, the first pick in the second round. Seattle used it on Carl Landry, a power forward who spent nine years in the league.\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nWarrick is under contract with Leones de Ponce in Puerto Rico. He’s performed overseas since 2013 after having last played in the NBA for the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nThe next time you see Warrick play professional basketball in this country will be soon after the Big3 league debuts later this month. Founded by rapper, actor and director Ice Cube, the Big3 will travel to different cities around the country and showcase former NBA players in 3-on-3 games.\n\nWarrick is a member of the 3 Headed Monsters captained by Rashard Lewis and former Grizzlies Jason Williams. The team features former No. 1 NBA pick Kwame Brown, former Denver Nuggets star Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Eddie Basden. Warrick is a reserve player. Hall-of-Famer Gary Payton signed on as the coach.\n\nThe Big 3 appears July 23 at Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena.\n\nRoberts last played for BCM Gravelines in France during the 2014-15 season. He left the team citing personal reasons and his basketball career ended. He’s largely flown under the radar since then.\n\nAfter two seasons with the Grizzlies, in July 2007, Roberts moved to Europe and went on to play with eight different teams."
