        "text": "Some observations from the Celtics-Bucks Summer League game Friday night in Las Vegas:\n\nRajon Rondo was held out of the action. He’s fine. The coaching staff wanted to get more of a look at second round draft pick Gabe Pruitt, who started the game along with Glen Davis, Gerald Green, Allen Ray and Leon Powe\n\nBrandon Wallace, who the Celtics signed as an undrafted free agent, got a taste of Summer League officiating when he powered home a follow-up dunk, but was called for a technical foul for hanging on the rim. It was a bad call; the kid had nowhere to land.\n\nThe Bucks unveiled their Christmas lineup, starting David Noel and Noel Phoenix. If there’s an NBA rotation player on the Milwaukee roster, it’s hard to see who it might be. Their top draft pick, Yi Jianlin, played for the Chinese National Team and has left town. Former Celtics assistant Tony Brown coached the Milwaukee team.\n\nSpeaking of leaving town, so has Celtics coach Doc Rivers. He’d been here more than a week. Danny Ainge hung around to catch the game and found time to kibbitz with Kevin McHale.\n\nFormer Celtics GM Chris Wallace, now running the Memphis Grizzlies, was on site after having missed the Grizzlies previous game to attend to contractual matters for new signee Darko Milicic."
