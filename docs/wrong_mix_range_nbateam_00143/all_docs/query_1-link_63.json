        "text": "The chaos of the 2019 NBA Free Agency is upon us. We saw some significant trades and draft selections leading up to this summer, but the free agency madness is the steak for this meal. As we prepare ourselves for 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, June 30, it’s important to know where your favorite team stands with cap space, luxury tax likelihood, team needs, and warranted or unwarranted optimism.\n\nI’ve divided up teams into different free agency tiers, grouping them off to like-minded approaches to this summer. Some teams won’t have any real flexibility with their roster and cap situations. Some teams will have money but don’t live in the most desirable destination. Some teams will be hyper aggressive trying to make a big splash. And some teams are already in peak cannonball form as they dive into the madness.\n\nRoughly 40 percent of the league can switch teams in free agency, so we should get a lot of chaos in the next month. You can find Part 2 with the Re-Sign Focused Teams, Big Spending Teams, and Major Cap Room Teams here.\n\nLet’s get ready for free agency:\n\nYOU BROKE\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nDo they have money? Oh, god no. This team is so far over the cap that they can’t even dream about getting under the luxury-tax threshold. The Thunder can only hope to contain those penalties.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? As of right now, they project to have the biggest luxury tax bill coming — at least until the Golden State Warriors start re-signing people. This is a big reason why the Thunder were looking to unload a salary at the draft when they dangled their first-round pick next to guys like Dennis Schröder, Andre Roberson, and even Steven Adams.\n\nFree Agents: Raymond Felton, Markieff Morris, Nerlens Noel\n\nRoster needs: They could use another shooter or two. Of course, if they manage to unload Schröder in a trade to save some money, the Thunder would need to prioritize a backup point guard. Schröder is extremely expensive for a backup ($15.5 million), but he was a huge key to their success last season with their rotation. Mostly, this team needs some wings who can shoot. Losing Alex Abrines hurt the potential of their rotation a lot so they need some wings who can knock down shots. Re-signing Nerlens Noel would be big for their interior depth, but he could prove to be too expensive with the luxury tax implications.\n\nTargets that make sense: You have to look at the cheapest wing options available. Guys like Jodie Meeks, Ian Clark, and Troy Daniels fit the bill of the types of wings they’ll be able to afford.\n\nOverall view: This is probably a cost-cutting summer. Sam Presti managed to turn cost-cutting into a huge positive last year with the Carmelo Anthony trade. He brought in Schröder in the process while saving like $70 million in luxury tax penalties. With their luxury tax bill looking like it’s on the wrong side of $50 million, the Thunder will continue to dangle an asset or two with a bigger deal on their books. They make that move to get their heads closer to the surface of the luxury tax ocean they’re in. I don’t think it happens with Adams. He’s too valuable to what they do, even though he has the biggest price tag of the options.\n\nThe Thunder already have a pretty full roster so it’s more about tinkering than overhauling this offseason. Expect some minor moves within the rotation with whatever additions they have. They’ll bank on Russell Westbrook coming through on his promise to be a better shooter and Paul George recovering from multiple shoulder surgeries.\n\nOptimism? Yes, of course. They’re highly scrutinized but the Thunder are still a good team. Adding a shooter with a salary exception should be doable.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nDo they have money? Not a chance. After LeBron James left, the Cleveland Cavaliers started trying to figure out how they’d bottom out. They were left with a bunch of bigger contracts and potentially valuable veterans for other teams to acquire. This team has eight different players making over $9 million next season, but JR Smith’s non-fully guaranteed deal might be extremely valuable soon in a trade scenario. Eventually, the Cavs will move off a lot of this money in exchange for assets, but as of right now, they still have a lot of money committed for a very bad team.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? The Cavs project to be roughly $5 million over the luxury tax, which should be easy enough to avoid. Koby Altman has some important veterans to move by the next deadline that will easily help them avoid the penalty.\n\nFree Agents: Marquese Chriss, David Nwaba (restricted), Nik Stauskas\n\nRoster needs: I’m not sure they actually have roster needs at this point. They’re going to try to figure out this Darius Garland-Collin Sexton backcourt idea over the next year or two. Cleveland needs to get some big men of the future and some more wings to flesh out the rotation. But mostly this roster is set until they start moving some of these veterans.\n\nTargets that make sense: I wonder if trying to bring in someone like Stanley Johnson on the cheap and trying to develop him makes sense. This roster is pretty full though. If you’re looking for a potentially cheap and relatively inexperienced big man to develop, someone like Luke Kornet wouldn’t be a terrible fit.\n\nOverall view: The majority of the Cavs roster is set for next season. They’re still in the asset acquisition game, and that probably won’t happen until mid-to-late July at the earliest. Maybe then we could see some teams with extra cap space and poor free agency pitches turning using that money to absorb contracts in trades. As of right now, expect the Cavs to operate on the periphery of free agency.\n\nOptimism? For this summer? Probably not. Most of the Cavs’ work was done on draft night and most of their roster work will come over the next eight or so months as Altman continues to work the phones for trades. I expect them to be just as active this season with trade calls as they were last season.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nDo they have money? They spent all of that potential money years ago and are just hoping some team is desperate enough to take their contract mistakes off their hands. They have zero money to spend and would have to rely heavily on sign-and-trades.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? Pat Riley and the Heat project to be nearly $14 million in the luxury tax penalties this season. That’s nearly a full James Johnson annual salary, which makes that signing look even worse in retrospect. They’re hoping a team will be willing to take someone like Johnson, Hassan Whiteside, or Dion Waiters back in a trade that provides salary and tax relief.\n\nFree Agents: Udonis Haslem\n\nRoster needs: Stars, whales, and killer whales. Riley has tried to downgrade the options this franchise seeks in free agency over this year and the near future. At least when publicly speaking. This team has a bunch of role players and a few young guys to get excited about. However, they don’t really have any holes in their rotation right now, other than being able to have top talent. Maybe a backup point guard works best behind Goran Dragic, but they’ll also continue to throw Justise Winslow into a primary playmaking role.\n\nTargets that make sense: None. Absolutely none. They need to shed salary and they’re pretty much set in terms of their roster as is. Everything is positioned for them to start making moves next summer when … the free agency class kind of sucks.\n\nOverall view: The next exit for this road trip of the Miami Heat is not the summer of 2019 but the summer of 2020. They’ll be out of the luxury tax and should have a max contract slot available. I would expect them to try to shed dead weight and comatose salary this summer, but they don’t want to take back long-term money that ruins their pursuits in 2020 and 2021.\n\nOptimism? Not really unless they can start moving Hassan Whiteside and James Johnson in a deal or multiple deals. Again, everything points towards next summer as seeing if Riley still has any cache with top free agents in the NBA. Remember, when they tried to woo Gordon Hayward, the free agent forward didn’t even remember that Riley used to be a coach — and a pretty damn good one at that.\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nDo they have money? That’s a big pile of nope. Half of their cap is tied up in the Blake Griffin-Andre Drummond combination. They owe nearly $19 million to Reggie Jackson this coming season. Josh Smith is still on the books for $5.3 million after they stretched him back in December of 2014. Pistons are on the cusp of having some financial freedom, but it isn’t happening this summer.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? They’re pretty safe from the luxury tax. Right now, they’re roughly $12 million away from the tax threshold. They only have a couple of roster spots to fill too, so they shouldn’t be in any danger of incurring penalties.\n\nFree Agents: Ish Smith, Wayne Ellington, Jose Calderon, Zaza Pachulia\n\nRoster needs: They need wings who can shoot and a backup point guard. Ish Smith was so good for the Pistons that re-signing him should be a high priority. Whether it was stepping in for Jackson when he had a bad game or when he couldn’t play, Smith was a huge boost for that second unit. This team also badly needs some outside shooting, especially from the wings. Luke Kennard looks like a nice player, but he can’t be their best wing. Tony Snell can’t be either, but that’s probably going to be the case next season. So find the guys who can support them.\n\nTargets that make sense: Re-sign Smith. After that, you’ve got to look at some cheap wing options. Maybe bringing Jodie Meeks back into the fold is the type of low cost, medium reward move they can accomplish. Trying to poach Gerald Green away from Houston might be a good idea.\n\nOverall view: The majority of the work for the Pistons this summer may have come in the form of trading for Snell and drafting Sekou Doumbouya. They need to bolster their rotation with re-signing Smith and getting another wing, but this roster should be pretty set for next season, barring a big trade.\n\nOptimism? Everything hinges on the Pistons having a healthy Blake Griffin and guys wanting to play with Reggie Jackson as one of the main floor leaders. That doesn’t always lend itself to optimism, but the Pistons will still compete for a playoff spot, if healthy. That’s cause for some optimism.\n\nYou Might Have Wiggle Room\n\nHouston Rockets\n\nDo they have money? No, they have no money. But since it’s Daryl Morey, that doesn’t really seem to matter. He and his front office have such a deep understanding of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and how to manipulate their roster options through it that they’ve thrown themselves into the Jimmy Butler sweepstakes. They always find a way to get into the headlines and discussions for top free agents, even when it doesn’t make a lot of logistical sense.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? They have a decently healthy amount of room between them and the luxury tax. Houston projects to be around $7 million away from the tax threshold. With the way new owner Tilman Fertitta started cutting costs and declining free agency options last summer, I would expect them to try to shed some more salary, even as they approach acquiring Butler in a sign-and-trade.\n\nFree Agents: Iman Shumpert, Danuel House (restricted), Kenneth Faried, Gerald Green, Austin Rivers\n\nRoster needs: Even with James Harden and Chris Paul on the roster together, they really need a backup guard who can handle some playmaking. As always with Houston, they need a backup big man and some wings who can knock down shots. Floor-spacing on offense and floor-shrinking on defense. But this Jimmy Butler chasing throws everything into a bit of chaos. Ideally, they’d re-sign a lot of these guys and just run it back against a depleted Golden State Warriors squad, but that means luxury tax penalties.\n\nTargets that make sense: I guess Butler makes sense? With $76.6 million tied up in James Harden and Chris Paul, there isn’t a lot they can actually do with this roster. Morey is fervently going after a sign-and-trade for Butler to have three big names on the roster. If that happens, scraping the bottom of the barrel in free agency to fill out the roster is the best way to go. The hard cap is nigh.\n\nOverall view: Your guess is as good as mine. Whether or not they can actually get some traction with this Butler stuff will determine just what to expect from them this summer. The Rockets are on the cusp of competing for a title. We’ve seen them fall short in relatively embarrassing fashion the last two playoffs. Missing 27 straight 3-pointers and then sending a memo about officiating was bad. Following that up with Steph Curry playing three good quarters to close out Games 5 and 6 this year to eliminate you was also bad. But the Warriors injuries give the West new life and the Rockets are trying to capitalize on it.\n\nOptimism? Yes, absolutely. Whether they run it back with this team or they go get Butler from Philadelphia, there is a lot of reason for optimism with this team and any of the directions it could go this summer. Things looked pretty bleak after their second-round exit, but fragile Achilles’ tendons and ACLs have breathed new life into this Rockets squad.\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nDo they have money? Even if we see an exodus from Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green this summer, the Toronto Raptors don’t really have money to spend. Marc Gasol opted in on his $25.5 million player option for next season and that removed any and all room for the Raptors to go out and try to get someone if everybody leaves. For the most part though, the Raptors shouldn’t care about that as long as they can bring Kawhi back.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? Bringing back the championship band together will certainly push them into the luxury tax. As of right now, they’re safe, but it’ll be pretty hard to avoid it even if they bring back Kawhi and don’t have Green on the roster anymore. Small price to pay for that championship ring though. Well … it could be a pretty big price to pay but it’s not my money.\n\nFree Agents: Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green, Patrick McCaw (restricted), Jeremy Lin, Jodie Meeks, Eric Moreland\n\nRoster needs: Kawhi Leonard. They need Kawhi Leonard. Running it back with this squad, especially after Gasol just opted in for $25 million next season, is exactly what the Raptors need for their roster. The wiggle room for the Raptors would come in the form of moving Gasol for some roster depth if they feel like he has diminishing returns this season. It would be similar to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 after their championship not believing Tyson Chandler was a part of their future, even though the ages of the two don’t line up. Mostly, the Raptors maybe need another backup big man and maybe a third point guard but they’re pretty set if everybody comes back.\n\nShould Kawhi and Green leave, the roster needs become filling out the wings, obviously. They won’t really have a lot of options there with any available money, so grabbing a wing with their mid-level exception seems like best-case scenario of the worst-case scenario.\n\nTargets that make sense: In a world in which Kawhi stays with the Raptors, the minor moves you can make probably involve bringing back Lin on a one-year, veteran minimum deal or going after someone like Devin Harris or Raymond Felton on a similar deal. Ideally, you’d grab a big man like Kyle O’Quinn or Amir Johnson as an emergency backup, but O’Quinn is probably too expensive here.\n\nIn a world in which Kawhi leaves, a wing like Trevor Ariza or Wilson Chandler on a shorter mid-level exception deal could really fill in the gaps as OG Anunoby gets healthy and back up to speed.\n\nOverall view: It’s all about bringing the champs back together and winning that title has made a lot of people around the league believe Kawhi could come back on a short-term deal this summer. Prior to winning the title, a lot of people around the NBA assumed Leonard was a lock to move to the Los Angeles Clippers. Now? A short-term deal to stay in Toronto feels a lot more likely. Get Kawhi to 10 years in the NBA and then he hits the 35 percent max in free agency. Staying with Toronto accomplishes that pretty easily.\n\nOptimism? They’re the champs and it looks like they’re headed toward keeping Leonard. A lot could change between now and Kawhi’s decision, but the Raptors have to feel nothing but optimism right now.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\nDo they have money? They have zero cap room. The Portland Trail Blazers have so much money invested in this next season, but they also have several expiring contracts coming up. The newly acquired Kent Bazemore, Mo Harkless, and Meyers Leonard all have significant expiring contracts at the end of the 2019-2020 season. Even though the Blazers don’t have cap space this summer, they have options to make moves via trade if they’re willing to take on more long-term money of players who can help them win now and build off their Western Conference Finals appearance.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? Yes, they are. They currently project to have about $4-5 million in room before they hit the luxury tax. That’s before they attempt to re-sign Al-Farouq Aminu, who has been integral to their success outside of the Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum combination. That could push them well into the luxury tax, which we don’t know will be acceptable with their new ownership situation after the passing Paul Allen late last year. They can make a trade or two to avoid it, but the Blazers might really have to sacrifice some depth here.\n\nFree Agents: Al-Farouq Aminu, Rodney Hood, Seth Curry, Jake Layman (restricted), Enes Kanter\n\nRoster needs: They need some depth in the backcourt and another wing, depending on how much they’re willing to commit to the luxury tax moving forward. The Blazers are an extremely expensive group. If Nassir Little can’t play minutes as a rookie, then the Blazers need to find a veteran to do so. Jake Layman could come back on a reasonable offer sheet. Rodney Hood is probably too expensive moving forward, as is Seth Curry. They’ll try to replace a likely loss of Curry with Anfernee Simons growing up fast in a backup role.\n\nTargets that make sense: Re-signing Aminu has to be their top priority. After that, filling in the gaps with minimum guys is the only way to go. The question is whether they try to find veterans at their end to bring aboard, or try to develop some young, cheap options on minimum deals. The Blazers will likely use their training camp invites as real possibilities to fill out deeper spots on the roster.\n\nOverall view: I guess it depends on how you view their Western Conference Finals appearance. It’s not so much that they got swept, but that they got there at all. Some people may think it was playoff positioning flukiness that helped them get there. Except they dominated the Thunder and took down a pretty good Denver team. No, they didn’t have to go through the Houston Rockets, but that’s kind of on the Rockets, isn’t it? Personally, I don’t really think they have much flukiness. This was a good Blazers team. They just don’t have much flexibility unless they start moving expiring contracts for players to help them now.\n\nOptimism? There should absolutely be optimism. The Blazers get Jusuf Nurkic back at some point next season with a chance to build on some extremely valuable playoff experience and success. I just wouldn’t rely on them to be active in free agency unless that entails spending big luxury tax money to keep everybody around.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves\n\nDo they have money? They very much do not have money. The Timberwolves are over the cap by nearly $8 million before they start trying to re-sign guys or make a big splash in the first offseason under Gersson Rosas. He inherits $54.7 million tied up next season in Karl-Anthony Towns (justifiable) and Andrew Wiggins (far less justifiable). The Wolves also have pretty grand designs of going after someone relatively big in free agency. It would require moving a big contract like Wiggins or some smaller but still big deals like Jeff Teague and Gorgui Dieng.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? Wolves are not in danger of approaching the luxury tax. They currently have somewhere in the $24 million range as a buffer between their current status and bringing on luxury tax penalties. Even if they make a big splash this summer, they won’t approach the tax for now.\n\nFree Agents: Tyus Jones (restricted), Taj Gibson, Derrick Rose, Anthony Tolliver, Luol Deng\n\nRoster needs: Shooting, defense, and guard play. It’s safe to assume the Wolves are going to lose Taj Gibson moving forward. He may not be the power forward of the present or future Rosas envisions for this team. He had an important impact on the Wolves in his time there, but the franchise likely can’t offer him a chance to compete like other places can. They also need to figure out their point guard situation. Teague has another year on his deal. They want to bring Tyus Jones back as the backup. Someone like Derrick Rose is probably going to be more expensive than they want, especially since they don’t have his full Bird Rights. If this team is going to be analytically inclined as many expect, Rosas will need to bring in perimeter scoring and perimeter defense.\n\nTargets that make sense: Instead of naming some guys here, I’ll just ask the question of what many in Minnesota are wondering: Is D’Angelo Russell a real possibility? A reunion with the Los Angeles Lakers may make more and more sense as the team crunches the numbers. But enough smart people around the league have talked about Russell to the Wolves as a possibility that it’s messing with my head and how I assess this. There’s no way they get the Nets to assume Wiggins’ contract in a sign-and-trade. So now we’re looking at one of those more complicated multi-team deals involving Teague and Dieng finding new homes. I don’t see how it happens but enough people have talked about it that I might hold my breath.\n\nOk, I guess I’ll name some options that make sense to take fliers on. The Wolves should be looking at Dewayne Dedmon, Mike Muscala, and Richaun Holmes as backup big men. Throwing salary exceptions at guys like Seth Curry (likely too expensive), Garrett Temple (same), or Justin Holiday (might not be good) makes a lot of sense.\n\nOverall view: The Wolves need to figure out their identity under Rosas pretty quickly and we’ll see how that plays out with the roster construction in the first summer. The Wolves hope Jarrett Culver can come in right away and play both forward positions. Most likely, this is the first of multiple summers re-shaping the roster for the Wolves.\n\nOptimism? I mean… it’s the Wolves so I’m not sure how much credit is given to them with optimism, especially as long as Wiggins has this contract in this current state of his play. However, they hired a smart guy to run them and that smart guy hired a bunch of his smart friends to help out. I guess that’s a fresh approach for them.\n\nDenver Nuggets\n\nDo they have money? Assuming Paul Millsap remains on the team with the $30 million team option, the Denver Nuggets don’t have money to spend this summer. Not only are they roughly $12 million over the salary cap, but they also have nearly a full roster as is. They really only have a couple of roster spots, at most, to play with here. Even if they removed Millsap from the equation by not taking the team option, would that $18 million or so get them a player as good as he is? Probably not.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? They should be able to avoid the luxury tax completely because they’re not close to it and their roster is nearly full. It’s possible that re-signing someone like Trey Lyles would push them to that extra $11 million or so to the luxury tax, but then they’d be horrendous at negotiating.\n\nFree Agents: Trey Lyles (restricted), Tyler Lydon, Isaiah Thomas\n\nRoster needs: The Nuggets could use one more quality player on the wing, especially someone who can guard small forwards, but their roster is pretty set and well-rounded from all of their depth and youth. Maybe more veterans can be a roster need, but this team is pretty much set for next year.\n\nTargets that make sense: If he’s willing to go on a very team friendly contract so he can be on a winner, adding someone like DeMarre Carroll on a small deal would be an excellent addition to Denver. Thabo Sefolosha would also qualify for a good enough 3-and-D option off the bench for them just to round out the wing.\n\nOverall view: A lot could change based on their decision with Paul Millsap and just how aggressive they want to be in pursuing another significant piece. But mostly this roster is set for next season. Lydon isn’t in this team’s future. Michael Porter Jr. is someone they have high hopes for and believe will contribute next season for them at the 4. They don’t need to be active in free agency this time around, but expect them to explore some bigger trades to see what’s available.\n\nOptimism? For this summer? No, just because they don’t really have the room or necessity to do a whole lot. For the future? Seven of their rotation guys (if MPJ plays) are under the age of 26. This could be a very expensive team in the next couple of seasons, but they’ve made huge leaps forward in the past year.\n\nI Have No Clue Where You Go From Here\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\nDo they have money? The San Antonio Spurs might have around $5 million in cap space this summer, depending on what they do with their current free agents. The majority of that depends on whether or not Rudy Gay re-signs with the organization. So as of right now, let’s just say they have very little cap room that could end up being non-existent. However, if they decide to move on from DeMar DeRozan or LaMarcus Aldridge, things could get very interesting for this Spurs summer.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? They’re not even close to the luxury tax, even if Gay re-signs on a player healthy contract. They’re about as close to the luxury tax as they were to watching Kawhi Leonard work out when he was rehabbing that quad tendon injury.\n\nFree Agents: Rudy Gay, Dante Cunningham, Quincy Pondexter\n\nRoster needs: This team badly needs some quality forwards. A big chunk of that can be solved by bringing back Gay. He can still play both forward positions on the floor, and he fits in well with what they try to do on both ends of the floor. Some interior depth was lost when they got rid of Pau Gasol during the season. Assuming Dejounte Murray is back to full strength during this season, they don’t really need much help in the backcourt.\n\nTargets that make sense: If we’re looking at affordable forwards outside of Gay, players like Anthony Tolliver and Jonas Jerebko fit the bill. If he’s willing to come way down from his previous salary, someone like Taj Gibson would be perfect for Gregg Popovich. Luc Mbah a Moute seems like a Spurs type of forward as well. Someone who is younger but still needs to develop in the right system might turn them toward Stanley Johnson. If anybody can get him right, it’s Pop and the Spurs.\n\nOverall view: Especially with their two rookies coming in, the Spurs roster is pretty much set. Retaining Gay would all but seal a pretty quiet summer for the Spurs, unless they decide to move one of their two main guys. Both can be free agents after next season. DeRozan has a player option for $27.7 million and Aldridge has only $7 million of his $24 million guaranteed. Maybe those guys can net a big enough haul to round out some options for them in the near future.\n\nOptimism? I’m not sure how optimistic I would be about Gay returning this summer. He did a great job of returning from that Achilles’ tendon, and maybe it’s time for him to move onto more of a contender than this current version of the Spurs. If that’s the case, this offseason doesn’t have a ton of optimism. Most of that would rest on the shoulders of Lonnie Walker IV’s development and Dejounte Murray’s return from the ACL.\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nDo they have money? Legally? Yes, the Charlotte Hornets have a little money to play with in free agency. But that only exists if Kemba Walker bolts for greener pastures. At that point … YIKES. Here’s the current situation for the Hornets. They have $84.9 million tied up in Nicolas Batum, Bismack Biyombo, Marvin Williams, Cody Zeller, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. That doesn’t even begin to include a monster salary that would be required to keep Walker. At least for next season, this team is in salary cap spreadsheet ruin.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? Only if they re-sign Kemba. If they manage to pull that off, this team will be well into the luxury tax. That can’t be the case for a roster like this. That might end up being the worst allocation of money in the entire NBA. They could use the stretch provision on Biyombo at that point to escape it, but then they’d have future dead money to him on the books. Well, we don’t have to pretend it’s not dead money on the books with him on the roster.\n\nFree Agents: Kemba Walker, Jeremy Lamb, Frank Kaminsky (restricted), Shelvin Mack\n\nRoster needs: Talent. We could break down certain positions and see what this team needs, but they either need an influx of talent or an influx of assets that could eventually lead to talent. Even if Kemba stays for that big money, this team still doesn’t really have a whole lot to put around him.\n\nTargets that make sense: I guess re-signing Kemba is the biggest task at hand, but I’m honestly not sure how much sense it makes. They’d still be at least a year away from clearing some of this overpriced salary and finding ways to put complementary players around Kemba.\n\nOverall view: Hoping Kemba comes back for less than the supermax and then the trio of Miles Bridges, Malik Monk, and PJ Washington all fulfill their potential feels like the best-case scenario in which you can still sell tickets. The Hornets need to regroup and decide what their future is supposed to be. It can’t just be wasting Kemba and hoping cool jerseys boost revenue.\n\nOptimism? No. I don’t foresee a scenario in which the Hornets re-sign Walker and I feel good about their immediate direction moving forward. I also don’t foresee a scenario in which he leaves and then I feel good in them blowing things up to try to draft top flight talent.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nDo they have money? The Wizards don’t really have any money to play with because of all of their free agents this summer. The Wizards enter June 30 with eight guys and five of them are restricted. At least a few of those restricted guys are players they’ll want to bring back by signing or matching their offer shoots, should they not be too outrageous. The biggest killer to the Wizards’ cap situation this season is the infamous John Wall supermax that has now kicked in. He’s making over $38 million this season and we don’t even think he’ll end up playing.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? If they re-signed everybody in their free agent list, then they’d definitely be flirting with or up against the luxury tax. It’s safe to assume probably half of those guys are gone and I’m not sure how many will command big money. The Wizards should be safe from the luxury tax this season.\n\nFree Agents: Jabari Parker, Trevor Ariza, Sam Dekker (restricted), Bobby Portis (restricted), Tomas Satoransky (restricted), Thomas Bryant (restricted), Chasson Randle (restricted), Jeff Green\n\nRoster needs: Backcourt depth, wings, an interior presence, and a bionic Achilles’ tendon for Wall. The bionic body part probably won’t be cap friendly or even legal necessarily. The other stuff needs to be explored though. Currently, the two centers on the Wizards roster are Ian Mahinmi and Dwight Howard. Do you have any confidence in either of these guys being healthy and/or effective this coming season? Bradley Beal leads the charge on the perimeter but the next best wing is… Tony Brown Jr.? This roster needs a ton of work.\n\nTargets that make sense: If I’m Washington, I concentrate on bringing back Portis, Satoransky, and Bryant in restricted free agency. Ariza is gone. If Parker wants to come back for seven figures instead of eight, I’d be willing to listen. Although they did just draft Rui Hachimura for basically the same thing. If they lose Satoransky, they should definitely take a shot at reviving Isaiah Thomas’s career as Wall rehabs that injury. Anything after that is just bargain hunting at the bottom of the barrell.\n\nOverall view: It’s going to be a rough summer for them. They’ll at least kick around the idea of unloading Beal for a cornucopia of assets in return once they decide on a new front office. Just make Tommy Sheppard the full-time guy. Realistically, the Wizards are just trying to piece together a rotation that can make the No. 8 seed. If they bring back too many of these guys and miss the playoffs, that’s too expensive of a mess for Ted Leonsis to stomach.\n\nOptimism? Not until Wall proves to be healthy or tradable again. Unfortunately, the Wizards feel beyond repair this summer.\n\nNo Major Moves Coming… I Think\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\nDo they have money? Even with the dreaded Chandler Parsons contract still on the books this year, the Memphis Grizzlies have created some potential flexibility for themselves. After moving Marc Gasol at the trade deadline and Mike Conley before the draft, they actually could have around $10 million in cap space — depending on what happens with their incumbent free agents. If they truly want to bring back Jonas Valanciunas on a longer-term deal, then that cap space will be pretty much non-existent. They could carve out another $10-11 million by waiving Avery Bradley if they want. His deal isn’t guaranteed, other than $2 million. The Grizzlies maybe don’t have money but they have the potential for flexibility heading into Parsons’s last season on this deal.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? Not even close. Even if they re-sign Valanciunas and Delon Wright to highly competitive contracts, the Grizzlies should still completely avoid the luxury tax. That’s definitely a good thing considering they’re full-on in rebuild mode surrounding Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr as their starting foundation.\n\nFree Agents: Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright (restricted), Justin Holiday, Tyler Dorsey\n\nRoster needs: This roster is actually pretty set in terms of player numbers. They have nearly a full squad going into next season and that’s before they start re-signing guys. If they move on from guys like Bradley, Kyle Korver, and Jae Crowder in trades or waiving them, they’ll need an influx of wing players into the mix. But I don’t see them being too active early on in this summer, just because they can afford to slow play the year and see if the trade market might yield better assets during the season.\n\nTargets that make sense: Surprisingly, I don’t think they need to target anybody right now. They might be the only team on this list that I don’t believe really needs anybody. It’s not because this roster is so complete, but re-signing Valanciunas and Wright should be their main objectives this summer.\n\nOverall view: This is now the Morant and JJJ era in Memphis. They’ll have plenty of veterans to trade off over the next eight months or so. They can go into a similar mode as Cleveland last season when the Cavs were just making a bunch of small trades to keep acquiring future draft picks. That should be the Grizzlies over the next few months. No need to overreact and trade guys now. Let the demand of the market dictate your willingness to shop the veterans you have.\n\nOptimism? In terms of an active or interesting summer? Not really. This team is all about the future now and they still need to clear some guys out of here before they can truly focus on the future. For now, it’s going to be all Ja Morant highlights and making sure JJJ’s body is ready for his sophomore season. I guess the optimism probably comes out of the highlights from summer league, rather than the acquisitions they make this next month.\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nDo they have money? The Hawks might actually have some money to play with this summer. Even if they re-sign Dewayne Dedmon and Vince Carter, it wouldn’t eat too much into the $12 million or so the Hawks have in cap space. The craziest part about looking at the committed salaries of this Hawks roster is they have $62.3 million (57.1 percent of their cap) tied up in Evan Turner, Allen Crabbe, Miles Plumlee, and Solomon Hill. Any other real money they owe is all to their young guns on rookie deals. All four of those big money deals expire next summer, so the Hawks can either go into 2020 with a ridiculous amount of cap space or move those expiring deals right now for veterans and assets.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? They’re not anywhere close to the luxury tax and won’t be for a very long time.\n\nFree Agents: Dewayne Dedmon, Justin Anderson (restricted), Vince Carter\n\nRoster needs: The Hawks could really use an interior presence on this team. John Collins is really nice as a power forward, but they need more of a big man who can handle the physicality of the interior in the NBA. Alex Len can be that placeholder for now if they don’t want to rush, but he’s not likely to be a long-term solution for them at center. Trae Young will also need some help with the point guard duties, so finding a veteran backup would prove to be extremely valuable.\n\nTargets that make sense: I love the idea of re-signing Dedmon and Carter if possible. I’m a believer in Dedmon as a shot blocker and stretchy 5 type of big man. If not him, the veteran presence of someone like Amir Johnson or even throwing a bunch of money on a short-term deal with DeAndre Jordan (it would be a pay cut unless they can move a contract) would be a great addition to this core. A backup point guard like Ish Smith or even seeing if Patrick Beverley wants to play alongside Young would be pretty big time, but Beverley probably becomes too expensive at that point.\n\nOverall view: We’re realistically one year away from the Hawks potentially going nuts during a summer spending and trading spree. Travis Schlenk has set the Hawks up for being big time players in the near future. As long as Young, Collins, and Kevin Huerter improve while De’Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish hit decently, the Hawks have a great setup. It just probably won’t be a big splash this summer.\n\nOptimism? Let the optimism fly in Atlanta. This looks like the rebuild is going extremely well, and they don’t even have to think about spending big money yet just to spend it. They can take their time over the next year or two, before their young core starts looking into contract extensions.\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nDo they have money? If the Jazz don’t keep any of these free agents of theirs around, they clock in just under the salary cap by a couple hundred thousand dollars. They expected to have big cap space to play with this summer, but the acquisition of Mike Conley right before the draft ate a lot of that up. The Jazz could get more flexibility and clear some space if they want to chase a stretch-4 by waiving Derrick Favors and his $16.9 million contract prior to July 6th. They’ll weigh the options with stretching the floor more, but this team also loves having Favors in the mix.\n\nAre they in luxury tax danger? No chance they approach the luxury tax this season. Dennis Lindsey has this team in the clear with that.\n\nFree Agents: Ricky Rubio, Thabo Sefolosha, Ekpe Udoh, Tyler Cavanaugh (restricted), Naz Mitrou-Long\n\nRoster needs: The Jazz will look at stretch-4 options this summer, but their focus needs to be on finding competent wings to fill out the rotation. Joe Ingles and Royce O’Neale are all they have next to Conley and Donovan Mitchell. Maybe Georges Niang can do some of that, as well, but they need to go find some guys. Bringing back Thabo Sefolosha would be ideal, especially with the way he shot the 3-ball. They just won’t have the depth they need until Dante Exum is back and healthy. A backup point guard or combo guard behind the starting backcourt could be necessary before Exum returns. Raul Neto is solid, but an upgrade wouldn’t hurt.\n\nTargets that make sense: If you’re looking at stretch-4 targets, someone like Nikola Mirotic or even a JaMychal Green might really work for Utah. Grabbing someone like TJ McConnell or Shabazz Napier might work for a cheaper option behind Conley. Troy Daniels and Garrett Temple would be great options as a combo guard off the bench. Their flexibility and aggressiveness will hinge on what they do with Favors.\n\nOverall view: The Jazz made their big splash with the Conley trade, and I’m not sure I buy that they’ll be parting with Favors, despite the contract being set up to do exactly that. I’d expect Dennis Lindsey and their front office to be aggressive in how they try to find another wing to bring off the bench with O’Neale. Maybe they’ll search for an Ekpe Udoh replacement for depth too, but for the most part the Jazz should have their core pretty set right now.\n\nOptimism? There should be a ton of optimism. With the Warriors’ injuries and the trade for Conley, the Jazz are on the cusp of being a contender in the West. It will still be a packed house when it comes to figuring out who emerges from the playoff rubble out West, but the Jazz should have as good a shot as anybody to be that squad.\n\nPart 2 of the 2019 NBA Free Agency Primer with the big cap space teams can be found here.\n\n(Photo: Alonzo Adams-USA TODAY Sports)"
