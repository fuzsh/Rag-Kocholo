        "text": "Former Sonoma State Seawolf forward Jaylen Wells was drafted by the Memphis Grizzlies in the second round of the National Basketball Association (NBA) draft on Thursday, June 27, making him the first in the Seawolf program’s history to become an NBA player.\n\n\"From the day I started recruiting Jaylen, his goal was to play in the NBA. With such high character and a relentless work ethic, he's made his dream come true. I couldn't be happier for Jaylen and his family,” SSU Men's Basketball Head Coach Rich Shayewitz said.\n\n“It was an honor to coach him for two years and to be part of his life. All of us in the Seawolf basketball family and Sonoma State community are rooting for him!\"\n\nWells played for Sonoma State during the 2021 and 2022 seasons before transferring to play for the Washington State Cougars in 2023. In the Cougars’ story announcing his arrival, Wells credited Shayewitz with giving him the playing experience he needed to progress.\n\n“The coach at Sonoma gave me a huge role as a freshman. That was big in my development, so I thank him and the whole program for that,” he said.\n\nAs a sophomore, Wells was named a Division II All-American and California Collegiate Athletic Association Player of the year, having led the conference in average points (22.4) and rebounds (8.7) per game."
