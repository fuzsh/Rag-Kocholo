In a National Basketball Association (NBA) career that began in 2009, Green has played for six teams. As of 2020, Green is one of the four players in history to have won NBA championships with three different teams; he won titles with the San Antonio Spurs in 2014, the Toronto Raptors in 2019, and the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. Green last played for the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nGreen played college basketball for the University of North Carolina (UNC) from 2005 to 2009, where he played in more games (145) and had more wins (123) than any Tar Heel before him. Green is also the only player in the history of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) with at least 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, 250 assists, 150 three–pointers, 150 blocks, and 150 steals. He won an NCAA championship in 2009 during his senior year.\n\nGreen was subsequently drafted by the Cavaliers with the 46th overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. After being waived by the Cavaliers, Green played for the San Antonio Spurs, the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Developmental League, and KK Olimpija in Slovenia. Green became a starting Guard for the Spurs during the 2011–12 season and remained with the Spurs until 2018. During the 2013 NBA Finals, Green set an NBA record for most three–point field goals made in a Finals series (23). He then won an NBA championship the following year's Finals, and became just the third player from UNC to win an NCAA championship and an NBA championship, the two others being Michael Jordan and James Worthy. In 2019, he won a second NBA championship in his only season with the Toronto Raptors and followed that up with a third championship in 2020 in his only season with the Los Angeles Lakers. Known for his perimeter defense, Green has been a key contributor on both ends on the floor throughout his NBA career, having been selected to his first NBA All–Defensive Second Team in the 2016–17 season.\n\nHigh school career[]\n\nAs a high school freshman, Green attended North Babylon High School in North Babylon, New York, on Long Island and in addition to basketball, he played quarterback on the football team. From his sophomore year onwards, Green attended St. Mary's High School, a private school, in Manhasset, New York. He averaged 20 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists, and 4 blocks as a senior. Considered a four–star recruit by Rivals.com, Green was listed as the No. 8 Shooting Guard and the No. 31 player in the nation in 2005.\n\nCollege career[]\n\nGreen came off the bench as the sixth man during his freshman year at UNC. He averaged 5.2 points and 2.8 rebounds in his sophomore season. After his second year at North Carolina, Green considered transferring, but would ultimately finish his college career there.\n\nIn Green's junior year, he averaged 11.5 points, 4.9 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.9 turnovers, 1.2 steals, 1.2 blocks in 22.3 minutes per game. He also improved his true shooting percentage (TS%) significantly, increasing his field goal percentage to 46.9% and his free throw percentage to 87.3%. He shot 37.3% from the three–point line.\n\nApproaching his senior season, Green declared himself eligible for the 2008 NBA Draft, but did not sign with an agent so that he had the option to return to school, which he decided to do on June 16, 2008. He was named team captain alongside Bobby Frasor and Tyler Hansbrough for the year, and started every game as the Tar Heels won their fifth national championship. Green averaged 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.7 turnovers, 1.8 steals, and 1.3 blocks in 27.4 minutes per game for the season, again improving his shooting percentages, averaging 47.1% and 41.8% from the field and three–point line respectively. Green was selected to the All–ACC Third Team, and the ACC's All–Defensive Team. He ended his college career with 1,368 points for the Tar Heels, and held the school's all–time record for wins, with 123. Green played in more games (145) than any Tar Heel before him. As of 2009, Green was also the only player in the history of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) with at least 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, 250 assists, 150 three–pointers, 150 blocks, and 150 steals.\n\nProfessional career[]\n\nCleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)[]\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers selected Green as the 46th overall pick of the 2009 NBA Draft. After he played in 20 games in his rookie year with the Cavaliers, the team waived Green at the beginning of the next season.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (2010)[]\n\nGreen was picked up by the San Antonio Spurs on November 17, 2010. The Spurs waived him six days later after he appeared in two games.\n\nReno Bighorns (2011)[]\n\nIn January 2011, Green was acquired by the Reno Bighorns of the NBA D-League. He averaged 20 points, a team high, and 7.5 rebounds in 16 games with the Bighorns.\n\nReturn to San Antonio (2011)[]\n\nThe Spurs signed Green again in March 2011, assigned him to the Austin Toros of the NBA Development League on April 2, and then recalled him on April 3.\n\nOlimpija (2011)[]\n\nIn August 2011, Green signed a one–year contract with KK Union Olimpija, which included an NBA–out clause option when the 2011 NBA lockout ended.\n\nThird stint with Spurs (2011–2018)[]\n\n2011–13: Playoff upsets[]\n\nGreen returned to the Spurs in 2011 after the lockout ended.

On February 6, 2013, Green recorded career–highs of 28 points and 8 three–pointers made in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. He was one three–pointer shy of Chuck Person's record for most three–pointers made in a single game as a Spur.\n\nIn Game 2 of the 2013 NBA Finals, Green was perfect from the field, including 5–5 from the three–point line. However, the Spurs lost in a blowout to the Miami Heat, 103–84 In Game 3 of the Finals, Green hit 7–9 from three–point range, including the one to set a Finals record for most three–pointers in a game by a team. He notched 27 total points in the Spurs' blowout 113–77 victory as the team took a 2–1 series lead in the process. On June 16 in Game 5, Green made six three–pointers for a total of 25 in the series to that point, breaking the record for an NBA Finals series previously held by Ray Allen, who made 22 in six games with the Boston Celtics in 2008. By the end of the series, Green had made 27 three–pointers, but the Spurs lost the series in seven games. The record was later broken by Stephen Curry in 2016.\n\n2013–18: First championship, All–Defensive Team Selection, and final years with the Spurs[]\n\nOn April 11, 2014, Green scored a career–high 33 points in a 112–104 win over the Phoenix Suns. On June 15, 2014, Green won his first NBA championship after the Spurs defeated the Miami Heat 4 games to 1 in the 2014 NBA Finals. In doing so, Green joined Michael Jordan and James Worthy as the third Tar Heel to win both the NCAA and NBA championship.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, Green scored a season–high 27 points in the 119–129 triple overtime loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. On April 12, 2015, Green recorded 3 three–pointers against the Phoenix Suns to set a franchise record for the most three–pointers in a season at 191.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, Green re–signed with the Spurs to a reported four–year, $45 million contract. On January 6, 2016, Green hit two three–pointers against the Utah Jazz, giving him 662 with San Antonio to surpass Bruce Bowen (661) for second in franchise history.\n\nOn November 9, 2016, Green made his season debut for San Antonio, scoring eight points against the Houston Rockets in his return from a strained left quadriceps. At the season's end, he was named to the NBA All–Defensive Second Team.\n\nOn December 28, 2017, against the New York Knicks, Green became the 127th player in league history to reach 900 career 3–pointers.\n\nToronto Raptors (2018–2019)[]\n\nOn July 18, 2018, Green and teammate Kawhi Leonard were traded to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Pöltl, and a protected 2019 first round draft pick.

His 28 points are the most points in a debut in franchise history, breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record of 27 points.\n\nGreen watched the Lakers finish the season with the top seed in the Western Conference in a shortened season due to the COVID-19 pandemic that suspended the season for four months. The Lakers reached the 2020 NBA Finals, where they defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA championship.
