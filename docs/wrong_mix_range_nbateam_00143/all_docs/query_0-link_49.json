        "text": "He was signed by Boston because of his ability to score in bunches, because while the Celtics stress defense and fundamentals, they needed somebody to shoot the rock with little conscience. They needed a lower-budget Jamal Crawford, a player who has stayed around because of his ability to change the course of games offensively.\n\nSuch was the case for Green on Tuesday against the Memphis Grizzlies. After failing to score in double figures in any of the Celtics’ first 31 games, and playing in only 14 of those mostly because of ineffectiveness, Green stunned the Grizzlies with 19 points in 19 minutes in Boston’s 113-103 win.\n\nThis was the Green the Celtics have been waiting for, the scorer, the one who takes bad shots but makes them, uses his still-impressive athleticism to make plays, who plays without thinking. The Celtics were willing to take the risks of playing Green chunks of minutes, only he spent the first two months playing tentatively.\n\nBefore his Christmas Day appearance against the Knicks, Green was 8 for 29 from 3-point land (27.5 percent) and 17 for 57 overall (29.8 percent) . When Green isn’t hitting shots, there wasn’t much reason to play him, so Stevens went with rookie Jaylen Brown, a talented player still in the development stage.\n\nA hunch encouraged Stevens to play Green on Christmas and he responded by scoring 8 points in 11:40, sparking his sleepy teammates with defensive intensity. On Tuesday, Green scored 10 of his points in the second quarter as the Celtics assumed control. He added 9 points in the fourth as the Celtics fought off Memphis, despite the Grizzlies being without Mike Conley and Chandler Parsons.\n\n“I don’t like put it on any one guy to live up to that kind of night every night, but I think the bottom line is that he certainly is capable of that,” Stevens said. “And I talked about it in the preseason: He’s a guy that when he gets into a rhythm you have to be wary of, if you’re the opponent. And I felt that way when we were coaching against him. He’s had an impact — big impact — in the last two games; energy plays, too.”\n\nGreen scored 7 consecutive points in one stretch to help the Celtics maintain their 5-point lead. He left with 3:44 left to a standing ovation from the TD Garden crowd. The Celtics faithful have never had issue with Green. He gave them some delightful moments on two really bad Boston teams.\n\nHe was an essential part to make the Kevin Garnett trade a reality, but something happened to Green on the way to Minnesota. He lost his game, complained of his role, and asked for a trade. He then began his basketball descent, bouncing around the NBA before heading to Russia and then trying to find himself and regain his love for the same.\n\nSo when he came back to Boston after a stint with the Heat, Green understood he needed to be a leader for the young core. They remembered his dunk contest conquests, as well as his sudden decline. So he spent his training camp and early season playing cheerleader and mentor, preparing himself for the opportunity, but unsure it would ever come.\n\n“I don’t know man, I’m just trying to stay ready at all times,” he said. “It’s all about being a professional. I think [Stevens] just kind of knows I’ll be ready. I’m always kind of talking to the team, I just have to kind of do whatever I’m telling the team to do. I know it’s a tough time because it’s a lot of people on this team who can play, it’s always going to be somebody that’s unhappy.”\n\nDuring his time on the bench, Green was on his feet, cheering on his teammates. He befriended the rookies during training camp. He came back to Boston with humility, knowing that others who passed through here in the Stevens era were resistant to leadership, were more consumed with their role, and lost their passion.\n\nGreen’s passion is still very much present. He’s 30 but has only played in 512 NBA games, or roughly six seasons. He still has game left. He still has some spring in those legs, and he’s finally showing Stevens and his teammates that he’s prepared to help this team as the games begin to become more significant."
