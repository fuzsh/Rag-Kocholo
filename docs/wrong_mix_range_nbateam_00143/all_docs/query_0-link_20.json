        "text": "Welcome to another installment of the Scientific Method, a column in which I investigate my own ideas about the NBA to determine how wrong I am. This actually started as a straightforward piece about Gerald Green’s success for the Rockets over the past week, but in working on it, I ended up going down some rabbit holes and thought it would be more interesting to explore those. (Plus, a couple of members of The 94 Feet Report team already wrote about Green after his hot start for other sites. Here’s Kelly Scaletta briefly mentioning Green over at FanRag. Here’s our founder and editor Eric Spyropoulos at Hoops Habit with a longer story on Green.)\n\nBackground\n\nGerald Green was a high school phenom in the Houston area, earning a spot in the McDonald’s All-American Game his senior season. He was picked 18th by the Celtics. Despite rumors at the time that the Rockets wanted to trade up to draft Green, a deal never materialized and Houston picked Luther Head 24th. Head was a great three point shooter and lasted with the Rockets until 2009, but he never became a vital part of the team. Green played two seasons in Boston before being included in the trade that brought Kevin Garnett to the Celtics. He played 29 games for the Timberwolves before the Rockets acquired him in a trade in 2008. Green only suited up for one game as a Rocket, playing four minutes and scoring six points, before he was released.\n\nGreen has bounced around the league since then, going from a promising young player to a journeyman. There was a bit of a renaissance during a two year stint with the Suns from 2013 to 2015, but his playing time and production declined over the past two seasons with Miami and Boston. Green was working out and hoping for another shot when Houston signed him on December 28. He’s played exceptionally well since then. Can his current success translate into something that helps Houston in the long term?\n\nObservation\n\nGreen has been exactly the player Houston has needed since he was signed, playing big minutes and scoring points to help the team weather injuries to James Harden and Luc Mbah a Moute. He’s helped cut down Trevor Ariza and Eric Gordon’s minutes. In short, Green was a great pickup.\n\nHouston famously picked up another key player during the season, back in December of 2014, when they signed Josh Smith right after he was waived by the Pistons. Smith was a big part of getting the team to the Western Conference Finals, where the team lost to Golden State.\n\nWe hear a lot of talk about the buyout market. How often do teams acquire a player — whether after a buyout or just directly off the street — in the middle of the season and then have him play a key role on the team during the season AND in the playoffs? Clearly this happens when players are acquired via trade, but free agents usually replace the roster spot of the worst player on a team, which should mean that it’s harder for them to find their role.\n\nHypothesis\n\nI’m going into this research with these two thoughts:1) signing a player in the middle of the season often helps keep key players fresh for the playoffs and 2) it’s probably rare that those players end up being huge pieces DURING the playoffs, when rotations shorten and coaches lean on the players they trust the most.\n\nDefinitions\n\nI brought up Josh Smith, so let’s use that season (2014–2015) as the start date for this investigation and last season (2016–2017) as the end date; we want to see how these players affect their teams in the current NBA atmosphere (i.e. the era of the Warriors and Cavaliers). Let’s also look only at players on teams that advanced past the first round of the playoffs, leaving us with four teams in each conference. There clearly aren’t eight teams capable of winning the title each year, but I’m confident in saying that we can consider those eight teams to be “good” and, therefore, can judge how mid-season free agents contributed to good teams. The players should average at least ten minutes per game too.\n\n2014–2015\n\nHouston: Josh Smith\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: Lester Hudson, Nate Robinson\n\nSome players who just missed the 10 minutes per game cut: Kendrick Perkins (CLE), JaMychal Green (MEM), Jordan Hamilton (LAC), and James Michael McAdoo (GSW).\n\n2015–2016\n\nCleveland: Dahntay Jones technically qualified by playing 42 minutes in his one game. I’m not going to actually count him.\n\nMiami: Joe Johnson\n\nSan Antonio: Kevin Martin, Andre Miller\n\nToronto: Jason Thompson\n\n2016–2017\n\nCleveland: Deron Williams, Derrick Williams\n\nGolden State: Matt Barnes\n\nHouston: Isaiah Taylor, Troy Williams\n\nWashington: Brandon Jennings\n\nThe Data\n\nSo, we have the players. The first thing I’m noting here is that only one of these players played for that season’s champion (because, again, not counting Dahntay Jones, nope!): Golden State’s Matt Barnes. The anecdotal evidence here says that these players don’t often help a team win a title, but only one out of 30 teams wins a title every year, so there’s already a very small chance that any player contributes for that year’s champions. By expanding it to each season’s final eight teams, we get a little better of an idea of how these mid-season additions matter, right?\n\n[This is the part of the article where I publicly question my decision to restrict this to just the past three seasons, because it gives me such a small sample size. I’m ultimately defending my choice because I think this current NBA landscape — where there are just two teams that seem to have a real shot at making the Finals — is pretty weird and unique, so knowing how a free agent acquisition worked during the pre-Golden State days might not tell us enough about how they’ll work out this season.]\n\nAlright, so here’s the first bit of analysis I’m going to do: measuring how these players’ minutes per game during that regular season changed during that year’s postseason.\n\n2014–2015\n\nHouston: Josh Smith\n\nSmith played 25.5 minutes per game for the Rockets during the regular season, earning the starting nod in seven of his 55 games. He played slightly less — 23.3 minutes per game — in the postseason and helped Houston make the Western Conference Finals in a victory over the Clippers. Smith started in four of his first five games as a Rocket, but then he was moved to a bench role as Donatas Motiejunas returned to the starting role.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers: Lester Hudson, Nate Robinson\n\nHudson played 11.2 minutes per game in five regular season games. He played just 5.4 per game in the playoffs. Robinson was cut before the playoffs began.\n\nBonus: Golden State Warriors: James Michael McAdoo\n\nMcAdoo was signed late in the season and played 9.1 minutes per game for the Warriors. He played just two minutes per game in the playoffs as the Warriors narrowed the rotation.\n\n2015–2016\n\nMiami: Joe Johnson\n\nJohnson started all 24 games he played for the Heat, averaging 32 minutes per game. He started 14 playoff games, averaging 35.1 minutes per game. Miami lost in the second round.\n\nSan Antonio: Kevin Martin, Andre Miller\n\nMartin averaged 16.3 minutes in the regular season, then just 9.8 in the playoffs. That number is inflated by two blowout wins against the Grizzlies in which Martin played extended minutes. Martin was most active for the Spurs down the stretch in the regular season as the team rested key players.\n\nAndre Miller averaged 13.9 minutes in the regular season as he played a similar role to Martin. That fell to 7 in the playoffs as Miller wasn’t a part of the main rotation.\n\nToronto: Jason Thompson\n\nThompson started six games for the Raptors in the regular season, averaging 15.4 minutes across his 19 total games. Thompson’s role was fairly inconsistent, though, and he ended up playing just 5.5 minutes per game in the playoffs.\n\n2016–2017\n\nCleveland: Deron Williams, Derrick Williams\n\nThe Cavs were in need of someone to back up Kyrie Irving last season and brought in Deron Williams, who ended up playing 20.3 minutes per game in the regular season. That shrunk to 14.6 in the playoffs, but Williams still played a key role for Cleveland.\n\nDerrick Williams played 17.1 minutes per game in the regular season. That dropped to just 4.8 in the postseason as he found himself outside the Cleveland rotation. Williams played a big part in helping Cleveland weather a long stretch without Kevin Love, but he wasn’t able to make an impact once Love returned.\n\nGolden State: Matt Barnes\n\nBarnes averaged 20.5 minutes during the regular season. He was useful while Durant was out, but he wasn’t a factor in the playoffs — just 5.1 minutes per game.\n\nHouston: Isaiah Taylor, Troy Williams\n\nTaylor (regular season): 4 games, 13.0 mpg // Taylor (playoffs): 3 games, 3.3 mpg\n\nWilliams (regular season): 6 games, 23.2 mpg // Williams (playoffs): 5 games, 3.8 mpg\n\n(BY THE WAY, as a Rockets fan, I wish Williams had gotten more run in the playoffs. Houston was struggling with injuries in the Spurs series, but Mike D’Antoni just shrunk the rotation. Williams could have been useful to give key players a breather.)\n\nWashington: Brandon Jennings\n\n16.3 minutes per game across 23 regular season games, then 13.7 minutes in the playoffs.\n\nMaking Sense Of The Data\n\nLet’s do a quick reset here. The main point of this article is to see if history suggests that Gerald Green can be a key part of a postseason run for the Rockets based on how other mid-season acquisitions have performed.\n\nHere’s what I’m seeing from the data:\n\nMany of these players DID have a big impact for their teams in the regular season, whether by playing heavy minutes at a position of need (Josh Smith, Joe Johnson, etc.) or by helping their teams weather injury issues.\n\nOnce the postseason arrived, ONLY the players who had a defined role that didn’t depend on injuries or San Antonio-style resting continued to have a role on their teams. The players who played significant playoff minutes: Josh Smith, Joe Johnson, Deron Williams, and Brandon Jennings.\n\nThose four players share something important in common: they had a role on their team as soon as they joined it because they represented a positional upgrade for their team. These weren’t depth signings. They didn’t play their way into the rotation. They were signed to be part of a contending team.\n\nNone of these players played for the team that won the championship during that season, but they did play key roles on good teams, especially Smith and Johnson. Smith helped win Houston a playoff series. Johnson was a key piece of the Heat making it as far as they did.\n\nWhat category does Gerald Green fit into? Well…it’s complicated.\n\nThe Gerald Green Data\n\nGerald Green is a little bit of a conundrum. Not counting his first game with the Rockets, when he showed up in Boston on almost zero notice and played 11 minutes, Green has played 20+ minutes in every game as a Rocket. The only player over the past three years in our sample that played that much and DIDN’T end up contributing during the playoffs was Matt Barnes, who primarily played for Golden State in the absence of Kevin Durant.\n\nHouston signed Green after Luc Mbah a Moute went down with a shoulder injury. He instantly had a role, but that role has come in games where Houston was missing at least one (and usually two) of James Harden, Chris Paul, and Mbah a Moute. History suggests that Green’s role should shrink once Houston is fully healthy.\n\nThe Rockets are currently running an eight man rotation. If Green continues to play key minutes for the team AFTER Harden and Mbah a Moute return, it would mean the team would be running a ten man rotation. Expanded rotations isn’t something that head coach Mike D’Antoni is known for. In last year’s Game 5 loss to the Spurs, for instance, the Rockets played just seven players due to injuries.\n\nGreen’s excelling as a shooter in Houston’s offense, but he’s never been a great defensive player. He’s got a box plus/minus of -4.4 this season, whereas Mbah a Moute’s box plus/minus this year is 1.5. Houston has three guards capable of shouldering the scoring load, plus Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson. P.J. Tucker and Mbah a Moute bring much more defensively to the table for the Rockets than Green.\n\nConclusions\n\nRecent history suggests that NBA head coaches will lean on the players who were there since the beginning of the season, unless a player was specifically signed with a role in mind. Despite his strong play, Gerald Green was signed because the team was dealing with injuries. If Houston is healthy come playoff time, I’m not sure Green — despite how well he’s scoring the ball right now — will play a huge role. I could be wrong — it’s possible that Mbah a Moute and P.J. Tucker don’t bring enough to the table as shooters to both play big playoff minutes against a team like Golden State. I think we’ll know more once Harden and Mbah a Moute return and we see how Green’s minutes change as a result. If he drops down to something like 15 a game, he’s likely going to see an even bigger drop come playoff time."
