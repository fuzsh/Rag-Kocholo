        "text": "To the average person living outside of Houston, July 13 is just another hot summer day. But to residents of Houston and surrounding areas, it is recognized as “713 Day,” with the numbers signifying the initial area code that originated in 1947 for the city. On Thursday, the Rockets partnered with Houston Parks and Recreation Department and launched a campaign called “713 Day of Basketball,” as former players of the team hosted seven free youth basketball clinics at different community centers around the city. “Anytime I see 713, I think of Houston,” said native Houstonian and former Rockets player Gerald Green, who, along with Steve Francis and NBA shooting coach Chris Matthews, led basketball-related activities for children at the Moody Community Center.\n\nBrandon ‘Scoop B’ Robinson: JUST IN at @BallySports : Former Rockets, Nets, Celtics Gerald Green & Ice Cube @thebig3 have mutual interest per sources. According to folks in the know: both the Big 3 and Green are in talks in which you could see Green available to play in the Big 3 league this summer."
