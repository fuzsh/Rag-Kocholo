        "text": "Since being hired as the General Manager of the Chicago Bears, Ryan Poles has methodically torn down and rebuilt the roster. Despite having a few spots up for grabs, there will still be some surprise cuts and competition to determine who makes the 53-man roster. With the Bears heading into training camp, here are the 53-man roster projections.\n\nChicago Bears 53-Man Roster Projection: Who’s In & Who’s Out\n\nQuarterback (2)\n\nCaleb Williams, Tyson Bagent\n\nThe recent confirmation of Caleb Williams’ status as the Bears’ starting quarterback solidifies his position as QB1 for the upcoming season. He has already started building connections with his teammates, showcasing his team-first mentality. Without a veteran quarterback signing during free agency, Tyson Bagent will assume the No. 2 spot and back up Williams. Bagent had some impressive moments during his rookie year and is working hard to become a more dynamic thrower and athlete.\n\nRunning Back (5)\n\nD’Andre Swift, Roschon Johnson, Khalil Herbert, Travis Homer, Khari Blasingame (FB)\n\nAt the start of free agency, the Bears made a big splash by signing D’Andre Swift to a substantial three-year, $24 million contract. Swift is set to be the Bears’ featured back, adding his versatility and pass-catching skills to the team. One of the few competitions on this Bears roster will be who gets the RB2 spot behind Swift. Roschon Johnson is a younger asset with the ability to block in the backfield when needed, and Khalil Herbert is entering the final year of his rookie contract with a chip on his shoulder. It’ll be interesting to see who wins the backup running back spot.\n\nWide Receiver (6)\n\nD.J. Moore, Keenan Allen, Rome Odunze, Tyler Scott, Dante Pettis, Velus Jones Jr.\n\nThe Bears went from one of the worst wide receiver rooms to the best in just a few seasons. Having D.J. Moore, Keenan Allen, and rookie Rome Odunze will greatly help Caleb Williams. Beyond these three, Tyler Scott shows significant potential as he enters his sophomore season, and Velus Jones Jr. seems to have one final opportunity under the new kickoff rules. The final roster spot will likely be a competition between DeAndre Carter and Dante Pettis.\n\nTight End (3)\n\nCole Kmet, Gerald Everett, Marcedes Lewis\n\nThe Bears have one of the best tight end duos in Cole Kmet and newly acquired Gerald Everett. Re-signing Marcedes Lewis is the cherry on top and will provide valuable leadership as the team’s oldest player.\n\nOffensive Line (9)\n\nBraxton Jones, Teven Jenkins, Coleman Shelton, Nate Davis, Darnell Wright, Ryan Bates, Kiran Amegadije, Matt Pryor, Ja’Tyre Carter\n\nThe Bears had their fair share of problems on the offensive line last season but have added new pieces. Ryan Bates heads over from the Buffalo Bills via a trade to compete for the starting center spot with free-agent signing Coleman Shelton. Aside from that, the only other question on the offensive line is at right guard. Nate Davis did not participate much during the offseason, and there are questions about whether he’ll be the starting RG. With new addition Matt Pryor, 2021 fifth-round pick Larry Borom finds himself missing out on a roster spot.\n\nDefensive Line (9)\n\nMontez Sweat, Gervon Dexter Sr., Andrew Billings, DeMarcus Walker, Austin Booker, Zacch Pickens, Keith Randolph Jr., Khalid Kareem, OPEN SPOT*\n\nThe Bears’ defensive line is arguably the weakest position group on the team. Apart from Pro Bowler Montez Sweat, they struggle to generate pressure and sacks. There is an open spot on the defensive line, as reports suggest the Bears are still seeking to add a reliable pass rusher. The only undrafted rookie to make the team, Keith Randolph Jr. is one of the most expensive undrafted players, signing a three-year contract with $220,000 in guaranteed money. He has the potential to be the Bears’ next diamond in the rough. That said, 2022 fifth-round pick Dominique Robinson doesn’t make the cut.\n\nLinebacker (5)\n\nT.J. Edwards, Tremaine Edmunds, Jack Sanborn, Noah Sewell, Amen Ogbongbemiga\n\nThe linebacker group is pretty much set. The three starters have provided huge contributions and will show that the Bears have one of the best starting linebacker groups in the NFL. Conversely, Noah Sewell and Amen Ogbongbemiga will mostly be special teamers next season and will provide depth in the linebacker room.\n\nCornerback (7)\n\nJaylon Johnson, Tyrique Stevenson, Kyler Gordon, Terell Smith, Josh Blackwell, Greg Stroman Jr., Jaylon Jones\n\nThe Bears cornerback trio of Jaylon Johnson, Tyrique Stevenson, and Kyler Gordon is among the league’s best. Terell Smith has proven he’s a solid CB, and the other three corners are solid contributors on special teams.\n\nSafety (4)\n\nKevin Byard, Jaquan Brisker, Elijah Hicks, Jonathan Owens\n\nKevin Byard comes over from the Philadelphia Eagles to replace Eddie Jackson. Besides that, the safety group is mainly set, with the last spot being a competition between Elijah Hicks and veterans Adrian Colbert and Quindell Johnson.\n\nSpecialists (3)\n\nCairo Santos, Tory Taylor, Patrick Scales\n\nThere are no surprises here; the specialists will be Cairo Santos, rookie sensation Tory Taylor, and longtime Bear Patrick Scales to round out the Bears’ 53-man roster. Tory Taylor will be a refreshing change from Trenton Gill at punter, offering an extra edge with his impressive 50-yard plus punts."
