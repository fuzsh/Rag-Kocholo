The Houston Rockets were expecting a lot out of Gerald Green this season. The injury he suffered during the team’s final preseason game against the Miami Heat completely derailed that, but the team isn’t looking to replace the veteran shooting guard any time soon.

The Athletic’s Shams Charania talked about Houston’s plans in the aftermath of the Lisfranc fracture on his left foot that will likely keep him out of Houston’s rotation for the season on the latest edition of Charania’s Inside Pass.

With Rockets guard Gerald Green likely out for the season because of surgery on his broken left foot, according to league sources, Houston is confident in its team, plans to keep Green on the regular-season roster and is not currently pursuing any moves for a wing player. The Rockets discussed different scenarios to acquire Andre Iguodala from the Memphis Grizzlies in July, but elected not to go that route.

Green was a terrific option for the Rockets’ second unit. The twelve-year journeyman finished the 2018-19 season with a decent stat line of 9.2 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 0.5 assists in 20 minutes of game time. He also had decent shooting splits of 40%/35%/84%.

While Charania believes that the team won’t be going to pursue a swingman this season, the Rockets need to allot his minutes to another player. Thabo Sefolosha, PJ Tucker, and Ben McLemore will be the most likely beneficiaries for Green’s absence. If those doesn’t work out, then they will have to give up assets to get a decent wing player to the team.

The Rockets are in the competitive Western Conference, and Green’s absence puts a dent on their chances to make the Finals. Mike D’Antoni must look for a capable Green replacement even if they don’t plan on cutting him from the roster.
