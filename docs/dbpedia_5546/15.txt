Simmern-Rheinböllen Associated Municipality Coat of Arms

Shield Sable, a lion rampant Or, crowned, armed and tingued Gules; mantled, at dexter lozengy of Argent and Azure, at sinister Or an annulet Gules with an annexed arrowhead of the same in bend sinister.

Meaning: The lion from the Palatine arms is representing both former entities. Their arms both displayed differentiations. The lion had been passant on the arms of the Simmern Associated Municipality. Hewas reduced to his head on the arms of Rheinböllen Associated Municipality. The Bavarian lozenges are taken from the arms of the former, the annulet with arrowhead from the armsof the latter. It is the alchemical symbol of iron and is referring to ore mining and iron processing in the former entity. Both entities historically belonged to the Principality of Pfalz-Simmern, represented by the lions, which was ruled by the Wittelsbach kin, represented by the lozenges. The orle had been the symbol of a subcounty and later of an associated municipality.

Simmern Coat of Arms

Shield parted per fess; above Sable a lion passant Or, crowned, armed and tongued Gules; beneath lozengy bendy of Argent and Azure.

Meaning:

The village was owned by the Raugraves (Latin: comites hirsuti), which had been counts of undeveloped land. Their privileges were confirmed in 1330. In 1358 the area was acquired by the Wittelsbach kin. Palatine Count Stephan established the Principality of Pfalz-Simmern, which existed until 1685. The current pattern is based upon the oldest local seal, which was made before 1400. The lion passant is a differentiation of the Palatine arms, which shows a lion rampant instead. The lower half displayed the Bavarian lozenges. Inbetween the crown of the lion had been omitted. Simmern gained city rights in 1330, partially confirmed in 1555, lost the status of a city in 1794 but regained it in 1857.
